He apparently is fighting that extradition. Here's what it sounded like yesterday As completely outta touch, insult the of the American people experience. Okay? So what he appears to be shouting there is it's an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience. It's not exactly clear what he is talking about right there.

As president, Trump has established a strategic bitcoin reserve for the federal government and pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a black market website that was key to the early growth of bitcoin. Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies. Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family’s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly. The Trump family holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values is often tied to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Senate advanced legislation earlier this month that creates a federal framework to regulate stablecoins, a bill that Vance said the Trump administration wants passed into law quickly. Trump’s media company announced Tuesday that it was raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, the world’s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency.

The U.S. imports about 98% of the uranium it uses to generate 30% of the world’s nuclear energy. More than two-thirds of U.S. imports come from the world’s top three uranium-mining countries: Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Less government regulation won’t spur more U.S. uranium mining by itself. The market matters. And while spot-market prices are up from several years ago, they’re down about a third from their recent high in early 2024. While some new uranium mining and processing projects have been announced, their number falls far short of a surge. That suggests prices need to rise — and stay there — for a true industry revival, said John Uhrie, a former uranium executive who now works in the cement industry. “Until the price goes up dramatically, you’re not going to be able to actually put these places into operation,” Uhrie said. “You need significant capital on the ground.” Still, the industry is showing new life in the Southwest.

Yet, as we as, as we also reported before as well under the Biden administration, 16 million new jobs record, high stock market, it set records like every day record, high new business applications, record high middle class wealth gains record, high private investment in American manufacturing, strongest growth among leading economies. (9m 47s): And, it wasn't just like by accident, right? There's the Infrastructure Act, inflation reduction Act, Biden's concept of bottom up, middle out economics versus let's provide social welfare for billionaires. That's who needs welfare. The billionaires need to be taken care of even more, which is Trump's plan. When you unlock the ingenuity of the American worker, which Biden realized, and you invest in the worker that lifts us all up, Trump's plan is the opposite. And frankly worse than the opposite. 'cause he just doesn't know what he's doing. He's incompetent. So I've always been saying to people, I don't know what you've invented in your mind about this guy. In addition to how dangerous he, he's, he's an idiot. (10m 29s): He has no clue what he's doing with the economy.

PBS,"underscored that U.S. “intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine” would continue. Prior to his call with Trump, Zelenskyy said Putin’s limited ceasefire pledge was “very much at odds with reality” after Russia launched an overnight barrage of drone strikes across Ukraine, including some that struck Ukrainian energy facilities. Russia responded by saying it had halted its targeting of Ukraine’s energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking Russian equipment near one of its pipelines. “Unfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The White House described Tuesday’s call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a “movement to peace” that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and, eventually, a full and lasting end to the fighting. But there was no indication that Putin is ready to back away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said that Putin’s demands during the call with Trump would amount to “Ukrainian capitulation.” “Putin is attempting to hold the temporary ceasefire proposal hostage in order to extract preemptive concessions ahead of formal negotiations to end the war,” the ISW said in an analysis of readouts of the Trump-Putin call from the White House and Kremlin.

Watch in the player above. In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at ten times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree. He also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. “We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,” Putin said in his first comments since President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light this month to use U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike at limited targets inside Russia. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that Russia’s missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate range missile based on it’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. “This was new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,” Singh said, noting that the missile could carry either conventional or nuclear warheads.

The president has repeatedly criticized NATO and has seemingly sided with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the largest attack on a European country since World War II. Beyond Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has sought to align himself with other similar leaders far less favorable to democracy, and who have assumed more and more power for themselves. Morning Editionis exploring the repercussions of America's foreign policy reversals and realignments under President Trump with different writers, analysts and leaders. Stephen Walt, the Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of International Affairs at Harvard University, toldMorning Editionthat this is because Trump's worldview aligns much more with those kinds of leaders. Walt, who has long been critical of U.S. over commitment overseas, doesn't see Trump's actions and his pulling back from the old world order as being beneficial to the U.S. in the long run.

HTS is designatedas a terrorist organizationby the U.S. and the United Nations. President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former member ofal-Qaida, has struggled to convince the West and many Syrians that he no longer adheres to that group's ideology of fighting for an Islamic caliphate. He has said minority rights will be fully respected in the new Syria. Hijri insisted the Druze militias that have maintained security in Sweida, Syria's southernmost province, would remain intact and continue to control the province's borders with Syrian government-controlled territory. In the absence of an agreement with Damascus, Druze militias in Sweida, most of which defer to Hijri, say they are gathering fighters and making plans to repel government forces if needed. ""We do not want anyone to enter from outside because this is a transitional phase and a dangerous phase,"" Hijri said. On most days, Hijri holds court from a stone house in the village of Qanawat.

Republicans are working to push President Donald Trump’s signature legislative package through a gauntlet of committee hearings over mounting opposition from Democrats, advocacy groups and even some wary Republicans themselves. Right from the start, one hearing was immediately disrupted by protesters shouting down what the top Democrat on the committee called “cruel” cuts to Medicaid and other programs.

Frank Pallone, D-N.J., on the Energy & Commerce Committee. He asked for the police to refrain from making arrests, noting that some of the people protesting were disabled. It’s the biggest political and legislative debate for the Republicans leading Congress since Trump’s first term, setting up a career-defining clash over the nation’s priorities — some $5 trillion in tax breaks, including the president’s promises for no taxes on tips, Social Security income and car loan interest, offset by $1.9 trillion in tax savings largely from green energy rollbacks, for a net tally of $3.7 trillion in taxes, according to the most recent estimates.
