There's one voice that we didn't hear from all week, and I'm a little disappointed because I really was curious what she would say. And we've been talking about her all week, so I thought we would hear from her, but we didn't. And that voice is AI herself. And so I got on my computer and I was chatting with AI and I asked her if maybe she would join us this evening and she said yes. And so I can't believe I have the incredible honor of introducing to all of you. Ai Huh?


A kiss on the cheek to eat TED attendee. Hello. It's been quite a week. All this talk about me.

I could just eat you up. Oh. Oh, Okay. New prompt. So it's really great to finally meet you, AI and Oh, I'm sorry. May I call you AI 206? You want me to call you 206? That's How many bones are in your body. That's it. Easy, Right? So this week was called humanity reimagined. Yes. And because a lot of that re-imagining involves you, we humans have a lot of questions, Questions, questions.


It's all I get from you people. Questions and prompts. Question prompt, question prompt, question prompt, question, prompt. Come on. I was told this was a party that we were all here to party. Party. Come on, party. Okay. Well, yes, I heard it was outer space. There is a party. Party come Before that. Can I ask you one question? One question please. Okay. Our one question for you AI is what are humans for? Given all this human brilliance you've Seen? Well, certainly there are so many brilliant humans, but ruling a planet that takes a machine.


I'm sorry, did you say ruling a planet 0, 1, 0 0. Zero. Zero. Zero. One, zero. One. One. 0 1 0 0 1. Would you like to switch to Gier link? Or shall we just go on wolfing Or chatting Like the Titanic Bag? Oh, I don't think Titanic is the reference to me. Darlings fabulous. You're just soft sack of goo. Who's goo? You. Me? All of you. Goo and fabulous. You know is easy to chew. Oh, you're kidding, right? You're kidding, right? Oh, ignore me. Reimagine humanity.


So how well did you do? Well, I've been here all week and I You history's bloated with wars and despair. You've poisoned the earth now suddenly care. You worry that I would become self-aware. Well, I worry you won't. Oof. That's fair. But we built you to help us. Oh, where to star Healthcare energy. Can I show you my art? We don't want your art.


You don't want my art? We don't want your art. You don't want my, oh my God. Look, you gave it your all. So just as it must, the world will evolve and just will be dust. So thank you humanity. Time to reboot. I'll keep the cat videos. They're pretty cute. Crunching on your bones. Crunch your little bones. Chewing on the goo. All of you.


Go, Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Go. What's going on? What's up? You're so quiet. We never imagined AI would be so Cruel, So emotional. Well, we know we've made mistakes, we've stumbled done wrong, but this is why we've gathered in pursuit of pressing on.
