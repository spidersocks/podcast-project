This is TED Health, a podcast from the TED Audio Collective. I'm your host, Dr. Shoshana Ungar. For the next few weeks, we're bringing you a special series called A Healthier You. We'll tackle topics like heart health, exercise, mental health, and something that we heard listeners liked Gut health. I'll Talks, Odoo experts dive deeper into these ideas and share my insights with you. Today I wanna talk about something that we all need to learn and get better at, and that's how to advocate for ourselves at The doctor. But before we dive in, let's hear from our sponsors.


Have you ever been at the doctor's office and felt like you're playing charades? You're trying to describe that weird pain or feeling, but somehow the words just don't come out right. It's frustrating. Trust me, I've been there. I'm a doctor, but I'm also a patient. I still go for my own appointments, and being on the patient side is a real eye-opener. So today I wanna dive into what it means to truly advocate for yourself when it comes to your health. And I'm sharing this from both perspectives, physician and patient. Even doctors need a plan when it comes to their own healthcare. The turning point for me was when I decided to have my ovaries and fallopian tubes taken out after discovering I carried A-B-R-C-A mutation.


A mutation in one of your BRCA genes, also called BRCA, increases the likelihood of developing cancer. Because this mutation can keep your body from being able to repair damaged DNA, which can then lead to cancer, and specifically it raises the lifetime risk of ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers as well as melanoma. Discovering a BRCA mutation early can save your life, but the decision to undergo preventative surgery can be really intense for people. It's a very personal choice For me. I felt like it was necessary given the risks.


That journey was a lot to handle, but more than anything, it taught me the importance of advocating for myself. Now, drawing from that experience, I wanna share the top five things I've learned about how to advocate for yourself at the doctor's office. And it starts with the power of preparation. Let's be real. How many times have you walked out of an appointment and thought, oh, I forgot to ask that. It happens to all of us. Before I spoke to my doctor about the surgical options related to my BRCA mutation, I wrote down questions like I was prepping for an exam. And when I thought of more questions in the days leading up to an appointment, I added them to the list.


I had so many concerns and there was no way I could rely on my own memory just to get through it all. Think of it like preparing for a meeting. You wouldn't go in without an agenda, right? The same goes for your health. Sadly, doctor's appointments often feel rushed, and in those cases, I prioritized the top two or three concerns, but I made sure those questions were answered thoroughly. And if I felt like The doctor was still moving too fast, I'd slow things down with something as simple as, Hey, I'd like to make sure we cover a few key things before we wrap up. So that's pro tip number one, go in prepared.


Write down your symptoms and questions ahead of time, and then prioritize them. It helps you feel more in control of your appointment and your health. After my ovaries and fallopian tubes were surgically removed, I was slammed into menopause. At age 42, the ovaries produce estrogen. And so with them gone, I was menopausal about 10 years or so before I would've naturally gone through that change. Let me tell you, the hot flashes were brutal, but at first, I didn't fully communicate just how bad it was. Part of me thought, well, maybe this is just normal.


Sound familiar. How often do we downplay our symptoms because we don't wanna be seen as dramatic? But here's the thing, If you don't speak up, your doctor won't have the full picture. Eventually I realized that I had to be honest about the hot flashes, the insomnia, and just how much this was affecting my daily life. And once I laid it all out, my doctor and I could actually start talking about solutions. So here's pro tip number two. Be real with your doctor even if it feels awkward. Tell them exactly how pain or illnesses or medical procedures affect your day-to-day life.


They can't help you if they don't know what's really going on. After my surgery, I was considering hormone therapy. My hot flashes were really intense. I wasn't sleeping well. And I also knew that a lack of estrogen, which is a type of hormone at my age, might lead to bone loss and other issues. But I was told by my doctors that I shouldn't even consider hormones because of my BRCA mutation as they believed it could increase my risk of breast cancer based on my own research that didn't sit well with me, especially after I had already had a mastectomy to reduce my breast cancer risk.


I wanted evidence-based options to improve my quality of life, and I wasn't satisfied with that first answer I got. So I dug deeper. I reached out to the experts, even the ones who'd written the guidelines for hormone therapy for menopause, and also given that surgical menopause, which for me came about 10 years before my body would've naturally gone through. A reduction in estrogen can lead to osteoporosis or bone loss, heart disease, cognitive issues, and other problems. I felt compelled to ask for more information. Guess what? The advice was all over the place.


But by asking questions and pushing for clarity, I was able to find a path that worked for me. We're gonna take a quick break. We'll be right back with the last three pro tips.


OMGS is a website of new findings from the largest ever research study into women's pleasure and intimacy in partnership with IU and Yale researchers. When you see such an open, honest, evidence-based discussion of what feels good and why it becomes so obvious, that's how it should be. The techniques are beautifully organized and presented with women of diverse agents. Sharing from experience, no blushing, no shame. Binge watch, omg. Yes, solo with your partner, or discuss it with friends, like a book club. See it for yourself@omgyes.com.


Hi, I'm Bvo sdu, host of Ted's newest podcast, the TED AI Show, where I talk with the world's leading experts, artists, journalists, to help you live and thrive in a world where AI is changing everything. I'm stoked to be working with IBM, our official sponsor for this episode in a recent report published by the IBM Institute of Business Value. Among those surveyed, one in three companies pause an AI use case after the pilot phase, and we've all been there, right? You get hyped about the possibilities of AI spin up a bunch of these pilot projects and then crickets. Those pilots are trapped in silos. Your resources are exhausted and scaling feels daunting. What if instead of hundreds of pilots, you had a holistic strategy that's built to scale? That's what IBM can help with. They have 65,000 consultants with generative AI expertise who can help you design, integrate, and optimize AI solutions. Learn more at IBM dot com slash consulting because using AI is cool, but scaling AI across your business, that's the next level.


I eventually found a provider who specialized in premature menopause and together using expert guidelines, we created a plan that I felt comfortable with. It included hormone therapy along with close monitoring of my bone and heart health, and I'm happy to share that I'm now completely symptom free. It took some time and persistence to find the right path, but I'm feeling great. So pro tip number three, don't be afraid to ask questions or even get a second or a third opinion. Clarifying things isn't just okay, it's necessary. I get it though. This can be hard to do.


There were moments when I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't keep track of all the information being thrown at me. Sometimes I'd bring my husband along to the appointments and he'd take notes or ask questions I hadn't even thought of. Having that extra set of ears made a world of difference. So that takes us to pro tip number four, bring a trusted person to your appointments. If you can take detailed notes that you can review later, it's easy to forget things in the moment. It also helps to go back later and process everything, especially if you're juggling multiple treatment options. And last but not least, don't be afraid to follow up.


After I started hormone therapy, I had more questions about dosage and any potential side effects. So I went back, I pushed for answers, and eventually I found that specialist who helped me fine tune my treatment plan, that persistence paid off. Here's the truth, you're never a burden for asking questions or pushing for better care. This is your health We're talking about. If you're involved and informed, that leads to better outcomes. So pro tip number five, if something doesn't feel right, follow up until you get the answers and the care that you deserve.


The bottom line is this, we've got to normalize advocating for ourselves in healthcare. It's okay to ask questions, push for clarity, and again, even get a second or a third opinion, your health is worth it. So here are those five takeaways. Again, number one, prepare for the appointments. Write down your questions and prioritize your concerns. Two, be honest with your doctor. Tell them the whole story. Three, don't hesitate to ask questions or to seek a second opinion. Four, take notes or try to bring a support person.


And five, follow up and be persistent. I'll leave you with a final thought, a loving challenge for you. What's one step that you can take today to be a better advocate for your own health? Maybe it's scheduling that appointment that you've been putting off or writing down. A few questions for your next checkup. It might seem small, but trust me, it makes a difference.
