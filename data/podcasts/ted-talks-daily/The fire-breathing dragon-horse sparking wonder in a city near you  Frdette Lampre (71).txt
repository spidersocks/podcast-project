You are listening to TED Talks Daily where we bring you new ideas to spark your curiosity every day. I'm your host, Elise Hugh. The most influential puppets in my life are actually Muppets, you know, from Sesame Street or Kermit and Miss Picky and their whole Jim Henson puppet universe. They evoke all kinds of feelings and nostalgia childhood. In this talk artist and designer Fette Lam, who is part of the French Street Theater Collective LA machine reflects on what it means to create and build giant moving machines from fire, fire-breathing, sea dragons to slumbering mitas and why the kind of puppets she makes go way beyond entertainment.


They can help reshape how people see their cities and one another.

Imagine one day you are out for work in a city. You live or you visit and suddenly you came face to face with a giant miniature. He's half mile, half bull. His skin is made of wood. He's walking, galloping rearing up. He opens and clothes his blue eyes. He breathes, he cries, he grows. His arms, can stand off traffic lights, and now he's asleep in front of the city hall and people on their We work hear the creature snoring.


Amazing. As tall as building the city is a stage for him and people are immersed In his world. 30 years ago, my colleague Francois, a designer art performer funded LA Machine Company, his aim to create large theater experiences in cities. How with huge animated machines. Since then, Francois extraordinary machines appeared in streets, boulevards avenues all over the world. This machine have no practical function at all.


They tell stories for city and their citizen, and they bring all communities together to create perhaps a new common ground. In 2016, the French port of Cali commissioned us a permanent art project. Two years later, the sea wagon appeared on the beach. He has two giant red rings and a long blue tail, And he started his delightful pro around the historic streets of C spitting fire smoke coming out of his body.


The sea dragon is now the new image of the city. I could say that he belongs to the city and is loved by everyone. Thank you. LA Machine is based in north, a French city on Atlantic coast of France, and our workshop is in a former shipyard where we now build the great elephant, the giant spider, the dragon horse, the mini tour, the sea dragon and other. It's a permanent beehive with over 100 different trades and crafts involved in our staff.


We have welders, musicians, mechanics, comedians, sculptures, engineers, roboticists and so on. Perhaps you would like to know how we make it. First a drawing, then a model. The model is scanned to generate a digital wire frame. Then we made wood, orange shells for the skin of the animal, a metal structure for the skeleton, including hydraulic and electrical systems to bring the machine to life. Then the construction can begin.


The carpenters lead the way and other trades follow on. It takes around two years from the design to the completion, and then we are ready to operate a machine. An average of 18. Operators drive the machine with joystick and exoskeletons, one person per arm and per legs. One operator for the head, another one for the neck, one person for the wings, one person for special effects, one person for the tail, one pilot for the truck, one guide and a director of operation.


He's the sole of the machine. It gives technical but also emotional indications. All operators are connected to him with mics. To make a realistic movement, long ma, long mic means Dragon host in Chinese. Perhaps it's my favorite machines. Long Ma was commissioned by Beijing and then with this machine we perform in several cities in the world. In Ottawa, long Ma was joined by a giant spider that we settle on the roof of the Cathedral Ottawa, the administrative capital of Canada had a slogan at that time.


Ottawa is not boring, of course not 700,000 of people came to see Long Ma and discovered a giant spider. And my God, they love it. Death shows are free, no tickets, no fences. It makes the city creative and inclusive. For people experiencing a giant moving machine in their neighborhood, it can change the way they see their own city. LA Machine is not only about street performances, we also develop large scale spaces for ongoing moving exhibition.


In North, our home city we created Le Le is a cultural facility to support the urban regeneration program of the city to make not more attractive both for inhabitants and visitors. The cultural facility includes the great elephant who is walking every day on the old dog Esplanade, and next to it the carousel of the sea world, who is a living testimony to Jill Verne, who was born and grew up in North. Why this machine are so special.


The machine or movement, the machine are not just art, not just entertainment. They tell stories, but also they bring motion and emotions together in every person from spaces and times. Our machines are poetic figures and poetry has no business plan, but even as our show are free, that generates great benefits for shops, cafes, restaurants, and huge free media coverage for cities in Liverpool.


One day, a giant spider appeared magically on a building in front of the main train station. Hundreds of thousands of people discovered the new face of Liverpool and this image went around the world. Some cities with the machine wish to improve their image like Ottawa C or Liverpool. Others choose urban planning issues like not or Toul Lose. Toul Lose is in the south of France and we presented to the mayor of Tuus in 2013. The Ator Tuus is the home of Harris, like Seattle is the home for Boeing, and we presented to the leader of Aortics in Europe, an old and antique figure.


Crazy Tous is ancient city where myths and stories of bulls are central and the city is like a labyrinth, the mini to make the link between the past and the future. Last October, we create a new character, the Guardian of Darkness for the second part of the Tic Street Opera. The Guardian of Darkness is both a woman and a scorpion, and she is the alter ego of the miniature in LA machine. We don't really use artificial intelligence, but we definitely use artistic intelligence to reimagine humanity.

Hey, it's Paige from Giggly Squad. Real Talk. If there's one store that I absolutely love walking around, it's Sephora. It's my total guilty pleasure. They have amazing brands that other people don't have, and I find something great every time I walk in and there's literally one down the street from me. So I do that a lot. It's so fun to shop in the store and online and the products are just too good. No regrets ever. For example, one of my favorite beauty brands is Makeup by Mario, who just launched his new lip gloss that I absolutely love. So the next time you're in the market for Great Beauty Shop, all the hottest products and brands only at Sephora.
