Let's talk about the Republican National Convention. You invited the Rock the World Wrestling Federation Champion to speak at the Republican National Convention. In order to understand the way the Republican party works today, it's important to understand how the RNC works historically and how that has changed. That story is a story of the devolution of power from elites inside the Republican Party to broader swaths of the Republican primary electorate. That has come with some upsides and with some downsides.


The Republican National Committee was established in 1856, just two years after the formation of the Republican Party itself. The primary motivation behind its creation was to establish a formal organizational structure that could support the new party's electoral ambitions. Like all other party conventions, the RNC was designed to create a selection process for presidential candidates. The first RNC meeting took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, followed by a national convention in Philadelphia where John c Fremont was nominated as the first Republican presidential candidate. The vice presidential nominee was former New Jersey Senator William Dayton. The second place finisher was the somewhat obscure former representative from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln. From the beginning, the RNC was tasked with several key responsibilities developing and promoting the party's platform, coordinating fundraising efforts, strategizing for elections, organizing the national convention every four years.


Initially, the RNC served as a critical decision making body where party leaders and delegates from across the country would gather to debate and decide on key issues, including the nomination of presidential and vice presidential candidates. The 1860 convention in Chicago stands as a seminal moment in American history. Abraham Lincoln's nomination as the Republican candidate for president was not just a political decision. It was a moral stance against the expansion of slavery. This convention solidified the Republican party's commitment to abolition a position that would lead to Lincoln's presidency and the Civil War. Lincoln's election underscored the party's dedication to liberty and equality principles that would define the GOP for generations. The 1880 convention also held in Chicago showcased the party's ability to unite in the face of a division with no clear front runner.


The convention was marked by intense debate and political maneuvering. Ultimately, James a Garfield emerged as the compromise nominee. Garfield's nomination highlighted the G'S capacity to reconcile internal conflicts and presents United front a trait that would prove crucial in its future endeavors. Garfield won on the 36th ballot, Chester a Arthur was selected vice president as sort of an afterthought, a way of consolidating the party apparatus. When Garfield was assassinated, Arthur became president. The 1912 convention in Chicago is a quintessential example of a floor fight that dramatically reshaped the GOP incumbent. President William Howard Taft faced intense opposition from former President Theodore Roosevelt, who become disillusioned with Taft's policies. Roosevelt actually entered the convention with more primary victories and more delegates.


Taft, however, worked the newly ubiquitous phones in order to consolidate his own support. The convention chairman, Ali Hu Rud ended up disallowing many of Roosevelt's delegates. All of this chaos culminated in Roosevelt walking out and forming the progressive Bull Moose Party. This split in the Republican ranks led to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson, illustrating the profound impact of internal party strife. Moving forward to the 1940 convention in Philadelphia, America witnessed another unexpected twist. Wendell Wilkee, a businessman with no prior political experience, and a former Democrat emerged as the Republican nominee against all odds. Former Indiana Senator James Watson famously said of Wilkee, I don't mind the church converting a whore, but I don't like her To lead the choir. The first night initially considered a dark horse.


Wilkes candidacy gained momentum through a groundswell of support from delegates to satisfied with the leading contenders. His nomination was a testament to the unpredictable nature of political conventions and the power of a compelling outsider narrative. We'll get to more on this in a moment.

In 1952, television became a factor at the RNC, despite the fact that Senator Robert Taft had by far captured the most delegates 500 of the available 604. Entering the convention, Dwight d Eisenhower's team played a brilliant media hand claiming the powers that be were stopping Eisenhower's candidacy with backroom deals. All of this caused a clamor across the country, a clamor sufficient to elevate Eisenhower to the nomination and to the presidency. The 1964 Republican Convention in San Francisco was yet another pivotal moment characterized by ideological clashes and powerful rhetoric. Barry Goldwater's nomination marked a significant shift toward conservatism within the GOP Goldwater's. Victories in the primaries represented a rejection of the Republican status quo.


His acceptance speech with his famous line extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue galvanized the conservative base and set the stage for the future direction of the party. Despite losing the general election, Goldwater's influence would echo in the rise of Ronald Reagan. After 1968, the convention process shifted for both the Democrats and the Republicans. Thanks to the open warfare in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention of 68. Both parties embraced the primaries as the chief mechanism for selecting their nominees to avoid floor fights as historians. Heavy Troy says, if a candidate could secure a majority of delegates before the convention and clinch the nomination, he would enter the convention as the presumptive nominee, and his forces would run all aspects of the convention, including the staging, speaker selection, and platform committee.


The idea is to have as smooth and as confrontation, free a convention as possible. Perhaps the last gasp of the old convention logic manifested for a brief moment with the 2016 Republican National Convention stunned by Donald Trump's march through the primaries, some members of the Republican caucus tried to lead a floor fight to deny Trump the convention and elevate another alternative. That move failed dramatically. Of course, Trump then proceeded to win the presidency, consolidating the Republican base in here to for unprecedented ways. While the advent of modern primaries and caucuses has shifted much of the decision making power away from the convention floor and directly into the hands of voters throughout the primary season, the convention remains an essential event for the Republican party. It fulfills several vital functions. First, it nominates candidates.


The primary purpose of the convention is to officially nominate the party's candidates for president and vice President. Delegates from each state and territory cast their votes based on the outcomes of primaries and caucuses held earlier in the year. This formal nomination process is crucial for solidifying the party's ticket and setting the stage for the general election campaign. Second adoption of the party platform. Another critical function of the convention is the adoption of a party platform. This document outlines the party's positions on key issues and serves as a guide for its policy priorities. The platform is crafted by a committee. It's then debated and ratified by the delegates during the convention. This process ensures the party's official stands, reflects the collective views of the members. Third party unity and mobilization. The convention is also a vital opportunity for the party to unify after a potentially divisive primary season.


It's a time for healing rifts, rallying the base, and energizing supporters. High profile speeches, including those by the presidential and vice presidential nominees, are designed to inspire and mobilize the party faithful. These speeches often serve as the unofficial kickoff of the general election campaign in the contemporary era, the RNC has become a highly orchestrated media event designed to maximize positive coverage and public engagement. Advances in technology, changes in media consumption have transformed the way conventions are conducted and perceived. Today's conventions feature, elaborate stage design, high profile entertainment, carefully scripted speeches aimed at presenting the party and its candidates in the best possible light. Social media now plays a significant role in amplifying the convention's message and reaching a broader audience.


Still, the fundamental purposes of the convention remain the same. To nominate candidates, adopt a platform and unify the party. The Republican National Convention continues to be a pivotal moment in the election cycle, setting the tone for the general election, and mobilizing the party's base for the final push toward victory.
