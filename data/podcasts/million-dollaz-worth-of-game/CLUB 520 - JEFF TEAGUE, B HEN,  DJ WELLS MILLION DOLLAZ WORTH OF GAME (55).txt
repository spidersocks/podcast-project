Like but you gonna play and when you do this what you need to do to play. Right. So that's why I always had so much love for Bivy and then like he just took care of me like every time. Like Bivy had the same, he'd been with his girl for years. He had kids so he'd bring his kids to the gym but he started treating me like a little brother. Yeah. So he'd be like, now I know you ain't got that much money. So we go on the road, I ate with Bivy every day. So we, he always wanted to go Cheesecake Factory.

6 (1h 5m 36s):
I do. I nah, we just had barbershop talk though bro. It is then that we never like knew it was gonna take off. I mean he kind, Jeff kind of knew like, man, I think we got something there. Yo dude got something because it just blew outta the world. 'cause we got something different than everybody else in the sports world. And, and it's like I tell you like for people, for me to see, you know, 'cause I feel as though like I thought I was like a, a sports guy but I really wasn't. 'cause there's a lot I didn't see 'cause I, I was really back in the NBA back in like 90 back when Charles Barkley and them was playing for Phoenix, Dan Marley, Kevin Johnson, all that. I'm showing Kemp, boy I'm back in the day. NB You old. No I'm just saying I watched it back. I been, I was outta the loop. So when he be talking about yeah, whatever.

6 (1h 6m 18s):

Like you, you be like man he lying. Ain't nobody sucker punch the boy and Drew. Yeah, Jeff would tell a story, they'd be farfetched you and then you'll see the clip. He was like, yeah well, well yeah. You know because what happened is he said dude, he told him, fuck you dude's here, fuck you back. He sucker punched him and I seen that he was aggressive. So I act like I ain't see it 'cause ain ain't wanna help my teammate like Jeff be saying so why? And then be like, you see Jeff going to the bench. He's like okay. So Jeff really was bitching.

10 (1h 6m 55s):

10 (1h 11m 37s):
Yeah but just hooping KD and nobody in the league really just better than KD when it just come to pure hooping. Yeah, facts extend. Do everything

0 (1h 11m 45s):
KD or LeBron.

LeBron a better player. Yeah, but if you just went to a park and you said let's play basketball, you'll probably pick kd,

0 (1h 11m 53s):
LeBron or Kobe?

10 (1h 11m 55s):
LeBron.

6 (1h 12m 1s):
Yeah I might. I'm not

10 (1h 13m 2s):
Taller than you at

0 (1h 13m 2s):
10. He, no,

6 (1h 13m 8s):
I'm taking bro, his longevity bro. Came to the league averaging 20 is 23 years in. He's still averaging 20. Nobody ever did that. He had 23 years in the game. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody ever did that. And he had a higher salary every, I think everybody got about that time. Don. He might,

He

6 (1h 13m 21s):
Had broke event. Vince Carter record.

0 (1h 13m 23s):
Why you say Mike?

10 (1h 13m 25s):
Just 'cause how much he dominated his era and then he made the game where we wanted to be. Like everybody wanted to be like Mike, I ain't never really heard nobody say they want to be like LeBron.

6 (1h 13m 35s):
I ain't mad at that.

10 (1h 13m 36s):
You know what I mean? That's the only reason. But I think LeBron is the most dominant player ever. Yeah. I think he more dominant than Shaq. No

0 (1h 13m 44s):
The fuck outta here bro. What? You can't Come on bro. I'd say LeBron James is a better player than Shaq. Yeah. All around more dominant. Don't you ever ring your nigga Shaq. You couldn't s it was impossible bro. Shaq was having 49 and 27 rebounds. Bro. You're supposed to win championships when a motherfucker got there. How did, who else grabbed the fucking rebound tonight?

10 (1h 14m 7s):
Nah, I I I know Shaq was dominant. Nah, I hear you know Shaq, I think Shaq is the best center ever. Shaq

You playing Gil with the left hand today? That's crazy. Shut up man.

11 (1h 14m 40s):
Fuck crazy. Not Brian but like Brian.

10 (1h 14m 44s):

Look at that's hard to do in the NBA. You can't on that bro. 2010 is being

0 (1h 23m 54s):
A good player. 10 and being a killer is totally different bro. With the game on the line you ain't like give it to Carlos,

6 (1h 24m 4s):
You can kill in different ways. If a average 20 and 10, if you average 20 and 10 in college you was a killer. What is you talking about? The word killer in the NBA

0 (1h 24m 14s):
Kevin Duran is a killer man. Steph Curry is a killer man. Luca DCI is a killer man. Hey don't

10 (1h 24m 22s):
Is this killers too. It's just the opportunity like how

6 (1h 24m 24s):
Luca a killer and they they losing Lakers not playing. They they losing. I'm just saying I dunno nothing about black

11 (1h 24m 30s):
Anthony Evers is a killer.

6 (1h 24m 32s):
No, no because no, no let just say this. What I'm lemme just say this. Lemme just say this 'cause 'cause

11 (1h 24m 37s):
I wouldn't say because Dante Dijo was a killer.

6 (1h 24m 40s):
Dante we loved D three.

11 (1h 24m 43s):
No he a baller

6 (1h 24m 46s):
But him and Carlos Boozer is two totally different people. Can I say this? Can I say something?

11 (1h 24m 50s):
I'm not saying.

6 (1h 24m 53s):
The

11 (1h 24m 54s):
Saying was a

6 (1h 24m 56s):
He averaging 20 and 10. You hating. I'm not hating bro. My mama you hating. I ain saying

11 (1h 25m 1s):
The killer though dog.

10 (1h 25m 2s):
I know what you're talking about.

11 (1h 25m 3s):
Killer is killer talking about man Ricky Davis from Cleveland average 20 points

6 (1h 25m 8s):

6 (1h 25m 11s):
Average. I ain.

11 (1h 25m 13s):
Killer this.

6 (1h 25m 16s):
You better put a different definition on that shit. You like something that I said right? Yeah and I wanna say this, I really only listen is listen the Celtics, we won a chip last year.

10 (1h 25m 24s):
Okay I'm with that

6 (1h 25m 25s):
One of the reasons they is my team because when I was a kid, Larry Bird hit a three pointed to me, I was in six, I was inspection. Right. But this is what I wanna know. That's why that's my team. But this is what I wanna know. I'll be looking at all this hype on the sport. I just know Luca, I never seen him play. I just seen that he went to from Dallas and went to a ney and it was all his hype. But they over there getting barbecued by ant man and them. So what the fuck did it really matter? I mean he coulda stayed where he was at.

0 (1h 25m 54s):
Yeah

10 (1h 25m 54s):
Man. I mean they coulda picked me up. They traded him for the future though. Like what

6 (1h 25m 58s):
The future man, fuck the future man. You gotta win this year. Philly been talking about the future for what's the process. How long is the process? I'm just saying I don't know

10 (1h 26m 8s):
Over with now.

6 (1h 26m 10s):
I mean back when I had a ball game I stepped on that. That that court. You said the field. I stepped on that court to destroy the day I wasn't talking about the playground. I went there to be the king today. Not tomorrow. Let give a breakdown of the basketball world though though. Breakdown Like tell me about like how they do the

10 (1h 26m 25s):
Future. They trade him because obviously they traded Luca 'cause he 26 years old. He gonna be the future of the franchise when LeBron leave. So that was an easy trade. But

6 (1h 26m 32s):
Alright. If they could put the out because they, if they get put out 'cause it,

10 (1h 26m 37s):
They don't care.

6 (1h 26m 38s):
They don't care. Nah,

10 (1h 26m 39s):
I mean you want win but they don't care. They got Luca

6 (1h 26m 42s):
Who gonna win the chip. Who winning the chip?

10 (1h 26m 44s):
Boston?

6 (1h 26m 45s):
My team. That's all.

0 (1h 26m 46s):
She gillis. Alexander, OOKC. Listen who, who you got traded for

10 (1h 26m 52s):

6 (1h 30m 9s):
Whatever but everybody play for different reasons.

0 (1h 30m 10s):
Yeah but he No but Pat could say shit too though.

They gonna shoot jumpers and do their thing. I'm gonna play old school, I'm gonna go And that's why to be honest people don't wanna play Pat Bev 'cause they like he gonna do that strong bump him and do all that shit.
