You live here in New York City. Indictment. Playground. Listen. Yes. Let me tell you something very important.


I don't care what nobody say. I'm sitting here with a mega sports agent. He already told me on the side, he's going get Gil a three and a half day contract with one of these NBA teams. I don't know which one. And you said I could be, I could be able to get on the, I get in the locker room some type of way. I just wanna get on the team. Like what can I kind of be the towel boy water boy, I just need to get in the game. I'm gonna elevate you. What, where I'm gonna be? Yeah. I be the front office. Front office. I like that. Yeah. Hit the marketing, hit the marketing vice president of marketing one of these teams. No, You going, you going, you gonna be the director of culture. I like that. Well, don't worry about Gil. Just get me in that joint. See, we ain't gotta worry about Gil, hold up that train. Right. We really outside right now. You see the train going and it is a possibility I might activate my game.


Well, Hold on. Nah, we're not about to do that. I'm gonna activate my game. He told you he was gonna be the director of culture. That ain't even no job. No. We gotta create the jobs, Gil. We create the jobs 'cause we control. Cool. We, I they can't direct culture. We got to, All right. So, you know what I'm saying? But listen, We've always been taught to do everything accessible. The only issue, and again, you shouldn't go broke buying clothes, but again, depending on what your infrastructure is, like Oh, who's teaching them to go the other way? Well the, Well the bigger problem with that is the guy next to the guy, you gotta decide if you want the credit. Right? Because if you want the credit, then what type of credit you want?


You want, you want to be responsible for putting the team together or you want to be responsible for doing the work that you lack the capabilities of doing. Hmm. Two roads you can go down. You understand what I'm saying? I'm, I'm gonna repeat that. Say it again For now. You Could be responsible for putting the team of people together that does everything that, you know, you cannot do. Or you could pretend to be able to do all these different things and it's Impossible infrastructure. But this is what, this is what you do Doing. You need the infrastructure. This, because you know what I deal with? I be in situations where a person's feel like, man, if, if, if my guy worked with them and I I'm standing next to Rich, I'm not gonna get the credit, he's gonna get the credit.


Oh, Okay. So because of that, I'd rather go over here where this person is not. And, and the, the companies that that we are and I'm competing against on the daily, do you know they use this, they use the go against you? Yes. They tell guys don't go and work at Clut, don't go and work with Rich because you can be rich and you're not going to Divide and conquer. And they eating this up. It's happened. It happens repeatedly all the time. And that's just me. I don't know what happens elsewhere, but I know what happens. It comes back to me and I'm saying to myself, man, we got so far to go.

I mean because I am human, but I see feel people like, it's like there's some artists that people will see as a protagonist. And there there's some artists that no matter what, it's like a villain. I feel like they always see me as a villain. So it's Like I can't even say certain things that I want to say. So it's just like, ah, man, whatever.

I'm gonna say what I gotta say right back baby, I ain't running from no smoke, you know, so. Yeah. But in real life, like bro that talking About now, nah, that's not that.

Let me, let me, let me speak on the fact I went back in on the song and changed something on the second verse and bitch won't smoke. I'm gonna give a smoke. But, but, but the song was already done.

Like w Well Pen right? I'm just saying, I'm talking about, I'm just, you talking about smoking the Blunt. I didn't know what you was talking about. You know I'm a little slow. What you Pass me the blunt? Mm Mm He slow. Slow. Okay. He got, he he got a G prison. I got it for her times too.


She be talking about hookah smoke. I don't know. Lemme ask you a question. Ask about hookah Too. Come on Pastor Hookah, What do it take for a person to shoot a film? A clean film? It ain't not, not your film. The shoot a clean film that's, that's Don't shoot a film. Shoot a series a film requires a star. Okay, we gotta make the money back in three weekends. We need 30 seconds. We only got 30 seconds to make People wanna watch it The first 30 Seconds, the 32nd trail of the day put out a minute and 30 seconds. We got one minute 30 seconds to make. Everybody wanna watch this so they gotta see somebody and go, oh okay. Yeah cool. I want to, I wanna check that out.


If you make the series, we watch the scene go nah, this shit is good. We've seen some series catch traction on YouTube. Different things that make the series bro. It doesn't require stars. It requires talent Series. When people are authentic, they could be playing a character that they can play because they notice they know this behavior. Yeah. And the one thing I said, you made stars. That's it. They didn't know. Look bro, I was going, what is wrong with these people? They was acting Like I said you number one in African, I've been number one African American Latino households for 10 years.


Multiple shows. I talked to Tyler about it. I watched, he's still putting up number one, number one, number one, number one. Damn. He'll send it to me in advance. I said for your eyes only. Don't even show nobody still got more, still got more. He got more outta shit. And you see me start doing things since we got here, I didn't even mention the 50 CENT action. My channel, it'll come. I got 18 hours of premium content that I'm gonna run through there. So you go, is This gonna be like Netflix Or somewhere like it's gonna be 1800 hours. It's free television. It's called 50 CENT action. It's ad driven.


So there's no fee for you to have that app on your television. So I can just, I can just download, just click like Netflix is downloaded onto your TV and it's free And you got the ad, the ad revenue is paying for everything. Power. Everything's there. So, so being the fact that I could, I could count like at least four stars you done made from from TV series. But then when you sit back and you see like ghosts, Amari Hardwick say I ain't get paid what I was supposed to get paid. And how that make you feel. Yeah. Look, look he make, he doesn't mean that to me. Yeah, right. He'll send a DM y'all.


I didn't mean for that to come out like the damn turning it around into something else and I go, but That It still is what it is. They're still saying what they're saying. Right, right. At the end of the day, ghosts was supposed to die where I died. Oh, you extended it? I extended it. Yeah. I told her she was planning to kill him. Seed. When people have success for the first time, sometimes they need it to be their own. The problem with working with 50 CENT, it's it's 50 CENT show the writers, multiple writers in the room, real talented Bro.


Building this, putting it together. There's no one, no one person responsible for a hit TV show. It's multiple people having a moment. The actors are bringing the characters to life. The writers are making the it is coming together. Right. And it all comes with the writers. Right. But it starts, we Ain't got nothing. Don't matter. So how many writers you have in the room? 11. 11 writers. That's the difference. Because all you recognize is a showrunner. You only looking at the showrunner was 11 people responsible for what you just said. Right. So you look and go when, when I'm there it gets uncomfortable at points. When it goes on for a long time.


A lot of success. And it keeps saying 50 CENT, 50 CENT, 57, 50 Cent. They gotta be comfortable with It. The 1.5 million P per views baby. Yes. Let's do it. Not bad.

You know what I'm saying? And I said this before, he fought Triple G, he fought Floyd, he fought Bvo, he fought bigger guys. But what I know is that is this, there's nothing physical about this fight. You know what I'm saying? It's all this, it's mental, it's the intelligence and that's what's gonna make the difference.


You know what I'm saying? It's not everybody keeps saying about the power, about all you big, you strong, it's cool. He's powerful. He's strong too. He could punch too, you know what I'm saying? But it is about the mentality, the iq and that's just all, all it is for September 14th, People went different ways. You went what Oscar? People went the another way. PBC way. PBC way.

And at that moment right there, I knew, I was like, bro, like if I can run track because I ain't even practice track in high school.


For real bro. I just went out there and just did your thing. Took clothes off and did my thing man. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Shout out to my coach, coach Hill man. Not him, not my dad though, but Coach Hill, he was a legendary coach for me. But yeah man. And that moment right there from running track running to ten one nine from being a senior in high school, traveling all the way to Barcelona, Spain competing for the country as a senior in high school. I, I knew I had it then, bro. But not but But you was doing all that in track? I was Doing all that in track, not football. But you knew you had It in football. I knew I had it in football bro because Like I was the best dude in my region. I was, I really the best dude in the state, bro. Yeah. I was killing. Yeah. But it was like, how do I get eyes on me and every time like, so our quarterback with six six was going to Louisville.


Yeah. But the Louisville people that they'd come and see me, they'll be like, nah bro, you too low bro. Too small. You too low bro. You ain't, you ain't got it bro. You can't play receiver, you can't play running back bro. We don't need you bro. Yeah. You feel me? So I was like, y'all got me bro. Like I'm making this dude look good bro. Right. He just throwing the ball deep to me like right. You feel me man, I went, I took a chance, I went to Juco. I said man, I ain't going D one man. I ain't wanna go to them. I ain't wanna run track. I wanna go to Juco. So that's how I ended up at Juco. And what Juco you went to? I Went to Garden City Community College in Kansas. Ain't nothing out there. It looked just like this. Is that how Kansas City found out about you? Yeah, I believe so. I really believe so.


You feel me? You Think that was the best decision you made? Yeah, man, I don or To the Juco outta my whole entire life. I would say that would probably be the best decision I ever made, man. Like I stuck to my gut and I stuck to my intuition and my faith man. 'cause obviously I could've went and ran track. I could've did some great things on the track and field, but my, my heart and my background and what my family taught me is football. I've always played football. I ain't started running track till like 11th, 12th grade year, man. Yeah. And I was just good at track. Yeah. He was just fast naturally. He was Just fast, just naturally fast. I'm, I'm about to run like a straight hood baby. Just Yeah. Yeah. He has no form but he runs a ten one. How does he do that? Like how does he do that? His kids out there practicing their whole life for This.


Like they, they got the perfect four. They got the perfect four. They like this. Oh. After you come up out the block, the three steps, you get straight. They used to run track too. They doing all that. He Like this. I'm talking About right before the race. They like, where's lane number four? I just walk up outta nowhere and just take my shorts off and run a ten one. They're like, yep, that's the kid from Georgia. Yeah. Was it ever a time, you know, with the ups and downs that goes on in the league that you, that you felt yourself breaking down and you was like, you wasn't sure of yourself? Was it ever a moment? Nah man, like my grandparents always told me to be appreciative and grateful for everything that you in man and adversity. It's gonna come in life man. And it's all about how you deal with it.


You feel me? The adversity I went through, whether it's off the field or on the field in the locker room, like I've learned from that. Like if it's on the field, I try to do my best to learn from the older guys in the locker room. Ask them questions and say, Hey man, how do you think I can get better from this? And some older guys that, that help you out. Some some guys are like, nah gang, like you just here to try to take my spot. I'm not trying to help you out man. 'cause you could be replacing me next year. You, you know what I'm saying? But adversity, I feel like it, it comes and goes man. It's all about how you deal with it. And then you gotta have a strong mental to be able to deal with all that too though. If, if, if you're not strong enough mentally to be able to, to deal with the ups and downs of the league, it'll break you.


It'll break you man from the fans, from from the meeting room with the coaches calling you out in front of other guys because a lot of guys aren't used to that. A lot of guys aren't used to sitting inside of a meeting room being the best player on their team their whole entire life. And then a coach saying, bro, you suck this player bro. You ever had, you ever had somebody say to these, oh yeah, this year Miami Dolphins, you know what I'm saying? Like the play against Snead, the player, the the chief, everybody see this play against cheese with one to the floor. He called me out, he like, re bro, you supposed to be the best player in the league and you got this guy putting hands all over you like that. It's man, we pay you all this money. For what? And for me, I, I love that because I'm gonna take that to heart and I'm gonna, and I'm gonna get better from it.


That'll never happened again to me in my life, man. You feel me? If a mother not hold me accountable, I feel like I'm not, I'm not gonna be able to get better. You know what I'm saying? Like obviously the coaches can bypass that, you know what I'm saying? And just be like, ah, he'll get better from it. But if he not saying nothing like the other guys, the other guys in the locker room, they gonna look at it as, oh, if re can do it, I can do it. And that's not getting the team better. I need the whole, I need everybody to get better, bro. You know what I'm saying? Baby brother waddle, I, I got him up under my wing trying to teach him. I'm like, bro, he adult. I want everybody to get paid, bro. He a dog too. Everybody deserve it bro. You feel me?
