Hi, I am Josh Menowitz with a preview of Dateline Missing in America. In our podcast's fourth season, we share six new unsolved mysteries and we hope someone listening may have a clue that could help crack one of these cases. Could that someone be you? Here's Dateline Missing in America. The picture of New Jersey that most people hold in their minds is so different from this one that considered beside it. The Pine Barrens, as they're called, become as incongruous as they are. Beautiful. That's the writer John McPhee talking about the Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey. The Garden State has one of the highest population densities in the US, but across a million dense acres. Whole swaths of the pine Barrens are as empty as the days before there was a New Jersey or an old Jersey. If you want to get lost, this is the place, and if you want someone else to vanish, this is the place easy to disappear and easy to get lost in A lot of weird stories down there. On the evening of April 13th, 2000, 24, 30 7-year-old Danielle Lopez evaporated into these thick woods. No call, no text, no goodbye, and almost no trace. The not knowing is the hardest Part. What happened to Danielle? Where did she go? Those are questions. Her loved ones ask themselves daily, and they're praying you may have some answers. That's my hopes that somebody will recall or remember or go through or know something that will prompt or that somebody's hearts convicted to just do the right thing. Danielle's mom, Sue Quackenbush has been shattered by the disappearance of her daughter. This isn't her loss. This isn't her having some mental break. This is something that happened to her at the hands of somebody else. Absolutely. Thanks for listening.
