Hi, I am Josh Menowitz with a preview of Dateline Missing in America. In our podcast's fourth season, we share six new unsolved mysteries and we hope someone listening may have a clue that could help crack one of these cases. Could that someone be you? Here's Dateline Missing in America. Tucked into the rolling hills and valleys of Middle Tennessee. Is Sparta a rural community where neighbors aren't strangers and many who live here see each other every week at church for almost a decade at the Deit Church of Christ gospel music and the sermons of Pastor Roy Whited had made the Sunday morning service soar. He was a good preacher. You know, he had the way with the word Doug Watts says Roy is the reason he started going to church again more than 20 years after he'd quit. I told him he did it and he said, no. God done it. Yeah, I said He did it through you. You know, and that's, I believe that In the first week of May, 2024, something happened in Sparta that seemed almost impossible to believe. That's when 64 year old Roy Whited vanished. He's just gone like a puff of smoke, isn't he? Yes sir. It's just unbelievable. For White County Sheriff Steve Page. Roy's case is personal. I mean, Roy are friends. The sheriff is as baffled as anyone else wondering how anyone, as recognizable as Roy could disappear in plain sight. I would dare to say 95% of the people in this county knew Roy Whited, or maybe even a hundred percent. It is a mystery that has forced Roy's closest friends and family into the fellowship of the missing. It's a group. No one chooses to join. Certainly not Roy's brother Lynn Whitehead. I pray, I pray. I pray that he is somewhere and we will find him because otherwise I, I have to think the worst. Thanks for listening.
