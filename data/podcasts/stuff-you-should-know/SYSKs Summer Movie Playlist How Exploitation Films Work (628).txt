Frankly, I am a little excited. Chuck, I'm a little giddy. Shut your mouth. That's, yeah. Okay. Sure. Alright. This is, this is our first ever movie centric podcast. Right. Movie centric for sure. Yeah. We've mentioned movies of course all the time, but this one is like, yeah.


This Is all about movies. Yeah. So this is by, by popular request to an extent. People wanna see, like want they, they want to hear us talk about movies and just do a movie podcast. So we decided to focus on exploitation films. That's right. This is also probably the first podcast that we're gonna say, If you are a teacher of children in eighth grade or younger and you're using this as a teaching tool, you might want to go to the one before this or the one after. Yeah. We don't generally try to alienate audiences. We're not attempting to now, it's just a natural byproduct of the exploitation film. Can't talk about exploitation films without talking about some lurid subject matter. Yeah.


You can't say exploitation without ploit. Yeah. They weren't exploiting just people being nice. Right. Nice exploitation. So Chuck, I went and saw a movie the other day called I Saw The Devil. It's a Korean movie. It's by the guy who did A Tale of Two Sisters, I think. Oh, You said More Violent than Old Boy. Yeah. The, the Guy Old Boy is one of the main characters. And I've seen Old Boy, I've seen I too, what's the other one he did? The Vampire movie. Yeah. Thirst. Something that I didn't see That one. Think it's pretty good. It was Okay. This one is, it's the most violent thing I've ever seen seen in my life. It's the most graphically violent movie I've ever seen in my life.


The only, the only reason it like I was able to complete is 'cause I'm like, this is, it's a movie I, I I know, right. But I walked out of it like, it's so over the top. It's so gory. Right. It's clearly an exploitation film. Yeah. Alive and well. Yeah. But the problem is, is like, really If you start to look around John Hughes films technically are exploitation films. The Breakfast Club is technically an exploitation film. Yeah. The, there was a big wave of teen exploitation films, and we'll get to that. But yeah, you're right. So one of the broader definitions of exploitation films is basically anything that's really like over the top, that is beyond reality. Or that maybe focuses on people's fears, their, their sexuality.


Yeah. And basically just kind of serves it up in a larger than life manner. That's one way of looking at exploitation films. Yeah. You're basically, they're exploiting some of the seedier aspects of humanity most times. Sure. Like murder or sex, like weird sex, that kind of thing. Yeah, exactly. Sex, drugs, weird sex Teenagers rebelling against parents. Sure. That Kind of thing. Like weird science. Have you ever been to a party where a couch shot out of the chimney and into the pond? I mean, it's a pretty nice party. I don't think it's ever really happened. You know? Yeah. So that's the vast definition of exploitation. But you and I are kind of qualified to teach a cinema class at like maybe a, a low level community college Yeah.


At this point, after the amount of research we've done in this. Sure. And we found that academically there's a, there's a much more distinct definition for exploitation. And it's seemingly interchangeable term grindhouse. Right? Yeah. What's The, is there a definition? Definition? It's, it's more like a timeframe. Okay. So from like 1919 when they really first started making movies to I think 19 60, 19 59, when the Hayes Act went away. Yeah. Well that was exploitation. And then after that it was, it became Grindhouse. Okay. Gotcha. It's my understanding. Okay. So let's do this. All right. Well, that's the old joke.


Was that in, in the awesome documentary, American Grindhouse, which documents this, this era of filmmaking. Yeah. The old joke, one of the guys says is that exploitation films began five minutes after the camera was invented. Yeah. The motion picture camera, Because the guy was like, the director was like to his girlfriend. Hey, would you mind taking your clothes off of the camera? Exactly. Yeah. So it, it says something about the human condition that you invent the film camera. And the first moving images were often lured Edison's film. It showed clips of like decapitations and violence and guys fighting Yeah. And naked women as film tests. So it's just, that says a lot about people like, all right, now we know how to capture things, so let's capture sex and violence.


Right. First. Right. And although that really kind of jived with public taste, or at least public fascination, it didn't jive with the prevailing standards, the agreed upon standards. Right. Right. I think you said 1919, but the first exploitation film was 1913. Oh, okay. Traffic in Souls or while New York sleeps. Right. And that, like you said, exploitation often plays into fears that played into the fear at the time of the white slave trade. Right. Budget of 57 grand in gross $450,000. Which 1913. That's a lot of dough. That is a ton of dough.


And that was Universal Pictures. And they went, Hey, got onto something here Right after that was released, the Hayes code, will Hayes was the Postmaster general and a Presbyterian elder. And he was making a hundred grand a year During the depression. That's Unbelievable. Right. He, he basically said like, look, we need, we need to apply some moral standards to filmmaking. Right. There's decapitation, there's naked breasts, there's, there's white, white slavery. Like we need to, we need to pure this up. Right. Well, actually there, there wasn't nudity yet, like those early test films. There were, but nudity, we'll get to that later. Okay.


But yes, that's what Hayes tried to do. And like Prohibition didn't exactly Quell drinking. The Hayes code actually sort of gave rise to the exploitation movement. Yeah. It's just like, just like prohibition, just like marijuana prohibition, just like, well, any drug prohibition, anytime you say you can't do this, you can't have something that you want the somebody else is going to operate in a black market, a black market's gonna spring up simple economics. Yeah. And that's exactly what happened. And that's where Exploitation cinema came up. It's like, you can't get this from Hollywood. 'cause Hollywood has to play by the rules. But my production studio is my model T and let's go make this movie, gimme some money.


I'm going to film a child being born close up and put it in the movies. Yes. And you can do that. You can make your movies all day long, but if they're never exhibited, then what good are you doing? Or not? Like they were trying to do some good, but you're not making any scratch. So the 40 Thieves Yeah. They talk about in the, in the documentary were these filmmakers and exhibitors basically that traveled around like carnies setting up these sort of gorilla film screenings and some places sort of out of the way where they can't get caught. And that was for the first time, you know, they were taking films outside of the mainstream. Yeah.


Different, sometimes they weren't even theaters. They would show men like VFW Halls and If you want to go see Birth of a Baby Films, apparently they were popular. Yeah. That was a whole genre, early genre of exploitation. Well, And so was early on a lot of the film centered around like, how to wear a condom Yeah. These sex hygiene films. Yeah. Because there was no information about that out there. And so exploitation filmmakers, whether Disingenuously or genuinely were presenting their stuff, like, this is a public service, people need to know this. Right. And, and making movies about it. But it also, and people were going on that excuse as well, like, well, I need to, I need to know about this.


But at the same time, it's like, I wanna see this, the, the craziest thing I'll ever see in my life. Exactly. You know, on screen. Or they argued a lot of times that they were cautionary tales. If they were about drugs or violence, they would say, Hey, this could happen to you. Yeah. So you should educate yourself. But what they really wanna do is get their movie scene And make some money. Exactly. Paramount decision of 1948, this is pretty big. The Supreme Court voted that movie studios could no longer own their own movie theaters at the time. You know, there would be like the Paramount Theater in Hollywood from the Paramount film production company. Right. They would show their movies. Right. Supreme Court said no more. And all of a sudden exploitation films became a little bit more legit.


'cause the haze code kind of fell apart. Yeah. And this is post World War ii. So People had seen a lot of death recently, Well, a lot of death. And then grown Up a little more. They thought ladies in suggestive roles were good for morale. And there was a, a little bit of loosening on the sex thing a little bit post World War ii enough. And that led to another sub-genre of exploitation film, the nudist colony film. Yeah. Which were, which were pawned off as documentaries a lot. Well, most of these were pawned off as docu documentaries, which legitimized them. But really it was maybe, maybe it actually was filmed at ANU camp. Probably not.


Right. Mostly they were actors and actresses just engaged in archery, naked or long walks naked. And there Could be no sex still that was still no taboo, But it was just like naked pretty people. Right. At, at a nudist colony. Which is interesting because you're not a nudist, so come learn about them. Exactly. Yeah. After that, through the history we had things like the teen, like you said, the Teen rebellion of the fifties with the Rebel Without a Cause, and Blackboard Jungle, and movies like that, all of a sudden were targeted specifically at teens, which was new. And then drive-in theaters were built so teenagers could see movies where their parents weren't gonna be, apparently the adults didn't go to drive-ins a lot at first.


Oh yeah. It was all kids. I didn't know that. So they showed exploitation films. And then later the beach films, which were marketed as, it's silly, it's Frankie Avalon, but they were decidedly weird and overtly sexual sometimes. And then Chuck, If you, if if you'll notice, we're kind of progressing along in this chronological order. And each thing is kind of being built on the last, It was very much a step process. Right. And apparently that, that was kind of the, the form that exploitation filmmaking followed until 1960. It was just, it was centered around drugs, violence, sex.


And in a lot of ways they were presented as documentaries. They might not have a plot. Right. And basically it was one person would make some film and it would just break all the rules, and then, then a bunch of other people would make similar films. Right. And, and the, the, the same. That, that was the way it went. And then in the 1960s, things just started to go every which way. All sorts of directions. Right. Yeah. So nudity, nudity, films were a, a, a longstanding thread of exploitation films. Yeah. And then they probably reached their pinnacle with Russ Meyers. Right. King of the Nudity is what he's called. Yeah. He was the first guy to, he's significant because he was the first director to have films featuring nudity that actually were dramatic narratives and had plots Yeah.


And characters. And they weren't classified as documentaries anymore. And then the IES came along and they offered up violence for the, not the first time, but big time for the first time. Right. And that has a lot to do with the fact that it was the sixties and Kennedy was shot and the United States was just becoming increasingly violent. America Lost its innocence. Yeah. And the other thing that really happened in the 1960s was the Hayes code officially went away, was replaced by the MPAA and the, the, I guess the longstanding prohibition on Hollywood producing exploitation films. Was it, it was lessened, decreased.


Yeah. And so studios were like, oh, we can make money over here too. Well, let's start making exploitation films. Right. And this is where Grindhouse was born. So my cinema professor definition Okay. Of Grindhouse is big budget studio backed exploitation films. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's, that's mine. I like it. That's gonna be a quiz question later. Yeah. I'll go with that. Actually, back up one second. We gotta mention Herschel Gordon Lewis. He was a director who had a co-director, I can't remember the other guy's name. Do you Uhuh. Anyway, he was, he was a co-director and he was one of these exploitation guys that was getting frustrated because there weren't a lot of places to show your movie.


So it was pretty crowded marketplace. Yeah. So he said, what's the one taboo that like people will pay to see that you, you're allowed to show in theaters, but that studios won't make, and it was Gore. Oh yeah. He was the first guy to start showing really disgusting bloody scenes in his movie. Blood Feast. Blood Feast. Yeah. Which actually was three years after Psycho And Psycho also did a lot for the mainstream. Ushering in of Sure. A little bit of gore in that. But there's Blood Beast, there's like a shot of blood following Janet Lee's murder. That's right. You know, which is, I imagine is pretty graphic for Hollywood. Right. And that's what you think of, you're like, oh, those stupid sixties.


But that's, you know, they, they were so naive. Yeah. Like that was controversial. Not really though. Like, If you stepped just slightly outside of Hollywood, you ran into things like blood feast. Right. Or, you know, Last House on the left. Yes. Well, that's 1972 I think. Yeah. West Craven. So that was important because all of a sudden a drugs started, well, three things, political themes started popping up. Right. Sexual Freedom. The Youth Generation drugs started popping up in movies for the first time. Drug use. Well, not for the first time. No. We'll, we'll talk about Reefer Madness. Yeah. But teenagers were depicted as victims of violence for the first time. Like last House on the left, I believe is kind of regarded as the first teen slasher film.


Yeah. West Craven. It's, it was almost a snuff film. It was almost regarded like that. It's pretty hardcore. But yeah, it definitely, blood feast definitely allowed last house on the left to come around. But it also probably more directly formed the foundation for slasher exploitation. Like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. Absolutely. My bloody Valentine's another big one. The craziest that's on your Grave. Yeah. The crazy. Oh yeah. That was an original. Right. There's a remake now, I think. Yeah. Eh, yeah. Remakes. So that brings us, we're in the seventies politically charged movies, brought race into the, to the mix and all of a sudden we had black exploitation or black exploitation movement starting Yeah.


Exploiting the Civil rights movement basically. Yeah. But the cool thing about black exploitation films is for the first time you had African Americans as heroes. Yeah. And not heroes in a typical sense. Not even anti-heroes. Yeah. But heroes that were like, they didn't ride into town on, on a white horse or wearing a white hat. Right. They very clearly wore black hats if need be. Like they would engage in crime, they would murder people if need be. Yeah. They were, they, they were basically like the face of black America coming out of the Civil rights era. Like we're ticked off. Yeah. You know, and, And we're gonna stick it to the white man, stick It to the man And we're gonna do it in these movies.


Chuck, I know the movie you're about to, to mention. Let's, this is it. Alright. You keep the faith in me. Are you my man? You my favorite man. Can you take it baby? So yes, that was a landmark film for a lot of reasons. One, because it grossed 4 million bucks and it made the major studio say, Hey, you know what, the black hero is marketable. Yeah. Well you haven't said the title yet. Oh, I didn't. No. Okay. And you gotta say it right too.


Melvin Van Peebles film. Sweet, sweet Backs badass Song. Nice. That was well done. That was 1971. Melvin Van. Van Van Peebles, whose last name may sound familiar. He, he's the father of Mario Van Peebles for younger cats listening to this one. Cat's our age, actually. Younger cats. 'cause he's kind of like, Okay, so Cat's our age little watch stuff. Yeah. That's Mario Van Peebles dad, you know. Yeah. New Jack City. Yeah, exactly. So Melvin Van Peebles made this movie. He produced it. He, he raised the money for it. He wrote it, he directed it, he starred in it. And it was the beginning of the Blacksploitation subgenre, which is one of the most important genres of any American cinema Absolutely.


Ever. Absolutely. And so, considering how important that subgenre is, this quote from time magazine's, film critic, Richard Corless should really hit Home Sweet Sweetback is quote, without question or competition, the most influential movie by a black filmmaker. So this is a really big deal, right? Yeah. And it was, it was just quickly on the plot. It was about a, a black man who was a gigolo, who had A, which is a male prostitute for you younger cats. And he had a deal, worked out with the cops where he was, he said, You know, you can arrest me as much as you want. Release me. Right. Afterward, fill your quota. It's all good. And then one day while the arrest is going down, they, the cops attack a Black panther and Sweet Sweetback kills one of the cops and then just says, he just goes on a, a rampage against a white man after that.


Yep. So you've got prostitution, tons and tons of nudity and sex, lots of violence and other crimes all wrapped up into a black power theme. That's right. And then to top it all off, you have what is arguably a child sex scene starring Mario Van Peebles. Melvin Van Peebles son at I think age six. Yeah. He's a kid Having sex as Sweet, sweet pack as a kid, as his first sexual encounter with an older person. Right. And in the cult podcast, if he became a cult leader, he would've taken a younger bride. Remember? Oh yeah. That's right.


So if you're interested in, in that movie and you can't get enough of Sweet Sweet Backs badass song, you could also check out Badass Exclamation Point, which is Mario Van Peebles biopic about his father making that movie. That's Right. And I have not seen that, but I wanted to at the time and it just sort of slipped through the Cracks. There's always Netflix baby. That's right. And what happened with Sweet, sweet Back was that, like I said, that told the studios, Hey, that we can market this. And so they got a little more mainstream with movies like Superfly, which were a little safer shaft shaft movies that wide audiences would enjoy as well. Yeah. The ones that didn't scare the man. Exactly.


Like shaft's a good guy. He doesn't take any guff from the man, but the people he is not taking guff from are the cops who he's really on the same side as. That's Right. So Chuck Blaxploitation obviously huge. It, it affected everything from, you know, menace to society to Bula. Yeah. All of that came from Sweet, sweet Back. And we mentioned the guy who directed this next movie, Russ Meyers. This is probably a seminal work. Let's listen to, to this clip from the trailer. If you want what ladies and gentlemen go, go for a wild, wild ride with the Watusi Cats. But beware the sweetest kittens. Have the sharpest claw for your own safety.


See faster Pussycats Kill, kill wild women, wild Whales. Race the fastest Pussycats and they'll beat you to death Sober woman belted And Don't Yourself under this kid. And hanging this up for Nothing. For nothing. It's got nothing to do with the money. Here's the money Jack and Jill. They make the mafia look like brownies. Hey, he's a big man. They make the mafia look like brownies. That's Right. That says quite a bit about them. So this, that was faster Pussycat Kill Kill in 1965.


Russ Meyers, basically women exploitation film, Nudie film. So remember Russ Meyers was king of the Nudies Nudies. He made 26 movies. But this is probably at the very least is his best known if not like his masterpiece. Yeah. And he hatched a slew of, I mean, not that he wasn't legit, he was, but what mainstream people would call legit filmmakers were, came up through the Russ Meyer film camp basically. Yeah. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. And Russ Meyer, also little known fact another movie that's mentioned in this article, there's an article on the site, by the way, called 10 Noteworthy Exploitation Films that this is based on Yeah.


Written By you. Yeah. Which I strongly recommend going to read. 'cause it has a lot of extra stuff we're not gonna cover in this one. Yeah. Or at least extra movies. But Russ Meyer directed a movie called Beyond the Valley of the Dolls too. Right. Which was the bastard son of the legitimate film, but Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Right. Is a jiggle fest written by none other than Roger Ebert. That's right. Yeah. So only Movie Roger Ebert ever Wrote. Yeah. And he had a, yeah, it was a very brief career. But that's a, that's an illustrious one. Really. Yeah. So if you're gonna talk about the plot of Faster Pussycat Kill, kill, and I say that 'cause there's three exclamation points. Faster Pussycat and a comma Exclamation point Kill Ex Oh No.


Is it three exclamation points? Yeah. Okay. I thought it was a comma then two. Alright. Either way. That's a lot of punctuation for a film title. Right. And it was about three bisexual Go-go dancers. They go on a crime spree out in the desert. And what do they do? They end up killing a man and a or no, they kill the man and a couple Keep the Woman and keep the girl. They basically empower her. Yeah. Say come on with us by murdering her boyfriend. And she ends up on crimes for you with them. And they basically end up going to a isolated house with a wheelchair bound old man and his sons, Who's a lech, they're all leches. They, they want these women. Yeah. But they don't know that these women are tough, No Tough Ladies. And the, the, the men and his son, the man and his sons apparently are allegedly have a large amount of cash stashed in this house.


So it's kind of like a, a standoff of of gall to see who will come out on top, you Know? Well, and you know, who comes out on top. Yeah. And this film was noteworthy for one big reason, was that there was a lot of dualism toward gender. So on one hand he's exploiting these women and apparently he got women in their first trimester of pregnancy. So they were more voluptuous. Yeah. Not in this film, but in his other films. Oh, okay. He, he would hire, I can't remember the lady's name, but the star of Fester Pussycat Kko was in other Russ Meyers films. Gotcha. And he made sure that she was like well into her third, first trimester to, to enhance her natural busts.


That's right. Yeah. Her bosom, If you will. But the script, like I said, it was dualism. 'cause while he did that, it also empowered women because the women in his films bowed to No man. No. They were the champs, they were the, he they were heroines really for the first time. But they were, they were objectified very clearly. But at the same time, If you follow the script and really look at their characters, then yeah. They're, they're powerful women. And This kind of kicked off a big slew of women exploitation films. Exploitation films. Thank you. The women in prison movies. Yeah. Switchblade sisters Very big at the time. Women were lead actors for the first time. They were aggressors for the first time, still nude often while they were doing this stuff.


Spawn the television show The Facts of Life. But the interesting thing is, they found that these movies appealed to men and women. 'cause men would go see it for obvious reasons. Yeah. Women would go see it 'cause it was empowering and they didn't mind, you know, looking at the naked ladies. 'cause women are much more grown up Sure. Than men are. Yeah. But Josh the seventies also got a little schlocky, which in a sense was true to the exploitation model. Yeah. They like, they really went over the top. No more political statements, no more advancing of women's gender or, or African American Americans. It just got really schlocky and outrageous at that point.


Well, what happened? And starting in the sixties, but really took hold in the seventies. And then from that point on was exploitation cinema early on, showing a live birth nudist camps. These were all geared toward adults Yeah. In the sixties. And then later on, big time in the seventies, the audience became almost exclusively teenagers. Right. Like, those drive-in teenagers or well, teenagers anywhere, who cares. But they, the, the audience was teenagers and the cast started to become teenagers. So it had a little more of a bent on what teenagers were having to deal with. Like bullying. Like the, the, the kid in, in this next clip. Right. Which is, I have to say one of my favorite movies from way, way back Here we go with Toxic Avenger.


Yeah. Meet Little Melvin. He's a 90 pound weekly. Everyone hated Melvin. Yeah. I'm gonna take this mop and shove it down your throat. They teased him. I'm gonna do it with you. Okay. They taunted him. They tormented him until he had a horrifying accident and fell into a bat of nuclear waste, transforming little Melvin into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength. Melvin became the Toxic Avenger. So Josh, the Toxic Avenger movie was unique in that it's film production company trauma is very popular in their own right.


Have you ever seen Surf Nazis Must Die? I Haven't, but I know about It's a good one. Trauma, I mean, they're master self-promoters. Yep. And marketeers, They have, they were one of the first production companies to have a website. Oh really? Like a really comprehensive website. You should go on their website. I like that. Their whole catalog. It's really just well done. And it's, it's schlocky, but it's well done. Right. And Toxic Avenger follows the story of a a 98 pound weakling who was picked on, released same years Ghostbusters. Did you notice that? 1984. Right. Yeah. So it was, it occurred at zero year. At Year zero. Yeah. We'll just put the null set Okay. To represent that. And this kid gets pushed out of a window into a vat of toxic sludge, Which, that's beyond bullying really?


Yeah. I mean that this basically, it's a more twisted version of modern problems. The Chevy Chase film from a couple years earlier. Okay. I haven't seen that one. Oh, you never saw modern problems? No. It's very silly. But he got toxic sludge dumped on him and had special powers From years earlier or prior or after What, when was the movie? Yeah. It was two years before Toxic Avenger. But Toxic Avenger took it into a gore special effects way that that modern problems never Did. So the, the janitor, Melvin, I believe his name is, becomes Toxified it becomes toxic. The toxic Avenger. Yeah. Who beats the tar out of people at the health club where he was abused and, and mutated and has tons of sex as the toxic Avenger because his newfound manhood is just irresistible to women.


And one, one of the things that's noteworthy about the Toxic Avenger is that they actually tried to make decent effects. Yeah. It wasn't just, it wasn't horrible, I guess you could say. Well, For the time, you know, it wasn't bad. No. They, they remained bad and they probably were kind of bad even back then. But for, for for Grindhouse films. Yeah. There, there you go. They were, they were great. Right. And it was also noteworthy because it came outta trauma productions or trauma studios. And it led to a whole line of toxic Avenger movies and schlock in general, which is basically like some crazy horrible thing has happened. But we're not gonna dwell too much on that.


Let's see what, let's, let's see where the action takes us. Yeah, exactly. So like bad taste that Peter, Jack Peter Jackson's first film Right. Is a great example of schlock that came out of Toxic Avenger. And he Had the film that followed Peter Jackson Dead Alive, which was at one point supposedly the Goriest film ever made. Really? Although it sounds like your new Korean movie has surpassed That. Yeah, I I think it probably has. I haven't seen Dead Alive. I've seen Bad Taste and Bad Taste. It was horribly gory, but I think this has a beat. Yeah. But I bet you if anything, I mean, I haven't seen the one you're talking about, but is it more realistic gore? Yeah. With bad taste. Like, where it's really disturbing taste. Just like these are aliens that are having their heads blown off. Yeah. So that definitely takes you at least a, a a, a degree away from caring.


Right. This is happening to human beings in, in I saw the Devil. Gotcha. So it definitely is driven home a little more. Well, and, and the violence, even the Gore back then, it was so over the top right. Outta Fan Gora magazine. It's like, you know, dude Fangoria is still around. Is it? Yeah. I figured it was. I I I'm glad it is. We follow it on our Twitter feed. Oh we do? Yep. Yeah. Like a head will explode in scanners and you know, it's not disturbing 'cause it's so clearly over the top. But these new movies are much more disturbing If you ask Me. I agree wholeheartedly. Because they're more realistic. Yeah. So, carrying on with Chucks and my SYSK and Ebert act, this is the second to last movie in our little list today.


And this one's from way back from the thirties. So let's talk about Reefer Madness. These high school boys and girls are having a hop at the local soda fountain innocently. They dance innocent of a new and deadly menace lurking behind closed doors, marijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell. Or Watch Case, If you want a good smoke, try one of these. You will meet Bill who wants to bride in his strong will as he takes the first step toward enslavement course, if afraid.


So that was the excellent Reefer Madness, which was an exploitation, a drug exploitation film. Yeah. And very much a cautionary tale. It it even shaped the drug culture and how people looked at drugs is, is, you know, marijuana at the time as this really evil thing that can make you crazy and kill People. Yeah. And actually, in, in very much the vein of early exploitation films, it was produced and distributed as a, a public service. Like the, was it, the alternate title for it was Tell Your Children and the whole thing set in, in a PTA meeting. Right. Where this guy is relating the story, and it's a story about lost lives, about murder, about guilt and paranoia.


And all of it is fed and based on rampant drug use, which is really just a lot of pot smoking, which can turn you into Athene. And it, it's apparently the director, his name is Dwayne Esper, he did other exploitation films from the thirties, like Sex Madness. Right. Psychotic Connections. And he made a name for himself basically taking these things that may have originally been written as a public service Right. And making them so outlandish that he exploited the people who were making these movies. Right. And, and created this legacy of like, just insanely over the top exploitation films from the 30.


Well, and ironically Reefer Madness years later would become not so much an anti-drug propaganda film, how should I say this? But a film that college students would sit around and watch while partaking and laughing at this whole thing Yeah. And a cult film. Yeah. Because it, it it, it puts drugs so far out there that If you, despite all the warnings, take drugs anyway, and you realize that you don't turn into a fiend and murder somebody, you reefer madness basically daress you to go further. So it's kind of an, it's the opposite. It has the opposite effect of what I think its original intent was before Dwayne Esper got his hands on it.


And as a side note, I had trouble deciding between Reefer Madness and another 1930s film by a guy named Todd Browning called Freaks. Oh yeah. Well that was, that was huge because it was the first big exploitation film. Pre Haze Code or, and last. Yeah. First and last. And it was, it was an MGM film. Yeah. And it's widely considered a masterpiece. Yeah. I mean, it looks great. It's, it's not, it was well done. It's A huge, it's a, it's a revenge movie, which is a very common theme in exploitation films. Yeah. Especially violent ones. But it's, it, it featured Browning dared to have real freaks, I guess if you'll Yeah.


Cir Circus Side Show Freaks is what it Was about. Yeah. Star in this. And they basically exact their revenge on people who've mistreated them. Yeah. And I have not seen it. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. I I I want to, I hear it's just awesome. I can't wait. It's Good. It ended his career though, unfortunately. Brown did it. Really? Yeah. Nice. Nice. And he was a, a, a popular filmmaker at the time. Well, hats off to him for, for staying True to his art. Chuck just took his hat off. Don Neil Cap. Alright, Chuck, here's the last one that we've got a clip for, which I think everybody will notice or recognize without even a word. There's not even a word in this clip. And you'll understand what's going, going on. So here we go.


So Josh, those are the unmistakable sounds of Fist of Fury of Mr one. Mr. Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee kicking bottom. This first movie. Yeah. Which was originally titled, well it's still titled I think in Asia, the Big Boss and in America it is, it's, it's titled Fist of Fury. Yeah, it was on the other night on cable. I saw part of it. Oh yeah. Yeah. I didn't realize it was his first one though. I would've tuned in. Yeah. And it was first of what, five five major films. Right. And basically it's the story of a martial arts student who's investigating the murder of his teacher. And it began the martial arts exploitation sub genre, Which later would become just martial arts films.


Right. Or was it still considered exploitation? It's all the same. Okay. They're one and the same. Anything that even remotely resembles a Bruce Lee movie, specifically the big boss or any of them is martial arts exploitation. Technically. Because again, we arrive at that one definition, it's over the top. Like Bruce Lee's taking on scores of anonymous thugs for two hours, one after the other for two hours just beating the tar out of all these people. Yeah. Without tiring really. Everybody's kind of waiting their turn politely in a circle around him and he has to beat everybody. Right. And then he works his way up. Yeah. And it's over the top. So it is exploitation. But it led to other films like Samurai Exploitation.


Remember American Ninja? Remember the whole ninja film thing that that came out in the mid eighties? That's from Bruce Lee's. That's Bruce Lee's doing. Well yeah. And you go to these, at the time when I was first going to New York many years ago, there would be, You know, you go to Times Square and this was still when Times Square was kind of gross. And there would be just the, the martial arts movie store where it was all that stuff, man. Like thousands of movies about ninjas and samurais and martial artists and very big. Yeah. I was inspired by American Ninja to become a ninja. Remember I entered a ninja training with Tommy Roper who had like more throwing stars than any kid I've ever known. Right. Yeah. What did you have? Like one throwing Star? I borrowed his. Oh, okay. I was not allowed to have throwing stars on my own.


Oh, I wasn't either. Yeah. Baptist. No, no. That was very violent. No nunchucks. I Think that even nothing like that, I think that even that, that transcends like religious background. It's like If you're a good parent, she shouldn't let your kid have throwing stars. That's A good point. And as you pointed in the article, this actually led to another sub genre, which was Bruce Lee lookalike movies. Yeah. So he made five movies, died young and then died at age 32. Yeah. In 1973. So Big Boss released in 1971, he dies two years later. Everybody's like, no. So let's find some guys that look like him, which is really kind of stereotypical and racist for the West. But must name And Bruce Lee LI said LEE Or LE.


Oh, just LE There. Well, Bruce. LI or Bruce. LE. Right. I don't think there was ever like a Bruce, L-E-I-G-H. I don't think it ever got that far. But I mean they released dozens of Bruce Lee and I just made air quote films. Yeah, yeah. There. So Bruce Lee created the martial arts exploitation genre and subgenre and he inadvertently created the Bruce Lee exploitation, subgenre of the martial arts exploitation subgenre By dying young. Yeah. And being very popular. Yeah. And which one was the one he had Kareem Jabbar in? Was that Enter the Dragon. Enter the Dragon. Yeah. Yeah. If you've never seen a like seven foot plus guy to martial arts, you should check that out.


And If you can't get enough Bruce Lee and you have a a, a good sense of humor, check out Kentucky Fried Movie. Yeah. Made by one Jerry Zucker, the great Jerry Zucker, who we met in, in Los Angeles recently. You guys are fantastic. And you used an expletive to me. You did. It was one of the high points of my life. It is. But yeah, Kentucky Fried movie. Awesome. Actually, when we met Jerry Zucker, we told him that our little speech we were given that night was one of the highlights of our career thus far. And he says, well that doesn't say much about your career, does it? Like the first thing to dude does say something Funny. And we just like kind of fawn over 'em After that. Did, we should mention briefly, and it's in the article, but just as a teaser, the late seventies, we got Nazi exploitation movies.


Nazi exploitation As a subgenre. Yeah. And one of the major players there movie wise was Ilsa, she Wolf of the Ss. Yeah. Which led to Ilsa, Siberian Tigris and Ilsa Harem keeper of the Oil Sheik. Really? There's a whole sex violence franchise dominatrix franchise that was based out of the Nazi exploitation film. You know, one could argue that QT Mr. Tarantino has made nothing but exploitation films. Yeah. Since Pulp Fiction. 'cause the Kill bills were definitely martial arts exploitation. Definitely. The Jackie Brown was a riff on, on black Exploitation. Exploitation. Exploitation. Sure.


Death proof, obviously that was what they were trying to do there. Well, Death proof is car exploitation, which follows in the tradition of Vanishing Point. Right. Which was released the same year as basically its rival to the, the founder, the founding movie of car exploitation Tulane Blacktop. Right. Great movie. Yeah. If you want to start an argument with a a, an exploitation film buff, tell 'em Vanishing Point was the, the beginning of Carp Exploitation. They'll get mad at you. And then finally, Tarantino with the Inglorious Bastards, which is clearly a, a riff on the Nazi exploitation films. Yeah. Beaten Nazis to death with the baseball bat. Yeah. That's about as over the top and lured as it gets. It's awesome. Yeah. So, and then Machete, I hated it, but Robert Rodriguez, I didn't that it was Terrible.


And of course he was the other half of the, Rodriguez was the other half with his Planet Terra of the Grindhouse double feature. Yeah. Okay. And Machete was born from one of the little fake trailers they made in that movie. Oh, Is that right? Yeah. It was one of the, the fake movie previews. It is even as far as like a purposefully B movie. Not Good. No. Well, Death Proof was okay, but I didn't like planetary that much. Yeah. And then Chuck, well first of all, before we get to today, we also have to give a shout out to Pornos. Porno came out of the exploitation film genre And it arguably had a lot to do with Killing the Ex or pushing it into the mainstream. Because once you had the movie Deep Throat and all of a sudden a pornography was on the screen, it's like you can't do an exploitation film about it anymore.


If there's the real deal going on it, it lose, its all its power. Right. And then a little movie called Jaws came along and all of a sudden a quote unquote be movie style movie made gobs and gobs of money. And that put a little bit of mainstream respectability on the map all of a sudden. And so, one might argue, Josh, that movies like Jaws and Pornography kind of shoved exploitation films, even though they still exist. They're sort of mainstream movies now. Yeah. Well, yeah. I guess another word for Grindhouse these days is Blockbuster Jaws was the first Blockbuster movie. Yeah. Summer blockbuster. And now you have to have summer blockbusters and they're always over the top right.


And exploitive of viewers tastes. And not only Tarantino, there's other filmmakers out that are trying to capture that seventies vibe with overt exploitation films. Again, shot that way. Shot on 35 or I'm sorry, 16 millimeter film, stuff like that. Yeah. So Chuck, I say our message to everybody is, number one, go onto the site, read 10 Noteworthy Exploitation films. Number two, if that interests you, like even the 10 Noteworthy Exploitation films I chose don't cover even I think a third of the exploitation sub genres. So there'll probably be another article forthcoming at some point.


If there is, we'll let you know and then go watch some exploitation movies and enjoy them. Yeah. Watch the documentary American Grindhouse too, if you're into that. Yeah, it's a great one. It's free on Hulu actually. That's right. There's ads. But hulu.com has American Grindhouse for free. It is not safe for work. No, in no way, shape or form. I was watching it at work and I was like, whoa, okay. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. If you are watching it at work, tab browsing is what you wanna be doing. Right. And keep your, your finger over the mouse and keep the cursor over the other tab. Right. And stay sharp. Or in our case, you can just say it's research. But you can't do that If you, if you're an accountant at JP Morgan, You're just a sicko, a weirdo.


That's right. That weird guy in accounting. So look up 10 noteworthy exploitation films. You can type that into the handy search bar@howtstuffworks.com. And now at long last, it's time for Listener mail. Josh, I'm gonna call this, it's a small world after all, dear guys, I'm a long time fan from Minnesota and enjoy spreading Stuff.

It does. After giving credit where credit is due, which means us, several of them decided to subscribe to your podcast. Listening to the podcast has also given me an advantage at work for thinking of the Coffee Shop's daily trivia question, which saves people 10 cents on their drink if they know It. Nice. That is awesome. After re-listening to how Legos work, I set the trivia question for which company produces the most tires on a yearly basis. A Bridgestone b Goodyear C Lego bricks. You know the answer, Josh. Most people were surprised and pleased to find out it was Lego bricks reminding them about the little play sets that their kids enjoy. This is where it gets weird. One of the customers read the trivia question, looked at me and said, it's a Ponzi Scheme.


Nice. That's awesome. In the best Italian accent he could muster everyone else. Gave him an odd look. I started laughing. He apologized and then say, and said he just heard it on a podcast. He had just listened to Legos, followed by Poncy schemes. Long story short, we were both pleased to find out that we were both fans. We are now on a first name basis, eager to discuss the most recent episodes. So these dudes in Minneapolis, Daniel. That's awesome. Thanks. Daniel And his friend now. His new friend, His unnamed friend. Yeah. He didn't name him, You wouldn't know him. You met him at camp. That's right. Band camp. Thanks Daniel. That's really awesome. Wow. That's really cool.
