They're like, hello, miss, can we talk to you about Jesus?


Follow me. I do have a pile of leaves, two rakes and a trash can. If you please clean the leaves, I'd love to listen to you talk about Jesus. And they did. And they mowed the lawn and they cleaned out the garage and they came back. I think my mom was the only person on our little town abusing. I mean, listening to these kids. It was great. They were doing the Lord's work and my work. I didn't have to do chores for months. All right, thanks guys. All right. Adam Mitchell. Okay. Hi Adam. Hey Tony. How's it going? Good, how are you? Good. This is a magical night for you.


This is a dream come true. Your wife was pulled outta the bucket. Two bucket pulls ago. That's right In between you guys was a massive black tranny. The only thing separating you guys was a Phoenix Provocate. Seven foot, six inch in the air behemoth of a lovely lady. She can dance. She's a multi-talented, she left here with a big joke book. Did you see her? Yeah. Beautiful. Oh, look at this guy trying to make it in the show. Bizz. This guy wants to be in one of his ladies Disney commercials. Absolutely beautiful. Tony. No, I'm kidding. Alright, Adam.


Welcome. Welcome. How's it going? So how do you feel about all this? How do you think that minute went for you? I think it went pretty well. Pretty well? Yeah. All right. Okay. Some of those people think that, yeah, there's some people that's about the amount of people that voted for Kamala Harris in the last election. It's a small percentage. I love it. Adam, tell us something that we don't already know about. What do you do for work again? Jesus Christ. How could you Forget? Oh my God. You've been doing standup for two years. You started, 'cause your girl was kind of doing improv and sketch, right? Yeah. So she started about two years ago. I started about a year ago. Okay. Yeah. Alright. And what's the highlight of your comedy career so far?


What's the most fun you've ever had doing this? I got to do the ice house a few weeks ago. I was In Pasadena. That's right. That was a lot of fun. And how long did you do on that set? I think I did six or seven minutes. Yeah. All right. And you kept their attention, you kept it going. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. What other types of things did you talk about? You obviously did that Mormon story. 'cause if you're willing to do it in front of millions of viewers Yeah. Then that's part of it. What else did you talk about? I talk about Mexicans and my big, my big juicy Ass. What do you, what do you, hold on a second here. We're gonna get to that. We're gonna get to that juicy ass. What do you say about Mexicans on stage? I have to know what the most white human being I've ever seen in my life.


A guy who lives in a Danish super white community now la. But okay, What is it? I mean, it is in Southern California, so I got a ton of Mexican friends and people I admire and that they're just super prideful people. Yeah. You sound like me after the Trump rally. This is great. I have a lot of Latino friends. My band's Latino. Everyone's Latino. That's the white as shit. Yeah, I have Tons of friends. They're great, admirable people. No, says that I love taco salad. Alright. Alright. Okay. So what do you say about the Mexicans on stage?


So Mexico only has one gas station. Pex and Mexicans love to put Pex stickers on their car. And Like, Like you never see anybody with like an Arco sticker, but you'll see, you know, Americans with NASA stickers. It's a cool government agency. They went to the moon allegedly. So my me, what Mexicans, I guess are thinking is, you know, Pemex may not get us to Mars, but we'll get us across the border. Yeah. You say I'm doing deep cuts. Yeah. You never had a tober loan before. Fucking animals. This guy's talking about Mexican Wawas.


What the fuck? Get Phoenix back out here. God dammit. Some eye candy. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Okay. So Adam, let's talk about your, your actual life some more. Your childhood normal. You do anything weird? What's going on with you? Raised by my single mom was one of the only Jews in our little town. Okay. You know, regular kids would ask me if Jews celebrated Thanksgiving every November. You know, just normal. Yeah. Yeah. You're not from the town where your wife is, right? You're not. Yeah. We're from the same town where high school sweethearts man you.


Wow. Wow. One of the only Jewish families in a Danish and Finnish area. Yeah. Was that rough for you? Was there a lot of antisemitism as you guys call it? I mean, I got called. I dunno why that's going. Was there, I mean, you get called Jew here and there, but I do it right back, you know? Yeah. That Would qualify. Yeah. How did they say it? What was the meanest, anybody do an impression of the guy that was the meanest To you?


Okay. So I think people expected me since I was Jewish to be smart in class. So they'd copy my work and just get it all wrong. So one day the kid behind me would like sneak over after he failed the test because I also failed it and he'd just go Jew. Wow. He wasn't wrong. Yeah, Yeah. He got that right? Yeah. Wow. All right. How's your single mom doing? Oh, she's great. She just retired. She paints murals at, at the school she retired from. Oh yeah. She's an artist. Okay. Very nice. And what exactly are you doing on the supply chain? I just make sure everything gets made and gets to the warehouse before it's supposed to launch.


That's what I would say if you asked me what supply chain management is. Yeah. Yeah. That seems like the most basic answer humanly possible. Yeah. Wow. My goodness. Adam, one last question. What scares you? What are you scared of? What am I scared of? Yeah. Well, I'm a bit, I love cars, so I think dying in a car accident, because I drive a lot. I love cars. So probably dying in a car accident. Driving too fast. And being too reckless. Do you Drive fast? What kind of car do you have? I have an E 93 20. The BMW 3 28. It's nothing crazy, but Whoa. It's 14 years old.


Yeah. It's sick. You are Jewish? Yeah. Wow. And you're inside of a 14 year? It has a gas leak. It has a gas leak. Oh, okay. That's a attempted a juju. I see. Wow. All right, well you and your girl can take your two tiny joke books and make a big one out of it if you try hard enough. Thank you. There he goes. Adam Mitchell. We're having fun here. Everything's right on schedule.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have another, not even a regular, not a golden ticket winner. He's always been a special utensil. A very polarizing figure. You know, word is, is that the people on the internet don't like him. People in live crowds love him. It seems we can't really, he's one of the most polarizing figures in the history of the show. Here with a new minute, make some noise for the long awaited return of Uncle Laser.


All right, bitch. Relax. You're who I'm talking about. Listen, Kanye West said, if you fucking fat bitch means you a broke bitch. Okay, y'all might as well call me Section eight housing.

It's a Mexican birthday party, okay? She was sitting there looking like Nacho Libre. I said, hello.

I was born this way. And I'm like, were you really? You know? And I'm just like, what's happening? So Laser, oh my goodness. Pure momentum right now. This could be his greatest performance. Yet everybody, I could tell I've seen him, I've seen him have moments like this before.

I am not kidding, by the way, it's funny 'cause it's true. And he knows it. This is one of those moments where right now he's just thinking about pure cocaine. With that being said, if anybody's got agram, so you have to show in the bathroom. Wow, look at that. Have you guys seen laser before? I haven't. This guy's, I mean, I've seen your ECS and stuff.

Some more beers. Oh, it's going down over here. Alright, this is an interesting name. Definitely a first time bucket poll. Let's see what happens here. This is the KILL TONY debut. No doubt of Jasper. The disappointing mime Jasper. The disappointing mime. Here he is, everybody.


Oh, hello. I'm sorry. Were you guys expecting a bunger? Oh, first of all, that's racist of you. Just because of a mime doesn't mean I'm French. Okay. Don't be a phobe. Wow. The name holds true Jasper. The disappointing mime. At least I don't lie to you guys. All right. Fuck. All right, hold on. Okay, you guys wanna see something funny? Really funny. I mean, All Right, I'm not trusted with anything. Oh, Okay. Let's just do the show how we normally do it. Sorry, your time to do something funny was then that was it.


Jasper, first of all, let me remind you that white mimes use more white face paint than you've used tonight. You are blatantly, this is one of the best ways to not get deported I've ever seen is by being a Mime White face. A 58. No one has noticed a thing, honestly. Okay, how long have you been doing comedy Jasper? Not that long, actually. That's kidding. A few years. A few years. A few years. How long have you been doing the Disappointing Mime Act? Like six months. Six months. What made you want to switch from being you to a disappointing mind? I was already disappointing, so I just decided to add something to it.


How'd that get sadder than what just Happened? Who told you? Who told you you were disappointing before? My family. Wow. This is absolutely incredible. Did they see you perform? Never. Not once. Okay. So what, what made, what did you do that made them so disappointed in You? Well, my dad's disappointed that I didn't finish mime college and my mom sat that I didn't follow her, her profession, but I don't have a strip of body, so I can't do that. So Hit it.


I got one laugh. That's good enough for me, guys. That's It. Fiona gets the credit for that. What You thought. Okay. Jasper, what do you do for work in real life? Bartender. 'cause well, I need a drink. Other, otherwise, you know, being up here, just sad. This is, this is the happy me. All right. Other me is sadder. Is that true? Are you trying to be funny? No, that's true, man. It's, I, you know, I didn't list my virginity till until I was like 22. And the only reason that happened is 'cause I got robbed. Wait, what? That's a whole nother story. You don't have time for it. Don't worry about it. Okay, we're gonna keep it moving along here, Travis.

You know, sometimes it's like, sometimes you have to ask yourself, oh, they're miming, they're miming music. Wow. They're jamming so hard. DE's doing it too.


Dee gets it somehow d somehow d knows what they're doing. The the, the absolute fucking synergy of this band is incredible to where the blind guy's like I do believe that is, as far as I can remember, the first mime that we've ever had on the show. And definitely the first disappointing mime. You gotta like that. He owns it. I was gonna ask him to lose the character and do standup as himself, but it just, there's just something, there's a, there's a line you walk on this show, you know, there's a reason why other podcasts don't just pull names out of a bucket.


There really is. There's, there's a real fucking reason why that no one, no matter how funny or whatever they may be, has the courage to be like, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna let anyone sign up. And a big part of the reason why is 'cause every once in a while you get a Jasper, the disappointing mind. Someone in which you're like, wow, is this one day gonna be used as evidence in a federal court? We've only had one bucket pool ever end up being a murder. And you know, it's true. It's true. There's datelines and everything about it. Gareth Purse House, Gareth Purse house, and yeah, He made an a, a movie about it.

That's her once I was on two milligram Xanax, Tony, and I don't know how much that is. Is that, That That's the Xanax bore and you could break 'em into four quarters. I call, I call that user friendly. Okay. I'm sure there's some people half asleep cracking up out there on Xanax. People waiting like, I've been waiting. Always good. I've been waiting for a Xanax comedian. So how does it start? My question, my much more interesting question was, how does someone start? I'm always so intrigued to know how these things happen. I, I, I steer clear of all drugs except for alcohol, marijuana and mushrooms a few times a year in order to not get addicted to anything.


So how does a Xanax addiction start? I've never even, I took melatonin. Like I, like, I've done that like once and it was, it's crazy. I sweat. I have crazy dreams. I sleep, slept, walked. I took a half of one the next time. Same exact shit. I can't do anything. Tell me how a Xanax addiction starts. So you take the pill. What? Right, but You get Some fucking water.

No, he said almost sexual. Almost sexual. Almost sexual. I was gonna say, let's get some zani bars. Yeah, but what made you take that? Was there, was there a lady that's like, you should try one of these, something like that. That first pill. Where do you get it? How do you find it? How do you know you even like it? How do you want it? I caught it. I actually, the first time you caught it, You caught it like it's a fish. No, more like a catcher's. Mit.

Y'all the alcohol and Xanax a beer with it. It's like, it's like there's a tingling. The feelings. I'm not like, I'm being like real like, yeah, No, I get it again. That's why I don't try these things. 'cause I'm afraid I'll like them. It seems enjoyable. Yeah, You're smart man. Yep. Okay, so what else, Seth, what else have you been doing your whole life? How old are you? I am 38. Jesus Christ. What is going on tonight? There are a lot of extremely, it's like I'm 17 Tony.

I'm fucking with you, right man. I'm fuck with you Man. Here's a little joke book my friend. You're going to, there you go. Caught That Two disappointing mimes in a row. Everybody. Alright now you know this episode had a lot of momentum early on and slowly right towards the end got very sad. And I think there's only one way to end an episode like this. It's the Jol us alive one last time with the stylings of the Hall of Famer. With the most appearances ever on the show, the most interviews. He is back and he is redder than ever.


This is the Memphis Strangler, the Sioux Falls, FOLEY, the Xanax Zanzibar himself, the Knickerbocker of New York, the big red machine. This is William Montgomery. I feel like we should ramp up President's Day just a notch. Like we should all be forced to kneel on rugs that face the Washington Monument and pray to the gods that we elected.


So the buzz in Hollywood as they're making a prequel to cliffhanger and a stars of volcano. O because volcanoes make mountains at Cliff. Okay, let's keep moving. Fuck. Elon Musk says that millions of people receiving social security payments are between 150 and 200 years old with 1% being 360 years old. Red band. I knew your mom was old as shit, but damn fuck. Germany is cracking down on hate speech. Seems a little ironic.


Okay, that's my time, Tony. Very good. 59.99 seconds. Like the man who's done it more. Fuck. I was so close to a minute. Anyone Ever. You nailed it my friend. I was so close to a minute. Tony, You are the absolute best. William, one of the most loved human beings in all of the art form an international superstar. Unlike anything we've ever seen or fathomed before. Tony, I felt so bad for the mime guy. He seemed genuinely not to talk about other stuff, but that seems sad. Tell me about it. He was so sad about it.


Tell me about it. I don't know. It just seemed like he was really feeling bad. It seemed like he was really depressed and I wanna say, thank God I'm still back off of the Call of Duty Camo Grind and Tony, I've literally, I've been doing the row machine. Guess how many miles? They do row machines and meters. But guess how many miles I've done since the beginning of February on the row machine? How many? 61. Whoa. I am doing a shit ton. It's wonderful. I'm listening to Blues Traveler exclusively. It's been a very therapeutic thing for me. Tony, have You thought about, because we have a very, very beautiful, very famous river here. Have you thought about rowing in real life?


I don't know. Well, I've looked up clubs. They have clubs here in town, so maybe one of These. You don't even need a club. You could just have your thing. You could just have your thing and go out there. Your canoe. Yeah, I need to figure it out. Kayak own. I need to figure out the logistics. You Could have your own kayak. You could have a kayak. Yeah. In row. Maybe I'll start doing that. We'll see. I dunno. Tony, I'm figuring it out. Is there something about where, where is the rower in your house? Exactly Where What part of the It's not in my house. It's at a gym. It's at a gym. It's not at my house. Maybe if I can get outta the one bedroom apartment, I'll maybe it's some point.


It's a dream to get a rowing machine. I get in my car today, Tony, and the fucking volume doesn't work. I'm trying to listen to some blues traveler. I was gonna listen to hook on the way over here and the fucking volume's busted on the fucking Volvo. Why? How could that possibly be? How could the volume be busted? I don't know. I was, I was trying. Wow. Now when you say the volume's busted, does that mean you can hear it a little bit? No, not at all. It wasn't even working at all. Wow. My goodness. So, but when you get to the gym, you put in headphones, Correct? Yeah. I got the kind that you just put inside of your Ear. Ear.


Yeah, that would be, that would be Headphones. So you kind of do, it's a good kind to do Tony. I swear I don't think I've eaten enough food. I've been burning all these calories. I feel insane. I feel crazy. Kind of. Wow. I had a cliff bar on the way over here, but I don't think I've eaten enough. It's not good right now. I feel like I'm sweating. I feel You do or you are. There is a little bit of perspiration happening. There's a lot of food up in the green room. You didn't wanna partake in any of that? No, not ever since it got me sick. I cannot believe y'all still have that fucking food up there. What Do you mean it got, I cannot believe y'all still have him make bringing the fucking food up. What Do you mean it got you sick? Like a year ago. Got me sick as shit. Ate one of the fucking cheeseburgers. Don't you kind of always get sick from things?


I just think seven tacos up There. Yeah, No, I'm kidding. It's pretty good food. It's good. I don't know. I just just didn't need it. Just Didn't want any of it today. Just didn't want any of it. You'd Rather be hungry. Can I ask Rather be starving? Can ask, what Kind of car do you drive? William? A Volvo. Okay. That's it. I just curious. Safe cars. It's a safe kind of car. Is It newer or an older model? Maybe 2012. Okay. Volume don't work. Volume does not work. Today's the first day that happened. How far is the gym? I feel like now he suspects FOLEY broke the knob on the volume. How far is your gym? How long is your drive in your car? 10 minutes. Do you drive over the river to go row in a gym?


No. You Don't. No. Your gym's on that side of the river. It's Over by Intech. I watched fucking what is space? The office space last night? Yeah. It's right by Intech. It's very close to Intech. I took a picture outside of the building today. I did put the timer on my phone, but I'm standing right where they entrance the vine tech. That's it looks almost the same too. Right? I know. It's so exciting. Have you ever thought about perhaps inviting red band with you? You guys could row together. Can You swim? Yeah. Yeah. William, a fun fact. He's a superior athlete. A former cycling champion On the fucking state champion of Tennessee. I will be honest, there weren't a lot of people in the race, but the state champion of Tennessee, He's very close with Austin's own Lance Armstrong.


Yeah, It was wonderful. We, my mother and I, I don't think I've said this on here, but my mom and I met him when my mom was helping my brother move to town. And we meet Lance Armstrong up there and my mom's talking to him and she's like, yeah, William's dad rides a lot. Not as good as you obviously. And he looks at her and he's like, yeah, no shit. Yeah. Oh my gosh. It was kind of insane. I love the guy. I still love the guy, but it was insane. Yeah. Nobody was insinuating, my sweet father was fucking faster than Lance Armstrong. It was insane. I don't normally talk about my personal life on the show very much, but I golf with Lance Armstrong, that's one of my golf buddies.


And he is ridiculously competitive. Even though he's great at everything, he's still very competitive. So to hear that, to hear that your mom, the sweet Southern little tiny sweet lady, so sweet. She's been on this show. One of the great guests or the Montgomery's, the only duo of parents to ever sit on the panel of the show to hear that. She said, well, not as good as you obviously is just, I can't even imagine what he must have thought. Just what a Stupid Piece of shit she is. In that moment. In that moment. Even though I don't think that, I know that he thought that. There's no doubt about it for sure. Just what a dumb piece of white trash this lady.


That stupid woman. Yeah. Crazy, Stupid, Crazy Woman. Crazy, crazy thing to say. He's real Racist too. He was saying, yeah, stupid white woman. He was calling her that. Yeah. That's fun. William, what else is going on before we get outta here? Well, I'm getting, nobody wants to hear this, but I'm getting back on the all Ram buds because Tony, I've been drinking protein shakes after I work out and I've been going two and three days without shitting, so I've gotta get back. But it's so weird, Tony, everybody again, be careful. This is really a warning. I used to love the Aubrey and Buds. I was eating 'em every day for probably a year and then I had to stop. I overdid it. So now I'm looking at it every single morning and I can't bring myself to open up the box, but I'm gonna have to because I'm now at day two of not shitting and I ate a bunch of food last night and Wow.
