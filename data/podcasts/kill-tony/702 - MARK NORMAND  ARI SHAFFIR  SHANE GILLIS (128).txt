These people wait all evening for this opportunity. Most people these days aren't too smart. The reason why I say that is because most people think digging is the way that you end up finding oil.

(1h 30m 59s):
That's not necessarily the case. Another way is looking for terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. Little bit about myself. My birthday is, my birthday is four 20. For most people, that's a day of celebration, right? But every so often I get somebody who will come and let me know, like, Hey, do You know you share a birthday with Hitler? And I go, wow, that's an interesting fact. No one's ever told me that before in 27 years. And they go, how does it feel to share a birthday with such a bad guy? And I go, who? Hitler? They go, yeah, Hitler is well known for killing 4.6 million Jews in Germany.

(1h 31m 43s):
And I go, okay. But like, what did he do wrong? Point six. For those of you who are smart in the crowd, you would've heard that joke and go, wow, 4.6 million. That guy must be off. But the thing is, I don't necessarily count the women. Ah, Thank you. I think I'm gonna leave the camera. Yeah. Okey dokey. Hell yeah. Dk fresh off of winning the drum solo competition. Do I, oh dare I ask what DK is short for? 'cause I'm thinking of a video game Right now, So I'm thinking doesn't Kill.

(1h 32m 24s):
That's the first thought that usually comes out of people's mouths. Yeah, I think it's for How it's spelled. Dairy Queen. Yeah. Spam Patterson. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Is my son Dairy King. I'm one of the ones that are good at spelling. What Does DK stand for? It stands for Drama King. Ah, what it stands for? Drama King. That is what it means. Oh, okay. Yeah. Did your parents give you that or did you do that one? I, I did That one clearly. Well, I Don't know how clear it's, well my friends did that one. But why I rolled with it. Why'd they be calling you drama Cake? Because I'm a bit dramatic. Tony. I'm, And well, can you give us an example of a time in which you were dramatic?

(1h 33m 6s):
Yeah. So you Got pulled over And I'm one of those guys. Oh, We're groaning now. Two hours into the episode, we're gonna start groaning. I just called him Donkey Kong a second ago. Everyone was fine with it. I say he gets pulled over. The black guy just gave me a thumbs up. Thank you, sir. I can tell because the inside of his thumb is white. Okay. Alright. Oh My God. I dug myself into a deeper hole and now we're getting applause. Let's go. Okay. So give us a time in which you were dramatic. So the reason why I got this name is because I'm very emotional for a man. Like, I like to sit around with my friends and talk about God and consciousness.

(1h 33m 46s):
And I'm like, ah, I think we should be loving each other. They're like, that's gay. You are very dramatic for a man. Okay. Yeah, I Agree. Yeah. So, I mean, that's, that's who I am. And I just, I I roll with that, You know? I love it. Yeah. I love it. What do you do for work, dk? So, I work as a valet driver at this hotel up street. Who The fuck would trust you with their kids? I definitely get a lot of side eyes. Ari. Well, Mr. Drama King, please take my Car. No, no, no. My my, my real name is Timothy. That's not, that's not a hidden fact. Yeah. Timothy's nice. Yeah. That's drama King. You should be. Yeah. Come on. No, but, but people just call me dk. No Drama King. I've gotten a word that drama king that you once tried to fight one of the nicest humans in all of show business.

(1h 34m 34s):
Yoni, the producer of Yes. Koni. Would you like to tell us exactly why a man named it would take a man named Drama King to ever want to hurt? Sweet, sweet Yoni. As I said, I'm very emotional. So What Happened? Yoni told me this was, this was a while ago, so my memory might be a little bit scratchy. This, none of it was on Yoni. All of it was on me. Absolutely. We, I already knew that Yoni, if you're wondering who that is, cackling. That's Yoni. Yeah. So I didn't know who Yoni was. He came and he approached me and told me to step off, step away from the sidewalk while smoking. Nobody Tells Drama King to step off the sidewalk. Yeah. No, No, No. That wasn't that, that wasn't the issue. I felt don't like the drama king.

(1h 35m 15s):
I felt the intention behind it was kind of malicious. Like I, I didn't know who he was. Clearly had the authority to be doing that. And it made sense at the time. Andy's one of the nicest guys. He is. He is. Yeah. I've had a conversation with him after. He's a great man. You Thought he was some random guy telling you to get off the sidewalk?

You know, I have supermodels taking to Dom Dick May Fights Lesbians, miss America Bag, lady Pageant.

(1h 46m 17s):
I think I told Aria about it when I did number two. It was wild. It was Wild. You should look up. So this is before, I dunno how to find, and it's not even on the internet. It's so, fuck it messed up. But, so the critics all hated it 'cause they're all woke in LA and they said it's the worst movie ever made no one. It's not funny. Come on, you're lying your ass off. But anyway, woke. So I had to go into the street and promote underground comedy on the street. And then people go to the theater and we fill it up and I say, what am I doing selling movie tickets when I can be on infomercials? And that's how I got into the infomercials. Yeah. I had like a little DB player showing at people on the street. Got 'em into the theater. And then I, that's how I crossed into infomercial.

(1h 46m 57s):
I said, forget movies, let's do something. Hey, the fuck Movies, let's focus on towels. Exactly. I said, fuck it. And the towels were Fucking, and I'm beating up hookers, run out, clean up the hookers, You know? Yes. The blood. And then I crossed, that's how I crossed over into infomercials from the, from that 'cause because the critics hated me. So I took that and, You know, went from rags to riches. Absolutely. I'm curious to know, like, and I, I, I tend to ask people obnoxiously direct forward questions on this show. And this might be a little too forward. Like, did you, how much ball? Oh My God. Okay. I've been informed that it has a 22% on popcorn meter. Inappropriate. My question is this. How about, can you give us a ballpark of about how much money you made from the sham wow universe.

Oh, Okay. So about, okay. Gross. Grossed a hundred million. I made about 20. Wow. Right. So fucking Awesome. Honestly, I, okay.

Heidi knows the type of guys that will punch her in the face. And By the way, I got this, oh well, alright, let me get back to the que the question again. Sorry. No, you answered it about 20 million. That's the ballpark. And, and then what happened?

(1h 48m 22s):
Did the hooker thing cost you Lot? Honestly. Okay. You wanna know what happened? You know, I, yeah, I was, this is like, I don't wanna get into a documentary here, but I wasn't a cult for 20 years. I don't wanna say a cult because I don't wanna get killed after the show or maybe within the Next week, Scientology. Perfect. I didn't say that. You said that. I said it. Well, it's KILL TONY, so it's perfect. Yep. I don't wanna be kill me. So you're good. I didn't say that, but, so I was 20 years in it. Unfortunately it wasn't a sex cult, it was a reading cult. And then when I was in Miami, it's The opposite of Sex. I had $20 million in my pocket. I'm like, everybody, every model wants, I couldn't even talk. Yeah. And the Russian girl said, Hey, let's, I don't want to even say who it is 'cause I don't, she started a, You fucking gave her one, two. Yeah. Honestly. 'cause I was, I was a little repressed, to be honest.

(1h 49m 4s):
What do you mean? She had, well, You know, 20 years in, in a cult that doesn't have sex. I mean, and if you have sex, you gotta write it down. It's like a, it's like a sin. Wow. Yeah, it's true. Whoa. Yeah. Pretty bad. So you Had 20 million bucks. I should have joined a sex cult for whatever. What? So you had 20 million bucks and you weren't really even fucking that much. Yeah. Wow.

I should have had sex with her. I guess if I, if I'm gonna get blamed for it. But anyway, long story short, I, I did thought think like, oh wow, you can just have sex for like money. I'm like, I never thought of, Was she on the rag? Alright, that's the last tell joke. Oh, hey. There we go. Abso fucking. Absolutely. Alright, there's one for anybody Wanna know what a thought is, by the way? Is what I come up with products and names for products. Yeah. I'm the owner of the products. So I came up with the word thoughts. So like, let's say you like Trump and I like Biden.

(1h 50m 27s):
Right. You, we don't hate each other. Right? Yeah, that's probably, but if you, if I hated you because you like Trump, I would hate your thought. So that's called a thought is so like the color.
