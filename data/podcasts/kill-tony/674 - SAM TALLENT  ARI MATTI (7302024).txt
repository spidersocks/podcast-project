Phoenix Provocateur.


Oh, My goodness. Here we go. All right. Breeders. Buckle up. So I love, whenever I hear conservative men give a fuck about anything but themselves. Especially when they say shit like, trans women shouldn't be able to use a women's restroom. Because all I hear is I want titties in the men's restroom when I was deciding on going through with my medical transition or not. I kind of just put it on a final scale of, alright, do you really wanna wear dresses or do you really wanna wear suits? Do you really wanna pay for hair and nails or do you wanna wear the hair and nails?


And the only thing that made me wanna stay in my masculinity was, oh, there's rights over here, but I'm black so I'll figure it out later. I do think that being trans is more about capitalism instead of self-expression. Only because I'm gonna have tits a dick and a grip. I'll be able to go anywhere and fuck anything I want to. Thank you. My name is Phoenix Provocateur. Phoenix Provocateur. Welcome to the show. I love You know I always say what I love about this bucket and this show is that we get all different types of people, all different shapes and sizes of human beings.


and you are a perfect example of what I'm talking about. This is absolutely incredible. I get it. Welcome to the show. Where should we even begin? Dude, America is crazy. I love it. Phoenix. How long have you been doing standup comedy? I started last October. Okay. What made you wanna start standup last October? I've been an entertainer for a while and I've always watched comedy kind of for afar and I was like, why don't I just throw my foot or my stilettos in the hat and see what Happens.


Right. Yeah. Well your foot couldn't fit in the hat so that's perfect. What kind of I short circuited. I did. I did. What kind of entertainment were you doing before? I started as a competitive dancer in high school and did that through college and then I did drag after that whenever I couldn't become a Dallas cowboy cheerleader because I have a nine inch dick. Whoa. Oh Wow. This is absolutely incredible. I'm black before I'm pretty, but That's, that's amazing. That is unbelievable.


I have 430 more questions. Let's get, this is amazing. I Have a question. Can we see it? No. Hell, I tried The That was a good attempt. That was a good attempt. So Phoenix, I mean My. goodness, here we are. You tried to be a cowboys cheerleader. Is that true? I didn't try, but I was kind of like trained and I danced with a lot of the girls that are on the team and even some of the hip hop team that they have. Right. But I just, I was like, fuck it, I don't wanna do that. I love it. Might not have been able to be a cheerleader. You should try out for tight end.


It'd be good for the league. My guess is that end isn't so tight anymore. It is tighter than my boyfriend's. Whoa, Wait. It's tighter than your boyfriend's. Yeah, because I have a dig. Yeah, Yeah. Well wouldn't his be loose? No, mine is is tighter than His There. you go. I got it. Okay. I got, There we go. It's hard for me to think when all the blood is rushed down to my penis. So I'm a, I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage right now. I'm trying to pay attention ever since.


Alright. You must be thinking of so many slurs. I don don't even know where to begin. I love it. So Phoenix. Yes. How do you make a living now? Go on girl. Basically just through, just through drag. My boyfriend works so don don't really, what does Your boyfriend do? He's a crane operator. He's a crane operator. Yeah. He needs it to Move that thing around. Beep beep, beep Beep. There it's there. It's I.


Oh, My. goodness. So She would've been euthanized in your home country. Absolutely incredible. That's why he came here. Oh Yeah. Absolutely. A little taste of Phoenix. So what made you go with the name Phoenix Provocateur? Well, honestly my, I, it was my drag name at first. I went with a different one. It was Carmela Delight, but I felt like it made me seem too nice. But I'm, I'm more bitchy so I'd rather be the bitch that's nice than the nice person that's mean or whatever. You know it's A different thing. I feel the exact same way.


I love it. So what was your joke about conservative men? I kind of didn't get it at the beginning. They wanna see titties in the restroom. Explain that to me. I was Basically just saying that like they're fighting against, like letting trans women in the restroom. So they want people like me to be in the men's restroom and I'm Where do you wanna go to the restroom at? Where do you wanna take off My, on my Chest Meet me and Saul number two. Okay. Alright. I've always been curious. I would go do my stretches. I forgot the question. I'm sorry. You Have a great sense of humor. I love how you're rolling with everything. What restroom do you want to use?


What makes you most comfortable? Well, I use the women's restroom. Right. I'm a little too hyper-feminine to even attempt. Even when I go to like the gym and stuff, I just kind of like avoid going to the lockers in general. Right. 'cause don don't, I found that like in my position, I'm either gonna be the victim or potentially like make somebody else feel like the victim. And in those situations I just wait till I get home. Can you give us an example? 'cause I'm curious. I genuinely don't know anything. I have just been hanging out at comedy clubs and You know. Now I'm a Texan. So You know. Life's crazy out here in Tex. How long have you have you lived here? My whole Life. Right. You're born and raised in Texas.


Austin. All over. Yep. Great. You look like you could be the mayor of Austin. Really? So give me an example of something that's happened to you. 'cause I always hear this restroom debate like in a locker room or a restroom. What's like the worst thing that's happened to you when you say you could be the victim? I'm curious to know like what's, what's happened. This is probably a couple years ago. I haven't really had a issue since. But I was in college out in NDOs, east Texas. NDOs Jack my ex. Yeah. Oh. My. God. That sounds like a dangerous place for someone like you. It Is. It is.


Especially if I'm dancing on the 50 yard line for the football games. Absolutely. It was pretty intense. But I was selling tickets for a fucking competition or whatever. And this dad came in. What kind of competition? A dance competition. Okay. It was like, I think it was like high schoolers and middle school dance thing. Right. We were just hosting it. No, every, no. What dad could possibly have a problem with you selling tickets to middle schoolers for an event? I Wasn't selling tickets. It's like, okay. All right. Jesus Christ. Don't get mad at me now. I'm not. We're not Osh. Oh my Gosh. It's easier to get the kids in if they don't have to use money. No.


Okay. I was don. Don't even think there were tickets. I think they were like pamphlets as people were coming in to say the schedule of the Day. Perfect. What kind of dad would've a problem with you handing out middle schoolers pamphlets? No, this is great. I know. I would love it if a seven foot tall dragon lady was handing my kids pamphlets for something. Yeah, They must have thought you were from the future. Right? This was back in like 2017. So he was ahead of his time with this. But like, he basically threw a fit in front of my coach and everybody was like, I don't want that thing going to the bathroom. And I was like, I am standing at the front door outside in 72 heat or degree weather in fucking Nacodoches Texas. Right.


don don't want your little snot nose brat. I fucking hate kids. Right? Yeah. I think that you should be able to go to the bathroom in the ladies' room. That way your dick doesn't get in the urinal Or so you don't try to suck it. Whoa. Sam, Sam is getting lit up. Sam is getting Lit up tonight. I'm a fan of the movement. Alright. Absolutely.

I mean, there's really no quality check whatsoever. Okay, Adrian, what else in life? What are some hobbies? What else are you doing? What's distracting you from getting better at standup comedy? Ouch. Well, technically this isn't what I usually do for, well, I'm setting myself up here. Technically. I don't tell jokes on stage. Usually when I get on stage, I don't talk at all. This is like the first time in a long time. I've told jokes. What do you do when you get on stage? I would love to show you, but they won't let me bring up my deal here. Your what? A what? I usually use like a, a proper, something that like, it's like a performance deal, but like, they won't let me use it.


What is it? A performance deal. Describe it better than that. It's like a, it's a scooper and like use it to make things sing A scooper Makes I'm, I use it to like play to music. It's pretty cool. I think a lot of people like it. He's a scooper to play music. They play music and I use it. They play music. and you, Does anybody in the band know Music? Does anybody have his scooper? Where do we keep his scooper at? He has a USB drive with music On. So that's Oh, you have it ready? Yeah. And you're excited. Is it trademarked music? Because YouTube will flag Us. That's what I was worried About. Yeah. We're we're a show on that network.


Yeah. Yeah. Bummer. Yeah. Well there goes that idea. Yeah. So it's, it's trademarked copyrighted music. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well you've put yourself in quite the hole here Adrian. and you sure That's not the one with CP On it. What? Hands Outta the Pockets. Thank you. So You have a scooper and music play. So can you give us an example of a song that plays with your scooper Name? Any song And I can play it. I can use a scooper with it. Beethoven's fifth. Alright, how about you use your hand?


I can't do that. I'm Sorry. Why can't you do that? You're so stuck to the scooper art. Bring it out here. Let someone bring it out here. Where is it? It's by the entrance. Okay, somebody grab his fucking scooper. Jesus Christ Almighty Oh. My God. Is that it? This is what you lug around with you to perform art. Okay. Jon. Deas. I need you to play something that's not an actual famous song so that YouTube doesn't flag it. Here we go. One, two, A, 1, 2, 3, 4. Anyone gonna sing What?


I need Someone to sing. Okay, Sam, This was easier than writing a joke. I do this instead of actually trying a comedy. This is the thing that keeps me from killing myself. I will have my revenge on Tony Hinch clip. I will use his skin as a mask. This looks like Mario should be dodging it.


This looks like Luigi lives in fear of it. Now I know why your forearms are so strong. I'm gonna stop you right there. Thank you. I mean, how about a hand for SAM TALLENT carrying the comedy part of the Scooper Act. Adrian, grab, grab, grab that microphone. Matt mulling is even jumping in here. He literally only talks once every six months saying that's really the whole fucking bit. So, and what's what's crazy is I always host the show and I have the same fucking question for you.


You, after a 10 or 11 years of comedy experience, you have decided that a scooper, which by the way I agree with my entire team, is a safety hazard. That's not how you use that You know. You usually use it to clean up shit. Yeah, that's what I was worried about. How long have you been using that scooper as a comedic prop? It started like around the pandemic. Right?

Wait, I was never gonna say this, but there was one time we were in Mitzi's after this, and we all are looking at our Instagrams saying, oh, what pops up when you put on your homepage? And literally Redband gets his phone out and it's a bunch of women breastfeeding.


Oh my gosh. It was the funniest saying it was babies getting breastfed. Actually. Not the only one. I'm not is true. Okay, fine. No, you actually are. And what's funny is that you think other people get recommended this a lot, but you don't know that Instagram's algorithm directly shows you things that you watch all the time. Yes. I mean, it is incredible. Half of the things. There's also George Floyd, what's the George Floyd one there? It's How does he mix? How does he fit into all the breastfeeding videos? Is It George Floyd breastfeeding? I know in Estonia, the breast milk is powdered. Okay. I mean, you're Soviet Union.


Yes. Sam, you fat fuck. You're doing good, Sam. It looks like you're losing a little bit of weight or you losing some weight. Yeah, I'm down 45 pounds this year. Congratulations. Wow. Incredible. I'm Sober like you, bro. I quit boozing And also ozempic. Didn't you get on Ozempic a couple weeks ago? No. Oh no. No. How have you been doing it? How have you been losing the weight? Oh, I just quit drinking 12 Miller Lights a night. Oh yeah? Yeah. You have been on Alcoholic Tonight and you are normally a heavy drinker. Oh yeah. I love him. So What made you quit drinking? Turns out I'm morbidly obese. Oh, morbidly William.


No you're not. That's One of the worst adjectives. I know. Well, you're working on it. We're Working on it. I'm, it's historically, Yeah, crack open. Do you still drink? Have you switched a hard liquor or anything? Or are you just sober now? I had some natural wine on my birthday, but Wow. Yeah. And also Tim Dillon made me drink in Copenhagen. Oh, nice. We went to a very fancy restaurant and they had a wine pairing and he went, he'll have that. Why wouldn't he have that? That's good. Oh, that's a good Tim Dylan you Got. It's good. Why would it be bad? I like that. Yeah, I like that. Now, you two used to work together in Denver, Colorado. William lived there for a while. You're one of the kings of the Denver comedy scenes. SAM. TALLENT.


Yep. And We had a great time. We used to have the best of time. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Did you read the new Cormack McCarthy books? Yeah, I read the first one. I did not read the second one. They sucked. Yeah. It was kind of sad. It's this last book. It was kind of sad. It wasn't great. Yeah. I didn't know this was the time for a literary conversation. I'm sorry. Oh Yeah. It wasn't great. It was sad. Yeah. We had a lot of great times together when we were still boozing relentlessly. Yeah, we Were, I remember being at your house. You lived in that house in that compound looking thing and just getting Waco out Drunk. Yeah. Down in Waco Tech. Yeah. Sam lived in Texas for a little bit in like 2016.


Yeah. And it got really weird. He literally, he did have these people that were following him at that point in time. I was just, Sam and I were good buddies and he invited me there. And it was so weird watching Sam, he would sharpen his knives and it was so weird watching him storm in this bedroom one night, just fileting this guy's face while he's still alive. Well, He didn't wanna admit that I was the one. True God. I know. I know. I know. Duh. William, you joked a lot about the debate. Did you watch it? I did watch it. And Tony. I think it is scary for all of us. I try not to ever really get political on this show, but I swear to God, the real losers on all of this are the American people.


How do we have two fucking old men up there? What is going on? I wanna run for president in four years. Whoa. After watching the debate, Tony, I'm gonna run. Wow. What? What are some of your platforms? Tell us what some of the things that you're gonna do to make America God get fucking Hispanic people outta Applebee's. Don. Wow. The Hispanic people there don't look excited about this at all. Well, they'll learn to love that head. You're just gonna kick them out of Applebee's specifically. Only Applebees. Yeah. Are you cool with that Dad?


Huh? Who's gonna cook the food? Willie, What else? Tell us more about your platform. William, I know that you're improvising all of this in the moment, but I'm Interested to find out, my gosh, what else you would do as president. 'cause I'm telling you, William, you have a real chance at winning this thing. Oh hell Yeah. I think so. I do too. I mean, we need to, we have to. I think maybe open up the borders a little more because I swear when I see these Hispanic people getting kicked outta Applebee's, we need to keep the train going because Tony, the Hispanic people will stop going to Applebee's once they find out they're gonna get kicked out.


But if we open up the border, we're gonna have a never ending supply of fucking Hispanic people to kick outta the Applebee's and Tony. That's not al. That's not all Tony. We need a Dairy Queen on every corner. Tony. Wow. Absolutely incredible. And how are we gonna pay for these dairy queens, William, God, from the, Are You, there's a trade deficit going on. Tony. We have to deal with the trade deficit first and foremost would mean we get our GP. How you deal with that going in the right direction? I mean, we gotta get really strict with countries like China. I mean, we gotta tell 'em we're not gonna buy their chips anymore.


We're not gonna buy their little plastic things. We're gonna set up an embargo on China. Seriously? If I could, what Kind of Chinese chips are you buying? Bringaroo. Alright, I'm sorry. I can't help myself. I can't help myself. But Yeah, all kinds of stuff. But I'm just really excited about the opportunity. I mean, we'll see, China Is a problem. That's true. Tell us more about that. you go ahead. I can't say it anymore. You say it. I read some blogs. It is a huge problem. And the fact that your presidential candidates are two old men with the alternate sounding like Martin Phillips is a big problem. It's a giant problem.


I mean, how are we ever gonna be to the tip of the iceberg again in the world? Political, socioeconomic, sta Tony. How are we gonna get there? It's not gonna be with two fucking old guys running for president. It's gonna be off of the back of maybe some balding red at a person that is gonna go after. I'm gonna, I'm gonna fucking go after. I absolutely agree. I truly think the best man for the job is a balding, redheaded person. Thank you, Tony. And I'm just so hot and it's so hot at the apartment. I'm just dreading. I'm not even kidding. I'm dreading going back to the apartment tonight. Red band. Can I say at your place? I know I go after you about your mom and shit, but please.
