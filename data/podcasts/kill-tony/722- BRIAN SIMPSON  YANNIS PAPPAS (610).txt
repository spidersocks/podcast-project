But why, why would they call the chicken and rice mit? It's a, Well, it does, you know, like for example, when I'm eating like leftover chicken curry, I like that because the inside of my microwave will actually match the, in my toilet bowl and decor's important.

I will leave things out for about an hour or two. Truth be told, I will like, because I'm, I'm a bit of a waster, right? You know, I've, I've worked hard.


I've worked very hard and I know there's always a feeling nowadays. It wasn't always this way. Back in the day when I really needed that food and I, it was outta money. I fucking needed it. But there's a thing now. When I put something in the refrigerator, I just know that I'm doing it out of the kindness of my heart. Like I know for a fact it's definitely going in the trash, but I go through the thing where like, I'm a good person. There're starving people. But there's a hundred percent no fucking way. There's no way I'm gonna touch it again. I literally have no idea how to use my microwave. Sometimes. Pizza though. I'll, I'll go back on pizza. That's the only thing. I bet you fucking will.

And the thing about my brother is like, he's too retarded to keep a job, but he's not retarded enough to get social security benefits. So he's in this gray area of retardation, learning disabled, autism. Dude, we would take my brother to these fucking mental evaluation interviews as a kid. And he's so autistic that he'd be like, now's my time to show these people how smart I am. It would be like this reverse WB frog situation. We'd bring them into these interviews. Can I finish it?

No. Yeah, it'll totally work. Go ahead. I don't know what I'm talking About. We'd bring him into these interviews and he'd suddenly become affluent as fuck. We'd walk in and be like, yes.

Let's check in with BRIAN SIMPSON here. Hey Brian. I feel Like severely retarded. People need, need four wheels minimum. That's a good point. Right. Y'all let this nigga out on two wheels. That's crazy. That's a good point. It's a regular bike. They call it a dirt bike 'cause it's covered in dirt. 'cause he falls so much. Oh dude. He eats shit on those things, dude. He's crazy. I bet those people do eat shit sometimes. Michael, let's talk about you because I don't think the apple falls far from the tree in this family. What are you doing for work? I'm doing, I've been doing standup full time since April.


I'm just doing spots all over Austin. It's a nightmare. When you say you're doing standup full time as a job, how much money are you making, Michael? Well, I'm doing a podcast. I'm hosting whatever I can. I'm been hosting roast battles for Roast Battle Austin. I did one that's Not standup. How much do you get paid for that? I did like, I got like 70 for that 70 to Host a whole creek roast battle. Yeah. Okay. That's actually more than I would've expected. So 70. How much are you making from your podcast? My podcast makes like one 50 a month Right now. From where? Where are you getting that one? 50 Patreon baby. Yeah. People. Yeah. I have a solid group of Frog Nation.


Frog Nation? Yeah. I have a whole And how, what's the membership? 10 bucks a month. We got a, we got $1, $5, 10, and 20. We got a shit ton of $20. Guys. You have a shit ton. You know how many you can have to make $150? That's seven. Seven would be the maximum. Dude, that's A lot A shit ton. Dude. That's a lot. People are giving me 20. That's like seven. Wow. I wish we were so easily satisfied with 20 followers. You know, it ain't much, but it's an honest start, you know? Okay. All right, Michael. It is an honest start. So $150 a month plus 70 for a show that happens monthly. You host it monthly or I, I fill in for the current host. He's on vacation.


So even the $70, that was the luck of God. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you're counting on this 150 a month and you have to split that with a co-host. Right? That's just you? That was for me, yeah. Wow. Incredible. Like officiated all the battles, did a opening spot and then hosted the pre showcase before the battles. It's a ballpark. What do you think you made this past month? This past month? Probably cleared like shit. Doggy, like three, 400. Wow. And you have, I happen to know because she works here. You have a girlfriend that works here? I have a wife, yes. A wife that works here. Yes. And she's taken care of you. I take care. We take care of each other. How do you take care of her?


I've a, I've adopted the role of house husband. Shit. Yeah. It's, I'm a bitch. Yeah. I don't know if you guys understand how emasculating it is to get a peck on the cheek while you're doing the dishes, but I would not recommend it at all. Heck yeah. All Right. I always wonder like why doesn't more comics have like a, you know, a lunch shift at a restaurant or working like a nine to four job? I mean, I've, my whole life I've had two or three jobs my whole entire life. Same. Like I don't understand this. Rely on comedy shit at all. Yeah. So it wasn't like this always, when I first moved to Austin three years ago, I was working at Vulcan.


I had to work from home job and I used to work for KILL TONY. So I was like spread very thin. You worked for KILL TONY? Yeah. I Worked for you for like a year. The first year mothership opened.

A lot of free hoodies. Okay. We're gonna need those back. We're gonna have you wash them since you're a house bitch. And then you can give them back to us. Alright. Michael, anything else crazy we should know about you before? I've been training jujitsu with the mothership security guards for the last three months.

What the fuck do you do? Jesus made it worse. Frog style. Frog style, squat. Point it down. What Does that mean? Try it at home. You have her legs over her head or something? No. She's like, maybe in a, like your lady is probably like in a missionary position and her legs are on your shoulders. This feels a lot like a juujitsu class Right now. But stick with me. No, this makes sense Actually. Yeah. Her legs on your shoulders, your feet are on the bed. Like so sumo style, froggy style, and then you just bounce on the bed. Right. Okay. That actually makes sense. It's one of the rare times that I've gotten an actual physical correct answer from the question.


How do you please your woman in the bedroom? Yeah. I think it's been 12 years I've been asking that question. People are like, oh, I just hit my inhaler and pray for the best. But not you, you gave an actual answer there. Yeah, I'd be fucking That's incredible. That is incredible. That's a lesson for everyone out there. Hit different angles, try different things.

We played Texas. Hold him here at Mitzi's until five 30 in the morning on the line. I could have won $40,000. Or he wins a spot on KILL TONY. And here he is, Ladies and gentlemen, making his KILL. TONY debut. This is a minute of comedy. He's been preparing a month for this. We're gonna have some fun Right now. Make some noise for Doug. Poke everybody. It's hard to live in Texas without hearing about the immigration debate.


They're bringing in drugs. They're taking our jobs. We've gotta do something about these Californians. We're gonna build a wall and we're gonna make New Mexico pay for it. And for the record, I don't understand where they're coming here. Anyway, over the last few years, the California real estate market's been on fire. Maybe they're just a little burned out. Oh, we got lots of natural disaster fans here tonight. That's nice.


It's also hard to live in Austin without hearing about this serial killer at who's killing gay men at Lady Bird Lake. Yeah. How was that? Funny. I didn't think much about it, but then the other day, my friend called me, he said, Hey, where are you going out tonight, man? I just wanna make sure I know where you are. And then it dawned on me. My friend thinks I'm a murderer. But that makes no sense. 'cause I love gay men. And we love you too, Doug. And we love you too. I'll tell you, I, I am pretty sure I'm right here.


I'm pretty sure that's the best set of the night from everybody. Absolutely. Thank you. Incredible. Thank you. When you put your mind to it, I mean, you've been practicing for a month. We're buddies now. I met you that night and We, crazy. Crazy Night. Crazy fucking night. It's just one of those nights where it was like a fucking Scorsese movie. I kind of told the story a couple weeks ago, but it was just people telling me, Hey, do you know the best heads up poker player in the world's here at your after party? It's every Monday we have a little party after each taping. And I kept hearing it all night. You were on the other side of the bar. I had no idea who you were. And then by the time we finally got to meet, by the time our paths crossed, I was just drunk enough to challenge you to, to poker.


Turns out you run what I, from what I'm told, is literally the best poker facility in the country. Yeah. Lodge, lodge Card Club here in Austin, Texas. Yeah. That's what's up, by the way. So when, when we first met, I thought we would like exchange names and be like, some, some pleasantries. And I'm like, hi, I am Doug. He's like, I'll fucking beat you in poker. Yeah. I was excited. Where, where did that come from? Like, All right, let's see what we can do. But you Are Ready to Go. Yeah. That is a Monday night brought to you by whiskey and tequila. See, I sip whiskey and I do shots of tequila. It's a problem. I'm going to be joining Henry Cruz's father in the pancreatic cancer department real soon. It's a ticking time bomb.


So enjoy the show while it lasts. But on Monday nights is when I really let it rip. I'm, I kind of more chill throughout the week. And I blow my liver to shreds on Monday nights. And boy, oh boy, you met me at about what, 12:31 AM on a Monday night, and we played poker until 5:30 AM everybody. And it was one of those games where it wasn't just like us. It was fucking, everyone was around us. It was a very entertaining game. You are fun to play with. Appreciate. I was fucking talking shit. Having fun. It was a great doing things like looking at one card and fucking seeing a king and betting big, and just hoping the other card was good. We were having Fun. Yeah. Oh, no, I, I saw how you played. You played, you were really aggressive.


You were pretty crazy player. But yeah, I, that, that kind of makes sense. Yeah. I I, I, I feel like I made a mistake though with the negotiation for the stakes, right? Because like, I was like, All right, I wanna go on the show. I'll put up some money. And I was, I was kind of drunk too, so I was like, how about $20,000? Yeah. And he's like, done. And I was like, oh shit. I probably should have opened lower on that. Yeah. But kinda worked my way up. Might've been good. And I won that first game, for those of you that don't know, but it, it all happened so fast. I realized afterwards that I'm the sucker. I didn't realize what was happening there, but by letting me win one. And I go, well, now I wanna play. So what, what, what was it then?


It was basically the same bet. Dude, we were so drunk. I don't think either one of us can retell the story. Y'all Sound so fucking gay. Y'all are Flirting back and forth. Oh shit. Oh shit. Come on out. Like, they on It was a wild Night. The fuck Already? Jesus Christ. He's like, he's like, how do, how do we beat? No, no, no. Do you tell the story? You tell it better. You tell it. We had much fun. It was a crazy story. We Were so drunk. We were shooting tequila and whiskey. We met this handsome man. Which one's the handsome man? Oh. Oh, okay. That's why. You know what?


The universe isn't fair. We've had these fucking disabled people come up here, can't put a joke together. This fucking guy just started comedy three minutes ago, comes up here with a beautiful face and blows everybody out of the water. God's not real. And not only did he have the best set, tell our, tell the people How much money do you think you've made playing poker? Doug, poke. So I've, I've won about 10 million in tournaments. I No big deal. This is why I wanna butt fuck this guy. Don't ruin it for me. Giannis, don't ruin it for me. If I'm finally gonna be as gay as everybody wants me to, Doug's gonna be the guy that takes my butt virginity. I I, have you ever heard of Froggy?


So before, I want you to hit it Missionary dude. Oh yeah. I'm face to face. I, I, I know I had a bid on it, but I I don't actually love gay men. Oh no. I know. And I They love you. I'll tell you that Right now. We're gonna play again tonight. Winner. Take all. Hell yeah. So Doug, what's it like out there being a fucking actual pro poker player? What's like a cra Give us an example of another crazy night or something, or anything wild that you've seen. Yeah, so I, I've had some pretty big wins since. Some pretty big losses.


One weekend, I, I lost a million dollars playing online poker. And I went down to the lobby and I was really sad. And they had like, police everywhere. And I asked the hotel person, I'm like, why are there, why is everyone, why aren't these police officers here? Like, oh, someone killed themselves this weekend. And it was, it was someone from Glee, like one of the lead people from Glee at Fairmont Pacific Ren. He killed himself in the hotel I was staying at. And I was like, okay, I guess I'm having the second worst weekend. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. Even fucking killing with follow up jokes. Jesus Christ. He didn't even write that one.


He is a, he's, he is a natural. That's why I'm in love with him. I'm telling you. Yeah. Do you think you're gonna continue doing standup? Like, is this something you really want do? Yeah, so I've been, I've been doing it for like a month now. I, it seems like a lot of fun. I enjoy it for some reason. I'm always worried I'm gonna like, forget things. I dunno if you guys, Yeah, that's how it starts. The memory builds after a while for most people. William Montgomery still reads off of no cards. But everyone else, it naturally happens. I remember, especially the first fucking couple, few years, I'm like, Jesus Christ, how am I, how, how do people do longer sets without fucking, but the me And also, the more that you write, the more that you like your jokes, the more that you're excited to tell them and don't want to forget them.


Yeah. So like, as the jokes get better, they become easier to remember. If that makes sense. Yeah. I I, I could imagine that. So I, I do a lot of like, online videos and stuff and it's just, it's so different when you record YouTube videos. 'cause like, you're like, what's up guys? Doug Polk here. I didn't like that one. Delete. Okay, we're not right here. It's like, Nope. You heard that? Yep. Yep. It's true. It's absolutely true, Doug. Well, anything else for Doug? Guys? Brian, all you're gonna say is that we're gay. And then put the mic down for the rest of the show. Hey, you guys, you guys gave shit. It was time. No, but yeah, you'll slowly, you'll slowly like, empty up a part of your mind that like cares about people and things and you'll fill it up with jokes.


That's nice. You're a smart guy. Obviously. You know, people that can play poker professionally are already living a lot of people's dreams. The fact that you're chasing this rush, and it is, as you probably can feel, a crazy adrenaline rush. Same type of thing as when you're in a big hand, you don't fucking know what's going on, but you got it. And you're getting a big joke book. Thank you. Hell Yeah. Doug Poke everybody. Thanks Guys. Back to the bucket. We go. That's my boyfriend. There he goes. Farro style. Alright, Ladies and gentlemen, back to the bucket.


We go, this looks like a newer name. Oh my God, I'm busy. The lovely Heidi. Ladies and gentlemen, these guys are gonna go wipe off each other's pants together.

Like, why are people who smell the same fighting so much? You know? That's true. It's like, really? That's What I'm saying, Smell the same. That's What I'm saying. And why can't you just all kill each other and then it'll be just an open land for good people. It's, it's gonna happen. I'm kidding. Jesus Christ. I don't know why I'm saying I'm kidding. The internet clip probably ended 12 seconds ago and I said the thing, And now I'm in trouble again. Gonna get bigger now. Oh, Madison Square Garden again.

But he was touring with Jason Mraz at the time. Okay. And he, yeah, he was very cool. He had some sort of shirt on the head of saxophone or something. And I, I was Surprised when you were passing by just meeting Carlos that he had enough time to tell you that he was touring with Jason Morat.


It's crazy. Yeah. Almost seems like, almost seems like he was trying to, He was like, Hey, Did Carlos, Hey, nice to meet you. I tore with Jason Morat. I sing too. Hell yeah. It was a good story. He's touched those vintage titties. Oh yeah. No, He went from Sosa to So sos. Yeah. No, no. He was very professional.

Tell us more about that. When you say comeback story, what do you Mean? Well, I started doing comedy in 2006. I was on search for the funniest mom in America. I was a finalist and Leanne Morgan was on season one. I was on season two. Wow. And so I did comedy for about five years and then I quit to raise those ratty ass children. No, I'm kidding. I love them. Found a new husband. I had to teach him how to cook and things like that. So I quit for about 12 years on hiatus for 12 years. I came back last May at about this time and I just headlined Dallas Comedy Club.


And I couldn't be more proud as a human being doing my dream. Look at you Absolutely incredible. Hey, Hey, hey, Tony. Yeah. BRIAN SIMPSON. I, I just wanna point out, I know Leanne Morgan and she is a comedy star and selling out arenas and arenas, but she did it, but she raised the family at the same time. I couldn't do that. So you, you just quit for no reason. She was doing comedy raising children. I was doing comedy and had a very stressful job. Yeah. You had the weight of the world on your chest. Yeah. I had to red band. Do you remember one of your old jokes? Like your old best joke that that got you? Like, you know I do. Yeah. I remember the one that got me on the show. Oh, let's do it. Why don't you guys want to hear her best show?


Okay. It's, it was clean comedy because it was Nick at night. But my parents have a little ranch in Lockhart. Anybody familiar with Lockhart, Texas? So my mom with her very heavy accent, she was collecting little farm animals in Lockhart. And she called me one day at work and she said, Donna, Donna, today we have a new donkey. His name Abel. He's so very, very cute. He's four feet tall. He's so cute. But he's so loudy here all day. I said, mom, I'm at work. I can't talk to you Right now. And she said, DMA, you listen to me. We have a new donkey today. His name Abel, he four feet tall, he's so Betty. Betty, cute, but he's so loud. He here all day.


I said, mom, I have to go. And she kept saying, he's so cute. He's so cute. I said, mom, I have to go to work. And she got very upset with me. But I hung up the phone before I hung up. I said, mom, let the ass do his job. And she had never heard that word in that context. And she said, no, nah, he not call you name. We don't have to call him name. And I said, no, no, no mom, it means ass. It just donkey means mule. It's in the Bible. It's not a bad word. So a few days goes by and I called her at work and she sounds a little sad. And I said, mom, what's wrong? And she said, Nona, everybody laugh at me today. I not know why. And I said, trust me, old woman. It was something you said. I said, what did you say today at work? And she said, Nona, I talk about how cute my ass is, but it makes so much noise.


Wow. Donna, Thank you. You gonna do it? Red band, love to be on the secret show Thursday, boom. On a real show. And you're leaving her with a big joke book to go with those fucking tits of yours. Donna Lee. Ladies and gentlemen. Donna Lee comedy. All right, let's get one more. Lemme just say, there's no way her stepsons don't jerk off to her tits. Oh, totally, totally.


There's A lot of people going to jerk off Right now. Obviously. I just saw a little boy cross right in front of me to go jerk off. I'm pretty sure little boy and a wife beater little boy and a tank top. Going to the boys room. All right, let's get one more bucket. Pull up here. We've been having fun tonight. Yeah. How many of you like it when comedians do good on this show? How many of you like it when comedians do bad on this show? All right. About 50 50, Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for your final bucket Pool of the Night. It's Kelly Lus. Kelly Lusk.


Hey everybody. Sorry. Let me just, okay, so, All right, one more time for Kelly Lusk every, okay. Right, right. So I grew up looking like this. Apparently I was a Samoan boy when I was a little girl. It's every little girl's dream, right? And that bitch is my sister. She used to tell me they found me in a trash can in Mexico.


Fuck her. Right? And it's really apparent here who's more loved, right? You know, like she's got a frilly little shirt or golden blonde hair and they're like, oh, there's no hope for Kelly, so let's give her a mullet and a bull cut. And my mom got so tired of answering questions when we were in public. So she made me start wearing a sign that said, no, I'm not adopted. No, my dad is not Mexican. And yes, I belong to this white family. That's it. Wow. Exactly a minute. Very rarely is a physical presentation.


Funny, but you. That was hilarious. You're welcome. BRIAN SIMPSON. Yo, she Blows. Is that the first time in KILL TONY history? Somebody did like a one woman show for their minutes. Yeah, I think so. I'm Really blown away by that. That's impressive to the motherfucker. Thank you. I don't know if it was a one woman. It might be a one they them show or something. That's funny. I love it. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. So how long have you been, is She her? But you know, I love it. Okay. All right. I like just a second ago, don't worry about it. Oh, the guy with the American flag shirts leaving.

Eat chalupas and tequila before they made you like, wow, what exactly have the doctors talked about this? This is a fucking anomaly. That is incredible. You are the best big brother any little sister's ever had. This is amazing. I'm pretty sure that boy was on the show earlier talking about froggy style, wasn't he?


Is that Michael Ridley? Oh my God, it's very rare. We have the same comedian on twice in one episode. But that man was here. I recognized that man. If that was a police sketch, I would go, oh, he was on my show. I know exactly who's going around raping people. Froggy style. I know that, man. Why were you so orange? Like what the You're not that orange anymore? Honestly, the only thing I can say is I grew up in a time where we were outside. Yeah. And we didn't believe in sunscreen. So Absolutely. That's My world. We have no idea. We don't know why I was so much darker than my family. So, love that. We just pretend it's like JonBenet Ramsey and JonBenet Goodman.


That is an incredible duo of sisters. I cannot believe what I'm seeing. I've never really seen anything quite like it. So, boy Oh boy. BRIAN SIMPSON. So, So you telling me your, your mother never had you visit an uncle that you couldn't tell your dad about? Nope. No. And you must have asked them about this. Like, oh, I Asked all the time if I was adopted, for sure. Yeah. I'd be like, I don't look like you. I rolled around in baby powder one time and I came out and I was like, I'm white like mommy. Wow. It's a true story. So what is your ethnicity? What's dad?


We're just American mutts. I mean, there's like, Wow. And, okay, so what do you do for work now? What's That? What do you do for work? I'm an executive assistant. So yeah, like I get to work and do the work for big wigs in, in corporate America that don't know how to make PDFs. And they make perfect hundreds Of What does your sister do for work now? She's single. She Oh Jesus. Red band Christ, dude. Oh, you're fucking disgusting. Jesus. That's a's been child. Yeah. It's been a long time since we've done a trash can you guys wanna do it? 1, 2, 3. Trash can.


It's been so long they don't even fucking know. So a lot of people that started watching within the last four years, that's an old thing. He used to say super disgusting shit all the time. And, and we've slowly tamed him down and the show became a wild success. So it's amazing how those things work. Incredible. Okay. So what does she do now? She's a stay at home mom. Ah, see? Yeah. She ended up being a do nothing bitch while you're out there working with fucking high successful people. That's right. Well, Tony, they knew when they took that picture, which one was gonna have to work the hardest.


Wait, I, I have, I have a uncle and I, I brought this picture out and I was like, Hey Uncle Johnny. Remember when I used to look like this? And he was like, we were worried about you, Kelly, but I got news for you. Uncle Johnny is your father. Yeah. I'm about to say there's no way your mom didn't fuck another guy at some point. That's not, you know, guys don't have the same dad. Your mom fucked a very fat mo like Yeah. Vegan guy. Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps Ali. Hey, you guys have done a DNA test of some kind. Have you tested this? No. But you can tell now as we're older that we look alike.


But this, that was My next Question. This was definitely not the case growing up. Wow. That is incredible. Do you always, have you done this before with that picture on stage and you I've done it once before And it worked. Yeah. So obviously It, it fucking works. I guarantee if you take a 23 and me, they're gonna catch a murderer in Alaska. It is. It is incredible. It looks like you were photoshopped into a better looking family picture. It looks like, it looks like you're covering up a happy mom and dad somewhere. Proud mother and father. It is amazing. Okay, so you live here in Austin?


Yeah. Born and raised. Ooh. Lived here my whole life. I'm a true unicorn. Okay. Absolutely. What do you do for fun? Tell us what some of your favorite Austin pastimes are. Honestly, there's too many people. I don't do any of the Austin stuff anymore. I already did all that stuff and it's just too crowded now. Whoa. What do you do? Oh, well, I like to paint. You stay at home and paint. I stay at home with paint. Okay. This is getting very sad very quickly. No, No, no, it's good. There's too many people. I do nothing now. Okay. And what else other than painting, what do you paint? It's like a textured art thing. I, it's complicated.


Okay. Yeah. I like to write jokes. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you perform a lot. This is my fourth time ever doing a standup. Wow. Look at that. Well, you know, you know what's funny? That's fun. What's your love life like? Kelly? I have a boyfriend. Okay. What does he do? He's an engineer. All right. Okay. Big people are very Whoa, whoa. Oh, Engineer. Amazing. A fat girl, but an engineer. I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Just kidding. I wonder how two kids, were you like addicted to a specific kind of candy or something?


There had to be something that you and your sister were doing differently back then. There had to be something like you knew where they hid the snacks or something like that. You, you love carrots? Why? Because I'm orange. I think it's just the picture. You're also just a little bit bigger than her. Oh Yes. I don't exactly think it was carrots that did it. Definitely not carrots. I would say lots of sugar. That was a Garfield joke. I'm sorry. Put that mic down. Red band. Very good. Very good. Let's stick with the sound effects there. Alright. Anything else crazy we should know about you before we let you go Crazy?


No, I, no, no. I think you're very pretty. Oh, thank you. Wow. You Look like You like Rosie O'Donnell before she became a dude. You know? That's True. That is true. And I agree. Yeah. There's no crying. I I do have a joke and it's for this, it's, I look like the love child of the Rock and Rosie O'Donnell. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I see that. So do all your jokes require you to be holding that picture? No. Okay. But it's just a good, it's a good solid one. So Brian Stips is gonna home, go home and jerk off to all the contestants on this show.

How about one more time for Austin Zone Kelly Lus. Ladies and gentlemen, what a goddamn show.


Did you guys have fun tonight? There's only one way to end a show like this, Ladies and gentlemen. And it is with undoubtedly the Hall of Famer, with the record for most all time appearances and interviews. The man who God himself says, favorite comedian, a man who, when he goes to the dog park, king Charles lays down and bakes for his mercy. Some people call him the Memphis Strangler, the vanilla gorilla, the big red machine.


This is William Montgomery. Woo. Remember when they stormed Osama bin Laden safe house and they claim they found pornos? I'm starting to think he was just watching Diddy and Berka. Texas just banned the sale of all marijuana products. And the Republicans seemed very excited. You know who else is very excited? The cartels.


Daft Punk is releasing a new anime movie. It's called Nerd Alert. But seriously, you can tell Daft Punk are French robots because they smoke cigarettes and cheat on their wives. The price of eggs is so high. I started selling my girlfriends. Okay, Tony, that's my time. Wow. A fourth of nature has done it. Again, these people, sometimes they've been doing it for years, sometimes they've been doing it for months. Sometimes they take a break to raise kids. And meanwhile, every time, somehow no one shakes the room quite like you do.


Isn't it something again and again, a man so beloved. So likable that he just comes in and absolutely dominates. Let's talk about it. William, Tony. It was so scary coming in here today. It was storming outside and I get right to the back door and I see a, a thing of lightning and hear a loud clap of thunder. Right when I got to the back door, it was really scary, Tony. And Then what happened? And then I banged on the door and somebody let me in. I was like, oh my God. It's raining out there, yo. It's like, storm it out there, man. Get me outta there. Do you like the rain?


Yes. I love the rain. It's really good for the plants. It's good for all the plants. And I love you have a love the rain. I was You have a lot of of plants. Yeah, I got some in my bedroom. What are some of your favorite plants that you have? Oh shit. I mean, I got a pretty good pothos Right now. Ooh, aloe plant. Ooh. So called a prayer plant. And you think it's dead, but then it comes back to life. What else? I got some sort of li peace Lily.


And that's about it Right now. You got peace, Lily. I don't know why it was hard to say that. Yeah, I got a piece. Lily, How long have you had this piece? Lily? Shit, Tony, maybe 12 months. Wow. Yeah. You mean one Year? A year fed the piece, Lily. Sorry. I feed it in monthly installments, so it's ages in months in my head. Okay. I love it. Amazing. William. Wow. Are you looking forward to getting any more plans? Ooh, Yeah. Tony. I mean, I've been thinking about maybe a Cactus. Yeah, cactus.


Maybe The crowd. And A fern. Bon A bonsai. Somebody else help me hurry. Can somebody else please gimme another plant? Tony, this is embarrassing. I thought I knew more plants. Dude, It seems like the crowd fucking loves it. Every time you say a plant, they get very excited. Maybe around Christmas time you're going to get a Aist.


And if Texas ever approves it, maybe a mayor. What? Okay, That's right. We gotta get Governor Abbott to straighten out his act. Ah, We, we need that to be legal. Name some more plants than Have I? I'm already struggling, Tony. It's already kind of embarrassing. A Douglas fur. Maybe a FCUs wandering Jew.

Yeah, that's a tree. Yeah. Name some more plants that you might be interested in getting around Christmas time. Maybe a red leaf plant known as a Monster. Wait, no, hold on. What was that one again? What did you suggest? A plant with red leafs around Christmas time.


Quinta. Close enough. We'll allow that Missile toe. I hate this Tony. Oh, It's so good. The horns. The horns joining the fray and playing. Sadly, if you're not committed or don't say it correctly and playing loudly and excitedly. If you nail the name of the plant, why don't you just think of some types of things that you see outside. Well, or those are basically plants, right? Like a, like maybe a William. William. Oh, tree.


Wait, Tony, how about, oh man, go. Y tree Would've been a bowl. Tree to And then maybe a bush of some, yeah, A bush. Are you ever gonna stop loving plants? I don't think I'm ever gonna stop.
