We opened the stall door to the shower and then there he is just You know, handling his package right in front of us. Just really going at it.


And I'll never be able to look at a white snake the same ever again. But anyway, we are like, You know I'm not equipped to handle this. So we go and I tell the scoutmaster, You know, go make sure, see if he needs any like actual help. And I sat there and I thought about it and I was like, just left a scoutmaster alone with a naked minor. And so that's the story of my first threesome. And that's my time. Okay.

Growing up Brown, I've unfortunately deal with a lot of racism, and one of the things that pissed me off about racism was how black people get compared to monkeys all the time. I think it's horrible. I think it's bullshit. I think, I think they're, I think they're more like dogs. Hear me out. Hear me out. And not, and not in every way. Not in every way. For instance, You know if you get a bunch of, if you get a bunch of them together, the dogs won't try killing each other.


You can't count on a black man for emotional support, but in ways that they're alike. You can't understand them when they're trying to talk. The female ones are bitches. And it really sucks when you have to hit one. It's horrible. What a great shit. What?

I'm not finna let you have fun in my phone. Bitching block all my hoes. What the fuck?


I don't know bro. I gotta fucking go see somebody bro. Because a lot of bad shit been following me lately. I was at LA like seven weeks ago and the Muslim community tried to come for me because this fat 400 pound Muslim lady was in the front row at my show in la and she You know had on the biggest hijab I've ever seen in my life. It was like king size You, know what I'm saying? King bed size. But she was on her phone texting the whole time I was on stage and I'm like, Hey bitch, what the fuck? What are you doing? And she's like, be funny. And I'm like, oh really?


So I'm like, good thing you're not a terrorist because if you were, it would take three phone calls to blow you up and that bitch ran out of the room. And I'm like a little more of that and you'll be all right bitch. That's my time. Take care. David Lucas, I can attest to the fact that everything in his set is true. Yeah, it is. Tony, Indeed. I got a call from a popular Muslim comedian. Oh yeah. About About the very big Muslim girl that you made fun of. That is true. And indeed, after a long day and night, the other night I got called as soon as I got home.


Couldn't wait to call it an early night at about 1230. That's an early night to me. 1:00 AM Yeah. Your boyfriend told you to go to bed. What? Your boyfriend told you to go to bed. He's like, we don't pop fireworks. I lit a bottle rocket outta your ass. I wish. No, it was lay now quite the opposite. It was a call from Brian Redband who never calls me. And so I knew it was an emergency. Yeah. In the middle of the night. And indeed you were arrested. Yes. I had to. The Stupid as shit Hum up here. Within minutes I was here. Yes, you were within I think three or four minutes with No underwear on that. You don't tell everybody.


Actually, funny enough, I don't think I was wearing underwear. I had a bathing suit on and yeah, I had been on the river all day. Yeah. And I got you out of being arrested. I got you. You did. Tony. I don don't even know if I can roast him anymore. He saved me from a night in jail, bro. I didn't wanna go to jail. That's True. Yeah. And to be a true hero. I had the night in jail in his place and I dropped the soap as often as I could. Let's Go to a clip. Joe Biden and Trump. Man, this is crazy to be around you two motherfuckers, man. It's the future. Hey Trump. I got a question you on on your debate the other day.


You said illegal immigrants are taking black jobs. What the fuck are black jobs? The illegal immigrants are being extremely loud on buses. They are all types of stuff that we said. This used to be blacks. Remember when this was black? So we liked it when they were black because we could dance and they were fun. And now the people that are Mexican are not fun Watching y'all niggas all night is crazy, brother. I've been up there laughing my off. It is unbelievable. David, believe it or not, is very much involved in politics.


Whatcha about to say? Well, that's just what I say. What's your stance on abortion? Ask Tony. He's had two. Wait, what does that mean? I don't know. You mean I had babies pumped inside of me? You one of them men that think it can get pregnant Like Junior with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yeah. Like That movie, right? Remember that? Remember that Jurassic Park five or whatever the fuck you said earlier. Trust me. That was a great joke. And the internet is going to prove that I made a great joke and that this room is tired and dumb.


A fun fact about David Lucas. He's so black and fat that he eats gay chicken. What? So again, these jokes really, maybe they are dumb and tired. They they're fucking, If they've been here for three hours, Tony, that's kind of like You. know the niggas you hold hostage. They ready to get out the fuck up.

And if there was ever a nasty woman like you underneath it, I'd say Move.

Yeah. The one with Jeff Goldblum? Yeah. Yeah. No, the second President. Biden, what do you say when you're about to come? He says, hi, I'm Dr. Phil. See me on the road.


It is a good time for me to mention that Joe Biden wanted me to say that I, that Adam Ray's new special is out on YouTube. It's called like and subscribe on Adam Ray's YouTube. Sounds, sounds, sounds, chewy, I. don Dunno. Sounds good. I check it out. Wait, I wanna know why. So that guy, who was that guy that you were impersonating? Who was the guy? Oh, every guy. How many is that? Not one guy came like a normal guy. That was normal. Oh, All right. Well let's what, what? But you keep going back to it.


Yeah. Because even the next one sounds the same and the next one sounds the same. Yeah. You guys can't get creative. Do you mostly hook up with Middle Eastern men? No. White, tall, white, younger men. Ooh, vegan. Hello. Remember You know. Ah, If I were to come, I would go, Ah, That's different. You should meet my son Hunter. He's he can fuck for hours nonstop. Lot of, lot of Capri Sun. Sherry, we've had a long show. We gotta put a ribbon on this. Thank you so much, Sherry.


Everybody there goes Sherry. Everyone. She's got the joke books. She's done it all Before we leave. I mean, there's only one more person that could possibly end an episode like this. You guys know it. I am very excited to see him tonight. Make some noise for the big red machine. This is indeed William Montgomery, everybody. We built this city on rock and roll. Bad news folks.


Do not enter this city. Extreme safety hazards are everywhere. Biden is ignoring everyone. Telling him not to run. Earlier today, he said, Hey pal, I was the first black female to spend time in a concentration camp. We can beat Adolf Hitler. Is it just me? Or if the dragons and ounce of dragons gotten sexier back in the nineties, I actually stumbled upon a famous running back murdering his ex-wife. And I pulled out a cigarette to take the edge off and he said, Hey, don't smoke kid. And I said, don't I know you from somewhere? And he takes his little glove off and says, I'm OJ Zenon.


That zen joke. Okay, that's my time. Thought. The zen joke might go a little better. What a shitty crowd tonight. Tony. I've been listening to you fucking pussies for fucking three hours or whatever it's been. I mean, They're pretty beat up. We've had a long, it's been an absolute chaotic, insane show. I don't really think it's their fault. don don't think there's many audiences that could handle this type of show with full energy. This is one for the books. They will say, William, this must have been kind of crazy. You were planning.


What's it like to be up here with the, I mean, It's actually really cool. I'm actually a huge fan of Donald Trump, so it's so weird. You are here tonight, sir. Oh my gosh. How are you? I thought you did A great job. I thought the Zen joke was incredible. Thank you. Yeah. No, that was a hell of a zen joke. I thought it would at least get something in the House of Dragons being sexier. I thought that was at least gonna get something. And So you were smoking a cigarette while OJ was killing his wife And then he's OJ Zin. Yes. I asked, he said his name. And it's OJ Zon. Right. So He's, but Simpson is hard to say.


That's where I messed up a little bit. I've been Going, he's sinning. That's why he told you to quit smoking. He tells me, he said, he tells me I need to start doing Zen. Don't smoke. Right. That's where I was getting out with the joke, but it obviously didn't really work out. And I have like 10 more at the Zen jokes I've been holding back. So this scares me. I have a bunch of Zen jokes in the chamber right now. Tony, they actually fixed our air conditioner. But it's a horrible problem now because now it sounds like an airport in our apartment. It sounds like a jet engine going off in our apartment now. So it's really cold, luckily, but it's just so loud in there now. Wow. So what are you doing to block out the sound?


I'm not doing shit, man. I'm fucking, that's why I was a little on edge tonight. And again, the house of drag is joke. I thought it was far funnier and it got no fucking love. So it almost makes me feel a little weird. Tony even to be in front of these fucking idiots tonight. I swear to God. I wasn't even feeling it tonight. It's loud as fuck in my apartment. And it's like all these pussies in the fucking audience. Well, at least you got to enjoy some peace and silence during your 60 seconds. Secondly, Are you gonna clap at that? You nasty looking slut. Oh My God. Is that really your fucking wife dude?


Yikes. Holy shit. That is so mean, William. It's like she wasn't clapping at any of my jokes and now she claps at the silent saying it's bullshit. What is that dinosaur in your arm? A fucking stegosaurus. A lot of dinosaur talk tonight. and you would think with all this talk they would understand Jurassic Park. Nobody understood Jurassic. I Know. That's really cute. History will look kindly on that joke. I have no doubt. Thank you President Joe Biden, what do you think about William? Montgomery? Oh, I love it. I love it. I I love it. You were a January 6th, right?


Yes, I was there. I took a private jet with my family, my parents. Yes. Good For you. Good for you. Family's important. What's your favorite thing about this country? William? I know you're a patriot. Oh. My, God. Probably just the good people over at Kellogg's. I recently tried something other than all brand Bud Stoney. It's the kind that looked like little shreds and it's almost, I think it's even better and has a little less sugar because last time Redband was telling me Aubrey Buds has a little too much sugar and oh my gosh, redband. Is that a haircut? It looks like I could see that fucking fat roll on the back of your neck. Even better now. Nasty motherfucker. Wow. God. Do your head back a little bit. Let you See that. Then you got him to straighten his head. Your Head back a little bit.


Yeah. It's so sick. It does look a little bit like a pussy, bud. Red man. Shit. It's a hot, it's it's, I like it though. Oh. My. God. It's your Oh. My. God. Yeah it is. There You go. What You talking about? No. Til your head back a little. Yeah. There it is. Oh yeah. You dirty bitch. Oh God. Thanks William. So William, you're trying new cereal. The AC is working. It is cold and loud in your place. You're not doing anything to block the sound. You're on a low sugar cereal diet. What else is going on, William? Anything else that you're passionate about right now?


Gosh. Stayed at the nicest hotel. There's some hotel called Hotel Cecilia. I had to stay there this past week. It was a wonderful pleasure. There's a table of women laughing and you seem mad at the laughter now. It seems like you've gotten Yeah, it's gotta, Seems like a weird place to laugh 'cause obviously nobody else is laughing. I shouldn't have even started telling that story and, and it's like, why did you fucking, why would you start? Oh, look at those girls. Is that what it's coming from right there? God, how long have you two been together? Are you, are you implying that they're lesbians? Yeah, looks like it. Or y'all not both. Dykes. Is that what's going on there?


It looks like a couple dykes at that fucking table. Tony. I can't even sleep at night. It's so loud in the fucking apartment. Dude, I'm really horribly on edge right now. I swear to God. And it's been a long episode. I'm just not feeling it. And it's like we got a couple fucking dikes. Fucking look at those fucking, If you need help sleeping, perhaps Joe Biden can give you some good advice, Joe. Sure. Anytime I try to, I have a tough time falling asleep, which is just about never, I lay in bed and I think of, I think of this set. So Joe Biden, I've been curious who's fucking calling the shots? We know you're the one not calling the shots. Who's calling the shots? Who's the puppet master behind the disaster?


This fucking Joe Biden right now. Seriously, let me know who's fucking controlling you right now, because we know it's not you. Are you done? I thought I broke my tooth. I Did. You break your tooth. That would be pretty awesome if you did. We would pay for it. Thank You. If it happened on the show, we would pay for it. He would. Well, I mean, yeah, we would take it out of the overall budget of the show. Y'all heard it? He's gonna fix my teeth. Well, when I get reelected. William, what are you gonna, what are you gonna do with all the money? Because there's a lot more covid money coming your way. Maybe some monkeypox money. Oh my gosh.


What would I do with that? What Would you do with 50 bucks tonight? 50 bucks tonight. Other than pay for them to fucking scissor in a hammock. Yeah. Are You guys really lesbians? No you're not. All right. Well, way to suck the energy outta the room. Million dollar question, William. I don't Know. Probably get some earplugs. I have to get some sort of good earplugs or some, I don't know, noise canceling headphones. So I'd probably do that. I mean it's literally, it's not good right now. So Million dollar question, William, both candidates up here. Hootie, who are you voting for coming this November? Well, actually when RFK Junior was at the shows in Los Angeles, he said I could be the press secretary.


So I'm RFK Junior all the way. He said I could literally be on his cabinet. So that's who I'm voting for. Wow. That is incredible. So I'm voting for so, and I'm probably never gonna stop Vote. Here you go. Okay, we're gonna put a ribbon on it. One of the longest episodes ever. My bad. What a great show. What an amazing show. A lot of people say this is one of the best shows that's ever happened. I do. Probably the best show. I'm not tired or have to piss incredibly bad. I'll tell you what, when you have to pee and that guy's fucking screaming, it really hurts. So Wrap it up please.
