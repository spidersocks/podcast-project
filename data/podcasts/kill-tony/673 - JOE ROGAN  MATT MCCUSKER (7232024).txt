I did the sunblock on my girlfriend and I didn't realize that my disrespect towards her sun blocking would show up that night. And so you could see how badly. Oh no. Oh no. She's white.


Yeah. So white man's burden, right? Was it a spray? Can you keep doing a spray thing? Yeah. Kind of was like Whatever. You just half-assed it, huh? Yeah. Damn. You didn't suck. Damn.

You look to me like, like I was gonna rescue you. The fuck outta here with that idea. Alright, nevermind. Did you ever, when they have a fever, man, it's You know, whatever. Is this a regular paddleboard You guys were in? Yeah, you got us both paddleboards. So you were separate. We, I tied us together eventually, but yeah, she was, she was going off on her own.


She's pretty fast. Wow. So you tied to the back of hers? Yeah, we, I tied front and back together. Well, Who was in the front? Well, it was side, we were just telltale. Nose. Nose. Just little ties. Tail, tail, bro. You get dragged. How the do you toast someone? Telltales. That's horse shit. That's like equity and towing. That shit's not real. If you gotta to somebody, they have to be behind you. You had the front, you had the front tied to Her. You can't fucking tow someone right next to you. Liar. You just lied, didn't you? She towed you. No, I just see that lady towing you.


What were the, what Was the positioning of these paddle boats? We were right next to each other. Bullshit. It was a rat. You it was a raft. They built a raft, bro. You did not Uhuh. Tell the truth, bitch. You were like, you got to, you were like that girl told you She did a lot of the work Buried Kim on the river Redemptions when you were with white Sophia. I still don't get it. Her boat was in the front. There was a rope and then the front of your boat was attached to the back of her Boat. No, no. It's side to side. Side by side. Like sitting on The same side as a restaurant. How Do you do that? Good. You don't do it. This is a lie.

We're gonna get it started tonight with 60 Seconds Uninterrupted by Robert Marbles. Everybody. Here we go. Robert Marbles. Thank you band. I'm, I'm not racist, but, or not, but actually I wanted to preface that by saying that I think there's a beautiful middle ground between racism not being racist and finding racism funny.


I'll give You guys an example. So it's easier to understand. I'm half American. I know that's a little bit of a curve ball, but I'm also half Arab. So to give You guys a good demonstration of a joke that could be kind of funny was As if, For example, I was baking a pie for you all. 'cause you're so nice and I think you all for coming out and, but instead of apple slices I had, I just used bombs. That's one example. I'm also, like I said, half blood. My parents both speak my dad's language.


They just never taught me. Which is, that's that's fine. And yeah, so I basically, when my mom told me that she was You know why she didn't teach me her mother tongue, she said it was 'cause she wanted me to have her mother tongue and Wow. Yeah. Robert Marbles even I, I mean, I do this every week and somehow I'm still shocked at how bad people can be every Monday. For 11 years I'm here. and you just blew my mind, Robert. You could have almost done anything other than what you just did.


And it would've been better than whatever the fuck that was. I've always wondered what a zero testosterone Kenny Powers would be like. This is unbelievable. Thank you. That was my first time. So give you some cards. Aw that the first time, are those are those tears I see behind those macho man Randy Savage sunglasses. What's up man? Oh no, this, did it not go how I thought it was gonna go? Oh no. Sad macho man. I love it. How old are you? Guess Okay, dude.

I know the mullet and the American shorts takes off some years. Jesus fucking Christ. Dude. Answer the goddamn questions. Yeah. Were you the guy that had to help Hans Kim untie his boats? Why do you look like this? You look like you're going to arrest yourself at some point. There's like a cop underneath this disguise. Thank you. Thank you. You'll never believe it, but you're under arrest.

Oh My God. Don't in am any friends. That's desecration of the American flag, by the way. That's a tough loss in those shorts.

Actually, when I was, when I was in high school, I did a magic show, like talent show and I, nobody could hear me. So I, I said something that just like made the whole audience laugh on, unlike today. What was it? It was like a, like a flow state thing.

And this guy famously was on stage eight times his first night ever on the show. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a brand new minute from Drew Nickens. So I don't mind dating girls with kids because I'm a child at heart.


But I am worried about finding a woman who wants to peg me because God damn it, I forget shit all the time. I forget she has a gag reflex. I forget to do the dishes, take out the trash, forget that she's got a clit. And I know anger is gonna build. And You know when you're pegging someone, it goes finger tongue, small toy, average white guy. And I know that she's not gonna follow the rules. There's gonna be candles, there's gonna be a romantic interest. And then we're gonna come in.


She's gonna go finger, she's gonna go tongue that She's gonna go right into fucking man dingo. Am I right? Oh man. And then she's gonna be getting me and there's gonna be some cracking sounds and then it's gonna, I'm gonna talk like finding Nemo Dory. All right. That's been my type pick. Y'all Drew Nickens.

But I guess you, since you've been famous for four weeks, life has changed.


I ain't talking About You. know there's a tongue, a finger, a small toy, a candle. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? Are you getting pussy now Drew?

Oh, so she slid in my dms and I was like, Hey, what do you wanna do? And she's like, well I like Taco Bell. And I was like, oh, I'll take the hint that's used the Taco Bell.

Amenity roof. A place where you take guys with brain injuries that are hanging out with you just so that your neighbor finds out in case you get of Mice and men in case you accidentally squeeze a nice girl's head in, in completely. Oh, I just got that. Wow. Oh man. You just can't make moments like that. That's incredible.


Oh man, I just got that. I was kinda wondering in the back of my head if you were getting it too, the Mice and men reference. 'cause there is two things that could have happened there. Yeah, but now I'm talking about how I wouldn't trust you with a puppy. Oh No, I'm kidding. How's life going? True. Talk about it. Oh Good. I, I quit my job. I'm doing comedy full time now. Awesome.

No. So you're just kinda like making up how you think it would be? Well, well, I feel like they want another kid. They would hook up with me. But like, I, I mean, I haven't gotten any play in a long time, sir. Imagine that. So I have to imagine a lot of things that would happen. How many cans of energy drank do you think you had today? Oh. Oh, we're on 600 milligrams a today, sir. A million.


My god. Drew. Alright, well, anything else we should know about Drew? How else are you feeling? What else is going on? Are you gonna have roommates in this new apartment? I'm, I'm looking to get something by myself like a little studio. But I, I'm hoping the roommates, I've had roommates most of my life, so it doesn't doesn't phase me. Right. don? Don't know. I'm just playing it by ear and hoping everything falls into place. Absolutely amazing. Have You guys seen Drew before? Matt? No, I've never seen him before. This is a, this is a treat.

Believe It. You were built for that fucking jacket and that jacket was built for you.


We might have found your new look, son. Oh, Mike. It could be cursed It could be cursed. No, you could break that curse. Actually. I actually have different intentions for this jacket tonight. Actually, look this, look this reminded me. Oh, My, God. Is it gonna explode? What race are you Different, different intentions for this jacket. What the fuck? Pull the string. We talked about this last time. I'm Italian. Bar me was my last name. Oh, we don't, we don't claim you. Italians don't want you to say you're Italian. From now on, you're Iranian. Jesus.

No, you didn't.


Why So hot in here? A good jacket. I think it looks cool. I took some gray pics with it in Colorado. You should see them. Are Are those man, are are those your glasses on your necklace? Or did you just meet a wacky jeweler before coming on stage? They're real, but I look better without 'em. So I just take, Well, let's see you with 'em. We wanna see your real self. We wanna see how God made you this. This is not made by God. It's made by, Oh, there he is. What a fucking dork. Oh man. You thought you could just take those glasses off and put on that jacket.


I identify as a different man. Wait, wait, wait. So like I said, I have different intentions for this jacket. When I bought it, it looked like Eddie Murphy's jacket and raw a little bit, right? Oh. My. God. When you bought it, it looked like that. What happened to it? Dude? No. That was the first thing I thought when I was watching you do your thing. I'm like, dude, he's like Eddie Murphy from fucking Life. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah, crazy. Except he's actually delirious. Right? But who? Who reminds us of Eddie Murphy lately? I mean, Kam Patterson. He's been killing it, Right? Yeah. Cant Kat Patterson. Yeah, he's really killing it out there. Great point. Unlike me, so unlike me, Deep Madness can only hear.


So he never misses a joke. It's a little fun fact. I was hoping I could give this to him, but only if he gets on stage. 'cause this is an expensive jacket. You Know. No, no, it's going to MATT. MCCUSKER. Okay. Okay. I'll keep the jacket. I'm actually glad you said that. I wanted to keep it. Okay, well keep it. There you go. It'll serve you well. Thank you, Joe. Wow. Damn. Perfect. Damn. The good news is, it's just the right color that when you blow your brains out, we can bury you in it and it's gonna blend right in with your brains. Did you get a little joke book last time? I'm guessing it's in the, It's actually in the jacket.


I believe it is another terrible answer. He just, he goes out the way he came in. Just absolute pure sadness. Nothing more, nothing less. No secret show, no joke book. I was originally going to offer you money for the jacket to give to MATT MCCUSKER, but I don't even want to do that. I could really use that. I just got back from Vegas You know how that goes.
