It, it, I I've been saying I wish that energy drinks like actually provided you sleep other than energy.

Well, we know what the anxiety disorder is. It's just a cocaine addiction. Yeah. No. And don't apologize to your mom about this. I take She saw your minutes.


So I take, I take Prozac, dude. My, You take Prozac? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You take Prozac and cocaine. Where does the energy go man? Even It out. I keep it inside You know. That's why, why I shake a lot and sweat. It's just a lot of energy going on. Internal combustion. Yeah. You know. How long have you been on Prozac, Hon? I, I started smoking and drinking a lot when I, I first moved here trying to like, fight the anxiety going on stage. And then I saw a psychiatrist. I was like, sobriety helps my stage presence a little more than like drinking and smoking. And obviously I'm still struggling with that.


Right. Yeah. You said you're high. Yeah. So how you went to the therapist? What, like five months ago? Ballpark? Yeah. Just about. Yeah. That's pretty Accurate. Tony, you've been here seven months. You said you wouldn't to a therapist, I'm just guessing. Yeah. Now you got, you got the track. You, you're Shocked like I'm a psychic or something like that. No, I, I'm not. I know how, I know you're Smart. And so you've been on Prozac for about probably maybe four months. And how long have you been doing cocaine? About? Like, oh, mean About the same. First time is a long time ago. Sure. But I'm talking about regularly here. Consistently. Like Consistently The past three, four weeks since That. Okay. So it's a new problem. I love this. This is good. This interview's going well.


It's a new solution. I don't know if it's a solution. Exactly. I'm not on it tonight, Tony. That's all I gotta say. You guys out of control. Probably Would've been a good night to do it. Oh, My, God Don drunk. Have you tried cleaning your damn room? Your fucking license? Jordan Peterson. No. Together. Wow. How About just being a model? You know, I, I remember, I I, I remember people didn't think I was funny when I started doing comedy as a teenager because everybody would tell me, Hey, you ever think about modeling?


Like that's, that's a good career path for you. They would never be like, Hey, that shit was funny. Like You know. And here we are. Yeah, here we are today. You. know what I'm saying? So like, when's the last time you did cocaine? Was it last night? Maybe. Okay. Are you looking For cocaine? Don't, no, no, no. I'm just curious. I'm curious what it's like for a guy like you. So you're working last night, right? Maybe. Okay. Enough with a maybe. So it's a yes. A actually no, the days turn into nights real quick these days. Okay, So two. So, so when do you do the cocaine? Who do you do it with? Do you do it by yourself? Do you buy it? I, I got buddies.


I, I'm friends with a lot of comics out here. Pretty cool. Not The question I ask. I When you do cocaine, do you do it by yourself Sometimes Tony? Sometimes, yes. Okay. So like the last time you did it, can You take us through it? The last time I did it, I did a bump by myself in the bathroom at Shakespeare's. Okay. So, alright. And that helps you get through the night, but then you drink Yeah. and you wake up and you're depressed. Yeah. and you take Prozac. Yeah. And then wherever the day takes you from there, maybe you do more blow, have some more drinks and then you take Prozac again.


Right. Riding the wave. Baby. Have you Talked to riding the wave baby Austin Powers Wonder, have you talked with your therapist about this new cocaine habit? A little bit. What do they say? They, they say as long as that he fucked. I, my opinion is that I'm not abusing any drugs. Ever since I started taking Prozac, I've been using drugs for fun and not to cope. And so yeah. New excuses.

Damn. How's it going everybody? My name is Leslie Chi. Just tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a single father. Been raising my son by myself now for 11 years. Now that's a long ass time to be doing something by yourself, right? So you probably wonder the same thing. Everybody keeps asking me where the mom at? And that's a fair question. And I love telling people the honest God truth. 'cause there's nothing fucking fun here. See, when my son was two weeks old, my baby mama, that bitch took off with a midget. That's not a punchline. This bitch actually took off with a midget. And to this day, I don't know what pisses me off more. The fact that she took off with a midget, or the fact that a midget was wearing cargo shorts. You ever seen the emo midget wearing cargo shorts? That shit will hurt your pride as a man.


I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Honestly. He looked like he was coming down on his shortcomings though. For real. But look on some serious shit though. My son, he's 11 years old, knows half the periodic table in the first 22 digits of pie. Not to pat myself on the shoulder, but I don't think I did too bad for a guy who failed the retarded class every year. Right? And look, this bitch had the nerves to call me back up after about a a week talking about the midget throwing beer cans at her and fucking hitting her with cans and shit. I was like, bitch, that sound like a short relationship y'all. That's been my time. Y'all have a blessed night. Wow. Well, jokes on her. The guy she left with Can't fly Delta anymore. Sorry. Fucking your ex-wife.

My first time was for the HEB Arena show. All this is on YouTube. I took and traveled from there with no gas, no food, no money. Told jokes the entire time just to get by at gas stations and shit. My car broke down five times in every fucking state. There was a person coming here to see the show on HEB with a ticket helping me to get my car fixed. And again, it's all on YouTube.

So how many times do you think you've driven from South Carolina to Austin, Texas to sign up for this show? Just gimme a Ballpark. Probably about five times. I also drove from South Carolina to the LA one again, Oh, My, God. Get no gas, no food, no money. Oh, My, God. Are you also on a no-fly list? I'm on a lot of different lists, but not that one.

What do you do for work, Leslie? I'm fully disabled. See, I'm legally classified as, this is usually where I lose people. So sorry, but I'm legally It's okay.

Tony. I've been telling everybody for a long time. I'm your wet dream dude. Like the story I see, I see how surprised and amazed this man gets when it, he hears a true story. But the problem has been that every single time you hear these crazy true stories, they only got like one or two of 'em. Dude, I got a fucking list of 'em. Oh, thank. Oh, And I, God fucking true. Every single one of them. Thank God that was a list. He pulled that out. It was like, oh fuck. He's Puerto Rican as well. The security guard back there. He had to pat me down.

So number one, my baby and mama took off with a midget. Again, all this shit's true. Number two, I ran away with a girl from the nuthouse. Number three, I married a girl. I had a spite to piss off my father. Now funny thing about this, somebody told me I spelled spite wrong and spelled spit.


SPIT. So, oh well number three, I married. Oh no, I already did that one. Fuck. Alright, number four. I was kicked out of a woman's house for beating my meat for four days straight. Hold on a second. Let's back it up a second. When you say that you married a girl outta spite in order to piss your dad off, you ready for this? Yeah. Alright. So I hate my father, dude. I like me and him always go at it, right? He fell out of a tree last year and I was like, fuck it. But so I was, all right, so What the make this your set. This is hilarious, man. Dude, I, I gotta, all these are true. Alright, so I was writing, I was You know how a steam mirror and when you steam in the bathroom and you can write shit on the mirror and shit.


Yeah, I was drawing pentagrams and shit. You know just so they would pop out and go I don't know the devil. And like, and so I was like, I want, I love seeing people's reaction and mainly fucking with people. And so he did what I like to call church hopping. And he went and found this Christian girl to come talk to me, to me about our Lord Jesus savior. And so that night I took her to the park and I fucked her. And like literally everything was going good for about three months. And then one night she looks at me and goes, I'm gonna go to the store and get some milk. And I was like, cool. Well, two weeks later we found her in a psychiatric wart the next day over sweater up and down. This is, this is a lot right here. I had to google most of this apparently the, apparently. And she was swearing up and down that Apache helicopters were landing in my father's backyard talking to her about the masons who apparently were after her because she knew that they killed her mother in some organization called the red Coat was at our wedding when we didn't even have a fucking wedding.


We eloped. We didn't even have rings. Tony, do You know what the fuck they give you when you ain't got rings? No Pipe cleaners. Mine was blue. Okay. Alright. What's next on your list? Alright, where was we? That was only number four, dude. Damn, you didn't make it far. We got 50 on here. All right. I fell asleep in one school and woke up in another school. I walked over a hundred miles just to get away from my family. The best way I can describe myself, dude is like the actual forest gum. Like for real. That's funny. Yeah. I stole my, I stole my mom's car when I was 12. I actually did that a few times. You ever been in a situation where you did some shit as a kid and then you grow up wishing that maybe they would've caught you just so you can brag about it?


Nope. And then you have to tell them I do all the time. Let's go to number six. Glad you had a normal fucking life. I was running a PTO ring. I just felt like running. Jenny was six at the time. Alright. All right. She like crack cocaine too. Crack cocaine, regular cocaine. That exact line. Weed. I told somebody the exact line and DJ J, her father didn't think it was very funny though. Huh? Keep going. What's next? Like the old Letterman top 10. This one, just number eight. This one just happened last year. I was shot several times with a pepper ball.


Gun fused with tear gas. That was by my aunt. Fuck you Tina. Anyway, Keep going. Number nine. Alright. All right. Fuck you Tina. Ooh, last year my father stole $30,000 from me. Fuck you again for that. How did you have $30,000? How did you make $30,000? Alright, so again, all right. So I've been institutionalized since I was five years old. All right. In and out for a long time. For six plus years until I was 18. And could say I'm no longer going back. Literally just so these motherfuckers can go, okay, he's not in the picture. We got a family, perfect thing. And when he gets out we get paid. So that's been pretty much my entire life. What was the question? Fuck you Tina.


Yeah. Fuck you. You Tina. How did you get $30,000? You saved It. Alright, so, alright. No. So I took, and I, I decided that I was gonna try and pursue comedy through welding. Right? And of course it took a lot as You do, right? A lot of people go to la a lot of people, New York, a lot of people just start welding in South Carolina. Well, I'm a single father, so I had to figure out how to do this and do that at the same time, of course. And so I was gonna do travel welding and get paid for it. Travel welding. Yeah. Interesting. And so anyway, for like four or five years, I wasn't accepting my disability. 'cause I thought that if you made too much money, then you're off disability. Apparently that's not the case. And they owed me money and me and my father, we got the same first, middle and last name.


And so he was like, oh, I'll take advantage of this situation. And so I ended up in a car. How you doing? You've been staring at me pretty hard. Oh, Nope. I'm not gonna Hurt anyone. I swear I'm, that's A psychotic episode. You're having, the person's just watching you. You're on stage right now. Everyone's looking at don't at you when you weld. Yeah. What's next on the list? Alright, bet. I've been a single father for 11 years. Yeah. I've been on more medication than any child should ever have to take. Ooh, you don't Let stop you for a second. Let's talk about this 11-year-old. Yeah. Where are they right now? Right now he's in a car with a, a friend mine, A red car under the bridge. Don't, we've see, don't Worry, the windows are up.


He's not gonna drown. Hold on. It's raining Right now. Hold on. Hold on. What? Yeah. All right. So we live in my car. Me my camera guy and my son, my camera. Wait, what? You have a fucking camera guy? Yeah. What? This is fucking awesome. Wait, what? Oh, we're all good at that. What you pay a camera guy? Nah, he, He was like getting kicked outta his place. And I was like, look dude, I've been coming back and forth here for four years trying to figure out best ways to live outta my car because I lost everything to Covid, dude. I lost my job, my house, my truck. And so I said, fuck it. If I'm going to struggle, then I'm gonna choose my struggle. But I'm damnit I'm gonna do comedy and I'm gonna be the best father I can be.


So fuck anybody who says you can't. So your 11-year-old is with a camera guy right now? Yeah, dude. Anybody who meets, anybody who meets this kid loves him. He's smart. He's not shy. He's, he's fucking outgoing. Literally, he knows half the periodic table in the first 22 digits of pie. I put a lot of time and effort into him. I've known I wanted to do comedy for a long time. 'cause if not for all these fucking crazy ass stories, why not comedy? Do you Have a squirrel? Does he go to school the 11-year-old or is he home school? Yeah, he goes to school right up the road. Dude that was first here in Austin? Yeah. Can he, well, it's in the backseat, but I thought you lived in South Carolina. I Did. How long have you been here? About Three And a half.


Three and a half months. About that Long? No. Unless some of this shit's new. Some of this shit's about That long right there. That's how long he's been here. Read away buddy. That looks like crazy. 50. You want me keep Going? That looks like, that looks like a hammock that Tyler sleeps in. Let's see, I forgot what number was on. Okay, give us an, give us an give us another one up there. All right? Sure. The, The end is just gonna be a Confession. Yeah. The number 14. You're Gonna like this one. You know what You know what? Screw the legs. So I'm gonna go back to some questions that I had. So you're the 11 year olds go. The 11-year-old goes to school. Yeah. You, him and your camera guy all sleep in your car every Night. Yeah.


Which it takes, if you actually think about it takes a lot of effort if you do it the right way. Like if you're seriously, if you're seriously trying to make sure that DSS, which I've already been tested four times, comes up to your car. You gotta have the receipts. You gotta make sure your car's clean. You gotta make sure he's clean. Dude, I only dress like this on Mondays. How, where do You guys shower at? Alright, so I got a membership with a y We also, there's organizations that help you out with showers and stuff. Like I said, for three years, I came out here scoping out everything to make sure it was possible. I wasn't nominated 2017 Father of the Year Award through South Carolina for nothing. Is that true? Yeah. You were almost the father of the year. Yeah. In South Carolina. Yes sir. Yes sir. Threw man to man in a Decade. Who won?

Do You perform other places sometimes to like practice for this or you just I've been focused on getting on KILL. TONY I've been taking, 'cause I, when I moved here, I didn't know nothing about comedy. I didn't know anything at all Whatsoever. I Didn't know a set from a bit, dude. Sure. Yeah. And so I basically told everybody, I was like, look, I'm going to use this as a, as a platform trying to figure out things i, I know and things I don't know to even try to ask about.


And so that's all I've been doing is watching your show, taking notes and figuring out, okay, how to make a joke. Where should I go and learn shit and shit like that. And that's, that's how I've been starting. Well, I mean, what can I say, Leslie, you are something else. Here's a book. What I'm gonna do for you is I'm going to give you a big joke book. Yes. And for the 11-year-old, I'm gonna give him a big joke book too. Yes. Oh dude, who's gonna love you? I'm gonna give you some zip picks. Nicotine toothpicks. I need those.

Hey, we still having fun? I got good news Ladies and gentlemen. We are done with the bucket polls. There's only one person that can close an episode like this and it is indeed the record holder for all time appearances, all time interviews. I mean, what can I say about him? He is the vanilla gorilla, the Memphis Strangler, the big red machine. This is William Montgomery. That lady literally just touched my dick when she walked past me.


On the way here, my girlfriend and I pulled up to an intersection and there was a homeless guy wearing a Nirvana shirt and my girlfriend rolls down the window and says, name four songs. Dumbass. My agent called me the other day and said he thinks there might be a World War iii. And I said, great. Could there be a part in it for me? But then I started thinking about it. I think the last thing we need is another Hollywood reboot. What's harder finding? Where's Waldo? Or going to a rap concert and trying to figure out which one on stage is the wrap.


It's like they're all kind of wearing the same thing on stage, but they're not. Okay. That's my time. Fuck. Yeah. William lights out. Montgomery. Hell yes. Welcome William. So nice to be here. Tony. I love It. God, my throat is really hurting right now. I'm a little worried. I don't know. Please, somebody needs to please. Maybe one of y'all knows, but I wonder, I've been drinking so much honey. Recently I've been drinking so much throat coat tea with honey. I literally, I will drink a full bottle in two nights. I just wonder if you can have too much sugar and honey.


Yes. Can you? Yes. What happens if you have too much honey, you die. Why don't you look it up? Look up a maximum amount of honey Diabetes. This isn't The answer. You've had a sore throat for absolutely months now. It's horrible, Tony. I'm not even kidding. I think I've done something weird. And hold on. Who is that guy That is On the guitar? I, he's been weirding me out. Red band. Do You know that guy at all? I actually Have no idea. That guy is, that is indeed Sean Greenberg joining us tonight. He absolutely rocked it out earlier during the pre-show. I was up there watching.


He's a freak of nature. Cool. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Sean. I mean, I just had never seen him before. I've never noticed it before. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about him? These good? Hold on. Can you do something else? That was cool. Something else? Cool. Yeah. What Else you got Sean? Let's fucking flex over here a little bit. Sean Greenberg while, while he plays guitar. You know what Sean? Hold on a second. Let's do something fun while you wail on the guitar. I'm gonna name some of the side effects of having too much honey. And here we go.


Wheezing And asthmatic symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness. Excessive perspiration. Fainting, irregular heart rhythms. AKA arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease. Stinging after topical application. Play. Keep playing. Cool things Sean, like change it up a little bit. There. you go stinging. After topical application, it's to be used as a natural sweetener, cough suppressant, and topical product for minor sores and wounds.


Giving honey to a baby under the age of one year can cause a rare but serious gastrointestinal position called infant botulism. Caused by explosion to CLOs, botulism spores. Bacteria from the spores can grow and multiply in a baby's intestines. Producing a dangerous toxin. Killed two birds with one stone there. You got to hear Sean Greenberg. And the side effects of having too much hunting after studying all of this.


Sean, can you play behind your back? Because that all sound pretty. Can you really play behind your back? Can you play it behind your back? No, he doesn't do that. He likes to keep it all in front of him. So do you heard the side effects of having too much honey? Does any of that apply to you? I it's, it's Tony, you're gonna, you're gonna hate me right now. Oh boy. You have instant, Guess what I've been doing? Yep. What have you. What have you been doing? Oh boy. You're going to, okay. Seriously, just Do it.

No, there's just, seriously, every now and again, I'm like, hold on, this person's trying to trick me right now.


And they've all happened to be for those ones. Okay. So other than Call of Duty, what else have you been doing? William? That's about it. You, we saw each other at the airport. I know. We saw each. Yeah. That was the day I got banned. Really? Yes. Right. A that was the flight that I tweeted the pin. So You saw, did you get Banned too? Huh? I got banned from Delta Airlines. So you saw him? Yes. And then you got on your Delta flight? We Saw each other about 50 times. 'cause we had to go through the TSA precheck. So we had to make conversation. Imagine that about 50 times we did it. We did pretty well. I know. And then I got banned from Delta Airlines about 10 minutes later.


So It's like a Seinfeld episode. We're just bringing it full. Sir. Let me, let me ask you this. When you got on that Delta flight Yeah. You saw the flight attendant walk by you? Yeah. Right.

That was No, it's good. It's great. I'm just curious about it All fired up. Yeah. I took a photo and I, and I posted it and I, I actually deleted the photo because somebody's, her face was in it. Ah.

I took a a photo and tweeted it later on and banned for life. Gotta be careful. Yeah, I know. That Happens to people. William's always very well behaved on airplanes. What's the craziest thing you've ever seen and on an airplane? William, do you have any memories? Honestly, Tony? Yeah. There was a time we were, it's been so scary recently because Yes, you're, you're technically correct, Tony. On Sundays I'm not doing anything, but I generally sleep an hour to three. So I have to nap.


I have to nap or it's, I'm not doing good. And it was so scary. I started on these early flights. I started having these nightmares that I ime I find myself in the actual airplane and the airplane starts crashing. And Tony, there was one one day where it was when I was opening up for your ass and you were sitting in front of me and it's like, I wake up and I'm on the plane and I see you looking out of the window and like rain starts coming in. 'cause there's a some issue with the plane and just sounds like a Delta flight. But that was a scary one. So now I can't go to. Right. Alright, so all the yelling, it's like over because your throat's always sore.


Have you gone to a doctor for this? No, I don't have health insurance. What do you mean you don't have health insurance? I don't have health insurance. William, you are rich. I'm 37. Why do you pretend like And I'm rich? I mean, I think that could mean all kinds of things. Yes. I mean, I've, I'm currently think the Lord above. I don't have any debt or anything, but I don't know. I mean, I think it's very much so all relative about somebody spending. I think there's all kinds of stuff that goes into that I don't know. Yeah. Things think the Lord have been all right. I mean, again, get a, a Christmas cameo from me.


I mean, they're wonderful. Get rid of those. But it's a great ad. It's just been a hard, and now it's raining outside and I gotta go play some more Call of Duty. I don't even wanna play it anymore, Tony, but I'm gonna be playing it all night long tonight. Yeah. I all night long tonight and it's gonna be raining outside and I roll up some little joints and sit by the television and start talking shit and start some of the fucking little people on the fucking Love It.

Rusty Clark, an army and Air Force veteran needed treatment at a VA hospital. Meet his wife Juanita. We live Above Morgantown, West Virginia. That would take us about seven hours to get here. And I was prepared to sleep on the hospital floor beside of Mr. Clark. But the Fisher house opened up that door. We had a lovely suite to stay in. We had food to eat. We didn't have to worry about that because the Fisher house, the foundation, Mr. Mrs. Fisher took care of all that years ago following their dream to make our reality that we were together and we could be treated here. It's a great blessing. Meet Rusty. I was in the Army Guard and then I went into the Air Force and then I met Juanita.
