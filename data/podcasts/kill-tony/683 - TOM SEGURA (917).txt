Go ahead and answer. All right Tony, I'm just fat enough to be able to answer this question accurately. The Whataburger chicken is better and the the In-N-Out burgers are better.

Were you expecting it? Were you surprised? Tell us a little bit about the insight. 'cause we didn't get too much into detail about it.

A very polarizing figure. Made a golden ticket winner just a few months ago. This is a brand new set from Drew Nickens Having a TBI in this platform. I want you to know if you work hard and you stay kind, you can achieve any dream you want. Right? Well I wanna accomplish like the ones before me. I'm talking about Gary Busey. Talking about Aaron Hernandez. Talking about Chris Benoit.


But I'm not a murdering TBI. I'm a childlike TBI. If you can't tell, I've stayed in mental health facilities. It's the one place where I'm the most normal guy in the room. I like the ones that are mixed with drug rehabs. 'cause it's like kinda like a Taco Bell and KFC and plus druggies gotta eat 24 7. So I get all the Razor brand crunch. I've never had a girlfriend, but I did date a multiple personality. Lola, she hated me.


Carol. I loved me. I had a girlfriend four hours a day. Yay. Until Carol I got healthy. All right, thank y'all so much. Abta. True. Nickens with another new minute. You know one of the main things and You know, sometimes people say that my hearings, I mean I, I don't have great hearing. I've been listening to loud music my whole life. But You know sometimes they're listening to a cleaner version of the audio than what we have here. And they go, how did they not hear? It's so blatant. Why they, why'd they say what he say? But I'm here to tell you, I have no idea. Were you saying TBI? Yeah. TBI. Traumatic brain injury.

And people will be like, yep. And then you're in. Because if the setup, if the setup isn't clean and clear, then the everything else is off track. The payoff at the end, no matter how great your punchlines are, are rough. Make some noise. If you honestly knew what a TBI was. Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar.


Shut the Fuck up. Yeah, but they, they're probably no people with TBIs. Yeah, Exactly. But also you can, you can say it once the long form and say, or as we call it, TBIs. And then you have that for the rest of your set. Right? Okay. Yes sir. Yep. Yep. We're making Drew grow here. It is. It's, it's a fun thing to watch. What Was the TBIs? The TBI? Yeah. Can you explain a little bit what or is that uncomfortable? So I'll explain a little bit. I had a collision with something and it made my brain go, whoop, whoop.

Thank you very much. My name's Mike Ivy. Thank you. It's so stupid. But it was, it did make me laugh a lot. There at the end, the possessed Chick-fil-A customer. Mike Red Band had a real fucking, I mean, just abruptly just furious. Because he is our senior fast food correspondent. And it is an extremely well known fact. And I think You know where I'm going here. You're looking like you're trying to think or be curious. But You know. I understand You know exactly where, where I'm, I understand Wendy's going, don't you? Wendy's? No, No. There's a Chick-fil-A two and a half blocks away from here.


Oh, I know. In fact, breaking News, Michael Gonzalez, will you hold that up? The entire crew ate Chick-fil-A before show You Goddamn right. You goddamn right. Because Jesus is Lord. That's right. I'm sorry, but No, you're right. No, Jesus is Lord. But You know. Have you all, how long have you lived in Austin? About three years. About three years. And You know. So there's a way to get into that same thing by saying that it's right here down the street. Have you ever looked for a Chick-fil-A No. Yeah. I was gonna do another joke, but then I didn't have any water back there. And that joke requires me to do a lot of breath work. And I'm not gonna do that. The joke that you were gonna do requires you to do a lot of breath work.


Yeah. There was no water back there. No water back there. Really? There's, There was, hi. Heidi had a liquid death back there. But I didn't wanna do that. 'cause that would be a creepy and my dream. So I was like, Wait, that would be what? Heidi Had a liquid death back there. And I was like, can I have that liquid death? And then it was like, I think that's Heidi's. And I was like, I want it so much. But no, I see. Yeah. It was an already open can of liquid death. She kissed it with her mouth hole. I don't think that that actually happened. It's true. That is a fact. I did not lie. She, you saw her kiss. There's a liquid death back there. I said, can I have some of that liquid death? Because I'm ingenious. Who did you ask? I asked the guy who's the p the the, the assistant back There.


and you're like, can I have some of that open liquid death? I asked for water first and then they were like, I don't have any water. And I'm like, goddammit, I don want some water? 'cause I wanna do my joke. And there was a liquid death there and I'm like, can I have that liquid death there? And they were like, that's Heidi. So I was like, oh, that'd be super creepy. There's not a few cans of water back there in case someone that just ran across the street loses their fucking money. Oh God. I got somebody fired. No, it's a good thing to have that. If we don't, sometimes I have to go through it. I'm sure it's worth it. We have a can of water anywhere. Oh, here it comes. Ladies and gentlemen make some noise for Little Christie. Everybody. One of the Oh My God. Adorable squad members here. Yoni's right hand woman. Here's a fresh can of liquid death.

I did the Chick-fil-A joke. It's been doing well. So I was like, I'll do the Chick-fil-A joke.


Whatever. That's what I You know. But you Normally do that joke in a city that does. 'cause your setup was they gotta have a chick.

Okay. and you said you did the Chick-fil-A joke because you were doing good. Is that what you said? No, no. I did the Chick-fil-A joke. 'cause it was my backup joke.

They're they're, they're, they're big and they're intimidating. And I think if they were, if they could, if they could speak like English, they'd say bro, a lot. And I don don't, I don't don don't get along with the, the moths here. They're, they're just, they're way too big and they're just too much.


Okay, so look, I am, I came here to the, to cleanse my, the la out of me. I grew up in LA and it like, it's gonna be a rough road, but when I was third grade, my, my teacher used to force us to watch his acting reel. And he did, he did not have any lines. He just, he had like a thick mustache and hair plugs and we just kinda look where he goes. and you. Okay. I watch Ladies and gentlemen Pat Batista here with the Austin Moth report.


Pretty sure what you're seeing are bats. Pretty sure those are bats. What's up with that way? I saw a big moth. You saw a big moth, perhaps a butterfly. It was a Moth. How do You know? It's a moth. Talking to the tip of that microphone. Okay. It could have been like a baby owl, but it was big. It, it looked moth. Like You know it was the same color. There's huge moths out it for sure. There's some big moths. Yeah. I see 'em all. Like one, like this big look like a little hummingbird almost. Where do you see these moths at? Up north? Yeah, up north. Yeah. It's crazy. On the outside of your window.

They don't like, you're, you Don't even carry that. Are you getting bullied by moths? Dude? Yes. This fucking guy. It's unbelievable. These fucking people. Yeah. What do the moths ever do to you? What do they do? Don don't know. They just don't, I don't like their attitude. They just don't, they don't move. They're just like, you're there. And they don't even like get scared. They're just like, yeah, I'm here. I don't like moted. I I kicked the ass. But they, it looked like a blood, like a murder scene. If you hit, You've killed one before.


No, I Was You know. I, I don't know. It's big. They're big. I don't You know. Killing a moth is bad luck. Oh, Is it? Yeah. It's 10 years. Bad luck. Especially if you're Filipino. What, what ethnicity are you? Filipino. Yeah. Damn. That's terrible. I I cannot believe that you are Filipino. That is shocking to me. Even though you're built like Manny Al's left leg. This is amazing. How long have you been trying standup comedy Pat? It's about 10. It's about 10 years. Whoa.


Whoa. No way. 10 years. Are you kidding? Yes. Okay. How long have you been doing standup? Let's just answer honestly for me. 10. It's been about 10 years. Start talking like a fucking moth dude here. I'm, I know I'm really big. No, I'm killing me. Pat. Pat Batista, please show me some mercy. Alright, 10 years. Where have you been doing it for 10 years In la. Oh Yeah. It's, that's where, Where in la The comedy store. Open mics. Where at? Yeah, the comedy store. I Mean, for all we know you could be a main room regular at the Comedy store right now.


Are you on the Market way things Are going? Okay. That's only funny to us. All right. KILL TONY. Yeah, That's, I did KILL TONY. And you did KILL TONY three Times in a row. And then the fourth time I was too. Well, no, that was the third time. It was. I was too messed up to Get up. You were too messed up to Get up. What, what happened there? Comedy store weed. That it surprised me. And then I went into the parking lot and I just stayed in my car. 'cause I didn't, I thought the windows were don don't know. I just couldn't. And I was really stoned. I, something surprised me because You smoke weed before this set.


Huh? You just, you smoked some weed before this set? No. You, you, you sound like a the police. Yeah. Well, I just want the You know the answer. Yes, I did. Okay. All right. Cool. But I couldn't handle the ones that I, yeah, No, no, because it is, I I actually think it's obvious. You've been on stage a lot. You, you, you're very comfortable on stage. But then when you were just like, I'm gonna talk about moths, I was like, Okay. Like I didn't know how it worked. I didn't know if, if I get out and just go to my jokes. So I just went with whatever was In my head. You said that you've done this show three times before in Los Angeles.


That Was Years ago. The format has never changed. Not for a single episode. So when you say you didn't know, what do you mean? I I, it's been a while, so I don't really, I don't Remember. You watched the show, Don don't I didn't remember. Yeah. When I was out there And you heard other people before you, right? You were back there. Yeah. But you didn't know. I I got a little a DD and so I don't, certain things don't soak in the brain. My brain Sometimes. Do you only do stand up high? Be honest. No, I just start. Well, I mean I, yeah, lately I'm trying to stop.


That's the reason why I'm like, You're trying to stop a what? Comedy? No, Weed. Weed doing com. Doing, doing comedy Weed. Weed. Doing comedy. Yeah. I believe Cam said that earlier. You might have know too much weed doing comedy. We'd be doing comedy. Yeah. So Pat, yes. I mean, so many questions. The longer this interview goes, the more questions I have. What is it? Why is it so hard for you to wait until after you're set to smoke marijuana? Why not do your work and then reward yourself? It, it's stressful. Oh, waiting now. There You carry. But I, I'm gonna change because I'm That's the plan.


Definitely. No, I am. Yeah, you gotta channel you, this was just the week. You gotta channel some of that nervousness and anxiety into the performance and don't numb it with anything else. Exactly. Just do the set and deal with the, the nerves and the anxiety and, and all the stress. And then when you get off stage, do it. You'll probably find it like hits way different that you do that. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's no question about that. True. Cheers with that. Taking it head on. No, that's because You, you would have a clear head about like the set you were gonna plan out for this and you stay focused on it and you come out, do your set and you'd be tight. 'cause you, you, it's obvious. I can tell that you've been on stage a lot.


I could tell like the other fucking fucking lunatics that were out here. I could tell, I could tell they came from the bus stop and I could tell that you've been on stage a lot. But that's the problem. Like You know a lot of the guys we start with like, they would always do like, do shots or drink. And if it becomes like a crutch for it to deal with it, then it eventually becomes too much You. know what I mean? It overwhelms the performance. Right. So you just, I mean you're, you're, you're you're savvy guy. You're funny. You're naturally charismatic. You're very funny. Thanks. So just, yeah, just smoke weed when you're done, dude. Yeah. When do you start smoking weed? No doubt about that.


You must listen to what Tom just said. You've been doing it 10 years and I literally thought when you said I've been doing it 10 ti I thought you were gonna say times. 'cause the last two guys have done it 20 times and you're worse than them. Hey, sorry. I know moths be scary and all, but I mean, you just didn't have me really? But the weed, the weed is why you're like, I'm a like fucking these moths are crazy. Like Yeah, Exactly. That's why You did that. What the fuck? Oh, My, God. That Was fucking Completely. And then you didn't even get to your set 'cause like your set was starting to go, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. When do you start smoking? Do you, first of all, can I take a guess here? I'm a long time stoner, but I wait.


I tend to wait at least until after I'm done with work. Can I take a wild guess here and say that you smoke out of a water bong? Am I correct? No. That's what got me addicted was the water bong. Right. During the, during lockdown. That's what got me ice. Okay. What did you smoke today, for example. Got it. What did you smoke today? A joint. A blunt? Yeah, joint. It's a very easy question. It's a joint. Joint. Okay. A joint. Somehow. I was like thinking about strands and Fentanyl. It's okay. Where were you when you smoked this joint? Stick with me here, pat. Very easy questions. Literally couldn't be an easier question.


Where did you smoke the weed today? Were you in a car, were you out back? I was out back here. You were just out back here. Did they already tell you that you were going up and then you smoked? No, I was before. I've been waiting out there for a while. I didn't Think. Yeah, no. I know. I was gonna get, I know. Yeah. Signups started four hours ago. Yeah, I know. That's when you started smoking. Yes. And when's the last time that you smoked weed? If you had to guess about an hour ago, two hours ago or then four hours ago when you got here. Probably like an hour ago. Yeah. You smoked a couple times? Yeah. Just in case. Yeah. It was just not, I didn't not, I not think I was gonna get picked. I really did Not. I did not think I was going to get picked.


I hear a little bit of that. Filipino, what do your parents do? What nail salon do they work at? Am I correct? No. Okay. What do your parents do for a living? My parents. My mom's dead. Oh, Damn. So she's, that's her job. Wow. Yeah. That is a full-time job. That's funny, dude. That's, that's what, That's very funny, bro. Tom is spot on. You're a funny guy. Yeah. You just need to not, and The other reason, the other reason that you gotta do it after is that if you start to rely on it, the shows get bigger and bigger. The pressure gets higher and higher.


And so, like, if you're doing a fucking huge theater and arena, you don't wanna have to be like, oh, I gotta, I gotta get it. You know I'm used to smoking before that. It's gonna overwhelm you You. know what I mean? Right. So you, you gotta, you gotta perform. I mean, I know some people do perform sober, dude, perform sober. Get high in the morning if you want to get high when you get off stage. Right. Well, There you go. That's why I've been telling Redband to not drink before the show for 11 and a half years. Everybody swears he needs it. Can't go. Wait. What about dad? He told you Mom. Yeah. Mom's dead. What about Dad? Mom's dead. She died from nail polish poison.


There was no nail polish. How did mom die? That's Vietnamese, I think. Wait, what'd you say? Vietnamese Doing Nails. What'd you say? Nails. It's like a more, a Vietnamese, Korean thing. Shining. That's right. Your mom was a nurse, right? No, my mom was like a white American mixed. Okay. Chick. So she was a secretary. Oh, okay. That makes sense. A white woman job. White woman Job. And your dad, what Was your dad? My dad works for L-A-X-L-A-X? Yeah. Okay. At the airport. Alright. Okay. What does a Filipino man do at LAX? Baggage? Oh, trafficking. No, she, he does the baggage.


Yes. There's A fucking Filipino guy in charge of directing the traffic at, at LAX. Get, Get him. No wonder I'm stuck on the jet way for an hour and a half every time. Oh, wait, going That way? No, this way. This way? No that way. Shit. I fuck up. Oh. My. God. Is that a Moth? Oh no. An Airplane. I'm sorry. Airplane. I thought you were big. Crazy moth. If your mom is white, your dad has to be 180% Filipino. By the way, how you ended up looking like this? Yeah. Is my dad. Yeah. My dad.


Oh God. I kept you up here. Wait, how long are you in town for? Oh no, I'm staying here. I live here now. You know. I'd love to give you five minutes on the Secret show. Are you fucking serious? You're giving him five minutes? I and the 22-year-old guy that kills every time. You know. I I love the moth material. I, I, Yeah. There you go. I want you to Check his eyes first before he gets, Before I let you go. 10 years of standup. Yeah. You gotta have something better than all that moth stuff.


How many you think we should hear his best joke that he's ever written in his entire life? Ladies and gentlemen. Woo. All right. Red band. Very smart. Yes. I love what he's pitching to me. Red band says if this joke sucks, you don't get to do the secret show. Oh Man. Oh man. But how about this, if it goes good, you get six minutes of the secret show and an extra six seconds. Ladies and gentlemen, 10 years in the game. Here he is with his best joke ever. It could be as short or as whatever is you want. He's really, you could tell he is still trying to think of what his best joke he's ever written is. Ladies and gentlemen.


Stoner, the son of a traffic director and a dead white woman. Ladies and gentlemen. This is the best joke in 10 years of Pat Batista. Wow. That that one was my top one. Okay. I'm gonna need some money if, if you go to only filipino monkey feet.com. I I, I got really long toes and I got some, I got some bangers.


I got the one where I got holding a banana with my big toe and then And then me. And then me climbing a tree. Right. And then since it was tax season where I wrote this joke, You know those cute little calculators on nine 9 cents store. I got that on the big toe. And then my W two's on the next and then the rest receipts with the caption. I came prepared. So if you got that monkey feet money, I got you. I'm pretty sure this guy's doing six minutes on Thursday. Good enough. The crowd laughed.


You should have ended it a minute sooner. But there he goes. What do you, all right. Jesus Christ Almighty. It's got little monkey hands too. Pat Batista. Alright. That was fun, huh? I think there's only one way to end an episode like this. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a long awaited return. This guy was out of commission last week. I'm sure he's back. Just a bundle of energy. He is a KILL TONY Hall of Famer. He is the record holder for all time appearances and interviews and the history of the show.


Fresh off of more sold out shows. The man is an absolute machine. In fact, he is a big red machine. Indeed. I present to you the Vanilla gorilla, the Memphis Strangler, the Tijuana tornado, the Vienna vaginal vortex. This is Lights Out William Montgomery. So, and Tony Tony. Just for the record, I'm high as fuck right now, man. Holy shit. Big congratulations to Lizzo.


She is now focusing on her health and has lost half of her body weight. Lizzo, I'm sure it feels so much better to be walking around at 450 pounds. You big ass bitch can't stand you. Bitch. Somebody told me that Hall and Oats broke up. I didn't even realize they were dating. I thought you would like that. Maybe Tom. Shit. Hey Tony, what do you commit when you quit smoking cigarettes and start using pouches? Infidelity. Look, I'm not saying Redband has Monkeypox, but why is his fiance now calling him Honky Kong?


Okay, that's my time. Hell yes. 55 seconds of thunder and lightning. Only he can do it quite like that. Calling Lizzo a straight up Bitch. Yeah, she is nasty. But she is losing weight, so I'm really happy for her. It's gonna add add. It's gonna add years to her life. Wow. Because the past, she was on, I mean that fucking nasty fat bitch, she was probably dying in don don't know, three fucking years or something. But this will probably at least extend her life. I don't know. 15, 20. So, oh, be good. It seems like she's real successful right now. So Tom, it's so nice to see you.


It's great to see you buddy. To see you. Tom actually took me out. It's the one time I had asked for so many years if I could open up for people and Tom, you were the first kind soul to say yes to me. So I still thank you so much for that. Absolutely. And it happened at a KILL TONY show. It happened. Yes. The only time on KILL TONY at worked. Yeah. We had fun, man. That was a good time. Yeah. I used to hang out with that Filipino dude all the time at the comedy store. We used to do cocaine and drink together. Really? That's not a lie. Yes. So I was getting Is that true? Yes. I used to get fucked up with, I don't, I forgot his name. don don't even know his name. But yeah, we used to get fucked up all the time at the comedy store. Really? You and Yes. I was a mess. I loved it. I love Filipino people. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


You really did cocaine with him? I think we did. Yeah. There were a number of people. Tony. I would end up being up all night on Monday nights and just going to do blow at different people's apartment. And they were probably lucky I didn't kill them or I was lucky I didn't get killed. don don't know. A lot of people could have been killed in that scenario, but nobody was. You were a wild boy back in the day. I don't think people remember and You know. We've grown a lot the last couple, few years. I don't even think these new fans know what you used to be like. Yeah. I don't think they realize for just a little, little insider baseball. Every kelton you've ever seen me at, at the comedy store, I was high on cocaine in my vodka Sprite.


Every single KILL TONY appearance at the comedy store. So you look, I guess scratch all the advice that I gave. This worked out great, man. Yeah. Except this guy hasn't really laughed at anything. don don't know what his fucking issue is. He looks like a fucking little twink over there. He got the little twink table over there. Other than that. And that little fucking pussy right over there. Did you think I didn't see you so you fucking idiot. Did you think I didn't see you? Tom is, I look up to Tom, so don't fuck with me when he's up. You on the stage. Dumb ass. You must be one of the idiots talking shit or something. I can tell just by you're not. Wow.


This guy's been laughing the whole time, William. It's Oh, has he? Yeah. It's crazy that you would attack Him. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I apologize. Seriously. I'm sorry. That guy right there with the long hair and glasses hasn't been laughing at all though. Oh, there he goes. He started smiling after he got Attention. Yeah, he looks pretty strange down there. Have you not been having fun, sir? Huh? I've been having laugh. What? Yeah. I could hear you. Dumb ass I don. I was just trying to see if I could actually get you to keep on repeating yourself like an idiot head.


But yeah, Tony, it is so nice to be back. Yeah, I'm sorry I missed out. I wasn't feeling it. And my voice even right now is totally wrecked. So we'll see. I at Mall of America this weekend, Tony. So really looking forward to Mall of America. What are your plans at the Mall of America? Probably get on my roller blades and skate through that motherfucker. Like Mighty Ducks. I think I'm gonna go through it like the Mighty Ducks. That's my goal. So I Gotta Is that where they were set out of? I think? Is that true? Were they in Minneapolis? Yeah, I think. Right. Rap band? I think so. I think So. Yeah. Yeah. Red Band. Our senior Mighty Duck correspondent.


Wow. So the Mall of America. I've never been to the Mall of America. I've heard about it a lot. Have you been there? Oh yeah, I've done a couple of weekends there at the House of Comedy. Awesome place. You did? Yeah. There's rollercoasters in the middle of it and stuff. It's Fucking people showed up. Yeah. Wow. When was, when was this? When were you headlining The Mall of America? Like five years ago. Wow. Oh shit. What the hell is that? Oh, that's a, yep. No, I love it. Amazing. So what else is going on? William? Tell us more.


Oh man. I'm just Tony. I don't know. I think I'm, I'm very soon. I gotta figure, I gotta, I gotta chill for a little bit. I feel like I'm, the comedy's going wonderful. I'm feeling very strong about the comedy as strong as ever. But I'm feel, I gotta take a little break here soon. I have to take some sort of a break. Tony. I'm getting burnt out a little bud. Is that funny? What's kind of funny about that? You can only imagine what I'm going through right now. You dumb motherfucker. You can only imagine what's funny about that. Seriously? What was funny about that? Just my, the idea of me struggling or something. and you take a little break. Is that, what was funny about that? Huh? Is that what was funny? Me kind of struggling a little bit in my life. Yeah. Oh my gosh.


Thanks sir. Thanks. You fucking idiot. Look at you. You look quite God. William. Have you been on the road a lot? Is that what I have almost every weekend? It's been wonderful. Oh, so you've been gigging a ton. I have been a lot. Okay. So you're kinda getting burned out from the road. Yeah. No, it's normal. It's wonderful. But I just have to take a little breath. Yeah, that's normal. You should. So we'll see. Good man. But it's been a lot of fun. And please, if you have a birthday, get a cameo please. But those takes are taken, they've continued to take over my life. I've now done over 7,200 of the motherfuckers. He's literally one of the big So sweet of people. Money. Money makers on all of cameo. What? How much is a cameo?


I end up seeing around don Don't know. A hundred bucks. They're a hundred bucks a piece. So do the math on that. You a little pussy. You think that's funny? Yeah. How, how mu how much is each cameo? I Think it's 1 55. I was just getting so many. I've continued to have to do the price up. I was, it's, I was getting a hundred, I was having a hundred to 150 at a time and it's, that's daunting. That's when I start feeling like I'm going crazy. According to red band's calculations, you've made $1.1 million. No. Cameo takes way More than That. No, it's nowhere near that. But, 'cause it's not always, that's not always been the price, but that's just what it is Right this second. Holy shit. So you don't really need to do any calculations for Redband.


I think it'll be hard for you to figure out what I have actually made. Oh, 69. Wow. Red band. Now William, one of the things that I find so interesting about you in real life, and this isn't brought up on the show very often. Yeah. But you're a very thrifty guy. I find you to be kind of like a You know. I wouldn't say smart with your money. It's kind of interesting 'cause you do make vast sums of money. You do not. You do not spend it much at all. You could tell by the pretty frug frugal tonight I've just been losing Ma la mass sums of money on the stock market.
