Over 250 comedians signed up for the chance, hoping, praying that they get a minute on this stage.


Some of them inside the room, most of them at a bar across the street. If I pull their name out, we send a Wrangler to go grab them from across the street. They drag 'em backstage, take the guns and knives out of their pockets, and then they come up, get 60 seconds uninterrupted You know their time is up and near the sound of a kitten. They have to wrap it up then, or else they bring out the Angry West Hollywood bear, which interrupts them. And then I interview them and we have a bunch of fun. We figure out other things about them that make them interesting and what could possibly be funny about them. People can make a a huge, they can have a huge career off of having a single great minute and interview on this show, but for the most part, people are retarded and get embarrassed and their hopes and dreams come crumbling down because they didn't do enough preparation.


And they got in their heads behind the curtain listening to other people getting laughs and thinking, I don't think I can do that. I fucked up. Then they panic and they fuck up in front of everybody and it's amazing and organic and improvised and anything can happen. You guys ready to start the show. Well, I pull an name out of the bucket. They grabbed them from across the street. And in the meanwhile, we have one of our unbelievable golden ticket winners here, rotating in to the opening regular position to start the show.

I gotta tell you, Cameron, I fucking love it. One of my favorite things that happens on this show just happened, which is when someone that's been on this show before numerous times, hasn't been on for a while, gets pulled out of the bucket and your fucking experience and your true comedy, you as a comedian just shined completely 30 seconds worth of laughter on acknowledging the situation before you just being honest and in the moment, flowing from what happened before you calling it out, using it to your advantage. The very amateur decision there would've been to, I gotta change the vibe.


I gotta get into this material, run it, get into it as fast as I can, make 'em forget about me being the boyfriend or the girl that was on. And instead, you took your time, you absorbed the situation, used it to your advantage a little comedy jujitsu took your time, went into a great joke, and then that was it. Yeah. Now, if I could just make her forget about her husband, that'd be, Yeah. Let's jump right into that. We'll talk about, we'll talk about skiing later. The joke was great, but let's talk about life. How long you been, how long you been dipping into the old tea and crumpets over there? A year now? Almost. Whoa.

Okay, We talked about that. Your last interview. You Wanna hear about my first armed robbery?


Yes. Yeah. There we go. Let's go. I was trying to avoid that, but it's, it's kind of a long story, but let's go. Okay. I was going to art school. I was on my way to school. And these two friends of mine who were 19 years old, they were waiting for me outside my driveway. And they, I used to work at a gas station and they knew, I knew how to heart wire cars. 'cause I used to steal cars from my friends. And they would You know, get the insurance money. They let me drive their GTO for a few weeks. And so they knew, I knew how to heart wire cars.


So they were waiting for me. I'm going, wait, what the fuck are You guys doing out in front of my house at eight o'clock in the morning? And they're going, we're gonna go rob this meat packing plant and we need you to hotwire a cow for us. And I was like, I gotta go to school. I'm going to, I have an art class. And they said, no, no, we need the money. And I, I was a junkie. I was a no dope feed. And I was going, I could use the money. And they're like, okay, look at I'll hard way the car for you. But then I gotta go, I gotta go into Boston. So I go hard way. The car for them, we are driving around and then I took them, I was taking them to the meat packing plant. They sell big sides of beef to restaurants for cash only.


So they had a lot of cash. And this one guy used to work there, so he knew where the cash was. He said, there's money in the register, but there's a cash box with a lot of money under the register. Make sure you ask for that. So we get there, and by now they talk me into being the getaway driver. So I said, okay, What was that last Part they talked me into being the, the driver, the getaway driver. She keep your mouth right next to the fucking tip of that plane. Yeah, don't cover it up. You move around a lot. Okay, keep going. Okay. So anyway, base the audience. Now, now they had me as the getaway driver. I said, okay, I'll drive the car. You guys go in. And Robert says, I can't go in because they know me.


I used to work here. And Allen, the guy that was going to go in, had the gun. And as we were driving there, he was rehearsing in the back seat and he has a lateral lisp. And he was going stick him up, stick him up, stick him up. I'm looking in the mirror going, ah, shit, this, they're gonna laugh at this fucking kid. I said, Alan, say something else. Don't say stick him up. See? He goes, okay, reach, reach, reach. And I go, oh man. I said, Rob, you gotta go in. He, he can't fucking talk. He goes, I can't go in. They know me. And then they decided to cancel it.


Like, forget it. We're not gonna do it. I'm like, I already missed my fucking class. We were robbing this fucking place. What do you mean you're not gonna do it? So I had to take control. I said, Robbie, you get behind the wheel, keep the fucking engine running. Okay, Alan, you go in there. If there's a lot of people in, there're like women with baby carriages and shit like that. Come out, stand in front of the store and cross your arms. And I'll know not to go in. Oh wait. So he goes, So now all of a sudden you're running this operation? Yeah. Okay, keep going. Yeah. They were dumbbells both of them. This is great. After that, I did it alone.


Okay, keep going. I never, anybody Else. Keep going. Keep going. Don't let me take your focus away. You're doing great. Yeah, I Have. It's Fucking unbelievable. I don't care if the story lasts three more hours. You're going, buddy. So Alan goes in, I wait 10 minutes, he doesn't come out. I figure, okay, the coast is clear. So I go in, I had a ski mask on. Well, it was a hat that turned into a ski mask. And I had the gun before I went in. I said, shit, I better take the bullets out of the gun. What if one of those bushes tries to take the gun away from me and I shoot someone. I'm not a killer. I'm just a robber. Right. I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna hurt anybody.


Right? So I'm going in and I put the ski mask down. I take the gun out, I go in and I didn't know what I was going to say, but this came outta my mouth. This is a robbery. Let's not make it a fucking murder. That's an original line. I go in and there's a lady with a baby carriage. All kinds of people in there keep going.


And Allen, Allen, the guy who's supposed to come out, has a fudge stickle in his hand. He, and he's stand, he puts his hands up with everybody else. He, He acts like he Fucking know me. Fucking asshole. You fucking asshole. And he's standing there, five's dripping off his elbow because he's like this, like this. And then I realized, I'm standing in there, it's daytime and there's a big picture window and all these apartment buildings across the street. And people could see me robbing the store. So I had to like get behind the potato chips. And I told everybody, I told everybody, move that way.


And they did. Everybody, they kind of reminded me of Casey. Rocket a little bit. That guy's funny. He catch me up. Anyway, so, so I said Adam was supposed to get he A spotlight. Alan was supposed to go get the money from the guy, but he didn't. He acted like he didn't know me. So the guy gives me the money. I get the money, I put it in the bag. And I said, I need the money in the box under the counter. And they all look at each other like, oh, inside job.


And they got that money. I got it. I run out. As I'm running out, I hear Alan behind me saying, I'll stop him. I'll stop him. He's, he's saying that like he's chasing me. And the but is behind him. Like, oh, I can't get him, kid get him. So I fucking go to get in the backseat and our getaway driver is in the backseat on the floor. He's all crushed up. He's freaking out. He goes, did you do it? Did you do it? Are you fucking ass? Oh, he is supposed to be behind the wheel. Oh, My, God. So I had to get behind the wheel. Alan's running, trying to get in the car. I'm driving away. I don't wanna leave him there. So I had to stop. And while we were robbing the store, I stole a car that didn't have snow tires.


And it started snowing while I was in there. And it was a little incline. And I'm, ah, shit, the, the, there's like three bushes behind me in the street. They're like, I get 'em and I look up and there's a black and white cruiser coming around the corner and I'm going, oh fuck me. We are going to jail. I'm gonna miss my whole class. My figure drawing class. My nude painting class, my favorite class. I used to get nude in that class. Sometimes I got in trouble for that. Anyway, we hit a, we hit a dry patch and the wheels caught.


And I was able to go past the cruiser. As I'm looking in the mirror, I see the bushes telling the cops and pointing at me. That fucking guy just robbed us and they chased us around and we lost them. And that was it. Wow. Wow. Look at this reaction from the audience. I appreciate that. You guys are great. I couldn't get this guy to answer a fucking question eight minutes ago.

He left before the whole wheelchair things where he is like a regular shitty dad.


Oh, interesting. Interesting maneuver. How amazing. What a great, great time to get out. He sold the stock before it went bad. Amazing. Amazing stuff. So what's kind of like your prognosis, don? Don't know if that's a crazy question ask, but what are doctors saying about you? So when I was, I got let's, okay, so I am about to be 28, right? I got diagnosed at 18 and when I was diagnosed, they told me I had two years left to walk.


You know my life expectancy was 40. It's progressive. And so much of you with the muscles, so like your sight, you're hearing your speech, all that would go. So I was kind of a whore for a long time. That's hot. Yeah. Hell yeah. By the Way, you hear that Austin being progressive isn't always good. Okay. Hell Yeah. But the good news about like six months ago, the FDA approved the first treatment. I actually heard about this. Somebody sent me this and I was gonna send you it, but I assume that you already were sent it.


I, I was extremely good friends with Michael Laer and he would always get offended anytime I sent him anything about, it's like he would be like new stem cells proven to help a LS. He's like, I'm fucking dying. Don't you understand? Nothing helps me. He's like, you think You know more about dog? He would literally, nothing made him matter than somebody trying to save his life. Yeah. So have you been taking it? What's Yeah, so the scariest part about Friedrich's Axia, which is what I have, is the progression of it.


You know if I could just like know what my body was gonna be like the following day, I think I'd be fine. But this medication is just three pills every day and it pauses the progression. So. Wow. That's Good. Like, oh, Noel, Dr. Redband. Ladies and gentlemen. Wow. Ooh, that's good. Unbelievable addition. Does, does the medication have a chance to reverse it or it's just gonna pause it? So, fuck, I'm very excited about this. Ooh. So there is a different clinical trial. I was actually part of that is with clinical trials, once they're tested in so many stages, they go into open label, which is when the people that were in the trial get to take it for free for a few years to make sure it's okay before FDA approval.


And that is like a shot in your stomach every day. And so it just protects them with just the protein I don't make enough of which is reversal. Wow. So yeah, That's what, holy shit.

I'm middle aged, clearly having a midlife crisis here, doing standup for the first time in Austin, Texas, baby. Woo hoo. So I just left corporate America recently and I have an AI startup like everybody on earth. So I was talking to chat GPT, talking about my problems and I said, Hey man, having a midlife crisis.

I was looking a gator, my sweet little dog. I was looking at her shit. I'm always looking at her shit. And I actually found a worm this past week, Tony. And we took her to the vet. Yeah, yeah. And we took her to the vet and the doctor says it's not a parasite. So now we're taking her to some real expensive place in Sedona, Arizona.


This coming week. Wait, it's costing like $10,000. The doctor, I found a worm in Gators shit. And now this doctor here in Austin's telling us that's not the case. And I found online there's a great guy in Sedona, Arizona. So What's the guy in Sedona gonna do? He Specializes Tony. And if, if your dog, if you're sure your dog has worms, but the veterinarian says it doesn't have worms. He specialize in stuff like that. I found it online. Seriously. I was searching. I was so scared. I had this Tony is the scaredest. I've been forever. So the vet said it doesn't have a parasite. Everything is okay. The dog will be fine. and you went online, found a guy in Sedona that searches through dog shit Because I found a worm and Gator shit.
