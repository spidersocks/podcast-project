That is Fox News contributor Tyler Fisher. But if they are in the young artist or athlete successful life, they do tend to be the one that takes the check that kind of like, and deposits it and does everything.

He's already got a big joke book. All right, Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should put a ribbon on it.


We've had a fun episode. We've had a blast. There's only one way to end an episode like this if you ask me. And it is with one of the greatest regulars in the entire history of the show. An icon, a man who God himself says has a greater healing touch than him. A man who is known for not only discovering America, but figuring out that the earth is round And that, alright, it is the Memphis Strangler, the vanilla gorilla, the big red machine. This is William Montgomery. Everybody, A white woman is suing a fertility clinic because she gave birth to a black baby.


And weirdly enough, the exact opposite thing happened to my mother when she saw me come out. She said, oh hell no. North Korea has outlawed eating hot dogs. Apparently real dogs were getting their feelings hurt. California Congressman Eric Swalwell, the guy who was fucking a Chinese spy, said Trump is responsible for the recent plane crashes. No, Eric, that would be Hillary Clinton. Hooters is thinking about filing for bankruptcy. They're trying to decide whether to file a chapter seven, a chapter 11 or a chapter 36 double D.


Okay, that's my time. Ladies and gentlemen, take notes. The, the one of the best sets of the night came from the man who's done it more than anybody else. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. You thank you so much, Tony. I'm feeling stronger than ever on the fucking row machine. I'm now up to 91 miles since February 3rd. I will say I am not Stopping that. You seem very present. There's a little bit of snap in your, in your step today. You seem rested. Yeah, I'm feeling really good. And I swore I would not even bring this up, but last time I was talking, I was having the issues with not being able to dooo. And now recently I've been drinking on prune juice, which is like a miracle drink.


I've been drinking big cups of it and oh my God, my stomach's hurting right now, Tony, from how much I have to shed. Wow. We have some Pepto Bismol if you'd like some. Where do you get this prune juice from? Bit Randall's. Okay. That's a very specific answer. It's not, not in the freezer sec. Not in the fridge section. Just by the other juices. Right. And is it from concentrate or pure prune juice? I think pure P prune juice. I think. I can't think of the brand. It doesn't really matter. But How does it make you feel when you're on the toilet and the prune juice has shown mercy on you? Well, two days ago, Tony, I swear to God with the, and I think I've said this all before at one point, but the how, how it was jetting out of my asshole.


It was making the loudest, like it sounded like a jet noise, Tony. And I'm holding onto to the Toilet. What did it sound like? Can you do an impression of Wow. Yeah, something like that. Very, And I'm thinking, hold on, I've been drinking a bunch of water. Does. I thought water comes out from your ki. From your what? Bladder. I'm thinking how's all this liquid in my colon or my butt area? So that part I didn't understand. 'cause when you drink water, isn't that in your, it's like your front part, right? Well Is it, so if you drink a bunch of water and you pee 'cause it's coming, it is in your front part, but isn't the colon or whatever in your back part kind of. So do you think the food goes in into the back and the liquid goes to the front?


You Think that's what I was thinking about? That's what I think my conclusion was coming to. Is it not two different places It goes to? Well the prune juice is a liquid, right? Yep. And then you have your club soda that you love so much to drink. Yeah, there's a lot of that. And then there's the water that you drink when you're working out, right? Yes. Now that you're rowing. Yep. So there's a lot of liquid. So it would make sense that it was okay. It actually goes in your blood, the liquid goes in your blood and then it gets a re redistributed. Yeah. It goes in and then it goes to your blood. Water goes to your blood and then it gets redistributed by the water has a weird flow.

I can't tell if you look okay or not because now when I was doing real bad, I was wanting to make fun of you. 'cause I was not feeling good about myself. But now I feel so much better now I'm worried about her. You doing okay? I'm doing amazing. Yes. Okay. Yes. Wants, alright, I'm back. Everybody up? About 90% of blah blah. It's kind of a, it's kind of a tough question to ask. Fucking Google.

How do you explain that Tyler? Little. Just a little update. I'm a pilot now if y'all didn't know that, William, if you ate ice, where do you think ice would go? Oh my gosh. That's a really good question. Right Ben? I've never even thought about that. If I ate ice. Good question. I gotta think about it. I don't really know.
