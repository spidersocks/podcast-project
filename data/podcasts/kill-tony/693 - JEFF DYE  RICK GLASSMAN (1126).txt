No, I think Kamas wants to kill the Jews, but they are just limited it to Israel, which is not like the best way to get your genocide going. Just doing it very grassroots. But if you think about it like that, it kind of just proves there's nothing to really do with the Jews at all. It's just that area of land. Whoever lives there, they'll never get along. You know if Asian people live there. They're also not like the Asian people. And I know that firsthand. 'cause I've lived in the Bronx my whole life and I hate Puerto Ricans.


What I, but I would like to propose as a little exchange program where we send the Puerto Ricans to Israel and then we send the Jews to the Bronx and you'll see how quickly the Palestinians beg for the Jews to come back. This music is on all night long. I'm obviously, that's a joke.

David, Joseph, Peter Sullivan, Ladies and gentlemen, a medium red machine, which could only mean one. There's only one place to go after that. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present to you the record holder for all time appearances on the show interviews on the show Hall of Famer. It is indeed the Memphis Strangler, the vanilla gorilla, the Van Nuys, Nigerian, the American Spirit Salutatorian.


This is the one, the only, the big red machine. William Montgomery, Ladies and gentlemen. It is kinda really weird because I matched with this fucking ass on a redheaded dating website. So I, don't know what the fuck Keith, Jimmy Kimmel cried on his show the day after the election. And I don't know if it was because of Trump's victory or the fact that he had 112 viewers, but seriously it was kind of ironic when the tears made his black face run.


Okay, let's keep moving. So I'm actually working on a movie. It's basically the pot of little giants, but instead of little League football, it's a man who competes in women swimming. I mean, this is a true underdog story against all odds. He sets multiple world records. It's called Big Booty Bitches and Bikinis. Volume four or You know the worst is when you intend on handing out Halloween candy. But then you get so high, you eat it all. And then you remember you inserted razor blades. All right, anybody here a fan of riddles? Y'all like riddles?


Here's what, here's one for you. I heard this the other day. Who let the dogs out? Okay, that's what I tell you. William Lights out. Montgomery has done it again, Ladies and gentlemen. I love a good, nobody's watching Jimmy Kimmel joke. Yeah, that was our, that right off the bat seemed weird with the crowd. I mean, it scared me. And then Literally nobody is watching it. It is incredible. Yeah, It is just an absolute fact. Yeah. Gosh. And Tony, I have been, it's really scary. I didn't tell you last week, but I got visited by a ghost or something in my apartment.


Tony, again, I've been playing a bunch of Call of Duty recently and I was laying on the chair thinking about starting to play Call of Duty. And I'm laying on the chair and my girlfriend is sitting beside me and my shirt does this. Pretty scary. And then, and then I, at my cousin's house, Tony, this past weekend in Charlotte, I was in Charlotte. And by the way, I won't get too close to y'all. I feel I'm very sick. I was very worried about Charlotte, but I somehow made it through. But Tony, I've been doing this say where I ask people what their heritage is. Are you Native American? I've just been doing some crowd work with that. And then I'm talking to my cousin Trey, and they have one of the big speakers that's like the Google equivalent of an Alexa. And out of nowhere it says Native American heritage.


Native American heritage. Twice In the middle. Your Alexa said that in Charlotte? Yeah, that's what my cousin's Alexa said it. Nobody started. It's weird, it's somebody trying to tell me something. I'm just trying to decipher what it means. What it, why did they say that? and You think it was perhaps a Native American ghost slightly lifted up your shirt a little I. Don't know what it is. I'm trying to figure it out, Tony, but I swear to God, it seems like it's somebody from the other side trying to communicate something to me and I'm just trying to figure out what that is. Wow. So I'm kind of on a Quest now. Well, Rick actually, I don't know if You know this, but Rick actually sometimes can channel spirits. I've seen you do it before. I know you're a little bit shy about it.


I don't wanna put you on blast or anything, but can you perhaps try to channel a spirit and see what happens here? I wonder if the spirit will have a Mustache Come out and say, Hiya, Hiya. I think, I think I'm just gonna chill out. Okay. I I, I I don't know how the cameras footages are working, but there's about four times tonight that Tony, like, he's my dad. It goes like this. And I'm like, every time I'm like, am I coming in too hot? And now I'm gonna do a spirit bit.


Yeah. You've, you relaxed for a few minutes. Please Rick. I need help, man. Seriously, come On. Will you please help? How many of you think Rick should help William? Right now? Seriously, Look at these people. Look, look at them. They win it. Hey Rick, I'm not doing good, man. Please help me. And seriously after this, if you wanna play Call of Duty, you could also do this at the apartment later too. Oh. Oh, I'll, maybe I will play that black guy in basketball. No, but I, the thing is, I I I'm just, I don't wanna make a I do, I do do that stuff sometimes You do do that stuff. You Do do. Alright. Hey, Luke is, lay it on, replace some cherry pie again.


It's okay. You don't actually have to play cherry pie. I I don't Wanna make a joke out of talking to spirits because if I don't see anybody then it's gonna waste everybody's time. I have a i I have a a feeling. I have a feeling. I have a feeling. It was the girlfriend who was sitting next to you who lifted your shirt. That Is no a great prediction. How do You know that's not the case? 'cause it wasn't. She did. I didn't feel anything. So, and I'm laying, and I could have seen if she, if she pulled my Shirt out. You think that a Native American wanted to just see the sign? Native American ghosts, I don't know what it is. That is the problem with ghosts. It's so subtle. I Know. What's, The story's never like if we were just like, if this just went, that'd freak you the fuck out. But that's a terrible story.


You know, like, yeah, I'd be like the cop mo. Everyone go fucking, right. 'cause that is scary. If you're alone and your shirt goes up, it's, yeah. Tough story. Did you ask how, what's the matter? Two tenths, Tony, let's get Indian jokes. Yeah, I, wow. So other than the ghost thing, what else has been going on William? Gosh, Tony, it's, wait, so you really think that's kind of boring though?


The story or what were you saying? Thinks it interesting. That's really bothering me right now. It's Why is it bothering you? I? Don't know. 'cause it is kind of scary, isn't it? You know. Everything Goes to is so boring. You know. You'd be like you the other day, it turned on the faucet and you're like, yeah, it's probably an old fucking ghost. Never seen water like that before. You know. Yeah. What would a Native American, what kind of beef would a Native American possibly have with someone that looks like a Confederate War General? Yeah. I. Don't know. I'm trying to figure it out. I hate it, Tony. I hate it. Scary. I really Do. It was scary for sure. Yeah, it's super scary. I'm dealing with all this shit. It's almost Thanksgiving, but I'll make it through. Luckily I don't have to go anywhere this week at Tony. I am.


I'm exhausted. Other than an Alexa and your shirt lifting up. Has there been anything? Anything else? Did you feel somebody poke your H us or something like that or? I wish, but no, I have not. Did your, did your Land O'Lakes melt quickly or something like that? No. It's just literally those two things. So I'm trying to just put it all together, huh? It's kinda hard. All right. I have A thought. Yes. RICK, GLASSMAN, I. Don't know for sure, but you could ask maybe this ghost to tell you a joke and see if it's corny or not. Ah, well that joke was amazing.


You. know what I do see a ghost and that's a hundred years from now. Your ghost that's gonna be haunting. This place with the quickest quis and the funniest one-liners I've ever seen. You wanna get haunted by a Native American? Boring. You wanna get native by whatever. Something. Hey, much like the whatever the joke the guy said. I didn't land it, but we're here to pitch jokes sometimes. We don't always have to be on Tony William Montgomery. You did it again.


Here's some cinnamon Zipp picks for you. Some nicotine toothpicks. Those are really good. You're gonna love 'em. Some Zipp picks for you, some zipp picks for you. Nicotine toothpicks. I'm telling you, they're amazing. It's the future.
