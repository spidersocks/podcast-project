We're farm folk. And as You know, one day it's, he can read it on the inter Google. My dad was out in the Cobbs and we heard some rustling around, and the old man was bit by a rabies skunk and passed away.


So this is a big knife for me, and I want to thank you for having me here. Dad, I hope you're in the big niblet in the sky. I feel like he's looking over us right now. I can smell the rabies skunk beaming off of him. Yep. That's a sign right there. That was him. Yeah.

Some dudes pulled out their tits on that one. Jiggled them tits. Tony. Good to be here. Hell yeah. Red band. Good to see you. The man. Harlin. The myth. The Doc. How are you, doc? Well, This is, I want to say something real quick. There's a special time. Vegas KILL TONY in Vegas. Give it up for that. That's a big fucking deal. Never thought we'd get here, but you did it. But it's a, it's kind of a big day for me.


About 10 years ago, a woman that my dad was fucking died from rabies. And I wanna take a moment of silence for that twat. Okay, that's good. Thanks for having me, Tony. Well, Luckily, you're two of the best guests in the show's history. So You know exactly how it works. Over 300 innocent souls signed up for the opportunity to perhaps get pulled out of this bucket. It's absolutely thick chaos filled to the brim. No doubt about it. If I pull their name out, we're gonna meet 'em all together. They get 60 seconds uninterrupted You know their time is up in your head. The sound of a kitten. That means they have to wrap it up then, or else they bring out the angry Fremont street bear.


Ooh, A big cock for Fremont Street. Wow. Some old school Vegas people here. Some real fucking white trash in the house. Some real fucking desert monkeys You. know what I'm saying? Some real fucking sand snails out here. Some real fucking cactus You. know what I'm saying? Yeah. Alright. Saw a couple Asian Jews in the crow too. Tony. Oh Yeah, there's, there's those two. But I call, I call 'em cactus. Well, we go wrangle that first bucket pool of the night. Let's get it started with perhaps what many say is one of the greatest regulars in comedians in the history of the show.


I can think of no better way to start a show like this than with a young man who You know a place like Las Vegas. A swing state I think represents very well the greatness that is the United States of America. And this first comedian is on a mission to become an American Citizen. Truly one of the fastest rising stars in all of standup comedy. This is a brand new minute from the Estonian assassin.


Thank you You. know what I did recently? I had sex with my ex. Ooh. Highly recommended. That shit is the best. We went back to her place. I saw her pussy like an old friend. There he is. Isn't it the best when you fuck an ex? 'cause You know that pussy You know all the buttons. It's like playing Tony Hawk. Prosecute a two again, Because That's the worst.


When you start dating somebody new, you get that new pussy, you're like, what the fuck? It's like new pussy is like switching to Android. You're like, why is it green? Because that's the worst when you start dating somebody. New guys don't have that. That's why Dick is the best. Like overall, because it's universal. Dick is like A-U-S-P-C. I don't need to You know every guy here. I could fucking, I don't need to know you.


I don't need to put PHIL Collins on for atmosphere. Dude, if they lock the doors in the back and they're like, okay, Ari, the only way we get out is we need a bucket of gum. We're all out before midnight. But if they tell me the only way we get out is I need to make three women here come. We're all gonna starve to death. Thank you very much. Las Vegas. Thank you. He's done it again. Ari Mackey, Thank you.


Coming out with pure swagger, I do believe, I mean, that has to be a new suit. That is unbelievable. I just got it today. It was a thousand dollars. I am financially in ruins. You look fucking fantastic. Thank you. It is incredible. You've done it again. You have you been to Vegas before? The first time in Las Vegas? Ah, Let's get married. HARLAND. WILLIAMS. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a dude. I feel like a complete idiot. About half an hour ago, I let this guy valet my car.


It's mine now. Harland. It smelled like pussy juice. I gotta tell you What flavor. Raspberry sun blasts. Okay, Ari. Matti. What have you done in Las Vegas so far? I went to Ross and Dress and it's an amazing store. Holy shit. Don't even steal, dude. It's $2 for everything, dude. I've never heard anybody call it The entire name of the store. Yes, It's usually just Ross, but it I I didn't Ross Andress, right? Ross Andress For a second. I thought you were naming a friend's character and another guest star.


What did you buy? I bought like a golden shirt, some short Wow. It's a blazing on that. Hell yeah. I bought some jeans, some women's lingerie. I mean, it's for free, so might as well. Where would you wear a golden shirt Backstage where the bitches are at? Good answer. Fuck. yeah. Ari, Fuck yes. You mentioned, oh, go ahead, Tony. No, you go ahead. Well, you mentioned a green pussy that you ate. Yes. Who was it? It was my ex. It was your ex. My sweet angel.


Estonian. Yes. I miss her very much, but I need to Get a passport, so it was very sad. Thanks for bringing it up. Well, a green pussy in America feels like a red flag. Do You. know what I'm saying? So maybe you're dodging a bullet. Red flag is great, red, white, and blue. Yes, America. That's a correct answer. Be sure to answer it that way on your exam for citizenship. That's the sound. When you hear that sound You know you're that much closer to become. I've never gambled. I've never even tried to put money on something. I'm very excited to lose all of it. Okay, I've heard of this expression.


Beginner's luck. I might win a million dollars tonight. What game are you thinking about playing? It was the guys were talking in the back. It's Bacarra Bacarra. It's Bharara. It is the famous game of poker. And then I want to pull a lever to win some coins. I love it. You're in for some dis, I don't think coins have come out of a slot machine in 30 years, but I have Apple Pay too. There's also a fun way to gamble. You get into an Uber pool, okay? You take your dick out and you see if you get arrested or not.


Don't try it unless you're feeling lucky. If someone came up to you in the casino and said, I'll give you a million bucks if you'll sleep with me tonight. Hmm? Would you do it? My guy? Who is this person asking me? Robert Redford? Don't know who that is. I will do it. You're gonna need to know for your citizenship task. Okay, how about this? It's the owner of Ross Andres Ross. It's Mr. Ross himself. Yeah. I love it. I'll put on a dress for Ross Ari Matti. I cannot possibly think of a better way to get this show started. Thank you so much. Everybody with a fucking bang Ari Matti.


And here we go. We shall begin the process of our first bucket. Pull of the night. Now, how many of you are fans of the show?

Our golden ticket winners make it look easy, but it is not easy at all. Thank you so much. Make some noise for the great Valerie Vaughn and Heidi Ladies and gentlemen with us all night. That's the real deal. Some in sells that can't even look directly at 'em. I love it.


I love to see our fucking nerdy fans that are just used to sitting back on YouTube. I don't wanna get an erection while next to people at a show. Anyway, so the chicken hit the fan. It could also be the next great talent. We found all of our stars out of this bucket. It could be a completely insane person. Anything can happen. Your first bucket, pull of the night bucket pull number one goes by the name of Corey Grumpy Johnson. It's a good name. Let's see what happens. Corey Grumpy Johnson. Here he is. Ladies and gentlemen.


Make some noise for Corey. Everyone. 2024. Crazy year, crazy year. OJ Simpson and Nicole are back together again. Didn't see that one coming. I really didn't see that one coming at all recently. I went to five and below and I was a little confused because I almost bought, excuse me, I almost spent $27, but I only tried to buy three things. Now I'm half white.


So a part of me just wanted to go straight, Karen, but then I realized I'm half black, so I just stole the shit. Fuck. Five and below. Is it me or should more gay men be winning these hotdog eating Contest? I just feel like they practice more. Thank you. Wow. Corey Grumpy Johnson. A great comedy name. I saw the shirt first. You are now witnessing greatness and my expectations hit the ground for you.


Unbelievable. Nicole Brown Simpson Reunited. You think she went to hell? Yes. Yes, she went to hell. Apparently she was a piece of shit too. TONY. Whoa, You. Know what I mean? Someone, someone, I've never seen anyone take ojs side in the argument before. Holy shit, Dr. Phil. Well, I followed OJ on Twitter up until he passed. And I I, I agree with you on that. You know he was entertaining post murder. You know he'd always be in a Costco parking lot being like, what's up Twitter world? You ever notice how co what the fuck was that red band that was Speedy Gonzalez from the Looney Tunes?


That was OJ Simpson getting some potato salad at a Costco. Anyway, what did Nicole do that made you go fuck this bitch? Well, Word on the street is she was a what street? Fremont Street Street. Well played. I set you up for that. It is literally this sec. Somehow, somehow this is the Fremont Street section of how did they, I guess if you bought your tickets in that like wifi zone, you got that section. None of these people reacting to Fremont Street.

Oh, that's a cool, that's a large window there, dear. Gut. When I was a kid, I was pretty wild. 15 to 31. That's like going into a shirt store being like, do you have a men's small or a dinosaur? Triple X. It's for a friend. Jesus Christ. That's a huge timeline player. I didn't do that. I didn't go straight through. I just, I was in and out a lot and a lot of stuff. So, okay, let's talk about it. Let, let rattle off. How, how many of you want to hear some of this guy's fucking Rat sheet? You beat somebody to death with a microwave at 15, am I correct?

This podcast is sponsored by Mando. Guys, I hate packing for trips. I never know what to pack. Sometimes I pack too much. Sometimes I didn't. Didn't even pack enough. And when I get stuck on what hygiene products to bring, do I take a body wash and a tiny shampoo? Do I pour my shampoo into a tiny travel sized bottle? That's why I simplified my travel with Mandos four in one acidified cleansing bar, it's a five ounce bar that does the work of a shampoo, face wash, body wash, and deodorant. You can also use it to create a rich shaving lather. So technically it's a five in one. It's clinically proven to control body odor For 24 hours, Mandos four on one acidified cleansing bar is formulated with a gentle alpha hydroxy acid that stops the odor at the source. Regular soap can't do that because the pH is too high. This simplifies your hygiene routine, and it's the only thing you really need to pack. You can get it in three cologne. Quality Sense. Mount Fuji is fresh and woodsy. Bourbon leather is sweet and sophisticated and pro sport. It is clean and citrusy. My favorite is the bourbon leather because You know I'm classy. And speaking of pure class, here's Redband Tony. I actually used this today. I love Mando. I rubbed this all. I've rubbed the soap all over my body and I love the way I smell. I personally used the pro sport. I gotta admit, I was hesitant at first trying on a new scent. But now that I've used Mando, there's no going back. You smell fantastic Red band.

We're onto our second bucket pool of the night. We're gonna keep it moving along. Make some noise for Izzy Hall, everybody. We're gonna meet 'em all together. Izzy Hall, a whole new crop of people out here in the desert of Western America. This is Las Vegas, Nevada. And your next bucket pool is Izzy Hall. Here he is. Make some notes for Izzy. Everybody. So I'm not homophobic, but I just hate that those bastards have kind of reclaimed the rainbow.

And Uncle Sctm would mean to me. Where's that motherfucker Hall bread? Hey, hey, hey. My antisemitism told me I need to move the fuck outta her house. Whip it. Antisemitism. I've never really heard it called that before. I normally hear anti-Semitism. What do you think? Yeah, you can also call it Jew hatred. Yeah. What type of, I've You know, I hear this, but it's kind of funny 'cause like if you make fun of an Italian, there's no word for that.


If you make fun of everybody else, it's racist. You guys have your own word. How does that make you feel? What Does That mean? What? What does that tell you? If your people have a special word for racism, what do you think that means? If you take yourself out of the picture, what do you think about your people having a special word for just you?

Long Island. And There's, I know a Jewish stronghold, Right? There's a lot of, well again, again, only you people call it a stronghold when you're populated there. Why do you think you would do that? Why do you think the blood that runs through your veins would make you call it a stronghold? As if though you own that land that is American land, clearly. Yeah. I mean I love America, so, but also we're not very strong as you can see.


Right. Okay. So you're basically in Long Island, which for those of you that don't know, is basically a big Jewish temple and you faced antisemitism. What exactly did they say or do to you there? Go ahead. Basically, I mean, like they said, shit, like go back to You know Poland, all the normal shit. But you've never been to Poland? No, I'm from, my ancestry is Ukrainian. Oh wow.

How long have you been doing standup guy? This is my first time. Is it something you want to pursue?


Yeah. I did improv in high school so I kind of wanted to try standup. Alright, let me give you a little advice. Okay. 'cause I'm seeing a lot of this from a lot of young guys coming out here. Even the older guys try and get away from the masturbation and the jerk off jokes. And it's too easy. All right, if you really want to do this, you got a laptop, sit down and be clever. Write something original. Go watch a guy like Steven Wright or even Hans Kim. These guys put a lot of effort. They're writing jokes, they're being clever. We see too many guys and girls come out here and just You know. Go down to that jerking off masturbation stuff. It's, it doesn't work.


Nobody wants it. So to you and every other young comic, use your mind. Be smart, be clever, and let's, let's bring the game up a little. All right?
