Wow, Tony. I am so happy to be, no, I'm kidding. No, Tony. It's so nice to be here. I'm so excited. I made it. I literally just got back from Paris, France about an hour ago. It was a real big opportunity for me. They were telling me I finally was gonna be able to headline the fucking opening ceremony of the Olympics. Obviously Tony, I was so excited. And then I fucking pretty much bomb. don. Don't know what fucking happened. Everybody's saying I'm making fun of Christian people, and that's not the case.


I was just having fun. So it's so nice to be here. I'm glad I was able to make it here tonight. It was amazing. We all saw you. You didn't tell anybody that you were going to do that. You kept it a secret from all of us. You wanted to surprise us. We would've given you some notes perhaps on how to handle it differently. Well, Tony, I thought I would finally go out on a limb on my own. I'm very sorry. I mean that really, redband, I'm sure would've had a bunch of really great ideas on it. So I really, I'm sure I should have asked Redband. I mean, it's fucking ass would've made it hilarious.


Probably. I mean, it's so funny. But, but yeah, no, I mean, I should have asked for your expertise. I really should have, because I was just thinking, I'm gonna be Dion, ISIS, I'm gonna have some fucking fun out there. And that's the best I knew how to do. And here we are. So I guess my only question is why are you, why do you still look like that? God Tony, I started raving again. I'm on something literally, I think it's called Candy Flipping. It's two CCB and MDMA. I'm on some of that still. But yeah, no Tony. I haven't been to sleep yet. I can't get the fucking paint off of my body.


It's literally, I don't know what I'm gonna do. It's just like a jet engine in my fucking apartment. And now I can't. I'm so excited about this.

But I have to pay attention to many things at once. Sometimes it's hard 'cause I'm You know we're you're getting the next people ready and this and that.


There's so many different variables going on all at once. But I will tell you one of the things that I noticed is that both Gary Falcon and Blue WILLIAM MONTGOMERY laughed throughout your entire set. Thank You guys. Yeah. The bad news is that without a doubt, they were laughing at how unbelievably stupid. All of your jokes were shockingly dumb jokes. Yeah. Yeah. I wrote 'em that way. It's Fine. Yeah. No, it's It's your brand it seems. Yeah. I thought it was great. He also looks like a door guy at the Holocaust. Thank you. Is incredible. William, you have something?


Yeah. I thought you were great. I loved just the very beginning. What was it? It was something about bisexuals and then you said Ladies and gentlemen. I think that really immediately got me. 'cause I was thinking to myself, what is that? What Does that mean? Yeah, but in the best of ways. Yeah. Yeah. Because you're bold. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my. There were so many places you could have gone with that setup. It was incredible. When you said gentlemen, we were all like, what the fuck? You could have said ladies and anybody. You could have said anybody. Any. Anybody and anybody. You could have done anything and said, you just said what everybody says Bisexual.


Yeah. Yeah. My favorite thing is that you look like the bad guy from every eighties movie. Yeah. Like you're gonna take over the ski resort and people are getting fucking fired. It's my summer man. It's my summer. It is incredible. You look like you've had some ups and definitely downs. Definitely. Are you so near, Are you stricken with anything at all? Is this just normal? Has God sure. Has God hit you with any of the doctors diagnosed anything? Just a very tired stoner. Okay. Why are you so tired? What do you do on an average day? I'm a, well, I'm a dad. I have two kids.


Oh, you do? Yeah. Oh, My, God. That is crazy. I know. I feel bad for him. Sorry guys. Wow. That is incredible. Yeah. So there's more of you. Yeah, unfortunately. Slightly better versions. Yeah. Yeah.

Jordan, what do you do for a living? How do you raise these two kids? I'm a full-time musician. Oh really? Yeah. I've been on the show before. Actually. I played a a drum solo here.


You played drums? You did. and you were, you were a good drummer. Pretty good. Yeah. Jon Deas says you lost. I mean, I know he lost. Obviously he's here and I barely know him at all. Where he would've been the full-time drummer if he won. Yeah. Did you come close, do you think George? I think I came pretty close. don don't know. What do you? I dunno. You guys, do you really think you came close? I think I came pretty Close. Have you been thinking about it ever since then? I try not to You know. I say pretty busy You know it wasn't my best solo of my life, but yeah. Have you been practicing for a better solo? I just practice all the time. Every day. All the time. Yeah. Wow. That's incredible. Michael practices it all the time every day. don don't know. What do You guys think? Should we have a Mexican drum off in here?


Michael, you've been called out for a rematch. How do you feel about this? You good? Let's go. He says, Ladies and gentlemen, it's a Mexican drum. I'm sorry Michael. This is the first time we've ever had a rematch, Ladies and gentlemen. So this is interesting. I guess the rules kind of stay the same, I guess. Doesn't really seem fair for a rematch. If Michael won the first one, one, he'd been Going for handsome Frankenstein. He is handsome. Frankenstein, without a doubt. Look at that. A face. Only a, not even a mother could love.


It's incredible. So since this is a rematch and not the real one, I guess there should be a special stipulation. I bet. A little time to think about it. So maybe if you win, you get to be the drummer one other time at some point, that would be great for you. Not for us probably. But then again, we could make fun of your wacky face the whole time. I mean, it is incredible. There's so much we haven't touched. It's amazing. Your eyes are close together. Johnny Carson Eyes. Yeah. Robert Downey syndrome. Alright, You guys know how it works.

So I like to hear about all the things that people do to get themselves off. Entertains me spitting. Slapping name calling, auto erotic asphyxiation. But my favorite thing I've heard about is where guys like to sit on their hand until it falls asleep and then they jerk themselves off. Anybody know what that's called? Stranger? Thank you. The stranger who said that? Actually like eight guys said that. But, so here's what I like to do.


I like to sit on my left hand about 10 minutes till it loses all the feeling in it. I, and then I slap the shit outta my kids and it feels like another parent is doing it. I call that the stepdad Dad. Thank you. That's what's on. Alright. Another remix of the stranger joke that we've heard a couple times before on the show, but it's okay.


Yeah, everybody's gotta do it. So how many times have you done standup? Let's find out about your actual life. Let's ignore the set and just move on to a rock solid interview here. Chase. I mean, how many times? I don don't know. I've been doing it about 10 months-ish. So Who does he sound like? You sound like somebody. You Said my voice was weird last time too. Yeah. You sound like somebody. I'm just gonna keep asking you questions while I figure out who you sound like since the last time you were on. Is there anything in the interview portion that you realized that that would be interesting to bring up in the interview portion of the show about your entire life? Really? You can reference anything at this point. Well, you didn't ask me what the most interesting thing about me was and my pre-planned answer before was that I delivered my son via water birth at home.


Wow. The poor man's birth. Wow. My goodness. Was it water or was it Mountain Dew? It seems incredible. We ran a hose from the shower to the bedroom to an inflatable tub. Oh, My. God. And the thing is, it was February and the tub water got cold eventually. So I had to like pale buckets of water out the fucking window and then run new hot water in like every hour or so. This is the most white trash childbirth I've ever heard of in my entire life. Did you give the kid a white trash name, boy or girl?


It's hunter. All right. It's a hunter. So is it a boy or a girl? Ah, I got you. Okay, so you had a boy. It's Hunter. Is that your only kid? No, I have a daughter as well. Okay. How old are these kids Hunter's? 16 and my daughter Ava is 11. Wow. And they're in school. You enrolled them in school or are they making bombs in the woods right now? Me and Hunter's mom were super crunchy hippies. We tried to keep him like off the grid. That lasted like two years and then we got 'em all his shots and a social security number. So I was actually correct.


Yeah, sometimes you think I'm being funny up here. Turns out I'm a fucking psychic. Wow. So You guys, were off the grid. When you say crunchy hippies, I've never heard that terminology before. What do you mean by that? Give us some examples of what were the most crunchy hippie things about you. Let's start with longest. You've gone without showering. Yeah, I'm about like three days right now. Right now? Yeah. Oh fucking absolutely fucking disgusting. It's been a busy, I've been busy. I'm absolutely disgusting. I swear to God. I've had three showers today. I wake up, I shower, I get in the cold plunge, I shower, I go swimming, I shower.


I hit the sauna. I shower. I got a haircut today. Guess what? Showered afterwards. Sounds you took a nap. Got ready for work. Showered shit myself. And then there's you. Yeah. Yeah. Red band shits himself. There you go. There's a little contribution from red band ladies and John. Little footnote if you will. Little, little, little coauthor just adding a contribution. The the William to my Shakespeare if you will. Shit myself. Shower fart noise. Alright, so okay, you've gone three days right now.


Do you not like it? I've always wanted, let me just really talk to you for a second because I've always wondered, do, do people not like showers as much as I do? Is it something in my genetics? 'cause my mom always had this thing where she would always go, You know the one thing that I never take for granted is a nice hot shower. It's the most lovely thing in the world. Maybe she instilled that in me. Maybe she raised me kind of not OCD. 'cause I just love it. It's not like a thing, I go empty tumor. It's like, oh God, I feel so fucking good. You answer now. What the fuck is wrong with you? I wanna know. Do you not find it unbelievably enjoyable? No, I fucking love it. I've just been busy as fuck. The last wow, there was a 16 hour drive to get here, bro.


I've been literally sitting around papers every waking hour of every day that just say Madison Square Garden and have different comedians names and things that I want to do with these shows. I mean, I am busy motherfucker. I'm busy. Like you could never fathom. We are fucking whatever, 12 days away from two nights back to back at Madison Square Garden. You're fucking telling me you're fucking busy doing what? Emptying an ashtray. What are you busy doing? Tell me what the fuck is so busy about you. So I actually, I was setting up a podcast studio for, actually Layla Ingles came over to my, my spot to do a podcast.


Red band called me for a titty. Fuck. Who the Fuck is that? Yeah, what are you talking about? So I stayed up, I stayed up late setting up a podcast and the next day we had a roast show and I actually got, I think I got Perma Band from the bar for doing ketamine with some random guy and then, then today I drove 16 hours to get here. I just didn't have time. You drove 16 hours to be here today. I drove about T 12 hours from Nashville where I did a pit stop at my sister's. But four hours from Cincinnati to Nashville.


You didn't wanna shower at your sister's. It was late and I didn't want to like inconvenience them and I'm like, don't You think it's more of an inconvenience to sleep somewhere all stinky? I thought of that, but I was like, fuck it, I'm tired. Doesn't it make you sleep better if you feel clean? Yes. But I had to make a decision and I'm like, I need at least four hours of fucking sleep before I do the You Don't think three hours and 50 minutes of sleep with clean balls would've been better than what you have going on in that fucking baked potato you got down there. No, it I, yeah, dude, You know what?


I Didn't wanna inconvenience the person I'm staying with here either. You, know what? I've never done this before, but I think we should have Lori smell your balls right now. No, I'm kidding, Lori. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Oh. My God. We've found Lori's girlfriend over here. Look at this Arian dragon queen over here. Holy shit. Look at the silver locks on this one. Oh, My God. Are you Lori's lady? Did I find it? No, but you eat pussy. Am I correct? Well then Get up here and smell his balls. What are you talking about? Jesus, what's your fucking problem?


Oh. My. God. Alright, so what makes you a crunchy hippie before I let you outta here? I mean, I used to follow fish and have dreadlocks and sell LSD to strangers and All right, that qualifies. You are indeed a crunchy hippie. Where are you sleeping tonight? What's your plan for now? I wanna, I want you to find a shower. It's Not that you're a smelly guy. I can't smell anything. I'm sure there's even smellier people probably here. There's probably a different ethnicities and whatnot that There's a smellier That, that, that, that compared to a white guy with a three days.


I mean, some of these people out here, don don't know if You know. What do you think the Smelliest race is? If you had to guess? Oh, white people. No Okeydokey. All right. He actually started to answer there. I'm gonna stop you there. All right. You were on before and you got a big joke book. Am I correct? Correct. Well, There, you go use it. Try to dig deep, man. You gotta find original stuff that applies to your life. I got, I dragged so much interesting shit out of you in this interview. You need to be talking about that. You need to be talking about a crunchy hippie. You need to talk about how you need to shower, what you did today and all this crazy shit You. know what I mean? I'm working on the personal stuff. You know You're, you're green, you're trying to make people laugh.


That's what you're trying to do. And what you need to do is, as corny as it sounds, and I can't believe I'm getting this serious on an episode, this funny, but you gotta really drive, come from within within your perspective. Talk about giving a white trash water birth and dumping water out of a fucking, probably an apartment window, not a house, right? I had a bit about that, but it didn't get laughs, so I'd never tried it again. Real works. It doesn't need to get laughs at some fucking janky open mic in the outskirts of Tennessee. You need to fucking keep trying that stuff. Don't try this stuff that gets laughs in front of shitty audiences at a shitty bar somewhere.


I Appreciate that. Stay loyal to yourself. Thank you. There goes Jason l Rod, A touching, deep artistic moment from me. And by the way, Layla. Layla. Oh, we do know Layla. We know Layla.
