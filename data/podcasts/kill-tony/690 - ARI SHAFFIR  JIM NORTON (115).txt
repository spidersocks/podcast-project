Hey y'all. This podcast is sponsored by Calci. Do You know who will win the presidential election? I know. I certainly have no idea or how many seats the Democrats or Republicans will win in the House or Senate. While there's finally a legal way to bet on the outcome of these elections via a platform called Cal Sheet. Calci is the first legal exchange where you can trade or bet on any event including but not limited to elections. That's right. You can trade on that. Calci went to court in one legal approval for election betting for the first time in a hundred years. You can trade on that red band. Tony. I love Calie. I've been using the platform and I am loving it. The payouts work like this. You buy for X cent and get $1 if you're right per contract. So if you buy something for 33 cents and you're right, you get three times your money and you can buy as many contracts as you want. They have markets on who will win the presidential election, who will control the House and Senate and who will win swing states and more. Calci is already being used by hundreds of thousands of people and is facilitated close to $1 billion worth of trades. Calci is the only place to trade on these events in all 50 states. So put some skin in the game. Let's take an example. right now Trump and Kamala are trading about 50 50. Meaning if you place a bet on either you will double your money if they end up winning. That's pretty good. So put your money where your mouth is and give, give Cal she a try. Sign up using our link calci.com/tony and the first 500 traders who deposit $100 will get a free $20 credit.

I've Never But you also don't have that much hair bro. No offense. Ooh. Like I got like hair in my eyes.

Like I'm, I like the Curls. You like it like that? Yes. Even though you're massively concussed and blaming it on the hair that gets into your eyes, you're suffering. You'd rather, I would say massively. I I would. You got a concussion just walking into shit. No. You said the hair though. But if you hit your hair, hair against the wall, that didn't give you a concussion. Dude, If you're, so the last time I feel like I got a concussion, right. I was in my friend's warehouse and he has like this like, it's like a two story short ass little thing. And I was going underneath and I thought the fucking garage door thing was open and I went Woo.


And I hit the top right there on My head at times. Nice. At times. That shit hurt so bad. Red band. Solid job there. You know that was, that was right on it. Red bad. That was on the radar Red man. How was I supposed to know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm, I'm legitimately jealous of your hair. I'm supposed to be negative about stuff, but that No. Absolutely incredible. What's your love life like? You seem like the kind of guy that would fuck everybody's girlfriends. You're living under a muff. Well, I do have a special person in my life. You fucking a retard? No, but like a month and a half ago, I, I asked her for a break because my life has been the only thing that's going well right now I would say is comedy.


But everything else has been, I'm not sure I'd say that. I'm sorry. Sorry. You're doing great. You're doing great. I apologize. It's okay. So what was too stressful that you Couldn't handle? Honestly, it was just like, she's like amazing You. know what I mean? And I was just like, my life was just, I was just like going crazy to be honest. Like I was like having mental breakdowns. My living situations sucked. Like I thought people were my friends and they were kind of like dicking me over and I was like going down and I was just like, I Dunno where I'm gonna be. Were you on drugs? No. I've been sober for over a Year now. But What were you on before the soberness?


Weed and cocaine mostly. Yeah. Why'd you get sober? What made you decide to like, I'm glad you asked that. Thank You. Okay. Thank you. I got sober. Thank you. Jews are great questions. I Got sober because I was doing shitty drugs with shitty people and having shitty experiences. How do you think they felt You were their bottom. They're like, they're like, dude, I did cocaine until 8:00 AM with a weeping willow last night I got cheerer regrets. Wow. Were you sober when you hit your head or were you drinking? No, I was sober the last time. Like that time I talked about. Yep. The house in Florida that you rent out for your entire living.


Yeah. Did you inherit that from a dead grandparent? I did. Yeah. Right. How long ago did that happen? That my grandfather passed away? Yes. Or that I got, he died when I was, I would say like 17 years ago. And you got the house how long ago? Over Covid. And how much do you get a month from that? 1800. Okay. Yeah. 18. Why was there such a gap between when he died and they gave you the house? Were they helping anyone else would take it? Because This is what happened to his sister first. This is what happened. So my mom bought the house, or my dad, sorry, my grandfather bought the house, but also put my grandmother's name and my mom's name.


So it was like once they passed away, it was in my mom's name. And then Covid happened in My marriage. We're gonna go to our senior real estate correspondent a shafi on this. Okay? So what you gotta do is diversify. First of all, that's the most important thing. You could have sued your mom for neglect, okay? Yeah. And gotten that house earlier. You got it. That's the important thing. Those are, those are assets Regardless. And instead, all you got from your mother is her hair. All right, Ladies and gentlemen, that's enough of that.

I, I You know you gotta all these sets, you are doing something that is just absolutely inconceivable. Let me remind You, guys that You know Cam more than any other regular ever in the show's history that you're used to, including one of the newest ones. Ari Matti Cam has been doing it much, much less and moved less time by, by a half a decade. And also Cam just moved to a real comedy city fucking a year or two ago. Yeah. Like, I mean, you were stuck out in Florida at open mics where, where David Jolly was. Dave Chappelle and Fucking You know you just raised the bar recently. So people are really getting to watch you perform at an extremely high rate. The fact that you have fucking unbelievable sets that you love 95% of the time is an unbelievable batting average for someone like you.


So just know that you're a fucking legend and then everyone else isn't as good As you. There he goes. Cam Patterson Ladies and gentlemen, fucking star. Another person from the inside. Ladies and gentlemen, this is 60 seconds uninterrupted from a brand new comedian out of the bucket. Armando Hernandez, everybody Oh My God.

I don't wanna just clinging onto this thing like it's my fucking dick and I'm five years old all night. What? You ain't I've ever seen a blind dude use echolocation before You. know what I mean? It's gonna get really awkward when I start trying to touch the touch the judge's faces and do some roasting You.


know what I mean? I'm gonna be like, who got the Humpty hump nose? Or it's gonna be like Rocky Dennis are from Fucking Mask. I'll be like, you are beautiful on the inside. Well, I tell you what I get often get compared to Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles and I find it to be an anorism. Mainly because there is a blind Latino that's already famous. You know, not that and You know. It's just way more accurate. You know what Ray Charles is pretty accurate. I love to do dope and lay the pipe. That's my time folks. Armando Hernandez. Hell yeah.


Armando, how does it feel? You just performed at the sphere And I had no shit. Well also, I love the fact that You know everybody gave me a standing ovation and the titty girl was over here flashing me You know. How do You Know? That's usually, that's usually how I imagine all this shit going. How do You know? There's a titty girl? It was mentioned by name a couple times also. Isn't it unfair have her like, let me, we can do a little squeeze and say, how do you do to one another that could be arranged, right? I mean, Jesus Christ. It's only fair If you're, if you're blind.


Do you feel a bomb more than people? What did you feel? I feel It. Four senses extra strong. I thought it was going, it was a little bit of a rough set. But you really brought it home with the Jose Feliciano reference at the end. I thought that was great. Yeah, it was a rough, it's good for the holiday. It was. It was a rough set. But enough about your eyes. So Armando, what's up? Were you born blind? No. Two head trauma accidents occurring throughout my childhood resulting in detached retinas. I'm just lucky, I guess God decided to hit me with the three stooges going, Okay, let's go back to the head injuries.


Yeah. What or what exactly happened? A trampoline accident. Were you just rocking really hard? Oh yeah. Did you have a really, really, really, really, really big haircut before and you couldn't see it and you were running into things You know, just doing all them things and you get your head rocked You know don don't know what, what specifically would you like to know about it? One was a football accident. Yeah. And one was at a water slide park. At a Water slide Park. You, yeah, you hurt your head. You attached a retina buddy. You gotta give us more information than That. So did you, It's a, now it's a now defunct organization. There's no litigation. Ari, Hold on, hold on.


Armando. No jokes at this point. We're trying to figure out the real deal here. Oh, I was just with, with some You know kind of grimy cousins from the Bay Area. And we was running away from the security 'cause they got up to no good in the water slide park. And I slipped, fell, hit the back of my head and had to Get up and keep running with these fucking You. know what I mean? Punk teenager cousins of mine. So let me ask you this. You had the football accident first, right? Yes. And did one retina, retina detach then? Yes. And that took about a year or two to You know, get over the hump and then the same shit happened fucking when I was 12. Did you find out or something that you have like a genetic retina problem? Or is this just an absolute insane coincidence?


Yeah, the Stanford doctors wanted to make me a Guinea pig fucking exam monkey with that same thing in mind. It was kind of like, it can we prove a genetic linkage to being predisposed. And I did have somebody in my family have such a detached retina and fucked up eyes that his eyeball actually like came out of his shit 'cause of loss of pressure and shit. So wait, you're, you're saying that the Stanford doctors wanted to study you and you said it like you said no, correct? No, it is just, it was weird in that they You know were unable to kind of get any direct linkage. So I was able to get a bunch of surgeries kind of like done by people who would otherwise not have interest.


So they tried You, know what I mean? God bless 'em. But here I'm at You, know what I mean? Yeah. Can you see shapes or anything? No. I have some light sensitivity in the right eye still. So if you like held up a fucking exam, I You know what I mean? I might shy away like Nosferatu or something. Like a flashlight. If we put it right up to your eye, you would see it. Yeah. Yeah. It sucks because I can't see headlights till it's way too fucking late. And if you got hit by a car, I mean, that would be insane because Well, I'll tell you, Tony, I have been hit by cars, but that those are head injuries for another day. Wow.


Absolutely incredible. Armando, you did it. You got pulled out of the bucket. The stairways right to your right. Go right ahead. Runoff Armando. Wow. Welcome to Skank Fest, Ladies and gentlemen. Where wow, detached retinas are a real thing. We have a special treat for you right now before we get back to the bucket. A KILL TONY legend coming hot off of a set Madison Square Garden.

The magician one. I'm glad I didn't do that one there. It was much bigger than this. I love Hans. I I love you. Your jokes are fucking mean. Most of them are well written. I think you're great. Thank you. Yeah. I enjoy a good pedophile joke. Fucking racist joke. Fuck Oakland. I was just terrific. Thank you. Wow. Trying to rally them for you. Alright. It seems like you have a little something. I got Pissed so fucking bad Dude. Really? Oh, you have to pee. I do. Hold on. I'm really Sorry. Wait, really sorry, dude. I got a piss. Wait. There's no wait, wait, wait. We get in trouble every time you take your dick out. Wait, this ain't m Msg.


Hold on. I was kidding about wanting piss thrown on me. This is desecration of the American flag's. So fucking long. Wait, what is, what do they have here behind is going on? Is this a shield of some kind? No. What is going, I guess it's already Shafi habitual line Stepper and KILL TONY. Regular. Really from the beginning, honestly. I mean, I was there in the Belly room days. The main room. Houston, the Vulcan, the comedy mothership, the LA Forum Master Square Garden. And now here at the greatest comedy festival in the world. Skunk Fest, hosting the greatest live podcast in history. KILL TONY. And I honored it. I honored this meeting of great minds in the way.


The only I can do, I stepped over a line. Regrettably, YouTube will not be able to show what I did. But man, let it be said. It was wild. It was the greatest moment in Skank Fest history. Definitely the most talked about of the year by far. I had acidic Jewish friends have found out about it on their own. Not through me or anybody else on their own. It was nuts. You, guys. It was nuts. But YouTube can't show it honestly. Streamers wouldn't be able to show it. TV wouldn't be able to show it. The dark web would've a problem with it. But honestly, that should be a lesson to you. You should come to live shows. Live shows are where the craziest things happen. And I've been there for some nuts playing that You guys haven't seen stuff that got cut out.


I was there when, when David Lucas got sick of Tony's comebacks and he just got mad. don don't know, but he is tried to attack. We tried to tackle him. Tony being a a wrestler, but background reverse. Put a single leg, used David's severe body weight against him, pulled him to the ground, pulled his pants down, and gave him what David later called the greatest butt fucking of his life. I was there. What other Mo? Oh, I was there when we met Cam Patterson's, real parents. A white couple that adopted him and raised him from a young boy in a small town outside Boise, Idaho. Yeah. Cam doesn't talk that way. That's an affectation he puts on, he's also into shells. Not rocks, but it's good for the show. So we had to cut it out. I was not there for the Diddy episode that I heard about from lots of people and rumors and innuendo.


No one will tell me exactly what happened. They just go, I don't wanna talk about it. don don't wanna talk about it. Even Tony goes, don don't wanna talk about it. Wow. Release the episode. Tony. I wanna see that Diddy thing. All I, the only thing I heard from people was they go during that Diddy episode was they go, David Lucas was hungry for it. What does that mean? David Lucas was hungry for it. Damn. don don't know. But anyway, I want to even tell you was what I did. But Red Band said he, I can't. He said, even if I tell you what happened, you two might demonetize their account. Red band was visually shaken by this. That's how great a moment it was.


And what let's Give it up for Tony for being able to put on a thing like that. Man, I stepped over a line. He set up a line that I can step over God. He rules. Actually, I'm switching allegiances now from the Yankees to the greatest franchise. KILL. TONY. God, I want to tell you it was an announcement. It was an announcement that my new tour just went on sale right now. God, the Farewell Tour. I'm doing a short tour and then I'm leaving the country. Yeah. Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, Alberta, Florida, Pittsburgh, Denver. And I'm entering in Anchorage, Alaska. They got Lake Tahoe in there. Few other places. Go to rfi.com right now for tickets. Reasonably priced. I say 50 tickets at 20 bucks each for every theater I do for the poor people.


It's a wild fun show. But after that, I'm calling it The Farewell Tour because I'm leaving. I'm leaving to reflect on the style of comedy I've gotten into. Now, of course, my jokes are good. My last special was one of the most widely regarded specials of all time. 7 million views on YouTube. June, go check it out right now. But I do a thing on podcasts where I just like to go for it. And after this one, don don't think there's anywhere left to go. I did the math. Me and Tony and Red Band talked about it later. Jeff Ross wouldn't talk to me after this. He said, I, I gotta be not around you for a while. Norton left, immediately went to masturbate. I think the next place I can go is Human Sacrifice.


And I don't think, I don't think I can do that. Also, human Me sacrifice is too much blood. And for YouTube, if they can't show blood here, how they gonna show blood? Maybe I'm saying too much. So I'm gonna go walk the earth. Everyone, I'm gonna do this Farewell Tour. Tickets available to fare.com right now. Portland, did I say Portland? And then, and then I'm gonna go reflect on, on, on, on what I am. I think I'm done. I think I'm just going back to regular jokes. The next time you see me on KILL TONY, my dick won't come out. That's, that's hard and fast. Not, we won't cut it up. It just won't be on there.


When I'm on Ro Rogan, I'm not gonna piss in in Bud Light bottles anymore. I'm not gonna piss in any bottle. I'm just going back to jokes on podcasts. Standup is always just jokes, but podcasts. I like to go for it. So guys, let's get back to the episode. I'm gonna hand it back to Ohio's probably greatest twink in history. Tony Hinchcliffe. Tony, please guide these guys into the end of the episode and I'll let you apologize to Red Band, most of all for having to clean up my mess, literally for having to clean up my mess. Guys, it was such a fun moment. People were, it was wild. It was wild.


Tony, take it. Take it away, man. It was so fun. Red was like emotionally hurt by it. Red band later was like, I what? The don don't know what to do. Ro said like I I, I, he needs help. I'm a shafi and I've been triggering the UNT Triggerable since 2001. Enjoy the rest of the episode. I'll see you next time. I'm on Kil Tony. Ladies On antibiotics, Ladies and gentlemen, shout out to our sponsors if we still have any sponsors sponsor.

Naughty, naughty boy, Ari Shafi, Ladies and gentlemen. Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, Wow. And one big round of applause for Brian Redban and Tony, the golden Bonus.
