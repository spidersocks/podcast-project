I would love my child no matter what, but if he's trans, I'll say the same thing about his penis. I say, every time he wants me to get him a puppy, you're gonna have to keep it and take care of it till it's fully grown. Then you could decide. If it's not cute anymore and you wanna get rid of it, I'll support that. He's not trans though. He's just regular autistic. It took a long time to get him diagnosed too.


'cause he is good looking enough. Everybody just assumed he was an asshole this whole time because when he was really little, doctors are worried that he might be mentally retarded. Yeah. They didn't call it that though. They called it starting to look like his father. It was. It was only 'cause they were both bald and chubby and drank from a bottle. So they shouldn't piss themselves.

You can't, what's it called? It's called Jack Daniels. I love it.


He set me up. He set me up. So it's kind of important. It's, hi. So I have a lazy eyelid. And a lot of you may not realize this, but the lazy eyelid community is very underrepresented in Hollywood. It's, there's really only one reason for that, which is we've had a mega star on top for several decades who stopped at nothing to hold the rest of us back. That ends today. Fors Whitaker, A Spotlight. I'm Whittier and I'm your nemesis.


Forest Whitaker. When I was a little girl, I used to get bullied for having a lazy eyelid. They called me Quasimoto sloth from Goonies, Rocky after the fight. And I used to cry the whole way home. And then I'd be happy 'cause I turned the TV And there was my hero. Lisa left eye from TLC. She used to celebrate having a lazy eyelid, but then she died of unnatural and unexpected circumstances. Rest in peace legally. I am not saying Forret Whitaker had a thing to do with it.


I'm just saying it's pretty freaking convenience At Forret Whitaker. You think we didn't notice that Biggie Smalls was part of the lazy eyelid community was they never did find his killer, did they? It's almost as if the detective was so close to the case. He couldn't see the forest through the trees. Not even with two good eyes. How many children won't be oppressed anymore when you fall? When you fall?


How many lazy IED stars will be born when you, when you follow Forest Whitaker, you had the chance to show the world. It's not just you. There's more of us out here. We're talented, we can do things. Instead, He's out here acting like y'all need him to normalize normal eyes, also known as atypical.


And for Whitaker, seen you waltzing around the Star Wars universe in Rogue One trying to send us a message. And you're gonna be the only one in the future with a lazy island. Clearly He wants total annihilation, but not on my watch. It's a long Song. Not even with two Good Eyes. How many children won Be the best anymore when you fall, when you, I'm your nemesis.


Your move For us Whitaker. Your move. Wow. Molly. Molly, you are cool as shit song's. A little long Little Pink Floyd esque. I didn't realize Melancamp song is like, what The fuck? Yeah, it she was like shine on you crazy eyelids over here. It's like a 14 minute long fucking I know. Start Slow goes back to the chorus twice. Or Whitaker Pass, by the way. Yeah. If a song, if a song falls in the forest Whitaker. Alright. In, in my defense, that was after several decades of oppression.


So that's a Long song. I get it. You think your eyelids are lazy? You should see D Madness is actual eyeballs. They're the laziest eyeballs. They've done nothing his entire life. That song's called Run for Run. Just everybody. Amazing. So good. You are such a cool person. I love your style. Molly McGee. You're leaving here with the big joke books. Write it, write another minute. Come up, sign up again. Okay, there you go. She caught it. Molly McGee. Everybody job. How fun. Great job. Two musical guests in a row plowing through it.

Yeah, so the first two weeks I was what they call the wine position. So you talk to everybody in wine and ask them what you want and you tally their meat numbers.


Have you been there, Michael? Relax over there. Can we keep 'em over here? Jesus, describe what do you have in your own side conversations where you're cracking up at the, the number thing. Relax over there, Mike. Yeah, So I call it the glorified Chick-fil-A person. Yeah. 'cause because you're going down the line, you're like expectation manager. And so once you sell your 20 pounds of Turkey for the day and nobody else is, you can't guarantee Turkey. So if like somebody's got their heart set, you know, and waiting three hours in line and it's like, sorry, I'm outta ribs. So they gotta try tomorrow. So you got sweet talk 'em out of it. Yeah. Okay, so let's do a little thing. Let's do a little, gimme a little barbecue music. And I'm going through the line here at the barbecue restaurant and I've been waiting in line for hours and here we go.


Hmm. God, I love the barbecue music here. Oh, I'm finally up in line. Oh, hey, how are you? What's, can I get some food? Hey, Yeah. Welcome to Franklin guys. Have you ever been here before? No. Cool. So let me tell you, so I got, I got brisket available. We have our, our pork spare ribs, we have pulled pork, we have Turkey, and we have our house sausage and our jalapeno cheddar sausage. I'm in the mood for ribs. Do you have ribs? I do have Ribs available. Oh, you're supposed to be outta ribs. One rib. I wanna find out what it's like when you're outta something. I'm sorry you have all that stuff, but I'm really here for the ribs. I've been waiting all day for ribs, So I, I can't guarantee you ribs. Oh, you're not. But my guarantee is in the pink sweater about 20 people ahead of you.


So once she gets up to the front, I'll come back to you and I'll let you know if I still have some, oh, if you're lucky, you can have 'em. I can't mark you down for 'em, but if you have 'em, you can grab 'em. Huh? I like, what a fucked up system. Let's go. Regular lighting here. I just figured out what what you do. That is so interesting. So they're deep in the line when you talk to them. Yes. And they're starving. Yeah. And they've been waiting for hours. Yeah. And you just come up to them. Are you dressed like that when you go up to these hungry, angry, starving people? Just, hello? This like, the lady in the pink sweater's going to eat what she wants.


Best of fucking luck to you. I can't guarantee anything. What the fuck? That's just, what's the angriest Somebody's gotten at this part with you? Has it happened yet? Has there been like, Come on, man. I bet too many people. I bet some you get a lot of bride stuck There. Well, there, there was an angry lady who didn't understand that she couldn't just reserve a table for two hours while they waited in line A liberal, am I correct? Liberal vibes, purple hair? No, I, she was like suburban San Antonio. Okay. So I think like, she was like, you know, a a, she was a country club kind of person. Ah, she, she didn't realize like why they couldn't just like, you know, bribe me a hundred dollars to like skip the line.


Right. Yeah. Yeah. Is that the most you've been bribed? No. I mean, she didn't like, I mean, for barbecue, Ask for a bribe. But, but I mean, people, people will like ask if they Could. What's the highest you've been offered? Me personally, I haven't been offered, but I know people have. Yeah, you don't look like you would even, you look like you would just take the money. They'll like, gimme a sandwich, you know, like, yeah. Was it Franklin? I'll give off more of that vibe. Yeah, It's a good barbecue joint. Do you try any of the other barbecue? Do you eat barbecue?

No, Terry Box is funny because it's always the one that people go to first when they come to town and, and then they come to us when like, they really have time to dedicate to it. But, but I would say like, everybody's like surprised when they're like, oh wait, like we went to Terry Blocks and this is way better. Let's go to our senior barbecue correspondent, Brian Redban. Is it true that you go through the line though to ask what people are getting before the, the restaurants even open though. So you're almost like creating this weird like, you know, like, like people can't get anything no matter what.


He's gonna think of a better question in just a moment. People Yeah, that's what we just described. Yeah, exactly. No, no, but but you do it before the restaurant's even open though. Why do you are you just not make enough? Yeah, so we open up the restaurant at 11 and we start talking to people in line at like 8 30, 9 o'clock. So by the time we open at 11, like we already know, like who's gonna, you know, be guaranteed beef ribs or pork ribs. Beef ribs are only on Friday, Saturday Sundays. So you gotta show up early for those. I like that. Yeah. It's a business. You know, when we were comics we, we'd order dominoes, right? And then we'd order Pizza Hut, we'd make both people eat their other thing. We'd film Pizza Hut eating dominance and dominoes eating pizza.


And they were like, no, we can't do that. We'd videotape 'em and then they got fired from eating. Literally they would, they wouldn't eat the competition. I eat, I eat the competition. Incredible. Wait, I have something for this. Hold on. Oh, okay. I love this CARROT. TOP one into The good. These are good. I gotta stand up for this one, dude.

There's never been anything like it. Someone like him writing and performing a new minute every week while putting it together. The long, long sets that he does on the road, and somehow kicking out a new minute every week on this show. This looks like a familiar name. Coming back outta the bucket for the first time in a while. Makes some noise. A new minute from Jake Coulter. Everyone. Jake Coulter.


So did anybody else used to think that bestiality was illegal? Because that's how you create supreme beings like, like getting a dog pregnant creates werewolves. Getting a horse pregnant creates centar, flushing your calm down the toilets and to, to the ocean or sends it to the ocean. Getting fish pregnant, creating mermaids, but's. See, I'm gullible and white trash. So the second I realized I was attracted to every mermaid I seen on tv, I was like, yep, there's gotta be my daughters.


And like I've seen the Little Mermaid. So obviously my next move was to go get some scuba shit so I could find some Octa bitch, somehow convince her to use her magic to take my new kids' voices away before my new kids tell someone else that I'm their dad. And I get charged with bestiality. There it is. All the way to the limit. Jake Coulter, welcome back. Jake. Thank you. Thank you. I remember you. Oh, I hope that's a good thing.

And I was like, you know what, it's ah, it's gonna take me two months to get on KILL TONY. No, it's been a long time. Okay, so you saved 10 grand on, and that was Halloween, right? Yes. So you've just been blowing through that since you got Here? No, no, no. You know, I have savings. I, I'm 45 years old. Tony. I graduated from Texas a m 20 years ago, bro. Again, that's one of the local regular audience members cracking up.


He laughs at the funniest things. So something about saying that you graduated from Texas a and m 20 years ago. Really? Got 'em. So you saved a bunch of money. What do you spend your money on Chanel? I don't, I don't spend money, man. What's your living situation? Okay. I moved here to an Airbnb, right? I, I rented the master bedroom. It has its own bathroom, right? And then like, after the first month, I was like, Hey bro, let's go off. Let's forget about Airbnb. Let's just do our own thing. So I'm just renting a room in this house. Look, Tony, I've done a lot of things in my life. I've taught English in Thailand, I've graduated from, I didn't wanna do any of those things. Tony, this is the first time I've ever had a clear goal in my life.


I moved to Austin for this. Tony, You turned really Japanese, right? Then the Japanese side really came out. Did you guys notice that? He was kind of just a, okay, so you moved to Austin specifically to become a star on Koni. I always, have you been practicing? Have you been doing other open mics? It's a long story, Tony, but it's So bizarre that people just wait and don't pra. It's like if you went to go perform at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and it's like, I'll just wait to learn guitar there. I'm gonna pick up a guitar when I get there in Nashville and I'm gonna show them.


You could do, there's literally open mics fucking everywhere every night. There's like 15 a night minimum here within blocks of each other. And you've chosen not to. I was doing those, Tony, I did 'em for a long time for the first like till January and like, it'd been like 15, six Mondays. And I was just like, oh. You're like, you're like, this has been two months. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it, dude. Mics are mics. I need an audience, don't he? Okay. You need jokes first, then the Audience will come bad. There you Go. I wasn't funny. I wasn't funny. It is true. You're a little bit, you have your, you have your business a little outta order.


I'm gonna give you a joke you can do so when you go out, you have, fuck, let's find a good one. Shit, there's not been a good one yet. So when you go out, you say, so this is for, this is for redneck women, so they can still feed their babies and still smoke. We're gonna watch the, we're gonna watch the prices, right? So the kids see the kids, the kids, ah, fuck. If it's not working with him, oh shit. Lipstick stain, You know, he actually has a, he's half Japanese, half Mexican.

I got the shitty one. It's getting real scary at the bottom of this truck. You know, the sad thing is I had to make, I'm just drilling a fucking hole in this. Seriously. I'm backstage. What are you doing? I'm just drilling a hole in this fucking baby baby's asshole. But it's gonna be great. Un KILL TONY. Oh, This is so fucking awesome. You're getting to the bottom of the box. It's, It's getting kind desperate. It's getting wacky down there.
