It's not only, it's literally like, it's so, there's like blood in the street. Yeah. I mean, there's blood stains on the concrete.


Yeah. and you don't know if it's like a homeless person that's attacked a civilian. Yeah. Or the man had his period. It's very confusing. Yeah. There's migrants everywhere. Believe it or not, people, I welcome migrants to this country with open arms and by open arms, I mean like this. Hey, I welcome migrants. I need someone to raise my kid. Yes, absolutely. You do have a newborn. We're sending some KILL TONY baby clothes. I just ruined a surprise, but I want the people at home to know that I'm a good person. Oh, thank You. I love that. You think I kept him. We have abortion size kids clothes to wrap the fetus in.


Right here. The Ziploc Bag comes, comes in a little KILL, TONY ashtray. Yeah. and you put the fetus in the ashtray and you put your Siggy out. There's actually Anor, there's an abortion clinic here called Kill Tony's Babies. It's true. It is fully operational. They have a lot of blood on their hands. Whitney, you've done the show numerous times. From the belly room to the main room, to Vulcan to the mothership. All around the, the home fields. You know how it works. 256 people signed up tonight for the opportunity. The hope to get pulled out of this bucket. If I pull their name out, they get 60 seconds. You know their time is up near the sound of a kitten. That means they have to wrap it up then, or else they bring out the Angry West Hollywood bear.


They're all loaded up across the street at a big, crazy dirty bar called Poor Choices. And I pull a name out. We go and we wrangle the person that looks like a fun name. It's mister. It starts with mister. That's always a very good sign of insanity. So that'll be fun. And while they go wrangle that person, we're gonna get started with one of our elite regulars on this show. You are here on a special night because this man is taking the world by storm. Not only did he just complete doing sold out theaters with me in Florida, he also just opened up the shows this weekend. The theater shows in San Antonio for Joe Rogan's new Netflix special burn.


The boats streaming on Netflix right now. This guy is undisputed, undeniable. We absolutely love him. Make some noise for the Estonian assassin. Ari Matti. Yoni Yoni. I was on a Reddit the other day, like a loser. And I read that the American military doesn't accept trans people into the ranks just like you.


I was upset. Let them die. If they wanna Let that bitch, Let him let They die. But then I thought about it and it kind of makes sense why as a military force, pseudo and trans people on your ranks, because let's be honest, they have a history of switching sides. I don't wanna see you walking around Kabul market trying on turbines like Oh, My, God.


This is so me. I don't Want no progressives on my battlefield. I want a closeted, God loving retard out there following orders. Alright, Maddie's done it again. Ladies and gentlemen, A brand new minute, 20 seconds doing more work than he even has to flexing on us. His take on trans in the military. I just bombed with that joke so hard in the other room. Just silenced It. I love that. It takes balls to fucking, that's You know.


A lot of people don't know that about doing comedy. A lot of it You know. Sometimes you're coming right off of another set. Maybe the crowd's bad. Maybe you didn't do it the right way. Let, let's just talk about it. What do you think happened in the other room? I didn't. I fucking forgot to watch the previous comedian. So I didn't know that. I thought, oh, I'm having fun in the green room. We're all riffing. Yeah, Tony Hinchcliffe. We're all having a great time. I didn't know the other, the other room. There's a fucking funeral happening. You know. Right? One tree The other. So I went, I went with this energy. Yoni Yoni Yoni. Right. Kill trans people. You Know. Yeah. Kill Him. Kill him. Kill Him. You know, right? Of course. I'm gonna eat Shit, dude.


Watch the comedian before you. You Fuck. yeah. Yeah. If you bomb with kill trans people in Texas, it is your fault. Very true. So true. It's such an interesting thing that you bring up though, because we never get to talk about You know, working it out, different rooms, different audiences. Obviously this is a fresh crowd. Not jaded yet. That crowd has been watching an open mic for an hour and 40 minutes. And a lot of the regulars here try to squeeze onto that show to get us set in before performing here. And it's all just a short walk. It's You know. Tunnel away. Yeah.


It's amazing. And yeah, so that, that's a little fun fact that we never get to perform. But Love that process of like writing jokes. You know. It's hard to just, after like 12 years of doing comedy to do minutes You know. Yeah. Like, especially my style. It's like I just, I'm super slow and shit, so Right. I, I just have to write new stuff. You know. But you do it very, very well. Oh, thanks. And everything breaks down to a minute. You know. So what else is going on in the world, Ari? We had fun in San Antonio this weekend. It's pretty crazy, huh? Yeah. Yeah. You gave me an amazing intro and shit. It was cool. Like seven people out of 2000 knew me, so. Yeah, It's true. It's what a weird open, what a bold choice by Joe Rogan, by the way, to have this guy open.


Yeah. Just a fucked up accent. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. It's fun. Hello. Netflix You. know It was you then Ron White, then me, then Joe Rock. Solid lineup. You always get the crowd popping.

And it comes out of a second hole. That's the interesting thing is that if you take in someone else's urine, you pee that out.


Isn't that interesting? There's, thank you Red band. They wouldn't have gotten the joke if you wouldn't have done that. So, Ari, what else is going on? Everything's good. Yeah, it's good.

Alright, your next bucket poll 60 seconds uninterrupted for Justine Fini, Ladies and gentlemen. Here comes Justine. Here we go. Feminism. That was the joke. So I get into a lot of arguments with women about feminism because I'm an anti-feminist. They assume that I'm a feminist. That's fine. But here's the thing, I'm just trying to figure out what was the problem. Because if you ask me, women were staying at home getting taken care of, not working. But yet somehow that wasn't enough.


As You know, women like to argue. We like to complain. So yeah, the, we just fought for our right to vote and we got it. Okay, cool. So we're voting Now. I don't understand. Why do feminists assume that I'm a feminist? Just because I vote doesn't make sense. So here's my question to all the feminists out there. What about the toilet seat? Yeah. If you're a feminist and you think that men and women are equal, then shouldn't we be putting the toilet seat up? It's only fair to the men. And second, what if you're on a sinking boat?


You really gonna tell me that men and women are still equal? I don't think so. Ladies and gentlemen, Justine Fini Whitney is clapping harder than the other 300 people in the room right now. Just to keep You guys at home posted of what's happening. That was incredible. An incredible amount of silence in the room. I mean, actually, truly shocking. Even Mr. Heath had some people laughing at him, laughing at himself, laughing at himself. One guy laughed. He's like, at least you get it right. Mr. Heath at least had one person that he didn't realize was laughing at him.


Bombing, you bombed so hard. I feel that, That literally nobody was even laughing at how bad you were doing. It was more sad than it was anger inducing or disappointing. It was just really, really sad. I really think that while you talked about how you're an anti-feminist, I think feminists are funnier than you. No, I And, and they're the, some of the least funny people in the world and, and here you are dissing them while bombing. So the, this was a win for the feminists.


How long have you been doing standup comedy? That was my fourth time. Okay. Very good. That's at least refreshing. If you've been doing this for years, going around just destroying the energy in rooms, that would be incredible. I have a feeling that Ari Matti had to go up right after you in the other room tonight. Whitney, I know we're not supposed to have trans women in sports, but can we get them in comedy? Like, is that, I'm totally kidding. This is good. This is good for women. This is not bad for women. She bombed so hard. They're gonna draft her into the military. Yes. And they don't even want women. Yes. So let's talk about it.


Justine, let's talk about your life a little bit. Okay. I feel like we can dig up some stuff that you should be talking about because you, you when, if you're doing anti-feminist material, you should be able to get laughs and you were unable to accomplish that. But again, you're very new. So let's figure it out. Let's break it down. Okay. What do you do for work? I clean luxury vacation homes. So like million dollar homes. Okay. I think I might actually have a job for you then. Cool. Cool. I think I might be able to make you a real American citizen. Justin. Changing lives here tonight. So Justine, what are, what are some of your passions?


What are you into in life? Do you have any hobbies or special skills or talents or anything? I am a recreational kickball team captain. I do exercise science, but yeah, I do a lot. I do quite a Lot of stuff. Shut the fuck up the entire episode. No, don't talk. Don't over here. Stop. Relax. You know you. You're like talking. Yes. Do you hear how you're talking now? God, stupid. You see how I'm like right here? You see how if I don't have a mic, you like hear me? 'cause you're a teacher.


You're, you think you can talk during this because you make minimal amount of money and destroy society. Like why would you, you're not a good person. Teachers aren't even like liked anymore. She's in a good, they're not respected. They're not liked. Shut the fuck up. I'm the teacher of this classroom. And you're being a bad student anyway. I'm dealing with, I'm dealing with so many fucking issues right now. She's in a good mood. She just fucked one of her students. Okay, so you don't say words. No. Late.


Okay guys. Yeah, just you're gonna have to, I, if you say anything else, they're going to literally kick you out. We're gonna have to edit this fucking part out. 'cause you're such a dumb cunt that you had to keep talking after I told you to not talk. You had to update your table about why you're talking and how silly it is. And what I said because 'cause you're such a, It's amazing. You manage someone in like to have someone in Texas not believe in the First Amendment, ma'am? Yeah. Yeah. This is why the second Amendment exists is so that we can shoot people like that in the fucking head. I don't get it. I'm a teacher. Shut the fuck up. Look. Look at this guy. You see how fucking polite he is. He's ducking down. Yeah. Keep going. Your pedophile.


Keep going. Keep going. Bunch of freaks in this audience tonight. Pedophiles know how to tiptoe quietly. Yeah, exactly. Alright. Okay. Done being mean to the teacher. Let's go back to Justine. So you're a professional kickball captain. Yep. Okay. So that's, that's nothing that can relate to anything. What made you start standup so recently? What made you want to get into this? I actually did it a couple years ago and I took a little break. So I've been off stage for two years. I will, I will be honest with you.


I, that what I just said was pretty much not my set. I pretty much forgot what I was gonna say when I came out here. So Do you remember it now? A little bit more. Why don't you do one of the things that you were gonna do. Okay. Instead of whatever the fuck that was. don Don't even know what I said. Like I don't even remember what I said. I remember every single word. Do you Oh, it was so bad that it's imprinted in my head forever. I have P-T-S-D-I. Okay. Well I will say that


I have to use Talkspace dot com to using the promo code. KILL TONY saving $80 off my first month. It's the code space 80 Talkspace dot com slash Tony. I need therapy because of what you said.


Okay. If you reading ads is funnier than a woman standup. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna kill myself. It's unbelievable. It is unbelievable. Do you remember anything that you were gonna say? No. I will say I've done standup four times. I've never done the same joke or the same set. And my first time I did great. And so I thought I had it in me 'cause everybody thought I was hilarious. I got booked as the closer the next night. Wow. But I haven't done it for two years. And so I've never done any of the material I did To tonight. Okay. Let me interrupt you. Did you think about after that first set? Thanks for telling me to go. Did you think after that first set that went so great, did you think maybe you should have done some of the material that went so great? I, I was just naive and I didn't realize that comedians do the same material because they have to perform multiple times.


And I thought, oh, I can come up with all this fun stuff every Time when you're watching a musical production. Do you think that they're improvising everything in the moment? No. No. They never practiced that before or Thought about it. You're absolutely Not. No, it's fine. It's not that they're like a lot of podcasts these days that talk about how comedy works. So how would you ever know? No. Exactly. Like you Could, there's, you could listen to like Rogan breaks things down. Right? Like learning. There's a lot of ways. Like you're awesome. Like I I love watching you actually. You and it's just like doing it more and doing it consistently and listen to podcasts. 'cause we fucking drone on about Comedy. So I watch KILL TONY every week. Okay. And of course I'm a diehard fan. So Do You retain any of the information? I Do. I try to. Not, not knowing. Maybe I don't.


But yeah, I, I like to think I do and I knew, I did know that I might come up here and bomb, but I felt like it would be Let's continue. Be honored to roast. I got information about you. What's your living situation? Where do you live? I live in Phoenix, Arizona. Okay. Do you live by yourself? I live with my brother. We've been together 10 years as roommate.

I like to say it's the sport that people play when they can't play sports. That's also, that's also, that's a good point. You, I also have comedy for people that can't do comedy. Absolutely. Absolutely. Alright. There's gotta be more. Did anything traumatizing ever happen to you in life? My house was firebombed by a gang when I was 12. Okay. By firebombed do you mean like Molotov cocktails or what does that mean? So I lived next door to a gang. They poured gasoline around my house.


My dad was the starter of the block watch in our neighborhood. So they didn't like that. And I'd Like to hear the gang side of the story. I, I would too. My dad probably pissed them off, but Yeah.

He's, he made me do a joke for him on my first set and it was probably a lot better than what I did tonight. What was That joke? Okay. It was so bands, how do they think of these band names?


Right. We got panic at the disco. Imagine Dragons the weekend. One guy gets the whole fucking weekend. I don't get it. That was it. Fuck God. I mean, if, if your dad really wanted to help your comedy career, he should have just molested you. I mean that That's true. Honestly. That's true. And I don't think it's too late. That's what I'm prescribing. That's what I'm prescribing. John Fini. If you're listening because Your brother doing it obviously isn't helping much. Right. But if your dad did it. Yeah. Yeah.

I love the Lord and I love black church. I just hate when I'm the only one in my family that gets searched for weapons.


Fuck you, Dylan Roof. I'm a feminist and a degenerate gambler. That's why I love Bo betting on female boxing. I mean, I stopped watching porn for three months because I was so deep in the research. You ever been so ugly that people can't believe that you're a biological woman? Crazy. Mauricio Suleman says that women shouldn't be able to box more than two minute rounds. I say, fuck that. I think they could box three minute rounds and they could be drafted.


Yeah, man, I, I also know that there's not, there's no such thing as a women's power puncher. The last one I knew retired 14 years ago. And his name is Chris Brown. Thank y'all so much. True nickens. All right. There was a lot there. You were going, bouncing around from premise to premise. Did you say you stopped watching porn for three months? Yeah, I was. I was really deep into Katie Serrano versus Katie, Amanda Serrano versus Katie Taylor. What is that? That was a boxing match that happened last year. And I was so deep I stopped watching porn 'cause I kept watching all the matches and they were really bloody.


and you can't masturbate after watching bloody women. Unless You can't masturbate After watching bloody women, I masturbate two bloody women. Oh. That's what I searched for when I'm looking up porn. Okay. That was a joke that somehow got nothing. Alright, let's talk about it. So you bounced from boxing to porn, back to boxing. Was that about the Olympic lady? Yes. Yes. Yes. Because You know she's so ugly. Everyone's like that. Can't just be a woman. I, I think she's a woman. She lost nine times. You didn't mention that in your set. That would've been funny. Oh, Okay.


Yeah, there was, there's times Drew and You know a lot of people You know you're kind of a controversial regular Right. In the way that you have an incredible amount of brain damage. And You know. It's interesting, people are going to watch you grow on this show. They're going to watch you learn your specific type of specimen that's going to be more molded than someone who's flexing and showcasing their amazing work. Like an Ari Matti type. Right. Or like a Kam Patterson. You're a little bit more of a grower than a showerer comedy wise.


Right. So let's take note of what worked during that set, which was a moment where in between this stuff you just went ha ha. And it got a laugh. Yes. Because it was you, it was present. Drew Nickens in the moment. You understand what I'm saying? Yes, sir. It wasn't you pushing these ideas, this premises that you had loaded up and locked. It was you kind of taking a breath, right? Yes, sir. Being present in a moment. Yes. I I also lost like a thousand dollars on women's boxing. How'd you lose a thousand dollars? So McKayla Mayer got robbed versus Alicia Baumgartner.


I had three different women's boxing matches that week. And if she would've won, I would've made a Payday. You had a parlay. Not a parlay, but like, I had two parlays and then I had like one straight bet on her for about a thousand. You had a straight bet for a thousand bucks on a woman's boxing match. Yes. I had problems. You have an unbelievable amount of brain damage. This is incredible. Well, okay, women's sports, the, the skill gap between good and great is so much more than men's sports. That it's easier to win money on the favorite. It's Crazy. Women have these things you might not know about Drew once a month.


They have these things that happen and you, we, the betters or the viewers don't know when those are gonna happen. I'm a big fan of UFC. I have a couple friends that are female fighters, champions at times in their careers. And I'm not saying that perhaps they have been in a fight where it's been that time of the month, but it happens and they lose during that time. Their chemicals are off. It's a whole thing. Whitney, you wanna step in for me? Help me out a little bit. There's a lot of things that happen. You're the Expert on bloody Women. I mean, that's This. So it's a tough art form to gamble on because they, their mental, they their brains get a little wiry, right?


Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we lie Yeah. And cheat. Yeah. I mean, let me ask you this, Whitney, here's an interesting question that I guess is kind of relatable. Okay. Have you ever had a scheduled like special taping and that happens. Had My period in a special Yeah, no. Do you schedule it around that? Do you do like the opposite type of thing where you're like, okay, if I'm having it here, maybe I should schedule it for here. I mean, when we have our period, like our memories still work, right? Like we can Kind of not the women I've been with, like we Can still Pretty much function in And usually the week before is even worse half the time when it comes to your brain, right?


Red band that was red band, Ladies and gentlemen. Just in case it came across in the audio. Like it could be me. That was, I guess what I'm saying is that in sports you don't have a choice. It's scheduled out. And champions, this is like a fact can be wobbly. A lot of people say Rhonda Rousey, when she took the head kick from Holly Home, perhaps was going through woman issues. Do You know what a period is? True? Should we ask that Virgin? I feel like he knows more about this Than me. I, I had my mom. She had periods sometimes.


Right? How do You know that? Because she would be really angry like one week out of the month. Yeah, I love her though. She's my favorite. But, but no, she would get Rouche and she would have chocolate and Mountain Dew on deck. Like Right. All the essentials for periods. Right. Ma'am, This episode brought to you by Mountain Dew and Chocolate. Yeah. Ladies, I got it at the house. I just moved to Austin. So we're on deck You know you're out there losing bets.


Drew, I recommend doing writing and if you're going to bet on sports, do it using the DraftKings sports book. Download the app and use code KILL TONY. and you, If you bet $5, you instantly get $150 in bonus. That's Drew. It's true. Oh Great. I'll use that tomorrow. Thank you Drew. Ladies and gentlemen. There he goes. Drew Nickens everybody.


Well that's gonna go down in history is one of the most awkward moments in KILL TONY history. Remember the time that Tony tried to explain that it's not a good idea to bet on women's sports? 'cause they might have a period. And then he checked in with Whitney to see a female comedian schedule their specials around it. And the place got quiet and weird and everybody turned on Tony. And I haven't had my period in 30 years. You know that Tony. I love it. Ladies and gentlemen, back to the bucket. We go make some noise for Bill Carroll. Everybody come on. Make some notes for Bill. Everyone.


I think I might be straight because I finally made it through Brokeback Mountain without jacking off. It's, thank you. Here's something I've been wondering. Maybe this is something You guys can help me out with. Is it gay to suck someone else's dick? If there's a gun to your head, is that, what if you're the one holding the gun, is that, is that gay or is that just a hostage situation? What's Okay? The other day I saw this homeless guy and he had a sign that said Will change my mind about black people for $10.


It's weird. I figured I'd do my part. So I gave the guy 10 bucks. He was like, all right, well I don't like him anymore. Thank you Bill Carroll. Love it. Welcome. This is your first time on the show. This is my second time. Okay, great. The other one go good too. Not really. Great. Well look at you now. Yeah. Thank you. How Long ago was that performance? Your last one? It was about eight months ago. Okay. You've been working hard at it. Yeah, for sure. It, the eight months ago was the first time I had done standup, so it was, I did my debut on the show.


Oh, amazing. Yeah. So hell yeah. Yeah. There, you go eight months. Incredible. So very funny stuff, bill. You're doing it. You're living the dream. What did we find out about you last time you were on? What do you do for work? What's your Yeah, we found out I work at a factory in Los Angeles. I live in Austin, but I didn't then. Right. And I think we were indexing early on I that I was kind of an ordinary. I think you had pegged me. I was just ordinary boring white guy. Yeah. Yeah. But we found out I had an Asian girlfriend and pretty unusual. No, but the, the caveat she was Filipino and that was people seeing me.


Okay. Well what's your, what's your job now? Well, my days are numbered at the factory because my, it turns out the CEO of the company watches this show. Oh shit. It's not a big deal. It's, it's, it's all right. You. know what I mean? Like, I'm kind of a baby. I I probably should maybe move on. And I thought the factory was in la It's in Los Angeles. So I moved here after I did KILL TONY. I was doing mics in Los Angeles afterwards. And, but I lived in Manhattan Beach, which is just, it's totally irrelevant as far as like LA comedy goes. So I was like driving like an hour to go to Burbank and to go to third wheel comedy in East Hollywood.


And it was just terrible. So I was like, I gotta come to Austin and Right. Incubate. Yeah. So, so what do you do for work now? I still work there, but they Oh, you work at a factory in Los Angeles? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. How I'm trying to figure this out. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Red band for your edition of how Yeah. I, I I got this right Ben, thank you so much for the assistance here, but record hit 50 hard. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I was kind of getting to that. How, thank you. So how? Yeah, It's a good question. Tony. I, well, I'm a, I used to be there in person. I'm now remote and I just, I was, I was there last week.


They, they want, okay, hold on. Let me back it up a little bit. They would like to fire me because I moved to Austin very spontaneously and that wasn't part of the contract. But I'm a programmer, like a computer programmer and so I still work remotely. But they may, I I come back, back and forth pretty often. You really are an ordinary guy. I can't understand what you're saying. How does your Filipino girlfriend understand what you're saying? I can hardly follow. Yeah. How? How? Yeah. I don't know. Maybe she doesn't understand me. She, she's just along for the ride maybe. Is she with you or are you in the relationship remotely as well? I brought her with you.


She was part of the reason she wanted to leave Los Angeles as well. She went to USC. She had been there for like seven years. Right. And so I had done KILL TONY. I won't Get out here. Take me with you. Is that what she sounds like? Yeah, I was. I love you. What? Tongue hill. Wow. You go Austin. All Right. Okay. Very good. Sorry. That's racist. Absolutely incredible. How, How? She's here with me. She's here with me. Her name? Yeah. That Was her name's. How? Yes. Very Good. H-H-A-H-A. You Don't, don't, you don't have to do the math on that.


Let her do it. Bill, what do you do for fun now that you're here in Austin, Texas? I, we, we try to explore a little bit. We go to restaurants and check out the scene as much as we can. And I don't wanna say I do, I do too much of the open mic. I do open mics way too much. I think my girlfriend is, is maybe like starving as a result. What does she do when you're doing that? She stays at home and she is knitting. Ah. It's a new thing. It's a new thing. She's crocheting and she's knitting clothing. Ah, very good. Is she making clothes? She's making clothes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She Makes stuff. They're good at that. They are good at that.


We're finding out. Yeah, we, but I don't think she knew initially that it was an innate thing. She's kind of discovering it now and she works like she works crazy hours just knitting. It's almost self-imposed labor. Is she able to do it when she's on her period? Oh yeah. Yeah. Let's See. Me not wanting knit no more. My pussy bleed. I cannot knit while pussy bleed. Bill, you be doing too many open mic. Stay here with me. I'm emotional. Bill. Bill, bill, are you listening to me, bill? Yes, baby.

Tell us a deep, dark secret that you would never wanna share on a live podcast. Come on, bill. You got it. You got this bill. Be honest. All Right. I, I'll try one. This is the first thing that comes to mind. I love it.


Just, yeah. I suppose this, at this point, there's no more occupational hazards. We, we did this, they did deepest, darkest secret at the creek in the cave For a no one knows what any Sorry. I'm sorry. You just said is just My bad. When All Right, I'll, I'll just answer the question, Bill. Yes, sir. Well, I played a lot of soccer when I was growing up and when we were really young, like, like don don't really remember. Maybe it was like early teenager. We went to a camp in Pennsylvania. And so it was a bunch of guys who were in an old dormitory. And I think we were kind of like You know aimless. We didn't know what to do after soccer. So someone broke into the basement of the dormitory and they found a television, like an old You know tv.


And it had porn pornography on it. There was a, there was naked ladies and stuff going on on the tv. So we all, we all went down there. And porn, this is, it's gonna sound gayer than it was. It wasn't that gay. Like it's gonna, I know as You guys are thinking, but like, we didn't know what to do. Like, 'cause we're like new to I think jerking off and stuff. So people just had big like erections and they would like walk around. How do You know? They were big. I had nothing to base it off of. I swear they're bigger than mines. It was like they're big erections. don Don't know. You were seeing their erections. So, but It was through like mesh shorts. So everyone had a boner and they didn't know what to do with it.


They're like, bro, check it out. And like, I'd be like, dude, same. Yeah. But like that, that was the extent of it. But it's extreme. It's, it's very And then what happened? I think we just poured out for a little bit and then bounced. When you say poured out, We were just wa we were just casually watching like spectating pornography. We weren't participating as you normally would. It was Just you. You guys need to all get go hard tattoos on your right hand. That's what you and your former soccer team need. Yeah. Bill, what size joke book did you get last time you were on the show? I got one of the big leather guys. You got a big one? Yeah. Yeah. What did you do correctly to get that?

She kept asking, I kept saying no. We were going back and forth, back and forth. I finally slapped her and she got pissed. I was like, what do you mean you told me to slap you? She goes, yeah, not 15 minutes after sex. I was like, well maybe you don't talk during the movie. don. Don't know. You gotta be careful of hooking up though. Obviously abortion span in Texas. I knew a girl that got one two days before it was banned two days.

Or like rape or something. And then, and then she goes, she goes, my favorite is, and then just says the N word. Wow. I was, at first I thought she was joking. I was like, that's kind of funny.

I didn't get that far, but I would never You know. Obviously I work with the blacks. Yeah. And I never say the N word around them.

Wave it in front of him. No, I, it's pulling you down to It sucks. Like You know, Just looking here. You seem concerned. I'm joking. I know you really are concerned with people saying the N word. No, it's fine. I was gonna say like I love pussy but I love black people more so I had to Wait a second. What the fuck? Sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Shouldn't have done that. What is wrong? That is the craziest lie I gonna turn that's ever been told in the history of the show.

Were You guys. Close. You keep saying that you just talked with her. Yeah. I mean like we only talked for a couple months, but like we hung out like every day till then. So it was pretty I. don dunno, I don't feel like when you're like 23 and famous and you have fake tits in a hot tub, you can do whatever you want. And so like we get in like one argument and she's like, dude, fuck it. I'm downloading Hinge again. And I'm like, baby, no wait.


And that she needs to go on to unhinged. Yeah. And sounds like it's A little, And then it was a little too much. And I had to, I actually ended it with her. It was like it was too much where I couldn't, I just couldn't do it anymore. Right. And that disappointed her. Probably not. No. She started talking to a new guy like a week later, so she was fine. So She's just basically using you for content? Yeah. I think like we were using each other for content for a bit. For sure. That's Actually a great point. You've talking about her, she talks about you. Yeah. And then she just needed a guy that would come around and then so that I was doing that until I wasn't. And then she found the next one and he's probably so much better than me. So Oh, My, God.


Why would you say that? No, Don don't know. Like in what ways do you think he might be better than just I'm, I was a late, well it was hard when we first started talking, I had just gotten Sergio on my ankle, so I'm like, I'm on crutches. Like I literally couldn't do anything. Right. Like she had to like pick me up. I couldn't drive. It's not funny. All right. What the fuck? Piss me off Somehow. That's my favorite moment of the episode so far. You just saying things that might not funny. Shut up. Not funny guys. Shut up. Stop up.


If you could have seen the other people we pulled out of the bucket tonight. Actually went to high school with jt. He was on a couple people ago. Jt. Yeah, he's been doing it three years. Yeah. And it started with a question. It did not go Good. Yeah, that's what he told me. Yeah. Wait, what exactly did he tell you? This is a fun thing. I didn't realize he Said the exact Well 'cause he got pulled last week and I was like, I'm not even happy for you. Like I'm just jealous. Yeah. And pissed. And then he came up and he is like, I'm, I bombed. I was like, no you didn't. 'cause he said that last time. He was like, no, I actually did. And then he said it. He's like, yeah, I opened up a question. Tony was telling me that, saying that you were giving him like actual advice instead of roasting him. So I was like, that's something. Yeah. It's more of a heartfelt episode. Yeah. So Are are you gonna get canceled? Is that what You Feel?


No. don don't. I don't think so. I think it's fine. It's just like internet stuff. I'll be all right. I mean, dude, if like this would've, I think this went all right. If this would've gone terribly, I like would've killed myself tonight. Like, like, like this and the podcast episode coming out. There's like nothing for me, But it went good. You think So? Yeah, it did. Thanks Tony. I think it went real good. You got a big joke book last time you were on, you got a little one. Yeah. Well guess what buddy? Here you go. Hey. And I would love to have you on The Secret Joe, unless that podcast is really bad and you'll get me in trouble. So Secret show. Secret show. Thursday night, you just got booked on a real show.


Congratulations Cole Castle, Ladies and gentlemen. Alright, another bucket. Pool. Here we go. We're having fun. That was an interesting interview. Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Mike Cohen. Everybody. Mike Cohen. I, I think text messaging is ruining people's relationships. Would you agree? My best friend of over 20 years accidentally sent me a screenshot from PornHub. This was no ordinary porn people. This was B, B, C, big black cocks. I text him immediately.


I said, dude, what the fuck? He text me right back. He said, oops, sorry, wrong person. I said, dude, we've been best friends for 20 years. Who the fuck is the right person? I got another buddy of mine who accidentally sent his mom a dick pic. She texted him right back, said, it's nice to know that nothing has changed since you were a baby. My wife texted me a couple weeks ago, she says, Hey, what's for dinner? Me thinking it would be funny. I sent her a dick pic. It was not funny. She texted me back, she says, oh great. Leftovers me thinking I'd make it a little funnier. I said, well then bitch, send me a picture of your pussy. It didn't get any funnier.


She sent me back a picture of me. Guys, I'm Mike Cohen You guys been great. Thank you so much. Wow. Exactly a minute. Jokes throughout saved himself from asking a question from the opening position by by continuing the joke quickly. That was great. Thank you. Thank you. I think texting ruins relationships when you agree and then boom, you attack before anybody could huckle you, which was a lesson learned earlier in the show from somebody. You didn't leave enough space for people to actually answer your question. I Learned that lesson the hard way. That's right. So why does it seem like you just left your wife and kids in the car to do standup comedy today?


It's the vibe that I'm getting from you is literally like, you're in a hurry right now. She's gonna be mad at you. The kids are hungry. Are you're a Costco guy? I definitely left him at home, but home's in Atlanta, so. Okay. Have you been on this show before? No. No. No. Okay. Never. We met in Atlanta after your, your special taping. Okay. That makes sense. I met people. Yep. Yeah. No. All right. So Mike, how long have you been doing standup? Almost three years. Alright. And all of it's in Atlanta? Most Of it, yeah. I've done a little bit in Orlando and a couple other places, but nothing crazy. Don't get too many opportunities. So what do I do it as often as I can. What do you do for a living? I am a brand manager for an automotive paint company.


So Okay. I run a brand of products for automotive paint company. Automotive paint? Yep.


Earl Scheib? No, no, no, no. A distributor. We sell the the paint to the end users. The body shops Collision centers. Okay. Earl Scheib doesn't barely exist anymore. Well, I mean that's what you think, but, well, yeah, that's Red Band and I exclusively use Earl Scheib. We use the promo code KILL TONY and we save 20% on our autobody band You. know, this is a pretty chill episode of the show. I would say this is like a routine taping, but I will say this has gotta be one of our most profitable episodes that we have on. Without a doubt. I do believe that's our 10th ad read in the middle of the show. And we don't, we've never, never literally, we've never used Earl Scheib before. Yeah. They just owe us money. So Now I wouldn't think they're literally not a sponsor, but we will be sending them an invoice. Now's a chance they can jump on board. Hell Yeah.


Okay. So Mike, how old are you? 45. 45. What made you start standup at 42? Deep Depression. What made you depressed? So I, I was dealing with some health issues in my life. Obviously it was in the middle of the pandemic and I, I was seeing a doctor, she was helping me with some issues. And what Were the health issues? Let's talk about that. Well, number one, I was severely overweight. Not that I'm not overweight now, but it was even more so overweight then I was almost 400 pounds. Right. So I've absolutely dropped about 150 pounds. Thank You. That's great. Explain to Redband how you lost the weight. Do you like peanut colada Milk or you gotta do push aways. Push away from the table.


Okay, so keep going. Your health issues were that you were overweight? Yeah, I was overweight and I was dealing with some pain in my abdomen and they found that my, my liver was giving me some issues and they basically told me that I was in the beginning stages of liver failure. Were You drinking a Lot? No, not at all. Just from being super heavy non-alcoholic cirrhosis to the liver. Whoops. Whoops. But with, with with, with good exercise and a decent diet, you can reverse a lot of that stuff. And Whoopsies has been called on the field. Unbelievable. Amazing. So was there something that you were consuming that was affecting your liver?


That's so interesting to me that just normal fat guy, liver failure. You Know, once I started cutting out carbohydrates and, and just really focusing on a protein-based diet, like it really cleaned a ton of things up for me. Right. don don't wanna be cliche, but listening in a different podcast and crap like that. Right. Learning about carnivore and different things. Rogan that made it Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's Okay. We just throw it out there. It's okay. And then you saw Burt Chrysler do standup and you werere like, I can do that. Yeah, Absolutely. Definitely inspiring there, I guess. No. Yeah, no, it was always a, a dream of mine and, and I never really had the balls to pursue it. And when my doctor told me that You know my days were numbered, I was like, my wife looked at me and she supports this. She, she's a hundred percent behind me.


That's amazing. She's like, you got nothing to lose. If, if you're gonna go out, go out doing something you enjoy. So. Right. I went all in on it. My wife's amazing. Yep. Wow. For sure.

Financially? Yeah. You're paying for it. Yeah. College is expensive because They go to college and they all of a sudden have a new gender. So you have to get them close. No, thank God he does. He's not dealing with any of the gender issues. Give us a ballpark.


I'm curious, how much does college cost? So right now I think we're at about 30,000 a year. Jesus. Yeah. Christ. We're two years in and we got at least three more with him. And the minute he graduates, my daughter goes in. So it's a never ending. Why did you push college so much? I did not actually. I, I, trust me, I have zero education. Right. I'm basically a retard with an ability to paint cars. That's it. Right? No, I actually sat my son down and I said, look dude, if you're gonna go to college, you have to answer two questions. One is whatever I'm gonna pursue, is it gonna light my soul on fire every day? And two, is it gonna fix the world's problem of something? If you could answer those questions, go to school.


And, and that's what he, What were his answers? Well, I'm still working on that, but He, He chose to go into mechanical engineering and he's considering a minor in nuclear engineering as well. That's cool. Yeah, no, it's great. Wow. I, I'm blessed because both of my kids are absolutely fricking brilliant. And I look at my wife and go, where the fuck did they get it? Right.

And today was a fun day for me in the stock market. I lost $60,000 in the stock market today. So I really gotta be frugal now.


Oh, My, God. Little scary. I'm not kidding. He's gonna be sending, I'm probably not. It's gonna be sending you some invoices for those dinners it sounds like. I'm glad I got those in. Yeah. So You guys can't make it to Madison Square Garden. Huh? What's going on? What in the world could possibly be bigger than watching your son? One of the biggest stars in the history of the show perform at the most. I agree. Yeah. What's going on, Larry? I've gotta work for a living. You gotta work on Friday and Saturday nights this week. Ms. Montgomery, I'll be your date. Oh, Don't fucking get anywhere near my mom.


Red band. Seriously. Don't get anywhere fucking near you. Look as nasty as ever over there. You fucking God.

Ah, Absolutely incredible. Oh My God. They still got it. For those of you that haven't watched the episode, worthy Montgomerys of the guest, I implore you to go rewatch it.


I mean, You guys are just absolute natural. It was such a home felt a heartfelt, a home like episode. It just felt like a, a KILL TONY at like a Christmas dinner or something like that. And it was ama. What do you think about that episode, William? I loved it. Oh my gosh. It was one of my favorites. I was very nervous before my mom stopped eating for a couple days before that, and that had me nervous. She was so nervous to get on here, and she stopped eating for days before, and it was scary. Me picking that up. Huh? What did, what did you say, Francis? What did you say? Here we go. He's Making this stuff Up. Are you making stuff up about your mom? No.


She was like a week or something. You didn't eat before, Larry. Is your household just always silly and wild and filled with humor? We've met the great Seldon who's made a huge impact here in Austin, Texas. The boy is wild. He is a, an amped up version of William from back in his You know, kind of like, yeah. Oh yeah. But he also kind of like, it seems like he's learned lessons from Big Brother over here. Have you helped Selden in any way since he's moved here to Austin, Texas? Yeah. We go eat over at his house. We hang out a good amount, and I do want to say to any, if there's any parents out there or whatever, my, they were totally, they were the most strict with me and cut back to when I was in high school.


I was railing lines of Xanax. I was fucking drinking so much Evan Williams whiskey, and I wasn't allowed to spend the night out. And that was all on y'all. The other brothers were allowed to spend the night out. I wasn't allowed to spend the night out, so I'd have to rip lines of Xanax and drink fucking Evan Williams and fucking drive back. So Was there things that you learned that you changed after you raised William for the other kids? That's actually a good question. Well, first of all, everything he just said is bullshit. I remember that one night. Remember the one night, it was after a KILL TONY in LA and I was calling people.


It's when I was really lonely and I was calling people on the phone. I talked to people till 6:00 AM and I called that one guy and I told him I was in the underwater Cavern system. And then I get a phone call from one of y'all's cell phones, and it's the woman police officer on the other end. And I, it is True story. And Papa killed me. I remember you asking me if I was on mushrooms or something and I was just railing lines of cocaine at that moment. I was just doing, but it was sweet. You asked if I was on mushrooms, but no, I was not. Well, Francis Francis called me on the phone and said, the police are at our house. And it's something about William and I'm driving home from work thinking, oh shit, he's dead.


Where are we gonna park the U-Haul in la? That's The street. Parking was horrible where I was living in Hollywood. It really was. It was horrible. Street parking, Oh, My, God that I'm, I'm ashamed, but that was my first thought. Amazing. And then we got home and the police said, we, and this is true, we got a call from the LA Police and someone has reported that your son is trapped in a cave.


Wait, say that into the mic. What Francis? Here, here. This is what happened. Yeah. I, this is gonna take 40 minutes. It's good. It's good. It's good. Take your time. Right into the tip of the mic. I'm at my garden club thing And I was it a Madison Square Garden Gardens? I'm teaching people how to propagate paonia, Propagate Patagonia. My neighbors call me and say, there are all these police cars in front of your house. And like, I can't breathe. I leave my propagation workshop And I, I'm calling Larry on the phone saying, I, I literally couldn't breathe.


I'm hysterical. I said, I know he is dead. The, the, The police and, and all of my neighbors are gawking at us. And like, it was a nightmare. It was a total nightmare. And I round the corner and the policemen say to me, he is in this underground cave in Middle Tennessee. And I said, he is a freaking comedian. And I was relieved because I knew it was no longer true. It was all a lie. William, what made people think that you were in an underground? I Called this guy on my phone and it was somebody else. I still to this day do not know who the person was I talked to and I was just telling him that I was trapped in this underwater cavern system in an air bubble.


And the police get somebody in to help me. I'm running out of air. I'd get all coked up and call these people and like prank phone call everybody. Oh, it was fun. Yeah. This guy really believed me. I guess I was convincing and I was thinking, you idiot, how a cell phone work in a fucking underwater air bubble. You idiot. Why did you call the fucking police? You dumbass. It was Horrible. It really was horrible. Wow. You interrupted, you interrupted your mother propagating Patagonias pat. Oh, the teacher's awake again. Look at this bitch. You want some more you piece of shit.


You're a mom too. I bet you are. I bet your kids fucking hate You. Special needs Oh, My, God. You're actually offended. Look at you here. You're looking for something to get mad at. She doesn't have her. Period. You're just like this all the time. You teach first Period, second period. She says, wow. Incredible. God. And your husband's so embarrassed behind your fucking ass. He Is. So he really is embarrassed right now. Incredible. and you could tell he's a fan of the show. She's like, I'm gonna come to, I can laugh.


I have a good sense of humor. This guy just wanted to hang out with his homie. Right? That's your buddy with the sunglasses. Yep. Yeah. You guys are homies. The ladies wanted to come too. This one handles it very well. She's been having a blast. She's cracking up right now doing the, oh, don't point me out thing. Blocking off the energy of fucking gobbledy gook over here. This lady's been a real bitch. The whole episode. I'm just trying to catch up the Montgomerys to what's going on. Look at her. Well, I mean, what can I say that I haven't said a thousand times before? The Montgomerys are a part of the DNA, the legacy of the show.


The only parents to ever be guests on this show other than my own mother. Joy Hinchcliffe. You're the only other two. Your son's in the Hall of Fame of KILL TONY. He's a fucking theater act now. He's selling out everywhere he goes. He's adding shows, he's making vast sums of money and he's performing twice, two different sets of the most famous arenas in the world this weekend.
