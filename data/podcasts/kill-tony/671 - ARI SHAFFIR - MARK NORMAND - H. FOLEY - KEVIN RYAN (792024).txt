Not a lot of time to get me fired. So let's go. Since COVI work from home. Now that means I wear more, I more wear more clothes on PTO than anything. Right? So speaking of Covid, I love watching people who are on their fifth booster and I'm looking at them on their fifth fucking eyeball, just winking at me, right?


It's like, bro, what the fuck? Six feet please. Six feet. That's where that came from. Fauci. You stupid motherfucker. Anyways, so go relax, relax, relax. Next one. Relax. Let's come back down.

First time. Let's hear. Give it up. Give it up. Let's hear some more of these jokes. I wanna hear what you wrote. Your biggest laugh of your set was your new famous tagline. Relax, relax, Relax. Which you said to a room of 400 people that were making no noise whatsoever. And then you said quote, let's bring it down a bit.


Alright? Which again was just people reacting to your usage of relax when nobody was doing anything at all whatsoever. Could be the greatest branding tagline ever. 'cause I mean, you had nothing and you said relax and you got a big laugh. Whatever works. It wouldn't even have worked if they were laughing. You would've brought down your own laughter had they been laughing. Instead you took nothing and turned it into something by telling them. And that's how it's done. That's how it's done.

Actually I went to my cousin's basketball game this weekend. He's the athlete of the family. It's cool though. 'cause we got the same nicknames.


The Kills kids call him Curry 'cause he shoots like Steph. And the kids called me Curry 'cause they were racist. Yeah. If I missed a shot, they'd yell out. There goes another tower. Yeah. I was also in ninth grade when Harold and Kumar came out. And for the whole year everyone called me Kumar Kumar. And I couldn't even get mad about it 'cause that's my legal middle name. Even though I'm Indian, I actually grew up in Africa. But we ended up having to move because it was really unsafe and we kept getting robbed. And like most Indian immigrants, my parents first started working at a seven 11 and that was really unsafe.


They kept getting robbed. So that kind of confused me. 'cause if you think about it, we really just traded getting robbed by Africans, getting robbed by African-Americans. Kind of seems like a lateral move. Thank you everyone. Our pit Jane. Giant. Jane. Jane. Our pit. Yeah, our pit. So it's that's a, that's a bad name. It it was growing up. Yeah. It's a bad name.

He is the reckoning. He is the great, great destroyer of worlds. The leader of leaders, the big red machine, the vanilla gorilla, the Memphis Strangler. The Tijuana Tarantula. This is indeed Lights out William Montgomery. I actually did a rim to rim on red band's fucking mom a couple nights ago, and that shit's nasty.


The jury convicted Hunter Biden on three gun possession felonies. And in a twist of fate, one of the May witnesses against him was his dead brother's widow. He was fucking, but seriously, I don't think President Biden will be pardoning him since Joe forgot even had a son. One of Elon Musk's Neuralink employees is suing because they were forced to work with a herpes infected monkey. And I just want you to know, red band, you will be getting a call from my lawyer. Dude, they don't make porn dramas like they used to. You know those tear jerkers that turn you on, but make you so sad.


Friends become enemies. Enemies become enemies. The bad news is Mom divorced Dad. The worst news is she married Bill Goldberg. That's a scary wrestler. Okay, I thought Tony might like that one. Okay, that's my time Alrightyy. Thank you. Wow. I I was literally the only person in the room that worked at that. You heard Tony Was hilarious. Yeah. That one was for you. That true Bill Goldberg got me. Good. Amazing set. But that's true. Redband really took the grunt to this one tonight. Very fun. You are indeed the man. Are those new jeans, William?


Those look like, Yeah, I got new jeans. I had my wranglers for three years and finally got some new jeans a couple weeks ago. Yeah, Tony, I mean, things are kind of looking up. I also, my Game Boy emulator, I'm currently Tony playing three Pokemons at the same time. Right now I'm playing Pokemon Crystal, Pokemon Fire Red and Pokemon Emerald. And I'm at about 24 hours on all three of those games right now. So having a great time. Wow. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun. And thank the Lord, because it was a real hell of a weekend. I was supposed to be in Hartford, Connecticut this past weekend in fucking American Airlines. The flight gets fucking delayed 10 hours, so I missed that. So I spent a thousand dollars on a United flight for the next morning to do three shows, and I play my Pokemon games and I'm thinking it's hot as fuck in this airplane.


And we all had to get out and they had to fix the air conditioner. So I wasn't able to go and just played more Pokemon. So you Ever think you played too much Pokemon? Maybe you should consider like buckling down working harder. Yeah, no, I mean, right when I get off the stage tonight, I'm going back. I'm gonna play some more tonight. I'm not even kidding. Oh, is that funny? Did you see those funny? I want you look like somebody that'd be playing motherfucking Pokemon you bitch. Whoa. No, I'm kidding. I'm just, just, just so pissed about the Hartford thing. It really was a nightmare Tony, right? You didn't get to go to one of the worst cities on planet Earth. So explain to us, William, well, is there a reason why you didn't just take a flight to New York City and then drive an hour and 15 minutes to Hartford Connecticut?


I could. There I was looking for flights in the Hartford Tony. I wasn't gonna make it too difficult on myself. I mean, it was already difficult doing that. So what, and then in the future, I should look for a flight to New York City and then rent a car. Yes. Okay. Yeah. You should fly. Just learn something. Okay. Yeah, I did not do that. Yeah. This past time at all. You definitely didn't, it almost seems like you didn't really wanna go to Hartford. Oh, no Tony. No, I really did stop. I was really excited. What, What were you looking forward to doing? I actually have a baby mama in Hartford, so it's literally, yeah. Yeah. It's weird. I'm finally, after five and a half years, I'm finally spilling the beans on this one. You have this other family. I have this other life Tony in Hartford, Connecticut.


Tell us more. Where did you meet this young lady? Oh my gosh. Where did I not meet her? Tony. It was everywhere. It was love at first sight. It was Kroger's. It was Cecil's. That's another grocery store. It was. I was seeing her at all the grocery stores. We ended up falling in love. It was, You were just at Kroger buying some all brand buds and, Well, I haven't been eating 'em recently. Tony. I had a horrible blowout today. And I'm What, what was the blowout? What do you mean? I, I sit on the to, I don't eat, you don't even wanna be hearing about this, but I swear to, I'm sitting on the toilet. I do do some and then I put my Pokemon up and then I end up sitting back down and it was a diarrhea explosion and I've been eating a bunch of Papa John's recently.


So it's probably that. How much Papa John's have you been eating it? A whole pizza on Saturday with the garlic sauce. Nice. So yeah, I don't know. I was feeling delirious Tony. I slept four hours, no, like eight hours I think. Wow. You only got eight hours of sleep. It's Terrible. In two days, Tony. Oh, I was delirious. It was just all bad. I'm having a real hard go of it right now, so. Wow, You were so delirious. You barely got home and ordered and ate an entire pizza. I was starving. I was really hungry. No, I was really starving. But, so that's it.

Are you Oh My. God? Does the baby Mama does she like the Pokemon. She loves the Pokemon. Really, dude. Yeah. I mean sometimes I'm thinking maybe I'm gonna stop playing the Pokemon or something.
