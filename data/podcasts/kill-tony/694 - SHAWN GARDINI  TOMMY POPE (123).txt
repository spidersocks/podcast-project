We're gonna have fun tonight. 252 innocent souls signed up for tonight's show. They are stockpiled at a bar across the street, and if I pull their name out, one of our amazing producers goes and wrangles them from across the street. They come over and pace nervously right behind that curtain for a few minutes until it is their time to come up on stage. If, when it is their time, they get 60 seconds uninterrupted. You know, their time is up and you hear the sound of a kitten. That means they have to wrap it up then or else they bring out the Angry West Hollywood bear, Which interrupts them. And then I conduct an interview and me and my Esteem panel, find out more about them, make friends, make enemies.


Anything can happen. Could be the future of comedy. Pulled out of the bucket. Could be absolute mental illness at a thousand miles an hour. You guys have seen this show before anything can happen. And now it begins. And we start tonight's show while we go wrangle that first comedian with one of the greatest golden ticket winners in the history of the show. Truly.

You gotta love it. Heidi as lighters. The Heidi lighters are out. I don't know, where do people find them at? Heidi. You can find them at the Yellow Road Of Boston, Texas. Oh, they have to go to the actual yellow roses. Okay. Alright. I thought that maybe they'd be online, but you have to take your ass to a real legit strip club to get these lighters. Alright. You know her. You love her. It's been a long time since she's been on the show. This is a brand new minute from Isha Albo. Everybody. It's been a long time. She's back. Isha Albo. My name's Jamia.


I was adopted when I was six years old. I'm the only black person in my family. And when I tell people that they think my life is a lot like that movie. The Help. Yeah. Growing up my life was more like the movie Get Out, except with Mexicans, which was somehow worse. I, my mom is a combination of white and Mexicans. So when we're in public, I call her me Karen. Right? Like, she can eat tamales with the best of them, but like a white woman, she loves to say the N word. Yeah. Nordstrom. It's, but she is Mexican. So it's more like Nordstrom Rack.


That bitch loves a hard R. Okay. I got kinky parents. You guys have kinky parents. Don't answer that. That you see, here's the thing about kinky parents. You shouldn't know that they're kinky. When I was 18 years old, my mom came out to me as bisexual, followed by the phrase, I'm gonna be in a relationship with your father and his girlfriend. Yeah. My parents are Mexican and their third is white. So when they're all together, I call them trace Late Jace guys. Thank you. That's my time. Isha Albo has returned. Hi, Isha. Tony Hinchcliffe. Mr. Preston, How are you?


Thank you. Indeed. So you were adopted, is that what I'm gathering? I was adopted, right? Yeah. Okay. Only black person in my family. And so the end of that joke, so when I was 18, my mom came out to me as bi, and then she entered a relationship with my dad and the girl that he was cheating on her with. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds About right. Yeah. That's not even that crazy. I'm used to much crazier shit with comedians. That's actually a pretty balanced breakfast of a, pretty of a childhood. Wait until 18. Normally when parents say bye at 18, they mean goodbye. Goodbye. You're out. Oh My God. Don't come back. See you later. You had A little bit of infidelity.


Infidelity growing up. Right? More than infidelity. My entire thing. My mom and dad cheated on their significant others for 11 years. Secretly while raising families. They were fucking the shit out of each other. There we go. And then 11 years into it, my dad nutted inside of my mother and she got pregnant. My dad assumed that she would have an abortion, but she decided to have me. Yeah, There you go. Her dream love child. The youngest by 12 years. So being told that your mom's by at 18 to me is fucking boring. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Because I was fucked up. I did the math when I was a kid and called them out on it. Yeah. Anyway, it's a whole thing. There's many podcasts where I talk about it.


Thank you for sharing. But yeah, I'm a demon seed. I'm the bastard of Youngstown. Okay. Okay. Anyway, we knew. So it's interesting that you were adopted by Mexicans. How did this happen? Yeah, that is that, that sounds different. Yeah. So It's like Mexican and Italian, mostly Mexican. I have a lot of Mexicans that live in Fresno, California. But yeah, six years old. My mom just wanted a girl, so she got me. She wanted a girl. So like, that's the whole story. That's the only request. She is like, I just want a girl. And they gave her a black girl. She a black girl. Yeah. Damn. Yep. That's kind of like a fucking raw deal. It Was 2001. Damn.


Can I have a, can I have a, can I have a second draft pick here? The Mexicans are shaking their heads at me right now. Oh Gosh. I love it. So what was it like being raised in a Mexican household? Good. A lot of tamales. Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm recently sober and I, I used to smoke a lot of weed, so I've replaced rolling blunts with the, the rolling tamales. No, that's It. Yeah. Did you have brothers and sisters in the household? I Did. Yeah. So when I got adopted, my mom had a son from her first, we'll call it Encounter who lived in Fresno. And then when I got adopted, I had a brother who's my age, so I'm 30 now.


He's 30 as well. And then I have a little brother. The brother came outta your mother's vagina. Yeah. So Why did they go shopping for a kid when she could have made One? I don know she was also pregnant when she adopted me. So, I dunno, She's Mexican. She really just, Jon Deas senior black correspondent on the show as something to say. What were you gonna say, John? That's the wrong microphone. John, what did you say? Okie dokie. Real. Okay. Great stuff. De you get a little bit stronger every week at this show. No, I'm kidding. We love John. No. So she, yeah. So she was pregnant with my little brother when she had me. And then The band loves it when Des fucks up. They're having their own side tables right now.


Fucking love that shit. The band leader, Jon Deas. Okay. Yeah. So my mom was pregnant with my little brother when they adopted me. What would possibly make a woman try to get an extra child When she's pregnant? I asked her. Right. I was like, why did you decide to adopt me? And the only reason was 'cause she wanted a girl. So that was it. Jesus. That Was it. So she found out she wasn't having a girl. She found out the thing inside of her belly at a penis. It's a Boy. Yeah. And she's, I mean, does she even like the boy that's the same age as you? It seems like, oh Yeah. Hates me. Loves, Loves the book. Why does she hate you? I was a piece of shit growing up. Really? Yeah. I would lie. I would steal. I know I'm nice now, but I was a fucking terror win.


Wow. Yeah. So even if you're raised by a different race, you still steal and lie. Yes. We're learning it's nature, not nurture. We're figuring it out here tonight. Jesus. Not smiling at this at all. And this was, this was before mothers can make their boys girls if they wanted to. Yeah. You Yes. Yes. This was, this was Pret Trans. Yes. Pre, pre trans. My, my adoption, I've, I've been a little bit more into like the technical terms of my adoption. And it is, it's called a trans racial adoption when you're the only fucking different race in the hole.


Yeah. Trans TOMMY POPE. Who's calling it that? What's that? Who's calling it that? Who's What? Who's calling? Who's doing What? Who's calling it a transracial? I thought it was just an adoption. Yeah, Adoption of trans. Where'd you, where did you learn that term? The internet. Okay. Yeah. They'll just call anything trans nowadays. What did you steal when you were a kid? You said you Food. Surprisingly. What kind, What kind, what kind of food? Anything really. I was very, what do they call it? Like food insecure as a child. So my birth mother was a drug drug addict and a alcoholic. So I was just like on my Own.


How did you find that out? My mom, my current mom and my foster parents. So, So they told you, they're like, you're lucky. Yeah. You're with Us.

Your next bucket poll goes by the name of Cole Castle. Everybody. Cole Castle. I, I like that at the TV on during sex. But you gotta be careful what show is on while you're doing it. Because the only thing worse than finishing quick with a girl is finishing quick than hearing a laugh track immediately after. Now it just feels like a whole audience is degrading me. My go-to genre to have on during sex true crime. Because at least if I give her a bad performance, she can look at the TV and see some girl getting raped and murdered and I can go, Hey. Could be a lot worse for you. Huh? It's like, yeah, I didn't make you come, but you do get to go outside again, so count your blessings.


All right. I was drinking with some family a couple weeks ago. My cousin with Down Syndrome came up to me, he goes, Hey Cole, you should stop drinking. It's not good for you. And in my head I was like, I'm not gonna stop drinking tonight until I'm on your level a little zo. I also wanna be drooling on myself at some point. That's what I realized getting drunk is just microdosing down syndrome. There's a lot of similarities. You know, you're harder to understand, you eat more, you fall more and no one's gonna trust you behind the wheel. So a lot of similarities I think. I dunno, people start drinking and say, let's get fucked up. I say, let's get fucked downs. Alright, thank y'all. Cole Hassel.


Very good. Set. How's it going, Cole? Good. You've been on this show before? Yeah. Yeah. I was on a few months ago. Yeah. Yeah. That, did this go better than the last time you think? I think it went about the same. Okay. Yeah, we'll see. Alright. Things could change. Well no, it already happened. We did see. Yeah. Okay. Well the, You know, there's the interview, but yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah. You're in it it right now. Yeah. Yeah. Have you had a broken nose before? No. No. Just looks like that. Yeah. Damn, that Sucks. Appreciate that. Yeah, you're well. Yeah, you're right. The interview is a long, I'll try to face you. So you wouldn't like notice, but No. Yeah, that's Just seeing someone so far. You ever been hit by a car?


What's this about? You got an excuse for that fucking face. That's crazy. Cole, how long have you been with standup? Just that one year. One year? Yeah. What do you do for work Sales. What are you selling? I sell insurance to financial advisors. Wow. Yeah. That sounds terrible. It's not Mable. It's, I mean, I, I work from home. My like, You know, my coworkers are cool. That's really all I care about. Since When all these fucking things work from home. The pandemic? Yeah. Basically they just let everybody stay there. Yeah. I mean, after the pandemic it's like they can just hire, like, our office is in Florida, so it doesn't even matter. Like, I couldn't work. Another sad Fucking story.


Are your parents Mexican too? Can we fucking pick it up? Yeah. How old were you when you got your first S td? I was, I went to Texas Tech. So Raider rash was a real thing. Hell yeah. You got that little, It keeps going. You got that little red Raider in your pants, huh? Yeah. I thought it was a joke though. Dude, watch out for Raider rash. And I was like, yeah. All right. And then what does that mean? Raider rash? It's basically like chlamydia at Texas Tech. Yeah. Yeah. So you got chlamydia Cool. Yeah, they just said a Raider rash. It was S st d but then like, dude, everyone gets chlamydia there. Wow. I, dude, yeah, I was like, I was studying finance, which is like, kind of hard, but dude, I couldn't even pass a test at the clinic. Those were the hardest tests you make Me wanna shave my mustache, dude.


That's amazing. That is amazing. Cole, when's the last time you got an STD? I don't know. If you don't get tested, you don't have one. So It's been a, I don't, probably since college, I think. Yeah, I got tests like a year ago. I'm good to go. Okay. Alright. That's Good. A Year. You talked a lot about sex during your, during your act. Do you have a lot of it? Do you have a steady girlfriend or No? No, no, dude, I feel like I just like can always come up with bits for during sex. During sex? Yeah. Or like after I'm like, like if I, if I like can't write, if I have writer's block, I'm like, lemme just bang someone and then I could probably get a joke out there.


Have you ever, have you thought about doing other things in writing jokes about it? No. No? Just sex right now. Just sex. Amazing. Yeah. Riding that wave. Amazing. Do you have any special maneuvers in the bedroom that you use on the ladies? The old coal castle? The old sand castle? The old fucking, The old Coal Trickle?

It's Florida, Georgia here, you feel me? And then she was like, but you can't beat these views. And I wanted to be funny. So I was like, you can't beat the white bitches. And then I walked off and she was very confused. She was thoroughly confused. I also watched the Mike Tyson fight and I was terrible. But listen, my favorite part about the whole fight was before when they asked him how the fight was gonna go and he said this his victory and he turned around and his ass was out.


Right. And You know what's crazy to me? Anybody else in this room as a grown man, a rule, other grown men, you got your ass out. That's gay. Right. But for Mike Tyson, that might have been the straightest shit I've ever seen in my life. Dog. It was crazy. I'll tell you one thing. The cameraman right? The cameraman that when he turned around it was like a full view of the room. Right. And then he was wounded on his ass. Now that guy gay as fuck. No, that's, I been came back that guy so much. That is how you do it. What all? Fuck Yeah. That was fun man. This is good. I'm happy.

You did it from home or did you, you you would be, you worked a Kohl's call center? Yeah, after Covid we went home and I was smoking really heavy Back home. So you quit that job, did you save up some money? No, 'cause I did content or I do content. What Kind of content? Stoner content. Comedy content On what?

No. You live by yourself? I Live with my girlfriend. Okay. What does she do? She works in collections in a call center. Okay. She also works in a call center? Yeah. Is she a big stoner as well? Yes. Right. She's gonna hate that I said that but Yeah. Why? Yeah, 'cause well I mean it would be crazy if she was sober. Yeah, right. And fucking you covered in paraphernalia I would save so much weed. Yeah, it seems like it.


Is it true that you don't smoke blunts anymore or was that just all to be get to that racist joke? No, I actually really did stop smoking blunts back in February. And by racist joke, I mean joke about him being a racist. Not that it was a racist joke. There's no such thing as a racist joke. Just There's racial jokes. But by rule, if it's a joke it can't possibly be racist. Just a little something. Just A little something to remember. Unless it ends in the N word. Not me Anyway. De lust stoner. So I mean geez.


What would we be surprised to know about you? Is there any time you don't smoke weed when you, is there times where like you forgot to smoke weed? I don don't really smoke in the morning because I'll eat like a 500 milligram the night before. So I wake up still high. Is that true? Are you exaggerating? No. Yeah. For real. 500 milligram edible. You'll eat before bed? Yeah and I'll just like have fun With it. Do you just piss and shit all over yourself? Like what happens? No, I Can't even fucking imagine. What the fuck? It's a lot of fun. It's one of my favorite things to do when I'm not doing like content or comedy just to get really high like That. You say hunting, Comedy or content? Oh, comedy or content.


Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So a 500 milligram edible. So you that if you do that, you don't have to smoke in the morning 'cause you're still high from the night before. So when do you typically have your first smoke of the day? Right before I gotta go get my girlfriend lunch. You get your girlfriend lunch every day? Yeah, since I'm not working I just sleep in. Yeah. Wake up high and then I'm like cool, I'll take a shower still stone. And then whenever her lunchtime She shower. That's incredible. That's actually shocking. I'm a clean stoner sometimes. That is amazing. That is amazing. So again, is there, is there ever been a time where you didn't smoke weed? Yeah, before I was like 21.


What happens? What happens do you think? What would happen? Let's just say you didn't do an edible tonight. What would happen if you went tomorrow and just didn't smoke anything? What do you think you would think about? How do you think your day would be different? Oh, I would definitely think about weed for sure. If I wasn't gonna smoke, I wouldn't go nowhere because all my friends smoke weed and so I'm just like, well You know what? My girlfriend smokes too so I would just probably just chill in the car all day. You just go to your car and sit in it. Just Chill. Yeah. 'cause I'll be tempted to smoke. That would make you that Anybody would want to smoke weed if they're just sitting in a car, that's probably the worst thing you could do.


Yeah, That's right. I'd probably end up smoking. Yeah, that's true. There's nothing you could do to not smoke weed. Red band. How much a day do you spend on weed would you say? Well, since I do content, not as much anymore because they kind of just like give it to me. Have you ever taken just like two or three days off to reset so you can spend like five bucks a day? No, not at all. Okay. What Like I know so many people that smoke every day like, hey, I'm like go crazy all day. If you just take a couple days off, you reset your tolerance and then you could smoke one joint and be high as fuck. I like, I always wonder why people don't do that. Have you ever thought about doing that with food? God damn.


Let's check in with the picture of Brian Redban over there. Oh, your eye got bigger. Your right eye is now bigger. It's drooping, it's changing. This is gonna be the most famous piece of art in KILL TONY history by the way. I think he'll, well we're gonna do, let's do a live auction after this. Taking dick off for day Poof. No sound effect for you after that one. Dayla Stoner. I implore you. You gotta fucking, I wanna hear jokes about things other than just weed. Like it's cool and all but you, you gotta have some versatility, You know what I mean? Like you gotta have some range and stuff.


So definitely work on that. Thank you. Do not use this as rolling papers. Here's a little joke book. Make noise for Dela Stoner Ladies and gentlemen. Alright, this is it. This is the part of the show that, I mean this is it. This has been a full episode. We've done it, we've ran it. This is the part where I see the audience looking around tapping their loved ones, making eye contact because this is the only way to possibly end an episode like this. It is with the record holder for all time appearances, all time interviews on this show.


The man has done it all every single week, writing and performing a new minute for over long, over half a decade. You know his parents, You know his brothers, Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Virginia Ham, the Delaware donkey, the Memphis Strangler, the vanilla gorilla. This is the big red machine. William Montgomery. Ladies and gentlemen, I watched, I watched the Jake Paul, Mike Tyson fight this past weekend and say what you will about Jake Paul.


But the guy works hard. I mean seriously. He already has another Netflix event scheduled for May, but this time it's a one-on-one basketball. First of 20 wins 10 million and his opponent is not other than Kobe Bryant. This is my impression of an alien out in the shit. Fuck. Let me do that one more time. Let me start that one more time. This is my impression of an alien outing themselves as an alien doctor. I have a hair ache. Okay.


I heard You know, like a person would say headache maybe, but an alien wouldn't know exactly what to say. I heard, I heard Santa might come early this year. The bad news. Boeing built his sleigh. Okay, that's my time. Thank you. Fantastic. So silly. So William Montgomery, right down the barrel, Boeing might build a sleigh. Saint Nicholas. So Quick just, You know, you have grown into quite the specialist, topical, evergreen, these jokes, some of them will work forever.

That is the basic equivalent basically of six one hour specials.


I mean, if you count the interview, which usually runs probably about six to eight minutes. I mean, one could almost say that. That's fucking like basically what's Your take on that red band? Do You agree? 61 hour specials. What do you think? Red band? I think you write more comedy than any comedian in the world. Yeah. Yeah. I think, well, I'm trying, sometimes it's a disaster. I Don't know. Sometimes if you notice it's a Disaster up Here. But I don't know if you notice he said, I, he thinks you've read comedy more than anybody in the world. Meaning that you look off a note card. No, I I didn't say that. You didn't say red? No. Oh it Was good. Okay.

Well red band told me store, there Was a moment there where I'm like, I'm like, maybe I should pick up the whole tab for these guys. But they said that there was another couple there and I don't know if they're fucking haters or not. The other couple. And then I found out, yeah, it's two of my other best friends and I wish that I would've, but I didn't want any fuck. I don't know if You guys are hanging out with fucking tards over there, so I know You guys are a little bit. Tony, you gotta come with us next time.
