The best. This is MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. And that is Martin Phillips. You're watching these monsters in front of your berry eyes. Let's go back to the legends bucket. Huh. Ladies and gentlemen, Oh My God. This guy actually performed last night and he absolutely fucking destroyed. Truly one of my favorite comedians in the world for a very long time. An absolute New York icon, Ladies and gentlemen, make some fucking noise for Jim North.


Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. You having a good time? Thank you Tony, for having me back. I, it's been my dream to, to work MADISON SQUARE GARDEN for free twice. I am I was reading something really, really annoyed me today, so I'm gonna start with it. Nirvana has an album called Nevermind. I think it's their second record. On the cover of that record is a nude infant floating in a swimming pool, reaching for a dollar. That baby is now an adult. And he sued Nirvana because he said being on that record cover ruined his life.


And I'm obsessed with asking him, who recognizes you? How humiliating for an adult male to step out of the shower and have a woman go? Oh, My God, you have not changed. And according to his lawsuit, he sued, like for emotional distress. He said, Nirvana promised that when the record came out, they would put a black sticker across the penis to conceal it. And they neglected to do that. So I was talking to somebody and I said, I'm glad Nirvana didn't put a black sticker across the penis. And the guy I was talking to said, why?


And I had nothing. You ever take a stand for no reason whatsoever. I just like arguing. Now I'm dug into this position. I'm trying to have a fun back and forth. Now I'm aggressively advocating for more visible baby dicks. And I don't have children. I'm married. I only got married because my wife tricked me and she told me she was pregnant. Obviously I offered to treat her to a procedure. I'm like, come on, we'll get there early, we'll get ice cream, it'll be great. But she got very angry for me, suggesting an abortion.


She told me I had an abortion in college, which I did not know truly. I thought she dropped outta high school. So we get married three days after the ceremony. She goes, Hey, great news. I found out I'm not pregnant, which was fucking infuriating. I was more mad at myself for being so stupid, like, don don't know how I fell for it. Like, I know she can't get pregnant. She's transgender. don don't know how I fell for that. Like, How did I forget? She has a dick. That's what I loved about her to begin with. Now, my wife's penis, which I realize sounds like the title of a progressive children's book.


On the cover, there's a married couple. The woman has a little tent in her dress, and they're surrounded by a diverse group of accepting friends. It's a popup book. But look, that's what life is, right? Life is random. You don't plan who you're gonna marry the first you don't see somebody and realize that's the person I'm gonna fall in love with. That's the person I'm gonna live my life with. I didn't plan on marrying my wife, honestly. The first time I saw her, she was just effortlessly winning a swimming competition. And I realized how turned off I was by all those second and third place losers, All These women, oh, glug water, filling up their vaginas, slowing 'em down.


And there she is. Phew. Like a speedboat with an uncircumcised rudder just cutting down the left lane. And I'm like, who is that gal in first place by 18 laps? Who is that? Why is JK Rowing calling her a cunt? Thank You, guys, very much. Tony, thank you for having me Back. Come on, Ladies and gentlemen. Putting on a fucking clinic two nights in a row. How loud can this place get for the great Jim Norton? Oh, good Lord Almighty. Unbelievable. A bucket pool has to follow that live from MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.


Make some noise for Sid Clay Pool. Everybody. Sid Clay Pool is the fourth bucket pool here. NIGHT TWO KILL TONY MADISON SQUARE Garden. So my favorite part about driving on heroin is passing the drug, the breathalyzer. My least favorite part is walking the straight line. Can somebody explain Murphy's Law to me? Whatever can go wrong will go wrong. What about when shit goes right?


Sounds kind of pessimistic to me. 'cause when I was eight, my uncle tried to fuck me, but I got away. Sounds like some rules were broken. My best friend, he's a double amputee. His prosthetics, they cost an arm and a leg. Who's charging an arm and a leg? Jeffrey Dahmer. Hi. Okay, Sid Claypool. Welcome to the show. Sid. How long you been doing standup?


This is my first time ever on stage. Wow. Amazing. What made you choose tonight for a chance to start? Don Don't know. I, I, the reason I even wanted to do comedy was 'cause of the show, and I love it. How old are you? I'm 29. 29. Do you really do heroin? I, I used to. Okay. How'd you get off? What made how'd you quit? Well, one day, the last thing I got into a lot of car accidents when I was on heroin. Yeah. The funny part is, it was never when I was on heroin. It was I was on Xanax or withdrawing.


Totally. Wait a minute, you, you're a he Heroin addict and you had a car. I don't believe that. Yeah, it's, if I had a, if I, that's The first thing that goes with heroin. The car. This was, this was when the economy was booming. Even the heroin guys, even the heroin guys had cars and they were driving and we liked to have them drive. They fell asleep. They fell asleep at red lights. And we got to wake them up. We'd say, what are you doing here? I'll tell you what, we're gonna make heroin more affordable for you so you can get off your bird scooter You know, you kinda look like Johnny Menzel. Maybe Johnny can't sell a punchline though. More like a somebody, somebody Actually said that earlier.


The, the funniest part about when I got on heroin was it was like three months right before Covid. I just decided, fuck it, I should start doing heroin. And then, then I got on it for a while. What's the best part about heroin? I, well, I can't tell you the best, but the worst part about heroin is you can never do it again. What do you mean? Like, I am not, I can never do it again. It's the best thing I've ever had in my life. Right. Have you ever, Have you ever had a Capri Sun? No, but I've had Sonny DI think that's way better. My Man. Wow. Look at you. So you really have a friend that's a double amputee? Or was that just for joke? No, That was, that was me at, I made the Jeffrey Dahmer joke, but originally I was, I was trying to think of a arm and a leg joke.


Gotcha. And I was coming up with a joke with somebody that's a w amputee and I couldn't come up with it. I thought of Jeffrey Dahmer, and then I just added the, That would've been a bummer if he was here tonight and he couldn't clap for you. What do you do for a living? I rather I'll talk about anything but that I got a, I got a lot of stories, but not my job. I don don't, that's why I have a fake name tonight, honestly. Oh, nice. All right. Whoa. Mysterious. Ah, well, Hey, I actually, I have a story about last night. I was here last night in the comedic section. I didn't buy a ticket. I, I got outta here. I was pretty fucked up.


I was hanging out with a bunch of people. I was drunk as hell. I ran into some homeless woman. She was offering Xanax. Gave her 20 bucks, got two Xanax. I got pretty fucked up. And then on my way home, I, I don't know what happened. I, I think I was checking this guy's girl out. He started arguing with me. I started arguing back. We got into a fight. I threw him on the floor. I punched him in the face, and then his girlfriend started choking me out. Okay. Where's the good part of this story, bud? Well, She bit Me. Oh, Yeah. And then I spent last night in a precinct after the show last night. Wow. Awesome. Dude. All the fun of, all the trouble of still doing heroin without any of the fun.


Wow. Does this sound like somebody You know this sounds like Little Hunter. Little Hunter Biden. He's back and he is getting bitten by whos in the night? Hey, hey. He paid her 50 bucks on PayPal to bite him. He took care. Yeah, I bet Melania would bite you all, all the, I bet you'd love to get. I love you. I bet you'd love it. Sid Clay Pool.

A lot of people ask me if I'm gay. That's not the fucking punchline. No. I meet a lot of you. I meet a lot of you. I met some of you tonight. You'd be surprised how many times when I meet someone, when they ask me if I'm gay, I'm not. But I get it. No, I get I I get it. I mean, I see what you see. You know mirrors exist. Like I'm never like, why do people think I'm gay? I'm always like, interesting. Let's chat about it over brunch. Now. I really don't know why. I really don't know why. Maybe 'cause I'm into fashion. Like, no, I'm really, I am. I'm really into men's fashion. That's why like if I saw a guy walking down the street in like a beautiful Taylor suit, I'd have no issue being like, should I suck that guy's dick?


Those are some smart slacks. Should me and this man share a life together? Let me lighten the mood, the death penalty, the way I see it. I do have some thoughts on the death penalty. People don't expect that from me. They're not controversial though. It's not like, do we have the right to take a life? Do we have the right to play God? It's more about the last meal. We'd agree that this is a murder. A murder is about to happen. Why are we catering it? Why does food even come into play in this scenario at all?


It's not even the fact that they get the meal. It's the fact that we give them anything they want. That's insane. Anything they want, it sounds like we feel guilty. Like, look, we're about to put you down in front of these few folks for what you did. But we're great people. So if you fancy a bite, 10 na give a holler. Anything they want is crazy to me. There were nights when I was younger at the dinner table. My mom was like, you're gonna act like that. Go upstairs. That's it. I didn't get dinner for light. Horseplay.

Give a thumbs up to a French lady at an intersection.


Biggest surprise. 8% African American. 8%. That's significant. 8% to live 40 plus years and not know that that was a shocker. And before you get ahead of me, I'm not gonna make some, I didn't hear what he said. Well, all right. All right here. Look, before you even get ahead of me. No, I'm not gonna do that. Okay? I'm not gonna make some hack joke about what African American trait I inherited with the 8%. That's low hanging fruit. You guys are comedy fans. You didn't come in for that. I didn't come in for that. I'm not gonna make that hack joke. I don't care what you say.

Everybody make believe I'm Billy Joel. And sing along. Billy Joel could kill somebody on Fifth Avenue and you'd still buy Billy Joel tickets. You know how many ushers have quit because of Billy Joel being here for fucking 10 years.


Police officers are retiring 'cause they don't wanna work the fucking show. There was a guy who was an usher. He went home and he heard a Billy Joe song on the radio and he drove his fucking car off the bridge. How much do you like Billy Joe Fag? You don't even jack off when you sweat. Do we really need women's basketball? Some flat ass skinny fucking bitch throwing a fucking basketball.


We got men's basketball. It's like buying an air fresh in a for a convertible. What do you do after you see a women's basketball game? Go in the parking lot and kill yourself. Women's basketball. Gimme a break. What'd you learn how to cook first? Bitch, why do you wanna do men's shit? Why do you wanna do men's shit?

We can call it the WUSA.


You can do all the layups you want over there. We're there. We're fighting for oil here. I think a president should be able to stand up when he pees. I don't even know how women pee. I think they just soak their flaps and wait for it to drip down. But don don't get to see a lot of pussies. It's pretty tough for me sometimes. I wish I could take a time machine back to my Asian ancestors before they left Africa and be like, stop moving right now.
