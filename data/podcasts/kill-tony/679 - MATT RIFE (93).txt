They're all piled in across the street at a bar called Poor Choices. If I pull one of the names outta the bucket, they get 60 seconds uninterrupted You know their time is up and you hear the sound of a kitten. That means they have to wrap it up then. Or I'll say, bring out the Angry West Hollywood bear, which interrupts them. I conduct an interview, we meet them all together, and the whole thing's improvised. Anything can happen. Are You guys ready to start tonight's show? Let's start it with one of our esteemed regulars, Ladies and gentlemen. This guy, an absolute legend of KILL TONY.

I think we just wanna hear the air moving around their tits Personally. God, I fucking hate women. What? They're racist to Asian guys. Women want a strong, confident American man that's gonna attack Iraq twice for no reason.

Matt thinks this is how big my cock is. That's the whole thing. Yeah. No, it's the actual size of a Lego man's hands. It's that big is what he's saying. What have you been doing to please yourself during this time? We know you are a sex addicted masturbating machine. What's been going on with ya, Hans? What have those, have you been keeping your Hans to yourself? Yeah, my Hans has been on my Hans. The Fuck does that mean? My Hans has been on my Hans just workshopping. But Have you been watching porn or something? A lot of porn.


What kind of porn have you been in? Anything wildly. Lee, what's new for Hans? I love Japanese massage porn. Whoa. They they trick a bitch. How does that work? Exactly? What is Japanese massage porn? Usually the husband is within earshot and Like physically. Yeah. An earshot. Yeah. Right. And then they just start touching her and then it just goes crazy. So he just watches this go down Sometimes. Yeah. It's like a, A photo shoot. Like this is a fashion shoot and then they like he's, she's fucking another dude. So he cos it the entire time. Yeah. I've never understood the cook situation.


Me Leave. Yeah. Get outta there. Yeah. She's not into you dude. Right? She's not the one. What Do you, what is it for you, Hans, that turns you on? Having, watching a man, watching a girl having sex with another man. I just love seeing like a normal person then have sex. 'cause I don't know how to do that. So it's, I just wanna learn how to get from normal to sex. From normal to sex. Sorry guys. That's a real live apology from Hans Kim. You don't get that very often. And The Asian massage porn, do they do the full massage of like, do you have to watch an hour Until They start?


No, I fast forward and Okay. Alright. He's a Good man. They're usually quick to the point. Yeah. It's Also mad if they ruin my massage. It's also Pixelated though. You can't even see anything in Japanese. Is that true? Are you watching pixelated Japanese porn? Yeah. Yeah. Now what is it about that? Why are you watching the Japanese version of this when you could possibly be watching just American cock porn? Yeah, Because Japanese are like seducing and tricking and all that and Americans are just like, just doing it. Just like it's kind of boring. I like, I like the process. I Everyone hates me.


Absolutely incredible. Hans. Amazing stuff. It's kind Of sad. It's I know. It's fun. He's that guy. He is that guy. He I's gonna hang himself with a green belt. Karate. Karate belt. That is a karate joke. No doubt about it. Woman president. This is all true. Have you heard this week that she's drunk all the time? This is a new thing that I've Ooh, Sense I don Makes sense. If it's just coming up on my Twitter feed. She's Like wine mom drunk. Yeah, a soccer mom. Yeah. And it kind of makes sense. It seems like that could possibly be true. It explains a lot. Have you heard this theory? No. This is the first time. Thank you. Yeah. There's leaks coming outta her camp that she's drunk all the time.


Which would now, when from now on when you see her and all the videos of her speaking makes perfect sense. Breaking news. The person who's in second place on all the polls to be president seems to be drunk all the time. But You know. I mean it's up for us to decide when you hit the polls in November. Who you want You. know what I mean? No big deal. It's all your choice. Hans. Hans, are you gonna vote? Can can you vote? Yeah, I can vote. Not near a school, but I can vote.

Because I'm not because somebody backstage, he called me welding the great AKA D's nuts guy.


Ha got him You know. And that made it worse. 'cause yesterday, this dude, he got mad because I didn't give him a dollar. So he called me a great value day Chappelle. I was like, I'm proud nigga. I'm about, and that's crazy 'cause Dave Chappelle heard that. He'll probably be like, that's like something Ike would say, but that's Austin for you man. Like they say, keep Austin weird. I say, keep it the fuck away from me. This dude, he asked me can he borrow my lighter. So I give him the lighter. This motherfucker start burning himself with it. I get further down the street. This dude, he got his shirt off. He got garbage bags around his hand.


He beating the fuck out this tree. And I just wanted to know like what was the root of the problem. I'm pretty sure everybody heard the news about Donald Trump getting shot and it wasn't news to me because in my neighborhood everybody gets shot. My dad got shot and nobody cared. Not even me.

Red band loves cooks. Here we go.


Brian Cook. Thank you very much. Now I am a music fan to the point where I take it personally. Sometimes I was listening to the classic album on Paul's boutique by the Beastie Boys, but I was listening on YouTube. And YouTube has the comments down at the bottom. And can you believe what this Chucklehead said? And I quote this album Is three retards spouting gibberish over an awkward drumbeat? Not exactly. Officially, for the record, I love the Beastie Boys. I'm a big fan. But if we're taking the macro view, if we're looking at things in the big picture, isn't all hip HOPENY three retards, spouting gibberish over an awkward drumbeat? That's what every rap album ever is.


And if you think I'm picking on hip HOPENY, I am not. It's the same way that every death metal band that's ever existed is five retards making the most unpleasant noises humanly possible. It's the same way that standup comedy is one retard trying to be clever. You see, there's a pattern of behavior here. Now. I believe in diversity. I support diversity. Diversity is a stripper. I met over at the yellow Rose. She's a lot of fun. She's working tonight. So everyone please go support diversity. Thank you. Okay, Brian Cook, calling everybody, every artist to retard as fast as he Can. All of us, we're all in this together. I love it. You've been on this show before, correct?

This is William Montgomery. A school lunchroom lady was recently arrested for stealing one and a half million dollars worth of chicken wings. Apparently she was good friends with David Lucas. But I just think, but I just think her name should have been a big red flag for the school. Kenisha Popeye heirs to the Popeye's fortune last week in Uganda. A mountain of garbage collapsed and killed.


23 people. Which is pretty disappointing because I had visit Uganda as the 957th item on my bucket list. I'm never gonna Uganda. Why did red band buy 101 Dalmatians from Cruella Deville? Because he heard there were some hot dogs for sale. You fat dumbass. You love hot dogs And those are a hot dog is a stolen dog. Okay.

Interesting. Guess what happened on Friday? Gay? No, he's not gay. Oh, He's gonna turn on you real quick. Don't do that. I was, I Was just asking. Wait, what the fuck Did you want to say? Bad head? Right? Okay, so he's, you think I got bad head? No, but oh my gosh. I went to Perry's Steakhouse. They have a wonderful deal on pork chops on Friday. And I go there. Yeah. Shout out to Barry's wonderful deal on the pork chops on Friday. And I have to go Titi, real bad Tony. And I go to the bathroom and there's this scary looking big homeless man just wandering around in there. And I have to pee so bad. So I go to one of the two urinals and there's shit in one of the urinals in two paper towels.


And he's trying to rip down the door to the freaking stall. And then I go out and I tell everybody, there's shit in the, in the urinal. Everybody that works here. Nice to see you, man. Yeah, nice to see you. Nice to see you. This is William Montgomery indeed. In the, God, I mess that up. I mess that story up in front of you, man. I, there's no way I would've known You know. It was great. William has the record for all time appearances on this show. Interviews on this show. Everything for real. The first member of the, the first living member of The KILL TONY Hall of Fame.


Well, no, that's not true. Michael was alive when he got it. Yeah. And any of these keyboard warriors who think this fucking shit is easy. This shit is not fucking Easy. And either your new idiots, they think you can do it. Do you like to critique me? Any of you who think you could do this? Never. Never. You have no idea what it takes. Do You know how long it took me to write the 101 Dal Masons? Joe took me five fucking hours Yesterday, dude. Anyway, what I was saying was that he has the record for all time appearances, interviews, everybody.


He's been on almost every single show for over five years. Is that right? How It been? Because there's this one piece of shit. I don. I don't look at the fucking You go ahead. Go ahead. Let it out. Let it out. Let it out. Do You know the words that chocolate rain? No, but what were you saying Tony? I just, I was gonna say all time record holder for appearances on the show. And don, don't think I've ever seen you quite as shy in front of anyone as MATT here. Super shy right now. Again, we have never met man. He just winked at me. Tony. Whoa. William's famous for winking. Really? When he does it.


You Didn't know that. I didn't know When he does it, a special noise happens and everything. A little sparkle noise. Watch, watch, watch. There. It's Okay. Okay. Red band. I can't do it that fast. Dumbass. You can't even, and it's weird when Redband gets wasted, he loves to get just blackout drunk. And it looks like he doesn't blink at all. Which is so funny. His eyes never fully shut. He has a gluten allergy, William. And he loves gluten. So he, he's constantly in an allergic state. He'll be staring you down. Look at this.


Wow. This is a male. William is completely disinterested in this. William, where, where are you from? I'm from Memphis, Tennessee. I fucking love Memphis. Good barbecue. Yeah. Really good barbecue. Good Barbecue. Yeah. My gosh. Have you been to the hotel? What? The Peabody or No, not the Peabody. The The one. The one in the pyramid? No, no, not that one. Hold on. What's another one in Memphis? Probably the Lorraine Motel. I. don know. If that's I don know what the name of it is. The one it would've, it would've come up on Black Timber Where Martin Luther King, I Think got shot. Yes. I had been there. Really good barbecue. Right next door.


Wait, wait a second. Hold on. Hold on. First the bean, then Chocolate Rain. You're telling me Martin Luther King got shot. I knew it. I fucking knew what it was gonna do. So stupid. Alright. All right. All right. I was a joke. Alright, so William, something interesting happened on my way back from New York City, I was, I was lucky enough to be able to hitch a ride on a friend's jet. And the jet had an engine problem and had to make an emergency landing in of all places, Memphis, Tennessee.


And immediately we find out that, oh shit, they don't have the part for the jet and we're gonna have to take a commercial flight. And the next one's not available for three or four hours. So we get a commercial flight and then we have three or four hours in Memphis, Tennessee. So guess who I called and messaged My papa And my mama. That's right. Pop. It didn't respond right away. So I immediately hit up Mama and they started giving me restaurant recommendations and hotel recommendations. But that was before I realized we could get a commercial flight out of there. 'cause I thought I might have to stay in Memphis. So there I am, communicating with your lovely parents who I'm very close with. And it turns out I didn't have enough time to go to the restaurant that they recommended.


So I looked up restaurants that were close to the airport, right down the street on Elvis Presley Boulevard where the airport is. And it turns out it was an Elvis themed restaurant. And we only had about an hour and a half, two hours to eat food. And of all the days that I could have had an emergency landing in Memphis, Tennessee, I swear to God it was indeed. Of course. Elvis Presley day. Yeah. And so there we are thinking, okay, we're just gonna go get some quick Memphis barbecue real quick at this fucking Elvis joint. And there's a weight. Everybody's dressed like Elvis.


The place is fucking insane. And so I spent some time in Memphis. I love it. Well, you should have gone to Mama and Papa's house. I wanted to, I know you should have gone over there. I was really close to making that move. But I tried to make it back to make a two Monday night raw, which I also wasn't able to do that. Shout out to Sammy Zane. Pat McAfee. Well, Tony, I'm glad the plane didn't crash or something. We wouldn't even be here today. Could you imagine that? That is just nobody, there wouldn't be a line outside. Nothing. Yikes. It did crash. You have to be careful. Tony. That is true. I've always told you about the private jets. You know that. Okay. You know I have Tony. I don't take private jets, William, I don't take private jets.


It was a special instance. Okay. Be careful. I fly commercial with the people. I'm a man of the people. I take Southwest flights position group B. 'cause I like to be mixed in with normal humans. I like to be able to write material and connect with the people, but I take jets any chance I get. It's truly a superior way of travel and once you start, there's really no going back. It's after you take a jet. Once you're just furiously angry on flights. Even if you're in first class, it's disgusting. It's alright. I'm kidding.


So William, anything else crazy happening this week? Just Remnant too. It's some video game Tony. I think I've put in 40 hours the past four days. That's 10 hour days on the math on that, but yeah, it's remnant too. It's a third person shooter. You can upgrade your character, you can upgrade everything about it, but I cannot get enough of that. I'm about to go back and play until probably 5:00 AM tonight. I have to be careful, Matt. I've been playing it all night long. Poor guy. I know don don't know how to stop. Wow. I don't know how to talk to you. Everything you say is a mystery, dude.


Well, nice to be here, Tony. Thank you, William. We love you. He ain't ever gonna stop. There goes William, Montgomery, Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps one of the greatest hot dog jokes I've ever seen in my life. The drawing from Ryan JE Belt is in Make some noise for fucking MATT RIFE.
