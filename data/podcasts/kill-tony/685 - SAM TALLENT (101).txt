Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see tonight, anything can happen. Make some noise for your next comedian. Eddie. Larissa. Eddie Larissa is next on KILL TONY. I dated this girl who didn't believe in dinosaurs once. 'cause they're not in the Bible, but neither is Planet Mercury. And it was still the reason she was acting like a bitch all the time, apparently. And I grew up a Christian, I'm not a Christian anymore, but this was my first time being exposed to one of these religiously special needs types.


I didn't realize Christianity was a part of the spectrum. I thought I was an atheist. Now, turns out I'm just not retarded. And no shouldn't call Christian people retarded because retarded people love dinosaurs. Dude, I got two buddies with autism to identify as triceratops right now. And the point of this is if you're dating one of these religiously handicapped people, they're probably not gonna let you fuck them if you have a dinosaur kink while you watch Jurassic Park.


But she did restore my faith in one aspect. What was it? What? Didn't she restore your faith? I do believe in the burning bush again. 'cause that bitch gave me chlamydia dog. Oh shit. Alright. Thank you Eddie. Larissa. And we're back people. Yeah. Just like that. Yes. Is amazing. So welcome Eddie. Thank you. This is your first time on the show. Second time I got pulled in a turbo round one time. Okay. So it was quick. That was that crazy episode where we found Aaron Beil at the end, or No, it was the last pop-up episode before, I think it was before you went to LA Yeah. For the forum With the, with the regulars.


Yeah. Yeah. It was regulars episode. Perfect. How did that go? Was that good too? Yeah, it was fun. Awesome. Awesome. So welcome back. Tell us more about you that we didn't learn the last time you were on the show The last time we talked about me growing up in a group home for a minute. My mom is a professional jazz and blues singer. Oh yeah. I've been out here for almost a year. A year and two weeks. It'll, it'll be a year in two weeks. Yeah. So it's been a year. It's been a year. It's been a year. It'll Be a year in three weeks, a week after that. It'll be, I, I love it out here. This is Austin's great. What do you love about Austin? I mean, I love the comedy scene for sure. I don't do a whole lot else anymore with my time right now.


I people, I work in a bar down the street and they always ask me what there is to do. I'm like, huh. I can tell you where all the clubs are. Right. I, I don't don I don't drink anymore. I've been sober for a year and a half now. You have sober face. Yeah. That suck. You look like, you look like you're fucking clinging to the trees before fire in your mind. Like anything could send you back into that. Well, whiskey man. No, no Tequila d Well tequila. Okay. Mine was funny, but we could Do you climb rocks? No. No. I used to. I mean, I used to do, I've moved all over the country. I used to snowboard and I've lived in Keystone, Colorado for a couple years.


Oh yes. I was in California for a year. Florida and North Carolina. I moved here from Florida. You were trying to run away from that group home, huh? Normally I would just burn my life down and be like, all right, we're done here now we'll go somewhere else. Yeah. Okay. What do you do for work? Oh yeah. You were at a bar down the street. Yeah, I work at a bar Street. You see a lot of Stuff There. More crazy stuff when I'm just out here. Did You say on Rainy Street? Yeah, rainy Street. What's your thoughts about the Rainy Street Ripper? I don't know if I believe in him, to be honest. So you're with the police on this one? No, I'm just, you think it's just a wild array of accidents? Yeah. Maybe some suicides. I'm not really don. Don't know. He is been doing it a long time.


I feel like it's, How would You know that Out? I'm on rainy street a lot. Huh. And you're just a drifter who wandered into the town and then murder started happening. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, there's a lot of gay guys here. Lemme take care of that. Yeah. You don't need booze when you have blood. Yeah. That's, I, there was a serial killer in San Diego that killed homeless people when I lived out there. That was something I thought could be brought here. Pretty success. True hero. What a Coincidence. Smile. That makes it better. Yes.


Okay. How do you, yeah. So what else should we know about you? There must be something else interesting that we didn't find out last time you were on the show. I mean, I was a vicious drug addict. An alcoholic for 16 years. That vicious. Vicious. I don't, I, once I get drunk, I don't care what the drug is. Just set it down and let me have it. He said he lived in Key Bump Colorado for a while. Oh yeah. It was, it was key bumps too. I got, I got sick one time from doing cocaine in Colorado. What kind of sick? Like a real chest thing. I couldn't move for days. My dad was like, it'll be fine. I was like, okay, I think I'm dying right now. But otherwise The only cure is murdering a homosexual. Yeah.


Yeah. That's why, that's why I had to come here. I had to get over it. So a lot of guys, when they get sober from that type of wildlife, their addiction turns into something else. Are you a, like a sex addict or something like that? No, I actually haven't. This is the longest dry spell ever. I haven't had sex or been on a date in a year now over. You ever hung out with A, you ever hung out with a sand pussy, dental hygienist before? That sounds like a slur. These fucking sand pussies out there. I was in Afghanistan, killed about 35 sand pussies.


I just have, I have horrible taste in women. So I think part of me is like, maybe I'll just leave them like the, it's a fun story. My last serious girlfriend broke my face in six places with her new boyfriend. Wow. And stalked me for two years afterwards. Her boyfriend was the one who stalked me the most. I never really understood that. Didn't make much sense. So That is a fun story. Yeah. Yeah. So how did that happen? Did that he jump you and, and why did you say that she broke your face in six places? Well, 'cause it was, her foot was the last one I saw hit my head shit. Yeah. She was, she, she was like, you can't tell people that we jumped you. It was only four of us. I was like, I think that's, is it five for her jumping?


Like, I don't know. It felt like I saw eight feet. I saw eight feet. Wow. But yeah, she, she was a drug addict, a a former drug addict. And then we were together for a year. She started dating this other guy who after we broke up, who was feeding her drugs and me and him just didn't see eye to eye. And one night he Quite the crew of people That we Get up Here. Yeah. And then I was staying away from him. They got me fired from my job and then I got drunk enough to be mad and I met, went and met him in a dark parking lot at like two in the morning. It was a horrible idea. Dark, like Quincy dark or I wish I had a Quincy cam so that You guys could see the looks I'm getting over here on that one.


He was looking at the comedian and then looked at me like, it's unbelievable. I love it. Why'd you meet him in a dark parking lot? It was, it was like three in the morning. There were no streetlights. I just remember seeing four people get outta the car and I was like, oh no. I've made a terrible mistake. Yeah. That's how deep Madness feels all the time. the world is a dark, the world is a dark part. Darren Down. Down. Alright, So then you saw these people get out with your drugged up ex and you're like, let's hear 'em out. I mean, I was like, well, there's no turning back now.


And yeah, then they, he hit me good. I'll give it to the, he hit me good. And then as soon as I could Get up, I ran away. Would Would you say he hit you with his best shot? His best? He hit your amazing face. Yeah. If I, if I touch right here, I can still feel it in my tooth damaged. Was it a broken orbital bone Damage? It was like multiple face fractures here and here. My nose was turned this way. Deviated. Oh, I kind of see it now that you me that it fuck your eye up a little. I see. I I didn't think so. But Red band, Red Band, New insecurity activated.


You're used to men kicking you while you're down. Yeah. Yeah. You know I used to get, I used to get drunk and just I'd black out when I was living in Colorado, I'd black out and I'd wake up with new bruises and I'd have to hit up my friends and be like, did I get in a fight last night? They'd be like, oh yeah, you got your ass kicked again. I was like, all right, cool. Amazing. You got a big joke book last time you were the show. I did. Great. Then this is for Quincy There. you go there he goes, Eddie, Larissa Ladies and gentlemen, there he goes. And it's that time, I mean you were here for an absolute bonkers episode of KILL TONY. And on a night like this on an episode like this, I think there's only one way to put a ribbon on it.


Oh really? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the reigning record holder. All time appearances, all time interviews. The baron of bandaids. The saltan of salt, the ginger of geometry, the connoisseur of Caros of carnivores. The king of Kentucky, the strangler of Memphis. This is the vanilla gorilla, the big red machine. William Montgomery.


Man, y'all know I love geometry. Okay. Donald Trump claims that Haitian immigrants are devouring people's pets. And honestly I feel like he got the wrong immigrants. I mean, I mean if we got Hans Kim, if we asked Hans Kim, if he knew anybody Fe's gone domesticated animals, he would know. Okay, I kinda messed that one up. Please help me Sam. But seriously, if a Haitian immigrant wants to sacrifice a small animal, that's their religious freedom. Nobody is stopping you from murdering your unborn child red band. But I do feel like we should step up border security and mandate that any Haitian immigrant attempting to cross into the US should be forced to practice voodoo.


Because if they show up and they're saying, oh Catholicism, hell no. What are you bringing to the table? You better be mixing up potions, stirring up bodies, directing zombies. That'd be like joining the CIA And then first day on the job, you're like, first of all, I refuse to actively participate in any conspiracy to assassinate the president. It's like, dog, what are you doing? Do You know what the job is? Okay. I got through it all kind of Tony. It was beautiful. William. Ah, I got the red band. I got the dig on red band recently having an abortion. I was able to get that in there. Ooh, this is breaking. Is that why you shaved?


Is that like you, why you look like kind of a baby right now? Because you killed the baby inside of your woman? I love to think, I love that you think that a 50-year-old guy could have babies like drinking and smoking and doing everything I do right now. That's nice of you. That's a compliment. Oh yeah. I forgot the men carry the babies. I forgot about that fucking idiot. What the hell are you talking about? That literally made no sense. Dumb ass. I didn't even want to talk to your fucking ass tonight. What do you think? I think men carry the children. Is that what you are? Insing Red. You were having literally the best episode of your Hy HOPENY until that point. Literally Red band was the breakout star of this episode.


Yes. And then he claimed that he can't have babies like he is a dental hygienist. The old sand pussy over here. Oh, My goodness. What a time to be alive. And Sam, I have a question for you.
