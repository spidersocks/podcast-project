How crazy was that? Watching Trump almost get killed. That was so insane. But I was distracted watching it by how stupid the Secret Service girls looked. I watched it and thought they are so worthless. They're doing nothing. And then I thought if only Trump would just grab him by the pussy and then hold them up and use them as human shields. They could have looked so cool. They could have shown us their girl power. But don't think that the government is feeling bad and is gonna back down on going after Trump.


And and the people who support him, they're still going after Pete Diddy. Hard You know. They, they raided his house for being at the Capitol on January 6th. They did. They said that he was calling for an insurrection going in and out of congressional offices. I was there. They're wrong. He was going in and out of congressional orifices saying Insert erection. He was framed The return of Karen Jones, Ladies and gentlemen, one of the wildest women in the history of the show famously stormed the capitol.


She did indeed. Actually we've taught, she's been on multiple times before. She ended up by her appearance on KILL TONY talking about storming the capitol. Her local government Allegedly Came after, right? Yes. Allegedly on video and proven over and over again. Her local government came after her because of the KILL TONY episode. So you actually sacrificed some stuff, sharing your story on the show. And You know I what I love about this show is there's always different shapes and sizes of people. Karen Jones, clearly the type of lady that Jack Shaw would jerk off to. That's what I was thinking. Listening. I thought, oh no, he likes older women. He is gonna jerk off to me. It makes me very uncomfortable.


Yeah, I was kidding. No one's jerking off you, Kara. No one in the world sing off you. And once again, just to be clear, I was being arrested and I was trying to come on the show because people that watch your show don't have a political bias for the most part. And I wanted to tell them some things. I, red band fact checked me on my first deal when I said no policemen were killed. So this was a way for me to A, get some truth out and b, get a new career as a standup comedian. It's a pretty fun thing to do, Jordan. It's a, It's a very unique crossover that you have happening There.


You Americans are really quite deranged. We are You know. Seriously. Seriously. That scares me. Coming from a psychologist. I mean, people call me crazy, but when you say it, it seems clinical. You Have your up, you have your upside. I would say a fair bit of courage. But anyway, yeah, it's been wild and it, I've really been having to thread a needle here because my husband and I pled guilty on the day Trump was convicted. You and Trump were both found guilty on the same day. Yes. And that, that's like my family thinks. That's wild. I just thought it was just another kind of crazy coincidence of the last 66 years.


This Bitch is nuts. Yeah. I am not nuts. I can count backward by seven. Try try that. Joe Biden. Amazing. But Karen, you are definitely very political, one of the more political people in the history of the show here. So tell us, what do you think about Kamala Harris being the supposed new democratic candidate for the United States of America? Well, remember I'm from California, so I was there as she first penetrated politics or was penetrated, I should say.


Willie Brown was our speaker of the house. And she's very good at knowing who to sleep with. She is excellent and that's a certain kind of smart, but she is, it's, she has screwed her way into maybe the presidency and hats off. Wow. She's what a patriot. What a strong patriot. No, she's a great storm. The capital. Right. Look at that. And I didn't storm. I walked in and I'm really a rule abiding person. Before we went to the Capitol, we were at the back of the blue rallies every Saturday in front of the Vet Hall You know we're we're squares.


Right? So a lot more is gonna come out. The truth will be known someday. Like What, what kind of truth? Tell us more What this is where it gets tricky because I had to swear under penalty of perjury that I knowingly entered the Capitol illegally. Because it's against the law to air your grievances at the capitol apparently. And I now know that I didn't know that at the time, but apparently you can't go to a permitted event at a capitol, at a public building to air your grievances. But I do understand that now. But as part of the plea deal, I also had to say that I knew Mike Pence was in the building.


Yeah. I could care less about that guy. And I went in at 3 0 2 and according to news reports, You know they had all like, went out a tunnel or something. But I, I just went in to show my husband the Rotunda. He had really never been in the capitol before. You Were just given a little tour. I was, we were tourists. And I had been so many times. I've been there a few times, including as a chaperone. I'm a very popular chaperone with my kids of other parents. And my husband was just such a eager beaver. He was like, I was seeing all the other tourists come out and was so happy. I said, do you wanna go in honey? And he's like, yeah. and you. And we went in there and then next thing You know, we were trapped, gassed, hit all this stuff.


But me rioting is this What is going on? It's, I didn't wanna be hurt making Karen's great again. That's what we're doing. Karen's, how did you get so tough? Oh, that's actually a good question. No, it is. I think your husband was trying to have you killed that day? No. My husband's a sweetie pie. We are, we are opposites. He grew up on a flower ranch. I grew up on a oil field. I had a tough upbringing. Lot of violence. I was sexually molested by a relative then Sexually Molested.


Yes. And when I told they said I was a liar. And then 10 years later, the guy gets arrested for molesting the whole dang neighborhood and goes to jail. Oh. I'm like, I told you, I told you. And they're like, you didn't tell us nobody Would molest somebody this chatty. I'd say that. Well, that's what they thought. That's probably why they didn't believe me. Did he really try to molest you or was he just trying to find your rotunda? No, if I told you about the molestation, it would like, it was it involved comedy. He pin me in a corner, stuck his hand down my pants and started using words I had never heard before. Because this is like, like shut up. 1960. No, I heard shut up a lot.


No, he was telling me a thing called a Johnny Fucker faster joke. And I'm like, this is creepy. I do not like my grandma's new husband. And so anyway, I Wow. I squirmed away and walked an aunt's house and told Oh, I said, you Squirt it away. Never let Us, I call and just ask a question. Yeah. This is wild Karen. You're always such an amazing interview. I didn't get To the tough part yet though. Oh, okay. Let's go. So then I find myself what would now be called a, a gang sexual assault. But back when it happened to me, it was called Getting drunk in the wrong place. And I was pregnant 15 and had my first child in the Salvation Army.


So my parents Wait, wait, wait. When you say you had a child in the South Asian army, what exactly does that mean Meant That means I Was an outfit in the Salvation Army. No, I just, I at that time Army. Yeah. Salvation Army. And we had officers that worked there. I lived in a group home, a booth memorial home run by the Salvation Army in Oakland, California. I got my GEDI went to school, I got my shit together. Met the greatest guy, got married, had two more kids, blah, blah blah. You know my life is wonderful. Everything that's ever happened in my life has made me a better person. I'm optimistic. I love my life. Isn't that the real American way?

She said that I had a nice penis and she followed that up with you have a nice penis, but it's not the biggest penis I've ever seen and I'm all about reciprocity.


So I gave her a compliment right back. I was like, you have a very nice vagina. In fact, it's the biggest vagina I've ever seen. It's really big. I was nervous the first time we had sex. 'cause I thought it was gonna fall in into some type of bizarre world where I have a huge cock and you're not a bitch now. I I, I hate when you're dating a girl and she brings up how badly her ex-boyfriend treated her. That really pisses me off. 'cause I'm like, I could have been treating you like shit this entire time. Let you meet my mom. My, my ex-girlfriend made me quit. Is that my time? Alright guys, that's my time. Thank you.

Like you're gonna get raped and then you're gonna play yourself out like the Titanic band. Any man capable of saving you has tinnitus and cannot register that frequency. You need a little device that sounds like a 24 valve cranking. And then not starting a man who was just hit by a bus is gonna just reassemble his limbs like the Avengers and get there faster than Jimmy John's like They're in 15 minutes.


Are the rapes on him? Man, that was my full minute. All right. Well, Tony Hinchcliffe looks like the first wooden puppet to come to life on puberty blockers. It's not his fault.

But you do it anyhow. How come? How come? Because I have a personal drive to do it, and I'm not gonna let one person on a podcast or a panel on a podcast of highly respectable comedians tell me that I'm not good enough to do it. I decided in my heart that I wanted to do it, so I'm gonna do it. Woo.


Well, no one on the panel told you not to do it, right? No. But you made me feel like I shouldn't at a deeper soul level, welcome to The entertainment business. Yeah. But that's The thing is the reason I wanted to do, because the last time I was up here was my first time on stage. And the reason I wanted to do it is it was either gonna go well or it was gonna go really badly. And I wanted either extreme 'cause I honestly kind of expected it to go really badly, and I wanted to start from there so that no matter how many other places I've bombed, I'm like, man, it's not as bad as bombing and getting roasted on KILL. TONY. Well, There you go. You're true now. Any other? Yeah, I keep bombing and it's not stopping me. Do you think tonight went better than last time?

Marty Peterson, every, and with that, There's only one place to go from here we have one final comedian. He is an absolute thunderstorm of chaos. You know him as the Memphis Strangler, the vanilla gorilla, the Tijuana tarantula, the Detroit Dingleberry.


This is indeed the big red machine. The one and only William. Montgomery, everybody. So I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The bad news is Kamala Harris is now running for president. The good news, Maya Rudolph about to be back on SNL y'all for the visually impaired. Kamala Harris looks like an Indian woman who got her hair dead.


That's a pretty good one, I think. Okay. But seriously, Joe Biden is abandoning the race. Just like he abandoned his granddaughter. Hunter fathered with a stripper. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have a lot in common. For one, they've both taken shots to the face. Okay, that's my time. I was wondering how all of those would go. William, Montgomery, welcome back William. So nice to be here. Tony and I, I am currently on an hour and a half of sleep. I was in Miami. I had to, I, I got mixed up in the planes going, not flying on Friday, and I had to do a show on Sunday, and I slept an hour and a half last night.


Tony, I am just so exhausted and my throat is hurting right now. Scott, a new thing. That is a, we've been hearing a lot about this. Your throat hurting, you've been overworked. You, your, your, did you make all your shows with the flights being canceled and whatnot? Hold on. Scott Peterson. No, it's not Scott Peterson. Oh, oh, William, I was wondering. Yeah, you got Scott Peterson. I thought he was in prison. No, Scott Peterson, William. Oh. But yes, I was able to, I was able to make the flights on Saturday, but then I had to do a show on Sunday and now my voice is killing me and I'm exhausted. I don. So did you miss Friday shows? I had to miss Friday shows.


Isn't This is like a new thing that's been happening with you where you don't make your first night of shows? Well, this was don don't remember what the event was called, but this is a very special event where it wasn't actually my fault Tony. So that's how that works. But it actually was kind of, it was kind of strange. I was actually getting high on my couch and my father Larry we're always texting and he texts me these two very long text messages and I read the first line of the first text message and it says, William, I know you're just sitting on the couch, get a couch getting high. And then I set it down. So that's, there's no much story. I was scared to read the rest of It. So was he right? Yes.


I was high on the couch. But don don't know Tony. Yeah. Maybe I need to start going to the places early. don don't know. don don't really want to do that. Really? I don't really want to go to these places a fucking day before. I just don't want to. Right. Do you keep taking like, the last flight to these places? Is that the one that you booked so that you can get sleep? Yeah. This last one. Maybe it was one in the middle of the afternoon. Yeah. Have you ever thought about going to a professional development class? No. Is that funny? Is that what y'all are laughing about? The fuck? No, I need help Tony. I need help. I mean, this is a cry for Help. Do you need the earliest flight to places so that if things go wrong, you, you can have backup plans.


Okay. Especially now that you're here in Austin where there's not quite as many flights as la Okay, I'll start doing it. I gotta work. I gotta really Start working. Is there, is there such a thing as like a disciplined comedian? No, no, no. That, that, that. No, not really. No. Is like disciplined accountant? Yeah, Yeah, yeah. So I'm with you on the missed flights, I'd say. What do you mean? Or what does that mean? Or what do you mean? I think you were getting my back. I think I was trying to understand what you were saying though. What are you saying? You miss flights too sometimes. I'm just, I'm just trying to offer you some understanding. No, I don't ever miss flights. You don't? No. He would never, he would never miss a fucking flight.


But meanwhile, you missed two, your last two weekends, isn't that correct? At least two. Yeah, But only one. Only the shows on Friday. I missed, but I made it up. It's okay. It's okay. Don't you think it's weird to travel to a city to make half as much money as you could if you made the Fuck? Well, it was so funny to Tony. I made the same amount of money as I did in Vancouver, Canada with five sold out shows in Vancouver. And I made the same amount of money doing three shows in Miami just because of the taxes and everything. Right. Plus we also try to make our dollar not worth anything. We're quite good at that. Do you like, what's it Trudeau? Are you Justin Trudeau fan?
