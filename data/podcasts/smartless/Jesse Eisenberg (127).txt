7:
Sorry I clap so loud. Thank you so much. Yeah,

2:
You didn't, do you have large hands?

7:
Let's see your hands. No, I think I was like, I think I didn't understand where I have to be in relation to this microphone. You know what I

4:
Oh, oh yeah. No, it's, it's

2:
Difficult. It's just, they just gotta know that they're micro. It's

7:
Just a new mic. I'm working with a new mic. Yeah. Yeah.

2:
Do you do a lot of a lot of microphone work? Do you have a podcast? Everybody works.

7:
No, no, no. Nor do I do a lot of mic work. I mainly use, you know, just like the, my headset. But today, you know, your podcast is worthy of this road. N-T-U-S-B mini. Wow.

2:
Stop trying to get free shit, Jesse. Jesus.

4:
We bought it. You don't have to sell it. Look who's

7:
In on this. Even across the pond. I take my road. I'm in England. Oh, that's why, that's Yeah.

6:
Get ready to be showered with Mike.

7:
Yeah, right. Exactly.

2:
Now are you damnit, you're in England Doing what? Doing something else? That is very

7:
Difficult. I'm the dressing room of the like Grand Graham Graham Norton show. Oh,

2:
Gram Norton. Are you really? This is not chatty man, right?

7:
This is, I'm doing a meta press junket. I'm doing it from the press. Yes.

6:
Wow. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

2:
Wait. You're about to go out on a talk show and you're recording a podcast.

7:
Yeah. I mean, but this is good. 'cause I can stay in this kind of like self-indulgent place. I could just talk about myself for the next 48 hours and I'll be okay. It okay to

2:
You work so hard, like I can only do one thing a day and the rest needs to be played. Here's,

6:
Here's an idea, here's an idea. Just go with me and Jesse, you can, you can throw this out if you'd like. And, and also welcome to SmartLess, but I just wanna say this, why don't we, the four of us come up with a fake story for you to tell on the Graham, nor show that we'll all build. Oh, yeah. Right. Because he won't know now until it comes out, which is way

2:
Later. Oh, go, go Will.

7:
So, okay. Wait, this is, this is like a prank pulled on me or him or what?

6:
On him or on the world. You're

4:
Just, well, you're gonna be in on it. Okay. Got. It's

6:
Just like a fun little Easter egg that a couple months from now people don't,

7:
That's interesting. Do you wanna do a whole story or should we do like a word?

6:
Or We could do a word

4:
Or you could do a word or you could do that. You actually, both of your legs are, have been replaced.

7:
Let's do the word.

2:
This does bring up a good point though. Will, will. Unless you've got something in mind here.

6:
Yeah,

2:
Okay. It does bring up a good point. Yeah. That maybe Tracy is unaware of. Jesse, Tracy is Sean's sister. Not who in Wisconsin. She not hip, hip to all the, the business tree stuff. The

4:
Inside. She's on the

2:
Outside. Sure. And so for Tracy, before we do talk shows, you know, the nighttime set, you do what's called a pre-interview where you talk to the segment producer and you come up with stories and crap you're gonna say and kind of work

6:
Out your interest. Right. Which I imagine you've done Jesse for this show. For Yeah. Not, not for us, but yeah.

2:
There's a big pre-interview

7:
For, no, this one's a weird one. The one with this is weird. They, they're basically like, we're, I'm, we're on with like, I, I'm with Kieran who's in my movie, and then like I'm with Daniel Craig, you're on with other people. Right. And so you stay on the couch. And so the pre-interview. Exactly. And so the pre-interview with this one was like Daniel had, Daniel was shooting in Italy. What was it like shooting in New Orleans 15 years ago on a movie? Basically the link is that we both didn't shoot a movie in New York City. And so, like I realized the stories they're going for are just these incredibly tenuous links with the guests who have nothing in common, which never.

2:
Right, right. Yeah.

6:
You know what's funny is that both you, ironically, you, Kieran and Daniel have all recently are all recently

2:
It might have been the last three guests we've had Yeah.

6:
On our show. No. Yeah.

7:
Yeah.

2:
Is that true? Truly?

7:
Well that's the thing. That's the thing. Well,

2:
That's all I need, Karen. There you go. What a pain in the ass. He is Jesus Christ. How? Just he an asshole. This guy. I, he's so negative. Not cheery at all. No energy at all.

4:
No hobbies. No

2:
Hobbies, no nothing. No.

7:
But I can't tell if you're kidding. 'cause actually that does describe a version of that I know very

2:
Well. He's like, okay, the greatest

4:
We love

2:
It's said very nice things about you as well. We loved having him. Okay.

6:
Maybe it's something about the fact that everybody that now that, that doing the Graham Norton show, you can't do it until you've done SmartLess. I don't know. Yeah. Work on it. No bad ideas, no bad ideas.

7:
Something like that. Listen, I'll figure that out in the moment. Don't you worry.

4:
Yeah. But literally the order was Daniel, Craig, Karen, and then you on our show. And now that's crazy that you're all on the same panel on that

2:
Show. That's what we just said, Sean. No, I know, but that's,

7:
But we can continue to to, to analyze. Yeah. It's amazing.

2:
Was that literally the la No, no, it wasn't, it wasn't the literally the last three was, I

6:
Think it was. No, it was, oh, there

2:
Taro. And Yeah, that was, nevermind.

7:
You know, Kieran is like the, oh, he's like the biggest fan of your show. And a just a very uncomfortable thing happened once is where he told me we were on a plane. And he said like, he loves your show so much. He said, except one episode. And he told me the name of the guest and it actually does escape my memory. Now I forgot who he said was like a, not a good guest. And then I ran into that person And I was so nervous that I had this information in my head that they were the worst guests on SmartLess. And So I said to them, Kieran said, you were the best guest on SmartLess.

2:
Tell me what

7:
You did. Like. Oh, really?

2:
And you don't remember who it is?

7:
I don't remember who it is.

2:
Alright, wait, let me get to my questions. I I've got great questions. I'm an incredible interview, by the way. It's so nice to meet you. I've been such a fan. Me too.

7:
For oh my God. To meet

2:
Of you. Of course. Meet Jesse.

6:
Meet Jesse. We met briefly.

7:
We met each other. Will. Yeah. Yeah.

2:
Wait, what, where,

7:
Where was it? We did like a, it was like a, it was at a, well it was in la like a studio. But we were doing like a promotional video with Jimmy Kimmel for Batman.

6:
Yes.

7:
Yes. Yeah. Do you remember that? So

6:
Weird.

7:
Yes. It was so weird with Ben

6:
Affleck.

7:
That's right. It was like a reverse engineered idea. Caval. So Caval. Yeah, that's right. It was like they were meeting at a party And I was playing the bad guy. And Yeah, you came in afterwards And I think Jimmy Kimmel came in afterwards as Batman or something. I can't remember it.

6:
He came in, he was, no, he was saying Batman and Superman and then, and

2:
Then Lego Batman.

6:
And then I came and said, Lego Batman. And then, and then Ben said something like, you're not the, you're not really supposed to be a real Batman. And I said, well, you might want to check the box office.

2:
Yeah, that's great. Something,

7:
Yeah.

6:
Here's what I was left with. And tell me if you agree with me on that, Jesse. Sure. I was really impressed with Jimmy Kimmel's acting. I thought he did a great job that day.

7:
Really? That's not, And I told him

6:
That.

7:
Yeah. I Would hope so. Yeah. I, that's not exactly the thing I walked away with. I can't remember. Was he really good? Wait, like how so? Like, like he, I seemed genuine.

6:
Well in, in that I guess, look, the bar was low. 'cause I thought he would be f fucking terrible.

7:
Oh, got it. And he was engaged. He was like generally engaged.

6:
He was engaged.

7:
Yeah, that's true. That's seemed

6:
Like he was really listening in the moment. Yeah,

7:
No, that's true. That's

2:
True. He, I I guarantee you he's a great actor. I, you could, you know, you can just tell with some people that they, they just kind of know the way they come across and therefore they're able to sort of calibrate that and guide that, you know, and, and incorporate lines into that. Like I bet he'd be a great actor.

6:
Hey, but Jesse, when did you start? We all know you as a very accom, as I said, very accomplished actor. And I am also like Sean and, and Jason I imagine very big fan of, of your acting. I think you're really, really good at

7:
Oh God, me too. Of course.

6:
Always. But as a writer, as a, when was that that you, did you always write or was that something that came later?

7:
No, I've been like, I've been writing like, plays like in New York for like 20 years. But this is like, And I've had like some, you know, some popular plays or whatever. But like, nothing to like this level. Well, I had two plays that were gonna go to Broadway. We were both canceled the week before we put out the press announcement for different weird reasons. So like, this is the first thing that I'm really getting like, more attention. And it's quite surreal. 'cause I feel like, well, I've been doing the same thing for 20 years, but people like this one. And it makes me wonder where I went wrong 20 years ago.

4:
Wait, tell me what it is. Tell me what it is.

7:
What, what, what is

4:
You're set, you're doing a play right now?

7:
No, no, no, no. Now I a real movie. The film.

2:
You

7:
Talking about movie

4:
With? I thought, I thought you were saying you were

7:
No, no, no, no, no. I gave up on, I gave up on the medium entirely. 'cause it gave up on me. Got it. Got it. And so, no, no, just now. Like, I wrote a thing that's like, now, now people like it and they're saying, well look, you know, it has this unusual tone. I wanna say I've been doing that for so long, but no one liked it. But anyway, so yeah. And before that I was just writing like joke writing. I wanted to write, you know, sketch comedy when I was younger. No

2:
Way. Really, really,

7:
Really. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah. When I was 17, I put together like a packet for Saturday Night Live. Actually when I was 16, I wrote a script about Woody Allen and it got sent to, hi. It was about like a fictional version of him now at 16, which is what I was changing his name to Woody Allen. And it got like, sent through various channels to his lawyers, who then sent me a cease and desist letter.

4:
Oh my God.

2:
But then you ended up doing three films with him. Did it come up?

7:
I did movies. It came up once we were on like a press junket. He's so uninterested and anybody else, you know, so like, I don't mean that as a criticism. He's just like, he's just like, basically I knew what would happen is that somebody during press would bring it up. 'cause it's like a cute story that's on the internet. And he would go, oh, that's interesting. I never didn't know that and would never think about it again. Wow. And I knew I can go up to him and say, Hey, that was weird. Right. He would just have no, he just doesn't have any interest in stuff like that. I think he's just been like so famous and celebrated for so many years that he's uninterested in like the public persona. Yeah. Wow. And so now he didn't care about that. And we didn't share a nice laugh or a drink. Yeah.

6:
I love the idea that you're like waiting, waiting to get a response to your submission and the responses this season.

2:
Yeah. Yeah. But it's also like you bring up like, hey, so you sent me a lawyer letter. What about that? Is that, I don't know anything about that.

7:
Well, the lawyer is his producer. Like, I got to know the lawyer, but I'm sure there were 10,000 letters. Like they were sending that every day to everybody who wanted to make a movie about him. Right. But I remember I was, you know, I was, I got home from school one day and my dad said, we have good news and bad news. I was like, what's, he's like, what's, I said, what's the good news? He's like, we heard from Woody Allen. I was like, what's the bad news? He is like, you might have to get a lawyer. And he sent me a thing And I framed it right away. It was so exciting, you know? Wow.

4:
That's pretty

2:
Good. So when you're writing a play versus a film to a ding-dong like me, it would seem that writing a play is easier because it's just dialogue and a film. You've gotta incorporate what the visual component is going to be as well. And sort of imply some of the, you know, the inner thinking of the characters as well and all that. Is that, is that, is that fair to to say that writing a screenplay is more difficult?

7:
Mm. I mean, no, I mean, I think it depends on like the project and like, you know, you know, you could make the same argument that you have to keep people's attention for two hours on one set. And you know, there's something incredibly difficult about that. Whereas a movie, you can have music come in and you could have closeups and you could re-edit it to within an inch of its life. And it could turn into something that's test screened a bunch of times. So like, no. I mean, my plays have been basically like four scenes total. So like a half hour scenes and you know, so like half hour scenes for a two hour play. And I like that my mind works in that way to like, keep scenes going. So my struggle with like movie writing is to just make sure the scenes are not seven minutes

6:
Long. Holy shit. JB he just clowned you, dude.

2:
What? Why,

6:
Why, what happened? You just got totally clowned because you,

2:
I'm so clowned. I didn't even realize You didn't even

6:
Realize. No, I'm

2:
Kidding.

7:
But I thought there was, I was clowning him, but I thought there was a gentle, I was doing it gently.

2:
It's gentle clown. You're speaking of clowning him with a baby wipe. Speaking of clowns, your mother, your mother started another silly internet thing. Sure. You know, 'cause I do deep research on Wikipedia.

7:
Yeah, yeah. It sounds like you read that first paragraph. Yeah. Yeah.

2:
It's right up top. Yeah.

6:
Fucking Jesse. I want Jesse to come once a week and just come in, set a straight me and then be like, I gotta go.

7:
He read the snippet from the Google search engine, you know, where a million things come up and he read the snippet.

2:
Oh yeah. Even click on the link. The, the directing thing. Are you loving the directing thing as, as mu And I apologize. I bet you've gotten this question a thousand times. Are you loving it more or less or the same as writing and acting?

7:
Maybe a little less only because it's such a managerial thing as you know. Well, I don't know actually what your experiences have been, but for me it just felt like I was just aware constantly on set of somebody's plane maybe being delayed. Right. Like my experience and when I'm writing, I'm sitting in a library by myself and acting. It's like kind of an emotional, private experience that you can have. And then I just remember, like, I spent the day thinking about this person's hair person flying in from England. And if there was rain in England, they were gonna be late. And I, I don't think the actor would come to set. And I was like, this was the least creative thought I've had in my life, let alone on the set of a movie.

2:
Yeah, exactly.

6:
Fucking interesting. That's a such a great point.

2:
Right, right, right, right.

7:
Does that ring true for you or,

2:
Yes, it can, but then I just make sure I hire correctly. You know, when it comes to line producers and adss and stuff that you really, you know, they, they sort of, they, their, their, their, their sweet spot is managing right.

7:
That kind of stuff.

6:
Do you ask JB do you ask them to protect you from information that you

2:
No, I actually, I actually want to hear about it all. I just don't want to have to fix any of it. Yeah,

6:
Right. I I get that.

7:
Wow.

2:
I

7:
Get that. So you don't take on for no apparent reason at all the anxiety of their jobs.

2:
I do to the extent that it, that it affects the harmony on the set. That that's the part I get really passionate about. Oh, that everybody deserves to have a great work experience. Yeah,

7:
Me too. Mm.

4:
Jesse never having met you before. You see, but I've seen tons of your work And I Do

6:
You think I should dye my hair? Is that your question?

2:
Yeah.

4:
Do

2:
You think I should?

7:
I've heard about the sides. Sean, you look amazing. You look,

2:
Thank

4:
You. Yes.

2:
Sweet little baby. Thank boy

7:
Jesse. Listen, I was sitting there in silence just evaluating all of your temples And I think you all look great in your different ways.

2:
I'm, I'm in the, my piece is getting washed, so I've got the lid on it. Your piece

7:
Is getting

4:
Washed, you know, what is that? Is that a hood or

2:
What? Yeah, it's a shitty hood. Here we go. Oh, it's a hood.

4:
Let's get, oh,

7:
Look at that. Oh, it's shorter than I thought. Okay. Yes.

4:
My, so I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make a guess about you and you tell me if I'm way off or

2:
Not.

4:
Wow. Capricorn, you speak Libra. You, you seem, I I've seen interviews. I've seen your work. You seem extremely intelligent. You very sub you're very cerebral. You're, you're, and you speak very quickly. Why do you, why do you

6:
Say sea? Okay, sorry. Keep going.

4:
Cerebral. And, And so am I right in guessing that if that one of your pet peeves is people that can't keep up with your, the pace of your intelligence?

7:
Oh God, not at all. No. I feel mortified and, And I feel mortified and pretentious when I open my mouth. No, I, oh really? Yes. I'm aware that I probably sound like annoying to many people

4:
That No, no. You sound

2:
Brilliant. It's music. How dare you. It's classical music. Turn it up. It's classical music. Yeah. That's all

4:
I listen to. Yeah. No. Okay. 'cause I do, because I get, I have a, I have a short fuse if I'm, if I'm like, focused on something and somebody can't keep up with me, I have a short fuse.

7:
Oh God. No I don't. Well,

4:
Do you suffer fools?

7:
Me? No. I, IIII have,

2:
I've got a tough time with that.

7:
Deep shame and self-hatred. I assume everybody else in the world is like, kind of Right.

2:
But what about, but what about, how about said differently? What about people who don't work as hard as you at Yeah. At a gi at a given moment, especially when you're, that kind of what I mean when you're directing or when you're having to oversee a bunch of stuff. Yeah. And you've noticed someone's just kind of dogging it. Like, does that get at

7:
You? I just haven't felt that way ever. I just feel like so indebted to that. Anybody's coming to the set and waking up at, at six in the morning and they probably have a dog that's being left home alone. No, I just don't ever feel that way. But I think I'm just encumbered with guilt. So like, I just wouldn't a, a thought I wouldn't allow that thought to come into my mind. 'cause I Would feel, well why am I worthy of having that, you know? Oh,

4:
Okay. Got it.

2:
And we will be right back.

And now back to the show.

6:
Did you grow up in the city? Are you, did you grow up in New York?

7:
I grew up in Queens and New Jersey, So I never Manhattan. Oh, you did? Yeah. Oh wow. That's why I have this neutral accent. Do you

6:
Live, do you live in New York now on the east coast? Yeah, I live in

2:
Chelsea. Careful.

4:
Yeah,

7:
You do. What

2:
Do you mean? With what he's getting close to the address. Don't give it to No,

6:
He said Chelsea. He said Chelsea. Yeah, I can tell

2:
The room. Don't give him a street and

6:
No, I'm just saying, do you want to have lunch at Cafe Clooney next week? That's all I'm saying. In the West Village lunch for a second. Yeah, why

7:
Not? Yeah, we could do that. Yeah, it's

6:
A great place. I'm gonna be there if you'd like to have lunch. I'm gonna get, you're

2:
Gonna get the table. Let me ask you about this. The, the, the amount of focus it takes to write. I, I've done it once and it was a very long time ago and it was very humbling. And I've got a massive amount of respect for folks that can fill a blank page once you go through that process and you've really, you know, grind it away at the wordsmith of it all. And then an actor starts to play with that dialogue on set and starts to kind of go off a little bit and round the edges and, you know, paraphrase a little here or there. Does that, are you good with that? Or does it make you crazy? And then I've got a follow up to this And I think you know where I'm going, but go ahead. Oh

7:
Yeah. So no, as a, like, again, my background is playwriting and no one changes the words ever. 'cause when you do a play, I mean, as you, you get written up all know. Well also yeah, that, but also like most playwrights are dead, so you're just not, theater actors are not in the habit of changing dialogue, you know? And then, so this is my second movie and yeah, I just, yeah, it doesn't, it brings weird to my ear, So I don't like it. But, you know, occasionally somebody's so brilliant, like Kieran, as you met, he's so clever and quick and spontaneous. So, you know, he would sometimes change a word here and there and it was always really good.

6:
You wouldn't, you wouldn't like come in. You wouldn't come in after taking and go, huh? Okay. All right. Let's just a script

7:
Here. Interesting. I'm just gonna double check. Yeah. Sorry, I'm just gonna leave it right in front of you just just because we don't have a coaster.

6:
You must have gotten old. You must must have gotten old. Exactly. You

7:
A different, exactly. Yeah.

2:
So then wasn't, it wasn't o onerous to you to, to do, to work on social network with Aaron Sorkin's stuff who is somewhat Yeah. Famously, you know, an versus is is a, is is is sometimes a problem. Like there you have to really stay strict word for word word. Yeah. Is that true? Was that your experience on that, on that film? And if so, was it, was it a hassle?

7:
That wasn't my experience, but I don't also think I tried to change anything. Yeah. It wasn't like I had a clever idea that was like funnier than Aaron Sorkin's joke, you know what I mean? No,

2:
But, but just in an effort to make it sound sort of just naturalistic and you know, one,

7:
My character that's really interesting. My character didn't talk in a naturalistic way. He was kind of like this, like almost robotic presence. And so actually for me it felt like this is perfect. In fact, the gamesmanship of like adhering to this exact thing Exactly. Was part of the character.

4:
Yeah. That makes saw it by the way, like two, like last year for the first time.

2:
Oh really? In that film. It was

4:
So good.

2:
And you got an Academy Award nomination for that. Yeah,

7:
That's right. Yeah. Hold it

6:
Off. It's just incredible. So it's so good. Right? Shine out the official review. So I, it's so good because I'm just gonna log to log it. Hey,

4:
Well, because I was like, I, I, I think I, because

6:
Sean, oh hang on, there's walk. Go ahead Sean.

7:
So it's a So good

4:
Ellipsis. I think I have, I avoided it because I knew there was gonna be a lot of talking in it and then, but I watched it And I was like, oh, I wasn't, this is So,

6:
I mean this is, this is Jesse's interview, but I apologize, but I I I'm having a tough time escaping from, I avoided it because I knew there'd be a lot of talking and it fucking,

7:
We can go down that.

6:
I mean if, if ever there were an example of why we're living in Idiocracy, this is it right now.

2:
It's a

6:
Fucking blight on the entire civilization. Yeah. Like you have a fucking encouraged us to know we're in this fucking hole we can't get out of. Exactly. Because you wanna drool in front of the fucking television. Exactly. Hey, Jesse,

4:
Anyway,

6:
Having seen, having, having been in the social network, what did it, it must, what impact did it have on you in, in your regard to social media, to Instagram specifically social media in general? That's it back then, a few years later and now,

7:
I mean, I never did it and don't do it, But I dunno, I feel weird like putting more stuff about myself online. Like it's already kind of embarrassing, you know, like it's weird to be a public person in general. So I didn't wanna go online, but that's mostly has to do with my just complete discomfort with myself. And so like, I didn't wanna like talk about, you know, I guess things, but, you know, I don't know. I'm suspicious of it for so many other reasons too. And you know, the movie depicts like this person creating it who does not have like, what I Would consider like, kind of healthy social relationships. And so like, if this product is the extension of this person's social behavior, then this is not great.

6:
Well, yeah, that's a really good way to put it. The, in the, in in effect that, that this person's behavior, that this person's outlook and on, on human relationships is now being projected Exactly. As a way, as, as a mode of living and as a, as a mode of, of people interacting. Yeah. And now, but

7:
Think about it this way too. Like we used to interact like in kind of ways that are kind of mushy. You know, you would make a weird joke and the person wouldn't react the way, so you wouldn't make that joke again. Or you would find that somebody has the same sense of humor and like what relationships get reduced to like, on like line. And forgive me 'cause I'm not on these things, but this is my kind of cynical like, attitude towards it is like, we like the same band And so it hooks us up and everything. And that's essentially like the character I was playing could in, could interact with people like that on this very much like, we both like this band, let's stand here and talk about it. And like, that's the way the thing works too, on the, it recommends this person to you or you know, if you're dating, it recommends this person to you and it's just takes out like the squishy humanness that we have in our lives outside of the internet.

7:
Yeah, for

2:
Sure. However, it it, I mean, could you, you, you speak, you, you've spoken before, you've spoken already on, on this, in this episode about your, your, you know, not to belittle it to be honest. It is, it's charming. The with your self effacing sort of, you know, that you, I'm comfortable with yourself And I thought, like I get it. We, we, we all are. But I feel like these, these social media things are meant to be a tool to actually help folks that

7:
Don't That's true. And probably it does.

2:
Probably It does. Yeah. It wouldn't get out to a bar and, and, and start. Yeah. So I'm, I'm wondering if you know No,

7:
No, I'm sure you're right. I truly know nothing about this. 'cause I'm not on it. I haven't had the experience of being on it. No, you're

6:
Not. No, no. I think that, that Jason, I think that there is, that's where it's sold as. Right? Right. And And I, and I think that in its, in its best version. We're were, were were people actually looking to do that? And it wasn't used as a way to, to enrich people then, then that's what it would do. Unfortunately, what is, what is become is it's designed to keep you

2:
Right. Engaged

6:
To sell ads. Now. Now what it's done is it's designed to keep you opening the app. Here he comes, Sean. So that, so, so that your eyeballs will be exposed to advertisers. We all need advertisers. I'm not, but that keeps us all employed. Of course. Yes. That is its design. Right? And it's not to keep people engaged. And I think that there was a time that maybe that was the idea and maybe that's what the social, when it, when it was called the Facebook was about. But it unfortunately, what it has become is become this thing that's become incredibly divisive. And it is, and all it's done is reinforced instead of, instead of celebrating the similarities, it's reinforced the differences between people.

6:
It's had the opposite effect. It's, it's stunning. All these kinds of things. We're talking, you know, We talk about inclusion stuff, all these things that all they've done is help create these mini, mini barriers between us all and said, I am this And I am this And I am this and you're that. And, and we've created more division I think, I don't know. Yeah.

7:
That's my perspective. But my perspective is really as an outsider. 'cause I haven't been on it. But yeah, like that it, it it creates, you know, isolation, sectarianism all this stuff. Wait, just,

4:
Are you on social media?

7:
No, no, no.

4:
I'm kidding.

7:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm actually, do you mind I'm actually live tweeting the soul thing, like

2:
Going

7:
Great. Sean said social network is so good.

2:
Thumbs up. Yeah. Now studying anthropology and social psychology in college. Yes. Yes. Now how, what did you, why did you study that when you knew you wanted to do what you're doing now? Or did you do it at the same time? Yeah,

7:
No, I was like, I, I went to college for 18 years before I got my degree. 'cause I Would like go to a semester and then take off and work, you know, and then go back. And So I got that, like I got my degree during the pandemic finally. Oh, you're serious.

2:
It took you 18 years.

7:
Yeah, exactly. It took me 18 years. Yeah, exactly. No

2:
Way to

6:
Get

7:
Wow. Like the second 18 years of my life. Yeah. From 18 to 36. And I chose anthrop. Holy shit. Anthropology. 'cause that was my wife's degree. She graduated like many, many years before. So that was her degree And I just wanted to have, you know, have something to talk about with her. That's cool.

2:
Yeah,

7:
Because I knew I wanted because I, it's

4:
Otherwise it's silence

7:
Wanted to be in the arts. Yeah. Otherwise she would not talk to me.

2:
Will you define anthropology for me?

7:
Yeah. Anthropology is like the study of, and I'm using quotes. The other, you know, it's the study of other cultures, the study of other people. You know, what you learn from it is that like your culture is not superior to another culture. Even if that culture is like let's say more poor or something, you know, you, you, you learn to kind of view cultures as their own value value to to, to, to like, to the effect that they have on each other. You know? So, so an an anthropologist would go to study, you know, famously go to Samoan village. Margaret Meat is his famous anthropologist. Go to a Samoan village and live with them and Right. Study their ways and everything. I

2:
Literally asked somebody last night, oh yeah. Who has a, a master in, in, in, in anthropology. I I asked her to define the same, same question last night. Oh, she, she said something very similar And I said, well what is the difference between that in sociology? And she said sociology is much more data driven. Is that, is that right? Is that fair?

7:
Yeah. Yeah. My dad's PhD is social psychology. And so he was studying basically like, you know, human behavior irrespective of culture, you know, it was about people interacting with each other. Gotcha. Anthropology really focuses on like cultures.

2:
Right, right, right.

4:
Wow. So so what, so, and, and you got your bachelor's or master's or

7:
What? I got my bachelor's degree. Yeah.

4:
That's amazing.

6:
Bachelor's degree. And then your dad's got a PhD. Yeah. This is an accomplished family. Jay, what'd you learn on the set of net? And Stacy, I remember you doing

2:
That. I learned how to scoop a bagel. You know, that's where I started really cutting the cards.

4:
So, Jesse, but first of all, by the time you're 65 you get your master, but second you. That's really funny. What, in your studies, what is the one kind of culture that you found the most fascinating or actually interacted with or whatever?

6:
Best and least. And least to be fair, best,

7:
Least

6:
Fascinating culture. Yeah.

7:
Yeah. Okay. The most boring culture you guys is I'm doing top 10 to them worst cultures. Yeah.

6:
I Would love if you only, you got it on Instagram, just so you can start posting things like the worst cultures. Yeah.

7:
And this one is boring but also stupid, so, okay. This one. No, I mean, well I kind of like, I, my, I did my like ethnography, which is like, you know, your big thesis. I did it on this, like this restaurant in Chelsea that was like the last remaining authentic Latin American restaurant. 'cause everything else had been, you know, gentrified away. And this place was, but it was so, it was kind of a cheat 'cause it was like down the block And I got to eat there while I was doing my field research, you know. But it was, it was really interesting to see how this place was trying to survive against, you know, basically. Oh, so

4:
So you do restaurants. I thought it was like cultures across the world. Like

7:
You're, like It is, this was cultural. Oh, okay. It was my white wife. My wife went to Nicaragua's.

6:
A restaurant review. Dude. Yeah.

2:
Not restaurant.

7:
What do you Yeah, no, it, and

6:
Actually we, wait, what restaurant was it? We can always cut it out.

7:
It was called Latza Dero. It's, it's not on, it's not there anymore. It, yeah, we published the thesis actually to Yelp. So it was interesting to get to publish. Oh no, no, no. I'm kidding. You know, not every, not every student gets their work published, but for me it went, it was in the body. Ye.

6:
And I got my, I went, I got my, my PhD from food, food porn on Instagram. Exactly. Fucking

2:
Alright, now what about, let's talk about, what about was, was Squid the Whale, the thing that, that sort of launched you a, a a a a bit?

7:
No, I was in a movie before that when I was like 18 Roger Dodger right out of Yeah, Roger Dodger right out of high school. Yeah. Right. And it was like, it was like the difference between having an acting career or not. Like it was literally the difference. 'cause like my, I was supposed to go to college that year and my dad, like, I pled with him. I was like, please just read the script. It's so good. And my dad read it and said, okay, you could take off a semester and do this movie. And the movie was like, not a hit, but was like popular amongst, you know, people who like movies

2:
And, and, and then that, that meant again, God bless Wikipedia, that meant no NYU for you, but the new school when you were done with it. Yes, yes.

7:
Oh my God.

2:
Which paragraph are you up, up to? I've been up, I've been up for at least an hour and half, half.

6:
Are you in, is that early career in school or are you on personal info? I

7:
Think it's under controversies

6:
Because sometimes they mix it up, you know what I mean? Like sometimes they,

7:
I think it's under cancellation.

2:
Alright, so then, so you do Roger Dodger and you feel there's something,

6:
Wait, can I just say this? Sorry again. Yes. Can I just say it is a real, I may have mentioned this before, but is a real testament to who you are in this world when your filmography has its own page on w Wikipedia. Have you ever noticed that? Oh yeah. What does that mean? That that is something else. When you go into somebody filmography and it goes and there's a link. Oh,

7:
It transfers you,

6:
It trans, there's a link because it has its own page.

7:
Oh, is that what's happening here?

6:
That is the highest

7:
Economy. That is the goal. That that is the goal. Yeah. You know, you've made it when you have to link trans transfer.

2:
Yeah. So there's, there's a feeling that is very tangible that it's like, oh, I think I might be able to make a career out of this. Exactly. Based on this, this sort of newfound access and inclusion. Yes,

7:
Exactly. Exactly. And like right after that movie I got like, offered another movie and it was to pay scale. It was like a movie. I don't think it ever got made. It was probably like a, a $50,000 budget. But I remember gonna, my dad was like, I could get jobs. Like I could literally just get jobs. 'cause before that, you know, I was auditioning for commercials and anything that I could possibly get an audition for and, you know, understudies and plays and stuff like that. So it felt like, oh, I can literally make a career And I possible living from this.

2:
Wow. Right. And then what, what, what was the next big job? Was it, was it Squid in the Whale?

7:
Yeah, actually no, right before that I did. Oh, this movie Cursed With, it was Dimension and it was Dimension. So it was run by Bob Weinstein and this guy would, it was crazy. This guy, basically, it was a West Craven directed movie. And Bob Weinstein would just constantly scrap everything we'd done to the point where we shot. It was supposed to be a 55 day shoot, we shot 125 days. Oh, oh my God. 'cause this guy Bob Weinstein, who's not like, you know, a writer, you know, would just decided he wanted to change everything in the script. And it was crazy. It was crazy. And oh my God, fascinating to

2:
Work with that man. I wonder what he's up to right now. I think we know what his brother's doing, but wonder what, what Bob

6:
Doing? Probably his neck in lawsuits.

2:
No, I'm kidding.

6:
What he's up to.

7:
I wanted to turn down the movie and he called me in for a meeting and he's threatened my career. And then he said at the end as I was leaving, he said, I know where you live. And I said, what

2:
Jesus Christ.

7:
And I was like, are you kidding? And he was like, no, no, no. She told me his casting director. He says, no, no. She told me where you live.

2:
Oh, these guys, wow. What, what, what a, what a duo. I know. Unbelievable.

7:
I, when all this stuff came out with the, the brother, I was just like, oh yeah, I've been telling this story forever. Right. And people come sometimes can't believe it. This sounds so shocking. And then of course my story was like nothing compared to Right.

2:
You know, cute. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That sounds cute. Alright, so

6:
Yeah, you're, you're like, who knew? It's, it's just like a fun, it's fun banter for a podcast. Yeah,

2:
Exactly. Exactly.

7:
Not, yeah. Not the,

2:
So now we're just squid in the Whale with the, with the great Laura Lenny. Oh yeah. The In the Incredible Noah Ba back. Yeah. Did you, did did And Jeff Daniels. Did you, did you, did you learn a great deal from, from Mr. Bombach there with the writing and the directing? Did that, did that plant an early seed for you?

7:
Well, it just, like, he was writing just stuff that amused him and Yeah. And so that was the, that was the trick. It's like, oh yeah, you can write the things that for you, like, and it'll, and it'll translate, you know, hopefully. Yeah. And the other main thing I learned was from Laura, And I don't know if she ever did this to you probably, but she had to slap me in the movie. Has she slapped you?

2:
Probably. Probably. Okay.

7:
So this is what she told me right before she slapped me. She said, she said, do you know what the, the, the trick is to slap somebody in a movie? And I was like, no, please tell me. Thank you. Tell me.

2:
She just whacked you. Surprise.

7:
Yeah. She goes, you look the person in the eye and then you just, you you hit them with your hand. And I was like, oh, that's not a trick at all. And so she just spent the night slapping me. And, and that was the trick. And then in this movie I made with Kiran, I said, you know, I have to slap him at the end of the movie and it's this big thing at the end of the movie. And I told him, do you know the trick? I learned this from the great Laura Linney. And I was like, you just, I slap you really hard. You just

2:
Gotta make sure you have eye contact.

7:
Yeah, exactly. Make eye contact. Yeah. Which doesn't mitigate the feeling at all.

2:
It's just No, it

6:
Doesn't, it makes it more personal. If, if anything, it makes it worse. Exactly.

7:
Yes, its

2:
True. I've had to do some slaps and I've found that you just have to change the timing of it on every single take so that you get surprising. Get that genuine surprise, you know?

7:
Oh, that's interesting. Oh,

2:
That's interesting. Which is not really fair to the person receiving the slap, but it, it's Right. But it's

7:
For great for the audience. Audience, you know. Yeah.

4:
And that's, he un will unwilling grace. If we had to slap somebody, Jimmy Burroughs would clap off screen.

7:
Wait, what

4:
Time it for Face? Really

7:
Wait, but Oh, but you were not actually near them, like

4:
Not him. No, I I Would, you would fake the slap. You would just in front of their face. But he would time it, he would just, you know, clap camera. Oh, that's

2:
Interesting. Camera. So that the audience would hear that it wasn't a miss. Yes,

4:
That's right. Oh,

2:
Interesting. The great Jimmy Burrows

4:
And by the, by the way, and that's the sound that they would keep in the show. Yeah.

6:
Oh wow. JB do you remember season one of Arrested Development And I was in a wheelchair And I was just, I was wearing a hospital gown and you were leaning down in front of you. It was the end of an episode and you're leaning down in front of me and as you lean down, I slapped you in the face. I was not in the script. It wasn't, it was apropos nothing. I slapped you and you looked at me and my bare leg was showing because I was wearing a hospital gown. Yeah. And as you got up, you slapped the inside of my leg so much that

2:
About as hard as I could, hard as I Oh

6:
Wow. And, and in the show I go, oh, just 'cause it really, it really happened. You fucking killed me.

2:
Right. And it was safe to do that because you're in a wheelchair, you can't possibly get up and run after me. And

6:
My character couldn't get up and run after him. So he,

2:
That he stay in the character. Yeah. Oh, that's

7:
Funny. Isn't that dumb? Was it It was not. It was happened on one take.

6:
How

2:
About

6:
The, it's in the show and that's the one.

7:
Yeah.

4:
And j And I learned, I learned on the tour of the, the SmartLess tour that Jason will just, I've never had somebody do this in my entire life. He will just walk up to me and slap me on my face. Yeah.

2:
Yeah. Why? Just, just sort of like, just

7:
To make eye contact. Hey buddy. I love

6:
The way you act like you're, you're just as surprise as everybody, Jason, you just went. Yeah, I know. I

7:
Learned that. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Like I just do that. Like I do it all the time.

2:
It's a love tap y'all.

4:
Well, it's pretty hard.

2:
We'll be right back.

And now back to the show.

2:
Now speaking of magic, the magic of movies, let's get to now you see me so there was a lot of magic in that. Or illusions. Sorry, will illusions. No worries. Yeah, sure. I Would imagine you did a little bit of training for that. And have you, have you retained any magical talents? Like do you, do you have a card? Do you have a go-to card trick?

7:
I do, I do. And it's weird 'cause I have like muscle memory from it. We just finished doing the third movie like a month ago. Oh my God. And I just do the same one trick. I know. And for audiences who are paying attention, will realize that the greatest magician in the world knows one trick.

2:
Yeah.

7:
Yeah. I just repurposed the one thing I learned. Yeah.

2:
Now don't

7:
You in a different outfit.

2:
Someone was doing a magic thing at something I was at last week And I, I just thought that like it, and, and he did a series of, of magical tricks as, as they do before they're done with their set. And by the time you get to like the third trick, you know, your mind's gonna be blown. You know, you're gonna be like, oh my God, how do you do that? And you just sort of like click into a gear of like, all right, let's see it. Here comes another sort of mind bending. Wow. And, and what I, what I thought was, what would really be impressive at this point is to now tell us how you did it because Yeah, exactly. I know I'm going to be shocked. Right. What would be really impressive is to see how you're doing this stuff. Exactly. So you trained yourself and taught yourself Right. To hide all these things that I didn't see.

2:
Exactly. Yeah. So when is magic gonna change into that? Perhaps? God,

6:
When are you gonna enjoy life?

2:
When,

6:
When will you enjoy

4:
Anything? That's the magic. That's the magic.

6:
My heart is breaking from you. I just had therapy. But when we're done, I'm gonna call him and I'm gonna bring you in. JB jump on with Terry. Fuck man. Oh God. My heart. I want drive.

2:
Are you to see a Terry? I want to hug you. Wonder if you see the same Terry.

6:
I really want hug you right now. I feel just, just there's just zero inner. Yeah.

7:
You can't experience wonder.

2:
I'll take it. I'll take a hug anytime or slap.

4:
But, but Jason, there was this show on tv, it was called like Breaking the Magician's Code or something like that. It's like magic's Biggest Secrets or something like that. And they did that. It revealed all those big like tricks and Oh, they did how they did it. I thought it was fascinating. Yeah, I

2:
Wanna see that. I'll look that up. And then,

6:
And then what are you left with?

2:
And then I'll just start reading ingredients on food packaging. You know, just knowing what's on the inside. There's tons of stuff. Yeah, yeah. Read credits on movies,

7:
You're gonna peek behind every curtain. Yeah,

2:
Yeah,

7:
Yeah, yeah. You know, when you, when you hear about these, like, when you hear how these magicians have done the trick though, sometimes it's far more impressive than the trick because the kind of work that went into making something look seamless is like, you know, shocking.

2:
Yeah. Right. For sure. Right, right, right. Alright. Talk to me about your, your move into directing, why that happened and when it happened. Was it, was it simply a, a result of you arriving at a place in your career where you could say, Hey, I want to now direct and you had this sort of industry capital in order to say that? Or, or did it happen more organically than that?

7:
No, I basically

2:
Words had you wanted to do it for a long, long time. And then

7:
No, I've always just wanted to write plays. And then my last play, which was like 2019, just like wasn't received well And I was like, kind of really? Yeah. Like kind of heartbroken or whatever. Like the play wasn't received well and I mean, the actors were amazing in it, but I, the play wasn't received well and like, So I just was like, I, I, I have to try something else. I, I just made me feel bad. And there was like scrutiny in a way that felt like mean-spirited in a way that it was like, oh, this is industry can be, I mean, movies can also be cruel, quite

2:
Cruel. Reviews

7:
Usually are, but there's something about theater 'cause it's such a small community. I don't know. It just, anyway, So I just thought, let me try to, I'll do a movie next. Yeah. No, but I love writing plays more than anything, But I just thought maybe I should do a movie. 'cause Yeah. And the thing you said about clout that like I did, I guess feel not so much clout, but more like, oh, I feel like I've been around it enough to kind of have an understanding of what to do. Yeah. I know that sounds so lame. Like, I didn't go to film school, but I just felt like, no, I've been on sets that have been great and I've been on sets that didn't work and I've been on sets of that were terrible sets, but made great movies and vice versa. So I felt like, oh no, I, I think I know what to do if I can write something that is like tailored to my limited

6:
Skillset, I, there's nothing wrong. Yeah. You obviously, you, you, you're around it, you pick up on it and it, and it makes sense that you would want, you know, want to sort of take agency and kind of do it yourself. And Sean, Sean last week is watching his chef open tuna cans for, and finally he was like, I'm gonna open a tuna can.

2:
That's

6:
Amazing. It's not dissimilar, you

2:
Know what I mean? I can pinch the top on Yeah. And let make the water come out. Yeah.

4:
Or at least let me try it. Yeah. Can lemme

2:
Just try

6:
It. I can eat the Hershey syrup out of the bottle. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Watch me

7:
Qui it. Of course. And I think it's a, and And I think in Sean's case it is cloud, you know, I think you

2:
Feel

7:
You've worked up to this And I think the industry recognizes that you can open that

4:
Stuff. I didn't wanna embarrass anybody. Yeah,

7:
No. And it's good that you're finally in a place where you feel like, yes, I can do that. And yes, I'm not gonna get,

4:
That is really good. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Jackson.

2:
So wait, so you, you were, you, so you were feeling a little in your fifis about getting the, the bad reviews basically on the play. And then you thought you'd go for something e with even higher exposure, directing a film where you would, you, you opening yourself up to even more

4:
A broader audience.

2:
Yeah. Yeah. Like that, that I was very brave of you, you went the other way. Oh.

7:
Oh, thanks. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. But I, I guess I'm used to scrutiny. I mean, I'm used to scrutiny And I, like, I care about it so much, I guess while it's happening. And then literally not the next day. I just, you know, I don't wanna be governed. Laura Lenny said the greatest thing that I actually didn't hear her say, but my dad heard her on Charlie Rose talk about this 20 years ago. But they asked, or he asked her, do you read reviews? And she says, no, 'cause I don't want somebody else to tell me how to do my job. And my dad was telling me this, 'cause I'm such like, I, I was like a, you know, self-conscious person. He said, you know, you're colleague who we in that movie with. Right. You know, this is how she views it. And it did really change my perspective.

6:
That's interesting. Yeah.

2:
It is a really odd concept. Yeah. I I I totally understand the, the, the, the aggregate, the, the, the aggregate of them. All right. So Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah. Where they put them all and then there's, there's sort of like consensus. Does this work for the general public, I suppose, since you're making a public effort with your art? Of course. Yeah, of course. Right. But specific inter specific reviewers, their specific take on how it affected them as an individual. Well, we're not making things for one individual. We're making things for a whole public. And so it, it's not gonna work for some people. And that doesn't mean that it's perfect. But,

6:
But I also saw like, well I, I, I think you're right about the aggregate thing, but, but at the same time, have there been films or pieces or music that have gotten bad reviews that you really

7:
Like? Oh my God, yeah. Course.

6:
Of course. Can you, can you think of one, what, what can you think of a

2:
Film of this, the New World, A Terence Maleek film, the New World Got got Not Great reviews, interstellar Chris Nolan's film, not Great Review. Like Sean, what about you? I love those two

4:
Films. Yeah. Interstellar. I mean, I can't think of them, but I know, I know that I I'll or I'll look on Rotten Tomatoes and Converse.

2:
The latest Batman film I thought was incredible. But,

6:
You know, Jesse, do, can you think, Jesse, can you think of a film?

7:
I mostly have it, it, like with theater, I mostly have it with theater where like, I am enthralled by the, you know, by a piece. And then it, I look online, I'm like, how is this torn apart? This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. Right. Yeah. Because there's something about like, And I don't know, maybe that even has to do with like, different performances offered different things. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, no, I do feel,

4:
But I, but I'll go the other way too. I

6:
The same way season three of Net and Stacy, 'cause there were, sorry, go ahead Sean.

4:
I'll look at Rotten Tomatoes and something will get like 90% or 95% and I'll watch it and I'm like, oh good. They did the work for me. It'll, it's, it's gonna be great. Right, right, right, right.

2:
And it's terrible.

6:
Like,

7:
I

6:
Know tenant nobody, a lot of tenant

2:
Oh, right. Movie

6:
Got ruined. I've seen it three times.

2:
Right. During Covid it got lost. Right.

6:
I, I loved it. Sean, you didn't love it? I

4:
Didn't love it. I didn't get it. Yeah. I didn't understand you didn't love

2:
It. One more thing about the directing thing. Have you, have you, have you ever gotten a a, a really crazy direction from a director? That's a, yeah. B how has getting weird direction from directing, from directors affected the way in which you interface with actors Also, you know, being an actor yourself. Oh yeah. And like you've, you've worked some incredible directors and I'm sure you've been able to cherry pick from, from the best of 'em and, and decided what not to do from the bad ones. But was there one in particular moment where you're like, I will never ever do that to a poor actor or crew member? Well,

7:
Only my friend, like Reuben Fleischer, who I think you guys know, like, you know, he, he just, oh, he did like the Zombieland movies and we just did, now you see me together, I've worked with him a lot. And, And I just remember I'm like the first Zombieland, he, we were shooting in like what was supposed to be like a mansion. And so he was like several rooms away on the monitor. And I just heard this muffled scream now smile. And I was like, I, I could like understand that he was kind of talking to me. Right. But also, I'm not like a smiler, you know, but also, like, it can't come, you can't, that's not the way you act. Like, oh, my face will smile, you know? Right, right. So, so he, he, you know, so that was just something I was like, oh yeah, I'll never, I'll never do that. But I love Ruben and now he's, now he's great. And But you guys have worked with Greg Mottola, I think too.

7:
Yeah, yeah,

2:
Yeah.

7:
Love. And he's just like my favorite. Like, I just, with the way he handled this crew and the cast, And I had like, which happened to me maybe two or three times in my life. I had like kind of a panic attack during a scene And I just shut down And I just couldn't act. I, I don't dunno what happened, I just connect. And So I, it was on this movie ventral, And I, I, I took him aside And I said, I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened. I think I had a panic attack. And I thought he was gonna say, well, you know, we can't, I thought he was gonna, you know, respond anno annoyed. And he said, I don't understand how you're not having a panic attack every scene. Right. Like, you are exposing yourself, you're bringing your emotions. Yeah. You're trying to not think about your own vanity.

2:
He is such a sweet man. Yeah.

7:
And I just remember thinking, that's the way I wanna think about actors forever, which is that like, they're already doing this difficult thing. They're, you know, trying to avoid thinking about their face being blown up on screen. They're avoiding thinking about the scrutiny that they're gonna get. They're trying to live in the moment despite a hundred piece strangers standing around them. And so that was a key for me. He's just the best, isn't he?

2:
Right. Which is why I don't understand, for the most part, we, actors are pretty crazy. And I, my I'm talking about myself. I like, I'm fucking nuts and I'm filled with neuroses and insecurities. Yeah. It is, it is a helpful tool to, And I, it's a helpful tool to, to, to, to, to, to call on when you're playing, you know, vulnerable characters. Right. But the central thing that we are doing, which is being up there in front of the camera, sort of is at odds with the inherent insecurities a lot of us have. Exactly. So speak, speak about that because a again, getting back to, you know, you're so, you're so self-effacing and honest about your own neuroses.

2:
How were you possibly drawn to this incredibly, you know, exposing profession?

7:
Because to me, to have like a prescribed way of behaving because of a character and lines. Right. I feel so comfortable. Like the thing that makes me nervous is like, you go into a party and what do I say to this person? Right? Yeah. Do I remember this person? What did this person tell me? Why do I have to be funny in this thing? I just wanna go home. Like to have like a prescribed way. Like you're playing this character, they wear these pants that we put you in. Right. And you have to now go talk to that other person in this voice. Like, it's much the greatest

4:
Thing in the world. Calming. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So

2:
Calming. Sure. Now what about those? I had the same, I had the same feeling and then I started doing talk shows when I was a kid and it, it freaked me out. Yeah. Yeah.

7:
Because it

2:
Kills me. You have to be, you. It kills me and there is no script. And it's like, and there is no you. Right, exactly. We talk about panic attacks. I, I'm prone to panic as well. And, and the talk shows for a long time were just like my kryptonite.

7:
It's the only thing that still freaks me out in our industry. Like literally nothing else. But going on these talk shows at night freak me out because I don't, I can't be funny telling a story for like the second time, you know? I

2:
Know. I

4:
Don't know. I've seen you on talk shows, Jesse. You're al always You'd kill it every time. Yeah, every time. Awesome. I agree. I've seen you too because

7:
I, I try to not tell the story on the show that I told to the person before the day. Oh right. Because I know if I did that, it would just be weird and phony. Yeah. You'd be trying to remember what made them laugh on the phone.

4:
Kind of like a performance. But if

2:
You get a great host like Kimmel or Conan or those guys, like they found, they like, they'll they'll go with you. Right. You can go, yeah, that's true. You kind of freestyle and they, they can just get into a conversation and you forget you're even in front of people. But

4:
Then, but you're doing this now, then you're doing Graham Norton. Do you ever get burnt out by all of the chatter that you have to come up with?

7:
I don't, I don't, I feel like an adrenaline rush when I'm meeting people like you who are really funny. Like, and him, I'm sure he's very funny. You know, I, you get the adrenaline rush of doing a thing that's fun.

2:
Right. And when you're, and when you're, when you're promoting something that you love, like this, this great movie, A real pain, like I'm sure it's just like you could talk all day about it, right?

7:
Yeah. I guess. Yeah. 'cause I've done junkets that we all have for things that are not, have not gone well and yeah. That can be really uncomfortable. And you're kind of just parsing that you've Right. Yes.

4:
Before we let you go, I just wanted to find, find you on social media. If I wanted to find your on social media, what's your hand?

7:
Yeah, exactly. Like where do I At the real? Yeah,

6:
Dejani

2:

6:
We were getting hammered and Jason had a very weak bladder 'cause he kept going to the bathroom. Yeah.

2:
And, and, and it was years later that I said to Will after, after I had put down the, the bottle like,

6:
Like seven years later. Yeah.

2:
I said to Will. Yeah. I said, you know, and Will hadn't been drinking either for a long time. I said, boy, fuck, I wish you And I had really gotten together when we were drinking. Yes. You know, I, and we would've had so that, so much fun. And he just looked at me and goes, oh, we did. And I had no recollection of partying with him that night. Oh,

4:
That's so funny.

6:
I love that, Jesse.
