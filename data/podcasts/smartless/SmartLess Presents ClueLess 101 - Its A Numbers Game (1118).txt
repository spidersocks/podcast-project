I mean, he is, he is a, he's a gifted gamer. Let me, let me just say that I got passed over a little bit on the game. On the game stuff. You did. And. I. Have I forgiven him? Yeah. And you. That's why I, I don't remember you being A, I'm a big person. I don't remember you being a part of the group at that moment.

It briefly turned into a James Bond movie with all the international locations that, that got thrown into the mix. Yeah. Sean will Jason Enough talking about the past. Let's look ahead to the present. Today's main event. It's a numbers game. TV show edition. Cue the theme song, TV show. And, I. Keep forgetting. I keep forgetting. There's a band right behind me and it's So, Because I saw them load in And.


I. I Can send all The weed. Yeah, you did. It's a numbers game. It's so good. All right, let's Begin. This game is built around TV shows with numbers in their titles. You are going to be tested on your very useful knowledge of television shows and also your very useless knowledge of basic elementary school math 2 2 7 2 7. I like That. You, you were so ready with a number. Right off the bat It will be a winner. And one of these questions, Each question will take the form of a simple math equation only. Instead of numbers, I'm gonna tell you a TV show title that has had the number removed from it. Oh shit. You're gonna have to recognize the show. Okay. Understand the number and then solve the equation using the missing numbers.


Got it. And you can get a bonus point as a group for responding with an answer in the form of a TV show title. So I'm gonna give you an example. This is just a practice one. This doesn't count till your score. Let's try this out. If I said Day Fiance minus for 30, what would the answer be? And you can talk it out too. Work it out between yourselves. 90 Day fiance, 30 for 30. So it'd be 60. Yep. You got that right. And if you wanted that extra point, what is there a show title with 60 minutes? Oh, 60 Minutes. 60 minutes. You got it. 60 minutes. Got it. Great. That's great. You could have also said Studio 60 or any of the millions of TV shows that have 60 in their titles. Yeah. Okay, then let's play. It's a numbers game TV show edition.


The first question is, million Dollar Man divided by Stooges. $6 million Man. Yep. Divided by, divided by three. Stooges. Stooges. Six divided by three is 2 0 2. And then you gotta do a show with two in it. 2, 2 7. Nice. You got it. Perfect. Two points. Two and a half minutes. Fuck. You used it. You, Yeah, you used It right away. I feel like, I feel like I should give you double extra points. 'cause there's two twos in that, in that name. Yeah. You should, I would like it. I'll take it. Yeah. Okay, so that's three points total for that first question. That's, you're getting more points than you're supposed to. Question two is Reno, nine plus and a half Men.


14. Reno. Nine. One. One. Three and a half Men. Oh shit. Two and a half. 12 men. Fucking dummy. He's 13, 10. Hang on, hang on. and Wait. and Wait. Reno 9 1 1. Could be 11 or one or two ones. Oh, I, I think we gotta go 11. I think we have to go with 11. Okay. 11. And then, what is it? I Think plus plus Two. Two and Half Men. 13 Is is 13 and 13 reasons why. Yep. You got it. That's great. Oh, nice. What's 13? What's 13 Reasons why? Oh, it's a Ya vehicle on Netflix. It can be seen Netflix. Massively successful. Young People love it. Young people love it. Yeah, that Sucks. And, I, And I can give you 14 reasons why.


Let's go to question three. This one might be a little more difficult. I'm gonna try to enunciate it as much as I can. This is Heaven. Okay. Times Company. Seventh Heaven. No, Seventh Heaven. 3 21. Wait, wait. 21 Jump Street. That's right. Oh, you got It. I wait. I thought you said something different on the second show. Thought it was six something. It Could have been six's company. Who's Your, Who's your cable provider? Could you get different Shows? Three and a Half Men, sixes Company. Yeah. That was very fast. Very impressive. You guys are blazing through this game. Let's continue at two. Number four. This question is Beverly Hills.


Oh two one oh minus is enough. 1 9 0 2 1. Oh. yeah. Is enough. Yeah. Yeah. But, but, But we gotta think of the show. Minus eight, which Is Oh, one Murder. Murder one. Murder one. Very good Will. Yeah, very good. You got it. Murder one. That's two full points. You, it's just fantastic. I'm, I'm Sean by the Way. You suck at this game. I haven't heard one answer from No, I got the first one. Why you don't Hitting in your hand. What are you doing? Okay, I'm writing the numbers down. Boy, it's obviously helping. Question five. Yeah. Things I hate about You Minus Babylon.


What is it? 10 things I Hate About You Or Two or what is it? What's that one? I dunno. Yeah, is it 10 things? Is it 10? Elliot? I think it's 10 things I Hate About You Minus Babylon. Five. Babylon, Babylon. Five. Yeah, Yeah. So it's Party of Five. Great. You got it. Wow. Wow. That was good. That was good. Party of five. Incredible. Will you have, you all have such unique strengths that come together as a team. Jason with the numbers will with the TV shows, Sean, with the writing down the numbers. Yeah. Which it's good for record keeping for later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for Sure. Yeah. You consider Sean when you consider it a compliment. And he says your strength is writing stuff down. Yes. That's All he could put I a great day.


You're Gonna have, I'll pick anything I can get. Is there in the Marvel, sorry? In the MCU, is there a cha? Is there Superhero? Which Who superpower Super was writing stuff down. Oh, this stenographer. He was this stenographer. Okay. That was a great game. You guys played an amazing game. But just because you're done with the game does not mean the game is done with you. There's also the matter of this episodes mega clue. Mega clue question. Beautiful. This is a final question made out of the answers of all the previous questions. So I'm gonna remind you what those answers were. I would tell everyone, except Sean doesn't need to know this 'cause he already has it.


Everyone take a moment to get a pen, something to write on. So. I can remind you of what the correct answers Were. It back on Sean, I take it back on Sean writing it down. That turns out That was smart. If you're driving, lodge your knees just underneath the steering wheel. Grab a pen, keep your eyes on the road somewhat. And Yeah, if you have a candle on your dashboard, careful. Sorry, Elliot. There are some No, no To Easter. Easter eggs here, But No, but it's a good point. Set aside the rotisserie chicken that you're picking out with your non-driving hand. So you can put a pad there so you can write during that time. Yeah. Okay. Here are the numbers that you have already had as your answers. 2, 13, 21, 1, and five.


Yeah. I'll tell you again. 2, 13, 21, 1, and five. Now I want you to add those numbers together. 42 And then subtract from that number. That was great. Then Subtrac, I, I didn't even have a pen with me and I did that in my, oh Man. Amazing. I didn. Talk about your superpower mask, Mr. Math, man. Hey, algebra. Okay, Now add those numbers together. 42. And then subtract the number of monkeys in the title of a television adaptation of a 1990s science fiction film. And then tell me, can you think of a show with that number in the title? Be 12 monkeys.


1334, but it's 34. Wait, 12 monkeys or eight monkeys? 12 Mon. 12 monkeys. 30. 30. 30 something. Is it 30? 30 something? Oh, wait, what? 42 minus 12. 12 Monkeys for 30. And then I was hoping that someone would say 30 something, because it's the rare television show where they spelled out the number. They didn't even just put A number there. They spell out 30. Yeah, that's right. And for one final. Absolutely. Last question. Take that last number. And. I want you to add it and stick It up. Yep. That's the way we'd end things on Smart list. You know, Take that last number, add it to 9,970. And can you tell me the name of any pyramids that are worth that much money?


Ah, 10,000. You got it. Hundred thousand. Elliot. I put you in this show on the top of a million dollar pyramid. It's so damn good. Yeah, thanks. I mean, Elliot. Elliot, you're brilliant. Appreciate it's a lot, A lot of fun. Appreciate. It's a lot of fun. You know, it's a hoot. You guys. Yeah. Listeners at home. Did you do better or worse than these actual 100% authentic, famous people? If you did better, maybe you should be famous. Your mom keeps telling me how talented you are. Think about it. Yeah, Sean. Well Jason, thank you so much for being with us today. I'll be very sad to see you go. So it's a good thing the show's not over yet, because every episode of Clueless ends with the cliffhanger puzzle. Stink music there, it's, You wanted more sting music.


You got it. Heavy baseline. The Cliffhanger puzzle is just a little bit of extra puzzle. We put it in a Tupperware for you to take home and pick at it until the next episode. And today's puzzle takes the form. Today's puzzle takes the form of a little story. Boom, boom, boom.


It seems that the energy drink, prime hydration has been so successful that the company celebrated by creating two solid gold prime bottles. The gold bottles are an appropriate vessel for the drink. Silver bottles would also be appropriate, but iron or tin bottles would not be. Why is that the case? That's for you to noodle over until our next episode. Sean will. Jason, are you guys gonna get any sleep between now and the moment you learn the answer to this puzzle? Not if I get all hopped up on Prime Beverage. Yeah, I'm gonna sleep great. I'm gonna sleep. I'm gonna be honest. Maybe Even better. Maybe I'm a little better Than normal.
