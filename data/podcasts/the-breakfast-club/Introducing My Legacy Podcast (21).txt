Welcome to My legacy. I'm Arndrea Waters King, and together with my husband, Martin Luther King ii and our dear friends, mark and Craig Kilburg, we explore the stories behind some of the world's most remarkable people. We'll sit down with visionaries, entertainers, and athletes to learn how they've turned challenges in the opportunities, and are living their legacies. Welcome, Billy Porter. We're here with Di Oye today, we're thrilled to welcome Martin Sheen. Welcome Simon Sinek. Today we're honored to sit down with Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Welcome Mel Robbins. These conversations are about more than just stories. They're about connection, impact, and living your best life. Legacy isn't just about what you leave behind, it's about what you do every single day. Please join us as we uncover the purpose and fulfillment behind the lives of extraordinary individuals. Listen to my legacy on the iHeartRadio app, apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts.
