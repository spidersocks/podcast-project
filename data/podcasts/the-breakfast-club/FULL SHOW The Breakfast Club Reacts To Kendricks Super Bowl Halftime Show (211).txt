I'm interested to see like if my interpretation was you guys interpretation of what the message that Kendrick sent. Okay. The double entendre, in my opinion,

0:
I'm sure we'll talk about it more during the show. I was a, a dance dad this week and salute to all the dance dads. I don't know why they would have competition during Super Bowl weekend, but they did. But congratulations to my daughter. One, I think won in the Trio Duo where a bunch of them, they won first.

0:
Let's get the show cracking. DD will be joining us this morning. You know Dane tomorrow, she's a, a Detroit rapper. She's actually suing Lyft for allegedly denying her a ride over her way. So we're gonna talk to her in a little bit and break everything down. We got front page news. Next. Charlamagne will be here in a second. Are we gonna start like that for Philly? Alright. I'm not mad at it. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. Good morning everybody. It's DJ Envy. Jess. Hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club Law on the Rosa of filling in for Jess. Let's get in some front page news. Of course. This weekend, super Bowl Eagles washed the Chiefs 40 to 22, drop a bomb for the Philadelphia Eagles and also drop a bomb for Sequan Barkley. He broke the NFL single season Russian record with 2,500 yards.

0:
So congratulations to him. X New York giant. Mm. Just wanna say that. Good morning, Morgan.

7:
What you trying to say? Is y'all fumbled at? Is that what y'all said? No, nevermind. I don't get

0:
To, we we helped the Eagles. That's what I'm saying. We helped the Eagles. They needed a little help. So we helped them.

7:
Alright, good morning. And Indeed. And I'm like, cool. All in there. It's, it is a little light. Hey. Hey Laura. How y'all doing? Hey, good. All, let's get into it. So Jalen Hertz, he's taking home the Super Bowl 59 MVP Honors. The Eagles quarterback completed 17 of 22 passes for 221 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. He added 72 rushing yards. And one score on 11 carries. Now again, like you mentioned, mv, the Eagles blew out the Chiefs 40 to 22 to bring the Lombardi trophy back to the city of Brotherly Love. It's the second ever title for the team who took down the Patriots back in Super Bowl 52. Now, meanwhile, chief's quarterback Patrick Mahomes, he passed for 257 yards, three touchdowns and committed three turnovers.

7:
Philly Rookie Corner, Cooper Deje. He picked off Mahomes and returned it for a touchdown for his first ever career interception, or his first career interception, while the defense combined for six total sacks without blitzing once. Now the 24 to zip halftime lead was the largest, second largest and sec Super Bowl history. And the 34 to zip advantage is the third quarter. And the third quarter was the biggest since Super Bowl 48 back in 2014. Now, of course, the Eagles succeeded in getting their revenge against the Chiefs after they fell to Kansas City. Three points two years ago in Super Bowl 57. Hey, coach Nick Siri spoke more about Jalen Hurtz today compared to who he was as a quarterback two years ago in that game.

7:
Let's hear more from Nick Sirianni.

8:
He just keeps getting better. He knows how to win. He does a great job of being able to block out all the outside noise. I think it's, you know, I I I find it funny when it's like, you know, well Jalen is, is good because he is got a good team around him. Like, that's football. Like again, you cannot be great without the greatness of others.

7:
So Eagles, quarter quarterback, Jalen Hurtz, he said, it's hard to put the win into words and running back Sequan Barkley. He said, the feeling is surreal. Let's hear more from them and how they feel about this game.

9:
Still processing it. You know, I I it's been a, it's been a long journey. It's been a, a journey of ups and downs and highs and lows. And I've always stayed true to it in the end. And having this vision of just being the best that I

10:
Can be, that's what it's all about. You, you dream about these moments as a little kid and you know, it, it is just amazing to have your family and friends and especially your family, you know, dealing with me throughout all the ups and the downs. And here we are, world champs

7:
And Chief's quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. He also checked in post game and said, most of the blame is on him. Let's take a listen to his comments.

11:
Credit to the Eagles, man. They play better than us from start to finish. We didn't start how we wanted to. Obviously the turnovers hurt and Emini here. I just kind of, I take all the blame for that Emini here. Just those early turnovers swing the momentum of the game. Emini here, they scored on the one and then they got a touchdown immediately after. So that's 14 points that I, I kind of gave them. And it's hard to come back from that in, in the Super Bowl. And so just didn't play to my standard. And I have to be better next time.

0:
Yeah. You also gotta credit the Eagles defense. Eagles defense was amazing last night. They weren't allowing nothing. They weren't allowed, they weren't giving him time in the pocket. They weren't able to run last night. Emini here, the Eagles defense was, was like no other. Last night they played, they came to play.

7:
Yes they did. Yes they did. And in case you missed it, a man that was dressed in all black that stormed the field during the halftime show, waving a Palestinian and Sudanese flags with the words Gaza and Sudan written on the flags that was not planned. So the NFL released a statement. They said, we commence security for quickly detaining the individual who displayed the flag. He was part, he was, he was a part of the 400 member cast. But the individual hid the item in his possession and unveiled it late in the show. No one involved was with the production, was aware of the individual's intent. So yeah. And then spokesperson for Rock Nation also said the act by the individual was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.

7:
So things like that wasn't,

0:
I wonder why they even discuss it or even talk about it. 'cause we didn't see it at home. I didn't see it at all. No, you

6:
Didn't see it at home. But it, it, it, it was everywhere

0:
Online after, after it was

7:
Its way around the, around social media. But IFI figured that was gonna be the case anyways, in regards to Kendrick's halftime show, because you know, he's very strategic. He has a lot of, oh my gosh, I like some blinking. He's very strategic. He has a lot of, you know, things that he put underline. So I thought that maybe, you know, that was part of it. But no, that one, that particular element was not part of the show. Okay.

0:
So, alright, well that is front page news. Thank you Morgan.

7:
Thank you. All right. Talk to y'all at seven. All

0:
Right. Everybody else get it off your chest. 805 8 5 1 0 5 1. How was your weekend? Let's talk Super Bowl. What did you do? What did you think? Did you like the performance? Did you hate the performance? Was it just mid? Let's discuss, how did you think about the game? Call us up right now. We would love to know what you did this weekend. 805. 8 5 1 0 5 1 is The Breakfast Club. Good morning.

12:
The Breakfast Club.

13:
Ray. Ray. Ray. Yo, char Man. Dany, what up are we lying?

12:

13:
I got an indoor pool, a outdoor

12:

0:
We lie. Hello? Who's this?

14:
This is Jay.

0:
Jay, what's up? Where you calling from? Brother

14:
Jay from Queens.

0:
Okay, Queens. What's up man? Get it off your chest,

14:
Man. Krick Lamar. Trash Super Bowl. Performance Trash.

0:
You didn't like it at all? What didn't you like? Break it down? What? What?

14:
I just felt like every song was very mid except the last two. The one he did with Sizzle was straight, but she should just played snooze afterwards because it was trash cut the jokes.

0:
Yeah, I thought, I thought it was a slow start. But I will say this. You said you didn't like the songs or you didn't know the songs? Or what's the reason why you said

14:
I knew some of 'em, but I just Emini here. I know everybody like Kendrick now, but I just don't feel like he got the catalog to get people to be moving the way they need to be moving.

0:
Okay,

6:
So you felt like it just wasn't upbeat, you wanted to dance a little bit more?

14:
Yeah, Emini here. My house was basically sweeping man, like waking it up. And so he did not like the live up, but it was too much into it, but it was trash.

0:
Okay. Thank you Jay.

14:
Alright.

0:
Hello, who's this?

14:
Kenny.

0:
Hey Kenny. Good morning.

14:
Good morning. Good morning. Breakfast Club. Good morning guys.

0:
Get it off your chest. Kenny.

14:
You know, I just want to say, man, they Eagles. One man. Eagles one. Come on. Come on, Charlamagne. Come on.

0:
Charlamagne ain't in yet, but ahead. Spell the Eagles. Spell the Eagles out. Go ahead.

14:
E-L-E-S-G-Z-E-A. Eagles.

0:
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds about right. Thank you, sir.

14:
Love you guys man. Love you guys. You know what it is.

0:
Have a good one, brother. All

14:
Right G. Hello.

0:
Who's this?

14:
Yeah,

15:
This is Spike.

0:
What's up bro? Get it off your chest.

15:
Yeah, yeah. I was my opinion on the Super Bowl, like, I think it could have been better. Was it okay? Performance? I just don't think a Super Bowl and, and it was a big stage. I think Young Money would've did better if they would've had a little pain out there and all he did for, and he could have broke out, you know, all the original people from Cash Money. It would've been, it would've been legendary. But I get what they was going with Kendrick. But I just feel like he should have performed his old songs and stuff like that and performed too much of his Hope catalog. Yeah,

0:
He definitely performed a lot of his new catalog. It was a lot of songs I would've loved to hear, but I would love to hear why he went the way that he went. I didn't think it was a, a, a one of the best performances I ever seen Kendrick p you know, perform. But I thought it was cool. I I still gotta give him a lot of props of getting out there and doing it and, and making show was good. He's not a dancer. So I don't know if people expected him to dance and flip and that's why. And the moonwalk, he's, he's a rapper. He's not that type of person. So I didn't expect that at all. And I also would love to tell people when you see them country singing, singing and they up there with a guitar and we don't know none of their music, but you know, their core still loves and supports them. It's just different. But, you know, I just, you know, I I just wonder We'll take some more calls. Thank you for calling brother.

6:
I'm like, I'm what did y'all expect from I expected what I got from Kendrick. Really?

0:
Yeah.

6:
Emini here. Kendrick is very, like, he has a, he's gonna come with a message. It's gonna be very choreographed and you gotta dig into it and you gonna be decoding it for weeks to come. Like, that's what I expected from him.

0:
I just, I guess I expected him to do other songs that I think were a lot bigger. Like if Pyrus and Crips all got like, that song I thought was big Swimming pools. What's the other one? Don't Kill my Vibe. Yeah. Good kid. Mad City. I just thought he would've did a lot of those records as well. But I'm sure there was a method to his madness. Get it off your chest. 805 8 5 1 0 5 1. If you need to vent, hit us up now. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. That's just me. I'm with the coach of Phil. Hello. Who's this?

16:
Hey, it's Destiny.

0:
Hey. Good morning Destiny. Get it off your chest. Good

16:
Morning. I wanna get it off my test about Kendrick Super Bowl, halftime performance. What's your date? It was, it was crazy from having Uncle Sam play Samuel Jackson playing Uncle Sam the dancers portraying the flag, you know, being built on the backs of blacks. It was amazing. Amazing. But hip hop and for the culture,

6:
And that's what I expected from Kendrick. So I don't under, I don't know what people wanted them to do. Like

4:
Why do y'all care about these people? You, you do understand that on social media, if you get outta your bubble, everything is 50 50. The

6:
People calling up here are real people. Every caller except for her, has hated the performance. Well,

4:
I can understand. Listen, here's the thing. I thought aesthetically it was

0:
Great. Think I thought it

4:
Was good. I thought aesthetically it was fantastic. The only thing I would've changed was the set list.

0:
Yeah. I didn't love the songs. Like I said earlier, people, I thought there was other songs I would've loved for him to do. But I'm sure there was a method to his madness and I'm sure we'll find out.

4:
Oh, I, I think the method was he just wasn't trying to be commercial. Mm. Like that. That's what I think the whole purpose. I if you wanna call it underground, I don knock underground. Kendrick can be.

0:
Hello, who's this?

14:
Hey, this is Mark from, this is Mark from Newark.

0:
Mark. What up man? Get it off your chest.

14:
What's going on? And we finally made it through. Good morning, Charlamagne. Hey, good morning. Not just

0:
Lauren.

14:
I want Lauren. Good morning Lauren. Good morning. I just wanna talk, I just wanna talk about the show. Okay, go

0:
Ahead brother. It

14:
Was trash. It was trash.

0:
Why you think so? What didn't you like? Listen,

14:
Like I said, the the crowd wasn't really into it until the not like us came on. Yeah.

4:
Let's be honest. Can I ask you a question? And maybe, maybe it's just me and I'm not making no excuses. I I'm just what Super Bowl performance was. The crowd into it. I don't never watch the Super Bowl performance and say, yo, the crowd ain't in it. No.

14:
Crazy. So man, they up. I'm asking. They up in the middle of the crowd. They, they they up dancing and everything else. Emini here.

6:
Nah, they came at Rihanna too though.

4:
For the

14:
Same, A minor came on.

0:
Now Rihanna, Rihanna was pregnant. Rihanna didn't give. She was pregnant. So I didn't expect a whole lot. Remember she was kind of, but

4:
No, he's talking about the crowd. I don't remember. And I could be wrong. I don

0:
I was crazy during Eminem.

4:
Eminem wasn't Eminem before the

0:
Bowl. Eminem, Dr. Dre. 50 cent Mary, JB

4:
I Don remember what the crowd was. The crowd was crazy to the crowd. I wasn't paying attention to the crowd. I don't remember, I don't remember any crowd more, you know, the only crowd moment I can remember Miss Super Bowl history, Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson,

0:
Michael Jackson

4:
Was going viral

6:
Yesterday before the performance.

4:
That's the only time I can remember the crowd. Like losing they minds at the Super Bowl performance.

6:
I normally judge it by just personally how I feel, like what I take away from it. But, but also where I'm at, like how people react. And where I was at yesterday, people was hyped. They did get more hyped to not like us. But I think people was just excited to see him finally on the stage because we've been talking about it for so long.

4:
Here's my, my only thing, once again, I would've, if I was Kendrick, I would've changed his set list. And this goes back to what I said last week or whenever I said this, I wouldn't have performed not like us. I would've just gave him the hook in the, in the, the Dan in the hook because it made it too much about Drake.

0:
I thought it was dope the

6:
Way he did it. No, it was all I thought he wasn't gonna perform it because of the way he was season it. I did feel like was he gave Drake too much. It was a Super Bowl. Like let's, it was Drake.

0:
I thought it was dope the way he did it. I love the tees and all that. The little, the little, you know, I don't know if I could do it 'cause they'd be suing y'all. I thought the whole thing was dope. I thought that that part was dope.

4:
I would love to see a Kendrick Super Bowl performance without anything to do with Drake and how, how, how much different his focus would be. How different would him and his team approach it if they weren't trying to know, put the nail in the c on Drake, like how

6:
Many people that were there and just how many people watching even they heard about the Drake and Kendrick beef. They're not really in it like we are. So I was wondering how that translated to other people. But then I started seeing articles of people being like we were a little confused because they don't, they know Kendrick by all the big songs. They don't always know, like they know not like us, but they don't know the back and forth. Well

0:
Get it off your chest. 805 8 5 1 0 5 1. We got just with the mess coming up. What we talking about?

6:
We do. We gonna get into the Super Bowl. We gonna break the, the game down the big moments. Of course we gonna talk about Kendrick and halftime. There's a lot to discuss.

0:
Alright, we'll get to that next. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. The

4:
Breakfast Club

0:
Morning everybody. It's DJNV Jess. Hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast

4:
Club. You wake up And I wanna go back to sleep when you head scissor Snooze. Okay, Emini here. God dang. This song playing for three years now. How, how long has it been?

0:
About three. Three.

4:

0:
Got about another year. Go.

4:
My

0:
God. All right, well let's get to Jess with the Mess with Lauren La Your

4:
Music is

0:
Real, real. Just Robin Moore. Just don't do no lying. Don't do,

4:
She don't spell nobody worldwide. Jess Worldwide Mess on The Breakfast Club. She's a coach. Lauren, Lauren LaRosa. I'm back

6:
And I got the mess.

0:
Talk, talk to me.

6:
Alright y'all. So the day that we've been waiting for Super Bowl Sunday went down yesterday, the Eagles beat the Chiefs 40 to 22.

4:
Why is today not a national holiday? We should have a day off the day after Super Bowl, Sunday

0:
After Super Bowl. My

6:
God, a lot of people, especially if you're from Philly, you took off work today. People were partying Broad Street.

0:
I'm sure a lot of people did, was

6:
Packed. Broad Street. Wasn't insane yesterday. So as the games before the actual coverage of the game started, you saw Michael Strahan a bunch of different people doing a walk down Bourbon Street. I see in New Orleans giving a tribute to, you know, the 14 families who had victims lost in that attack. They had the human jukebox, southern state performing. They did some booy tributes, they did some hot boy tributes. That was good to see. Legacy performed the lit, every voice and scene. You had John Baptiste out there as well too. Then the game started and you know, people filing on it. Trump was there. He's the first sitting president to, to attend a Super Bowl. He brought members of Congress with him. Speaker Mike Johnson, Lindsey Graham, Katie Britt, Tommy Tuberville, Ivanka Trump, Laura Trump were there as well with him.

6:
Jay-Z and Blue Ivy were on the, who

4:
Had to pay for their tickets. I was thinking about that. Did Trump didn't have to pay for their tickets? I'm sure not.

6:
There's no way Trump, you gotta pay for tickets. You don't.

4:
I'm just asking. I don know,

6:
Of course, you know, Ian Hathaway was there and her Eagles Green. I didn't even know she was an Eagles fan, but she was there and her Eagles Green, Kevin Hart, there was so many people there. Of course it was a huge night. But getting to the actual game, Jalen Hurts is now the fourth black quarterback to win a Super Bowl. Twitter was going crazy about that. He also took MVP home yesterday after the dominant win. Let's take a listen to him talk about a, after he was awarded the MVPP trophy,

9:
I think we had a focus group out there. Offensive was able to score points to take advantage of, of opportunities, you know, just enough to, to put points on the board. And then defense. Defense played they ass off. They played how they played all year. You know, And I, I truly believe offense wins game. But defense wins championships and how that defense has been able to play. It's a great testament to them. It's been a long journey. It's been a, a journey of ups and downs and highs and lows. And I've always stayed true to it in the end. And having this vision of just being the best that I can be and that evolving over time into this desire and this flame inside to win. And you, you, you don't do great things without the guys around you.

4:
The defense was Stella. Okay. Patrick Mahomes stunk it up. All right, defense, it leads me to believe that Kendrick Lamar is kryptonite the biracial men. Jesus Christ Emini here, Cole Drake, Patrick Mahomes. They simply don't perform well when Kendrick is

6:
Around. It was real bad yesterday and it was bad. Yeah, I was watching it And I was likes

4:
Was like,

6:
No, I'm not even a big football person. I was like, he, Patrick Mahomes did need like a, a a a spa day. He

4:
Couldn't do anything. They were holding his ass. He was a whole game

6:
Throwing interceptions smack. He

4:
Couldn't even yell nigga out of frustration because, you know what I'm saying?

6:
Well, speaking of frustration, they showed Taylor Swift on the screen literally for like a second. She was there by ice fight. Yo, they booed her so bad. Them English fans was not taking lip the stick. Listen,

4:
She looked at Ice Spice like, oh my god, yo know you did. She looked at Ice Spice. Like, that's for you girl. That ain't for me. She was so shocked.

6:
She was looking like, what? I'm like, oh, welcome to Philly. Welcome to Philly Taytay. That wasn't

4:
Philly.

6:
They said it was a lot of the Eagle fans that were

4:
Fans, a lot of Eagle fans in the building. That ain't got nothing to do with City. That just, people just don't like Taylor Swift. Lucky that's what story? Happy, happy. That was a major. I think a majority. They said the majority of Philly was in that, in that building.

6:
Yes. But then, you know, the halftime happened, right? So Kendrick Lamar finally gave us the moments that I think a lot of people were looking for. So he opened up his halftime performance and he had a big message. The black uncle Sam Samuel L. Jackson comes out and he's like, welcome to this is the Game of Life. So basically like what we watched Kendrick Lamar do was he set a kind of like a, a chess board and they performed in the Game of Life. And he gave us different scenarios throughout the Super Bowl halftime show of what he thought the game of life was.

4:
Let's just talk about it. Look man, the whole point of the performance to me was to not play it safe. The whole point of the performance was to not be commercial on what is probably the most commercial stage in America. And like you just said, Lauren having Samuel L. Jackson, his Uncle Sam out there telling him he should play it safe. And Kendrick Lee purposely not doing that. Right. That was dope to me.

0:
I thought that was dope too. I, I think the whole show was was, was pretty cool. Wasn't amazing to me. I didn't love his set. I wish he would've did other songs 'cause he had bigger songs and songs that I think would've been connecting. I think, you know, when you look at if PY Rules and Crips or The World like that song or swimming pools or wouldn't get my vibe. There's a lot of songs in text. I wouldn't my vibe

6:
I think Go ahead. I was gonna say, I think a lot of people are arguing about the settlers, but for me, I kind of expected Kendrick to come with a message. And when I saw Samuel Jackson open it in the conversation that I knew that they were about to have, I knew we was about to get like deep, deep Kendrick where you got like, listen, great.

4:
Yes, great. Aesthetically I gave it a 10. You know what Emini here, but I agree with envy. I thought his settlers could have been way better. He could have just picked bigger high energy songs than the ones he did. Well example, it was an unapologetically.

4:
American public university education that moves with you ultra black performance. Imagine if he would've opened up with black at a berry.

6:
He opened with like a freestyle that we had never heard before. Can

4:
You imagine if Black Blackett or Barry was the first song on Kendrick the Super Bowl and then he threw in joints. Like, all right, mad kid, like you said, envy money trees. Money trees. Yeah. Backseat freestyle. Mixed in with TV off and humble and squabble up. Ugh. He would've killed it. And, and, and, and if he was gonna do not like us, which I still don't think he should have done because he just gave Drake too much light. I think he had to. I don't think so. He had

6:
To. I think he had too and he addressed it directly. I didn't think he was gonna do that. He actually said, I wanna do y'all song, but y'all everybody's favorite song. But you know, they sue. I feel like love that. I was like, oh wow. I

4:
Love that too. I feel like between that euphoria and not like us, he gave Drake too much light. But if he was going do it, he should have did the last verse. Based off the theme of his show last night, since it was so ultra black, so unapologetically black, he should have did the last verse. And I know he wanted to get to the, a minor part for the crowd reaction. Yep. But to match the blackness of his performance, I would've just did the last verse. I did not even if he did both verses if he did the first verse and then that last verse time, Emini here. Emini here.

6:
He take the whole stage. Majority of the time anyway, he

4:
Could've took something out to do that.

6:
He gave he, he talked a lot about life and you know, America's being on the, on black people's backs. But people grabbed a lot of the Drake stuff. They were trying to say that his a train was for the A minor, but I I believe it's the A from the PG Lang graphic.

4:
Well they had, they had flags with that on that. Yeah.

6:
This is PG Lang's. Like this is their brand. This is their like logo. And because he had the His label. Yeah, his label. I'm sorry because he had that H chain on. People thought it was for a minor, but no,

4:
What the A got to do with PG Lang?

6:
I have no idea. But this is what's on their website. Oh,

4:
Okay. Yeah. I just did not want to hear Baca Chubs and party's name on stage at the Super Bowl.

0:
It's a dis record. That's probably one of his biggest records ever. He had to do it. You had

4:
To. No he didn't. He had to. He didn't

0:
Have to. I think he did. That's his biggest record

4:
Ever. It don't matter. Kendrick Kendrick is bigger than records. He didn't have

0:
To do it. And I think everybody was waiting for him to do that. That's a big song. And for people that don't know about the dissing and all that, they just like the song and they be, they not like us. They don't know it's a disc record. They just, you know, look at it as a

4:
Competition record saying he had to do it to debate I've been having for the past couple weeks. He didn't have to do

0:
It. He absolutely positively

4:
Had to do it. He's Kendrick Lamar. He's a public surprise winning artist. That's

0:
True. That's cool. He had to do that song.

4:
He didn't have to do it.

6:
He would've looked scary if he didn't. But we got a wrap up. He didn't. No, he

4:
Wouldn't have. We

6:
Could come back and bring this back

4:
Black. He wasn't last night, please.

0:
But let's open up the phone lines. We can discuss that. 805 8 5 1 0 5 1. When we come back, we got front page news, then we'll take your phone calls as well. Let's discuss Kendrick Lamar Super Bowl. What's your thoughts? It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. Wake up.

4:
Wake up. You're locked into The Breakfast Club.

0:
Morning everybody, it's DJ Envy, Jess, hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club along the rosa of filling in for Jess. And let's get in some front page news. Again, congratulations to all the Eagle fans out there. The Eagles beat the Chiefs 40 to 22.

4:
Thank you God for taking the Chiefs out of their misery. Emini here. I don't know, I could stomach seeing Taylor Swift on the field after this game. Hmm. I'm gonna be honest with you. I ain't want, you know, her and Travis Kelsey kissing. You know, I don't believe that whole he was gonna propose thing.

6:
Oh my God. I was about to say that. They say he was supposed to propose.

4:
Yeah, but nobody was, he wasn't gonna do that. That the, first of all, he would never upstage his teammates like that. That's a dummy internet father. To think that Travis Kelsey, a football player, would get on his knees at the end of the Super Bowl to propose to Taylor Swift. That would be that that would be ridiculous. His team would be highly upsetting at him if he did that. Well, I take away from their moment for, for Hugh and Taylor. Well that wasn't gonna happen.

0:
Congratulations to the Eagles and congratulations to Sequan Barkley. He broke the NFL single season Russian record with 2,500 yards, actually 2 25 0 4. So congratulations to him and congratulations. What's up Morgan?

7:
What's up is congratulations are in order for the city of Brotherly Love and Philadelphia Mayor Sharelle Parker. Well, she has a message for Philadelphia residents. Did she

4:
Spell it right?

7:
As celebrations take place, let's hear more from Mayor Parker,

19:
Please. Philadelphia, I implore you as your mayor. Do not climb light poles or anything else. I know this comes up every time we have an outdoor celebration after our Philly teams win. And I get it. But folks climbing or attempting to climb up a light pole or a bus shelter or really any structure for that matter, it can lead to tragedy.

4:
The last time, did you see they put baby oil on all the poles in Philadelphia? Yeah, they lubricated the poles. Last time there was that much baby oil on poles. You know where that was. Right? No need for me to out

7:
Freak off parties. The Diddy part was lot of, but Mayor Parker, she did make the comments ahead of Super Bowl 59. Of course this comes after tragedy. Stuck, struck, excuse me. Following Eagles NFC Championship win. 18-year-old Tyler Saba Hy a Temple University student. He died from injuries after climbing a pole in Center City. So you guys be careful out there. As you celebrate, please do it safely and responsibly because we want to be able to do it again next year, Ryan. Alright, so switching gears to more political news. President Trump, he is defending the efforts of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. In an interview with Fox News ahead of Super Bowl 59, which Trump was attending the government, he said, the government bodies like the US Agency for Inter Inter International Development, or U-S-A-I-D, as you guys have seen, are rife with waste, fraud and abuse.

7:
Now, Trump touted his administration's effort to reshape U-S-A-I-D saying a few good programs run by the agency should be turned over to new management. He's suggesting Marco Rubio, who is over the State Department. Let's hear more from President Trump. Well,

20:
We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that's going to places where it shouldn't be going. Where if I read a list, you'd say, this is ridiculous. And you've read the same lists and there are many that you haven't even seen. It's crazy. I think I'd rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department, let him take care of the few good ones.

7:
And by few good ones, he's talking about the programs run by that agency. Trump also double down on his aspirations to, for Canada to become the 51st US state. He also says he trusts Elon Musk as the head of Doge and has been happy with his job so far. He plans to instruct Musk to go after the Department of Education and the military next in terms of, you know, figuring out what's efficient and what's not. Lemme

4:
Tell you something, man. I was in Maryland over the weekend for my daughter's cheerleading competition. The amount of people, black and white, who came up to me telling me they may lose their jobs. All because Elon Musk is controlling how the federal government pays them

7:
Serious

4:
On here was, was, was, was scary. And I here Emini here, you know, I know there's a lot of things going on and people like to focus on, you know, a little bit of everything. But Elon must being in control of how the federal government pays people. And Elon must being responsible for whose jobs get cut and whose jobs doesn't. That right there is what's really impacting people. Black, white, it don't matter. That right there is impacting everybody in a real way.

7:
Yeah. So with that, you know, Elon Musk, he does have his hands in a lot of pots. So I will say that a federal judge has blocked Elon Musk and Doge from accessing the payment system used at the Treasury, treasury Department. Now a judge ruled on Saturday that only civil servants who need to use the system to do their job will have access to it. And the ruling also requires that any data that has been downloaded, I know you guys have been hearing stories about Doge and these young guys who are working for the agency using their own laptops and things like that. Well, any data, data that has been downloaded as a result of Doge infiltrating or doing what they're doing must now be blocked or destroyed. The order will remain in remain in effect until at least Friday. And yeah, this has been brought by 19 Democratic state's attorneys seeking to figure out what's going on with this situation.

7:
So yeah, Emini here, the, I'm like, I guess we're doing what we can, you know, people are doing what they can with what they, with what they can, what they can, I'm, I'm not sure this is what people are saying as you con continue to say, is we're, we're in unprecedented times. So we, I can't call it y'all, but I will say that National Security Advisor, Mike Walsh, he is defending President Trump's attempts to reshape the U-S-A-I-D. He spoke to NBC's meet the press saying the organization spends money in ways that don't support strategic US interests. And he claims it isn't very effective at one of its stated purposes, which is providing international humanitarian aid. And let's hear more from National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz.

21:
We need to realign their mission and line it up with the president's foreign policy vision. I think that is perfectly appropriate for U-S-A-I-D to be kind of tucked into the, to the State Department and better aligned with their mission. Rather than just spreading money around all too often only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors.

7:
Yeah. Well now that's even worse because Trump has put the funding freeze in place and the agency is attempting to put thousands of its employees on unpaid administrative leave. And what critics is saying in an effort to shut down that agency. So a federal judge of course, blocked those employees from being placed on leave after a lawsuit was filed by multiple labor unions. So that speaks more to what you were saying, Charlemagne, about how people are going to be impacted in ways that are very untraditional. And you might not see it coming. You may, you may not. So well. Yeah.

4:
Yeah. And especially being that, you know, Donald Trump and Republicans ran off, ran on dinner table issues, right? And they were saying things like, you know, you know, we know that you can't, you know, keep food on your table and the groceries was what he kept, you know, targeting. But now you making it hard for people. 'cause people losing their jobs. Right?

7:
Facts, facts. Well, let's switch gears and move out west to see what's going on in California. Former vice president Kamala Harris, she spent last week touring the Palisades Burn area in southern California. She spoke about the de devastation in Altadena and how it impacted generations of black and Latino families who owned homes in the area. Now, when asked if she had plans to run for governor of the state of California, here's what former vice president Kamala Harris had to say,

22:
I have been home for two weeks and three days. My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them. And most importantly, to lift up the folks who are surviving this extraordinary crisis and do what I can do to, to offer any assistance, even if it is a kind word along the

7:
Way. Yeah. So Harris met with first responders and LA County Public Works crews. Pacific Palisades is not far from her home in Brentwood, which was an in, in, in an evacuation zone at one point last month. She also toured the Eaton Fire Burn Zone in Altadena after arriving home from Washington DC on January 20th, which was also inauguration day. So, And I also think this is a great time for me to just go ahead and say thank you to Mimi for holding it down for me on Friday. You know, she's my LA girl and she held it down on Friday, did a wonderful job. So thanks to Mimi and shout out to her for that. But that's pretty much it guys. That's your front page news. I'm Morgan Wood, follow me on social at Morgan Media. Follow Black Information Network at Black Information Network. Download the free iHeartRadio app and visit us@binews.com.

7:
Y'all have a great week. Thank

0:
You, you Morgan. All right, well let's open up the phone lines (800) 585-1051. We've be talking about the Super Bowl performers all weekend long. We love to hear what you have to say. Call us up. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning.

12:
The Breakfast Club. Daddy calling my phone call phone man. It's topic time. Call 805 8 5 1 0 5 1 to join into the discussion with The Breakfast Club.

0:
Morning everybody. It's DJ nv. Just hilarious. Charlemagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club just as out today. Lauren LaRosa is filling in now. If you're just joining us, we're opening up the phone lines (800) 585-1051. Kendrick Lamar performed at the Super Bowl halftime. And you wanna break it down a little bit? I know we missed some of the audio earlier, so I'm sure we can get into some of that audio now. Yeah,

6:
So Kendrick Lamar performed and he opened with Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam with a message to the people.

12:
No, no, no, no, no. Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto. Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game? Then tighten up.

6:
And then after that, he actually got to the song that everybody wanted to hear him do not like us. He teased it, act like he wasn't gonna do it. Right. And then he went into it and took a direct shot at Drake.

23:
Ladies. Yes. Do I wanna make a move? I wanna perform they favorite song, but you know they love the suit. What song? Yeah, that song. That song. Oh, maybe I think about it. Know what? I slow it down, say, ladies do me this solid. Ooh.

12:
Oh, you done lost your damn mind.

4:
What do you mean they took a direct shot at Drake? Whenever you do it not like us, it's a direct shot of Drake

12:
About

6:
Sort of, kind of. But when he brought up the I wanna do the song, but you know, they like to sue. I feel like that was, that was a, that was another part, another shot of Drake. Yeah, that was another

4:
Straight punch. That, that's more direct than, Hey Drake, I heard you like him young.

6:
No, that too. And the look, the y Y'all saw the look, the grin when he looked at the camera and did, did this grin. Yeah, you are right. He been giving direct shots all the

4:
All year. The whole, I I still wouldn't have done not like us if, if, if I was Kendrick and you know, Kendrick is bigger than not like us, not like us as a moment in time for Kendrick. It does not define him or who he is. But I will say it's so poetic that this all started because Cole and Drake got on first person shooter saying things like it's a big three. But I feel like Muhammad Ali and you know, Drake was asking who's the goat? And both of them saying they big as the Super Bowl. No you're not. All right. Kendrick is all right. Kendrick as big as the Super Bowl. Kendrick did the Super Bowl last night and you know, at the end of the set it said game over. And I really hope it is at this point. You know what I'm saying? It should, it should be. You can't, you, you should never go past the mark you aim for in victory. Is

6:
The game really over though? Because Kendrick has the whole GNX tour and he's going to throw, he's gonna redrow the shots he's already thrown and I'm sure he's gonna pull some rabbits outta hats. Emini here. Serena popping up and, and doing the Crip walk was like, that was, everybody was like, what's the big surprise? He has

4:
Straight camera about s camera. I pinched him. If I was Serena's white husband, I would've said, look here, why are you out here Crip walking over your ex, we are married with kids. This has nothing to do with you. Okay

6:
Baby, she lifts up some sneaks.

4:
You still, you still got feelings or something like, you know, you like, like is there like a, a door still open? You need closure. Why you need to be out here? Crip

6:
Walking, the girls was going off, go off Serena,

0:
Jesus. Now see, I think it was, I think he had to do the song Emini here. It was the biggest hit of his career. He just won five Grammys. Every sports team uses that. The Olympics used it. It's one of the most popular catch phrases in the last two years. I think he had to do that song. I don't think he had to do his biggest song of his career.

4:
That's what, that's what bothers me when y'all say he had to do do it. He had to. This is Kendrick Lama. Kendrick has one of the most stellar solo catalogs of any artist ever. That's facts period. Emini here. Right? He's one of the most critically acclaimed artists ever. He won a pulitz surprise. He is not not like us. Not like us is a moment in time for Kendrick. It does not define him, but

0:
That's his biggest song that he's, he's done.

4:
But it does not define him or who he is. No. And I wouldn't, And I wouldn't just give my op in his minions that kind of love on that big ass stage. Like Kendrick won in every way possible. It's officially over and I'm glad at the end of the set it said game over because of this. And

0:
Then I also feel like because Drake sued and people said he wasn't gonna be able to do the song, I think it was a thing like, nah, I'm gonna do what I wanna do it the way I wanna do it. I thought, but

6:
He could, he did not say the word pedophile though. The

0:
Crowd did. Emini here.

6:
Emini here. Yeah, but he, but I'm saying if you gonna, if you gonna poke your chest out like that, it, it's to, okay, this is the first time. I'm agree with Charlamagne on this because if he was gonna poke his chest out like that, if you gonna do it, do it. If that's what you're trying to do. If what you're saying is what he was trying to do,

0:
Well immediately, he probably couldn't say

4:
Pedophile. I don't think Kendrick was afraid to perform the song at all. All I'm simply saying is when y'all say Kendrick had to do the song to me, he didn't have to do it. You know why? Because the reality is the message he delivered last night on that stage was bigger than any rap beef. What

6:
Message did you get?

4:
I got the message that Emini here, it's a lot of different messages, Emini here. The fact that he came out there with all of those black men and all those black men were representing was unity you. The American flag, right? The red, white, and blue. But even the way they were positioned on the stage, it looks like the flag. And to me it just looks like, yo, we are America. Yes. This country was built off the backs of, it's ours too. Us as black men. And I just love to see when black men, you know, uplift other black men like that. And I, And I would love to see what the Super Bowl performance would've been if he didn't have the Drake of it all on his mind. And even when you talk about the Sammy l Jackson part, that was just a a, a America, the black man in America, uncle Sam telling Kendrick, man, you gotta go out there and play it safe. But you go out there and show your as in front of these white people game.

4:
Right.

6:
You too loud. And and you brought your homeboys with you.

4:
That's right. And he went out there and he showed his ass. That's why I, I wish, man. Oh man. I wish Kendrick would've started it off with black of the berry. See, but oh, if he would've, imagine if you would've heard Black, black of the berry at the first song at the Super Bowl. Can you imagine? You

6:
Think the message went over Trump's head?

4:
I

0:
Don't know. I don't even know Trump was listening during that time. He might have been taking a bathroom break. But I also would say this, let's be honest, the reason Trump, the reason Kendrick was picked probably for the Super Bowl, was because of the beef and how big he was last year. And how big.

4:
I disagree,

0:
Not like us. Was that big that session.

6:
You, they went out not like us in the year that the moments he just had with this situation, he would've still been picked for the Super Bowl.

0:
I don't

4:
Think so. With Jay-Z and Rock Nation. Yes. I don I don't

6:
Think so. I don't agree with that. I don't

0:
Think so. With

4:
Jay-Z and Rock Nation. Yes. Kendrick

6:
Is Kendrick, he's great. But I don't agree that he would've had some without

0:
Not catapulted into another stratosphere. But let's go to the full laws.

4:
Y'all bugging. I keep telling y'all, and this, this is the pro, this is the conversation I keep having about Kendrick. Kendrick was Kendrick before this. Now did Facts, did he have a, a a a year last year that took him to another level? Yes. Yes. But it's not, I still think he could have did the Super Bowl without not like us.

0:
I disagree. Hello, who's this?

16:
This is Jasmine. Hey, good morning.

0:
Hey Jasmine. Where you calling from?

16:
I'm calling from Milwaukee.

0:
Hey, what's your thoughts?

16:
And I wanna start off by saying Happy Monday. Happy Black History Month, ma. Happy ma'am. Kendrick Day, ma'am. Happy day. You know I'm, I'm commenting on the same thing, char man, it's not often that I disagree with you. Why would you say that? He shouldn't perform not like us. He, it will be a lose lose either way. If he performed it, it's a problem. If he did perform it, it's a problem. And you also said that it was gonna get worse after the Super Bowl. So why would you say he shouldn't have performed his biggest storm of the year?

4:
What you mean it's gonna get worse after the Super Bowl? What you talking about?

16:
You said that you said it's gonna get worse for him after the Super Bowl get worse for the Felicity of Kendrick's perform worse for Drake, I should say. Yeah, course Drake after the super What you

4:
Mean? It's obvious why gonna get worse for Drake after the Super Bowl? So they

6:
Do not like us

16:
The stage. So why wouldn't he perform not like us? Whether,

4:
Whether or what's

16:
The logic behind

4:
That? Whether or not Kendrick performed not like us at the Super Bowl. It would've been bad for Drake. It's been bad for Drake since Kendrick won those five Grammys last week. It's been bad for Drake ever since Drake decided to file a lawsuit. Okay. Against the UMG because of not like us. It really can't get no worse for Drake. I know y'all think 'cause y'all see Drake walking around Australia with cowboy rain boots on and basketball shorts and a t-shirt that says wait till you see my penis pointing to his mouth. That's crazy.

0:
It was not pointing up. Pointed down his my That's what you saw

4:
Was an arrow pointing his mouth. That's what you said. And I was like, I couldn't understand why would the peanut penis in his mouth. This

0:
Guy's crazy. Hello? Who I

4:
Would penis be

0:
Up there? All right. Hello? Hello. Hey, what's your name? Hello, David. Hey David. Good morning. Talk to us. What, what were your thoughts?

14:
Good

24:
Morning, man. I, I thought the Super Bowl could have been better. Kendrick had an opportunity to, to send him real message and he kind of got a ball on that. You know, there's so many things going on in The World, you know, he's trying to promote peace, you know, he can promote a peace around The World rather than, you know, focusing on calling Jacob a petal in front of The World. You know, that's what kind of messed him up. He could have easily did something where it could have took a, some time where he could have had a bunch of artists come on from the past and dealt with a segue from the past to the future that've been kind of dope. You know, you could have brought Wayne out, could have brought, you know, juvenile out. That would've been dope.

24:
But, you know, he was more focused on calling Drake a pedal. And I think that was kind of like, it was forced.

0:
Okay.

4:
Emini here. I, like I said, I would love to see what the Super Bowl performance would've been if he didn't have the Drake of it all on his mind. You know what Emini here? And I, but I, but I aesthetically, I I thoroughly enjoyed it.

6:
Yeah. I didn't feel like it was forced. I think it flowed, but it just, I think that there, it was a room for a lot more. He

4:
Gave Drake too much light, like the euphoria and then the, when he stopped, what did he say when he, when he did the whole my song, Hey Girls,

6:
He said, Hey girls, I wanna do everybody

0:
Favorite song, song,

4:
Song. That's all.

0:
I thought that was dope though. I The Euphoria. Yeah. But I thought that was dope too, the little tease because people were waiting like, is he gonna do, what is he not to do? Well he teased that I thought that there was a bet if he was gonna do it or not. I

6:
Thought that meant he wasn't gonna do it. I was like, oh, that's all he gonna give him. And then the song came do I didn't, I didn't think he gonna do the song after

4:
That. I knew song if he would've, I think I, I would've loved him to do the last verse. Like if you going do, like, if you going to do that on that stage, imagine that last verse. Once upon a time all of us was in chains. Boy, them white people, they lost their mind anyway. But they would've really lost they goddamn damn mind. I

0:
Think you gotta, I think you gotta do the first verse too. But let's open up the phone lines. (800) 585-1051. Let's discuss. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning.

12:
If y'all talking about it, you know we talking about it. It's topic time. Call 805 8 5 1 0 5 1 to join into the discussion with The Breakfast Club.

0:
Morning everybody. It's DJ JNV, just hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club Long LaRosa filling in for Jess. We're talking about Kendrick Lamar performing at the Super Bowl. 805 8 5 1 0 5 1. Hello. Who's this?

14:
What's going on? It's right there. Far Beach County.

0:
What's up brother? Take us off Bluetooth for speaker 'cause we can barely hear you.

14:
Yeah man, I don't agree with Sag. Well first of all, good morning. Good morning,

0:
Good

14:
Morning. Alright. I don't agree with Charm saying that he didn't have to perform not like us because that's the sole reason he was there. Like, y'all gotta stop saying that know reason why got the, that that is the sole reason. So anybody was checking for Kim Lamar before that?

4:
Yes. Everybody, we, this is what I hate. This is what frustrates

14:
Me performance bro.

0:
I do think part of the reason why, you know, they wanted him to perform at the Super Bowl was because of the success he had last year. And that included not like, but

6:
In saying that though, you Just say wasn't anybody checking for

4:
Kendrick Lamar is a little Chris Kendrick Lamar.

14:
I'm not, I'm not, I didn't mean it in that way. I'm saying Super Bowl perform performance wise.

0:
Okay,

4:
Why? Why? Tell me why you don't think that. You know, Kendrick Lamar's last tour, the big step was tour was the highest grossing rap tour of all time for a solo rapper. And tell Travis Scotch Circus Maximus to the past. It

14:
Yeah, yeah. But y yeah, but nobody looking at those numbers when they looking for Super Bowl performance.

4:
What do you mean? But those are people, those are a hundred, that's, that's over 73 shows. Over a hundred million dollars made across The World. Kendrick Lamar got Mad Grammys, he got a public surprise. What are we talking about

14:
Man? That's, that's the type, that's the type of dollar you collect.

4:
So you telling me that people don't like Kendrick Lamar you telling me that before this hit, nobody didn't like

14:
Kendrick Lamar? My, now you twisting my words. Now you're twisting the words. Now tell me what the performances not would have not been better if l Wayne performed than we had six foot, seven foot Amelia Millie of, of, of performance by big timers performance by juvenile.

4:
Well,

0:
You, you can't, you can't go back and forth between and and compare those two Emini here. Kendrick was picked for the Super Bowl And I think he, he's well deserved all the, to perform at that Super Bowl. But I do think that, you know, his stellar year last year was the reason why he was picked for the Super Bowl and that included not like us. To me,

14:
That's what I feel.

0:
All right. Thank you brother.

14:
No problem.

4:
And that's why I debate this point so much. 'cause I can't stand you. Kendrick Lamar is only here 'cause they're not like us folks. Hello.

0:
Who's this?

14:
My name is Dun bro from Harrisburg. What up nv. Lauren, what's

0:
Up Dun? Talk to us

14:
Brother's going What's up man? Charlamagne's good. What you bro?

4:
Peace King. What's

0:
The word? What's your thoughts?

14:
Hey, yo, listen man on the the not like us thing, man. Like listen a lot of things what I, when I, what I'm, I hearing a lot of people talk about when it comes to that subliminally is that bro, when he saying like, not like us man, he, he, he getting back on the balls on the, on the level of he's from Canada bro, we, we in the US you know what I'm saying? So like a lot of people like dressing on that level. Like bro, you talking about this dude from Canada, like I, I was, I was in hip hop bro, I was messing with the game back in the day. You understand? Like I don't even see the fact that how anybody responded to him. 'cause bro, you from Canada homie man, you don't got nothing to do with hip hop. You see what I'm saying? We were never even responded to that dude out, out of respect for hip hop. We shouldn't even be talking to him bro, you from Canada. Like who are you?

14:
You know what I'm saying?

4:
Well, you know Emini here. But but you, when you, when you come into America and you know, you put your hat into this rap ring and you know, you ask who's the goat? Yo know Kendrick just answered the question like we're asking, we're acting like these biracial men, JRO j Cole and Drake didn't start all of this. They started all of this when J Cole got on first breath shoot and he said whatever, whatever about the big three. But I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali challenge when Drake said, who's the goat? Who's the goat? Who's the goat challenge big as the Super Bowl word? Kendrick answered all of those questions and swiped the football last night at the Super Bowl.

0:
He definitely did. And I think hip hop is about competition. It started about competition. Who's better than who and rapping

4:
Against That's right. It don't

0:
Matter where you from And I think no, not like us was the biggest competition or or Disc record or whatever you wanna call it. Ever the biggest. And I think he had to perform the last day

4:
Bigger than not like us. I want y'all to know that y'all do know Kendrick is bigger than not like

6:
Us. A hundred percent we're not, I don't think that I, I'm not arguing that he's not okay. But I I I do have a thing that I wanted to say because when Kendrick did the interview, remember with Apple Music, he was saying that he was really excited for the Grammy wins because it finally puts like actual rap and battle rap back at the forefront. Correct. Right. Yeah. So how do we criticize the show the way that, well for me, how am I criticizing the show the way that I am if he's saying that because that's his way of putting what he thinks real music and real conversation never

0:
Sit back is the forefront.

6:
Yeah. How,

4:
Who's criticizing the show though?

6:
Everybody is saying he should have did this record this record. People wanna dance, they wanna feel good, right?

4:
No, I I just think that the set, I I think the settlers could have been different just because he has bigger high energy records. And when I look at the theme, 'cause aesthetically it's a 10 across the board, just imagine if he starts off that show with blacker the berry. Just imagine. And if you gonna have a black ass show like that, imagine doing songs like aight. Imagine doing songs like a Mad Kid. Imagine doing songs like Money Trees, back Streett, freestyle mixed in with the TV off and the humbles and the squabble. Ups and the DNAs. That's all.

0:
Yeah, I, I, I think, I think I would've said, I would've loved to see other Kendrick songs. No doubt. I think he had to do not like us. I think what he did was great And I think people said well his set wasn't this, his set wasn't that just, just look at the amount of brothers and sisters he had on that stage dancing together. Absolutely. And unity, right. In different gangs and different hoods and putting 'em together. I thought that was dope Emini here at the end of the day. I think he did his thing.

4:
I'm a Kendrick fan though, so he's super served his fans, he's super served. The people who actually like Kendrick Lamar and have loved Kendrick Lamar before. Not like us but,

0:
But like I said, when every sports team in The World is using not like us when the Olympics is using, not like us, when it was one of the biggest catchphrases in the last two years, you just won five Grammys off of that. You gotta it before that. You

6:
Can't lead a Super Bowl or arena. Gotta bowl. Not here A minor be screamed. The way that he was screamed

4:
Before all of this, I said that he should do the horn da and then do the hook. Right, right. And that still would've been dope, but

6:
Oh like just let the crowd sing it.

4:
No, I would just did the hook. Did that and the hook. But, but, but after watching what his theme was last night, I would've did the hook, the horns, the hook and the last verse. Alright.

0:
But we got a moral to

4:
The story. They would've lost their mind hearing him say once upon a time all of us was in chain. Like they would've, that crowd would've lost damn

6:
Mind. Oh my god. And then he had the people in red, white, and blue just locked together and chains moving. Oh my god. That would've been fire. That would've been fire. And if the second verse would've been fire like that,

0:
I think he had to do the first verse too though.

4:
No he didn't. That's he he

Hey Drake,

0:
He practice that. That in the mirror? Yeah that was,

6:
I was like okay Kendrick, I see what you did.

0:
He practiced that in the mirror. Hey Drake. Alright.

4:
The moral of the story is simply this. Kendrick Lamar is kryptonite the biracial men. Okay? Cole Drake, Patrick Mahomes, they simply don't perform well when he's around NV.

Nissan:
You might need not need to go around in Kendrick no time soon. You'll probably Faint. I'm not biracial sir. I'm fully black. I'm not fully Dominican. I am fully BLAC Fully Dominican. Black, black, black, black, black. We have justice the mess with Long Lewis coming up. We Do have you say B-L-O-C-K. No I I said BLA. You can't even spell it. I said B-L-A-C-K. I ain't, I ain't from Philly. I can spell my word. I'm so concerned Lauren Because I'm just, I don't know what's happening today. And then Drake Emini here. Kendrick been getting at people. I'm trying to make sure you are heard. I'm good. I'm black. Alright. Spell it. Are you black? You stop playing with me. Do you have a man? Dang that was, How did we get here? That was nothing. We always go there. Had Nothing to do with nothing Like what? Couple days' from Valenti Day. Stop putting me on the spot. All right, what was you asking me? Just with the mess coming up. What we talking about? We do. We have just with the mess coming up and Cardi BI know she was out and about running around for the Super Bowl, but there's some things going on with her offset and maybe a Stefon Diggs we might need to talk about. All right, we'll get into that. Next. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. Morning everybody. We are The Breakfast Club. Let's get to just with the mess with Laura. A Rosa News is real weather. This is Ari's, Jessica, Robin Moore. Just don't do no lying, just she don't spare nobody Bro. Why Jess World mess On The Breakfast Club. She's a coach suit. Lauren, Lauren LaRosa. I'm back And I got the mess. Talk to me. Okay, so Super Bowl stuff kind of, sort of still over the weekend there was a video that started going viral of Offset over in New Orleans And I know he's there having a good time and fans were just being funny. He was riding in a black SUV and his head is like out the window. I think he's kind of like trying to direct his cards where he's trying to get to and people like look up Offset in New Orleans looking for Cardi. And the reason why this, the reason why this came up is because right before everybody went to the Super Bowl weekend, Cardi B was out and about in New York and she was at, you know, the girls love karaoke. For anyone that doesn't live here in New York, that is a karaoke night that happens weekly where Rihanna recently was and it went viral. So a lot of the big name talent go go there now. And I have a good time. And she was there. She was in a section and in her section and there, I'm assuming with her was Stefan Diggs. Now a few months ago there were rumors that Stefan Diggs and Cardi B were dating. So of course them being there together went crazy. It was, you know, everywhere. And there's no confirmation of if they actually came together or if they left together, if they just happen to both be there. Because again, big names do go there and they're there weekly. But people kind of played into that offset video because of that. And then once those videos of Cardi B out prior to Super Bowl went viral, offset tweeted these couple tweets, which people are saying you know, was a subliminal to her. He said his newbie is batter. He, he's, he's telling somebody that he had them last week, by the way. So yeah, I I, I know they're both down there right now. I don't know what's happening but maybe Cardi B has a new boo. I don't Know. I'm not mad at Stefon digs. He fly too. Y'all hate the relationship stuff. What you mean? Y'all not saying nothing. I'd be so into it. I don't know what's going in and outta their relationships. Like we're not there. What We supposed to say? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Emini here. You guys take that step. You don't even know do y'all? I don't know, but I'm just saying I think that's Cardi and Stefon digs would be cute if that's where she's moving on to. I think that that's a little cute situation for her. We take your word for it. That's it. That's how you feel as a woman. Do your thing Lauren, as A woman, you feel do your thing. What We supposed to say. We agree. Yes, you together Y'all act like that. And because you being here, you being here Kiki with me about Wags and now you can't Kiki about card. Well Wags is a TV show. That's a reality show that I watch with my wife. I don't go into people's real personal relationships. But shout to Cardi B. I know Cardi B was out in, in New Orleans having a good time too. My son, my son, my son God, she took my son out one night and they had a an amazing sign. So if I come in here, card Toy Kiki about wags, I'm gonna change the first letter of Wags or something. The bags. I don't know What you gonna change it to Hags? Mm Well Lord Ah Jesus Christ, go ahead, continue on. Moving on. Kind of still Super Bowl related ish. Kanye West. He was still tweeting over the weekend. Do we have to talk about this guy? Sort of. Kind of. We do. So he was still tweeting over the weekend. Now prior to Kendrick taking a stage, Kanye tweeted and said that Kendrick needed to get on that stage and say Free Puff. Now I think that that would've been career suicide for Kendrick to do, but Kanye West believes differently. He also then began to tweet about r Kelly. He then also began to tweet directly about Elon Musk because there were a lot of people calling Kanye West out over the weekend because of the anti-Semitic tweets and things of that nature. And people were upset at Elon Musk. They're saying, Hey you have this platform. This is what you're allowing people to do. I, I thought it was ridiculous to see people asking a guy who did two Hail hitless the rain, Kanye Wesson. Mm talk about it. That's clearly he don't care. That's wild. The guy hit y'all with two hail hitless. Y'all have more smoke for Kanye than y'all have for him. And then y'all were hitting him up telling him to rain Kanye in. I think I saw that people were were upset at the A DL too for that, right? Yeah. Oh they jumped all over Kanye. Yeah, once again, it's ridiculous to see this guy do two hell hitless Elon Musk, but then y'all jump on Kanye but didn't have the same smoke for Elon. David, Kanye could, he could actually save free puff 'cause Kanye said he's performing the Super Bowl next year, right? That's what he said. He said he was gonna be there this year. Then he talked about next year Kanye had this little commercial that I don't know where it was. He said it was a Super Bowl commercial. But did y'all believe me now when I told y'all that Kanye West was clearly jealous of Kendrick Lamar's moment that he clearly wishes this was him when he actually tweeted next year I'm gonna win 20 Grammys and I'm gonna perform at the Super Bowl. I don't know what I believe 'cause I thought maybe it was a manic like he was just going into one of his episodes, cut or something cut out. But he posted a video saying that that is not what happened because he saw a video that also went viral over the weekend. Kodak Black was in the middle of the street eating chicken. Yes. Kanye West said Hold on Super Bowl talk relax. I need to go help my friend. Let's take a listen to Kanye West. I just saw a video of Kodak And I wouldn't want nobody to like do an intervention on me. That's why I wanted to put this video up. 'cause y'all might think, oh man, yay really going through right now. Somebody need to go get him or go take his Twitter and stuff like that. But I'm just telling you calmly I am in a good space. It's cathartic. I got my ideas out and that was very freeing for me and it was worth everything. It was worth everything to do that. So let's start there. Now I've seen this video and my brother Kodak And I feel a call and he's actually wearing this Donda chain. It's not just 'cause he wearing a chain, but it's like how he's sitting here wearing this chain unless something's saying to go and get my brother. And I thought about it before I was like, man, I should go down to Miami. Maybe I could be the person, I could make a difference. And that's what I'm about to do right now. What is the Donda chain? So it's a Donda dove. It's like a symbol that Kanye uses it. It's actually like a symbol separately. But I believe Kanye uses that for everybody. That's kind of like with his Donda team. And Kodak Black had a chain on with that symbol in the video where he's sitting down in the street and eating the chicken. Now fans online were very disturbed because it looked crazy. People, you know, always try to relate it to drugs. However, I spoke to a source close to Kodak this morning and he says that it was not related to that. He says that this was actually Kodak black shooting content for a larger music video that he's gonna be putting out. He said that he actually was on FaceTime with Kodak when Kodak was ordering the chicken. And it was nothing wrong with him. It looked Like random people were walking by and there was cars driving by. So Emini Here they are in the middle of the street. So cars are gonna drive By. I dunno if that was a, if that was a video shoot, there was no security, nothing. What they're telling me is that this was a video shoot. You do see a cameraman come into the video though and he's saying that that is Kodak's cameraman who always shoots some, this was for content no matter how it looked. It's, it's part of a bigger piece of content. So we just have to, I guess wait to see what that's gonna be. But Kanye West got off X deleted or got kicked off X and then went to go find Kodak. I don't know if they linked up yet. Imagine Kanye West showing up saying that you need help me. I was thinking the same thing about you. Let's go together, let's go Together. Let's hold hands and go together. Yeah, you're absolutely right. Well I don't know if he got, if if Kanye West got kicked off X or he.

6:
Oh, he's not on X anymore as of right now, no, his his platform, his his account is not there anymore. But I don't, I don't know if they, they actually removed him because of the tweets or if

0:
They shouldn't,

4:
He couldn't take it after the Super Bowl. Okay. Donald Trump was dead. Taylor Swift all watching Kendrick Lamar spike the football on his number one op Drake. He couldn't take it. Okay, the jealousy, jealousy and envy destroys from within. You do know that right? Kanye bus said he living good. He just gave game two Mayback. He worried about the Super Bowl. Please. So, so why he wanted to do it next year, Lauren, he literally tweeted that. He literally said Next year I'm gonna win 20 Grammys and I'm a performing the Super Bowl. If that don't scream jealousy envy And I wish this moment was mine. I don't know what does.

0:
And that is just with the mess. Thank you Lord. Rosa,

4:
Charla Bain, who you giving that down to man? Four after the hour, we need the city county building. The people who work there in Indianapolis to come to the front of the congregation. We'd like to have a word with them because we need common sense gun reform in America and this proves it. Alright, we'll get to that next. It's The

0:
Breakfast Club. Good morning.

4:
Don't be out here acting like a donkey.

30:
Ke high bitch ke high.

4:
It's time for Donkey of the day. I'm a big boy. I could take it if he feel I deserve it. Ain't no big deal. I know Charlamagne got gonna have some funny sleep. Say out his mouth.

You can

31:
Call me the donkey of the day. But like Emini here, no harm.

4:
Why is this on the front page of my New York Post and Donkey era with Taylor Swift? Oh my God. Anyway, donkey today for Monday February 10th goes to the folks who work at the city county building in Indianapolis. Now there is a man named Terry Sutherland, okay, who decided to perform a social experiment in Indianapolis. And the social experiment was to highlight the need for common sense gun laws in America. Drop on the clues bombs for Terry Sutherland. I love a great social experiment. Okay? I love, love, love, love, love a great social experiment. And I am two A all day. But I also understand the need for common sense gun laws. So Terry wanted to prove a point.

4:
And the point is that anyone can get a firearm in America. And when you hear more of the story, you will see that his point was proven. Let's go to ABC 10 for the report please.

32:
Tonight we're looking into a story getting some buzz. It claims a blind man was issued a concealed carry gun permit in Indiana. And it's true Terry's Sutherland was using his white cane when he came to the city county building in Indianapolis to get fingerprinted for the permit. He says he also spoke with several people who knew he was blind, but despite that he was still issued a conceal carry permit without an issue. Sutherland has no intention of using a gun. He says he went through the process to highlight the need for common sense gun laws. He says he sent letters to state lawmakers and he is not yet heard back.

4:
Round of applause for that man. Round of applause, Terry Sutherland. Now I know that a lot of people have a lot of negative stereotypes in regards to blind people. I say often that a lot of blind people can actually see better than those of us who have eyes. Okay, Emini Here we are at the point in our lives that we don't even believe if Stevie Wonder is really blind, okay? But let me be the first to tell you he is. And there's also a reason that Daredevil doesn't use guns. Y'all know who Daredevil is, right? Matt Murdoch. Okay. Blind superhero. New series Daredevil born against starting on Disney plus March 4th. This man once said in the comic books, he doesn't use guns because of the carnage that he could unleash on people.

4:
Yes. Dead devil because you're blind. Okay? I believe blind people can do a lot of things in this country, but owning a gun and driving a car, probably not. Good ideas. Do we know blind people that drive cars?

6:
Mm. Do they?

4:
I don't think so. I

6:
Never thought about how they get anywhere.

4:
You think they ride the dog? Huh? I just never

6:
Thought about it.

0:
Jesus

4:
Christ. Listen, Terry has the right to bear a can but not arms. Okay? And, and if he does have a CNI dog that CNI dog better be trained like John Wicks because if you shooting at everything the dog barks at my God. Oh my

0:
Goodness. Okay.

4:
My God. Alright, blind people carrying guns is like blind people driving an Uber. Would you get into an Uber with a blind person? No. Okay. Alright. Now, Terry said he spoke to several people. You heard the news report. Who knew he was blind? He came in with a white cane. But despite that he was still issued a concealed carry permit without an issue. Listen man, the reason you will never get common sense gun laws in America is simple because nobody has common sense in America anymore. Okay? And this story proves it. Some donkey of today just sell themselves. Please give the city county building in Indianapolis the biggest. Hee-haw.

4:
He said he wrote them a letter and they

6:
He performed.

4:
No,

6:
He wrote the letter.

4:
He said, that's what he said. He said he wrote them a letter and he hasn't heard back.

6:
Yeah,

0:
He wrote the letter. Like

6:
What if they sent the letter? You just don't know. He

0:
Got, they probably responded.

4:
That's all I

6:
Would say. Y'all need to call homie though,

4:
Because he said he didn't hear it back. I'm like, man, you said you were blind, not deaf. You might have got the letter back. My brother. Okay. What, what is this?

6:
Is that braille?

4:
What is this?

0:
What does it say? What'd he say?

4:
He said it's not a guy writing. Cut it out.

0:
See, I was gonna ask, but I didn't wanna be fab. Like, because how he know how to stay online and how to be straight. 'cause he writing

4:
Stop.

0:
Close your eyes and try to write it a sentence. I bet you can't do it straight. I guarantee you can't do it straight. That's I

6:
Can

0:
Close your eyes.

4:
They have heightened senses, guys. All right. I'm lying. How do, how do, I'm asking do black write letters. I don know. I just

6:
Wanna know, look what I wrote

4:
Because they used but I thought not straight. I thought they used braille to write letters.

6:
Emini. Here you seen it? You sounds so

0:
Stupid.

4:
No, I I thought I don't, they do

6:
Use braille. That's why I asked Was it braille?

0:
Braille to read?

4:
No, to write letters to. We

6:
Probably sound so I'm

0:
You sound so stupid. I I'm ignorant. Yes. All the blind listeners, I apologize. And

6:
Did you ask me could they drive earlier? Did I answer that?

0:
He did ask and we said no. Why answer that? And I don't know why you answered that.

4:
Well, it's okay to be stupid on this topic. I'll be dumb. Somebody be deaf and y'all be blind and then we'll figure it all out. We'll

0:
Figure it out. Okay. Jesus Christ. All right, well thank you for that donkey other day. Now when we come back, big Dan will be joining us. You know, big dank. She's a rapper from Detroit. Recently she was in the news because she's suing Lyft because the Lyft driver said she was too big to give her a ride.

4:
And it was crazy 'cause the Lyft driver was blind. So I don't even understand, I don't even know how this, I don't even know how this happened.

0:
We'll talk the big day when we come back is The Breakfast Club. Good morning.

4:

0:

34:

4:
Are you? Big Dan, how you feeling today? I'm good. Happy to have you. Thank you. You know, when we first heard about your story, you know, there was a lot of jokes made, everybody made jokes including us. But when I heard you as a rapper, I was like, you know, why not have her up here and have a, have a conversation. See if this could help something. Mm. Make make the most of, make the most of the moment. Definitely. Thank you. Absolutely. Where you from? Detroit. Detroit. How long you been

35:
Doing music?

34:
I've been doing music for a long time. I took it seriously in 2016.

6:
And you were in Deb's house as well?

34:
I was.

4:
How was that? On what?

0:
Deb's house. Deb's house

6:
Last time up, Deb. Oh, how was that?

34:
It was, it was good. You know, it was a learning experience. Experience.

0:
It

35:
Was okay. Did it help or hurt you in any way? Yeah. Like your music

34:
Emini here. I'm, I'm doing the same thing I was doing before. You know, it was okay.

4:
You don't wanna say the wrong thing. You don't want

6:
Moments on there. And I told I with you, like you, you were, you were really teary eyed And I was teary eyed. What did she, because her, was it like, what was, what was that about? Well, Deb,

0:
Explain what Deb's house is because people, yeah, so

6:
Deb's Deb is a show where she brings Deb NY brings Waka Flocka's mom, Waka flock's mom. You know, she's discovered some of the biggest in the best Nicki Minaj, a bunch of people. But she brings the rap girls on and she tries to coach them through building their careers. And then at the end there's one that she picks that she focuses on. You didn't make it to the end, but you were on the show. Yeah. But one of the clips that I remember seeing going viral from you was when you were breaking down, you were really upset talking about that moment. It just, what the experience. So I

34:
Just felt like I was put in a, okay, so a lot of people said I was being difficult, but I feel like I was put in a difficult situation. I was in a store that I could fit nothing, you know? So when I finally found something that I could fit, it was like, oh, that's not a boss. Take that off. You know? So I, I felt some type of way. But yeah, I just felt like I was put in a difficult situation And I was trying, I was seeing everybody able to fit things and you know, I'm getting frustrated 'cause I can't find nothing. I don't wanna make nobody mad. I wanna look good and stuff like that. So that's why I started crying. I was, I was a little frustrated. You

4:
Know, you walked in and you know, you said Chad was too small so we had to bring the part of the sectional for you to sit in and you said something, you said, and this is what I'm talking about, accommodations, right? Yes. But we live in a world that's not always gonna be able to accommodate people that are

34:
Plus us. But, but we should though. We should because we not all the same. I feel like we should. Like why? Why not? I feel like a lot of times people think that bigger people, obese, the F word people should just be in the house when it's like we not the F word. Yeah, the F word. I'm not, I know

0:
That you can't say in your house fat,

35:
You know, like, oh,

34:
I'm not saying that word. Yeah,

0:
We don't use word in my house either. I thought you talking about the gay slur. I'm like ho Yeah, I'm confused. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:
But I just feel like it should be accommodated. Bigger people should be accommodated just like we accommodate the LGBT community, you know, all those other communities. I just feel like we, we outside, you know, if we inside it's get up. Why you in, why you in the house? You should be doing this, you should be doing that. When we outside it's like why? Why you not in the house?

35:
I know a lot of times even seeing it like with like how Liz, although she's lost a lot of weight now, you know how it could be like some of the clothes that the f people wear, you know, with things hanging out and y'all, you know, try to, well wear things that the smart, I

34:
Don't the s

35:
People be

34:
Wearing. I don I don't live in a world where skinny people when the the F people. I don't, that's not my reality. I am a human being. I am regular just because I'm my side with my, my, like I said, I've been doing this a long time and when I said I've been doing this a long time, I've been putting on for people like me for a long time. I did a naked photo shoot in 2017. Now all the big girls showing they stomach, they showing skin. You know, we, the people wasn't doing it. We had porn stars doing it, but we didn't have regular people doing it. Now ain't doing it. I just feel like I'm gonna wear what I wanna wear. I'm gonna be cute with it too.

0:
You know, I think a lot of, I think part of it is, is like yourself, you're speaking up about it. A lot of bigger people don't speak up about it. Right. Mack, who's one of the producers up here was a lot bigger. He lost a lot of weight, but I didn't know all the problems that he had until he spoke about it. 'cause it's just something that you don't think about it. Like he said, he would get on a plane and it would be difficult, you know? Yeah, he, he said he would go to the gym. It would be difficult. But those are things that we just don't think about because I think people don't ever make it a thing. So the fact that this incident happened puts it on people's minds so you can tell what you have to deal with because you know, these are some of the things that we don't have to deal with.

34:
Again, the plain situation, that's not my reality. Anytime I shout out to Southwest, because they accommodate bigger people, if you need two seats, they're gonna give it to you for free. If you pay for two seats, they gonna refund you. Really? I don't have that problem. Like, And I didn't know that.

0:
That's what I'm saying. We don't speak about

34:
It though. Like last time I went to Delta, they said Delta charge you, you might need two C smell, but we're gonna let you get on this time. I never, no I never have a problem with my seating when I get on a plane, like I never have problems. Like when I come into a room, I demand my respect And I, and I'm sweet. I'm a nice person. So I feel like people respect that I respect you, you respect me. It's never an issue with me. Like the issue be when, when like the staring or the judging or you know, stuff like that. And then a lot of people will look at me and be like like, oh she just, she eat, she do this. She do that all the time. That's not my reality either.

0:
So break down the incident of what happened now for, for people that don't know, they heard the

34:
Story. So I was getting ready for my cousin's watch party, the Lions game or whatever And I ended up ordering me a Lyft. You know, it's like 15 minutes

0:
And you want Lyft all the time. It's never an issue.

34:
Yes I do. It was like 15 minutes away. This, yeah, the driver's here. I went downstairs as I'm walking to the car, he looking funny. Door's getting unlocked. I'm just like, hell you ain't gonna let me in your car. I'm like for real? So I put my camera out and it's like, why you not about to, why you not letting me in your car? Like I kind of peeped that that's what he was on because the look at me, I seen that look before, you know? So that's how that happened.

0:
And this is the first time this ever

34:
Happened the first time.

6:
And you normally order, 'cause I, I know one of the things too, people like there was conversation like, well she should have ordered a bigger car, like the XL whatever you normally order the regular cars. Yeah,

34:
I always order the regular cars And I feel like I don't have to order a Uber XL or a Lyft L. I feel like I don't have to do that. Like

4:
That same car was a Mercedes and it's the same car that her best friend has and she rides in that same exact car. Look Emini here all the time. Chilling. That's why when she saw that car she said okay, I can fit in now. Like big people know what cars they can fit in. Do that though. Do I can fit car? You got herself now. I got a, what do I got? You got L Lincoln. You got Yeah I got little pri I can fit in there. You can't fit in no pri.

34:
Yes I can. I could fit in there.

6:
I love you. She just told you that she

4:
Sat in a PT cruise and she was fighting. Yes. Did

34:
I was in a PT Cruiser.

0:
Yes. Now not the one, The World is cooling. And I know you got those jokes and everybody was joking you, but how are you? Because of that, because you know it, it has to be emotional distress. It has to be problems. It had to make you hit differently or are you thick-skinned person like

34:
I just feel like the thing that bothered me for real, that made me make that video because they kept on saying I got the man fired. I never

Charlamagne ne guy. We are The Breakfast Club. We just kicking it with Big Dank. You know, she's the young woman who's a rapper from Detroit that is also suing Lyft because Lyft wouldn't let her get in the car because they said her weight. That was her joint just talking and we're still kicking it with her. Charlemagne,

4:
You know, you compared your situation to the L-G-B-T-Q and, and a lot of people would say, well, L-G-B-T-Q people don't have a choice to be gay or whatever, but you have a choice to be plus size. So they want you to make better choices. Eat right out, lose the weight.

34:
I feel like what you mean

38:
Choices?

34:
I feel like I do.

38:
People

4:
Think they bo you're born, born gay. Yeah, I don you. That's a debate right there. That is. But, but for most, you know, let's just, let's just hypothetically say they're born gay.

34:
I feel like I do. I, I work on myself, you know, and when I feel like I'm getting too much, I try to fix it, you know, like at my pace, you know.

4:
Yeah. And we have weight specialist right here, but is there a weight specialist? Fix her mic. And

0:
What's your name ma'am? Stormy and Stormy.

4:
Dr. Stormy. Thank you. One time. You know, when you have these conversations with plus-sized people, it always comes up that, oh well everybody that's, you know, big isn't unhealthy and you know, some people just can't lose the weight. They're dealing with issues like, you know, she has a thyroid. What do you, talk to us about that.

38:
So I been Dan Provider for a little over three months, right. And she's lost 80 pounds. You your 80 pounds go look different from her 80 pounds. Right? Because she started at 3 5 80. So even with her being at 500 people be like, she's still not losing. But that's not the case. Well her thyroid makes it very difficult for her to lose weight 'cause her hormones is unbalanced. So when your hormones is unbalanced and they're all over the place, it controls a lot of things and it makes it very difficult for you to lose weight but keep it off as well. So I think for her, she, she's consistent because she done lost 80 pounds. Right. But it's hard.

4:
And, well, she's too big for surgery. I was gonna ask you, do you,

0:
Do you suggest surgery? So

38:
We're gonna try surgery after she, she has to reach at least 300. Yeah. So that's our goal. 300, get her down to 300 and then she'll do her surgery.

4:
I always Mac, Mac, I always told Mack I would get him the surgery, but he had to get to a certain weight. Yes. So once he gets down, if you wanna get the surgery, you know. Yeah.

0:
Yeah. What surgery would you suggest? Is it waste? So either

38:
The sleeve, the sleeve, the gastric sleeve or the gastric bypass.

0:
Now can the sleeve bust you? Sometimes you hear about the sleeve bursting.

38:
Yeah. And there's complications with those too. So that's why we are just trying to find a more safe alternative route. But we gotta get her down a little bit because you don't want all that fat around her heart. Right. And when she go into surgery

0:
And what is she doing to lose the weight? Like what's the procedures, you know, break it down for us. So

38:
She's on medical weight loss, she's on semaglutide. What's that? Which is sort of like ozempic but with milder side effects. So she come to our spot every week to get her injections and then she's on our weight loss supplement, which we formulated with the pharmacist to help her with her multivitamin and just keeping her everyday nutrition going.

0:
Now, now does insurance cover this or do you have to come out your pocket? 'cause that's another thing that could affect people as well. 'cause if they can't afford it,

38:
It's a lot of out of pocket. A lot of, a lot of insurances won't pay for it. So they'll wait till you get the high blood pressure, the diabetes, to pay for the medicine. So it's a lot of people who can't afford it.

0:
Dang. When did, when did you get comfortable in your skin, right? Because you wear whatever you want to wear, you don't care what people say. So when did you get that comfortable? I,

34:
I feel like they started

35:
When you did that naked photo shoot.

34:
No, it was before that girl. I just feel like when did you

38:
Make the only fans? Was

34:
That when you were comfortable? When I make the only fans, I probably made that like a couple years ago. But when I got comfortable in my skin, it started as a, a kid because like when I would get ready for school, if I had on a, a big shirt on or something, I would just look crazy. My daddy be like, you look good baby girl, or you, you beautiful baby girl. I look my mama be like, girl, take that off. You know? But I feel like it started at a young age because like I said, I, I used to get picked on. I used to fight all the time. So they made sure I felt good within myself. So, And I really started like popping outta my shell in college.

0:
And you said you got the only fans?

34:
I do.

35:
Only running up.

0:
They running up on the only fans, man.

4:
They,

34:
I don know. Y'all just gonna have to go.

35:
How much you make on know how much you making money coming at what you

38:
Making of what? Allegedly.

0:
Hey.

35:
Said, says stay outta my pocket.

4:
Has this situation helped or hurt your, your music career? Because I, I I don't want you to become a novelty big dog. I

34:
Feel like I am going wherever God takes me. That's right. I feel like if this was his plan, it's, it was his plan. I'm a, I manifest everything. I didn't know that it would, I would have to go through what I'm going through right now to be where I'm at. But it helps, it helped my streaming a lot of people is negative, but I don't whatever people gonna be negative, you know, but,

35:
And that's whether you wear skinny? Yeah. Medium or

34:
Yeah, they gonna talk about me when I get small too. But it's cool. I'm

4:
So you want to get small. That is the goal. Yeah. Are you worried that people will only identify big dank from her physical appearance and won't ever really take your music serious?

34:
No, 'cause I make good music. I make beautiful music. I sing, I rap, I write for people. Probably some people y'all heard, but I saw a ghost writer in your bio on your Instagram. Yeah. I write for sure. Y'all heard? I feel like I I am a great artist. Even when I get smaller I'm still gonna be Big D

0:
Did Lyft apologize? Did they reach out to apologize?

4:
He still growing.

34:
They tried to, but it's like,

6:
So they did try to contact you directly? Yeah. And you didn't wanna take the call? Why not? Because

34:
I don't, I don't want to, you know, And I, And I feel like y'all need to make change to y'all

4:
App. What do you want them to change?

34:
I want them at least to like, accommodate us. You know? I, I feel like we shouldn't have to pay more for Uber, Excel or something like that. And I also feel like they need to be checking they workers' cars to make sure, you know, they no wrong with the tires, it's not squeaking or anything like that. I just feel like it should be like, are you over this weight or you know, and they'll see you with a car, you know? 'cause we wouldn't have to go through that.

35:
Like in the app before you order the car and show all

0:
Does happen because a lot of people,

34:
They only show they face, they don't wanna show they whole body. Right. Did

6:
You, did you try to, after this happened with you, with Liv, did you try to, I guess for like the lawsuit or proven purposes, I don't know if this is a thing that y'all would do, like order the same car but via like Uber or something and see if they would treat you differently. Like

34:
No, it's 'cause it's not a game to me. I'm not trying to figure, I'm not trying to see

35:
Like play around

0:
Morning everybody. It's DJNV Jess. Hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club. Let's get to just with The Mess News is real hilarious. Jessica Robin Moore just don't do no lie. Don't do,

35:
She don't spell nobody

4:
Worldwide. Worldwide Mess on The Breakfast Club. She's a Lauren. Lauren

6:
And I The Mess.

39:
Talk to me.

6:
Well Rick Ross and 50 cent continue to still, you know, go back and forth about the big mech little mech BMF, that whole conversation over the weekend. TMZ did a story and in this story they clarified that Rick Ross cannot make a BMF movie if he tried to because 50 cent owns all of the storytelling, the BMF stories, TV and film rights. Now let's take a listen to Rick Ross and, and why this story came about.

39:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So look, I do want to do A BMF film because you've been entertained by a lackluster small budget series. Now it's time to do a big budget film. Which director? Shout out to my homie. F Gary Gray. Anine Fuca. What's up Tarantino? It's a lot of legends. This is gonna be big. I can feel it. I'm just talking. I'm just

6:
Now sources with direct knowledge of the existing contracts. Tell TMZ that 50 is a sole owner, as I mentioned of both the BMF stories, TV and film rights and nothing is changing. They were also told that 50 cent right now is using junior unit film division to get into the production of Tammy Cohen, who is the woman that we know was going back and forth with Big Meech, her life story to continue the next official phase of the BMF franchise. So something's gonna come BMF, we thought it was completely over, but there's gonna be another continuation of it. It it'll be involving her story. And that was the woman who was the friend in business, partner of Big Meech at one point. And she was she in addition to being BMFs, CEO at one point as well?

4:
Yeah. If 50 is is is ending the show, it would be hard for me to believe that he's ending the show just because he got issues with Meech and Low Mech Fifty's a very strategic person. If he's calling for the ending ending of the show, that mean he's already got something, something in The World.

0:
Well it could be, it could be because of that. But then he's, you know, pivoting going somewhere else as well. Because see this story, it seems like this lady was, I guess when Meech was in jail, you're not allowed to make money while you're in jail. So I guess she was the one that was running it And I guess she's gonna be telling her story. Yeah, so it could

4:
Be both. And and would this show ending be just on 50? I doubt it. There's a lot of different people that he would've to talk to about that. Especially at Stars. Other executives. Yeah. Trust me. If they are calling, if they called for the ending of this show, 50 got something else up his sleeve.

6:
Well yes, I agree with everything that you guys are saying, but I wanna say Little Meach has been catching all the strays in this because why would the way that Rick Ross has came at the show, like y'all have saw little budget lackluster that plays a part into the acting as well too. And it's like poor little Meat. He done got the text messages posted, now his acting is lackluster. He was just trying to, you know what, Emini here bring the groceries home for his cousin and get some money for his daddy. He came home.

4:
Yeah, Ross, you not just insulting 50 when you say that. Okay. You've been sold in the whole cast, the whole production. Everybody.

6:
Yeah. Well in other news, our girl Chloe, she's been having a good time over the weekend, her and Burner Boy were out and about. Okay, on a vacation. We seen 'em sitting and making music together. There were even some I love you Exchange.

4:
Wake up. Wake up. You're locked into The Breakfast Club.

0:
Morning everybody. It's DJ EJ nv. Just hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club Lauren LaRosa filling in for just it's Black History Month. What we doing today? Charlamagne,

4:
Listen, you know, every day during Black History month, my God B dot puts out an episode of, I didn't Know, maybe you didn't either. On the Black effect iHeartRadio podcast network. And today he's gonna introduce words of oppression like drap to mania. What is drape to mania? We'll discuss.

40:
I didn't know. Didn't know. Didn't know. I didn't know.

41:
Back in 1851, this guy named Samuel Cartwright, he's a doctor. Mind you comes up with this disease called drape tar mania. And what was this illness you asked? Well, I'll share it was when enslaved black people wanted to escape. Yes. Apparently wanting freedom was considered a mental disorder. Like, oh wait, you don't enjoy being beaten and overworked and treated like property must be something wrong with your brain. And Dr. Cartwright wasn't just joking around, he had treatment plans. Spoiler alert, they weren't great. His cure was basically you just gotta hit 'em harder because you know, nothing says mental healthcare like a little violence.

41:
But drap Romania wasn't the only wild word they came up with during this time. Oh no. They had a whole lexicon of oppression. Take chattel for example. That's what they called the enslaved people. You've heard of chattel slavery. Yeah. Chattel means property like a couch or a cow. Imagine being referred to as someone's loveseat. Or how about the term fugitive slave? That term was for people who escaped slavery. They made it sound like these folks were robbing banks instead of, you know, trying to not be enslaved. Then there were the slave codes. And we've discussed these in previous seasons of, I didn't know, maybe you didn't either. But these were actually laws designed to control enslaved people.

41:
They dictated everything where you could go, who you could talk to, even whether you could learn to read like we're already still in your freedom, but let's go ahead and micromanage your existence too. Oh, here's another fun one, man missions. Now these were rare because that's when an enslave decided to free someone thoughtful. Congratulations, you're free. Now go figure out life in The World that's been set up to screw you over. They also had a term, the task system. And that's where enslaved people were given daily assignments instead of just working from sun up to sundown. Yeah, people actually thought this was progress. It's like saying good news, you only have to suffer for half the day now.

41:
So why am I telling you all this? Because words have power back then. They used words to dehumanize, to control, to just justify the unjustifiable. And today we still see how language shapes the way we view people and history. But here's the thing, we get to decide how we use our words now. So let's use 'em to lift each other up to tell the truth and to remind The World that no one should ever need a diagnosis to want their freedom. Draped Romania. A word that I didn't know. Maybe you didn't either.

4:
I didn't know.

0:
Happy Black History Month. Everybody. Thank

4:
You to Bdo Man and make sure you subscribe to the, I didn't know, maybe you didn't need the podcast on the Black Effect. iHeartRadio podcast Network available everywhere you listen to podcast. All

Shout to Larry Murrow, shout to Toya.

0:
Shout to Cardi B, that that really held him down. So I just wanna say appreciate

4:
You guys body some Larry, I saw bar post about how New Orleans got the best food in The World and she was at, I think she was at Monroe Steakhouse. I think Monroe. Yep. And Emini here. Listen, best food and best accents. I'm from, I'm, I'm from, I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, raised in Mo Corner, so I'm a little biased. But New Orleans is, yes, it's New Orleans and Charleston for me.

0:
Yeah, not me. It's, it is New Orleans all the way. New Orleans got some of the best food, but

4:
Y'all gotta come to Charles and I'm not, listen New Orleans, a hundred percent Emini here. Yes, a hundred percent come to Charleston, South Carolina too. What's

6:
Your go-to dish?

4:
What's the go-to dish? It's a lot Emini here. You got shrimp and grits, you got different right dishes because you gotta understand like Charleston is, is heavy Geechee, Gullah, west African culture. So like it's, it's a, it's a lot of that. It's, but it's Emini here. It's definitely seafood. It's a lot of different things. Red rice. It's a lot Emini here. Don't worry. I love, I love how, I love, I love that about New Orleans, but Charleston is my, is the other one. But I'm from there so I'm biased. And also, Lauren, you got something coming up?

6:
Yes. So I know it's cold and it's snowing in New York and everywhere else you are. I don't know what the weather is, but looking forward to some good weather. I will be in the Dominican Republic Memorial Day week. That is May 22nd through the 27th for the Memorial Day getaway. It's A-H-B-C-U Black alumni weekend.

4:
All right, well you got a positive note. I do have a positive note, man. And the positive note is simply this and salute the Kendrick Lamar. I thought he did a great job for the Super Bowl halftime show. I would've, I would've picked a different set list, but I love what the show represented And I love that Kendrick never ever lets himself be put in the box. So I just wanna tell y'all this great quote from Adly Stevenson. Adly Stevenson once said, all progress has resulted from people who took unpopular positions. Always remember that all progress has resulted from people who took unpopular positions. Have a great day. Breakfast Club Bitches. Do y'all finish or y'all done?
