1:
Retired the wrap up? So do you have to do like, 'cause you gotta break. I mean the year's a little easier, but Right. It just, did he But do you do the wrap up still?

7:
I haven't done the wrap up since like 20. I think the last one was 2022. So two years. So yeah, like two. I stopped after like two years. I think I did the last one over like holes like Encore, I promoted it as like the last one. And then after that I just, I had a chill December. Like that song used to take up so much of my life at the end of the year, bro, I ain't, I ain't get to do Christmas shopping or go, You know what I mean? Put up tree, nothing.

8:
You gotta go from January. Yeah. All the way, like all the eventful things that happened. Oh you, you gonna have to do this shit. This shit is crazy. There wasn't only

7:
Tell shit. People say that every year though. They like, you gotta do one this year, this year. And I'm like, actually I don't. You know what I mean? Well

6:
Did you, did you and Uncle Murda have real issues over that? Nah, nah, nah.

7:
It was just like, it was just fun. It was, You know what I mean? Like, I never, I never ran into murder or nothing. And even if I did, we probably would've just looked at each other and started laughing, You know what I mean? Like, I know he a character and that's what he do. Imagine

6:
Beefing over a wrap up. Y'all shouldn't collaborate and do one though.

7:
That's, You know who said that First? Clark Kent. Really? Clark Kent was the first person that said that. And actually this year after, You know, clock passing And I, I did think about it. Mm. You know what I mean? Like that he asked me to do that, You know what I mean? And in 2018 I was super stubborn, still battle rap mode. I was like, nah, I'd never do that. But then after The clock passed, I actually thought about it.

6:
Y'all still got time? Y'all got y Listen,

7:
I just, I just ain't gonna rap as long as him. I'm, I'm three minutes in and out. Attention spans too short. Like murder

6:
Go 15,

7:
Murder gonna go 15 minutes. Like I'm, I'm, I ain't rapping that long for nobody.

8:
Y'all got 14 days left. That's

7:
What's up. He got 14 days. He

6:
Got 14

7:
Days left. He on The

6:
Clock. Congratulations too for being nominated for a Grammy award for best spoken Word poetry

7:
Album. Oh, thank you man. Thank you. What

6:
Is that? What's, what's I, and this is a stupid question, but to you as a rapper, rappers are poets. Right? What is the difference between poetry and, and rap? At least from the Grammy Grammy

7:
Perspective? The once you, once you take the music out. Okay. You know what I mean? It's, it's, it is poetry. You know what I mean? I, I feel like all MCs are poets. So, You know, the, the Grammy had it in a category before where it was a lot of other things happening in the same category. So maybe like a, a poetry album or spoken word album would be in the same category as like somebody reading the children's book. Yeah. And shout out to the brother Jay iy. Jay iy who won last year, Luther j Ivy. Yeah. He, he, he kind of advocated for it and, and let them know like, yo, this is different. Like we shouldn't be competing against Barack Obama reading his book. Like We Ain't Going, that's not spoken word. So he pushed forward to be hiss own category and now it stands on its own.

7:
And I got nominated this year. So it's wild. It's crazy. Who you going up

6:
Against?

7:
It's me. I wanna say Malik Yusef Omar Omari got one. I can't remember who else is in there. Omar Harwick. Yeah, Omari Harwick got one. Oh wow. Oh, queen Sheba and a and a, an amazing artist named Tank from my tank in Aus.

6:
How many, how many times have you been nominated with a Grammy?

7:
I got nominated once as a writer when we did the Nicki album, the Pink Print in 2015. But I think we lost to Kendrick that year. But this is the first time I ever been nominated as Mad Skills. Now

6:
You gotta say exactly. 'cause people gonna take that and like you for, ain't nobody ever wrote for me. So I

7:
Wrote a hook there. You you go, there you go. I wrote The Knight is still Young. I, And I did that with like Tyron Esad Dean. Like, it was like three of us. Nick Nicki write all her ball. Okay. All her boss

6:
Salute The Nicki did. Y did y'all win? Y'all didn't win that

7:
Year? Nah, we lost, I think we lost the K do that year. Kdot. So

6:
What would winning the Grammy mean for, for you?

7:
Oh man, listen, it would, it would change my life and just, You know, for the creatives in Virginia, man who are, You know, doing they thing and just pushing the culture forward. It like, we always talk about Philly and, and VA is being like the redheaded stepchild in the music industry, You know what I mean? But we collaborated a lot. So it would mean a lot, man. And this is probably my most personal project to date. I ain't never been this personal in my music And I almost wasn't even gonna put it out. Wow. And my wife was like, no, you should, you should really put this out. And I was like, babe, it's too personal. Like, I don't, You know how we, I'm like, man, I don't need everybody knowing my business. Like, so to be rapping for 30 years and then the first time I, I really get personal and vulnerable on a project it get nominated for a Grammy.

7:
Wow. Crazy.

6:
What made you wanna do a poetry album versus a, a traditional hip hop album? Especially saying that you was getting so personal. Right?

7:
I started it and when I started it, the first two songs was like raps, but they were so, I was, I was moving like, And I was like, I gotta slow this down. I want people to be able to digest it. So I tried it another way. And then once I started sending the song around to like friends, they was like, yo, nah, keep going. And the song, the album is called The Seven Number Ones. And it's about seven things that happened in my life that literally changed the direction of my life. So the first song was like my parents meeting. The second song was when my mom used to play music around the house. My first love, You know what I mean? My first daughter being born. So it's all first. And, and that's how the album came about is

6:
Irman Bernard is about your parents?

7:
My parents,

6:
Yes. You got your grandma featured on it.

7:
Yes. Which is crazy. So if I win a Grammy, like my grandma would get, You know what I mean, A participation plaque. Wow, that's dope. So to, to be at 97 years old, You know what I mean? Wow. So yeah, I, I used to sit down with her And I never knew how my parents met, so I would just had a phone and just throw it down and record her just so I could go back and listen to it later. And I put it on the album and it's like the hooks. So my grandma is actually featured on the first song.

6:
Isn't that the crazy thing? How much we don't know about our parents? Yes, yes. And they had a whole life before us, but we don't even ever sit down and talk to 'em about

7:
It. Yes, man. It, it was, it was therapeutic for me to learn because my mother died of a drug overdose, like a heroin overdose. Like when I was like 33 maybe. So it wasn't until like American Gangster came out And I watched it And I remember seeing them going back and forth bringing to work from Vietnam and my, my stepfather, I mean, my father went to Vietnam, so I made the connection like, damn, my father was the person who turned my mom on to that. Oh wow. And they died 30 years later, like to the day. So it was just weird. But to, to not have that, but then to realize it later. So yeah, man, it's a, it is a real thing. That album is crazy. It's, it is definitely very introspective and vulnerable.

8:
And then is it, it it is also very personal, the track about your parents because it's, they, how they passed, it's true that they both died from drug overdose. Yeah.

7:
Yeah. Both died from a drug overdose. And when I was little they were like, oh, You know, your father died from a heart attack. But then later on as I got older, like they was real with me and they told me what happened. So, yeah.

8:
And was this the most like emotional Yeah. Track to, to record?

7:
Yeah, that one and the one about my daughter, like, I literally sat, You know, I played my daughter songs all the time. Like, I posted a video the other day, like of her getting in the car And I wanted to play her the, the song. So I, as soon as I get in the car, I play her a song, I'm gonna play the song. She's like, yo, I watched someone play you something. She said, did you do a wrap up? And I was like, nah,

1:
Nah, she

7:
Wrap up. It's kind of a wrap up, but it's about you. You know what I mean? So I played it for, And I, I always got cameras around, so I had to GoPro and the Dash or whatever and I'm taping her reaction. And then I showed it to a couple of friends and he was like, my man was like, oh, you should do a video for this da da. And I was like, bro, this is the video. Aw. Like me and her sitting in the car listening to how I, because I was scared when I first, I was 19 about the fatherhood record. Yeah. I was 19, I was 19 years old. I was scared. I didn't know what to do. You know what I mean? So to see her now as an adult and, and to be able to flourish in life, that's all you want for your kids. How old is she? She's 31 now. She's 31. Yeah. So we sat in there called Man, and I'm, I'm gonna cry here, I'm gonna cry about my kids. So as soon as the glasses came up, everybody was like, oh, I know you about to cry. And I'm like, man, listen, if it's something I'm gonna cry about, it's gonna be my kids.

7:
Right, right, right. You know

1:
What I mean? Do you have those conversations with your daughter that you never had with your parents about? Yes. You do have those kind.

7:
Yes. And, And I try to make sure that my kids know things about my life. And early on in my life, I wasn't perfect. I was a mistake. I made mistakes. I was a young father. But to be able to move forward and learn from those mistakes, those are things that help me in my life. Now.

1:
Those mean a lot. 'cause I, I do that with my kids. So I try to talk about everything that happened. Especially my parents are still alive. But like if you talk about, I don't even know how my parents met.

7:
Right. Gotta find out.

1:
Think about like, I just didn't think about it, but my kids know that, You know, whatever. It's how

7:
You and how you and your wife. Yeah, that's right.

8:
Do you take it more personal when people critique tracks like this that are so personal to you

7:
As opposed to No, not really. I mean, once you put art into The World, it's gonna get critiqued. You know what I mean? Period. I always felt like whatever it is, once you put a song out, people have the option to either say, yo, that's fire, that's trash. You know what I mean? But for me, this project has been able to connect with people in a way that a lot, a lot of my rap albums never did. 'cause people are like, yo, I listened to your project And I thought about my number ones. Like, You know what I mean? Like, like you thinking about the first time you started DJing or you thinking about, I want to be on radio, I wanna be a comedian. You know what I mean? Like those moments stick with us. Like I could ask you, like I could ask all y'all, yo what you was doing like November 9th, 1994, you probably like, I don't remember. And I'd be like, yo, where was you the first time you heard Matic and you back?

7:
Yo, I was in my man car. It was high school, You know what I mean? You, the music attaches to the memory.

8:
I mean, I was two years old so I don't know what I was doing. I was probably, yeah,

7:
You probably someone with a bottle. You know what

6:
I'm saying? Yeah. I definitely remember the first time I was where I heard Illmatic. That was a good question from just though because it's like somebody, it's different. Somebody be like, yo, that remember But no whack yo. Right?

7:
Yeah. Nah, yeah, nah, what you talking about?

6:
I get it.

7:
It was and that's the reason why you can't dive too deep into the comic in this. Yeah, I definitely saw somebody. Yeah. It was kind of corny and I'm like, all right, cool. It ain't for you. You know what I mean? But for me it was super therapeutic. And

1:
I was gonna say, do you still ghosts?

7:
Right. Not as much as I used to. Just 'cause the music now is a little different. I mean, I can get in that bag easy, but the calls don't come as much from the younger artists 'cause they want to keep all of they publishing and all of they, You know, I still get calls from some of the OGs, but, You know, I just, I mean, put the pen to the paper, how

6:
You ever, you ever have ideas for artists? Like you see certain artists that you love and you like,

7:
Of course I'm like, I I I have songs and I'll be like, yo, like I have, I have songs like Complete verses and Hooks and I'll be like, yo, this would be perfect on this person. This would be perfect on this person. But sometimes we don't have the same vision, so I hold on to songs a lot and just sit on 'em and, and You know, we just, we just do what we do. But I never want to die with the art in me or stuff on a hard drive. You know what I mean? I wanna put it out.

1:
I was gonna ask, You know, with all the writing that you've done, how lucrative is publishing? Did you get all the publishing that was deserved? Or a lot of times they just gave you a, a check and say you're not getting none of that publishing

7:
In the beginning. Do you eat off of it still? I mean, yeah. Yeah. In the beginning most of it was like, You know, quick little bags here. You know what I mean? Brown paper bag money. Then I learned about publishing later and how lucrative that could be. But I never did a publishing deal. So for me, I always, I always was able to wait for my money. Like nobody was able to dangle, You know what I mean? A couple hundred thousand in front of me. And I'm like, I gotta get that now. 'cause I'm like, I could wait six months for mine. You know what I mean? 'cause when it, when it come, I know it's gonna be more than that. And there's so many stipulations on publishing now and this, that, and the third. So I'm like, man, I don I don't really want to, You know what I mean? I never really wanted to wait, wait, like take a loan from them and then just have to deal with the paying them back. Right. So I'm like, I'll wait for my bread.

7:
Mm.

6:
Is it still an unwritten rule that ghost riders aren't supposed to talk about who they wrote for because that it's, it's not taboo no more for people to

7:
Have writers. I mean, yeah, it's not really, You know, I don't, but You know what I mean, I, I never really revealed, well I won't say I never really revealed, but I, I I make more money when dating Ain't nobody talking about ghosts. Right. You know what I mean? So, and, and the people work with me. They know, most of the time I just ain't going to throw 'em out there under, under the bus for no reason. But sometimes people just know about it. They be like, oh, I know you wrote that earlier this year. I did a show in Virginia and actually performed a song that I wrote and then it was in like a McDonald's campaign like maybe like a month later. And people was like, oh, you wrote that? And I was like, I been wrote that. Yeah. You know what I mean? I

8:
Feel like a lot of rappers these days, a lot of younger rappers, they feel like they lose credibility if somebody, if they, if it gets out there that somebody is Ghostwriting for them. Yeah.

7:
That's, I mean, sometimes you're just in the studio and it's just help. You are like, yo, what if you say it like this? Yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? Like even like, like, like for instance, my homeboy kp k kp the great, he ended up on Kendrick's. All right. But only because Pharrell was like, You know, we gonna be all right. And he was like, yo, I think you should say it like we going to be all right. And he was like, really? He was like, yeah, it just sounds slicky that way. You got writing credit, got a Grammy like that crazy. He told how that as small as he just something as small as Pharrell saying it one way. And Pharrell being, You know, in sound mind and body going, yo KP told me to do that.

7:
He, he's owed some credit off that.

1:
I, that's why, 'cause most people wouldn't have did that, that one, right? They would've said, nah, I, I said, And I would've gave him a little check.

7:
You know what I mean? But, but, and that's the thing about it, to be able to be in a room and collaborate with your friends, You know what I mean? And make something dope with your family and your friends. You don't care about the credit because like, like Quincy Jones always said, when y'all start talking about money God leader,

You know what I mean? Just look at it that way.

6:
How, how did you get the opportunity to write Jay-Z's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in

7:
Ducks that came from Quest Love? He called me and he asked me it, it was weird how he said it. He, I just, I was in a barbershop. I picked up the phone. He was like, yo, when's the last, when did you stop listening to hov? I was like, what? He was like, when did you stop listening to Jay-Z? I was like, what you mean? He was like, I I heard you say before, like back in the day, like you would be able to hear Jay-Z verse or or line and you could just quote it like, when did you stop? And I was like, I said, maybe the last thing I might have checked out was like 4, 4 4. You know what I'm saying? He was like, all right, cool. I need, I need you to do your thing. But the way you do it, like wrap up style. But with like all of the quintessential Jay-Z lines, You know what I mean? Like I will not lose and You know what I mean?

7:
All of this stuff. So I was like, alright, cool. And he was like, And I need it in nine days. Wow. And I was like, wait, what? He was like, I need it in nine days. He was like, I'm about to pitch it to Beyonce. 'cause at first Beyonce was supposed to do the whole thing. I think it was Beyonce's idea to have different celebrities say different lines. So once I started writing it, we started going through the entendre of who would say each line. So that made it even doper for somebody to say a line that was, You know, textbook with them. So having like Will Smith say, You know, no more Big Willie my name, You know what I mean? Like those type of lines. And then even having da David Letterman say the CBS line, I keep one eye open like CBS that was the hardest part of the whole thing.

7:
And, and David Letterman was like, yo, y'all, this the line y'all want me to say. Like I just, it don't feel cool. And we like, yo, if you say this line, it's going to be the dopest line in the whole thing. And it was, and then to have Blue at the end, say the ghost writer line, like it was just dope man. And he hit me afterwards. He didn't have my number. He just hit me afterwards and thank me and, And I was just like, wow. Like you wake up to a text from Hove saying that was dope. Like thank you. Like that was crazy. You know, he didn't have your number. Right. He de 'cause he asked Quest love for it. Oh,

6:
Got you,

7:
Got you. You know what I mean? Like billionaire hove, I ain't had that number, You know what I mean? I had two thousands, 90 hoes, You know what I mean? But shout to Jay-Z man.

6:
Becoming Mad Skills. At what point, when did you drop the mad from your name? I

7:
Don't know. No, no, no. It's still mad skills. It's still mad skills,

6:
Right?

7:
It's still mad skills. I, around time when I was on Raucous, I was going by skills for a little bit, but then one of my partners told me, he was like, man, why you change your name? I was like, I ain't want to start sounding old school. He was like, fool Nike, don't change Nike.

6:
Yeah.

7:
He was like, they make, You know, they might make Air Max's Air Force ones, but Nike always Nike. And I was like, damn you. Right. So I just went back to Mad Skills after that. That would made em like 98, 9 9.

6:
And then it, it, oh, go ahead Joe.

8:
No, I was about to ask you about the, the documentary you dropped on YouTube. Oh

7:
Yeah. The nineties girl bru, nineties girl brunch. I did a, during quarantine I did a a a a like a A stream kind of like D Nice was doing. But I accidentally created a sorority of women that still stick together to this day through a stream, You know what I mean? And I made a film about it and put it out. And these are women from all over The World, all over the United States. And they still link up to this day and they call the brunch club and they just, it is just dope man to be able to connect people to music. And You know, what we was going through in Covid was hard, but, You know, people like D Nice and Jazzy, Jeff and myself, we was online DJing and those people still stuck with us. You know, he, he'd still do club quarantine, concerts and whatnot.

7:
So it's people that was attached to that and are still attached to it to this day. So I made a documentary about it. So

8:
It's artists,

7:
The No, no, no, it's, it's, I was just playing songs. Oh, okay. But the women that were on there, they, they accidentally started becoming friends. So now they go on trips together, they go to, You know what I mean? They go to New Orleans, the Essence Fest together's, like that's what's up like 80 of them, You know what I mean? It is crazy. So it's, it is a dope movie. I throw it on YouTube and if you ever wanna see the story, you can check it out on there. It's called Mad Skills in the nineties Girl Brunch.

6:
Why? You have haven't written any like TV shows or movies and stuff like that.

7:
Boom. Boom. So listen after the wrap up, You know what I mean? I, I'm chilling and I'm watching y'all. I was watching y'all and my wife ended up saying she was wanting to watch this show in this show called Super Cell. So we start watching Super Cell Dope Show and I'm looking at the show And I'm like, rap man. I was like, why do I know that name babe? She was like, I don't know, we watched the first episode And I was like, yo, this shit is dope. I was like, rap man. I was like, why that name just sound familiar. We watched the whole show And I kept seeing created and written by Rap Man. So I seen him on The Breakfast Club and I'm like, oh, that's the dude that did the show. Like, why, why, why? I feel like I know him. Yo, why Went and searched his name and he used to do the UK wrap up for like 10 years.

7:
So he was doing wrap up. I think he said

6:
That. Yeah, when he was up

7:
Here, he said that. So I DMed him And I was like, yo bro, I checked your show out, man. Like, You know what I mean? I think it's dope. Great work. I said, I remember you from back in the day you used to do the rap. He was like, oh man, skills. I I I bet your old shit, bro. I'm sorry man, I took your old shit man. I used to do the UK V Man man, it is amazing to have you in my dms. And I was like, yo, it's crazy.

6:
It's great that you put that accent on like that. Just

8:
Write to it. That was pretty cool. That

7:
Was pretty good. I was like, it's crazy to go from writing wrap-ups to writing shows. And I tell my wife that, she's like, yeah it is. And I'm like, so, You know what I mean? So I'm like, I definitely got some ideas. I pitch some shows, shout to like James Samuel and we got some things in the work Black Dog, You know, quest Love 2 1 5 entertainment. Like I got some, I definitely got some things that could make it a television.

6:
It only makes sense. I feel like that's the next, the next level for

7:
You. Yeah. Yeah. I got got like, at least three shows that I'm, I'm trying to pitch one. I've already pitched two more is like movies. So Yeah. Where'd

1:
You start DJing?

7:
Oh man, I was DJing when I was little, You know what I mean? I, I started taking it seriously in probably around 20 15, 20 16. I used to tour with Jazzy Jeff. So after that I always knew how to, You know, I always knew how to, You know, play records and, and Blend or whatever. But parties was a whole different thing. And I tell people all the time, like, You know, you can sit in your room and practice scratching, cutting, fading, but you can't practice reading the room. Right. You know what I mean? Envy can tell you that. And DJing is the one job where, You know, instantaneously whether you're doing a good job or a bad job, you play a song, everybody stop dancing, you're doing a bad job. So for me, DJing the passion that I lost in rapping, I found in DJing.

7:
So I started going heavy with it and, and, and just people like Jazzy, Jeff Clark Kent and Kid Capri was all of them was supportive, You know what I mean? So I just started doing parties. I've been, I've been doing parties 10, 10, 11 years. We just did a party homecoming, like a bunch of parties together. Yeah. Always. He always win you in va. So yeah man, I love DJing. I love it.

1:
I wanna talk about what has happened in VA the last couple of years. Of course I went to Hampton University and when I went there it seemed like you say VA was the outcast, but now I see everybody in VA coming together to make VA great from the fight to Pusha Tees Festival to Pharrell's Festival. So break down what's happening in Virginia. 'cause it's something I've never seen before, which I love,

7:
You know, all those years of getting overlooked, even though we have, You know, some of the greatest musicians and artists in The World. Athletes as well. Yeah, athletes as well. AI Vic, You know what I mean? Like, we always had a chip on our shoulder, You know what I mean? So, and, and, and it was never really unified. So now it's becoming unified to where, You know, we having festivals and we supporting each other, we writing records with each other, collaborating and, and just helping the younger generation come up. 'cause I, I want people to, You know, I want people to look back at Virginia and be like, damn, they stick together. You know what I'm saying? Like, so like on this album I got hella people from the crib, You know, what did Hooks did? Production. So like I said, winning this Grammy, You know, with my friends from the crib means more than I was like, I coulda got any producers, You know, I mean, I coulda hollered at some cats, but I wanted to do it with my friends and my family.

7:
So Virginia's always home, man. Like they say it's something in the water and it always will be,

6:
You know, it's drastic because Right. You had, You know, push in, in, in, in the Clipse, I mean the Clipse and Pharrell and the Neptunes. Yep. Clips and Neptunes. And then you had Missy and Tim Timbaland, Missy and Magoo. But it almost feels like in a lot of ways, va y'all they gave the sound away. Yeah, they gave a sound out. Yeah, because what if they would've just kept that sound with just va artist?

7:
I always thought about what if Pharrell and Chad had did like a, a Manny fresh, You know what I mean? And only rocked with my, my homies and my crew was only getting this vibe. Like Manny was just Wayne Juvie Hot Boys. You know what I mean? I felt like it could have been something special, but, and it, and it still grew into something special, but, You know, you can't tell another man what to do with it. But did they

1:
Try, did they try with clips and try a lot of it? And, And I don't think people understood the sounds.

7:
Right? It, it was so futuristic. Right. You know what I mean? When it came out like Teddy Riley didn't know what to do with them in 1993 'cause it already sounded like 2025 then. Yeah. So I think The World had to catch up with Pharrell and them sound and Chad and once they did, everybody wanted it. And you ain't about to turn down Brittany and Justin and Michael Jackson and You know, you're not about to turn down those production calls.

1:
Same thing with Timbaland. I think Timbaland was the same. Like his, his sounds was so futuristic he wasn't gonna turn down James nine Aaliyah.

7:
Why? You know what I mean? Why so? But Tim's an amazing dude, man. So andSo is in Neptunes. I love those dudes. Absolutely. Yeah man.

1:

It is. I still write, I still lyric, I, I still literally walk around with a, a book and a pen. Like I like to see my ideas. The phone is cool. Like I could put in a voice note or whatever, go into my notes, but I like to be able to open it up and see it. And when it's done, cross it out. You know what I mean? So for me, I walk around with pens and pads and things like that.
