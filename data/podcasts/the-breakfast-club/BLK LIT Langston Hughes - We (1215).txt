My name is Jack Thomas and you're listening to Black Lit, a podcast about black literature and the stories behind the storytellers Langston Hughes. Now that's a name that might conjure up some images of the Harlem Renaissance, powerful poetry and a voice that spoke to a whole generation. But before the accolades, before the iconic lines, there was a young man with a powerful dream, a man who was set out on a journey as rich and as complex as the poetry he PenFed.


I too am America, who wrote that. What you just heard was a quote from the great debaters, the award-winning 2007 film directed by Denzel Washington, where Denzel delivers a line inspired by Langston Hughes, I too am America. That single phrase drawn from Hughes iconic poem, I too published in 1926, still resonates today as both a declaration and a form of defiance.


It's a statement of belonging, one that bridges the divide between exclusion and inclusion. It is a black man claiming his rightful place in a nation that often tried to deny him. I too was written during the height of the Harlem Renaissance. The poem describes a plague that is racism. It is a poetic protest expressing how he as a black man experiences this outright discrimination and how despite not being offered a seat at the quote unquote table he does not fret for, he knows how beautiful he is and how such a beauty cannot be ignored forever.


The line tomorrow I'll be at the table, reinforces this belief that there is hope for America because he too is American. Oh, let America be America again. The land that never has been yet, but yet must be The land where every man is free the land that's mine. The poor man Let it be the dream. It used to be America was never America to me. Today, Hughes is celebrated as one of the most significant voices of the Harlem Renaissance. A poet of the people and a cultural architect and icon.


But who exactly was Langston Hughes? What experiences did he encounter? What was it like being born? An only child in Joplin, Missouri in the early 19 hundreds to divorced parents, his childhood was fractured. His father, a man who had dreams, he, he just didn't believe he could reach here in America, so he escaped to Mexico, abandoning Langston and his mother. Well, my father was very anti negro, although he was negro. And to add to that feeling of rejection, his mother, who was often absent in his life, left him to be raised mostly by his grandmother in a near destitute upbringing In this great big lonesome town.


I might starve for a year, but that extra day would get me down. In 1925, Hughes was busing tables in a Washington DC hotel, and he slipped a few poems to the famous poet Rachel Lindsay Langston Hughes was a hustler. He wasn't just a poet, he was a busboy, a seamen, a cook, anything that allowed him to survive while pursuing his craft. He wrote between shifts and during long nights determined to make his voice heard. His life was a patchwork of odd jobs stitched together by a relentless passion for storytelling, but it wasn't just about survival.


That hustle, that grit is what makes his story so powerful. It's why his work filled with themes of identity resilience and chasing your dreams finds its way into classrooms across the country till this day. But how does a hustling poet who spent his night scribbling down on napkins and diners become one of the most taught poets in American classrooms? How did Langston Hughes, the seamen, the cook, the busboy, transform into the Langston Hughes that we know today? The voice of dreams, struggles and resilience for students everywhere.


Langston had an incredible gift of seeing the beauty and the pain of life and putting it into words. His poetry captured not just his own experiences, but the pulse of a people. When he wrote about the rivers in Mississippi or the Congo or the Nile, it wasn't just as locations, but as the history of black resilience. Dream deferred doesn't just ask questions, it demands that you confront it. Mother to Son is like a warm, encouraging arm around your shoulder telling you to keep climbing, and that's why decades later, teachers bring 'em into classrooms.


Hughes was a bridge to history and literature, but also to empathy and understanding. His work wasn't just beautiful, it was teachable and relatable, perfect for young minds, learning about America's diversity and struggles about dreams and justice, about what it means to fight and hope and build. The language is rhythmic and clear. His ideas are timeless, but the words are simple enough to reach a middle schooler. He wrote, hold fast to your dreams. For without them, life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly.


You don't need a dictionary for that because you can feel it in your soul. As we explore The Life and legacy of Langston Hughes, we had the privilege of speaking with Dr. Carmaletta Williams, the current CEO of The Black Archives of Mid America, and a scholar with three decades of experience and a passion for Hughes's work. She shared a deep understanding of his life and gave historical context and insight into what made his voice so revered. Her ability to connect Langston's work to the broader black experience and contemporary conversations made her an extraordinary resource.


And we were truly honored to have her with us and to share this conversation with you. When he was telling stories in the blues genre and he was telling the story that the people who made him famous, that they were living. So he was with the folks he hung out in, in churches and as well as in bars, so absorbing all aspects of the culture. And that's what he wrote about the Negro Mother is powerful because it had so many people and they're like, yeah, my mother's story's a little bit different, but basically this is her tale too.


Now, through my children young and I realized the blessings denied to me. Of course, my mother was gangster's generation or after, but I saw those stairs. I saw that journey. Life for me ain't been no crystal sta. It's had tax in it. Boards torn up places with no carpet on the floor bare. So I think that he wrote about real life and that people didn't imagine. Plus he was in the time, he didn't want to take the art so far afield that the regular folk, the comma folk, the what Langston called the Negro lowest down so that they could feel it.


They could accept that. And then that was what made him famous. Now also we know about his relationship with white folks is that he didn't cater to them is even though he depended on people like the Godmother to give him finances and to get him published and to, You know, and he stayed in their homes, he still wrote his art and he still told about those lives. And so he bifurcated in in a means that he could operate movies easily in both worlds. And that's been said azura too, so we can get to that. But they moved easily through all kinds of cultures, but they stayed true to who they were, to their blackness, to their history, to their people.


And those were the stories that he wrote about Hug said, I want to write so that everyone can understand. And he did. That's why you find him in the pages of school books, inspiring kids to dream big, to ask questions, to see The World for what it is and for what it could be. He was an artist who refused to separate black culture from his art to him, jazz and blues weren't just background music, they were the heartbeat and soul of his poetry.


And that's what makes Langston Hughes so revolutionary and and enduring. He wasn't writing to impress an exclusive elite. He was writing to connect, to give voice to the hustlers, to the dreamers and the preachers who might otherwise go unheard. His words carry the rhythm of the streets, the posts of jazz and the soul of the everyday person trying to carve out a piece of The World. Langston understood that poetry wasn't just for libraries or lecture halls, it was for the people. It was for the mother humming blues while she cooked for the busker plane, a saxophone on a Harlem corner for the worker coming home late dreaming of a better tomorrow.


Hughes speaks directly to the human condition, raw, real, and most importantly, accessible, breaking down the barriers between high art and popular culture. We know where he came from. We know that he came from spare and meager beginnings. I tear up every time I read about him having to put newspaper in his shoes, which were usually women's shoes, that they had gotten someplace in the wintertime because they didn't have any money having to live with auntie and uncle because they didn't have any money and he didn't just say, okay, I'm above this. Now. Langton took care of his mother till she died, and in many places along that road, he had to do without to take care of her.


And he's a man who searched his whole life for a close relationship with his mother and died without actually having achieved that. So he knew what life was like, he knew what people were really going through, and he didn't discard it. It's like, yeah, I'm writing in limousines to the Met now. So he didn't let that be the controlling factor. It was always who he was at that time, where he came from and who the people were when it's not a mistake. I don't think that when he left and moved to New York, he moved to Harlem, You know, and he was right next door to the YMCA when he died.


He lived right next door to the YMCA. So that wasn't an accidental cycle. I, I think that was always his plan was to be with the people. And he talked about being with his people and what he could do for themselves. I think that we remember him now. We read him now because we still see ourselves in his work. We see our lives, we see our history, we see our families, we see our neighbors in what he wrote, because that's what he did. He took those ordinary people and made wonderful stories. He told their stories, he made up stories about them. And that's why I think it'll last so long and it's still lasting now.


Beautiful also is a sun. Beautiful, also are the souls of my people, of my people, of my people, of my people. This un universality is why his poetry seamlessly transitions into music influencing not only jazz and blues, but laying the groundwork for hip hop views, rhythms, cadences and themes can be compared to the verses of nineties conscious rappers like Nas Common and Tupac, who like Hughes spoke to the struggles and dreams of their communities.


His poems are the spiritual ancestors of rap lyrics, the original anthems of resilience and pride. Langston Hughes made art for the people, for his people, and that's why his influence endures. His poetry doesn't just sit on a page, it moves, it sings, it marches. It's very much alive today as it was in a Harlem Renaissance, proving that the rhythm of the streets is

You are listening to Black Lit. To truly grasp the depth of Langston Hughes insight, we must look back to a defining moment in his young life, A moment that shaped the lens through which he would view The World. Envision a young Langston now living with his God faring aunt and pipe laying uncle after the passing of his grandmother, although he loved his aunt and uncle, he was just 13, when his aunt brought him to church to get saved, he sat nervously in a church, in his hometown in Lawrence, Kansas, waiting it was supposed to be a moment of salvation.


Waiting, waiting a rite of passage into faith, waiting the congregation full of fervor and hope, waiting, waiting, waiting for Langston to join the procession of young souls saved by God and his aunt, desperately awaiting to affirm her hope. Waiting, waiting. Langston set palm sweating, waiting, waiting, searching. He wanted to feel something, anything that would affirm the presence of a higher power.


But that moment never came. Eventually, under immense pressure, he walked to the altar, not out of faith, but to fulfill his aunt's expectations and to end the spectacle. That night alone in his room, Langston cried, not tears of joy, but of profound disillusionment. He had been searching for God and instead found the weight of expectation and pretense. The walls were thin and his aunt heard his tears and assumed they were of glory.


This was a moment that would stay with him shaping his understanding of faith, community, and the gap between societal norms and individual truth. We know that story because he's hearing and he's hearing, and he's hearing that all of these children are all going to be saved and and he knows some of 'em are faking it 'cause they talk about it. And then when it comes to the point where he is the last kid sitting and this service is not going to end. If he doesn't, then he goes to the to the altar and he pretends to have seen Jesus.


And then that night, well, You know when he goes home, he hears his Auntie Reed and Uncle Reed talking, and she talks about how proud she is of him for having found God. And Uncle Reed doesn't care at all. You know, he's not that religious person. But then he feels so guilty because he had lied to people who had been so good to him. And I think that's the reason. And when he needed God, he didn't come to, he wasn't there. He didn't come to him. So I think that's why we see this mixture of emotions when it comes to religion in his work. Because we see those women that he writes about who actually retreat to the church because their lives, their personal lives are so heavy and they can't deal with themselves.


They go to the church, they retreat to the church, but we also see him go going to church and he has a good time. But he goes, but he goes to listen to the music and listen to the people, not necessarily to connect God. So we have then this split, this bifurcation of this guy who was raised in the people that he, the person that he loved most. And to Reid who took care of him and took care of his grandmother, wanted to embed this religion in him. And then him thinking as a child that God didn't come when I needed him. So what does he do with that?


Well, he keeps going to church to different churches. And somehow I think at times he was pretending just to be going for the music because he could have heard the music other places. But he also wanted to be in that community of blackness. This pivotal experience would later ring throughout Hughes's work. His poetry often wrestled with the tension between belief and skepticism, hope and despair in poems like the Negro speaks of rivers and goodbye Christ. He grapples with the spiritual and existential questions that define not just his life, but the lives of many.


He understood the beauty and the power of faith, but he also saw how it could be weaponized or hollowed out by human failings. This experience marks a consistent conflict that shows up throughout Langston's work. Later on, after visiting the Soviet Union and seeing socialism working, here are a few words from the poem, goodbye Christ, where Hughes calls for a rethinking of dominant American beliefs.


Listen, Christ, you did all right in your day, I reckon. But that day's gone now. They ghosted you up. A swell story too called it Bible, but it's dead now. The popes and the preachers have made much money from it. Langston Hughes searched for truth. Beginning at that church, pure was never about easy answers. It was about embracing the complexity of life, the struggles and contradictions that make us human. And in doing so, he became the unchallenged spokesman of the black experience.


He wanted to be with those black folk in the church. He wanted to share their life stories, he wanted to hear their testimonies, and he wanted them to sing that story out so that he could absorb that. And then on the other hand, You know he, when he talks about music, he talks a lot about the blues. And the blues, he says, are the stories of those people. The starts in their gut and tells their stories. And when he needed help, it was the people. And when he wanted to fill whole, he went to the people. It was the folk that helped Langston, the folk sustained him, the folk who helped him to reach his goals and realize his dreams.


So so for me, I think Langston's religion and his non-religion were all a totally merged into black life. This is what it feels to be black, and he wants to feel all aspects of it. Chalet dog darling, out of a dream Walnut tinted a cocoa brown pomegranate lip. Proud of the sound. Langston Hughes deaf poet. What you just heard was Yassin Bay, the artist known as most deaf reciting Hughes's, Harlem sweeties on an episode of HBO's Death Poetry Jam.


It's a powerful connection between two eras, but also transcends time where poetry becomes music, becomes culture, becomes life itself. Hughes wasn't just a writer, he was a witness. He documented the black experience in all its complexity, the pain and the perseverance, but also the beauty. And then like Harlem sweeties, he celebrates the beauty of black women. The laughter and the loss. He gave dignity to lives ignored, carving out spaces for those stories to be heard.


Many of my Poems are poems about the problems of American democracy in general as applied to race. Langston Hughes is one of the greatest poets to ever exist. I'm fed up with Jim Crow laws, people who are cruel and afraid, who linch and run Zion. The weapon of Lord formed against those. I prefer the law of mathematics over Jim Crows poet like Langston Hughes. The very roots of hip hop are in Langston Hughes work the flow of his words, the raw honesty of his storytelling. They form the blueprint for artists like Kendrick Andre, 3000 Black thought most def.


They embody Hughes's core sensibility to take the everyday struggles and triumphs of black life and turn them into art. Langston Hughes was a poet of truth. He didn't shy away from the tension between faith and doubt, between family and interdependence. In fact, has worked often peeled back the layers of social norms to reveal what lies beneath humanity. Langston it and just write about The World. He changed how we see it. He turned to Harlem streets into poetry, transformed jazz and blues into structure, and made a legacy that flows like the mighty river from the Harlem Renaissance to the beats of hip hop.


But before the poet, before the legacy, there was the revival from a moment of silence, a moment doubt. And the moment when Langston Hughes began to discover his truth, it was the birth of a vision, not bound by what should be, but by what is. You had to risk it all. You had to go broke. Now I can see what I owe Langs to what I owe WB dir what I owe Frederick Douglas. As my team And I were wrapping up the edit and final selects for this episode, we received word of Nikki Giovanni's passing.


So in honor of her, we end on a poem she wrote For links and Hughes Rest in peace to you both. Thank you for your literature, your art, your words, your poetry, and for your ancestral mentorship. We are grateful If I took a rainbow ride, I could be there by your side. Metaphor has its point of view, illusion and illusion.
