Nah, he said you But what, which, what year was that? 'cause remember they took my visa years ago. Like oh five. Yeah. That he might be talking about then. But they were mentioning that You couldn't come. That's what they were saying to you. That's why Cypher asked him twice. Like short Cartel. Right. He did. You did ask him that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But, but yeah man, cfa, that's my virtue now. I've known him for years. Alright. Nigga called me one day Cartel. How? How come We've been speaking for two years and I've never met you. Are you a myth?


How about Yeah. Shit was crazy, man. Yeah, but Cypher is a big on cfi. Right. But you know, in Cypher's defense, since I've heard of you. Yeah. It's like a myth that comes with you. Like it's, it's, it's like, I'm gonna be honest with you. Yeah. I'm, I'm other day hanging out with one of my Jewish friends. Right. And my Jewish friend told me, he said, it is in Jamaica. This is what he said that his friend said. He said, it is Jesus, Bob and advice And kfc. Man. I'm saying, Yo, Do you realize how many, how many people who love you?


Like, like every artist that I've ever interviewed. Right. I go to Twitter And I say, oh, I got this artist to call and to come. So you got questions with you. I'm not even playing with the fans because Yeah. Because they'll be all in, in my nce. Do you realize how, how popular you are? Yeah, man. Of course. Right. But like I said, I put in the work, you know what Emini here And I keep it real. Right. True. Like Night Joe. So I just sing my truth. Right. And people just like that about me. Right? Yeah. How was the Grammys Was amazing. I've never been there before. Right. You know what? Emini here and just got out of prison six months ago. It's crazy. I know. I'm walking the red carpet Blessing.


You better say Ross. No, I'm saying, I know we talked about Vibes Cartel, the name, but before that you were at Adi Bonton. I'm still Banton, but Ton is my favorite dance solo artist. Right? Like he inspired me bad. Yeah. I'm on Banton and Ninja are my two favorites. Right. I I got that written down. It was one time when you was Young Vibes. Yeah. And Buju grabbed a mic from you. Yeah. What, what happened there? Nothing happened. That's Chu Banton man. You know what? Emini here. Emini here. I was angry and happy at the same time. What the fuck? And in funny enough, he gave me one of the most profound, how would I put it now, advice in the industry because back then when I just came out I used to flow very hard.


You know what Emini here. Right. And a lot of times it, it went over people's heads. Especially the older fans. Right. 'cause I was just coming out and Banton was like, oh boy, your bud, what? I don to slow it down. Emini here. I said boom. You know, say that makes sense. Right. And that's when I think I found that that balance between the art, but commerce. 'cause you still need our our shit to be sold. Right. Right, right. We still need people to, yeah. So big. Got ton for that. But yeah. I'm still Banton Now. I'm gonna be honest with you. I seen a guy on the internet have this liquor. Yeah. And say this shit to be illegal. Dangerous.


It's dangerous. That's much so Dangerous. Let's, let's, let's subscribe to people. Which one is this? Oh, this is the ramping shop. That's the record. Where you got, where you were Spice. Yeah, me and Spice. Okay. 'cause we named each flavor. Okay. From one of my hit songs. Okay. You know what Emini here, this is my, no, this is the electric. This is dangerous as well. But my favorite one is this Fever. Fever. Fever. Yeah. That's More like the 63%. But it's smooth. It's like vodka. You say 63%. Yeah. Here on Your chest. Yeah, exactly. It takes you off your chest too. Shit. This is crazy man. This fever. But it's like, and then Which one is that one?


Oh, this is the unstoppable. Okay. And you can't let any of it spill. 'cause it's un mapable. That's, I've never heard of that like That. That's how dangerous this one is. So these two Right fire. This one. This one is mostly for the ladies. The ladies. Okay. And this any pen, anyone can have that. But trust me, I recommend the fever and the unstoppable. Cut. Cut. Tell me something. See how you just said unstoppable and un mapable since when you start being a DJ like that in your mind and you always play with your Lyrics. Yeah. I always play with words. Always play. You know this. Yes, yes, yes. You Know what Emini here, what age Since I was born, man. Like that's, it's also a Jamaican thing.


We love to rhyme. It's like every kid on a street corner in New York Right. Wants to be a rapper. It's the same thing in Jamaica. Right. You either wanna run right from the cops as well. Right. Or you do music. Okay. You know what? Emini here. So those are not the only thing, but you know ghetto style. Right? Right. Yeah. And the garrison, What is it, summertime in the port more? Yeah. That song. Yes. But, but can you describe Port more for me? Emini here, it's just outside Kingston. So it's not In Kingston? No. Okay. You got across the bridge. Okay. So it's like Jersey. I don New York. Oh, long Island. Yeah. Yeah. Long Island. I'll put that. Long Island.


Okay. Okay. 'cause we are still very much intertwined culturally and everything. Most people in Porter at the time, time went to school in Kingston. He worked in Kingston. So we are basically a twin city. Alright. And How was life? That's where I grew Up. How was life in Waterford? Rough. Can you describe that in any room? Emini here. I grew up like six of us. Right. You know what Emini here? Six kids. Six kids. My parents, we had to six of us in one room. Right. At one point on one bed. You know, ghetto lifestyle. Right. But for me, I wouldn't change how I was raised. Right. 'cause it made me who, who You are. Who you are now. Right. Tough, determined, unwilling to go back there. You know what Emini here. So yeah man.


Big poet for port more Empire with. And You said your uncles were inspiring you to do music? Yeah. Yeah. They were from Kingston. Right. So they used to come to my, my mom's house like on Sundays where my dad had this thing set up. Turn table, you know those final. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Of course. With the needle. Yeah. So, and they used to string the mic up and dj, they lived in Kingston Waterhouse, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's where I was born. So big up Waterhouse as well. So lemme just go straight up and ask you, who's the king of the dance hall Vibe? Scar up. Emini Here. Emini here. Don't get it twisted. Because you have to remember Bean is a legend.


Right? And he was king. Right? Right. The same way George was king. Now we have Charles. You know what Emini here, these things come and go just like life. We're here now. Few years from now, we are gone. So currently speaking. Right. You know what Emini here, I set by Billboard i's set by the fans. Rolling Stones. Right. You know what Emini here, I tell the king the numbers is there to prove it. As it relates to Dance hall. The love is there. Right. The impact is there. Right. The influence is there. Right. So you know what Emini here, what's more left to be said, right? One king. Yeah. And one thing I commend you for is you never, I haven't, I heard you talk bad on Beanie ever. You always pay respect to 'em. No. Beanie is a big inspiration to vibes cartel. You just Hit the Grammy, you just hit the Grammys and you still pay them.


Respect on. Yeah. That's my top five. I told you. Bounty, beanie Ninja Man Vibes cartel. Right? That's it. But I've read a lot of the comments and a lot of comments were saying that that's the reason why you are the king is because of your humbleness. Yeah. Like you, you could used that opportunity and said something wrong or said something bad about it. Oh no. Oh no. God is the greatest man. Right? Right. God is the greatest. But The old, you wouldn't have been like that. No. You right. You know Emini here. But you know what, Emini here, you live and you learn. Right? You want some fever. Huh? You want some fever? You want some? Oh, You're offering me my own liquor.


But I need a cup though. We Hook you up. We hook with ice. Whatever. Ice. Ice please. So Is this Something you have? White cranberry? Ooh, White red. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. Thank you.

Well you're taking it. Yeah. Keep, no, keep use. No. I like to see where my liquor Yeah, that's Right. Make it overhead. That's nice. I respect that Jamaican Man. So When you were locked up, what was the most thing that you missed more?


Because you, I was about to say recording or performing, but you got to record in, in jail. But did you miss performing Emini here? I didn't get to record. Okay. I had to figure out how to record. Yeah. 'cause I ain't gonna lie. Whatever iPhone you got is good. Five s. I'm good For recording. It's good for recording the five s. How Many albums you recorded in Jail? A lot. Emini Here we did, we did Viking, which is now re-released. Same year Anniversary. Yeah. Anniversary. Congratulations. Did King of the Dance Hall, which fever is on Right? That so gold, right? I did to Tanisha the album that's nominated for a Grammys. I did that in prison as well. Right. So, Yeah. But you don't sound like you in prison.


I'm trying to, like we were listening to this shit today. I'm like, how the fuck did you do that? That shit Sounds, let's figure it out. Remember, everything is a technique. Once you crack the code, you win. Right. So I started using my mattress like, you know that sponge they give you to sleep on to imitate the, the cushion sound in the studio Across the mic. Oh, sound Good. So that's how I, that's what I figured out. Yes. How many, how many Times did it take you to figure that Part out? A few years. Because I started recording like in 2012. And by 2013 I figured it out. Which Means you had a phone in there immediately. Yeah. No, I had a iPad, a small one. Oh, okay. A rectangular one. Remember those early ones from back in the day? I used to use that. Mm. Yeah.


Until I figured it out like 2013, then I started doing more, better quality songs. Wow. In terms of the sound. Wow. Now where's your favorite place to perform? Because I see you just booked Cologne, Germany, right? Yeah. I'm in Germany. Yeah. What's your favorite place to perform Outside of Jamaica? Let, Let, let, let, let me rephrase the question. Yeah. What's a place that you performed that day? You're like, damn. Who the why? Why am I here? Like a weird place? I don't know, man. Like, I embrace everywhere. Let me, let me think though. Japan 2001. Japan. Yeah. That was crazy. Nah, like They go crazy over There. Yeah. Yeah. That was crazy because like at the time, most of these, the internet wasn't around as big, so.


Right, right. It was crazy for me to go to Japan and was like, these people know my songs. You know what, Emini here. So that was crazy. Right. But since then, you know, we gotten used to it. Okay. Now, when you went to, when you went to trial, a friend of mine's, dear friend, I believe you went, had 12 days of trial. And I believe he went to 11 days. And I believe I, if I hear, heard this right. I believe on the 12th day they didn't let him in because they, they knew you was gonna be guilty. I'm talking about Busta Rhymes. Yes, yes, yes. That's my GI was with him in la La Yeah. Just did a record Right in the studio. Yeah. Yeah. So how, how's your relationship with Busta rhyme?


Describe your relationship. That's my g The first time I met him was after I did Best of the Best. 'cause remember I didn't have a visa. So I was the first artist to do best of the best from Jamaica by a satellite. You know what Emini here live. So he was in the crowd in Miami watching on stage and was like, yo, what the fuck is this? I Remember that. I was there. You know what Emini here, I need to know this person. So we came to Jamaica. Oh, so He mentioned Do music first. Yes. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. So he came to Jam. But we love bus rhyme. Right, right. Because, you know, growing up we, we found out he was Jamaican and he did the, he DJ very well. Raps very well. You know what, Emini here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, No, no. The fever. The fever. The fever.


Honey, you don't know the song Song. You fever, bro. Oh, know the Fever? I know. Oh, okay. Hell yeah. Thank you. Hell yeah. Slu. Yo man, lemme tell you something. World Boss, man, we are so hot. This is Fever. Let's do that again. Fever. Fever, Shante looking Fever. Fever, beer looking fever. Okay. Oh, so, so now if I'm a tourist, I've never been to Jamaica. Yeah. I'm a big Bobs cartel fan. Where do I, where do you recommend that? I go in Jamaica. For what? For, I don't know. Just be safe.


Don't come. Don't come. I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm joking. Jamaica is good man. You can go anywhere Emini here if you love Dan. So, and you wanna be in that culture with Cartel is from Bounty Beanie. Right. Banton. Movado come to Kingston. Mm. Come to Kingston. Kington, we party every single night. Right. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 30 Friday. Right. You want like a resort vibe. White sand, beaches. The girls with the little thing. You go to Montego Bay. Montego Bay. Yeah. But to be fair to Montego Bay, they also have a very powerful inner city culture. They got gun Mando in Montego Bay. Yes. I've never seen One. Okay. All right. Cool. But I will say this though, they have a very strong culture as well because they're the second city.


So, so Montego Bay would be, if Kingston were in New York, Montego Bay would be Los Angeles. Okay. They got, and they push, they have big artists from Montego Bay as well. The culture, the energy, you know, Emini here, dancers. Yeah. So Tommy Lee. Yeah. I brought Tommy Lee And I here have squash. He lives in Miami now. A host of All Man, Jamal the Dunman. So yeah, more base. And I is called Short Place too. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright. I've been to Montego Bay. Oh, you've been there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The resort part. Yeah. Yeah. I've been to resort part. My bad. I don't know nobody. Okay. So you, okay, Cut. I know we're all over the place, but I wanted to talk about Alliance and your, and your introduction to Bounty Killer and that in that part of your life.


Good Question. Oh, that was crazy, man. Like, I was in Port More at the time. So a, a dude that saw me on a show, a stage show, amateur Night. And he was like, yo, I know Bounty Killer And I can make the introduction. But them times as a, a youth from the ghetto, we was like, where the fuck, where do you know Bounty killer from? You don't what Emini here? Yeah. Like how you know him. Right, Right. Who are you? Yeah, exactly. Because at the time he was driving a Nissan, I'm like, nigga, how you Right. You know what Emini here. So it took us months. 'cause I was like, yeah, come pick me up today. Five o'clock. Five o'clock. I never showed. Right. You know what, Emini here. And then one day me and my friends was there chilling and we was like, you know what, he's determined.


Give him a chance. You know what Emini here. So see how determination is a good thing too. Yep. So I said, okay, let's go. And he actually knew Bounty. Right? So when he took me to Bounty, killer Bounty was there. I think he was playing cards or Dominos, but some gambling was going on. Right. And he didn't even look up. Like Butler was like, oh, this is the dude that I wanted to introduce it to. And Killer was like, yeah man, make him do the demo. You know, him talking him do the demo. He double six and he's playing his domino. Anyway, we went to do the demo. When I went to the studio to do the demo, I saw a man, A man came in and the engineer was arguing with him and something, he pulled a gun shot.


The dude killed him on spot. We had to leave. They're like, how would a blood clot? He said, kind of crash is this. And I alive. Right. Anyway, we went to another studio where I met a famous Jamaican DJ called Ricky Trooper. Okay. In Jamaica. We wouldn't call him DJ though. We'd call him a selector. Right. He spins the turntables and that was the start of an amazing relationship as well. Anyway, did the demo, went back to Bounty kill the next day, gave him the demo left, came back the next day, and then he was like, yeah, yeah. You with your buddy. Yeah. That's when Bon tequila became my mentor. You know what, Emini here? Legend. Yeah. He made me famous. A big up bon tequila.


And Shout out to the dude that brought you to him because Oh Yeah. Ron Butler. He lives in, in, in LA right now. As a matter of fact. Me and him. Not that close, but he's little bro. Right. He's one of my road managers. I don't leave him everywhere in The World. I am. He's there. How about the first time you met Budju? BuJo. Banton? Like I said, the first time I actually met him apart from the incident was in Manhattan. Them times. I had Visa way back in the day. Like 2004. Yeah. Let me ask you a little political question. It's not too political, but why do Jamaicans need visas to come here? But Americans don't need visas to go to Jamaica In America. Is America. You, I don, if you guys need visas to go anyway.


Shit. Maybe Russia. No, no. London. They kicked me outta London. I ain't have a visa. They kicked me out. They didn't even let me get, get get out of the airport. Yeah. We, we need visas for some place. Yeah. They kicked me right. London? Yeah. Emini here you London, motherfucker Emini here. We could, you know what, lemme pass on that answer. Yeah. I'm not gonna get too political. Okay. Okay. Because then it gonna end up in race and whatever. Yeah. Nah. How does it feel to get your visa back? Yes. And, and what does that mean for an artist coming from Jamaica and overseas? Emini here? It feels good man. And I think I deserve it too. That's right. Emini here. So shout I tell you. Yeah.


Not to not, I don't say that to sound cocky or anything. Right. I Just say that because apart from me putting in the work, the work, I think I'm changed as a person and I'm more user friendly, so to speak. So yeah. I think I deserve to And you gotta All the charges, right? Huh? You got acquitted of all the Charges. All the charges. Right. No charges. Because one of the things that that was said to me was this whole time you was, you was, you was caught, but there was no gun and there was no body that they ever found. No. Yeah. So it, it was almost like that's, that's like the, like Emini here. I went through the, the trials and tribulations and God, God brought me through successfully.


You know? So made it through. Made it through. Man. God is the greatest God. Damnit. Yeah man. God damnit luck For That man. God. Right. So what was some of the things you was watching in jail? Everything. Everything. Yeah. You, you had internet, you had worldstar. Worldstar. Yeah. No, that it's jail man. I had fucking PornHub. I seen you walk the red carpet and the Grammys And I seen you point out every, every little website like you knew. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's almost like he had to be, he had to have internet in, in, in, in the can. Yeah. That Was up to the time, man.


Yeah. Emini here. They have taken so much, so many phones, so many in prison. I've lost count man. But it's not like it's legal. Right. But it's a cell and I'm in a cell. Yeah. Right. So, you know, you know how that go. I had, Yeah, Yeah. It's crazy though. But yeah, man, Emini here. I wasn't, I wasn't given the worst treatment. Okay. I wasn't singled out, you know? Yeah. Sometimes people had to single you out. Yeah. But when I was in Jamaica and prison, I wasn't like singled out in a bad way. Right, right. Only in good ways, you know? 'cause you know the culture is bigger and like I said, I'm a chill person. Right. You know what Emini here And you're The World motherfucking boss.


That too. Yes. Yes. Our show is about giving people they flowers when they can smell 'em their thoughts when they can think 'em and they drinks while they can drink 'em. Yes. Yo man, welcome home. Yes. Yo, stay home. Stay on top of the game. Yes. We want to give you your flowers face to face, man. Man. And tell. Yeah. Oh wow. Amazing coming. Yeah. Yeah. You that's the camera. Straight ahead.

What's The war angel? Yes. So I, I want to go back a little bit 'cause we we're in the magnificence of vibes cartel right now. But we have to talk about how you got there and the things that made you that, you know. Hmm. And you said some of your inspiration was Bounty, ou, and Ninja man. Yes. You had an instance with Ninja Man one time on stage. You know what Emini here, I'm just wondering how the hell do you have an instance like that with one of your inspirations? It was an unfortunate incident. And you know what? Emini here, funny enough, like I said, ninja Man is the first artist that I really listened to and was like, I want to do this.


That's my job. It's gonna be my job. So I guess we were bound to meet at some time. They say work till Eds till Idol becomes a rival or something. They say that. That's exactly, yeah. It happens. Yeah. So Emini here. I guess that's what brought me and his journey right there in that time and space together. But yeah, we cool, we met after that. We were actually in prison together, like two prisons. Oh, okay. Yeah. So we were in Spanish town prison and we were in Tower Street in Kingston. I left in there as a matter of fact. So big up Ninja man. But yeah, that was a crazy point in my career, you know? Yeah. I was hungry. I could tell. You could See that was Hungry man. And I wanted it at any means necessary.


Yeah. But big up Ninja. We good like that. And what about the Times of Bounty? Who all was in the alliance? Oh yeah. I had the lyrical field at the Alliance as well when I left. Because You But how long were you with them? I was with Alliance 2000 till about 2005, 2006. Okay. Okay. Yes. Funny enough, you know what started that field with me and Alliance? What? When I went to Be Man's Wedding. Oh yes. He was with, Was did the Poor Woman Bounty. And Beanie was at it at the time, because remember Bounty Beman married at the time for Bounty. So Tensions was high. It was Love and Hip hop in Jamaica.


Exactly. No, that true love dance, but love dance. Love dance, love dance. But I knew Angel, that's Being's wife, but Hiss ex. I've known her for years. Right. So I basically went to Angel with wedding. But you were supporting her. Yes. Right. And trust me, man, that dang, that was crazy to me. That caused the riff. Yes. That caused it, man. Yeah. But But did you, do you see, you did a record as well with her. You did a Record with her. Yeah. While she was with Be Yeah, yeah, yeah. Birth to Her Life, you know what's up. Exactly. It was a big it still is a big song. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's what started it, man. And we went And that's what birth, like the emergence of Gaza Gully.


Exactly. 'cause then Movado stepped up as a kid, as the guy, because Gully Is, that's who Gaza went against, right? Yes, yes. Okay. But we're both from Alliance. Oh, both steps of success. We're both from Alliance. So when you Had that problem, he stepped Up for, for Alliance, right? Yes. He stepped up for Alliance. Right. 'cause I was shooting everyone. Right. He was like the young brave one that at the time. That's where I though he said, fuck Emini here. And then that's when it started. So it's over. Huh? It's over now. Yeah. Yeah. Emini here. Mother, father. Cool, man. As a matter of fact, it went down for a while though. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, his son was in the same prison I was in too. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, man. Shout out to Gly guard. Yeah.


Think he's in town. Do you ever look back at those times? And, And I don't wanna say regret Anything. I never regret anything, but, But maybe want to do something different. I know.

Or a sex shop. But we say ramping shop, we ramp rough. Yeah. Wecho, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's where the concept came from. You know what Emini here, that's where we used to hang out. Like in the name me, pop family know the girls used to come through La da dah.


Yeah. So we, that's how we gave it the name, the ramping shop. And I don't, it's a real place. I don't know if I'm supposed to say it like this. Yeah. But, and you bust popcorn, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Going. You said it proper. Just say it. Just say it. He Just say it and Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Brought him to fame, man. Very talented. You know what, Emini here? Yeah. Bigger popcorn. Did you, did you think he exceeded your expectations or did he meet your expectations?


No, he met it and Emini here, he has way more potential in him. Remember? He hasn't even touched us oil yet. Think About that. Yeah. He's one of the biggest artists out of Jamaica. Been all over The World. He rolls with Drake. Oh, I'm seeing him in Canada. I'm thinking that's us. Exactly. Holy shit's. So he's not Canada. That's, damn, I didn't peep that. And he goes to UK Sounds like gold uk unruly on a regular life. Yeah, man. He's doing his thing. He's big. If, if you, if you, if you get the headline Eastern Parkway Parade, would you bring popcorn with you? Unless he's walking through the border. Like I said, he doesn't have a visa.


But definitely like me and him, we travel all over The World. We've been traveling. Like I said, I gave him his fame. So of course if he gets his visa, it's five star 10, five pound, it's, it's on. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. But now as it stands, have to Walk, Man. Shit. Why they won't give him his visa? I never went to the embassy on when that was being discussed. You came out, you got your Visa. No problem. No. 'cause God is the greatest. I told you I've made it a 180, Like people expected me to come out guns blazing. Right, right. Fucking up the place. And literally and musically. But like I said, I'm just calm now. I'm chill.


Like I feel blessed, I feel good. You know what Emini here, I'm just showing love to everyone. That's right. Whether do you like me or not. And that's where my blessing comes from. You know, Emini here. A lot of people surprised that I got the visa. Yeah. You know what, Emini here, as a matter of fact, I went to the German embassy first and got the European one, the she y then I went to the US Embassy, got the US Visa. In addition to that, like I said, the Grammy nomination, keeping Freedom Street, the biggest dance also. You gonna make that a festivals a blessing. Yeah.

So we doing, we just keeping it every year in Jamaica. That's, that's one thing for sure. Right. It's gonna be an annual event. Alright. Do you realize that you stopped the planes traffic in Jamaica that night of the concert? Yeah. There was planes that was backed up. There was traffic. It was, it was like one of the craziest nights in Jamaica. Do, do you You knew that.


Yeah, man, even in Kingston you couldn't get a hotel room. All the rooms are booked. Right. You know what Emini here and what a lot of the hotels did on that night. So say the room is like two 50 US so for those two nights you gotta have a thousand a night. Wow. Yeah. Did they cut you in on that? No, but the hotel that I stayed, funny enough you brought that up because I actually stay at a hotel. I've been there so long. Even my manager was like, just buy the hotel, man. But they gimme a good ride. So I stayed there because my house is in the hills, but it's too far. Right. So if I want to hide away from people, then I go there. But I like to stay in New Kingston. 'cause that's like being in Manhattan.


You said every New Kington New, new Kingston, new King. It's a part of, of Kingston called Newton New Kingston. That sounds new. That sounds a little Better. Banks and the hotels and the nice restaurants and places you would like. Yeah. Okay. God damnit New Kingston. New Kington. Let me ask a question. Since I, we were talking about Freedom Street, you know, freedom Street. Come get, reaches, reaches here and then you emerge out the stage and you just sit there for maybe from under the pit. Yes. For maybe for one, two minutes. It seemed like five minutes. Yes. Whoa, whoa. What did that feeling feel like for you? I did it on purpose. 'cause remember I like to prove them wrong. So if you, if you want me to jump this table, Just say you can't jump this table.


You know what, Emini here. So you can't Jump the table not playing. But Yeah. So when I was coming out the p usually I would start making my signature slang from, from black stage. Exactly. So they'd be like, yo, yo. Alright, send here. Say, you know, who know the tea? Yeah. Them look at shit like that and would get the crowd going. Yeah. So I was like, nah, I'm coming out like Michael Jackson style. Exactly. Silence. Right. And let them do that. Yeah. So I gave them Michael A. Good like, think about a minute. It seemed like five. Yeah. Seemed like five Streaming on six out before they Yeah. Before they canceled it. And Then I said, yo, yo and pandemonium. Right? Yeah man. And then we started, it was crazy.


This is mine, huh? Yes. I like Kingstown. The drinks just appear outta nowhere. Yes. Vibe. Vibe. Let me ask you, do you think you should have won the Grammy? Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Why not? It was me like, you know, reading in the comments, a lot of people agree with you. They think that you should have won the Grammy. Of Course Emini here. That's Bob Marley. How many Grammys do you need? Like you are the number one artist in, in the Jamaica verse Jamaican universe. Right. You're the number one. It starts, sits on iTunes number and every day looking at us. Like this literally Emini here.


If you look at this album, that hardly moves some number one. Let me, yeah. I moved it a couple times. Goes back up, another artist come move it, it goes back up. That's Bob How many gametes you need, man. And if you think about it, my story is an amazing story. Yes. 13 years out prison. Yep. Getting nominated for the, the album that I did in prison, coming out, getting a US visa, walking the red carpet. That's a real story. Right. And we know the Grammys is also political as well. Yeah, of course. It's a beautiful story, right? It's a success story. Yes. And that could been you on the red carpet. That was Dope. Exactly. That would've been the icing on the cake. Am I bitter? No. Hell no. That's Bob Marley. And personally, I think he was the only person who could have beaten me.


You know what, Emini here. So No. And not the last Time you're gonna be nominated. Exactly. That's not The Well you asked the question like back, but now I have To answer. Here's the, here's the question that for me, for me, I love this movie, but every time I ask somebody from the island of Jamaica, they tell me, they didn't even see the movie Shottas. No. Marta is a legendary Bob Mar Talking about the Bob Marley movie. Bob Marley movie. Like every time I ask somebody, did you see the Bob Marley movie? Like a Person from the Yard, the new one, the new movie? They'll be like, yeah. They were like, no, I didn't see it. Emini here. I've seen clippings of it though. Like you ain't see it. But I've seen a lot of Cliff Link. Okay, Listen, it's, I need to understand this. Can you explain this to me?


Why are people, I I And I think you, you, you explained it to me a little bit. You said, I think people from Jamaica knows Bob's story so much that didn't want it to be Yeah. And he's iconic. But for, for, for us, like if a Biggie movie has come out, right? Yeah. I'm from Queens. I'm not from Brooklyn, but I'm gonna go see a Biggie movie. Yeah. Why isn't the People No. Thinks he feels the need to tell me where he's from. No, I'm sorry. Crazy. I'm Sorry. I'm sorry. Why don't people from the Yard go watch Bob's movie? I don't understand It. Emini here. It's personal man. Okay. Because you know, like you said, we know Bob, we know we grew up hearing his life story.


Even a lot of people in Jamaica who did watch the movie, they were like, oh, why did, why didn't Cindy Break Spear? Which is, which is Junior sma? Why didn't she get more time in the film? Right? Oh, it is because Rich did the film and so Yeah. So it's that serious in, in Jamaica. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know what Emini here, there's no people have their favorites man. Yeah. Because Bobby's that big. Right? Right. Now, what is the difference between reggae and dance Hall Emini here? First of all, the beats, you know, Emini here, dance Hall. As a matter of fact, dance Hall came about on reggae beats until it found its own niche.


Some would say in with Punani rhythm. In, in I think 86 we changed the, the, the, the, the beat itself. Right. But yeah. Yeah. But reggae is more political, more social. You know what, Emini here more against the system. More rebellious. Mm. But dance hall is just like sex. Mm. Drugs. You know what Emini here, I like it. More violence, more sex. Emini Here, it's deeper than that. It has many layers, obviously. Definitely against, yeah. Obviously, because you know what Emini here, but yeah, I think Dan Hall is, is Reggae's like unruly cousin? You know the one from the projects? Yeah. Yeah. That's dance hall. Younger Cousins.


Yeah. The younger cousin. Very younger. Re Reggae is Regg Is the older big brother, like Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. He smokes pipes. Yes. Yes. The, the the Dan the younger dance saw. I fuck that. Spliff dance saws a OG now Too. Yeah, of course it is. Emini here been around since the seventies. What's my man name? I told you, I showed a picture of, And I call him doctor, but he's not a doctor. Muta Bara. Muta Bara. Right. I seen him. You ever, you, did you ever do his show? Of course. I'm not afraid to do Muta show is iconic in Jamaica as well, you know? Yes. Especially among the Rastafari, right. Reggae community. Yeah. So he, he, he was saying like how, how much of reggae is the og, but I guess we kind of like, like stepped on that already, right?


Yeah. Yeah. You Can't dispute that. Yeah, we can't. Right. No, you can't dispute that. That's Plus it's coming from Mo it's coming from a legend too. Yeah. But he's Right. Reggae is the OG man, right? Yeah. But I think, and this is the topic that's been discussed, it's been going on for years. Should Dance Hall have its own category? And I think yes, because Sean Paul isn't reggae, we more classify him as dancehall. Yes. Right. And he's international. Right. You know what Emini here. So we have the, we have the criteria. We have big international dance hall stars as opposed to a junior gong who's reggae Right. As opposed to a Bob Marley who's reggae. Right. You know what, Emini here. Yeah. So I think we could have our own Ty and you Bounty Dance Hall.


Dance Hall Butcher was Dance Dancehall as well, like dance park And the artist can go back and forth. Yeah, we can do, because I have reggae tracks as well. Right. You know what Emini here. So it's a thin line, but you know, Emini here, it's there nonetheless. When you said Bojo was dancehall, would you ever do a album like a Til Shallow album, but on your own? You know, Emini here, when I say was maybe that's a strong choice at first, but what Emini here he was only dance off Hardcore. Dance off. Yes. Unfit and, you know, Emini here Piggy. Yeah. And then he was like, shine on, you know what, Emini here. So he made the transition. Right. And he was super successful as a dance hall artist.


And super successful as a reggae. A reggae artist. Yes. Not many people do that. Right. You know what, Emini here, so Yeah. Yeah. Would you make an album like that until Shiloh album or Emini here? I'm, I feel like I'm dancehall forever, man. Okay. I, I doubt that. But I do reggae songs Because You are, And I love reggae, but I'm dance all forever. You know what, Emini here, so Yeah. Yeah. That's not gonna change. Do you think you'll do a tour With Beanie Man? Emini here? If the money's right, I'll do a tour with anyone. You know what Emini, here it is. What I, when I say anyone Emini here? Any Jamaican artist? Yeah. Yeah. Like Yeah. Any hip hop artist. Right. Any r and b artist, Emini here saw black music.


Afrobeats like, come on, You bus rhymes on tour would Be crazy. Oh, that's my genius. That be. Yeah. He actually told me like, yo, we need to sing some dates together. Like, wow, that's my, You gotta let me know I'm flying Out. That would crazy. Yeah. I'm flying out front seat. Busa gonna be like, get on stage. I'm gonna be like, no, I gotta watch it. Nah, man. That, that was one of, That's a good point you made too, because when you say now I'm gonna watch it. Yeah. See, see, so you, so you can't just be an artist, you gotta be a fan of the music as Well. God, make some noise for that. Yeah. I like That. What you Said. Yes. I, I ain't gonna lie, man. I, I would, I would, if you and Busta Palms was to do a show together.


Yeah. Yeah. I I swear to God I probably wouldn't even call him. Yeah. Because he'd be like, yo come performing. I'm like, no, I'll be front row like this with a hoodie on like this. Yeah. Yeah. So the fans don't see you 'cause they got, you still need their space. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm gonna keep it a hundred with you. How many babies you think you made off of vibes? Your, just, your music. I'm talking about, I was listening to your shit and all you do is talk about fucking you Like, you like the fuck. Yes sir. You like the fuck, let's clap. Production. Yeah. But, but, but yeah man, like I said, like in Jamaica you have artists that do songs for the girls. And then you have artists like me that go hardcore sex Emini.


Here I have songs, sort the girls, right? Yes. But a lot of my songs is like sex, you know, Shabo ranks. Yeah. Like, I'm like Shabo ranks then like, he was like the man every other song. Pussy. Pussy. Fuck, fuck. But Emini here, artistically done. Obviously it's not, yeah, it's not like you're reading from a book like Sy Fox walk. No, it's music. So you gotta flow it gotta sound poetic. Gotta be on the beach. You got the cadence, right? Articulation. Yeah. All of that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was, it was funny as shit because we were, we were working out, see your music and all my white neighbors kept coming. I was like, pusy, pus.


I'm like, I don dunno what to say. I had my, my, when I was in America back in the day, I had security. Right. You know these giant looking guys. So some of them were Hispanic. So the dude came to me one day and he was like, yo, cartel man, I figured out your songs. Right. Your songs are the ones that say Pussy. Pussy every two lines. I know. That was like, yeah, nah. Yeah. He decided he crack the cold. That's what I'm saying. He crack the cold. But yeah, man, dance hall, like I said, dance hall is like that. It's hardcore. How many babies do you think you made just for your music? Like people just, Just people are so One Pop the Place.


Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What population? 19 20%. Off. Off the hell. Yeah. Hell. Hell yeah. It's bigger than Jamaica. But people say that even in the comment section, people would be like, say I post the old song. Right. Say Ramping Shop. Right. To like, oh, cartel, I made my son Jamal for that song. Yeah. Literally in the comment section. Yeah. Emini here. Virginity. That's a big song in Jamaica that I did as well. Ladies comment, oh, I lost my virginity to this song Such and so I got pregnant to this song. Yeah. They, they'd be in the comment section.


Think of that. That's great. And that's why people would call you The World boss, in my opinion. They say that you can make, you know, love music, you can make Yes. You know, thug music. Yes. Yes. And then you can, you can make club Music, you can do anything. Then I, like I said, I do a few reggae joints and, right. Yeah. Yeah. We do everything man. Like it's music. It's like I say, I sing my truth Right. And my experiences. Right. Doesn't have to be firsthand all the time. Right. Can be a second, you know, Emini here, me and you in the streets, or something happened in the community. Right. Sing about that. Right. We do it in a way, 'cause remember it's universal, right.


Emini here. Yeah. It is like hitting your elbow on the wall and feeling that shock. We all go through. Yeah. The funny book. The same stuff. Yeah. The funny book. So it's like, once you have been through it, chances are few other people have gone through that. It's relatable. Right. Yeah. So that's how I attack music from that more personal kind of, and that's why people love my songs Dance Off because I tap into that personal part. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. The, speaking of that, let's talk about the, your debut album, the up to the Time album. You know. So the one that just dropped? No, no. No. Okay. No, that's way back. Way. Okay. Way back 2003, I think. How Do you, do you remember creating that album and what was going on And and your mind State Emini here, like I said in them times.


Oh. 'cause when I came out back then, a lot of people didn't understand my style. Exactly. Because Dan Saw was changing And I was one of the, the kids at the time that was changing the flow. So I got a lot of pushback from the industry, from the gatekeepers. Right. So when that album came out, the kids just ate it up. And that's So Vice Charact became like a young g back in the day. Right. 'cause the flow was different. Right. You know, Emini here because you know, when like say nineties dance hall, the typical template would be like, was like, can I, no, you choose the cheap like chicken parts. Right. She called Valentina Soard shirt, heart Glass, glass Cars, 80 Dutch Marks did them when me pass, would I tell you, they of me in them TAs, Barbara Glue and them color s who is five Cartel, and they make it recommendation and remarks.


Some semi ugly, like Bob Sparks some semi best them come across Illegal firearm, a fiber glass, some rush Me with no knife for us. This plus me equally a life for us. You know, crazy rhymes like That As opposed to like, this is early 2000 we talking about. Right. So yeah. So that album, when it came out, the kids ate it up And I became like instantly a household named just off of that. Yeah. Because like I said, we grew up, the generation before me wasn't into hip hop like that, but my generation of the nineties, we grew up to, like I said, the KRS one, biggie Small when he came out. Tupac. Yes. Jay-Z Nas. And the changing of the flows. Changing of the flow. So we kind of have had a the ear to like, right.


Oh wow. You can say you can express yourself like that. Right. You can say that. You Can jump out the pocket. Come back into The pocket. Exactly. So that's where Cartel came from, like as a product of dance, salt and hip. Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was crazy. You wanna go? Yeah. You got something? No, I was gonna say, I could see why Sfe was trying to compare him to Eminem. The Eminem and Jamaica. Yeah. And that's, that's old part. Exactly. And that's like 25 years ago. 20. You know what, Emini here. So Yeah. It's crazy. I don't Like that comparison, by the way. No, but I meant, I'm talking about the flow knew what he meant. He could do, he can do anything. You know what I'm saying? We, we always said Lil Wayne, you know that that's who we always No little Wayne is fired though.


Like how, how does he his mind, how does he come up with that shit? Which is what people say to me in dance song. Exactly. That's said to Little Wayne.

Now I was asking you about the, the, the the Brooklyn Parkway Parade.


Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Now in, in New York, this is like the biggest, biggest. This is like for the, for the, for the Jamaicans. This is like their summer jam, right. Is Oh, the West Westing this day parade back in the day, you know. Yeah. I did it back in the day. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But time times, like I said, I was a young artist, elephant man and them guys was running the place from in the dance hall first. Right? Yeah. Yeah. What do you feel about reggaeton? I love reggaeton. Mm. I don't understand shit they're saying. But the flow is similar to the flow is similar to dance hall and the rhythm, the beat is dancehall. Who's dancehall? I love it, man. I have no problem with it. I love it. Have you collaborated yet with anybody?


No, not yet. Oh, that has not. No, not yet. But I love it. You know what Emini here, the vibe, the energy. Yeah. When it comes on in the club, Emini here, we don't stop. Like, what the fuck? Fight it, man. Can you name a, a reggae don record that you like? Hell no. Okay. I was, But I know that Yankee dog. Okay. Because he was the original pioneer, one of the pioneers. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So we knew about Daddy Yankee and as Jamaicans back in the day, that made us feel patriotic to know that, oh, these guys are patterning our shit. So it Oh Wow. Daddy Yankee. That that's, that's a, a reggae man. Regg, repeat that. Remember daddy? Even the daddy? Yeah. Daddy Yankee. Daddy Yankee. Oh, I didn't even peek that.


Think about it. Because Jamaicans caller, African Americans, Yankees, Yankee. Yeah. I didn't know. And then he put the daddy on it. Yo daddy fucking me up Jamaica. I swear I didn't even pee that. Oh my God. I've been on tour with this nigga for three years. I know that Shit. Thank you. What the Fuck is wrong with me? Holy shit. Oh, okay. Okay. How about Afrobeats? I love Afrobeats. What's your favorite Afrobeat record out right now? This, I don't know if I should sing it. She, she's sang, she wants him to make her sweat water. Oh yeah. That's song. Well, yeah. Tyler. Tyler And I love the girl called Thas too. Thas too. Yeah. I think she won Grammy's for, she won at the Grammy's the other day.


Yeah, I was there. Yeah. I love Afrobeat. Alright. We skid. I got songs with Whi Skid. Right. You know what, Emini here, Bru. Don't think I have a song with him, but he's big too in Jamaica. Right. And AWA from Ghana came to Freedom Street. Fuck the place up. Yeah. He love her. Yeah. Yeah. Man. That's my bro, man. So yeah. Yeah, because Emini here, it's, it's, it's African music, all of it. Hip hop, dance hall, reggaeton. It's literally called reggae salsa. Exactly. South Africana, all that shit. Music Come On, jazz, whatever. Rock and roll is black music. That's Africa. Yeah, True. Because we have Buju Bonton on and Buju, he was like that. He don't feel like that Sometimes Reggaeton or Afrobeats give dance hall and reggae is props.


So that's something that you, you you don't agree with. No, It's not that I don't agree, but think about it. Reggaeton is called reggaeton. The homage is even in the name. Reggae. Reggaeton. Exactly. Yeah. You know what, Emini here. So the the, the homage is there Emini here. I think what, and this goes to show the power of Jamaican music, right? Because it's a numbers game and Jamaica is small. Right. Look at what We tell, you know what Emini here? Nigeria has what? Over 200 million people. Yeah. They're gonna get their own slot on Mt. V or Africa as a continent. It's a fucking continent. Right. So they're gonna get their own. Nigeria has 200 more than 200 million. Mm man. Yeah. Huge. Someone that are huge over there. I think I'm going to go ahead and say it has like maybe two 30 mm million.


So of course MTV is gonna recognize and all them niggas are scamming niggas. All them niggas are scammed. Allegedly. Allegedly. Allegations. Huh? 3 24, 2. I'm off, I'm off like six. You really? You teaching me man? That's why they told me the teacher. Yeah, but sea seats, it's a numbers game. So they're big. Right. So they're gonna get the MTV special. Oh. Or MTV Africa. Right, right. Well Jamaica is like two point something million. Wow. It's not feasible. But, but we still influence Nigeria. Right? We still influence Ghana.


So that just goes to show the power of the music that comes out of that small island.

Like Emini here it was, it could have, looking back it could have been way better. But like I said, I was the first person to do it. So we didn't have a template. It was like the flavor of love basically. But you, But we have a Jamaican thing. Yeah. So I did it. Even to this day, people like, why when are you doing it over you?


You just come outta prison. You should be doing it not getting married. So yeah. People loved that was big back in the day. Mm. Especially with the songs. Pusy Pussy Puy. Yeah. Emini here goes hand in hand man. Yeah. Trust me. Got I got one. Kendrick Lamar or Drake, You go all the way down. No, we Drake. I Seen you say Drake before. Yeah, I used to Jamaica to man. Yeah, you said, you said every block you go through you can hear a Drake record. You might Not hear Jamaica can hear, you may not. Right. Not saying he's not talented, but you know, Drake has that commercial flavor and he's like, he's like the hip hop Michael Jackson.


Right. You know what, Emini here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, Juy plus he did a lot for pop and he rips the culture. Right. He rips Jamaica culture. Yeah. To the point where people started calling him culture vulture. Right. But like we don't feel that way. Not In Jamaica that No, Not in Jamaica. Influence as well. Like Yeah, because Jamaicans are all over the Toronto. Exactly. So it is, it is. This next one. I got this one. No, no, all go ahead. I got this because I was looking in my closet for my clocks. Yeah. Bums. I couldn't find 'em. I got a brand new pair of New York Yankee clocks. And then I said I might be going too far. Yes. But Clarks, Adidas. No, that's not Adidas. That's not Adidas buddy. That's Addy's. Okay. My bad.


Ady. See My ais? Yes. The ones that shoots I used to make back in the days. How you know that? Come On. Alright. A The nigga said Come on, come on. Must Be my over here. Crazy. I love my job. Right? I love my job. Yes. Yes. Talk talk About the Addies though, because what, what inspired you to have your own shoes? Emini here. Just like I said, my, my, I love money, but it's deeper than that. Like I said, we grew up on hip hop as well and we always admired how these guys come from poverty just like us right now, they're rappers.


They have their own shoes, they have their own, you know what Emini here brand. So you Were seeing that first in the hip hop. Yeah. In the nineties. Yeah. Yeah. And that inspired me. Of course, you know what Emini here, like I said, my generation is the first generation to have cable tv. Mm. So you that influences like, So when cable came out in Jamaica, we were like 14 years old being the first generation to be able to watch BET and Wow. Yo love AJ and Free. Yeah. Yeah. 1 0 6 and Park 1 0 6. And Park 1 0 6. And Park. Yeah. So we were Rap city and Rap City and all of that. Hear how loud he got all Emini here. It changed American landscape and it added to the culture as well.


You know what, Emini here. So like I said, yeah, before us there was just one TV station in Jamaica. Right. So the gen, so my older sisters, they grew up on one TV station that signed off at midnight. Crazy. Right. Wow. And Clarks, I know their sales had to go Up after You. Yeah. Well I remember Clarks, we were a British colony. So Clarks has been embedded in the culture. I just brought it back Exactly. Because like I said, when the cable TV came, this came Oh, The Jordans. Jordans came. Yeah. Sneakers came, jerseys came. So a lot of it was lost to the kids who came out in the, in the late nineties they came out wearing Jordans.


And so, so when I did Clarks, it brought back that old school style. Yeah. And that's why it's still so big to this day. 'cause it has always been in the culture. Right. You know what, Emini here. Yeah. Let see where we at. Dre Skull. Super hype Dre Skull. But super hype is my legend. Dre Skull Man name did Kingston Story album. That was crazy. Sizzler or Capleton? Two Legends. Man tell you Y Woo. Did you drink? I'm watching you now.

Damien Marley or Steven Marley. Damien. That's Junior Gong Man. Junior. Come on. Big up. Steven still. But Junior Gong like the younger kids, a lot of young kids in Jamaica even say Junior Gong is is better than Bob Marley because he not only sings he DJs, he raps. Right. Because he grew up different. Right.


Right. Emini here, he grew up in between Miami and New York, like Yeah. Yeah. He's a, yeah, he's a a world citizen. Mm. A big gang. Shaaba or SuperCAT? Shaaba. Super Catman Man. Super Cat as hell. Yeah. But like I said, remember Shaba is more my like for the ladies. Right. So Super Cat is a real guy. Emini here. I'm a, I'm a hybrid. 'cause coming up I was naturally gangster, but I do a lot of songs for the ladies. So, And it feels like Super Cat was one of the first artists to really get into the hip hop. Yeah. And yeah, of course because him and Heavy D was friends, heavy D and every, his First track is long and big.


His first track is on that too. Super cast remix. Yeah. Sometimes Remix and Dali Ma Dali Ma. Yeah. Cat is a legend as well. Yeah. That's something Ninja Super Cat Sha Ranks era. Right.

As a matter of fact, you Break ea, She, no, I didn't break her my a producer that I recorded a song fork called Luie.


Yes. You basically stole the song and gave it to Sheia to sing. But this is when Gaza fans, my fans really had a problem with Sheia when she came out and said she wrote the song. Mm. As if she wrote for you. No, as if she wrote the entire song. Song. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, so you wrote her verse too? No, it was my song. Oh, so I record the song for you? Yeah. You give it to a girl. So all she did was change the verses. So if I say me, she said her right? Yeah. Yeah. So she just changed like the, the pronouns. Oh, okay. You know what, Emini here? Yeah. And then some, someone leaked the original song. Mm. When, when she was saying, oh, cartel didn't write my part, I wrote my part and she released it.


Someone leaked the original song where I wrote everything. Yeah. That's why God's ancient fans had a problem with her initially. Well, yeah, she cool man. Like I've never met her in person though. Remember I was in prison them times. So, but yeah, I told you it was a prison member. I didn't see it. I didn't see her. Yeah, Because you recorded that feature for her, her in Prison. I recorded that song in prison. Oh wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Elvis, who was the producer, gave it to Sheia. So they left my hook and she just sang my verses. Right. How did that fit? Did you did that vex you? No, I wasn't vexed And I wasn't happy. It was just like, yo, I need my money. I need that.

Once you in Brooklyn, you are Jamaican. Like I'm in Miami. I couldn't get a craving. A all they had was this Marro, Marlboro, fuck. If I'm in Brooklyn, craving A is sold on in every shop. What is Guin? This is Guinness, right? Yep. Yeah. Guinness. That's Jamaican. Like our style dragon style Dragon beer. Red stripe. Heineken. That's not from Irish.

A even the comedian said it the other, so you Better stop craving a Even The comedian said it the other day.


The man was like, oh, there are more Jamaicans in Brooklyn than Jamaica. Yeah. And he is not lying. Yeah. Yeah. Because there's a lot of white people that go to Jamaica right now. They saying that there might be a Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans in a little while. For real? Yeah. They saying Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans. Oh that's because they, they they kicking all the Puerto Ricans out 'cause of the Tax gentrification. Gentrification and above the whole island. And, and tax purposes. Because if you live there for more than six months, it's a tax haven. Yeah. So if you live there for more than six months or seven months, you don't have to pay No US tax. That's crazy. 'cause in Jamaica, I think they work hard a deal with the Chinese that you don't pay taxes on your business for like five years.


Wow. So say you're a Chinese guy, right? Oh, highly unlikely. 'cause you're a dark skinned. Yeah. Or Just say you're a Chinese guy. He Chinese. Fuck It. Why do I keep using Japanese? Let go Anyway. You pay, you come to Jamaica, you open a business. Say you get five years, what do you call it? Grace, period. Not to pay taxes. In the fourth year, you, you send for your cousin from fucking Beijing, they replace him and put him as the CE of the company. And the company's not paying tax. So the company's not paying taxes for another five years. Yeah. And they bring the next one after and then the next one after that. Yo. And that's when you have the craziest Chinese Jamaicans ever because Exactly.


Bamba Cloud, I'm gonna be honest with you. I see. I was watching, you know, This is a fake bumba cloud. That's not how we say it. I was Watching a construction site in Jamaica. Yeah. And then they had nothing but Chinese workers coming out. And, and the Jamaican guy was like, yo man, look, they, they won't hire us. And so They, they, my thing is this, okay, I have no problem with Chinese nationalism. The problem I have is with the lack of black people's nationalism. Right. But we're not gonna go that deep. Fuck it. String champs. Yeah. String champs. We yeah. We not going that deep. Fuck. That could be better.


Could be Better. Yes. They Can do better. They Can do better. They can do better. We already spoke about, did He Just say the government can do better? Yeah.

It's like you don't even have to, you don't have to claim your throne. No, no, no, no, no. The people claim it for you. Thank you, sir. And that's, that's what's crazy about it. You know what Emini here, but just anything you will, I know you said you don't have no regrets.


No regrets. Yeah. But Is anything you thought you could do better? What, what was one of those things? Watch short boss pussy. More like, I should have put dudes on her, like private eyes, like undercover fucking agent to watch the pussies. That's bad of pu time. And I, amm gonna be honest, when I met s that's my current fiance now. That's right. It was 2015. July 25th. Yeah. I met while you was in jail. Yeah. In prison. And at that time, me and shorty was going through a lot because remember, I'm in prison.


I'm fighting Graves disease. Even now I have it. That's why I wear my shades. Because sometimes, like even now we're smoking. Right. My eyes will irritate me. My eyes will get swollen. Oh, wow. Yeah. Straight up. 'cause we're human. Yeah. You know what, Emini here, and Shorty SDA was there for me. And like I said, I understand short is perspective. Right. Think about this. You are in prison two years. I, I'm gonna hold it. And she did three years, four years, five years. Six, seven, bro. Eight nigga, nine dog, 10. Come on man. So that's when me, like, I'm a realist.


And what was you originally sentenced to? How many years? 30 fucking five, bro. It was light man. It was light. We had 35 before parole. Yeah. So I would've, if things went how they wanted it, I would still be in prison. Yeah. So, like I said, and CDA was there for me. She was, we spoke on the phone night after night, days on days she was there. And in Jamaica, when someone represents for you while you are in prison, you don't forget that though. You're going to hell. So, but, but my thing is this, I understand people, which is one of the things that has made me be a, a great artist. I understand people, human nature. Right? Right.


So I could never be angry with my baby mom, man. Like, I love her. Still respect her. 'cause she raised my, my kids. And based on the, the person that I was, a lot of people would expect my children to be gangsters in the streets, shooting guns, whatever, whatever. She held them down. Man. None of my son, like I said, I was in prison with Vardos son, who is my son's best friend. Mm. A lot of people don't know that. So even when me and Movado was addict, that's crazy shooting. That's crazy. Fighting. And the whole Jamaica was divided like his son. And my son was. That's crazy. I'm telling you, bro. Even when I was in prison, my father's son was like, yo, say hi to Jaheem for me, da da da.


Yeah. So yeah. Big up. Big up. Mother, father, son. Enough respect enough love to the Goaly guard. Yeah, man. It's a woman. Dante, free. Dante. I wanna Talk about that can keep going. I wanna talk about that period, because I feel like we just breezed Over No period. That's the monthly thing for female. You right. That Time. Yeah. I don talk about that time. We just Breezed over it. So, Back time, sir. You don't take it far. Yeah. Yeah. We fucked up in Jamaica like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gaza versus Gully, you know, it got so serious where the government had to ended. Yeah. The government stepped in. They weren't giving us permits to do concerts.


Yes. They shut that shit down. They were like, bro. But funny enough, when Movado And I were at the, the, the King's house, which is where the government is, so we were there and they were like, yo, you need to shut this down. Let the kids know. Because the kids took it very seriously. Yes. Like big, small Tupac. East. East versus west. Yeah. Right. 2.0 in Jamaica. I'm not even joking. I'm talking about, I Remember serious, you know, that he knows that. And the government was like, bro, we will shut you guys down. Stop fucking about. But them times when they took a break in the meeting and me and my father was in the, the government building.


And we were like, yo, look where music brought us. And that's when we had a moment and it was like, yo, we need to fix this. And we did for a few months. Yeah. Because you went, it's another intervention happened. Yes. So Happened the war started again. Why they they black People and we have ego And we come From bucking and now we are rich. So, you know, you know, black man and his ego. Of course we have something to prove. But yeah, man. And we did the, the fighting again, round two, the government came in. They, they did us Emini here, they shut down everything.


And then DDoS Tivoli. Yeah. Tivoli. Yeah. He was like, yo, let, let me speak to you guys. And we did the meeting and we was like, yo, for real? Then we need to chill when Dar come home soon, right? Yeah. He got arrested in 2010. Oh, so he should be coming home. Yeah. It was a big thing in Jamaica. A lot of people died. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Lot of people came. Should be coming home soon, right? Yes. He should be. I don dunno when, but yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought he had a 10 minutes. That's crazy, man. That dance hall is the people in Jamaica, they love dance hall. They take music seriously. Yeah. Which is good because that's why if you're a star in Jamaica right?


You're a star forever. You have no expiration date. That's how much you love me. You revered. Right? Right. Yes. You're revered. Right. And I go, I go as far as to say this literally like worship, like next to Jesus. You know what Emini here, what was It like, if you are a star in Jamaica, you're a star all over The World. That's true. That's true. Yeah. Because I, I just being honest That's true. As your cousin Yeah. I see the influence that Jamaica has around The World. Yeah. Around The World. Not just as entertainers. Remember Mark Marcus Garvey did Marcus Garvey. That's Right. Exactly. He taught the entire Latin America. That's why we big in Panama. We big in Latin America. Costa Rica, Venezuela Minister Faron is from Jamaica.


He's Jamaica Faron. He's, he's Jamaican. He's not from Jamaica, but he's Jamaica. But yeah, he has his Jamaican heritage. Right. 'cause remember, like I said, funny enough, Marcus Garvey, you know who was his right hand man? Elijah Muhammad. Oh wow. He used to run the Detroit office of the UNIA for Marcus LA. Wow. Really? No joke. I kid you not, bro. That's crazy. And I'm telling you, Jamaican have always had that influence in America with our cousins, the African American. We've always had that influence. You know what, Emini here. So, and, and like I said, the the honorable Elijah Muhammad was Marcus Garvey's appoint man in Detroit.


And, And for people that don't know, that's the, the founder of the Nation of Islam. Exactly. He's the founder. People Don't know. And Malcolm X's father was Marcus Garvey's right hand man. Wow. You know, they tied him to a train track and let the trainer run over. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy, man. I remember, Yeah. How can't you remember? You weren't there. No, I'm talking about reading. Yeah, yeah. Too. Literally Malcolm X autobiography. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's where I read Alex Hall, to be honest. I read, that's where I read, look At the, you can tell that there's influence by the literacy, By the cover of the, I did This literally by look, Malcolm X, the pose, which is the album.


Bob Marley did this pose as well. So I'm sure he was in, because Bob Marley sang a lot of Marcus Lar philosophies. He put it to music and he put highly the speech that he made at the insert his philosophy, United Nations sometime it wasn't called the United Nations, it was called, I don't remember. United Niggas. United Niggas. Yeah. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. So Bob Marley, that's, that's why Bob Marley's so powerful. Yes. Because, you know, he's mixed his his dad, his wife. Yeah. Yeah. And I White Marley's Black.


So he had to navigate through that racial tension back in the day when in the seventies, in Jamaica sixties, if you were light skinned, you were kind of frowned upon. Right. Yeah. So, man, we love Bob though. Like our generation respect Bob, he represented for Marcus Garvey. He represented for Sela Highly ssi. Yeah. Even when I was in la, like if Ethiopians, they came to the hotel cartel. Right. We love you. Yeah. Yep. But let me ask you ask this to Chris Brown. Oh, represent Big up Chris Brown. He won fucking Oh yeah, man, Grammy.


Yeah. Yeah. My favorite song on the album is Residual. So Who said Yes? I knew. Yes. Yeah. Big up Chris Brown, man. Okay. Yeah. So ask Chris Brown then. Why do I not have a drink? And it screenshot. Come on, come on. You slacking Brown. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Browning is slacking, you know, brownie. Right. Light-skinned girls in Jamaica. We call them Browning, Which is the Made, made that famous when he did Browning called Brown. And the whole Jamaica Me up. The whole Jamaica wanted to fucking, it was like ou. And then he did black woman song called Black Woman.

But reggae music is the DNA for Jamaicas. So is Dancehall. Because remember, like I said, dancehall came out in the seventies. Right. Seventy four, seventy five, seventy six. I was born in 76. So I'm a product of Dancehall. Right. And also the Cold War. 'cause remember the USSR right. Us say they had that thing and that what, that's what Honest, honestly brought that level of violence to Jamaica and changed the culture.


And then when the violence came, you needed an art form to express it. And that's how the dance hall was birth. Who, Who were those first early dance hall artists in the Seventies? King Stitch, big U. Which big u's son is the lawyer that got me free? Mm. Wow. Think About that. He's one of the first DJs. Wow. And his son freed the number one dj. Wow. I sat Buchanan. Right.

That's why you're saying the violence Started. Yeah. From the Edge. Cold War. Remember the Cold War? Just like the Nicaragua with the Contras. It's the same where The World, the contra and the sand.


Sand, yes. Sand. So it was that proxy were all over the place happened in Congo too. Yep. With, with Lumumba happened in Kenya with Kenyata.

So, so lemme ask you right, The Jamaican, I'll give it right back to you, Ross. Right. So let me ask you, when, when, when Escobar was locked up, right? They said that like, like one night, every two or three months he would come out. Yeah. He would do something. Yes. Within your 13 years of doing a bid, I Got lots of fussy Damn the ring. I didn't go there. Oh, sorry. He's like wrong. The answer to the right Question. If you had like how Escobar did, he came out one night every two months. Yeah. If you ever had one night. You talking about Pablo? Yeah. Pablo, I'm sorry. There's only one Escobar. I'm Jamaican know. As a matter of fact, remember you said Five Cartel was a group.


Yes. Where you think you got the name? Cartel. Cartel, yes. From Escobar. Cali. Cali Cartel. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So if you, you, if like with every two months, if you could come out and do one thing within your 13 year bid, what was that one thing you would do? Have Hug my kids. Man. Damn.

But yeah, man, like that's the only thing because remember in Jamaican prisons, if it's not family day, your children can't come and see you. Oh, wow. Because if you, if you're not 18 years old, you can't come to visit me on a regular day. Oh wow. They have things that they keep on family day, which is like in Christmas, you know what Emini here, you need to see your kids on Christmas, Easter. Yeah. So we got like two, twice a year. I, I got to see my, see my kids. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So that's crazy. But like Women, whatever, that's, but that wasn't on the top of my to-do list.


My to-do list was to raise my fucking kids. Even from behind. Even from behind bars. And that's why I say to you, my baby mom, like, shorty, I give her her props. She did her job. She made sure, even though I was who I was, my kids didn't emulate my lifestyle. You know what, Emini here. Right. And my daughter, like, she wants to be a doctor. She's in. Yeah. She's doing well in school and so on. So that's what I respect about my baby mothers. They weren't just, they that they, they put in the work. Respect. Respect though. How many kids total? I got it. Huh? How many kids total that I got like seven. Seven. I have two in Brooklyn.


You know, in Flatbush. That's what I'm saying. That's why when you said Miami already, I said New York. I got, my children are in Flatbush. I got two sons in Flatbush right now. Yeah. And who?

So you was in Montego Bay, but the Montego you in, it's a tourist spot. No, you have the streets.


We was ready for Kingston. They love you. No, but that's what I'm saying. Kingston and Montego Bay is one in the same. It's just like New York, la No, we are ready to go to, it's like Brooklyn Compton. The Hood is everywhere Before the fucking tj TJ Call when the white gentrification. Yeah. Tj, can you sit over there? Because he been looking for you for over there In Jamaica. The number one meal in Jamaica is at tj. Because everything I say, I'm like, that's tj, that's the number one meme in Jamaica right now.


But he is my manager. Yes. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. We gotta do that. And this is why Steve, my first manager was the guy that introduced me to Bounty Killer. Remember I was telling you that. So we stopped the guy, Guy that, that drove you to him. Yeah. Yeah. He did. He was your manager then after that. Yeah. He was all fucking ni ni Nissan. Okay. And I do the, the American pronunciation. Nissan. Nissan, your blood fly. So I I, I partied wasted him in 2020 2004. And I've been my own manager since. So everything I've done since then, all the greatness, all the dying soul greatness.


Wow. I did it by myself. Wow. When I came out, I made him my manager because I've known him since he was in high school. Wow. I gotta tell you, in Jamaica you have the ghetto and the hardcore part. And then you have the up, we call it uptown. Uptown in Jamaica means you grew up privileged. Okay. Like my children side. Okay. They grew up privileged. 'cause I, I started making money. That's right. But I'm from the ghetto. He grew up privileged. So his father is from the ghetto, made sure his children grew up good. Right. Right. Fire. Yeah. So when I met him, he was just outta high school. And he, he kept, he had a, a big annual event called orientation.


So, you know that's about school orientation. Right. It's a, a school party dance where you dress up in your school uniform if you went to fucking whatever. Yeah. Yeah. So my nickname was the teacher. And that's how I met him. So I, and he was like, yo, I'm keeping a party. I want the teacher to pass through. 'cause it's called orientation. Mm. Then he started producing, I gave him his first record. He got Idonia, which is also a big artist in Jamaica. And then he became a famous producer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Ska, which is my road manager. He's actually here as well. He introduced me to, I don.


So, and then we get, we showed the love, give the respect. 'cause Bro, Ty Killer made me fucking rich. So I don't have a problem to pay forward. Right. 'cause Bounty Killer made me be able to take care of my family, move them out the ghetto, put them in some fucking mansions. So then we pay forward. So scatter brought me to Idonia. I brought Idonia to Bounty Killer. And the rest is history. You know what, Emini here? Yeah. Man. When's the last time you smoked the American Blunt? I haven't You rolled this. Oh yeah. Should I smoke it? I'm on a visa. Should I smoke?


If you fuck me up American Embassy in Jamaica, no regular weed. No, but you're American. So it was rolled by the Peruvian. Yeah, it was Peru. Peru. You roll it. Peru. Peru. Shit. Ice my come get here. No, my shit is legal. Ice. My C get Boris. Boris is, so basically you're telling me that this is only tobacco? Yes. Okay. Thank you sir. Only tobacco. That's only tobacco. It's tobacco. It's tobacco. It's only tobacco. Yes. And you know how slave, because tobacco is king. Yes. Homework disclaimer. If you're not black, you can't say   Right. Not at all your vibes.


I Wanna disclaimer, I wanna, you know, commend you, because I, I see when you first came home, when you battling Graves disease. Yeah. And now you did the show and you looking amazing. Yeah. You feeling great? Yeah. Who could you contribute that to? No. First of all, that's an amazing question because in the black community speaking on illness is like taboo. Yeah. Right. Because we had, we had to be strong, especially mental illness. And I spoke on that the other day. But that's a good question.


While I was in prison, I was diagnosed with Grave's disease in 2014. Can you explain What it is just for people? Grave's disease is the autoimmune disease. It affects your petit pituitary glands. And I said pet Sure. 'cause I'm drunk. But I would say this though, Jamaicans, you know this statement Tom drunk, but Tom the fool. So Graves disease is an autoimmune thyroid disease that affects your, it's, it, it makes you sweat a lot. It makes you your heart palate. It, it makes your eyes swollen. That's why I keep wearing my shade. Well, I used to wear my shades because I learned from bounty kill.


But it's very dangerous. Remember I was in prison. I was battling Grave's disease. I was, I had to balance my career. I had to keep my family in check. I had to keep my relationship in check. I had to be producing music. So anyone that has Grave's disease, I think Missy Elliot had it too. Okay. Already. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're human bro. And a lot of people think because you're artists we're superhuman. Which we are. But we still get affected. So I just want people to know that whatever illness you have, whether it's Grave's disease, whether it's cancer, whether it's HIV, whatever, don't be afraid to embrace it and live your life.


'cause you only have one. I think Irv Gotti passed away. He just passed Away. Rest in peace. 54. That's young bro. Yeah. E and this is sort that the millennials, the Gen Z. When I was like 14, 15, back in the day, I thought that 50 years old was old. Right. Bro, I'm 49. I feel as young as ever. 49 here as well. I feel as young as ever. Right? Yeah. Yeah. All you need to do is take care of yourself. Right. Eat properly, drink plenty water. Have sex a lot. You'll be all right. It Is what it is. But yeah, but like I said, man, having an illness shouldn't be taboo.


'cause we're humans. We live, we die. So if you, if you're sick, whether it's a mental problem, talk to someone. Right. I, I did a, a a a video the other day about mental health. That's huge, man. Yeah. 'cause a lot of us, especially the ones that bring joy to people, are the ones that's suffering the most. Because I'm looking at Nori, you bring joy to me because I grew up listening to you, even though you're not older than me. But you get, you play an important role in a specific part of my life. Mm. Thank you. You understand? But that doesn't mean you're not human. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you.


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And now you smart. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we're still human. Yeah, you're right. Vulnerable. And if you, if you are vulnerable. Right. Don't be afraid to speak to people. 'cause that's a lot. That's one of the problems with the African-American and the Afro-Caribbean community because it's the boo. Yeah. We feel like we gotta be strong all the time. No, you can be vulnerable, bro. Right. You can talk to your mother, you can talk to your girlfriend. Mm. But then why do you love her bro? Right. Why do you love her and spend money on her and put her in your fucking house. But you're afraid to talk to your woman, bro. Mm. It's real.


You know what, Emini here, taking a shot of that. Yeah, bro. Well, shit, this is empty, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, the shot Empress is here. Yes. That's your new nickname. Shot Em, shot Empress. But bro, yeah. Trust me man. Not that's real. Like I said, I sing my truth. Right. That's why I mentioned Eva Graves disease in my song. Because like I said, it it, it inflames your body. That's why when I came out, you know how that inflammation in my face, my, my stomach. But bro, we're human beings. I have no shame in my game, man.


Like I speak my truth. It is what it is. Black pe and black people take fucking certain illnesses as taboo. Right. We're afraid to talk about it because we were raised to be tough.

'cause we have issues surrounding sex. I can only pop off once per night. Why can't I talk to you about that real shit? And, and you make me feel comfortable talking about you. Which is what a a a is AAA is. Right. Hi, I am vibe cartel. I'm an alcoholic, or I'm vice cartel. I'm a whatever. Right. Right. Once black people get, especially us as black people based on our historical trauma, we're supposed to be able to speak to one another.

You can't take the We needs Yeah. We, we as black people, we need to That's right. Be able to speak to each other. You're right. That's true. And I learned this while in prison because anyone in Jamaica can tell you before prison I was a fucking devil. But growth and maturity taught me a lot of things. We need each other. That's why they made these groups and these aa and group therapy's.


Good. 'cause you are going through something that I'm going through. So you have questions And I have questions. Maybe you have the answer for some questions. Oh, why did she cheat on me? I did everything. Right. You can maybe impart some knowledge onto why, because you've been there before me. Right. So you figured it out before. If bro, we, we living man, we a hundred years from now, we gone, bro, you know what Emini here. That, that's, that's the mindset I have now. Norie Jesus. Hold on one minute before you get to that me, bro. Let's, let's Get a shot though. Alright. Yeah, man. That's, let's drink the show. Oh, oh, oh shit. Yeah, mom. That's the mindset I have now, bro.


Respect The mindset. Respect. Respect the mindset. Yeah. Man, we living bro. Yo, it's not that. What it look AI hooked him up, man. Oh yeah. What was the feeling? What Was the feeling when they said, you leaving the jail, man? Yeah. How was that feeling? I'm get, I'm from the ghetto so you can't hype me up. So when the lawyer said to me, you are free, I was in prison. I was in my cell talking on myself. And when, when No, seriously. And when Alexandra Labe, which is Isat right hand, she said to me, I'm free, but I've been in prison for 13 years.


I didn't want to hear from you. With all due respect, I wanted to hear from Isat. Yeah. Because he, he's the one that I'm paying. Right. And when he called me and said I was free, bro. Mm. Tears man. Mm. Knock on the front tears, bro. I fucking cried. Yeah. Go fuck you. If you think that's bitch Welcome. I'm a gangster, bro. No, you can't show I'm Tough enough, man. That's Right. Anyone that knows me in Jamaica knows that I'm not No fool. That's, you gotta get something in there because you know this bad luck. No, I tried to play it off. Fuck you. You, I tried to play it off.


But you yo bro. I cheers man. Yo. I Was like, because think about it. I couldn't cry while I was in prison. I had to take care of my family. Right. My parents, my children, a lot of people around me, plus the guys that I was charged with. So I had no time to be weak. 'cause all of them was coming to me. Oh Jesus, guys, when when you coming out, You know what? Emini here. So I had to be strong for everyone. Tj. Tj. There is even a meme in Jamaica where I say ask tj. Yeah. Because when he used to call me, like, well, think about this.


I'm in prison. Yeah. Sending money to my bank, to Western Union to people in America. Wow. The people in England. Look, that's my responsibility. And I had to do it right. People were dying around me. We were fucking in prison. Losing money. Money. So, but yeah man. Like I have, I was fighting for my freedom, for my life, for my health. Right. To keep my family together. To keep my woman from giving away the pussy. That's A serious No bro Is back. She moved on. Come on. That's Serious, man. She actually moved on. No, I don't. No, no. I moved on. Take care of her.


Oh, okay. I still take care of her. My baby mama. Okay. Alright. I'm a Jamaican. You either a fucking asshole or you're a good person in Jamaica. There's no in the middle. Listen, you either a fucking pussy or you are a real one. That's what Jamaica make vibes, Vibes on some New York shit. Yeah. How, How does sad feel about you taking care of all the baby moms? Well, initially she was not cool. But when I explained it to her and she saw Right. The predicament my family was in. 'cause remember, you know, I'm the breadwinner. I made the millions. We talking about us now. Yes. I made the millions.


Yes. Why would I want to see my baby mom suffer even though when I was in prison going through the worst time of my life, she let me die. But it's human nature. Right. If you don't believe in forgiveness, you're a fucking bro. You shouldn't even be alive, bro. Wow. For real. We made mistakes, bro. Yeah. Okay. You, you alright? You believe in forgiveness. So why? Of course. Why you didn't just stay with her then? Because I'm a man first. And I told her I was there with you. I'm like, I'm coming out. I'm coming out. I lost my trial.


She was there. I'm coming out. I lost my Jamaican appeal. She was there. I'm coming out. But before the British appeal could happen, she just gave it. And I Can't blame her for that. I'm, if she was in prison, I would be fucking bitches the first day she got arrested. Right. So how can I, so how can I hate her? Think about this. We're a man. Think about, bro, fuck, fuck. Think about this. If she had got arrested on the 1st of January after I brought her fucking things to the jail, you would've went to The third. No. The First.


So we gotta keep it real. And that's what the problem with a lot of us as black people, Our egos are High. And I get it. We've been through a lot. So we need to prove, you know this Frank Macho and fucking Tom don't need to prove shit. Right. But, but Jay Juan and fucking Omar need to prove shit. Right. 'cause that's how we were raised. We need to prove, I don't need to prove nothing Here.

She made me calm, she made me not need not feel the need to fucking, oh, I'm, you know what Emini here? She she made you, that's the thing. I met her 2015, July 25th. I'll never forget. Okay. And, and that time, I, I'm saying before that me and my baby mama was going through a lot. I did an album for short. It's, it's literally called to Tanisha. 'cause her, her, her government is Tanisha and the album is to Tanisha. One of the biggest albums in the Caribbean. Any person from the Caribbean can tell you about that album.


Just fucking go on the phone right now. Did Cartel do an album called to Tanisha, right? They yeah. She nearly mad him. I love, even now, but Saddam was there And I, that's why when they asked me the question about loyalty was easy to answer. Right. That doesn't mean that shorty was disloyal. Right. She was just human. Right. That's real. Right. Fn, yeah. She was just human. I, 10 years, 11 years, he's not coming out. But I'm gonna be there for him. 'cause she always represented I could call her any hours.


3:00 AM in the morning, surely wake up, take this money here. And she would go, how? Come on, man, bro, at what point we're gonna be men? And be like, bro, you fucked up. 'cause she didn't send me to prison. Mm. That was me. Wow. Yeah. That's d She didn't send me to prison, bro. She was calling me. Come home, we need to fuck Man, those calls are amazing, Nori, you, you get what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. So she didn't send me, she never called nobody or Oh, he's, he's beating me.


Fuck him. No, I went on my own. So what am I gonna do, bro? Her and, and this is a thing too in Jamaica, a lot of times, like a lot of men in prison, their woman is cheating on them. They just send someone to, to kill her. Ooh. To kill her and to kill the chick and The man. Yeah. Man, that's, it's, it's surreal in Jamaica. Whoa. I'm not even making that up. 'cause Jamaica rough. Yeah. Why would I want to hurt my, my children's mother? She made me know that my dick was working because she gave me my first children. Right.


Yeah. Yeah. And even a lot of time, even sad them is like, oh, I think you still love her. I'm like, yes, I love her, but I adore you and d Love it's a different, different Love. Yeah, I do. Yeah. You can have d Yeah, that's, that's real. She made me know that I was a man And I could have get kids. So I love her And I understand what she went through. Even bro, even people that love me gave up. Come on prison. 13 years, bro. No, she's your family. You got kids with family. But you was, I got 33 years. Yeah. So that's life. That's life. 33 years. Yeah. That's life to everyone else.


And maybe you don't get out. If something goes wrong in prison, you might not get out. That's my problem. And she needs the doggy style thing. Human nature. Human nature. That's, that's human nature. So I can, I could not be angry. Right. I understand. I'm grown. I'm a, I'm grown. I, I got arrested when I was 35. Ah. So over the, And I, I learned to appreciate God more and be more spiritual. That's why you see on my forehead, I have love God. Wow. If you look here, I dunno if you can see it.


You see Devil, devil. That was me back in the day. That's, that's my, that was my nickname. Look, you see it? Yeah. That was My, did you feel that you really embodied that, Bro? I was crazy. That's why I got in so much trouble. Mm. You was wilding out. So I was fucking wilding out. Two, three point fuck A million point. Oh. So you don't have, because Jamaica's no joke. You don't, you can't come on and say on the track, you are a gangster and you're not. Right. Right. You gotta go. Especially back in those days. Right. For real. You know what, Emini here, I, I like that girl who is, nobody knows Jamaica's getting in trouble.


She knows what's up. But that's what I'm saying. Like, that's why I never stopped saying God is the greatest Nori. God saved me. No one could save me. I was in prison. Right. GP in Jamaica, tower Street. That's the number one prison. You see guys hang themselves. Right. You see guys, you know, steel, like that steel thing. You see guys sharpen that steel and just push it through   You dead. Damn. Don't push through s that doesn't even make the news shit. Right. That those even make the news. That's what Jamaican prisoners are. 'cause I know Americans see they have the toughest prisons, nigga. You don't, we have the toughest prisons.


People die every day. But God said, bro, 'cause I take care of a lot of people. 'cause I learned from Bounty killer. So I pay forward And I prayed. I was like, at one point I didn't even pray for tj. Yo lie, God, ask tj, you couldn't tell me nothing about God. I was God. That's what I wanted to ask you. That's how big I was in Germany. I was God, you did that. God was like, nigga, you're not, well sit down in this fucking dungeon. Wow. Then he ma he gave me that epiphany.


Like, bro, chill. I gave you the blessing. E even them this, I, I was helping a lot. People like popcorn, comely, God's a slim, et cetera. My parents Russian, not nice. Jordan fucking Birch kid's, mother, everybody. And God was like, bro, you need to slow down. If I didn't, that's why I told you. No regrets. 'cause if, if I didn't go to prison, I know I would've been dead. You know what, Emini here, you got a second chance. Yeah. I got a second chance. And I, I won't fuck up bro. I'm not fucking up. No. Okay. Do it. How the fuck do I fuck up 13 years in prison, come out, get my US visa, get my European visa, get my British visa, making these millions us motherfucker, fuck off.


I'll be an idiot bro. Yeah. And even that, and why I, why I think I got a second chance. 'cause even when I was crazy, I still had that love and that respect for people. 'cause if you good, we good. If you are a gangster, we not good. 'cause maybe you wanna hurt me and I'm not gonna give you that chance. Right. You know what, Emini here. But yeah. So that, that's my mindset since day one. So I have no problem giving you your props 'cause you can stop me, you know? And I don't want to stop. You get it. You can stop me And I don't want to stop you. 'cause we can both be rich.


We can both have you a lot of money for everybody. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. We can both drive the Rolls Royce and we can both have a million women without even touching one of yours. So that's my mindset since day one, bro. Like every man has, like Bob Marley said, every man have Right. We decide there own destiny. Destiny. You have the right to decide your destiny, bro. I can't fuck with yours. Yeah. And you can't fuck with mine. If, if, if it comes a time when that's gonna happen, you go your ways. Yeah. And I go mine and we good. You, you, you reach over South Miami.


I'm rich in North Miami. Mm. That's it. That's how it goes, man. So I, I don't, I I don't harbor any bad feelings for no human. None. I've been through it man. We've been through the wars, the gangster shit. Everything. I'm 49 years old now. You, what the fuck you going to, what can you prove to me? You can't prove nothing to me. Nothing. I'm from Jamaica, bro. You don't need to prove anything either. Exactly. I'm from Jamaica. None In my mind. I'm from Jamaica too. Huh? In my mind, I'm from Jamaica too. I'm From New York.


Hell fucking me man. I'm telling you man. Big up Queens. That's right. Big up Queen. Getting back to the music a little bit. Yes. What songs of yours do you think changed the trajectory of your career? The first song was, good Question. New Millennium 2002. Which changed dancehall because the song was saying, this are a new millennium. A different things are going. Meaning this is the new Millennium, the different things going on. That's what it says. So that's one Tech Body, which was my first song on Billboard in New York.


Okay. Then Tech Body Gal, second song. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Then me and the Acon and the Sha Ranks. And the Sizzler album. What if you this bagman. Exactly. You know what's up Then Ramping Shop. Then Clark, ah, Fort Mormon and then Fever 2016 while I was in. While you was in prison. That song was on rotation in 97. Yeah. On Fucking Power 1 0 5. How did that feel while you were in jail, bro? I'm on the fucking app watching everything. Mm. Hype. Popping in champagne in prison.


I had a fucking bust down Rolex. I had a fucking day because Jamaica crazy bro. I had my Rolex in prison. Big chin pen down with anything. Want lobster, shrimp, champagne, anything. Yeah. But it's still prison. Right? Still prison. Right. No doubt. That can't leave when I want. Yeah, of course. Still prison. It is what it is. But those songs, when I saw gold in prison, I had my fucking plaque in my cell, like Ros crawling on it and shit. Ros was crawling on my fucking gold plaque, Bro. That's crazy. I'm telling you.


That's A scene, yo. Yeah. Roaches was crawling on my plaque And I was like, your blood clot. Hurry up. Listen, Listen. You need to put your movies together, Bro. Netflix. And that's what I'm saying, when is the Netflix general? That's what I'm saying. Grammy fucked up this year. No disrespect to them, but the story. Come on. I'm coming from prison 13 years. Get my visa. I'm engaged. I'm behaving myself. I sold gold. The album that I did was nominated was done in prison. Rammy should have took a yes. It's an amazing story. Norie. Yes. It's beautiful.


I Love it. And with that being said, I want to piss of stuff. Where is the magic De? We Got one. Why couldn't And we got one over there. Right there, right there. Like Emini here. That's trajectory. Yeah. Yeah. I don what you said. Rock You. Oh man. Not Chile. You need a light. Give S the light. Sean Paul, gimme the light. The light. Sean Paul from Jamaica for sure. Right? Not Puerto Rico.


Sean Paulman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, Portman. Yeah. Sean Paul is town. That means For the privileged part Privilege. 'cause in Jamaica we don't have racism. Mm. We have classism. But that's for another interview. I respect That. I'm passionate about that. 'cause I'm from the ghetto. Oh. And I live uptown And I, my kids are born and raised. Uptown. Uptown went to the best schools. Everything. You know how that Yes. That's, they better, you know what, Emini here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So God damnit, that's a serious topic in Jamaica too. Classism. Serious colorism. Right. Skin bleaching, all that. Right. I was Just gonna say that because I remember when you was rehearsing for your show.


'cause I follow you. So yeah, you was talking about we gonna do the, The, the bleach Cartel. Bleach. Bleach block cartel and the bleach arts cartel. Yes. The way you use the fucking burn the fucking melanin. Yes. And like you're trying to kill God. Do you regret that at All? I told I regret nothing. Okay. Because that if you win, you either win or learn when you loses when you die. And we still don't know where you go when you die. Even though I'm religious. And What those lessons are from your Negative, from, from life, from Your negatives. You know What, Emini here. So I never believe in losses. So I couldn't have regrets.


And I've lost people that I love. But I can't regret The reason why I ask that because Kodak Black and he had a, he had a song, he and super Gremlin. He said, you know, I know the perk was fake, but I still ate it because I'm, I was a gremlin. Perk is in Perk. Yeah, I know. You Know what I'm saying? So See how deep that was. And he regretted that to a degree. The influence of that. You No, but I understand that. But think about this. I already drank like four bottles of fucking Of female. How can I regret it? I can't change it. Right, right. You can't go back. You can't go back. Gotcha. But the only thing I can do from that is like, don't drink from beautiful women.


I'm giving her props. Come on. Yeah. Okay. So if I forward, if I got fucked up, No Emini here. If I went outside, it was like about don't drink from beautiful women. That was the lesson alert. So it was the L That was the L. It's not the loss, it's the lesson. 'cause once you alive, it's not a loss, it's a lesson. And if it's a lesson, it's a blessing. If It's a lesson, it's a lesson. Shit, Bro. I was in last Year them times I was in fucking prison. What the Fuck you talking about? I'm in for America. Yeah. And I'm rich. Yeah, that's right. Sure. Rich.


Exactly. Shot to that shit. Oh, oh yeah. What happened? You No, bro. Like I say, even Massacre said it the other day when I was in prison And I was so much in my, my positive energy that I understood it. You know what Massacre said, I'm bigger massacre. You should interview him too. He's a, he's a big artist in Jamaica. Yep. Yes. He said, nobody can spoil my day. Why would I give you that energy? Mm. I just came out of prison bro. 13 years. I watched my children. They come from boys to men and not the group from fucking Phil.


Not The group. Big them up. Yeah. Salud shot Boston. They From Boston. Oh, you shot? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. I thought it was Philly. What the fuck? I'm losing it. Boston. Where's my shot? No, No, no. They're from Philly. They Are? Yeah. I think, no, no Ud Salud to being wrong. That got me then. Oh shit. That's why your coffee's empty. Yeah. That's why much shit empty. I know. Oh, we taking shots. Yeah, we taking shots. Well, oh. Oh. He just said shot in there. I know. He said shut The clock. We doing that Rose. Yeah, but you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't. You know your history. Maybe have a bad day. I have, you know your history. That's why I'm so big in music.


I'm a student. I'm a student of the music. You are a student first. Before The teacher. Listen, before this guy right here, you be a student. My little brother right here. You always say, yo, I'm a student of hip hop. That's what, not yo y that Listen, come on. Yeah. On enough love. I respect to you. Respect. Yeah man, you gotta be up. They got, fuck that don't count. You gotta sip when you, you Yeah. Big up. Big up. It's, it's American. Let's do it again. Yeah. It's one of the T-shirts. And because he was the student. That's right. Big up. So I want to ask another question. You brought up massacre, you know, so Mass.


As far as dance hall right now, who would you think is like the top contenders and also like the defendant champions of Dance Love? Well, massacre is one popcorn. And I'm not just saying that because he's my protege, but I'm also saying that because he's my protege. So he learn from the best. Right. You went to Harvard, nigga, you fucking qualified. So Garza Nation is the Harvard Gaza Nation of Dance Hall. So popcorn, that school then I like, like the younger kids after pop like Jamal and the, and I'm gonna get into that in a minute.


So you have the Jamal, the Pablo, Theran la the skill bank. The, the, the, the Ani, you know, Emini here, the four 50. And you know, a lot of people gonna come at me, especially Gaza fans. But he might, he's he represents for the culture. The alkaline. Right. The alkaline. Yeah. The squash. You can't leave off squash. Can't leave off squash. Not time. You know what, Emini here. So for me, the kids, I, I have to respect them. 'cause when I was coming up, I got a lot of flack. Like, oh, he, him don't sound like dance. Like they're trying to say I'm not dance, I'm, I'm something else.


Right. Right. So we always have to represent for the gen. 'cause I stand on the, on the shoulders of giants. Right. I stand on the bon to kill shoulder. Right. Banta being a man, regardless of what you want to say about me. Right. Right. I'm a student of fucking dancehall. That's right. And dancehall is forever. Right. The culture for the vulture for the culture. Some big, big tic killer who made me Rich. Big Banton, biggest inspiration Ninja man. My first inspiration Super Cat, the Jersey wheel.


Mm. Big Youth Michigan are Smiley. Don English. He passed away the other day. Mm. You know what Emini here, he's the first person who told my mom that I'm gonna be rich. Then she gave me the key. 'cause they used to lock me out at night. So when I went to the stage show at night, I couldn't go in because my mom was like, blood clot. You know what? And my dad was like, you blood clot too. Which means also. Right. And then my mom, when Danny English said to my mom, 'cause he got Oh, then English. Yeah. They have a meme with me and him on the internet where everything I want to confirm.


I say ask dj. Dj. Oh did that nigga. Oh me And he at the party. He was the first person to tell my mother that your son is gonna be famous. And that, that made, that brought tears to my mother's eyes. So, and he died the other day. So r the peace man, please give him a round of applause. Rest of peace. Rest in peace. Big ups as well. 'cause they rolled together and big up ignorant. So bro, that salt for me is everything. No. That I believe in it. It, it made a lot of us famous. The and Rich Varda cartel.


Ty be like Terry Zi. Even all the guys. You asked me questions about why you think I have to take the Ra raaga because, because I'm not going to depict. 'cause all of them older than me influenced me. And the ones that I gave fame, they inspired me. So I could never like Tia. Yeah. Scatter. Oh, that's scatter. And I'm gonna be, I don't know if you guys understand. Yeah. Say it in Jamaica. We did the Freedom Street concert the 31st of December. So that went into the 1st of January, which is the first day of the year.


I get the first. And in Jamaica, no, hold on in Jamaica, I suck. Your mother is like saying, your mother is a whore. Go suck your mother. God dang fuck. And, and, And I look how deep this is. Scatter is my, is my big bro. Because Skea was famous when I was fucking hungry. You know how that was. So he's my big bro. Pop Con is my son. Pop Con gave him the first soccer mother for the year. So, you know, I'm conflicted. Right. But I spoke Tokata, he was very mature about it.


Popcorn was very remorseful about it. Very important. Yeah. And everything. But, but that, that's when he became a meme. What was, What was in your mind? Because people haven't this the first time you're talking about it after that. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. What was in your mind when he was holding the mic? Well, you saw my face. I was, I was shocked. Yeah. Because I never expected Right. Popcorn to say that. It's like you invite me to a party. Huh? Why would, and say you invite me to a party, but before you invited me to the party, me and bus rhyme had beef. Right. This is, we just creating a scenario. Why would I come to your party and say, bus rhyme, suck your mother.


This is the biggest this in Jamaica. Yeah. That means I don't respect you. But this is, here's the flip side. You watch that movie with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Here's the flip side to that coin. Popcorn felt violent because he was coming to represent for the man that made him rich. Exactly. Like real rich. 'cause you know, puppies in like five Cartel, my father level like real rich. Yeah. When we say millions we mean us. And then we had to be at the gate for two hours. But then I had to explain to him after the, the show like Pap, you understand this is Jamaica the excitement and everyone wants to prove.


So if you're a security guard and fn and, and, and Coon is coming through, maybe you have a fucking I know I'm fucking, I don mind. I don. Okay, well watch this. Watch this. That was, I did that on purpose. Emini didn't, Hold on, Hold on. This is where get serious now.

And don't take it. The people you love don't take them for granted. Mm. Right. You can't. And I'll tell you something. Fend I've, 'cause Jamaica Prison is, is strange.


It's like the gangster scene in Jamaica. Mm. Five people will die here Kingston. But when you watch the news, right? You, you only hear about the one person that died in Montego Bay. Oh. Or in Rio. Mm. So you gotta take life seriously. The people you love. You gotta spend it with him. You know what my biggest Fett is? And my first son, I had him, who's the oldest, trusted the studio with, you know, when you get that son, the, your first child is a son. So I'm with him in the studio. I'm changing his, changing his diapers. I'm doing all of that.


But what I regret the most is not spending more time with him. Who's the oldest? Little Vibes? No l Yeah. Liquor vibe. Alright. But this is the good thing about it. Liquor vibes gave me two grandchildren. So now I have the opportunity. Gave another chance. Yes. Giving me another chance. Yes. The second chances, man. Yes. God is the greatest girl I believe in God, bro. When I was, even if you watch my, a lot of my old interviews. Yes. That's what the Wilford I know. 'cause you were J American. Yes. He's like Lord and Mercy. Yeah.


So he knows what's up. Yes. I used to say, bro, whatever, X, x, X, now I believe in like my son, I didn't get to to raise him. He gave me two grandchildren. Mm. Raise them. Yes. I know I can raise a granddaughter and a grandson. So I'm like, that's a Blessing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like my Grandson, make Sure you get a lot of pussy. I'm like to my granddaughter, if You ever you Jamaican double standard. Yeah. Double standards 2.0. But, but seriously though, it's like he gave me a new lease on life to be able to, because, and this is, I'm going to tell you, I'm gonna be honest.


Before I got arrested, I never believing God as a concept being in prison. And like I said, I put the 2 38 on my on. Where is it? 2 38. Where is it? Tattoo? I don't even know. Look, where is it? 2 38 and left's. All right Q right there, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't study Norman Q Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Got got him these nuts, right?


Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. But I said this. No, no disrespect, Right? What I'm gonna say this, I knew that I was gonna come out, but at the time I needed that extra energy because a lot of people were depending on me. Not just the guys that I was arrested with, but my mother, my father, my, my children, my cousins, my aunts, my uncles. Remember this is Jamaica. This is not fucking Wall Street shit. This is Jamaica.


So I had to put my, my faith in something other than us. And that's when I got more spiritual, more religious and started focusing. And that's when I tattooed the thing on my face. Love God. I don't know if you can see it, man. I see. Yeah. What's Your name? S. S Right. R says Ross The blood. Ye man Watchman.


But, but that's when I became more spiritual because I used to go to church like most Jamaicans. 'cause Jamaicans have the most churches per square capital. Really? Of course. Yeah. You know what, you know what beats it the most? Bars. And I'm not even joking, like literally bars bes the churches. No, not bes, but bars. Like where you go to have drink, drink rum, cha, whatever, the most bars. There's bar churches. Yes. Yes. But, but just by a slight, because think about this. We have the most churches per capita in The World. Right. The only thing that beats that Wow. Is bars.


That's why you see the, the, what's the word, the ous nature of Jamaica. The discrepancy. Yeah. Discrepancy. So on one side of Jamaica, you party and you're in a tourist country and you're enjoying yourself and nobody fucking knew you. And on the other side, 53 people die in two days murder. Damn. So tell so crazy. It is 53 people die between Monday and between Friday and Sunday. But when you are in Montego Bay not, and not the the real Montego Bay, you're in the resort. The resort.


Right. The safe zone. You could, right. But when you go back to America and you go on Google, you see that 53 people died between Friday and Sunday by murder. It's crazy man. So Tell me something. Since you've been out, what have you seen change the climate of Jamaica? Nothing. Just the love for me. 'cause my thing is this. Why are you shooting people? Because you have no other option. You were in school and you were, you could paint very well, you could draw Jay-Z and he looked like Jay-Z.


But because no one cared about that and you lived in fucking Flatbush. No opportunities. No opportunities. So you just started to shoot. You're a man fucking people. You, you are gunman or you're a bad man. Right. And it feels good. You know why it feels good because you're a man and many need purpose. Get respect. Men need respect and we need purpose. So you find your purpose. 'cause you do it very well. Run upon niggas and shoot them. Is it right? No, but all you had left was purpose. I like this. You found it with your gun the same way we found it after the gun with the microphone.


Music with the microphone. Right. Jordan funny with the basketball, but he goes punk, you want a picture with Jordan? Nigga fuck nigga pay me. That's why I have no problem with Jordan. 'cause I understand his mindset. Is it wrong or right? That's for people to decide. But I understand the mindset of the land. 'cause we, we, I grew up in the ghetto. Right. And I understand how it works. And if you don't understand that, man, you naive as fuck, you need to live in Colorado. You know what Emini here go skiing in the fucking winter. Or some chick. Aspen, Colorado. Aspens in some shit. You know what Emini here, I love Colorado weed.
