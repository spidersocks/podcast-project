No. I can tell you one of the prizes will be $150. Yes. So we're gonna be giving away at least $150 for our hundred and 50 episodes. So we need to figure it out soon. Yes. How to tell people to get involved Exactly. In our giveaway. Yep. Exactly. But so when I say we're gonna do it soon, Lord only knows right enough. No, we gonna do it. Y'all just like Giselle was supposed to give all y'all people who have listened to ev every single episode. Something. No. A hundred. Remember it was a hundred. It was a hundred people. No. People who listened to all hundred episodes.


100 episodes. They're supposed to get something. Was that one at 100? I Yeah. No, it wasn't. No it wasn't. At 7,500. You just randomly said it one day. Anyway. Robin didn't give you on nothing. So it was not on me. It was on Robin. Yeah. Like, how do we confirm that? Okay. So outside of, well, You know my mama listened and she's still waiting for her gift. Oh, right. And her hats Robin. Okay. All right. Well, before you leave I'll give you some, okay, fine. Okay. Okay. Anyway, mama, or just gimme her address and I'll ship 'em to her. I'm just gonna send you her address. There we go. Mama, your hats are coming from Robin. Not me. Only two years later. Anyway, moving on. I have a Reasonably Shady moment. Oh, okay. Please, you tell I do.


Okay. Or do you wanna go first? No, you go. Okay. So remember I told you I was in, I was in Hawaii Yes. For my vacation. Yes. So all over the both resorts, they had little stations for you to fill up your water. And the the thing said it was purified seven times. Okay. And said it had minerals in it, and it had something, coconut came from the volcanoes and all that. It came from, it came from straight from the volcanoes. I was like, yeah, whatever. So I started drinking the water, Robin, I never peed so good in my life.


What? What? You never peed. So good. Listen. Now. Don't that sound crazy. Yeah. My pee was everything. What? I would wake up in the middle of the night, And, I would pee like five gallons. Like I would just pee it all out. It was amazing. So I said to myself, I haven't been drinking the right water. Okay. Right. Okay. So the next day I remember I made a mental note. Yeah. I'm gonna go take a picture of the whole system and I'm going buy it. Oh, shoot. So the system is called flow water, not flow water, like flow water that you can buy at Whole Foods. Okay. Right. Okay. This, the whole system is called flow water. Okay. So I looked it up. Okay. And I'm, I'm on it. Yeah. I'm going to purchase it. Okay.


Okay. And I'm going to have amazing water filtered in my house. Okay. It's purified seven times. Okay. You, are you getting jealous? Yes, you should. Yeah. Okay. So anyway, the shady part is, okay, why the hell are we drinking this dumb ass water? Everybody should be drinking this flow water. Okay. Because lit. I lost weight in the, in the 10 days I was there. What? Maybe two weeks I lost weight. Is she talking about, I promise you I lost weight. I peed amazingly. What, what does that mean? It means, what does that mean? That pee was flowing? I don't know. It's the p the pee was flowing. So you peed more often at night. It was weird.


I don't wanna pee more often at night. I wasn't mad at it. I would get up and it was, I was just peeing. Oh, it was amazing. I felt so good in the morning. In the morning I felt great. Okay. None of my bones hurt. Not that they ever do what? Not that my joints hurt. Not that they ever do. And I was just a better person. Right. Nice. So nothing was different. My skin looked better. It's always beautiful. Right. But that's not the point, Robin. I promise you every water that we drink, because You know when you go to It's garbage. It's garbage. You know when we go to other countries that food is better. Yes. Same thing. Yeah. Their water is better. Not that Hawaii's a different country, but they You know. Yes. Right. They have their own stuff. Yeah. They own their own stuff.


Yeah. So anyway, the shadiness is all the water that we drink. So you're getting the filtration system. Yes. And what it, is it, like, what do you attach it to? Is it out you put it? Like where do you put it? I don't know what, I don't know anything. Okay. But it costs a lot of money. And I can afford it. Okay. Okay. The end. Okay. I'm gonna afford that. When you get it, bring me a bottle of Yes. That you water. You sound like some other people in my life, they're like, oh, I'm gonna come over and just like, fill up, fill up a couple jugs. I mean, if that's yes. If that's what it's, what it's like, I'm gonna do that too. Yes. Yeah. I, I'm going to And You know it'll save on. But you have your, your water thing here.


Yes. But it'll, like for me, I have, I buy the bottle, so it'll save me for doing from doing that. Yeah. But I, yes, I will fill up something in, let you try. Now you gotta get your Stanley cup. Hell no. I don't believe in Stanley cups. Why? I just think it's a, it's a racket, but it's not. I mean, that would come useful. Yeah. No. So what are you gonna put your water in? I don't know yet. That's, let me, I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna let y'all know like a Stanley Cup would, would do the job, by the way. PSA on the Stanley Cups and just any other cup. So they have like a long straw to that you drink outta Yes. Or they have like a opening. PSA If. you care about your wrinkles around your mouth and stuff. Don't drink outta straws because that action can speed up your wrinkling process around your lips.


Wow. That's when you get all like the little wrinkles around your mouth. Wow. I gotta tell Grace that. Yeah. So dope. Yeah. Tell all grace. Oh, especially all the little young girls, if they're drinking through the straw. I mean, it's similar to like people who smoke cigarettes when you do that, that motion. Yes. Yes. That's just causing more wrinkles around your lips. Wow. Okay. That's good to know. Yeah. Great. PSA. Yeah. So I, so I don't use the straw on my Stanley Cup. I just drink out of the opening. Right. And then that will stop all these girls from getting Botox so young. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And then men can be happy. 'cause we're just natural. All the men can be happy. We're just like natural. Right. Exactly. Yes. So, since You know what I had a, i I wasn't gonna share this shady moment, but since you were talking about your water in, which leads to me, to my water.


So I get water delivered from Mountain Valley water, which is like supposed to be one of the best waters. It is. And it's, yes. And it's, it's bottled in glass bottles. Okay. So we get, we'll get two cases of 12 gas glass bottles. But I also get the big jugs delivered. Okay. I get two or three big jugs at a time. And you put 'em in like the, the, the, I don't know what it's called, the dispenser and the, and the water comes out, whatever. So they delivered my water. They're really heavy. So we came in one day and Juan told Corey to bring in the jugs of water.


How many, how many do you have delivered at one time? So it was like two, two big jugs and two cases of water. Okay. So Cory goes and lifts up the big jug and he's walking it, bring it through the garage, and he drops that big ass glass jug of water. And there is like, to this day, we are still cleaning up glass shards all like, we're gonna be cleaning up glass in my garage for like a year. It's just, oh, it shattered. It shattered. Just imagine like a big jug of water made out of glass.


I'm sorry. I'm, I'm actually happy he didn't drop it on his foot. Yes. But, 'cause he'd broken his toe. Yes. And, I amm. Kind of happy that it happened. Why? Because I already told Juan, I think it's a little too heavy for him. Like, not that it's Oh, so it's, it's heavy, but it's cumbersome. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So like, even though Corey strong, I just feel like at his age, yeah, he was, he's not like, I don't know. He, he just wasn't like, mature enough to really like, handle it properly. Yeah. It's probably a two man job. No, it's not. I mean, I can do it. I can do it, but it's heavy. Okay. Like, you really have to like, get a good grip on it.


And sometimes it's wet. Oh. So sometimes it's slippery. And, I think it was slippery. 'cause it was outside in the rain. Yeah. Yeah. He dropped that big old ju But I was kind of like, I told you he can't handle that You know because You know as parents, like the debate becomes like the mom is always sticking up for the kids. Yes. And the dad is always like, you don't never have my back. So I was like, okay, just keep my mouth shut. Okay. Yes. And then when he dropped it, I was like, Hmm. Yeah. Mm. I didn't think he could carry that. Yeah, I did to tell you. But You know, so. No, but there's like glass shards all in my garage. So what, what part is shady Juan telling him to go get it. Corey dropping it.


Yes. Juan making Cory. Okay. Take that big ass heavy ass glass bottle of water into my house. Well, we know that's not gonna happen again. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's over. I wasn't mad at Cory at all. Like Juan was mad at Cory, but I was not. I was like, Hmm. Told you. Okay. I wanna give a shout out to this restaurant in Alabama. 'cause I've never heard of such And. I was like highly impressed. So there is a black-owned family style restaurant in Alabama that has no prices. Okay. No prices. Okay. And they feed anyone who is hungry. Okay. So basically they're living off donations. Ah. So let's, so, and it's like, I don't wanna say an honor system, because you don't have to pay.


Right. But they have been doing this forever. It's called Drexel and Honeybees in Bruton, Alabama is a unique black owned restaurant with a donation only policy. Oh. They're open Tuesday to Thursday. And the founders are Freddie and Lisa Thomas McMillan. And they serve southern comfort food, like fried chicken, corn bread. And they ensure that no one leaves hungry Even before the doors open. The energy at Drexel and Honeybees is buzzing. This restaurant operates on donations only. Their motto is simple.


We feed the need. I just wanted to do something to show people that money does not, does not make The World go around. Wow. I think that's phenomenal. That is, yeah. That's phenomenal. And they must have enough patrons that they pay You know enough for them to make a profit. Yeah. And, and they make their, it's enough for 'em to make a profit enough for them to, to survive and also to feed anyone who wants to eat. Yes. And, and, and If you don't If you can't afford it. Yeah. They, some people just leave a thank you note. Right. Wow. That's really nice. That's crazy. In this day and age. Yes. The amount that, like how much food costs now? Wow.


Food. Food is expensive. It's crazy. Yes. Food is ridiculously expensive. But I can't just, Ima like, for me, I, knowing that about this restaurant, I would go there and just give them way more. Right. So there's probably some people that do that. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. But just the fact that you're being able to feed everybody is right. Fantastic. How long they been in business? Goodness. I, I don't know, but it sounds like a while. So shout out to and, and if you're in that area, go there. Yeah. And even If, you don't eat. Give 'em some money. Right. Exactly. They doing God's work. I hope the food is good. I don't care if it's good. I do. I mean, yeah. We want the food to be good, but I'm thinking it's good. They, in Alabama, they making soul food. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. Yeah.

And for that last few episodes, people have been going ham about them dears, since y'all cannot say it. I will them dears. Thank you. D Brown.


I needed, I needed to say that. Right? I needed to say that. 'cause You know I have figured out a way and I'm gonna tell D Brown If. you put, remember I said Zest? Yeah. Zest. Have you tried it? I haven't. I saw you got the stuff over your Yeah, I have the, the net over. Which is cute. Yeah. Yeah. It works. My landscaper just did that on his own. So you didn't, I was like, look at Robin getting fancy You know I didn't do that. So, so Robin has nets over her flowers to protect them from the deer. If. you put zest down that deters the deer. But I think my zest has gone away. 'cause I saw a deer lately. I saw one Really? And I was like, actually I'm lying. It was when I was on vacation. It was on my ring camera. Okay. And. I started screaming in the ring camera.


Uhuh. Go away. Go away. Here go My kids stop. Mom, stop. Like, they tried to protect the deer. Anyway. Did it run? Did it run? It did not. Okay. Okay. It kind of, yeah, it stopped for a second and then it, it slowly left. Yeah. Took its time. Yeah. They're not scared of humans anymore. No, they're not. I was taking a walk the other day and they were literally walking next to me. Really? Yes. And I was like, so I had to like, pull my camera out just in case they attacked me. You know? Like, why?

But he chose to propose to her at Bell Mountain, where he used to have his rendezvous. What? To my knowledge, he is his now fiance, had never been there before until he proposed.

Oh, Mimi got another reasonable or shady. Okay. Okay. Our girl, Mimi, she's always emailing us with the interesting scenarios.


Yeah. And she always tries to say they're not her. Right. But Mimi, I don't know if I believe you girl. She said, this is not my situation Giselle, but I need your thoughts on this situation. Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is like a dating scenario. It says, I took this female out to eat about two weeks ago. And I tested her. Ooh. We ordered our food and had a nice time just talking over food and getting to know each other. I'm not gonna front, I was feeling shorty not just because she was beautiful, but her mindset is what got me. Ah. But when we were done eating And I asked for the bill, the lady came back with it. I said, damn, I left my wallet at home. You think you can pay for the food? And I will give you the money back when I get home.


She just got up and left. All I can do was laugh and shake my head. But I go in my pocket and pay for the bill and leave a $10 tip. Okay. Okay. How did, how did he go in his pocket? I thought he left his wallet down. 'cause he's testing her. Oh. The lady said thank you and you are a very smart man. Sometimes you have to test them to see if they are the one or not. I never spoke to her after that. Was she reasonable or shady for getting up and walking out or was he reasonable or shady for testing her? He was shady for testing her. Yeah. She was reasonable for leaving. Right. And I hate him. Right. Why would you do that? Because, okay, so I feel like whether he was testing her all, so let's say he really didn't have his wallet.


Right. Right. Yeah. That's that deserve, you deserve to be walked out on. Yes. Okay. What man takes a woman out on a date without his wallet. Right. So you deserve to be walked out on. Or if the woman is like, You know what? This dude is tested to me. And I don't like that. No. None of it is good. None of it is good. So she was reasonable. The woman was reasonable Yes. For walking out. Yes. Even though I, I probably, I probably wouldn't. You have shady up the woman shady up. Oh no, I'm sorry. Reasonable. Okay. Oops. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. We got our paddles. Yeah. The woman was reasonable. Yes. For walking out. Right. The man was shady. Shady. F testing her shady.


Shady. Lemme tell you something that happened to me one time. Really? So I had been dating this dude for a minute and You know who he is. I'm gonna tell you later. Okay. And we had gone out And I think he just was drunk or something. Yeah. I don't know what had happened. I went to the bathroom. I come back from the bathroom. He's not at the table anymore. So the waiter comes over and he was like, Hey, I really don't wanna do this. But the guy that you were here with told me to tell you that he left and, and like You know for you to pay the bill. What? And I was like, what? I said, what do you mean? And so, because I was dating him, right. Like, and we got, we drove there together when he left me.


What? So anyway, after all of that I was like, sure, just gimme the bill. Right. He gives me the bill and I'm about to pay it and the dude pops out of a corner. He was like, oh no, Giselle. I just You know I got it. I just wanna see what, oh my God. Do You know that I shoulda have broken up with him right then? Yes. But I didn't, I continu to date this idiot. Are you, he, he was testing you. What, what, what test is this? I wanted to fail the shit. I want, I wanna fail every test like this You know what Yes. He just left. That's crazy. And the guy, so lemme tell you how cr how wild it was. The waiter was so uncomfortable.


He was like, I don't wanna get involved in this. Right. He was like, this is, this is not what I do. He's, and he didn't even, he was scared to even tell me that. The dude Yes. Quote left. Okay. So the rest of the dating relationship, like was that a, was that like a red flag for like the rest of the He never did that. He never did that again. But I remember like getting in the car to go home. Like I should have right there. Just took an Uber home and like never talked to him again. Yeah. I got, we got, we got in the car. And I. Don't know what happened. Did he think it was funny or he was testing you? He thought it was funny. Why? What part of that was funny? Right.


No part of that is funny, right? Yeah. Dude, you've lost And it Bye. The, I should have said bye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. But I did not. Anyway. This is, this is, we, we need to tell these guys out here. Don't ever do that. It's not cute. Yeah. It's not a test. It's not funny. If, you don't wanna pay if it's a first date. Like that's the impression you wanna leave on this woman. Right? Exactly. Yeah. And it's, I mean I, if I was in that scenario as the woman, I, I would not have just got up and, and left. I would've been like, oh, You know. I would've been a little more understanding. Yeah. But she's not wrong for leaving because, no. And it's because of dudes like that that we get up and leave. Yeah. Because y'all out here playing games for what?


Right. No one has time for this. Right. Right. Sheesh. And that's what's what creates mistrust in like dating relationships anyway. Right. I think people go into dating just automatically looking for the wrong thing. Like they're looking for, for red flags and bad signs instead of going into dating with an open mind. Yeah. You know. Yeah. And like, I need for guys to understand, women don't need you to eat like You. know what I'm saying? Well, there's some women that Oh, that do that, do that. That's true. Right. Or so then I take that back. Yeah. So maybe this right. Doesn't need for you to pay for my food. First of all, he left a $10 tip.


What? So so how much was the bill? The bill was what? 50? Yeah. So this is not, this is shenanigans. Like where were y'all eating? This is Mimi. Mimi, you lying. This was you, you went out on a date. This was Mimi. This had to have been like Fridays. It could have been Fri Yeah. For a 10 tip Applebee's. Right. Y'all both got the, they both got the special What was the special? The special cost what? $14. The soup salad. Appetizer. And I drink for and a drink for 9 99. And you get a drink two for one drinks. Get outta here, dude. Oh God. Leave us alone. I mean, this is what I asked for y'all to just Yeah. Stop. But there are some women that, that Wait, okay, go ahead.


That dude definitely date dudes just to go dinner. Just to go eat. Yeah. Which is And, I, And, I have heard a lot of guys say like, they're sick of it. They're sick of just constantly just taking women out to dinner. And then they don't, they never like see them again. I'm gonna digress real quick. Yeah. And then I'm gonna come out the rabbit hole. So I was talking to a guy and he said he, this has happened to three of his friends. Mm. 'cause I need for guys to be where Yeah. I'm letting y'all know I'm, I'm paying, I'm, I'm giving back. I, I I, y'all been mad at me about the beards. Now I wanna give back. Alright. It's your PSA, another a psa. Okay. So Guy has been at a bar, drinking, sees a beautiful woman, they get to chitchatting his last drink. He has, he gets to a ho they go to a room.


Whatever happened in that last drink. Oh. They put something in their drink. So the girl and the bartender in on it. Mm. He goes back to the room, doesn't remember a thing. He is robbed What?

I've definitely heard of that. Especially like guys in, like the athletes. Yes. Happens the athletes a lot. Yeah. And you and you don't see it coming, right? Yeah. So you can't put yourself in those situations. Wow. And You know. Yeah. Maybe get a beer. 'cause then, and then you take the top off. I don't know.


Try to figure out a way to Yeah. But somehow they're slipping. Oh yeah. Like you If you do it yourself. I don't, but that's crazy. You even have to, the the bartender is in on it. The bartender in on it. What? But but listen, that's a hustle. Right? I see. I I, when that was explained to me, I was like, oh, I get that. Yeah. And in my mind I'm like, how come I never thought of that? Right. That don't even have to sleep with the dude. No. They him out and taking his stuff. Listen, listen. Wow, y'all dudes out here. Y'all need to be careful if you're single and you're out here in the streets. Yeah. Be careful. Honestly, I feel like that's, that's a old trick in the book. Is it? Yeah.

Like when Juan was in the NBA, like Right. But it was probably not the, the bartender. Like the bartender being, being Oh yeah. Probably not the bartender. Yeah. Being I think is a new hustle. Yeah.
