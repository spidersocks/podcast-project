This is Dr. J. Check out my podcast. Just Heal with Dr. J on the Black Effect Podcast Network each and every Tuesday. Jess Heal is not just about understanding your mental health, it's about taking actionable steps toward healing and growth. Whether you just starting your mental health journey or looking to deepen your understanding, Just Heal with Dr. J provides the resources and inspiration you need to thrive. And that's powerful that you say that. I was a voice for you. Right? Do You think that a lot of men are in need of someone to speak for them because Absolutely can speak for Themselves? Absolutely. Because we're, we've been so silenced. We've been silenced as young boys, a boy can fall off a swing, fall off a, a slide hurt himself. And the first thing is, don't you cry. You better shut up. Don't cry. We're told to suck it up. And so when we hear another man speak our hearts posture, then we like he's going through that too. Each week, I will create a safe space for the guests to take the steps toward their healing and growth by empowering them to thrive on their wellness journey. If you are willing to let go of your ego and be willing to let go of what you had in mind, healing, mentorship, being coached, whatever that healing, whatever that modality, whatever that space looked like for you, I believe that it would really set you free. What you did for me was you gave a voice to my pain. Listen, to Just Heal with Dr. J from The Black Effect Podcast Network starting on Tuesday, April 22nd, on the iHeartRadio app, apple Podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.
