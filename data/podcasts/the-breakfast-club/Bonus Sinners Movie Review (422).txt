All right, so I told y'all that I was gonna get into my thoughts about Sinners, the movie by Ryan Coogler, because it is, it's insane. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. But let's get on into it. Sinners is a horror film starring Michael B. Jordan by Ryan Coler and Baby, I've seen the film twice. So the opening weekend plays sins number one in the box office. They made $48 million domestically and $63.5 million globally, $19.2 million domestically just in the opening day. And, and that number was actually captured before the opening day even closed. This made this the second bus, biggest opening day for an original horror film this decade, but this also made this film the biggest debut in post pandemic history for an original film.

1:
And Ryan Coogler and the cast earned a Rare a Cinema Score. This is the first horror film to do this in 35 years. I don, you don't even gotta say nothing y'all like that is So Fire and Centers needs to make 200 to $225 million globally in order to break even theatrically. So the money that was put out to push the film to do everything that they needed to do, you know, globally, that is, that, that's, that's the number that they need to return right now. This movie has surpassed a Minecraft movie already, numbers wise, right? A Minecraft movie is set to make, it is predicted to make $700 million globally.

1:
A Minecraft movie is in 76 International markets. Sinner's movie is in 71 international markets. So I'm gonna read a tweet from Variety. This happened early in the re release of the movie Variety released this statement, Emini here, this headline on X Sinners has amassed $61 million in its global debut. It's a great result for an original r rated horror film. Yet the Warner Brothers released has a $90 million price tag before global marketing expenses. So profitability remains a ways away, y'all. It, they hadn't even closed out Sunday, they hadn't even closed out all 72 hours of the weekend.

1:
And these were the headlines. Every time they talk about black movies in the theaters, instead of talking about how well they're doing it, talk about what is not being done, let's talk about what's actually happening here. And if they not gonna do it, I will. So I saw some people upset And I wanted to get on here and have a conversation about that because what is, what Sinner is doing outside of hitting all the marks we talked about earlier, making all of the money, making Michael B. Jordan look damn good. 'cause baby the muscles where must ling okay, Michael B. Jordan. And I don't know if it was like the muscles with the guns and the action and the, but Michael B. Jordan was, he was giving it up. Okay, he was looking good. So the, there's multiple conversations happening, but I'm gonna focus on three.

1:
So the Bible thumpers right now are having a conversation as they always do, anytime a black horror femme drops, the black Bible thumpers come out and they start having a conversation about black magic and, and witchcraft and vampires and, you know, darkness and the devil and all of these things. And I get it, I was raised very traditionally in a very black traditional church where as I was watching this, I was like, my grandmother would be pissed at me sitting in here watching this movie right now. But I think when they start having a conversation around black magic and a lot of that thing, a lot of those things in the movie, you really honestly just begin to see our healing power. Like especially strong black women in faith, like strong black women rooted in spirituality and in faith, they always emerge as being the leaders of their relationships, of their families, of their communities.

1:
And they're often overlooked. What they do is often overlooked. It's often mocked until it's like The World is exploding. And I think we saw you, you will see if you have not watched it yet, and if you did watch it, you see that storyline play out and you know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not gonna give it away. But it also dives into like, you know, the struggle with God that I think black people have, especially black people in poverty or in really hard situations, they're always asking God, why? Like, there's a lot of loss in this film. There's a lot of like, we had to fight, we had to kill, we had this, we had that. So God and the conversation around that, it's like everybody's trying to get away from God in this movie and they're trying to find something, whether it's money, whether it's love, whether it's wholeness, whether it's a friend group, whatever.

1:
And it all comes back to, at the end of the day, the person who is the main character in this film taking us right back to God. And I feel like that's what the vampires kind of showed. It was like, here's these, these, these bad people who are doing these bad things, but because of it's like a cause and effect because of that, people are coming together, they're having a fight together, they're realizing who really is there for them. They're realizing what happens when you, you know what Emini here give your power and your energy to the negative thoughts and the, you know, all the stuff that the devil tries to wrap you up into. Especially when you doing well, when you, you figured out something, you figured out a way to make some money and maneuver. I also thought that, you know, there was like such a black versus white conversation in this movie.

1:
The white passing conversation was like one that I think a lot of people didn't really sit with. I think a lot of people just saw black versus white because at is very prevalent in the movie, especially before the time period that the movie is, is during the Jim Crow period. So especially during the time period, the movie is placed in where the movie is placed. And that is very prevalent. There's a lot of like leaning into Irish culture as well. And it made me like Google the black struggle and the Irish struggle in this film. You really get a sense of like, if we at all just figured it out and worked together, could it have been better? Because at one point they were, the white people weren't, weren't, weren't fooling with this, this little set of white people, this set of Irish people, right?

1:
And they were pushed away. They were this, they were that they were able to assimilate back into culture way differently and come up of course, you know, and, and that's a conversation for another day. But it was there for them too. So even with, you know, certain people of certain, you know, backgrounds choosing to be so black versus white, when in reality there are sectors of these cultures where it's like, y'all weren't accepted either. They wasn't fooling with y'all either to the point where they, they, they bring the KKK into this. And I'll just give y'all a little spoiler. So spoiler alert, some of the evil people that are Irish, they even lean into the fact that they had to bring in a member of the KK KKK and kind of warp this person so that they had an inside man because they wasn't fooling with them either, nor were they fooling with us, this whole movie either.

1:
So that was, it made me look, look up that, and again, I'm not comparing the two because black is black period and you can't tell me nothing about what we dealing with. If, if you look like a white man, white man, you know what Emini here, period. It just, you just can't tell me it's just not happening. And I'm trying to figure out like what his, what Ryan Geller's point. And that was, and and honestly it made me wanna do more research and more reading around that. And I love films that do that. But the white passing conversation, it brought that up a ton because the ability to just kind of like move in and outta different cultures and different sectors, different music, different energies, different, you know what Emini here struggles versus non struggle. And to turn it on and turn it off, the ability to do that.

1:
It, it comes back to, you know, backfire in this film really heavily. Like extremely heavily. Y'all, y'all gotta go see this movie. But I will say though, like the way that mainstream media covered this movie, I think it's not gonna do anything but help it. I gotta move on now 'cause it's so hard to talk about the film without giving y'all the film. But please go see sins if you have seen it already. Drop along the comments, some of the conversations that you picked up from the movie. There's a lot more like I was in the movie, like writing down like a notepad of just different things I wanted to research and like, just, just, just so much stuff. Just so much stuff.
