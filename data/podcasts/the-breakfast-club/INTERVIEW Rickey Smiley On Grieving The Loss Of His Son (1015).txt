My job as a professional, comedians to go on stage. And, make people laugh. And I lost my son about a year.


And a half ago. And, it's been hard because the bills don't stop coming. I'm still a performer, right? I still have to go on stage. And I had to, to dig deep And get in some real deep therapy to get myself together so I can continue as a performer. 'cause if I worked If, you know, Amazon lifting boxes or, or delivering packages, that's one thing. But when your job is to make people laugh, when you are crying on the inside with the trauma That I experienced it's It is it's, that's what the song Sideshow talk about. you know, see the man with a broken heart. you can see That, he is sad. It hurts so bad.


See, the girl who collect broken hearts, AT souvenir. It's, it's all about a clown in a circus performing, but dealing with stuff on the inside. I've Watched you grieve out loud online. And. The only reason I don't, I, don't I. I don't Like That. It has nothing to do with how you feel. know You know how people react. know And. When you already dealing with something, when you already dealing with trauma, And. Then you give It to people online, then they come If you. How did That, how do you deal with That? Oh? No, It. It didn't bother me. Charlamagne. My job was I had to help other people. Because the reason I was open with It is a lot of mothers out there. That lost their 18-year-old. 17-year-old, 16-year-old, 15 year.


My son was 32 when we were in New Orleans. Your books, your book signing was right after mine. And I I had a couple. That That lost their 2-year-old. Right? Wow. Wow. And. These are, that's some of the things That I talk about in the book. It gave me It It It gives you glimmers of hope. And the glimmers of inspiration. Even during our traumatic times, right? So my son was 32 We, this couple sitting out here crying. AT, my book sign And, their son was only two. Wow. And I could have lost my son AT two. But God allowed me to have, you know, 30 years, 32 years. So you get a little gratitude from That. And. It's crazy. That, you can get gratitude from something. Like, That If. you You know And.


you start looking AT. It's a helpful tool. The book is a helpful tool for people that's going through the grief process, because there's a lot of people out there, And, my book signing has been packed with people. That have lost their kids. And, how do you still believe? Right? Suit the Baldwin books too in New Orleans. You Know, how do you still believe, right? you talk about losing your father, AT the age of six, right? And. Then you lose your, your son. How do you just not say, you know what? There is no higher power. How do you still remain focused? And still have believe, And still have hope. And still have all of That with going through the pain. That, you've gone through And. You know, I grew up in Birmingham, man. So, you know, I got That. Old Southern Christian backgrounds. That's right. I went to Sunday school every Sunday. So I just have some, some strong beliefs.


And a close relationship with God because It was nothing And nobody to lean on. I was in an apartment in Dallas, Texas by myself. you know, when I found out, That, my son passed And. I had an hour, And a half. I had an hour to make It to the airport. Mm. And I'm packing a bag, And on the phone with my other kids. Let, letting them know what happened. Wow. And trying to get myself together. And, preparing myself to lead because my family needed me. If. you know, It didn't really hit me until a year later. Right? But AT, That time. My son has a mother, And a, a wonderful stepfather. So I had to protect them. I had to protect my mother, who was really close to my son because my mother, you know, recovering addict.


My mother had 35 years clean. Had to protect her because they had a real special relationship. Because she could identify with the struggle. Then I had to protect my other kids. I had two kids in college getting Ready to graduate college. you know, my daughter That got shot. She was a senior in college, getting Ready to graduate in Baylor. And. Then I had my son graduated Alabama State And. Then my oldest daughter. So just trying to get them And being calm. And say, Hey, here's what happened. Or Brandon didn't make It. I need you to meet me. AT the house immediately. Just real calm. I need you to text me. Let me know. That, you are on your way. Text me when you let me know. you just, all of That.


I had to be calm. I had to be cool. I had to get in the car with my uncles who was crying. I had to turn the radio on the R And B station. I had to turn on. Frankie Beverly, And Mays And go from the airport to house. I'm comforting them, right? Because It reminded them of my dad's death. Right? And. So I'm just a child man. That sat on the front row. And, watch my grandparents go through what they went through. And through my grandfather. I learned how to handle the situation because that's how my grandfather handled It as we Did you ever 'cause losing somebody, especially someone so close, your son can It. It changes you. Did you ever AT first when you were trying to get to That? Like. I. I. Mean I. Guess I. Get through It. I. Don't know If. you ever get through It? Feel? Were you, were you afraid That when you got back on stage?


That, first time That, Like. you just, It wouldn't be the same. Like. Your ability to kind of push through And, make people laugh, wouldn't be the Same. Nah, you know, Charlemagne, one thing about funny It, don't change. That's right. If you when you, you find something to laugh. AT, especially in trauma, know when your ass hit That stage. Man, them jokes come. Them jokes. Like. When you get somebody on the front row laughing, I cry all the way up. My first show was in Cleveland, AT, the Ho Casino. And. I cried from the hotel all the way to the venue all the way backstage. Blew my nose, did Like. That. Made sure my nose was clean. And walked on stage. And got them jokes. And cried after I got off stage. And, you know, I was calm.


But I've been in therapy. I was getting therapy twice a week. So I was prepared to go on stage again. My son died on a Sunday. That Wednesday. I was back on the radio. And. They said, take as much time as you need. we either you lay in the bed, And, think about all of That, or you get your ass up. And, go do your morning show And, go do your radio show. Because all the mothers in Chicago, And in Columbia, And in Charleston, And in Atlanta, all over the country, their kids died. Too much is given. Much is required. you can't cancel the show. God put you in this position. And put you in a leadership position. And, you have to lead.


And. I still went to the Salvation Army. Like, I do on a regular basis. I fed the homeless with my son. Clothes in the car to go to the funeral home. That was a dark Wednesday. Wow. Wow. I, I'll never forget It. you have to do It. Everything. All of this stuff. And. I. Don't want you to ever forget this. All of this stuff. Envy is a test. It's a test. Our pastor's been teaching us That for years. It's a test. God is watching you through your struggles, through your trials, And, tribulations, And looking If. you seeing how you gonna handle this? Are you gonna make It about you? Are you going to use this situation to help other people? But I St. I was still smart enough to go ahead, And, get the help That I needed in the process.


Because I had to get therapy because this trauma is a bad car accident. How do you, how do you think you would've been reacting without the, without the therapy? Oh? Man. I probably would've been dead. I had, my son was a, you know, my son was a comic. No I ain't know That Char. My son was a comedian. you I. I'll send you some clips. know my son, man. I. Remember my son headlined his first gig, AT the Star Do in Birmingham. And I walked backstage. He was by himself. He had on some shit. He had on some my, some black pants. And. I was roasting him because he had on a white shirt, And, some And, some suspenders.


And, a black belt tie. I was Like. What year was he here? Oh. That Nigga, what you got on? He said, Oh, Oh. you told me the dress now. I said, okay, you look nice. I said, but I said, I said, know Whatever. And. He went on stage. And performed I, stood backstage. And I, I I watched him perform. And. He had a really good set. And. He was doing headlining shows. He had just started, you know, closing shows. Man, he was funny. He had a kind of Like, a sense of humor. And, he was being mentored by Roy Wood Jr. Wow. you know, their clothes. you know Roy know we all came from Birmingham. Same radio station. All That stuff. So Roy was giving him some opportunities. And one time. Now this the funniest shit.


He was on stage performing. So he had stayed AT my house. Fucking left some clothes on the dryer. you know, he took the clothes out of the washing machine. And put It in the dryer. And. Then he took all the clothes. And put the shit on top of the dryer. I was mad as hell. You know, 'cause I Like you to Clo, you know, fold your stuff up. And, put your man I went to the Comedy Club. He was performing And. He was on stage. And. I didn't care. 'cause I was mad. I went in the DJ booth. And got on the microphone. And said, when you get your ass off stage, you need to come fold these damn clothing. Oh, my God. And. We got into a whole argument. And. The audience was cracking up And. I was for real. And And. He was laughing. And, all And said, know when you get off stage, you come home. And, get these damn clothes off my trucker. Hilarious. Slammed the microphone. Rant And walked out the door.


That's some funny stuff, right? know, That, I, That, I. Always enjoy talking about, but know How has It been Like, you know? 'cause when you write these books, you put a lot of, you know, you put your most vulnerable, deepest thoughts into these books. And, you gotta go out here. And, do this. Yep. you gotta have these conversations. know? How has, how's That been for you? I've gotten used to It. Okay. you know, once you know how It is, once you do one INTERVIEW, you do another INTERVIEW. you keep doing interviews. you just get accustomed to talking about It. And. Then you develop some really good talking points that's gonna help other people. Because what people been telling me is the feedback That I've been getting is, Hey, bruh, It is been helping me out. you know, how many people walk up to me? And said, That. They lost a loved one. And. They can't talk about It, And just because they hear you on the radio every morning.


Now they coming out to your book sign. I have people walking up crying. Almost 90% of the people That come out about the book, have suffered a loss. And can't talk about It. And do not go to therapy. So I've been promoting therapy, because when you roll your ankle, you don't pull out a Bible. you go to the doctor. Go to the doctor. That's right. Absolutely. The muscle. The brain is a muscle. Just Like your ankle. Why is It That? We black folks, as a, has this stigma, That, we won't go get help. That don't mean That. You're crazy. you have to get somebody And. Talk to somebody that's gonna help you process those feelings. And emotions. Because you can go into depression. And start affecting other organs in the body.


Some people don't make It from, from their loss. They die. you know? So We, a lot of times, people, you know, we, we've been taught as kids, you keep home, the home business in the house, right? you never really talk about what happens in inside your house. But Like, you said That winds up killing you. Absolutely. That, depression, That, anxiety, all those facts. All those feelings. Every time you cry, envy. Do you know that's Like popping the cap off of a pressure cooker. you Release him. know I cried this morning. know man I sat on I, sat on the side of my hotel bed. I was having some anxiety. I called a good friend of mine. She answered the phone. When I heard her voice, I just started crying. Bro, I just I just laid It out. I just cried. I just needed to just cry. It was I.


I felt It building up yesterday. And I just started crying. And, the changing of the seasons, you know, That That affects you. I. Think they calling It. Seasonal. Seasonal depression. Seasonal depression. know, I've Been, I've been dealing with anxiety, And depression for, for my whole life. And I started going to therapy in 2016. And, when I wrote a book about It in 2018, my dad read the book. And I had a cousin who completed suicide. That Week. And. My dad told me That It was the week of Thanksgiving, 2018 of home in South Carolina. And. He told me, That, between reading my book, And, my, my cousin completing suicide. He told me for the first time ever, That, he was going to therapy. Two And three times a week. That know he tried to kill himself 30 plus years ago. And That in, in South Carolina. They put him on 10 to 12 different medications for his, for his mental health.


And, I. Remember I asked my mom, I said, mom, you know, dad was going through all this And. She said, I thought he was playing crazy to get a check, because that's what they're doing to soft. They give you the crazy, the crazy check. Right? But imagine if he would've had That conversation with me when I was young. Exactly. And, you just told me. That the con the, the way we're discussing It right now, right? Imagine if we heard, you know, older And men in our life, having That conversation early. We'd have known That. The stuff we was going through was normal. know My granddad never talked about It. My dad died. My dad was 26. My granddaddy didn't talk about It until he was Like 85. Mm. Because he would be AT my house all the time. you know, And, I was sitting I say, granddaddy, what happened? My dad died here in New York. Mm. you know, my dad died of a drug overdose here in New York. And. My granddaddy was Like.


He just started telling me he was Like. I was there when they bought your dad's body in And. I stood there, Like a man. I was standing in the mark when they rolled my son body in there. Mm. Like Like. I took That shit. Like. A g I didn't shed a tear. I just made sure everything was done properly. you know, bought the barber in, told the barber how I want my son. Mustache. And beer done. And I stood right there. And I took It. But all of That stuff. you Cried in the car Though. It, It, the It It hadn't really, really hit me yet. It is coming out in, in small pieces. Like this morning. Morning, right? Maybe this morning was, was some of It And I I didn't cry. AT the funeral because my, my granddaughter was looking AT me.


Mm. The whole time was Like peekaboo, Because she didn't know what was going on. you know what I'm saying? If, You know, the whole while, you know, she looking AT me, we playing. Because, you know, And, I, I just had That memory of my grandparents crying. AT, Ricky, Have you dealt with It? Then know, because It doesn't seem Like. you fully, You dealing with It, it's process. Know, selling If you with It. It's a process, bro. you know? Do you ever think About just giving away, just stopping, you know, Like, I don't wanna do this anymore. Was That ever a mind? No. No. Man, we, we gotta save people, man. My my listen, some have to die so others can live. Mm. you understand And, you know, no cross, no crown, bro.


We have to go through what we have to go through. And. We have to talk about It. And. I'm just trying to break the generational curse of number one. Not talking about It. Not going And getting therapy. And getting help And to talk about, you know, drug addiction. you know, I had a son, And a nephew, age 32, And a niece. I had a niece, a son, a nephew, all died AT age 32, within two years of each other. Can you talk a little bit about That? Like, just in real time when they were here, dealing with the addiction, And, trying to help them through It, And, Like. Also wanting them to get better. But addiction, understanding, That, Like, It kind of takes over where it's not, it's not even just them anymore. know Like. It's kind of, know. It's A big, big beast.


know the only thing I regret. I didn't have a good understanding of the illness. Mm. Because I had a, a niece, And, a nephew. That was cool. And calm, And respectful. we It didn't affect my son That way. you know, my son would, would go off about stuff. you know, And It, It damaged our relationship or whatever. 'cause I didn't understand Like, Hey, I'm your dad. you can't say That to me. you know, I'm driving around looking for you to fight you in the middle of the street. you know, I raised you I cook food for you. you know what I'm saying? I, wash your clothes. you slept in the bed with me when It was Thunder. And, Like. Don't say That to me. you know? So I just didn't have a, a clear understanding of That. But I did everything I could to to, to save, to save his life.


Did you ever blame yourself? AT? All Oh? No. That's one thing. I never felt. I never felt guilt. Now, you know, I felt a lot of stuff, but guilt was not one of them. I did everything I could as a father to save his life. you know? Rehab is 70 grand off the bat. Boom. Like, Like, you know, we did That twice. And, And. you know, my mom was trying to help him. I just couldn't, I just couldn't get him. I just couldn't get him to get him. we Would You do anything different as a, as a dad during any of those times? And, the reason I'm asking, you know. No, that's before have six. So, I Like to, That's, that's a good question. I wasn't tough on him. He was the one. That, I, coddle.


I was tough on my other kids. Like, I, Like. The other kids was Like. I was just really, really, really, really tough on them. And, he was the one. That. I just kind coddled. And did everything for And. Took It. we, because that's my first born Mm. Or whatever. I. Just wish That. I was tougher. You know That sounds strange because It sound, Like. I should say I should have been easier on him. I was easy on him. I should have been tougher on him. Like, I was the other kids. What do We call tougher though? Because If, you know, we come from the era. I was getting beat with extension cords. And, my daddy made me go take a bath. I gotta go. That's switch That. That's abuse. I. Don't beat my kids. I. Don't even touch my kids. AT. All right, but so what do you call tough I? Just wouldn't give him, you know, I, I.


I. Don't think I popped. Brandon. I. I hit him, popped him a couple of times when he was about 14. You know. Made him go stand in the corner. And, go do That. Little Thing right there. I. Wanna make sure those legs And, those cameras straight. If. you know what I'm saying? I didn't, by the time I started getting tough on him, It was time for him to go off to college, you know? But the other kid, Like, Malik went to military school. Then he went to I, MG Academy or whatever. So he had a military mindset. And. I. Think that's what, but I tried to do That for Brandon. 'cause I sent him to the National Guard. you know what I'm saying? So my son served, he had a flag Dred over his cousin, because he served our country. But I, just think I caught on him a little too much.


know And, And. That. And just loved on him. And. He was the one I loved on, hugged on, you know, And just up under me all the time. Know I, don't, It. It is hard when you, you a parent nowadays. Like I said, because the era we grew up in. I, be talking to my 9-year-old Like. She a basketball player. Like. But you wouldn't have survived in the nineties. you couldn't, you couldn't have played in the nineties. you getting, but, but, but my grandma And, my mama And daddy was going to be right. Please. But, But the key is It is good. That. you talk to her with That, coach Voice. know, because we have to give kids More of what we had as opposed to what we didn't have. That's right. That's right. you know what I'm saying? you Like who you are. you Like how you turned out. Right? Give That same thing to your kids, right? And, that's the Evolved version of, of you, I'm sure. Right? And, I, Like, And through therapy.


I. I've learned to love every version of me. I. Think that's what you gotta do in life. you know, Like, every version of you serve the purpose. Absolutely know. And chapter 12 of your book, it's Let the Tears Fall. And, you said That It took you a year to, for, for all of this. To really Like hit, you know, what was That Day? Like when you were Like? Hmm. I'm feeling It. Like That. First time where It was Like man. That That. One year anniversary. A few days before That one year anniversary. Man, It hit me. Like. He had just died. And I was sitting. I had just got off the air. I was down in South Florida because I didn't want to be in the house for That one year anniversary. I just wanted to go get away. And man, It hit me, man. And I was I, did some crying.


And, I, I, I. Think It was a bad mistake for me to be there by myself. But I just kind of sat on the couch. And just cried pretty much for a couple of days. Like Like really cried, because the only difference was I didn't have a casket. And some flowers, And some condolences, right? I had all of That to keep me distracted doing. When It actually happened, I had to protect everybody. But That one year came in. And. It was Like. It was terrible. What about the chapter when addiction chases the bloodline? Was That difficult to write? 'cause you know, you gotta go through your whole generational lineage. know with That, was That a difficult chapter to Write? Nah, It wasn't. It was just being, being open.


And honest. My dad struggled. My mom struggled. I had wonderful grandparents. My granddad talked to me every day. Church, Sunday School, you know, Hey, here's a trumpet. Play That. Here's some piano lessons. Let's go do That. Lilly from Lilly. I did trumpet. Lil League football did It. All my grandparents kept me busy with the discipline. And instruction talk to me every day. So, I didn't have to, I didn't have those issues, And. Then he always talked about how my dad died. So, don't do this. Mm. So I I just stuck with It. And to this day. I don't drink or smoke. I always wonder how grief impacts people who lost their parents. AT a very, very, very young age, because It hit you later in life. Do you see somebody out with their parents?


And, And, And. It hit you. Like. What is It? It did when I was, when I was a kid. But, but what what hurt me about my dad's death was watching my grandparents cry. Like, That on the front row. I'm in therapy for That. Wow. That comes up in therapy. That That wipes me out. Wow. That wipes me out. More than my son's death. Why? I'm, I'm, I'm a grandmama's baby. Like. you, you understand, you from the South Like watching my grandparents cry, Like That on their, their front row, man, I, I I can't get over. It know, even when my grandparents died, the only thing I I could think about, their casket was in the same spot. My dad's casket, we, the only thing I could think about was them crying on, on That front row. April the 11th, 1974.


Wow. I will never forget. It man, It, It, It. It just It. Tears my soul outta my body. I can deal with my son's death. But that's, that's what I struggle with More than anything. Wow. And. That's why I didn't cry. AT my son's funeral, because my granddaughter was watching me. And, I don't want Her. If, you didn't wanna traumatize her. Like, thatt something. Like That know. Dang boy know. Life is a motherfucker. You got you sitting up here talking about It, because we about to All start crying. You Know. I just wanna Hug. you know? But that's what I Don understand about. That's, that's why, that's why I noticed. Like just putting this out there to the World And having to relive all these stories. And retell these stories. Is It Therapeutic know? Or does It feel Like? you opening up all man. This, this is therapy. Because if I, go And, get in That car. And start crying. That is helpful.


It is helpful to cry. It was helpful for me to cry this morning. you understand? I'm, I'm good. But I also think what you're doing is helping people. That don't know how to deal with It. And. And can't talk about It, because now they have a friend in you. In this book, And. They're saying, we, let me see how Ricky dealt with It. Let me see what the troubles he's going through. It is normal. I can feel this way. 'cause a lot of times people feel Like. They're on their own, know And. They don't have those feelings. So that's, that's one amazing thing about this, this Book. we, let's talk about something else for a second. If, you put on a lot of comedians. Ricky And, I. Think That coming from the South. Right? People don't re I. Don't think people realize how big you are. Sometimes, Like this, you know what I'm saying? know Like. I. Don't think they realize how much money you got. Number one. But also I. Wish. How rich you are. And. Just how big you are.


And, I, And, I. Think it's, it's a, it's almost a stigma with comedians from the South. Like. They don't get to respect That. They deserve I. Think Know, I. I. Just do It for the love of the art. Charlamagne, envy, I. Remember cussing D Ray Davis out snatching the drink outta his hand because he was too young to be drinking. Hey, gimme That. you know, I had a little Comedy club back in Birmingham know, called the Cornerstone. know. So I would, I would have Like. D Ray, Corey, Holcomb. Corey Holcomb was Like. Hey man, I ain't never been outside of Chicago. I was Like. Okay, cool. Let's go on the road. you know, I would take those guys on the road. Corey, Holcomb, d Ray, Davis, a lot of them, man, That, That, Tyler, some of them have passed away.


you know, I would just take 'em on the road. And help 'em, because that's what Steve did for me. you know, nobody have to, don't nobody have to fool. you know what I'm saying? Some people can just ignore you. Steve was one of those guys. Man. That was helping in training coming That. I started November the 13th, 1989. Wow. That's the first time I went on stage. I met Steve before he did Showtime AT, the Apollo And. Then tell you a story. I wrote about It. In my first book, And, just talk about the discipline. And. The structure of of, of Comedy. I was dressed. Like a Like. Flavor. Flave. 'cause I thought That was a thing. And, I'm doing a show with Steve And. Steve was Like. Listen.


He said, people pay money to see us perform. Your outfit is nice. He said, but tomorrow, I want you to come dress better. I want you to dress okay. He said, I want you to dress nice. you know, Bruce Ayers, the owner was standing in the door watching I was embarrassed. I felt bad. I felt Like. My career was over. you know, my feelings were hurt. I was Like Oh shit. you know, I don't wanna blow an opportunity with Steve Harvey, man. He said, you can go ahead, And, introduce me. He said, but tomorrow, let's get It together. I said, yes, sir. you know, because you can't say nothing nowadays. you can't correct nowadays. 'cause everybody's sensitive. I said, y'all give It up. And show your love right now. But Steve Harvey, queen, I'll never forget It Queen. The Tee would come on for the love of money off That new Jack City soundtrack.


Yes, sir. And, he came up. I'm talking about It was electrifying. I wanted to stay there. And watch, man. I ran out That damn Comedy Club Door. I jumped in my 1979 Toyota Corolla. Four speed I, peeled outta That Company, club Driveway, I, drove all way across town. Ran in my apartment, Woohoo. Put on a suit. I had off from Gene West because I used to work. AT Gene West, you know, put my suit on. Boom, tie, And. I'm running And, driving back. I made It back to the Comedy Club. Just in time when I walked back in the there he was. Like. All right, y'all, I've been wonderful. God bless y'all. My name's Steve Harvey. Peace And. When I walked back up there, And had That suit on. Nah, nigga. Not tomorrow, tonight. That's what's up right now. What Steve said to you when he saw you.


So, so, so he got me up. And. He, you know how he do know, he pushed talk about, you know, you know how You know And you pushing. He let me up. And down And, he said. He said, I'm gonna talk to you after the show. I said, yes, sir. And. Steve's anointed man. Oh, my God. I don't care what nobody says. you know, after the show, he said, follow. He said, follow this car right here, I. Follow him back to his hotel room. I sat on It.

Edge of the bed. And. Took a little notepad. And a pencil. And. He lectured me for about two hours. And me And. Another comedian sat on the edge of the bed. And wrote notes how to do this. Why not do this? you did this joke wrong. Why are you cussing on stage? Why are you dressed Like? This mo T, AT And. T is in the audience. you need to do this. Da da da. I took all That stuff. I took It serious because I wanted It to be great. I wanted to be better. AT. AT. What I did? And I ended up opening up for the kings of Comedy. I did some shows where I did a few dates with the kings of Comedy. you had to ride with Steve If. you don't get your own limousine, you have to ride with him. So you have to be disciplined. Get in the limousine. Keep your mouth closed.


Slide all the way up. Put your back to the driver. Speak. When spoken to. Had to share a dressing room with Steve. We frat brothers. But I'm not ever comfortable enough. Just because you are a cue, And. I'm a cue. I'm finna come in here Like. I'm entitled. Be quiet. And. Speak. And spoken to. That's the discipline. I got from my grandparents. Who was the other comedian on the bed with you? I was Go, probably Sir Walt Oh, sir. know a comedian. That lives in Birmingham. Sir. Walt And. He was mentoring a lot of us, but he was really into teaching. Come over here. I'm sitting down. I'm you I mean. We sitting there. He's standing up, walking back, And forth. And. He's talking to us. And, And, I. Remember a couple of times I was about to nod off 'cause I was so sleepy. 'cause I go to bed early. And. But That, That.


That was something. That was life changing. we You still Like. That I changed the title of my first book 'cause of Steve, which money? I was gonna name my book. I. Don't give a fuck. And, neither should you. A self-help guide on how not to give a fuck. Wow. And. We was driving around That in a ranch in Georgia. And I told him That title And. He looked AT me, And. He said, I got You That. Look, no, no playing That ain't It. He said, that's the problem with y'all. Y'all don't give a fuck. We need to, y'all need to give a fuck. He said, all people need to give a fuck. Right? And, he same thing, lectured me for about an hour. And, I'm Like. All right, I got It. you ain't know Big Brother Mentor I was supposed to be on his morning show. And. We had a big argument sitting in his truck. And. Then Rashaan got on the phone. And said, no, you need to do your own thing. We gonna use Nephew, Tommy.


He said, you go over here. If It don't work out, you can come be on the show with us. Wow. So hold on. you supposed to be a a co-host on Steve Harvey show. So Steve was gonna give me, when Steve left Radio one, they said, who do you think they said? He said, Ricky Smiley. So I went down there to do the morning show with Steve for two weeks. So he could gradually, Hey, turn the show over to me. Hey, I'm gonna be gone in two weeks. But Ricky Smiley gonna be taking over. The chemistry was so good. And, we were so funny. I was just throwing him all kind of Alley s making him recycle jokes. And And, And And. We were just so funny on the air together, we looking AT each other. Like. Hey man, we need to, we need to, you know, And, me And. Steve had It. We was Like.


Okay, we going, we gonna stick together. I'm I'm, I'm gonna go to New York with you. And. We got in the car. Rashan, our other frat brother, who was Steve Manje You know Rashan If. you You know Rashan. Rashan said, hell no. He said no. you know, I just have this idea. That, you should go over here. We gonna bring in Nephew, you, Tommy And, And. If It don't work out, you can always come back. But let's give this a try. Let's see how you do. Was That tough to hear? That? 'cause you, because think about It. Like. you go to New York with Steve Harvey, it's Like. you set know for what you think. Was It hard to accept? That? No. you shouldn't do It. Nah, It wasn't, because once Steves look gave me That look, when he did the phone, And, he just kinda got, you know, That Look. That's right. If. you know That. Look when he give you That, That Big Brother.


Look, Like, okay, we gonna go ahead And. you You know, gonna argue with him, right? Who do you do That for? That. I mean? 'cause you talk a lot about people. That, you mentor And. That, you help. But Like, who's somebody? That. you do That for? That. Like, we might not know about That might have started in your clubs or just unknown And. Now it's Like taking over. Comedy wise, Oh man. Lil Duval was somebody. That I. That I have a real good relationship with That. I was doing some, you know, mentorship. Because remember I was the host of Comedy View in two thousand's. Right? So you was a lot of people mentored just by being on That Show. know, right? That's what, that's what 85 South Show said. know 85 South know. They told me That know I saw That. I'm tripping. Like Like. Carlos Miller was Like, Oh, Bru, I I met you when I was 14 years old.


you was in a hotel. I got excited. I'm hearing these stories. And stuff, man. Not realizing the impact on Comedy. 'cause I'm on BE T Monday through Saturday. Right? Like, when, when Comic View really blew up. It was in Atlanta And. Then I hosted again, Charlemagne in 2004. And. Then the year after 2000, 2001, I had my own little TV show. The way we do It Us was the first time, you know, And, I was doing all these characters, And all these voices, And, And, And, all this kind of stuff. And. So when comics needed help, And needed mentorship. I would always, you know, Hey, dress nice. Hey, stop cursing. Does That curse word make That joke funny? Or are you cursing just to be cursing? That's a real thing. I just had That conversation with a comic.


I say, Hey man, you curse too much. The cursing is not making the joke funnier. But if the curse word is a part of the punchline, then use It. I say, because it's Like I. Give the onion example. Like It Like. you eat an onion, it's nasty, but If, you take It And chop It up, And saute, It And put some flour on It And. you still eat the onion, but you can't taste It. That's right. And, just an analogy. That I use with comics. And I make them redo the joke. And I was Like. Damn. you did the same joke. And got the same laugh, got a bigger laugh. 'cause people are not offended. Right. you know what I'm saying? So you, you know, it's, it's, it's no training in standup anymore. you know, back then, in the eighties, late eighties, nineties, comics would pull you to the side.


Mark Curry And them, they would pull you. George Wallace got on my ass so bad one night. Why you was bombing or what? No, man, I did some jokes behind him after he closed It, after he headlined the show. I didn't know any better. He said, you don't do 'em damn jokes after me. He said, goddammit, I'll make one phone. Call your career open. Damn you motherfucker. I said, I'm sorry. He said, If. you, you say goodnight. Read the announcement, And, bring your ass back tomorrow. I said, yes sir. Damn. Wow. And I came on back. He was nice to me the next night. And, he won't admit It to this day. I said, Joe, you remember? He said, I ain't do That. Shit, shut up. But, but It was good.


I needed That. Shit. If I got a boo in my nose, tell me, don't let me be out here bad. Pull me to the side. And help me. But you can't even Do It It, you, you feel Like, you do That nowadays, And, somebody will be Like Oh, man. He threatened me. you, you, you feeling no, you hate, you hurt my feeling. He hate me. know he hate you. you insulted me, offended me. It's Like What? Man, I tell comics, man. Because that's the only way. Ask Cory Holman, ask d Ray Davis. I used to get AT them all the time about little stuff. Man, I'm Like. Hey man, you, you I. Think D Ray was 19 or 20 when I bought him to Birmingham. I said, you can't drink nothing. you can't have That. Gimme That, fussing. AT him about little stuff, man. And. Now he's great. And. We laugh about It all the time. He's just gonna always be my little brother or whatever. They all come to the house.


If. you ever come to Birmingham? you know, you Welcome, I cook my ass off or whatever. So you That hundred thousand square foot off, hundred acres of land, hundred acres. I. Wish you right. Y'all, y'all always Welcome. Now, Now there was a, a rumor, That in your contract, That said, That, you had to wear a dress. Oh, man, I don't pay That stuff. I didn't know That. Damn, man, you, you should have put you, you just bit into the onion. you ain't put no flour on you. you ain't head or nothing. God Damn. Hey, And. So, so, so, so I'm I. Then I started doing Comedy 89. Man, you think there's a contract somewhere? I'm just messing with, you know, I You know It Oh You know That That didn't bother me. What bother me was, was people believed It You know they did because it's always been That thing about the wear the dress, the not wear the dress.


The It's Comedy know. Listen, It is Comedy. I grew up watching Flip Wilson know Flip Wilson is the greatness of all time. you And And And, right? When you laughing AT Flip Wilson, he turned around And do Geraldine, me And, my I would sit there And, watch That with my grandmother. My characters came. Man. I was doing prank phone calls on the radio. I was doing Bernie, Jenkins, And, whoever would've thought a character, That you do on the radio, calling funeral homes, And, all this stuff turned into a character. And, somebody asks you to play the character in a movie or whatever. you know, It is funny. That, all That stuff is, is, is taboo. Now they Do That in Philly. Mother know they do It on Power. Nine, nine. you ever heard It? Nah.


And, they do the calls. I just thought about That when you said It. I don't know if they got It from you, but mother know they prank call people all the time. But know We, that's the Thinging Radio.

I had one beef with a coming And. It was a quiet beef for 20 years. And That was Arnie. SJ me, And. Arne. Jay could not freaking stand each other. We had a why? Because It a show happened. And, you know, commun get there early. And go on first. Hmm. you know, Arne had got there. And didn't do the order or either something happened, but we had B, nobody knew about It. Right? Right. Lemme show you how God worked. Nobody knew about It.


Covid came. I'm sitting on Delta. I'm in Fort Lauderdale airport getting Ready to fly to Atlanta where I could drive home. you know, And, I. See a dude getting on a plane with a mask on? He got fishing rods. we who? Fish? Arnie. SJ Lavelle Crawford, And. What's my man? Shadiq Houston. Those are the, the three comics. That really fish. They fish. Fish. They go fish.

I, I. I. Saw his I. I said, You. know That. Arnie. SJ I hadn't talked to him in 20 years.


Like, we had It. Wasn't no ugly beef. Like. I'm gonna kill you. Just Like. Forget you. Forget you or whatever. And, I'm, you know, I'm a Christian person. And. I'm all about resolving And, And loving on people, because that's my heart. And I grabbed his arm. And. He did It, Like, That, And. I looked I grabbed It. And. He's Like. Like. What? What? And. I pulled my mask down, man. He started laughing. He started laughing. So, Charlamagne the gimme your hand the other hand. Oh. The whole, the whole, the whole flight. Me, And. Arne. Jay Like this. 'cause when he started telling me That, the 20 years, all the people That passed away.


You know everything That happened to him. know we cried the whole flight. Wow. From Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta. I said, man, I apologize. He said, no. He said, my wife been trying to get me to call you for years. And been on me about That. I said, nah, you don't have to. It was just love. Hmm. Because 'cause I I had always said, if I see Arne, she again, I'm just gonna tackle him. I, I can't. Kat I saw Kat one time, And. He had said some stuff. That's before the internet came out. And said some stuff, some stuff. Years ago, he was roasting all the comedians. That wore dress, That, That play a, a character. you know, he was roasting. All I was. We was talking about It on the foxhole.


One day, And I was driving down 14th Street in Atlanta. I saw a cat walking across the street. And, I had my granddaddy in the car in my Ford, F-150. And. you know, I'm one of the type of dudes, I don't be carrying I'm Like. Hey, Kat, what's up? He was walking to Starbucks. I'll never forget It. He said, come on, And, have a cup of coffee with me. Cup of coffee with me. So I went over there, And, before he went to Starbucks, he came around. I said, Hey, man, KA with we I. Said, this is my granddad, or whatever. My granddad saw you on TV before my granddaddy said, know And. Kat stood in the door, had a conversation with my grandfather or whatever. And. That was Like. One of the last times I saw him. And. There was no issue because it's all love or whatever.


Because, you know, I don't know why I never did anything to him. If I did, you know, I'm always open, man enough to apologize. you felt Like. He was clearing the record on Shea, because I think he or was It. That. He, he was supposed to play a role. you said money. Mike If. you was supposed to be money Mike or something. Like That money. Mike You know. We I did. When I went out there, I auditioned for That. Part. And. That's what I really auditioned for. I didn't audition for the Santa Claus. If I'm not mistaken, the Santa Claus role was supposed to be for, what's his name? He played in the first Friday. The comedian. That passed away. Oh Man. That was That was That was on, on drugs. And stealing. And, breaking in People House. Oh, Oh, Oh. aj aj AJ Johnson. AJ Johnson. AJ Johnson know I. Think AJ Johnson was supposed to play the sign.


And. This is what, what I heard or whatever. And. They put me in That role because AT, That time I was on BE. T, And, And stuff. Like That. But I did audition for It. That's what I went out there. And read for my manager. AT. The time came on. The air cleared That up. David e Talbert came on on Instagram. And cleared up the fact That, there's no country. He had hired me to play my role in the movie. First Sunday before he hired Kat. He cleared, he cleared That part up. But Cube Cube clarified It too. I Cube said, That, you did audition for Money, Mike. Right? But when they saw how you moved, they thought you'd be better for Santa Claus. Exactly. You You know. So know And. I don't have no, have no beef. I love everybody.


If there is a opportunity to resolve, that's what I, I'm I the rap Beef And stuff with rappers getting killed. I don't want Comedy to ever come to That. you know, that's not what I do. That's not how I was raised. you know, we from the South. That's right, And. We just don't, we don't, we don't do That. I wanna talk about some of the revolutionary stuff. I feel, Like, you've done in Radio I. Feel Like, this nation, You, If. you know what I'm saying? know we had never seen That before. And. I mean, you know, as a radio head to see radio personalities on TV in That era. That felt Like watching Howard when Howard did It on E. Right? So That was, That was a revolutionary thing. And also making the move to urban AC know Like, knowing when It was I. Don't know If. you knew It was time or Like.


What? How'd That happen? It just happened perfectly. We, you know, we was on the hip hop stations. And, It was great, but we was getting older. you know, I'm in, I'm almost 50, Brett, you know, we all in our forties or whatever. We ain't got no business playing certain stuff because we just going, you gonna naturally age. you just can't. you just can't, can't be on the radio. We don't even know who some of the, some of the, we didn't know who some of the rappers are. That. We playing Like. Who is this now? Rap Bra, the first female rapper to sell over me. And. She Like. Who? you know, you got, you got the back sell the song. This who we looking over the top of our glasses? What the fuck? But you Used to make It funny though. I used to watch y'all. It would be funny know, but, but we just naturally got older.


And. Then when Tom Joyner retired, they just slid us over. And. And. Now we, we playing R And B songs. And. Now it's just relaxed in the morning. know, we just know we, we chill. Whose Idea was It to throw Porsche or to get Porsche on the show? Oh Dish Nation. know I. Think That Was, That was so good. We Porsche, she would fill in for Brat. Okay. Portia came, did a great job. And. She would fill in for Brat And. Then they say, Hey, you want to do Destination? So anybody came in, And filled in the, the A producing And say, Hey, we can get you some makeup right Quick. Can you do Destination? Here's the script, And. It's nothing. It's just reading. And teleprompter. And. Talk about what we have already talked about on the radio.


Then we was doing Dish Nation while we was on, on the air. Mm. So during commercial breaks, we would shoot a scene from Dish Nation. Wow. Oh I. Don't know why. I thought That was the show. know I thought It was the shoot was know I thought It was the see y'all Show. Nah man, we was doing, we was shooting when we first started, we was in That damn same room for six hours. We was working our ass off. And. When did you, when when did you know you wanted to do radio? Because radio was not a job for everybody. Right? People say they love radio, right? And. Then when they, how get there an hour before And, two hours after And, And, And. They can't move And. Especially with comedians, because you guys are on the road, right? you might not be able to go on the road some days. So when did you know That? I'm gonna stay with this. 'cause Man, I used to listen to these two white dudes named Mark And. Brian, you remember Mark And? Brian Charlamagne, they big in la.


Mark And. Brian I. Don't remember Mark And. Brian, they had this big ass morning show, but they came from Birmingham. These the first dudes, I used to hear doing characters. And And.
