I'm just wondering who you talking about? This young lady over here. Why We always got It. We Call her LL Cool Bay. She know She always alone in her room staying AT the Wall.


That was your best joke. You've been sitting on That one, you I ain't heard That one, You practice That know, know He was waiting because I ain't even heard That one. What thing babe? I don't think I'm looking in Atlanta though. know We whoa, whoa Dang. Wow. Whoa. Discrimination much. No I. Just, you Sound Like what Trump just said about Detroit. you Jesus. I have some No I. Have you love I? Have some homegirls down there. That have had really bad experiences. It's a little Really bad Experience. know it's been, it's been a little trauma in the group chat. know? So I I. Think I'm Know Probably them. you do It. you Do a track with the energy you Distribute I. Tell her That all the time. First of all, I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about the gr the Homegirls And group chat. Okay? But you're talking about how That, how, how their experiences are influencing your decision.


For Sure know I I. Think That That. So you're talking about you essentially. Yes you are. we I I Attract. Great things. You do is alright. We. What? We, why would That change? If? you took It If, you took That same energy to Atlanta. We from what I hear in Atlanta. I think the ratio makes It. Where? Like Objection. Hearsay. I just hear a lot about That ratio. And. How kind of, you know, the guy has got a lot going on. you got, it's, it's a lot down there. And. you know, everybody wants to deal with successful And. you know, these amazing black men. But if they dating 50 people, And don't wanna settle with one. The dating never gets nowhere. Long as You got the whip pill, You Oh my goodness, whip I.


Don't think we can say That. We can't, we say we can't say That. know baby face. That's baby face. You Know. She too young know face where Whip pill by Babyface ring know Man. That was not That. Funny Know, but I think That I. Think I. Think That. I. Think it's somebody down there. That. Like. 'cause It probably a dude down there right now. Who? Like. Man. All these girls want the same thing. And. you know, everybody want be seen with somebody in Cartier glasses. And happening outta Maybach. What's wrong with Cartier Glasses? I'm just saying. I'm just saying bro.


I'm just saying. But you know, but that's the kinda guy. She's saying. She trying to avoid this. Is she trying to avoid me A little bit? That, you, you described It. Just I. Think it's, it's just certain I. Think the, the lifestyle in Atlanta though, it's really, really fun. you have a good time. I. Think That kind of plays a, a part of It too is Like. Eventually we get Like, And I. I'm outside I go outside. I'm around. But you get tired of Like every single time we go out. We gotta be in the club. We gotta be with the hookah. And the drink Queen Know. But that's when she tired of this, you know, You know every weekend. No I don't, not every weekend And. If I'm dating somebody, I wanna do things other than That, And a lot of the people. That. This is another conversation in the group chat. A lot of my homegirls feel Like in Atlanta. That's all the dates are. It is such And That. It's fun in the beginning.


But then you wanna really dig deep. know You gotta always go to the club. And do Hookah. Nah, you can Go to Ether Ridge It. you can go on Bankhead know Many traps to travel If you so they know You know you. They gotta surround the wrong guys. you Know what I'm saying? Because I feel Like. The the people that's coming through Art Chat, it's Like. They just wanna go to Cheetah. They wanna be, they wanna be out Like. They, that's It. I mean we can I. Think Like I said again, man, you, you, you, you attract the energy. That you distribute. So if that's what they, if that's what they attracted, they should probably look within. you know what I'm saying? And, tell them to stop And be the change they want. See, stop going to Cheetah. You'll stop meeting people. That don't wanna go to Chee. you know what I'm saying? There's Good food over there. Know, see what I'm saying?

I'm approaching four. you feel what I'm saying? So Like, Like, all of these things happened to where It made me want to actually seek something better. you know what I mean? So, when I took myself to rehab out in la, did a couple months out there, And It was cool.


you know what I'm saying? I got back out. And I was still tempted to live That kinda life. But I saw what was in front of me. And I. I was Like. This is More valuable than what's behind me. What, What gave you the, the courage I would say to, to be able to talk about It? Right? Because you know, some people look about It as it's embarrassing And. Then some people will say, you know, It could actually help people that's going through the same thing. That, you are actually going through, or That you dealt with, you know, I mean What? The support team. you feel what I'm saying? Because the first time It happened, we had Like an intervention And, he came over. you Mean first time Like overdose, First time or I need to know what the Grand Hustle intervention looks. Like I. Really? We, he came over there. Hey, er, I'm Like bro. Delicate right now.


you feel? But I mean Like. The love I got And. The, the, the support. I got It. It made me feel safe. It made me feel safe. And. you know what I'm saying? Of course, I do feel ashamed. you know what I'm saying? AT first, you know what I mean? Why? It's A disease. There ain't nothing to be Ashamed about. we, because Like, we from, you don't supposed to let nobody see you. Like, That. you know what I'm saying? We always talk Like. you know what I'm saying? Once you find yourself in That position, And your brother call you out on It. you be, you be you be hoping That, you could get rid of It before he come. And, check me. But when he come check me on It, I get mad. AT myself, And be Like. Damn I supposed to got straight before. you know what I mean? My manager would come or if he would come. you feel what I'm saying? So It was, It was a, now the, now the up thing about It is, you know what I'm saying?


And, we've had this conversation before. Like, as as, as long as he, we was battling his addiction. Long as he was on drugs, I never actually saw him do drugs. I never saw It, Like. you know what I'm saying? So whatever he would do, he'd do It, And, I. Don't know whether he would high while he was around me or not. But I was. But what I'm saying is, when Like, while we was around each other, It was still this And, It was still Like this. So when I went to him, I didn't even know. I didn't know the difference. you know what I'm saying? I still. But I was concerned. So I'm Like. Hey man, I can't even fuck with you. Like, That man. know. Do what you going do, bro. Do did what you gonna do, bro. I ain't finna sit around And watch you do this.


I ain't going to do It. I feel Like I. Remember That, period. When you was It, feel Like, you was giving Joe Tough love, Like. you had to put him to the side. you didn't cut him off. I didn't put him to the side. I just told him, man, you going either man, either you I, I can't just continue to support you. Deteriorate or deteriorate. Destroy yourself. you got to And. He was Like, man. All right. I got, because the funniest thing, That man told me, because when he, when he overdosed. So, wait a minute, now stop. I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be, Hey man, stop, bro. Go look man. Okay, you And, Charlemagne the same. you know, That, when I go through my problem or whatever, It, he laughed. Like Its not time to laugh, but no, no, no, no. But help me through It though. I ain't gonna no, but look, no, he hear me out.


So this is what I'm saying. Now, God bless all of the people who have, you know what I'm saying? Who have overcame addiction? And, God bless the people who have succumbed to It. And. So many of our, our leaders, And, so many of our, just the, the, the heroes of our culture are, are passing away If. you know, If, you know, because the Fentanyl epidemic is, is real. Yes, there, you feel me? And, we've seen so many people. Like, Like, Like, fall, And not make It. That man made It three times, three times.


And. The first time they called me And, he was, you know what I'm saying? Somewhere with people, That I would feel Like. you know what I'm saying? Wouldn't have the same care to do the things That need to be done. But he still made It, And, I could be, you know what I'm saying? That, That, That That. I'm speaking More of the area than I am about the people you know, you know. But after That, after they, they, they called me And. I said, hell nah, man, you lying. So I come, I say, bro, man, man, what's up, bro? you Like man. Nothing I said. What you mean? Nothing? And something up. What's up? I said, man, You know you ain't, you know, You know you ain't gonna fuck around And off yourself, And. He say, man, That, That shit didn't even happen.


It didn't, I didn't feel I said It didn't happen. I didn't feel Like. we I didn't know what Fentanyl was. you feel what I'm saying? To be honest with you, Like, Like, Like, he said Like It was a crazy pill. Like, I didn't, I didn't, I don't, I wouldn't have asked for, Hey, look, you got Fentanyl. you feel what I'm saying? I just, what Drug was It was It Perk. It was fentanyl. It was a perk. you know, It was perk, you know, mean. So once, once I, once I took It, I didn't believe It. you feel what I'm saying? So when It, when It happened, I felt Like. I felt Like. Now I'm obligated to tell my story. And. So It can help somebody. That's in, you know, that's fighting addiction. you know what I mean? We just lost our Atlanta legend. know, Rest. Peace. you feel what I'm saying? Like you. That's right. you know, And, And for me to be there, And made It through I.


Think That, you know, I I should use these, this platform. That, I have, you know, That, he shares with Me. And. And, then And. Then It was also after we lost our partner, our partner Peanut. The Dun Peanut. The Dun Peanut, The Dun Like kind of. He, he died the same way. Same way. you know what I'm saying? But for, it's a calling on this man life. So when you say, why is he sharing It, I? Don't think he has a choice. No I feel Like. He would kind of position to, to survive all the stuff. That. He survived And to have the effortless connection with community. you know what I'm saying? If, you go anywhere in Atlanta, you gonna see Joe Cousin I. Don't give a damn where you go, where what part of the city you in. you go see somebody who related to Yo Joe And.


He done been to every high school in the city. He know everybody. And, you know, to have That community tie, but then have this testimony That, you can share with these people. And. you know what I'm saying? To inspire And uplift Like. That's, that's special. you know what I mean? Like Drew do give you, give rich pastor energy. Rich pastor know Pastor Drew If. you do. That's why the thank God re makes so much sense to me. When I hear It Know I, I feel Like. I feel Like. I have you know the ability to give a ministry, not a minister. you know what I mean? know Like, you know, Like to, you know, you know, being, growing up in the church, And stuff.


Like, That, you know, I just came back to That. you know what I mean? But you know, this right here was a blessing. Man. And, you know, tip called And was Like. Hey, I, think you should start to tip. 'cause I did a lot of interviews in the, in, in the beginning. And the And. And. I didn't want to say It. you know what I mean? But I said It on this track. And, I thought That, I should, should say It to God first. you feel what I'm saying? And on That platform. That Was the first time you really made the announcement. People knew That, you was you, you was clean. But they didn't know Like what got You. They didn't know. know Like just Like. The question you asked, what made you And? I used to always beat around It. And. I was Like. we I ain't Ready to say It yet. you know what I mean. But when, when he came along, And said, I think you should start telling It. I was Like. What? What better way you tell, how Did you feel?


Go ahead. How did you feel after you're in the studio? And, you finally said, it's on, on the record. Like, did you feel weight lifted off of you? Or did you, were you anxious about how people would respond to knowing exactly what happened? Or I felt Like. A weight lifted off of me because of where, where we recorded AT. With, with Kurt. With Kurt Franklin. I overdosed in That studio. Wow. Wow. So I. Think That. Where God, where I broke myself. AT God built me right back up. you remember That Know, was That a purposely done thing? you or do? I just ended up back AT That Studio know God just put It. It just happened That way. you know what I'm saying? And, I. And. I was shamed to go back to the studio. And, And. I was And. I, And, And. I was, you know, I was talking to God. I was Like. I don't want to go back in there. And. He was Like. Go back in there. And. Watch what I do you know what I Mean? So you knew you was gonna record this, know record, but you, you, you didn't even Know I.


Didn't know That. Wow. Wow, Wow, wow. We. He was actually AT the studio for something else. I think he was working on the PSC album. So he was in the studio for something else. And. Then I was just Like. Hey, Kurt, Kurt Onaway. He was Like what? know, know, I'm finna do mine now I'm finna go on. you know what I'm saying? So he went on And Laid, laid his lady Verse down. Right then That Day. But It It It was definitely ordained. Like Like, Initially Vibe know I was ashamed to go back to the studio because everybody was there. you feel what I'm saying? know So And. So until, so, when we started working on the PSC album, I just was Like. you know what I'm saying? And. See, that's something he never even told me. I didn't even know I didn't, I I wasn't cool with coming back in there, you know, feel me?


After I been laid all out on the floor. If, If. you know what I'm saying? But once I, once I got the opportunity, I just swallowed That, took That, walk of shame, went back in there, And recorded not knowing That. God was going to rebuild me. And give me a platform to actually share with people what happened to me right there. And, you know, get the glory out of It. you dig what I'm saying? Did you hear God in That moment? Did you Like I heard him in That moment. Wow. know I Was gonna ask, did you, did you deal with why you needed, or why you thought you needed those pills? Was It upset? Was It I wanted to turn up? Was did you think you needed It to make a record? Did you deal with That? Part of It? Because that's the part. That scares me with any artist. 'cause it's Like. you take It feeling Like, it's gonna take you to someplace else. And. It's Like. we What made you feel Like?


I had to take That pill To It. It. It started out with Like, just having fun. And, you know, in the hood getting high. But then It made me feel Like. I needed It to make good music. you know what I'm saying? And And, actually, It just stimulated And. I used to just write crazy And. Then It It got to the point where Like It became an an addiction. So It That went out the window. Music went out the window. And. Then I was Like Oh. we I need It to, you know, do this And, do That know You, know what I'm saying? Plus from trauma, you know what I'm saying? Things happened to me when I was younger. you know what I mean? Being shot. And introduced to Demerol. And addicted to That in the hospital. And, you know, from, from the, from the way I got whoopings as a child.


That, That, That trauma. you know what I'm saying? we, we don't talk about That enough. Honey know, Lord That, Mercy, I, I, I. It's trauma. know, that's discipline. That's Not extension Cord. know we extension cord And stuff with An extension cord. I ain't I. Ain't I can't speak on That. You I stitch And stuff. Like. you see what I'm saying? We was tied up And beat Like, but, but tied up Like. But to be honest with you, my family, Like, we, we thought my mama had five boys. So It was hard to discipline. You know five boys on her own. Where are you? Youngest, oldest, middle. I'm right after the oldest. Okay. you know what I mean? So when she laid the belt down, And, It was necessary because right.


All of us are living today. None of us are really Like That bad of people. But And, she did the best. But when you whipping Like That, you have to be careful about how you do It. And. Now, It is cool to whoop your child, you know, And discipline them. But If, you gonna beat the shit out of 'em. Then you might, as we get Ready for something in them. That, you don't know about know, you know what I mean? Because now That, I'm older. She's probably surprised That when she hears this. Right? you feel what I'm saying? How Does That affect you with your kids? How you discipline your kids? I. See, I I, I've recognized It. And. I'm not gonna do It to That degree, right? I'm, I'm a straight mind. But I ain't gonna go That far know? 'cause I don't want the repercussion. I feel Like, I feel Like. I feel Like. As far as, as far as child discipline is concerned.


They just need to know That. They can get they ass whooped. you see what I'm saying? If, you don't always have to whoop they ass, but you got to do It. you gotta lay It down one time. And, they're Like. Hey, you, you remember? Okay, now you see what I'm saying? So see, y'all got boys. I got all girls. So it's different. I, don't you don't be mine. AT all If. you, you, you girl, man, you can't whoop you girl. That's what I'm saying. Y'all got, you know, you got a strong black woman with you. That's right. you know what I'm Absolutely, Hey man, I want to apologize to my friend. I. I got beside myself. I, I shouldn't have took feelings to That. That's all. you know what I'm saying? I, I ain't That dude right there, man. you know what I'm saying? I ain't finna be slapping no goddamn battle. you Know what I'm, Hey man, it's all good. That's My, that's my dog.

We gonna grow together. If. you know what I'm saying? know. So, you know, I just had to make That. So we gonna have good time. We gonna have bad times. Absolutely. Absolutely. you know? But one thing we ain't gonna have in no broke times. I'm telling you, you That. No sir. you, you did say It was something. Your daughter was on drugs too. You said know my, my little girl ended up picking up drugs. So, but It happened. Just Like. How I did It when I was 17, 18, you feel me? And And. It just played back. And. It's the generation generational curse. That Like. How my father was, my father picked It up. AT, That age. And. He did It for 50 years. you feel me? Then I picked It up, And. Then I I lived That way. Then my little girl, I, And, I And I was thinking about It. And. All of this happened before I went to rehab. The overdose. This And.

That, you do where you're in the schools, talking to the kids. When you're talking to the kids, Like, what are you dissecting from your story to, 'cause some of the kids I saw in these videos were really young. So what are the main issues you're seeing with the kids? And. And. How do you take your story? And kind of mentor them up a bit. So what what what we do is It It still takes a village. We are in the communities. And And in And in the schools. And in the homes. And. We do Like interventions. And, I use what I've been through. And And. Then my, my manager to Dr. Sierra L, she is Like. She's been a LPC for 20 years. And, she's into mental And, behavioral health. you feel what I'm saying? So when we, when we come in And, when we come into a situation, Like I try to I try to bring the street part into It.


you feel what I'm saying? And let people know, you know what to do when you're Like. Conflict resolution, If you out in the street, And you feeling Like. you don't want to be no lame And And, this And That. But some, sometimes they diagnose these young kids with things That.

you know, And, And, I. Think That. The, the jury That we had could see through a lot of the shenanigans. And, nonsense. That. The other side was trying to pull, although I understand the other side's position, you know this guy, he's, you know, It, he's a billionaire, right? know And, And, And. I'm sure he not in That. Motherfucker looking every day AT, who does And trying to say what? So I'm sure there's some people who he had put in position who probably didn't want to do some work, right? And just say, you know what? I could just take this And do this, And, then And, And, And, That. He won't know, you know, And, he probably didn't And your as Mr bro. And then. But now, hey, the craziest thing is if they probably would've offered you guys a deal, you guys probably would've did a deal with them.


know back in the beginning, know absolutely man. I mean Like. AT the AT, AT, AT AT. The beginning. We've had several mediation And. He just never wanted to, he never wanted to come to the table. And mediate. you know what I'm saying? He never even thought That. He even had to consider, you know, Like Like resolving this. Wow. know I mean I get It because Like Like, you say corporations do It all the time. I get, people are so used to It, it's become the norm. He didn't think That, It, It deserved any consideration. Luckily the judge, And the jury thought different. Congratulations. It was your first thought. When y'all, when the ruling came down for the window, Like, what was your first thought? Thank God, man. I ain't know That's It. That. I man. I. I was with kp.


Actually, And, we were actually And. I And. I was filming Like. I didn't make It to the, to the day for the, the court, the de when the, when the deliberation was handed down. So you must have thought you were gonna lose And when you wasn't there. I wasn't. I had to shoot a movie. I, I, I J we just got through shooting apartments part too. And as a director, you know, I got to be there. I can't And. I. I took one week off. And. They said It was gonna be done. That week. And. Then the next week, Like It was supposed to be done by Friday. They started, they went into deliberation on Friday. And were supposed to come back Friday with the verdict, but they didn't. So they said it's gonna be Monday. I said, man, I can't come back Monday. I got to go back to work. So I did. And, I'm on the phone.


And, I'm Listen. More, I'm Like. And, And, And. We we still shooting too. We still supposed to be filming. It was a shot. I said, man, y'all handle It. Y'all don't handle It. No, no. He said, you handle It. I was Like cut. Hey man, know, 'cause I I I walked off in the middle of a scene. And And. So they still doing And, Like, Hey, deal. What's I was Like man. And, And. Then K, KK KP said I cut. I cut. I could tell you how I felt. I was Like. you remember what we had talked about? Make sure you gimme my little p That's all I need. But I didn't know no number. I was, I was Listen. More, And. I heard him say, you know, That, you know That Like, the first infringement or so on And, so forth, And, they were taught It went down a list of dolls.


Which one did, which one didn't. But then I heard a number. I heard 17 point some million. I say 17 million out loud. know I. Did I say 17 million And? Everybody look AT me. And Say, huh, And. So I hung up the phone. And. Then we had to go fly to Vegas to do a show. Oh, Arizona. We had to fly to Arizona to do a show. And, while we on the plane. They, they, they went back into the liberation for punitive damages. And. Then they came back with the punitive It said 53 million. 53 million Say, plus the 17 I said, got That know, turn the plane around. Look AT God, turn the plane around.


I said, God, you And I text again. I was Like. Don't forget That p I said, man, you better stop showing That, Like this. God, you better stop showing That Like this. Now And them lawsuits are tax free. So there's no Tax taking off. No, that's not true. Oh. Damn. See, don't put That out there. Like, That. Now the the actual damages for the actual damages, there are no taxes because the taxes, so actual damages are, you know what? Whatever dolls, That, they say, look, the most Like the girls, what those dolls made. So those are actual damages. And, And, And, the, the taxes were already put into the, they were taken from the gross before this. So the taxes were paid on this money. So this, on this, no, we on the punitive, you do have to, you do have to pay taxes.


Shit, it's still a come up. Still A link. I mean, man, no, it's a blessing. You downgrade. you, you come, you right know. But I, but even More. So I love to see Like. My daughters, my daughter And, my nieces Like, they also Like. They, they straight, you know what I'm saying? know I saw people saying That on social media. They was Like I. Hope they get a girl something. I'm Like What the, what kind of stupid ass statement. Nah, man. Nah, It is they fight. you feel what I'm saying? And And I feel Like for them to be vindicated. And, you know, the, the, the the come out victorious And to see That If.


you stand up for something. you know what I'm saying? And, And And. you And, you know, That, you know, in your heart. Truly That you, That you fighting for, for what's, what's, what's yours. you know the outcome is going to be victorious as long as you claim It. Believe It And And. Let God lead the way. I, I I. I'm happy to be a part of the process of of, of allowing them to see That. Wow. And. Now, now sometimes you And there's Some More paper in there. Now I'm gonna just tell you, there's some More, some More, because there's some More. Do That came up. That look, Like, other celebrities, I'm just telling you, there's some More money out there.

Nah, I mean, you know, I mean I mean they have the right to appeal. And You know, man, they can exercise their right. Then that'll open the door for trademark. So trademark means, now we looking AT, all the do. So If, you wanna open up the door for trademark, you going open up the door for trademark, go on And appeal And.

It's long overdue. you know what I mean? I have I feel Like. That If. you If you love the craft. And respect It Like the way I do. Because you know people, you know, people can get your music, you know, to get your album or whatever. And, And, that's one thing for somebody to have your album. But I think That. Once the album died down, And, then, you know, It, It, It just only depends on your talent. And what you have to offer in a live show. you feel what I'm saying? Like Oh, we, you know, I wanna see Joe perform live?

I'm going to make sure That I set aside time. And use my vocals to put back into what happened to me. you know what I mean? And for And. Use It for Like. A positive outlook on things. But I will not stop telling my truth.


And, what, what's happening to us as, as a community? And what society is, you know, has to offer us. you know what I mean? Like I won't, I won't shy away from telling you how I took a a, a pill. That killed me. I won't shy away from telling you That they serving them. you feel me? I won't shy away from telling you That. Most of most of the things That we do in the hood comes from Like drug use. Like, a lot of things. That, That go on in the hood, man. People be using drugs And with the mental state That. We have man, we we out here doing the wrong stuff. you know what I'm saying? So I won't shy away from That. And I also use my my platform to do songs with people.

Talk about King about to have his his first child. Is That. Is That true? I mean. I mean. Listen, I mean I. He, because He seems Like the child. I gave you the most problems, Man. I mean, to be honest with you, I'm gonna just be, I'm, I'm gonna keep It, I'm gonna keep It a book. King is, you know, he's a a he's always been a rambunctious, outgoing, energetic child. you know what I'm saying? But J And, j just to be honest, he as fuck compared to me And the shit That I did.


And. How he ain't really gave them kinds of problems, you know what I'm saying? He gave something. That might resemble Like. It could, you know, become That. But he never, he ain't never, you know, did the kinda shit That I was doing. That You know about. So I don't, I can't say That, you know, he just gave me a whole lot of problems. But the problem That, he did get, he, he did give, he gonna get 'em back because he gonna have a son And his son. I'm just telling you now, I'm just telling you And, he gonna understand. He gonna understand what It mean. He King used to do shit. Like, lemme tell you something. So I put, you know, major And I wanted to put Major And, And And, king And Like one of the best schools in Atlanta.


Woodward. And, we went And Dasia had already went to Woodward, And. So now you know, It was time for Major to find him a new school. And, I'm Like, we you put major there with man. We'll put King there with him. So It take Major And. King And, we do the test. you know, you had had That, the, you know, the consultation And, they had had the kid take a test, And what have you know, major pass flying colors. And. He was Like major. Sure, I'm sure we find a spot for him. He's definitely with with material. He say, but your other side, is he okay? Is he Okay? I said what you mean? Is he okay? He said these are the lowest test scores we've ever seen with That.


Man. Done went in here And intentionally failed, failed On purpose. That's Right. And, he wouldn't have to go to private school, man. He wanted to stay in public school out there with his friend And. So he Like. That's the kinda shit he did. you know what I'm saying? Like, Like ain't bad, but It, Like, you know, It actually Shows his genius. we It does in, in a crazy way. That shows genius. You know how to stick around You know You know how to be where I wanna be. He Still didn't get to be way he wanted to be. I sent him way on the other side of town to another school. That, he couldn't stand, you know? But he made through, he stuck through It, And, you know what I'm saying? And. Then Covid happened. And. So That kinda shined on him. Now there was another video of you And Booie talking to your sons about the video with the, with the, the firearms in It You know.


So how was That conversation? Because You know he was just Like dad, come on dad. You You, You You know man. He don't ever Like. He, he always look AT me Like bruh coming from you. Do you Know your life, man? you know what I mean? Like That. How you, I'm Like. Nah, nah, nah. you, you didn't even know me back Then, You feel me? And. But he done heard a lot of stories. Like, you know, just Like, me, And, DRO sit around And, talk about It, And. Then you hear my other uncles And, aunties And my mama talk about how they had to deal with me. you know what I'm saying? So he Like, how you gonna come tell me anything? And, I'm nigga Like this, you know what I'm saying? But That, that's actually a part of a show. That, we remember me Booie know And too.


So That was, That was a part of a show, but It was a real video. And It. We did actually Like I think I think the camera people knew what was going on, but they didn't necessarily tell us. So when we walked up, we was kind of really, really kinda in shock a little bit. For real. We knew we were coming to film, but we didn't know That. This was gonna be It, you know, you know, I thought It was gonna be More. So just Like them, you, our cars, And, you know, trying to imitate a life today. But I ain't know nigga I ain't know y'all finna do all this, you know? So That was a real moment, but It was, you looked Like, you was running off, you was Like. I can't be nowhere around this. know I outta here. know I had to know And man was one of the funny part. I don't know if this is on the clip.

If, you, you, you gonna have to pay. you gonna have to pay, pay your dues, Like. you know what I'm saying? But all these things I, feel Like. It's important. And I. Feel Like I, I'm Agon And. Put I'm Agon And. Put the, because we did Like a pilot episode. I'm gonna go And, put It AT because I think it's important. And as I, watch It again. We sitting down And, we, we are as two black men.

I said, no, you can't take It there with him. you taking It with him. I, I, I, I don't know, but Bootsy said It. So It shit could mean anything. know I, Like, nah, That ain't gonna do It And. So just, just us feeding off of one another's wisdom. And experience And using It to benefit how we deal with our, our sons. That's something That, the rest of the World needs to see absolutely Know. How do y'all deal with the Like, the significant others of 'cause Like You know Damani has a baby. Now King, the the baby shower went viral.
