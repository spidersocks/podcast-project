Wake that ass up early In the morning. The Breakfast Club. Yep. It's The world's most dangerous morning show. The Breakfast Club Charlamagne. The God Jess. Hilarious Envy is out, but Lauren Laro is in and we got some special guests. Devale and Khen Ellis are here. Good morning my people. Good morning. How's everything? I'm blessed Black and Holly favor. How y'all feel? I love that. Blessed. Happy to be back. Back home. Looks so good. Y'all Good? It's a glow that I feel like I have the minute I hit LaGuardia Airport. It is just being back home in Brooklyn. I feel like it, it brings us to life again. You miss New York for real? I do. Yeah. I do. Not enough to move back. Not enough To move back. Sure. Well I come and get my little fix, you know, and get my bacon, egg, and cheese.


What I gotta get And I get back. There You go. There you go. Now y'all are here for a bunch of different things, but y'all rebranded the Dead Ass podcast to Ellis ever after. We did. Yes. Let's discuss. Discuss the growth of that title. Yeah, Well it was, it was a lot for us when we first started Deadass podcast. It was just, you know, it was like we were joking about men versus women and what husbands feel versus wives feel. But over the course of six years we watched how that kind of exploded on the internet. Yeah. And we don't want to take credit for being the reason why. There's a man verse woman debate, but the shit is annoying. Yeah. And we kind of just feel like we wanna put out content that people can say let's elevate and move forward. So let's talk about topics that really affect us. For example, we, we will take credit for this. In 2017, we've logged our third son being born at home.


Right. And we've v the whole process for, for about six months. Right. And a new study came out that as in of 2018, home births in black community have gone up. Mm. And we feel like that's a direct correlation for us showing young black girls. Like there's a different option. Yeah. And the reason why that happened was because with our first child, we almost lost Kay. And she had to have 24 stitches. A cervical 27. My bad. Let me not take on this Emini here. My watches Six. God, you know, we had babies. We know what it's, that's that's right. But no, you're right. But yeah, she had to have emergency surgery right after pregnancy and we did a lot of studies on black maternal health and we was like, let's just use our platform to focus on positivity. So we said s ever R is the change. 'cause this is us after we've evolved as humans on the therapy, worked on being a better couple, worked on being a better people.


So that's what it's about. So It had nothing to do with moving out of New York and not even using the term dead ass no more. No. We still, as still We still use the Tims with Yes, we sure did. We sure did. And the crazy part about it, we had to fight for the name dead ass initially. Because you know, if you're not from New York and if you're at this companies that have, you know, mostly white folks, that's just like, we don't know what that means. Yeah. How will we ever get ad dollars behind a name like that? They're not gonna subscribe to that. Sure. So there was a lot of explaining that had to be done, but we start, we stayed true to it. I think part of us really didn't want to detach from that New York persona for a long time. But it's been, it's time. I Do like Ellis ever after though. Who bought who? Who made that up? Y'all. Collectively or who that was? You.


It was, well Emini here, I'll take credit for it. But we always do everything collective. Even dead ass. Like we sit down and talk about it and we like what you think about this, what you think about that. Yeah. We had a couple other options. We also liked House of Ellis, but we liked Ellis ever after because it was the evolution of after what? After all the bullshit. You know what I'm saying? After all the talking about what we had to do to get to this point. Facts. And if, if you ever followed us, that's what we're known for. We're honest about what we've been doing, what we've done. We don't hold back. I tell us keep Doing what? 23 years in the game. Almost 15 married, you know, so people have literally watched us over the past maybe what decade? Yeah. On social media. Just putting our life out there, sharing with people. Yeah. You know, hoping people can relate.


Y'all are definitely the roughest point for a lot of people. Because even my son's dad, Rome, oh my God. My first son. My first son's dad. Man, he, man, you ain't, you gotta listen. Well this one is dead ass. And even y'all shows, he follows everything y'all do. And he has five kids by five different, you know moms, you know, and he likes to, he'll listen to one of y'all podcasts and he'll be calling them, telling them no, no, no, because deve what Deve and Kade said they, they was, you know, and wow. He gets hung up on it a lot. We appreciate that. Creates a lot of arguments. But he ain't, he ain't the deve type. I Would love to know how wrong that's, I Swear, swear I was over.


Yeah, you should just tell them, listen to the podcast. Don't try to preach. You ain't developed but It's right. 'cause y'all real life though. Like y'all, the way y'all been going through stuff on y'all. I watched y'all channel a lot. Yeah. The way y'all, y'all deal with stuff. Y'all were the first time that I saw a young black couple that was still like regular like Yeah, regular. Like so. And I was like, oh, they probably hang where I would go at and stuff Like that. And we still do. Yeah. We walk around and people be like, why y'all without security, why y'all? And I'm like, because this is my hood. Like what you mean? You know, dead ass. So Dead ass Felt like he could like relate to y'all. 'cause that's like a big thing for y'all audience. I will say this about Rome like Devale now wasn't the Devale when I first started. Okay. The Devale when I first started was probably closer to Rome.


I was, I don't know him. Yeah. But I was immature. I lacked emotional intelligence. I didn't understand I'm, This is How Rome wanted you Wrong. I love Rome, But I, I take pride in showing the growth because I don't want anyone to ever be like, I gotta be perfect to be accepted. Right. Nah, fuck all that. I was never perfect. I'm not perfect. I may fuck up again. Hopefully y'all giving me grace if I fuck up. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? That's what I want people to walk around the earth feeling like you don't gotta be perfect for people to just accept you. And if you expecting everybody to accept you, that's a problem anyway. And to be honest, some people just not gonna accept you back. Yeah. To no, to be honest, we almost just didn't do the podcast anymore.


So last February really, we had a bunch of live sold, sold out shows. Apollo, it was like historic. It was great. So we're like, you know what, why don't we go out on a high? Yeah. You know, we did all we've done, I feel like we've spoken aloud, you know, dealt with our issues publicly as a form of therapy through the podcast. Right. And we felt like we've done all we had to do in the podcast space. And people literally were like, you guys cannot do this. And to your point, we meet people on the regular, in the airport random places, and they're like, y'all can't stop doing this because you have saved my marriage or you've showed me that I'm able to open up to my partner and bring up these topics that are once taboo or uncomfortable to discuss.


You know? And people say they wanted devalue. You have to be a cadena and vice versa. So Tyrone may make sure that he's On the straight and narrow. Exactly. I I think one thing that that is great about what y'all do is it's just open lines of communication. That's it. Now, regardless if you're in a, you want to start a podcast, that's what you should have with your partner. Absolutely. If y'all want, just sit y'all living room every day and say, okay, we gonna talk for two hours, but we're going to talk. We may not record it and put it out. Yep. That's it. Right. And we're gonna talk. It's just about communication. Encouraging that. Absolutely. And you know what's funny, most people when we first started the podcast thought it was so crazy. Y'all talk to each other and I'm like, We married Each other like we married. And when you talk about sex, you talk about money. You Or how do, how could you talk to her like that?


Like people were offended for me. Yeah. They used to be real upset. They on me. I remember they used to. Yeah. Lemme tell you. They felt like you were like the super controlling, like arrogant is all about me guy. Yeah, they did. And I, And I, and that Was the farthest thing from it. But I had to Emini here from my perspective, but I Get it. Right. And I had to accept that because you have to show people over time. Right. You can't expect people when you first put something out to say, know who I am. Yeah. It took years. We did our podcast for seven years, 15 seasons won a webby award, but it took time in the beginning. It was so much like pushback of Devale, arrogant, the violent asshole. He always talks down. But what I realized, they weren't used to seeing an educated black man speak about his emotions. And it triggered a lot of women handedly, you know what I'm saying?


Like that's the fact. Like, I'm not gonna sit back here and, and not say what I need and require because I'm also gonna ask her what she needs and require and I'm going to deliver on that. But now this is my turn to talk about it. And a lot of people didn't like it. But now it's become more normalized. Like I used to when we lived in New York, I heard Charlemagne every morning talk about mental health. My sons now know about mental health. It's not taboo anymore at all. And they speak their feelings. Mom, I don't feel good about this. I'm nervous about that. And we want to keep showing young men like that's okay. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? To be like that. Absolutely. Especially when within our community, black men and women are always pitted against each other. Yeah. And if we want our black men to open up to us, why not create a space for them to do that? So I'm like devout. I want you to be honest with me.


It doesn't have to be a brutal honesty, but I want you to be honest and transparent about how you feel. Because I'm not trying to guess. Like, the good thing about Devale And I for the years that we've been together is that we've always given each other a choice. Yeah. Yes. And the choice happens because we are fully communicative about the things that we want and need. So every morning I wake up with the choice to be here And I decide to be here. And it's been working for us. You know, y'all been together 22 years, 20 about be 22 years. Me and my wife been together 26. It'll be 27 this year. Oh, right now Babe. I want to ask the ball, when did you And I, this this, it's gonna sound crazy to some people listening. When did you realize Kade was a safe space for you to be your absolute most vulnerable?


Wow. That's, that's a good question. That's a good question. And I always preface, I'm gonna preface by saying this. The first five years of our marriage was terrible. Right. And it wasn't terrible for the reasons people think it was terrible. People automatically assumed it's terrible because of infidelity or money. But that wasn't it. It was terrible because I did not feel safe telling her how I felt about things. Mm. So I bottled it up, I suppressed it. I would go in the bathroom, sit on the toilet, turn the shower on. I'd be crying trying to figure out where, you know, what I was gonna do with my life because I'd just come from being in the NFL making a lot of money. Had to start all over again. Mm. And I felt like less of a man, but I can't tell that to my wife. And it was one day she was pregnant with Cairo. And I had said to her, we was having a whole argument about stuff And I was just at the point, and you know how it is when you a man, you get to the point where you just don't care no more word up.


I was done. We was getting a divorce. And I was like, you know what, you lazy. You don't, you don't trust me. You don't believe in me, you don't do all this stuff. She's like, devour, I'm not lazy. I'm fucking pregnant. And I was like, the hormones, like the attitude, like the, the nausea. She was like, I was trying to find a way to surprise you and tell you. And I said, well why didn't you just tell me? And then when I said, why didn't you just tell me? It hit me, why don't I just tell her what I'm going through? That's Right. That was the moment I wrote about it in our book. We Over Me New York Times bestseller by the way again. But it was that moment I said to her, why didn't you just tell me? And then it was like, Bing, why don't you tell her? And from that moment on, it was 2016, the minute I feel something, sometimes she don't be in the mood.


I'm like, yo, we gotta sit on and talk. And she be like, All right, here we go. Happy. And I tell her, and the minute we done, we've made a decision that we not gonna argue about it. We are not gonna harbor no resentment if we don't agree. We don't agree. But this is how I feel. This is how you feel. And we work towards, you know, being better. That's Why I asked because it doesn't matter how long you're with a person, don't and it don't have anything don't to do with you. It's really just us as men. Absolutely. You know, when do we realize, okay, this is a safe space. This is this woman that I have devoted my life to. To mother of my children is a safe space for me. It's hard for men to find safe spaces, man. Yeah. But You know why though? Yeah. We don't, I can't even find safe spaces amongst my boys. Forget a woman. If I go to tell my homeboy that I'm feeling the way, nigga you soft bitch ass.


And it's like, am I, you know what I'm saying? You asking am I, you know what I am. Let me, let me toughen up. Up. Yeah. So if my homies feel like that about me, I can't tell my girl I'm going through it. It took maturity. It took me to realize that I chose this woman and she chose me to spend the rest of our lives together. What my homies think, don't matter what The World think, don't matter as long as we can get on the same page. So she's always the first person I go to now. Now. Yeah. But it wasn't always like that. And that's when we struggled the most. Yeah. And there's a resilience there. 'cause think about it, he, we could have thrown in the towel a long time ago. So when we meet people now and they're dating phases and they're just like, what should we do? They writing for advice on the podcast all the time. And we're just like, I feel like this generation at least coming up, nobody wants to put the work in.


Yeah. Nobody wants to tough things out. Nobody wants to be honest. You show up as a representative of yourself and you're expecting someone to be honest with you. Yeah. You know, it's, it's really hard out there. So we went through that together and it was hard as individuals trying to grow at 17, 18 years old, now we hit the fourth floor. Yeah. You know, we're 41. It's like so many years of trying to grow together to respect each other's space. Figure out who we are, grow as individuals, raise children at the same time. Emini here, when I look back on our, our years, it's, it's insane. Yeah. Yeah. I love how transparent y'all are with the public and even with y'all fans. Like, you know, y'all built such like a fan base for like marriages and you know, people who been even divorced, like, look for y'all for Yeah.


Look to y'all for advice because y'all put it out there, the highs and the lows. Right? Yeah. How do y'all handle disagreements in front of your kids though? Because if y'all, y'all real with us, right? How is it? And then, you know, parents, you got two types of like situations like that. A lot of parents don't like their kids to see them disagree. That's not us. Like that's not realistic. Not though. So We handle disagreements as a family spot on. We, if we disagree on something and the kids are there, we gonna have a discussion. And the minute we have a discussion, I will go to Jackson and say, you see how I spoke to your mom? You see how I don't gotta be disrespectful? You see how I don't gotta raise my voice? Do you understand what it means to have empathy to so towards someone who thinks differently than you? And they be like, yeah, I, I see it.


Yeah. And I'm like, now understand this, me and your mom may disagree but that's my wife because they gonna be somebody's husband someday. They have to see what it's like. So I never wanted to put my kids in a situation where I was, my parents never argued in front of me. But then they would go in the room and be screaming and hollering. Right. And I'd be like, yo, what is going on? Then your pops come out, you like, dad, why you talking to mom like that? And he looking at you like, boy that's my wife. Right. Don't Check it. I'm like, no Explanation. I'm like, all Right. Yeah. But then that didn't give me any emotional maturity to deal with my wife for the first five years. Mm. Right. So there was a couple of days where I came home And I was making, making money. She wasn't working and the food wasn't ready 'cause she had Jackson. And I'm like, what's going on?


Because I'm thinking that this is where the man's supposed to be supposed to be. And she was like, she from Brooklyn. She's like, The fuck who Talking to? I'm like, well that's not the response my mom gave my dad. You See the neck in the shoulder starts to go in. Right. I just started to realize like that's was, that wasn't the way like it, the stuff that we saw growing up. And we just felt like if I emulate this, I'll be successful. Wasn't making me feel good. We didn't know no better Emini here. We didn't Emini here. That's what you was learning from just observing. Like no, there's no manual that comes with any of this. That's why I, you know, I, I I give my my father a lot of grace because when me and my father had a real conversation and he told me about his mental health issues And I knew about his substance abuse. Yeah. It just made me realize, oh he just a man trying to figure it out like I was a man.


Talk about it. Charlamagne. That's it. That's it. Two months ago my dad stayed with us to help with the boys. Oh yeah. That's a good story. And I'm gonna try to talk about this without crying. 'cause my, I watched my dad and my mom came and it was the same thing happening and my dad was kind of short with my mom And I was in the car. Now I'm grown so I'm driving and my dad gets short with my mom and I'm like, yo, you having a little tantrum for no reason I need to chill. Right. And my dad looking at me like, nigga I'm still your pops. But he's still like, you know what, we talk about this later. We go in the living room and we have like a three hour conversation And just like your dad, he was telling me all the things he'd been through, all his fears, all his worries. And for the first time I saw my father as a human. And I said, yo, you were just trying to do that.


You got married at 21, you had me at 22 then my brother at 24. Wow. Like who taught you my, my grandfather was a army guy. Yeah. Didn't talk much, you know what I'm saying? Dudes, I say not as I do follow my lead like nobody spoke. Yeah. So after speaking to my father, man, my heart got so big because I saw him as a person. Like now he, my dude now like yo pops this tall. And here's the funny part, he said to me at the end of it, I gotta be better for your mom. I was like, that's why I said I'm trying to do or not cry 'cause my mom is my heart. Yeah. You know, you grow up in a house and you, when my mom's small sta, she's five too. And my dad is six foot. He big. Right. And I see sometimes my mom just be like, I'm not even dealing with him today.


And I told her, my mom don't have a voice in this house because sometimes you don't give her a voice. And he looked at me and said, I'm gonna do better for your mom and for the rest of the like the week I saw him try, now he still had the slip ups like we all do. Like I do. You know. Yeah. But he tried And I was like, this is making me feel good. 'cause it's not always about paying it forward. Sometimes you gotta pay it back. Teach that generation how we do things now and he's open to it. You know, Our, our podcast even we meet people who are older than us and they will be like, wow you guys, you guys are younger but you guys have, are talking about things that I've experienced my entire life. Right. We've actually opened up the gates for discussions too with my side of family as well. Coming from a Caribbean household, like having discussions about how you feel about things like that wasn't really a thing.


And my mom has opened up to her Son-in-law. Yeah. She talked to N in ways that she hasn't even opened up to me. And I feel like as a family unit Yeah. Intergenerationally we're starting to just heal so that way we can pass that down to our boys, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And to piggyback off of Devale with your question Jess, they see sometimes the disagreements but there is such an abundance of love in our house. Yeah. That we sometimes get flacked for. Yeah. Devale, you know, grabbing my ass or you know, walking past and kissing and you know, Kai, our second son will be like, get away from each other. But the love is so abundant that the moments that we may have disagreements it far is like outweighed by what they see between mom and dad and the love that we share.


I love That you said that your mother-in-law's talking to you now. Yeah. Like differently now. Like what are the conversations like now at this stage of the, of the marriage versus where they were prior? Un once again understanding where to meet my mother-in-law, my mother-in-law's, a West Indian woman from Jamaica came here when she was 17. There's a lot of intersectionality between West Indian people and American people. Right. But there's also a lot of disconnect. Right. Coming here, a lot of West Indian people just thought that Americans were lazy because we wouldn't do the jobs that they were willing to come over here and do. And I had to explain to her our thought process as black Americans and what we fought for. But us even talking about history as black people led to me understanding like, why did you come here?


She said, I came here from at 17 from Jamaica looking for a better life. I came here by myself, had to live with my mom's friends. If I came home late from working at Burger King, I had to sleep in the hallway on the floor. 'cause they thought that I was out gallivanting. Mm. I started to see her. Yeah. When I started to see her and realize who she was and realize how she protected the things she loved, I understood why she was so hard on me when I was coming after and court courting her daughter. So once I was able to put my wall down, 'cause I saw her, I was able to understand and then once I put my wall down, she put hers. Mm. And now in the house, that's my biggest ally. 'cause when she's my mother-in-law will be like kadeem.

It was a maid, right? Yeah. It'd be a different character. Yeah. Yeah. Because I don't know why I thought right in it Nurse. Yep. When you said that you, like y'all were talking about the fact that when he asked you to do it, you was like, mm, I don't really know about that but we can meet in the middle. And he was like, no, this is what I want though. Yeah. Very specific. And I'm like, yo, if I had that conversation in my group chat, my friends probably would hate my person after that because they would feel like, hold on, what's going on here? 'cause you should be able to make your choices. But for you it was like, well I wanna make sure that my men, you know what Emini here like Because who are we trying to appease the group chat or my men. Right? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But even talking about that publicly, I was like, oh, like they y'all be really getting to the shits. Well Lauren don't, she don't have a man. So like the group chat, not even, yeah.


Potential. So You, She was with girls this weekend in Atlanta. She, we had the Black Effect podcast festival. She was surrounded by studs, then she went to Magic City, got with a scruffle and living your life. She Living the at life. Ain't mad at I, hey like You said Yellow. Exactly. Steve Emini here. Do you guys discuss how far you're gonna go in those real conversations? 'cause getting into the bedroom, I was like, dang, nothing's off limits. Emini here. Really Not. Yeah. Emini here. Emini here. Everything's pretty much been on the table with us. There's nothing that's, and we feel like if we show up as our true selves, nobody could hold nothing against me. Nobody. There's no room for you to create a narrative. You know, it's funny, we have, with the evolution of the podcast now, a new segment that we've introduced that people are loving so far and it's called op or No op.


And it's pretty much, do you have an opinion about this bat or do you not? Okay. Right. So we've realized that with social media, everybody got a phone, everybody got an account. So everybody got an opinion. Everybody an opinion sometimes about things. You have nothing, no knowledge about, no facts, no expertise. But everybody wants to comment on something. So we are trying to now push forward that the battle of sex is done. Now we're trying to push forward thinking to myself, do I, am I of sound mind? Do I have the facts to be able to comment on something and have an opinion? Or can I just let, so things go? You know, like, let's start that as a culture.


Like we don't always have to have an opinion about something. Yeah. Like you don't, I don't need to know if you think you can be the gorilla. Yeah. So Let's start doing that. Like what do I think about, I don't know, what's the scenario that's happening right now? Current events? Any, anything in current events? Michelle Obama and the Barack Obama stuff. Oh. And Kanye said, you know, he was sucking to his cousin's pen. So. So perfect example. Perfect example. Perfect example. Somebody asked, asked me, Brazil, how you feel about that? I don't feel about that. How do you feel About Kanye sucking? Somebody asked you. That's how it be. Somebody really Asked you that. Sometimes you get interviews, I go interviews, I'll go do press. Yeah. And it'll be press about the book. Right. And I, first thing I sit down is like, some guy, you guys here, you have a book coming out, Kanye West said, and I'm like, what the fuck does that gotta do with my book?


I'm here. Right? And they're like, well what'd you think about it? I don't think about it. Right. I didn't, until you told me about it. I didn't know what happened. Right. So I don't have an opinion on it. And they're just like, you don't, I didn't Get from your family to the dick that he was Because let's think about The World bow. Exactly. I wouldn't even, or So we don't even Entertain You see how they tried to correlate It? Yeah. I would come in on the family tip like, well Kanye said he can't see his kids because he came out. I would've Actually, well Emini here. That's, that's how they tried to like Yeah, yeah. Did. But ultimately it's click bait because what they wanted was to be like Devale talks about Kanye. Yep. That's ultimately what they wanted. Right. So we are trying to create a trend where it's like, say for example, Charlemagne, just ask what you think about it. And then the interview goes, I don't have an opinion. And then now you, and then what?


You're disappointed. Like It's like you didn't get you over. Nobody wanna hit. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody like I, I don't wanna talk about that. I don't wanna talk about any of that. I do wanna bring up something though. What's That? Because Lauren brought up about the sex thing, right. And I do want to bring up this point, right? Okay. If a man says this is what I require, this is what I want. The first thing in the group chat, all the girls is nah, you should be able to have a choice to da da da da. Right? But as her husband, I ask her, what do you want? What you require? It goes the minute. Minute. She says what she wants and require. Yeah. There's no negotiating. Yeah. So for us, what we're trying to show people is that there, there doesn't have to be a battle of the sexist. Yeah.


She said that her man want this, she gonna do it. He said his wife want this, he gonna Do it. And why would we not wanna do that for each other? Because who else am I do it for? I'm not pledging allegiance to my gender. I'm pledging allegiance to my partner. Like this is, that's a ball that for the rest of, make sure y'all get that on camera. And I'm saying Do this, do this. I seen my guy. Make sure you get that one. Make sure you zoom in real quick. Again, what I said again because I Pledge allegiance to PP My partner, I'm not pledging allegiance to my agenda. Pledging allegiance to my partner. Put that Right here. Partner, Partner, partner. You got, But No, but seriously though, that's why it's easy for me to just be honest because it's just like if your boys are upset, man, you said that.


Yeah. So like we ain't fucking like, well you not gonna do nothing for me. So yeah. So my wife wants this, this what I'm doing so Well I could, If you let me do you like Kanye. That was actually damn, never miss a moment. What happens In those moments though, where you or her are like, yeah, nah, but I'm just sitting on And I don't wanna do that. Then we talk about it And I, And I seriously, there's been times, there's been times like I'm like, yo, like yo, you ain't gonna dress up on that night. She was like, No, Not great. I'm like, word rain check. I'm a, I'm, I'm a rain check queen, honey. I'll be like, can rain, can I rain? Check that She rain for another day.


But then in the morning I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna be get a tap And I'm gonna open my eyes and then she gonna be in that nurse outfit or something. Because sometimes she not in the mood And we Get it. And you gotta understand that as a man Businesses, there's stuff going on, you know? Nah, you Ain't trying to fuck tonight. Okay. They always done. We got the rest of our life bro. Get that part. You know what I'm saying? Like, it, it is never a deal breaker. Like if you ain't doing this tonight, then it gonna be a problem. Nah, you don't wanna dress up tonight. Fine. Or sometimes she'll be like, you know what, I ain't dressing up tonight but I'm gonna bless you though and I'll dress up tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? We talk About about it. We trying to find a common guy. You know. Has there ever been a role that you ain't wanna play? You like, I ain't doing that shit. That's not Nah, We try to think about, I got, I got stories bro.


Only Thing was Kinky. Like you have dress up like a white girl and he dressed up like the black guy and Choke. Like Dr. Omar. She was the white girl. I was Dr. Omar And I, you Know what my Bad Dr. Omar, I know that's not sacrilegious to you. I don't wanna Go there. That Would actually be a really good role play. You Know what I'm saying? That's funny. Shut up bitch. Take this. Sorry. This was up in California story. Yes, I knew that's where he was going bro. So I I Was very specific. He was specific. What did you ask for? So it was like down to a detail. I had color contacts And I think I had done like a photo shoot or something. This is funny. This is funny, right? She had did a photo shoot with Janelle, but she had on these hazel color contexts, she had this big curly like weave.


Yeah. Like wig. It was like a big wig. I looked like different. She didn't like herself like somebody else. So I was like, yo. I was like, yo, I want you to put on that her back. Put her on a cheerleader outfit. Cheerleader Outfit. That's What it was. Bomb. Right? So now she's like, I got you babe. This was, this was new year. We were at our parents' house. We was having quiet sex for a couple days. So we was over it. Right. I don't wanna no more fucking, I'm trying to back back, you know what I'm saying? All that. So we get home in Cali, right. I'm ready. I'm sitting at the edge of the bed, I'm waiting. She come out, there's no weave. There was no contacts. And she had on the leotard, It was this real cute savage fifties, like pull in crotch lip. It was A vibe.


I had thigh to go with it. And I was like, this Fire, nah, it's not what I ask. And He was like, yo, he, this is literally what happened. Like that's not what I asked for. She, she walked over all seductively like she had music, we had a fireplace. She put the fireplace on. She's, I Was sat in the mood sexy swinging on straight Face like this. Right? So she get down, she got her hands on my knees, she going down, right? Then she get to the bottom and she like, what's up? Like this is like, what's this? Not this, this is Not on brand for you Sir. I'm like with the contacts, she's like, Devale, I'm downstairs right now handling business. And I said, no, we no contact. And you got on this dirty ass leotard that She said, that's not this dusty ass leotard.


I'm like, first of all, it's not a leotard, it's a teddy. And I had a, it was stained up. It was No, I said, because that wasn't what I wanted. He wasn't The what he wanted. I was just mad joint. I Was just mad. He was mad. And I was like, you did not get exactly what you asked for. It's a problem. I'm still here to do the job. Yeah. She didn't even have heels on. So I got mad. Right. So I got up And I go in the bathroom, right? But it just so happened when I walk in the bathroom, I seen all her heels lined up in the closet and we had just moved to this big house And I said, you got all these heels here, you ain't put no heels on. So I go in there And I throw all the heels off the closet. What the fuck? Dang. Sure did. Now this is the funny thing. He sure did. She goes, and I'm getting, I'm standing up. I was like, you gotta pick every fucking shoe up. Are you kidding me? She says to me, look at your stupid ass.


Isn't there throwing heels around and your dick's still hard. That's, that's what broke me out of it. That I looked at her, I started Laughing and we started laughing and babo Laughing After that. It was a wrap. It was just like, yo. Yeah, it was like, look at us, like look at us. Like look at us Shit. And I was like, and pick all the Shoes up. Yeah. So the shoes up. We sat there, we picked the shoes up, then we got in. That Was the one time, it's like he asked for one thing And I was like, here I'm doing something else. Cute. And he was like, sound like Y'all was role playing though. Yeah, he was. Y'all Marriage, yo, that's fun. That shit sounded like a Tyler Paris scene. You throwing the hill dick heels Dick swinging.


Yeah. No. Did y'all, y'all never thought about doing a reality show. We've turned out seven offers. We've turned out Offers several. Don't do it on your YouTube channel. So why not? This is crazy. That's a part why We, we control Everything. Everything. One, one thing I fear, 'cause we sat down with, And I don't want to put producers out there. We've sat down with a number of producers, right? This is always the first thing this so what's so and so? I know. I know y'all. You're perfect. I get it. Right. So there's nothing like you don't have anybody, like she's not, and I'm like, the first meeting stink. You're coming to me and asking me things that disparaging things that I could say about my wife. Wow. Man, get the fuck on my face. Wow. Like I'm not doing this. I get it. I got, I got four sons and that's what you want me to do, right?


No, I, I personally, I know this is gonna get some slack, but I love Bill Cosby, right? Yeah. Not for the things that he did, but for what he represented. This man was so brilliant and the fact that he had a black psychologist on the set of the Cosby show every day to make sure that everything they put out didn't show black people in a disparaging way. Right? Like when you think about the Cosby Show, a different world Lil Bill. Yeah. This is the content we want to create. We have a cartoon series that we've been pitching for our, about our kids called the Ellis in the Time machine because we wrote a book called The Ellison and the Time Machine. Why do we have to say Black Lives Matter and it's an animated series about history. These are the things I wanna do. I don't wanna get on television and argue with my wife about trivial stuff.


Nobody. I'm also not gonna include my friends. Right. For example, you friends are just hilarious what she like. I know that's the stuff, stuff they ask and I'm like, I'm not doing that. So like we not, we not doing the reality show thing unless we own it. Yeah. How y'all deal with people trying to bring out the like what? Like the negative or whatever. Because I remember when people were, a lot of people do still couple goals you guys, but I remember you guys had a conversation, I think you had it again on the Lovers by sh podcast too, about how when people post y'all as couple goals, people instantly are like, it's no way. It's as happy and as good as it looks. Oh, all the time. And people, it's funny 'cause we have a contingent of people who've been following us for so long, literally since our Brooklyn apartment days when Val was holding up his iPhone to now. So we'll have people who will jump in and be like, no, don't, don't comfort the Ellis.


Like if you're new here, clearly you don't understand like the track record that they have and what they've shared over the years. And it hasn't always been perfect. Yeah. But they've actually let us in to have a front row seat to see them work through their, their issues. I will say this though, when you learn to have empathy for people, right? I can understand that. If you grew up and you've never seen a positive black family and all you've seen is just despair and violence and anger. When you see this on Instagram, there's no way you're gonna believe this is real. There's no way. So I understand that. That's why I don't get upset at it. Like I look at some of my, my, my family and they look at me. These are people who know me and be like, you and ca really always happy are y'all.


And I'm like, nah, we not always really happy. But we talk about the stuff and they're like, you really talking, these are my family members. Right? So if, if a stranger who's never met me before feels that way, then I understand you've never seen it. How could I be mad at something that you've never seen before? That's, I have empathy. People typically Comment from I think two age a part of it too. 'cause like for me, I never, before I got here and saw like Charlemagne Envy be young in a marriage and be they're happy and they love, I don't know, young people who are just like happy married. Maybe you like it is, it's like they're old. That's why they're happy. 'cause they're like, it's where else you gonna go. Right? Right. Versus y'all are young living life. Your kids are growing up. Yep. Y'all are doing things. Y'all both are working and y'all are figuring it out. Absolutely. Figuring it out. And then people always ask us too, why, how do you guys keep this up for so long?


Emini here, you've been in the social media game doing all this for 10 years and y'all work a lot. How do you keep it up? And it's like, this is not a facade. Yeah. There's nothing to keep up. Yeah. We're not trending on something or status. I legit love her to death. Like this is just us literally recording and putting out our life. Oh, you put out so much, you guys share everything. We don't, we share a 62nd video that's one minute in a day. If you Go back and look, there's 1,440 minutes in a day. Right. I share one minute video that means, you know, one 1000th of what happened my day. Yeah. That All the time. You don't know these people Emini Here, You don't Yout it. Right. But we also gotta understand that they don't know us. So if they're commenting, they're commenting from their own experience.


Oftentimes it's projections. Yeah. I'm never gonna let someone else's projecting projection define my day. Hmm. Like I can't sit back and look at the comments and then just be like, oh these people, nah, unless you know a hit dog holler and you feel seen and you doing something unsavory. And I was like, damn. They see me. That's when you kind of feel a way. But I don't, I know what my intentions are. Yeah. So hey, you feel that way? That Is what it's, what's a question when it comes to personal issues between y'all, do you feel like you have to work it out in the public because of how much of y'all lives y'all share with the Audience? No, definitely not. No. There's a lot of things that happen behind closed doors. Again, to Val's point, you see a portion of what we share, you know, but we may after the fact talk about it on the podcast. Yeah. Like, Hey guys, we were going through this in this moment here.


We'll do that. Here's how we were able to internally process it, deal with it, overcome it. Yeah. Agree to disagree. And then we'll share it on the podcast and say, Hey guys, has anybody ever been in a position Facts where facts this has happened. Facts. And then more times often than not, you realize, damn, I'm not the anomaly here in this situation. Yes, yes. There are other couples, there's other men, there's other women who are dealing with the same things. We've even realized that sometimes there's women who are more like, I agree with Devale on this one. Sorry. Kay. Like that me. Yeah. Sometimes it Happens. That's me. That was me all day. Or vice versa. The guys would be like, Kay, you my girl, I felt you when you said this. So no. You know, some things we do still believe are for private places and other things can be for public consumption. Mm. Yeah.


'cause people will feel like they know your life based off that one minute that you were talking. Absolutely. Oh for sure. And then they create a whole narrative around it. A whole narrative. Like absolutely. Like when Kanye, oh I'm 14. I was sucking my cousin Dick. He could have been on the honor roll. He could have won a basketball game that day in school. I it how we get back here Five minutes. I'm just saying because people act like they knew him. I didn't know you though. But you absolutely right. You absolutely Right. I'm glad up. Listen man, the ball and Kade Ellis. I, I love talking to y'all because growing as individuals is a lot by itself, but growing as a couple is insanity. Yes. If you not constantly communicating, you know, you might wake up one day and not know who that person is. So we can learn anything from y'all. I appreciate that. To constantly communicate with your partner.


Yes Sir. Indeed. And thanks for growing with us too. Charlemagne Emini here. We've been on The Breakfast Club a couple times. Yes. Our third course Of the years. Our third time. Absolutely.

That that's work y'all are doing and y'all making other people do this same thing here. Like the things y'all are doing here talking about mental health. I can't stand politics 'cause it gets on my nerves. Mine too. Bringing the information to people is all we can do. Right. The greatest thing you can give humans is inspiration. That's right. And The Breakfast Club is inspiring people. I hope y'all know that. We appreciate y'all and this has been a part of our lives living here. Thank you. Yes. We and my kids know y'all too. They shared the kids.
