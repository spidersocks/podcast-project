0 (7m 14s):
Alright, well good morning Morgan.

11 (7m 18s):
Y'all fill in on this beautiful Tuesday. Blessed

10 (7m 20s):
Black and how Cleveland.

11 (7m 21s):
Oh yes, I love the energy. All right, so let's get into it. First step on the front page. The Trump administration is offering $1,000 to illegal immigrants if they self deport using a government app. Now the Department of Homeland Security said the payments will be made after their return has been confirmed through the Customs and Border Protection Home app. It's also known as the CBP Home App. Boy,

10 (7m 44s):
If y'all fall for that one, y'all crazy. If y'all get on that, if y'all get on that app and, and put in all your information to get that a thousand dollars, y'all are crazy.

0 (7m 53s):
Do they gotta pay for their own flight or does the government pay for the flight?

11 (7m 56s):
No, no. That is what Trump is essentially saying is that we're gonna set you up on a beautiful flight and send you home. So p Trump address

10 (8m 2s):
The program. I guarantee you won't leave with a thousand dollars either. I guarantee that that's a trap. So

11 (8m 7s):
He, he addressed the program while speaking at the White House yesterday saying those who choose to self deport could eventually return to the US legally. Let's take a listen to President Trump's comments on self deportation.

12 (8m 19s):
What we thought we'd do is a self deport where we're gonna pay each one a certain amount of money and we're gonna get 'em a beautiful flight back to where they came from. If they make it, we're gonna work with them so that maybe someday with little work they can come back in if they're good people, if they're the kind of people that we want in our company. Industrious people that could love our country.

10 (8m 41s):
He called it the company that right about that. Listen, if you fall for that trap, you crazy business.

11 (8m 46s):
So the app's webpage is estimates that once approved undocumented migrants would typically depart the US within three weeks. Those who submit their intent to voluntary self deport will also de be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure. So Trump also said that those who choose to adhere to the DE app, given through the deadline, the deadline given through the app will be deported and un with an unlikely path to return to the US Adding that, the process will be much tougher for those people. Yes. So it does well, you know, take it how you want to take it. A thousand dollars. Is it, is it worth it to you? In other presidential news, Trump is scheduled to meet with PR Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House today. Although he's not exactly sure why Trump believes the prime minister wants to make a deal with him on tariffs.

11 (9m 29s):
Let's take a listen to that audio.

12 (9m 31s):
I don't know. He's coming to see me. I'm not sure what he wants to see me about, but I guess he wants to make a deal. Everybody does. They all wanna make a deal because we have something that they all want. We have something that they all want. China wants to make a deal very badly. You see what's happening to China, China's being decimated And I don't want that to happen.

11 (9m 50s):
So the high stakes meeting between Trump and the Canadian Prime Minister is in the midst of the trade war between the two countries. Now Trump has also increased tension suggesting that Canada should be part of the US as a 51st state. And of course this will be Kearney's first trip to Washington since he was elected last week. So we will see what happens as a result of that. Also coming out of the White House, you guys that was announced yesterday that the NFL will be holding the NFL draft in 2027 NFL draft will be held on the National Mall in Washington dc. This will be the first time the city has hosted the event since 1941 when it took place at the Willard Hotel. So the bears selected Michigan halfback.

11 (10m 32s):
Tom Harmon father, father of actor Mark Harmon in that first overall pick. So it's a lot of stuff coming out of the White House, but you know, I'm gonna keep you up to date on all of that on your front page news.

0 (10m 41s):

Of them are. Well none of them gonna get paid. But just the audacity,

10 (11m 44s):
It's a trap.

15 (11m 45s):
Well it should be a trap. But if you would just focus on fixing America problems instead of messing with black and brown people, you wouldn't be in the process. The situation you are. I don't know why they don't get this. You know, like messing with us.

17 (18m 17s):
Because envy, envy sources came through because what happened? Future popped out with his dreads cut off and they are, his hair is like a blondish brown, but he has no dreads anymore and Rihanna has a baby bump. She and ASAP Rocky are expecting baby number three. Hey,

0 (18m 52s):
Ain't, why he ain't cut it all the way down every why, why he had a, you know,

17 (18m 56s):
No really? Why didn't he cut it all the way down? Because when I saw it I was like, he he could have cut it all the way down. Yeah, he looked

0 (19m 0s):
Like I did yesterday.

10 (19m 3s):
He said Keep your eye on future. Yes.

0 (19m 5s):
Keep your eye on the carpet. Because I knew he cut his, I knew he took his dreads out, so. Okay. I knew he took his dreads out. They actually took it out. They didn't cut it. They took his dreads out. So I just said look out for it on future and on the, on the red carpet. Oh, so he didn't cut 'em? He took 'em out. What you mean? Like he combed them out? I don't know anything about dreads but they, they said he didn't cut it. They took him out. I taste it. I don't know. I'm not telling y'all nothing anymore. I'm making me feel awkward and uncomfortable. All right.

17 (19m 27s):
Okay. Well yes, Rihanna. A said Rocky

0 (19m 30s):
Talk

10 (19m 30s):
Like a white woman. You make me feel awkward and uncomfortable.

0 (19m 33s):
Uncomfortable. You guys are gaslighting me please. This is not, this is not a safe place for me.

17 (19m 40s):
Rihanna. A said Rocky. As I mentioned, they reveal that they are expecting another baby. Yes. And he

0 (19m 44s):
Was so happy on our

17 (19m 45s):
Red carpet. Yes. Let's take a listen to Asat Rocky on the carpet, talking about the the baby.

18 (19m 50s):
It feels amazing. You know, we saw the hole in that, you know, and it's time to just show the people we was cooking up and I'm glad everybody's happy for us 'cause we definitely happy. You

19 (19m 59s):
Know what, Emini here, you guys have been cooking a lot these past couple years man. What's it mean to get, to have so many people celebrate and be happy for you guys, people that you may never even meet?

18 (20m 9s):
That's amazing. Honestly, it's a blessing nonetheless. 'cause you know how like some people in other situations at times could be envious of other people. But we've been seeing love for the most part, you know? And we real receptive to that and appreciate that. You know what Emini here, that's love. Love is love.

0 (20m 25s):
I love this. See, congratulations to them.

17 (20m 26s):
Yes. And and of course the fans instantly 'cause Rihanna before the Met Gala was just like in her hotel casually walking around with this baby bump. Like, we like no like, just like, Hey, I'm here. So the fans instantly started having a conversation about will we ever get music again? As they always do when she reveals that she's pregnant. And she actually addressed it on the carpet. She was talking to Essence, I believe. Let's take a listen to Rihanna.

20 (20m 46s):
I wanna see that, but that bump looks so good. Thank you. But the question is, how are you, how are you feeling? I'm good. I I'm shockingly feeling okay. Yeah. And not too overwhelmed at the moment. Emini here, at first it was kind of like, oh is this putting R nine on pause even longer because you were in production? No, maybe on video, but a couple videos I can sing. I Yes you can.

10 (21m 10s):
She said a couple videos.

17 (21m 12s):
Yeah. Basically she still can sing. So we should still get music. But

9 (21m 15s):
I

10 (21m 15s):
Did see an email about that though.

17 (21m 18s):
About Rihanna's music. And you sat here and didn't say anything to me.

10 (21m 21s):
I ain't saying nothing now.

9 (21m 23s):
Yeah.

17 (21m 24s):
I'm gonna move on because I just cannot,

9 (21m 25s):
Let's get into the outfits. Yes. I see you got all these pictures here. I do.

17 (21m 28s):
So and

9 (21m 28s):
You go ahead and you have the, my favorite one from last night. Not gonna lie.

17 (21m 31s):
Janelle

9 (21m 32s):
Monnet. Janelle Monnet. Yes. Eats it up down all the way. All, all the time. Like yeah. And that's not, you know, that's not crazy for her. 'cause she gay. So she definitely ate. Yes, she

10 (21m 40s):
Is not gay. She's a pansexual. Oh Emini here. She fries anything.

9 (21m 45s):
Oh, I know that's right.

10 (21m 46s):
Chef.

9 (21m 47s):
Is it two

17 (21m 48s):
Outfits? It's not, it's two different sides of the outfit. So you hit it from one way, it's one suit. You hit it from another way. It's a, it's a different side of the suit, but

9 (21m 54s):
This blazer first shows a

10 (21m 55s):
Pansexual suit. You can do it all type of way. Right?

9 (21m 58s):
Oh my God. Yeah.

17 (22m 0s):
Oh my God.

9 (22m 1s):
Yes. Representing sexuality is the way to go.

17 (22m 4s):
Yes. And I don't have the designers that these people are wearing. I apologize. So also Rihanna, ASAT Rocky hit the carpet. You Rihanna's baby bump there. Her corset was like molded around her baby bump. Nice Asat, rocky and all black just as accenting her.

9 (22m 18s):
Yes. And Asa Rocky, that's actually his own clothes. Like his own brains online.

17 (22m 23s):
Got you. Thank you for that Jess. Who else I wanted to

9 (22m 26s):
Show Nick Minaj ate it up as

17 (22m 28s):
Well. Yes. Nicki Minaj.

9 (22m 29s):
She looked good. She looked good. I wish we, we would've seen a lot more color this year, but they still executed. There was a

10 (22m 35s):
Lot of colors there. That was the theme of the stuff.

9 (22m 38s):
No, I'm talking about the color. Like Tracy Ellis Ross did. Oh, gotcha. Here,

17 (22m 41s):
Here's some color for you. Lauren Hill. Lauren Hill popped out in the yellow. Oh,

9 (22m 44s):
I didn't see her. She must have came when? What time she,

10 (22m 46s):
She was there on time.

9 (22m 48s):
Oh no, that's right. She look good in that yellow though. She looked good.

17 (22m 50s):
Yes. Lauren Hill popped out on the carpet as well. And an amazing yellow t Savannah James was there in Burgundy and hers, it was like a soup. She ate connected to like this, like a corset thing that connected to a skirt. And she was actually there by herself. There were reports that LeBron James was going to attend last night. But he had posted that unfortunately he couldn't make it because of his knee injury that he sustained at the end of the season. Oh. And he, LeBron James was one of the co-chairs or people were looking for him to be there. He said he hates to miss an historical event. His beautiful, powerful queen will be there holding the castle down as she has always done. And she do.

10 (23m 23s):
LeBron could have limp down that carpet.

9 (23m 25s):
Shut

10 (23m 26s):
Up. Because if they were still in the playoffs, would he have he, would he have been there? That would've been even worse if they was still in the playoffs and he would've showed up.

9 (23m 32s):
I don't think so.

17 (23m 33s):
Get to our girl

9 (23m 34s):
Doche,

17 (23m 34s):
Doce and Lv, who

9 (23m 36s):
She looked like a wallet. I love her look like a wallet. It's funny. Yes, yes. I love her now I see that she did good. Now I see the wallet.

17 (23m 41s):
Yo, she also had the lv, it was like a face something on like a tattoo or something like that. Yep. Yeah. And you know, Pharrell was one of the big co-chairs as well. So there was a lot of LV on the carpet. Andre 3003 stacks showed up and a lot of people were wondering about his outfit. He had on like a blue jumpsuit and a piano strapped to his back. Now there are, there is some context to his outfit. Actually, right before he stepped out onto the carpet, he revealed that he has some new music coming and on the cover of the Mu the music the project is called, it's a new project, a 16 minute EP called Seven Piano Sketches. The cover of the project is literally what we saw him in last night. He's in a blue suit with a piano strap with two straps across his chest. Love it. Did

0 (24m 19s):
He pull up in a U-Haul? It's, it's like, like how did he pull up? 'cause he

10 (24m 23s):
And the U-Haul is crazy.

0 (24m 24s):
How would he get

17 (24m 25s):
There? I just saw him on the carpet so I don't know. But I know he had a trash bag in his hand

10 (24m 29s):
And that project is actually out.

17 (24m 31s):
Yeah, it's out. But it, it dropped minutes before he hit the the carpet.

10 (24m 34s):
I will say this Andre 3000 is the only person who can make that look effortless. Andre 3000 is the only person that can show with a piano on his back and make it seem like make it look like he's not even trying. Yeah. Or make it look like he not curing a damn

0 (24m 45s):
Piano. I have so many questions when he got inside. Who helped to get it off? You know what Emini here I have so many questions.

10 (24m 49s):
I know also the theme was tailoring black style, right? Yes. How many people actually wore black designers and black brands?

17 (24m 56s):
I don't know all of the designers at all of the brands, but I know, I'm sure that there were some people there in it. And if

10 (25m 2s):
So, are black brands usually represented after Met Gala? I don't know.

17 (25m 5s):
It depends on the artist. And, and normally like a, a fashion house will invite you. So like for instance, Kai Sinat said he didn't go to the actual

0 (25m 11s):
KFC Chicken and waffles. Fresh juicy chicken and rich waffles with syrup. It's the kind of sweet and savory order that will make people stop whatever they're doing and stare in envy. So as you dig into your mouth, ordering original recipe chicken and warm waffles or dip them in your syrup, try not to eat near people crossing the street, driving cars, handling heavy objects or operating heavy machinery, you know, for their safety.

Kfc (25m 35s):
KFC Chicken and waffles is the order people are gonna envy. KFC Is finger licking good?

Met Gala because the designer who reached out to him to go with him and to be, you know, he didn't like the designer, he didn't wanna go. Gotcha. So it just depends. But there are a lot of people who intentionally, you know, work with black designers, black fashion houses, black creative directors. Laura Roach had a lot of people that he dressed last night. Okay. Black stylists p yeah, I had

9 (29m 5s):
To because I would

10 (29m 6s):
Hope that if they were tailoring black style, they would be using black designers,

9 (29m 9s):
Black brands. Absolutely.

17 (29m 11s):
A lot of it too is just the essence of like what we as black people have, like created the style and the vibe for that. A lot of these big fashion houses have taken but not have invited us to. So now we're here to basically reclaim like that was kind of the feeling as well too. Period.

9 (29m 23s):

10 (30m 11s):
All right man, let's go to commercial. I swear

10 (30m 16s):
That's so disrespect. Like he lived by himself. By himself. He got dressed by how check like everybody around him blind, like nobody around you just get

17 (30m 27s):
Lying about it. I was like, how does he know for a fact that like,

But how do you know it's what you want? Like this is how I wanna look tonight. Like how does he that

News is next. This is The Breakfast Club. Good morning.

10 (30m 44s):
You're checking out The Breakfast Club. Morning

0 (30m 47s):
Everybody. It's DJ NV, just hilarious Charlamagne guy. We are The Breakfast Club. Let's get in some front page news now. Last night, sports, the Nuggets beat the Thunder 1 21, 1 19. They lead the series one oh and the Knicks beat the Celtics 1 0 8, 1 0 5. The Knicks lead one. Oh, congratulations.

10 (31m 4s):
By the way, those are both considered upsets. Yes, absolutely. You know what I'm saying? Like, like the, the, the, the Thunder is what? The number one seed? No Thunder and Celtics number one. They both number

0 (31m 12s):
One. Well, no,

10 (31m 13s):
I think Cavaliers.

0 (31m 15s):
Yeah,

10 (31m 15s):
They're number two. Oh, subject number two. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Number two. Morning Morgan.

11 (31m 18s):
Hey y'all. Hey. All right, let's get back into the front page news. So the real ID deadline is tomorrow, on Wednesday. The Trump administration says all states, all states will need to comply by the May 7th deadline. Real ID is an enhanced security driver's license that will be needed to board any domestic that's stateside airline flight in lieu of a passport. So if you do have a passport, I believe that you will be okay at least to travel, but you will still need to get your real ID and become real ID compliant. Now some states are complaining of long lines at the D-M-V-M-V-A-M-V-D, whatever you call it. It's Department of Motor Vehicles. And then there are anticipated delays. There will be anticipated delays at airports, long lines at airports in the coming weeks and days as a result of this.

11 (32m 3s):
Speaking of airports, flight delays and cancellations continue at Liberty Newark International Airport, while United Airlines is recommending travelers consider another airport for their plans. Now New York Senator Chuck Schumer, he's calling on the US Inspector General to investigate continued chaos at Newark International. Schumer says the Federal Aviation Administration is a total mess with air traffic control staff shortages, wreaking havoc on travel. Now he wants the probe to figure out if Doge cuts impacted the agency's efficiency along with aging technology that is failing. Let's take a listen to Senator Chuck Schumer's comments.

23 (32m 39s):
Love to say that there is just minor turbulence at Newark Airport and the FAA. That would be the understatement of the year. We know that airlines have been canceling flights. We have a TC folks giving warnings. We have a 1990 technology being used in 2025, and we have safety issues. Plain and simple.

10 (33m 1s):
I, I was reading this article over the weekend that talked about how a air traffic controller was warning that Newark was unsafe for travel and you should avoid Newark at all costs. But I literally, when I was flying back from Chicago yesterday, I was saying that, I was saying how like, yo, these tech, these technologies on these planes are so dated. 'cause even when I was flying back into LaGuardia last night, they had a slight hold. 'cause they couldn't, they couldn't land yet 'cause something was going on at, at the airport. But you could just tell that the technology at these airports is just outdated, old and outdated. You could just tell. Mm. And then when I, and we landed LaGuardia, people was sleeping and you would think it was a holidays. Like it was just a random Monday night, 11 o'clock at night, people were sleeping, flights were delayed, people's flights got canceled. It was crazy.

10 (33m 41s):
And this was at LaGuardia.

11 (33m 43s):
Wow. And of course New York Senior Senator Schumer, he says he wants to ensure that the problem doesn't get any worse or spread. And of course this comes as Newark Airport has been experiencing ongoing delays since last week. I believe there was a 92nd blackout on April 28th. Yep. With radar and communications that supposedly, you know, left things really, really bad. And in fact, a lot of those air traffic controllers, I've walked off the job saying that they are dealing with trauma leave. And as a result of all of this chaos,

10 (34m 11s):
April 28th was last Monday, right? Yeah, yeah. I, that happened to us. We had to land, we was coming from Orlando and had the land in Richmond because the radars were out at Newark. That's

11 (34m 20s):
Crazy. So authorities essentially are saying, try another airport if you can. And you ain't gotta

10 (34m 26s):
Tell me twice. I

0 (34m 27s):
Usually take LaGuardia anyway. LaGuardia or JFKI. I'd rather take the extra little trip than to go to Newark. 'cause Newark is just,

9 (34m 33s):
And that's the craziest thing ever. 'cause I fly in and outta Newark almost every week and that's like the best airport to me. But God damn, I hate going to New York to fly.

10 (34m 44s):
Now listen, that new Newark terminal is dope. Now the, I think it's terminal A that terminal is, you said in Newark? Yeah, Newark. Yes. I, but Emini here, the band. But the fact that it's unsafe to travel, that's

9 (34m 55s):
Oh yeah. You ain't gotta tell me twice to not travel out there. But that I use the airport like all the time. Right?

11 (35m 1s):
Yeah. Something to keep in mind. Switching gears, New York Attorney General Leticia James is leading a coalition of 19 other attorneys general ensuing to block the Trump administration from dismantling the US Department of Health and Human Services. Now she says those affected by HHS cuts are nine 11 heroes and more. Let's take a listen to New York Attorney General Leticia James comments. And

24 (35m 24s):
Since taking office, this administration has fired scientists, closed labs, shuttered life saving programs without rhyme reason, or any legal authority will be denied care because this administration chose to fire their doctors. And at the same time, children in New York and across the country are at risk of losing access to Head Start.

11 (35m 48s):
She called the mass firings illegal, dangerous, and cruel. James also said that those at risk include children, working parents, seniors, foster families, and those who struggle with mental health and substance abuse in addition to first responders who will be impacted by that, the cuts and restructuring effect departments like the F-D-A-C-D-C and National Institutes of Health. So I will continue to keep you posted on that in terms of what happens in that coalition and their efforts. And closing things out, closing arguments are wrapping up in the murder trial of three former Memphis police officers who are being charged in the beating death of Tyree Nichols. Now the prosecution says the case boils down to the simple fact while the attorney for the accused officers made his closing arguments.

11 (36m 33s):
Let's take a listen to those closing arguments

25 (36m 36s):
That night. January 7th, 2023, those three officers did bad things.

26 (36m 44s):
Public officials put their lives on the line for us each day and they're trying to do right. So it's not a case where they're abusing the badge and trying to go out there and prove a point.

11 (36m 54s):
So over six days, attorneys called 17 witness, including a police trainer who admitted the force used on Nichols was excessive. None of the former officers testified in that trial. Prosecutors previously arrested their case after fault, calling five witnesses saying video evidence clearly shows what happened that night in 2023. And closing arguments will continue today and then we will be on Verdict watch. And I will keep you posted as to what happens in that case and that trial as well. That's your front page news.

Nah, he's actually a really tough fighter. He, he's gonna come and put the pressure and he is gonna come to fight. So it ain't gonna be a boring fight. It's gonna be an entertaining fight and I'm just ready to put on a show.

10 (38m 41s):
I wanna know why everybody afraid to fight you. I'm not. I don't know if it's afraid or what. Right, but I saw Rollie recently say that you are overrated because he said he feel like you got a weak resume to me. I don't know if you, I don't think your resume is your fault 'cause it's not like you aren't calling out these guys. It's not like you don't wanna fight the best.

27 (38m 56s):
Yeah, actually I'm the guy that really tried to fight everybody. My last fight. I tried to fight the kid, Austin Guy and he ended up sick and caught the flu and I tried to fight Frank Martin, he pulled out. So I can't really take what Rollie said. Serious. Rollie been knocked out before

28 (39m 13s):
And you and you can't like

27 (39m 15s):
He a clown. He a clown. So

28 (39m 17s):
Somebody like that can't call somebody. Like what do you, what's a weak resume? If you won titles in different divisions and he's a former unified champion

27 (39m 25s):
Besides, besides Tank, what's his resume? Yeah.

28 (39m 28s):
And he got knocked out truthfully

27 (39m 29s):
And yeah and he got knocked out. So,

0 (39m 31s):
So who did, who would you wanna fight? Who? Who would you love to fight that you feel like you just can't get it done? You wanna fight Tank?

27 (39m 36s):
I, I don't want to like keep saying that. I done said it. You wanna

9 (39m 39s):
Fight Tank.

27 (39m 40s):
But I think that's the biggest fight in the sport of boxing. Nice.

28 (39m 43s):
She a big tank. You

10 (39m 43s):
Know she from Baltimore man

9 (39m 46s):
You wanna saying to knock you out, yo fight taking us nice but why do you want Tank to knock you out so bad like

27 (39m 57s):
That Sound good? That sound real good But she too little. Too little. I promise you. You too little And you gonna be surprised that night. Matter of fact you probably throw Lamont was gonna get knocked out too. She did.

28 (40m 7s):
I

9 (40m 7s):
Did exactly. I did Emini here but not the grease. The grease with the braid and

27 (40m 12s):
Yeah,

9 (40m 13s):
Yeah, yeah.

10 (40m 15s):
Hell Did the fight with Ros change how you looked that tank in any

27 (40m 21s):
Way? I knew how the fight was gonna go. I bet money in one money that night. I knew exactly how that fight was gonna go. Mm. I had Lamont Roach cutting my training camp for sparring and when he pulled up for sparring, I kind of knew like what type of fight he was And I kind of image in my brain how the fight was gonna go with him and Hank And I swear it kind of went exactly like I said. Wow.

9 (40m 41s):
Who

28 (40m 41s):
Won the fight? I

27 (40m 42s):
Told Lamont one facts. We could sit here and front on the breeze.

9 (40m 46s):
No I'm not gonna front no the

27 (40m 49s):
Grease thing with the little knee. I thought Lamont won. Lamar

9 (40m 51s):
Definitely surprised me. So

28 (40m 53s):
Even, even though they didn't call the knee a knock down, you still felt Lamar won more

27 (40m 56s):
Rounds? Yes. I thought it was at least seven five Lamont.

9 (41m 0s):
How you think the new one gonna go? The one coming up with

27 (41m 4s):
Tank? I don hope he don't fight no more. Actually like I hope he don't get in the ring with him again because at the end of the day if he lose it's just gonna look bad on the fight with me. So gonna look like somebody else already did it.

28 (41m 15s):
Nah, he's s that fight stock is gonna go a little down but I heard Tank might be fighting Jake Paul that's still rules about that

9 (41m 22s):
Again, that's what hurt. What

0 (41m 23s):
Do you think about that fight if that happens, you think he takes it out of real fighting to ah, this is is common.

27 (41m 28s):
Well you know, it's a business so he probably just trying to go get a bag. So I ain't, you know, I don't knock nobody for trying to make a bag, but I think he do gotta fight me before he retire.

10 (41m 38s):
Yeah man, it is interesting right, because does Tank have a, a great resume when you look at it like that?

27 (41m 43s):
I think his resume is solid. I think it's just kind of downplayed just because he kind of weight drained a lot of people so Mm. He ain't really fight guys at his best. And when he kind of fought the people that was comfortable at the weight class, he kind of struggled like Pit Bull and Lamar Roach.

28 (41m 58s):
Yeah, Emini here and, and because he, you know, so accepted by the, our community, the, the, you know, the the hip hop culture, he became very popular and 'cause he hurt, he knocks people out. But when you think about it, I think that the, the stigma is the guys, the big names, the Shakur, the TMOs, the Devin, he hasn't fought those guys and that's in the back of everybody's mind.

10 (42m 20s):
Why don't those fights happen?

27 (42m 21s):
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a lot of politics though. I think it's a lot of people who know getting in the way of certain fights and it's also fighters too. Like Tank gotta be the person that says I wanna fight this guy. And when he says he wanna fight somebody, he's gonna make it happen. So it's on him.

10 (42m 35s):
He really just split with Maam and Eddie Harris.

27 (42m 38s):
Nah, I'm just like, you gotta realize what my situation is, whatever I want. So if I want Eddie to be involved, Eddie gonna be involved in, if I don't want him involved, he's not gonna be involved. But I actually like Eddie Hern, I've been telling people for the longest, I think he's one of the best promoters in the sport of boxing. So what

0 (42m 55s):
Do you think about the, the new Saudi chic that's really been taking over boxing and investing a lot of money in boxing?

27 (43m 0s):
I, I like it. I like it. It is kind of like a g and the curse. 'cause I feel like he wanna make the biggest and best fights happen, but also he gotta know like what fighters is the best fighters. Like he gotta understand the sport of boxing a little bit more too. So I like it, but still it's like I want him to like do a little bit more homework and understand like, who is the best fighters and you want, if you want the best versus the best, make the best versus the best. Not really though.

28 (43m 25s):
Can you talk about the, the little, I guess not disagreement, but miscommunication you had with him because you, you fought in Saudi against Pad Lee, you, you say you had the biggest bag of your life over there. Yeah. And you made easy work of, of Pad Lee Easy and you had a two fight deal with Matt. And then for the Payter fight you put out on social media, they promised me a certain amount of money and now they backtracking on that, but then put out a tweet saying we got it together, we figured it out. So e explain that whole situation. Emini

27 (43m 53s):
Here, I, I can't really tell all the details. All I'm gonna say is like in business you going go back and forth, you know, like God feel is he's worth this and somebody say, oh no, you worth this. So at the end of the day, I'm a guy, I stand on principle, I stand on integrity. We got it together. So shout out to Jay Prince. He came in and helped the

28 (44m 12s):
Situation outside. Shit because we, I spoke to Eddie Hern yesterday And I asked him the same thing and he was like, well the original deal was for Shakta fighting Saudi. And when you fight in Saudi there's a premium you get a little bit more. Yeah, yeah. That, that's what I heard. But since this fight is supposedly gonna be in Central Park, I don't know if it's true that's the rumors, that's why it was a little less. Is that something like that?

27 (44m 31s):
Yeah, it's something according to that was what I heard. But like I said, I don't try to speak to Yeah

28 (44m 36s):
I feel business because you know,

10 (44m 38s):
What do you think about, it was giving you a little backlash though because they said you apologized just to get a higher payday. Did he say that? Did it truck be like, all right man, you better apologize for that And I if not, I'm gonna keep,

27 (44m 48s):
At the end of the day it was kind of a miscommunication. Okay. Okay. And I kind of reacted quick instead of thinking about what I was doing. So with the miscommunication, I kind of, that's why I just had to, you know, be a man and do what I had to do type. And

10 (45m 0s):
You said something else that makes a lot of sense. Who is talking to the Turk about boxing? That's

27 (45m 5s):
What I be saying. I, I feel as though like, I ain't gonna say the people around him, but I do think that a lot of people need to do they homework enough to understand what's what and once they understand it, just like with this card, they got me the co main event under Edgar. You know Edgar, my homie, I ain't going to say nothing bad about 'em, but I'm the biggest star on the car. I'm the guy that's like, people wanna see I'm the, in the biggest fight. I got the best resume. Like, I ain't even gonna say resume. 'cause they could, they try to trash it. But I got, I got the, I'm the most accomplished too. So just to put me on like his under card. It really don't make no sense. I didn't

10 (45m 37s):
Even look at the card. I just assumed that that was the main event. That's what I'm saying. I ain't know who he was on Under Car. Yeah,

28 (45m 41s):
But I but I heard that it's kind of like what's happening in, in Times Square. They like all main events. All main events. Okay. Okay. You know what Emini here, like kind of Cold Main or Main? Main,

27 (45m 49s):
But like I, even if they was main event, take me off that car. What do you think it that car does? Like nobody really gonna pay attention to it. They paying attention to it 'cause it's me.

28 (45m 59s):
Yeah. Emini here. You the only multi division champion. So I I hear you. I hear your argument. But as far as Turkey, I'll touch on that too. He's a real fight fan. Okay. Right. He loves his sport and he, he's obviously poured so much money into it. He wants to get it right. He'll take, you know, Eddie Hearn knows the sport and other people so he's trying to make it better. But when you come into something new like that, you might make mistakes here and there. But I think he's put so much air into the sport, like so much life into it that you know, these fighters are happy. He

10 (46m 29s):
Is making the best fights to me over the last couple of years.

27 (46m 31s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He tried to make the best fights but it's still, you know, I like, I like the biggest and best fights I wanna fight Tank

0 (46m 38s):
All. We got more with Shakur Stevenson when we come back. Don't move. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. Morning everybody. It's DJ Envy Jess. Hilarious. Charlemagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club. We're still kicking it with Shakur Stevenson boxing. His next fight is July 12th against William Zita. Now I was gonna ask, you know what, what's your opinion on the way that these fights like a Times square fight in Central Paul fight and how does that affect the boxer? Because it could be too humid out there, so, so how do, do you like those type of fights where it's just off brand of where it usually is

27 (47m 7s):
Or I don't care where I fight at. We could fight anywhere truthfully, but nah, I think that the Central Park and the town, I think that's cool. Like I think, you know, people performed in Central Park before, so I'm all for it.

28 (47m 20s):
Have you ever had a conversation with Turkey or Uj Prince about Tank and like has he ever said that I'm gonna make Tank an offer to fight you? Nah,

27 (47m 27s):
He's definitely want the tank fight. Oh okay. He want the, the tank. Like I said, it's all up the tank so. Mm. He gotta just come on board and let's make a big ass bag. Let's do it.

10 (47m 36s):
You you, when you talk about fighting outside, do you think there's like an underappreciated mental side to boxing that fans and commentators don't understand or I talk about?

27 (47m 46s):
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I think like a lot of people don't know about boxing. Like, I remember it was a quote where Roger Mayweather said, most people don't know about boxing. That's a fact. But you know, it, it brings eyes to the sport. You know you got the YouTubers now in the sport of boxing, you got a lot of people that's paying attention to it. So I appreciate the viewers but I do think people need to do a little bit more homework. I

10 (48m 7s):
Think it's a sweet science Emini here. I think even with you, you know what Emini here, like if I've seen people, somebody called you the, who was it recently that called him the best defensive fighter ever? Was it Sean Porter? I don't

28 (48m 16s):
Remember. A lot of people have been saying that. I don Just

10 (48m 18s):
Say that. So it's just like, it's like a sweet science to what you do. Like it may not be knockout knockouts all the time, but you're a fantastic boxer.

27 (48m 26s):
Yeah and you know, some nights I may come out there and put on a amazing performance and put on an offensive display like I did with Jemele Herron. So it just depends on what happens that night or what I'm feeling that night. At the end of the day,

10 (48m 38s):
You think you can hurt Tank if you off fight? Yes.

27 (48m 40s):
Mm. Emini here I, you gotta realize Lamont had no disrespect to Lamont either. He had what? 10 knockouts. I got what? 11. So we ain't too far off. And he was kind of hurting him too. So if he could hurt him, I know I can hurt him

28 (48m 52s):
Too. What about you and Lamont was here last time we was all here And I asked him about you if, I guess if the tank fight doesn't happen. Perfect. We was talking about if he wins, he said yeah Shakur's on my list next.

27 (49m 4s):
Perfect. Perfect. I think that me and him been talking about this for years. So like I already like I my my boy, I'm real cool with him. But we could really squabble at the end of the day. So if it come down to it and Tank say he don't wanna fight him again, I'll go fight with my next Let's

28 (49m 18s):
Talk about your bro Keshaun Davis, right? Like obviously he on fire right now, he about to fight De Los Santos a common opponent that you fought. People were really trying to put y'all against each other. Not, not only in a fight but just like, oh I think he going to beat de Los Santos better than Shakur did. Do you worry about that at all?

27 (49m 36s):
Nah. 'cause at the end of the day I want him to like at the end of the day, you gotta realize when I met Keyshawn, Keyshawn was like 13 years old little bad kid from the gutter. And it's like I kind of like grabbed him up like he is my brother, we da da da. Right, right. May come better. And so it's like now to see him evolve and to see him become world champion, that's something good for me. Like if he go out there and crush De la Santos, that's good for me. That make me feel good about just myself too.

28 (50m 2s):
Are you taking him under the wing and all that Emini

27 (50m 4s):
Here? Yeah, it's like my, my brother. So at the end of the day I'm not,

28 (50m 6s):
Most fighters are throwing shots at that. They're like man ain't no friends or brothers in this business. I don't know why Shakur saying he'll never fight Keyshawn and vice versa.

27 (50m 14s):
But if you have somebody that you really close with, you gotta get in the ring and you gotta kill mentality. He gotta kill mentality. It is like what you talking about? I don't wanna hear that.

28 (50m 23s):
Yeah, no I feel

27 (50m 24s):
You. I'll fight. Tell any fighters that got something to say about it. Fight. I'll

28 (50m 27s):
Fight them. Fight them,

27 (50m 28s):
Fight me. How about that

10 (50m 30s):
H how, how difficult is it to not take boxing personal 'cause y'all are going in there and beating up on each other, you know what I'm saying? Like

27 (50m 35s):
Emini here it is very difficult. You gotta still understand it's a business and a sport at the end of the day. That's why I kind of used to go wrong. I used to always take it personal And I used to feel like, 'cause it's my life at the end of the day. So now I'm just at a point where it's like I understand it's a business. I understand it's a sport. Just how you say Tank going to fight Jake Paul. That makes sense. Like I get why you would go fight Jake Paul but just don't retire without fighting me is how I feel.

0 (51m 0s):
Ping what? That smoke so bad.

10 (51m 2s):
You know the tank Jake Paul thing is cool if it's a real fight. Emini here. I really mean that. I don't know how real these fights are.

28 (51m 9s):
Well Jake Pool fights are real. I'm gonna speak on his behalf 'cause I've you know, done business

27 (51m 13s):
With him. Seent fake fights before.

10 (51m 14s):
Yeah I'm not saying they fake but I think people might hold back a little bit. What you think you talking about like the Tyson fight?

27 (51m 19s):
Oh that's

28 (51m 20s):
A real fight.

10 (51m 21s):
I don't know if Tyson has Nah that's a real fight. If put it like this, if Tank don't knock out Jake Paul within 30 to 45 seconds. It ain't real to me. Whoa.

27 (51m 29s):
Whoa. Why do you feel that way? Nah,

28 (51m 31s):
Tank Jake is big bro. Jake is Big

27 (51m 34s):
Tank is little Jake Paul is like 200 plus on the regular.

10 (51m 38s):
I still personally believe Tank should knock him by. Remember when Flip Mayweather fought Logan Paul

27 (51m 43s):
You thought he should have knocked? No,

10 (51m 44s):
I didn't think he should knock Logan out but he, he made Logan look silly. So Tank with his power should be able to to clean up Jake

28 (51m 51s):
Paul. But Jake is way better than his brother Logan. That's the start over facts. I don't

10 (51m 55s):
Tank knock out Jake Paul Emini

28 (51m 57s):
Here can happen but I don't, I know the guy, I just don't know how that fight makes sense 'cause he's so much heavier than them. So I don't know how they going to make, but

10 (52m 5s):
We thought about that with the Mayweather Logan. But I, And I was telling everybody, y'all think Logan just gonna come in there and knock Mayweather out and no like Mayweather's the greatest defensive fighter of all time and he's a boxer. He gonna make him look

28 (52m 15s):
Power.

27 (52m 15s):
Like I get the power is real. I get all of that. But at the end of the day, that's a man that's like almost a hundred pounds bigger than him. So I don't see it. I don't see no

10 (52m 24s):
Knockout. So with that said, one of your mentors is also Bud Facts and he's going up a lot of weights to fight Canelo

27 (52m 32s):
But it ain't, it ain't a hundred pounds

28 (52m 34s):
But

10 (52m 34s):
Is it like 50? It's like 50, right? No, nah,

28 (52m 37s):
He, he going right now he had 1 54. So it's just two way class.

10 (52m 40s):
But he playing at 1 68. 1 68. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay,

28 (52m 43s):
Okay. Yeah I think you started that whole thing right here when you said would you fight him, you asked, you asked Canelo, you asked Canelo if Buck comes up to 1 68, would you fight him? And I was about to happen And

10 (52m 52s):
I, I only do it become to 1 68. Man.

27 (52m 54s):
I've been saying that for years though. I've been saying for years. I think Bud would beat Canelo. I think Bud just got the style that a outbox Canelo. I seen Canelo get out boxed several times. So I think Bud is the guy. What, what

10 (53m 6s):
Did you think thought Bud was gonna

0 (53m 8s):
Lose when he fought and everybody thought he was gonna lose and he came in pissed Charlamagne thought he was gonna lose, he came inside.

10 (53m 14s):
I've been saying that for you because I've always been an Earl spin fan but God damn

27 (53m 18s):
Actually I, I had bet a lot of money that night too. I made so much money that night. I've been in, I been, I was in Kent with Bud like I seen how he was trained. I seen how he was feeling and he just had a chip on his shoulder and watching him with that chip on his shoulder, it kind of like motivated me. It like, it was like a very motivational situation. So

9 (53m 37s):
You knew it. You're close with turns Crawford, right?

27 (53m 39s):
Yeah, that's my brother. Yeah,

9 (53m 39s):
That's what with him yesterday. He was like, you better treat my brother right when he come up there. Did you hear what Mace said though? Who?

27 (53m 46s):
Mace. Mace. What'd he say?

9 (53m 48s):
Macy had this to say. He said I don't wanna see Shakur fight. I'm gonna be honest, no disrespect to Newark, but I don't wanna see Shakur fight nobody. For him to be hanging out with Terrence Crawford and Andre Ward, there's absolutely no way that he's fighting the way he's fighting.

27 (54m 0s):
You know like, like, like I said with the other people like I can't really take some of these guys too serious. 'cause it's like they make a living off of trolling people. Trolling is what they do on a regular basis. So even before when I kind of reacted to them, I don't feel the same way now. Now it's like okay, I understand the business aspect of it so kudos to him, but I'm gonna keep making money. I'm going to keep being the best and none of these beat me facts.

10 (54m 25s):
You know? It's crazy though. They're not saying anything about you that they didn't say about somebody like a Floyd though. Facts. Facts. Because people do not, for whatever reason people don't respect defensive fighters. Even

28 (54m 34s):
Ro even war, she mentioned Ward, they said the same thing about Dre. Yeah,

27 (54m 38s):
Yeah, yeah. I think it's a stigma on black fighters who

28 (54m 41s):
Don't get beat up out, don't get hit out

27 (54m 43s):
Box people, but like a Chenko or Bal can go the best out box. The same people they, you don't never hear no boring things on them. So I just hear it but it, it is what it is. Does

10 (54m 54s):
That get into your head when you in the ring though, like 'cause you know you, you got your style. Does it make you feel like y'all wanna be a little bit more aggressive? I do want to try to get a knockout just to shut people up.

27 (55m 4s):
Yeah, it kind of did and that's where I be going wrong. 'cause I always realized my knockouts come from not trying like I don't expect it when I knock people out with that. Like in mind it's like you gotta tame yourself, you gotta calm down, relax and not look for the knockout. When you look for it, it kind of gets sloppy and it gets a little ugly. Me knowing that now I just go in there not looking for it and if it comes, it comes.

0 (55m 25s):
Alright. We got more with Sha Stevenson when we come back. Don't move. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning Tony. Everybody is the DJJ NV just hilarious. Charlamagne the guy. We are The Breakfast Club. AK is here as well. We're still kicking it with Shak Stevenson,

28 (55m 39s):
Ak, you know, you you, you are a big lightweight in my opinion, like 1 35. So you obviously big. I don't think you small, I've seen lightweight. I think you could be at one 40 and still be a fair size in that division. So obviously if the tank fight doesn't happen, there's so many fights at one 40. You know what

27 (55m 55s):
I'm saying? I, I like I said, I'll move up for the big fight for the big fights. Yeah. If it's like a little fight that don't make sense, like I'm really not a 40 pounder like on some really, no I'm not a 40 pounder. I'm a, I'm barely even a

28 (56m 6s):
35. You don't think you are in your career at least at 1 47 or something.

27 (56m 9s):
I used to think that but nah nah, I don think so. Emini here. I would go there for the right fights. Like I just watch Conor Ben, I like Conna Ben too. Yeah, no

28 (56m 16s):
Disrespect him too tough.

27 (56m 17s):
But I'll fight him at like 1 54 what I told you for the right

28 (56m 21s):
Fight. 1 54

27 (56m 22s):
I would, I swear I would fight him. Yo kind

28 (56m 24s):
Kind of tough man and he throws hard

27 (56m 26s):
Punches, like I said for the right fights I'll move

10 (56m 28s):
Up. Is it hard to get, get up to that kind of weight

27 (56m 31s):
Emini here you'll have to like, I guess train a little harder as far as weight wise and put on a little bit more weight. But I think skills pay the bills. Like I feel like with my skills I can fight a lot of guys at the highway class.

10 (56m 43s):
Would that slow you down defensively though?

27 (56m 45s):

27 (56m 56s):
Him for my last camp.

10 (56m 57s):
Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. Oh so then maybe that's what he got that from because he said, he said, I've never seen a fighter with the kind of defense that Shakur Stevenson has. And he says he feels that your, he feels like your defense is even greater than Mayweather.

27 (57m 9s):
Shout out to Sean Porter. Man, that's my guy.

27 (1h 1m 19s):
Yeah too. This Za Quent Moses and Maywell Chance Young Fighters coming up. They're new

10 (1h 1m 24s):
Boxes, right? They your boxes,

27 (1h 1m 25s):
You manage them. They my little cousin there, they there my little brother too. So young fighters coming up. They professional too. Yeah, they could fight,

10 (1h 1m 32s):
But, but how did you feel when Shawn said that about you?

27 (1h 1m 34s):
I appreciate it. 'cause Shawn actually been in there first hand. So he went to the ring and sparred me. So he seen what I can do and when he got out the ring he kind of knew like, okay, he's the guy. So I appreciate Shawn actually, I feel like if Sean wanted to come back right now, he could come back for the right fight. Wow. Yeah, he kind of surprised me. He did six rounds with me so I respect him.

10 (1h 1m 55s):
Did you study Mayweather?

27 (1h 1m 56s):
Yes. Okay. I study everything about Floyd from head to toe. Yes.

10 (1h 1m 60s):
When he heard that or or if he heard it, did he hit you up like, all right man, you don't, don't think you better than me. You know what

27 (1h 2m 7s):
Emini here man, you know Floyd so well. Nah, Floyd ain't hit me up and say nothing like that. Floyd is actually a, a cool dude for me personally. Like I hear the stories about him. I don't really take into it 'cause he kind of one-on-one with me. He cool. But

28 (1h 2m 20s):
He would say something like that though. Yeah,

27 (1h 2m 22s):
He, he definitely like the ultra competitor

10 (1h 2m 24s):
Like Come spa with me right now. Lemme show you. I still, still the

27 (1h 2m 26s):
Best. I would love Spa with Floyd. Never spa with him at all. I would love to but like the thing is like even when I watch, 'cause I know he probably a little hesitant about sparring the young fighters now because with Devin's situation they kind of put out there that they beat him up and all of that. I'm not that type of dude. Like if I spur Floyd, nobody would know how it went. It would be just me learning, learning lesson. Right. Like I wouldn't even go in there to try to like Floyd older now. So I wouldn't go in there to try to get off on Floyd. I'm going in there to learn like okay, let me watch his reaction. Let me see how his speed is at this age, what little tricks he got going in. Yeah, I probably take them tricks and use them in the ring for myself. So that's just the type of dude I am.

28 (1h 3m 2s):
Is there a fighter that, that you kind of fought and really got off on him but you actually personally like him and you like damn, I wish it didn't have to be him. I wish it didn't have to like beat him up like that. Jel

27 (1h 3m 12s):
Herring, Jamel Hering. Everybody thought I was beefed out with him because we was kind of going back and forth before the fight. But

28 (1h 3m 18s):
Man you killed him.

27 (1h 3m 20s):
Yeah. But at the end of the day I really like him like as an individual. He's like a super cool individual. He always like looking out for me before that. So I appreciate Jamal. You think he like you and you beat his ass like that? Nah, he actually does though. He

28 (1h 3m 33s):
Actually even after,

27 (1h 3m 34s):
Yeah, after. Yeah we cool.

10 (1h 3m 36s):
What's something you learned outside the ring that's helped you the most? Inside the ring?

27 (1h 3m 40s):
The smartest man will win. And that's in any situation when it come to business, anything the smartest man is always gonna win. And I think far as boxing, being able to outsmart my opponents is kind of what took me over the edge with everybody.

28 (1h 3m 54s):
Mm. Let's talk Ryan Garcia. A lot of people saying he's so com Emini here. I'll the controversy aside with the Devin thing, right? With the PED thing, he obviously we saw him beat Devin bad and he was at a weight where he was comfortable. Yeah. 1 42. So how does a tank and Ryan fight play out if it was at one 40 or weight that that Ryan was more comfortable

27 (1h 4m 15s):
And I think it'd be a very different fight. I think Tank is like, he's a good fighter, but like the Ryan Garcia that he fought that night wasn't the same. Ryan Garcia that Devin Haney fought. Mm. And Ryan was feeling good. And you actually seen when he fought Tank, he didn't have no respect for Tank. Like he wasn't scared of Tank at all. It just was the fact that he wasn't able to take the punches that was coming back at him. So I think it'll be a very different fight.

10 (1h 4m 39s):
So you, you, you beat, you beat William on July 12th. Let's Just say you beat William on July 12th. Tank beats Roach, but then Tank goes to fight Jake Paul Tank don't want a sha call Stevenson fight. What does Sha call Stevenson do for his legacy and his resume then?

27 (1h 4m 53s):
I just keep working, keep working, fight the next best available opponents and stay focused. At the end of the day, the movement doesn't revolve around him. So whatever he got going on, he got going on. If he says he don't wanna fight me, he retires without fighting me. That's cool. That's on his legacy. He gotta live with that. But truthfully for me, I fight the next available opponents. I fight Lamont Roach, maybe running back with a Edwin de Los Santos or something. So honestly I just, you know, just stay focused And I think my my time gonna

10 (1h 5m 22s):
Come. Would you be disappointed if you don't ever get that fight?

27 (1h 5m 24s):
I would just be disappointed in the fact that the way he was talking, like the way he, oh I'm going, he on my list. He on my list. And like the way he kind of put out threats in the way like, like somebody's supposed to be scared of that. It would be disappointing that we don't get to clash in the ring. But if he go do that,

28 (1h 5m 40s):
Who's the next best star? Like is it a, a Ryan or T fema? Like where it would be still a a, a big money fight.

27 (1h 5m 47s):
I would fight all of them guys. I've been saying I want to fight Teo for the longest though. Teo would be the perfect fight for me. But I think like boxing will forever evolve. So it is never gonna just stop with one person. One guy. Yeah. So it may be a young superstar coming up. I like the Emiliano Vargas. I see superstar potential with him. Right? Maybe one day in the sport me and him could lock in and get a big fight going. So I just gotta stay focused in and stay on my game.

10 (1h 6m 13s):
Yeah. I don't want to hear none of them fighters say Shakur is overrated. I don't want hear them fight or say Shakur can't knock nobody out if you're not gonna get in the ring with facts. That's how I feel. That's a great point. Don't, don't say none of that if you're not gonna get in the ring with, if you

0 (1h 6m 25s):
Can't beat him. Word facts. Well we appreciate you for joining us this morning, brother. Appreciate

10 (1h 7m 30s):
And she be having the latest on you. The latest with Lauren la Sometimes she have facts, sometimes she have details, sometimes she have a little bit of everything. Well it's the latest on The Breakfast Club. Talk,

0 (1h 7m 41s):
Talk to me

17 (1h 7m 43s):
All y'all. So yesterday I went to the first day of Diddy's trial. It was the first day of jury selection and man, was it a long day? We were there from like nine 30 to like 6, 6 30? Yeah.

10 (1h 7m 54s):
At night?

17 (1h 7m 55s):
Yes. Wow. Damn. They went through. It was because there's a lot of jurors. There's like, I think the pool was like anywhere from like a hundred fifty, a hundred seventy five. I believe it's 150 people big.

0 (1h 8m 3s):
So you got to see the jurors?

17 (1h 8m 5s):
Not all of them, but yes. Okay. 'cause they couldn't, we couldn't do all of them in one day. But yes. So when I first got there, first of all it was a horrible day to have to be outside of anywhere. But I was outside and there was like tons of media press set up. So we did our intro into the fact that I'll be covering it for the latest with Loren LoRosa. So you guys will see that on my YouTube channel. But there was a lot of media there, but not as much as I thought would be there. But I think it's because it's the first day, once I got into the courtroom, I was told that I was already too late to go in the actual courtroom where Puff was gonna be. So I went into an overflow room. So in the overflow room, all you could do was listen. So from nine 30 to like two, maybe one, like one 30, I was just sitting there listening to juror after juror after juror after juror y'all.

17 (1h 8m 49s):
I felt like I was in school. What did

10 (1h 8m 50s):
They do? Like, like interviewed them type

17 (1h 8m 51s):
Of stuff? Yes, they interviewed them. So they have this list that they put together. It's a people in places list and like, have

10 (1h 8m 57s):
You ever heard No Way Out? Is that your favorite album? That type of

17 (1h 8m 59s):
Stuff. Not those exact words, but similar to it. So they asked you, you know, they asked people about different celebrities. They know Michael B. Jordan was on the list. Kid Cudi was on the list. Kanye West was on the list. Some of Diddy's family, including his, his kids were on the list. Did any

10 (1h 9m 13s):
Of the jurors know any of them or

17 (1h 9m 14s):
No? Yeah, there were some jurors who knew different people. So like there was, were they old? It was old and young. So there was one woman, she was an older white woman. She thought Michael B. Jordan was Michael Jordan. But she knew that it was a celebrity. There was a another girl who picked

10 (1h 9m 27s):
Her. They was like, oh we taking, huh?

17 (1h 9m 30s):
Had to I'm trying. Yeah, I think they let her rock. 'cause you could tell that. Like she honestly just didn't know. Didn't know. Right. There was another girl, I didn't get to see her. This is when I was a overflow room. Who actually, she knew everything. Like she was like, she's a big fan of the nineties. She knew she named multiple people. Lori Gibson was on the list who was Diddy's choreographer and dance instructor for some years. She named her off the list. I know she started singing songs. You can hate me now. No, she did start singing songs, but she was the only person I heard that whole day identify Lorianne Gibson. So I'm like, oh, she really knows. But she says she used to watch making the band a lot. Yes. So yeah, they, they did that whole thing. They also, there was a bunch of different places, like different hotels and things of that nature that, you know, puff either would've been at or like people that are of a celebrity or like a certain status go to.

17 (1h 10m 13s):
They were trying to identify, you know, if you know these places, have you been there? Whatever was

10 (1h 10m 17s):
The majority Women, men, white,

17 (1h 10m 19s):
Black, it, it was mixed. It was, it was a very diverse pool. White black men, women, young, old. It was very, very diverse. There was one man that stood out to me. He actually was a juror who, because they give you these questions and they pull you in and they say, okay, this is the case you're gonna do, here's some preliminary questions. 'cause we were trying to make sure there's no conflict. Right. Right. So then when they come back, so when we seen them, this is them coming back after those questions. So a lot of the jurors had to update you and say, yo, since the last time I saw you, here's what's changed. One man got on the stand and basically said, my wife was one of the litigators. Remember that party that Puff had when there was a stampede and people passed away? Yes. His wife was one of the attorneys on that case. His wife found out from another woman or another person who was on the jury who went back and told her significant other that she had seen him just in the pool.

17 (1h 11m 6s):
And then he works with the wife and was like, oh, you know your, your husband's on the, the Diddy case. And she came, her husband was like, oh no, I hate him. I don't like him. So when he revealed that, they're like, no, like Mark check A off. Did did he seem was just like, no, I don't like him. It's too definite. Even though it's not the husband. There was an older black lady who they talked about or who was there. A lot of pe a lot of 'em, George. Y'all saw that Cassie video, like I'm not even gonna hold you. Of

10 (1h 11m 32s):
Course. How could, how could they, how could they not? It was on cnn. It literally was CNN exclusive

17 (1h 11m 38s):
Video. That was the reoccurring theme. People kept bringing that up. So one woman said that she didn't see the full video, but she saw a screenshot of the video and that it was very, can I say damn damning?

0 (1h 11m 48s):
Damning. Yes. Yes.

17 (1h 11m 49s):
You could say it. It was very damning. It was such a prude. No, because I don't know if we could sit on the radio, but that got her excluded. Meaning they're not gonna use her as a juror because they were like, wait for you to even, she was like, it was damning, it was judgment. Yeah, it was damning. But I can still make a, a clear and fair decision. Yeah. Diddy seem was like, nah, Uhuh. How did,

10 (1h 12m 5s):
Did he, how did did he look? How did did he look? Well, I don't, what I don't understand about that video is he's not on trial for this. Exactly. But

0 (1h 12m 12s):
Everybody's seen it, which makes him look

10 (1h 12m 13s):
Bad. Exactly.

0 (1h 12m 14s):
Like puts him in a bad

17 (1h 12m 14s):
Life. And I wanna bring this back in the next hour because I heard something in the courtroom about the video and how it will probably not be used by the prosecutors even though they are able to admit the original video. And I've been getting a lot of pushback for calling this out because people are like, that doesn't mean anything. Or they can still, and I'm like, no, no, no. But you said, how does, did he look, did he

10 (1h 12m 32s):
Look stressed out? Did

17 (1h 12m 33s):
He's definitely a lot thinner. Face is very pale. A lot of gray hair. Some black, but a lot of gray hair. You could tell he was nervous. And he said it in the courtroom. He had asked to go to the bathroom. He was like, excuse me, judge. You know, I'm a little bit nervous, but you could tell at one point in time I saw, And I was watching him very closely. I saw like his hands shaking a bit, but very involved. You, he's fighting for his life. Literally like Emini here. He came with a fi like a case of paperwork. He was on the tablet sitting next to Brian Steele. He's reading every drawer profile as things are happening. Like when that man revealed that his wife was a part of that litigation team. Yep. He's reacting with his attorneys. They're having conversations, but he's also, even though he's in all of that, still very like enduring, like he was making them laugh.

17 (1h 13m 14s):
They were having a good time.

0 (1h 13m 14s):
Well shaking the shaking of the hand, I don't think makes, makes him nervous. But remember when he was up at his hand was shaking like that as well. So it might be

10 (1h 13m 21s):
Me nervous. I don't know if he was nervous or he had so something wrong in this room. Happy in this room. Nervous.

17 (1h 13m 25s):
It was his lefthand. Especially when he wiped up that shot, that champagne

10 (1h 13m 27s):
That he showed. I'm sure he's happier. Oh,

17 (1h 13m 29s):
I remember that.

10 (1h 13m 30s):
Yeah. You know, did he had his own met Gala in jail last night. You didn know that. Oh my God. Yo. Y'all jets. Oh my God. She could find tailoring black style. They was altering their jail suits. Oh. Walking the red carpet. And the carpet is red because the stain with blood from IESs. Uhuh. Wait,

17 (1h 13m 50s):
Yo, you always

10 (1h 13m 51s):
Too fall. I

17 (1h 13m 52s):
Don know. Look, before we have to wrap this up and I'm gonna bring this back 'cause I have a little bit more. Mm. There was one juror who said she had to admit the fact that she saw something on her timeline that she liked. And it was a Diddy joke. And they were like, what was the joke? And she was like, it was something about baby oil. And I was like, she gonna say just hilarious in The Breakfast Club. I just knew she didn't though. Oh, okay. She didn't, she couldn't remember. But I swear to God, I was like, I know she's about to say it. Thank, but because of that they were like,

10 (1h 14m 15s):
There's been some great jokes from this situation. Has really, it really has been some amazing jokes that has she made about this. Okay. And they were never in. Last question before we move on was his family there was, was his sons? There's mom?

17 (1h 14m 29s):
No, no, no, no. Not his sons or his mom or his daughters. There were, there was two people in there that I think were there for him. But I don't know for sure. And I, I couldn't recognize them. But there was a guy with a free Diddy shirt on the first half when I wasn't in

10 (1h 14m 41s):
The program. He's definitely not gonna get picked as no drawer. Yeah,

17 (1h 14m 43s):
I was, he wasn't a juror. I, I believe he was just in the stands. I don't know. He just, somebody Yeah, they, another one of my reporter friends who was actually in the court with Diddy at the time, told me that he was in there and they made him turn the shirt around. So, okay.

10 (1h 14m 55s):
All well, happy birthday Meek Mill today. Meek Mill birthday. For real. Yeah.

17 (1h 15m 0s):

Why would you do that Stupid Emini here. That was the, that was the best way to insert it. Meek don't want nothing to do with any of this. That was the best place to insert it. You could wish Meek happy birthday. Anytime could next hour. You could do that. 20 minutes. You had to ask, how did he look you again because was he stressed out? Now we gotta keep an eye on Diddy because keep an eye on Diddy tonight. He's gonna give y'all something gonna surprise y'all with something. Goodness. All right. Who he give you a donkey to?

Christina Soto is 44 years old and she did something that people figuratively talk about doing. And I wish I could curse on the radio, but I can't.

29 (1h 17m 15s):
The police chief for Prospect Park says he has seen some road rage cases during his career. Somebody cuts someone off, then the drivers might get into a heated exchange, then they typically drive away. But in this case, on Tuesday there was a little more to that and the incident was captured on video by a bystander. That video shared thousands of times on Instagram shows. A woman identified Thursday as Christina Sto walking to another woman's car. The 44-year-old sits on the hood or not showing the most graphic part of the video, including when she appeared to defecate on the car.

29 (1h 17m 57s):
Omeo was brought to the Prospect Park police department Thursday in handcuffs offering no remarks. She faces a number of charges including in decent exposure and depositing waste on a highway.

10 (1h 18m 11s):
Imagine how mad you gotta be to weaponize your own digestive system. Okay? This is biological warfare. Alright? I respect people who can back the brown Cadillac outta the garage in public. Okay? I'm not one of those people now. I am. I am very regular. Okay? 8:30 AM every morning I'm making a tombstone in the water grave here at work. But if somebody comes in the bathroom or sits in the stall next to me, I can't do it. Okay? I'm a cowboy fan, but I can't take the browns to the Super Bowl if someone else is in the bathroom with me. So the fact this woman was able to bake some butt brownies in public on cue, it's impressive. But I'm gonna tell you something, Christina, the reason you getting the biggest he haw is because according to the police affidavit, you said, And I quote, I wanted to punch her in the face, but I pooped on her car instead and went home.

10 (1h 18m 53s):
I would've rather you punched her in the face. Okay? It takes way more energy to pull your pants down and birth a creamy behemoth in public than it does to punch someone in the face. Now, Christina allegedly told cops that it was a clean poop. I didn't have to wipe true quote for the record. There is no such thing as a clean wipe. Okay? Or a clean poop. When you release the mud monkeys, the anal area becomes soil with stool and you gotta clean it. Okay? Fecal matter contains bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause infections or spread, if not properly cleaned away. And having residual donkey around theri of your bunkie can cause discomfort. Okay? Itching and irritation whenever the inside of your bunkie itching guarantees you didn't wipe properly.

10 (1h 19m 36s):
So there is no clean kills when you push out a sewer snake. Okay? When you launch fudge torpedoes, there is always a casualty. That's all I got. Please let Remy ma give Christina. So Soto the biggest Heehaw,

I Found out that was related to the guy that I was dating. I don't feel emotions correctly. I am talking to a felon right now And I cannot decide if I like him or Not. Those were some callers from my call in Podcast Therapy Gecko. It's a show where I take real phone calls from anonymous strangers all over The World as a fake gecko therapist and try to dig into their brains and learn a little bit about their lives. I know that's a weird concept, but I promise it's pretty interesting if you give it a shot. Matter of fact, here's a few more examples of the kinds of calls we get on this show. I live with my boyfriend And I found his, his char in our apartment. I collect my roommate's toenails and fingernails. I have very overbearing parents. Even at the age of 29, they won't let me move out of their house. So if you want an excuse to get out of your own head and see what's going on in someone else's head, search for therapy.

Just come on man. Let me see what I can do for you. Or something like that. So they just let me in. If you're just like nice And I don't know, a little silly, I think, I think me being silly and flirty just always up letting me get in.

10 (1h 37m 46s):
Okay. Alright. I never, I never had to sneak into no party because the way my anxiety set up, when you tell me no, I leave. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You'd be like, nah, you can't get in. I'd be like, all right. I'm out. Like I ain't, I ain't never been that deep. Yeah,

0 (1h 37m 60s):
Nah. Growing up in New York, they didn't care who you was with. If you wasn't with that person. It is. Nah, well tell 'em, tell 'em to come outside and come get you like

9 (1h 38m 6s):
Oh, like they had to visually see you with this person. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah.

0 (1h 38m 9s):
Damn. New York was disrespectful. They used to be like, yo, you gotta tuck in your shirt. You got, you tuck it in your t-shirt and your pants like it was disrespectful but if you didn't notice somebody, you wasn't getting in. You wasn't

9 (1h 38m 18s):
Damn. That's wild. Emini here, you don't like to go out anyway.

10 (1h 38m 20s):
That's what I'm saying. Like I'm never, I'm not that type of person. I never really been a club person. So it's never been that serious for me to lie about getting in a party. So

0 (1h 38m 28s):
What's some more other story?

10 (1h 38m 29s):
The moral of story is we gotta check Los Bunkie. He may not be a, he may not be a virgin after the night he had last night. No Mokey is sealed. Okay. By the blood of Jesus. No, his blood. All right. Blood. Oh my God. I don Jesus. No more of

9 (1h 38m 44s):

0 (1h 39m 16s):
She gets them from somebody that knows somebody.

10 (1h 39m 18s):
She gets the details.

17 (1h 39m 19s):
I'm the home girl that knows a little bit about everything and

10 (1h 39m 22s):
She be having the latest on this. The Lord the latest with Lauren la. Sometimes she have facts, sometimes you have details. Sometimes she have a little bit of everything. What was the latest on The Breakfast Club? Talk to me.

17 (1h 39m 35s):
Y'all tired of talking about the Diddy Try yet? Yes.

10 (1h 39m 38s):
No, I got

9 (1h 39m 39s):
No I got

17 (1h 39m 40s):
Little bit more. Wait just a little bit.

9 (1h 39m 43s):
Okay. Make it juicy. Thank you.

17 (1h 39m 44s):
Okay, so I went back through my handy dandy notebook 'cause you know I can only take notes in there. And one of the things I wanted to touch on that I saw was, was making some headlines 'cause I had a like some exclusive details on this was they're having a conversation right now because in court prosecutors let the judge know that they don't know what they're gonna do as far as victim number three. So it's victim one who we now know is Cassie two and three. And these are all supposed to be alleged former girlfriends of Diddy's victim three at this point is telling the prosecutor she doesn't care. They revealed that it is a woman and they said that she doesn't care if she's subpoenaed or not. She says she's not testifying

10 (1h 40m 18s):
Question if if really if the, if the money was already paid to Cassie, how is she able to take the money and still testify? That's

9 (1h 40m 24s):
What I asked last week.

17 (1h 40m 26s):
Yep. She has asked me that a couple times. Well

0 (1h 40m 27s):
The federal agency doesn't care that you, you whatever deal you did civilly, if they call you to testify you gotta testify.

9 (1h 40m 32s):
Yeah. Lawrence said she was like legally made to do it. Like she has to do it right. Yeah.

0 (1h 40m 36s):
They don't care about your money. What you got, what you did.

17 (1h 40m 37s):
So that goes right into the, the detail that I received. So yesterday when this conversation came out about victim three, what I'm told is that none of the victims wanna testify from a source who is very familiar with the case. Really. I'm told specifically Cassie does not want to testify. But

10 (1h 40m 54s):
You know why? Because it's gonna be so much like when the pro, when the defense gets on her and the stuff that they gonna be asking her and the stuff that they gonna be saying to her and you know the stuff that you know, they probably know that she might have been involved in their personal sex

0 (1h 41m 6s):
Life. You what? Emini here and she's not gonna wanna talk about that personal sex life, whatever it was. That's, that's their own personal business, bedroom business.

17 (1h 41m 12s):
I'm assuming those are some of the reasons. I will say though, yesterday and when the jury selection was happening, whenever something was like, And I don't know if they would do this with the people who are testifying because you need certain things on the record, if anything was too personal 'cause they were asking all of the jurors, have you ever been a, you know, a survivor of sexual assault or experienced anything that would change how you would judge on this case? There was one girl who had a very, very serious sensitive situation and she said, I don't wanna speak on record. They turned on this like noise filter thing where you couldn't hear the conversation and all of the attorneys, the prosecutor and the defense took her to the corner with the judge and talked to her there and then based on whatever she said and we didn't know they decided to exclude her. So I don't know how sensitive and how they're gonna go about this for the actual witnesses or, but that's

10 (1h 41m 52s):
Not even fair to that women

17 (1h 41m 53s):
That has victims, alleged

10 (1h 41m 54s):
Victims. She revisited that whole story for what,

0 (1h 41m 57s):
Even just

10 (1h 41m 57s):
Telling an excuse, even just saying it to them in that, you know, little personal setting that's, that's traumatizing. Well

0 (1h 42m 2s):
They have to ask everybody. 'cause so many people lie to get off these cases so they have to ask. But even with Cassie, Cassie got kids right? Yeah. So this is testimony that's gonna be her. She might not want to her sex life and her sex, her personal life is her personal life. Yeah. The fact that she has to say this in court will be recorded, will be talked about for years and her kids will probably see this one day and she probably doesn't want that. Well I will

17 (1h 42m 20s):
Say the judge,

0 (1h 42m 20s):
Which is foul, like you said, she shouldn't have to if she doesn't want to. Yeah. When it comes to certain things, the

17 (1h 42m 24s):
Judge is, is a very, I've never, in all the cases that I've like monitored and reported on, I've never seen a judge as human as this judge is. This judge is like, he did allow people when they were talking about sexual assault, even if it was like to a family member, he would ask like, you know, if you're okay with sharing, like he would say things like that. Right. Never seen that before. So I think that the judge will take, he understands how temperamental the case is. But when it comes to Cassie as well, there's two things. So you talked about like her name and stuff like that. There are, And I don't know exactly who, because again we only know Cassie as victim one because of certain documents and reports. But yesterday the way that they talked about these women, you know, victim one, two and three, they talked about them being able to get on the stand and testify under pseudonyms.

17 (1h 43m 8s):
So like not their actual name. Because even though you might be in court and you'll see them, I think it's because for the, on the record, like just, just for what you're

0 (1h 43m 16s):
Speaking to, people will see them and say their names immediately. So that sounds stupid as hell. A

17 (1h 43m 19s):
Hundred percent. But they asked, that was a part of what they were asking a jury yesterday. Like are you okay with people being able to testify in a case like this, which involves sexual assault or whatever under a pseudonym versus putting their actual name behind it. But the the Cassie who

10 (1h 43m 30s):
Gets to pick the names,

17 (1h 43m 32s):
I think it's just like victim one, victim two or like stuff

10 (1h 43m 35s):
Like that. Oh okay. The pseudonym is usually a fiction, fiction fiction name. Yeah.

17 (1h 43m 39s):
I don't think it's gonna be like Mary and her name is like Sabrina. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's gonna be like something that the court like, you know how they use them terms in the fictious or

10 (1h 43m 47s):
Fictitious fic? What? I said you said Fictious get 'em. Oh okay. Yeah, same thing because that's kind kind of, you know, it's not because you don't want to be a male victim and they name your name like oh just call him Dick Van Dyke or something crazy. Oh my God. It always goes if

17 (1h 44m 2s):
You and that fan and Mark, not Mark Gros. Mark Agne. That's Diddy's lawyer said on the record because they started talking about the video. 'cause so many of the jurors were that the Cassie video was excluded. And I was like what? Since when because they had said that they could use it as long as it was the original. Right. So then Diddy's attorney came on and was like, first of all, but she didn't say this but it was a summary. She basically was like, first of all it's not excluded but right now we're just choosing not to use it. And I was like,

10 (1h 44m 33s):
Wait, it really doesn't what don't make sense. So they're gonna use it later.

17 (1h 44m 37s):
Emini here they can choose, choose to use it whenever they want to. But it made me start thinking about like what their I, I like what their angle is gonna be into this And I feel like they're gonna probably stay away from that because his charges are not like, like what you see in that video. They don't want, they wanna have a strong case, they don't want nothing that he can like you know what Emini here, but that caught me. I was like hold on, wait, did she Just say that they're not going to as much as they fought for that video but maybe it's just to have the option. Mm. So what are y'all predictions?

10 (1h 45m 1s):
Predictions On what? On the case

17 (1h 45m 3s):
We

10 (1h 45m 4s):
Haven't heard none of the evidence. Yeah man we evert heard no evidence yet. You wanna be draft picked so bad. What are your predictions? Hey,

17 (1h 45m 13s):
You wanna be dicked down so bad

10 (1h 45m 16s):
You can't say that.

17 (1h 45m 17s):
Oh shoot,

10 (1h 45m 18s):
Jesus, that's, that

17 (1h 45m 20s):
Was a real life moment how I talked to him off camera. That was crazy. Yeah, at risk. Insane.

10 (1h 45m 26s):
So how was you going? So you went to court yesterday and Yes. You went to court like it was the club. Did anybody look at you crazy?

17 (1h 45m 32s):
Well first of all, every, all of the court staff was like, oh my god you're best dressed. I was like, there's more to come. I'll be back. There's

10 (1h 45m 39s):
More to come. I'll be back.

17 (1h 45m 41s):
Yes because I'm going back. I won't be there today. Court picks back up today actually in like 30 minutes and the rest of the week. But I'll be back on Friday and there's eight weeks of actual trial. So I'll be there as much as I can be. I was tired. I'm like going, did

10 (1h 45m 53s):
Puff speak? Did he speak to you Puff? I

17 (1h 45m 55s):
Don't know him to speak

10 (1h 45m 55s):
To me. He kept peeking that hurdle. He was like, who is that? Who is that? Because she wasn't dressed like all of the other media people. Possibly another accuser. Remember that's what he thought. Like, oh no, shout out the

17 (1h 46m 5s):
Romeo Hunt for the fit.

10 (1h 46m 8s):

17 (1h 46m 8s):

17 (1h 46m 20s):

9 (1h 49m 28s):
Period.

10 (1h 49m 29s):
And listen, I wanna salute everybody that I saw at the university at Chicago yesterday. I was at the University of Chicago talking to the kids, you know, they, they, they do this thing called office hours where you know, different students get to come in there and have conversations with you. And then me and David Axelrod, we had a larger conversation in front of this, the whole student body. And that was a very, very interesting conversation. 'cause you know, all those kids, they major in like political science and they're really into politics and a lot of different things like that. So sleuth to everybody I saw at the University of Chicago yesterday, and that's where my positive notice coming from because one thing we were having a conversation about was when somebody asked you how you doing? Like don't ask nobody. How you doing if you're not really Yeah.

10 (1h 50m 10s):
Expecting a real answer. You know what, Emini here. So the most powerful way to heal somebody is to listen. Don't think a judge, just listen. People start to heal the moment they feel heard. You can't be a healer if you refuse to step outside of your own emotions and view things entirely from the perspective of the other person. So remember that next time somebody ask you, you know, next time you ask somebody how they doing, you better be prepared to listen. Have a great day

9 (1h 50m 35s):
All this time I'm gonna do it. All right, go ahead. Rehearse. Ask me how I'm doing.

10 (1h 50m 38s):
How you doing, Jessica? Do you

9 (1h 50m 39s):
Really care?

10 (1h 50m 40s):
I do. That's why I asked you.

9 (1h 50m 41s):
Yeah. All right. So whenever you think, whenever you think somebody don't care, ask them this. How you know if somebody really paying attention, if you be like, how you doing? And somebody Just say, how you doing back? They don't really care. So you gotta start asking. Like if I say Emmy, how you doing? Be like, yo, do you really care? I'd be like, no, not for real. You know? And then we can just go about all that

10 (1h 50m 56s):
And that and that. And remember no is a complete sentence. So if that person tell you no, not really. Yeah,

9 (1h 50m 60s):
Yeah. I'm just saying it 'cause that's what's natural to say. Yes. You know, how you doing? That's it. Breakfast
