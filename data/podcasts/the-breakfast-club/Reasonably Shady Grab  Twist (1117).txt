Welcome to Reasonably Shady, a production of the Black Effect Podcast Network. And iHeartRadio Welcome To another episode of Reasonably Shady. I am gizellebryant. What's up? What's up? This is robyndixon. Thank you for being here with us once again. It's robyndixon in the house. Yeah. What kind? Is this a body suit? No, it's, it's like a shirt. Okay. It's like a shirt. Yeah. It you like, it's cute because I saw like the little ribs. Oh, the little rib. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a shirt that You know tucks in. I'll, I'll send you the link. Yes, please. Send.


Is it, is it sheen? No, thank God. No. I told you I'd sent all that shit back. Yes. Good. Did you get your money back? Oh, that's a good question. Yeah. I. don know, because they probably have a non non send back to us in there. Fine line. Well, they do. So I know I got the confirmation that they got my return and they did say that there was one item that I sent back that was non-returnable. Okay. Or final sale. But they were like, but in this instance, we'll, we will waive it. Yeah. We'll take it You know the, in hopes of you being a customer and blah, blah, blah. Like, like did me a solid, but I'm like, thanks. But yeah, no, Robinson, thanks, but no thanks. And then, and yeah, and then I, I knew that I had two items that were final sale, so I still have them, but yeah, they're like straight polyester.


So I would, I would like to donate them to somebody. Give it to when Corey has a girlfriend. Give it to her. Right. There we go. Boom. Anyway, do you have a shady moment? Nothing Like super shady. I do wanna say this. This is so funny. My, so we, we recently got into juicing. Oh yes. In my house. Yes. Let's discuss. Yes. We bought a juicer. Yep. It's, you should have told me. I would've given you mine, but go ahead. Oh really? 'cause you don't use it. I haven't used it. I was all into juicing it then I, I fell off. But go ahead. Okay. So this one is, all right. So, so it's crazy. All right. So I already have a juicer that I purchased a long time ago.


It might've even been a wedding gift. don don't know. It was one of those, it was like a, it was don don't know. It was popular. It was expensive. And. I never used it. Okay. Because everyone says, oh, it's, they're just so hard to clean and blah, blah, blah. Right. They are. So I never used it. So it's just been like sitting in my pantry forever. So then of course, Instagram a couple things recently, like Juan is like all into his health and he gets influenced on Instagram when he sees something. When people are like, oh, don't eat this, don't eat that, don't do this, don't do that. So, right. So he saw this juicer, he was like, okay, let's buy this juicer. And, I was like a little hesitant because I'm like, we already have one, we never use it. Right. Blah, blah, blah.


So it came, it's by a company called Ings, K-U-V-I-N-G-S. If anyone is interested, it was like $699. What? Yes. But it's amazing. Like, so it better be, I know 6 99. Well, and then, then let me rewind. I bought one before on Amazon was smaller. Yeah. It was probably like 80 something bucks. Okay. Right. It's you like when you pay a lot, when you pay good money for something. Yeah. Like, like there's a reason why. Okay. Well yeah, of course. So however, go ahead. I know. So I mean, so the, the machine is amazing and beautiful and it works really well and the cleanup is really easy.


Okay. But like, I might put in like six apples. 10 carrots. Yes. Like a whole bunch of shit. And you literally get like two ounces of juice and you get nothing. You get nothing. It's so crazy. Peas, pears give you good juice. Oh, they do? They do. Okay. That's good to know. Yeah. So we'll add that. But I'm like, this is insane. The amount of fruit that you actually, or fruit or vegetables or whatever that you have to put in this machine Yeah. To get a decent amount of juice out. And then where are you getting your fiber now? And then that too. So, I mean, you would, so, so my mindset, it's not that juicing is replacing food. Okay.


It's more so we don't wanna purchase and And I drink water in the house. So I, I really only drink water for the most part. So this is more so for, for my kids and for Juan. So, so that they're not drinking. Like store-bought fruit juice. Yes. Yeah. Because no wonder when you look on the label and it says 10%, it's really you. Okay. You buy Strawberry lemonade or whatever. Yeah. And it's really only like 10% real fruit juice. And the rest is all like added flavor of Yeah. Artificial stuff of, well, no wonder because you can't get a whole bunch of real fruit, no juice out of, out of, and and you see what goes into the cost of it. Right.


Right. So Yeah. No, you can't. Yeah. So it's crazy. So, so, so I, I like the juicer not to replace food. And so I get my fiber You know Where's the shady moment here? The shade of the shady moment is like how much food, how much little juice? No. Shady moment is your $8,000 juicer? No. 699. Yes. That six $99 seven for a juicer. It's amazing. I don't give a damn it real. It is really, I don't get quiet. You just like throw everything in the top. No, and it just no. Does its thing. And are we gonna talk about wine rock rocking around the house screaming? Yeah. So, so that, so Juan is like, I'm not eating food anymore.


No, that's not how he said it. What he said, he said, I'm not eating food anymore. So I was like, oh my God, Juan, are you okay? Are your pants getting too big? Like, are you gaining weight? Like, what's going on? Because you're now angry. Right. And so he was like, I'm just not doing it. So then he said he, he, he's been doing research, he's doing research hour, hour and a half doing food research. And he's like, all the food, eating food. I ain't eating shit. Right. But this is gonna be good. No, this is good for you. But he used the juicer yesterday and put like spinach and like, it, it's still, you get nothing. Nothing. So I'm like, I don't know what you're going to do then if you're not eating food, wine gonna be walking around hungry. Right. Okay. That's what wine gonna be doing. It's gonna be skinny. But no, these damn ju like the juicing situation.


It's nice. It's lovely. Now You know why it's so expensive when you go to those juice bars that do like Yeah, like puree Pure puree. Yeah. Pure raw. don don't know all of 'em. Whatever. Like, I, I go to one in Fulton Maple Lawn called Sunset Raw. And we actually filmed there. Yeah. But now You know why, why I got mad at them, but go ahead. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. Sorry. That's okay. No, they're great though. Go there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. They just won't make your stuff like I ordered and then I left. Oh. To go go. They have a, there's a bakery next door. Yeah. To go to the bakery and they wouldn't make it until I was there. Oh. So I was physically in the building. Oh, that's interesting. That was weird. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. I wonder why it has to be a reason. Yeah. But Hateration, they need you though. Yeah. But now You know why this stuff costs so much.


Yes, totally. Because you, you need so much, so many fruits and vegetables just to make a significant amount of juice. Yeah. And as soon as I make it like the kid, I mean, it's crushed between the three of them. Yeah. It's good though. Like cr juicing apples. I, I like to juice pink ladies with carrots. Yes. It's really good. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Then we'll juice like oranges with pineapple. Oranges. Yes. That's great. Really good. Throw some pears in. Yeah. I, okay, so I'll do the pears. But yeah, if anyone has any recipes and stuff to send or, or any more tips on like, how to get more juice out of my juicing. 'cause we are going to use my, you better. $699 juice from now until the end of time.


And. I. Hope and pray that shit don't break. 'cause You know if it breaks to get the part's warranty. It's a warranty. Okay, Robin. It's good. All right. Lemme tell you about my shady moment. So my friend Ashley Darby, your friend too, invited me to a Capitals game. Okay. It was their season opener. Yeah. So this is not too long ago. I wasn't really prepared. Like I, I, I think the last time I had gone to a capitalist game was like maybe 20, 25 years ago. Yeah. I've never been to a hockey game. Never. Actually, only time. I've only experienced when Juan played with the Toronto Raptors and it was like, we were just in the building and the the hockey team was playing. Yeah. But we were, it was just like passing through. Yeah. So I've never experienced, so it was the thing, please enlighten.


Like, like sold out. Yeah. So you're You know. And you, and this is good for you because you walk into the capital center Yeah. And you're good. But once you walk into like, where they play, it's freezing. Right. Had no clue. Oh. And mind you, everybody's walking around with a sweatshirt on, a hoodie on. And I'm like, oh, I was look cute. My little, you look why my little shirt, my little tank top. I was looking very cute. So actually looks at me. She was like, oh, I think you're gonna be cold. You need to buy something. I said, for what? Right. Mind you, she had a hoodie, like tied around her neck. Okay. And long sleeve. Okay. And I still didn't get it. She was prepared. She was highly prepared. 'cause her, the guy she was married to had season tickets. Okay. Okay. So I went to the little gift shop, bought my little hoodie.


This is not my shady moment. Okay. So, so I get in there and everybody's like going wild. They're going nuts. They're like screaming at the players. The players are fighting. Yeah. It's a borderline line. Like a housewife reunion going on. Yeah. It's like grabbing helmets, throwing her on the floor. Right. The, the drama of it all. Because you can't really hurt wwe. Yeah. Yes. You can't really hurt yourself. You have, you're padded up all those pads, right? Yes. But it's the drama of it. Right. And, and the crowd's getting into it. So then behind us was a C I. don know if they were C two guys and they were big bur men, and they were like, grab the dick and Twist grab the Dick Twist And I.


Yes. The Dick and Twist. And I was like, so other people started saying it. I think that's like a saying. Grab the dick and Twist. I never heard of that. Grab the dick and Twist it. Oh my God. This is an MMA fight. Dude. Twist that Dick Twist Twist. Oh my God. Dick Twist. Yes. I've never heard that. That's hilarious. But that is hilarious. Like Twisted. Twisted. That's so funny. Mind you, you can't grab a hockey player's dick. Oh my gosh. You can't even Yeah. Because they have all the equipment.


Have all that equipment on. Listen, it was the same I, don, that's same in my section. Grabbed the Dick and Twist. That was their same. And so they weren't. Yeah, this is actually, it's not really a shady moment. It was, it was. I guess it could have been shady, but it was hilarious. And I. Absolutely love those guys. And then like, towards the end, they were like, yeah, that's funny. They were, they're playing Jersey. And so The Cap, our team, who's our team? Washington Capital? No. What's their, the rappers? Washington Capitalists? No. What is their, what's their Oh yeah, that's right. Their capitals. They're capitals. I'm so crazy. They're capital. They were playing Jersey. And so then they were like, nothing good comes outta Jersey. Nothing good.


And so here go Ashley oha do that. Juda And. I was like, Ashley, shut up. Uhuh. So then the guys were like, these are like You know, you can kind of suss out whether or not a guy watches Bravo. Yeah. I, in my mind, I'm like, these guys do not watch Bravo. Exactly. Then they started screaming. We all like Potomac. I was like, ah, You know us. And then And I think one of them said something about Reasonably Shady. So I was like, that's so funny. Yes. So then I was like, grab the dick and Twist. Oh my gosh. Grab the dick and Twist. Oh, it was amazing. Twist. It was amazing. Great times. Grab the dick and Cool Twist. That is awesome. Yes, you go. That is one thing. I've never been to a hockey game, but I, I'm always impressed how they're able to just like full on fist fight.


Like, oh yeah. But they, they know it's kind reunion. They know you. The fans need it. High entertainment, I guess it's like entertainment. It's like, yeah. Yeah. It makes me think like WW line, well, boring, but then, right. But You know there is skill here. Yeah. Because the goal is much smaller than like a lacrosse goal or, but just from my view. Oh yeah. You know. Don't, don't, don't quote me here. People. Yeah. But like, it's, it's short and it's, it's narrower. It's like shorter or smaller. Like way smaller than the soccer goal. And the goalie has on padding has on looks like a robot. All the other, not a robot. What are those people call? Yeah. Matrix. Not the Matrix, but like the Power Rangers Looks like a Power Ranger.


No. Yeah. Power Rangers don't have all that. Oh, X-Men equipment Transformer looks like a transform. Transformer. Transformer. There we go. And so this, we, you transformer And. I was telling, actually, I was like, there's no way a puck could get in because like they've got the thing covered with all their transformer equipment on. Oh right. And she's like, you'll be surprised. And they got it in every time. I was like, oh, this is amazing. Yeah. Yes. And then the goalies are like doing their splits and stuff. So like, stop. And then You know the other team score. 'cause there's like, there's like lingo that I didn't know anything about. So when the other team scores, they have to like announce who the person is that scored. And then the whole crowd at the same time is like, who cares? Who cares?


I'm like, oh my God, I gotta get into all the legal. So I have, who cares? And grab your dick. Oh, that's so funny. Okay. I like, I like grab your dick and kiss. I'm, I'm gonna use that. Like when, oh, I thought you gonna say when you get mad a lot. My, my kids, especially Corey. Okay. That too. But, but Corey thinks I'm his like buddy. And so he likes to just like wrestle and rough house and Yeah. Sometimes like, You know, play Tackle me. No, I grab the Dick Twist Yes. Wrestling with him anymore. Of know.


I know. I'm like, Corey, I'm your mom. I'm a like, I'm a female. Why are you doing, he you in a headlock. Like, I mean, he, he will like, not a headlock, but he'll like tackle me like a, like do like a football tackle onto the bed. Okay. That's like, yes. Yeah. He'll jump. Like, I'll be in my bed.

And the boys are all like in the face nonsense. You know. Just doing all these movements, God around you and throwing the, throwing the ball at your head. That, that is my life. So I'll be in the bed and Corey will just pound, take off running from my door.


No jump. Yes. Just like, jump on top of my bed. Tell him yelling at you. I this little buddy. It's so crazy. No. Yeah. So I can't grab his face. You can only grab Juan Twist would be a cringey.

I I wanna tell y'all about two shows that I've been watching. Oh yes. I know you've watched Monsters. I know you have. I have not. Oh, you haven't. The reason why I haven't watched it is because Ashley, once again, I'm spending a lot of time with Ashley. Okay. Told me their story. Oh, And I. 'cause I didn't really know that they were getting abused. Yeah. And I. Remember like vaguely when it all like happened? Yeah. Or when it was like news And I. Remember it was You know. Yes.

Like he was doing, it was like wild. Like that, like horrible. So, and they've been in jail for like 35 years. Yeah. Yeah. Let 'em out. Right. Like enough. Yeah. And from what I understand, they're like the model jail citizens. Really? Yeah. What is, what is an s Even even if you murder is what, 25 years life? Yeah. Like if you get life Yeah. That's like 20 something. Yeah. So maybe. 'cause it was two people, so they probably have two life sentences. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's time.

It's intriguing. Yeah. I did watch season one. Okay. Okay. And then How To Die Alone. Oh, that's on Hulu as well. Okay. So do you, and this might be good. Okay. So Old Man, you gotta watch that with Juan.


'cause he would like all that. Yeah, I think we did watch it together. Shoot him up. Bang Bang. So Insecure with Issa Rae. Remember the one of her girlfriends with like the curly hair? Who was kind of like the crazy one that would like say crazy stuff? You don't remember? I didn't really watch Insecure. Okay. Well Juan did. Yes. Okay. So anyway, she has her own show and it's like, has episodes or whatever. And it's funny How to Die Alone. And it's on Hulu. Oh, so that's a comedy. It's funny. Yes. Okay. Yeah. On Hulu. All right.

How to Die Alone. How to Die Alone. Okay. So we wanna read something because we love y'all when we say y'all our fans. 'cause we have one or two fans. Okay. So this is from Jen Lancon. Okay. Lankin. Yeah. Let's say Lancon. Jen. It says, Hey y'all, my fiance Tommy And I got married on the 26th of October. And just wanted to see if I can get a shot out so I can play it on the DJ.


Stand at the wedding. Oops. So we didn't make it. We okay. We a little late. We a little late. But Jen, we love you and we wish you and Tommy the best. And you can, you can take this clip and like send it to all your friends. Right? You do a little go check. Oh my gosh. A little text check. Okay. We are a little late. Yes, we are a little late.

Remain best friends. Totally. And everything else will fall into place. Yes. Oh my gosh. That's so funny. And we have some ask us anything, I think.


Right? But I think that the, a lot of these we have answered. Like for instance, if y'all could have one superpower, what would it be? And what would you do with it? Remember? Haven't we answered the superpower? I don't think so. We haven't. Yeah. 'cause I'm don don't know my answer. Well, well, so what is yours then? Oh, damn. We didn't answer it. Okay. That was the time. Okay. So I think my superpower would be, well, two things. Okay. One I can see in the dark. That would be your superpower. That's not my superpower. I just want y'all to Oh, okay. Be like sometimes. 'cause I was watching this thing and with Kat Williams and somebody asked him, what is his superpower?


He said he's clairvoyant. Okay. Okay. I can see in the dark. That's not a superpower. Okay. I don. I know it's not superpower. Okay, now let's get to my superpower. I mean, I was just telling y'all about myself. Like, I can see you in the dark. Really? Okay. But yes. Okay. Yeah. So my superpower would be that I could Oh, yeah. Like read somebody's mind. Mm. Do I wanna read your mind now? Yeah. I mean, not mine, but someone else's. It sounds good, but do I really wanna know what you're thinking? Right? Yeah. No, I say no. No, I don't want that. Like, don don't wanna I don't wanna know like, the future, what the future holds. Like I don't wanna know any of that. Yeah. But I, I do have a little bit of clairvoyance about me.


You do? Little bit. Just a tad. Okay. Not a lot. Okay. I don't wanna anybody get exact You know, like, you can think of something, something comes to your mind and then like happens the, the next day it happens. Yes. Or like, that happened to me recently. It was a random person. I was like driving And I thought about this random person. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I need to call so and so. And then the next day they called you. Yes. Yes. I'm like, so you need to tap into that, Robin. You have, you have the gift. The people call it the gift. Really? Yes. Mm. Okay. Yeah. But you have to own it. You gotta be like, I got the gift. Okay. You gotta say it. Okay. I got the gift. Yeah. I got the gift. Yes. You got the gift, Robin. Yes. So like, like my mother has some of that.


Cow has some of that too. Really? Cal can tell you about a person and they've had a conversation with him. He was, had a conversation with somebody. Like one time. There's a, there's a random man that just walked into your house. Do You know who that is? Into my house? Yeah. He just walked into his house. Yes. He has dreads. He's, he took a shoe. There he is. Oh, ham. Okay. Hi, how you doing? How good. I'm sorry. No worries, no worries. So we're at Robin's house and it was a random man that just walked. Okay. So Robin's office where our studio is near the front door. Yes. A random man walked past Oh my God. And wa and wa Robin did not even see it. No, I did not. I'm looking at you. And. I. See this?


I mean, mind you, he's got on a baseball hat. He's got he's he's holding his shoes. So he knows take his shoes off and sneak to the house. Right. Do You know ham? Yes. Okay. I'm glad because Ham came through this Juan's friend from years ago. Yes. Okay. I does ham eat food because Juan's not eating these days. I wonder if they're gonna have like lunch if they're gonna juice together. So actually that'd be a hot day. You know. It's crazy. Ham actually got Juan into juicing. Oh, well, good. Okay. Yeah. So maybe he brought to, he didn't bring any fruits. No, I saw he was empty handed. Okay. Moving on. What is your superpower? Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Maybe I can remember everything I read. That'd be a good superpower.


That would be, yes. That would be a great one. Everything I read, I remember. Okay. And can tell you back. Okay. I would like to fly in the sky. Yes. Cool. Like bird. Yes. I like that. I like to be able to fly. Just fly anywhere. Yeah. Just get to like, just zoom around. Like, okay. That's what I would like to be able to do. I like that. Yeah. And then that way that alleviates planes. Did you It alleviates a lot of stuff. Yeah. Did you used to, so when I was a kid, I used to run really fast and try to fly, but it never happened. Right. Robin, what kind of childhood did you have?


That was your childhood was disturbing. Okay. I literally would just run, take off running, and then expect to like, fly propel, propel myself into the Who are your parents? I actually know your parents and they have since, but you don't what? I tried You know. I mean, if you don't try, you don't know. Like, so, okay. But you didn't wanna ask or you didn't think like there's something called gravity. They didn't teach you that in school? Maybe, but maybe I just thought if I ran fast enough, I would take off. I just would listen. We gonna give you a superpower. Your ass gonna be flying. I wanna fly.


Clearly. I wanna fly. Jeez, this is a mess. Robin is hilarious. Oh my gosh. Okay, moving on. We, we had, okay, so I want to read about the UPS drivers. Yes. Okay. This is from mm, Alyssa. Okay. Okay. So Alyssa says, Hey ladies, following up on the UPS guy conversation from a few episodes ago. My husband is a UPS driver, and yes, he's sexy. Mm. And he has great legs. Ha ha ha. Mm. But seriously, I wanted to mention that they are not allowed to enter anyone's home.


Mm. They're instructed to only step one foot in someone's doorway to avoid any false allegations or misconduct. Okay. Makes sense? Yep. So anyone needing help taking a package upstairs to their bedroom would need to call a moving company, not UPS. Mm. Love you both. Keep up the great work and thanks for the laughs. Alyssa. Yes. She said, do not think about it. My husband is not coming in your house. But Alyssa doesn't understand that this is what he told her. This may or may not be in the handbook. Okay. Alyssa, this is what your husband told you. And he should tell you that. And there's, is there anything in the handbook that says I can't go in the back of the truck for a quick little break?


Ooh. Okay. Robin just thought this thing threw. She said, you can't come in my house, but I can go in the back of your truck. Right? Can I get your truck? Can I go retrieve my package? Ooh. From the back of your truck. Ooh, this is getting good. This is hot and heavy. Alyssa. Girl, you better get Robin because Robin is coming for your man. Does she leave his name? No, she does not leave his name. Nope. I think that, send him to my house. It's up to their discretion. Okay. They, there probably is a rule saying that they can't come in. I'm sure. I'm sure. However, that I can't go in their truck. You could probably go in the truck. I doubt it. Okay. Oh, you think the truck has like, cameras? Cameras? Ooh. Probably not spicy.


No. Robin cameras. So that, that he doesn't get fired. Right. So that he is like not stealing people's packages. There we go. It probably does have cameras, so he probably can't go. So your best bet is to just leave the door open. See if he walks in. Put two feet in front the doorway. See what happens. U ps Man, we coming for you? I'm coming for mine. Oh my gosh.

How does the light stay? don? Don't know. Is there a battery? Do you need to charge this thing? No, nothing. don don't know what, but I'm here for this. Yeah, that's cute. Lumi lip. I wish I would've thought about this. So have you tried it in the dark yet? Yes, you have. It's everything. Or even like, sometimes restaurants are dark. Right? True. I take this if I can't read the menu. Oh, And I. Light up the menu. Listen, I am in ingenious Ingen. Ingenu. I'm that word. You're not that And I. I'm all, I'm all those words. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I wanna see it. I wanna see it in action. Yeah. Lemme to the back. Lemme get your life.


Yes. Alright. So Blake, Tiffany, or is it Blake? Okay. Blake. Blake says, hi, girly Pops Blake here. Day one, watcher, listener of ROP and Reasonably Shady. Obsessed with you both. I wanna know if this is reasonable or shady. Okay. Let's get into it. Speaking of COVID during the height of COVID, my partner And I were leaving Target after shopping and noticed a cart that was just sitting in the parking lot. The cart was empty except a large package of toilet paper. We were already driving away. But I screamed at my partner to slam on the brakes and jump out of the car and ran across the parking lot to get this toilet paper. 'cause remember toilet paper was like in high demand.


Yes. Low supply. I grabbed that thing, like my life depended on it and booked back to the car before anyone could say or see anything. Mm. I did feel a little guilty, but as you all know, that ish was hard to come by and expensive. Yes. Anyway, let me know y'all thoughts. Love you both. Bye. So was that reasonable or shady? She was to death. No, it was stuffed. You're a criminal. It was, it wasn't either. So no, but I don't think that's stuffed because it probably was paid for and someone, she didn't pay for it, but somebody did. And they forgot it. And they forgot it. Right. So you think they were gonna come, they were gonna Yes. Realize they forgot their toilet paper and come all the way back to hell. Yes. Target thinking that it was still gonna be there.


No, by the time they realized they forgot their toilet paper and came back, it was gonna be gone anyway. Right. By the woman who stole it or So Yes, that was shady. Or the other people who might steal it, or the people who work at the store who just put it back on the shelves and then they make double off of the toilet paper that they sold twice. It's not reasonable and shady. That's a crime. You are a thief. I think it's reasonable. You're criminal. I think it's very reasonable. Okay. Lemme tell you why. Actually kind of smart. No, I was coming out of Whole Foods one day. So if you saw a $20 bill on the ground, you wouldn't take it. I was coming out of Whole Foods one day in Baltimore. Yeah. And I was putting my clo I mean, my packages in the car. And I left my purse in the cart.


Mm. And I drove off. Mm. And I was like, holy shit. Right. So I doubled back, skirt around the corner, skirt around the corner, got there and there was a guy standing next to the cart. He was about to take it. Mm. So I got, I put the car in park, jumped out, grabbed my purse, gave him a look, up and down, up and down. And then I got back in the car. Up and down. Up and down. Yes. Yes. Like him a look. And then I got back in the car. And I drove off. Okay. Had I been, what's the lady name? Blake? Had I been Blake or had Blake? He'd been Blake. He'd been Blake. I'd have been short. He would've taken your purse? He'd have taken my purse. No, he, and it was a Chanel purse at that. Oh yes. See now? Mm.


That I still have to this day. See? Okay. If, but that's different. It's we talking toilet paper and we talking like someone's purse with all of their like belongings. Right. My wallet, my everything. So for me, if I saw toilet paper and it's clear that like the person forgot it, they probably left it on the bottom of the thing. Yeah. Of the, the cart. They forgot it. I, I'm, I'm probably gonna take it, but in Covid when like toilet paper was Oh. During was hard to come by. Okay. Right. But today, yeah. No, like I'll just, yeah. Yeah. I'll just leave it just Cory would or Carter or, because I, Carter Carter, are we gonna talk about Sweet Green? We, what are we gonna do? We're good because leave Carter out of this.


Leave Carter out the Okay. Cory might, Cowan might. Okay. Got it. Yes. Okay. Robin, you're in the getaway card. Yes. They're throwing a toilet paper into You're taking off. Yes. And we're take off. Okay. Yes. I think I would like, I, I think I would like, Hmm. There's some toilet paper there. Somebody left it. I mean, they're probably gonna forget. They're not gonna come back. I mean, okay. All they're gonna at the store, all the store's gonna do is put it back on the shelf. Let me take it. Yeah. Right. But if it was your purse, oh my God. Somebody left their purse. I'm like, their purse. My purse. Okay. Let me, oh, let me grab this purse. Yeah. And see if I can find their identification Right. And figure out how to get it to them, or, oh my God, they left a purse.


Let me walk it into the store to the, like the security people. Yes. Yes. Yeah. The loss prevention people, whatever. I scurried around that, that corner And, I got my purse back. But I, I just do, I believe in Karma. I really do. It's toilet paper. So then one day I am not gonna be able to wipe my butt like I'm gonna be at a restaurant. That's why you get a bidet. Okay. I'm gonna be at a restaurant. I think I have toilet paper. I'm gonna be at the airport. I think toilet paper's there. Then I sit And, I put the little sheet down. I sit down, I and there's nothing to wipe me. Oh, that's gonna happen. That's called Karma. Really? Yes. So you're just gonna let the store sell the toilet paper twice. I'm just gonna go home, mind, mind your business and just, and mind my business. I'm, I'm a good mind my business or even though everybody thinks I'm in everybody's business, I'm not Only when you're paid to do so.


Yes. When I paid to do so, I do it well, I do it so well. Well, Blake, I think that was reasonable. Okay. I'm not mad at you for that. Okay. And You know if ever in that scenario, again, don, don't think there's anything wrong with that. Blake, you're wrong for that. And so if, if and Oh, You know what, what? I want Blake to write us back Okay. And let us know whether or not she got toilet paper karma. Okay. Because she probably did something probably happened somehow, some way, didn't even realize it, didn't even realize it, it was connected to the Covid toilet paper theft. Yes. So, so do some hard thinking, Blake, before you get to typing and let us know. Okay. Okay. Is that fair? Sure. Okay. Yeah, I'd love to know. All right. We, where are we outta here? We got one more?


We can just do one more, just a little fact check. Okay. Honestly, I think we need to start a new segment call fact check called Shady Fact check, because like Thanks. Thanks for fact checking us. Yeah. Because Carly's gone. She fact check. Yeah. Carly's gone. And even when Carly was here, we still sometimes didn't get right. We're struggling. People struggling. I can't tell you how many messages we would get. That's not what happened. So here's a fact check. Okay. We were talking about Beyonce not being nominated for Yes. The Country Music Awards. And I said that Taylor Swift won the Grammy over Beyonce. So Ty McMurray writes, Hey ladies, on your most, most recent podcast you mentioned how Renaissance lost to Taylor Swift. It was actually Harry Styles not Taylor don. Don't even remember that.


But I remember, I guess he said, that's not what you said. That's not what we said. I said she lost against Taylor Beyonce a long time ago. Taylor beat Beyonce. No, no, no. I said, you said, we said we thought Renaissance should have won a Grammy. Okay. Right. And I and And I said, and you were like, who won? Yeah. The Grammy And I said Taylor Swift. Oh, okay. So I was wrong. It was actually Harry Styles. Oh, I know this because I remember how entertaining his album was. He talked about doing cocaine, eating a female body part. What? And walking through fire for it all. It was crazy. I too wanted Renaissance to win, but Harry's house was good too. Listen to the album if you ever get a chance. So anyway, that was a fact check. I stand corrected if that's, thanks for that fact. Check And I. I actually enjoyed that.


'cause I didn't know Harry was talking about eating women's body parts Right. And doing coke and, oh, listen, that's, that's a whole lot. What body part did he eat and how did it taste? Right? Did he put ketchup on it? Yeah. Go put it on. Go. Go. Put that. Did he put ketchup on it? Salt and pepper. All right. We gotta go guys. We love y'all so much. Don't ever forget to live your life either reasonable or shady, or both. Bye. Reasonably Shady is a production of the Black Effect Podcast Network.
