So Lauren's filling in and we got a special guest in the building. Ladies on Guy. It's going down. Wallo. Listen Man, Welcome to The. Breakfast Club this morning presented to you by million dollars Worth a game. Listen man, we done bought the company, man. It's, it's good man. It's going down man. We doing it big now man. Got my brother right here. I'm so proud of you, Wallo, man. Listen man, Listen. I wanna give you, before I even start, I gotta give you your flowers 'cause you been man, you it me and you done had several phone calls. We had a thousand phone calls a couple years ago. You hit me up, you was like, Wallo, you need a book. This was years ago and you was talking about how you and Kev was talking about you and Kevin Hart was talking.


I said, man, Wallo would be crazy on a, on a audio book. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Which I did my own audio book. Shout out to You know. Shout out to Ayanna van Z also, who did the audio? She did the forward for me. Shout out to 13 A my publisher man for You know Charles suit. Yes. For making it happen. Simon the Schuster. But we here now. You told me you keep telling me about a book of your book. The book changed your life. That's right. And you got too much of a story, man. The book. The book, the book. That's all you kept saying. And now we here man Armed with Good Intentions You know. And it's game changer for you. The book Title is perfect for you because there's not too many people on this planet who come with good intentions like Wallo does. Appreciate that. When Did you develop that, that mentality? I don't know man. I was on the street corners.


I was, I was, I had good intentions on the street corners. I just, I just, I just wanted to steal American dream. And I said, man, this shit is too slow. And I. I never seen nobody in my neighborhood. The only people that got respect in my neighborhood was successful criminals. So even though I was a good person growing up, my grandma raised me well, my mom You know, You know. I was like, I gotta figure this out. So I said I gotta, I got man, the only people they respect out here is the people that's winning by any means. And then even in America, I was like, damn, hold up America. They only respect the Scarface. They don't even respect the Godfather. They don't respect nobody else. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotta go get some money. So I just figured out You know, even though my heart was good, I had to go figure it out. And that led me to prison most of my life. And and but You know even in there you Prison 13 years, right?


13 years. 20, 20. I did 20 penitentiary five years in and outta the juvenile system. And even to me, I remember You know, oh here saying man, why you, all I did was laugh in jail and just do what I needed to do. Educate myself. 'cause I realized that. And to the point where somebody said I was one of the nicest dude in prison because I knew why I was there. I did mines. I was accountable for my bullshit. So You know and that helped me change and develop into what I become today. And You know I'm just happy to be here. And, I, And, I, And I. Try my best to share all the knowledge that I got as You know with our people to show us, listen, we bigger than what y'all think we are. Because I always say this and it's crazy to me. It's like You know back in the day we didn't had nothing but we had everything 'cause we had each other.


Mm. And that was important. And it's like, it seemed like now we find so many ways, so many reasons not to deal with each other. And it's like God damn who you working for Word. That's right. Like you go on social media, it's like who you working for? But I had to realize something. A lot of us don't want to look in that mirror and deal with it. I don't hate envy because of his money is cars, his family, his marriage. I hate envy because envy get in love for doing something that I always wanted to do. But I ain't have enough heart to go out here and do it. Well Die your bid. No, I'm not talking about that. I'm just talking about in general. Oh, okay. Yeah, he do got that Beijing You do. But I'm just saying like, shout out Beijing, give him a deal.


It's not Beijing but, but like this and third it's just for man. But oh damn. Okay. He better be paying you the way you Promo. But but what I'm saying is like that's how our culture became, it became like this and social media made it like a lot of people gotta look in the mirror and say, damn, I done materialize my dreams right up. And that's the hardest thing to do is up You know. So it's more easy to say, y'all mean to sucker envy this Lord this just this. It's much more easy to say than to say let me get off my ass and go ahead and do something with my life. So, but it's just, it's just sad out here when you see it now. And it's just like we just, I don't know man. And all we ever had was each other. That's the only way we ever made it in life. You said you in the book, you said it's actually in the chapter arm of good intentions.


You said you, you, you, you screamed out one day and you made it a daily reminder that nobody will save you. Nobody. Especially when I was in prison. I'm like, we could playing and, and we doing. I'm like, yo, bro, we aint, we inside these white folk spot. Ain't ain't nobody coming. Like if this shit go off anything, we gonna be locked in these cells. Ain't nobody coming. But that's the same thing in the ghetto. Ain't nobody never come and save nobody. Right. Who saves who real. What was the change for you? What was, 'cause you said you were in and out. What was the change? You said yo, I gotta get this right. And, I gotta change myself. Like to be realistic man, I I got tired of tired of being in jail with a bunch of, with a bunch of niggas. You see what I'm saying? I wanted to take a butt naked shower You, know what I mean? I couldn't do that. I wanted to sleep naked in the bed. I couldn't do that 'cause I'm in the, I gotta cell.


I don't know if he might wake up in the middle of the night, be like, yo man, let me, I need parts of that. Like what we doing? Yeah. I I, I'll be straight up. He might wake up in the middle of the night and be like, Hey my man, let's let's figure something out. Oh shit. You know what I mean? So I don't know. I'm just being real because listen, You know what's crazy. I think one of the reasons I made it through jail so smoothly. 'cause I was always a, a comedian on the low You, know what I'm saying? I was always funny. They was like, hey, I mean I was, 'cause I was in there scared to death. You know how dudes come on from jail. I be trying to wonder that shit I did all this time in jail. I'd be like, what program was you on that you wasn't scared in jail? That you was just so tough? Yeah, because I was scared to death. Soon as they listen, soon as that judge gave me them numbers and they You know you, you had your shoe, had your thing together.


The shit ain't about nothing You know what I mean? Like this shit ain't about nothing. I looked at it. Alright, say my little words back and forth. You see the it it is back and forth. Word play I had with the judge is that yeah I'm gonna be back. Ah, walked in the joint You. know what I mean? Now you gotta do the walk back in. 'cause now you're going back into the cages where everybody looking at you when you come down. What they give you with it? That shit ain't about nothing man. They gave me little twenties, man. That shit ain't enough. A little twin. No, but that's the, that's the cat. That's the cat. By the time I get to my, my cell later on that I throw their towel up crying like a baby man for a newborn. Damn. And then, and then once you, the shackles hit you box like a animal, the shackle is going from your arm to your feet. You get upstate, you, you hit that penitentiary yard and you like you my mom at oh shit, I ain't know it was like this.


Mm. I'm seeing people with knives longer than the giraffe trunk. I'm like, shit, how old are you? I was, I was, I went to the penitentiary when I was 17, but I hit the big prison yard when I turned 18. I was in Dallas Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. And that was like, that was a different type of job man. I'm seeing people get married in the yard and all that shit. I'm like, I ain't trying to beat nobody wife. I ain't signed up for this shit. So I know straight up I'm looking like he Said married in the yard. No, people was getting married in the yard. And, I said damn man, shit. It wasn't real weddings though. No, it was real weddings. Like it wasn't no like they If you got the Bible when you got somebody that's offic you Attending like you you were just in The yard too. No, I was walking in the yard. And, I walked back. You know Like a guest at the, no, I was not, I wasn't a guest. I was in the backdrop because I was walking in the yard.


So I'm like, I'm sitting there and I'm like, oh shit, I ain't trying to get married in the yard man, damn. Like want some real shit. And then I'm seeing people getting stabbed and all. I'm like, yo, I'm not trying to, why the, so I would go to my cell and be like, yo, what the fuck is going on? I ain't signed up for this because nobody tell you this because only stories that we hear back in the hood about jail is that you come home and you get rewarded and you get acknowledged and you tough and all this other shit. You get muscles. But I'm like, I'm like damn, ain't nobody talking about the scary part. So I had to be the one to tell the scary part to tell the real part because I was scared. Especially listen, when I first listened to no bullshit, I get up to the big penitentiary. This was, this was the one I get up to the big penitentiary. This is why Gill always fucking with me about it because I used to tell these stories.


I get up to the stories from the cell. So I get up to the penitentiary, the shower time I go down there, I got my boxers on and all that. So I'm like, damn, ready? Go down there. And this is my first time in a real 'cause. 'cause it's like, it was like, I, I, I started, I went to the penitentiary when a young, when a lot of younger dudes started to go like you was getting certified as adult. They created new law. So a long time there wasn't no young boys in the one penitentiary. I went to Dallas Penitentiary. It's mostly old heads and they had the most lifers in the state of Pennsylvania at this time. So you could be in a cell with anybody. You could do one year, be in a cell with a lifer. It don't matter. So I go, I go to go to the shower. So I got my towel on my, my my boxers on.


And when I went to the shower, right, I go down there steamed up and everything. The shower is probably like, it's probably like in that joint probably maybe 15 shower heads. And the block got a hundred and something dudes on there. So when I go in the shower room, it was like a movie. Like everybody looked at me like why you got them boxes on anybody else? I'm talking about it was a, I'm talking about it was a sword show in that joint. Man. You wanna see what you working with type thing? No, no. I'm just like, no. It's like that's not normal. Like you. Yeah. And I'm like, You know what? That day I realized that a shower wasn't important in a bird bath. I said I could go back to my cell and just wash up there. Yeah. Yeah. Why would I need what, why I do a shower really mean that. So you Ain't take a shower, your whole, you burb bath The whole way?


No, I took it for a while till I just You know. Went down there and just had my short on Yeah. To get comfortable because I, 'cause I had, I was like, damn man, like why everybody gotta be naked in this joint man. And then they looking at you then they talking like, like they be ass nigga. They talking. Yeah. You see the game. Oh man, what's the name went on ETT Smith. I'm like, man, oh man. Like we ain't supposed to like, y'all supposed to be doing this shit. I don't know. When did you get like, like, like comfortable with it? Like your first naked shower? Were you talking? No, I never got a naked shower. I didn't Oh yeah I did hold Said, but I Got no, I got one when I got to the jail where you get your own booth. Okay. I wasn't trying to be a part of it 'cause it's like, it's like a volunteering, like you volunteering something. How long it took to do that?


Oh, years. It took years. But different jail, different part of the jail got different sections where you get a single shower. So, and that jail was yours where you got the single shower locked in. But it was like, man, I always felt like that was the volunteering services. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you was, you was, you was giving invitations to something. So I didn't know was The coke, was the coke can story real that that booie be talking about sometimes that he was in a different prison though. But I'm, I'm thinking it might be the same prison. Which one you say when you see a Coke can in the shower, That ain't two men in there? Fucking No, no. It is different, different different things going on in different prisons. I can't speak to that 'cause I wasn't in the, the geographical location of him. But it's different stuff. Fair state. Different states. But it's like I just knew that I I they Signaled sodomy in your, in the prison you Was in? What you mean signaled?


No, it was no signal. People was making love to slow music man. It wasn't no like you knew what time it was. Dudes had red light. Listen bro. Dudes said dudes used to take dude to take No, no, no. Listen. Dudes used to take paint and paint. They light red. It'd be red lights, red light. Sp TLC Man they got the music playing. You like don't look in that cell because you nah dang ain't supposed to look in nobody's cell. Yeah. So I'm like man, I You know you can't look in nobody's cell. But see That That's the signal though. The signal was the red Light. No, it could be anything man. You could walk in the bathroom, in the yard. Somebody be tongue kissing and You know romantic. I don't know. It was a lot of stuff. Jesus Christ. I just knew that. I just wanted to make it out innocent. Oh man, I don't want my innocence to be removed from me. That's all. But it was wild man. But I knew it was certain occasions where I knew, I said, oh man, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't go back to this shit.


Dude put something on my bed one time. What he put, I didn't, I didn't even know. He put on your bed, put on your bed. No Rose. No, no this what happened. No, no, no. This what happened. So what happened is my laundry came back folded and anything. I'm like, damn man, this a, these people man, they fold your laundry and everything man, I'm happy as shit. Laundry. There was a couple snacks left. I'm like, so I'm like damn, this is what's up. So a OG from down the way he peeped You. know what I mean? I asked him, I said, damn man, they they four. He said what they did What? Who? So he went and checked the older dude that did it. The older dude was trying to go on a date. But I didn't know it was, I didn't know that. Whoa. What Did he leave though? Like a no. Oh no, no, no. He didn't leave. No, no. He left. He left some nice, he had a box of nutty bars. It was some soup, some chips, some.


It was a nice, it was a listen it old way. Wouldn't have told I had, it was a nice spread You. know what I mean? So you gave it back to him? You had to give it back to him? I Had to give it back to him. Yeah, because If you accept it? No, no. But it wasn't just that he folded my laundry. He worked in laundry and made my drawers and all that. It was folded. So I'm thinking like, damn this is the pro this this is the protocol of what they, damn they, I'm like damn they got some good service here. You. know what I mean? But once I realized that he was looking for a date, I didn't. I said, oh shit. You see what I'm saying? Luckily that I had the old head did. 'cause I don't know what what the fuck happened. Yeah, yeah. But it was crazy. It was crazy man. It was deep. That's Why y'all gotta read this book Man. It was deep man. Oh, now you dedicated the book to Little Steve, aunt Ruby, grandma Aura, uncle James, uncle Tommy and hip hop.


How Did No Hip. Yeah, that's my step hop. How did each of those people contribute to your journey? My Aunt Ruby. First of all, my grandma. That's my, my my grandma nanny. She, she's, she'd be 90 to September 30th. She's, she's extraordinary. Aunt Ruby and her used to always gang war. My aunt Ruby You know she was the only person I seen straight my grandma out and don't nobody straight nanny out. And they used to be going at this, this was her younger sister. Oh man. And. I used to call home from jail. The stories that Aunt Ruby used to tell me was unbelievable. But Aunt Ruby was special. She just was different and, and she loved me, love us, love her. Some me, she wound up passing and she passed in my grandma house. The middle room that I wound up making parole to.


That was one of the reasons I was able to make parole. 'cause You know whatever. But God bless her. My, my, my aunt, my, my grandma Aura, she passed when I was in prison. She was amazing. Always real tell you just like it is. She was from the streets. Uncle Tommy passed since, since I've been home. Steve was your brother, right? Steve was my big brother. Yeah. He passed in my grandma arms in the crib. He got shot, ran down the street, died in, grabbed my arms, he opened the door, he aspired. That was my guy. But everybody, them people is personal You know what I'm saying? And they was special on my life in different ways. They helped me in so many different ways. And it's things that I carry today that I got from them doing my journey through You know doing.


Especially when they was here. And. I. Always wanna remember them people. 'cause I feel as though you, you, you, a lot of people get forgotten. They give us so much and just because they not there And, I always feel like you really live when you outlive how much you lived. Mm. And I'm saying that you really live when you outlive how much you live. It's people from our culture that outlive how much they live rather it's boss out. Whether it's Tupac, cer certain people, they live longer after life than they did their life. Absolutely. Absolutely. But we don't do that with our family members and the people that we love and the people that we know personally. We keep other people alive based off celebrity. But we won't keep the people alive that was personally personal to us.


They get buried in the thank yous and all that shit somewhere and sometimes forgotten. So I always try to remember my people that died. They, they gave so much to me. You think your Brother would believe you right now? Like if he saw the position you was in, would he believe it? No. On everything I love my brother be doing just what Gilby doing? Me calling me nut ass nigga. Look you just nut ass nigga boy because that was him. He's a funny boy. He was all he wanted to do was laugh all day. I'm just thankful that I was able to, the greatest thing that I ever did in life, in the history of my life was forgive my brother's killer. Mm. And the reason that was so important to me because the ghetto, nothing supersede nothing is the hierarchy is the ghet and the ghetto is revenge.


But for me to say You, know what I want to live for my brother, live for the kids, live for the family and put it in my heart to forgive someone that took my brother outta here. Hurt, devastated the family. But I said to myself is we always ask for forgiveness. We ask God all the time forgiveness, but when do we forgive on a real level? And and that was the greatest thing I ever did. And I always encourage young brothers to like You know. 'cause when you see our community, it's like everybody is moving based off of a lot of cats is moving and, and continuing this crime criminal mindset. And You know in the genocide based off war that they never even knew about. Like you don't even know why you beefing with somebody and we never have a conversation.


It's like, and even the level heads from different sides of the communities never could sit down and just be like, yo, this some bullshit. We on some bullshit. Yeah. Like come on y'all, we got like, we shooting in the mirror out here as black people and ain't nobody, I don't know what it is man. It, it bothered me. 'cause I see a lot of elders that's scared. They wanna be young niggas and it's like, no you're not nothing deaf. I tell 'em all the way I'm not, no, nah I'm not. No I'm not. I'm an elder dog. I'm not no young boy. I'm not trying to be cool with you. I'm gonna tell you what you want to hear. And If you don't. 'cause I know most of your day, especially the artist, the athletes, they run around with a bunch of Yes man. That's right. I ain't one of them NI don't care about I don't care who you is. That's right. I'm gonna tell you, listen man, that's some dumb shit man. You want some dumb shit. N me and Gil gonna be like, yo, that's some dumb shit. Neff and even If, you just hear me for the moment.


I did my job a lot of times I fell short in doing my job. I, well I I ain't gonna say I didn't do my job, but I fell short. 'cause it, it went on some deaf ears and we seen what happened with that. A lot of times, Man, look at all the different clips that you can look at of Wallo online warning people about I'm what was gonna happen in their situations or what was gonna happen if they didn't change their ways and it came true. Yeah. It's like I You know I just be peeping it 'cause I see it like you could just see it when you've been through it so long. But that's why I try to share my story so they can learn from my story and no live my story. But a lot of times the money make people blind and deaf. And when you get that paper you think. But one thing I know one thing I know something.


And if I don't know nothing about this shit, when you black in America, you got all the money and the power you want my man. But lemme tell you something. When Mighty Whitey get to you. That's Right. I'm just being real. When Mighty White it is over that courtroom. They they, they humble the shit outta you. They will get you in that court. You see how they laid Tyreek down Tyreek Hill, laid him down, roughed him up. Wow. Shut up. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Like, I don't know what happened but I'm like, they roughed him up real good And still had to, he still had to go out there and play Pretty sure You know what I'm saying? So it's like, it, it is always a point where though you be, it be like, man, shut up nigga. And you always gotta be on point to know You know, know how to move out here. And it's sad that we gotta do that. But that's the reality of the environment that that that we come up in.


When Did you realize this is what you wanted to do when you came home and you said you took that drive and you went back to, you had the McDonald's went to grandma's house. When did you realize this is what you wanted to do and, and how you wanted to change for the, the next generation? I was in, shout out to the life of g Lifer Brothers, this organization NWCP and all that. The, the, the brothers that was in the penitentiary with me, the eldest, there's an organization called Real Street Talk. So I'm in there and they, and one of the O OGs brother, brother minister Rob, shout out to him. He come to me, he said, wah, we need you to come down here and talk. It was a bunch of Brother Shakur Sharif. It was, well Ike a big Shannon. It was a bunch of brothers that was getting together to talk to the, the inmates that was coming in.


Two 300 inmates a week that was coming in to talk to them about listen, why you in jail? Use this as your time to educate yourself so you go back out there and make something happen with yourself. And it was called Real Street Talk. So I was one of the dudes that spoke in a, in a way to where as though they really understood what I was saying. 'cause I was like one of the youngest dude, even though the OG spokes too. And I seen that they was listening. They was tapped into it. And it was a brother, brother Rob Griffin. He was from the, he used to do security for Malcolm X and the nation Islam. Back in the day, Philadelphia used to be the You know the head of security for the nation Islam back in the day. And he, he You know he held down Malcolm Muhammad, all them. And he came to my cell one day because I was in the cell like next to him and on a block greatest four.


And he was like, brother, not too many brothers out here speak with though multiple generations could listen and understand it. And then like you, you speak clear, keep doing that. So when I got out, I just started grabbed it, grabbed that phone and just start popping it because nobody was doing it. And I knew that I had to do it in a unique way because I was battling on the timeline. I was battling for attention. Right. You know when you go down the timeline, I'm looking at this shit. I say, okay, I gotta battle the girl this ass naked. I gotta battle my man with a pound of jury on. I gotta battle of the rapper, the athlete. I said I got him. That's why If, you seen a lot of my videos in the beginning, I'll be running across the highway. 18 Willer come laying on the ground, catch him on the head. They laughing. But I'm giving you the message long as you listening. 'cause what everybody was afraid to tell us, like, yo, you can be great, you amazing.


Like we built pyramids with no cranes. I don't know what I, I'm reading this shit in the jail. I'm like, hold up. We did that. You mean to tell me hold up, you mean to tell me We You know we came up outta slavery. This little lady got us outta slavery sister got us outta slavery and that ingenuity. Oh, what the fuck is going on? Frederick Douglas was who? He did what? Oh, we, we got most of the patents. Most the shit create. Oh what the, I'm like, yo, we could do it, but you gotta, I realized this If, you can make 'em laugh. You can make 'em listen. And, I always was like, I always loved comedy because I used to listen to I Paul Moody, Richard Pryor, all of my uncle would play the records. Red Fox, And I be laughing, but they'd be saying some deep shit and be, they'd lace it up.


So I'm like, okay, I just gotta give it to our people in a different way. You know because I just couldn't get the whole Harriet Tubman thing just, just had me just like, yo, it's nothing. You can't do that. Fuck the, the them them pyramids I'm talking about with no cranes. There's no how did, how was this done? We did that. These adventures, we did this. We created what So it'd be like what Black Wall Street did. So I'd just be looking like, no, it's just a different way and a different language of doing it. And one thing that I'm always do, you'll never hear me say nothing. You'll never hear me talk down or hate any of our people. You know why never. All of our people got a different, they got a, they might have a different message and it, and no matter what you're doing, business this, that, I don't care what you're doing, we don't have to be doing the same thing.


And just because we ain't doing the same thing, even if we might be doing something that's similar, we ain't gotta be mad at each other. I ain't gotta hate you. You ain't gotta hate me because at the end of the day, is this shit really about the upliftment of our people. If it is, how can I go online and say anything bad about our people? If I really care about our people Right. I can't tear you down to lift them up. It ain't going, it don't mathematically it don't work. So what I do is no matter If, you say something about me, say something about whatever, I'm never gonna say nothing about nobody because that's not gonna add value to the whole plan of us. That's Wallo Really like this dude, I'm not gonna do that. Even off camera. He's like That And, I Be like, fuck these niggas I was Gonna ask you. He do you and Gil. So like this is like a daily thing for you. Like on and off camera like you said.


But like when situations come about, like when people make you upset, when things don't go your way. Like how do, what's your mental lock in that you stay grounded where you are right now? Like what's that? My, my thing is this, some of the times when I, people have said things or I wasn't like, I even look at it And, I, look at it now from a critique bone be like, yo is that person right. Am I tripping? I'm not a person that's like, I'm logic to the point where it's though there's a possibility where it's though I might do some dumb shit or some nut shit. So I will even look at it because it's like, listen after me dealing with the white folks in that mountains and them coming in my cell at anytime just because I'm beefing with the guard for a week and he coming in my cell every day for a week telling me to get asshole naked and spread and cough.


None of this shit mean nothing to me out here. You think this shit means I did 7,300 days in jail. You think I give so it's not that deep. But I, I'm also would look at things and say damn do they got, do they got a point there? Because sometimes they might have a point and just because you not rocking with me, that don't mean you hating on me. I might not just be your cup of tea and you might don't know how to reach out or whatever. You might just, so it's like I'm big on that. Everybody's not hating on you 'cause they don't like what you got going on. And sometimes I understand you might rub people the wrong way 'cause you might remind them that they ain't go after they dreams. That's right. So it's levels to this shit. But You know what I need y'all to do is I need y'all to all try that drink at once. This is my drink Prime, my Jason drink. Pure, Pure, pure, pure, Pure, pure, pure.


I said earlier, take a sip. I do gotta ask you a question though. You said when the officers came in your cell right? The white boys. Oh my god. And they told you to get naked. Hold time out. Time out what to drink? Yeah. I Like it. Let see. Don't drinking that watermelon blast. Tell me good morning. I like it. I like it. It's Good. Think that's all I need to know. I'm see y'all so warm. But go ahead get back to the No, when you said the officers used to come into your cell Yeah. And make you get naked and spread your ass cheeks. Did you fuss with 'em a little bit or you just, is that what you heard got naked? Yeah. That's all you Heard. No. You know what's crazy. Like I got so it was so like me, I was so institutionalized. As soon as I knew, as soon as I see him cracking the door, I'm already ass naked. Like I'm just like, what's up? What we doing today baby? What we doing? Because I knew that, I knew that they wanted to see, they wanted to see some black heat. For real.


They, they was trying to, they was, they was trying to measure, they was trying to see some black heat. I knew what was time. I said all fuck it then let's get it. Come on, let's do it. You walked in the kitchen, you turned the oven on. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's go. We we at it again. Y'all back. Huh? I know what y'all want. Yeah. Shut up. People's turn around. All that shit hit the wall. I gotta put my hands on the wall, lift my feet, twinkle my toes and all that shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bent down, spray them. Then after I sprayed and grabbed my sack, I gotta go on my mouth and all this dumb shit. I'm like, yeah, y'all some kinky boys man. Yeah, whatever. Peoples keep being smart ass. I'm freaky d huh? Are you still interested? Like is there anything from like, when you was locked up You know how sometimes people come home and it's like, like I got you can't hear certain sounds or like You know, like, do you have any of that from all the time that you spent in jail? I got all type of shit. I just, I can't keep up with it.


There's so much. You can't keep up with all that shit. It's just so much. You just, you just live because You know what's crazy. Being from the ghetto, we normalized jail so much to where though You know the side effects of that shit that had you like everybody got that shit. The the family members got side effects from dealing with the jail experience and just going to see you. Yeah. Like You know what I mean? So it's like, it it, it's just crazy man. I I but, but I, when it comes to prison thing, what I think is so crazy.

A woman Dressed in a long red skirt pointed a 45 caliber pistol at the president. These are the only two times we know of that a woman has tried to assassinate a sitting us president and the two assassins had never met. One was the protege of infamous cult leader Charles Manson. She is 26-year-old Lynette Alice Fromm. Nicknamed Squeaky. I always felt like Lynette was kind of his right hand woman. The other, a middle-aged housewife. An aspiring radical working undercover for the FBI Identified by police as Sarah Jean Moore, Sarah Jane could enter into these areas that other people couldn't. A spy.

Is that And I wanna say this to the brothers out there, right? Especially If, you in the streets right now and you, you operating your gun. You, you just in the street game. I just wanna say something whether You know it or not, black young, black males in the street culture build more communities outside of our community than anybody in the history of life of America. Mm. Let me break this shit down. When we get locked up, I come from 1 9 1 3 2 Philadelphia. The most people that ever, they, they they, they sent the most people to prison. That, that that area code in Pennsylvania. Now when I get locked up and me and the homies get locked up, they build new prisons based on the population increase.


When the population increase, they'll take a town, they'll go rent some farm area, they'll bring a Lego prison, put it together, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Once they bring that prison, they build the gas station, they build the Walmart, they employ all these farmers. And this is me and the homies doing this. And then now you now you got all this stuff. They got this whole community that we built. But we never, we never, we never built our own community. We never bought our mom a house. We never sent our kids to college. But we sending kid, we sending kids to college. Every time you shoot a gun in the ghetto, you're sending somebody else kid to college. Every time you rob somebody, you're sending somebody, you buying somebody paying somebody else mortgage. Like we are the ultimate, the real street nigga is the ultimate job security in America.


The real street niggas. I'm create more jobs than any other people. Any other group in America. More police, probation officers, sheriffs. I'm talking about all these, every department judges, correctional officers, counsel, lawyers. Now think about the jail. In the jail You know how many people we probably over a thousand people we employ in the prison. And you gotta think about it. Everybody from the the guard to the, to the counselor, to the peer per people that work in the kitchen to the nurses like we do this. And it'd be families. It'd be nepotism on its highest level in there. I've been in prison, And I done seen guards start as a rookie and them turn in the war. And I've been in prison so long.


And this grandpa, uncle, son, cousin. And on the other side, If, you look at this picture in the book, And I. Try to explain generational incarceration. This picture right here in the book of me right here. That's me in the back. This is my step pop hip that died. That's my brother Steve. That's my little brother Al. So in this prison, Dallas prison penitentiary this in the eighties, right? This is 87. So in 87 we going to Dallas Prison to visit him. In 1998, me and my step pop was cellies in that same prison. Wow. And in 2005, me and my brothers were selling in that same prison, man. Generational incarceration. And when we looking on the other side, you'll go see the warden. Then his son is a sergeant. His cousin is a major. Like so we got families in prisons, but they on the winning side, we on the losing side.


So when we talking about this whole thing, this whole, I'm a real nigga, I understand what you're saying, but you gonna be a real nigga and you gonna be in prison when your daughter graduating and growing up. And there's gonna be some other men in our life that's giving a game that's not beneficial to her. It's beneficial to them and your daughter gonna get taken advantage of. So it's like when we looking at this whole thing that we think we putting it down. I got a bunch of brothers on the other side that could tell you they wish they could, they could relive this 'cause they ain't never coming outta jail. But you, you, the generational curse breaker, Wallo, that's, I'm glad I'm trying to, that's I'm so glad you put out a book man. 'cause that's right. I need to see you on every platform having these conversations. I wanna see you on the view. I wanna see you on giving To camera Hall show. I wanna see You. But You know what You know what's crazy though. And this is why I commend you.


Like what what I commend you is of of this. And, and this is why our Brother's club is a major platform for our culture and will always be, you get it when it's not cool, you get it before it go popular. You get it before it go shiny. You get it. And understand that a lot of these people don't give a fuck about that. Even though you name platforms, they don't care about that. They just want some shiny shit. You right now, Wallo come outta prison, one of the, you probably, and I'm not, I'm probably one of the greatest comebacks ever to come outta prison in life. But they not gonna get that to New Yorktown bestseller here, all that stuff. They don't understand us. And, and, and we, we control cool. But a lot of times we don't own it. So they try to get a close proximity to our coolness.


And we so much suckers. We don't be understanding that. We don't even know why when we being used out here. That's why there's a lot of shit that I see online. I be like, damn, we goofy as shit man. Can't nobody outside of us validate us But us. I'm never gonna let nobody tell me that you not cool that you not cool that outside our culture And. I'm never going let nobody give a approval of what's cool and what's not. Outside of our culture of this blackness. I love being black. I'm a die black. That's right. My family is black. So I look at us And, I say we some extraordinary people. And it's not taking that enough from any other group of people. But everybody else love self. So I'm gonna love me, right?


And, and You know And, I got some extraordinary people. That's not black, that's family, that's business. But at the end of the day, until we start loving us on all levels, we gonna be left behind. What do you think about when, when Michael Rubin was up here and said pretty much the same thing that you just said right now? Did not say that. No, no, no. But he just said, we, we hurt ourselves. He say nothing. No, he basically said our community hurts ourselves. That's what he been saying. Whole. Let me say this though. Let me say this though. Everything is about the messenger. 'cause I can't speak on behalf of You know different races. I can't do that because if they gonna be like, who the fuck is you Wallo? So that's normal. But one thing that I can say is that I seen, I everybody is speculating.


Everybody's around On that day that Meek was in that courtroom, I was in that courtroom to come to speak for Meek. Michael Rubin was in that courtroom. And when we took that break after the, the, the You know the judge was roughing meek up. I'm talking about she was like, she was roughing meek up. We went outside to the hallway and Mike looked at us and said, what's going on in here? Like this guy was really shocked. I'm like, this is being black in America. He was like, what the fuck he I'm talking about? He was personally pissed 'cause he didn't understand that they be going 'cause a lot of people just don't know. He said he Didn't realize it was two Americas. And tell that case, Listen that day he looked at, and then he attempted to walk back in the courtroom after we had the conversation. And she slapped him around and he like, what the, I can't like, because he stood up and spoke and stood up and she was like, yeah, all right.


Writing in the paper, like he went and done something. I respect Mike for that. That's right. I don't care what, no, like Mike went and done something. You know people gonna have they their opinions on people. But I'm talking about when I see a good person, I see a good person. I salute a good person. That's it. I ain't with all that other shit because I'm gonna tell you something man, to be real with you. I got a lot of people that's not black that help the shit outta me. Same. Right? Because they really, people that really believe in it, And, I ain't talking about business. I'm talking about in life people. That people that love you, love you. It's not a, it is not always gonna be a color thing. And I know we fight so much to get us together. But at the end of the day, while you spend your your your time on this planet, you better love who love you and you better figure out who love you and who got your fucking back.


Because I'm gonna tell you something, I don't know what everybody else doing out here, but I'm 45 And. I'm saying to myself, hopefully I get another 45 out here. 'cause my grandma 90. So I'm measuring it by then. My uncle James, rest in peace and him, he died. He was 93 or 94. But we got, we got a nice length in our joint. Pause. Pause. Oh, was that a pause camp? I gotta run that by Cam because I'm talking about the lift of years. I'm not saying but Oh yeah, all You say Definitely a pause. Yeah, I gotta, that's the breakdown of the Paul. But what I'm saying is, well you was a Paul's champion though. You got The more of the history You in the Guinness. But I'm gonna say this, I'm gonna say this though. I'm looking at it like I'm 45 now. There's a big chance 20 You.


know what I mean? Like 50% of my life or 30 per whatever. I'm getting outta this joint One day I can't worry about, I'm gonna be going, I gotta go And, I gotta go. Yeah. And when I go, my whole thing, I wanna be able to say I left that shit on the planet. That's why, that's why I live the life that I live. I do me, if I wanna buy something, I buy it. If I'm wanna go somewhere, I'm gonna go somewhere. I'm not living my life based off of some fear shit. Because guess what? You know how many motherfuckers in the in in the graveyard sitting there mad as shit. Like, damn, I should have got dizzy. Damn I should have went here. Damn, I should have done this. We don't do enough. We don't live enough. We don't, we don't put more positive energy out enough because I'm saying to myself, damn I gotta, I got a lot of shit to make up on. 'cause I know when You know, when I see God, I don't want it to be like, nigga, didn't I tell you nigga, you understand?


Because God get funky for people. You. know what I mean? I'm, I don't wanna be the one who be like you, you had plenty of time, nigga. Right. You know where you gotta go You. know what I mean? So it's like, at the end of the day, I just try to put the best energy possible out there to our people to let 'em know, listen man, we ain't got time. We ain't gonna be able to ever love each other. Do what you gotta do and keep it moving. But one day you gotta get the fuck up outta here. What, what Led to Ayan Levon writing the forward for this book? How'd that happen? The craziest thing in The World. So she hit me one day in the dm. I almost passed out. And this is why Acts of Faith, what we call the Purple book in jail. That was like a joint that everybody carry around in their bike pocket. They be writing their little love notes out to the girl and all like, it was a powerful everyday messaging book. So I had the purple book most of my bit.


So I'm like, when she DM me baby, I'm like, what the, I'm like, this gotta be. 'cause I'm the dude that's different than I'm not. No dude that think I'm, I'm a regular person in my world. So I don't think I'm this person that I'm starstruck when I see people, that's important in my life. If I see certain rappers, I'm starstruck. Gil got mad at me 'cause it was six in the morning. And I seen Big Daddy King in the airport. And I draw detention on him. He said, why you doing that dumb shit? 'cause King and King didn't win it Really be Barbered. I know he didn't, but fuck that king. He was a legend. I gotta announced Chuck DI seen him at the joint You know what's happening. You know what's crazy. I'm gonna tell you some deep shit. This is how I knew I was a hip hop historian. And I was a major part of hip hop. I was at Leo Corrum party and, and, and he was giving him Award City of Hope, I think.


And La and Chuck D looked over at me. He said, I said, I made it Chuck D Yeah, you understand this? Chuck D looked at me and gave me the joint light And I. And in my mind he told me fight the power. Like he knew. But he didn't say that. Chuck didn't say that right. Chuck didn't say that right. Chuck didn't say that, but, but I, but but this is, this is the thing that's crazy. Chuck didn't say that, but I felt as that and he didn't follow me on Instagram. You know, I'm not petty about that. You didn't get a chance to speak to him? No. We, we dabbed it up. But IIII was, I was, I was ready to pass out. 'cause it's Chuck d. Absolutely. So, so I couldn't get myself together. He was like going to a Michael Jackson concert. I was ready Paul pass out, but I didn't want to. So Chuck DI was like, damn, this dude's a legend.


I'm beefing with DJ Premier because DJ Premier, for him to be legend, he followed Gil and he wasn't following me. So I'm real petty about that. I'm like, Gil don't know nothing about rapping. I do. Right, right, right. Like gang You know Guru was like an uncle to me. So me and him beefing. But like I love hip hop so much. But what I'm saying is that I'm not going see no legend and don't, and don't freak out. Acknowledge Him Go crazy because up Chuck D you was the soundtrack to my, to the struggles that took place in America and yo and we didn't handle no food. We had Public Enemy and that helped us through the course. So, so when she hit me, I almost passed out. I'm laying down, I'm like, oh my God. And Yana Van Za. I'm like, she just DMed me You. know what I mean? This is like your spiritual mother. So I hit her back. But so what happened is I asked her, I mean I had told Charles, I was like, yo man, I said, Charles man.


He said, man, asked her man, you need to forward XI said, bet I'm gonna ask her. And I hit her up. She brought, she let me come to her house, made me a meal and food was delicious. Come on y'all. I didn't wanna be greedy. Right. You know what I mean? But I was like, damn, I ain't wanna ask for another plate. But it was great. What did she make? It was like these shrimps, it was just the sauce is right. It was just, it was spectacular. And, I wanted to make a doggy bag, but I ain't think that was appropriate, but whatever. But she bring me down to the house. I'm down there. She showed me so much love. Shout out to Ikea too, her manager that do thing. But like, and she showed me so much love man. And she, and she read me, she read me the four word right then and there. Wow. And then I, and then I hit up and when I hit her up, the dude for the audio, she just done it that day. Wow. And I'm talking about like, and it was based off of love and how she see me for us.


And it was everything You know One thing I wanted you to talk about before we leave, you said, you said the feeling of not being punished for doing something you knew was wrong was equivalent to your first orgasm. How long did it take for you to actually feel guilt when you, when you did something wrong? Man, it took me a while because you young and you just don't know. So it take you a while and then, then when it hit you'd just be like, damn, I did some crazy shit. You know. But it was a while. It was just a thi it was just, I, I don't know. I think I was just part of stealing an American dream. I was doing my thing. 'cause I wanted to be, you gotta stand. I'm looking at these fucking movies man. I'm looking at Ray Ola and Motherfucking Goodfellas and, and, and You know the, the part where he burning the cars up, he throwing the joint.


He said by the time I was 14 I was making more money than a, than the grownups around my neighborhood. I'm like damn, I wanted to be that. I wanted some money because we gonna be obvious.

But at the same time, you seeing Mr. John come back from work, he's a plumber or dirty and nobody's speaking to him. I'm sitting on the step watching all this shit take place. So I said damn, I gotta be a part of this shit. And the black community, the women dictate who the man wanna grow up to be based off of who they date. That's Real.

They only respected the criminals in the gang. That's right. Yeah. The fuck America. Look, listen, money and violence. Listen, do you go ask any judges, lawyers, prosecutors and all that?


What's your favorite movies? God five Us. What's your favorite series? The Sopranos. Everything gonna be, they love the successful criminals. So I grew up to try to be that. But as I grew old, I took responsibility. Say, oh yeah, I'm on some dumb shit I did wrong.
