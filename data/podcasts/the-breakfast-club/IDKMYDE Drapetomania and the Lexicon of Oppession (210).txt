Let's talk about something wild drap Romania. Now don't worry is not another WWE event is not a new crypto scam or a TikTok trend. It's actually a piece of history that's so ridiculous.


It sounds like satire Know. Back in 1851, this guy named Samuel Cartwright, he's a doctor. Mind you, comes up with this disease called Drape tar mania, and what was this illness you ask? Well, I'll share it was when enslaved black people wanted to escape. Yes, apparently wanting freedom was considered a mental disorder, but oh wait, you don't enjoy being beaten and overworked and treated like property must be something wrong with your brain.


And Dr. Cartwright wasn't just joking around. He had treatment plans. Spoiler alert, they weren't great. His cure was basically you just gotta hit 'em harder because you know, nothing says mental health care like a little violence. But D drap mania wasn't the only wild word they came up with during this time. Oh no. They had a whole lexicon of oppression. Take chattel for example. That's what they called the enslaved people. You've heard of chattel slavery. Yeah. Chattel means property like a couch or a cow. Imagine being referred to as someone's loveseat or how about the term fugitive slave? That term was for people who escaped slavery. They made it sound like these folks were robbing banks instead of, you know, trying to not be enslaved.


Then there were the slave codes, and we've discussed these in previous seasons of, I didn't know, maybe you didn't neither, but these were actually laws designed to control enslaved people. They dictated everything where you could go, who you could talk to, even whether you could learn to read like we're already still in your freedom, but let's go ahead and micromanage your existence too. Oh, here's another fun one. Manu missions. Now, these were rare because that's when an enslave decided to free someone thoughtful. Congratulations, you're free. Now go figure out life in The World that's been set up to screw you over. They also had a term, the task system, and that's where enslaved people were given daily assignments instead of just working from sun up to sundown.


Yeah, people actually thought this was progress. It's like saying good news, you only have to suffer for half the day now. So why am I telling you all this? Because words have power. Back then. They used words to dehumanize, to control, to just justify the unjustifiable, and today we still see how language shapes the way we view people and history. But here's the thing. We get to decide how we use our words now, so let's use them to lift each other up to tell the truth and to remind The World that no one should ever need a diagnosis to want their freedom. Draped Romania. A word that I didn't know. Maybe you didn't either.
