To me baby making music just like You know music that make you, that make you want to feel like you wanna have a baby. Like You know. It's basically like a sex playlist. I feel like this album is basically like what people create when they put all their music together for the sex playlist. You know, I feel like baby Making is is the, is that You know you don't have to go put a bunch of songs together. You could just really just play this album through and it's just a get you where you need to go. Did you have one before you made your own? Like when you was just on the come up, what was your sex Playlist? Playlist. Playlist. I would always play my music, honestly.


That's how I used to know if it was hard or not. Yeah. I used to post, Did call you the Pause Music. That's how I know of the music card. Like I, I was doing that shit since high school. Like I used to make mix tapes. And I used to, you feel me? Have Girls in the Spot or whatever. And then I would do whatever we doing, but I would have the music on. That's when I know like, oh this shit really hard or it's not. So if the woman not into it, I know The music game. Blame on music. Yeah. I'll be like, the music ain't it Man, this probably was you.

She going to feel on you. She going to music.


Make 'em do something different. Yeah, yeah. You know what I'm saying? So I used to just be like, 'cause I know I'm gonna be on Point, You know I'm I'm, I'm him. So, oh wow. So it's like the music was always just a extra, but like I say, when I was young, I remember like my first mix tape, I remember playing it You, know what I'm saying? And I. Remember Girls You know being with me, whatever. I remember being like in my twenties and making music and just You. know what I'm saying? Being like, okay, this sound like a sex song. And I know. Now You know from where I'm at with it now. Just I know what this, what this do for me and mine You. know what I'm saying? So it's like I know like You know. I know it's, I know it's what it what it is. It is what it need to be. That's the first time I heard that. 'cause most times you hear people say, I got the shit in the script club. I played in the script club or the club before a dj.


Yeah. That's It makes sense. That's how, that's how we know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know. It's like a tester like You. know what I'm saying? Like I still do that to this day. Like go to the club, play a record. If don't nobody move you like eh, this might not be it. But if they move, but it's difficult for RB sometimes though, depending on the mood bro. Facts. Facts. You gotta go to certain spots where they playing that You. know what I'm saying? If you go to certain RB spots where they playing it and you put it on and it's like, okay, they, they rocking with it. But You know if you going into an all rap club and you put on some RB of course it's probably be hard to move them. 'cause that ain't what they in there for You. know what I'm saying?

Fat decade Of life talk that talk so that you already know what's up with me. So when did You know it was time? Like how did you, when did you decide like is was because you're 30 now? I think I'm just going with God and emotion You. know what I'm saying? Honestly, that's honestly my, my answer. Like You know what I'm saying? I had a bunch of different answers. But now just waking up today and just seeing like You know, just everything. Like You know. I just think like I'm just going what God say You know what I'm saying?


Like I think, I think I know with men, like it is always like a time. 'cause I know Vy, you married, right? Yes sir. Yeah. 'cause I remember being on the road with you, like you act like a married guy You. know what I'm saying? It is dope though. You know What is this? We went on the tour together with real mic You, know what I'm saying? But Handle His business. Get on the stage, get off and just do what he do You. know what I'm saying? I remember watching that You. know what I'm saying? Like, dang LeBron's still cool You. know what I'm saying? Nah, OG gotta tell you the, the rest of the story. I don. See I don't know the if you in your fourth decade, according to Jeff Math, then NB and his six. So what happened on the fourth? No, tell about Yeah, tell him about the second and third decade. Third decade.


Third decade. Yeah. But, but Anyway. He Was with me though. He was with me though. Yeah. I wasn't never with him. Yes, he was with me. Don't don. You thought that. But I mean now I, I was just using Bru for example. 'cause I had started seeing like different dudes in the game. Like, I'm like, okay bro. Married bro, married bro, married, Brumar, different things. And, I. Just think for me, like I had already, I'm, I've, I've already had like a couple like experiences with women and different things like that. So I, I think for me it's like okay, I'm not missing nothing on that side. That's right. You know. She make me feel good. You You know what I'm saying? So I be like, how I live my life is I don't want to have no regrets in my life. You know what I'm saying? I want to like, do everything that I know I'm supposed to be doing. Like I know marriage is a part of life. You know. So I don't want to keep guessing. Like, okay, she gonna be the one.


She gonna be the one. I'm just taking a chance. Like I said, I'm just going with God. I think she's it. She make me feel whole. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? She make me want to be better than I was before. But damn. Are you talking like this in the album? You singing like this? I'm talking about Yeah. A little bit. Sunrise service. A little bit. Yeah. But You know it's pretty much yeah. You gonna love the album though? 'cause it's, it feels like, like what we talked about in the beginning, honestly, it just feels like a, it don't feel like a sex place. It just feel like good music that'll make you want to like do whatever it is that you're trying to do. I think it's just a feel a feel good album. Yeah. Well I do wanna salute you for learning early with so many of us men. Learn late man. Yeah. For surely. Now you got a good woman. Act like it. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And I promise you the way you gonna see your life.


Just prospering ways you can't even imagine when you like really pour into a good woman. And I, good woman pour into You. I've been seeing it, bro. My whole life been different. You know what I'm saying? Like, I, I, my whole year have been different You. know what I'm saying? Like I just really been acknowledging it and seeing it like, okay, this what they be talking about when it's like this. And then it's just, it's a blessing honestly. You know it's a blessing when a good woman come into your life. That's right. And then You know, you also have to make adjustments when a good woman come into your life too. Because it's like it wake up everybody else that's You. know what Im saying in your family You know what I'm saying? And that could be difficult too. You know what I'm saying? Like You know what I'm saying? That could be difficult when your family used to operate a certain way, then this person come in and it's like you happy.


But it's still like something that's just, that just don't be all the way there. And, I think that's the phase that I'm going through now. Like You know Air. Like it is just like trying to have the whole family dynamic as one You know what I'm saying? I think that's tough too. Well your family is also changing now because you got your woman, you got your child Baby. Exactly. And I'm, and I'm and I'm going from being the hou the head of that home to the head of this one. That's right. And You know that's different when you lead a nest a little bit You know what I'm saying? It's like, it's just a little different. So I think that's kind of like the biggest thing, the most difficult thing that I'm dealing with now. You know Any pressure though because you can't You know. You can't show us something that she hasn't seen already. As far As, you mean any pressure on as far as what?


As, as being You know her daddy rich man. Her, her daddy got brand, her family got break. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I think, is there any pressure? I think when it come like that, bro, the only way I could feel less than is if she ever made me feel less than You. know what I'm saying? I'm the type of dude where I don't care what you got You. know what I'm saying? Because I'm a hustler You. know what I'm saying? Like I'm naturally a hustler. Like I'm from that You. know what I'm saying? So it's like, I I I, it's like I get inspired when, when people got more than me. Especially if you cool You. know what I'm saying? I'm, I'm gonna really ask you how to do it. That's just how I am. I'm not one of them. I'm not gonna be guessing like Charlamagne got something going on. Like, bro, how you do that? You feel me? I ain't finna be not asking. Right. You know what I'm saying? So it's like with me, she gonna make me feel like I'm less than them You know what I'm saying? Like, so it's like I don't feel like that.


But if I ever did feel like that I don't think I'd be speaking as as highly of her as I as I am. And how did Y'all meet? We met through Patman Jones. Mm. You feel me? Patman Jones You know my, that's like my big brother. He had, he called me one day FaceTimed me in like 2021 and he, he was in Jamaica with Deandre and her family. They You know they, they they, they been tight Deion Sanders, like his God pops or whatever. And he called me and he was like, bro, I'm out here with Deandre Sanders. I'm like Bro, who is that?

I'm so what about I, I heard you mention it quite a few times, your documentary. What, what is Call Me Queer about Call Me Queer is just a story about my whole life.


You just see my whole story. I feel like, like how NBA, when we go on the road and people be singing my records and people don't really gimme the respect in real life. This documentary should sum all of it up. This documentary should tell people why I feel like I'm the king of RB of my generation. I'm literally just showing you everything. Like we showed it last night in Atlanta and people really got tears in their eyes. Mm. Watching that. And it is just like, it make me feel good because like I, I worked so hard to get to where I am You know what I'm saying? Like I worked so hard. Like that's why I hate the fact that people play with me. But my mama always told me, she was like, man, when you get a real like situation when different things like You know when people really respect your relationships and people start to like respect you as a man. I feel like all the jokes will change with you on your music You.


know what I'm saying? But like I said, when I said I was a king of RB, I know that just shook the room up with people. And it is like You know they never put me on none of the king of RB tours. They went on You. know what I'm saying? They never put me on none of the shows.

Like it's like, and at one point everybody loves you and then they hate the same thing.


And that was the same way with me. I remember I was the most loved little child, kid star when I came out. But I wouldn't. But I would come places like The, Breakfast, Club. Not saying Charlemagne, but I would walk past Charlamagne or something. He'd be like, I try to dab his hand and be like, I might look at him and be like, who that?

I remember he tried to act like he didn't know who I was. That's what sparked the king. That's what really sparked me for real. And I. Remember I was like, this nigga acting like he don't know who I am. So I remember I got on the internet like man I'm, I'm tough. I'm harder than all these niggas except for Chris Brown. You feel me? Then I remember Tory adding me like something And I was like, nigga, I thought you didn't know who I was. Yeah. Then that's when we end up getting cool going on tour. 'cause he knew like, okay this nigga right here. He see the bullshit. You ever fuck with him? Like, hey man, your head getting a little thin up top to Yeah. Nah, I was always a nigga. I was on FaceTime with Tory when he got the hair transplant. He was at the doctor's Office. Yeah. When he was getting surgery, nigga bleeding and shit.

know what I'm saying? Like you, you should rock with Jacquees Ex. Like that'd be dope. They didn't tell Her that. And it was kind of confusing 'cause that's how shit had came up too. You know doing that, like doing covers before she actually blew As well. Yeah. But, but You know when you making in this game and you get around people that done had success before you, you tend to listen to him and You, know what I'm saying? She like, it was, that shit was crazy. Me and Musta got an argument behind that shit and everything. Mm. But we cool now me and Musta got in a full blown argument about Redoing the song. About about the trip. Shit. That's crazy. That nigga called my phone on FaceTime. I remember going crazy. I remember I had to tell that nigga like man you gotta calm down. But we got cool You know. So now we playing. I remember we had planned to do some work but the work never happened. I don't know if it was Ka You, know what I'm saying? But I know we had said that we was gonna work You know I'm all about your word.


You spoke, you spoke to Thug since he been on. I talked to Dolly though. And I talked to his mama. But like I say, thug is my brother. Like his nieces and stuff was with us the whole time. He was locked up You. know what I'm saying? Like my nieces, his nieces go to the same school with all the graduation. They'd be at my house. If I call his sister on FaceTime, my little cousin might be in the front seat. You. know what I'm saying? It's like that. I called him the other day. They say he was in the shower. The nigga probably was standing right there by the phone. He probably ain't want to talk You. know what I'm saying? Why? Why wouldn't you wanna talk? He probably, That nigga just came home and, And then imagine how many people Calling the phone like You, know what I'm saying? And then me and Bro close for real. Like it is like I know, I know bro. Probably just gonna fuck around and sin for me You. know what I'm saying? Like, hey bro, y'all get cool out here. That's how he is. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I'm gonna go in there and see him and we gonna talk about everything though.


Went through a lot. When he was locked up, did You talk to him while he was locked up? Did you send him Any? Nope. I talked to his mama. No. And You know what one of my people was on the inside like You know as far as like You know keeping me posted with him and stuff like that. But I, one thing that I had started regretting 'cause I was gonna go to the court, You know how different people were showing up to the courtroom. Yeah the courtroom. But I was like, nah, I'm not going to the courtroom You. know what I'm saying? Because I just didn't think it'd be smart You. know what I'm saying? For me to just go to the courtroom. So when I didn't write him a letter, I was just like dang. I know, I know Thug in there like read these letters like why the hell I ain't just write him a letter because I know he the type of person where everybody that wrote him a letter he going that that probably meant something to him. Sure. But then I also thought about, well okay, even though I didn't write the letter, I know he's still hearing that his nieces, them still like feeling good.


Like they see Jacquees, Ex like You know what I'm saying? Like he treat 'em good, like they get to do this and that You know what I'm saying? I know he hear that. I know that make him feel good like okay he doing that cool You. know what I'm saying? And then I know like me and his sister them his mama them so tight. I talked to his mama like soon as he got out you feel? But I was talking to his mama during the whole thing too You. know what I'm saying? So like them that that's my family thug. I'm gonna tell you, like anybody tell you, I knew he was coming home because I knew his spirit. Like you feel me? Like Thug. The type of person where it's like he another person where people are judged until they meet him. Then when people meet Thug, they got a whole nother opinion about him. They be like, boy I love Thug You. know what I'm saying? 'cause you could feel the type of person he is. He really is a great person.


And that's what the Lord know. That's why I knew he was coming home. I knew it was just a lesson in it for him. I knew God just didn't want everybody around him no more You. know what I'm saying? Because he's a giver too. You. know what I'm saying? Like he's a strong giver. I done been with Thug from the beginning You. know what I'm saying? Like I was with Breath from the, from day one, like literally You. know what I'm saying? Like shit, I know people don't know You. know what I'm saying? So that's why I don, like when he was holding The city Down, now I was with Thug from day one. I'd been with Thug since 2013, 14 You. know what I'm saying? 2024. So basically God was using Woody.

So it's like when KO passed, I instantly thought about Thug though. I ain't gonna cap You. know what I'm saying? I thought about Thug And. I was just like, damn. Like I, I thought I started thinking about all the conversations me and Birmingham used to have when I was like 21 You. know what I'm saying? And. I. Remember when Rich Gang broke up? Me and Stunner used to talk so much about the plans that we had and different things like that.


You know and a lot of things that happened You know what I'm saying? Stunner used to like say like Man we need to do this so this don't happen, this don't happen. Like we got a chance to be the biggest in The, World You. know what I'm saying? Like folks don't even know like the Rich Gang tour. Like when, when everybody was on the road, niggas was getting a lot of money early. It wasn't even no hits out for Real Lifestyle was the only song really out. But it was a lot of bread on the table. But it was a lot of artists too. You know what I'm saying? It was me, Soulja Boy, rich mc, corn Thug. Everybody was on that that stage. But I just remember just thinking back like when Quan died, bro, I remember I went to the funeral. I remember I got on my knee and prayed in front of him. You dig what I'm saying? Because I was just like, damn, like Quan like You know when you see somebody up there that You know you dig what I'm saying?


Like you like, like you like I know this nigga. I just had talked to Quan 'cause Bucky had called me Deiondra brother. They, they wanted him to come out to Colorado. Coach Prime wanted him to come to Colorado. So I called Quan like, Hey bro, Colt wants you to come out there to Colorado. I hadn't talked to Quan in a minute though. You know what I'm saying? But I know I'm his brother. So I know I can always call him. I know he gonna answer no matter what. You, know what I'm saying? And, I. Remember I called him, he like qui bro, I'm proud of you bro.

The daddy, you feel what I'm saying? And, I was just like when he passed, it also made me think like, man, like I even want to take more control of my life You.


Know what I'm saying? Like I want to take more control of my life because the way that Quorum went out, it should teach everybody a lesson. You know it's lessons that we still being taught by the greatest people in The World. You dig what I'm saying? I'm like damn. Like You know just sitting up there. Just like with Quan, it's just like Quan was the heartbeat of his family You. know what I'm saying? And me and Quan kind of like came up the same way. We both from the east side of Atlanta. We both like, we not street niggas You know what I'm saying? But it's like we from the hood but we not street niggas. Yeah, you dig what I'm saying?

All the Stu and Stu asked me one day like Nephew, why everybody don't why like I helped everybody. Like why you feel me?

Because for one, I grew up on 'em for two, we formed a real relationship and for three like Stunner made me a household name You. know what I'm saying? And I'm super thankful for Slim and Stunner. 'cause I told a nigga the other day, I'm like bro, no matter how mad I get with Stunner or what Stunner still put my albums out bro.


Like, like Stunner ain't holding this nuts on me ever. You know what I'm saying? So I'm like bro, I ain't can't be, can't nobody get in my head by my UNC period You. know what I'm saying?

Like if stun, if one of my homeboys Stunner don't like, he call me like, Hey get a nigga from around you.


I don't give a fuck what you say. Nigga can't come back around me You know what I'm saying? Like shit like that. And it's like, it was, it is deeper than rap. I tell everybody like bro, if I would have signed with any other label, I wouldn't be Jacquees Ex who I am. 'cause I done had cold moments in the game You. know what I'm saying? One thing about cash money, what Stunner don't do is leave you in the cold. Mm. You feel me? He don't leave you in the cold like Stunner get in the cold with you. You feel me? And that's what I always respect. Respected by Unc like, like most labels would be like, oh this nigga ain't doing shit. Drop him don't spend no more money on the nigga. He keep spending the bad, he keep doing shit. And that's, we keep rolling. He just keep the faith going. You know, even when Stu get upset with me, he still make sure my shit come out You. know what I'm saying?


So it is like he must business. Yeah, it is like he handled a business. He might be mad at me about some other shit that I ain't listened to him on, on some nephew shit. You feel me? But besides that, he, he putting out my shit and you tripping off Louisiana tickets? Hell yeah. Come on man. He wanted to go shit You. know what I wanted to ask you too about when you, when you proposed, did you, did you hit up Dion first because You know that's a respectful thing to do. You gotta call the Pops first. Oh yeah. I hit up Dion, but I forgot. Tell you I Stunner, the reason was one of the biggest reason I got married. I forgot to say that. When we went to Essence Fest, I hadn't seen Stun in a long time. So this the first time UNC seen me since I had been not drinking and stuff. You feel me? Because You know during that time a lot of people had done got like, man You know they would be upset with you You. know what I'm saying?


So when Stunner seen me, he like, boy, you look good boy. You feel me? First thing he told me, like Nephew, you look good. But he like, you need to marry her, you feel me? He like, I'm dead ass. Like, You know I don't even talk like that. That's what he said. He like, he like You know I don't even say shit like this. He like, but you need to marry her bro. Like she done made you better. He like this the best I ever seen you look God damn you focused. You need to marry her like she pregnant. You need to marry her. You feel me? He like, you don't need to waste no time. So when he said that, I just was like, damn. So I, I thought about Dion too. I'm like, okay. So I called him, called Dion, called Dion with his pastor You. know what I'm saying? Dion talked to me You. know what I'm saying? He gave me a lot of game stuff that I never forget.


Mm. You know what I'm saying? Told me stuff that I needed to hear You, know what I'm saying? He kept it, he kept it real with me. It's like he wasn't talking to me like a little boy. That's clueless You know what I'm saying? He talking to me like a man, like he was talking to me like a man that's like, like, like he's been me before You. know what I'm saying? So it was like very honorable for me. You know what I'm saying? And I. I took it all in and he basically gave me his, his blessing. Yeah. I went and bought the ring right after that. And that's amazing. And and remember when you said you want us to ask you some more shit? So I wanted to ask you this more specifically 'cause we went past it a little quick. That that had to be sacred for you. Having a baby is sacred for you. Having a baby is sacred for a woman too.


Especially when it's y'all first. And that's news that y'all wanna put out. But when Dreezy put it out there first, what was your initial reaction? And then what was Deandre too? Because she had told us I was, that's how we found out Y all was pregnant. I was From Dreezy. I was, I was, I was high. And I'm gonna tell you like the reason I did it, And I, And I know that I, I'm probably wrong or was wrong of the way I was thinking because of course as me, we grew up, we learn. I thought that I owed her something to tell her because I had been with her for so long. Mm. You know what I'm saying? So I was like, okay. As a friend, You know as a respectful dude You. know what I'm saying? I was with Dre for a long time. Let me tell her that I'm having a baby before she just found out through The. World. Okay. So you act, you told Dre Dreezy, I know Deandre that you was going tell Dreezy?


Nah, nah, I told you just told, I told Dreezy like Yeah, I was like, look, I'm having a baby You. know what I'm saying? I was like Deandre having a baby You know I wanted G to respect, to let You know. Like I feel like we had that type of relationship where I could let you like You know. I don't want you to be blinded where you embarrassed or You. know what I'm saying? These type of things You know what I'm saying? But she went out and put it out You. know what I'm saying? She said you were begging to get her pregnant too. I was, I was so lost, bro. Like I would tell you the truth bro. I was one of them niggas, like I said, I wanted my cake and eat it too. And I was drinking. So You know when you drinking you're not making the proper dec Decision. And she said you sent draws to her House. What your face on? Nah bro. I didn't send no draws. I don Face on. Yeah, I didn't send no draw, Put it in just, It was probably something sent to me.


But I didn't get, I didn't put my face on nothing. Oh, okay. You know what I'm Saying? You didn't send no underwear? Nah, I don't got the time to do all that, bro. No. Alright. Well did you allegedly send Under? No, I didn't send, no, I didn't send no underwear though. I ain't send no underwear. You feel me? If something was sent to me, I don't know. Do you own Underwear with your face on it? No. Okay. No, no, no. But nah. Did they ever, did they ever talk? Did Drea did, did Deree ever talk? Did they talked? They talked. They talked. Yeah, they talked. I don't know if it was the best conversation, but I think they talked to the point where they don't have to talk again. Yeah. Yeah. So Dre, So Dre V wasn't lying when she said you was trying to get her, you was hitting her up saying you wanna get her pregnant. She had texts? Yes.


Yeah. Yeah. She had a text message. I think the text is the Proof. And he had said he always wanted kids. You, you said you always wanted kids. You always wanted a family. Yeah, I wanted a family. And. I. Think And I. Think like I said, like with me, I'm, I was 28, 29 You. know what I'm saying? I'm 30 now You. know what I'm saying? I was, sometimes I'm man feel like a child can solve all his problems too. Sometimes a man will feel like, man, if we had this baby, like that's gonna solve all our problems. Like that's the answer we need. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's Women that think like that Too. And that's what I was thinking. You know what I'm saying? Like that's what I was thinking. You know, when I was in that mode, I was thinking like, man, maybe if me, Andre have a baby, like You know, this was before all Deandre stuff. How I was thinking. I was like, man, if we have a baby You know all our problems will be fixed You.


know what I'm saying? Like You know what I'm saying? And she would always tell me like, I don't want a kid, I don't want a kid You. know what I'm saying? So when I had my baby with, when Deandre got pregnant, I'm like, man, this gotta be God. You feel what I'm saying? Like, I've been with Dre for years. She never got pregnant You. know what I'm saying? I was with her from, I was 23 to now You. know what I'm saying? Like, she never got pregnant. So I was just like, Oh wow. That was a six year relationship. Damn. Yeah. That shit was long as fuck. Yeah. But You still love her. I got love for her. I'm not in love with her. I always have love for her. I think anybody that's been with a person that say they got no love for 'em at all is just like a terrible person. You know what I'm saying? It's like, damn, I wouldn't let her get hit by a car. And I push her out in the street. I Was Say, you can't You. know what I'm saying?


If I, If I could push out the street, I would You know. I let, I'm not let hit a car. Like what I'm saying though. But nah, like I, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so in love with where I am now. I feel so confident to talk about my past. Yeah. I can tell You know what I'm saying? Like I can, I can sit up here and talk about my past because I'm not even saying nothing that's, that's harmful to Dreezy. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, I got respect for her. Like I think she one of the dopest rappers out. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Well, she definitely cold. Yeah. She superpower. Gigi wrote one of my records on my album. Mm Oh, on the, on Baby Making the last one, the last album I dropped. So The one that from 2022? Yeah, that sincerely. Was it Ly for you? Yeah, she wrote Start Over. Okay. Okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. We had to do that. It is one of the, the healthier ones. I I I know I read, tell me if I'm wrong, but I read you didn't have a relationship with your biological father. True. So how did that impact how you parent now? Well, I tell, I, I just started telling people that, 'cause for a long time I was like, I don't know if I was embarrassed about that or not. I don't think I was embarrassed. I just didn't want niggas to know my business You. know what I'm saying? Like, I think that's more so how I was like, you gotta think like none of my friends ever knew that about me growing up ever till now what I saying the interview.


Damn. You feel me? Never like, because I was just like, I ain't telling niggas that. Like I don't want to give niggas no reason to look down on me You. know what I'm saying? Like, I ain't giving no nigga a reason to look down on me. I keep everything internal You know what I'm saying? And, but my dad that raised me, his name's Steve You. know what I'm saying? That's my little sister dad. But that's my daddy like You know what I'm saying? Like, the nigga been with me since I was born You. know what I'm saying? So it's like, I would feel like I'm doing him wrong to just say another nigga, my daddy. You feel me? So it's like my biological father, I don't have a relationship with him. I went down to see him in Mississippi once for like a family reunion. And. I. Remember? He came here once. But how I'm gonna do it with my son is like, well my dad taught me Steve, I'm gonna teach my son the same thing.


Like my daddy was lit. You feel me? I got two brothers on my daddy's side, Steve and Stefan. They would always come down to summer. But like I say, my mama really played both roles though. You know. So with me, I just know I'm gonna teach my son like how to love his family, how to be a standup guy. I'm gonna teach him by God early You. know what I'm saying? And just how to be responsible and just how to look out for the family. I'm teaching that family is very important. You know what I'm saying? Family is very, very important. I want to, I want him to have a real family dynamic. Like You know. I believe that I'm changing the dynamics of Deandre's family. Right. You know because my family, we grew up like, and not saying they diff they they didn't. But the love that we grew up with was kind of different You. know what I'm saying? It's like we di it was just a different type of love.


Like all love is different. Every household is different like You. know what I'm saying? You might have grew up with love in your household. We might have grew up with love in our household, but it could, it could have been different. Love. Like your daddy could have told, showed, showed you tough love. My mama could have told me she loved me every day. Literally You know what I'm saying? That shit have changed a nigga that'd changed people You. know what I'm saying? So it's like I believe that what I'm doing is I'm building a great thing. Like I told you, it's difficult to men, families, You know what I'm saying? Because you, you used to two different things. But I think now it's like the biggest thing I'm doing now is just like men and the family, And, I think that You know it's, it's, it's difficult but it's worth it. You know what I'm saying? It's tough, but it's worth it.


But it's like the toughest shit ever. But it's worth it. But it's worth it. But it's worth it. You know And. I'm just in it. I'm in it. 'cause I, I want him to have, I want him to have like everything I did and everything I did and everything I had and more You, know what I'm saying? Like he gonna be blessed because he gonna, like, my mom was so lit to me, You, know what I'm saying? Like lit like bro, like whenever my mama still to this day, like whenever my mama get in the pool or do anything or just do activities with us, that shit turned me up You. know what I'm saying? Like, like for Thanksgiving, I wasn't with my mama them, I was with Deandre mom and them. But I got on the internet, And I seen my mama jumping in the pool and shit. I'm like, man, I wish I was down there You. know what I'm saying? Because I'm like, that's when I know we turned.


Yeah. Yeah. You feel me? So I had that type of stuff growing up. We had it from my mama. Got you. Get what I'm saying? So it's like now my son to get to know like, man, my mama lit and my daddy absolutely You know what I'm like, I don't just gotta look for my mama to be lit with shit. It is like my daddy turned too. So it's like that's what he gonna get to have. So I'm just excited about his life and got got his grandfather, he got some amazing uncles like Shado, Shiloh and Bucky. Like they, they great guys too. Like not only am am I a great example, but he also got them. I think that's super dope You know what I'm saying?

I want my my son to grow with his cousins, like brothers and sisters.


You get what I'm saying? Like that's just all we know. But I believe that that's a new dynamic that I'm bringing into her family. You know that I, that I, that I, that I believe will be great because at the end of the day, that's how we all started anyway. Everybody started on the floor on the pallet with your cousin You. know what I'm saying? Or if you didn't, you probably didn't. But if you didn't, I think you should live this life.
