If you guys ever go to Chicago and you go to a Welcome to the farm and you meet a fellow named Rudy Fuck, you Rudy suck my left lip first to fuck off. Sorry. I need to really get that outta there. I feel like a burden has been lifted off of me. But anyhow, this man allegedly slept with me while I was doing business for this club just in appearance.


I never once left anybody's eye contact to go sleep with this man. And then I just happened to run across an investor that works with people I work with and he showed some messages from Rudy saying he slept with me. And I was like, first off this motherfucker was up to my nose. Like he was that toss where to Jesus Rudy Short man syndrome is so upsetting. No he is not. But you know when we were there we wanted them to have fun too. Yeah. Because like that's the whole point of work. For sure. It's supposed to be fun. Yeah. So we included like all the bottle girls and stuff. We were like, yeah, come out here and dance with us, you know, whatever. After everybody left. 'cause there wasn't anybody to like attack us, you know? So I was like, eh, come out here and have fun.

I'm gonna Find it. I'm not very good At that shit. I'm not gonna tell you her fucking social security number, her middle name, where she lives, her parents' middle names, you know? Yeah. Like girls are good at that shit. Yeah. I feel like more girls should tap into that little crazy side. Yeah. Make him swallow an air tag. What's it gonna be? Make him swallow an air tag. But anyhow, to sum that up, Fuck you Rudy. Fair enough girl. Fair enough. I'm trying to think of my craziest night out since everything has happened. Katie, do you remember anything crazy?

I took a shit on the plane on the way here and it was Oh. no, The fucking plane. Yeah, it was a plane shit. So painful. And it was, it was bad because it was at the time of the flight where a lot of people had to go to the bathroom and there was like a line when it came out and I was like, This is so embarrassing because everybody knows on this plane what I was doing in there. Who did you fly? Yeah, Southwest. Okay, wait, you didn't finish your story. HALIEY got on. Oh my god, I'm sorry. So we go to the box. Okay.

So I was like a little mini celebrity walking around there and the girl at the front, she like knew I was coming in and so she gave us like the table at the front and like all the champagne and all these dancers coming around and it was like this whole big celebration. Right? And we'd already been drinking at dinner and some like London influencers came over, random people started coming over and like an hour in, we had taken so many shots, so many glasses of champagne. There was a guy on stage literally shitting and eating it. There was like no, the craziest stuff happens at this club. You do not understand. And I was so drunk, I'd also just smoked a joint and it was like weird boof London weed.

I just glitched glitch. I'm on so little sleep right now. That's okay. Also it makes me really happy making people mad about what I wear. Like one of my favorite comments to get is people being like, you skank. You skank, you're a slut. Country music hates you 'cause you're such a slut. And I'm like, no they actually fucking love my ass. Cheeks hanging out. So do Though though. Suck that. Tell my billboard charting song to gobble my cock. Like you know. Has anyone been like not open arms to you in the country?


Music industry? I think the hardest win over has been fans, honestly. Like I have either fans fucking love me or they fucking hate me and they can't, they like, they hate that I'm in country. But it's good 'cause it fuel. Right? And I feel like you understand that they're mad that I'm pop country. A lot of like down the middle bro. Country fans are like, fuck off, you're not country. That's country as well. Yeah. And I'm like, well cool. I make pop music. That's country. Yeah, I make country music that's pop. Like it's doesn't really fucking matter. There's good music and there's bad music. If you don't like it, that's so fine, but just shut the fuck up. Yeah. And that's why like the ward last night felt really fucking good Because it was like a, I eat my dick, you know?

I couldn't tell you the last young girl I know that has made it in like the country industry. Yeah, it's hard. And you're new to it. It's hard. Yeah. So I'm like, I'm kind of rooting for you, you know. Thanks. Thanks. It felt, it felt good. I mean the country industry has been so kind to me. Like seriously all like the outlets and labels and publishers and like people just in the industry. I don't know. I feel like they, they really fuck with my songwriting and me as a person. And so they just like have been really kind. But the fans have been really hard.


It's funny, like the fans have been the really hard part about this. That's kind of the same deal with me. Like all the celebrities I've met, they're the nicest people you could ever meet. They're always just rooting for you. Now you get to the fans, they're like, Fuck, you cock looking bitch. And I'm like, And you're like, holy shit.

Like we look at these people being like, you're a nobody. You're nobody. I'm never gonna meet you. This doesn't affect my life at all. Yeah. But, that one comment gets our attention so much more than the millions being like, you're so cool, you're so pretty. I love your music. All this stuff. I'm bad about that too. You know, it sucks.

How'd you lose that? He fucking fumbled. But also him and Gwyn are really cute. Yeah. Sometimes love doesn't work out for the right reason and they're both remarried and they seem really happy. So Miranda's remarrying. Yeah. Holy shit. You go Girl. Yeah. And he's really cute. Yeah. So cute. Blake? Yes, I would say so. I'm gonna give you a clap. My girl. It was Taylor Swift. Okay.

I don't really listen to it. There was one that I really like. It's all too well the 10 minute version. Yeah, it's Red. I fucking All Love Red. My favorite Album maybe of all time. But other Than that I haven't listened to her new music. Mm. I think that her songwriting is what stands her out as an artist. She's such a good fucking songwriter. It's, I'm so surprised she owns it now too though. Yeah, It's so awesome. And I think like it's cool seeing how it's like developed over the years. Like her early stuff was so youthful on her and now it's more like mature and like she's in her thirties and stuff and What she wants. Exactly. I think it's really cool that she stayed true. That's, Oh, I did have a bone to pick with you actually. Who do you think I had a bone to pick with you last night while I was watching tv? What? So you said the MOTHER OF. COUNTRY was Shana Shania Twain.


Shania Twain. Yes. I beg to differ. Well Dolly is the MOTHER. OF COUNTRY. I Beg to differ. Who do You think Reba McIntyre. Okay. I'm a Reba girl. Okay. That's so valid. Love me Samantha. I feel like picking one mother is so not fair. I feel like there's like, They've added things to the pot to make country what it is. There's multiple. Yes. I feel like there's multiple, I think We were five mothers. Maybe we could agree on Reba, Dolly, Shania. A hundred percent. Yes. Let's see who else I would even go Miranda. I think Miranda and Carrie. Underwood and Carrie. I could not agree more with that list. I like that. That's a good list. They're mothers. Do you have anyone to add? I think y'all covered it Actually. That's like, yeah, that's my shit right there. Because it goes from like old, you know, older generation to like A little bit newer to Like Yeah, a little newer but not too newer but not too new.


But like Miranda, none the shit I was and Carrie were like the bad asses of like our parents' generation, you know? I feel like They're like, you got like a good one then you got like a badass one. Yeah. Like Miranda's a badass one does not give a fuck. Then carrie's like the little sweetheart Carrie's a Sweetie. But also she's a spicy side. Like before he cheats was kind of what I had in my head when I was writing Austen because I was like little Red Wagon and before he cheats were like the two songs of like, I need my fucking revenge song. I was so pissed. Really? I like kerosene. I'm giving up on Little, Little Red Wagon has so much attitude. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. No, don't, don't. You Can't ride in my little web wagon. Yeah.
