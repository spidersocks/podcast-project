So I, I was kind of the, the queen of the Tom boys I was kind of ruling the school. It was fifth grade and I had all my buddies. I was kind of calling the shots. And then one day in walks Brianna from the city and I knew my rain was over.


So I found something I didn't like about her and that was her flannel. And I told everyone, fuck this girl in the flannel. We're not gonna be fucking with her. We're not gonna be, we're not gonna be entertaining that. And I tried to turn everyone against staring. It kinda was the opposite way. It was so fucked. I'm like ready to make all these new friends. I have my flannel on I was so excited about it. And then I go to the school yard and at fucking recess, grace is staring across like across the schooly yard at me like this. and she like, she had double D titties already. She was already hit puberty so young. Like they were already like, I thought she was the principal or something. I'm like, what the F? Is she gonna fucking kill me? And then I was like, why doesn't this girl like me? And they were like, she doesn't like your flannel.


I was like, that's mean. So yeah, I'm gonna steal all your friends. So what I learned from that, don't wear a flannel to school. Yeah. Don't get targeted School. Yeah. I dunno what it was. I just had to look for something I didn't like. And I was like, I guess I don't really like our flannel that much. You wear flannels? Flannel? What's that? You wear flannels? I haven't rocked one ever since. Just to, you know, stay loyal to I word. You gotta stand on business right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've only seen you flannel like twice.

And now you guys, I feel like haven't separated since everything blew up with the video. We haven't. We're not going to either. Yeah. I can't do anything by myself. That's fair. Weeds were the same way. When we first started, I said, you're coming. And we never stopped. So Wait, were you in school? Yeah. So it was, it was 2020. So I was gonna take a semester off. Yeah. And I was like that day I was gonna buy a car. 'cause I was like saving all summer to buy a car.


And it was a stick shift. And I cried. You Can't drive stick shift. I can't, can't I fucking hate stick shift. It's, it, it's, it actually makes me upset. Anyways, it was, when I got there, it was a stick shift and I was just sat there and while the, while my dad wrote it, he's like, I'll come teach you how to do it. I don't know why I'm telling that part. But anyways, I was, I was gonna buy, call a car that day. I called him. Did you really call him? I called him. Okay. All right. I got this thing with my dad. She always has to tell me to call him. 'cause we, you know, we don't really get along anyways. Yes. I'm not, we need Anything. I know dude. Well anyways, I didn't buy the car that day, but thank God because Breonna called me and she said, do you wanna move New York with me? And I said absolutely. I just like, without even thinking, I was like, yeah, I got nothing going On. So you just packed your shit up and was like, Like we, we like realistically planned a day that we were both gonna move at the same time.


But yeah, like for the most part Hedges we dropped outta school. Where You originally from? We're both from Boston. We moved, well I moved for Barstool. Oh. And then Grace also moved and then she started working for Barsol too. Barstool is a Bars stool's down the street. It's down the street. Yeah. I told after. Yeah, it's on Seventh Ave. And then you go see Dave. Yeah. Me and him need to have a nice chat. Yeah. He didn't have too many lovely words about you. No. He said something about who cares what I have to say. Excuse me Dave, You tell him. Excuse me Dave. Who cares what You have to say Dave? Yeah, exactly. Dave. I do. I actually do. He he, he, he writes my checks. Oh, he writes my checks. So you don't need care what he says.


I care immensely what he has to say. I'm telling what he says. But fair. I understand. I'm just saying I want it on record. I care what he has to say. I think we got off on the wrong foot when you asked me if I'd give him the hawk or no. And I said no. I told you he Was gonna come for your about that. It's just, it's nothing personal. He's just older. I don't look at him like that. Yeah. I never said he was a terrible person. No, no, no. But now I'm saying kiss my ass Dave. Now I, I'm saying now babe. See what? See what happened DP man, see what happened. And like the Donald Trump, he doesn't care. Everyone was like shitting on her. They was like, oh she won't suck. Donald Trump's dick. She hates him like it's not, I was like, you tweet that just because you said no Hawk like what? Yeah, like it is nothing against them.


I don't guess. It's just they're old men. I don't wanna spit on their dick. You know. That's the only fucking catch with it. That's it. I don't think anyone wants to really get up all in Donald's junk. I don't. No. Dude. After I watched his family guy episode like with Donald Trump in it, I was a little scared of him. Like do you see it? Like he like man, like a creek cartoon to Meg cartoon. Yeah. I was like, what the fuck? I was like, is he really liked that? I think so. Yes. Hard or it's a cartoon. I keep saying all sorts of like edits of him on TikTok and they cracked me up. Yeah, he, he went on what the N podcast? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. All these presidents are going on Podcasts on college. Eddie. Yeah, it is Just, it's nuance.


It's a new world. It's crazy. She's Getting a bunch of shit for that too, isn't she? Anytime Alex Cooper is, yeah. Anytime you dip into politics, Kamala's husband wanted to come on our podcast. We said no Thank you not for any political reasons. We're just not the guys for that. Yeah. We Just, That's my thing. I can't talk about it. I don't know enough about it too. Talk about it. Yeah. I don't want an idiot be like, ha ha. Yeah. Run for president. Yeah. We were just like, not our, not our Stick. Not Yeah, not our circus, not our Monkeys. If it was common we would've Yeah. Yeah. That's Different. But I don't, I don't know if we can conduct that. Honestly, if I'm being completely honest, don't Think we could do that. She was like, in high school, That's all we care about for anybody. That's all we ask people.


Like when, even when like we had Dave on our podcast, we were like, so what were we like in high school? And he is like, who cares? What Was Dave like in high school? Sounds like he Said he was the same. The same. Yeah. Still people In lockers. Baseball guy smoking Cigarettes. Yeah. No, he hates cigarettes. I dunno if he smokes cigarettes. Wow. He hates cigarettes. He hates I But he wore a leather jacket. They Give, I think think it was the opposite of what you were thinking. I think he just like liked playing baseball and we kind Of, we did a picture of him. Did he show y'all a picture of him? Oh Yeah. We have high school Dave Pictures. We asked his mom for pictures 'cause we had him on our live show and we like surprised him with all these like baby pictures. And he was like, how the hell did you get these? Yeah. Yeah.


Okay. The thing with him, I feel like he's nice off camera. Yeah. I feel like he's, I could so see that he's nice. Like I seem like he's genuine but then camera's on and he's like, let me talk my shit. I think Even on camera, he's not even trying to be mean. He's just brutally honest. Which is, I respect that though. Why? I Love him a lot. Yeah. Like even if he's not right, he's just stands by what he says. So I think I could, well he had me a little confused 'cause he took up for me for like the Mets thing that went on. What? What? Explain. I threw out the first pitch at the Mets game. When was it? Like a month or two ago. That's sick. I was there for like a charity. That's really cool. Yeah. How was that like, I mean sure. I got to throw out the pitch too. Was it a good throw? She called it.


So that's all that mattered. I was scared. I was gonna like in the head with a baseball, but I didn't. But I donated to their charity that they had going on there and I was like, oh you know, that's a good thing to go to. So we went to their game, you know, done stuff with their charity and then they let us throw out the first pitch. I got shit on by the Met spans and then Dave took up for me. He was like, oh she's doing like a good thing. Like how are y'all being like bitches about it? And I was like, maybe he does like me. And then he said something about how he does not ever wanna come on this podcast. No, I think he does. Like you. I think he thinks the same thing about BFFs. He's like, why does anyone wanna listen to us? Either way. I think he's just like, podcasts are oversaturated. I don't think he meant it in a hurtful way. Okay. Dave? I think he just is a very abrasive man and he gets a little misunderstood Maybe.


Yeah. But I think he does like you because he said that about he loves anything charitable. He does a lot of charity work too. He does? Yeah. I would never guess it. Yeah, I know people think he's really bad, but he's not. Bless His heart. They, we might could be friends maybe. Yeah. I think you guys could be friends. I write him a letter in the mail. Yeah, we're trying to get to that. My friendship. Friend, friend, friend. I could send him a friendship Bracelet, send him. Oh, he would love that. He'd probably be like, what the fuck is this? And just toss it out. That's what I do. He's a swifty. So he would, he would like that. He Is not a swifty. Yes. We need a verser on Dave. Yeah. This seems like, yeah, we gotta get him on here. Yeah. I feel like Yeah, we, I sit down and And conversate with him. Yeah. He's a very big swifty. Like diehard Swifty. I Would've not have Guessed that.


I wouldn't have either. You didn't Know about his eras era tour jacket. So he had what even is this? So he made a jacket for Taylor Swift's concert. It's hand painted, like all of the eras. And he passed it around to every single show. It went to every single concert. Oh my God. Even across into like Paris and Stuff. So he's a fan girl? Yeah, he's a fan girl. I love that. Wait, So what do you do? Like give it to someone or like they would Mail it. They would find someone at like one show and then mail it to the next show and like mail it. It went everywhere. That's kind of Sisterhood of the traveling Dave's jacket. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Are you guys fan girls of anything? Anybody? I'm not a swifty. I like her old music. I haven't listened to her new music a whole lot.

So we're selling a shirt. Caleb Presley. We talk about Caleb a lot. But yeah, we, it's awesome. Caleb Presley works at Barstool and he's from like in the towns that got affected in North Carolina.


So he sold a shirt through Barstool where all the proceeds go towards the victims of Helene. So we've just been reposting and helping that. And then I just did shows with our girl, Whitney. Whitney.

Are you speaking of Whitty? Are you all geared up for Nashville? I thought y'all got me out of that. Oh, Johnny, where are you?


I think you should do it. I think you should do it. Especially You, you committed man. Yeah, Well I gotta thinking about it and then the more I've watched like, of like standup acts, I'm like, I can't fucking do that. I can't get on stage. Like when I done that with Zach, I almost shit myself. Like, I don't know how I got up there and didn't cry. Scary. And I was like, what the fuck? It is Scary. Is that not scary y'all? I Think it's Scary. But then you do it and then, you know, I'd be like, huh, tough crowd. And I'd walk off the stage and Then you, and you could like, you could like feed into the, the, you know, crowd work part of it. Like if somebody yells something, I feel like you'd be pretty fiery and like hit them back with something quick. I Feel Like that's the best part. Yeah. I feel like that would be kind of fun.


But I'd have to watch my mouth. I'd probably get in trouble. No, No, no. You can't As a comic. Yeah. You can't really watch that. How do you pick somebody outta the crowd you wanna like mess with? Usually if they yell something out. Like what if they're just sitting there? If they're just sitting there, I don't know. It's, it's, you know who not to pick on. Because there's some people, if you start picking on 'em, you know they're gonna actually get their feelings hurt. Yeah. I I usually try to go with like white dudes. So do you got you a boyfriend or anything? No. No. What about you? You got, you got Pooky? Yeah. Tell us about Pooky. Well who the Fuck is it? Is it Matt Rife Luke?


He's actually very, he's intimidated by Matt. Yeah. Okay. So do, do you ever hook up with Matt? No. Okay. I'm just asking you. I don't know. I, I need to ask these questions. If That man's like, all right, go to the bedroom and get naked. I'd probably really like, you know, I'd probably spazz out in and out. Yeah. It would never happen. So you have a boyfriend though, Pookie? Yeah, as of Friday. Aw, That's adorable. So He's from Nashville. He is like how far? Spring Hill, far Spring Hill. I don't Know. Is that in and around the area? It's Just around the area. Around Nashville. Yeah, It's like, so he's 40 minutes From Nashville. Oh, sorry, you're not from Nashville. I meant to say Tennessee. But he's just a, he's not a social media guy. I mean he has social media but he don't like posts or nothing like that.


He's like Private on everything Too. Gosh. Yeah. He's not like Jake Paul. No, no. Bless his heart. No, That was a good comparison. Would you ever date someone in the public eye though? I mean, they'd really have to wow me. I feel like we'd be in like competition or something like that. Or they'd have like a big ego and I'd have to humble 'em really quick. I'd be like, Oh, Yeah, I'm the shit. No you're not. Yeah, I, I said on camera. I, when was that? Fuck you ruined the day? I said on BFFs that I would never date anyone famous ever. Literally never wanted to. And then it kind of just happened so I'm It changed Your mind? Oh, I don't know. I wish it, I don't take famous people. But How'd you end up with Zach?


We, I went to one of his shows and then we made a podcast episode about him or about the show and then he DMed me on Instagram. Oh, so he hit you through the Dms? He slid in the dms. Yeah, but it's, I think it's better for the mental to not date someone famous. So yeah, I don't think I could do it. Yeah, it's a lot. It's okay. I got Pooky. How? How do you deal with that though? Like all the rumors about him. We didn't post each other for a while. And then I was on tour and stuff. I don't know. The internet's crazy and they run with stuff and I don't ever defend myself online. So it kind of just spirals into like a snowball. 'cause I think it's stupid to feed into it or like anything. There's rumors. Every new rumor every week of something.


Yeah, I agree. Yeah. So I've been to the conclusion the internet will believe like anything. Yeah, because I do too, too One of em. Yeah. I don't believe everything I see online. So what Was it we seen the other day? Oh, the seven and $50. Oh the Kamala thing. They were like, she donated $750 and she was wearing a belt that like cost more than that. Me and her were like, what the fuck? And then we tell Pooky about it. He was like, y'all two are dumb. And I was like, what do you mean We explain That? Yeah. You guys are gullible like us.
