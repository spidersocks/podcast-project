I care immensely what he has to say. I'm telling myself I Don what he says. But fair. I understand. I'm just saying I want it on record. I care what he has to say. I think we got off on the wrong foot when you asked me if I give him the hawk or no. And I said no. I told you he was gonna come for your ass. Forgot about that. It's just, it's nothing personal. He's just older. I don't look at him like that. Yeah. I never said he was a terrible person. No, no, no. But now I'm saying kiss my ass Dave. Now I I'm that babe. See what?

She hates him like it's Not Muslim. I was like, you tweet That just because you said no Hawk. Like what? Yeah, like it is nothing against them.


I don't guess. It's just they're old men. don don't wanna spit on their dick. you know. That's the only fucking catch with it. That's it. I don't think anyone wants to really get up all in Donald's junk. I Don't. No. Dude. After I watched this family guy episode like with Donald Trump in it, I was a little scared of him. Like, do you see it like It was like being like a cartoon to Meg. Yeah. I was like what the fuck? I was like, is he really like that? I think so, yes. Hard or it's a cartoon. I keep seeing all sorts of like edits of him on TikTok and they cracked me up. Yeah, he he went on what the N podcast? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's crazy. All these presidents are going on podcast. I Combo on college Eddie. Yeah, it is Just, it's nuance.


It's a new world. It's crazy. She's Getting a bunch of shit for that too, isn't she? Anytime you Alex Cooper is, yeah. Anytime you dip into politics, Kamala's husband wanted to come on our podcast. He said no Thank you not for any politic political reasons. We're just not the guys for that. Yeah. We just, That's my thing. I can't talk about it. I don't know enough about it to talk about it. So. Yeah. don don't want an idiot and be like Ha. Yeah. Run for president. Yeah. We were just like, not our, not our stick. Not yeah not our circus, not our Monkeys. If it was common why we would've, yeah. Yeah. That's Different. But I don, don don't know if we can conduct that. Honestly, if I'm being completely honest, don't think we, We could that what It was like in high school. It's all we care about for anybody. That's all we ask people.


Like when, even when like we had Dave on our podcast, we were like, so what were we like in high school? And he is like, who cares? What Was Dave like in high school? Sounds like he Said he was the same. The same. Yeah. Still People In lockers. Baseball guy fucking Cigarettes. Yeah. No we hate cigarettes. I don Dunno if he smokes cigarettes. Wow. He hates cigarettes. Hate. But he wore a leather jacket. They Give, I think think it was the opposite of what you were thinking. I think he just like liked playing baseball and that kind of, We did a picture of him. Did he show y'all a picture of him? Oh Yeah, we have high school Dave Pictures. We asked his mom for pictures 'cause we had him on our live show and we like surprised him with all these like baby pictures. And he was like, how the hell did you get these? Yeah. Yeah.


Okay. The thing with him, I feel like he's nice off camera. Yeah. I Feel like he's too, I could so see that. He's nice. Like I seem like he's genuine but then camera's on and he's like, let me talk my shit. I think Even on camera he's not even trying to be mean. He's just brutally honest. Which is I respect that why I love Him a lot. Yeah. Like even if he's not right, he's just stands by what he says. So I think I could, well he had me a little confused 'cause he took up for me for like the Mets thing that went on. What? What? Explain. I threw out the first pitch at the Mets game. When was it? Like a month or two ago. That's sick. Sick. I was there for like a charity. That's really cool. Yeah. How was that like I mean? Sure. I got to throw out the pitch too. Was it a good throw? She called it.


So that's all that mattered. My, I was scared I was gonna like in the head with a baseball, but I didn't. But I donated to their charity they had going on there. And I was like, oh you know, that's a good thing to go to. So we went to their game, you know, done stuff with their charity and then they let us throw out the first pitch. I got shit on by the Mets spans and then Dave took up for me. He was like, oh, she's doing like a good thing. Like how are y'all being like bitches about it? And. I was like, maybe he does like me. And then he said something about how he does not ever wanna come on this podcast. No, I think he does. Like you. I think he thinks the same thing about BFFs. He's like, why does anyone wanna listen to us? Either way. I think he's just like, podcasts are oversaturated. I don't think he meant it in a hurtful way. Okay. Dave? I think he just is a very abrasive man and he gets a little misunderstood Maybe.


Yeah. But I think he does like you because he said that about he loves anything charitable. He does a lot of charity work too. He does? Yeah. I would never guess it. Yeah, I know people think he's really bad, but he's not. Bless His heart. They, we might could be friends maybe. Yeah. I think you guys could be friends. I write him a letter in the mail. Yeah, we're trying to get to next house. My friend, friend, friend, I could send him a friendship Bracelet, send him. Oh, he would love that. He'd probably be like, what the fuck is this? And just toss it out. That's what I do. He's a swifty. So he would, he would like that. He Is not a swifty. Yes. We need a verser on Dave. Yeah. Yeah. This seems like, yeah, we gotta get him on here. Yeah. I feel like yeah, we, I need to sit down and conversate with him. Yeah. He's a very big swifty. Like diehard Swifty. I Would've not have guessed that.


I wouldn't have either. You didn't Know about his eras era tour jacket. So he had, what even is this? He made a jacket for Taylor Swift's concert. It's hand painted, like all of the eras. And he passed it around to every single show. It went to every single concert. Oh my God. Even across into like Paris and Stuff. So he's a fan girl? Yeah, he's a fan girl. I love that. Wait, So what do you do? Like give it to someone or like they Would mail it. They would find someone at like one show and then mail it to the next show and like mail it. It went everywhere. That's kind of Sisterhood of the traveling Dave's jacket. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Are you guys fan girls of anything? Anybody? I'm not a swifty. I like her old music.

It felt like Momlike. She was like, I just, you know, I just wanted to take her under runway wing. I love that woman. She's so sweet. Are you speaking of Whitney? Are you all geared up for Nashville? I thought y'all got me out of that. Oh, Johnny, where Are you? I think you should do it. I think you should do it. I get on stage. Especially You're committed man. Yeah, Well I gotta thinking about it and then the more I've watched like, of like standup acts, I'm like, I can't fucking do that. I can't get on stage. Like when I done that with Zach, I almost shit myself. It's like, don don't know how I got up there and didn't cry. And. I was like, what the fuck? It Is Scary. Is that not scary y'all? I think It's scary. But then you do it and then, you know, I'd Be like, huh, tough crowd.


And I'd walk off the stage and then you, You could like, you could like feed into the, the, you know, crowd work part of it. Like if somebody yells something, I feel like you'd be pretty fiery and like hit them back with something quick. I feel like that's the best part. Yeah. I feel like that would be kind of fun. But I'd have to watch my mouth. I'm probably get in trouble. No, No, no. You can't comic, You know. Yeah. You can't really do, How do you pick somebody outta the crowd? Do you wanna like mess with? Usually if they yell something out, Like what if they're just sitting there? If they're just sitting there. don don't know. It's, it is, you know who not to pick on. Because there's some people, if you start picking on 'em, you know they're gonna actually get their feelings hurt. Yeah.


I I usually try to go with like white dudes. So do you got you a boyfriend or anything? No. No. What about you? You got, you got Pooky? Yeah. Tell us about Pooky. Well, and who The fuck is it? Is it Matt? Rife? Pookie's Actually very, he's intimidated by Matt. Yeah. Okay. So do, do you ever hook up with Matt? No. Okay. I'm just asking you don don't know. I mean I need to ask these questions. If That man was like, all right, go to the bedroom and get naked. I'd probably really like, you know, I'd probably spazz up and Yeah, it would never happen. So. you have a boyfriend though? Pookie? Yeah, As of Friday.


Oh, That's Adorable. He's from Nashville. He is like how far? Spring Hill. How far is Spring Hill? don Don't know. Is that in and around the Area? It's just around the area. Around Nashville? Yeah. Like, So he's 40 Minutes from Nashville. Oh, sorry, you're not from Nashville. I meant to say Tennessee. But he's just a, he's not a social media guy. I mean he has social media but he don't like posts or nothing like that. He's like private on everything. Gosh. Yeah. So he is not like Jake Paul. No. No. Bless his heart. No, That's a good comparison. Would you ever date someone in the public eye though? I mean they'd really have to wow me. Yeah. I feel like we'd be in like competition or something like that. Or they'd have like a big ego and I'd have to humble 'em really quick. They'd be like, oh yeah, I'm the shit.


No you're not. Yeah, I, I said on camera. I, when was that fucking you ruined the day? I said on BFFs that I would never date anyone famous ever. Literally never wanted to. And then it kind of just happened. So what Changed your mind? Oh, I don't know. I wish it, I don't take famous people. But How'd you end up with Zach? We, I went to one of his shows and then we made a podcast episode about him or about the show and then he DMed me on Instagram. Oh, so he hit you through the dms? He slid in the dms. Yeah. Look at You go. Yeah. That's such a good match. But it's a, I think it's better for the mental to not date someone famous. So Yeah, I don't think I could do it.


Yeah, It's a lot. It's okay. I got Pooky. How do You deal with that though? Like all the rumors about him, about You guys? Where'd that even come from that y'all broke up. I thought was so Stupid. We didn't post each other for a while and then I was on tour and stuff. don don't know. The internet's crazy and they run with stuff and I don't ever defend myself online. So it kind of just spirals into like a snowball. 'cause I think it's stupid to feed into it or like anything. There's rumors. Every new rumor every week of something. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. So I've, from the conclusion the internet will believe like anything. Yeah, because I do too. I'm one of em. Yeah. I don I. don believe everything I see online. So what Was it wasting the other day? Oh, $750.


Oh, The Kamala thing. They were like, she donated $750 and she was wearing a belt that would like cost more than that. Me and her were like, what the fuck? And then we tell Pooky about it. He was like, y'all two are dumb. And I was like, what do you mean We didn't explain it? Yeah. You guys gullible like us. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What about your dating life?
