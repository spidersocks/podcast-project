Watching Fox Spiral out of control. It's like a new favorite hobby of mine. And now with vice President Kamala Harris making her VP selection. Governor Tim Walls of Minnesota, boy oh boy, is Fox melting Down here is Laura Ingraham, who I think Laura, it's time for some new writers play the clip. Yeah, she

4:
Goes reflexively and the fact to Minnesota because she, she felt he was loyal. It's been reported on C nnn today. Yeah. That he was loyal. I thought they said Trump had a loyalty, loyalty test. They didn't like that.

5:
Yeah. I also thought it was interesting where he said that I'll have President Harris's back if we get elected. What is he comparing that to? He's, is he comparing that to Kamala Harris? With Joe Biden? I, I didn't understand what that meant at all. It made no sense, but it did make me think, oh, is he saying that Kamala Harris stabbed Joe Biden in the back and managed to get the Democratic nomination through, you know, you know, using the entire party powerful apparatus and money Bagman to take the nomination away from him and give it to her. Is that what he was saying? Oh, I dunno. It was really weird.

3:
Charlie, next up you have Jesse Waters on Fox. Jesse, new new writers here play the clip.

6:
Democrats can't be honest about who they are. They have to lie to you and hide their positions.

3:
Yeah, it's getting really pathetic. And you know, it gets extra pathetic when they have to bring Stephen Miller out, who goes, you know, Tim Walls, by the way, he's a very successful governor in Minnesota. Stephen Miller goes, they're gonna turn the Midwest into Mogadishu, play the clip.

7:
He is the biggest booster in the whole country for unlimited refugee resettlement. That means under the Harris Walls plan, they're going to turn the entire Midwest into Mogadishu. That's their plan, that's their policy. I don't think there's a market for that in the United States of America.

3:
Yeah, they've got nothing. And just watching them embarrass themselves on Fox and watching Fox totally lose control, it's, it's a sight to behold. By the way, here is Kevin McCarthy saying that when he served in Congress with Governor Walls at the time, governor Walls was a member of Congress from 2007 to 2019. McCarthy says he was like Bernie Sanders here, her play the clip.

8:
This is the most extreme. This is going from San Francisco to here. You go into Minnesota, the area that even Ronald Reagan could not win. I mean this is what's so amazing to me. I served with Tim. He, we came into Congress together. He's known for being the Bernie Sanders of Congress, but to combine, yeah,

3:
I don't think anyone's ever actually said that, but okay, Kevin McCarthy, you are now a authority on these things. You got kicked out by your own party from the House of Representatives and from the speakership back to Steven Miller, just the name calling. He's just like, you know, they're morons, they're idiots or play the clip.

7:
The man is a moron. He is an incompetent, he is a radical, and he is gonna turn the entire Midwest into a third world state. This is a disaster for America. We have to beat this guy and we have to beat Harris in November. Yeah.

3:
By the way, could I just, I I, I feel like I need to do a little bit of a refresher over here after showing you Stephen Miller repeatedly. I'm sorry about that. Here's Governor Walls, the VP pick of Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive VP of the Democratic Party. Governor Walls giving a speech challenging JD Vance, or as I call 'em, shady Vance, to a debate saying, shady Vance, get off the couch and debate me. Play the clip.

9:
Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland jd, studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on. That's not what Middle America is. And I gotta tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy that is, if you, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up.

9:
So you see what I did there?

Then Jessica Tarla was just incredible, the only kind of pro-democracy voice really on Fox Right now and hear, she's like, you could throw around the word socialist as much as you want telling the, the other, the MAGA Republicans on our panel. But like, could we be clear about Minnesota like leading the country and Fortune 500 businesses there, play the clip

11:
And that Governor Walls brings a lot of experience that she wanted on the ticket. Not only his time in Congress where he was, I think the seventh most conservative Democrat in the house. You know, someone who is a gun owner, someone who does have those Midwestern values, but his executive experience in Minnesota, and I've seen, and Jesse just radiated some of them, the attacks on him is a socialist, I don't know what kind of socialist runs the number six best state in America for big business. Target is there for a reason. 3M is there for a reason. United Healthcare is there for a reason. General Mills is there for a reason and the kinds of things that he has gotten past are exactly the kinds of things that Kamala Harris wants to talk about. Things like paid sick leave, $2.3 billion into public schools, did a huge infrastructure bill.

11:
Was this your topic? Yeah, actually it was, hmm, in the last couple of days, I was honestly happy with all four finalists and if it had been Andy Beshear, Mark Kelly, Tim Walls or Josh, I would've been happy. But what you're going to see is the right, trying to define him as Jesse did. But you're gonna see that side by side picture of Tim Walls after he signed free school breakfast and free lunch. And someone like Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is a star in the re Republican party, got a prime speaking spot at the RNC signing a bill to allow kids under 16 to be able to work. That is the contrast here. A guy who wants to put food in kids' bellies and someone who wants kids to be able to work and he's the real deal. He is what JD Vance wishes that he were.

3:
And Jessica Tarlo then saying some basic facts here, play the clip. It's lived there

11:
For four years. Okay, so

12:
What

6:
Two boys need tampons for?

11:
I don't know about this

6:
Tampon, the back. Why is he giving little boys tampons

12:
Then why is he giving illegals driver's licenses? Why

11:
Not So they can vote, which I'm sure is where you're going with this mess.

12:
I'm not going anywhere. I'm asking a simple question, Tim, I Why would you give an illegal driver's license so that

11:
They could be able to drive a car to get to their

12:
Jobs? Yeah. And what do you think the chances are that they're gonna, that they're gonna have insurance on that car or that there's I mean if I'm, you look at any of the statistics relating to accidents with illegals, there's a real problem for Americans.

11:
The most accidents are from undocumented people in America.

12:
What I'm saying is into accidents. They don't have insurance. Okay?

11:
If you cont

3:
Jessica Tarlov saying, if this is, if, if you think this name calling and talking about Vice President Kamala Harris's race and being weird, if, if that's your approach, like you realize you're gonna lose, right? You play this clip, they

12:
Don't have insurance. Okay?

11:
If you continue running a campaign like this where you're attacking him in that way, where you're talking about Kamala as someone who doesn't know anything, who's incompetent, there's a higher likelihood that the Republicans will lose. If you wanna talk about issues, that's, I think a, a good way to go about it. If I were to be advisor Republican, okay, I'll, which I

3:
Am, back to Jesse Waters, who goes, you know what Tim Walls did? He turned the flag of Minnesota into the Somalian flag. Again, it's just so pathetic. Not even grasping at straws, it's like grasping at like the dribble of whatever near play This clip,

6:
This guy put tampons in boys bathrooms, fourth grade boys bathrooms, tampons. He wants CRT taught. He was all about toppling the Columbus statue. This guy changed the flag of the state to look more like Somalia. What is wrong with this guy? And co

3:
More, I gotta show you more from Jessica Tara, love here. She was pitch perfect and she goes, you know how like when Shady Vance was giving his speech, he was literally standing in front of a sign that said Kamala. And it covered up where they were trying to say Kamala chaos. And so it just said, Kamala, here play this clip.

11:
Oh no, I got mine. I got plenty of mine. So here's the

13:
Question, Jessica. To Jesse's point, apparently the Trump campaign is rather pleased with this pick. They think it'll be easier to beat them.

11:
Yeah, they're definitely projecting that. I saw JD Vance this morning in front of a huge Kamala sign where you couldn't even read the chaos. So everything is going really well for that side of the aisle. And they were going to

3:
Jesse Waters just saying random things. Why did, why did Governor Wall's vacation in China? Here play this clip.

6:
Jessica, I have to ask, why did he honeymoon in China? What? He's been to China 30 times? That's strange. Oh, oh, I find that there's something see there with Hunter Biden suspicious. Okay, someone should look into it. Okay, dude,

3:
Donald Trump has fake bank accounts in China. What are you even talking about? And here's Fox. This was when Governor Walls was announced. Fox came up with this compilation against Governor Walls as though these things that they're mentioning are like bad things, like free lunches to children and protecting women's reproductive rights. Here play this clip. Well,

14:
Facts still matter. So let's look back at his record. Waltz's first executive order as governor was to create a diversity, equity and inclusion council. He also supported open borders.

9:
You know, he talks about this wall. I always say, let me know how high it is. If it's 25 feet, then I'll invest in the 30 foot ladder

14:
Factory. And he pushed socialism.

9:
Don't ever shy away from our progressive values. One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness. Just do the damn work.

3:
Oh,

14:
Oh wait, and there's more. He signed an executive order protecting gender affirming care or surgeries for minors in his state. And in 2020, he was the governor of Minnesota during the George Floyd riots that burned part of Minneapolis to the ground. It was so bad that Waltz himself called out his own response.

9:
I got a call from a friend and a dedicated public servant. Senator Torres Ray called in her district and it was on fire. And there weren't any police there. There weren't any firefighters. There was no social control. And her constituents were locked in their house wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen. If the issue was is that the state should have moved faster, you know, that is on me.

3:
Not only do they have nothing, they are spiraling like I've never seen before. The momentum with vice President, Kamala Harris, and Governor Walls is electric. Can you feel it? Hit subscribe. Let's get to 3 million subscribers together. Thanks so much for watching and have a wonderful day.
