Another day in Donald Trump is tanking the markets. Yes, he's starting the week again by crashing our economy once again. And here's what he's sending to his supporters to try to con them even more. As most Americans realize what a con artist he is, Donald Trump sends the following message, please answer before this poll closes tonight. Would you accept a Doge dividend check signed by Trump? Should Trump give Doge savings back to American citizens via check? Then Donald Trump puts his top national economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, on CNBC, and he or he says that the reason that we're seeing GDP contraction and likely a recession is it is Biden's fault.


He says, this is Biden's economy. Biden's doing everything wrong. The Trump administration, the Trump regime is absolutely panicking today. Let me share with you this clip of Trump's national economic advisor play this clip Near term. We've got a Biden economy that you know still most of Biden policies are in place. If you look at the Atlanta Fed GDP now number, it's showing negative first quarter, which is kind of, If you like, a metric of the inheritance of President Biden. A lot of that is also from a big increase in the trade deficit, which as you know and you've been covering, Joe, is happen to get part because people are anxious about future tariffs and so they're stockpiling.


And so that's a very, very temporary pheno. As our editor in Chief Ron Philip Kowski writes, here's the Trump recession timeline. One, this will be a golden age on day one, prices will come down and the economy will boom. Two, these policies won't cause a recession. We know what we're doing. Three, okay, it will cause short term pain, but it will be good in the long term. Four, this is Biden's recession. That's the pattern that we've seen. One of the things we're seeing as well as Luke Howa writes, last week was the first time since 1988 that US stocks fell 3%, while global stocks that are not the US related stocks rose 2.5%.


So the market's actually doing well outside of the us, but the US has become a toxic cesspool because the White House is a toxic cesspool. I mean, just take a look at this right here. A whole bunch of themes are getting absolutely destroyed today. As George Perks writes, and it's not just AI adjacent stuff. Banks are down even more private equity is getting crushed. You name it, American companies are getting destroyed right now, and and that means my 401k, your 401k, our pensions, our life savings is getting destroyed.


Like we told you it was going to because Donald Trump is an idiot and he's bankrupted every freaking thing essentially in his life. So yes, he was going to bankrupt it again. The guy who has bankruptcy after bankruptcy, who's the worst business person who's a destroyer, who somehow convinces people that he's a good businessman, even though he's bankrupted all of his companies. Yes, guess what? He's bankrupting the United States again, and now he's panicking and lying and saying, oh, here's what's really going on. Here's what's really going on. Just front page today from the USA today, a theme though that we've been talking about, as you know, front page on the Midas Touch Network, now for what?


Several months Canadian backlash stores pull wine whiskey from shelves over tariffs. Now, we told you, we said this, Canadian boycott is going to sting and hurt the United States far more than anyone has predicted. And how do we know that? Well, there's a reason why the Might has touched podcast is the number one podcast of all podcasts in Canada. We speak to Canadians, we speak to the Canadian leaders, we speak to the Canadian people all of the time. We knew that the tourism boycott was gonna be more than 10%. I said it would be closer to 50 to 100%. People in Canada ain't traveling to the US anymore. People in Canada ain't buying us anymore, and they were our biggest trading partner.


So of course it's going to impact us beyond even the retaliatory tariffs from them. And so as the markets keep on crashing, what's Donald Trump saying? Well, Donald Trump saying that while he guts Medicaid, while he guts all of these programs that actually are vital to Americans as he like shuts down National Park Service Rangers as as, as he screws Americans. He does say, though, he's moved on to his next target. He's now, he's now trying to defraud the people of Greenland. Greenland. You know what I mean? We, we know he said this before, but this was the post that he's made. And Elon Musk is reposting because Donald Trump has like just one or two tricks, right?


He's gotta go on and say, okay, maybe I'm tanking the United States, Greenland. You want me to make you rich? You want me to make you rich again? I mean this. These posts are just ridiculous. As I made clear during my joint address to Congress, the United States strongly supports the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future. We are ready to invest billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich. What the hell are you talking about? Former President Biden invested billions of dollars in the United States with things like the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, and what are you doing? You're reversing all of those policies that invest in America.


So you can invest in Greenland or tell Greenland you're going to make them rich. I mean, what the hell is even going on here?

Oh, and then by the way, it now turns out also that the guy who's serving as the acting under Secretary of State for public diplomacy, one of Trump's most senior State department officials, as Andy Kaczinski points out, has now been deleting all of his tweets, spreading the unfounded rumors that his boss, Marco Rubio's, secretary of State, attended gay foam parties and called Marco Rubio, low iq. But folks, as Donald Trump was heading into DC today, he did his usual kind of conart shtick. We're gonna be so rich, you're not gonna get to know what you're gonna do.


You're gonna be so rich, you're not gonna know. Do it all your money. You're gonna be so rich here. Play this clip. All I know is this. We're gonna take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we're gonna become so rich. You're not gonna know where to spend all that money. I'm telling you, you just watch. We're gonna have jobs, we're gonna have open factories. It's gonna be great. I mean, so ridiculous. Oh, by the way, that Jeff Bezos relationship with Trump, the Bezos Trump connection, you know, we know that Bezos, what bought Melania's documentary for $40 million or $41 million. Now guess what? Everybody, the Apprentice is coming to Amazon Prime video. Yes, Bezos did a deal with Donald Trump to bring apprentice seasons one through seven to stream on Amazon Prime.


So while your 4 0 1 Ks and your pensions and your life savings is going absolutely down the drain right now as America's economy is in the toilet bowl, it's okay. 'cause Donald Trump selling Trump meme coins. And Trump did a deal. Yeah, not the deal to create peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. Not, yeah, not, not that deal. The deal he did though, was to get the apprentice seasons one to seven on Amazon Prime. Good job, Donald. Good job. I'm sure all the Republicans are so proud, they think you're so strong for doing that. Here's the Wall Street Journal headline from today.


Tariff wars are often short. Their legacies aren't economists. Fear that trump's tariffs once they take hold, could have unexpected effects long after he leaves office. Meaning even when he's gone, he's going to screw us for the foreseeable future. Oh, and then Donald Trump spends his time as well attacking the former prime minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull. That's how Donald Trump's spending his time not attacking Trudeau anymore. Now, now Turnbull the former prime minister of Australia. Trump goes, Malcolm Turnbull, the former prime minister of Australia, who was always leading that wonderful country from behind, never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so.


I always thought he was a weaken and effective leader, and obviously Australians agreed with me. By the way, this is what former Prime minister of Australia, Machim Turnbull said about Donald Trump play this clip. When You see Trump with Putin, as I have on a few occasions, he's like the 12-year-old boy that goes to high school and meets the captain of the football team, my hero. It is really creepy. It's really creepy. Now, I don't, and that struck you at the time. Oh, absolute. It struck everybody. It was, it was like it when you could touch it, it was creep. The creepiness was palpable. Are you trying to say they're having a bromance? No, I'm not saying, I'm not saying, I'm just telling you what I saw.


Regrettably, the Republican party under Donald Trump, and particularly the right wing of the Republican Party, are very sympathetic to Vladimir Putin. I mean, I've been with Trump and Putin. Trump is in awe of Putin. Tyrants are often popular. You see, the key to democracy, liberal democracy is that it empowers the majority, but it also, through the rule of law, constrains the majority. And If you get to the point where anybody who can muster a majority, and I don't think Trump can do that by the way, but anyone who can muster a majority is given absolute power and then can do whatever they like to the minority.


That's not a democracy. That is a tyranny that that is, that is an autocracy. Even if it's got the support of 50, 51% of the population. That is not what makes a democracy. A democracy, as we understand it, is one where the rule of law protects all citizens. And the rule of law applies to all citizens, whether they're the president or the prime minister, or an ordinary, you know, elector. And you want me to show you how Turnbull was? Right? This was Donald Trump last night being asked If you believe Putin is disrespecting you by attacking Ukraine, let's play it this week. Disrespecting respecting you by attacking Ukraine when you're trying to, who this person Putin disrespecting you by attacking Ukraine.


What did he do? Well, he's attacking Ukraine. Is he disrespecting me? Yeah. Who? Who are you With? I'm Michael Bur from Washington. You've lost a lot of credibility. Go ahead. What else? What kind?
