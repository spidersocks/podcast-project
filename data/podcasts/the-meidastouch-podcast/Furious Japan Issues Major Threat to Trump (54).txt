Japan's finance minister Katzen, new Bocato had a powerful message for the United States. If you treat us in Japan with disrespect over these tariff negotiations, we could use the nuclear option. We have the largest holdings of US treasuries in the world totaling over 1 trillion. You treat us with disrespect, Donald. We will dump those And we can crash the United States markets. So don't test us, don't treat us with disrespect, don't dishonor us. And Japan has objected to the way the United States has presented these trade proposals.

4:
Now, this should be an easy deal to make with Japan. We already had a trade deal with Japan in 2018 that Donald Trump negotiated. And now that Donald Trump wants to dishonor Japan, treat Japan with disrespect, Japan is objecting to the trade proposal. And right now there's been no deal. Now Donald Trump has told us what week after week after week we're about to do a deal with Japan. I'm about to do a deal with India and Japan. We're announcing it. It's right around the corner. It's right around the corner that has not taken place despite all of Donald Trump's lies that it's going to happen.

4:
And to me, this is a major indicator again because the deal with Japan should be the easiest deals. Now we got a whiff that things were going very bad when Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba back on April 21st, 2025 said, we're not rushing into anything. We want to strike a fair deal. We don't want be disrespected, and Japan just can't keep on conceding things to the US without getting anything in return. Japan is not going to do that. Then messages got out that a deal with Japan may not take days, but may be weeks away.

4:
And you know, one of the things that we're learning about as well is, and you see right here, Japan's lead tariff negotiator, Roy Siwa just says, things just generally are not going good. And Prime Minister is shebas administration saying, Japan's prepared to use its role as America's largest creditor as leverage in the trade talks. So if that's how our close allies are treating us, how do you think the rest of the world is viewing us right now? I wanna just show you some data points here as well. Why is Japan saying this now? Well, if you've been watching the Midas Touch Network, you know we've been follow.

4:
We've been following Prime Minister Hashi's actions. One of the things that Japan saw that they took big notice of the elections in Canada. You go, how could the elections in Canada impact Japan? It's why on this network we have a global focus. So you can see the connections. The same reason that the Canadian elections also had a big impact on the Australian elections, and it's the Trump effect. When Trump is dishonoring nations, treating nations like crap, a resistance rises against Donald Trump. And if leaders are obsequious to Donald Trump and try to appease Donald Trump, they're punished at the ballot box.

4:
Take a look at the Japan Times, for example. The Trump effect on elections is just beginning, including in Japan. And this article talks about how the governing party in Japan is worried that the government could be toppled by the opposition party if they strike a bad deal with Trump look weak, and they get mocked by Donald Trump. Let me show you an opposition party member of Parliament. I've showed this clip before, but it's worth playing right now. Here's an opposition member and here's what he has to say here, play this clip.

5:
But the shit the United States is saying is completely unreasonable. The logic is all over the place and there's no consistency. However, when Japan negotiates regarding what they're saying, well, to put it clearly, it's close to extortion by juvenile delinquent. If Japan gives in and follows their unreasonable demand, sighing its negotiation ordeal, it'll set a bad precedent and create a negative example. If the extort gains money once it's certain that they will extort again. The formula itself is a complete mess. I wasn't great at math, but if that showed up in a math exam, it would definitely score zero.

5:
That's why although Minister Awa is serious and capable, there is also concern about whether a serious person can handle it. Since they are not reasonable, they won't listen to reasonable things. Although I said every option, you absolutely must not provide information to an unreasonable opponent. If you get concessions that way, it'll set a bad example. Anyway, please do not give into the extortion from the us though. It's really bad to say, but this is extortion. If we listen to this, it'll really become a bad example.

Going back to the other data point that I wanted to talk about with Trump's disrespect as well. On was Thursday Donald Trump spoke where? University of Alabama, he gave that disrespectful speech where he was like doing the, I remember he was doing that move. It was, the whole thing was just so utterly weird. Go back and watch the video that I did on that. They're like, Ben, what the hell are you talking about? Going watch it. But here Donald Trump says that the US can sell cars in Japan because it's taring the hell out of the United States. Japan hasn't imposed a tariff on car imports since 1978.

4:
Trump has no clue what the hell he's talking about. Play this clip

7:
Pretty soon, sooner than most people think, because that's what other countries have been doing to us. Just so you understand, they were taring the hell out of us. We couldn't sell cars in Europe, we couldn't sell cars in China. We couldn't sell cars in Japan or anywhere else. We couldn't do anything.

4:
Now, the Financial Times reported last week that Donald Trump is attacking Japan over a bowling ball test. That is that Donald Trump takes issue with where Donald Trump says in Japan, in addition to taring our cars, which they don't, they drop bowling balls. This is what Donald Trump says. Is it crazy? They drop bowling balls on the roofs of our cars and then when the cars break, they say, we're not buying American. Trump has quote puzzle trade negotiators in Tokyo after complaining about a test where he claims a bowling ball is dropped on a car.

4:
Japan does not carry out such tests. Here's from April 24th, 2025. This was Charles Gasparino from Fox's Big scoop. People inside the Trump White House are alerting Wall Street execs. They are nearing an agreement in principle on trade with India. According to my sources, gas espina warns, we've been here with Japan, but there has not been any deals yet with Japan. It's all market manipulation. They go tell this to Wall Street, they spike the stock prices for a few days, then they get dumped. Main Street gets, har gets hurt. And the billionaire oligarchs who get the tips from the Trump regime about when they're gonna message these things and not do 'em, they make money.

4:
And we, the people get absolutely screwed over these things. Right here. Japan's press secretary, Kitamura Toshiro, he was in the Philippines this past week talking about the bilateral relationships with the Philippines, broader relations in the region as well. Here's what he talks about in terms of dealing with Trump. And I want you to, when you watch it, I want you to see how Japan's press Secretary, Kitamura Toshiro, just how composed he is and contrasted to Trump's behavior. Play this clip

8:
This morning our prime minister met representative of Japanese community here and they, he heard the every concerns and opinions of the local businessmen. And with regard to the US televis of issues, our prime minister had the telephone company session with Pleasant Trump early this month. And then they have decided to establish to, to launch a ministerial dialogue between two countries. And Minister Ava was designated as a chief of negotiator and he had already once a ministerial discussions in Washington DC and now he's visiting to Washington DC to hold second round of this negotiation.

8:
And as, as for the US tariff issues, I think that the tariffs actions could affect a lot on the, the global economy as well as this free train system. So we heard there the concerns of the Japanese community this morning as well. And we, based on those opinions concerns, we convey our message to our counterpart of the US And we hope that we can find out a good solution between, in two countries, which is not only good for two country, but good for for the world, including Philippines.

4:
And finally, I had the opportunity a few weeks back to do this interview with the United States, the former US Ambassador to Japan, rah Emanuel. And If you wa when do we, we did this in March, right? mid-March, actually I think I, we did it before the, the Liberation Day tra, you know, or liquidation day or right around them. We were warning about this months ago, Japan, China, Philippines. And it was important for me to give us the right, you know, to give you all the warnings. 'cause you could just follow the data. If you speak to the experts and you follow the data, like If you follow the freight levels, If you follow the trucking volumes, If you see the ships aren't coming into the ports on the West coast, long Beach, Seattle, east Coast, Boston, you go, oh crap, we're gonna run out of supplies.

4:
Yeah, it's gonna happen. There's gonna be a Tom Hanks moment. I call it a Tom Hanks moment. Remember Donald Trump said like a miracle, it's all gonna go away with COVID. And then Tom Hanks got it like, oh shit, lockdown mode. We're gonna have a Tom Hanks moment soon with stuff not being on the shelves. That's what's gonna happen Anyway. Here's four more Ambassador Ram Emanuel to Japan. That's why we had to get him on. We need to speak to him about this here, play this

9:
Clip. Japan's the number one foreign direct investor in the United States for the last four years consecutively over a million Americans or a million Americans work for Japanese companies and nearly half of their investment goes to manufacturing. So it's a kind of, you know, we're gonna kind of be Pennywise and dollar foolish here. Second, you know, Japan hosts the largest military footprint the United States has anywhere in the world. It is the only country that has a permanent aircraft carrier. It is in the, it is the long pole in our deterrence against China in the Indo-Pacific. And so, you know, nothing stays just in the economic lane. It's a relationship. So that means national security, diplomatic support, it means political support and it means economic support and integration.

9:
Second, imagine this when the United States wants to put further sanctions on China as it relates to export controls for high tech. The only way it's successful is Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Dutch stand, shoulder to shoulder with the United States. They're gonna think real hard about whether we should stand with the United States or allow our companies to continue to export to China. So, you know, relationships don't just have one lane. It's a series of things. You weigh equities against each other. So I think this is very shortsighted in this approach. There's a way you could have approached as we did in years past. Both when I worked for President Clinton, we did the five pillars on trade, et cetera.

9:
Japan now is the number one, as I said, number one, foreign investor in the United States. Nearly a million Americans work for them. And of those half are in the manufacturing industrial space.

4:
So powerful words from Japan saying Uhuh ain't happening. We're prepared to use our treasury holdings If you dishonor and If you disrespect us. Also, as we previously reported, and Reuters and Carl Quintanilla did a good job of highlighting this too. The Chinese government sent a letter a few weeks back to Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba calling for a coordinator response to US President Donald Trump's tariff measures. They had a ministerial level meeting Japan, South Korea and China. Does that sound familiar?

4:
Former President Biden brought, that's why China did it. That's why Xi Pen did it. He knows and Trump's too stupid to get it. Former President Biden brought together those leaders in Washington together, side by side, shoulder to shoulder as a deterrent to China was the ultimate checkmate move. Donald Trump took the checkmates and like took the, and turned them into checkers and then put 'em all over his face like a fool. That's what happened. We'll keep you posted with more, but he can't do a deal with Japan. No deal. Donald can't do a deal with anybody. Hit subscribe.

4:
Let's get to 5 million.
