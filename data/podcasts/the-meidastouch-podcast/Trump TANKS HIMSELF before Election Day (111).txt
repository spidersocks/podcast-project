The election is right around the corner, folks. Let's talk about what's happened just over the past week with disaster after disaster for the Donald Trump campaign. And let's contrast that to the campaign being run by Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Wall. So yesterday Donald Trump unable to open up a garbage truck door. He dresses like a garbage man throughout the day and during his speeches, after calling, after his campaign called Puerto Rico Floating Garbage, and basically said that people in Puerto Rico are garbage. Donald Trump refuses to condemn what happened from his campaign, but says the word garbage is a very, very sexy word.

0:
He says, Donald Trump's other top surrogate maga. Mike Johnson says that he and Donald Trump have plans immediately on day one to terminate the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, taking people off their healthcare, allowing insurance companies to once again discriminate on the basis of preexisting conditions, literally potentially causing tens of millions of Americans to die. What else is part of that closing message from the Trump campaign? Well, Elon Musk, Donald Trump's other top surrogate is out there saying that under Donald Trump's plans, most Americans, other than the billionaires, are going to suffer immediate hardship right away.

0:
But Elon Musk says, don't worry that hardship will hit you just for a little bit, but then we'll be cool after you are meant to suffer. Donald Trump is also out there making comments that whether women like it or not, he's gonna do what he wants to do to them. It's an actual quote from Donald Trump, whether women like it or not. Also, Donald Trump went to Albuquerque, New Mexico today where he's refused to pay the city the bills about $500,000 that he owes them. So he had to deliver this speech on the tarmac. He couldn't actually leave the tarmac because he's in default, essentially, to the city.

0:
He talked about his weave, which is basically, in my opinion, his dementia like symptoms. And he said the only reason that he made this stop in Albuquerque is in order to help his credentials with the Latino community. He says, and that's just getting started. Oh, by the way, did I mention Donald Trump today filed a $10 billion lawsuit? He just made up the number against CBS because the thin-skinned, wannabe authoritarian got his feelings hurt that vice President Kamala Harris had the courage to do an interview that he refused to do.

0:
What claim or cause of action are you alleg? Are you, do you wanna know? Donald Trump alleges there is none. He just makes it up, comes up with a $10 billion numbers, makes that number up out of thin air to get the headlines to try to look like a tough guy. But you know what? He looks to me absolutely freaking pathetic while vice President Kamala Harris is out there talking about what she plans to do for the American people as more surrogates are speaking out on her behalf. Like LeBron James is out there speaking out. Donald Trump is just showing you that he is a petty, pathetic person who should not be called a man at all, because he's never matured past the stage of petulant, little fricking bully who's using campaign dollars to file ridiculous stupid lawsuits while his entire campaign looks just absolutely pathetic.

0:
I could go on and on and on. Brett Jordy, let me bring you in. Brothers, what's going on? Tell us how you really feel. Ben. Oh my gosh, it's so wild. I cannot believe that we are now just days away from the 2024 election and the closing messages right now of each of the candidates really tell you everything you need to know. You see Donald Trump doubling down on his hate, doubling down on his racism, doubling down on his stunts, on his desperation, on his legal actions, just all the chaos. And we are seeing a lot of repeats as well from 2020 with Donald Trump preemptively claiming that there is fraud in Pennsylvania. And you see all these MAGA influencers already blaming women for the result of the election saying that women shouldn't even have the right to vote.

0:
How dare they vote in, in a different way from their husbands if their husbands vote for Trump? We are seeing just the, honestly, just one of the most reprehensible finishing ends of a campaign that we have ever seen, ever. And meanwhile with Vice President Kamala Harris, we are seeing a message of unity. We're seeing a message of hope. We are seeing a message of freedom of the American spirit. Honestly, she's running such a fantastic campaign and I have a lot of optimism in her. And if somehow she does not win win this election, it is not her fault. We have a serious problem with this country. But, but I mean, that's what it is. We're days away right now. I'm excited to get into the latest news.

0:
Jordy, I loving the, loving the costume right now. Did you even know it was Halloween or, or did you just dress up like this? Well, a few things to get off my chest real quick. When you guys set me up, I mean, we talked about this, we said that we were all going to dress up for the Halloween episode. We FaceTimed about it. So I don't even have text message receipts. You can only just take my word for it. So never, I told you guys what I was gonna be. Brett, you were dressing up. I'm the only one dressed up right now for the audio listeners. Happy Halloween, everybody. I don't know. I can't believe the brother set me up like this, but I'm super excited. Yeah, I'm an astronaut. My son Elijah, it's his first Halloween. He's an alien. We're going trick or treating right after this. We're super excited. Wait, can I, can I ask you about this? Because if you have a child who is like, you know, under a year old, right?

0:
And you're taking him trick or treating, it's kind of like, like kind of you're, you are just trick or treating. It's a good point. You know, holding him, it's kind of just you asking for candy and even say trick or treat. So I guess, yeah, I'm just the, the 3-year-old dressed up in the costume knocking on people's doors saying trick or treat. Yeah, it's gonna be an awkward situation. Yeah, I didn't think that one through Benji, where do we wanna start off today? Donald Trump dressing up, not because of Halloween, but because of some inside Twitter trying to own the libs with some inside Twitter echo chamber crap that President Biden said that it was a garbage statement that, that Donald Trump would call the people of Puerto Rico garbage. And that infe offended Maga.

0:
So then they wanted to say, let's all dress up like garbage men for the day. And so that's how Donald Trump dressed up and, and like most normal Americans have no clue what the hell he's talking about at all. And like, why you dressed up like it? It seems like he's mocking even more the Puerto Rican community and Latinos who his campaign has called garbage, floating garbage and other words like that. So Donald Trump dresses like that. He's in a garbage truck. He's apparently never opened the door, by the way. Look at the sycophants like behind him, like you have Boris Stein and then you have Byron Donalds, like, they're taking pictures of like, like legitimately a clown.

0:
Like his skin color right there is is is like absolutely ridiculous. This is a real photo. This isn't Photoshop, this is really what he looks like. And, and it's like, what the hell are we even looking at there? So then he tries to open up the, the door of a garbage truck. He can do that. And what we've been saying all along and I said, look, I take it seriously when he's on stage in other speeches and it looks like he's relieving himself, it looks like he's defecating on himself. And he's done that before when he was in office. You know, he relieves himself. You see it happening. I go, look, I'm just calling it out because I'm not going to close my eyes and cover my ears to this reality.

0:
So just for example, watch what happened yesterday as he tries to get in the truck, play it. So then he's asked that for those who are listening on audio, he's dragging his like right leg, he misses trying to grab the door like twice it looks like he's going to like fall down. I'm not gonna show the part of his speech because it's like three minutes along where he talks about his adrenaline was rushing as he tried to open up the door and he acts like literally getting into a car seat was this massive undertaking just 'cause it's total to, to be fair, it appeared like a massive undertaking for him.

0:
He appeared to really struggle with it. So maybe in his mind it, it was indeed a massive undertaking. And that leg is something that we've actually been keeping track of now for what, like over four years. I think. Like I remember us posting clips of him dragging that right leg during at the Covid facilities. He would drag his right leg. And Ron Philip Kowski, the editor in chief at Midas Touch has been tracking this and keeps asking the question like, what is going on with Donald Trump's right leg? Why does he keep dragging it? What is happening there? Is there a greater health issue there? And it's all the more curious because Donald Trump refuses to release his medical records and we still have no idea what the heck is going on with him and why he has the issues speaking that he has, why he has the issues walking that he has.

0:
Like there's clearly something going on there that they don't want people to know. They don't want me people to know whatever kind of medications he's on or what's actually wrong with him, or what actually happened at Walter Reed Hospital while he was president. So there's a lot of mystery around this. And when you see incidents like that, it just brings more questions to the forefront of the discussion. Exactly right, Brett, look, we don't show these clips, you know, to be crude, to be to be mean, but really to alert the American people, Hey, this person who wants the nuclear codes again, has not provided his medical records. We don't know his health conditions going into these next, what this election cycle. So how can we actively and, and just give him the codes and all of our documents and our nation's secrets.

0:
If he's unwilling to even share his medical history with the country, they're out there saying, well, vice President Kamala Harris's plans for providing tax deductions to small businesses. Can you provide a detail how, how that will offset potential budget deficit increases? I mean, Donald Trump added $8 trillion in debt. I mean, just think about like 30% of all debt was caused by Donald Trump, but that's how vice President Kamala Harris gets treated. Front page stories about that. Donald Trump's out there talking about like Arnold Palmer's penis. He's out there saying, Hey, did you see I did a weave? I did a weave. He's saying how he, he'd rather be electrocuted than eaten by sharks.

0:
Like quite literally, if you had someone in your family who was like this, you would probably say that they are really unwell, that they have some si some sort of serious dementia, you know, Alzheimer's, that this is someone who suffered from many strokes, like you see it, you would have concerns. So I don't have to be like, you know, something is wrong with this sicko and frankly it is wrong not to call out what's happening. So anyway, as part of Donald Trump's closing message, he gets in a garbage truck and then he is asked questions. So he is asked like, Hey, you know your surrogate at a campaign event in Madison Square Garden called Futo Rico floating trash and made other horrible comments about the Latino community.

0:
So what's your response that here's what Donald Trump says.

3:
What do I, what? What did you think about the comedian show? I don't know anything about the comedian. I don't know who he is. I've never seen him. I heard he made a statement, but it was just a statement that he made. He's a comedian. What can I tell you? I know nothing about him. I don't know why he's there. You put comedians up and I guess he went on earlier the show. I don't know who he is. Did you campaign with you?

0:
I dunno who he is, it's just a statement that he made. Well, at the very least, you now know what the statement is, right? Wouldn't a leader condemn the statement and say, those statements don't reflect what my values are, but no, for Donald Trump? I don't know. I don't know who he is. Remember same thing he said with Michael Cohen. I don't know what Michael Coen just my lawyer. I don't know what pay, that's what he does. Covid like a miracle. It's all gonna go away. And by the way, Ben, let's not, let's not forget that that speaker wasn't the only speaker who said something off base. It was literally every single speaker, including Donald Trump at this event. They said reprehensible things about Puerto Ricans, about all Latinos, about African Americans, about Jews, about Palestinians.

0:
Every speaker said something that was more horrific than the next. And then Donald Trump came on stage and called all Americans who oppose him, the enemy of the people. So that's the context of the entire event. It was one big hate fest from start to finish. It was deranged. And that's why you had Donald Trump come out and say, oh, it was love. It was love, it was all love. It was a love fest. Everybody loved it. Everyone was so happy and just loving in there. I, I don't, not sure I agree with your definition of love there, but okay. Donald Trump continues to call the United States garbage and trash as well. That's part of his closing message. America's trash. We're the trash of the world. America's crap, America's trash. This is over, over and over again. No, America's a great country.

0:
America is an amazing place and it is so sad and disappointing to run a campaign With that as your closing message, I'm here by the way, Donald Trump says one of the reason that he's in a garbage truck is he says, because the word garbage is one of the hottest things right now. It's a sexy word. He goes, here, play this clip.

3:
And one of my people came in and said, sir, you know, the word garbage is the hottest thing right now out there. The hottest thing out there, sir, would you like to drive a garbage truck?

0:
Garbage? I mean, honestly, does everybody in that audience have brain worms? What is going there? There's not even afu. Like it's not funny. What is funny about garbage being the hottest word? Ha ha. Like it's legitimately not funny at all. And the fact that he keeps, he's dressed like that. The whole thing is, is like quite literally watching a psychotic individual and know that doesn't make me a liberal or a progressive or conservative or independent, that I'm just observing something that is objectively crazy and calling crazy, crazy. And look, this stuff beyond the craziness has real life implications on you.

0:
I mean, you have Donald Trump's top surrogate magnum, Mike Johnson in no uncertain terms saying that he's going to put a blow torch to healthcare and he is gonna rip away the healthcare from tens of millions of Americans when he's speaking with frat boys who probably are on their parents' healthcare plans so that, because it'll get ripped away from them. And don't realize where that healthcare is coming from, how they got that provision. By the way, that was Tammy Baldwin, a democratic senator who put that provision in the Affordable Care Act. That's why these frat kids are getting their healthcare. Otherwise, good luck.

0:
That's what it used to be before good freaking luck. So the fact that you have MAGA mic up there, you know, you know, with with the glasses and the whole shtick being like, oh, we we're gonna have to take a blowtorch to it. Oh, that's people's lives. You're talking about killing people. Like they're talking about murdering you and killing you. 'cause that's what it means if they rip away your healthcare right here, Play the clip.

5:
There's a lot of talk. I mean, healthcare reform's gonna be a big part of the agenda when I say we're gonna have a very aggressive verse hundred days agenda. We got a lot of things though on the table. But healthcare's secret, that's part, it's the secret. s secret Healthcare forms not a secret. There's some, there's some really important ideas on the table. And we have a, a docs caucus, physicians who serve in the house and they've got a menu of options about this thick. And I think this is part of it because if you take government bureaucrats out of the healthcare equation and you have doctor patient relationship, it's better for everybody. More efficient, more effective. That's the free market. Trump's gonna be for the free market. You heard a little sample of that last night. We wanna take a blow torch to the regulatory state. Okay? Yeah. I mean these agencies are weaponized against the people and it's, it's, it's crushing the free market.

5:
It's like a boot on the neck of job creators and entrepreneurs and risk takers. And so healthcare is one of the sectors, but we need this across the board. And Trump's gonna go big. I mean, he's only gonna have one more turn, right? Can't run for reelection, right? And so he's gonna be thinking about legacy and we're gonna, we're gonna fix these things. No, no Obamacare, no world heard of it. Yeah, the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work. And we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.

0:
I mean, you heard what he just said there. Is there any ambiguity there at all? No more Obamacare, he says, and he says the Affordable Care Act is so deeply embedded in the type of regulatory framework that they want to get rid of. I mean, he's saying that, you know, and then when they're asked about it later, 'cause people are like, wait a minute, do you want to get rid of healthcare? What do they say? Oh, I never said that. That's actually not what, you're just taking a snippet of what I'm saying when you say no more Obamacare, that means to people that they could die. So you, you, you're playing around with that or like when Donald Trump goes, I'm just gonna be a dictator on day one. I just said, I just said day one, it's a joke, right?

0:
You can, the history of governments and dictatorship in a presidential election is not a funny joke, number one. So it's, it's not something that you joke with dictatorship. And then he says it's serious. There's nothing, there's no joke tone in what he's saying. And he's running for the highest office as former president Barack Obama said, every word that you say when you're running should be dissected and it matters. That's how it is for Democrats Ben here. Here's the crazy thing. So then you have like Trump to your point posting this morning. He goes, lion Kamala is giving a news conference now saying that I want to end the Affordable Care Act. I never mentioned that, never even thought about such a thing.

0:
Like how could you say that with a straight face? That was kind of your whole thing that you tried to do throughout your entire presidency. You even used the words quote, I want to terminate healthcare. At one point during your presidency, at multiple press conferences, you said you want to get rid of healthcare on your website right now as we speak. It says you want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have MAGA Mike saying, I want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And now you're for Obamacare. That's what, that's your lie that you like Obamacare. I mean, is anybody buying this crap from this guy at this point? It's just patently absurd on its face. Like these are the things that he's supposedly fought for. And I thought this was a guy who just speaks his mind and tells it straight.

0:
But what he does is he gives sound bites on every side of the issue so that he could be like, oh look, no, I said I was for that. No. Look, I said I was for, oh, you thought I wanted to punish women for abortions? No. Let me point you to this other statement where I said I didn't ignore the statements where I said that women should be locked up. Ignore those for now. Ignore the fact that that's actually happening in states across the country. Ignore that because this other time I said this other thing, it's how he kind of plays the media also because then they do these BS fact checks and they go, well actually Donald Trump actually tweeted today that he doesn't want to get rid of the affordable charact. And I'm like, okay, are we, we're doing this. This is what we're doing right now. Media. Really, really, are you going to be serious people or is this what you're gonna do? Corporate media has been abysmal in this entire process leading up to the 2020 election.

0:
The 2022 midterms, and now 2024. Once again, they are failures failing. Every time they have an opportunity to fail, they fail. That's why the growth of this network and this entire community has been so frigging awesome on our way to three million subscribers. Make sure you subscribe to the YouTube channel, Brett. What's up? Can, can, can I give you an example? Like there was, New York Times wrote an incredible story like last week, right? They broke the John Kelly story about John Kelly saying that Donald Trump adored Hitler and wanted Hitler's general. Like the New York Times broke that story. It ended up somewhere in, in the middle of their newspaper, not a front page story that ended up like on a 12 or a 14 or something like that.

0:
But Donald, but Joe Biden's comments, the garbage comments, which by the way, if it's actually quoted correctly, he was clearly just speaking about the comedian who made the garbage comments. Like totally, they're, they're, they're, they're misappropriating an a, an apostrophe that made the front page of the New York Times. Got it. And that's one of the things that's so maddening to me because I'm like, listen, you have reporters who are doing really good work, right? Really good work, really good work, work. Why are you burying it in the middle of the paper? And then the crappy stuff you're putting on the front page, just, it just reminds me of the stuff they did with Hillary back in 2016. And it's, it's very clear that none of these organizations have learned their lesson one bit.

Let's face it, after night with drinks, I don't bounce back the next day like I used to. Hey, I gotta be honest with myself, right?

Every time I have pre-cool before drinks, I notice a difference the next day, for example, after a fun night out with friends at like a local bar or wherever we go, I could still get up the next morning and hit the gym. And I'll admit I was skeptical at first, but I tried it at a dinner party with some friends, and the next morning I felt great, ready to tackle the day, ready to do more videos here at the Midas Touch Network. I kept hearing about pre-cool and wondered what it was actually like. Now that I've tried it, I get the Hype.

This is like a real, like, just stand up. This is like wow looking Jordy. Okay, Jordy is now flying. Jordy is now flying across this guys, this is a, the vibes light on this episode. That's what we're doing where everyone and every I, I feel the tense. I feel people being tense.

0:
Let's, let's, you know, good vibes, we good vibes, good vibes. So one of the things we're also learning is Donald Trump going to appoint RFK junior to multiple cabinet positions, particularly cabinet positions over agriculture as well as HHS over health services. And of course, having an anti-vaxxer there is probably not the best person to put in that position, but he intends to gut all of those cabinet positions and departments. Elon Musk, Donald Trump will appoint as an economy czar. And Elon Musk says that he is going to cut two to three, I think it was like two to $3 trillion from the budget.

0:
Meaning all of your services will be eliminated, the things that government's supposed to do for we the people and say goodbye. So say goodbye to Social security. That's one of the first things that will go say goodbye. Not only to healthcare. Say goodbye to Medicare, say goodbye to all, all of that. It will be gone the same way Elon Musk has gutted X or Twitter. That's what's gonna happen to your services. I mean, there's numerous independent analysts who have said social security under the Trump Musk plan has about five to six years left. So depending on where you are in receiving social security benefits or where you expect to be, that won't exist anymore.

0:
So whereas under Vice President Kamala Harris's plan, your freedoms will be protected, extended, and we will build upon the economic gains that have existed. You are not going to have healthcare under Donald Trump. He has concepts of it, but you're not going to have it and you're going to lose your social security. And, and then what? Oh, we, but he, we didn't believe him when he said it. We, Elon Musk is on audio talking about the hardships that are going to be inflicted on you. What, why, why would you vote for someone who's inflicting hardships artificial hardships on you?

0:
Why here play this clip?

6:
You have to reduce spending to live within our means and yeah, that, that necessarily involves some, some temporary hardship, but, but it, it will ensure long-term prosperity.

0:
I I just wanna be clear about the state of the economy right now. I mean, there's been a lot of economic data that's been released. You know, you know here, this, this was the wall, this is the Financial Times US consumers, we'll pull up the financial time. US consumers keep economy on course as election looms. We just learned GDP growth was up about 2.8 to 3% here. Here's how the Wall Street Journal phrased that on October 31st, the next president inherits a remarkable economy. The high quality of recent economic growth should put a wind at the back of the White House's next occupant.

0:
And this is what's in the article. Pull up that article one more time, with another solid performance in the third quarter. The US has grown 2.7% over the past year. It is outrunning every other major developed economy, not to mention its own historical growth rate, and also by historical growth rate. They mean that even if you take away the pandemic, if you pretend that didn't occur and Donald Trump didn't mishandle it, which, when, when we do analysis, do we just re just remove that? Give Donald Trump a mulligan. Even if you remove it, we've peaked past all financial expectations before the pandemic.

0:
So if the pandemic, you know, you know what I just realized? They, they do that with all Republican administrations where they try to give a mulligan on anything bad that happens. Do you remember the line that the media would parrot and that George W. Bush would say when he was running and he would be like, listen, there were no terrorist attacks under my administration. If you take out nine 11, you take a nine 11 there. I'm like, I'm like, you take out nine 11. It's kind of, kind of a big deal, man. You can't just take it out. And, and Donald Trump and his surrogates, and oftentimes the media wants to take out that entire year where Donald Trump completely screwed over the economy, killed hundreds of thousands or millions of people with his mishandling of covid, with his just reckless disregard for human life, for testing and this economy thing.

0:
Honestly, Ben Jordy like really stresses me out because here, like the fact is the United States economy is quite literally the number one in the entire world, the number one in the entire world after Covid. So while republicans want to talk about the economy and act like there's some economic catastrophe out there, act like we're in a depression. We're actually in a incredible, an incredibly prosperous time in the United States, and we are faring far better than literally every other developed nation in the entire world. Number one should mean something here. And it's not to say that things are perfect. It's not to say that supply chains didn't get messed up after covid and that there's still a a bit of a shock period and things are still in the process of returning to normal.

0:
However, we are quite literally the number one economy in the world with also in addition to full employ, full employment, we also have a record stock market. It's like by every, every measure, every single measure, the US economy is the best, the best in the entire world. And I'm just sick of this like phony act that there's like all these issues with the economy and that we're in some sort of issue or something. I, i I, and maybe it should be, I go to like Trader Joe's. Eggs are a dollar 99, eggs are a dollar 99 by me. So it's like, what, what is it? What are we complaining about here? We have prices coming down, we have inflation at historically low rates now. And the inflation that did happen was quite literally caused by Donald Trump.

0:
So are we gonna give the drunk driver who crashed the car, backed the keys? Is that what we're gonna do? And here's a crazy stat as well. If Kamala Harris wins, when Kamala Harris wins, she will be the first Democratic president to come into office maybe ever, or at least in modern American history that is actually entering office with a good economy. Because we've seen the cycle. It's the same cycle every single time where Republican comes in crashes, the economy Democrat comes in, has to deal with that crashed economy after four years, eight years, the economy gets back on track, is the envy of the world. And people say, I'm not sure this is all that good. And then they put in another Republican and then it crashes once again.

0:
And then it's the same process over and over and over. Don't be bamboozled folks. Don't be bamboozled. It's why you need adults in the room. And it's why when you see experts like the former, you know, CEO speaking out saying, Hey, the economy will be better under President Kamala Harris versus another presidency of Donald Trump. It's very clear who I wanna listen to. I wanna listen to business experts. Remember when Trump had the business, had the meeting with the CEOs and they, he was gonna use that as his big look. All these CEOs, they're endorsing, they left outta that meeting saying that he doesn't have a plan for the economy. That they were actually, he's quite literally telling you Jordy, that he wants to raise prices by 2000%.

Like the guy doesn't even know what a tariff is. I mean, seriously, people come on here and the choice couldn't be more clear. Well then look, I mean for me too, there's also some basic things that I know don't Get a lot of attention. But I think you have to talk about, like Donald Trump believes that climate change is a hoax the same way Donald Trump said, COVID is a hoax. Donald Trump gave a speech and called electric vehicle in Albuquerque, New Mexico before he gave a speech and said that electric vehicles, he goes, EV is like the Gestapo. I, I don't even know, I don't even know what that even means. Donald Trump goes around and says, you know, if any, if even if global warming was real, he says, that would, it would be a great thing 'cause you would get more beachfront property, which doesn't even make any sense if you would lose beachfront property.

0:
But that's besides the point. It's not a good thing. We see it's catastrophic effects when Donald Trump is, is trying to talk about these devastating hurricanes like Hurricane Helene, where he goes to a devastation zone and accepts these little, like he, he got a french fry award in a devastation zone and was holding it up like he actually won something for some stupid McDonald's publicity stunt. The way he describes hurricanes is as big water storms. He goes, they call 'em water storms, big water storms. No one's ever seen anything like them. Nobody could ever expect this. Yes, they can. They can expect it.

0:
Science can expect these things. And here's the thing also, you know, I did this interview with someone by the name of Chad Ood, who's the politics editor of Detroit News. I mean, there are ev plants in Michigan, you know, in places like Detroit where these were factories that were shut down and people were losing jobs when Trump was in office. And now with America leading the way in developing new technologies and then new technologies around the new technology. So you talk about electric vehicles, but then you also have to talk about the semiconductors that are sometimes used in these electric vehicles.

0:
And then you learn, well wait a minute, Kamala Harris and President Biden did the CHIPS Act, which in addition to the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act, which invested in these types of manufacturing plants, well now there's also an investment in the semiconductor industry. So it's all kind of comes together. And what that means is that's where these jobs are coming from. In New York Times did this report, clean energy is booming in the US and the election can change that. And one of the things it talks about that's booming is US factory construction or at its highest levels that there's a manufacturing boom right now. So this is good for our economy, it's getting people to work more, it's creating more jobs and it's good for the world.

0:
And that hat trick of good is in, in bizarro world is viewed as bad for Donald Trump. So then Trump and them go drill baby Joe Drew baby. Well, okay, well if that's your standard also, there's more drilling right now than when Donald Trump was in office America for the first time is energy Independent, which we were not under Donald Trump. America is the world's largest oil producer, which we were not under Donald Trump, never before has more oil been extracted than currently right now. But we can also be smart about it and talk like adults.

0:
And it's like Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Wal, here's the plan, here's the details, here's what we did, here's how we're gonna expand upon it. Let's go through it. Donald, Donald Trump goes Jew, baby drill, brack, brack like a duck frack, frack frack like a duck. And I'm, and I'm just thinking to myself, what the hell, what the hell even is that? But that, but that's what he does. I mean, that's what he does when he talks about fracking. He doesn't have a policy. He goes, Frank, F Frank, f Frank, f Frank, like a duck, like a duck. Frank F. Frank frack. And I'm watching this and I'm like, this isn't, this is not th th this stuff isn't funny. And then the stuff that he was saying yesterday, whether women like it or not, vice President Kam Harris put out an ad on this.

0:
He's like, I tell women I'm going to protect you. And so my, and he goes, so my campaign says, maybe you shouldn't say that about women with, with everything that you, you you've done. And I go, no, I say, I'm gonna protect them even if they don't want me, whether they like it or not, I'm gonna do what I wanna do with them. That's what he's saying. That's what he's messaging here, play this clip.

3:
They said, sir, I just think it's inappropriate for you to say. I said, well, I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not, I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not, whether the women like it or not, whether the women like it or

7:
Not, whether the women like it or not, whether the women like it or not, I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not.

0:
And then for those listening on audio, it's showing everything that's happened to women since Roe v. Wade has been overturned, talking about all of Donald Trump's despicable conduct towards women, you know, but the, the the, the, the crazy thing is Brett and Jordy too, and the Midas mighty in this kind of upside down world is that something like this that I'm about to show you will not even make by far 0% chance other than Midas touch will make any news network. It, it's just, this is Trump and this is who his people are. That Donald Trump's top surrogate Amber Rose, who gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, right?

0:
She was one of the key people that he highlighted as this is what the Republican Party is as part of her being a surrogate for Donald Trump, right? While Vice President Kamala Harris has all these surrogates out in swing districts and restaurants like helping people trump's surrogate, Amber Rose is doing events at strip clubs for Donald Trump. And it is the we f Trump or we f with Trump tour and for those listening it with in very small writing. Yeah, yeah. It's the, the width you could barely even see. So it looks like it says, we fuck Trump is how it looks. And I'm sorry for cursing, but I think there's a newsworthy nature of me saying this. How, how dare And then, and then the photograph is Amber Rose holding her breasts, and then another lady with her legs spread open and her breasts hanging out.

0:
And it says that the event the we fuck Trump event is in the Peppermint Hippo, Las Vegas strip club. So this is what our politics is in these United States of America. Very conservative, very, very, I guess I must be a ver I must be a radical leftist and lefty who looks at this and goes, you know what? So people wanna do this in their private life. And if pe I'm not trying to shame this stuff, you know, but I will say for our politics, for the example we're trying to set for generations, when we're talking about a political campaign for the presidency, the fact that this won't even be a freaking story anywhere else, I mean, to me, tells you the rot and decay that's been inflicted upon our country.

0:
But look, there's a way out. Like we don't have to be trapped in this craziness. Like there is a way forward. And the way, and that's Vice President Kamala Harris's message is like, we can actually get past this. Like, we don't have to wake up every day and get like Trump posts where he's like, oh, there's fraud in Pennsylvania. I caught them cheating and dah dah, dah, dah, dah. They're cheaters. And that's why they, we, we can actually just grow up and live normal lives. We don't have to be sucked into this. That's what I wanna talk about in the next segment of this episode is there's a path forward, there's a way out, there's a solution here.

0:
And I think what we're seeing is females, but also Republicans, Republican females, but females, Republicans, independent, classic Republicans, independents, democrats, progressives, and people who don't even like care about politics are just like, enough, enough, let's move forward. No more of this Trump chaos. Why would you want that chaos? We'll be right back after our last quick break.

Show 'em some love. They're fantastic. Love them all. Benji, where to next? I just want to give you all insight into our thinking about how we process early voting, poll numbers and data. Not to push this poll or that poll, but I think to really give you a framework for the types of things that I'm looking at. So as you know, first and foremost for me it's about really getting experts on this program.

0:
That's why I bring on Simon Rosenberg, Tom Bonier from Target Smart Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist to Bush Cheney, got disenchanted with them, but then was like Schwartzenegger guy and, and now big in the pro-democracy movement. But I mean he's as close to this poll stuff as you can be in, in interpreting this data. 'cause he knew based on where Bush Cheney were against Kerry, that it would be about a two and a half, three point win back there. He's just an undisputed expert in this field. And you know, and I would say, you know, he's, he's a pro-democracy guy. I think he's part of this new movement where yeah, he can be a Democrat, but what, but what's Trump's to me, he's not a Republican.

0:
I mean he's just a, a maga you know, then when I go into swing states, I speak to people like Chad Livengood, right from the Detroit News. Who knows that data, who knows the cities and the counties and the demographics. I mean the types of convos that I'm having with Chad are at a micro level over specific factories being built and how that's being messaged for these 800 to 1200 voters. That's how micro, you know, I like to get. And so for me, I always wanna start with a framework of where have actual voters voted recently. Like to me that's an important data point.

0:
And so one thing that I look to is the primaries. And I wanna see what was Donald Trump doing with the 5 38 averages? Was he overperforming? Was he underperforming? You know, and there I see Nikki Haley getting about 15 to 20% of the vote Donald Trump underperforming in these various primaries. I mean, we're showing you a graphic right here from Pennsylvania where, or this one's from Michigan, from Tom Bonner, the other one's from Pennsylvania. And this one trump's 42 point margin in Michigan. It fell 15 points short of the final 5 38 poll average. So you all heard the terms. Now throw it in the average, what do the averages say?

0:
'cause if you just put all these polls and you jumble 'em in an average, that's probably right. No, just think about it in the primaries. And I'm not, I I I'm not suggesting that I think this will be 15 points off. Again, I'm just letting you know that in a vote involving Donald Trump and Nikki Haley recently the vote was 15 points in variance of Donald with what Donald Trump was a projected to have. It overestimated Donald Trump by what actually happened. So then you look again in Pennsylvania and we saw the same thing. Nikki Halley got nearly 17% of the vote despite dropping out six weeks ago.

0:
She got about 155,000 votes with 98% being reported, you know, as, as as of this post right here. And Democrats had a much higher turn. So that's kind of when I'm thinking about it, I'm trying to draw at least comparisons to like, okay, well what happened recently? Okay, so then I wanna find out how have early voters voted al already. Like what is their current voting behavior? And I'll look in the swing states. So when people are polled, how have you voted? I think it is important to note that there are more Republicans out there who are voting early than before.

0:
What we're seeing is a lot of same day voters from 2020 Republicans since they're now being encouraged to vote early, they're voting early in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where even though democrats have a lead in terms of raw vote totals, it's not as significant as it was in 2020 where literally like no Republican voted early in the all voted same day. So it's a little bit different. But what we know is, and this has been remarkably steady from all of the polls, about five or six of them all show this amongst the population who have actually voted right? 'cause we know what they've done, they've made the decision, they've gone in and we've seen whether it was CNN Marist, Ipsos, New York Times a b, whatever it was, it was always in this like 15 to 22 point range of Vice President Kamala Harris leading amongst the population of people who have already voted.

0:
So I look here at an SSRS, they do very big samples. So it's not like these 500 persons that they do large samples, what they're known for. So you take a look at Michigan Harris up 27, Wisconsin Harris up 22, Pennsylvania Harris up 17 among people who have already voted. So I go to myself, that's at least a significant data point. Should I draw into it something deeper? I I don't, I don't, I don't wanna go there and go, oh, spike the football. Like that's what the Republicans, you know, would do. Well we got this. No, not, not, not at all. I'm just viewing that as, as I'm starting to try to work out and build, is, is it a trend?

0:
Because if those numbers were in the opposite direction, it'd be very hard to say we were doing good. We, I, we, we'd have to say, well let's just hope some miracle happens on election day so we can come from behind. Right? Now, you take a look right here at the gender gap, at a nationwide level, the gender gap's about eight in favor of females over males. But what's interesting to me is when you go into most of the swing states, and not all, but most, it's more than that plus eight, right? Which tells me is something going on in these swing states with women voters?

0:
And does this look like a post row v wade being overturned election that we would cover frequently here, where we would say, whoa, it looks like Democrats were far outperforming the polls once again. Or does this look like 2016 or 2020 where it looked like Donald Trump overperformed where he was put in the polls? So that's one of the things I'm interested about. So I'm looking at the demographic of voters, and we know this from the target smart data about we, this goes in a database and it's compiled. So this isn't conjecture. We know that these numbers are correct. It's not like I've sampled 600 people and then I've created my own kind of framework and said, okay, the voting pattern's gonna look, no, this, this is actually voters, right?

0:
So Pennsylvania females plus 13 over men Michigan females plus 12 Wisconsin females plus eight Georgia females, plus 12 North Carolina females plus 12, and then lagging in Arizona females plus four, and in Nevada males plus one. Now, can I draw any type of like massive points from that? I, and I don't think I can. But what I am starting to kind of let you know is I am starting to see trends. One of the other thing, and this comes from politico's analysis of early voting data in Pennsylvania.

0:
Now this is hard data. So one of the things I'm looking at too is in these states, is any party creating new voters, right? Because I wanna see, are these just return voters who voted in the 2020 election? Are there any new voters that are being created? Because you would think that if all things remain the same and people turned out for Kamala and the people turned out for Trump in proportionate numbers, that's not enough for Trump, right? So Trump's thesis is that he's going to create new voters and you know, what's a little bit pejoratively called low propensity voters, people who don't vote as much.

0:
That's why Donald Trump is targeting low propensity voters. And I think he kind of does it in like kind of overtly racist ways. Look, you love sneakers, don't you love sneakers? I'll make sneakers for you. You know, and shit like that. That to me is just pure trash. But that's how Trump thinks about creating voters there. And the question is, are the, you know, and that's why you hear these narratives, you know, and sometimes in these polls, they'll buy into the hype that Trump's created new voters, right? So you'll see what's called like the cross tabs and they'll have, oh, they think that black voters and black males are gonna go towards Trump in a much massive number than we haven't seen before in prior elections.

0:
And it's like, well what are you basing that on? And it's kind of like, well, we just think that's the trend. And so then when you call people and you speak with a black male, you give that an added weight in your poll and then you extrapolate that at large within the voter sample. And that's kind of how these pollsters arrive at, you know, arrive at those numbers. But, but to me What I'm focused on is, are you creating new voters? So I thought this part of politico's analysis of the actual data in Pennsylvania found this, that women registered as Democrats made up nearly a third of early votes this year from people who did not vote in the state in 2020.

0:
So I want you to think about that. These are new voters being created versus election day voters who are now voting early, which in a state like Pennsylvania, we are seeing with the Republican party. So are Democrats creating new voters. And finally, one of the things that we built our thesis on here is this idea, whether you called it a Nikki Haley voter, whether you call it a Midas voter, whether you call it just a classic Republican slash independent or just an anti chaos, pron normalcy, pro-democracy, voter, whatever label you want to see.

0:
The question that I'm trying to analyze and see is how much of that Nikki Haley vote, that seemed to be a protest vote to Donald Trump, is Vice President Kamala Harris going to win over? So when I look at Nikki Haley's margins in all of the primaries, many of them closed primaries, they far exceed the margins that Biden won in 2020 in those same exact states. So for me, the question is, if Vice President Kamala Harris can remain around even with Biden, and by the way, when we go in and look at a micro level at some of these congressional districts, in the congressional district ones, she's beating Biden in these very micro ones where you can cast big samples.

0:
And because they're smaller congressional districts, you can get that, you can get that analysis, you know, at a, usually at a more correct and refined level where she's outperforming him. She's also outperforming in like college educated white voters. She seems to also be outperforming him in, in, in other white voters as well, and of course in know in in women. So to me, that's an important piece of my analysis. And then my question is, was it 30% of Nikki, assume 30% of Nikki Haley voters now crossover, and let's just say that it it's just 30%. That means you add that 30%. And if she can hold those Biden numbers, can she do that?

0:
Now, my purpose of going through that exercise with you is to let you know how I think we should process info. I'm not trying to say this is a spike, the football or whatever. I just want to give, I think to you, and, and I spend so much time on this, a framework to analyze data and critically think when all of these junk polls and scammy betting markets, betting markets, and all these things are pushed in your face, I think you have to take agency over the data and ask yourself, am I getting good data?

0:
Am I getting crap data? And, and what should I be looking for? So I, I leave you with that thought because even over Friday, over the weekend on Monday, you're gonna be inundated worse than 2022 with some of the stuff that's gonna make you completely lose your mind. And it's intended to do that, to try to suppress your vote. So don't let it, number one, let it motivate you, and then go, and then go out there and, and help be the difference maker. You can change history right now with what you can do.

So please watch your live, you're not gonna wanna miss the depth of coverage, you're not gonna see it anywhere else. So make sure you tune in then. That's what I got for all of you. I wanna thank everybody for watching. Sorry if I was a bit verbose there on the end, but I thought it was important to, to data framework.

0:
The the data is helpful and I think the data, you know, looks good, but you know, that doesn't mean you slow down when data looks good, that means now it's all gas, no breaks, and we all just gotta work super hard because there's just so much at stake this election. I, I know it's said every election, but it's very serious this time. Like the stakes are just so high. And I've never seen a campaign that was just so brazen about what they intend to do about the harm that they plan to inflict on the American people. Like they're saying it out loud, which is one of the craziest things like, just look at the closing message in the past few days, right? You have Elon Musk saying that everyday Americans are going to have to face necessary hardships under Trump.

0:
That's what Donald Trump's own surrogate is saying as a good thing that people, that everyday Americans are going to have to face hardships under Donald Trump if they wanna get America back on track. America's leading the world, America's leading the world, and this billionaire wants to inflict pain on regular Americans so that he could get richer and then he could control the levers of the government. I mean, can we just think about that for a second? So you have them saying that him saying that they're going to inflict all of this, you know, pain on everybody, strip away all these government programs. You have Mike Johnson openly saying that he plans to take away your healthcare and take a blowtorch to all these government programs that people rely on on a daily basis.

0:
You have Trump saying that he is going to prosecute anybody who opposes him, that he is going to raise prices by 2000%, start trade wars, which are going to crash the economy round up migrants with quote, this is, these are his words with bloody deportations. And then he says, it doesn't matter whether they're legal or illegal because the people who he doesn't like who are here legally, he's gonna kick them out also because he actually doesn't think that they should be legal. So he's, they're gonna be part of this. He's gonna throw him into camps, he's gonna kick him out the country. I mean, this, this is the sixth step that they're saying out loud. You have Steve Bannon saying that they're going to put Laura Loomer in as press secretary. And, and these are the things they are saying out loud that they are going to do you Vice President Harris saying that she's going to be a president for all Americans, that she's going to seek to unify the country, that she's going to pass policies to help Americans like help first time home buyers with money to go towards their buying their home, to lower taxes for the middle class.

0:
Like tangible things, protect reproductive rights. And these are things that people deal with all the time. And I really just, I don't believe this media narrative that has been perpetuated that women are over it. Women are over Dobbs, they don't care anymore. They've moved on. I I don't buy it. Not for one second. And I think the data Ben that you were sharing, I I, I think bears that out because these are issues, healthcare issues that women and families, by the way, all Americans have to deal with on a very frequent basis. And I don't think a lot of people realize how all of these factors and all of these draconian laws affect just regular procedures that women have to go through frequently throughout their lives.

0:
And they are really hurting people. They are threatening doctors. Doctors are afraid to do procedures that they've done forever because of Donald Trump and because of maga mike and because of these Republicans. I don't believe for one second that women and that even the men in these women's lives are willing to sell out their families like that, sell out the women in their lives like that. I just, I'm, I'm not buying that. They're just, oh yeah, whatever. What are we gonna do? I'm gonna, I'm gonna vote because my, my eggs were 50 cents more this week. I i, I just, I can't fathom that. But you know, we're all gonna have to fight, right? We're all gonna have to do everything we possibly can in these next, what is it? Four days? Five, four. It's crazy.

0:
We got this, we got this. Good vibes. Good vibes. Yeah. That's it. That's, that's, that's my shtick. Thank you everybody. I, look, look, we're, we're in. Here's the thing, we're not going anywhere. We are in this together. It has been an absolute honor to be a part of this community with all of you. No matter what happens, we're not going anywhere. We are here with you.
