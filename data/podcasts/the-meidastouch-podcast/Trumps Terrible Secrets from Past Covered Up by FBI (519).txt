Today,

Donald Trump's head of FBI is Cash Patel. And the number two is Dan Bonino. These are both right wing nut jobs who had these bizarro podcasts where they spread lies and dangerous conspiracies, but they gave a sit down interview, both of them together. Oh, by the way, didn't they attack former Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Walls for doing a sit down interview together? Like two of them, eh, whatever. There's nothing really consistent with these s. Anyway, you had Bonino and Patel doing a sit down interview together, and here's what they were asked by Fox's Maria Barter Roma.

2:
Watch this. You said

3:
Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. People don't believe

4:
It. Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion, but as someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know, a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was,

5:
He killed himself. You again, you want me to get, I've, I've, I've seen the whole file. He killed

2:
Himself, which is very interesting for their response because who were some of the big purveyors of the conspiracies regarding Epstein? Oh, may I show you Exhibit A, what Donald Trump said to Tucker Carlson,

6:
But possibly he didn't. Do you think it's possible that Epstein was killed? Oh, sure, it's possible. I, I mean, I don't really believe, I think he probably committed suicide. He had a life with, you know, beautiful homes and beautiful everything and he, all of a sudden he's incarcerated and not doing very well. I would say that he did. But there are those people. There are many people, I think you're one of 'em, right? But a lot of people think that he, he was killed. He knew a lot on a lot of people. He was killed. You think

2:
So? Hmm? May I show you Exhibit B Dan Bonino on his podcast before going from right wing nut job podcaster to deputy FBI Director here play this clip.

7:
I'm telling you there could be some national security problems here because ladies and gentlemen, nobody knows how much material people have on Jeffrey Epstein who was videoed where, where those videos are. I was told by someone a long time ago, a very knowledgeable reporter, and on my information, I'm not hiding. Oh, you're hiding up for some foreign government. You're protecting. I'm not protecting anyone. I'm only telling you what I was told that some governments around the world may have some material that's related to the Epstein thing. Bill Clinton was knee deep in this man.

7:
I have a very, very good source. I've told you this story. Forgive me for repeating it if you're a P one, but some people are new. He or never heard this. He was on the plane with Bill Clinton and Epstein on one of Epstein's planes when Bill Clinton was on the plane with some women who, according to my source, looked underage. Why was my source on the plane, Dan? You know, people who hung out with Jeffrey Epstein? No, I don't. He was working.

2:
Now folks, we've been reporting on this over and over again on the Midas Touch Network that Donald Trump's Department of Justice is covering up the Epstein files. We believe this is the case because Donald Trump was close friends with Epstein and Epstein would traffic girls who worked at Mar-a-Lago like Virginia Giuffre, who now died by suicide under suspicious circumstances in Australia as well. Let's go over the facts quickly. I've done a lot of other videos on this, but let me tick off the facts quickly. Trump is DOE 1 74 in some of the Epstein files that have not been released. That's how he was identified. So release the files about Doe 1 74 and Donald Trump's relationship with Epstein.

2:
We know that Donald Trump's already said that Epstein's a great guy who likes girls on the younger side. I think he said, I like, he likes women. On the younger side is the exact quote from Donald Trump. We know Epstein trafficked girls from Mar-a-Lago through Ghislaine Maxwell. We know Donald Trump wished Ghislaine Maxwell well at her sex trafficking trial. Donald Trump's name appears at least seven times on the Epstein flight log that was released already a few years back. But that was only a small portion of the flight log. We know that Epstein traveled on Trump's jet and brought girls who were of indeterminate age, is how one witness described it. We know that Donald Trump is in Epstein's call list of people.

2:
He called in all of Donald Trump's numbers from security to personal, lots of Trump contacts different addresses, and we know that Donald Trump's name appears all over these Epstein depositions where Epstein would bring women. He were trafficking or girls, he would traffic to Trump hotels and Trump properties. That's, you know, those are the facts. We know that the White House already tried to cover it up by claiming they were releasing the Epstein files and they had these right wing influencers hold up these binders that said Epstein files. And they weren't actually the files, they were the call list that was redacted. And Pam Bondy said that she was going to release these files, that she had a truckload of files.

2:
And she's hoping this just goes away And that people forget about it here at the Midas Touch Network. I know that corporate news doesn't talk about it. We talk about it here. I think it's important to know Donald Trump's connections with Epstein. 'cause we know a lot of the public ones already. Here's what they're saying on right-Wing podcast though now for several months, they're accusing the FBI of destroying and deleting Epstein files. This is a right-wing podcast called the Benny Johnson Show. Maybe he'll be a future FBI director or Homeland Security secretary, who knows? Listen to what his witnessed as here play this clip.

8:
Somebody's worked very hard to make sure that this data that you're talking about can be deleted and destroyed forever. Any idea what it is?

9:
No idea on what it is. I can only speculate, but you mentioned the Epstein list. I'd imagine it's cases like that. It's, it's intel cases that are very siloed, very secretive, and I'm sure there's probably even information regarding the FBI's own subversive measure.

2:
And we here at the Midas Touch Network got the exclusive with Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman, who wrote a formal letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding that she provide responses if she's covering up for Donald Trump, is she redacting Donald Trump's name? Is she having the FBI and DOJ officials destroy and shred the Epstein files that contain Donald Trump's name on it?

Here's what Congress member Goldman told me when he sent his letter last week to the DOJ saying, what the hell's happening to these files? Play this

10:
Clip. And so there was a mad dash and a big rush to release everything and everyone was talking about it. And now there's radio silence. And the begs the question, why has the Attorney General gone dark on this? Why has Congresswoman Luna and others stopped calling for it? What is it that's in the Epstein files that they were so eager to have that now are just not being released? According to the Attorney General's promises of transparency but are still there and there's no explanation.

10:
And the concern I have, of course, is we know Donald Trump had a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. We know Jeffrey Epstein had numerous numbers for Donald Trump. And the question then is, was this some sort of directive from Donald Trump or someone on his staff or an agent of his to the Attorney General to kill this? And that would be yet another pretty egregious act of corruption using his position as president for his own personal benefit. It is incumbent upon the Republicans currently in the majority to do their damn job, do their job, and conduct oversight over the president of the United States.

10:
Stop sucking up to him so much. Now,

2:
You go back to March 4th, 2025, where Bondi said that she had truckloads of evidence on her desk. Then before that they claimed it was gonna be released. And then they had that fake release event at the White House where the influencers like very, just like grotesquely were holding up the binder and like celebrating it. I had Michael Wolf who had interviewed Epstein before on the Midas Touch podcast. I interviewed Michael Wolf. No corporate media would interview Michael Wolf other than me because they didn't want to get into these subjects. And Trump had basically told the media do not have Michael Wolf on that didn't scare us.

2:
And Michael Wolf said that Epstein V believed that he was like, Trump's best friend, not just like close, like best friends here play this clip.

11:
And he sat for many, many hours of discussion with, with me. I mean, certainly, certainly 80, 90, probably a hundred hours I have of Epstein on tape. And, and one of the discussions, because this was occurring, Trump became the president in, in 2017, I began writing, writing about about Trump. And so we spent a lot of time talking about Donald Trump and Epstein's relationship with, with, with Trump, which was went on for a good, certainly 15 years and was incredibly close.

11:
They were, I, you know, each other's closest friend for a very long time. And Epstein, I, you know, I think Epstein is one of those people who truly knew Donald Trump, knew many secrets about Donald Trump and was threatening to Donald Trump.

2:
You know, and I think when you see them partying together, they were best friends. I mean, here, I, I'm a lawyer, so I go by evidence. Here's Trump and Epstein partying together. Let's play this clip. We're

12:
Gonna get great ratings in your show.

13:
Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them, the financier Jeffrey Epstein, more than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. Later in the footage Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of them. Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men, and telling Epstein about the cameras, though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and their appearances, Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back there, she's hot.

13:
And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. But as the President says now, he never liked Epstein.

2:
