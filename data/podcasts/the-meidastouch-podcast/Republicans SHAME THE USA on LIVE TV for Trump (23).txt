Donald Trump's surrogates were out in full force and humiliation over the weekend. They were out there humiliating themselves, humiliating the country. The whole thing was utterly embarrassing. You had them all kind of doing a cosplay thing, like Trump literally has them like dress up in costume and they show up in their cowboy hats or whatever. The whole thing is so utterly pathetic. I wanna show you what went down. I'll show you the MAGA Republicans and what they were doing on these weekend shows. I'll show you what the Democrats were doing in response. Some good forceful comebacks by Democrats like Jasmine Crockett, Bernie Sanders, Senator Tim Kane in Virginia.

3:
Let's just take a look at what went down. So this is Christine, no, back on January 11th, 2019 from the Argus leader. She's the former governor of South Dakota. She's now the Secretary of Homeland Security. This was an op-ed she wrote back in 2019 before she went full Trumpian and Mar-a-Lago, but she was heading in that direction. So we've been talking about how she like would do cosplay, dress up as like a ranger and cosplay dress up as a ice police officer with the bulletproof vest over the weekend. She was wearing the cowboy hat inside because of course you need to protect yourself from the sun and lots of sun in those eyes.

3:
So you needed that cowboy hat. This is her latest costume that she was dressing up in. Very nice costume. Christie Nome. And here she is again. One of the things that she was talking about over the weekend is that she's gonna be okay with rounding up mothers and children and putting them into concentration camps in Guantanamo Bay. Here play this clip. These

Countries have an opportunity to get on board with the President of the United States and to partner with us to deal with the legal immigration, to take back their individuals that have been in our country illegally. We want to repatriate them home and they can be partners. So economically, yes, they will feel, they will feel pain. They will.

3:
So over here you now have Donald Trump's made for tv, head of the Department of Transportation. His name is Sean Duffy. He's the one who oversees the FAA. Remember the former FAA head was pushed out by Elon Musk. All of the Federal Aviation administration leadership was pretty much pushed out before the horrific plane crash over Washington dc. Now, Sean Duffy right here became famous on the Real World Road Rules Challenge. He was one of the cast members of the real world, which makes him perfect for Donald Trump's reality tv, Idiocracy fascist regime that he's compiled.

3:
Here's Sean Duffy suggesting that when If you change the names from cockpit to flight deck, that's one of the causes of the plane crash. And that's something that he's powerfully looking into here. Play this clip.

5:
So Shannon, the mission of DOT and FAA is safety. That has been the historic mission of this agency. And over the last four years, when they're having a conversation in the last administration about changing names from cockpit to flight deck or notice to Airmen to notice to Air Mission because it's too gender specific. They're focused on social justice and in the environment, racist roads and EVs, they've lost sight of the mission of this department. And so we have no place for anything other than the best and the brightest. And so when you look at what went wrong, you gotta look at the people that you have in place at the DOT and the FAA and the leadership and the direction that leadership gives them.

5:
And it's been misplaced over the last four years. We're back on mission. We're focused on safety and having the best people delivering that safety. And I don't care, your race, your religion, your sex, your sexual preference, that doesn't matter. Just the best in the right.

3:
I mean, so utterly ridiculous. Here is Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont talking about the oligarchy. Let's play this clip right here,

6:
Margaret. We are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism, and I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well. And I'm gonna do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back, to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody. Yeah, not just Elon Musk and that we maintain American democracy, difficult

3:
Talk. Senator, I have a bunch of other clips I wanna share with you. I I,

Ground News:
I want to talk briefly though about one of my research tactics that I use. I I do this with a sponsor called Ground News. Let me just tell you a little bit about them and let me tell you why it's interesting how I use them with respect to my research on Trump's tariffs and the trade war. We're digging deep always to uncover the real deal behind the headlines. And let's be real, when it comes to corporate media, they're not giving it to you honestly. So there's this thing called ground news. You can finally see through the spin. It's like having X-ray vision for news bias. It helps you boost your media literacy. So one of the things it does is it like rates. The article is this like coming from a left wing source, a center source, or a right wing source. And so what I'll do is I'll go to ground news, I'll take a look at it. And for me, I'm curious what's being said in the right wing echo chamber. I specifically want to focus on that to see how they are messaging and talking about these things. I wanna see how they're brainwashing people. So that's actually how I use the sponsor ground news. Here's the deal. Head over to ground news slash mtn or just scan the QR code and you'll snag a whopping 40% off on their top notch vantage plan. That's unlimited access to all the features I just spilled the beans on. And then some, check it out now ground news slash MTN or scan the QR code. That's ground news slash MTN or scan the QR code.

Back to our programming here. Democratic Senator Mark Warner. Here's what he had to say. Play this clip,

7:
This offer, which again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from, right? But it is, I can tell you with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on. And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB Director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our, our fruit, our milk, our eggs. You know what happens? They all quit

3:
Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. Let's play this clip.

8:
Let's get to what you'll be doing, serving on this committee. It's led by Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene to provide oversight to dojo's efforts. Do you know why they went after acts?

3:
Here is what Brian Maed publican Congress member who leads the Foreign Affairs Committee. He's talking about leading a purge of the State Department. Have you spoken to Marco Rubio about that? Although we all know Rubio doesn't have any power at all. Rubio though was sent to Panama to demand that he sees the Panama Canal back. But anyway, let's play this clip of Congress member mast. Let's play it.

8:
Let's get to what you'll be doing, serving on this committee. It's led by Congressman Marjorie Taylor Green to provide oversight to dojo's efforts. Do you know why they went after acts?

3:
Here we have JD Vance Vice President talking about conquering Greenland. Let's show you that clip.

9:
The president has so many bold ideas from the possibility of acquiring Greenland, putting up this iron dome in America, taking back the Panama Canal, renaming the Gulf to the Gulf of America. Do you expect the US to acquire Greenland?

10:
I think it's possible, Maria. So, so here's the thing that I, I think a lot of folks don't appreciate about Greenland. It's really important to our national security. There are sea lanes there that the Chinese use, that the Russians use that frankly Denmark, which controls Greenland. It's not doing its job and it's not being a good ally. So you have to ask yourself, how are we going to solve that problem? Solve our own national security. If that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us. He cares about putting the interest of America's citizens first. There's another angle to this whole Greenland thing that Maria, that people don't realize. You've got probably 55,000 people living on Greenland who are not actually happy with Danish government.

10:
They've got great natural resources there. They've got an incredibly bountiful country that the Danes aren't letting them develop and explore. Of course, Donald Trump would take a different approach if he was the leader of Greenland.

9:
And the odds

3:
Of the here is Tim Kane, democratic Senator from Virginia spitting common sense right here talking about how, wait a minute. So Donald Trump signed an emergency order saying that we desperately need energy, but now he's going to be imposing sanctions on Canada in the form of tariffs to get that energy play. This clip

11:
Attacks on Virginia consumers prices went up, and then when those nations retaliated, they retaliated against critical Virginia industry sectors, especially agriculture and forestry. I remember going out during the Trump first term to talk to my farmers and foresters, who by and large were Trump supporters. And they were saying, for God's sake, Senator, help us. This is hurting our businesses. So look, here's what Americans are gonna see. Higher prices for energy, higher prices for groceries. That's what they're gonna see. Businesses are gonna get hurt when the retaliatory tariffs tick in. And I, I'm struck by the irony of last week, the president signed an emergency order regarding energy.

11:
There's an energy emergency and he just put a 10% tariff on energy from Canada. He is increasing prices at the pump and you'll start to see it within the next couple of days. At the same time, he's saying there's an energy emergency. The emergency is self-created.

3:
Now, Senator Kane, I think's, been on a roll lately. Lemme show you one more clip of him right here. Let's play it.

11:
I'll tell you, I had a suspicion about why he did that. Why race bait At a moment like this, I think the president didn't want to be asked tough questions like, why did you let Elon Musk force the FAA administrator to resign when this crash happened? There was no FAA administrator because he had clashed with Elon Musk. Why did you scrap an aviation safety advisory committee within DHS on the second day of your presidency saying that it wasn't related to national security? Oh, air safety is not related to national security. Why did you issue a buyout offer to include air traffic controllers when we're already short of air traffic controllers?

11:
I think the president was nervous that he was gonna be asked questions about his own administration's policies that were deemphasizing air safety. And so he decided to have everybody chase down a rabbit hole of his DEI allegations with no evidence. But I do. All right,
