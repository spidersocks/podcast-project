Information, hold on. A new Trump pick. He is just nominated Russ Vaught to be the director of the US Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Another huge, huge job.

2:
I just wanna show you how the Fox propaganda works. You know who Russ vote is, right? I mean he's literally the architect of project 2025. And that's when Fox learned after they tried to pretend that Donald Trump has nothing to do with Project 2025, that literally the architect is now gonna run the Office of Management and Budget. He's gonna be running OMB, which they're going to implement all of the project 2025 plans through the budget. So then the same panel starts saying, well, actually, these project 2025 ideas are really just the same thing as ma ideas, right? After telling us, after telling we the people, oh, they know nothing about Project 2025, right?

2:
That was the whole thing. Trump doesn't know. Project 2025 here, play this clip.

1:
And Charlie, the left is already going crazy because of Vaught's connection with Project 2025, because look, project 2025 to be, to be, to be very clear here, a lot of their ideas were just classic MAGA ideas. A lot of them were just classic. I

3:
I mean all of them. I mean I've read, well, I please don't make me read Project 2025, but I've read some Who wants to read Project 2025? Let's be honest here, but you know, it's not, this stuff is not insane. This is like classic conservatism, maga conservatism. It makes a ton of sense. And you know, I, again,

2:
And, and just so you know, like, well, well, Ben, maybe you're just, you're, you're just saying project 2025 and linking in. How do we know that? Well, take a look right here. This is literally the Project 2025 manual right here. The, the person who wrote the manual on Project 2025, the executive office of the President of United States section about all of the kind of dictatorial powers they want to give to Donald Trump. Look, it's Russ Vote's name and also If You. Take a look at just some of the other individuals who have been brought to the Trump administration thus far. I mean, you're talking about Stephen Miller, Tom Holman, the borders are John Radcliffe, Caroline Levitt, Brendan Carr.

2:
Now Russ Vote. These are all people who wrote Project 2025. So then what you do if you're the Fox propaganda machine is you call in as the Laura in Grham show call in one of the MAGA Republican Congresswoman Colin Anna Paulino Luna, who before becoming a congresswoman was a swimsuit model. A MAGA swimsuit model, call Herin. And then here, one of the things that Ham then tries to do is just kind of normalize this, like, well, this is what we wanted all, all along, right? I mean he's the architect of the idea of how you get these Schedule F employees. And she uses like all this like terminology to mask the fact that what they're talking about is basically gutting the federal government, removing anyone who works there, who's not 100% loyal to Trump.

2:
Here, watch this exchange on Friday night between Ingram and Anna. Paulina Luna, here, watch this. Let's play

1:
It sent. And now the labor position filled OMB is filled with Russ Vaught, who is really the architect of the idea of how to take these Schedule F employees and basically system systematically remove them from, you know, the federal bureaucracy that's scaring a lot of bureaucrats in Washington tonight. Your reaction to all of this news, but especially Vaught given his plans for the federal employment, which is a lot of people could have to be look looking for real work.

4:
Look, Russ could not be a better pick. I know that he's not only an absolute patriot, but he's very serious about cleaning up DC And part of the problem that we're having is, again, these deep state bureaucrats that think that they can outlast administrations and the will of the American people. And so you have to get new blood into Washington DC from the secretary positions to the federal, to the federal jobs. I mean we just need a flush all the way through. So I'm very happy that President Trump appointed him, and frankly, I'm pretty excited to have backup in Washington, DC

2:
Now, one of the videos that we showed you and I think, you know, was very, very, very compelling stuff. The Center for Climate Reporting Hat Tip to them. Remember they went undercover and they met with Vote and Vote was like, look, we're doing Project 2025. Okay, Trump's just out there. He thinks it's like bad branding for him, so he's just gonna deny it. But in reality, we're gonna really do the Project 2025 agenda. Here's what Vote had to say. Remember this hidden camera video here, play this clip

5:
Standing. I, I expected to hear 10 more times from the rally. The president, you know, distancing himself from the left Boogie man at Project 2025. Yeah. And you're not worried about that? No, I'm not worried about it. And so I see what he's doing is just very, very conscious distancing himself from a brand. He's very supportive of what we do and, and, and know that we have an all manner of things that we do. That's, you know, even unrelated to product 2025.

ZBiotics:
Let's face it, after night with drinks, I don't bounce back the next day like I used to. Hey, I gotta be honest with myself, right? It feels like I have to choose between having a great night or a great next day. That is until I found pre-cool ZBiotics. Pre-cool probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle a rough mornings after drinking. Here's how it works. When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. It's this byproduct, not dehydration. That's the blame for your rough. Next day. Pre-Cool produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. Just remember to make ZBiotics your first drink of the night. Drink responsibly and you'll feel your best tomorrow. Every time I have pre-cool before drinks, I notice a difference the next day, for example, after a fun night out with friends at like a local bar or wherever we go, I could still get up the next morning and hit the gym. And I'll admit I was skeptical at first, but I tried it at a dinner party with some friends. The next morning I felt great, ready to tackle the day, ready to do more videos here at the Midas Touch Network. I kept hearing about pre-cool and wondered what it was actually like. Now that I've tried it, I get the Hype. Plus with their GMO technology, Zbiotics is continuing to create probiotics that tackle the challenges of modern living.

Now, it would be nice if corporate media actually like reported on these things the way we did, but remember what, like the USA today headline was The USA Today, today headline was this Project 2025 is an effort by the Heritage Foundation, not Donald Trump. Remember, they like fact checked us. Remember anyone who was saying, no, Donald Trump's 2025. It's all his people. No. Take a look. This was usaid. Today, the corporate media fact check, Midas touch lying. Other independent media are lying to you. Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation, not Trump. We're like, these are all Trump's people of these, what are you talking about? It's the Heritage Foundation. Here's how the AP reported it.

2:
Biden a sales project 2025 comma, a plan to transform government, comma and Trump's claim to be unaware of it. Think about that clumsy headline. Biden a sales project 2025, A plan to transform government and Trump's claim to be unaware of it. Like they're struggling to, even, they're helping Donald Trump with a sentence that's not even a, a sentence that makes sense. And there's other reporting. I have nothing to do with Project 2025. Trump says, look, as the outgoing chair of the Democratic National Committee writes, Jamie Harrison goes, Trump repeatedly lied about his connection to Project 2025.

2:
Now he's chosen one of its chief architects, Russ vote to serve as the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He's one of many project 2025 Tide allies. Trump is rewarding with jobs in the administration. And another one was Tom Holman. And just so you can see what Tom Holman the borders are was saying on Friday night when he was on right wing media, this is again, borders are here. And he's saying, look, you know, remember I did a video where I showed you that the LAPD police chief is saying that he's not going to allow the LAPD to be used to do bloody mass deportations.

2:
Remember, I did that video, what week and a half ago, two weeks ago? So in this video, I'm about to show you Tom Holman, who was the architect of the bloody deportation section, which is not, it doesn't have a family values exception, or, you know, somehow like Latinos for Trump think that they're immune to this. This guy's coming for you. He just says he is. They, they've said they are. And If You believe that there's gonna be protection by the LAPD or any of them who say they're not gonna be involved in the bloody roundups. Here's the borders. Are Tom Holman saying, it's all right, we're, we're, we'll put the military in and we'll double the forces if the LAPD doesn't want help, period. Second here, play this clip,

6:
But don't cross the line. And look, I've said this, if, if, we'll certainly be helpful to have local law enforcement assistance, especially if things go bad quick. And there's actually a violent situation where an officer's or, or someone in public's life is, is put in immediate danger. I find it hard to believe a local law enforcement would respond to help, but if they do, they do. But they, I i, I just can't like this councilman, what, what is he thinking? And not helping the federal government remove public safety threats out of his constituency? His number one responsibility, protect the community he represents. So why would you push back on this? We've been clear we're gonna prioritize public safety threats.

6:
So look, we don't wanna help get the hell outta the way. If I gotta send twice as many officers to LA because we're not getting any assistance, and that's what we're going to do. We gotta mandate President Trump serious about this. I'm serious about this. This is going to happen with or without you, hopefully with you, but if not, it'll happen anyway.

2:
You could put that all together, but you know, it, it was just so fascinating. Fascinating is maybe not the right word, but to see Fox in real time now go, well, look, it's Russ Vote. Oh, project 2025. Well, actually, that's just really what the MAGA views were. Anyway. Oh, let's call in Anna Paul Luna. Pauline Luna, what do you have to say about this, folks? Just open up your eyes, please. As I've said, we need to be clear-eyed about what's going on here. Okay? They lie to you. Show, show this video. Do me a favor. If you've got, you know, that family member who voted for Trump and they're like, they're not doing this. Show them this video gave you all the receipts.
