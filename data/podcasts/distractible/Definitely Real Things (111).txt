Good evening, gentle listener and welcome to Distractible. This episode branded Bob knows his sausages can't do axons. And against the guides to be cunning, linguists modified Mark Ghost conquering for sonder nuts. Lous sharing a sced home beverages and Pachyderms Bottled Wade prepares harassment suits, tortures the walking wounded, and accidentally advises daytime drinking from the Follicly challenged to Wesson's. Word ha. It's time for Definitely Real Things. Now sit back and prepare to be distracted and enjoy the show.


Hello and welcome back to another episode of the World's favorite podcast, Distractible. I'm your host because I won the last one. My name is Bob and I'm joined per usual by my two competitors and co-hosts for the day. Wade and Mark. Hello. Hey, sorry. I'm struggling with technology getting older. You know, we're getting very old. That's actually what we're gonna talk about today. If you've ever seen this show, it is a show where I give points 'cause I'm the host and the two guys who just said hello, they're competing and one of them wins and then they host the next one. And then I compete against the loser and so on and so forth. And it's all made up and the points don't matter, but we write them down on our little scraps of paper before we get into, I do have a game for today that we're gonna play and it's fun.


Question mark before we get into that, how's it going fellas? You doing? Oh, how's it hang in? You know, you know, Do I, I got a headline for you if you want it. Oh hell yeah. Cheating alleged after Men's World Conquer champion found with Steel Chestnut. I don't know anything that you just talked about. Yeah, well maybe a picture would help elucidate this, this situation. Let me just give you a, let me, let me show you a little bit of what we're talking about here and then it should clear it right up. And you should not be confused anymore. All, right? You ready? Conquer champions. Oh Yeah, there you go. I see This is like from the Leprechaun Olympics.


Wait, describe this for the listeners. In the top left corner of the screen, we have a hand with a sleeve rolled up past the wrist. We have a nice blue sky, light clouds. The hand appears to be holding a stick with a acorn on it. Probably a chestnut on the other side we have a gentleman with a black bowler hat, I think they're called, wearing a green jacket on the outside. Looks like the inside is yellow. It's kind of a leprechaun look. The man is an older gentleman with gray hair, some gray eyebrows. He's holding his left hand up to admit he cheated. And his right hand is wrapped up on what looks like a chestnut balloon string.


And his chest is covered in chest nutty acorn Apricorns. Yes. Interesting. Did I describe it well enough? You sure did. I'm really proud of you. The fuck Would I just look at, I know this and I'm sure everyone else does. Conquers is a traditional children's game where you're supposed to take turns hitting each other's. Conquers is not what we called it when we were kids is This ball tap With, with the object of breaking the other player's nut. so I can see how having a steel conquer acorn? Nope. A nope. A chest nut, steel, chest nut. That would be cheating. 'cause that's not gonna break. That's steel's tough. Yep. so I think that's the long and the short of it.


You smash your nuts together until they explode. What has happened to our culture? You remember like 10 years ago, balls Of Steel used to be so good. Now it's cheating. Apparently conquers are the seeds of the chestnut tree, but they are also called abl Yonkers Chegg or Cheeser. So maybe that's why you were confused. 'cause you, you thought you didn't know we were talking about cheeser. Yeah, I thought we were talking about, I didn't know. We were talking about Cheeser. Oh, he had steal cheeser. Yeah, he had a steal. Cheeser. This guy. How'd you find this mark? Oh, I have various research methods that I will not elucidate. Man. Go's really struggling for Go for content. Oh, there's a, here's one to you, Wade.


This is, this is a very topical thing to you. High court. I don't know which court, but it seems like Scotland High court rules calling a man bald is sexual harassment. It is when Wade does It. I have so many lawsuits coming toward you. Viewers and listeners In the Scotland. Yes. Just so happens I might have land in Scotland. Ah, maybe. Are you a Lord? I've got a one foot by one foot land square that makes me a Lord. I might not be Scotland, but I think it is. It was a birthday gift. This Is got me fake. It falls a lengthy legal case brought by electrician Tony Finn, who claimed he had been sexually harassed by his boss during a heated row.


In 2019, Mr. Finn 64 made the claim against the British Bung Company where he worked as an electrician for 24 years before He was Fired. 2021. Yes. The British bung. Yes. That British bung company. Oh, okay. I remember watching the British bung off. Yeah. He said he was a victim of sexual harassment after comments were made about his baldness, including being called a stupid bald sea censor censor sensor. That could be cock, it could be cunt, it could be crap. Fill in the blanks. Kareem but spelled wrong. Sizzler but spelled really wrong. Crisp With No, I Crank with no n.


Cock a cart. Jolly young fellow. Canned E, canned C and D. You got it? Carp. Carp. Oh you bald carp. Stupid bald carp. The three person employment tribunal panel. The highest court in Scotland apparently said the remark, quote crossed a line. It dismissed an argument that the comment was not sexist because women can be bold too. The judgment said there was a connection between the word bald and the protected characteristic of sex. Noting that it is quote, much more prevalent in men than women. Judge Jonathan brain added. We find it inherently related to sex.


Hmm. So this is sounded like it's not a joke. It's not a joke at all. Why would you think it was a joke? Because You said this has to be a joke when you started reading it and I Was thinking it. That's true. You did? No, no. I said it had to be fake. I couldn't believe it because I was aghast. I was agast. Oh, I See. I was a gass. Understood. I was like, I can't believe this is the world we live in. Aghast. I can't tell you the number of times I've walked by like a Scottish construction site. Just heard them like whistle and go bald. The bald calling. I'm glad it's coming to an end In a perfect American accent. They're bald, bald, Bald. Hi Lanny bald. It's disgusting For some reason because they're on a construction site. It's just like a, like a New York accent in Scotland.


It's like, huh, I can't even do it Next time. Hey you are Baldy Here. Look at this guy. Eh, Baldy. Anyway, that's it. Great article man. That was a good find. I'm glad that, I'm glad that my kind is finally get the recognition and treatment we deserve. It's only fair. Does that mean we have to stop saying that to you? Do you want do, would you like us to make fun of you in different ways? I've Just always considered it flirting and you guys are welcome to continue. Okay. I'm kinky and I like it. Just Start calling you Harry instead. That is offensive. And I'm gonna take you to the highest court of Ohio. The Ohio Labor Tribunal. No. Yeah. I love a tribunal. We got an inherent tribunal thing going on here and I think that's the reason why we're so successful.


There's Always three. Is that why it's called a tribunal? Nevermind. I see. Now I understand with the name. You don't see a lot of tribunals. You Don't tribunal No bual. If you're being formal Bual. What are we doing? Small talk. Oh you know what? You know what I was gonna bring up? I forgot last episode. Somehow this completely slipped my mind. We were talking about cringe stuff when You hugged your teacher. Yeah man, that one. But I thought of a cringe moment that happened to me in front of you two. I Don't recall. I think we were doing the tour. I think we were doing your welcome tour. It could have been a convention. I don't remember exactly the the specifics. But we were walking from either the convention center or the show center to a hotel.


We came across some fans and there was a guy in a wheelchair and like two other people with him. And they came up and they were like, Hey, can you guys like sign? We were like, sure. We did some photos signing and the guy in the wheelchair asked us to sign his arm and I was a little bit late catching up 'cause I was talking to someone else or whatever and you guys had all signed his arm. I was, he was like, yeah, wait, but you signed my arm. I was like, yeah, sure. so I took Sharpie and right on the heart of his elbow, I signed my name and apparently the part of the conversation I missed was that he was gonna get all of those tattooed on his arm. Ah. As I signed his elbow, he looked at me so sad. He was like, that's gonna hurt so much. And I was like, what? The sharpie having no idea that the man was gonna get that tattooed.


So you never realized that or neither of you were like, you could do it again. And he just tells the tattoo artist not to go here. Or is it like a mad tattoo artist? I think I offered and he is like, no, that's okay. That would be a lie mark. That second signature might as well just be a big middle finger that he draws on there. Well you know the second one, we have to charge 50 grand. The first one's free, but second one we gotta charge a lot of money. so I, It's true. But yeah, I remember just that feeling of like him looking like I was so proud. I was like, dude that came out really well. I should sign bones more often. It's a nice tight surface where the W looks great. Hmm. One of my better signatures and he just looked so sad. You Got a nice tight elbow sir.


Huh? Great for writing. You all looked at me like I was the biggest asshole. You're like, dude, why would you sign there? I was like, I didn't know I was gonna get tattooed. I missed that part of the conversation. Maybe. Maybe my memory's just getting bad, but I don't remember that. But I'm sure it happened. It You. Yeah. I, I re I recalled that after the episode. I was like, oh, I forgot that one. If you're still watching after all these years. I'm so Sorry. He did it on purpose. Don't believe him I'd do It again. But like this time it would be intentional. Intentful intentional is a word. Intentional is a word. You don't need to question that one. We got Joey Chestnut on my mind or whatever the hell the thing. Joey Chestnut. Is that the hotdog guy? Joey Chestnut? Yeah, he's, he's the Nathan's hotdog eating champion.


He's my champion. Anyway, He was expunged, Expunged, Expunged, Expunged. He was expunged. You mean beaten or do you mean his records were taken away? No, he got a different sponsorship from a different hotdog. He's a con man now. Yes. I don't get it. I don't get it. Is K's is a brand of hotdog. Oh, KAHN, right? Like ka I an Oscar Meyer Mr. I'm on my A game. He went indie. He only, it's Queen city sausages now. Yeah. I'm glad Wade liked Dick. I'm glad he's having fun over there. Can we go back? Can we start from the top with the describing the picture? It's too late now.


That guy's a con man. God Dammit. I don't feel good today. Maybe I'm not understanding the nuance of conquers, but how would you not notice if a thing that was supposed to be a nut from a tree was actually made of metal? Is that less obvious than it seems like it would be to me? How Does the dual go? Do you just slap 'em on sticks against each other Or they're not Sticks? It looks like you have the nut on a string and you go sway and you try and like s smack 'em against each other on the strings. So it was a picture still image, but they were on strings and they were swinging them. That's why the guy had it wrapped around his hand. 'cause it's a string That makes more sense than the weird metal rod wolverine claw.


I was picturing. Yeah, no, that's not, I was like, oh man, he's got a brass stick knuckle. Turns out his conquer was just a gun. He was just shooting everybody else's nuts. How did we not know? I can, I looked at, I was like, ah, that seems fair. But now in retrospect, what were we thinking? Oh wait, it's British though. What were we thinking? Governor? Scottish. No, not Scottish. That was the Whoa, whoa. You can't just say that Dude. 2024 Editors bleep. Bleep that out. Censor that Editors From now on. We have to censor the word. I'm sorry to burden you With this. I can say it though 'cause I am.


You know, This episode is brought to you by Vitamin Water. So much of what the world is obsessed with starts out in New York City. It's a place full of style and character that has something for everyone with a range of flavors to meet any kind of taste. It's no wonder Vitamin Water was born there. Colorful, flavorful, anything but boring. Vitamin water injects a daily dose of vibrancy into a water down life. Down. Grab a vitamin water today. Vitamin Water is a registered trademark of Glaso.


Alright, well shall we move on to the game, gentlemen? Sure. I hope you've got a lot of words in your brains. I Used a gas earlier so I've got a Few because you're gonna need some sweet, sweet words for this one. I, I'm gonna be honest, I stole this from another thing. I saw this on TikTok. It just, it just, it's like a fun word game. so I wanna play it. I didn't invent this. I don't even know if it has an official title. I call it word game really gives it away. Word game. I'm, I'm gonna give you two words and you need to connect to these two words by saying like two word phrases. So a short example would be, I give you the word paper and the word dance.


And you could say paper cut, cut in line line dance. And it's two word phrases, but I'm excluding like right in or on. You can have little, what are those called? The, the, just the small words. You can include the small words. It's two big words in any number of small words. Like, Look my ass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. But not look at my Ass. No, no. Just look my ass. Which ones are the big words in that look And ass look ass. Maybe there's just a comma Ass big. My small. Huh? I'm misunderstanding everything that's happening. I think Where is small? What did, anyway, it's okay. 'cause we're gonna kind of work together. It's a game of cooperatively getting from point A to point B and you're not gonna earn points for finishing the puzzle.


But you are gonna earn points along the way for the quality of the connections that we can make. And you're welcome to make it, like the example I gave you is very short, right? There's three things. But you are welcome to make it and I assume we will make it fairly long. I'm just gonna give you a starting word and an ending word and we're gonna take turns going back and forth. And I just wanna, I just want to, I just wanna make some connections. You know, I'm not fully understanding, I don't think. Okay. I'll give you another example. We'll give you the starting word is phone and the ending word is lock. Okay. And then to get there you could say phone number, number pad, pad, lock. So each of these couple, each of these sets of words is like a thing, right?


A phone number is a thing. A number pad is a thing. And then a padlock is a thing. Okay. And the lock is the word you're trying to get. Do they Have to be compound words like That? Do they have to be, I'm gonna say two words or equivalently short phrases. Like in my first one I said cut in line. Where technically that's three words. But like the words are cut in line in is just there to facilitate the language. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I got it already. I was already with you. Yeah. And I, I call it word game. Ooh. Cooperative word game. No, no, no. Just Word game. Just word Game. Let's just, let's just ease into it. I, I, once again, I tried to calibrate these in how hard I think they'll be.


So this probably the hardest one of the entire day. We must have been the rest of the entire episode on it. But the first one I wanna start at Star and I want to go to bottle star and bottle and we'll flip a coin to see who goes first. Dink. Oh, white goes first. Oh, Okay. Star light. Okay. Good one. Good one. My turn. Yeah, go ahead. Light saber. Ooh, that's a tough one. No, no, it's got a clear path. Oh, does it? Yeah. Saber meet Timbers. What? No. What'd you say? Saber meet timber. I still a ripple. I got it. Hold on. Don't I got this? We Can get here.


We can see what mark's laying down. I'm pretty sure Starlight Light Saber. I have one that I feel like it goes after Saber, but I don't see how Mark thinks. That's the obvious path. so I feel like I'm wrong. Saab flavor Saber. Oh Wait, I might be getting it backwards. Wait, no, I might've gotten some wrong in the chain. Ah, I, I messed up. Ah, hold on. Now I'm gonna start a word with saber. Saber in sheath. What? What the fuck starts with saber man? Oh Man. Can I give it, can I say what I was going through? Even though it's not quite right. Oh, okay. Okay. This is where I was gonna go. It's not getting there because I realized now, oh, I thought about it backwards.


I was gonna go, it was light saber, saber tooth, Tooth Pick and then I forgot I was gonna go water pick or, and then I'm like, wait, no, because I needed to get to water and I was gonna go water bottle, but that, oh, it's toothpick to water pick. And that doesn't work. I forgot about Saber Tooth. Saber tooth is the one I thought of. That's the only one I could think of. But that was the one I thought of. That's why I thought It would've been easy. I was like, it's the only one I could think of. All, right. Wait, do you want to use saber tooth? Oh Man. You know, it's such a good one. I mean, you could think of your own if you want. Honestly, if you want to I will. I will accept Sare in sheath because it's really fucking funny. So is the Word gotta be sheath to start with or is It, yeah.


So the next word is sheath. Oh man. Yeah. You know what? Just to help my buddy Mark along, I'll give him in sheath. Alright. The word, the word is just sheath in, in gets dropped in, gets dropped. Oh man. Okay. I've got a clear line here, man. I don't know. Oh Yeah, me too. That's An obvious Path. I got it. Here we go. We've got Sheath Of the East. Sheath of De East. What are you trying to get to? Bottles. Sheath Of de East. Let me ask the judges, judges are saying, yes, sheath of DA East. Can I rewind to what I thought this was gonna go?


No, You got it man, east it's easy from Here. I, when I gave you Starlight, I was like, Starlight light beer, beer bottle. Nah. Yeah, that would've been really Easy, man. That would've really got us there right on time. Now That I'm in into east, I gotta figure what the fuck. Alright. Sheath of the east. Wait, your word is east. Can they be names of locations? Sure. Clearly the rules are, are more of a suggestion. So Like here in Cincinnati there's a lake called East Fort Fort East Fork. Fork. Fork. Like fork and spoon. Well, fork bottle doesn't make any sense at all, man.


How do you expect to get There? Ah, I forgot Sheath into east. I should have got something better. Sheath of the east, east bottle. What are we doing? Mark and I both had our own. We did not cooperate. I went toward light beer. He went to Saber Tooth Fork. Mark, your word is fork. Let's go. We got this. Oh yeah, we do. Fucking no, Can't use Fork of the East. I'm just gonna count that out right now. Oh, Don't worry. I was gonna say fork in the road. Judges are saying yes, that counts.


Oh God. All right? Your, your word is road. Road is fine. Road is totally normal. Road Bottle. I, you, you know what I have, I have a one word solution that gets us to the end. And it's, it's not, it's something we've already talked about. Road beer. That's a thing. Road a beer. Road beer. I don't think that's a thing we should encourage here. That's, that's, that's really, you know, that's Road beer doesn't count 'cause it's bad. Don't do road beer. That's our official opinion. That's a fair. That's fair Mark. Very fair. You get a fair point. You road kill. Kill bottle. Kill bottle. Obviously. Yeah. I just thought of. No, don't tell me.


Okay, I'll save it. I'll save it. I've got a, I've got one another one word solution. Is it kill beer? It better not be kill beer. It's not kill beer. It's totally new. It's totally new. Kill saber. Kill saber. Tooth Saber into East, east bottle. No, I was gonna clear that. I was gonna say kill into Bill. You know Bill Bottle. The bill. Bottle Bill Bo as in Billbo Baggins Bo. Tool bottle Kill time. Oh, Can I save my, I'll save mine. Well you know what I'm just gonna say you can't use it 'cause it's not right. What I thought of was kill me and then me bottle, you know the exclamation me bottle.


But you gotta say it's Scottish Me Bottle me bottle. What was my word? Thme. Thme. Your word is time. Yeah. Obviously. Time to drink And then drinks. Bottle. Yeah. Drink Bottle. Is that it? That's how you're going with No, no. We can Get there if you gimme that. I We can get There. No, that's too easy. I gotta go a different route. Right? The goal is to actually get to the end. But I'm not gonna rush you. I'm not gonna rush you. You can get there in your own way. I believe in you guys we're a team here. Mark. You can get there with this. I know. Yep. Timeshare. What the fuck Share bottle. You could probably put a couple other words in there. Hey, share that bottle. No, that's Stupid. Share bottle.


What were you going for? What were you going for? I can't tell you. This is ruined the game. Share. Share what? Share what? A lot of things you can share. Man. What do you want me to share? Share where? Oh yeah. All right? All right. I got, I got it dude. We're there. Thank you. Okay. You're welcome. Ready? Go For it. Share That bottle. No, that shouldn't count. It's not Share your word is Wear where That bottle. I dunno. That's also not the kind of wear that it is, but okay.


Wear that bottle. Oh you're right. I gave him a really troublesome wear. It's not that kind of shareware is spelled S-H-A-R-E-W-A-R-E. Wear. Oh like software? Yeah. I didn't help you. I present the news software wolf. I don't think that's how that's spelled. Oh wait, there is one. There's a word that does make sense there. Oh yeah. Wait, there's an easy one. I feel so stupid. Where E is W-E-A-R-Y. Where? Warehouse. Warehouse. Yes. Aha. And now we've really got it. Yes. There's no way we fuck this up. I'm sure we'll get there this time.


This Is simple. The very responsible house beer. You don't want a road beer? We have to endorse house beer. If road beer is off limits, then yeah. What we are saying is it better be a house beer? Yeah. Or it's like you're at a bar and it's the house. You know beer. You know they have so I Gotta get from beer to bottle. Yay. I did it. I don't know if I'm gonna count that. I don't think he's done. Beer Tab Beer. Well, beer bottle. God. How long did that take? I wasn't looking at the time. It's 30 minutes into the episode. Ah, fuck. That took about a little over 10 minutes of act. Oh no that's not true.


More like 15 minutes. You and I both had like five words. We were like that'll get there. That'll get there. We didn't go anywhere close. Would you like to hear how the journey that we went on to get from star to bottle? No. Yeah, Sure. Star light lights. Saber Saber in chief Sheath of the East, east Fork, fork in the road. Road. Kill, kill time, time share, share, wear, warehouse house, beer, beer bottle. Other than the East and with sheath. Other than those two, we were pretty good. If You don't look at all the of does and in does, it's fantastic.


They sheath. Ah, I knew this would be a good idea. Beware the sheath of the East. I knew you guys would be good at this. Thanks. It would be a challenge for people to even come up with that many connections without stumbling there. I feel like, I feel like we've really, Without purposefully going away from your goal. Yes. It's almost impressive that you were, you were both actually trying to succeed. And that's still where, that's where we went. Alright, well I'm excited for this one then. 'cause I thought this one might be harder. I have no idea why I thought that. I couldn't tell you anyway. Your first word is chair and I want you to get to Elephant. Am I going first?


Mark starts? Yes. Okay. Hmm. Maybe Chairlift. I can't lift an elephant. Chairlift lift elephant. Got it. You guys are so good at this. What? Compound word leads to elephant. Yeah, That's what I was thinking. I was like, man that's tough. I I can think of one. Oh I can think of one as well. I Like how Park and I both scramble to the, the one answer at almost the exact same moment every time we wade is like saber in sheath. Maybe This is like a superpower. You have Bob wherever you discover it. I instantly am like, oh yeah. And I bet it's the same. I bet we're thinking of the same thing here. I'm gonna type, I'm gonna type it to you. Are we thinking of the same thing? Share To everyone. so I can also know.


No, no, don't help him. Don't help him. I thought this was Cooperative. Oh no, that's a different one. All, right. Okay. All. right. Okay. Oh, I guess I shouldn't tell you since you're playing the game. I, I have a different one. But that is a good one. Well he Told you, you tell me and I'll tell Mark mine All. right. That sounds fair. Great. Alright. Chairlift. And I gotta get to, we have to get to Elephant. Your word is lift and we're trying to get to Elephant. Wade, I believe in you. Lift pump. That's, that's how you go with lift. Lift up. That's what we're working with. Yep. All. right. I'll allow it. It couldn't be lift off or any actual thing. Lift up. Maybe off is the word. I was trying to, I was like, there's something that just starts with lift. What is it? Lift up.


Lift up. That's it. It's like that song you lift up All. right. Wade, listen, that was a bullshit. I'm gonna give you this up uplift. Try again. Lift down Lift de West. All. right. Fine.

No, no up dog. Ah shit. Wait, what is weight actually going with Beat Up? Is that what we're doing? Yeah, I thought so. Well he played off. I was joking but he played off. Yeah, we're going man. Oh, I thought you were serious. Nope, we're going with it. Beat up up dog.


Wade, your word is dog. That's where we're going. I'm not doing this one. But if I say dog mug, we have Elephant. If we get desperate, maybe we should circle back around to that one. Yeah, yeah. Mark, keep that one in mind. Okay. I do Dog fight. Okay. Not the direction. I was hoping I feel that way every time you give me what we Do. Granted, I don't know how I'm landing this. so I hope it doesn't come down to me. Why Mark is sitting here like, and then that and, and Wade is just like any word. My elephant Fight, fight goes with that. I Don't know how to land elephants, so I'm fucking lost fight Night.


Ooh. In IG ht. So not like a night with armor. Yeah, it's it's fight at night. Fight night Fight In the evening. It's, there's a, there's a clear line. There's a very direct line. I keep saying that. He'll, he'll definitely figure it out. Having not seen the final destination of where we're trying to land. I know which path is correct. We know, we know what the landing Is. Wait, it's elephant. Elephant is the destination because The answer you're looking for is nightfall. Fuck. Hey, can I just say silver lining? I'm pretty sure this one's turning out to be harder than the first one. I am still circling in my helicopter looking for how to land Elephant.


Oh man. But it was right there man. It was right there. It sure probably was okay. All right? No, I can't. I can't do it. What are you gonna say? Fall off. Where did this great plan of yours bring you Mark back to me. Offload. I'm heading right. Torn Elephant. I'm glad you said the right word. Load up. Don't say up. Load upend. Okay, Good. You bitch. One of us is progressing.


Mark one is living in the past. No, We got there. We got there. End Of the show. Oh Wow. End of the show. Final word or show Elephant. Yeah, that's the thing, right? Show Elephant. Yeah. Yeah. That's a thing. That's a thing. That's a thing. Yeah. Gosh, I got it right away when you said show, but I wanted to make you squirm. Okay, That's fine. I, 'cause what I was doing is like fight night and then it was gonna be like night Circus Circus and then Circus Elephant. Yeah. I feel that Circus was the one that I thought of. Mark Mark's original one was Pink Elephant. But I was also thinking you could try and arrive at Circus Elephant. The only one I had was Blue Elephant, which is like the dude from Star Wars.


Blue Elephant. What? Yeah. The blue elephant guy who plays like the keyboard. Oh yeah, yeah, Yeah. Because Robot Chicken had a whole thing. Like they did a song where like fucking one of the NSYNC guys came on. Not actually, but was like singing about being a blue elephant. Like his whole shtick was, he was a blue elephant. so I was like, dude, they must both be thinking Blue Elephant. That's the one. That's The one. There was, there was a little pettiness in this journey, but I do like it to get from chair to Elephant. We got chairlift, lift up, uplift, lift off, offbeat, beat Up up. Dog, dog. Fight, fight. Night Nightfall, fall off, offload load Up, up end.


End of the show show. Elephant Been a lot of offs and ups We're really good at screwing each other over. Oh man. You're like, that's not the ending. I wanna do go again. You had four ups. You had three lifts. Anyway, that was a good one guys. Beautiful. Let's try one more. That's all we'll have time for. Oh, we got time for at least three. I can't imagine how this one will be too difficult. We're gonna do river and piano and Wade goes first. All, right? River Walk. Walk.


Okay. Walkway. Mm. Way to go. I like it. So Mark's word is go, Oh no, that's backwards. Oh no, I went down the wrong path. I keep making it backwards in my head. I keep making it backwards. Are you, are you thinking like from the end back to where we are? Or are you just like flipping things around in your head? No, I think of like a word that goes with piano, but this time I went, ah, piano bar. It's perfect. I'll go backwards from there. And then I start connecting to that and I'm like, That's not how the game works Anyway. What, what was your word again? Wait, I've completely forgotten at this point. Go. Okay. All. right. Got it. Go low, Low key. Ah, shit. God dammit. Fuck. Every time it comes back to me, it's not my plan.


I gotta rethink it all over again. I was like, oh, keys. He's trying to get the Keys. Why would that key piano? Just 'cause it's associated with me doesn't mean it helps. I don't know man. It's, I thought you were gonna go low bar and then it's jump right there. No, no, no. What are you gonna go bar, piano. It's stupid. Low key. Nothing. No, no, no. Low key. All. right? Key. Oh. Oh. I'm laughing because I believe in you and this is very good. Positive stuff that we're I I mean Keyhole. Oh. Oh no, no. What are you doing?


I, holy moly. Okay. Is that your answer? Are we going with Holy moly, He has to go with it. It's like chess. You said it out loud. Oh, Okay. so I moly might be an end of the line. Oh, hole. Hole. Hole. Hole. Hole is not one Hole in the wall. Hole in the wall. Okay. Hole in the wall. Fuck. Why did I think that was a term? Because that's what I was hoping you were going for. Hey, I gave it to you. Why did I think wall piano was a thing? I thought, I thought wall piano was a thing.


Wait, if you could define it. What is a wall piano Mark? I, I thought it was like piano in the wall. I dunno. I just, I dunno why I thought that. I was like, yeah, that's a thing that exists. I've got a word I want to get to, but I don't know how we're gonna get there from here. Oh no. Okay. All, right. Oh Mark, did we just have the same thought? I can't wait to fuck this up for you guys. I was gonna say, is it Wall bar is a thing, right? Whether it's a bar on the wall or it's an actual bar. Bar embedded into the wall. I think wall bar could be many things, but it's real. Right? Wall bar, If you Google wall bar, there is a consistent thing that comes up, Right?


That's a thing. Yeah, it's A thing. Okay. Okay. I'll allow it. I'll allow it. Wall bar, Bring it home. Wade bar piano. That's a thing, right? You have to say it like you wanna say it. That's the rule Bar piano. Oh Shit. Is that a thing? Every time I, if I look up bar piano, it just comes up. Piano bar. Oh no, I think that that's correct. That's not the word I was trying to get us. I think our definition of what is and is not a thing has been pretty loose. I was willing to give you bar piano purely in the context of like, oh, it's a piano in a bar. It's a bar piano. Okay, good. Okay cool. Because like it's it, it does have a a meaning. I feel like that's distinct, right? It's not a concert piano.


It's a bar piano. So it's like, it's a little sticky. I Want a grand piano. So bad Grand. Grand was one I thought you guys could get to, but that's Where I was trying to get, I was like All, right? Something, something grand. But how do you end in grand is the hard thing. Yeah, that was a tough thing. I couldn't think of it. Stand grand. Oh, All. right? Give us another, we're getting better At this. That one was much shorter. We had River walk Walkway. Way to go. Go. Low. Low. Key Key Hole. Hole into Wall. Wall Bar Barbie, you know, okay. When you read it all together there it sounds a little bit more unhinged. We'll Do speed round this time. This is, this is where I'll give you one I feel like could be done super efficient. We're starting at train and we're ending at station clock.

You got a point for bonkers conquers harassment. Nice tight elbow. He's a con man. Lightsaber, fair point uplift. Fuck you load up per clock. Da shoe and Turkey. Wade. An order means nothing.

Bule Mark you earned a total of 11 points. Good. And like I said, good, the order means nothing. I didn't say the loser first for any particular reason I picked at random. Wade, you earned 12 points. Yes. Turns out the random order is the same as if I had read the Loser for I wrote you guys down in a different order than usual. so I tried to mix it up. Woo.


Honestly, you guys in the lightning rounds, I feel like I missed some points and I feel like Mark, I might have missed one or two but I think I missed one for Wade. No, it's okay. It was close. It was quite the competition. You know what people will always remember this for other than maybe Bual, which I hope they do is Sheath de East Really started off strong with Saber in sheath and sheath of De East. Yeah.

I, that's just my attitude every day you got dressed for the job Wade. Give the actual winner speech. All, right? I won.
