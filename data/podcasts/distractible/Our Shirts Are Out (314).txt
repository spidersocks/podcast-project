Sit back and prepare to be distracted and enjoy the show.

5 (2m 47s):
Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Distractible. I'm today's host. Why? Because the wheel favors me. And really, that's pretty much it. Join as always with my co-host, mark and Bob. Hey boys, how y'all doing? Hi.

0 (2m 60s):
Hello.

5 (3m 1s):
I'm good. Great.

0 (3m 5s):
Did you want more? Did

5 (3m 6s):
You? Nope. I wanted one word answers only. You

0 (3m 8s):
Didn't say anything about small talk or anything but it in

5 (3m 10s):
One word. How are you?

0 (3m 12s):
Sad is kind of a downer, but I'm gonna go sad, actually. Sad and

5 (3m 16s):
Good. Alright. I excellent. Well, if you've never been here before, this is the show where one of us hosts the other two compete for points. And I don't give them enough time to talk or explain much about what's going on until right now when I say, Hey, small talk.

0 (3m 26s):
Oh, okay.

5 (3m 28s):
Would you like to elaborate on any of the things you've said?

0 (3m 30s):
Sure. Well, it's confusing 'cause of how time works, right. But right now we're in the future.

5 (3m 36s):
That's the last episodes thing

0 (3m 38s):
Whom ever is listening or watching this. You are in the future. But right now it's two days before Lexi has surgery. Lexi is my dog for anyone who doesn't know. And she has a cancerous tumor on her little leg. Honestly, it's been all good news. The, we took her in for a routine checkup and they were like, well she's got a little mass on her leg. And I was like, yep, I asked you to look at that. And they're like, well, we think it's cancer. And it was. But all subsequent tests have been like best case scenario. So it is still needs to be removed. But otherwise, like no big metastases or anything. And it seems to be a very slow growing, not very aggressive type of mast cell tumor, I think is what it is.

0 (4m 20s):
Anyway, she has a surgery And it should be fine. She handles anesthesia pretty well. She's otherwise healthy, aside from being 12 years old. But that's been really stressful. She should be fine, but that doesn't really mean anything when you're about to drop off your dog for a big surgery. And so in the future you'll know if anything happened. I don't know. I probably won't tweet about it or anything. I don't, I don't social media anymore at all, but we'll talk about that next time. But for right now, I'm stressed. Been trying to be chill about it, but it's really stressful and I don't like it.

5 (4m 52s):
Feel like a bit of a dick for cutting you off on the sad earlier now.

0 (4m 54s):
Yeah, well I considered not leading with that 'cause that's not any kind of thing we usually do for small talk. But I honestly can hardly think about anything else. So I'm not trying to bring everyone down. 'cause honestly, the odds are she'll be perfectly fine and she's not gonna like the surgery, but she should recover just fine and not have cancer anymore. But until it's all done, you know, that means much. It's stressful.

5 (5m 14s):
That's a pretty big thing. Yeah. Well I'm rooting for her. I mean, we've known Lexi for a long time. She's a great dog. Just got to see the other day. So obviously we're all pulling for her. Yeah,

0 (5m 22s):
You saw her three days ago or whatever. Right. She's like totally healthy except for a little lump on her leg.

5 (5m 28s):
Yeah. And she was laying between us on our little dog bed and you like you bumped the dog bed very bravely with your elbow and she gave you a look. Like, what the

0 (5m 36s):
Fuck? Since she found out what cancer is, she is insufferable every, she's like, gimme a french fry. And you're like, ah, I'm eating. She's like, cancer french fry. It's like, damn dog. You don't even know what that means. Like I know it gets me french fries, so come on. Oh well

6 (5m 57s):
I'm sorry about that.

0 (5m 58s):
No, that's okay. She'll be fine

6 (6m 0s):
In my life.

5 (6m 2s):
Yeah. Why is your life better than Bob's tell us

6 (6m 4s):
Nothing but sunshine and rainbows. No, I,

0 (6m 7s):
You got something happy for me to think about.

6 (6m 9s):
No, not really. I mean, I guess, but,

0 (6m 12s):
Oh, okay.

6 (6m 12s):
Let me try to find sun, silver wine in here. Nope, nothing. Anyway, me and my life, nothing to do with any of that. I, I feel like I'm becoming a manager.

0 (6m 28s):
You have a strong urge to wear khakis and polos or,

6 (6m 31s):
I mean, I'm starting to, man, I'm starting to

5 (6m 33s):
Do you answer to like a regional manager and you have a bunch of people that are like, Hey, go restock the shelves.

6 (6m 38s):
I mean, kind of, kind of. Actually, I don't know, I don't know when my life turned into the way that it's starting to go down, because I love being in the creative seed of everything. I like doing that. But when you're, you know, working on a movie or anything, you know, the director, you know, there's a lot of other roles to fill. And I was like, that's always been a temporary thing. You joined a crew for that. But now that I have more like direct hands-on work with my team of editors and cloak and the workshop that I'm trying to build with all the printers, it's a lot of just managing. And not that I don't mind doing that. It's just like suddenly I, I feel like it's like just as you grow older, you just feel like you're shoved into this kind of like role.

6 (7m 21s):
And there's really, it's, it's like all the things that I want to do are happening, but it's like I'm suddenly need to do all these, I have to be a responsible adult. I have to kind of coordinate. I have to plan. I hate planning. I hate scheduling. I hate it. And yet I had a big, I scheduled a meeting yesterday to have a meeting about scheduling you.

0 (7m 41s):
Whoa. You scheduled a scheduling meeting? I

6 (7m 45s):
Did that. That's not me. Who am I?

0 (7m 48s):
No, that's not good at all.

5 (7m 50s):
You also had the, a very creative double negative where, like you said, like, not that I don't mind managing.

6 (7m 56s):
I'm trying, I mean exactly what I say I want everyone to

0 (7m 59s):
Know and the nicest way possible. It does not sound like a thing that you're particularly suited for. My dude.

6 (8m 5s):
No, it's not. It really isn't. But I'm getting better and that's concerning to me, right? It's, well,

5 (8m 12s):
To be fair, there was a lot of room there for that.

6 (8m 15s):
Oh well come on man. No, I, I was closed off to it. Please

0 (8m 19s):
Mark, take points away. Take some points away for that. Yeah, I try

5 (8m 22s):
It. Try it. Sure. Try it.

6 (8m 27s):
What the fuck is true?

5 (8m 28s):
Laugh.

0 (8m 30s):
Yeah, your real laugh. What the hell? A

5 (8m 31s):
True laugh came out again. Damn it. I gotta head that better.

6 (8m 35s):
Anyway. Yeah. So I'm doing a lot of that. But it is cool because when you are in this place where you are coordinating a team effort and you're doing it, I think, okay, hopefully, God, I hope they don't hate me. I hope I'm really not Michael scouting it in there.

0 (8m 48s):
Dude, that feeling never goes away in any situation where you're hitting in charge of anyone for any reason, man. Is that always in the back of your mind? Or maybe not for people who like being managers, but I, any time I've ever had to be like any slightly managing anyone, I'm always like, God, but they fucking hate me. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh well it needs to happen, but, oh, but you better do your job. Oh, through

6 (9m 13s):
A team effort. Like Jason's been helping build this workshop and then John, my buddy John came over just the past couple days also helping. And it's amazing. Like what kind of just three nerd brains can get together and kind of figure out. 'cause we, as soon as we were all in the same room, we just started talking tools. And I don't care if that's a sign of getting older. It was awesome. Yes. We were just talking about random tools, workshop stuff, 3D printers. We were talking about lighting kits, like how to make whatever we wanted to make. And then, because John's much more experienced in 3D printing than I am and kind of like fabricating in general. And so it's like that got me talking about SLA printers and as something resin printing was never something that I really thought about.

6 (9m 53s):
But I was like, if we have more people here to help maintain these machines and get the, the filtration, 'cause it has a lot of fumes coming out there. I don't know. You know, it sucks that I'm doing less of the actual creative, but also it opens up doors to creative that I would not ordinarily be able to do just by myself. You know what I mean?

0 (10m 12s):
I need more people to talk tools with. I don't know, you guys have noticed, but I'm slowly accumulating those poser miniature toolboxes back here. And I'm in, I can't God tools, man tools. Whoa, wait, what a tool. It's outta the box and everything. Wow.

5 (10m 31s):
Bob and I held these up last time together. We, we each

6 (10m 34s):
Had our, what an incredible tool.

0 (10m 35s):
I got one of those somewhere over here.

6 (10m 37s):
Someone was really upset when I said or had a problem with me saying that CNC was becoming more accessible. And they were like, whoa, those is crazy. Like the only thing not accessible about it is the price. And I'm like, what did you think I meant? What do you think I meant by that? The prices are coming down. They're more accessible.

5 (10m 53s):
This is not a podcast for poor people. If you can't afford a CNC machine, why are you watching this podcast? Didn't you read the, the fine print before clicking watch?

6 (11m 4s):
But it's crazy because all this is becoming more accessible. Even 3D printing is becoming more accessible now. I'm not sponsored by them and I don't even know how good this is or how bad it is or unreliable. But a company called Allego, you guys know about El

0 (11m 17s):
Ah, obviously.

6 (11m 19s):
Yeah. I didn't know, I didn't know about Allego until I I saw this insert

5 (11m 22s):
Something with Gwyneth Paltrow Eleg go joke. That's funny.

0 (11m 26s):
Give yourself points for that one buddy. Yeah man

5 (11m 30s):
Guys, I'm winning right now.

0 (11m 34s):
Yeah.

6 (11m 35s):
Editors make three copies of me. All right, thank you.

0 (11m 39s):
Blow up the other two. Back to one

6 (11m 44s):
Who made this 3D printer. That's a lot like the bamboo lab that I have, which costs like $1,200 for $300. An enormous drop in price. And it has the same build volume. It's probably not as fast, but it's the same type of printer and it's just, it's probably not as able to get the temperatures like as precisely controlled. I bet there's some shortcomings there. It's cheaper. It's 300 bucks though versus 1200. That's 25% the price. You could buy four of those for one of the bamboo labs.

5 (12m 14s):
Yeah. If you couldn't afford one for 1200, you can definitely afford four for 1200.

6 (12m 18s):
Yes, exactly. Why buy one which you could buy four also Prusa.

0 (12m 22s):
That's basically a business.

6 (12m 24s):
It is, it is

5 (12m 24s):
Cheaper than a PC nowadays.

6 (12m 26s):
Prusa, which is a company that's like very famous for kind of like helping build the 3D printing landscape. They made Prusa slicer, which is like, I think the backbones of a lot of slicers for other 3D printers. And it's like they are also coming out with one that is competing with the bamboo lab in terms of price called the core something something Prusa. Hey Allego, you could sit, sit, sit aside. Prusa,

0 (12m 55s):
We play favorites here.

6 (12m 56s):
Yeah, I'll play favorites to whoever gives me stuff. Give,

5 (13m 1s):
We're desperate.

6 (13m 2s):
Would you like a 3D printer? Wade? What would you print? Oh,

5 (13m 6s):
When I forget my slippers upstairs. Maybe I'd print a pair to go back up.

0 (13m 10s):
Wait, I honestly think given the state of technology, even you could successfully 3D print something if you got a 3D printer that, that you didn't need to set up. Oh,

5 (13m 20s):
I could listen.

0 (13m 21s):
You can use AI to generate 3D imagery. Now

5 (13m 25s):
I could, I'm smart enough to do it. But

0 (13m 27s):
Like, and then there are tools that will scan a 3D image into like a file that is printable. You can literally just say something like, make me a statue of me. And as long as it knows who you are, it could generate a file that you could put on your printer that you could print without having to learn almost anything. Which I know is your favorite. I

5 (13m 50s):
I could do it. Listen, y'all, I I play the fool very well, but I am a smart guy. I just don't want, I don't want much. Like, I, I just like, what would I print that I would actually want? Like that's my problem. I just don't want things.

6 (14m 3s):
It is true, right? Like a 3D printing thing is kind of cool for like replacement parts, making organizers. That's probably what most people would make. You make tool organizers. You make shelving organizers, you make

0 (14m 15s):
Dude grid finity. Oh God, what? I print the shit outta some grid finity if I had a bigger volume printer.

6 (14m 20s):
But for me, what I'm building the workshop for is I wanna be able to make any kind of prop any kind of set decoration that we would ever need to make in my own workshop.

5 (14m 29s):
That makes

6 (14m 29s):
Sense. There's a lot of things in, in various movies. Anything that you're making, you need to like, have set decoration. You need to have props and you can make some really intricate things with 3D printing quickly and cheaply. And you can iterate and make multiple versions of it. I'm not looking for things to sell, but honestly, if someone wanted to, they can open an Etsy shopper on eBay or probably even Amazon. I bet. And you can sell your own things if you have the right designs and you make things that are useful to other people. Like everyone can print. But if you just think about what there's a need for, that's, that's capitalism baby. Everyone can make money, but it's not about that sometimes,

0 (15m 3s):
Which is really the point.

6 (15m 4s):
Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, well of course. Well we don't say that out loud. Well

0 (15m 8s):
That's the whole point. That's the only point.

6 (15m 10s):
Anyway. SLA Hey whoever wants to give me a bunch of really cool SLA printers, I will sell my soul for it. I will shill out, I'll shill, i'll SI don't shill often, but I'll shill. I'll shill for it. I'll shill all over you.

0 (15m 25s):
Shill hard.

5 (15m 26s):
All right. And that's Mark's allotted time to beg for stuff.

6 (15m 30s):
I do spend most of my small talk begging for things and I don't get a lot doesn't work guys. Why is it working?

5 (15m 37s):
It has been a theme since when did we start this podcast?

6 (15m 41s):
No one's given me anything.

5 (15m 44s):
Please. They will. They're this time they're watching Ponderosa or whatever you said they're watching. It's

0 (15m 50s):
Gonna work eventually.

5 (15m 52s):
Ponderosa No, that's a restaurant. Prusa.

0 (15m 54s):
Prusa. Yeah. Yeah. Ponderosa

6 (15m 56s):
Prusa. Yeah. Anyway, it's probably 'cause I don't check my business email

0 (16m 0s):
You, you just have a bunch of emails just sitting in there like Mark, I really, Hey Mark,

6 (16m 8s):
No one knows how to get to me. So I'm sure that's it. Anyway, yeah, that's me.

5 (16m 14s):
We've gone through the small talk, we've made our pleas for items. I guess by the time this comes out it won't really make much of a difference probably anymore. But obviously we all want what's best for Lexi. So let's keep Lexi in our minds. But for now I'm going to try to give us all a different kind of distraction 'cause I'm hosting an episode and I do have a topic for today. Last time I hosted, if you all remember we did an episode called Bring Them Back, where we went through some old phrases and

0 (16m 38s):
Is that what it was called? That's

5 (16m 39s):
What I had it called in my notes. Wasn't

0 (16m 41s):
It called right in the sauce box? Maybe

5 (16m 43s):
It was called right in the sauce box in actuality. But it's bring them back in my heart. Ah, I see the sauce box pretty good though. Pretty good for today I'm gonna do something a little bit the same and we're gonna do bring them back to two

0 (16m 55s):
Ype

5 (16m 56s):
Or back out of the sauce box.

0 (16m 59s):
The editors make three of me. No, actually just

6 (17m 5s):
Re-use the same assets. Don't cut out new stuff. I don't want you to work at that, but

0 (17m 10s):
Yep.

5 (17m 11s):
I don't know what they're asking of you, but you can just leave me alone.

0 (17m 14s):
Editors don't touch me.

5 (17m 16s):
No, no.

6 (17m 18s):
Only put all of our cutouts in Wade's camera. Get

5 (17m 21s):
'em outta here. This is my personal space.

6 (17m 24s):
I'm so sorry editors. I know you're trying to get ahead on these

5 (17m 27s):
Episodes, taking these off. I don't wanna listen to you all anymore. This is much better.

0 (17m 33s):
I have a lot more specific requests for you editors. So pay attention during today's episode.

5 (17m 39s):
Enough of your editor needs. It's time for my weighty leads or something. I dunno.

6 (17m 45s):
Yeah, go on,

0 (17m 47s):
Go on.

5 (17m 48s):
So I had a long list of things here. We didn't get to as many as I would've liked. So we're going back in and we're gonna start off with a doozy here. I think you guys could figure this one out. Bob, I'm gonna let you go first.

0 (17m 59s):
Oh, okay.

5 (18m 0s):
For no particular reason, but you're gonna go first. Sure. Tell me Bob, what is a giggle mug?

0 (18m 7s):
That's a giggle mug. That's a measurement of liquid volume. That's what that is. Derives from the amount by volume of absence one needs to drink, you know, in one glass before you start giggling because you're having funny little, you know, hallucinations, psychosomatic effects from the drink or whatever. So,

5 (18m 34s):
Okay, so a method, a measurement of like drunkenness or highness.

0 (18m 38s):
So it's, it's like a, you know, there's like a high ball and there's like a, a rocks glass and the, it's lesser known, but the giggle mug is of that origin.

5 (18m 48s):
Okay, mark. Now assuming Bob isn't correct, which he could be.

0 (18m 52s):
I am.

5 (18m 53s):
What do you think a giggle mug is?

6 (18m 56s):
It's a, it's a, oh, like I don't think we can mention that. I was gonna say a fun non wizard person. A funny non wizarding person. But I don't think Harry Potter machines are kosher right now.

5 (19m 8s):
Ah, mug goal.

6 (19m 10s):
A giggle mug goal. Yeah. You know, no, I'll have to rethink of one on the fly. I'm just gonna keep flapping my gums until something comes out. Oh boy. Here comes the ideas. There're about to flow. The genius is cooking. Let me cook and here it is. And it's about all I've got an answer. I forgot what the word is. Circling back to that in my head.

5 (19m 29s):
Giggle mug.

6 (19m 30s):
I didn't need your help. Go away. I got this. Get outta my head.

5 (19m 34s):
Okay,

6 (19m 35s):
I am thinking about the answer. Oh, here

5 (19m 37s):
It is. In two sentences.

6 (19m 42s):
That was one.

0 (19m 46s):
One sentence. Go on.

6 (19m 48s):
Okay. Giggle mug.

5 (19m 50s):
That is another word

6 (19m 51s):
For dust bunnies.

5 (19m 53s):
Oh, okay. Yeah,

6 (19m 54s):
It's just another word for dust bunnies. It's

5 (19m 56s):
Actually a sequel to the song Jitterbug. I'm kidding. A giggle mug is a person who smiles a lot. They're always smiling.

0 (20m 5s):
Sincerely. That was my guess. And I was like, there's no way. It's that. That's just what it is.

5 (20m 11s):
Their mug has a permanent gig.

0 (20m 16s):
That one sucks. I don't like that one.

6 (20m 18s):
Yeah,

5 (20m 19s):
Okay. Well it said the same thing about you two.

6 (20m 22s):
I don't care. They're smiling all stupid. Why do I want their opinion?

0 (20m 25s):
That's what I'm saying,

5 (20m 26s):
Mark.

6 (20m 28s):
Oh,

5 (20m 28s):
What does it mean to take the egg?

6 (20m 30s):
It means it's a tactic, right? So if you're unpopular, you might risk someone throwing an egg at you. Even in this economy. Yeah. I mean especially if they're in this economy. They really hate you.

5 (20m 42s):
They really hate you. They're throwing eggs now. Yeah.

6 (20m 44s):
So you learn to predict when a spherical white object is coming at you. Aim your head towards it. Open your unhinged, your jaw, relax your throat, and you take that egg and you imbibe it.

5 (20m 57s):
This is unrelated. I was at Skyline the other day with Molly and I was eating a cheese coney.

6 (21m 2s):
What does this have to do with this? What is this? How is this gonna

5 (21m 5s):
Have to do with, I was down to like my last bite of cheese. Coney. So there's a little bit of bread and a chili cheese, whatever. And the hot dog, a little bit of hot dog left. I went to take a bite and I don't know if I always do this or if I just happen to forget how to eat for a second. But I kind of like Stans not Stanley steamer. I kinda like vacuumed in the last bite. And I sucked that last bit of hot dog right out of the bun And it flew back, hit me in the back of the throat and I like immediately gagged and choked. But then I found it hilarious 'cause I gagged on a wiener and I laughed while I was choking. Anyway, that happened. That's

6 (21m 38s):
Great. That's great man. You Stanley steamer that thing right out there.

0 (21m 43s):
The old Stanley Steamer,

5 (21m 45s):
The old Stanley steamer made carpet suck. I don't know

6 (21m 49s):
Stanley Steamer.

0 (21m 53s):
I'm so just lost now. What? What is happening?

5 (21m 56s):
What does it mean to take the egg?

0 (21m 58s):
Oh, that's right. When you said it's a tactic, mark, I thought you stole my answer. I'm not gonna lie. But you didn't. It is a tactic, but it's actually, it's more of a rallying cry. It's not a very specific tactic. It's a battlefield thing. Throughout history, men with power who are the type of men who lead militaries have been obsessed with lineage. Right? And so it's sort of a saying that's derived from like, you take the egg as in like make a sun. You take the egg and you make an air or whatever. But on the battlefield, taking the egg means taking the objective. 'cause that's the highest objective that you aspire to, is to make a, make another sun. All the suns,

6 (22m 38s):
Everything is conquest in their eyes as it should be.

0 (22m 42s):
Everything is about power. Everything is about conquest. It's a thing. It's a real thing.

6 (22m 47s):
Oh yeah.

0 (22m 49s):
So this is the Lords on the battlefield used to just scream this as they were mounting a charge toward the enemy. Just like take the egg. Good. And then swords, clang, and very dramatic.

6 (23m 2s):
I believe it.

5 (23m 3s):
So I don't have a long explanation as to why this is the answer.

0 (23m 7s):
You're saying these definitions aren't five minutes long. Like what Mark and I give you every single time.

5 (23m 12s):
They're not. However, Bob, I'm gonna give you this one because I take the egg. No means it means to win.

6 (23m 21s):
No,

5 (23m 22s):
No. And getting the objective is like

6 (23m 26s):
No

5 (23m 26s):
Winning. I mean that's pretty close. Sorry,

6 (23m 30s):
My light is all broken too. God dammit.

5 (23m 33s):
Yeah, I mean I wasn't expecting whenever he was like, he was like tactics. I was like, All right, well he's gonna be with Mark here taking some kind of egg to the face. But he is like, no, it's take the objective to make an error to ah.

6 (23m 44s):
Oh, I spilled.

0 (23m 46s):
Mark, what are you doing man? You All right? I'm trying. My

8 (23m 50s):
Lights falling over and it's not standing up straight. 'cause I don't know why

5 (23m 54s):
Do they have like a stand You can put 'em on? Or do they just tap to the wall or

8 (23m 58s):
No? Yeah, but I don't have it right now, so I balancing it on a fucking lens. It's fine, don't worry about it. It's

0 (24m 5s):
Fine. Balancing on a lens. That's, that's my my second top pick for that sort of thing. Stand it came with lens.

8 (24m 12s):
I don't have it here. I don't know where it went. All it keeps twisting. There we go.

6 (24m 19s):
Hi guys.

0 (24m 20s):
How are you doing? You All right?

5 (24m 21s):
Nice and dry over there.

6 (24m 22s):
That's fine. It's a little spill. Tiny spill. Not a big spill. Tiny. Might as well not be a spill.

5 (24m 27s):
Do you need to clean it?

6 (24m 29s):
No, I, I sopped it. It's Sopped.

0 (24m 31s):
Oh, it's Sopped. Oh heck. Okay.

5 (24m 34s):
As long as it's Sopped.

6 (24m 35s):
Yeah, I sopped it. Oh, it's Sopped

0 (24m 37s):
Bro. You sopping.

6 (24m 38s):
I've sobbed past tense. You

0 (24m 40s):
Soap

6 (24m 41s):
Has beens. No,

0 (24m 43s):
You su. You su in here

6 (24m 45s):
Sued. I supped. I sued.

5 (24m 48s):
Well Bob, were to you first this time while he's sopping and sucking. Tell me, what are whooper ups,

0 (24m 56s):
Whooper ups,

5 (24m 57s):
Whooper, ups,

0 (24m 59s):
Whooper up,

5 (25m 0s):
Whoop ups.

0 (25m 1s):
This one's another one that's deceptively easy. This is another one that's I think English in America. We just call those pull-ups. But in America we also just call those diapers. And in the UK they call them nappies for some reason. So of course we call 'em pull-ups, they call 'em whooper up

5 (25m 21s):
Like a diaper.

0 (25m 23s):
It's like a, yeah. Transitional like diaper underwear thing. So in case a young-ish kid has like an accident or whatever, they soaks it up, keeps 'em dry. Whooper up. Okay.

5 (25m 34s):
Incorrect.

6 (25m 35s):
Obviously this is a tragedy of a word. A truly sad phrase. This is what happens when someone is so far down the rabbit hole of whippets that they can't even say the word anymore and they're just like begging. Please give me some whipper ups.

5 (25m 55s):
Okay, this is gonna sound really stupid, but what is a whip? It Is it like the song when Rah comes along You can whip it. I'm

6 (26m 2s):
Not sure exactly what they're inhaling, but it's an inhalant. Is it like it's whipping cream

0 (26m 7s):
Cany? It's the stuff that's in aerosol cans, right? It's

5 (26m 11s):
Oh, okay. Yeah.

0 (26m 11s):
Is that like, it's not nitrous, is it?

6 (26m 14s):
I don't know what is, let's not even say what it is. 'cause no way. No one's gonna do it.

0 (26m 19s):
Whatever gas is in aerosol aerosol, like whipping cream cans, that sort of thing. The whip it is. The gas will will have an effect on you. But also they put stuff in it to make it taste like butthole. And so it's really gross to do that. It's really unpleasant.

6 (26m 34s):
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure that one is terrible. Absolutely. Brain cell destroying.

0 (26m 40s):
Yeah, I think it's like immediate brain damage type of stuff. Like it'll make you feel funny, but also your one-to-one correlation of losing things you knew before you took your whippets

5 (26m 50s):
At the cost of living.

6 (26m 52s):
Yeah.

5 (26m 52s):
Okay. Don't do that. So you think whooper ups are like that? Yeah,

6 (26m 56s):
It's just tragic drugs.

5 (26m 58s):
Okay. Either I'm giving to give you both a point or neither one a point. 'cause you're both wrong. But you both said things that are bad.

0 (27m 6s):
What's, how's mine bad?

5 (27m 8s):
Well, it's a, in a good way.

6 (27m 9s):
I did phrase mine entirely bad. So yeah, if

5 (27m 12s):
You call someone a whooper up And it's like a diaper, that doesn't sound like a compliment. Right? Whereas if you call someone a whooper up And it's like a bad drug, it's also bad. A whooper ups an inferior singer.

0 (27m 23s):
What

5 (27m 25s):
Course? It's an inferior singers are whooper ups.

0 (27m 29s):
I've been needing a word for singers who are less good than myself.

5 (27m 33s):
Now those are whooper ups. Now you have a word.

6 (27m 36s):
Is that just

0 (27m 36s):
Like a, a modification of whipper snappers that singers made their own somehow? Like

5 (27m 42s):
Sometimes I get a description, I get anything this time I literally got inferior singers. Period. That is the extent of the explanation I've gotten for this one. So therefore that's all the knowledge that exists in the world about whipper ups.

0 (27m 56s):
Okay.

6 (27m 57s):
All

5 (27m 57s):
Right. Mental floss, old phrases we should bring back. They know what they're talking about. This is all the information that exists in the record. The rest of it was in Pompeii. Very sad.

6 (28m 6s):
Very sad, tragic. Extremely tragic.

5 (28m 8s):
Mark, what is a rain? Napper

6 (28m 11s):
Kidnapper who uses rain as cover for his crimes or her crimes?

0 (28m 16s):
Yeah,

6 (28m 18s):
It's true. People use rain to cover up their crimes all the time.

5 (28m 22s):
Rain napper

6 (28m 23s):
Because it's a convenient moment where, I don't know, something, something. I heard it on TV once. I don't watch TV actually. So,

5 (28m 30s):
Okay, the crimes are covered up. The rain napper was prepared. That's not like a cool villain name. The rain napper. All right, Bob,

0 (28m 37s):
This is actually a conspiracy theory. This is not what the government calls it, but this is what us normies call it because we're learning the truth slowly and surely. This is actually a type of aircraft, experimental aircraft that it'll fly into clouds that are about to rain naturally And it stops rain from falling so that the people who control it can control who gets water and who doesn't. So the rain nappers sort of what, what we like to call, I'm sure it has some official, you know, government designation, but

6 (29m 16s):
Is that the same technology that makes targets really sad people and creates just one rain cloud over them and them alone?

0 (29m 23s):
They keep that for that exact purpose. Yeah, I think it's a different drone tech that actually sends those out. But the rain napper is how they gather the sadness clouds. And then they have a different platform for the distributing the sadness.

6 (29m 37s):
I don't know why they harvest the sadness clouds. Like they should stop that. It's unethical. They get it by separating baby clouds from their parent clouds. They're super sad, depressed.

5 (29m 49s):
It's an umbrella. Nappers an umbrella.

6 (29m 51s):
No it's not.

0 (29m 53s):
I was close. It stops rain from hitting things that don't want to have rain on them or that the man doesn't want to have rain on.

6 (30m 3s):
You know,

0 (30m 4s):
Depends who's holding the umbrella

6 (30m 6s):
Or the woman.

0 (30m 9s):
Yeah. I mean, yes.

6 (30m 10s):
Okay.

5 (30m 11s):
All right. Well if Mark agrees, yeah, I'll give you the point.

0 (30m 13s):
Alright.

6 (30m 15s):
It it makes sense. It makes sense.

5 (30m 17s):
What does it mean to have your flag out? Bob, you're first.

0 (30m 21s):
It's just a fancy way to say your dick's hanging outta your pants.

5 (30m 25s):
Okay.

6 (30m 25s):
I concur. It's, it's your dick. It's, yeah, it's your dick outta your pants

0 (30m 30s):
At like the, you know, family barbecue or whatever. Like, Hey Jay, Jerry, your jay, your flag's out. What

5 (30m 35s):
About being soapy eyed? Mark,

6 (30m 36s):
Were we right?

5 (30m 38s):
I'll tell you in a minute. I'm being soapy eyed. Just quick. One word, two words.

6 (30m 42s):
Hold on, don't rush

5 (30m 43s):
Me. Oh, I'm gonna rush you. 'cause I've got a whole line in here. This quick fire round.

0 (30m 48s):
I don't know if Mark's playing along with that or

5 (30m 50s):
It's fine. He's doing his best. This is quick for him.

6 (30m 54s):
Soapy,

5 (30m 55s):
We've seen him handle two sentences. Let's, let's give him a minute for soap. Opioid.

6 (30m 59s):
Shut off. Shut up. Shut off. Shut.

0 (31m 1s):
As soon as the clock starts ticking, mark goes from casually making jokes and stuff to being like,

6 (31m 6s):
Oh, soap eyes. That's exactly in my head right now. Anything Soap in the eyes? Anything? Come on brain. Come on. What about eyes with soap in 'em? Shut up brain. Not that something else. That's literally what's going on over here.

0 (31m 23s):
You could do it, but hey, it's allowed to be eyes with soap in them. That's a valid response. So then I

6 (31m 28s):
Was trying to like, okay, break it up. Break the word up. So P eyes, that's just pee in the eyes instead of soap. Come on brain. Get out there. Get out there. Get out there. Yeah. It's the inability to come up with an idea.

5 (31m 46s):
All right. Soap.

0 (31m 48s):
Soap, soapy eyes. That is, that's that look that kids get when you tell them not to do something. And clearly they're not even listening and they're just glazed over. They got the soap PIs.

5 (32m 3s):
All right, what about being full is a tick.

0 (32m 5s):
That's about confidence. If you're, it's like a check mark, right? I'm so sure I'm full as a tick. Tick it off

5 (32m 13s):
Mark. Full as a tick.

6 (32m 14s):
The greatest erection of your entire life.

5 (32m 19s):
Excellent. What if you're seeing snakes,

6 (32m 21s):
You see the greatest erection of your entire life.

5 (32m 25s):
All right, Bob. Seeing snakes.

0 (32m 28s):
Actually Mark is just right on that one.

5 (32m 30s):
Okay, what about being canned up?

0 (32m 32s):
I mean, clearly that just means that you're in jail. But I'm gonna go ahead and say that what that means for serious is you're on the phone. 'cause you're talking on a string with two cans on the ends of it. Canned up.

5 (32m 44s):
Of course Mark canned up

6 (32m 46s):
The greatest direction of your entire life.

0 (32m 49s):
Canned up. Oh, you know what? Wait a minute. Yeah,

5 (32m 52s):
Mark, what if you're zazzle

6 (32m 56s):
Direction entire her life. Straight up

5 (32m 60s):
Zazzle man, you're on a fun thing that you're, that's happening right now. You'll see Bob Zazzle

0 (33m 7s):
Mark's actually close. But that's actually the emotion that you feel when you're in the locker room with your buddy after a nice like workout or whatever and he's having the greatest direction of his entire life. You're the one who gets zazzle.

5 (33m 23s):
What about being owl?

0 (33m 25s):
That's when a woman or anyone but historically a woman, 'cause it's always a woman in this context is looking so good. Like they're dressed up and they're looking so ridiculously good that people are literally snapping their necks to look at them. You know, an owl can like look, turn its head all the way around. Yeah. Getting, getting Ed.

5 (33m 45s):
Okay, mark.

6 (33m 46s):
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. But I'll come up with something different. Sorry.

0 (33m 49s):
Sorry bud. No,

6 (33m 50s):
No it because it makes sense. You're good just getting Ed,

5 (33m 54s):
Not gonna lie. I thought you were saying when you see a woman, you get the greatest direction of your life. Yeah.

0 (33m 58s):
You thought, but that's Mark's bit.

6 (34m 1s):
No, no. Hey, I'm not a one trick pony. If you're getting Ed, you're getting straight up railed and you just, you make an owl noises. You just getting

5 (34m 12s):
Owl.

6 (34m 14s):
You know when you're getting

5 (34m 15s):
Having great, Ooh. Ooh. Oh man. I love when that happens. Woo. What about if you're getting striped S Swift or Squawked, I'm sorry, squawked. Whacked. Striped. S Swift or whacked? Squawked whacked. Any of those three things. Mark,

0 (34m 32s):
That's about 10 things. But

6 (34m 33s):
You get a promotion because you get stripes, right? Or you, you get stripped of your old rank and they put a new one there. You get squawked, they say it over the radio. This guy got a promotion or

5 (34m 45s):
Is that what

6 (34m 45s):
They call it when they you go up in the military? Yeah,

0 (34m 47s):
That's a promotion.

5 (34m 49s):
Striped S Swift or whacked. Yeah,

6 (34m 52s):
Whacked. Sorry. Whacked. Yeah.

5 (34m 54s):
And S Swift.

6 (34m 55s):
Yeah, they squi it off of you.

5 (34m 57s):
Bob Striped s Swift or whacked

0 (34m 59s):
Is there actually all this is not the full extent of them, but this is representative of the, the like words from comics. This is under the s section of comic book Onia, where your Batman has definitely squ some people and swathed it at them.

5 (35m 18s):
Do you guys remember what pretzel bender was?

6 (35m 20s):
Yes. The fifth element, it's the avatar. It's

0 (35m 22s):
When you're having the most glorious erection of your entire life.

5 (35m 26s):
It meant to peculiar person, a player of the french horn, a wrestler or a heavy drinker.

0 (35m 31s):
Oh right. French horn. That's right.

5 (35m 33s):
Having your flag out, being soapy eyed, full as a tick. Seeing snakes canned up, sozzled owl striped s swift or whacked are ways of being drunk.

0 (35m 42s):
Oh, mark was close.

6 (35m 44s):
I was close

5 (35m 45s):
When he kept going with the erection, I was like, man, if he just said drunk and kept repeating that for everyone. Oh the amount of points that would pour out.

6 (35m 53s):
But how many points did we get?

5 (35m 55s):
I'll give you one each.

0 (35m 57s):
Well that, okay

5 (35m 59s):
Bob, you're up first for this one. Hotter than Dutch love and harvest, what does that mean?

0 (36m 4s):
Hotter than Dutch. Love in harvest?

5 (36m 7s):
Yep. Hotter than Dutch. Love in harvest.

0 (36m 10s):
Well there's nothing hotter than Dutch love and harvest. So that's just the scientific name of the highest temperature it is possible to achieve in the universe.

5 (36m 21s):
Okay.

6 (36m 22s):
What was it

5 (36m 23s):
Again? Hotter than Dutch love in harvest.

6 (36m 26s):
It's just really hot outside and sweaty.

5 (36m 30s):
That is correct. I

6 (36m 31s):
Was, I was assuming 'cause you've been going pretty obvious ones and I was like maybe it's gonna be that. That's what I was thinking in

5 (36m 37s):
My head.

0 (36m 37s):
That's so much more thoughts than the last one where you were just trying not to say soap or eyes. He is, he is learning.

5 (36m 44s):
I wonder if soapy eye means just like the general glaze of drunkenness. Probably. Like you kinda, yeah. That

6 (36m 49s):
Makes so much sense.

0 (36m 50s):
Yeah, it does. Still stupid though. I'm not using to that one.

6 (36m 53s):
Yeah,

5 (36m 54s):
This one's gonna take some explaining from all of us I think together. But here we go. Mark. And the bear got him and full of moist What? And the bear got him and full of moist.

0 (37m 7s):
Did you accidentally delete some words out of that one or,

5 (37m 11s):
I kept rereading it thinking maybe I did, but no. Okay. I will say this is a continuation from the last one. But go ahead. I don't know how, but I I do but I don't know how but

6 (37m 20s):
Okay, I got it. I got it. You're talking about your wing man from the night before was helping you out, went home with the friend who was playing defense and then fell in love, married happily, ever effort. The bear got him and then moist. What was the other of that?

0 (37m 40s):
Full of moist.

6 (37m 41s):
Full of Full of moist.

5 (37m 43s):
Yeah. I'm, I'm guessing this is a related to the hotter than Dutch love and harvest. But you know, Dutch love air got 'em full of moist. It all could connect.

0 (37m 54s):
Yeah. When you say it all together, I totally understand what it is. This is having to do with temperature obviously. And if it's hotter than Dutch love and harvest, but then it, it's cooling off 'cause it's going into the evening time and then the bear got 'em and full of moist. So it's like, yeah, it's hot during the day but at least it cools off when the sun goes down.

5 (38m 19s):
I have the definition. Let me read you the two definitions back to back. People need a lot of ways to describe excessive heat in the days before air conditioning. One phrase was hotter than Dutch love and harvest and the bear got him in full of moist. You might also hear the bear got him. The bear in this case was heat stroke and full of moist.

0 (38m 37s):
No explanation on that part.

5 (38m 38s):
Nope. That's all I got.

0 (38m 40s):
I feel like that's lacking.

6 (38m 42s):
Yeah, we don't need to bring that one back.

5 (38m 44s):
This one's probably pretty self-explanatory. Bob. Hot as a half fucked fox in a forest fire.

0 (38m 53s):
Yeah, I mean that's messed up way to to talk about it I guess. But that's probably when something is so hot that it would burn your hand if you reached out and touched it. 'cause if you reached out and touched a half fucked fox in a forest fire, probably burn your hand skin if you were in that situation.

5 (39m 16s):
Your hand skin if you're not that kind of thing.

0 (39m 19s):
Everyone has hand skin. Don't gimme that. Most people have hand skin. I won't generalize.

5 (39m 24s):
Mark,

6 (39m 25s):
You're experiencing the greatest direction of your entire life. I'm feeling hot half fucked. Fuck at a forest fire baby.

0 (39m 37s):
It kind of works still. I can't even be mad at it. It kind of works.

6 (39m 41s):
Yep. He's writing down all the points I just got for though. Yeah,

5 (39m 44s):
That was, I I did write down points for you. Give him

6 (39m 46s):
Some time, give him some time.

0 (39m 48s):
13 additional points. 'cause it was so correct.

5 (39m 52s):
It's just a regional term from the south for anything hot.

6 (39m 55s):
I'm noticing a theme in your clues here

0 (39m 58s):
That they suck.

5 (39m 59s):
All right.

6 (40m 0s):
I didn't say that. I didn't say that man. I didn't say that.

0 (40m 3s):
Yeah, mark. That's what Mark was gonna say. I just read his mind. Mark.

5 (40m 6s):
What does it mean to Pang weel?

6 (40m 7s):
Wait a minute.

0 (40m 8s):
Yeah. Didn't we do that one?

6 (40m 9s):
Wait a minute. We know this one. Yeah.

5 (40m 11s):
What is it?

6 (40m 12s):
Oh God

5 (40m 14s):
No, we did this one. Oh no.

6 (40m 16s):
Oh no, I just, I just watched right in this sauce box. I actually watched it.

0 (40m 22s):
You were just telling us about how you watched that episode. Oh,

6 (40m 27s):
But that was all the way in yesterday. Who would know that? Pang Weel.

5 (40m 31s):
Yeah.

0 (40m 32s):
Pang Weel.

6 (40m 33s):
I remember my answer. I don't remember what the real answer 'cause I said it was like a, a dance based on a penguin's waddle. But I don't know what you actually said.

5 (40m 41s):
You were paying attention to the wrong person when you watched

6 (40m 44s):
I quit.

5 (40m 45s):
Hey Bob, peg weel.

0 (40m 48s):
I laughed at Mark, but I don't remember either

5 (40m 51s):
To live or go along cheerfully in spite of minor misfortunes.

0 (40m 54s):
I would never ever have guessed that in a million years. I

6 (40m 57s):
Don't even remember you saying that last time. I don't even remember.

0 (40m 59s):
What if he just changes the meetings? Just fuck with us.

6 (41m 2s):
He might've. I bet he did.

5 (41m 4s):
There's, I could link you the article when we're done, but not right now. What is a zb Bob?

0 (41m 11s):
Is this one we've done before or is this new? This is new, right?

5 (41m 14s):
The new one. A zb.

0 (41m 16s):
I am pretty sure a ZB is slang for a cigarette. Hey, hey. Can I bum a zip?

5 (41m 27s):
Okay, mark.

6 (41m 30s):
So in, in the gun world, they call a blocked bullet in the barrel. A squib, right? So a ZB is nothing to do with that at All.

5 (41m 45s):
Right? Okay.

0 (41m 47s):
I thought you were gonna say what a German guy calls it. Get

6 (41m 51s):
Your mind out of the gun world. 'cause we're talking about zbs here.

5 (41m 57s):
Yeah. Get your mind outta the gunner.

0 (41m 59s):
Ah. Ah,

6 (42m 1s):
That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

5 (42m 3s):
Thank you.

9 (42m 4s):
A zb. Okay. All right. Z Huh? A z

5 (42m 10s):
Sure is

9 (42m 12s):
A Z. Yeah. Not the ZAZ.

6 (42m 15s):
Shut up. Don't laugh at me.

5 (42m 17s):
Don't laugh at me.

0 (42m 18s):
I'm not laughing at you. I'm just laughing in the same call as you. Good. It's unrelated.

6 (42m 27s):
A Z's, it's like a instead of a bad car is called lemon. A bad motorcycle is called a z. Ooh.

5 (42m 34s):
Okay.

6 (42m 35s):
You were sold a bad motorbike.

5 (42m 37s):
I like both of your answers. And both of them are tangential. But a zb is just an income. Poop.

0 (42m 43s):
Anum. Poop. What a word.

5 (42m 45s):
Anin. Income poop. Mark. What are bags of mystery? Not of bags. O mystery. O apostrophe. Mystery. Bags of mystery

6 (42m 59s):
Bags. O mystery.

5 (43m 0s):
Bags of mystery.

0 (43m 2s):
We did, we did this one, didn't we?

5 (43m 4s):
Did we move? I don't think we did

6 (43m 5s):
Remember this

0 (43m 5s):
One. I recall mystery recall talking about bags of mystery. But maybe I'm making that up. Maybe

5 (43m 10s):
You just know this one.

6 (43m 11s):
In Mexico, it's called a pinata in Ireland. It's called the bag of mystery. Hang it up in a tree. Take a stick and whack the bag of mysteries.

5 (43m 21s):
If you pick a different country, you might've been close. Bob, what are bags of mystery?

0 (43m 24s):
Bags of mystery is just a term for boobs.

6 (43m 31s):
Tell me,

0 (43m 32s):
I just wanted to have a peek at me. Me neighbor's bags. O mystery. That's creepier than I meant. But you know what I'm getting at? Someone who would call them bags. O Mystery was probably creepy. Be real. I

5 (43m 46s):
Want our viewers and listeners to have the context that if you wanna see your neighbor's bags of mystery, you wanna see their sausages. 'cause bags of mystery are sausages. Bob, what does it mean to give someone the wind?

0 (44m 0s):
It's when you specifically either position your ass in front of their face or their face in front of your ass to fart. And so you're literally giving them the wind when you fart.

5 (44m 11s):
Okay,

6 (44m 12s):
It's close, but this is screaming at someone.

0 (44m 15s):
I like that.

6 (44m 16s):
Giving them the piece of your mind. You're giving them the wind. Not from your south hole. From your north hole.

0 (44m 22s):
Other hole. Different wind.

5 (44m 24s):
Ah, it could be I guess to give someone the wind is to jilt a suitor.

6 (44m 30s):
To what? A suitor. What are you doing to my suitors?

5 (44m 33s):
JILT. Jilt. It's like the end. A relationship. Quickly, quick breakup. Like you weren't expecting it, like you're jilted.

0 (44m 40s):
I think what I suggested would accomplish that.

6 (44m 43s):
So would mine.

5 (44m 44s):
I think screaming at them or farting on them and giving them win. Both could, I think

6 (44m 49s):
Screaming more, more jilting. You know, very jilting.

0 (44m 53s):
Some people scream and stay in love forever. Sometimes you just got screamy. Love some,

6 (44m 57s):
Some people fart lovingly

5 (45m 0s):
In their

6 (45m 1s):
Loved one's directions.

0 (45m 2s):
See that one's, that one feels less generalizable to me. I some people probably do. You're

6 (45m 8s):
Not screaming. I love you. You're screaming. Oh, you,

0 (45m 12s):
Well, people, people have passions. Some people are passion. Sometimes you scream and then you make up. I don't know.

6 (45m 17s):
Oh, no,

5 (45m 18s):
No. I think I've got an easy one for you guys.

0 (45m 21s):
Oh, that's promising.

5 (45m 22s):
Mark, you're up first for this one. What does it mean to give a body the flesh creep. You have a body. The flesh creep.

6 (45m 33s):
I, I don't know about this one, man.

0 (45m 35s):
Yeah, now you know what, it is easy. I remember this one. Now it is easy. I know this one.

6 (45m 41s):
It's, it's holding up, holding up a picture that's phobic to someone's and making them look at it. Or rubbing styrofoam. Yeah.

5 (45m 53s):
Okay. Okay.

6 (45m 54s):
To give someone the shivers.

5 (45m 56s):
Bob,

0 (45m 57s):
This is actually just the, the premise for a movie. Have you guys ever seen weekend at Bernie's?

6 (46m 4s):
No, I haven't, but I know of it

0 (46m 6s):
Where they rig up the, the dead body to move around and do stuff. And it, that's giving a body the flesh creep. It's when you, it's when you rig up a dead body to still pretend like it's alive and to do stuff.

5 (46m 18s):
Mark, I gotta give it to you. To give a body. The flesh creep is to give someone the shivers more so used for like cold, but it's still like that goose bumpy shiver feeling like it's described as the shivers. And you said the shivers. I'm gonna give it to you. That

0 (46m 34s):
Is pretty close.

5 (46m 35s):
But to give a body the flesh creep. AKA, the shivers can be used when it's cold outside. Or, I mean, when you said styrofoam, you know how much I love it. So yeah, I I gotta give you that one.

0 (46m 45s):
Oh, I have some styrofoam.

5 (46m 46s):
Oh, you don't have to do that.

0 (46m 47s):
Does that go through the microphone?

5 (46m 49s):
You would lose points if you tried.

0 (46m 51s):
Wouldn't you like to know?

5 (46m 52s):
No, I, I wouldn't. Bob, you're up first though. Here, man. Let's pay attention to this, these statements. Are

0 (46m 59s):
You hearing that?

5 (47m 1s):
I'm gonna give you three, you know, 'cause I, you're my friend and you're gonna get three of them. Oh, colder than the hinges of hell. Colder than a brass toilet seat in the Yukon. And so cold that the milk cows gave bicycles.

0 (47m 12s):
I'm gonna say that those are all phrases to describe when it's really cold.

6 (47m 19s):
Wow.

5 (47m 20s):
Mark, what do you think?

6 (47m 22s):
Can I not, can I say his? Can I say his?

5 (47m 26s):
You could agree or you could say exactly what he said. If you can repeat it.

6 (47m 30s):
I agree.

5 (47m 32s):
Okay. Yeah, that's right. You guys are God, I,

0 (47m 38s):
Mark agreed. So I get extra points, right?

5 (47m 40s):
Oh man, come on. Is that a a fair thing to do? No. No. It's not fair. No.

6 (47m 47s):
No. 'cause I thought that too. I even knew that my dad milked cows once he said that thing and he's dead. So, you know, I'll never get that again.

5 (47m 58s):
We're so close. So close. Damn it.

6 (48m 1s):
More lip quiver And it would've been there.

5 (48m 3s):
We were so close to something. Who's turns it to go first here? I think it's Mark's turn.

0 (48m 8s):
Yes,

5 (48m 8s):
Mark. What does it mean to have one's shirt out

6 (48m 11s):
To be working so hard? You're sweating. No storm. You need to take off some clothes.

5 (48m 17s):
Okay, Bob, what does it mean to have one's shirt out?

0 (48m 20s):
That is a thing that you would say to someone if they packed their suitcase really poorly and ar articles of clothing or other things were like hanging out of the like comically, like they closed it and stuff was hanging out of the suitcase. Hey, your shirt's out.

5 (48m 38s):
Okay. It means to be angry. Your shirt's out 'cause you're angry, like you're ready to fight. I think.

0 (48m 43s):
I don't know about that one. That sounds stupid.

6 (48m 45s):
Yeah, no, that I don't think it's right.

0 (48m 48s):
I'd rather have Marx than that one.

5 (48m 50s):
It's a 19th century Australian thing. Australian said it, you know,

0 (48m 54s):
R nar.

5 (48m 55s):
Did you say Mark should get the points for that one?

6 (48m 56s):
He did say that and he did. I'd

0 (48m 58s):
Say I'd rather Marx was the truth than that one.

5 (49m 0s):
I mean, I, I was thinking about giving it to him there. 'cause I mean, he said to get hot and sweaty, which is part of like the anger thing, but it's not, it's tangential, but not like

0 (49m 9s):
That's true I guess. But

5 (49m 10s):
You agree Bob? All right.

0 (49m 12s):
Oh, okay.

5 (49m 13s):
You said that's true, I guess.

0 (49m 15s):
Well, that's true I guess.

5 (49m 16s):
Bob, this is weird. I, I guess they don't, there's two, two of them here together. I'm gonna give you off his Kadoova and off his Chump. Those aren't words. Apparently. 19th century Australians used the have one shirt out, but they also used these

0 (49m 33s):
Guys. What are we doing with Words Australia off

5 (49m 36s):
His Kadoova. K-A-D-O-O-V-A and off his Chump.

0 (49m 42s):
Try to imagine Louie's dad saying off his Chump. Nah, I could see that

5 (49m 48s):
Off his Kadoova. I'm Australian.

0 (49m 52s):
Oy Roy. Oy Australian off

5 (49m 55s):
My Kadoova.

0 (49m 56s):
That definitely Kadoova and Chump are both Australian beers and that's when someone's real grumpy. 'cause he wants a drink, but he is trying to cut back on beer drinking like, ah, don't worry about him. He is off his Chump. Okay,

5 (50m 14s):
Mark,

6 (50m 15s):
You just had a lovely experience in the bedroom between the sheets. Wade, do you know about that?

5 (50m 22s):
Oh yeah. Eruption in the streets and an eruption in the sheath.

6 (50m 26s):
When you're done, you hop off as Kadoova.

5 (50m 30s):
That's like an erection. So

6 (50m 35s):
You're hopping off.

0 (50m 37s):
I know actually that that could also, you could also use that at work. Like if your boss is giving you a hard tie, be like, Hey, get off my Kadoova guy's been riding my Chump.

5 (50m 48s):
Bob, I think I gotta give you this one. It wasn't exactly right, but it's someone who's acting a little bonkers and if someone is off of their whatever,

6 (50m 56s):
I got that Gorilla Grip Kadoova, sorry,

0 (51m 4s):
Actually rebranded in Australia's koala grip. But same idea.

5 (51m 9s):
We're stopping there. We've done it. That's it. I've got so many more. We'll come back again one day. But I think that was pretty good. I'm gonna tally up the points. Bob, I'm gonna read your points first.

0 (51m 17s):
That's probably a good sign. You

5 (51m 19s):
Got points for, we're rooting for Lexy 'cause we aren't. Take the egg rain napper. Drunk cold Kadoova and Hot Fox. What? Hotter than a Fox in the whatever. You got points for that one.

0 (51m 34s):
Oh, okay.

6 (51m 35s):
Right, right.

5 (51m 36s):
Mark, you got points for Not that I don't mind. You're double negative there. Thank you. That's capitalism baby. You also got points for drunk hot hold. Erection gives a body the flesh creep. I think I wrote shirt, butt

6 (51m 53s):
Shirt, butt

5 (51m 54s):
Shirt out. That's an O. That's

0 (51m 56s):
A lot of things.

5 (51m 57s):
Yeah, but you got extra points for Lexie 'cause

0 (51m 60s):
Oh, All right,

5 (52m 1s):
Mark, you got a total of eight points. Bob, you also got a total of eight points. This is pre wheel. We're currently sitting at a tie.

0 (52m 12s):
How many wheels are we doing?

5 (52m 14s):
Let me go find out. Lemme roll. A D three one.

0 (52m 18s):
Oh, okay. Ooh,

6 (52m 19s):
Interesting.

5 (52m 20s):
That means we are guaranteed a winner. I guess

6 (52m 22s):
Usually every episode we are guaranteed a winner.

5 (52m 25s):
Well, yeah, but the one man show thing can,

0 (52m 27s):
What does you want to add to the wheel

5 (52m 30s):
Point for wearing the least amount of clothing?

6 (52m 33s):
Interesting. Can you do that right before the wheel goes? Just start stripping as like a last ditch effort of like, I gotta win this.

5 (52m 41s):
Because I feel like right now I'm actually the one who's wearing the least. Yeah, but between you two, I don't know. 'cause Bob's got an undershirt, but you've got a jacket.

0 (52m 49s):
I'm wearing shorts. I'm wearing socks.

6 (52m 52s):
I could take off everything below the waist.

5 (52m 54s):
Do you have socks on Mark?

6 (52m 55s):
No socks. No socks.

5 (52m 57s):
You guys might be, you might be ahead then by the socks. All

0 (52m 59s):
Right, cool. All right. Well there's 14 options. So it's not, I listen.

5 (53m 4s):
Oh, I forgot to read my points. I got points for Slay SLA. 'cause I said I didn't, I deserve points last episode before and I didn't get 'em, so I gave myself a point and I got a point for Ella Goop.

0 (53m 14s):
Sure, sure, sure. Alright, are you ready for our one spin?

6 (53m 18s):
Yeah, I'm ready. Come

0 (53m 20s):
On. Tallest. Ooh. Oh no.

5 (53m 27s):
Most locked in.

6 (53m 29s):
I don't think I was very locked in

12 (53m 31s):
This episode.

5 (53m 32s):
I'm pretty sure

0 (53m 33s):
It's kind of a competition between us to see who was least locked in. 'cause I feel like I was also in and out a little bit.

6 (53m 40s):
I would fight for this if I felt like I was really strongly in it. Like I felt like I was just banging out the answers. But I feel like the editors might have had to cut out quite a lot of me waffling

0 (53m 55s):
To get to

6 (53m 56s):
This point in the episode. So

5 (53m 58s):
I gave five points toward Bob for things that were kind of, I considered locked in. And four to you. We have a couple of your points for funny things. You went with erection for a very long time. Instead of coming up with the different ideas,

6 (54m 9s):
I was pretty locked into the erection. That's true.

5 (54m 11s):
Even though if you'd gone with drunk, it would've been actually correct.

0 (54m 14s):
You got with drunk, this would've been a walk away. Wouldn't even have been close. Yeah, true. Yeah. Hey, let's not overthink it. I'll take the point.

5 (54m 21s):
Bob's got, take the egg napper, hot and cold drunk and Kadoova. You, Bob, you got it by the Kadoova.

0 (54m 27s):
Ooh,

5 (54m 27s):
The Kadoova puts you over the edge. That's

0 (54m 29s):
The way I like it. That's true.

5 (54m 31s):
That ends with Bob at nine and being our winner winner

0 (54m 34s):
Speech. All right. Can I just say, I like the wheels at the end? I get excited. I, I know they're not always gonna be the most interesting thing, but when shit goes crazy with the wheels, shit really goes crazy and I'm here for it. Whoever invented that, and I think it might've been Mark, possibly the best idea in shows history. Just gotta, just can't, can't praise it enough. Excellent work. Everybody. Also, it helped me win today. So

6 (55m 2s):
Until next week when it's like worst that invention ever horrible, destroy it.

0 (55m 7s):
If the wheel is always on my side, I can't get mad at it. Now can I?

5 (55m 11s):
I mean it cost you last week with me. Technically. Bring

0 (55m 13s):
Stuff up. Remember who's hosting next time.

5 (55m 16s):
That's true. But you'll forget it by then.

0 (55m 18s):
I'll

5 (55m 19s):
Mark Loser speech.

12 (55m 24s):
Here we are again, losing with my friends. I don't know when it will ever end, but this is it. The distractable is over after this episode. So sorry. So sorry.

6 (55m 39s):
All right. I don't know. Your

5 (55m 40s):
Rhyming scheme really started off strong and then

6 (55m 43s):
Just like, just like me with most of my content started off strong, terrible finish, but mid middle. And that, you know, has, has people usually tune out by then. So they only see the best stuff at the front. I front load everything. Very few people even got to this end of the episode. So as for all they know, I crushed it and I will crush it in the next episode.

5 (56m 3s):
You heard it here first, all downhill hill from Hello everybody.

6 (56m 6s):
It sure is always was, always will be. But next episode, I've earned myself a right to compete again. Mm. Didn't get banished from the show. So I think I'll count that as a win.

0 (56m 16s):
What a silver lining to find.

5 (56m 18s):
A lot of rhymes in there, man. I, I could give you bonus points that don't count. I will. Wow. Thanks man. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you guys for watching. If you haven't followed the podcast, do that. If you're not watching the podcast and you're not driving, do that. We're flying or boating or you know, hiking, whatever. If you haven't already checked out these guys, mark, mark PLI or Bob Meer. Me Min seven seven or Lord Min seven. Seven merch. Maybe soon. Possibly. Should be. Could be. Would be. It's coming. It's coming. Good too. Until then.
