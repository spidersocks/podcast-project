Hello And. welcome back to another episode of Distractible. I just can't stop winning, which is why I just can't stop being host. 'cause that's how the show works. This week I'm joined by Mark And. Wade like literally every other episode we've ever done. And, they're gonna be competing to see who gets to post the next one. 'cause if they win, they could host the next one. That's how It works. And. Other than that, there aren't really any rules except for our Constitution, which We ignore Anyway. But We don't though We follow It very strictly or not. It's hard to say. Anyway. What's up guys? How You doing? How You been? Great. I'm gonna take initiative this episode. 'cause I learned that can earn You points with Mark And. He not hosting. That was a Mark thing. Yeah. And.


Maybe my initiative will give me points. And his mouth is very open. And it. Hope It stays that way during the duration of my assumedly. Small talk I've got here. You Earn no points, but go ahead. He. Really. Counters spelled me as I was going for It. I. I did. I was not gonna l I was not gonna lose the initiative. Point two episodes in a row. I learned my lesson. Olympics Kru hops just in case. Bump break. Dancing penis. so small talk. I learned last episode. You guys are like Wade. are you talking about hibachi? And Diablo a lot. so I'm bringing something to the table. That is neither one of those things. You know what That is. Hibachi Football is back. Football. Football. We're in the pre And. Go.


My favorite Sports team, which is the Cincinnati Penals. Yeah. And. We've only had one season ending injury. And. Two other minor injuries that are somewhat concerning. And it as of the time I'm saying this, we've only had like one or two pre-season games. so by the time We get through four, We might still have a team Baby. Woo. Can't Wade Football is almost Back. Don't count on It. I'm not. I'm very pessimistic. When. It comes to football. I. Try to be realistic. Maybe being realistic is being pessimistic sometimes. But When It comes to football. I always think things are gonna go horribly wrong. And yet. I'm always excited going into the season like everyone knows. Idiot. This is our year. No Chiefs Threepeat.


It's who? Day Nation Baby Burrow. Giros gonna take us to the top Pro Giro. We're gonna ride That donkey slowly into the canyon of despair. And He is gonna bring us out on the other side. He is And. Mark. Have You seen the Cincinnati quarterback this year? No. Look at him. He looks just like em. And. M. I. We did talk about That on a pre. Okay. We did Talk About That. He still doesn. Yeah. He still looks like that. That burns Out Hair It takes longer than a week to grow. I mean He could get It dyed a different color. I'm bald. That's It a small talk. Right? right. That's a bald point for Wade. I. Guess Water? No, that's Mark's thing. Damnit, you're only bald to me. You're nothing else.


I am going to use my time to not talk about myself, but to talk about a hilarious article. I Talked about football, which isn't myself either, but for the Record, that's fair. so I'm gonna follow in Wade's big, big footprints And. I'm going to read You the title of this article. Innocent Looking Attorney Charged with Smuggling into Prison. And. I'm I'm gonna show You a picture of this Attorney. Well He looks innocent. I will let You And all of our lovely viewers at home. Judge the innocence of this attorney for yourself. I mean. Okay. He's very wet looking. I know there's so much going on in this picture.


There is a lot of wet I do associate the amount of wetness with innocence. The wetter You are generally the More. Innocent You are Who's as Assess. It's this the journalist's assessment that this person looks innocent. I. Think It. I have to be real. The actual title of the article is not That, but the title that someone attributed to It When. They posted It. Was that And? it just so I was like innocent looking attorney. What? doesn. That. And. Then I clicked It And looked at this face joining me. And. I'm not saying like anything other than like, I'm not trying to like disparage the appearance of this particular attorney. It's just like this is the Least innocent looking photo I've ever seen in my life. And That. That just made me laugh really hard. He He definitely looks like He knows You caught him.


There is so much moisture. It's not even like he's not gonna put up a fight. This is the picture of the look right before he's like, yeah. Okay. Here. You. Go And. it had I had a phone up my butt. And it. O. I've done It before. Officer. This is Where everything comically falls out of his suit. Jacket. Yeah. right after He goes like, It wasn't me. Carton of cigarettes. The, the picture is from like chest up. If You like zooms out, And around his waist. You just see like the outline under his clothes of like a cell phone. A file, like a shovel. Just comical prison break stuff. Attorney Tommy Jars weigh a hundred, And two pounds yesterday but came into the prison today weighing 300 And four.


O, O, You Know. You know man Went to Fogo last night. And just couldn't help myself. You know I. Sometimes You gain a couple hundred pounds 'cause You eat a whole sword full of meat. Whatcha are you gonna do? I. Just wanna know I. I don't care about what He smuggled what He was doing illegally. Why is He so wet? That's The thing. I don't think it's all sweat. But what else could It be Like? There's some random spots on the outer part of the jacket. His hair Is wet, but only on the sides of his head. Those those are drips. As a person who sweats profusely in almost every circumstance. I will say That the wetness on the top of his shoulder lapel area. Those are just drips.


You can see he's got like longer sort of hair coming down the side there. That's drips. That happens. But The top of his head looks dry. His forehead looks dry. That's a, that's a lie. That's a lie. The dampness is deep. Yeah. Okay. Because if You, think about the way your head sweats. The top of your hair doesn't get wet. 'cause water doesn't like climb that much. That's I. See? Yeah. I guess that's true. The capillary action of your hair is not enough to like soak all of your hair. But It goes, It starts on your scalp. And, then It goes down. And, it seeps. But his Face in his neck don't look like he's got sweat beads rolling down at All. He probably has a handkerchief wedged in somewhere. Yeah, they're going down. You can see him traced in. Let me see if I can zoom in for You. Let's get some More detail here.


See, You got RLI coming down there. O Okay on the zoom in. Yeah. Now I. Now I. See It? Yeah. On the forehead. No, that's, that's just drips. That's I. Look, I don't know if I've ever looked as innocent as this person looks in my day-to-day goings on. But I've definitely looked as sweaty as they look. I did not see the head sweat. so now It makes More sense. He is very sweaty. I mean, look at his, his chest. His upper chest is soaked through his shirt. O. Yeah, I know that I saw that right away. That's, that's a heavy sweat, man. I've been there. This However, It seems like He was hit with a water cannon because if You notice this dry spot in the center, his tie must have been blocking It. No, it's 'cause that's four layers of fabric. As a person who wore, wore a lot of suits in law school in the south.


When It was a hundred plus to graze out the last part of the front of your shirt to get wet. Especially because if You have your collar done up, that part of the strip of buttons often doesn't even make contact with your skin. Depending on how your shirt fits O, that's doubled over fabric layered over itself. That's just, it's wet underneath a hundred percent. Okay. He's very sweaty. Let's, let's Well. I'll just, I'll accept the fact that he's sweaty. I know about sweating in suits. right? right. Let's ask this. Questions At. He sweaty because of nerves. Is He sweaty 'cause of the heat or because of the amount of things probably shoved uncomfortably into orifices? That He is trying to bring into prison That The face of a man who's losing the battle to keep his butt hole closed.


Three Cartons of cigarettes are in his intestines right now. Yes, Officer I just really Need to get inside. It's fine. My clients, my Many clients need me. Anyway. so I just wanted to share that For all of You to enjoy I, don't know the name of this man. I didn't read the article. are you in trouble? Yeah. I I. Think if He was actually caught smuggling stuff in or into or out of prison. That's not great for like, Right? so You can't break people outta prison. You can't break things into prison. What can You do at prison? It's not great for law license. And. And freedoms. Right? right. I have a picture of all the items that He had on his person. O No.


Is It a lot. I Hope it's like the Joker where it's just like all playing car. Like a whole bunch of just random shit. Hold on, hold on. Let me get this framed up For You guys. He had Pocket lent, but It was inside of his anus. Actually, no. He had all of this, which seems to be about 500 cigarettes. A a whole bunch of weed I. Think there's multiple, multiple bags of mariajuana. What are those rolling papers? What is all that stuff? The things at the bottom are Cigarillos. O. Okay. And then In the center might be rolling paper for making marijuana cigarettes.


Two phones a thingama. Bob And wires. That looks like a scale is what That looks like. O like a mini scale. Maybe He is like for who? Whoever that giant bag of weed is for. so You could weigh It out. When, you're dealing weed in jail. I. Hope all Of that was in the briefcase. But He wasn't carrying That briefcase. That briefcase was what was shoved up his ass. Anyway. That's quite a bit of stuff to hope You get through with no questions asked. I mean, I'm sure He wouldn't admit It, but do You think he's done this before? And He just happened to get caught this time. Or do You think this is a first try? There's No way You haven't done this before.


And, You. Start with that much And. You're like, go big or go home. That's a big first try. I. Agree. I. Agree. You. Don't know to vacuum pack your cigarettes without having done It before. This feels experienced. I mean. That'd be, that'd be my guess. If someone was like You have to try And smuggle something into a prison. My first guess would be like Well. You. Probably You Wanna airtight seal It, right? Because they probably have a dog Or O. Yeah or something. O. Yeah. Okay. I would, I would start with vacuum sealing in a lot of cases. I Wouldn't have. I wouldn't have either For either for liquid, liquid purposes or I would've had raw cigarettes. Not even in a package right up my anus.


Couldn't You have your own pack of cigarettes? You could have That, right? No. You can't bring That. You leave That in like a locker outside. When. You go to Visit. You. You're not allowed to bring nothing. They're real strict about prison stuff, man. I Don't know why. Yeah, It's like this is my butcher knife. I always carry this with me. I'm a lawyer chef. That's my belt file in case I need to get my belt off quickly. And it. Can't get my hands to the buckle. I have a nervous attorney. I smoke a lot. This is just for me. During the interview, I smoke three cartons a day. This isn't even a full day's supply. So that's, that's my, not my small talk at Least. He looked in It. What was the actual name of the article? The actual name of the article was Mississippi Attorney accused of bringing contraband into correctional facility, which is way less fun than innocent looking attorney charged with smuggling into prison.


I love innocent looking attorney. Can We. Can We petition. What state Was this? Mississippi Mississippians. We need to make a petition to change the name of this article. You can take It up with 12 news. WJ T V focused on You. right? Right. Let's petition then to change the name of the article officially to Innocent Looking Man. Why is their news channel bump a morning zoo style bump I? Don't know. It's focused on You. WJ T. V Hey. That's the way the cookie crumbles. It's very edgy news. It's focused on You. That's just what It is. Yeah. I know reporters have like taglines, And stuff, doesn, It. Do any of them have like inappropriately funny ones? Do You think probably like there's a guy on the nightly News's like And of the 56 passengers on board.

That's The last person I wanna piss off Well. Let's see if he's got Well. Lemme check his record And. Then we'll see how much We could make fun of him. Okay. right, right. Let's see.

All covers have at Me. He is got a Wikipedia page. Let me look. No He doesn't. It was redirected from human. Eight O. 5, 3, 3, 1. He. Jack Rafferty is human. Eight O. 5, 3, 3, 1.

It's Just not a good, it's not a good look. It's not a professional You know I don't wanna imply that about I. Saw a clown drown in a pool once. And He just bloated Jack Rafferty sending It. It's That his sign Off. I stole That from Bill Hater, one of his SN L skits. Where He makes fun of Dateline Mm. I mean If You.

Thanks for watching Wheel of Fortune. Make sure you're washing your taints You Filthy Animals. This is Pop that pussy Jack Rafferty out You. Guys wanna see the picture of the attorney again there. He is, can We put him through like That ai filter? That makes people smile. And, let's see what his smile looks like. Ooh, I'll work on that while You, while You start the episode. I'll, I'll get this smiling. Okay. O. Yeah. Episode I. Thought We are recording. I thought We are just chatting. Yeah, no, we're Just messing around. No, that's good. 'cause that's sort of the mood for today. We're just, we're just messing around. We're just playing games.


I'm gonna be really honest. Coca I mean these are games. That. Lots of people play. But I saw another podcast. Do this episode. And it thought It was really funny. And it thought You guys would enjoy It. And. it was the basement yard. I saw clips of It. And. so lots of people have done this. They're not even the first ones. But I should I don't know. I felt like I should credit people. Anyway. We're gonna play Parlor. Games guys. Guys ever played Parlor. Games. Is that where You get your head Shades. And. You play cards while It happens. You'd Be really good at that. But no, it's, they're basically like word riddle games. so there's a, there's some kind of rule. And You. Guys have to figure It out And there. There's a, there's some different ones, so they're gonna work differently.


But basically I'm gonna say some stuff. And. You might need to say some stuff. Or You might need to just make guesses. And. If You know the game ahead of time. And. We. Just play along And. Don't ruin It for the rest of us. Okay, but I'm I have a suspicion. You. Guys might not know And. Can I ask You a Questions Before We get started. When. You said word association games. It made me think of like I Spy with my little eye. I didn't say word. Association games. I'm good at listening. Okay, but did You say whenever You guys would play That game as a kid, would You say like, I spy with my little eye? Or would You do? We had a version. It was Ridley. Didley. I. DD. I. See something. You Don't see And. The color of It is Your head. Must just be a wonderful place to hang out. What the fuck? Yeah. I don't know that At all. What? What version of like I Spy did You guys play I.


We played I. Spy. Where? You say I Spy with my little eye. O. Little I something. That is Okay. You didn't rid Diddly I. DD or something. You Don't see Phil D. so for You to see, what is that? So I. Guess Bob. Back to You. I. Just riddle. D, Look at me. I knew I. See a ding over there. I played with my nieces recently. They did the I spy version. I was like Wade. They don't know the Ridley did the I. DD. What's The game calls? Did You still call It? I? Spy I? Don't remember. Because I feel like if You still calls It I spy, the answer is self-evident. If it's I Spy or Riddle Dd. Did anyone else out there play that version? I'm sure there maybe is someone, but I not, not us.


I. Have an update. Yes, I'm gonna share my screen. Okay. It's just You guys. Remember our friend, the attorney Yes. I got him smiling. O. It's a slow O. That's a nice smile though. That's nice, Right? It's not at all unsettling. And is mostly nice. Yeah, That's pretty good, right, Anyway. That's right. right, right. Bye. Parlor game. Parlor. Games fiddle. D Fiddle my d I. See something You don't see Fiddle. Myy. I got something for You to see. Okay, okay, okay. Okay guys, we're gonna play a game calls green glass door And.


It's a simple game. It's about, there's a door, it's imaginary. so Glass or glass Door Glass Makes More Sense. Green glass door. And. The, the whole point of the game is to figure out what things We can bring through the door. And, I'll start And it. Want You. Guys are gonna have to try And. Figure out what You can bring through the door. Okay, this Is so close to the attorney story. I know, right? This is He played this game. And, He lost. so You better be careful. Okay, so, so I'm gonna go through the door. I am gonna bring feet, but not shoes. Did We tell You you're allowed? Or what do how What Do We do here? No, I'm telling You. I can bring feet, but I cannot bring shoes. When, I go through the door.


And. so now we're basically I want to go around? And, You. You have to try And. Make a statement where You say I can bring thing, but I cannot bring other thing. It has to be correct statement. Okay, So we're guessing right now what We can Yes based on what You brought There is a rule. Yeah. That you're trying to discern. And. it will tell You if you're correct or incorrect or what? And it. Want You to figure out the rule. That's the game. I can bring ants, but not pants Can't bring either of those. Okay. I bring hands, but not glove. That was the obvious One. No, can't bring either of those. The right Obvious is still wrong. Mark. We learned. so that's Why I didn't pick It. 'cause I knew It would be dumb.


I am going to bring sunglasses, but not shades. I'm going to bring a brain, but not a skull. Actually That's, that's backwards. You could bring a skull. And. You definitely cannot bring a brain. It's A Chapstick container thing. It's about Chapstick. He's on the Chapstick thing. This is not a game. I invented. This is a game. I. Keep thinking Mark. Keep thinking He's trying to circumvent the Chapstick thing. He's mad at the subreddit. Maybe I'm going to bring despair, but not hope. You can't bring either of those.


But I appreciate the sentiment. I. Okay. I. See what you're getting at. right, right. Lemme go. I'll go in a different direction. I'm gonna bring weed, but not alcohol. You guys seem like you're really close. so if You figure It out, don't just blurt It out. Okay, Well, We. Wanna give the other person a chance to catch up? O. so close. O. Yeah, I'm sure you're right at, you're right there. Keep trying. I am I'm going to bring, Yep. I'm going to bring, I'm going to bring poop, but not a septic system.


That's correct. That's correct. Yes. Yeah. It is, Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. Yeah. O. Yeah. I'm going to bring road, but not head. No. You can't bring either of those. Sorry. right, right. Great. I am going to bring a broom, but not a dust pan. One that doesn't fit right now in my brain is sunglasses. And Shades. It's a, it's a simple rule. Mark. If You get another correct answer, you're, you're free. And. We could sit here together. And laugh at Wade while He suffers. O. Good, good, good. I'm gonna bring grass, but not a lawnmower.


O. That's correct. Mark I. Think, think You. Have I. Know It. I. Think You have no idea why it's correct. so we're gonna keep going. No I know. I just can't blurt It out. Okay. Yeah. No, don't blur It out. We know Mark knows clearly. He. doesn. It's the confidence of a man who knows. Yes. Of course. Okay, I'm going to bring steel. Yep, but not slippers. Unfortunately that's incorrect because You could bring both of those. Obviously Wade, don't You get It Aren't You. You're getting closer. Wade. I could feel You making progress.


I am going to bring happiness, but not sadness. O actually, I can bring You. Know what I'm wrong? Wade a second. Wade. I didn't think It all the way through. I'm wrong. That's incorrect. I could bring both of those. I could bring happiness, And, sadness. so I'm, I'm just as, I'm just dumb as You got Well. Look, I'm not I got the rules right in front of me. And it still messed up. so You know, Obviously, man, You don't need to act dumb to help him feel better. Here, I'll act dumb. I'll act dumb to make him feel better. Right? right. Mark, give us, give us another correct answer. Mark. I believe You. I believe in You. No, No. I don't want O. Look. O, we're all goofing here. O. I got one. I. Think I'm, I'm gonna bring light, but not the sun.


O. I'm sorry. You can't bring either of those. See? I just being dumb. Wade. Come On. You. Know what? The deal isn't here. Yeah, I'm going to bring Sas, but not spores. That's correct. That's Correct. O. You. Get It now. I. Think I. Don't know. That's excellent. That's very good. I am going to bring teenagers, but not adults. I am going to bring, I'm going to bring a cow, but not milk. I'm sorry. You can't bring either of those Buddy O shit. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Well that. I'll cross that off my list of possibilities.


Now I definitely know What It is. Yep. No, no, you're just, you're just narrowing It. You're honing It in. so You know specifically what the rule is. Yes. Wade. I'm going to bring moose, but not nose. That is correct. You can bring moose. And, And nose is not allowed. I am going to bring, Ah, I am going to bring wheels, but not tires. That's the face of a man who knows what he's about to say. Confident. Correct answer. And. You. Guys have both figured this game out. Let's go buddy. I am To bring I am going to bring Just come on.


You. Got It. You're right There. I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring, but not, I'm gonna bring what? Okay. Wade. How about I'm gonna bring, I'm gonna bring, I'm gonna bring water, but not rain. I'm sorry. You can't bring either of those. That is incorrect. Wade do You wanna give him something to help him out? Yeah. I'm gonna bring spoons, but not forks. That's a good one. Those, that's a good one. You can bring spoons. I'm also gonna throw this out there. We can keep going on this game. If You wanna try And Figure It out. Mark. But every correct answer that Wade gives is earning him. More points. And. If You wanna throw in the towel, And, have me either give You a hint or give You the game.


We can do that, but It will potentially cost You. Is He fake frozen or real? Frozen? He's fake. Frozen. He's, He's thinking You. See if I can give You one. That'll help You out. I am gonna bring pool. But Mo, but not Pond. I'm gonna bring pussy but not pop. That's correct. You. I knew It would be You. Puy Maybe. I don't know the rule. As Well. As I thought. 'cause I, I would've thought You could bring Pop Well. Let's try this again then. Shall We Wade, what do You got? You've just been, you've just been getting correct answers. Even though You didn't understand what's going on here. Who would do That?


Apparently I'm gonna bring tools. I'm not gonna bring poll. That's Correct. You. You can bring tools. You cannot bring poll. That's correct. You. Don't think You know the answer. I mean I. Think I do. Should I just say what I think It is. Mark, do You wanna go again before I? Take a guess. I. Think I know what It is. But now Yeah. I I. Think I know. We'll, we'll put two points in the air. And You. Both say what You think. It is. If you're both correct, Do You want us to message You or say It out loud? Let's just do honor rules. Let's just say It. Sure. Just don't change your answer. Okay. Whatever You think It is right now. And say That And And Wade You. You. Go first. What I originally thought was You had to say something that had two of the same letter or More And. You couldn't say something that didn't have a repeat letter, but pop threw me off.


so I'm guessing It has to be vowels or Ss. Mark. What do You think the rule is? Two letters on the inside of the word That are the same. And. Then the other one, doesn not. That's why shades wouldn't work, but sunglasses would. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Okay. You're both wrong. so I'm gonna do another example. I am going to bring a tree, but not bushes. I really thought one of You guys was gonna have the right answer, but okay. The two letters thing though, that's been a a real common theme. Yeah. I mean what Have, what have I brought? I've brought sunglasses, weed, feet. I'm bringing tree I.


Think I. Know the rule. Now I think the two letters just have to be together. Somewhere in the word. Anywhere in the word is Two letters have to be next to each other. Ss, o's, e's, It. Doesn't matter as long as they're touching. But there's another part of the rule. Because the other, because It, there are some things that You can bring. And can't bring. But then He said, He said You can bring tires but not wheels. And, that one doesn't make sense for rule other way around. You can bring Wheels, but not I brought wheels, but not tires. Wheels. Eee is next to each other. They Said tires but not wheels. That's why I was so confused. Because I, I thought You said tires but not wheels. I think You said wheels first. I said wheels. I think I said wheels, but not tires. I got wheels, but down that I said Wheels. Wheels. And. Tires. Okay. All. right. Okay. You Might be right.


Different tires. I mean sunglasses can't bring shades. I can bring. It's so two thing, but the other one, there has to be another rule for what can't be there. Right? This is being semantic, but that's not correct. Do You want me to just tell You what the rule is? Yes. Yes at this point. Yes please. It Needs to be a double letter Anywhere in the word technically. I guess. I was in unclear what You meant by the letters need to be inside the, the tree has two Es at the end of the word. They're not inside the word. Yeah. Yeah. It just needs, You said Be two letters, double letters right next to each other. Our first. That's What He said. Wrong. What? He. That's what He Said. What He said are both wrong. He said. That's not what He said though. Follow up. Guess was that one. He. He. He said What was the one?


You said Pop threw You off because It had two P's in It. But they're not next to each other. so Originally I guessed wrong. It's not just two of the same letter in the word. It's two letters next to each other. Yeah. I guessed wrong. And Mark guessed wrong. And then When We went back through. We did one. More. I said Okay. They just gonna be two letters touching. Yeah. Wa Wade's. Newest guess Wade's Latest guess is correct. Wade. I was under the assumption of what He was saying was they had to be adjacent. That was a given. That they must be adjacent. That's not A given. That's not what He said. That's what He Said. And. That's what I was thinking. Anyway, When. He became wrong. I was like, ah. There must be specificity of where those two letters should be. Right. so Marcus arguing That. He did know It. And on what? What I'm, what happened, what It happened.


I'm arguing Wade knew It because He said Pop threw him off. so his his guess was that It wasn't that It must not be That. He said to the same letters next to each other. That's what He said. And. You said that was wrong. Pop threw him off because I couldn't bring Pop Yes. And. That's why He qualified his guests to just be the two letters. And. The other one could not be And. Then You said that wasn't It And. so I was like, okay, It must be specificity of where those two letters are. And. it was like Wade, I, You And it. Both understand what You said. And mark is. I'll give him the points. If You want I. Don't know Yes because I was operating the assumption. right? right. Two points for Wade. My my guess was still the same. But because You said He was wrong, I was operating on the assumption that He was guessing the two same letters next to each other.


Because that's what It was. I I did not feel misled there. I just my original. My original thought was like, okay, You just have to have two letters in the words. so like hop would count 'cause You got P, And P Stop would not 'cause there's just no repeating letters. Stops would work originally, I would've thought. However, I learned. No Sassy would work. 'cause You have the Ss or Stoop would work 'cause You have the O. so I eventually got there. But originally I just thought It was any like You have to have any letter twice. But my first was guessing. That's what my thought was, was just You had to have two of the same letter anywhere in the word, not necessarily next to each other. And. That may have been what You said, but I was operating the assumption. That You knew they had to be next to each other. I did not Originally.


Therefore, When. He said You are wrong. Thinking that He understood that You meant two letters next to each other. Because that's what my guess was too. And then You Know what two points for Wade for being correct apparently, but also a point to Mark for sportsmanship because that's just good sportsmanship. I. Think Judge Judy is pretty close. Okay, Wade gets two points. Markets one point for being a good sport. And giving way two points. I still wanna understand, is It two letters together or just two letters in the same word? It's together. It's two letters together. Anywhere in the word It doesn't. It's listen, look, You both basically had It. If I'm honest, I'm not sure even what I said. Let alone if I weight gets two points.


And markets one point. Let's play the next game. This game is can We both Challenge. I don't have any red flags left Technically. When We have the hot tub boat episode. I think that refreshed everything. 'cause the boat. That's the thing. I'll save It. I. Wanna make sure I know what I'm challenging Before I challenged And it still don't even know. I Couldn't even describe accurately what the challenge would be. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Because the next game is gonna really, this is different. Ridley. Didley. I. DD. It's not a real thing. I feel like You looked into It. And. it just doesn't count. Ridley Diddley, look at me pee. Is that what You said? No. Ridley. Didley. I. DD. I. See something You don't see Did D Here I am. Watch me pee.


I have a story. And. You have, but I can't just tell You the story. You have to get It outta me by asking Yes or no questions. And, You can ask me any Questions, You want. But You have to ask me Yes or no questions. And. This is not like the 20 questions where I'll give You a wishy-washy I will tell You Yes or no. Or possibly maybe. But the maybes get no explanation. The maybes. The maybes will just come up. When, they, if they come up, that's a thing. It's A story that You experience. There's a, this is a real story that happened. So odds are you've told It on this podcast before. Got It. I have not, this has never come up on the podcast. And. It's, it's, this is You. This can be investigative. The point is not for You to get the point is not what the story is.


The point is the game. We're trying to figure out the rules of the game. right? We Start And We alternate. Sure. Okay, mark goes first since I. Think O I I screwed him out. Points last time or I'm not sure. Okay, It doesn't matter who goes first. Did He Get, did You have any context to what the story is about? Is that my Questions? That's your Questions. And O shit. And. No. Who Was there? That's not why. That's not It. O. I'm panicking. Hold on. are you alone? Yes? Are you afraid? No. Are you naked? No. Do You wish You are naked? No. Okay. Was It at your house? Yes, Are you in the bathroom?


No. Was It in your garage? Yes. Did your car fall on You? Yes Was It When. You are changing a tire. Yes Did You die. Yes. O. Gosh. right, right. Okay, Wade. Hold on. I was really asking It some probing questions here. This is fascinating. Wade. so You did die. I had to answer that Questions with a Yes. Remember, these are riddles. so there's a rule. The story is irrelevant. The story is O. Wade perhaps O, perhaps nonsense even. But there's rules as to why I'm telling You what I'm telling You. And, there are correct rules. And incorrect rules. O.


Fuck. I wasn't playing that game at all. I was just asking Questions about the story. What did We just thread? The Okay. I thought. It was fairly clear from the first thing. I Was just excited to get some yeses. I lost the plot for the yeses. I Mean yeses are good 'cause It gives You information. But nos also give You information. And You haven't even gotten to May yet. Did You live Yes? I want to like give You? It's so bad, but it's a little early for that. I feel like We can do this. So You weren't in your garage. Yes, Are you dressed? No. Thank. No. are you dressed? No.


You was in the garage. Garage. What the fuck did You ask Mark He said. so You weren't in the garage. I said Yes. I weren't here. I got one. Am I holding up two fingers. No Shit Am I. Three. Yes. Am I beautiful. No. You didn't ask It, right? You didn't ask It right? Am I ugly? Maybe I did I step outta bounds. Am I not cute? Yes interesting Questions phrasing there. I like It. Am I ugly old?


No, that's not a word. But I got I. Think no is the answer still. Did You see taken? No. Did You watch taken? No. Did You see taken to Yes? Ah, I Hope. You just figured out. That'd be such a good Questions to get It on. Am I buffalo? Yeah. Yeah. Wade a minute. Okay, maybe I don't get It. Have, have confidence. I Believe in You. What Do You think of 33? Yes Is He four. No guess we're getting a lot of numbers in here. You wanna hint about the numbers?


No. I, I'm not, I'm not obsessed with the number part. I'm, I'm doing something else. Okay? Okay. Where Are you on the night of January 23rd? No. Are you on Darla Yes? It's not a word association. You're allowed to think about what You ask. But, but Yes I have one theory, And one theory only. right now. I kind of have a theory. I'm, I'm trying to am I big buffalo Yes. Am I buffalo wings. No Am I purple buffalo. Yes. I. Think I. Know what It is. I Dunno if You do. Bob, are you tree Yes? I? Think I got It. I do too.


Can can We guess. Give me a Questions. And. Tell me if You think the answer is Yes. No. Or maybe I. Wanna test if you're accurate before You? Give each other any clues in the, in whatever the theories might be. So the answer to this Questions At going to be Yes. I'm, I'm trying not to ask a Questions that we've asked before. That's Yeah. Yeah. No. I got It. Yeah. Is this scandalous? And You? Think the answer should be Yes to that Yes. Yeah. Incorrect. O I. I was making up rules that the Caesars is making It up. They are made up, but they are already made up. And. They have been the same the whole time. My answer is going to be Yes. Do You wear a bra? That is correct.


Yes. This answer's gonna be no. Are lollipops Scrum didly, MPT anxious? No. Yeah. Okay. right, right, right. This is gonna be maybe is Mark smelly? Maybe that's correct. Here's a is gonna be a maybe. Is Wade stupid? I'm sorry. The answer to That is no. This will be a no. Is Wade smart? No, I'm confident That. Wade has a theory that is at Least. Accidentally correct. I have no idea. 'cause I think you've changed the rules. I don't. Well. I'm not gonna say it's impossible. That. I misspoke. 'cause I literally do that in every single episode. But I don't think I did. 'cause the rules are fairly straightforward. And, it think Wade has them.


But I don't want to cut You off. Mark I feel like you're really building to something. Well Well. I was And. Now I have no theory. Okay. Do You like zebra, I, I don't know what this is gonna be. Yes Do. You like zebras? No. I'm locking in. I'm locking in mine. Yeah. Wade Like message. Message It to me or something. And And. We'll, what It doesn't make any Sense. Would You like me to answer some questions? Mark? Yeah. That's all you've been doing. Am I a kid? No. Am I salty? Maybe. Am I bright? No. But am I edgy?


Maybe. Are you candelabra? Yeah. Yeah. Are you a psychologist? No. Are you psycho? Yes I. I got nothing. I got nothing. I got I, got nothing. Am All Right Bob am All right? Wade is correct. He did figure this one out. What is It? Wade? Do You want to explain It or would You like Me to explain It? Yeah, You can explain. Correct me if I'm wrong, if I'm not fully right. The last letter of the word, the last word has to be A, A vowel for him to say Yes. If it's a consonant, He says no. If it's a why, He says maybe. 'cause Ys are sometimes vows And. Sometimes consonants O. So smelly, Ugly Or maybe name of the game is sometimes why? Because sometimes Y is a vowel.


There are some crazy coincidences on number of syllables. Yeah. That really threw things off for me. I know You got And. Then once that train was gone, As soon as I said ugly or whatever, It was And. He said maybe It was silly And, stupid And. Then I was like, okay, there's something. so I was paying attention. I thought what It was afterwards was if there are three consonants at the beginning of the word, it's maybe two consonants. At the beginning of the word was no And. Then one consonant And vowel would've been Yes. I Didn't think about the beginning, which Is why I said psychology. 'cause I was like PS y. That's gotta be something. No. I could tell both of You guys at different points.


Got really coincidentally the answers You are looking for. Yeah, because some You are, you would ask a Questions And. it was like Yes, And. You are like O And. it was like that shouldn't have given anything away. I was on A number of letters. And the first word of the Questions. For a while I was like, okay, odd number R was Yes And even. No. Or something like that. And. it was like And. so He asked something else. Mark didn't completely ruined my idea. And. it was like, huh, okay. But the I got onto You with the whatever. Whatever the first word is. You gave me a maybe I was like, what the fuck was different about that one than any other one? I was like, the only thing I can think of is like Ns And y. Yeah. The Y was really the thing if You happen to get onto the Y, that was kind of the giveaway eventually. 'cause that one I was stuck on It for quite a while.


It's been a tight competition up to this point. I Mark had a lot of questions during that last game that I really liked. And You earned More points than Wade did during the game. But Wade earned the points for actually solving the puzzle. And I liked. are you on Darla? That was my favorite One. That was a very good one. I liked That a lot, but Mark You earned points for innocent attorney moisture. Jack Rafferty, terrifying smile, gif poop, septic grass, pussy pop sportsmanship am I beautiful. Taken two And purple. Buffalo I was really hoping taken. Two was where You figured It out 'cause That would've been really fucking funny.


Well It was like the syllable count of the last word really did kind of That was where I was like. I got It. That was for the other way. It clicked with me. I was like with the Y And take And taken two is like two Ns. And O. Why the vowels? The vows. Well Wade You earn points for football. Football. Foot bald as briefcase. Mississippi petition sassy spores, moose nose, spoons, forks, tools pole. Turns out He was right. And solved the puzzle. Mark You earned a grand total of 10 points. And Wade You earned a grand total of 12 points. That seems close as I would've thought.


I I gotta give better answers in the middle. Honestly, mark came back a lot just because in the last one, the am I beautiful questions. The taken questions And. Then the purple buffalo really got me. They really tickled me. I thought I had It. Well. Unfortunately that means Wade has to give a winner speech. Wade, what do You have to say for yourself? I. Think it's very fortunate. I have to give a winner speech. I want to stand a little bit of a podium here? I think it's been a while maybe since I hosted. Maybe not that long. I can't remember. But anytime I lose It feels like it's been forever since I've won I. Want to give an apology to Shakira, who I've not mentioned in a little while? And. I've seen some beautiful posts from people about Shakira, And statues, And performances.


And her s And L appearance. And it. Don't know that she's gotten the spotlight from me. She deserves. Queen We are so back And. You're in my thoughts. Always And a good gamer. Whatever You do, I was curious if something happened with Shakira, so I'm glad to hear that. That's okay, I. Hope not unless it's good. And. Luckily for everyone, We, get to hear a wonderful loser speech from Mark I figured out the rules of the podcast, right? I've deduced It. I've never known those. See, The trick is whoever's hosting is trying to pat out the small talk as much as possible. And, it keeps the actual competitive part of the game. Smaller if it's bigger. And me Coming in with all of this glorious small talk was my undoing because I lost the ability to have More actual rounds to play.


so from here on out, I shall Pledge. I shall not ever have small talk again. I don't like the sound of that. I'll double up my small talk. We used every ounce of content. I had prepared for this. I I would. If We had less small talk, I would. I had nothing. Bob You will earn bonus points. Next episode. If You come with lots of small talk to fill in for Mark's missing small talk, thank You. I'll just make stuff up You, just ask me Yes or no questions. And, I'll tell You a whole story. I'm Gonna come in with five minutes of planned game. 55 minutes of small talk space. Perfect. Well, congratulations, Wade, but congratulations even More. so More. so to Mark for figuring out the rules of the podcast. I think that's really gonna bear a lot of fruit going down the line. I think a lot of Mark victories are coming up in the forthcoming episodes.
