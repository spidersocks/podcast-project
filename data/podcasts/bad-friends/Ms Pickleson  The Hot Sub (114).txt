And Let me say this. I think we got it. Are you okay? Yeah. One, Two. And so, but these vomits Though, that's how good Were violent. Yeah. That looked like it hurt. But now every hour at home, I didn't even sleep in my room.


I slept in your old room and I left the door open so I could go right to the bathroom. 'cause your, the bathroom was close to the door. You Just slept in the tub. Yeah. And Every hour that kind of, it was the worst. 24 hours, 48 hours. Did you lose any weight? I'm still fat. And that's, you know what I mean? And that's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. Here's another thing about Ozempic that I wanted to talk about. Yeah. Is, is that I'm not eating at all. And so I, I, I feel so tired because I'm not eating any protein since When, Because last night was a pretty good one.


What do you mean? You, you at my house, you had like seven sausages. No, I didn't, I didn't have seven. I had, dude. Oh, we counted. Stop. Stop. Alright. I had one sausage. Right? A quarter of your pretzel. No. Yeah. You had a half a pretzel. No, I Didn't. No. It wasn't a half. You gave me a corner. It was a half. Yeah. But I didn't finish it. Okay. I didn't finish it. There's No proof for that. Yeah. And then I ate some of your delicious apple turnover. That turnovers are so good wi With your homemade Homemade whipped cream. Whipped cream. Right. So good. Right. So it sounds like ozempic is really kicking into full gear. But I only had a little bit of it. That was all I ate the whole day. You didn't have anything before?


No, that was it the whole day. Okay. You know, that was my meal. And so today when we had the, we went to a Michelin star restaurant. Right. Which was very nice. And that's Where I ate fish. It is the first time protein you had fish. Yeah. Yeah. Ever. And I ate some caviar. What, What was in there too? We had what was in inside of it? It was a, it was like crab. Right. Some crab inside and then some eel. And so that Eel and sticky Rice. I and I, this is, I swear, if you watch naked and afraid, I Yeah. Love it. Okay. You know, it's a survival show and they haven't eaten in four days. And when they actually finally eat protein, they can feel it in their body Working. Sometimes they get really sick. Yeah. 'cause their body's not used to it.


Yeah. But sometimes they're like, I can feel the, it gives them immediate energy. All right. Not that that happened. Let German sausages didn't do it for you. What I'm saying is, but you instantly feel better. Yeah. You know what I mean? You feel, you feel like you're, you're Like, I, yeah. Without today's dinner we had, I would be so tired. Right. Did You eat any breakfast? No. No. Lunch? No. So what are you doing today? Just water. Are you drinking anything? I'm electrolytes. So like Gatorade. Yeah. And I've gotten, I've gotten IVs every day. Don't do that every day. Yeah. I need nausea. You're not supposed to get an IV every day. Just Three days in a row. That's every day. Exactly.


Yeah. That's not Good. I know. That's where they couldn't even find the hole. You're Gonna have track marks on your arm. We're gonna think you're using again. So, yeah. But I needed the, the nausea medication. Oh, because you've, well, don't they with ozempic, don't they usually prescribe you anti Stuff? No, they didn't. They didn't. They didn't. So I, I, I feel bad about the, the cobs. I apologize for that. And then now the big question, will I continue to use it? I don't know yet. How long do you have to take? Don't you? Isn't there, there's gotta be a minimum amount of time they need you to take it before it's because you can't like, just go right off it. It's probably really bad for you.
