You Two are disgusting. Woo. You two Or something. We're Bad Friends. What happened to Gene Hackman? What happened to Gene? What happened to him? What happened to Gene? His Wife died too. What happened to Gene And one dog? Yeah. Let me say something.


The Dog was in the kennel, which I think is a little strange. Don't you let your dogs free roam? I free roam my dog. I free roam dog. Yeah. But Might be free roaming. My question is, How old was he by the way? 95. Time to go. I know You did your time. But his Asian wife, 65. Right? And dog died and two dogs survived. Who are the survivors? Lemme see the Survivor Dogs. Yeah. Survivor Dogs, man. Yeah. Yeah. That, there they Are. There's some of the dogs. Those are German shepherds. German Shepherds. They can live through anything. They lived through the Holocaust. They were very good in the Holocaust. They were good Dude.


And their work is not credited. Right. Am right. It was not credited. Not enough. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, though. Yeah. Yeah. The other one that was bad was Michelle Trachtenberg died the same day, right? In New York. Oh, that It's not here. Yeah, it was in New York. It was the same day because Gene had been dead a day when they found Him, apparently. Oh, they found him a day later. Oh Yeah. It's a Hollywood tribal. Okay. We've talked about it on the show. People die in threes. Who's next? Who's the third? Let's guess I'm gonna throw it. Hold on. On the count of three. Yeah. Hold on. Let me think of the name. Hold on. This fun. Okay. I was gonna say on the count of three, we have to think of a name together. Okay. I, I think this We shouldn't predict. Okay. Yeah. What I mean, you Know, because you know what happens on the show when we predict. Yeah. It doesn't, it happens.


But, so here's the thing. They said. It's not carbon monoxide poisoning. Gotta be. They said it's not, otherwise. It's, and they said it's not foul play. So I have a prediction. Fair play. So maybe someone deserved to kill One. It was fair play. And I understand, I think this, okay. One of the dogs was scared of the Asian wife. Oh. At some point she's like, He's think, he's thinking It's me. I'm gonna go soon. I'm next. It's me or her. No, he's German. They're German Shepherds. I don't, I don't know. She's Looking at me one day she's gonna eat me. And by the way, Gene's getting so old he couldn't control her from doing that. Right. So one day, the dog, I can't do an German accent. Yeah, I will do it for you. Yeah, do it for me.


Saw a gigantic chocolate bar exposed. Oh, I love chocolate. I know. Must, but you know what it does to you. What does it do to me? It kills you. So you, he saw the chocolate bar, right? These see's my th and his other, what does his other two dogs say? Well, they're running, they ran away. They got away. They were in the house. Well, Who where? Look up the movie Crimson Tide. Here's my conspiracy. Love this movie. You think Denzel did it? That was my other theory. I was honestly not gonna say Denzel. Zoom in. I was gonna say George sga. That guy right there. Fourth. Right before Vigo. No, wait a minute. Yeah. Vigo makes the most sense. Vigo Mortenson is German.


Oh my God. Those were his dogs. Oh, Eric Gorn did it. Eric go That my duck I sent to. That's a long play. That's a long play. I don't know if he would go to all the way to New Mexico. Yes, He would. He loves New Mexico. I left. How do you know the Vigo Morrison likes New Mexico? We Vacations there. Okay. You know what? Yeah. And rest. Rest in peace. One of the greatest actors of all time. Gina Hackman. God bless, bro. Do you realize Rest in so many pieces? Like I that made so many good movies. It French connection. Yeah. Well I told you Crimson Tide's one of my favorite movies. Here's Another one that you forgot. So good Young Frankenstein. Oh my God. He Plays the blind guy. That's Right. So funny. Wow. Dude. He Did, he did everything. Oh, actually, you know what? My, look at all The movies we've done.


Obvious. Insane. Here's my favorite voice he ever did though. Yeah. God ants so good in ants. Do It now. He Was the general Do it now. We must fight to survive. We must fight to survive. You know that speech he does. It's so good. Is that him? Yeah. Okay. He Was so good in ants, dude. Okay. King Ant. He was probably made of millions. I don't know about that. Does an, did animation pay that well back Then? I don't Don't think so. You're right. Yeah. Now that they got like superhero, they Get points though, I think. Right, right. Well, I mean, yeah. I guess I got a residual check the other day for, for the sale of Ricky Snicky to DVD.


What was it? Chaching? Big time, dude. Chaching $42 and 36 cents Chaching. Really? That's what it was. $42 and 36 or 37 cents. I'd have to look it up. Yeah. People think that when you do these things Residuals, they're like, it must be raining down The eighties. I, I did movies for virtually free. You lost money on some Lot of money. I lost that money. It's not a lucrative thing. Un unless you're Ryan Reynolds. And, and be careful Ryan Reynolds, Why They're coming for him. The business is all like mad at him and his wife. I didn't get involved in this shit on the internet. 'cause I didn't care to like research. But it's funny how many stories are being told about these guys. There's another story that I just saw on TikTok. It's the li the, the movie that he did that sci-fi movie with Jake Gien Hall.


What was that movie called? Why Can't I See It in My Mind? Horizon? Or is it No, not her. Collateral. Collateral. Horizon. Horizon Life. We were right there. We were right there. So I would've got li So see, the girl that's go back, Rebecca Ferguson. Rebecca Ferguson. Oh yeah. Said something crazy about him. I don't know if it's true. I wasn't there. It looks true. But he was really mean to her. Like a bully on set. Yeah. Yeah. Really. And then one day she came on what, This asshole is so insecure that he's just yelling at me all the time. Yeah. And so one day she came, comes on set and she goes, I'm not doing scenes with you anymore. I'm gonna do it with the tennis ball. No, with the c stand with the tennis ball. Yeah. And then the producer went up to her and she goes, he's number one on the she call seat.


He has to be there. I don't know why, but he probably doesn't wanna be there. Yeah. But I, again, we don't know if it's true, but it's enlightening. Well, it's a bummer. 'cause then all those stories that TJ Miller told about working with him on Deadpool seemed to be much more valid. Like Oh. Oh, right. People, people did not believe him, but they were like, well, you never know. Their relationship could have been toxic. But it seems like Ru Row court, Is it to be nice? Here's the deal. I don't know the deal. Tell me the deal. Do think Zel Washington said about him? Who? Who? Denzel said about Ryan Reynolds. Yeah. They were in a movie together, save house. Oh yeah. And in an interview they asked Denzel, they said basically, well, when Ryan Reynolds was there, he was just observing you and he forgot to act because he admired you so much.


And Denzel said like, oh, is that what it was? I thought he was just terrible. That's what Denzel said. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Body of the show is like, Wow. That's amazing. Yep. Denzel. And when Denzel's the a truth teller, he really is. He really, when he says like code, I dunno if it's ai, but with his voice. Well, it could be. Right? He Can say anything. It'll be like a spiritual zoom Into that photo. You just pad up. Look at That. That's, that's two lover boys. Look at that. Zoom into that photo. Denzel doesn't look stoked There. He doesn't Yeah. He Zel doesn't, Denzel does not look stoked. He doesn't look stoked. Yeah. That Is kind of crazy to think about. Well, here's the deal here. I'll answer your question. Yeah. How is it hard to be nice on set? Here's Yes. No, no, no. Here's why though. He's hot. He's been hot his whole life.

I'll Tell, I'll tell you the real trick. If you want, if you want the honest truth. If you want the honest truth. Yeah. The reason I got The reason, that's all we wanted. I'm, I'm good.


The reason that I got, well, first of all, I'll give context to what he's saying. We were in a meeting in Sony with one of my best friends in Los Angeles who got us the job. You're welcome. Freebie. What's the job? What's the job? We're doing an animated show. Yeah. We're doing a movie. A movie. A movie. Animated movie. Sorry. But, but I will be honest, the reason that I did get comfortable not caring about famous people is when my first job in LA was on punk. And I was so in my head all the time. All these celebrities would come to the studio. And at some point, I, I just stopped giving a fuck about Try with like, you know, oh my God, you're so good to meet. You did all that stuff. 'cause I was so worried about the bits. I didn't give a shit about the celebrity and they didn't give a shit about me. Right. So it was kind of this great equalizer of when I was young, I met all these famous people and they didn't fucking give a fuck.


I was a player on the show. I was a nobody. And so I just kind of thought, I'm not gonna fucking kiss ass to these people. I, it didn't mean anything to me. So I never wanted to earn their friendship. 'cause I didn't care. And honestly, I met 'em all when I was 25 years old. That's when I met every famous person from punked. All these people. I met Andrew May. Yeah. I didn't give a shit. They didn't like me anyway. It was like I was a young, broke gay Player. I'm gonna give you some insight. Yeah. He's gonna be very mad about it.

You wanna, if you're in a Japanese and intern camp there, it's Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. If you're on a Japanese and Turman camp, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd be the Japanese going. I have To Do you know how they made sure they were just Japanese in there? P they looked at the penises. No. Okay. That's what I did. But I Was asking a friend of mine who's like parents were no grandparents, were in the camps. And George Akai, who Was it? Japanese dude. Okay. And, and I was just like, how did they like, 'cause I feel back in the day it was a little more loose.


Right? Oh yeah. Yeah. They Kind round them up in there. Right. Oh, you think there's a guy there going I Chinese. Well, wouldn't you How I Chinese? Wouldn't you instead Not the first thing look like a kid. Right. Maybe, By the way, that's a great movie. An escape story of a guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got out. Who tends to be other Asian I, Chinese I Chi, It's called I Chinese eye Chinese. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. It's just a Korean guy being super racist to other Asian. No, he's an American. He's an American born. He doesn't even have an accent. Right. But he survives, you know what I mean? The Pearl Harbor, you know what I mean? Eye eye, Chinese eye tiny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then when he's older, maybe the LA riots eye eye, the old man eye Chinese Gets out of all this.


It's a Whole, it's an epic. Tell us what your guy said. So I Asked him, I was like, how did they figure it out? They must have just lumped them all in there and like, whatever. Probably The last names Andrew. No. Well, how would that matter? And They would, yeah. What, what are you talking about? They also pro probably wouldn't ask their fucking name. No. They're just looking at you and you look fucking Japanese and they throw you in. What's your name? I'm Frank Wong. Sounds good. Get in there. No, no. Get in there. That's what I'm Do that.

Oh, oh, oh, you're with the other Japanese guys. Go get in line. But You listen with your ear, right? Hmm. I Chinese Prove it. Zip.


This guy's Chinese. That's how it would go. I would show my dad. So he goes, oh yeah. They just spoke to him in other Asian languages and if they couldn't speak back, they knew that they were Japanese. Oh, wow. And I'm like, whoa, that is way easier. That's way easier. Like the easiest thing. Yeah. Oh wait, because the Japanese knew English? No, they would speak to the Japanese guy in Korean and if he couldn't speak back, they'd be like, oh, that's a fucking away. Oh wow. That's a good clever way of doing it. Yeah. It isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. We were just rounding You up. Yeah. Yeah. But what if it's like a Ja in Santino or listen or given the job to round up all the Japanese people. Like this is gonna be fucking easy. Easy. Yeah. But my argument against that is there was some, because Japanese had been part of America for so long, A lot of them didn't even speak Japanese.


Yeah. That's all. Yeah. Some of 'em were second generation Asians. Dude. My friends parents didn't speak Japanese. And then after that it stopped. Like they stopped entirely. Yeah.

Well, you still got married, you just No, no. You would go, go to a village or a, a dwelling.


Yeah. Polygamy was common throughout history. Cousin marriages remain common throughout the world. Particularly in the Middle East. Yeah. Still to this day, you can marry your cousin out there. Yeah. Look At Ash. I love him. He's so talented. I'm so sorry. That's good. I'm so sorry. That's so fucking funny. Our goal is to make Ash's wife the biggest TikTok. She's So hot. TikTok. Yeah.

Akash, Let's follow everybody In Akash. We love you. My dog. We Love you. My love you Akash my Dog. You know, we love you so much. What I'm Hate I'm saying is, is that, is it human nature to be with one person for the rest of your life? Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's well marriage for sure. Being with someone, having A partner for the rest. I don't know if it's genetically, I think That, I think that we assume that it's supposed to be perfect for your whole life. It's not a natural state. Okay. But it's a, it's a social construct that I think has clinging to many people.


I I can do it and Benefited us. Like Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It wouldn't still be here if it didn't help us as a society or we weed Shit or help some people. Right. Like this in the same way that like, I'll tell you why happened. Yeah. Well, I know little bit. I know a little bit About we, and we don't have kids. I'm know I a little bit about History the same way, in the same way that like, I think it would make me very happy to have kids. If we don't have 'em, it's okay. So to me it's kind of like that same thing if some people don't get married, I know that they're like, I'm okay with it. Yeah. It's, I think it just services people who have services. But you're glad that you have a partner. Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm glad I have somebody that like is along for the ride up and down. Yeah. Because it's, it's all the above. I think the people that, the mistake that was given to people s socially is like, marriage is this perfect, wonderful thing And you're gonna be happy every single day.


You're like, it's a joke. That shit has worked. You're Gonna have crazy downs. You have crazy ups. You can Have Are you always attracted to them though? Yes. I find her attractive. Yes. Yeah.

You're in love with This person. I watched a documentary called Civilization. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So we're nomads for many, many years. Yeah. Okay. As soon as we had grow crops. Yes. Wheat. Wheat. Yes. And it's, we made settlements. Yeah. And that's when the marriage thing came. That's right. Right. When we can afford 'em. I don't know if it, as Soon as we built up enough equity, then we were like, okay, I have stuff if you need it. But I think It was harder to do as a nomad to keep a relationship.


Well, Yeah. Yeah. You, I mean, in the nomad you See you whenever, But we still need to make the kids and we still need to protect them. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Gotta protect them. Okay. I mean, that's probably why it was built. Yeah. For community and protection and Yeah. Also to pass down like assets and shit. That's what all the marriage was, I think in like the royal family. Yeah. A hundred percent. Like how do we keep all this land within? Okay. You know this. I believe it. I believe it's supposed to be true then. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You believe in it. Yeah. Yeah. I, I sometimes I think about maybe is, maybe it isn't. But If you never meet someone and never have a family, who, who would you bequeath all of your assets to? Like any money you've earned or a house that you Oh, if I had no woman. If You had no one and you were on your way up. If My mom's still alive or is she dead?


She's, everybody's Dead. She's everyone's dead. My brother not dead. Steve's Younger. He's dead now. I just couldn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. What, what if Steve's still alive? Probably most to him.

Well run pieces of it, I guess in Phoenix when we were in Phoenix together. I saw, Oh, that was my first weekend. I know, I saw that. Yeah. It's kind of cool watching you peel it and now I know it's dramatically different than what I first saw.


Sure, sure. But incredible as usual. Can I ask you some questions because I'm doing one now. Yeah, please. Where where are you doing it? This is like a big Hulu. Hulu. Yeah. Shout out Hulu. We both did Hulu. I know You did Hulu. We left Congrat on That. But like, so I've never done one. Yeah. There's a lot of expectations on it. I And, and that's what I'm worried about. Yeah, Of course. You've like, because I have never done one. You've built it up so much. I feel like if they want to see the best. Yeah. And I can only just do what I can do. I think you just gotta do what you do. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I, again, what he just talked about, you cannot care what they're thinking about. There Are gonna be people that hate it and there're gonna be people that love it. Yeah. I would, I would argue a very, very small percentage of people are not gonna like it. Yeah. A remarkably small.


But Those people, there will be people that don't even watch it, that hate it. Just Decided they're gonna hate it. Yeah. Wouldn't Be able to watch that Bobby Lee special. Fuck that. Yeah, they're that. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. That's gonna be a natural thing. But like at the same time, just do what you wanna do. This is what I'm gonna do. Yeah.

Well, You gotta, you gotta promote it for a little bit after it comes out. Not Everybody. Yes it. No. Why can't I just do it before?


Because you know, with streaming, I think it matters after it comes out. Yeah, That's right. Okay. Then I'll do for a couple weeks, a month of promoting and then I'll go to Costa. Also, I think that we all gotta root for Hulu. Yeah. I think we gotta root for Hulu and Root for Amazon. 'cause like the more places that are doing standup, the better it is for standups. Good for all of us. You know what I mean? Like, 'cause now there's competition. If it's just one place, they could just go, here's this amount of money and you gotta take it. That's What I felt from the other company. Interesting. You know what I mean? And they didn't Hit that number that you wanted. No, they never offered. Yeah. That's not true. That Is 100% true. I Imagine once you got an offer from Hulu, there was interest from, There was, I didn't get, I didn't literally hear that, but you know, I didn't know. When are you taping?
