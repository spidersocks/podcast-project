It's like pretending you don't care. Kind of insulting girls. It's nagging them. So one of the things in it is, you know what I mean? If you see a group of girls at a bar and the one you like Right.


Don't pay attention to her. Right. Right. Be nice to the other three. Right. And then kind of rip her apart a little bit. Yeah. You mean that hairstyle's eighties, huh? And then go back to the girls.

It was called Montague. Right. And I go, you talking About Squid Game? No. Stop. Stop. Alright. So I go, okay. And they go, there's a rule. And I go, I go, oh, I have to go in.

And then I had drive around. I had nothing then. Right. I was, so, anyway, are you happy I said that story? I don't wanna fucking say anyway, VIX. Hi. Hi. So let me ask you something. Vix Vic, is that vapor Rub? Jesus Christ. That's what I heard. I know. Or I've never played D and d. Okay. All right. So him and I come over, right? Yep. You know what I mean? You know. Hey, I'm Eugene. That, that's, we just changed our names. Why? I don't know why. Okay.


Eugene. Yeah. What's your name? Tell me my name. Robert. Okay. Okay. I'm Robert. That's Eugene. Hi Eugene. We're here to play D and D and we, we've never played d and d. So what do we, how do we start? All right. Start by making a character. Alright. So you'll be given a piece of paper. Yeah. Has some lines and boxes, some bubbles. Well, I already know it. Leonard Mung pie. All right. Start by. And I'm, and I'm Chooch. Start By rolling. Yeah. He's Chooch. I'm Leonard Mung Pie. All right. You start by rolling your stats. You get, Okay, I rolled. It's a zero. What does that happens? Okay, pick it up between three and 18. That's the more I Oh, Three. Okay. I got a three.


All right. You got three. So the best way I can do this Is, do you have any snacks? Yeah, I'm starving. Yeah, we came all the way here. We biked all the way from our house. Yeah. Do you have snacks? I didn't bring anything. Sorry. You're the GM and you didn't bring snacks. So my Group, like, what the fuck are we doing here? My group Plays online. Yeah. But we're here. We heard You at your house. The best wet, wet bagels in town. Yeah. Yeah. Make us a water bagel, please. Yeah. We want a wet water with the butter. We Fuck. Do you think we came over here? Yeah. God. They're like a pretzel, right? Yeah. A pretzel. Yeah. Alright. Water bagels. So you don't, have you already ate 'em? Yeah, I did. Okay. And, okay. Anyway, so what's up? You Ate an entire sleeve of bagel without. Yeah, there's six in there.


Hey. Hey. Calm down, Chooch. I got hungry. Eugene. Fuck off. Okay. Oh, Robert, I mean, Yeah. Yeah. Oh no, you character. Anyway, it Doesn't Matter. It doesn't matter. So three is for the lowest you can roll. So I guess you start by what stat you don't wanna be good at. Oh, We, we, we, can we figure out what the stats are? All right. Let me guess. Physical Strength. Mental strength. Mental Strength. Yeah. Austerity. Constitution. Intelligence. Wisdom. Courage. Constitution was a torian. You have to rewrite the whole thing. Constitution is, They better not touch my fucking constitution. I'll tell you that. I don't care if the dragons or the dungeons are involved. Another Saying is physical force.


Look, those there they are. Right? Strength. Oh, sorry. Dexterity. No magic. That's, that's what, that's what charisma Is it kind of use wisdom or charisma? Yeah. Can determine magic. Okay. Based on your Class. Okay. Good. Oh, we class. I'm Korean Leonard Monk. Kai is Korean. Can I not pick that Profession? More or less? Okay. Well, gimme the professions Fighter, rogue monk. Barbarian. Artificer. Wizard. Sorcerer. Druid. You're A druid for Sure. I'm about druid for sure. Very Druid. You want a high wisdom stat? Okay. So I'm rolling with my wisdom first. All right. I got a three. All right. I keep rolling. Three. I have no idea. I don't know. It's, it's, it's weighted or something.


These things. Alright, so ju law wisdom means you're not gonna be able to cast a lot of spells. Okay. But You But I'll think about 'em. Just think about it. Probably. I'll think about the spells. Yeah. Yeah. Probably work on having a high constitution. 'cause high constitution. 'cause high hip points. Okay. What is constitution? You have to go to the gym. It is your physical. It's physical and mental fortitude. It's how well you can resist poison. How much HP you have All health points. Yeah. How, how good you are at concentrating on your spells. Okay. Wow. Wow, wow. Alright. So I got, I'm gonna throw that for that constitution. I want Go home. I know dude.


Dude, I know a great, I wanna leave. I know. Great bagel. She Doesn't have any fucking bagels. I Wanna go. I know a great on the way home when we're riding our bikes. All right. I know it's 45 miles. All right. Yeah. So, okay, so my constitution's at a 60. Our constitution's 1660. Not acceptable. Why can't I get a 60? Seems like So. Oh, your attitude as game master. I swear to God did. So Those feel like a six. I am not explaining this in the proper order. Okay. When you're rolling for stats, you roll four, six added dice, and you keep the highest three. So your numbers will always be between three and 18. So you wanna develop games. Is that what you're gonna school for?


Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have a game you've developed? I am work. I've made a couple of video games. That's what the program's usually focused on. And then I have another game. I am a tabletop game.
