But then he's like, couldn't finish it. Then he had to do something else.


Right. And maybe there was a hurricane he had to deal with. Right. Yeah. So he goes, Hey mom, Joe. Right. Some guy that works there, he goes, put in the brain. And Mom Joe, mom Joe went to the right, wrong department. Yeah. You know what I mean? He went to the, like, the fat in celly, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. With the weird guy department. Yeah. And he went, maybe this one. Right. And he put it in the brain, sent you down, and then God was mad, like, what the fuck. Yeah. Mom, Joe. Yeah. Yeah. You know, because then He came, once he put you down the shoot, he can't take you back. He Can't take you back. That's it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So now I'm stuck. You're saying with kind of a dumb incel brain, but Yeah. But still bright. Right? It's in it's crazy. It's crazy. Well, because you know, people that don't have the good look, you know, I, you know, a lot of comics that don't have the look. Yeah. Right. They, a lot of 'em don't make it.


Right. But they still have the brain. Right. But then they, you know. Right. What, why are you saying, right? I'm just listening. Yeah. But I don't even know what I'm saying. Why would, why would you say, right. 'cause because I, I'm connected to you, dude. We're so connected. We are dude, Joman. Joman. Go back to Joman. Okay. Let me. Take another guess of what it is you're saying. It's not a food. Yeah. I already, yeah. Did you tell me what it was already? I think, yeah, I did. But What did you say? No, you have to, what the fuck? Okay. Do you not listen? Okay, so it's, did I say it already? No. Oh, I didn't. Oh, okay. It's not cabbage bread. I Didn't, what, what was it? It was the people before. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I did say it. Yeah. I did say it. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah, I did say it. Oh, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So they were the original people, but they didn't look Asian.


Well, There's a also a, a group of people called Yayo, which what's No, really Yays, right. That I think they mixed together and then came out with, I don't know, Yays. They, they started. Oh, there We go. There we go. So the Jo Mans are to the left. Does that look Asian? Yes, of course. That looks to the left Asian. Yeah. That looks More like, I don't know, like Kazakhstan. Really? To the, to Oh, to the left. Yeah, that guy. Okay. The guy closest, closest to Carlos is Joman. No, The, the one, no, the one close, right. Yeah. Carlos is, that's Yayo. Yeah. Yayoi. Yayoi is Gki. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yayoi. So Yayoi, so they're saying that the Koreans actually came from the first one to the left. A Combination of the two. That's crazy. Yeah.


That, that I don't see how that, how that one Yeah. Works. 'cause the one on the left just looks like Hassan Minaj. I know That. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I thought I, yeah, I thought that he had a, a Netflix one man show that guy. But then the Asian one. The Asian one. I could tell that that looks like a very handsome young Korean boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He looks, he looks good. But I'm just wondering, you know, that's probably over years of crossbreeding too, Probably. Yeah, of course. I mean, we all have, we all have a little bit of everyone in us. That's why culture to me is so silly. When people try to defend their culture. It's like, whatever your culture is today, it's because it was into your ancestors hundreds and hundreds of years ago by the enemy. So stop saying, we're all just one culture. You and I are, are more, we are more, we're joma. It's, you know.


Yeah. I'm getting kind of into history myself. And I realize that, you know, civilizations, the only way they can evolve is through war. That's it. You know what I mean? And conquer. That's, it's it. Then you absorb other cultures into your, and it actually improves, you know what I mean? A civilization there. They're Right. That's a Joe Mon. That's a Joe Mon. Yeah. Okay. That that right there. Yeah. Now that kind of looks, That does that actually, to be honest with you. Like Steve Burn, Like Steve Burn. I was just gonna say that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's like, kind of, that's a Semias Asian. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you could see him wear a suit and do political Jokes, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like that, that guy, I could see that Whatever he is doing, Steve, that guy I could see, I could see him on, I dunno what the Fuck Steve is doing lately, but that's what he's doing lately. That's what he's, yeah. I could see doing a Suit, wearing, doing fucking politics, politics Stuff. Yeah. Yeah.


I could see him on TBS. That guy looks like he's with this guy right here. Yeah. That's a TBS face. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He looks, but that's Mont, he looks little too. He looks like a tiny little Asian. He looks like, you know, like the Russian dolls, like how they have they getting smaller? Like, you look like you'd be the top player. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Lemme say I have some at home. Yeah. It's a bigger one. And you open it up and It's a more little How many, how many openings am I? No, no, I'm saying we'll start with you. And then that little guy. Oh, I'm the big one. That's the, yeah. Right. Oh, so he, you open, open somebody me, four openings and then exactly that. Wow. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. That's what I think. Yeah. He's, he's the little one. He's he's the one you get to. Right. And the deepest layer. Yeah. That's really what, that's who you look like on the inside. That's who's always mad by.


But, But also notice That's who makes the mistakes. But notice there is, based on that photo, what have we taken from that Koreans that are still like that based on Yeah. That Koreans Right. Still have, still have, Based on that photo, The, the, the, the same exact facial hair as you. No Big Head. We were Big Head people. Big Head little body. Yes. Yes. I find that to be very interesting. And you know what? There's no shame in that because Tom Cruise has a Big. Head. He does. Yeah. A lot of the male, like Steve McQueen, all of the male leading, you know, movie stars. Yeah. Had big heads and little bodies. And what's great about Koreans is the a a they're a stainless agent, thinkless agent you Talked about many times on this program.


They Don't smell at all. You don't smell it all that you don't have a gene that could even make you smell. So that's, that's, And yet I still wear the cologne. But why? Because, you know, I, I like mysterious smells. Right. You know, and I like when people walk by me and go, Ooh, yeah, where were you? And that's not even a cologne. They say that, were you like a war? Or like, no, like, were you, I mean, did you, were you mining? Or something like that. Right. You know what I mean? What About cigarettes? When you smoke cigarettes, do you squat down as low as you can? Or do you smoke standing up

He doesn't even know what the fuck you're talking about. He has no idea. That's why he's out, he's out of culture. Like, there's nothing. Right. Have you seen a movie? A nibble? See a movie? He, he doesn't know what any Wizard of Oz. He doesn't know what it is. Yeah. You know what I mean? If I explain it to you, ah, I don't, like, there's a wizard, a lie. I don't like lion. I don't like a Tintin a tin man. I don't care. You know what I mean? He doesn't know. So what Would he watch then? What did he like? Nothing. That's the thing. Fucking nothing. In fact, when he, two weeks before he died. Right. This is a sad story. How do you, I, I've said this story before, but, But I never, but it's a different experience with me. You never go down the same river twice. What? So I'm saying, even if you say story again, it's a different day.


Different audience different. You never go, you never step in the same river twice. But People do. No, but then, but it's flowing water. So you never, so it's technically a different, If there's a river by your house, you've probably been in there twice. No, no. You step in, you know where I learned that from? Ancient joman proverb. Oh, really? Jo. Oh, yeah. Well, then they were dumb. Yeah. Because it makes no sense. But anyway, maybe not too, I wanna make, I see. Sometimes I exaggerate. So I wanna be, be honest. I wanna be completely honest, Be honest, be accurate. A year before my dad died. Okay. I would have to say my brother and I were in his house in Phoenix, Chandler, Arizona. And he was resorted. He's in a wheelchair now. He can't walk. Okay. Because he got hit by a truck.


Right. Or something. Didn't it? Isn't that didn't something. No, no. That's it. Stroke. Or didn't your grandmother get run over by a tank? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, my aunt did. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what you remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I think about it like in the shower. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. My, my aunt got run over by a tank. By a tank. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's what a weird thing to memorize. Wow. That's what I'll tell people. Fun facts about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the most traumatic in my family's history, you know? Yeah. But a year before my dad died, we, my brother and I were at home and we were talking about music. And he goes, I don't like music. Right. I go, we're asking him questions about music. He doesn't know anything about it.


Right. I go, have you ever heard a song? And he goes, well, sometime I go out, you know, I see, I hear the, I hear the, you know, in the, you know, outside. You know what I mean? In the more, when I'm in more, you know what I mean? Because one of his stores is in a mall, but he doesn't know what it is. Like he doesn't listen to it. Right. He, to him, it's just like birds chirping. Right. You know what I mean? Or like, planes crashing, you know what I mean? Just, there's no difference. So what would he do for entertainment? So I, my brother-in-Law goes, we want you to listen to this. I put my little, you know what I mean? AirPods in his ear. We played him. It's the most, like, universally, you know? And it was Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton.


Right. And he's listening to it. And then tears starts coming down his face. And he goes, that's beautiful. It was unbelievable. There it is. 80 years. Never heard a song before. Right. It's like, we're like running into a primal, a tribe in some island. Right. Yeah. You know what I mean? He has access to everything, but he doesn't, you know what I mean? He's, that's basically who he is. Did You tell him what it was about? I said, yeah, Eric Clapton get cocaine and kill this kid. That's not what happened. No. No. Do You know actually what happened? I know what happened. Tell him what happened. So there was some sort of party or something at his house. This Is already wrong.


Yeah. There were pe people there, though. This is wrong. Go ahead. I Literally Google it the other day. Okay. Right. I'm gonna tell, okay, Go on. And then he fell off a window. Out of a window. Okay. So the window part's right there. Yeah. So, no, what happened was, Let Me, I I, wait, wait. First of No, but Let me tell you the story first so you could fact check it. Okay. So what happened was, is he, he had left his baby, you know, the, the, with their nanny and the, they let the kid, like used to run up, up and down the hallway, like in his apartment building in New York. And they lived on whatever, the 14th or 15th floor. And the maintenance worker had left the window at the end of the hallway open, which was like a floor to ceiling window. 'cause they were like cleaning it. And the kid thought he was running, he had always ran to that window and touch it and ran back.


And he just ran through the window. Oh, wow. That's insane. Yeah. That's, that's what it says online. Yes. Yeah. I was wrong. Yeah. That's what, what I, I don't think I would, I don't think I'd ever come back from that. No. He came, Would you? No, I think, and then, but I think he did come back. I think he then just, No. Yeah. He wrote Tears of Heaven. I'm just saying me. I think, I think he, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He wanted, he did proactive things. I'm just saying, if it happened to me, I think that it would What best Special you would win Best special. Oh, I, I would come with a great special. I don't know, man. I, I, I think you would, it would take me years to even get back to any form of normalcy. But what, what would it take, like if I killed one of your cats?


Like, right. Like how would, what would be similar to that to you? Like, who would I have to kill for you to feel that to kind of motivate you to, to write the special of your life. Who would have to die right in front of you? Wow. What a question. Thank you. It would have to be a four man death. A four man. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. For me to motivate me to make the best special in the world. Like What? The producers in here and Andrew, everybody would've the whole best. No, no, no, no. It would have to be my brother. Okay. My mother. Okay. Andrew. Okay. And Kilah, All four of them Yeah. Had died simultaneous at the same time for me to go to feel completely lost. Right. Of like, oh, I'm gonna kill myself.


Or I would definitely not stay sober. No. It would too traumatic for me. Right. And I would probably disappear for a very long time. I, I had to go through a be so I already thought about it. So I would liquefy, I would liquefy. I would sell my house. Because you secretly hopes it happens. No, I don't secretly hope that happens. I do the same thing. I hope I don't secretly hope it happens. I hope everyone, I just have a, I I just have like an out. I know, but you Right. It's a fantasy. So I would sell my mom's house. Okay. Right. Maybe not sell mine. I would like, try to lick, like I have some other real estate I would probably sell. Okay. I would get as much cash as I can. Right. And I would probably get, I've never tried fentanyl.


Okay. So I would just get like high grade fentanyl. Right. I would get all the liquor in the world. We, it's just the whole thing. Shrooms acid, everything. Right. Right. And I would probably go into like a place like Butte, Montana. 'cause I was just there. And so when I was walking around Butte, Montana, I was going, oh, that's where I die. Mm. Right. In my mind. You know what I mean? Right. Like, I found spots, like there's mine, like abandoned mines. Oh, yeah. So I was just be in an abandoned mind. Yeah. You know what I mean? With my overalls. Yeah. No shirt underneath it. No. Right. And, And I know already that your nipples, you have strands of hair that come outta your nipples. Exactly, Dude. Yes. And I would not shave them. No. They would be like out Right. Just swirling around. Yes. In, in the wind. Yeah.


Right. I would have a bandana Yeah. On my head. Right. Right. I'd put one of those football kind of black. You know what I mean? Yeah. The, well, you know how Batman did, like, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. Dark Knight. Yeah. Because he has to put the mask on. So he wants this area to be Right. Shadowed. He wants this area to be dark. Right. Right. So I had no mask on. I just have that with the bandana. Yes. Right. I would look really wicked Awesome. Right. And I would just party till I gave out. I think. So you wouldn't, so you're saying you wouldn't write a special, But then if I survive that, no, but then, but no, I'm just telling you what I would go through. Right. Okay. And then it would be like, I think I wonder who would try to find me a raccoon?


Yeah. I think Andre. Wait, wait, wait. No, honestly. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Wait, wait. What I'm saying is when I, I just said, who in my life would try to find me? And you're fucking saying a raccoon would. Yeah. I think Andres would, I think Andres should be the one who would try to find you. Because he would see if you were still alive. So you could do the ad reads. Oh, right, right. Yeah. He would say that they knew, well, this Would be over if Van died. Right. This would be over a TigerBelly would be over. No, I don't know if it'd necessarily be over. I could, I could slide in for half the price. Yeah. Yeah. We would just give, yeah. I could kind of do it. I don't Think, I don't think I Would be able to do, I'd relocate no issue. I don't think I would be able to do it. I think we, we'd, we you'd pick up the pieces. But anyway, so if you are three children, your wife all died.


Right. My gosh. Is that too much? Whatever. We're in it. We're in it. We're in it. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? And you're like, you know what I mean? They, they, them uncle Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Came In. Which is all, this is all, no, He's out. He's dead too. Okay. He's, yeah. But He dies from other things. Right. I'll tell you that right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I'm talking about? A hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. Philadelphia style, but anyway. Yep. Oh, yeah, Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lesions. You know what I'm saying? A hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. And so what would you do? So, I'm, I'm the, I'm the cop. You're on the road. Okay. Hello, Mr. DiStefano. Hi. Hi. How are you, officer?

But you would say that even if that was the case. Yeah, I think I would. 'cause I get, I I, I have a nice rapport with the police.


Yeah. But I'd Be like, why are you being racist? Well, I would just, I think I, it would just be my attempt. 'cause I'd be very nervous. It'd be my attempt to, well, Then my explanation would be during the Civil War, you know, then some Chinese moved here, right. To the Ozarks. Right. 99.9% of the people moved out. But my family were the ones that stayed. We owned a Chinese restaurant. Right. I mean, over year, you know, hundreds of years. Right.

No, he died outside of the house from something else. Right. It's okay. He was bu there was bubbling. So what I would do, a Bobbylee, a bubbling bubbles on his skin. You know what I mean? It looked sexual, you know what I mean? Yeah. It was, it's just a sexual virus we'd never even seen before. But he was just like, help me. Right. And we just shot him between the forehead. Yeah.

Right? Yeah. Right. You know what I mean? And it's, we don't know what you know, but it looked like some sort And we're not sure. Yeah. And we, a sexual, A sexual disease, AKA like Ebola. Right. Right. And his dick was missing. It was terrible. And we Have to terrible. We have to be careful and we have to be careful. 'cause he did die within the, he did die in the property of a Korean person's backyard. And they could eat him. They would eat him. Interesting. How you switch that. That is true. True. Well, this before, if it's in your backyard, they eat it. Well, it is true. Your neighbors are Korean. Yeah. And half his body was on the Koreans lawn. Yes. So luckily the Korean family did not eat him. Right. But it, but the, but the rule is, in Korean law, you die on my property. You are for, you know What? So it's very unusual to tell somebody that their three kids and their wife died and is more obsessed with the uncle of where his position of his body is.


Yes. Because my thought, because what I would immediately think about is like, it's can, you're cannibal, but are you using chopsticks teeth? Them? I know, but that's, I I'm telling you that your wife or your three, she has children that would, that would not even be Okay. So honestly, what I would do, I'd be, I, I would take a minute. What I would probably do, honestly, is I would probably do is 'cause I wouldn't be able to live, you know, more than an hour without them. So I would be like, I'm not gonna live anymore. But what I would honestly do, if I'm being completely honest with you Yeah. Honest, I would take it in, obviously be horrified, upset, I would say I'm killing myself tonight. But before I do that, I do want to at least have sex one more time. And I would get a prostitute in Ozark. I would honestly, I would get a prostitute and then I'd get a gun. Yeah. Or any me, and then I'd, and I'd take my own life. But I would have sex with a, a random prostitute one time no condom.


Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's What you would do. Yeah. And I'd pay her, you know, whatever. All money. Most People would, would've just called other pe family members and, and express their grief. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's nothing really. My family's gonna help me. You know, my nothing's gonna help me with that. So you don't think your friends could help you through that? Yeah. You don't think so? No, no, no, no, no, no. How could they, what, what, what is, what could they possibly tell me that would make me better? Well, I mean, c can we just take it one day at a time? First I would say, I go, I know Chris, this is how you feel right now. And I can't imagine what you're going through. Right. But can you do it tomorrow? Have sex with the prostitute? No. No. Oh, yeah. And you know what I mean? And No, I would say, I would say that's still, this is also my last night on Earth.


But I'm gonna go out and I, I have sex with multiple prostitutes. Okay. Okay. Well, well, now there's two. Well, honestly, if you wanna just be honest with you, just because I know that I'm dying that day, I would maybe get one male, one female, and just, just to feel it. 'cause even though I make a lot of gay jokes, I've never done anything gay like that. Well, that's interesting. That Would you have sex with me then? Yes. Do we? I Would, but you know what, what? Through the love that you, you and I make, you might wanna make you live. That's true. Because, you know, what is I, I make you giggle. Yeah. Because you know what it is. You look like you have, even though I know, you know, you have a clean body, like I bet you having sex with you, it's like the, you, like the inside of your body looks like a doll. That's Oh my God. Oh, the nicest things everyone.

It was, yeah. Can you explain to me what happened at the Crusades? Because I don't know anything. Whenever, like, I talk to, no, honestly, whenever I talk to people about religion, and they go, why don't you believe in God? I go, I always say, oh, the Crusades just as a blanking blanketing statement. Right. And then they go, oh yeah, that's right. You know what I mean? I just kind of move on. But I don't even really know what I'm talking about. It's the, The religious war, the Christians versus the Muslims. Oh. So is that what happened? That was it. Big time. But they fought a lot over ancient Turkey. The, the, you know, Christianity thought that their religion was the best Turkey Muslims thought theirs was.


You know what the interesting thing is about who won the Crusades? Nobody real really knows. I mean, I would say really kind of the Christians, but that's 'cause, but I have C Christian tattoos all over my body. I'm actually fighting in the modern day crusade. Wow. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. And we're go, we're, we're going up against a church of Lighter Day Saints tomorrow. That's our match. Oh, I'll be winded. Yeah. Go know.

Because you hear like these things like, oh, it's a very racist thing right now. You'd be like, oh. You'll hear like, oh, you do Muslims dirty, whatever. It's, that's all, that's all such a bullshit. Bullshit. It's a racist thing. All the Muslims I know are clean.


No, no. Right. Because, because it's, because it's reverse racism. Because, because what would happen is, is actually the Muslims were so well, were so educated, so hygienic. They had science hundreds of years before the Christians were the Christians. Sure. Christians came in kind of gangly, disgusting. They, the Muslim people said they could smell the Christian army coming from miles away because they were dirty, filthy heathens. Right. Where Muslims were high science education. Astronomy.

Are so on the ground. Yeah. It's so stern and you know what I mean? They put you in an isolation where then they push you down the river. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Wow. Inflatable. That's incredible. It's pretty. So we didn't really invent anything. A Flexible screen tv. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those things where we took other inventions and made it better, But that's okay. That's, that's what you're good at. Right? That's our, what we were good at. Here's some of look, 5G smartphone, 3D hologram, recharging roads for electric vehicles. Wow. That's pretty big. Because I think that we only got into the game of that J Gun go an automated self striking water clock.


What? We invented that. Yeah. I have four J GOs. Dude, I have four of 'em at home. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. But that's good though. But that's incredible. Let's go to now, let's go now. This is great. Let's go to Vietnamese. Vietnamese, because we're ranking the Asians. Right? So what do they, yeah, yeah. What are the Vietnamese investment? Yes. Let me. Let's guesser forward trail. And by the way, okay. Just know what's gonna happen. You know, what's gonna happen, by the way, too, is people are gonna say that you're allowing me a white person to make fun of Asian culture and Oh, I, I, I, all that stuff. Alright. Wanna push pause for a second? All right. Yeah. Let's, let's talk about that real quick. Okay. I wanna talk about that right now. Okay. I make fun of whites so much, and their culture.


I really do. And, and a lot of my friends make fun of my culture. Right. But Korean isn't my culture. I'm an American. I was born here. I have the same sensibilities as everyone else. You know? I don't know. I mean, I like the food. I do feel like when I'm around my Korean friends, it does feel a little different in terms of like, shared American experiences that we bond into. But I love You so much. I know there isn't a racist bone in your body. And we, what we do is, it's healing for us. It's pleasure to do what we do. It. I think it's healthy, you know what I mean? To out of love, make fun of each other. And this is, this is to me not a bad thing.


You know? I think it's a positive thing. I think this is what Zocdoc workers did back in the day when like, you had different cultures at a Zocdoc, right? And they didn't know that each other's languages. And they made fun of each other's mustaches or the way someone talked, and they would all laugh, drink a beer at the pub or whatever. And was there a way of bonding? And so, I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think you've ever said anything racist. You never said anything that's offended me. And there are, there are a lot of Asians that don't like what I do. A lot of them. Right. And they've told me to my face. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, you're a disgrace or, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? Right. You know, and i's like, it's like, I don't feel that way, you know? Right.


I do what feels right. I, I think that I what? I think I'm very funny and I think you're very funny. And so, can we wait, get past that? Yeah. Let's make fun of the Vietnamese. Let's go. Let's go.

I think, You know what, you know, and I'll, I'll Tell you why. Okay. I'll tell you why. Let's get, get off this. I'll tell you why. Is because throughout my whole life, I've been known not to go to think these events. Yeah. I, I'm not good at the socializations, the social aspects of, of show business.


I've never been good at it. I've been called aloof. I've been called like, he seemed weird. You know what I mean? I'm being real. I mean, that's the things that people say we're a shock. Yeah. People go, I don't invite him because it's, it's weird. You know what I mean? Why he just, he just sits in a corner, don't really talk too much. It's so I try too hard sometimes. 'cause I, I gotta be cool. Right. So it's just like, I'm not like, I'll interject into a conversation I shouldn't interject. Right. You know, I'll give you an example. Last week we were in Vegas, and I got, after my show with Bert, I got invited to Maroon five. Great. And you know, we saw Maroon five, and then backstage Adam wanted to say hi.


So I brought my friend John Park dumbfounded and talk about embarrassing. This guy tried so hard, like, like Adam brought up Korea. And then John just stepped in. Well, yeah, Korea, I'm, I'm, I'm legit in Korea, he says. Right. And eventually I had to go Adam. I'm sorry, he's Try with hard. And I backed him out outside. Wow. Right. I go, shut the fuck up, dude. You're embarrassing. You said that to him. Yeah. And then later he got mad. He was like, you embarrassed me. I go, no, you embarrassed yourself. Okay. But I understand how John was because that's what I'm like sometimes. Hmm. Are you good at parties? What is he famous for in Korea? Nothing.


That's what, no. He was like, I know all the, like, legit restaurants and Yeah. Who, why would Maroon fuck care about that? Exactly. Yeah. Bingo dude. Yeah. They're like, I don't care what the hot restaurant is in Piy. Yang Yang. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. We don't care either. Yeah. Yeah. Either anyone. Yeah. Right. But, and I said, he likes you, John, just back up. Yeah. You're trying too hard. Yeah. And then Adam laughed at that. Right. And he thought I was ridiculing him. Right, right. But anyway, but the truth be known is, I was a little nervous Because of being around him, just Being around that whole situation. Because, you know, you watch that show, it's like high, the highest level of Sure. Production. Yeah. It's incredible. The sound did, they did the choreography.


Okay. It's fine. All it, it's, it's fine. Yeah. It's fine. That's what Germans event of the fart they Did. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not good at parties. No. I, I try to, like, today I have a show, and then after there's people coming to the show, you know, it's la the ages. Well, and I just, I'm, I, I want to run out the back door right after U-T-W-M-E. Oh WME. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I, I wanna run because I don't like the social interaction because I can go on stage and do this all day for hours. But when it's the small talk, I don't know how to do it. I don't want to do it. I get very, very, very uncomfortable. Yeah, me too. I'm not good at it. Right. And yeah, it's, it's an un unnatural almost. You Were really going to town yesterday on that jalapeno cornbread and the brisket in the mac and cheese.


You really? Well, why would you, why would you, you Really just No, because he had stomach problems all night. I heard him going to the bathroom all night. Were you, did you really? I, I had heartburn. Could I be honest with you? I didn't. So I ate a couple of pieces and my stomach has a instinctual alert system. Right. Corinne's invented that. Yeah, I know. We did. Yeah. And it's sort of like a qui outta your butt, you know? I mean, it's not a far, you know what I mean? But it's a que it's Like this. Yeah. Yeah. And my butt did that, and I stopped eating it. Smart. It's my system going. There's something wrong. And you didn't eat again for the rest of the night? No, I did. Oh. I had pasta. Right. So you just completely had carbon era pasta. You Ignored the syst. I did. Yeah.


And I had a difficult night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you ignore the system. Yes. But, but when you, when you, when you, did you keep eating? Did, does your body have an alert system? Sometimes It didn't, it Didn't with that. Okay. Because I eat dinner. Yeah. I, I had heartburn. I woke up in the middle. You had heartburn. Okay. Yeah. And then we ate, and then we ate big Italian meal just before we came in. Then I fell asleep on Don's couch. Oh, that's interesting. So, Let me ask you about your experiences in la. Do you li you don't like it? LA Yeah. I don't have a problem with LA at all, but I am. I am. Absolutely. If you, if you said, Hey, Chris, your career will get twice as big. You just have to go to LA more, or you just have to move to la I would say I'd rather just stay where I'm at and just be in New York, because I don't hate la.


It's just my whole family and life and, and me feeling at peace is all in New York. And then Sure. Sure. I like staying in new original 13 colonies. Okay. Okay. That's What it is. That's enough said. And I, and the well put. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I don't like it. Like, for me, if you could tell me, I'll have a career from, from, you know, Vermont to Georgia, the original 13. I would, I I would like to do that. Really? I don't like to go too far west. I'm, I, this is way too far. This is, to me, this is the Spanish, this is not our country. Our country. What our founding fathers believed was the 13 colonies. And then Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana purchase. He bought too much land. Yeah. Yeah. That's not what we wanted. That's not what was agreed upon. So I like staying in the original 13th. See if we Would've stayed with the 13 colonies, what would've happened with the rest of the country? You think The co Well, it was, it would've been like no man's land.


No. It Would've stayed with Spain and France. And do you know Thomas Jefferson, the actual president of the United States at this time, when he bought the Louisiana purchase, when they sent Louis and Clark out into that big blue West? Mm. Thomas Jefferson. This is, this is why culture is, and society is wild. Thomas Jefferson, who was the president, the sitting president, a very smart inventor type guy, he believed, and they, they were not sure if they were gonna encounter dinosaurs or not Really? I swear to God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In like Ohio and all that. They knew they were gonna encounter hostile Native Americans, but they, they also thought there could be a Tyra Source Rex out there. Wow. Because they didn't have any information. Oh, Right. They were scared. Yeah. Right. Of Course. But so, so that, that's what they thought that, that they thought they were dinosaurs.


And then interesting. But see, the original 13, so from, so from actually not even in Vermont wasn't, wasn't original. So from New Hampshire up to Georgia, that's where that, that's my zone right there. That's where I like to that sell Tickets. That's where I like to stay. Yeah. My family has fun there. We feel close. But don't you like the way it's a little bit more space in la? No. You don't? Like that space gives me anxiety space. When you give me space, you give me places for people to hide. Ah. And I don't like that There are places to hide in New York. No. No. But I know them all. Oh. You know the little cubbyholes. Yeah. I know them all. Oh, I see. Yes. And I, and I think that, and I think that for me out here, things get a little weird out here. You get a lot of serial killers out here. You get a lot of people just alone with their thoughts out here. Mm. Things can move too slow. Yeah.


There's a lot of isolation where over here we're on top of each other. Yeah. And that in the moments can be frustrating. But that, that, that makes us feel more connected as humans. And I, I like it born. I like it more in the original 13. Yeah. Because so does Sam, let's talk about the killer. He was from New York. Yeah. So that New York, that's one you got me on. No, I know.
