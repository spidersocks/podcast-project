Do you understand what I'm saying? It there, there still isn't, you know what I mean? A complete direct line is what I'm saying. They think that what we, they don't understand what we do. Right. And we don't quite understand what they do, but we wanna do what they do and they wanna wanna do what we, why don't we do it together? You know what I mean? But they won't let it, you know what I mean? That's why. But you're in, that's why. No, I'm not. You get a, Or I've done some stuff. I'm not fully in though. You are like in, but you're there because you do their laundry. Oh yeah. Oh, You did it more Asian analogy that How No, yeah. Yeah. Old West. Yes. It's the old West. Yeah. Oh, I know what it is. Yeah. In the, let's say you're a cowboy. Yes. Right? And I'm a a Chinese laundromat guy at in Deadwood.


Right. You come, Hey, I in. Yeah. Hey Chang. You know what I mean? Was see trousers. Okay, Mr. Okay. Mis jean. Right. And you go deliver to my house. Right. Okay. Mis jean. Right, right. And I get through the laundry and I go in and you invite me in for a second. Right. Come on in here, Chang. And I go in. That's the only time you're allowed, allowed in that house, right? Is that the good analogy? That's a good analogy. And then you come in. Okay. And we tie up your feet because we like to Oh yeah. What, what else, what else, what else else, what else happens? The time feed. We like to tie up the Asian Feet down the stairs in the basement. Yeah. Yeah. And I go and I go, what going on here, Mr. I I wash the trouser. It's on the house. Please don't do this to me. Yeah. And then what do you say? And then I tie Out, I said, I'm gonna tie up your feet.


Yeah. Why are you doing this to Mr. Joe? Mr. Joe, why you doing this? Told me Mr. Joe, Put a little soy sauce on your feet. Why? I'm not dumpling. I'm not dumpling Mr. You Don't believe in Jesus? I Don't. I'm Buddhist, I'm Buddhist, Mr. Jones, I'm gonna eat your feet. I Nobody eat, yo. I See, I see. Yeah. Yeah. And then the next time you go to the fucking place, I'm just like wobbling around. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I I've, you have No feet and you're still, and you're gonna still go wash my trousers. Yes. Right to that guy. This, and I have like, I have no, I'm walking on nubs. Oh my God. Here's the scene.


It's just the laundry. Run a small, dusty laundry shop. In a typical old west town, clothes are hanging on a line outside, up, up. And there's the faint sound of a creek in the background. Inside the smell of soap and steam from boiling water fills the air. The three men, Jed, Billy, and coal. Step by a counter leaning on it with various laundry items in hand. Alright, So what am I playing? So you'll be, just Throw It out. You'll, I guess you are. He's Jed. I'll be Jed. You're Jed. And I'm Billy. I'm you're Billy. Yeah. And you're Cole. Okay man. We have to do an accent. No, it's whatever your choice, dude. You're the actor, man. I've never thought I'd be standing in a place like this.


You went out again for my laundry to get done. Ate no cowboy. Got time for laundry. You ain't wrong, Jed. But I reckon it's better than wearing these stinkers another day. I ain't pin washed cleaning the mud. My old lady would've had a fit if she saw me like this. You boys are a lucky. I don't have anyone to complain about me looking like a tumbleweed. My boots smell worse than a Rattler dance. I ain't bothering with no laundry.


Ah, You got a good point. Cole. Ain't must do when you rattle on all the time. I reckon you can smell as bad as you please out there in the wild. But come into down and folks start looking at you like y'all been rolling in cow dung. I reckon it's the dust it gets in your pores, makes you smell like you've been sleeping in the middle of a sandstorm like faheem. I mean, I can't even tell if my shirt's dirtier from sweat or from just sitting in the sun all day. You okay?


Cole? You coughing Cole? I say it's a little bit, you've always ain't much different. But this laundry place, hell, it's like little slice of Symbolization, clean sheets, hot water and the smell of lavender. You sound like a lady. Cole lavender. What happened to riding hard and living free? Living free don't mean you gotta stand like a horse backside, but I do like me some clean socks and underwear. Ain't too proud to admit it. You know, we might ought to be careful what we say.


The way this laundry lady looks it up. I, I wouldn't put it past her to be listening in in our conversation. You've seen her eyes. They got like, that look like she knows everything. Even things you ain't said out loud. Oh yeah. I swear every time I come in here, it feels like she's gonna read my soul. I ain't even sure how she matters. The full laundry so perfectly. Like she's working magic. That ain't magic. That's skill. You don't survive out here without doing. No one had to take care of business.


Maybe she's being in these FARs longer than we seen. See, That's what I like about the West. Everyone's got a story. They ain't telling, but they all know how to make things work. I feel like we're that's the truth. Well, fellas, I reckon it's time to get our shirts back before she starts making us fold them ourselves. Don't Wait, wait, wait. Fuck. Don't want no part of the kind work. Let's again, before she puts a spill on us boys, we may be crying. All right, let's go. Yeah, we got this from the Theon and, and and Spain movie. That's it.


That's it. That it's from.

And you know, I, what I appreciated about it is that you haven't done one Asian accent since you've been on the show. No. Yeah. Yeah. Because why? What? Why? Because I felt when you do it, because I you get some heat on online. I got some heat online. And like, I, like I said before I said this a couple of episodes, I came on here and I apologized because I got yelled at for some Asian accents I was doing.


And I, and I, and I made a genuine deep hearted apology. Yeah. And I ended it with a mdi. I I know, I know. And then people got mad at me at that Too. And then people got mad and they're gonna be mad at that. You think They're gonna be mad at that? Yeah. Yeah. And then I, so I just, I just want to say, look into the camera this time and mean. I really am actually sorry for saying that. Yeah. But he and know, and I'm, I'm, I'm sorry and it hurts me, but We're, you know, you know I make one of you. I have Robin. Yeah, I know, I know. That's a tension. I Know when white people, well you had this, yeah. You gotta stretch it out farther because it relieve the brain sometimes.


You Yet Getting Into the temple, you know what helps is sometimes when I have a, my therapist said to do this. Yeah, yeah. The attention ache, you pull it back and you go like this And That releases the pressure. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah, I do that too. I do it too. And it feels so good. Your headache goes away. White people, I'm telling you, no matter where you are, you know what I mean? Sometimes, sometimes, yeah. When you're in TaeKwonDo class or wherever it might be at, sometimes you, a local Chinese restaurant, if you have a headache, see? Right there you go. Oh, oh yeah. That guy has a headache. That's not Mickey Rooney. Yes. Guy with A headache Sometimes asked, Last week, my daughter was asking me for help with her math homework.


And I said, honey, I don't Know the answer Then I like this just to really, and the answer just came to me. And then I, okay. And then I just said, Yeah, yeah. Now let me ask you, you're Asian right, Jules? Well, you see white people behave like that. How do you feel? Well, If I don't know them, then it's, That's the thing. There we go. That's what we're talking about here. But I was, It's about we know each other. I make fun of white people's penises. I make fun of their dumbness. You know what I mean? Their, some of their cultural misgivings. Yes. And I think if I know somebody, I feel like anything's at play here.


I've made a decision in my life. And me too, to freed me from a lot of stuff online is I don't care about anyone's opinion good or bad. Unless I personally know you or I've met you. Like if you told me about Chris, what you said hurt me, I would genuinely apologize to you. But if random fan online, if they tell me I'm doing great or doing bad, I don't let it affect me either way. Yeah. Only people that I personally know and I've met in the physical space because I, my brains are not equipped. I can't, I can't process praise or hate from Nebraska. Yeah. I can't process it. Well, We have a friend in mute. I don't wanna say his name, but we have a friend that he was working through that. Right. He called me a couple of months ago, paranoid Right. About a bunch of stuff online that he was reading.


He was super depressed. Right. And I told this person, I said, don't read it. Yeah. You just don't read it. Yeah. I don't read anything. No. Yeah, no. People go, oh, well read it this. And I don't even know. I've never been on it. I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. And that's how you have to live. Because if I did read it, I think it would affect Me. And you know what, and you know what? Our friend, our mutual friend who, Him, I Wanna say his name so bad when we talked to him about it. I Wanna say his name. Say his name, and then put a paton dot com slash Bad Friends. No, we said, he said, and he, this is very accurate of him. He said, you know, all that, looking online for the comments, all that comparison stuff, it's a form of self-hate. You hate yourself.


And so you're looking to be, you're looking for it to be justified by the comments. You wanna say, oh, Chris sucks. You're looking for it. 'cause you think you suck. But if you're positive, you come from a positive place, you don't go looking for it. So I think you at times, Bobby, you know, I need therapy, I need this, you need that. But you're a much more positive place than you think. No, I, no, I think I am. I think that, I think I am, I, I've been doing things that, let's be serious for a second now. We're doing a lot of like, you know, this and a lot of san crazy sand stuff. You know what I mean? All that stuff. But what I wanna say is, is that there's another thing that I do is I, I was at the Chicago Improv and I was at the Schaumburg Improv. I was in the green room, and a waitress came, you know, every green room, the club waitress is, they're, they're the head.


You know, they're, they take care of you. That's the head Waitress. The head waitress. And she's like, I'm, I am, I'm gonna be a waitress all weekend whenever you need. Yeah. Just let me know. She wants the tips. And so she, she goes, this is so and so, and she's interning and she seemed shy, but also she kind of looked me weird. She was like, she kinda looked at me like this. And when they left, I turned to the comics in the room and go, oh yeah, she doesn't like me. They go and they, and they go, what? Yeah. I go, I can, I go, I can tell. And then I You think It's because, but do you think it's because, were you making it up or do you think it's because you pulled your dick out? No, I didn't. No. That wasn't when I did that. Oh, yeah. I would never do that, dude. I, alright. I would never do that.


I would respect her too much. Okay. And that wouldn't be good. And by the way, I just wanna make it clear, even if it looks like I did on camera before, I didn't pull out any of my penis. I, I, I, I know You Don. I know. It was my thought. Exactly. Thought it was your thought. I know. Exactly. Alright. Right. So let's get that on the clear. Yeah. But then two days later, she, she came up to me, she goes, Hey, I just wanna let you know, I'm just like, I have a bad friend's t-shirt. I'm a huge fan. Oh. So it, in my mind, I was like, oh, I make assumptions about people that aren't true. And it's because I, I, growing up, I don't have to read my parents because my parents were snapper heads. Is that a, is that like a, a slur Damn snapper heads where to take it up all No. For Koreans from No, no, no, no.


They, they were physically violent towards you. Yeah. Yeah. And they would just, you, you know, and so every day was reading the situation and, and to protect myself. Right, right. To like, for danger. And I do that out in the wild, you know what I mean? And I'm tired of doing it because it's like, it's usually not true. You know what mean? And I feel comfortable with when they don't like me. And when people like me, I feel uncomfortable. Which I wanna change that narrative as well. But, Well, here's the good thing to know is that most people don't care at all. Most people, I, they don't care. That's the thing. They don't think About it. You know what it is with assume you know what it is. You make an asset of you and me. You know that. I know that. That's what it's, that's a really good, I like those little Oh, here.


Yeah. Yeah. I like those little, Just one More. Here's another one a little. Here's another one. Tidbit. Here's another parable. And this one's for You Don. Their wives are foolish and their children wicked. A curse. Their brood. But the children of adulterers, Don, how come you never sit down? Come sit down for that. Come Sit down will remain that issue. You never come in. And the cony of an unlawful bed will disappear for should they attain long life, they'll be held no esteem. Should they die abruptly. They will have no hope or comfort in the daily of scrutiny for dire is the end of the wicked generation. Yeah. That's what it's Don, did you listen? That was for you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That was really good. What You doing? Whatcha doing? Oh, There was little advice I was telling you yesterday. You want me to say it? Tell, tell. No, I tell no.


Then why'd you just do that? Because you, 'cause I was practicing. Oh, yeah, yeah. We were practicing. Yeah. That was very good though. You were very good learner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Chris. Yes. Yes. I'll just tell you. Tell him. I could tell him. Tell him. But yeah. It has nothing to do with. Yeah, yeah. I was just saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So what I'm saying is, is that, you know, when you're in a relationship Right? And I was telling a bunch of comics that's in the room. Yeah. Right? And you wanna get outta the relationship. I can never end it. Right. Alright. Because what you do is you have to find a window to get out. Right. Right. So you can force a window to open. Right. By doing some of my techniques, You can force a window to be open.


Yeah. Yeah. The problem is for me with that, where I, I have, I don't have, my house isn't the best right now. And I have air conditioners in the window. It's An analogy. Open the window. An analogy. I don't have central air. It's an analogy. Okay. But I, I could hurt something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't wanna do that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It was just an analogy or door to open whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. An opportunity. An opportunity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And that's what you have to get out. Right. Okay. So what it is, what you do, the little techniques, and one of the techniques I was telling people was you want her to break up with you subtle things. The coward way. That's a coward's way. Right. The coward way. So you do subtle things. And one of my techniques is you forget their name for a split second every time. And you use a snap.


Right? So you go, Hey Kathy. Right? Yeah. Hey, what are we gonna eat tonight, Kathy? Right. You do that smart 30 times it seeps into their subconscious and they don't know what's bothering them. They don't know what that's bothering them, right? Yeah. And they, it, that's where the windows will open Another one. I have a several of 'em. Smart What? Very Smart. That's actually very smart. Tell 'em another One. Another another one. Which one? The, The, I think I've told people this one before on this podcast before. Let's hear it though. I haven't heard it. Okay. You Haven't heard it. Right? Remember this pro, you can, sometimes you can say things that you've said in a podcast before, previously, because guess what, as Marcus really said, you never step in the same river twice.


Mm. 'cause the river's always flowing. It's always new water. So when you step in, it's a different light, a different experience. Oh, So you can say the same things. Kinda motion. Yes. That's, this is a different river. We never step in the same river twice. Oh, it the, the the I. Yeah. Yeah. So all you have to do this is five times. Okay. So those snapping 30 times this five times. Okay. When you orgasm, you don't make a noise. You look directly into their eyes. You, they have to be looking at you. Correct. Right. And you orgasm with your face. It's hard for me to, I'm never looking in when I come. I know, but this is what you need to do. I'm always facing this way. I know. Yeah. In order for you to do this exercise, you have to be doing missionary. So I have to have a mirror. This is do. Right. You look in their eyes and you go, you go, you go like this.


You go like that. Right. If you do that five times subconsciously Right. They will break up with you. Yeah. Really terrifying. Yeah. It's terrifying. Terrifying. Third thing. Yeah. Third Thing. Third thing. Right. That's third thing. This is a basic one. No, this is good. You gave 'em the same present twice. Mm. That's huge. It's a good one. That's a good one. Right. Because they usually go, they always say, I don't, it's just the fact that counts. You know what I mean? Like, I don't care. Right. Right. Here's two oven mitts bitch. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. That's smart. Right handed and a left one for the Christmas one for Christmas.

You say that because I had a friend, he was dating girl for five years. Yes. He thought they were gonna get engaged. And then on her birthday one year, he gave her a card with a hundred dollars bill in it. I Suggest. Great. She broke up with him. That's Great. That's brilliant. Right. Broke up with him because she wanted an engager and he gave her a hundred bucks cash. Yeah. Yeah. I did this once and she didn't break up with me. Sarah Hyland, she can even defend, she can even back it up. Yeah. Actress, Sarah Hyland. No, there's a different Sarah Hyland. Oh, alright. It'd be awesome. A comedian Sarah Hyland. Right. So Sarah, we were dating for a couple years. The first year she gave me a vintage painting from a store, like a vintage.


She like going shopping at like I that like antique stores and vintage, you know. And then I gave it to her Next year. You regifted It. I re-gifted it to her. Smart. Forgetting that she gave it to me. Right. And it was super embarrassing, but she still didn't break up with me. Right. But she really loved You. Yeah, she really did love Me. What about getting back with her? What about She's married now with a, to my friend Jen. Oh. She's a Lebo. She's bisexual and she's a very funny comic. And I love her and she's family to me. But, you know, I think if you're gonna be a bisexual woman, you're the, you're a very good guy. Well, it's a, it was 'cause you're neutral. You Know what I mean? I've had a couple of situations where lesbians have gone dated me for a couple years.


Yes. Then everyone around them have been women. So I've never really questioned that about myself. Yeah. You know what I mean? I mean, what do you think of that? Just because, Because it is 'cause you're very interesting gone. What do you think of that? I, Well, you got, you've, you've soft skin. And I think that, that it's like a, it's smooth. So it's an easy transition. Mm. Like I can look at you from across the room and go, yes. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I've seen you look at me like that from across the room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

What you, well, you, you have really, really good ones so far. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the, the, the, the best one was the Snapping.


Snapping, forgetting the name. Yeah. Yeah. One, it's gotta be a split second though. Everyone know it. If you live too much of a thing, it, then it's noticeable. Right. And that's why I think the snapping is very important. You know what's another good one too? Yeah. Can Give. Yeah. Lemme write it down. If You come home, you could, every time she comes home from work and is happy to see you, you're just laid out on the couch drinking a beer. Yeah. Like, you're depressed. Like, and then, and then, and then when your friends come over, right. You jump up. You can't wait to go out with them. You kind of subconsciously tell her. Right. I'm having fun with my friends and when I'm with you, I'm miserable. Right. And she starts to say, do I make him miserable? Yeah. That's what you do. You can, you can tell her you're gonna call her like, I'm gonna call you in 30 minutes. Then You don't. And then, oh, those are Good. Those are good. Two hours later. Never call her her. Yeah. Never call her. Yeah. I, I, yeah. Yeah. But those are immediately, you Can tell her you're gonna pick her up from the airport.


Never show up. Wow. But See, this is a, a room full of power that can sit. No, no. Wait. I'll tell you why those don't work. 'cause what? My things are subtle. Right. Subtle.
