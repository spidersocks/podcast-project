That was a big point of contention. Two things. One, yeah. I did say to Carlos, I made him do, Simon says before the show, 'cause I think he was stoned.


And I asked him, and he's Try with tell me he's not. But I looked into his eyes. You look into his eyes. I wear contacts. No, he's Carlos. It, it'd be it, it would be better if you were honest. I didn't smoke weed today. I smoked last night. Last night. Weed. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. So now we know. Now you're fully gone relapsed. That's called California sober. No, that's not a real thing. I call, yeah. That's not a real, you can call it, But people say that all over the internet, but It's not real. That's like a fake. I do meth, but I have, I'm call Colorado sober. It's Colorado sober. Yeah. It's the same thing. It doesn't make any sense. No. This is like one in the lexicon. It was in white lotus, I think. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. But it doesn't mean you should do it. I thought you were clean, clean, clean.


I thought we were all out When I saw him in the alleyway. Oh no. In Australia. Yeah. He had a glaze over his eyes. I don't know what he was on. What were you on in Australia? In the alley. Marijuana. That's it. And You lied to me. Yes. You lied to. No, you know what I did? You lied to me. No, I got you on a technicality. I went into the hotel and I said, bobbylee, I'm not drinking. Why? What do you mean? Because I need something on this earth. Bobbylee doesn't need anything. He Should have something though. No, he has lot of Things. I do. I do agree. I should have something. You Have sugar free Red Bull and cigarettes. Yeah. But sometimes I want more to ground my sorrows. Do What do you want? I mean, sometimes I would love to smoke weed, you know what I mean? To zone out. But You don't need to.


I don't need to. And I ha I've been three years. I haven't. So that's Great. Yeah. Why, why would we crack it now? Because I'm, my fear though, is, is that once that door is open, I do all the other stuff. Oh, yeah. And I can't have that. Yeah. So I just decided to do all, I mean Yeah. Because what he's saying also can happen to you. You may decide. So what, dude, I'm, I'm gonna be San Bernardino sober and just have one pill. Yeah. You do pills too. No, You do do pills. You, that's so, such a project. Projective to me. You don't, I pro only Xanax and Lexapro, which Those are pills prescribed From, those are called pills, dude. But you get 'em at Walgreens. I know. But they can prescribe any, I do meth, but I only smoke it. Right.


That's what it sounded like. That's What, It's not cartel stuff. So it's good. All right. Well, whatever. I, I'm just looking out for your wellbeing. Yeah. I'd rather you be clean as a whistle clearheaded. I know, but I'm just, I'm Gonna sober Carlos, my history with Carlos is this, when I first met him, he was full fullblown in Alcoholics Anonymous. It was great. And anyone that's in aa Right. People aren't because they had like, you know what I mean? An accent. It, it takes a lot of pain and suffering to drive you into a 12 step group. Yeah. And to be committed to it. Right. So that's, you know, your history with it. Right. You know that you're an alcoholic and drug addict.


Do you? Yeah. Okay. You have other addictions too, like sex, you relapse Too. That's, that's not a pointing. It's not a, it's not a pointing threat. I'm Not arguing with you. That's not a, like a tit for tat. But Bobby's being like, oh, I'm Mr. Sober and I know everything. And, but he's also Reading that that's not true. He's not being, I know everything Mr. Sober. He's just saying to, to get back on the right track and stay clean. Have I done any drugs or alcohol since I got sober three years ago? No, But you've literally done them with me and, okay. But this, okay. You see what he is doing? That's the dur drug addiction. Jedi shit. Yeah. You are Jedi shit, dude. Yeah. Yeah. You're angling. You're angling. You're Angling good. Yeah. You're trapping and angling. You're leading into a corner.


You're trapped. You're A rat. Trapped in a corner. You're a rat trap. Yeah. You're a rat trapped dude. I don't think Like rats should get in trouble for like having a little bit of cheese. A rat as fat as you doesn't need any more cheese. Yeah, Exactly. You're not taking The prosciutto. Anyway, Let's move on. Let's move on. Yeah. Yeah. But Had a great time in the city of Minnesota. So Andrew did his special, he did four shows I did To cut it together. It's gonna be a wonderful piece of artwork. Well, I hope so. A really, it was a little bit of a challenge at the beginning, finding everything the way that I wanted to find it. And also, boy oh boy, was I upset at my team? Shane Gillis was in town. Kevin Hart was in town. I was like, what the fuck?


Oh. So I saw a photo with you and Shane Gilly played the target center where the Minnesota Timberwolves play. And Kevin played a big theater. Like he did, like four, the five theaters or something, all in Minneapolis that weekend. But did you were, your show was full? No. Yeah, they sold out. But I'm just, what is, what's the ball called? No, no, no. I'm just saying, thank god Shane sells out same day. Because imagine if Shane was playing big theaters and he wasn't an act that could sell out an arena same day, then we would, we definitely share some audience. Do you know what I mean? Right, right. Kevin and I definitely no crossover. We joked, we were like, Kevin was, Shane goes, I guess you and I had to split all the whites in town.


I was like, yeah, Kevin, there's no competition. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, thank God Shane's so famous. He sold out the target center the same day. Wow. That's how famous. He's like, we, I'm lucky we got around to it. But I think it's a bummer because ticket prices are so stupid now. And we can't control them anymore. It sucks. The promoters Ticketmaster, the venues. It's disgusting what they do now. And people can't go to, both people couldn't see me on Friday and see Shane on Saturday. There's no way they could afford that. I think it fucking sucks. So I wish, I wish they communicated to go, Hey, this guy's in town shooting. Can we reserve this, you know, this weekend if we could skip it or come back To, but you're complaining about something that didn't happen though.


No, no, no. I do think it affected the way that I moved the, at the end, moved tickets at the end. Oh, I see. Do You know what I mean? Yeah. Like it, it definitely changed people. 'cause People, the first time I played the Philadelphia Helium. Yeah. I love that club. I showed up at the club. I'm not kidding you. It's not an exaggeration. I showed up at the first show on a Friday night. There was seven people. Oh my God. Right. And I kind of looked around and go, oh, I guess it's, I'm not big here. You know? Right. They're like, oh no. It's just literally right across the street, Chappelle's there. And I go, what am I gonna do? Oh, I got booked. Right. And then the second show was full and it, and half the audience was like, oh, we saw the Chappelle show earlier. And we came to both.


That's pretty rad. Still the first show I was gonna kill myself in. Oh yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you can't, I mean, I understand what you're saying. Well, when you're fighting, when you're fighting upstream, because people can't see both. And he takes a lot. I mean, he's so famous. Shane's the best. He's the biggest. So it's, you know. Yeah. You can't fight that. But anyway, it was a good weekend in Minneapolis. I love, I love Minneapolis. Although I was scared to come home once again because Of the flights, bro. I had turbulence last night. But It's getting outta control. It is today. How many today? Another cache? No, no, no. Dude. A southwest plane. Almost hit a private jet. Today. Today? Today. Oh my God. It, Look at this near miss. It's landing or taken off.


It's landing. And Is that it? The Jet's right there. Yeah, the jet's right there. Look at that. Okay. It's landing and the jet is coming. And so he took off again. Oh my God. Is it the, what do we call the people of the tower? The f fa? Well, no, the control tower. The, the control tower. Control Tower. Our tower people control tower People. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Air control. Is it their fault? What is going on here? I dunno, man. Something's going on though. Like, do you not Believe that could have been a disaster, dude. Yeah. Everybody dead. Everyone dead. How is this not, Yeah, they gonna work It out. Do we think something's going on? Can we make up a conspiracy please? Did they Fire all of the FAA Please. Okay. I have a conspiracy. Is That real? No.


All the white ones. I have a conspiracy. Mm. And I think it's connected. I heard it. Hear me out guys. I heard your joke and I'm sorry they didn't laugh. It's Okay. I didn't like it. Just please. Okay. Your resentment right now is so evident. No, it's like you're Gaslighting me. Dude. Dude, you're Try with. Get me resentment. Look, we know you're not high. Now we just Saying Andrew, was that gaslighting? No, there was no lighting there. There, There was. Thank you. There was no lighting from Andrew by mistake. I, I thought I saw a little light. Yeah, there's no light. And if you saw one, it was dim Soie. So Sit down. You dumb dumb. Oh, you're not a dumb dumb dude. Yeah. He's the one, the dumbest dude. He's the one of the dumbest on earth. You really think that? Yeah.


He's one of the smartest dudes in common. No, No, you're right. Alright, Lemme finish this point and then we'll get to you. Yeah. Dan Soder. Yeah. Dude, love you. I love You too. The last time we did a gig together, you weren't that nice to me. Bullshit. That is a hundred percent in your Head, but where there's no real this. Well, Yeah. 'cause it was two gigs we hung out with. I know. Where was it? On the Burt Tour? On the Burt Tour. So It's chaos. You're just in the middle Of chaos. Yeah. But he, you know, I try to start conversations. We talk, there's no dick locking. No, no, no. I wanna Dick lock again. First Off, I'll dock with you all day. He will. Zocdoc, I'll go get foreskin put on my penis in order to dock. Wow. I'll do whatever The, you know what? I believe you, whatever the reverse. Lemme finish my theory here, Dan, and we'll get to you.


Okay. All right. Anyway, this Is good. You're gonna wanna hear this. Yeah. So I think the reason why there's a connection between the flights, you know what I mean? Getting in these accidents, All the flight crashes And the drones that we saw a month ago. Oh, the ch the Chinese drones. Yeah. Wasn't there a lot of drones? A couple of months ago? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Around right. New Jersey, right? New Jersey. It was, it was in California as well. It was everywhere. Really? Yeah. It there, I could there be a, a a a link there. You think Something in the Alien airspace. Something UFO airspace. What, what, what, what could it be? Are you thinking like the drones are causing the accidents? Maybe there's a connection is all I'm saying. I like that you're saying that like a CIA guy where you go there could be a connection.


Yeah. I'm not saying affirmative. I'm not saying Negative. Do you ever see Zero Dark 30 Brother? I've never seen it. Oh Yeah. Have you seen Zero Dark? Yeah. Yeah. I haven't. You haven't? No. There's another documentary called Manhunt. Yeah. Okay. Well guess who caught who did they track? Lemme ask you who did they track to get to Osama Bin Laden. Exactly right. The courier, The mail delivery guy. No, he used one guy for information. So he, there was one guy Yeah. That would drive to his AED Al a Wall. Yeah. Right. That dude. Right. Is that Amir Kay? It is Am Mirror. You know what? And now he's doing standup and he's very successful.


You know, mean What a second act. Yeah. Right, right. Just being a hilarious standup comic. Yeah. In a movie. You Know, he used a courier for OI Ben La in a movie I would cast Michael Pena. I think a hundred percent Looks like Michael Penn. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And not Amir Kay. No, It'd be Michael Penn. Yeah, Yeah. Mean. Anyway, so I think there, so in, in, in the, the one lady in the CCIA was like, we, I think we should track the courier. And everyone was like, no, no, no, no, no. Right. But that ended up being the truth. Yeah. Wow. And she didn't even really know what the connection was, but she followed a gun's instinct. I think that's what I'm doing with the fucking drones, dude. So your instinct is that the drones are making the planes crash. I don't know exactly the connection between them, but there's a gun instinct there.


You Just feel like it is, you go, I feel like, yeah, these two, I feel like It is. Yeah. What's your theory? Soder? I don't know. These plane crashes are crazy. How many are happening? There was also an avoided one. Did you guys see the one we just Talked about That? We just talked about that just now? Yeah. That I have. Whenever something like this happens, I immediately empathize with the other plane. Just like, remember when the bridge in Baltimore where the boat drove into the Bridge? Oh yeah. Dude, Just this moment of like, I lapse, I don't know anything about it. Please explain to me that catastrophe. There was a boat that, like, it was like one of those short stack boats, almost like, you can bring it up. I want, I want the clinical version of the boat, because I don't get short stacked. I Don't even know what that means. I made that up. All that. But see, It's like a afraid A carry, a freight freighter boat.


Freighter Boat ran into a bridge. Dark Knight. They had those in a Dark Knight, A dark night boat, Dark night boat. I felt like a dark night boat In the biz. We call it a dark boat. 'cause remember the, in the Dark Night, the first Batman movie. Wasn't there like a thing where he first goes, I'm Batman. Which is a dead on impression. Yeah. That was perfect. Yeah. Thank you. Really good. I thought Christian ba was in the room. You, These are called container chips. Container ships. But what doesn't That sound more made up than shorts Stack container. I know, it sounds like Bullshit. Mine completely. Mine was completely made up. Shorts Stack sounds great. Yeah, it's a Shortt Stack chip. I call it Brad William Shortt stack. Right, Right. So that's my nickname for him. But my point is, is that, so what happened here? So this, this, like this boat went into the bridge. Yeah. And you see it at night.


It like shuts the lights off and it fucks shit up with few People on the road. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if anyone died in that. No. People did die. Yeah. A few people did die. Yeah. Yeah. The cars. Yeah. The few people around, no one on the boat died. And all the containers were safe, by the way. But everyone wants to go like, oh, terrorist, this was a terrorist attack or whatever. But just like the small jet that almost got hit this time, just like a guy being an idiot, fucking being like, fuck, fuck, fuck dude. Is that, is that fucking plane about to take off? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. It's like coming down and you're like, it's a fuck, fuck. Fuck. And someone's just yelling your name in your ear, going like, bobbylee Bobbylee. I, I've said that when I was entering a woman's vagina. Oh Yeah. That's a fuck. Fuck yeah. No, But no, in a panic like that, like, I shouldn't be doing it.


Oh, right. You know, fuck, Fuck, fuck, Fuck. Ah. Yeah, Yeah. And then somebody dies. Yeah. Have you ever had sex with somebody you didn't wanna have sex with? I don't know how to answer that. By You mean like, just like, I, like I wasn't physically attracted to, or that No, but You just knew that they were little cray cray. You know, sometimes you little cray. You're like, what's gonna happen once I enter this? That's my early twenties brother. Yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you've ever been to Tucson in Arizona. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Brother. Brother. Tell me about it, brother. I was living it. Did you have any, did you have any double xl? Did you ever go down that road? Anybody heavy? Yeah, I like a larger lady. I mean, double xl. Oh no. Like I, I, I vastly outweighing you.


So, So, I, I have a way because you're a big dude, and I'm not lying. I had sex with one time year, many, many, many years ago with a 400 pound woman. That is, that's not, I don't think that's physically Possible. And that happened in Phoenix 20 years ago. Did they have to lower you? My Brother hooked it Up. Did they have to lower you down into her, Steve? I dunno if it's a hookup. Well, yeah, it's a hook down. It's a hook down. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. But she Goes, it was like a medical procedure. She said, I'm gonna lay on my back then you're gonna enter me. And I, I did it though, like a soldier. Yeah. You went through with it. Yeah. 'cause sometimes you, you're nom, right? You're in Hamburger Hill. Yeah. You really Going, you get it right.


You're going through it. Right. And your sergeant goes, we gotta fucking take over this hill. And You're up first And you Yeah. And you don't want to, but you end up up there anyway.

It was actually kind of funny. Okay. I loved it. I actually thought it was very funny. Someone sent me the clip. I was like, that's pretty funny.


Okay. So, so it's my, I'm the be I'm the one that needs to change. I'm the wrong. Wow. I'm the bad guy. That Level of accountability. Yeah. And I, I'm ashamed Don't Be of the bullshit that I said, Hey, no, stop. You are, you are entering a new phase in life. Yeah. Where you are taking ownership. I'm Try With, figure out if I really believe what I said. So I'm going through that right now. You know what I mean? I just be honest with you. Like reflect. Do I really feel that way? Maybe, maybe not. But I shouldn't have said it out loud. That's okay. I'll tell you that right now. In fact, I will say this, I do believe what I said all of it. Oh. But I shouldn't have said it out loud. Okay. Too. Yeah.


That's Crazy. That's pretty good. That was a 180 to a 180. We're right back where we started. If you watched a trial with that kind of admit where he goes. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I'm sorry I killed her. But am I sorry I killed her? Not really. But I am sorry that I did it. I sh I felt it. And I'm fine for feeling that. Take a breath. I haven't masturbated in five days. Wait, you, why haven't you jerked off in five days? I'm Try with not Five days. Yeah. Five days is a pretty good amount of time. When did you notice it? Like, what was the worst day so far? Like today? Last night I tried to, and I couldn't do it four Day four is when I start to get a itchy. Yeah. Ari Shafi told me that he said this out loud. So I, you know Yeah. That he, the way you know his girlfriend, great girlfriend, right?


Yeah. That the reason he, he met her in the first place 'cause he wasn't masturbating for a long time. And then when that happens that it motivates you to like, you know, when you meet a girlfriend, go find like, Hey, meet us at the bar. You don't go. He, it motivated him to go. Yeah. 'cause he had full balls. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it is a good advice. Five days though. You, you gotta, you gotta empty it out, man. Yeah. Go, go empty the clip. And Maybe that's why I'm acting the way I am today. That's exactly right. That actually explains A lot. You know what that is it because you're aggressive, you're being very aggress. I'm Being very aggressive. Right? Yeah. You're, Yeah. You're just horned up, dude. I'm Horned up. You're a little full. And so Shane, if you're listening, don't start a war with me. Yeah. Dude. I'm horned up. This Is, you get what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. A guy getting into a fight with another guy, be like, brother, don't, I'm just this way because you're horny.


Dude, I just realized it. The reason I tried to fight you in that bar is 'cause I have a boner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm pumped outta my mind. I am. So, yeah. So I apologize. And I think people listening get it. Oh. Huh. I think they get it. I Think they get it too. Any rational person would get It. Yeah. Now, can I ask you another question? What do you think of Pizzeria? Bianco in Phoenix? I know you called me about this. We talked, have you been there? Yeah. He's to Tucson. He doesn't know Phoenix as well. Yeah. I, I know. Oh, so south On I 10. So years ago, a film critic In New York Times said that that's the best pizza on Planet Earth. And it became a gigantic, you say hours away. Big planet. Yeah. And Big planet to say Earth.


Dude. That's insane. And you know, I went there again. It's pretty Good. It's good, Dude. Is it, is it like, have you had Frank Pepe's In Connecticut? That's like one of the, that's like the one. Oh, why would I go there? I don't know. You connect shows Connecticut has some of the best pizza They're Try with.

Because I've been going to cities for years. That's not why. It's because your your el your, your presence is elevated. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, you Right. Can we agree with that? So how are you dealing with it? I didn't know who this guy was before he walked in the door. I just randomly walk in.


Can I sit down on your podcast? Oh. So people that we have on this podcast are people that are elevated. Yeah. So how does it feel? Feels Good. Okay. God, Thank you by the way, bobbylee. I'm sorry. Easy Fucking answer dude. But just like the way you described me so bad. You went, you went the, the worst thing with me is me Try with be confident with myself. Yeah. It's hard to, I know You can shit on me all you want. Bring it on baby. Yeah. We can have fun. But the second you go like, good job. I go, that's just fucking, it's the hug and step. Why are like, why are we like that? It's The hug and stepbrothers. 'cause it's what you just said it earlier, it's the bullying that made you funny. Yeah. I'm shocked when people are like, come to my shows and it's sold out or whatever. I always turn to the manager and go, is there some sort of promotion going on?


And they go, what do you mean? I go, I mean, is it a two for one Or I, what's going on? He goes, no, it's regular pricing. You sold out. And I'm always, I look in the audience and I go, wow. I've told this story before on, on the regs, but I was working the blue room in Springfield, Missouri. And I drove from Kansas City to Springfield and I had a bunch of texts and people were like, they were like, dude, the club's running a special where if they buy tickets to you, they're entered into a raffle to see Matt Rife. And like so many comics texted me screen, grabbed it and sent it to me. They're like, wow. Really? Yeah. They Were like, same audience, But they were like, they were like, Hey, buy tickets to this fucking ogre and then maybe you can see Matt rife.


And it works. It worked. Wow. Yeah. My ticket sales were dog shit. And there were people there and it was, it was pretty wild. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. That's like where you're like, oh, so you guys are running around. Okay. And then when it really happens, you go, First time I played the Mall of America. Yeah. How's of comedy? Dude? Maybe 20 people. Maybe. And that's like a 500 seat route. That's a hard, That's a full circle circle moment though. Taping your special in Minneapolis. That was pretty cool. That wa it wa it wa It was really cool. It was. That one hurt a lot though. The mall. 'cause you walk into to, It's a big room too, And you have to walk into the mall before you go to a club, which hurts you twice. It's Also a top floor. Yeah. You have to pass it. So you have To go up escalators and elevators. And Honestly, that Jamba Juice is doing some heavy lifting.


Yeah. There's a, I'm right. I'm getting an Orange Dream machine and then I'm going upstairs. Just By the way, it's an orange Julius now. I'm just kidding. I I'm glad you said that because that was my worst turnout of all time. I got, I age the, all of the marathon. Oh My God. Dude. And I, and I just, I can see an image of me, like a Paul Thomas Anderson shout at me like going down the escalator when it's over passing. Like the guy had journeys, like turning off the Lights. Yeah. Shutting the cage. Yeah. Like, yeah dude, it hurt. It hurts so much when you like, have to do that. But it makes you a great comic. And to piggyback what you're saying, not to be a sappy fuckhead, but I think every, every set now I've been thanking the fans and I did it every night of the special 'cause it does mean the world to me that they show up.


I think it's so dope that they come out. It's it, dude, it, it never has made me go. Yep. Knew it. Every time I go out, I go, wow dude. Thank you. Unreal. Amazing. Do you have, but there's a couple of comics we know, you know, that are like, I knew it was gonna be this way. That's crazy. I do get resentments though, of clubs that didn't treat you well. Yeah. You know what I mean? Now you won't play them. Yeah. I got A couple. What do you mean? Totally? I got A couple. Is that right though? Is that healthy? That's like, if any, if any regular person at a, at, at your regular job, at home, whatever job that you work, if someone treated you poorly in your customer route and then you started doing well on in some other version of your job and then those customers wanted to come back, you'd be like, get fucked.


Yeah. The Clubs I play now are, the clubs are necessarily not because of the draw, but it's because they treated me when I was down. Yeah. Really? So when I talked about Hartford, Connecticut at that Funny Bone Mm. I was down then. Yeah. Right. And I just want people to be regular and nice. Yeah. When they're, when they're, when they're good to you. When they don't have a reason to be. I I Have loyalty. Yeah. You're like, oh, cool. Well then I'll come back.
