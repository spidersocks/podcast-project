Oh man, We have to do an accent. Well, it's whatever your choice, dude. You're the actor, man. I've never thought I'd be standing in a place like this. We went out again for my laundry to get done. Ain't no cowboy got time for laundry. You ain't wrong, Jed. But I reckon it's better than wearing these stinkers another day. I ain't been washed cleaning the month. My old lady would've had a fit if she saw me like this. You boys are lucky. I don't have anyone to complain.


I, I mean looking like a tumbleweed. My boots smell worse than a Rattler dance. I ain't bothering with no laundry. Ah, You got a good point, Cole ain't must do when you rattle on all the time. I reckon you can smell and smell as you please out there in the wild. But come down and folks start looking at you like y'all been rolling. Cow dung. I reckon it's the dust it gets in your pores, makes you smell like you've been sleeping in the middle of a sandstorm like Faheem.


I mean, I can't even tell if my shirt's dirtier from sweat or from just sitting in the sun all day. You okay? Cole? You Cole? It's a little bit, you've always ain't much different but this laundry place, hell, it's like a little slice of symbolization, clean sheets, hot water and the smell of lavender. You sound like a lady Cole lavender. What happened to riding a hot and living free?
