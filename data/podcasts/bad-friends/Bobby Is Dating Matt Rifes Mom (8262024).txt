I said to you, I'm, I'm proud of you. I'm happy for you. And I said, just don't let them work you to death. And. they sure did. And then a and then within like a month Mm, we were in I saw that. Yeah. Riverside or some shit. And this motherfucker announced like a three year tour. I'm like, they got his ass. Yeah. Outta good dude. Yeah. How are you feeling being tour touring? So as much as you are? Well, I had to take two weeks off. 'cause I almost like, I thought I was gonna fucking die. I, I went seven straight days without a single minute of sleep whatsoever. Wow. And I was doing this casino in, what was it? Is it Sun Valley in NorCal? Mm. I don't know. I don't, maybe I have no idea. One those casinos Up there. Yeah, sure.

I got this fucking wireless hands free mic now. Yeah. I'm one of those. Yeah. Joel Oldstein. Little hands Free boy. And I'm like holding on. I'm sitting down the whole time holding on, holding onto the stool. Like trying to keep myself from like, falling over. I can't look out into the crowd. I, my vision's just going so in and out. I'm like, if I just get through this, I have three days off before my next show, I'll just rest. Mm. I didn't sleep for those entire three days. Why? So then when I, I just, I couldn't sleep. Well what I said That To you, I just can't sleep. I'm glad you didn't remember it because it was a good piece of advice. But I did mean it when I said it to you because I'm being genuine. I've known you for so long. I've seen your career. It's been wonderful. You've been humble the whole time. You've been a gracious dude. You've worked through all sorts of bullshit.


A lot of up and downs from a perspective that America may not know. You know, I've seen you do the gambit. I've seen you run the gambit from a, from, from a, from a very low, low level that I saw you at when you first started and you were young. And I think what's wild is people think, well, this is what you asked for. But what I meant when I said that to you was because we're a little older. I've seen it before. And I was like, just don't let them run you into the ground. And of course, they ran you into the fucking ground. And I, we had heard, 'cause we know you're old team or, and all that stuff. And when you announced all that shit, I thought, you gotta be careful, dude, because they'll, they'll work you till you break. You're also allowed to say No. You're allowed to say no. I Know all the time. Know that at the time when you're used to having nothing and hearing No, no, no, no, no.


And then you're getting all yeses. Of course you don't know how to, when they're offering you, you're not Wrong. A Paycheck for one show. That's more than you've ever made in your entire life combined. Yeah. Yeah. Who in their right mind knows how to turn that down. No. I I, dude, trust me. I told you I get it. And I said, go get your thing. But also you gotta be, you have to watch out for you because you will have an emotional breakdown. Of course, Theo's talked about it. We've talked to Theo about it. Had he called me just the other day to check In. He's had big heavy hits where he, it's tough sometimes if you're just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. You're, this is not, this is, this goes away. Oh yeah, bro. You lose your shit. The last year and a half I've been doing 40 to 50 shows a month. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's been, Do you, you owe the mafia a bunch of money. Yeah. What is Going on? Whatcha Doing a gambling Problem? I thought, I thought I could handle it.


I really, I really thought I could do. I'm, I promise you can't. I I, apparently I couldn't when I had to, I had to take these two weeks off from shows. It was fucking brutal. I, I never thought I was gonna have to do that, but I was just like, I cannot possibly fucking perform. Yeah. And it was because I was on a tour bus for nine months. Wow. So every day was Groundhog Day. Right. I would perform till two o'clock in the morning, stay awake till five or six, then try to go to bed, couldn't sleep. So I'd sleep till like 2:00 PM Wow. I'd stay on the bus, which was wrapped. So basically blacked out until like 4:00 PM just meetings, writing whatever. I'd go outside, I'd see the sunlight for like two minutes a day, walking to the gym and walking back. And then I'd do the shows and repeat. So when I had to come back here and take all these doctor's appointments, they were like, oh dude, on top of you have like severe insomnia and like really bad anxiety.


I don dunno, If. You've ever talked to anybody about this before? But it's not even that you have a bad circadian rhythm. You don't even have one at all. It's like, you know, when you have a baby, you have to like teach your baby when it's supposed to go to sleep. Like what nighttime is. Right. That's all based on sunlight. I never knew that. I knew sunlight was good for like vitamin D or whatever and good for like your immune system, but I had no idea it had to do with your sleep clock as much. So my body and brain had no idea when it was supposed to go to sleep. Ever. Wow. So I had to like those two weeks off, I had to like retrain my brain to like be like, okay, stick to some kind of loose schedule. Yeah. At least a little And new meds like That. Are you staying clean outside of that though? Do you don't, you're not a big drinker. Drug I don always drink. You don't do any of that stuff? I Don't really drink unless I'm like, I mean, maybe like, maybe four times a year.


I don't drink I stuff, But stay off of it. Because I, that's the, that's the one thing that I think gets people, you're on the road and you think, well I'll, I'll do this 'cause this'll help. Or I'll pop a pill or take a drink or smoke or, and it's, that's when it starts to spiral. Especially in your case when you're like just constant, constant, constant, constant. So it's good to stand Away from it also. But also, Matt, serious note, I'm gonna put on my serious hat. Okay. It's about longevity too, you know? Of course. You know. Well, that's the hard part. Him and I have been, we've been around for a long time. You know Him longer than me. How old are you since you Know? 40? He's 40. Yeah. I'm 52. Wow. But I've looked 40 since you met. I've been, I started when I was 23.


Oh my God. And since the nineties. All the way till now. And it's like, and there was a lot of opportunities I didn't get. And, and also I admit, I was never like the kind of what you got. You know what I mean? I never got What, what, what do you mean? Well, you were never What dude, do it dude. Well you're, You're being so Fucking rude right now. It makes me so fucking mad. You were never hot I don. That's that. Even what I'm fucking talking about right now. Dude, you were never hot. No Shit. That, that what I'm saying. No shit. You didn't get a phone call.


I ain't turned. Oh dude, you make me. So dude, you, you Haven't made me this mad since the early days, dude. Good dude. Then the fuck you dude, shut up. I'm at all you Fuck you Porky. God dang. God damn. This is So hot. Anyway. Yeah. You never got these opportunities, But You got said amazing What I'm saying. But you had amazing opportunities. I've, I've done a lot of great things in my career. You have. But what I'm saying is, is that I, I it's just, just know that you're always gonna work. I think the thing in our minds is like, if I don't do it now, right, it's gonna disappear. Of course it's not. Now it comes about in different forms. You might do See, see, Oh, you might do bigger things.


Right. Or you might, do, you know what I mean? There, there'll be a couple of slim years. But trust me, you will have, you'll come back and then you'll back. And that's what life is like. This like a Are you okay? No. Fuck dude. It's like this, you know? Yeah. Okay. The roller, the rollercoaster pack Go back and forth like this, the roll. This feels racist even. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. So that's what, you know, That's the inside of your grandfather clock. Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha. I need a drink. Some water. Hold on. You need to, yeah. You need to get your sleep schedule right 'cause it's healthy for you dude to I know. Get, Get back To square one. Then you get healthy physically and mentally.


'cause I think the mental thing is like, you're in the gym all the time, but that's not helping this thing. No, of course. Just 'cause you're getting in, staying in shape, it's not gonna help your brain. And A lot of people don't understand. It's like, okay, you get to this point, what is there to be anxious about? Like, you made it right. But it's like, okay, well how do you keep making it? Right? It's, it's, it's easy to have like a hot couple of years, but then you go, okay, the anxieties of like, okay, am I ever gonna have money to like support a family or anything like that? That's, that's cool, that's taken care of. But it's like, what's how hard this moment is right now? I go, fuck. Like what? What's the next 60 years long? Well, but who cares? I would say this. I'd say the one thing I would say is If, you are not enjoying it.


No matter what you acquire will never be worth it. That was the most part. Matter what you cons, no matter what come, if it's not fun anymore and it's just work to, for the prospective future of the hope that I'll be settled at some point. You're never gonna, you're gonna lose your mind and you'll get there and you'll be miserable as fuck. Absolutely. You'll have whatever you need and you'll go, fuck, this sucks. I don't even like this. Yeah. There, there would, there would definitely be times in doing, you know, 10 to 14 shows a week that I'm like, there was nothing that upset me more than whenever I would go, don don't feel like performing. It's like, dude, you have a theater full of fucking people right now. Yeah. But you would've killed to just have one of these shows like this ever in your lifetime. And you didn't feel like doing it.


'cause it just felt like Groundhog Day over and over again. So the be the best part was like having my friends around to remind me of that and make the entire experience as fun as humanly possible. How many people Do you take on the road? There's my videographer. My photographer. Two openers. Mm. Two people. Same two guys. Yeah. Hosting and a feature.
