No, they just, they're neighbors. Oh my God. That's an age Old story. And their and their couples are, are cheating.


Oh, they're, And they went to Japan. They took a trip to Japan. And so now these two are like in this, you know what I mean, like complex living next to each other. And they reenact, you know what I mean? How their, their spouses got together. So they would go through the dialogue and scenarios and stuff right there. And then through the process, they fall in love, but at the end they don't link up. And it's like, it's so sweet. It's like I have fantasies of like your pink butthole. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

Here's the interesting part of the movie. You never see their couples. Right. You see, you always see the backside of their back. Right. Or their voice. You never see them because it makes the audience not have any sympathy for them. Right. Right, right. And so you are only focused on these two.

And he's out with his friend, a friend at a bar or whatever.


And then while he's out with a friend, she flies to Singapore. His the new, the love, the unrequited love. Unrequited love. She smokes a cigarette. Does she know he's there? Yeah. She, she knows she's at her plate. She smokes a cigarette. Right. And then he kept one of her slippers, his slippers that he, you know what I mean? To remind, she takes the slippers and she just leaves. So he comes back and he looks at the cigarette and it, you know, there's lipstick on it. Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah. And he sees he can't find the slippers. So he knows she was there, but he never sees her again in, in the whole, in her, his whole life. Wow. What are you being real right now? That's Wow. That, that was a stunning, I mean, I'm seriously, and then Five years later, She died of Edema Goes No, No.


It should. Non-smoking. So Five years later, lemme finish it. Fi May I I mis you I knew you were gonna do that. I know. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. A can't review visited me in the hospital. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, Yeah. I have a cancel. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Go. So the last scene of the movie, right? Yes. Six years later, they, she goes back to the apartment building, but now she has a kid. We don't know who the kid's From. Not the same, not her ex-husband. It could Have been from her ex, ex-husband. We don't know. We don't know. Right. And she, she wanted to visit the lady that rented her to this place because she knew that she was leaving. And, and so from her apartment or from where she was, she can look into where his bedroom was outside.


Oh, yeah. He Just happens to visit, you know what I mean? And they see each other through the window on these opposite kind of apartments. Yeah. And he goes like, he kind of does this. And she goes, and she tears just start rolling down her eyes. But they don't link up. No. Oh. It's just in the mood for love, baby. And that's what I want. You're In the mood for Love. I, I'm in the mood for love, dude. And that's the kind of romance I want. No, you actually wanna be with someone. You Don't. No, no, no. I want, I, no, I like, like in Paris, Texas, I love movies where it doesn't work. Is this a metaphor for your life? Is that what you want? You don't want that. It Makes love more mysterious and like, I like, But it's infinitely sad.


I Know. But I like the longing. Like Dr. Avago, remember, he reaches her and, and then he die. I just love the longing. Yeah. I love the devastation. I like being out in my backyard by myself on the lawn chair like I do with a cigarette. And I long for love. That's a wish can be. That's such Say it Right. Say it right. Dude. In my mood. I'm in a good mood. I'm in a love mood. Say it right. Would you say when you're sitting on the lawn with your cigarette on your lawn chair, you're, it's more that you're shorting more so than longing. When you're on a lawn chair, your legs don't go to the bottom, do they?


They don't. That's so funny. How hard is it for you to lift the backup? Sometimes I can't even lift it. It's like I can't Yeah. Click, click. Yeah. I can't. Yeah. You're longing for love, but I think you deserve real love. I don't want, I want you. I don't Think it's real. Yes, it is. It's not. What do you mean It's not real? It's not real Love in general. I don't think it is. Well, There's different levels of love. I believe that we talked about this in the car ride. Being in love is a phrase, I think is conflated by society to be this, who know, who knows what that means. But you've loved, you've Love, you loved your exes. Those, that's all love. But then it ultimately never worked out. That's okay. That doesn't, because there's a longing. Love doesn't always a shorting. I mean, there was a shorting. There's A shorting. Yeah. The shorting with Bobby Lee.


I know, but I haven't met the mysterious one. But it's coming. It may. That's what I like about it. That's the longing. Yeah. Like, I met somebody, but she used to see somebody that we know. And that's tough. I Know. But did they date or they hooked up? They Dated. Oh. And in my mind, I'm like, that's exactly what I would want to do. She doesn't like me, but that's the kind of da girl I Want. How do you know she doesn't like you? I can just tell, but just everything about her in terms of what, what I heard her say her, her vibe, her everything. God, I want to know who it is. So. Bad. I can't tell You. Not on the air. You can, I'll never tell you. Really? Yeah, because it's the long, it's the shorting dude. This is the Yeah. I'm the mood for love right now, dude. And it's like, it's a, it's a shorting situation.


And it's like, you cannot know this sometimes when you're at an airport too, or I, yeah. Many times this's happened mean fi five or six times in my life where a girl will walk by, she'll lock eyes with you and she'll smile and she's beautiful and I'll smile. Right. And there's an instant, and you'll never see them again. That's awesome. It's so beautiful. I had a girl today. I went and opened my suitcase to get my charger out right behind me. And I looked up and she was gorgeous. Yeah. And I just politely gave her a smile. Yeah. Just politely. Like one of these. Did she smile and she went like this? No, that's not good. No, It wasn't good. Looked up. Yeah. Yeah. Looked up and away. I've Got a million of those. I was just, yeah. Yeah. Those I'm used to. But I wasn't even Smile because I had, I'm, I'm awkwardly unzipping in the tarmac tunnel.


Yeah. And so I'm like, sorry, like a sorry face. Like, sorry. And she looked away as if peasant pig To me, they don't even pretend to, like, they, they'll look at me and they go like, completely not a shot. Right. And you're like, okay, relax. She, I was just looking, you know? Yeah. She gave me that look. Like, hurry up, you fucking potato, eat white piece Of shit pink. Fuck. I mean, she was gorgeous. And she just looked down on me. So I know. So obviously I was such a little pig. Yeah. By the way, shout out to Mohamed, who works at the Detroit Airport, big fan of the show. He goes, will you please shout out me out on the podcast? I said, no, but I'm gonna, he goes, Muhammad, it's easy to remember I said this most common name in the world. Of course I'll remember Ham Let me Guess Muslim.


Huh? Muslim, Puerto Rican. Wow. Yeah. Tony would've hated this guy. Yeah. Tony Would keep that in it. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. He now, he But my therapist, soul, my therapist said Thursday to me, she goes, I go, well, you know, the girls that I like don't like me. And she goes, but you do the same to them. Like, what do you mean? Mm. You know what she means? What do you think? I mean, Because you probably, you probably like the wrong girls. Okay. Continue. There's many women, I believe, who probably come and entered your life in different fashions, and they're probably pretty right for you.


Yeah. But you want the other one. You want the one that's probably not, there's A danger. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's also like, you know, I do the, like, you know, some girls look at me, oh, he's short. You know what I mean? Pudgy this and that. No. And I do the same to them too, physically. She's short and pudgy. Yeah. And so I go, I don't like it. You know what I mean? So my point is, is that there was this one girl I met, and, and she was prepared, you know, good, you know, more than average, I guess. But she does things like, you know, you can see like her feeding the homeless. And she's like, you know, there was this old man that lost his wife, and she visited this old man every day for like a year. What a nice Person. And I played chess with him. And You don't like this girl? No. I mean, I, to me it's like, I was like boring.


Oh. You know what I mean? No time for fucking, you know what I mean? No, but my point is, is that in my mind, I'm like, this is what I should be going for. Right. But you know, what you are going for is what You, you know, all that shit, you know, ladies And gentlemen, diamond coming to the stage, You know, you know what I mean? All that. And it's like, they don't help the homeless. You're Looking for you. What, what you're chasing after is Angelina Jolie, Billy Bob Thornton. That's, Yeah, that's, That's exactly what I'm, That's what you want going for, dude. But we don't want that. Yeah. That's not Feasible. It's not fe It is feasible. It's not, it's not gonna be a long term, but you might not have a lot of time left.


That's what I'm Saying. Right. So let's find real love. No, no, no. Why don't we just do the, why don't we just do the mood for love and just be in this, it's Better to burn out, fade away industry. It's better to burn out than to fade away. I would rather dream, I think. All Right. It's like, it's like this business. It's like, I may, I may never reach the levels that I've wanted to reach. You're there, but I'm not, where Do you wanna be? Everywhere and Visa. Yeah. I wanna be like, everywhere Visa. I wanna be like Visa. But I wanna, I want, you know, it's that dream of like, anything could happen at any time, but it never happens. But you're kind of always dreaming. But you're in it right now. Don't you realize that you're gonna look back in 20 years and go, oh my God. I was in it. I was making a podcast with my best friend. Yeah. It was one of the largest podcasts in the world.


Like, you're in it, it's great. We're here. Okay. So now find real love. Someone that respects you, enjoys you, appreciates you. Really doesn't take advantage of you. That's up to, that's up to the Gods right now. I think you can help some of it. I can't. Your therapist and I are saying the same thing. I can't, What am I echoing what your therapist said. Yeah. So then next, next week, I'm gonna come here with a three foot five, four oh pound Samoan girl. Well, that fits named Cuckoo. If the shoe fits. And I'm like, I did it Bobby. I have to shit Again. Yeah, yeah. I did what you said. All Right. Cucko, go. Shit. That's not gonna happen. The Key's against the Wall anyway. And, and if your name is Cuckoo and 300 pounds and four foot, whatever, whatever. I'm not, no offense. Can you imagine that woman just slamming, slamming her food to the ground as she listens to our show? Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck. Like a double pineapple pizza.


She's just like, B you mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I mean, you know, but when, when you watch a movie, like In the Mood for Love, you know, there's another movie I saw recently. Amelie is, is the same kinda love, but they get together, they end up together in the moped. That's The old style. You end up together. Yeah. Yeah. But when they, you know, when you, when you, if you watch a movie like Amelie, it's that whole tease. You love the tease. You don't miss the tease. I'm sure you do. Yeah. But, but, but also the game that you have to play right now seems exhausting. It's so exhausting. It seems Like it's such a, it's so Hard. What a game. It's A game of death.

Yeah. How many do you have? Three. Are they, are they special? Were they like branded for you? Well, They're not like made by a sensei, but I've got 'em in Chinatown. So they're made, probably made by, they're pretty sharp. Probably made in China. Yeah. They're sharp. I mean, they're not the ones that they used to like Ronan or Samurai used to use back in the day. Right. Those are like real, You know what I mean? How is it Samurai expensive? Yeah. I wanna know. I wanna buy one is like A real one. A real samurai. Like what's The most expensive samurai sword you can get? Oh my God. Well, it's probably, it's gotta be priceless.


I mean, what is that? 79.99? No, the most expensive dude. That's the kind of shit I have. Average First. Yeah, the average one is a couple hundred dollars most expensive samurai sword in the world. The most expensive Japanese sword in the world is Kushima. Mansor. Sam Hitachi priced at a hundred million. Yeah. Can We go and meet in the middle there? I mean, what the fuck? From $5 to a hundred million. You want ta or not? I know I want ta, but there's no way I can get one a Hundred million. Look at how beautiful that is. Yeah. How about like, this a $10,000 samurai store. Do that. That's a lot of money for I know, but That seems like a right, the right price for a a, a high end one. Oh, lemme look at that one. That sounds like a good prize. $1,200. Yeah.


That sounds, I mean, yeah, because you're Never gonna use it. But this sounds like you're going to the swords of Norths Shire. Yeah, I get one of those. I guess we gotta buy a Shin gto. Saddo Araki or Any Bad Friends fans that are into metal work. If you can make one first and You can make a really good samurai sword, we'll promote it. Of course I will. We'll put we Yeah. We'll, we'll hang it. No, I want, no, I'm gonna hang it in my house. Well, We want it for the show. We'll get to that. We'll Do it any, no, anyone. That's because we know there's gotta be a, a guy out there that knows how to do metal guarantee it. Guarantee one. I Guarantee it. Like A real authentic Japanese samurai. So, and I want you also, I like the engraving into the steel. Yeah. They like stamp it like a symbol.


Yes. You know what I mean? Yeah. What is that? It's a samurai sword that's Back here. How much is it? I Don't know. Where the fuck did that come from? Which did That come from? It's been in the back. I saw it one day when I Let Me see it. Lemme see it. Come here. Bring it over here. Wait. Seriously? Yeah, there's Like a real sword. How long have we had this? Wow, Dude. Three years Rudy days. Ru, someone gave it to Rudy for sure. Yeah. It's not sharp at All. You're not even flicking your finger. It's nothing. Oh, there it is. Yeah. Nothing. I can hear it. Yeah, It's Not sharp at all. Wow. It's nothing. It Makes it even more dangerous. Why? Because Dell blades are more dangerous than sharp Ones. Why is that? 'cause you're more likely to cut someone. Lemme see. Really? That sounds so fucking stupid. Then why wouldn't every samurai sword? Bedu? Yeah. Yeah. Why do people, why samurais in movies are constantly sharpening their swords?


Why would I sharpen any of my fucking knives then? Yes. Dull knives are more dangerous than sharp knives. Dull knives require more force to cut. Increases the chance of knife slipping and causing injury. A dull knife, you have less control over the blade's direction. For example, when cutting a cantaloupe, this is talking about kitchen knives. Yeah. Dude, That's swords generally More likely to bounce. This is like nerd staff. This is, this is, yeah. A real sharp samurai sword. They don't make a dull fucking sword. No. Sam, imagine, imagine the samurai's go out and they come back and the master's like, how did you perform? Yeah. Yeah. Who Did you kill? Let me. Let me. I'll be the samurai. You'll Be the samurai. How did you perform? How many you kill? I injured four people.


But you kill them, man. Chop. I injured four people. What do inju mean? One man, I gave a light beard trim to, Okay. Okay. But what about to ho the one that I told you to cookie? Yes. I tried to, what happened to, I tried to kill him, but yeah. Yeah. What ended up happening? Yeah. Tell me. I ended up giving him a massage with a sword. Oh, You, what do you mean? I was stabbing him in the back. When he die, he said to the left, to the right Oh, he to the left. Like a spa massage kind of. Oh my God. I then, yeah, it made me wash his feet after. Yeah. It was Now, when I told you to get the sword, you got the sharp sold on it.


Did you go to the About that blacksmith. I told you to go to blacksmith About that. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me. I read somewhere on the internet that that dull so is more dangerous. Oh. Did sensei Macon tell you that? Hit the dumb. Wow. Wow, dude. Unbelievable. Wow. Wow. Yeah. This is not sharp at all. This is actually oddly dull. Getting stabbed or cut. Worst literal way to die. Die. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. I, no, not really Stabbed to death. No stabbed. Burning is probably, you probably lose sensation after a little bit. I'd rather get stabbed to death than die buried alive in a coffin. I'm talking about someone doing harm, setting you on fire, drowning you, stabbing you shooting, stabbing, drowning, setting your apart.


Why can't be bear alive. Be a part of the equation. That's A long play. What do you mean? It's a long play. And also Bear Alive wouldn't hurt that much. You'd die of carbon dioxide poisoning. You Would die. But the the, you would just fall asleep. Asleep. 24 hours of panic though. I think you'd only panic for like 10 and then you'd be done 10 Minutes. 10 hours. Yeah. That's Insane. I know. But Then just sweating, you're scratching at the, there's no way to, but then Think about all the relief of the shit you don't have to do anymore. Or, you know what, I, at The 10th hour, you're like, I guess I don't have to do the podcast today. I, I Think Uma Thurman And Punch through. Yeah. Oh wow. But you'd asleep. Asleep. So rather be, oh. So I feel like we've talked about this before, like how would we want to die? Have we, I don't know. That's like basic 1 0 1 podcast.


You know what I mean? Scenario. Really? Yeah. Probably like, how would you wanna die?

I wanted to watch the movie. The guy was not helping any manager because he was making like dumb com comments. I said like, oh, like you're not every woman or something like that.


Whoa. He was thrown in. You're not a real woman. Yeah. Wow. That's where you go though, when you're in a fight with maybe E even worse, he was recording it.

No, the Black guy. The black Guy. Was the trans person still on their phone? Were they still on the phone? That would've been so funny to still be on the phone during the fight. I Remember one of 'em was saying like, oh, like, fuck you. That's your free speech. That was one of the comments. Interesting. And they start, the black office starts getting exited out and he says, okay, sir, to one of them. Why did the black guy get exited out? And the other people did not inter interesting move a MC.
