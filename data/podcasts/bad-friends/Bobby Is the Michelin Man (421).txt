How Come you didn't connect with this guy from high school from 25 years ago? We don't fucking know each other. We didn't, we didn't fucking, I don't know anybody went to high school. I know three people from high school. 'cause you weren't friends with certain kinds of people in high school.


That's true. That's true. Let me, can I ask you another question? Another question that's Sure. I kept without anger. I kept it right for I kept it. Sorry. Many white, Right? Many. How many, how many Koreans were at your school in high school? I don't even fucking know that. That's right. A pretty a a good amount. You didn't know there were more black. There were more black and Indian. He didn't know because he didn't like them. Well, I definitely, There are 62,000 Korean in Chicago Metro. Its nothing he would've Never known. 62 grand is nothing. Yeah, That's right. It's like an anomaly. So if there was a unicorn on my fucking wrestling team, I would know the unicorn trunk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That Trump dude, If there was a unicorn, I know It. There's three unicorn. You know what I mean? Unicorn. I know the one unicorn. Yeah. That's what I'm Saying. I used to be friends with unicorns.


They're the greatest of corns. So if there was, if you have one Korean on your fucking basketball, how many Koreans play basketball? Almost none. It's like having ZocDoc play fucking badminton. You know what I mean? I wouldn't know if ZocDoc played badminton. If you also played with him. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Maybe that's to my point is the one Korean of all of Illinois played basketball. You would put that ingrained in your mind. He's not even Korean. That's the worst part about he is Korean. No, he is not. What is he? He's half. That's right. Well, The other half, What's the other half? God Knows. And that's why You don't know him. I get it. Yeah. I, Doug, if you're listening, He's not. Yeah. Yes. He's producing minority too. Okay.


Anyway, Doug, good to meet you. And maybe we can do some work Together. Yeah. Doug, how come you didn't reach out to me, buddy? You come to my fucking city. You don't reach out to me. I know it's Power Dynamics, but we, let's move on. What's Power Dynamics? Oh gosh. You keep saying I'll, I'll tell you what, that's something you take pride in. You really like power. I love it.

If I have to teach you things, I must teach you things. Yeah, go ahead. How about Power Dynamics? I was in Dallas a a week ago. Remember? I do. Right. I went to a 12 step meeting. It's a local, You know, afterwards, You know, people smoke outside.


Right? And I go, Hey, you guys want a fellowship? That's what we do. So we all went to a Denny's, me and these local AA people. There's Nothing else Open. Yeah. There wasn't. It was late. Right. And then I got the bill and they were all like, Hey dude, there's eight of us. I go, I know Power Dynamics. And we don't know that. I go, yeah. It's like I had to give him this example. If I, It's like when you take eight other addicts to a Denny's after Being At aa And you Saying, Could You listen to my point? That's what it is. So if I go out to eat with David Spade, I have never paid. Yeah. Right. It's just the Power Dynamics of the situation. See that? That's foolish. It's not foolish. I pay, I pay was paid.


Well, every time I offer he says no. I just get the, I just hand her my card before he get, before he can. Okay. Well that's, you are ruining the Power Dynamics then. No, you're Equal. So you don't understand. I believe in equal pay pay The concept of I believe Power Dynamics Equal pay. Equal pay. You believe in me? Equal pay. Equal pay. Alright. So if I'm gonna do it too, do it. All right. So, oh, okay. Well, McCone after this, let's go to Mastros. And you pay for the bill. He can now he can afford it. No, you can't. Yeah, you can. You can, Would you be able to afford $500 to pay for all three of us? I could. It would. It would be A damn a damn. But you would be, there would be a thing in your mind like, why am I paying? Exactly. But you have to learn. No, it's not about learning, dude.

We Could talk about Giza too. About the Giza. About Gaza? Yeah. No, Giza. Huh? The Giza pyramid. Oh, the Giza Pyramid. You know what happened, right? No, what happened? Wait, wait. You don't know what happened, what Happened in Giza?


Do you guys know what happened? No. Are you fucking outta your minds dude? Google It. Get what happened in Giza. The, the pyramids. Did they fall? No, dude. But they found a Oh, the under. Yeah, the under the under this. Okay. I don't know if it's fucking true. It is true. What Is this vast Underground City was found below Egypt's Giza Pyramids. Look at the pillars. Surprise, surprise. Look at The pillars though, Because they look like nine 11. No, look at the pillars there. Twin Tower pillars. Alright, so what they discovered. But, so look, zoom into that photo. There's two mile long these fucking tubes that go down with these spiral staircases that go down into other compartments.


Two miles down. Two miles. Two miles down. Dude, Google that two mile. Go to the article so I can read. Well, it's in kilometers. I don't know the, the oh Two kilometers. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. How many miles down is that spec? Okay. Speculating. An entire city buried under the great pyramids of Giza, speculating. Right. Okay. A team of Italian. And Scott is scientists. I'm out. No, no. Okay. Zoom back up to, to that it Has to be a city underneath the key. God. I mean, come on. No, that's very Funny. The Italians, you're Very good at accents. So this is what they discovered. Holy shit. Okay. What is that? And it's a, it's, they, they have technology where they have, You know, infrared technology, where they can scan things.


And this is what they're scanning. The technology is legit. Okay. Go to the article, please. Okay. Just so we can see this. This is incredible. If this is real, this is wild. It's incredible. And Italian and Scotty scientists have unveiled the shocking results of the research about the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. 45, a hundred year old, one of the world team claims that there's an entire city buried underneath the pyramids. An entire city. Mm. Wow. Yeah. Experimental research. The ATE project, and let's see here, 3D images go down a little bit. You can see Wow. How they built stairs around the pillars, huh? Yeah. 3D model was created, but these Tubes are the most interesting part. 420 miles above the wait. The team relied on two satellites, four 20 miles in outer space to come down.


Go down. I wanna see how far down they go. Underground. Look at that thing. 6,500 feet across. They, they go down approximately 2100 feet. How much is that? 2100 feet is just under like a half a mile. Okay. I was wrong. F You Know, half a mile is long. Dude, it's Pretty good. Half a mile is so long. Yeah, it's so long. That's so fucking deep. Okay. So 2000 feet underground is insane. Right. And then below that though, are these other Buildings, Dr. Zahi Haas, a prominent archeologist. He's my favorite doctor, by the way. Well, you're not gonna like him. After this former minister of anti antiquities called out the research, said it was completely wrong and, and was fake news. He accused research. Yeah. I Don't like him. And it's methodology.


Yeah. Yeah. He said it's not correct. One guy. Yeah. One. I mean, Rogan talks about it and he's usually right. Is He? That's why I didn't believe Professor Lawrence Connor's a professional geo geophysical archeologist and ground penetrating radar expert dismiss the theory of vast city under the pyramids. It's just a huge exaggeration. Mm. So a lot of these guys are saying No. No. Okay. But however, I believe you. So if you tell me it's there, I believe it's there. Well, I've been doing a lot of researching on my own time. You You are. Yeah. And via through the internet. Right. Via the internet. Via the internet. And I've come to a conclusion. I I believe that it's half correct. At least.


Would You ever live in an Underground City? I have dreams about it. You do? Oh my God, I got it. I think about it all the time. Yeah. I, I have dreams about it. Like then the way that Goonies found that waterfall and the go. I wanted that so bad. Me too. What would you have down there? Oh my God. Oh, me too. So, Collection of so many fun things. Well, so I would just A wall of dildos to use whenever you need 'em, huh? Nah, It's, that's Not it. What I would do is if I had a CI would have one area where I, it would look like outside. Oh. So basic. It would look like above ground. You mean? Above ground? Like, so I would have like panels. Right. Like, You know, IMAX Tricking people into thinking they're, they're Thinking that it's outside. Absolute. Because I'm gonna have dogs down there.


Right. So I'll have my dogs down there. Can they survive? Yeah. Because it's gonna be vast. Okay. And a green gr grass. Oh, you can have grass underground. Yeah. How Do you grow it? There's soil down there. What about Light sunlight? Lucent uv. UV Lucent. That's exactly what I meant. Aluminum lesson. Yeah. Yeah. And it's A great band. Thank you. With the Illumina lessons. Yeah. It's very dark. Gothic Very gothic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then what also I would, yeah, I would also have like a steam room situation. Mm. I mean what? Yeah. Yeah. Can I ask You, why are, why are we doing this underground? It could be above ground. All this stuff could be above ground Because of my fantasies.


I did something wrong. Mm. Okay. Yeah. I did something wrong on earth. You're a man on the Run, right? I'm a man on the run, but I have billions of dollars in my fantasy. Oh. So I built this Underground City, much like l Lex Luthor in the original Superman movie. How Do You get people down there? How Do you convince people to go down there? No One goes down there. I down there alone. I have dogs down there. You're alone? Yeah. I have a llama, a dog. You know what I mean? Other things. What Do You gonna do about love and sex and relationships?

Yeah. So Fleischer, so Fleischer would be in the green room in the main room, and he'd have his cameras out, several cameras take fucking take photos of alien orbs or different ghostly orbs.


Whoa. And he would show me like, Hey, Lee, look, they always call me Lee. Look Lee Lee. Look, there's orbs in here. And we always thought it was a little unsavory. 'cause we're about to go Up. You're about to go on stage. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And Theleman would be, but He was really into that. Is He still around? Yeah. So he was a part of that. Oh, I feel so bad about this. Oh, he passed away. No, he's alive. He's Alive. No. Why did the fuck Did you say no? Yeah. He was a part of that group when Adam E took, took over and he did that fine. That fucking brutal. Like, You know what I mean? Clean house. Yeah. They'll spring cleaning. And he, no, but he, anyone over age, age is certain. It's, there's some that was like, You know what I mean? Like Argus and people that obviously They were people that were, we Couldn't, You know what I Mean?


Grandfathered in. Grandfathered in. But there was a host of them where he called and said, you guys don't call in. You're not gonna get spots. That's crazy. And it broke so many people's hearts. But I think as a, as a, You know what I mean, A booker, you have to do that. Well, That's why people are always hate bookers. Yeah. And producers, because they have to do all the grunt work. Yeah. You know, like these guys, they do all the grunt work and we hate 'em. Like, you have to be our filter of nose. I know. We had a conversation about it. Yeah. Yeah. So could we talk about adolescence real quick? I know you haven't seen it. I know you can, but I, I don't. Oh, incredible. You loved it. One shot I've Seen in years.


Each episode is one shot. I've heard this. I heard about the rehearsal process is Impressive. It's insane. The kid in it, my God. Incredible. Incredible. How Old is this young man? 13. 13. 14, 13. Yeah. Never done anything before. What The fuck were we doing at 13? I don't know. Oh, Steven Graham's in that I love, he's incredible. And you wrote it right, didn't he? He's a pro creator. Yeah. He's incredible. Brad Pitt produces it. Who's that? That's the kid. That's Brad Pitt. No, that's the kid Actor, Jamie. Wait, wait. Owen Cooper. Yep. This kid is incredible, but He's never done anything about this. Good for him. It's nice to get a break out the gate. So, just like us, that's what we had. Yeah. Each big breaks.


Each episode is literally one shot. And I, I don't think there's any cheats. I think it's one shot. They Do two takes. I heard. No, no, no. It's one shot. They do two takes. Two Takes a day for a week. So 10 10 shots. 10 takes. 10 takes. Yeah. So two shots a day. They do two shots. Right. They Do two episodes, Two takes two takes Two episodes a day, and they pick the best one. Two takes a day. No, no. Two takes a day Of the same episode. Of the same episode. Yeah. And they pick it. They Pick it. Yeah. Okay. So couldn't Do it one hour. That'd be insane. Oh, that means impossible. We Could do it. Yeah. Oh. So there's always like that one guy, 30 minutes into it. Who has two lines? If I was that guy, like hiding behind a wall, knowing I had to come around.


You See it? No Koreans in the show. It is true. Huh? I would be repeating my lines. You know what I mean? Because you Wouldn't welcome back to the hotel. Yeah. Welcome to the, yeah. Whatever that, back to the hotel. Welcome back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You make it funny because the wrong Missy. No. Yeah. You're doing the wrong Missy thing. Fuck You, dude. No, I'm not. What? Do You know why I'm just throwing out a line? Fuck. Fuck you dude. No, dude. I was throwing out a fucking line. I don't know what, what Missy thing. What are you saying? What are you talking about? Fucking Marcello did that too. Hernandez two weeks ago. I Love that kid. He's like, You've been in movies. I Oh, they great job on wrong, Missy. Is that what he said? Welcome to the hotel. So fuck you. Fuck. What's his problem? Your problem. Anyway, so welcome To the hotel, miss.


Is my, Okay. It's enough. But here's, but here's what I want people to know going, I'm not gonna tell you what the premise of the thing people basically know. No. We know what the premise is. I mean, it's on the in. But, You know, when I first saw it, because I had knew nothing about it. I thought it was a, who done it Like a murder mystery. Yes. Right. Right. And with that lens, it's, it doesn't work with that lens. Right. But then when you look at it for what it is, it's brilliant. See, it's interesting. 'cause now there's a lot of murder mysteries are back now. Mm. Like the Shonda Rhimes show is very popular. People, it's like clue meets knives out. Right? Yeah.


Or whatever. Yeah. That's, but dude, those things are hits. That's what we need to make. We need to make a Who done it? A Bad Friends Whodunit. Yeah. That'll be fun. That that's what we need to do. Because honestly, how much fun would it be if, You know, if McCone was dead? Carlos, I, I, I would've, I was gonna go to him first. But it's too easy. Mm. Because I want, You know what I mean? Suspect. Yeah. Yeah. He's suspect. And also, you need him in, he need to be a shady character throughout that you can keep tagging and going, this guy could have done it. Because look, look at the, look at the lifestyle. He's living The ride. Look what He's up to. Wait. So he's gotta be a guy that we suspect people Suspect. Suspect. A hundred percent. Yeah. He's a big throughout. Who does it at the end, though?


That's interesting. Who does it at the end? Jules? Yeah. What, who? Jules is too predictable. Too predictable. Too predictable. McCone. No, you don't have the balls. And that's what we'll say. You're the one that's dead. Yeah. How can you kill yourself? Yeah. Oh, you, oh, that's the who done it. Hey, at the end of all, he just killed himself. Guys. That's By The way, Fred is come to come down like, fuck, what a Huge letdown. Its the Biggest letdown ever. That would be like the worst M night Shalon spin of all time. He's, he's got a, a rope around his head. And you're like, who's doing it? He's just sitting there jerking off. Like, oh, Chokes Himself Out. Okay. Alright. So this is what you need though, in this, right? It can't just be us. We have to have like maybe 20 people flowing down A Cast of people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To come and go. Yeah. And then I don't know who does it.


I would think that maybe, Jesse, You think Jet Ski would do it? She, I, she's a tough sell for me. Mm. Like, she don't know if she has that evil flip. So Dax have to be in the mo show. Yeah. He's somebody that people are like, maybe, You know? But I think ultimately the biggest surprise would be you. I'm the murderer. Yeah. Now that lines up. You and I can't be the murderer. It seems too obvious that one of us is the murderer. Bringing your brother Steve. Andreas. Andreas also doesn't have the balls. He Doesn't have the balls. He's a big talker. Small walker. I have the Resentment Though. So, so, yeah. Yeah. You the, well, that's why you're a good suspect. That's, that's how these things work. You're a good, yeah. Yeah. You're a good suspect. You know, like George, George would be the one of a prime suspect for being a murderer.


Yeah. Well, I couldn't have a murder, You know? I mean, I know Like, yeah. Yeah. Any police investigator would be like, well, this guy fucking did it. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. It would have to be someone like Andrea wife. Oh my God. I know who did it. Okay. Turn around. Oh my God. My Mom. Bobby's mom. That would be the biggest shock. I think you're right. That would be the biggest shock. It's Just you see me in a room with a knife. Yeah. And then I remove my own skin to reveal. Yeah. I'm bobbylee mom. Yeah. Underneath. That's funny. And that's her line. She pulls off. She goes, I'm Bobbylee mom. And she's, I'm Bobbylee mom. I'm Bobbylee mom. Done. Right. But there's no motive.


None. Like, why would she, she kill Mcco. She doesn't even know Macone exists. It doesn't matter. She just gets right back on her iPad. Oh, wow. Wow. That's it. Yeah. And that Wow. But that's that kind of movie I like, maybe Yeah. Leave it up to the audience to figure out why. Yeah. What's the purpose? Yeah. What's the depth of this? And I, and I, I discover it, You know? I discover it at the end. Yeah. And I have a, You know, really fucking seen and, You know. Ooh, you're emotional. I like that. Dude. That was good. I didn't do it. It do it again. Do it. I'm not doing it. Sorry. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing It. Please Do it. I'm not in the mood. Please do it. And the line is welcome to the hotel. Okay, dude.


Okay. Now You dug me earlier. You dug me Well, you dug me earlier. Yeah. Yeah. I dug you earlier, not ing me. Yeah. All right. That's good. I deserved it. Thank you. Okay. So that's a good a who done it? I think we should do a Who done it? Murder mystery. Yeah. I really would love to. They are so fucking, We're a an a Nora too. Okay. And let me clear the air. Yeah. I actually didn't hate the movie. I just, I just need more, I need more spins. You need to spin me out more emotionally. Thrust me if you're gonna gimme a heartbreaking story. I love, I love being spinned around. Spin Me around baby. Yeah. Spin me. I wanted to see more. Also, the Armenians in the, in the movie aren't Aw, they're not even mean.


Oh. Have you ever met a fucking Armenian? Yeah. They were like, you've never met him. I'll take it to sushi right up the street. Yeah. It just was different. What Do you got back to?

Oh, this is not snow White. Oh, Okay. Mirror. Mirror on the wall. Do that. Yeah. And accent. Wow. Ebo stepmother. I think if Disney's gonna remake all those movies, they might as well do it with a, an Asian accent. Speaking of that, thank you for, for bringing it up. Don't bring that up. Yeah. Thank, thank you for bringing that. What? Speaking of that. Thank you there. No. Do you remember that a couple weeks ago we talked about Snow White? Yeah. And he said he was gonna make a certain amount of money. I don't remember it. Yeah, he did.


Who said It? Andreas. Oh, he did? I'll bet you a hundred dollars. He was wrong. I was right. How much money has it made so far? Well, we looked, this, the problem is it's only opening weekend, right? Yeah. It's, it did worse than Dumbo. It's not looking Good. What? I Know It's the worst opening weekend of any bobbylee. Bobbylee. Bobbylee Was scared. Time after, out after seeing the trailer and made me cut that portion of the other episode. No. Wait, wait. So that bed is Off? Wait, no. Yeah. Just because you cut the fucking portion of it doesn't mean that the bed is off. You Know? Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. You don't know. Wait a minute, right? I was there. We made a bet, dude. They called me. Wait a minute. Yeah. Ripped up the ticket. You made a bet. Yes. Then you called him and told him to remove something from the show. 'cause I saw a trailer in the movie theater.


And I go, oh my God. It might Be good. It might be good. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So you gonna look like a fool. I didn't recant it. Right. I didn't recant It. And you take it outta the episode. You know how Disney makes their trailers All magic ma majestic and magical. Did you make him take it outta the episode? Yes. Yes. Bets are off. You didn't stand by it publicly. So then the bet's off. That's crazy. You can't, you can't do that. And by the way, yeah, it was a hundred dollars. Yeah. Okay. You owe em 50 then. That's Right. That's right. You owe 50 if you mean You owe me something. Well, you Owe 50, you owe half. You owe me something. Okay. So It's only made, it's, it made 42 million. What? It had 80, 88 worldwide. And it's a $400 million movie. Which means what? Another, It's that 270. No, it's a $400 million film With, with advertisements, with advertise that all the money that's in it.


Yes. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. They said it. They said it's actually north of 400 million. So They have to make probably 700 million to some. Oh. They'd have to make close some money. Close to a billion for this to be like what they want. Lucrative. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it wasn and it was, I mean, I I I, they're difficult to do live actions based on Well Fucking Yeah. I mean, that's Also based on an, an IP that's already existed. Yeah. But you Don't think it's hard to do much. I think it's easy. It's why they Keep doing it. Well, it's easier to do. 'cause the scripts are already, I mean, the ideas are there, but, But what you can't do is change it, is what they try to do. And what do they try to change it into? I think the main reason is the, the, the two girls didn't like each other.


The two actresses. Isn't Gal Gado in that? Yeah. Yeah. She's Maleficent. Yeah. Yeah. And she's pro Israeli because she was on the Special Forces. Wait, wait, wait. Time out. Time out. What the fuck does that have to do with Snow White? It's Snow White in his eyes. Z Rachel Ziegler's Pro, You know, pro-Palestine. Oh, That's a real thing. I've Never heard this. Yeah. Yeah. And then, You know, obviously Gal Gado is Israel. Right? Of course. Right. So, but I don't think that, I think what it was, was a number of things Is Rachel Ziegler. Is she, she, what is she? She's Mexican. She's Mexican. Yeah. Yeah. So I gonna tell you something. Okay. There's a couple of other elements to it. Sure. And I think we can keep this in. Yeah. Okay. Because I'm very clear about It. I didn't know about the Israel Palestine part of it. Yeah.


So what, so what They hated working with each other, obviously. So the two things that they fucked up, they Didn't even wanna do a premiere with the two of them. It will always be Free Palestine. She writes May 20, that's May 17th 20. That's May, 2021. Yeah. Wow. That's a long time ago. But they shot This a long time ago. They shot this four years ago. No, it had to have been two years ago. Look at this. From August 12th. I love you all so much. August one, thank you for the love. And 120 million views on our trailer in just 24 hours. What a whirlwind. I'm in the thick of rehearsals for Romeo and Ju so I'm gonna get outta here. Bye for now. And always remember Free Palestine. She says Rachel Ziglar. That was August 12th. Okay. So, but I don't think that that was the main thing. There's two other elements.


One of Peter Dink, Peter Dinklage. He plays all the dwarfs. No, No. I said on a talk That's a good guess on a talk show. He said, I don't know which one was like, they're doing that Snow white again for these dwarves. You know? I mean, it's old thinking when it comes to the way people look at little people. Yeah. I think it's bullshit. Yada, yada, yada. Disney took him seriously. So they made the dwarves just six, You know, average. And we talked about this. Yeah. Yeah. We already talked about, right. Those are not the, they made in all, all Cgi. No, it's all CGI Now after That. So that, no, those, those, those leaks weren't real. Yeah. Those leaks are part, they're a group of bandits in the movie. And Oh, they are unreal dwarf in them.


Okay. We just saw an image of it two things ago. There're there, they're right there. They're all CGI. Yeah. They're CGI. They looked, I heard the CGI is not good. Not great. Right. And then also Rachel Ziegler's comments about, You know, it's not the fifties, You know what I mean? So we don't need a Prince Charming. 'cause women can, You know what I mean? You know what I mean? What what can they do? They can't be president. I'll tell you that. I, I know. But they can, they don't need a Prince Charming to help them in their quest. To to save them. Yeah. To save them. Yeah. And so what's the premise of this film? I haven't seen it. No, I'm serious. What's, it's Basically the same movie. It's just she fights, there's Some controversies in it that I think balked it down.


But here's my curiosity Ly it's her, the comments outside the movie. But it can't be the fucking Palestine Israel shit, because people over, the people in fucking China that would see this, don't give a fuck. They don't care. That's what I'm saying, the, like, the bi the billions that would be earned in other parts of the world don't concern themselves with that. You know what I mean? So it's gotta be something else. It's gotta be the buzz, the buzzword. Well, the duas to see it scared kids. That does look a little Creepy. Yeah. That some of the kids were scared from it. Yeah. And then they're supposed to be like, likable. You know what I mean? Lovable. Oh, oh, that, that df on the left. I know him. That's Not good. Who is it? That is not good. No, no, no. Seriously. I know him. That df on the left. Yeah. He's, who, who's the on the left? He's got some charges pending against him.


Oh, I see. That's probably what did this. Yeah. And th and the, and then the third or fourth controversy is people's argument. Well, how can Rachel Ziegler be the prettiest one in that world if Gal Gado is hotter? Is that what people say? Yeah. Interesting. You were saying that Gal Gado is prettier. So it doesn't make any sense. But I don't, that could be, that's another Trump thing people are saying. If you say, people are saying, and they, people Are saying Ziglar didn't do it for them. Did Gal does it? So the movie, what do we think this thing is gonna, is gonna cost them? And she's doing Romeo and Juliet now. Yeah. Maybe Best Romeo and Juliet. They ever made DiCaprio Leo. It was the best, the best. The soundtrack was, by the way, incredible. I had this fucking cd.
