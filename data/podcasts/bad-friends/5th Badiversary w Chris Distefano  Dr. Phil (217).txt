Mm. Honestly, one of the saddest things I've ever seen this, I recently, I just got back yesterday, I'm sitting at a table. I was like, I'm gonna gamble before I go to this gig. And I'm, I'm sitting at the table and this guy was so blacked out and I mean, like, couldn't really, he was barely there. And I'm seeing him, I'm looking at his chip stack and I'm like, oh my God, dude, he's got thousand dollars chips, right? And then he's got, he's got, the casino gives you credits, right? So they're throwing him $25,000 chip credits when he runs outta, because he's run, he's running money. He's just betting. He's not, he's smoking, he's laughing. And he goes, who's the new guy? To me? I go, Hey, I'm Andrew. I love This Guy. He goes, he goes, Hey, I'm Chuck. I'm Chuck man. And he's smoking, he's hitting on the wrong stuff. And then at some point I said to the pit boss, I go, I gotta be honest with you, I think it was a little unfair.


And he was like, what do you mean? I go, this guy's betting $10,000 hands. Right? And he's doubling down. He's splitting them all. And he's losing four, I'm watching lose 40 grand, 80 grand. I'm not kidding. Within let's just say 10 minutes. Let's say 10 minutes, quarter of a million bucks out the window. Wow. Wow. And he stepped, stood up, went and smoked. And I go, you're gonna cut that guy off right in the pit. Pit. Boss goes, we're familiar with him. He's gonna be able to keep playing. Wow. Oh my God. I was like, Are you just robbing this guy? Oh, wow. You're literally robbing this guy. Oh, I saw a guy blackout in the Tropicana. RIP got knocked down for a baseball stadium to the Jesus Most and Holy Ghost. But he, he was throwing his roulette chips across the casino. No, no, it was dice. He was doing crafts through his dice. Blackout. Like, imagine like, just being like, look, what if you were like, Try with mock a child.


Right. And the kid was like, do you have a quarter for the wishing? Well, you were like, yeah. And you had it, and then you go fucking suck your own dick and you tossed it. That's the way he was throwing the dice. And the, the the, the security went and got the dice, I swear to God. And put it back in his hand. Oh yeah. And I remember being like, he's, he doesn't know where he is. And they were like, yeah, but he, he's, he wants to double down.
