Yeah. But you know What? That's A thing. It's an opportunity. I'm happy. Yeah. I'm happy we're gonna be able to do it. But guess what guy? I've been think I've been going to therapy and I've been thinking a lot about it. A lot about it. And I'm on, if, if I look at my phone, what does it say? This is it. This is it. Strokes that. Yeah. That's a good album. It's a great album. I know, but this is you and me together, sitting here with my, our Pals. Oh, I know what happened and what you like saw one of those David Foster Wallace things and now you're fucking hung on. Like, This is Water. I know what's going on. Everybody goes through this.


You're having like a David Foster Wallace moment where you're like, two fish are swimming in the ocean and one is like, what's water? It's like you're in it, man. You have to be one with water. I know You're Bruce Lee. Yeah. Bruce Lee. Dude, dude want to can flow between, Do you know what I'm referring David Foster Wallace? Like every college kid reads this book. Yeah. It's actually beautiful. Well, tell me some of the concepts and I'll agree With that. Infinite jest. But there's a, there's a look up David Foster Wallace. This is Water. Look up. This is Water. It's actually beautiful. Okay. But you're on this kick and I really, I'm, I shouldn't shit on it. I love you, but it's incredible. This is Water is amazing.


Okay. Have you read it? I have Infinite jest. Pretty, pretty amazing. This is Water. Gimme just gimme the gist of the book. The idea is this. Yeah. Oh, this is it. There it is. There are these two young fish swimming along. They happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way. Wait, Wait, wait. Hold on. Okay. No, no. I just, there are Two young a fish. No, that's not what I'm Saying. I don know. Okay. I gotta Visualize it. So, Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And there's Two fish there. Two. And there's a older fish Coming. This two young fish swimming along. Does it matter what kind or One is one is a carp and the other one is a, what are Those fucking nema ones or whatever? Goldfish. No. And the one with the clownfish. Clownfish. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Two clownfish baby, baby ones, two Baby clownfish are swimming along And a great white's going.


And they happen to meet a Great white, great white's going the other way. Going The other way. Okay. Who nods at them and says, morning boys, how's the Water? That's not what he sounds like. It's a great white morning, Boys. Yeah. That's what it, How's the water? Yeah, Exactly. And the two young fish, the two young clownfish, they swim for a bit and eventually one of them looks at the other one and goes, what the hell is water? In this moment, you're worried. I plan to present myself as the wise old fish explaining what water is to young fish. Please don't be, I'm not the old wise fish. The immediate point of the fish story is that the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that we are hardest to see and talk about. What it is, is we're taking, not taking stuff for granted. What it says on your phone is what? This is What?


I don't get the analogy. I swear to God I don't, you know, I'm not good with riddles either, so I don't know. This Is it. This is Water. You're lit. We're, when someone, you'll look back in 20 years or 10 maybe. I don't know how long you're gonna make it, But, You know, And you know What? That, that kind of, That right there is I go a white house by myself. You didn't feel bad about it. I knew it. I knew it. You're a fucking piece of shit. Thank you. You be dead in 10 years. Thank You. Anyway, with you and me. Two young fish are swimming along in the ocean. Yeah. One takes a giant shit and a beautiful female fish comes by. Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Yeah. Alright, listen. Okay. You're, this is it. This is it. I'm being in, in all genuine respect because I love you and I respect you. 'cause a lot of times you go, you go, You're in the moment, you're living the moment.


Tell You, a lot of times you go, oh, well, we're doing this Hulu show. It comes down to when that happens, it's gonna be great. And Right. You have to live in it now. Yeah. I mean, when I meet the one that, when that happens, it's like, this is it. This is it. You know what I mean? We're, I am living life now. Where the leads of our movie, This is Water. This is Water. Seriously, I get it. I Understand. This is Water. Yeah. This is Water. You Have to be one with, you know. No, Bruce Lee. Okay. I get it. Okay. But This is Water. He dead on Bruce slate. Dude, Do it again. Then You have to be one with water. What? He got peanut butter in your mouth. What he doing? Yeah. Yeah. He loved peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. That that's what killed him. That is that true? Yeah. Yeah. Bruce Lee died from P bj. I know, I know. I don't know. But, But I'm happy that you're on this new kick. What made you do this therapy Got you to this. This is, this is it?


Yes. Bruce Lee incorporated peanut butter into his diet, particularly as a component of protein. It's like, oh, I would, I didn't have to look it up. Bruce Lee was highly against Jelly, however. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Doesn't say that on there. But my point is, is this Okay. Well, you know, I, I, I went, Bobby, You look a lot like Bruce Lee. I wanted to tell you that. You know, that's what he's gonna Say. Right? A hundred percent. Oh my God. My son Baron said, you, you're a wonderful, funny guy. I think you're a very funny guy. I love Mad tv. I love Mad. Wow. Wow.

No. He'd go and I won, didn't I? I won. I'd Go. Yes, sir. You good job. You have to bow. I would do it. I would be a bitch. You would a hundred percent. I Would tremble. I would shake I, yeah. Yeah. Your excellency. Yeah. Yeah. No, but This is Water. I'm glad you're going through this in therapy. Well, it's because I, you know, I went through some depression and then I was like, I gotta get out of this and then just go, go back to my techniques of, you know, being grounded and in reality, because a lot of things you read on the internet or the things that occur in your mind aren't real. That's incredible though. Yeah. You do feel this way. That you're getting to a place where you're accepting reality. I feel great. You feel really good. I feel so good. And I appreciate That.
