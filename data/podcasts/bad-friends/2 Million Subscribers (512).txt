And they were like, and I, they heard that I wanted to be a part of it, right? So they go show up to this warehouse. 'cause there was an industrial zone in Poway. Right. You know what I mean? So my mom dropped me off there and I went there and they weren't there.


And I walked home crying. Okay? And then a couple of months later, the same crew goes, yo, we're so sorry about that. Go to Tommy Huddleston's, Tom, I forgot his last name, but party tonight. It was a Friday. And I showed up. There was no party. And it wasn't even his I address. It's not funny at all, dude. I know. It's fucking horrible. Right? And then I cried again. Yeah.

When did I learn about the cake? When you walked in? I Walk in. Okay. Yeah. I had nothing to do with it. I know, but how am I getting roped Into this? Because you texted him to pop out of the fucking, Because I knew he was in it. That's how I know you think I'm blind. Time out. Wait, Wait. You think that I'm like you. When, when he Was, When he was in there, you texted him come pop Out out.
