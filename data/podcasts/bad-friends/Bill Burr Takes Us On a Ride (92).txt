Was I was watching this World series of poker and this guy fucking goes all in and you know, when they go all in, they start walking around like, here comes the river. And it was like, he had a 98% chance of don don't know poker, but he, and then all of a sudden the flop came, and then it fucking went down to like 7%. But he didn't know. And then the last thing hit and he fucking lost.


And the guy literally just, he literally just goes, ah, yeah. And he fucking just stormed off and sat. There was this little two step thing to where the crowd was. He sat down on those stairs and he put his hand like that. And he cried for like 15 seconds. Yeah. And then he just collected himself and was like, all right. And just moved on. It was like, it, it was unbelievable. After. Wow. How much money was It, do you think? Millions. Yeah. It was like Serious. And, and, and he got totally, there was no way, what do they call it, a bad beat. There was no fucking way. He should have lost it. And he did. And he went, ah, yeah. We sat down the for like 15 seconds. You're not, you're not, you're not a gambler, are you? Nah, I just don't, I I don't, I don't have the patience for it.


And I just also, I just, I get it. I get it. You're, you're winning and I'm losing. Like, why, why would I do this? But We get our dopamine hits from other things. What do you get your dopamine hits from? What's your, what About learning new shit? That's, and what it really is, it's not a dopamine thing. It, it staves off my depression. Mm. So that's what I've learned. Like, I stay out of the, I when I get free time. Nothing makes me sadder than free time. Yeah. And just sitting there thinking about life shit that happened. Me all, it just makes me sad. So I'll literally like, you know, you know, the usual bullshit. Go to the gyms, play drums or something like that. But learn learning something new because I don't know what I'm doing. And I have to like, listen to that makes me not think about other shit.


Can you give us some new shit that you've learned? Give us some new shit. I'll tell you, I wrote a, i, I wrote a fucking Harley Davison Road Glide the other day up in Santa Maria. And I've never ridden one. I was always intimidated 'cause it was so fucking big. I'd ridden smaller ones. Yeah. And it was one of the fucking, do you remember in Ferris Blis Day off when they were going over the hill? Yeah. Yeah. The Ferrari. It was like the val The valets, right? Yeah, yeah, Yeah. So like, we rode through the hills and everything and first of all, it's a fucking, the scariest thing is going slow on 'em and stopping. 'cause it's like, oh my God, is this thing gonna tip over once you get going? They just, it's a Cadillac And. they had that big, what they call it, the fairing. So you weren't, you know, your neck doesn't hurt. You just cruising. So you took us up into the mountains and there was literally nobody on the road.


We went down one street and there was all of these trees just on one side. And the trees were curling over. Like, he was surfing in like a tube except you were on a bike. Right. Wow. Wow. It was amazing. And then we came out of the valley and me and Dean Delrey, we switched bike. I got on this, the Sports Glide he got on mine and then the guy took us through and then they knew I was comfortable And they started tearing down the fucking, like the valley, the mountains are coming up like that. Wow. So, you know, I kicked it up two, three times, whatever. So I thought I was doing like fucking 55, 60. And I looked down, I was doing 90. Wow. Oh shit. And I was just Woo. Wow. Dude. That, that, yeah. That was, that was like, you know, the adrenaline thing to the heart. That was, that lasted like a week. Wow. I, I couldn't stop fucking thinking about it.


And Do you have a bike? Yeah, I have a, I got a little one. I got a little royal infield. Can I tell you guys what? So, But don don't drive around an LA street. Can I tell you guys what I learned? Or Can I, can you not? Can you? Well, I had something I learned. You talked The whole show Learned something. He learned something. I learned. Listen, let let Asian Bobby Kelly say something. Forget it, you know? No, No. I won. Hear hear In a supportive environment. Go ahead. Alright, so I'm gonna tell you, I mean, so Star New Valley, right? It's the video game I play. See already, dude and don don't like that because it's Not entertaining. Go ahead. Why Don't just tell you something I learned, you know, I've been playing that game for years, right? Yeah.


So you can go to Robin's carpenter shop and actually move the greenhouse. It, it doesn't have, 'cause you know, I've always built around the greenhouse, like, oh my God, there's not enough space. But you actually can move it like next to your house. Is this, that one of those games where you, you're building a village and then you fight other villages. There's No fighting in that way, bill. So, nice try. But my, no, I'm just asking you, it sounded, sounded interesting to me. Yeah, yeah. No, It's, And I understand that response because I've done nothing but give you shit for 20 years. Then You think, thank you. I Get it. So it's like, it's, no, it's, it's a farming game. Is it? It's more exciting than the giant melons Bill. Would you get one of those big bikes? Would you ever want to invest in one of those big Harleys or no?


100%. So this is the next move. It was. Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna do the Gingered Wild Hogs. Well, Pull me please. Totally. Please pull me in the, the totally the midlife crisis. No, it was one of those things just like, you know, I just feel as an American, it some point you have to ride one of the bike of those big, those big bikes. Just do it one, even If, you just do it one fucking time. It was, it was like, I would never ride, like, I don't ride around here. Like, I'm always in like the middle of nowhere. Like, you know. And when Colorado, we, we went up in Boulder, went to the Rockies a little bit, and it's just, just stay away from people. But like, I had a bike out here for about six weeks, about 10 years ago.


And the level of texting, it was like, everybody was like, had like three beers in 'em. So there was just all of this drifting. And it was, it was fucking terrifying. So I remember, like, I never pray, but I literally, I was all the way out in somewhere on the, near the beaches or whatever. And I said a prayer. I said, God If, you get me home. I swear to God I am never riding this again. And I'm gonna sell it. And I did. And then I, I fucked up like an addict. I rode one when I was in, I was in Austin and the Moto GP race was there. That's the formula one of bike racing. I fucking love that shit. And. they had this thing on Saturday where like the dads, you know, all the dads could go there.


And. they called it the victory lap. And I had not ridden a bike in like, 10 years. So I said, I, I think I want to be in the back. I want it. 'cause it was like, I felt like it was a hundred guys there. I was like, I I wanna be in the back. I wanna be in the back. 'cause I don't wanna be going fast or anything. And. they said, no, dude, you wanna be in the front. You wanna be in the front. Because we're gonna be going like 25, 30 miles an hour. 40 maybe on a straightaway. But those guys in the back, they wait. They wait like two minutes. Oh, And, they wait. And then those guys, you know, the guys get the full fucking leathers on. So I said, all I could. So anyway, I did that and I was so thrilled that I still remembered how to do it. And then it, it just, it just, it's back. It just, yeah. The itch. Itch. Have you ever ridden a, a bike? Have you ever Never have. Oh my God. But I've ridden like a bike. A bike?
