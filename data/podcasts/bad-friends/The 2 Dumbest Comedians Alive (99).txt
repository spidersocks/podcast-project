But then that gives you the green light to go with to other dude, girls. No, I probably won't. Whatever you want. Okay. I discussed, I discussed this. It's Not a Freudian, it's not f rium. F rium slip. Okay, go ahead. This is why, like, I was just talking to someone about this the other day. Might have been my daughter's. My daughter's asked my body count the other day.


What is your body? Count six this year? No, my whole life. Holy six. Your whole life. Yeah. My whole life. Oh my, you're like a Christian dude. You're, you're like a Mormon or something. This is insane. Six I, don Dunno who I was just telling this to, but like, I, I definitely, the problem is, wow. I was just ba I was, I was not, the first time I did it, it was really bad. Who was I just telling this to? And I, it was really bad. And so after that, like, just, I, I didn't perform well. I came fast. I, my dick wasn't even her inner, it was between her butt cheek and the bed. Mm. And then it was like, it was such a nightmare that I was so, like, I remember getting into the bathroom after it was done looking in the mirror.


Whoa. And so it was so humiliating. And then even like, my next two times were so still just, I wasn't good at it. And I thought I'd be good at it. It's like saying like, it's like, it's like being like, you're Good, you're good. No, I'm, now I've gotten better. Yeah. Yeah. But I was not, but Are you sure? I'm sure. No, because that's what Leanne says. No, No, no. Now I'm good. Yeah. But Leanne could be lying to you. You could. Oh, she probably is. Then. You're not good. No. Yeah. Maybe I'm not. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm telling you, you're not good. It's The reason, like, people that don't, I wanna say you're not good. People that don't sing karaoke. Yeah. Yeah. Karaoke for a reason. Yeah. So I don't fuck other people for the same reason. People don't sing karaoke. Do you lock eyes? Dude? I was, Okay. No. Tell me about the, I, I like, I, I didn't even talk during the sex.


Like, I was silent. Like Helen Keller, You'd moan liquor her, I'd greet, I'd freak out. Just, and then someone would Come and go, that's not, that's not good. Bread. Bread. Yeah. Fill the air. Bouncing off my hand, Helen. Yeah. Wow. You know, I wanna learn. There should be a statistic. Right. And I, I don't know if this is a fact. I don't think they have a statistic for this, but I believe that for fat Asian guys in America, right. I think I have the biggest body count. Oh, what's your body count? I can't tell you what Whatcha are talking about. When did you start keeping secrets? Me and your open fucking books. Bobby. Okay. I don't, I, I, I don't know.


You Like ballpark? I, I literally don't Know. You had to ballpark it. Like, let's just ballpark it in Asian countries. Okay. Are you China, where it's like so big can wrap your head around it? No. No. No. Okay. You are, you Japan, you're just, well, You can't compare it with a Chinese guy in China because it's like, I, I feel like it's easier. What do you mean? Oh, Like if I was a Chinese guy in China, it'd be easier to get growth. My point is, is, but coming to America, being a fat Asian guy and getting white chicks and Mexican, all this other harder, that's fucking key. It's challenging. That's really difficult. And I feel like I have the highest body count. I think it's easier when you pay though. Wait, are you talking about your Body count? I, so you know what, I'm, I'm trying to come here with positivity, dude. Right. And that your little jokes, dude.


Right. I'm gonna let them slide today. I wish I had paid for sex. You've Never done it? No. Okay. I wish I had Why? I look back and I go, I'm bummed. I never did. Yeah. don don't know. It's better to Have You know when you get free roaming. What's the same reason? What Free roaming. You know what I mean? Like in the wild. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's the challenge. It's more challenging. It's like, you know, paying for sex is like, you know, killing a cow at a barn. You know what I mean? Like, he's enclosed and trapped. It's easier. Well, Yeah, obviously. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if there's cows in the wild. I think the, I think say I. don know. I think the analogy is shooting fish in a barrel. Not killing thousand Dogs. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. I think it's, you can't Just apply any Fucking, I tried to come up with my own analogy.


It's like hunting horses. All you need is an apple and a gun. Alright. Is Oh yeah. Fish in the barrel. Fish in the barrel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wish I had had paper sex. The same reason that I'm glad I went skydiving. Like I'd never do it again. But I'm glad I had the experience once to go Sky. Yeah. I would never do that. You would never go skydiving? No, no. Bungee jumping. I would do it with Henry Cavel. Oh, Superman. Yeah. I think his name's Kail. Whatever. And I, I wanna say this too. I I don wanna be controversial right now. Oh, I'd love to hear this. Yeah. Yeah. But not only I, I think he's the best superman of all time. Oh, hold on. I don on Can't. I don't. No, no, No. There's No way to argue it, Ben. There's no way to argue Henry Cabell, who's better.


Ben Flack is better than Henry Cabell. He's Batman. Oh. Oh, you're right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. He's Batman. He's, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. I mean, Wait, was Henry Cavel Superman when Benna Fleck was Batman? Yeah. They fought each. Oh, okay. Henry Cave's the best. Superman. Yeah. They fought Against each Other. That was my favorite. Superman. What? When they fought against each Other. When they fought against each other. That Was too long. And Con con con convoluted. And then Su Wonder Woman showed up and Aquaman was sitting in the war. Aquaman was not in, that was in the Justice League. Aquaman in the flesh were not in that movie because I just re-watched them in fucking in Montana. 'cause I had nothing to do. I watched all I Want. I went from Christopher Reeves all the way through. Okay. Pull up all the Superman real quick. All right. Right Here. So what I'm, I'm, I honestly believe I can rank them and let's just do film.


I don't wanna do tv. Nick Cage was Superman. There was, he was supposed to be. Oh, okay. And, and in one of the Superman movies, he was in it or something. Right. He's in, in The Flash. They do a little, a little montage at the end where they showed him. Right. You know, multiverse, like, oh yeah. Multiverse kind of a, but, so I think that it's goes he Henry Caval, then it goes to Christopher Reeves, then it goes Brandon Ruth. Oh, I would, I would put Kirk Allen in there, which You don't know Kirk Allen. Oh No. George Reeves, of course. George Reeves. I mean George Reeves. Oh, George Reeves. Yeah. George Reeves is the one I remember the most. Oh, that's the old school. 50 ones. Dean Kain. Dean Kain. Looks like a kind of guy that votes Republican now, doesn't he? Yeah. Yeah. Like, he's got some real Jon. He actually look at him.


Yeah. Yeah. But what do you think? I think I, I heavy cave's My best Batman? No, no. What's your best, best Batman? My best Batman. Yeah. Yeah. Benna Fleck. I'm a big Bene Fleck fan. The only reason I ever get sober if Ben Fleck called him, said you wanted be my spend sponsor. You met him. No, I've never met him. I love that guy. Wait, wait, wait. You would get sober. Only if Bene Fleck asked you to. If he'd, If he called me up right now. And he was like, yo, it is bene fleck. I would love to be your sponsor. Get you into sobriety. I'd be like, fuck yes. Okay. Lemme throw. So how about Anthony Hopkins? No. For, for being sober or for Badman? Yeah. Anthony Hopkins would be a Bad one. Alright. What about, so, no, I'm gonna Brad Pitt? No, He's the only one. Benna Fleck.


That's, I think I, I get him, I get his, I feel like I, I feel like I, I like him. I like him. You know, you Know why, why? He doesn't hide his emotions. Right. And I don't, When he is walking outta the fucking limos with, with J-Lo normally as a guy, we would be like, all right, there's gonna be people there. Smile like, oh yeah. He's just so draw drawn. Like, I hate it. Yeah. don don't care what people, I don't care what people think. And he's smart as shit. Oh, he's so smart. Really Smart. He's so smart. Smart dude. I saw him on Bill Maher's, what's it called? Real Time. Real time. Real Time. And he fucking lit that dude up. Yeah. About the, yeah. Him and Matt Damon are two of the smarter dudes that, they're So smart. They're Movie Stars. They're so smart.

Ro Rogan and Burr are the two guys that could ra somebody in like a conversation. Who are the dumbest? Me and you? By far? By far, By far. Stop talking. Okay. Let's talk about Gaza. Don don't know. Well, I, I don't know where it is, but my point is, is it's gotta be near, it's gotta be near Israel. It's gotta be, can I tell you, I, I really believe that Gaza is like Yeah, yeah. Is like, is like Sunset Boulevard? Yeah. Like it's a road. Yeah. Is Gaza a road? Yeah, it is. Right? What do you guys don't know either? Do you? It's a strip. It doesn't have roads anymore. Wait, is it a strip? Yeah. Like is it like the Vegas strip?


Yeah. Or the did people, like for the bachelorette party, they go to the Gaza Strip? I don't follow any of it. Yeah. Yeah. I remember the first time Andrew brought up Gaza. I didn't know what it was. So he goes, what do you think a Gaza, you know what I said to him? I go, AZA. And he goes, what do you mean? He goes, I go, that's backwards. That guys are backwards. Right. That's all I can, that's all I know. Wait, don't, don't, don't bring this don don't talk about this. So, no, but here's, here's Wait. I'm just prove I'm No I don. No. I wanna prove too dumb as comedian. No, no, no. There are other pe I, I can, I can throw Theo, Theo all of a sudden got smart. don don't know when the fuck that happened. But he doesn't, if you watch his interviews, he doesn't. Yeah. He pretends to be, I mean, yeah, man. You know what I mean? You can't say Yeah, man, after someone says something's smart.


How would you have interviewed Donald Trump? I, I, I, that's a, that's a weird approach. I don't know. I wouldn't, when I saw him do it, I wouldn't done it. What? I wouldn't have done it. I don't think I would've done, I got invited to the national, that Republican convention, and I wanted to go just to get fucking wasted. Mm. And just have fun. Mm. And my wife wouldn't let me go. She's like, you will get caught into some conversation like Billy Bush and be like, yeah. Grabbing the pussy. Yeah. I just, you know, I hate that we're like that in this country. I thought you were talking about, we're still talking about me and you. Oh, me and you were like that. If you go to the fucking National Republican con conation Con Conversations. Conversations. No, Wait. But here's the thing is Right. I, no, no. I could shut my mouth.


Bull. Yeah. I could shut my mouth. I can shut my mouth. I know how to shut my mouth. Oh, you think that I'm, when I go on the, the set of sex in the city, and I'm with Sarah Jessica Parker, that I start mopping out about pussy. You know what I mean? Like, what kind of badge do you have? I would never do that. You know, I, I, I, I say to myself, shut the fuck Up. Okay. Get the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Do you know the smart people don't have that inner dialogue where they go shut the fuck up. They don't, don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. It's Not that we're dumb. It's not that we're dumb. We, we just don't have that little thing in our brain. Oh, Yeah. don don't. But That's not being dumb. Do you know, every time We Would be in the Paralympics, not the Special Olympics. I take that. Yeah. And the Paralympics is just people that are like, physically there's something, you know, going on.


Yeah. Right. But our minds are normal. Can I tell you the only thing I drew from the Paralympics? Do you know the reporters are para reporters? They've gone too far. No. It's para reporters. Yeah. The other reporters don't have arms either. Yeah. Did you know that? No. I've been watching the Paralympics. Really? That's insane. No, no. It's, it's, it's appropriation. If they have like Bryant Gumball doing, all You have to do is this, are you paraplegic too, as a reporter? I'd be like, yeah, man, what's up? You can't ask someone what their illness is. Oh, really? That's a Oh, then You can't, then you can go, yeah. My toes are missing. Yeah. If you go like, so wait, what's your thing? You can't go. You gotta go. I, I choose not to tell you. Really? Ba you're invading my body. Oh, that's Cool. Yeah. So then anyone can be a reporter at the Paralympics.


Technically. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just lie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's interest. Or just bump into a wall. Well, is It the same with Special Olympics? That's what it's Same thing with Special Olympics. don. Don't think so. See, this is, this is where my brains going. Shut the fuck up bird. Shut the fuck Up. That's so interesting. I didn't know that, huh? Yeah. But it's like, don't we think that's gone too far now? No. 'cause that's, that's the whole thing is that the, listen, let's be honest. Let's fuck real. If you're watching, if you're watching the fucking 100, the 100 sprints and Noah Wiley's there. Yeah. And. they got a guy with no legs doing the interview. You're gonna be like, this is awkward. This is really, couldn't you guys have thought about if a guy's like, Hey, you ran really fast and Noah Wiley's like Yeah.


To you. Like, I run, run really fast to you, but like to everyone else, I'm just really fast. Wow. But to you, I'm like, mind blowing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Are there reporters that have limbs missing in the regular Olympics interviewing? No. Why would they? Because That's, that's, that's not fair. No, it's not. Okay. It's not fair. That's why they give him the jobs for the Paralympics. Because here's the deal. You are gonna, if they show a guy with no arm interviewing an ice skater, you are not gonna listen to the interview. They're gonna, you're gonna go, what happened to his arm? Especially when his little shirt flat moves. All right. And it's gonna distract you. And I'm just telling you I'm being real. That's Why they don't, you know, it's it losing an arm. It depends on where you lose it. Do they just let women on the sidelines to interview football players?


Like when do you think they're gonna like it's a fucking, can you imagine? Would, Would you rather have your arm mis here? Oh, Fuck yeah. Or right here. Dude. It's a, it's a game changer. I, I've known a lot of guys without arms. I, I Don't want To hear. I know so many people. 'cause you have that little piece sticking out like that. don don't like that. No. No. Well, you know, that's not why you don't want it. Why? I just don't want a little, you know, little thing sticking out like this. Right. I would do it here. That's not why, why? That's not why you don't want it. Why, why, why? Because this is a lot more usable. This thing. Oh, this part. You want more, the more of the limb you can salvage. Okay. The better. So what's the worst here? This is the easiest. It's, that's the best. If you use your hand, that's the best. Okay. Or, okay. Oh my God. don don't, don Don't don don't want see photo I.


don know what Before. Yeah. Yeah. We can imagine it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We Probably, it's this. Yeah. Right. It's this. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. You say this is ba the best situation. Yes. This right here is second best. Second best. And then here, If you lose it here, you're, it's tough. Yeah. It's really tough. But a lot of dudes, so I know, I know. Probably four guys and a girl that have lost, they lost their, their use of their arm just hangs there like a dead arm. Yeah. And. they get it cut off. 'cause it causes so many And. they like burn it on stuff. And. they bump it in and slam it into doors. Mm. And so they gotta get 'em taken off. Wow. I know a girl that did that. God, I wish I remembered her name. She was really cool young lady. She got into a moped accident in college.


Mm. And broke her arm and then got in another moped accident and broke it again and never got used of her arm back. Mm. Interesting. That's What, what you don't Want. What Do you think about get getting attacked by animals like a shark at all? Wait, wait, stop. You're going, coming at me so quickly. What? Because we went from amputees to sharks. I think about I know, I know. Also, you, you know, the connection is losing the, it's just like, It's just like a fun day on the beach. Fun day in the beach. All of a sudden you don't Have You, just don't go that quick to the, to sharks. Okay. Let's segue better. I'll, I'll do it better. Okay. Right, right. So, hey, do you Like the beach? But how you gotta bring this into it? Do you like The beach? Oh, I love the beach. I was just recently at a beach, dude. I saw one guy armed the guy swimming in circles. Hey, are you afraid of sharks?


That's it. There we go. That's it. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and my answer to, did You see the guy with no arms swimming in the Olympics? No. Can you pull that up? Okay. He's Asian. You're gonna love this Bobby. Oh, whoa. He's Asian. Yeah. And no arms. And the only reason he's winning the whole time. Yeah. The only reason he loses is he doesn't have fucking arms. That's the only reason why he loses. That's the only reason he loses. Yeah. Because the other guy goes like this. Yeah. Knows it's, it's Asian Paralympics. And I, I I I want to throw another thing that about this guy Here. That's it. That's it. Oh, maybe. But Before you play it though, I wanna just say one last thing. Look at this. Look at This Bobby. I know. Well just gimme, let me tell you one last thing. Bur alright. Is what's also sucks about his situation. He can't even use his dick to help him To swim.


Yeah. It's like a rudder. Yeah. But it's so Oh, oh, I see what you're saying. Cut that joke out. That didn't WII, oh, I, I, I paused the whole flow of it. Just do a small dick joke. Right. And it came out weird. So go ahead. So Watch this. Watch him, watch him, watch him. This. He's just look at this. Oh My God. Look at him. Right. He's, he's looking throughs him breathing. No, him breathing. But the only reason, the only reason the other guy wins is 'cause he's got fucking arms. He's gotta hit the wall with his head, But with the arms. What does he have? He has what's missing? It's, It's, you can't ask. Oh, so you could be racist. You could be Okay. What? The only reason that, but Ga was second That Ukrainian guy won is 'cause the Chinese.


That's Chinese, right? Yeah. Look at this blind guy's Still. The ga G's second. Yeah. The Chinese took second Chinese guy. That's good. No, but if he had one arm, just one arm, he would've won. Yeah. That's life. If I was six foot three, I'd be ying. Come on. Yeah. You know what I mean? Well, not really seven foot. If I was seven foot, I'd be, Wait, hold on. Isn't he Chinese? Yeah. You get what I'm saying? No. Jeremy Lynn. Yeah. If I had Jeremy Lynn, And If, I had a bigger dick, I'd be Shaquille O'Neal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about something that, 'cause I want to get the facts right. Shoot. And you know, as people know I was injured on your tour. Oh God. Yeah. Okay.


Let's get, let's get it. Let's, let's, Well, I just wanna, because I just wanna do some investigating here. No, I love your investigative reporting. Thank you so much. I'm a big fan.

And, and I've, I've never, I never expected it. And I also was like, why would they do that? But Leanne calls me and she goes, and by the way, the dates you missed, were still gonna pay you for those. Yeah. Which is, I mean, I'm not gonna get, I I was emotional when I got that because it's like, it's, that's not like I, it's whatever. I would never even thought about it. Right. But it's just the idea that you're just that cool that you guys would just do that. Which is, and it's not chump change. It's, it's a nice chunk of money. You know what I mean? And so it's like, for me, I, you know, you know, I have to under, I have to admit, you and Tom over the years have been real friends and allies to me and Andrew and our family and this and that.


And it's just a real blessing. It's hard to give you compliments to be honest with you. Real. Yeah. I'm right now I'm just wanted to say something negative, but I'm trying to get into staying in the zone. But no, you guys are really just really great guys. And I appreciate it. Thanks Bobby. No, really nice Thank you. I'll tell you, I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why we honor the money. 'cause when Georgia was four, she fell and broke her jaw, knocked out all her teeth in a pair of Crocs. And I got the pulled, I got pulled off a tour because I had to fly home. It was a Sunday night and it wasn't a ton of money. It was like we were making $5,000 a weekend. We were doing probably five shows. So maybe it was like a thousand dollars. Mm. And I got, I flew home. I missed a Sunday show. And, they docked me a thousand dollars. And I remember being so fucking mad.


Well, You did clubs. Yeah. When I did clubs. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, I was like, wait, I didn't, I didn't bail on you. My daughter got hurt. And. they were like, yeah, but you didn't do the show. So we get to keep the money. And I fucking was livid. You're not gonna tell me what club it is. It wasn't the club, it was the fucking, it was Jameson. Jameson. It was Jameson. I Irish whiskey to, and it fucking, it sent me through the roof. And I still have a, a grudge about that. And so when we did, and when we did fully loaded first year we did Mississippi and, and it got rained out brand in Mississippi. And I And, they said, you know, well, we'll see if we can get everyone back. I said, well, we gotta pay everyone first. And. they were like, hold on, we, we can't afford to pay them it, it'll really fuck our budget up. Mm. And I was like, yeah, but we can't stiff them. And so we reached out to everyone. I think I I I, you'd have to ask the individual comics, but I think we gave them half the money and then bought them a gift bag to send them and then said, Hey, we hope that you'll come back.


We'll honor the, the hope. We'll come back and do it and we'll honor the rest of the money. But if you can't, we'll just pay you the money. And so people that didn't, we paid them the money and then everyone came back. But I got, I remember getting fucked by that. And I, that bothered me so much. So I'm Thank you very much at the first meeting. You just say, no, really nice. I love you, dude. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. I love you more than, okay. Okay. I love you more than you love me.

So that if they're gonna do an accent, if they're gonna do a, a role like that, yeah. They want to go to someone who they knows funny And, they know also can tell them that's not cool. Like, you know, like they, they wrote it. It's a bunch of dude from Philly that wrote something fucking wildly funny. Yeah. And, they wanna trust, they, they trust only funny people to do it. So they they're going to you because they you're friend. I Know, but, but I know, but I guarantee you that whatever they wrote is funny as fuck. I bet it is. Yeah. And it, and it, and it overwhelms the whatever Asian accent thing you're thinking, I'm probably gonna do it. I guarantee you it's I Would do it. I would do, I put the fuck teeth in. I don't care. It, I, I'll fucking do it. But You can also, but you can also just love those guys and, and root for them and go, I can't wait to watch it. Well, I wanna Read it first.


Lemme read it first. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, okay. I can't wait to see nine Philly guys write an Asian character's accent. I, that's, I know that's, that's the Challenge. That's, no, that's the viral moment is you do the show and the day it airs, you post the script where it's like whatever the, Yeah, yeah. I should. And since I talked about this, then I, I talked about it here. We're not gonna edit this out, right? No, don't, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me, can I, let me ask you another thing. Shoot. That I, I'm going through right now. Okay. And it's something I hate about myself, and I can't talk to Andrew about it because he doesn't really wanna listen to me. Okay. But I have a thing where, oh, okay. So when I was in Winnipeg with your friend Tom.


Yeah. We're doing a show Backstage. I don know, we talked about this, but have we talked about this? There was a guy backstage. He's a club owner in Winnipeg. I I know the club. You do? Yeah. Yeah. Nice guy. Seems like a very nice guy. But that's the club that Tom bombed in Horribly. Correct? I don't know. Yeah. Keep going. So anyway, Tom goes, Hey, this is Guy, you know, he's owned the, the club for years. Yeah. And immediately, I, I, I go, how come you never booked me? Why Would you say that? What? That's why. That's the thing. Yeah. You can't say that. Why? Because, doesn't matter. It Does matter. But why? I'll tell you why. Okay. Keep going. There's all these clubs in America that I remember calling my agent because I had, even before podcasting, I did pretty good in my numbers.


Right. So I go Good Numbers. What? You've always done good Numbers. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm doing way better now, but, you know, but I, but, and And, they would go, And, they just don't want you. Right. It would make me mad because it's like, I wanna play it. I, it's, I wanna go to that city and play it, and then look at their lineups. I go, I have more credits. Whatever. It would just build, I would build a resentment. Right. So then, now that I see these club owners, now I'm kind of like, weird. Yeah. And I don't wanna be like that, but it's like, am I the one that's that's in the wrong? Yeah, you are. I'll tell you why. I'll tell why. Tell me why. Teach me. So what happens when you get famous or when you get success in comedy? Yeah. Is you all those little fucking thorns in your side that wouldn't work with you and didn't wanna fuck with you, and didn't want to talk to you and maybe sometimes didn't even know you didn't even know you existed.


Mm. You, you, when you first get famous in comedy, or not famous, but get some success, there's an impulse. I've seen so many people do it to light those people up and let them know now you couldn't get me. Or something like that. Right. And, and when you, it's So, it's ugly. What you should say It's ugly. That guy, I'll tell you, I'll give you a perfect example of someone I love to death that I wanted to say that to. Okay. Who I wanted, I wanted to work Comedy works so bad. Denver. Denver So badly. I wanted to, I I can name a hundred of these clubs because I didn't have your career. I had like a bullshit career. Like, I had one where, like a great career. No, no. I worked on travel channel. No one ever thought I'd ever make money. No one ever thought I was ever gonna become successful or get a special on Netflix.


So like, there were a bunch of clubs that just the cool clubs would never work me. Would never fucking work me. That's interesting. And So I wanted to work Comedy works so bad, but I always worked at Denver Improv, which is predominantly a black room. one of the worst rooms. And it's one of the worst rooms in the world. I know. one of the worst. And so I fucking, I languished in the Denver, in the Denver improv doing, I, I never selling a ticket. And I wanted to work Comedy works so bad. And then I met Wendy and there was a part of me that wanted to say, why didn't you ever work me? And then Wendy just was like, you're fucking hilarious. Where Have You been. And I was like, oh my God. Right. God, I didn't say anything. Yeah. And then she's, anytime I ever stopped by Denver, she Oh, it was all in your head, dude.


I remember. I remember. It's not in your head. He didn't, she didn't book you? No. How about this? I'll give you a better one. I'll give you a better one. Okay. Yes, sir. Anne Harris and Joan Andreoni love them. Okay. They were the, the, the, I would say the king makers at Comedy Central. They gave you half hours. Yep. They gave you hours. Yeah. And I remember going like, I remember sending like audition tapes to them, and I didn't get a reply, no feedback, nothing. And then I was like, fuck, man.

You're not. You're not. I got, I got caught. Oh yeah, you did. I got caught in a lie. I don't, as I told someone, I was like, I'm, so, I'm packing up with my daughter. I can't do that today. And I was at the beach eating edibles and I just didn't wanna do it. Right. And I was like, I should be able to lie to you. Like old school, like in the forties. In the forties. Yeah. And no one calls me on it.

Yeah. Or between the two. Just Two fucking Yeah. Yeah. Two of our people just eating hot dogs against each other. Yeah. Wait, we're we're that close? Yeah. Keep Going. It's incredible how our, our co our world has changed in that way. Holy shit. It's so much more inclusive. Yeah. It's so much.

I I, no, I wouldn't say 20 years ago I would, but I say 25 years ago maybe, Maybe 40, whatever. Right?


But, you know, I'm in Montana and it's like, not only is there no racism, it's pretty inclusive. I mean, people are like hugging me and like, you know what I mean? Hey man, can I get a photo? I mean, maybe that has something to do with fame, Probably A little bit. You know what I mean? But Don don't think, I think here's the weird part is like, well, maybe don don't know, maybe you're walking around Montana as a Korean dude. People are like, who is he? Why is he in this neighborhood? Oh shit, it's bobbylee. No, because I went to, okay, I'm gonna tell you something that happened to me. Okay. Okay.

No, I go to maybe once a week. Okay. And I, and I went to a church way deep into the suburbs.


Oh fuck. That's the AA meeting I want to go to. And I was sitting and there were people in there with like, some people with oxygen tanks. That's how old they were. Yeah. Old white, Old, old school drinker All white. Fuck. Yeah. Like old school white, like, and as, as soon as I walked in, obviously everyone's 80 years old and super white and a little Asian guy comes in there And. they, you know, I turned heads. But as soon as I sat down, they're like, would you like some coffee And? they, you know, they put me some coffee and then they go, you know, is there anybody from outta town? I go, Bobby from la. And then they, you know, I shared. And then afterwards, What do you say? Like, you don't have to tell me exactly what you say, but like I'll Tell, I'll Tell you my share.

But what I say little things to let them know that I've been in the program. Oh, I thought you were gonna say, you say little things to let them know you're famous. No, I don't care about that. But it's more like, it's more like, yeah. You know, when Dr. Bob and Bill back in Akron, Ohio, you know what I mean? I try, I try to like, you know what I mean? Oh, That's Wild. Yeah. I said Dr. Silkworth, you know, when he talked about the psychic change and the doctor's opinion and the big book, like, I want to throw them some knowledge that I'm like, I'm sober.

Gene Simmons son comes up to me and I know Nick is friends with Tommy and he does his podcast. And Nick's really a cool kid. Mm. He comes up, he's like, dude, you're fucking hilarious. I was like, thanks. I know who he is. I was like, I'd love to get you on the podcast. I think Nick's cool as shit. And he was like, he was like, I'd love to introduce you to my dad. And I said, I'm good. And he went, what? I said, I'm good. I would not like to meet your dad. And he goes, excuse me. And he goes, he goes, my dad's a fan. And I was like, a buddy, I had a bad experience with your dad and I'd rather not meet him.


And I said, I wow. And I'm sorry that I'm doing this. Wow. Wow. But don don't wanna be around your dad. And he goes, well, my mom's with him. Hold on. So he brings his mom over. I think this was actually at my show. It sounds crazy. I think this was at my show at the forum. So Will you get the fucking story straight? So is it at the way, Because my parents were there. My parents were there. Well, that's Gotta be the fucking your Show. It had to be my show. So, so his wife comes over and she comes over and she's almost giggling. She's with Nick. And she goes, I heard my husband was a dick. And I said he was. She goes, yeah, let's bring him over. You tell him exactly what happened. And I went, no, no, no, no. I actually do not wanna be involved in this at All. Why At this point now it's, I'm so nervous. Okay. 'cause also he was a hero of mine.


Okay. And it is Gene fucking Simmons. And you, you Don't wanna double down on the hate. And I, and I don't wanna have this moment. I'd rather just never talk to him. Exactly. Okay. I was like, I was like, I'm cool. I've already hated him for fucking 25 years. Okay. Gene Simmons walks over with his son and his wife and he sits over and he goes, I hear that I was rude to you. And I said, yes. And he goes, please tell the story. And I went, okay. And so, in front of his wife and his son and him, I tell the story verbatim as if I was telling it to you and shitting on him on a podcast.
