That's another reason you're getting fired.


Carlos in the booth at gmail. Dot com. I have a side note question. If I may. You Always may Thank you. So I've been hiking. I have been hiking far. Can I ask? Go ahead. You hiked once? No, You hike many, many Times. Okay. And I've been eating the same, but I'm not losing any weight. What's going On? Let's talk about what you're eating. No, I'm eating the same. Eating The same. What? Bread? The whole bread. The whole time while you're hiking. Well, I've been like, You'll eat a loaf of bread while you hike. No, No, no. What I'm saying is I'm eating as much as I've have been eating. And That's the problem. Right. But then I'm like, well then I'll just incorporate long hikes every day.


You have to change the diet and exercise. It's both. It's not just one. So what you're saying to me is if I eat the same and no matter how much I exercise, I'm still gonna be fat. Lemme give you something that's gonna blow your mind. Most of the time it's all diet. It's all diet. Almost always. Then don't exercise. It's not gonna kill you to not, but it's gonna kill you. But it's not gonna Do anything. But If you keep eating at the same rate, it will kill you. Okay. But my wife's boss died at 93 years old. He never exercised a day in his life. It's all the what He ate. But, but he ate right? Mm Ate. He ate great. He just ate like healthy and that's It. So I tried to do the all meat thing. Very difficult. It's gross. Yeah. All just meat.


Just beef all day. Yeah. This gross. It's Pretty difficult. Your shits stink. They do stink. Yeah. And it gurgles my stomach. Yeah, you get gurgly. Burglar. Yeah. Yeah. You can't have that. I'm just trying different things. But it's like, you know. But I love the bread. Let's Do, let's do the diet of the blue zones. Like legumes. A lot of beans. Are you eating beans? No. You gotta eat beans. Why? Everybody in the blue zones eats them. Okay. The Blue zone diet. See a lot of these guys, it's, Well, gimme the blue zone. It's a lot of plant-based fruits, vegetables, beans, tofu, lentils, nuts, seeds, rich with disease fighting. Nutrients are the cornerstone of their diets. When they eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy, they treat it as a condiment rather than the feature. Well then Dane's wrong. Who's wrong? Dane. Who Is that? Cook? Cook. Oh, the cook is wrong. He Was like, you just eat I six months.


I've only been eating meat. Maybe it works for him. So I'm like, oh, should I do it? Yeah. Yeah. Trust me. Well, that's the problem. He's a cook, not a chef. You gotta listen to a chef. Oh no, he Dane Chef. Dane chef. Yeah. Yeah. Have. You met him. I've never met Dane chef. Oh, I know Dane chef. Well, I'll introduce you. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, that's the issue though. Okay. We should be eating more of that. Oh, okay. And treat meat like a side item. Not the main court. Not the main star. Mm. So have a little bit of meat but have a lot more of the other stuff. Okay. Well what's that Air one Granola. They have a Bunch of this stuff. No, I go to, I have Air One granola at home. What do you want me to do with it? Throw it away. Oh, I throw it away. Throw it Away. Why? Stuff's filled with sugar and bullshit. Throw that shit away. But can he Get like seeds and nuts and stuff from Air One?


So you, Here's the deal. Looks like it's cool. You wanna really set it up? Yeah. Go through a blue zone diet, like an actual grocery list and buy it for 'em and see if it works for a week. This is all I need me. And this is What me, Me. I need you forever. God bless. Yeah. But aside from you, okay, what I need is somebody to go, this is all you're eating today. Yes. Let's get you a let's. And I'm always like, I'll go. Okay, I'll just eat this. Right. But I don't know where to go for that. That's what he needs. We not a private chef. No, No, no. Not a chef, but just someone that know, that's a nutritionist. I think you'd help. I think we help change the diet. Yeah. It'll get us over the edge. Yeah. Don't you guys think so? I Think so. I think we get a little diet change. Okay.


And that's gonna be it. Yeah. Tell me, tell me what you ate today. Let's go through it. Oh, it's, I went to Kins. Kinic Chicken. Kinic Chicken. Or I'll show you. It's so good. It's called, It's have him bring it up. What is it called? Kin Wait, city Chicken. No, that's, I just, did they say city? I didn't say City Dog. Yeah. Kim's Here. It's called Kismet. Kismet. Kismet. Like a A romantic meetup. Yeah. Kismet chicken. Yeah. So good dude. Okay. Look at the, look at the, look At that. Yeah. Rotisserie chicken. Good for you. Yeah. So you had, what did you have though? So I had that, that meal. Did you eat the bread?


Yeah, I ordered two breads. Yeah, right. You don't, so let's stop that part. Just eat the chicken and the veg in your I know the bread is so good though. I'm sure it is with the hummus, I'm sure. Yeah. So I ate that and that was really good. Okay. That's all you had? Yeah. Look at that. You should eat there. You know where that No, it looks good. But what I would suggest is smaller meals, just a bunch of smaller meals. That's what they say. I don't know. How about, how about we try him fruit till noon. You know this guy Fruit till noon. There's a guy that only eats fruit till noon. You go fruit till noon and then you eat a meal. There he is. And he looks great. Okay. Fruit Till noon. Is that acai? I dunno if that's the guy. Oh no, That's not the guy. Yeah, I don't like that guy. Papa doesn't Wake up till 3:00 PM. Yeah, so he's eating fruit till noon.


Oh. Here's another thing that I think is the reason why I've been gaining weight is acai bowls. Sugar. Yeah. Lot of sugar. And there's this one, this is my favorite one, but I think it's too much. It's too sweet. And I've been eating maybe one or two of them a day. Don't eat With the peanut butter and with all the fruits in it too. And the granola's. So many. It's so much. It's so sweet. You Don't eat it. It's so good. But I don't think, I think that's the problem. Yeah. What about And I, I think I, and I don't know if I have to cut this out, but I, I have an issue. What? Black toe? You got black toe? Yeah. Let me see. You can't see because I covered it with fucking toenail polish. How did you get black toe repeated trauma?
