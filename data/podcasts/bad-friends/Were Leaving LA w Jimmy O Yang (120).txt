It'll interfere with the radio. No, it won't. That's, there's no way that's, There's no way. There's no way. There's a lot of things they should, like the closing the windows when you're landing. What's that all about? Gimme A break. Gimme, I, I, I know why they do that. Why? So when it's on fire, you can't see. You can't See it. So no one Panicked, right? Yeah. Yes. You don't panic, right?

Like, it means shit. It doesn't mean shit. It doesn't mean diarrhea. They, They lie. They, they. So here's what happens. Yeah. I'm in terminal five. I'm about to fly on JetBlue 'cause it shares it with American. I fly American my whole career.


We've been on the road. You know Why? Because you're an American. God bless. God Was good. God bless America, man. No, but I, but look, I've been, I've been an American customer. 'cause my dad was, when we traveled a lot, now I switched a lot back and forth. But I have over a million miles on American. Whoa. Over a million, right? And check this out. I politely go to the, I politely go to the lounge, and I say to the woman, Hey, I know I'm not traveling American today. I'm traveling JetBlue. It's the same terminal. They don't have a lounge, but like, I wanna get something to eat. 'cause I haven't eaten. Like, I'm running around. I haven't eaten. I go, is it cool if I go in there? 'cause I'm a, and she goes, you have to fly American. I go, can I show you my, I've, I, I have my loyalty or whatever. Mm. And she's like, no, I don't care.


And I have the card. And I was like, no. I mean, please, just please, can I just get like a coffee and something to eat? I haven't eaten all day. She's like, no, you have to be flying American. And I said, I have over a million miles. What else do you want me to do? Dude? Your co I give your company so much money every year. I'm not saying I, I, I'm entitled. But it's like, dude, cut me a break. Can I get a coffee and a fucking donut? I fly with you guys a million fucking miles a year. I don't wanna fight with you. Start it. Yeah. I don't start it. I don't wanna, I don't, no. Start it. I I don't wanna start another fire. No. Start it. I don't wanna start another Fire. Start one in this, in this room, and then we'll get an alert. By the way, we get an alert on our phone, man, Matt and Bobbylee goes, we're telling the whole city to evacuate. I was like, read it.


I was mentioning common things that normal people go through, right? And you had to throw in, oh, The first class strap was a common thing. You fucking liar. You fucking liar. This is, this is what the fans don't know. Yeah. Yeah. You're a fucking liar. No, You're a liar. He started off by saying, the poor people liar. I never said that. Yeah, you fucking did roll the tape. Oh, yeah, I did. Yeah, he did. Okay. Here's what he does. He plays this victim card, and the fans think like, poor, innocent bobbylee, dude, he's a brat. You guys don't know shit. You guys are so outta your element. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, everybody can get access to a lounge. That's not like a privileged thing. But if you travel with an airline enough, you can go to the lounge. It doesn't matter how many points you have, you can go, and by the way, and by the way, little boy, you didn't have any status until I signed you up for all of your frequent flyer, because I said, I'm Try with help you out.


Another thing you don't fucking take care of. I, I, I didn't listen to a word you just said. Now let me say something. Okay? I know You did Carla, and you've been to the airport with him, right? Oh yeah. What's up with him in the lounge? We're always, he's always like, meet me in the lounge. I'm, what am I? I'm like, I don't wanna go to the lounge. I wanna go get a snack. I wanna get food. Thank you. Money, George. We can go to Dunking Donuts. They have better Snacks. Why? I, why would I pay when I can just sit down and You Don't have chocolate donuts in the lounge? Well, You should stop getting Dunking Donuts. It's kid Mentality. Like McDonald. He's a child. McDonald's over cafeteria food. Yeah. I'll take, I'll take Whoa, What He's saying. Go ahead, George. It's shitty food. It's pls. No lounges aren't cafeteria food. No. No. But I know what he's saying. It's, it's comparative. My point is, I just want to have like a cup of coffee and sit down and relax.


Because you get to the gate and you're like, well, there's nowhere to sit. So I'm gonna stand here like a fucking dildo waiting for the flight. And then it's not worth it. I'd rather go to the lounge, get a cup of coffee, sit down, read some emails. It's so, that's why every time I invite, by the way, when we do go to the lounge together, you fucking liar. You love it. You're a fucking liar. When we were in Australia, we went in the lounges. You fucking loved it, didn't you? Didn't you liar? Dude, you're such a liar. No, no. The fact, what's wrong? Your fact that the fans don't fucking know wrong with who you really are. What wrong? What is wrong with you? It bums me out. It's crazy. No, my testosterone High. Do you listen yourself Talk? I'm working out every day. My tea is way up right now. Dude, I wanna kiss you fucking okay. Oh yeah. One la one last thing, and then we can move on from thing. They should have, obviously at the gate, a first class line.


Oh boy. This is relatable. This will be a relatable Thing. And then they should have, they should not done. Okay. They should have the groups, you know? Yeah. So you have group B, C, whatever are the lettering of the Numbers. One, two, whatever the number Numbers. There's always numbers. Go ahead. Okay. You wanted To start a FA fight, dude, you even said it. Okay, But what, so what? They should have a No, I'm not done yet though. Go ahead. Alright, so then they should have also a line that they don't have right. For Is I Know it for the Chinese. I know. And I knew you were gonna say. 'cause I'll tell you why. Yeah. Okay. They caught, they no, that only what? They don't know how it works. They Yes they do. I know they do Chinese people, but they pretend that they Don't. Yeah. I love 'em. So Their whole thing is what going on right here.


I don't, I don't, I don't know. You Know, I love Chinese. They cut. They cut, they cut. And they go in the first class line. Dude, sometimes you'll see a Chinese couple. Yeah. Old Chinese couple. Yeah. And they'll go with the needs more time. Like the disabled people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen them walk with the veterans. I've seen Them with mi Military. Yeah. With the veterans. Yeah. Yeah. You're not In the Marines. And he beefs his phone. Right? He beefs his phone. He's like, right. Whoa. Yeah. America. But you know what I love though? This is what I love. I love that the Chinese, when they, when they get to the ticket person, right? They go, how, how about the me? Right? Yeah. Right. How about the be? And then they go, no, you're, you're, you're five. You're seven. Seven. You're at the end, right? And then they're, then they have to go. And I always make a face. I always go. I love it. See, when they walk by me, I go, nice try.


You don. I let I It's a nice try. You gotta let 'em swing. Yeah. Okay. I'll give you one for the boarding bullshit I'll give you back. Here we go back. It doesn't make any sense. And it never has that we don't board back to front. Why wouldn't the back of the plane board first? It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. You're boarding the front and it's jamming up. Let people in the back go first. Are you saying this? Are you put first class first and then go back? No, because I'll tell you why that's not gonna work. First class should go last. I'll tell you. Why not? Why? Because you're, you're gonna know this. Okay. You Like to stare at the people as they walk by. That's number one. Yes. I know. You know, that's number one. But this, yeah, I like to, I have my face. I know. And I, I do this. I sit like this and I always have my hand out like this. Right?


And when they, when they lock eyes, I go like this. I go, Oh, move on. Yeah. Like, Move on. Wow. Don't look, don't look. All right. Don't do this. Yeah. Yeah. And if you get to the Comfort Plus section, and the bags don't fit. 'cause there's no bag room. Yeah. They burn. They light your bag on fire in front of you. That's a very good one Right in Front of you. Here's what I don't want. I don't like, okay. What? My shit's up there, right? Yeah. Some guy's late. He moves. It Not just moves it. He does something different. Like he tries to fucking touch. Ah, he, he tries to Tetris it. Right? I get it. And he puts his stuff Jams. Yours twisted. Right. You have no idea what's in mine. I could have some bio-hazard material. And you sometimes do. I Sometimes do. Right? Yeah. So don't touch mine and Tetris my shit. Because you could set it off. Yeah. I just don't touch my shit, Man, by the way. Say that to 'em.


Next time they're moving, it'd be like, oof. That's gonna trip the wire. Yeah. I wouldn't do that, dude. Yeah. It will go off. Yeah. So those are my things. Those are your rules. Well, how about, how about this one? Okay. I did a nice thing. Yeah, I did a switch. Will you switch me seats? I did a nice thing. You got your Bluetooth? Yeah, I did a switch me thing. You know? Can I have my husband and I can sit the thing? Yeah, I did. Of course. No problem. I'll do it. I'll do it. Anytime someone asks. No big deal. You do. I do. When they a when, how about this? Would you Do this, huh? If you were an aisle or a window? Sure. And so you had to be a window, a middle to do it. I It's six. How long is the flight? Six hours long. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six hours. That's correct. Come on. So you, so I'm the guy.


It, this is, excuse me. Excuse me. This is time dependent. Excuse me, sir. Yeah. How are you, man? Yeah. You know, we got our tickets late. And so me and my wife, we don't have seats next to each other. But if you switch my wife, you know, she could sit next to me. So can you switch, please? She, she's got the middle. I don't Oh, yeah, yeah, Yeah. I don't how, yeah. Yeah. Oh, you're not from this country. Excuse me. Yeah. I don't speak English right away. Right away. Right. See, how would you handle it? Ready? Yeah. Excuse me, sir. Sir. Excuse me, sir. Hi. Hey. My wife and I booked tickets late and we're actually going to my mom's funeral. And do you think we could switch seats so I could sit next to my wife, sir.


Oh. Oh. Oh my God. You know what I do in that situation? What? I go right to flight, attend. I go, Hey, can you just move this guy? 'cause he won't know the difference. Yeah. No, No. But I did it. I did deaf and blind. Right, right, Right. You were looking at me. I wasn't looking at you. You have mute, right? So you gotta go deaf and blind. Yeah. And blind. Right. And then if that doesn't work, you go a little bit of like twisty. You pull The hell the brain, you pull the Helen Keller. Yeah. Yeah. Like, You don't even, you pull the Kel. Yeah. Yeah. So that's good. Pull a Keller. Would you pull a Keller On a, on a flight? Yeah. Yeah. No, but my favorite thing to do when someone's talking to you on a flight sitting next to you, I like to make up a life. If they don't know if they've never seen me, or like, if they don't know who, they're like, what, what are you going to Charleston for? Yeah. It's a fun opportunity to be like, I'm an, I'm, I'm an engineer, I'm an aerospace engineer, and I'm going to a conference right now.


We're actually developing a way to shoot down Chinese spaceships. Oh, Wow. I'll just make shit up. Oh, that's good. It's fun. Who fucking cares? And that guy's like, whoa. Yeah. I pretend.

Squid games. Yeah. Once I'm genuinely, I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart. Once again, the fucking Asian community makes another banger. Korean. Okay. More specific. I said Asian. Okay. But, but here's my problem. Why can't American fucking shows do a second run? And it's just as good as the first. Why? Why can't we do that? We don't. We fuck up all the time. You mean Like, do a better second season? You Yes. We don't do we almost, we. Well, I mean, severances should be good when it comes out. I hope. Yeah. Maybe we don't. I mean, the first was so good. Well, who the fuck knows? Who knows? Yeah. Got a hundred percent Season Two got a hundred percent rotten tomatoes On severance. Yeah. You saw it yet already. It's out already. No, there is a post. Season one was great. I love that.


Yeah. But I'm just saying it's like American shows, they struggle a lot with coming back with another bang. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this show I think is, I'm not done. I think it's gonna be just as good as the first, well, The third one, you know who's in it? You No. How you, how are you not in it? I'm Not Korean. I don't speak Korean. Yeah. Yeah. You fucking do. No, I don't. I I, I would be able to say, where's the bathroom and pussy? I mean, I mean, those are the only words. I Know. The only Thing heard beepboop Food. I've heard you say that to your mom.

Let's talk about a complete unknown too. Such a phenomenal film. It's just not, it's phenomenal.

Ask Jean. Jean Hung would keep looking at me. And I literally weeped what's so funny. Were you crying like to look cool in front of Gene? A little bit. Yeah. Because you knew he kept looking at you.

That's how you saw it. 'cause how I saw it was you arrived. Yeah. And then you were like, there's a beautiful woman next to you. And she was very doting.


And every time I'll talk to you or like, you know, I'll talk to her. She was like, I gotta go. Bobby's right there. I gotta take care of him. Oh, thank you. You were like the king. She's my concubine. Yeah. There you go. Boom. That, that's it. Boy dude. Yeah. And Were there any whites at the party? Other than the one? There's some whites.

No, no, no. I, I'm, I'm into ethnicity. I dated black girls, Asian girls, you know, white girls. I think that my ex-girlfriend was very white. Yeah. So I think people just assumed that. Mm. But also, I don't know, like growing up in Hong Kong when everyone was Asian, like white people was exotic to me. Like how white guys here obsess over Asian girls. 'cause it's exotic. You know, Certain kinds of white guys.


Yeah, maybe. Yeah. You don. Yeah. Weirdo white guys do. Yeah. Yeah. Creepy white like George. Yeah. Yeah. Look at tell, look, take one. Look at that guy. Tell me his wife is Asian For sure. A hundred percent Asian chicks. A hundred percent for sure. It's a kind of white guy that's obsessed with it. Now I find Asian women beautiful. But there's a certain kind of white guy that like obsesses over Asian women. Mm. Yeah. He is. He does. He, oh, Mike, no, but okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask you a question. There you Go. Mark Zuckerberg. Yep. Yep. She placed a violin as violinist, I think. Yeah. It's always fucking weirdo white guys. Dude. It's always white girls on Raya that I match with. You know what it always says? What in common with Jimmy O Yang? No. Come on man. It says it right there. I see it.


Come on. Damn dude. Okay. Do you know her? I do not know her. Come Closer. You do Know her? He does. I do know her. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Lemme see what? Lemme see this girl Ex-girlfriend. No, No, no, no, no. Okay. How Do I see her photos? I'll Show you Honey. That's Oh, touch it. Wait, wait. Bobbylee, did you talk to her? Well, I did. I forgot to read the Jimmy Yang part. So I did say, hi. This is how you know she loves Asian guys. Bruce Lee is one of her profile photos. I know Bruce Lee is one of her profile. That's What, yeah, that's a good tale. That's like you in no But's And Jackie Chan.


I know, I, I understand that. I'm not exaggerating. That's, I swear to God it is. Right. So, but, but she, this is what I find because I wanna say this one time Saw you Jimmy O Yang. I saw. Damn. You look good, dude. What? Me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Hot guy. Huh? I Lemme look. Lemme look. Fucking hot dude. Hot dude. So I'll one time you were at the improv, this is years ago. And you had a girlfriend, right? She dressed in an Asian thing. She was a white girl. No shit. Really? Yeah. And then she also had a, her purse had like pearls in it, but it looked like, you know, the green jd, you know what I mean? It looked like an Asian bag. For real. Yeah. So I'm wondering with this girl, I think you are the influence.


Oh, once they meet you Oh, they become more Asian and then now you mean it opens them up to our market. That's, you know what, let's put that out there. Yeah. Yeah. You know, if she was already predisposed to Asian dudes. Yeah. Jimmy, Jimmy is the, once you go black Jimmy's the once, Once You Go Yellow Asian. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You bang Bobby Lee also. Yeah. You know, that's, that's The, Once You Go Yellow, you find yourself another Asian fellow. Asian fellow. That's right. I think that's what it's That's right. That's it. You're the opening. So, you know. But because I've felt that too, where I've like gated a white girl and then they were like, you go to their house and you go, oh yeah. They, they, they're prone to us. Yes. Yes. Yeah. They're aware. Yeah. There's like a poster of like, like they watch Mulan or something.


NATO Anime. Yeah. And then there's like, you know, a lot of bamboo and bonsai trees. Those, Those, those Chinese stress balls. Yeah. Those Stress bars. Yeah. Yeah. George Church has those in this dinner table. A hundred percent. It's a different time though. I feel like now with so much representation, like with squid games, BTFs, everything too Much. If Who isn't in the Asians, like, I wish I grew up, like I went a high school and middle school now, I think it would of be a Different gang of Jimmy. Some of 'em are not. Yeah. And and you've, you've seen them have you not? I think so. I I think so, but I think They, they just won't, they won't do it. What You talking about? Some white girls, they just won't cross that line. Some Girls in general are just not interested. I'm saying it's like a you're making That's True. I just don't like the way you said it though.


True. Some. Yeah. Why did you say it like That? Some women aren't interested, period. It has nothing to do with you being Asian. They're just not interested. They're not interested in my type. Your type is not because you're Asian. Your type is specific. You know? Hey, so my wait, wait, wait. My, wait, wait. My you My type fucking Yeah. Are you fucking telling me what that you and I are on two completely different categories. Yes. Yeah. So tell me what the category I'm in. I don't, Jim, Jimmy, Andrew. Andrew as the Carlos, somebody, I mean, third person point of view. Here's what I would say. Yeah. Jimmy is, I understand He's a starter on Arsenal and you're, you're in the locker room and you're there and you're cheering on the boys and you're on the team, but you're not on, you're not on a midfield, by the way.


This is, Is that what you're saying, Jen? He's a Superstar. That's what I'm Saying. That's, He's a superstar. That's not what I was saying. The Kid's a fucking Superstar. No. Come on guys. We know he is. 100% is He is. Well, what whatcha you, You guys doing better than me? Whatcha guys Talking about? That's not, that's not true. You own your own studio. You don podcast. You have staff, you have staff of white people. Well, first of all, he's, he's actually half Mexican. So that's, we got points for him. Carlos, I heard about you, man. Yeah. One of my best friend pj, a big fan of the podcast, says he liked glory holes. He loved That's the Glory King baby. It's getting around, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. I'm glad it's getting around. Yeah. And you know what, honestly, you, you're here. Let's, let's squash this. Now. Your appeal for women is just different than yours.


You get plenty of beautiful women. They're just different kinds of women. I get it. I've accepted it. Right? Yeah. I'm not fighting against, against the, because I've seen Jimmy O beautiful women with you. Yeah. No, but what I'm saying is, is that I have to say that it's, he's still in a different category. Yep. So Carlos and I, so we're better. But Yeah, I think just different. But when we cast it, we're in the same category. That's my problem. No one's casting you guys in the same, you guys are no fucking what? Casting. So, so I was out for the Joey Coy part. Did you do that part? Well, I produced that movie Easter Sunday. It's His fucking movie. Which part? The, the one Il Ali end up playing. What? The one Ali The bad guy. The bad guy? No, there was a part that he said he had written for me that I got offered.


And I said I, I couldn't do it because I was doing borderlands. Oh. I think there was a part. Yeah. I'm, I'm not, I, I don't remember it was my part. Okay. Because My part, I couldn't do another part. So I was like, okay, Okay. I'm not okay. But I've also been in other situations where Jimmy O Yang got the part and I didn't get it. But that's just because it's, But but it was for the same part was I'm saying that he beats me out. They just wanna see How So if we're in the same category, you're not when it comes to, I think that's a very broad, like, it's, it's, it's, it's not, it, it's Hollywood's issue that at times we're in the same category. Correct. Because if Santino and like, who will be, I don't know, like another white guy that would be totally a different guy. Like you and Me and Anthony Jeselnik aren't gonna go off for the same fucking role.


Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Or like, you and Pat Oswald could go off for different roles, but you guys are very different people. Or you and Ryan Gosling pick off with different roles. I'm not saying you're, you know, I'm just saying. Yeah, No, you're right. It's all very Different people. And, and sometimes it's just people are dumb. Like the category could also just be Asian, Asian guy, funny guys or whatever. Right. Like, or whatever. It's, it's different. You okay. Bobbylee? He's a little shocked. He's a little stunned. He's li he got a little hit. He got a little hit. Okay. Took A hit. I'm good. I'll agree with you. Well Also, No, no. Stop. Stop. Well, you're also different in age's. True. I mean, Jimmy's 37 years old And also Korean and Chinese. Very different, you know?


Yeah. Well that part I don't know about. I I understand that. I understand that. I know we're different. Yeah. He's Chinese. You're right. You know what I mean? I take, take That back. Thank you. I'm older. Also. Be nice to the Chinese. I love the Chinese. Just be Nice. What? I love that Stuff. Just be nice. Okay. Because he gets on his little high horse and he doesn't Oh, You think that I, I bet. What's the high horse? What's The He starts spouting hatred about China. He'll do it. He'll just crack one open and start flying off the handle. I mean, you guys don't know how to wait in line. See How Do what? Wait in line. We talked about it earlier. You guys don't even know how to Wait in like in mainland China. Something everywhere. Okay. Oh, no. Here, Everywhere. Baskin Robbins. It doesn't matter where it is. Chinese be skipping lines, dude.

It stinks. Well, which one? There's also a lot. Well, man, Dur. Well, okay. What's the one that you are, I, I can speak a few, But that's fucking Arrogant. I'm not saying that. No, no. 'cause I grew up, like I grew up in Hong Kong, but my parents speak Shanghai. And then I, okay, So if I'm in Hong Kong, let me, I, I'm gonna, Cantonese will be In Hong Kong. So Cantonese. Yeah. Yeah. Say something in Cantonese. I'm gonna see if it's harsh. How about this? Say, say, Hey you guys, save me a seat.


When you get to the restaurant in that world Theme. See, it's Like, Jesus. Fuck. Yeah. That's a lot. All right. It's like a machine gun going off. Yeah. I got think. Yeah. Yeah.

You Know what, they had to put it with a woman's voice just to Make a Exactly. You know? Why is that? What, what is that? Yeah. Yeah. It's just an aggressive thing, you know? And you know, what's up with Tai Chi? Is that a martial arts or is it a meditative thing you're doing?


It's a little bit of both. I've never seen anyone fight anyone with Tai Chi. I don't think you fight. Have you? Tai Chi's? It's an exercise. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. How is, how is this? I'm martial arts dude. Hey, there's no way To, but see, that's the opposite. Aggressive. You know what I mean? That is true. That There's no, no Asians more aggressive than Koreans. I think.

There's not a lot of like, authentic Japanese people in la. I feel like I like Japan. I like to experience that. What does that say about Japanese? That they don't wanna live in la?


That's interesting. 'cause there's a lot of Korean and a lot of Chinese here, but not a lot of Japanese. Yeah. Why not? I don't Know. You think it's a superiority thing? 'cause a lot, he always says they have a superiority complex. The Japanese. I never said that. Yeah, you do. You said that. Like, they're, That's insane. What do you Mean we have that on tape? Yeah. You say, you say they think they're the best. You say that all the time. They are The best. Okay. What the fuck? What are we saying Then? I just said what you said. Okay. They have a, you said they have a superiority complex. They think they're complex. They think they're, Yeah. It was a legitimate accident. But don't, but don't you think that they're perceived as the best or no? What do you think Jimmy? I think it's 'cause they project that is when I, I think they run their country very well. There's good food. There's a, a good sense of respect there. There's a, a high speed railway. You know? That's a very good one. You know, I think logically they're Doing pretty good.

Bobbylee, I thought you're you. The first piece of advice Bobbylee told me when I was coming up, he was like, don't ever do a standup special. Save your material and then you can tour with the same material in colleges for 20 years. 30. Yeah. 30. Yo. Yo. That was sound advice. You know, he is like, why would you want to do a special? And then now you have to write in a whole new hour. We literally just talked about it. I took that, I took that to heart, man.


You know? You did One. You did. You didn't go by my fucking suggestion. You've done a, you've done A few. I, yeah. I've done, I seriously, I, I swear. Like when I said, okay, I'll do one and I'll quit. Yeah. And now I said, I'll do my second one for this amount of money and I'll quit. Yeah. But then, you know, it's just too fun, man. This is what we do. Yeah. There's so much fun. Bobbylee, this is your, well, how many specials have you done now? None. So this is your first one? This is huge. Yes. Yeah. It's a big deal. This is Huge. Okay. Yeah. Wow. When is it coming out? We don't know yet. Okay. But you know, wait, we Do, we Filmed it. I can't believe that end Of this year. I can't, I can't believe that I, I gave you that suggestion. It's sound advice. Yeah. But you didn't go with advice.


Well, only 10 years later. Yeah. Yeah. But Was it him going against your advice worked out pretty well for him? I think we did it when you were in I know, I remember the day it was when I was living in the apartment on Beachwood. When I was at TigerBelly. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. That's when I gave you the advice. Yeah. I don't remember now. The Beachwood days. The Beachwood day. Where are you living now? Are you still in Los Angeles, aren't you? Yeah. Is your house okay? Yeah. Yeah. Were you scared last night? I was. I went to K-Town and they didn't evacuate my place, but I'm like, dude, lemme just go to the hotel in K-Town. Grab all my stuff. Yeah. What are you gonna do, man? You stay in la I don't, I, you know, you know what I like? I like Vancouver. Whoa. I've shot a couple things in Vancouver. Yeah. I've, It's really nice. Great Chinese food. It's, Yeah, so expensive. It's so expensive though.


But I mean, it's expensive anywhere. Yeah. No, no. You're not in fucking Idaho. Right? Montana. Right. But see, these are places great for you. Like, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what, Jimmy, thank you. It's Good for you. And back in the day, everyone's like, this whole country was great for people like me. And then we let you guys in. Yeah. Because everyone's like, why don't you move to Texas? Why don't you move to No, we don't like it. You Know, Nashville, whatever. I'm like, that's not but Texas great for me. It's Okay for you. No, no, it's fine. I You kill in Texas. I like it just like, I like it here. Yeah. I can, you know, assimilate. I can make all kinds of, all my friends with different ethnicities. But like Vancouver, like, I just felt like home.


I felt like Hong Kong, it's very, Very Chinese. It's the Asian majority. And I felt there's a weird, like, familiarity and safeness and the food just makes sense to me there. Yeah. Canada's great man here. Here's the thing about whites anywhere else, okay. It's not that they have hatred, it's that they don't see people like us often. Like when I, when I was in Butte, Montana shooting that movie. Yeah. I was at an AA meeting. Okay. And some guy was pouring coffee and people's glasses. The guy came up to me and goes, Hey man, sorry, we don't have any green tea. That's, that's a very accommodating one. Right. And I go, it's actually pretty polite. It's, I drink coffee too, man. You know what I mean? Well, we know, but what happens when you do drink coffee?


But you guys turn, You guys all, all the Time, man, I don't want you kungfu and Yeah. Don't be kung fu. It's somebody that like doesn't, isn't around us that often. Yeah. And then they just wanna be nice. That's right. But it comes out, you know what I mean? A little racist, but I don't Yes. Mind that. It's just people are just Try with get acclimate themselves to us. Yeah. It's not malicious. It's not malicious. I don't feel bad after that happens, but I feel like, could I really be friends with this man? Maybe. Maybe. It'll be hard. It'll be an uphill battle, you Know? Well, we're gonna, we're leaving. We're moving. We're not moving. Bob and I are moving. Where are you guys going? We figured how's, how can we get the most central in the United States? And it's Missouri. We're gonna Missouri. It's the most central state in the United States.
