Yeah. Jack, right? Yeah. Sean Penn. Sean Penn is your brother, right? Yeah. He's the Dead. Man Walking. And then He, you guys are in, like, I remember distinctly, you guys are in sort of waiting room. I think you were wearing a suit. I don't know. I don't, were you ever wearing a suit? Yeah. It was like a Sears, it was a cheap suit. Yeah. Yeah. We, We, yeah. A low income family. Yeah. And I was one of his little brothers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We were Three of us. And I was so freaked out. 'cause I love Sean Penn ever since I saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Oh yeah. He my favorite actor.


So good. And weirdly, that was kind of the only comedy thing. He did the very first movie and then he went hard into like, drama. Yeah. But, But he, that fast times no one. I mean, I know it's a specific character, you know what I mean? It seems more sketchy. Like a sketch, like a sketch character almost. But dude, he, because he's such a good actor, it, it just makes it so much better because it's so believable. Like, he, well, he Doesn't, he never looked like that again, which I thought was really wild. Like, he transformed that stoner surfer thing. Never, you know, was reimagined by him, which I thought was kind of wild after that. You never saw him look like that? Ever? Or he wasn't, Again, the donut in his, around his belly button when he walks in, remember that, remember fast times?


I Don't remember a donut in his belly Button. I think he walked, yeah, I think he walked into the room with a donut in a Jelly bobbylee as FS Fli. Am I not right, or No? I don't think so. I don't think so. Right there at Or bagel. Oh, bagel. Yeah. Oh, That's tucked into his, but I'm sure that's AdChoices Mr. Hand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no one had captured that kind of stoner before him on film that I'm aware of. Yeah. And it was just such a brilliant, hilarious performance. But anyway, so I had this little part as his little brother, and it was just a, a, a, a, a surreal experience. And I, and I got to watch him do his thing up close and personal.


And I was there on the day that he shot the scene with Susan Sarandon in the Jail. In The jail. Oh my God. It's the night before. He is gonna get executed. And he's just having this cathartic, like, just explosive tears. And it's a confession. He confesses to Her. It's the redemption part of it. Yeah. And then were you, obviously you weren't shooting that day. No. You knew he He was shooting, he was shooting that scene that day. Yeah. So were they weird that you were coming or No, No. I knew the director, the director who, who also gave me my first part in showbiz, Tim Robbins was the di also the director of a theater company called The Actors Gang.


And so I was tight with him. So he let me kind of, you know, right. The scenes. Wow. I wanted to watch stuff. Was he, now let me, was he approachable Sean Penn back then, or? No, He was approachable, but he was super method. So he was kind of in character as this kind of gnarly dude, drug, drug doing. Mad man who partied hard. And, and I did hang with him, but I, I have to admit, I was, I was a little scared of him. Mm. In the way that you might be scared of wild animal, where it's a little, a little unpredictable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. One time you're, you're just talking and there's a funny story about John Malkovich or something. And then the next minute there's some kind of crazy freeform poetry coming out of it.


And then it's like, wait, are you gonna punch me in the face? Wait, what's happening over there? Is there, Wow. Wow. Is there a blow job happening up? Hey, where am I? Do you still, do you get intimidated still or no? Like, sometimes I'm like, I Get a little nervous. Yeah. I get anxious. Do you get anxious? I get anxious. And you know, when they say, never meet your heroes. Mm. I think never meet your heroes. Not because they're gonna do something weird, but I act weird around them. I don't do well. If I have an option to meet them, I usually will say pass. I'd rather just enjoy their work from afar. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Also, you don't want them to be a dick, then you'll, it'll forever change how you feel about them.


No, I don't know. I mean, I'll tell you my Te Andre story, right? No. You know who teary enri is? Soccer player? Yeah. Oh, it's my favorite soccer player, Jack. Oh, really? Even better than Pele. The way you say Pale, maybe not dude, but it's like Teary Ri is a French talker player for my favorite team. Well, what's my favorite team? Everybody. Arsenal. Arsenal fc. Okay. Legend. I was shooting the dictator in Sasha's movie. I had two lines. We have two lines. But anyway, there are No small parts. Thank you, Jack. I mean No, he does a lot of small parts. Yeah.


Two line Lee. I know, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. The business. He's called Two Line. Two line Lee. What He does with him though, everybody loves Him. I Don't know. He makes a meal. I make A meal. So anyway, I'm in the elevator. I can't believe I've never told this story. No. Oh My God. Alright, so I'm at the Trump. So Hall Hotel back Then, you have a residency there, right? Yeah, yeah. Anyway, that's what it's called. It's called the Trump. They've got a Lee floor. Yeah, yeah. We've got a leaf floor. Yeah, there's a library. 33 for Lee. Yeah. Okay. So it's not, oh, so, okay. So First of all, there's definitely not a library there. Go on. No, there was. Okay. Anyway, I go in the elevator, the door's open. Yeah. And you, oh, so can I just say, because he, he's French and he played for Arsenal.


It's England. It's that kind of running into Gandalf or Voldemort, you know what I mean? You never think you're gonna fucking run into them. Yeah, right. It's not like LA where like, oh, there's Tom Cruise. I mean, I mean he, you know, or whatever, you know what I mean? You never think, so when he walked in it, in my mind, I'm like, Gandalf just walked. You know what I mean? And then like, also, I'm like his biggest fan. And I fucking went Sh I, I shut down. I, I, I, I like, like I was like, right. I Didn't know what to say. And then, then he got off on, on his floor and I wanted to say things and I couldn't, it was the first time where I was fucking Starstruck.


So you never got to say hello. I never Said anything to other guy. And also it's like, but I was, you know what I mean? But it was better that way because if I fucking said something and he was a Dick. Yeah. Oh my God. It would, I it would've ruined It. What would you have said? What would you have said anyway? Let me be that guy. What's his name? Tiar. Andre Ti. Andre Tiara. I am ti Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Pardon on me. I'm going to the elevator. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And okay, so let the music play in the elevator. I'm not gonna go right away. Cheer. Hello. Cheer. I, I, Are you talking to me? The volume down? I can take you the volume.


I'm trying to turn, sorry. Here. I'm trying to turn down the Fucking Shot. Anyway. Would set the volume on the elevator. Music. This elevator has a volume knob. This is crazy. Yeah. And te dude, I'm a huge Arsenal fan and I'm a huge Arsenal fan. And I'm, dude, I can't believe, thank you. Can I take A photo with you? Bing, Mr. Arm. There is no time. It's weird to talk to people. So, goodbye. I fucked it up. It doesn't matter, dude. No matter what you do in an elevator. Yeah. As soon as you start talking to a stranger in an elevator, you're off on the wrong foot. 'cause they feel trapped.


They're stuck with a, they don't know who you are. You could be a, a dangerous person. Right. Right, right, right. Elevator conversations are so on. Well, So that's why maybe I didn't say anything. Here's The best thing to say. I Don't wanna be that guy, but I, I lemme be that guy For a minute. Every time. And, they say that every time A guy walked up to me on the phone. In Scotland? Yeah. On FaceTime. I was at a hotel on the phone with my wife, a guy's on FaceTime, and he just jams his phone in front of my face. 'cause he's on with a friend of his. And I and I, I took everything inside of me not to just take his phone and throw it as far as I could.


'cause it was crazy rude. I, he was just like, shoved it in my face. Yeah. Now I think our, my generation of like, don't say anything. I'm just gonna leave them alone. Mm. Now people don't give a shit at all. They'll shove a phone right in your face. They'll record you. It's gotten, it's crazy now. No, there's no rules. Yeah. No Rules. There's no rules. But there's also no way to win. 'cause If, you throw the phone, you're an asshole. If you. Yep. If you take the phone and play along and talk to the stranger on the thing for the stranger, then you're, you're being a foolish person. 'cause now you're getting stuck in, in a weird situation. I always end up doing it. Yeah. I was like, okay, yeah, I'll talk to the person. But if I'm like late for a thing or I'm with someone that, that that's a friend or a family, I will kind of keep a short and and just go, Hey man.


Yeah. It just was weird. It was the weirdest. He like, put it on my face. I can't imagine you, I I mean I, your face must've changed colors. Yeah. I don't like that. 'cause he is the pivot. How do you stick and move so that it takes the least amount of time? And that way I think it's best to go high impact. Gimme That fucking phone. What's up? You fucking asshole. Love you. Bye. Give them the experience and then move. Write that down. High impact. That's why I'm gonna try that style. Look, can I try high Impact? I was the opposite. He put it in my face. I go, come on man. And I walked away. Yeah. Try. Can I, What are you doing? Can I try High impact? Yeah. I wanna practice. I think you're a little high impact anyway right now. Yeah. No, always. Okay. Sure. Do it. Go for it.


Well, Gimme the phone. Put the phone on my face. Hey man, we talked to my buddy. I got, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, see that's great. I told you he was Asian. Oh, right, Right here. Here's the problem with what you did, Andrew. It's for me. If I do what you did, and you're like, no pass, thank you. But no thank you. And I walk away, it stays with me. Oh yeah. No, I Disappointed that person. It'll fucking stick with me for days. Sometimes weeks. I'll think, why was I such an asshole to that one person? All I had to do was fucking, yeah. So I, I will usually err on the side of give him something. Give Him a little, give him a little something if it's appropriate. I always do. But this was like drunk, rude, shove a phone in my face.


I was like, come on dude. But You guys don't know what it's like being little though, Because then they can take more advantage. No, What they do is they pick you up. Last night I was with a young lady, P pew. Pew in her 30. She's 30 years old. And why are we shooting guns just then? It's becoming more American. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I love dead wood and that's why I was doing that. Is that what she calls your penis? Go ahead.


No, but we have BLUECHEW. Yeah. So yeah, we do throwing in there.

What's your bad boy meal? What's your like, oh, I can't wait to go get naughty and overeat this. I mean, look, A cheeseburger is the best sandwich in the world. And that is my bad boy. Mia with some fries. Mm mm You got a spot? Yeah. What's your favorite smash burger right now? You know what? I'm gonna come out and say I'm not into smash burgers. They're smashed. So the question, this is the eternal question.


I can't believe we still have to ask this question. Where's the beef? Where it's been smashed out of it? It's mostly char. It's mostly fried char. And the beef is in there, but it's smashed. I like a big fat Juicy burger. Yes. Well, you're a FUD Ruckers guy. Hey, Hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey. It clothes Jack, Or actually, this is not the fattest burger there is, but my favorite burger, it's, it's obviously the apple pan. My favorite beans. Oh. Oh. I've been to Apple pan. Apple pan's great. I Used to live next door to there when I first, Oh, it's on Pico, right? Is it Pico Westwood? Yep. Westwood Pico. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Been there, done that. I agree. But may I have a argument please? He's Got a rebuttal. I Gotta do the rebuttal.


Okay. Yeah, we Talking, we talking fries. Well done, Jack. Of course. Can you Get a slice of pie Alamo afterwards? I do. If I'm feeling nasty. I Do every Time. Dude, you know what the real weird thing is? If, you go hickory cheeseburger and the tuna sandwich. But you split that in half with a friend. Oh my God. God. So you sensible. This is hot. Oh, I didn't even know If You. And then I like to take them extra. Well done. Fries and Get. a little bit of scoop of tuna and ketchup. Oh, I didn't know they had that. Have you ever thought about doing a Jack Black restaurant? I should do 'em a restaurant. I did think about it for a minute. At the peak of like Kung Fu Panda and Nacho Libre, I was like, I could do a fusion restaurant.


Kung fu nachos. Nacho panda. Yeah. Then I thought about it. I was like, wait, do I really want those flavors together? The sweet and sour taco? I, yeah. Yeah. Dude. Maybe not Chop Pando. I mean, fucking Danny Trejo does it. Yeah. Okay. What is that? Is that Danny Trejo? That's my Danny Trejo impression. If, you know, But it's on brand for Danny Trejo. He's Mexican so he can pull off a Mexican restaurant and do it well by, He also has a Chinese restaurant though too, to be fair. No, he does not. Yeah, I'm very Gullible. No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't. Can I do my fucking counter argument? God, Nah, we're over It. No, no, no. Do it. Yeah. Thank you so much, Jack. All right. So I'll tell you why Smashburger is number one. Okay? Yeah. You want a thick fucking piece of meat in there, right?


Yeah. What happens? It bleeds into the fucking bun and now you got this bloody bun, right? That you have to fucking chew. It's like it's soak, it's soaky, it's Muddy. Interesting. Alright. Yeah. But a smashburger doesn't have a lot of juices that come out. Right? Right. It's also more compact. It's better to Hold. It's like you, Yeah. Yeah. Where that's not good. Where's Your favorite? Where's your Favorite? Well, lemme tell you something right now, Jack. I'm glad you asked. Okay. Right now I go to Jaho Jaho. Have you heard of it? It sounds like maybe there's some fusion in there. Is there some Korean flavors on It? No. No? No. Oh, okay. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why did they call it Jaho? That was, That was the guy's name. Oh, That okay. Oh no, it is because I'll tell you why. 'cause it's the owner of Sugarfish. Yeah.


Maybe his name's just ho. And you say, hi Ho. Hi Ho. Oh, maybe. Maybe. So that, so I go there and then he's the owner Of Sugarfish. Yeah. Yeah. Same guy. There's Gotta be some free fusion in their Japanese burger. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Maybe those are fish fries. Yeah, The MA's definitely in it. Yeah. And lemme say something else. Okay. That then I also go to heavy, heavy handed. Now you go to heavy handed. Dude, I'm going straight to high Ho. You gotta go there, dude. It's pretty good. It's so good. Me going. I like all that lettuce and stuff in there. Yeah. Ooh, It's So good, dude. And so, you know, next time when you eat this, then we'll have the discussion. You know what I mean? But I think that without you eating this Jack, you don't even know what you're talking about. All that Pickles. Yeah. Yes, please.


He knows what he's talking about. And also, Andrew, can I say this last thing about Hi Ho. And I don't want, I'm not there. I don't, I have nothing to do with the fucking company. Maybe it's a Snow White in the Seven Dwarves reference though. Hi ho. Hi. Hi. Ho. Its off the burger Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway, go there. And also, can I say something? This is the first restaurant. Yeah. Where the photo looks like the thing. Ah, yeah. Can I say another thing though? When I do go, I'll probably walk there and back to walk off all the extra calories. How many steps to walk off A high ho? A Lot. A lot. A lot. How many calories in a high burger? I actually wanna find Out at least 12,000 steps.


Really? I never look at calories. It's Got, it's, you know. I know, we know you don't. That's that'ss a big issue. I will say this though. Yeah. Oh, that's only special. Some of the best burgers I've ever had at me. Mexican restaurants. Zaa, they got the flavor. The lot of, lot of Mexican cooks. Yeah. They, they put the seasonings in there that tastes extra good. Zaa. There's a place called Yuccas Taco Stand. Yeah. But guess what? What? Got a great cheeseburger in there. No, at yuccas. Yeah. My favorite burger in LA is, is only because it's nostalgic for me, but there's a place on the west side where Venice meets the water called Ano.


Do you know about Hano? You, oh, I didn't know If. you said that earlier. Or if he said that. But Ano is an old cafe right on the water almost. And Jim Morrison used to play there. He used to live around the corner. It's got wood chips all over the floor still. It's one of those old school bars. Oh my God. You don't like the doers? Big deal. Ugh. What Jim Morrison used to play there. Yeah. So Morrison used to live around the corner from there in Venice. And I guess he would walk there. I look and see If. you could get the inside of that place. It's awesome. It's still got wood chips on the ground, like the old bars used to. Yeah. Yeah. But when You go to a hot dock and you see a photo of Barack Obama eating the hot dog, it doesn't do anything for me. That's all. Let's just move on. That's, that's not, I would think it's probably a good hot dog. Probably. Probably, Probably.


He's not gonna mess around with a substandard Hot dog. And then go to If If you. Wait, Wait, say on that photo. Stay on that photo real quick. All right. Diversity On Side already. I like the the hamburger because look at that Guy. Look at that guy. He loves it. He loves it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So on the other side of the bar is where the bands still play. They still have music there at night. See there where the pool table is. Go to that fourth, fifth picture down or whatever. You can see there's a pool table. So bands play in that corner there. And it's like an old surf. But the best part is, the reason I like this is it's always been a cheap, affordable burger. We used to live on the west side and there is no kitchen. They cook the burger right next to the taps. So there's a flat top grill next to the taps. So that's where you get your burger from. Right there, there it is. Right when you walk in.


Wow. He's slinging him right out front. It's the best. And this is back when it was before Jim Morrison was in the doors. He would go in there and just like do open mic night. He No, no. He, no, no, no. There was nights when he was with the doors, he would go play the doors. Played That hamburger. No, Jim would play by himself There would go play. You can go ask him too. They'll talk about it. Look, there's an, there's an original picture of Fanno from back today. How Does he play by himself? He just sings. He would just sing and play guitar. Yeah. Oh, That's what they said. He would, he would show. He would, he'd show up there and just sing. Now whether that's local lore, I don't care. It's Local lore. They don't have any evidence. They don't have photographic evidence. Now there's pictures Of Jim at the bar. But I mean, I don't know if that's true, but I like it. Yeah. Even if it's not, I don't give a shit. I like if he hung out there even I was like, that's kind of fucking Rad.


And he was already a rock star, you're saying? Yeah. He would also Do that already famous. Yeah. He Didn't need to perform for free cheeseburgers. I'm sure he was to, if we're being honest. I'm sure he was probably fucked up out of his mind. Yeah. He was going there just to like rail one out and play. And then ironically enough, or coincidentally, when I moved from the west side to West Hollywood, I lived next door to Jim Morrison's last known residence on Norton. Norton Avenue in West Hollywood. I, I like the doors. I, I did this just to find, Find out. I, I really, I, I Did just find out If. you like the doors? There's lots of people that don't like the doors. Le I don't know what it is, but it, they do rub people the wrong way. I'm on the camp that the doors rule.


They fucking rock of The doors. Fucking rock. Also, Phil Manza. Is that the, the piano? The, yep. Close. Close enough. Close. What? What is it? Manza. Oh yeah. Phil Menzak. Okay. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. I Don't Ray Manze Ray. It was the Phil That was right. Yeah. Ray Zerek. Right. 'cause he did the baselines as well on the keyboards. Right? Yeah. You were thinking of like Phil Collins combo. Who were you Thinking of? I don't know. I got Nervous. Phil Manzuk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He does. There's no bass player. He's, he gets the bass on his keyboards. Amazing. So cool. So fucking cool. And the thing about the doors too, Jim Morrison had the best voice, best screaming. Like he could sing better than anyone of his generation.


I would sing you prob You probably are one of the best scream singers too. You're very good. Well, thank you. You know that I'm, you Know, Jim Morrison. But I, I can get up there. When did you, when did you, when did you kind of discover this love of music and performing that you had? Like beyond the acting stuff? The music thing? Was that your first love? I loved getting up on a stage and, and getting attention and Ham Hammond cheese and doing theatrics when I was a little kid. Loved putting on a show. Mm. From as far back as I can remember it. Music, I liked it, like listening to it. But I didn't really get into singing until later till like high school when I, when I got into the, the musical theater.


'cause those were the, the, the good opportunities to get up on stage. And I was singing in a little show called Pippin. I hear about Pippin, Pippin 1970s musical. And I remember auditioning to get into Pippin and singing. And I had to really like scrape the pan is what they call it. When you get up to the top of your voice and you kind of gotta Yeah. Get, get up there and like, there's a little bit of distortion in your vocal pipes. And I remember there was a girl who was auditioning right after me. And she, the way she looked at me when I scraped the pan, no one had ever looked at me like that before. And I was like, I think I, I like this music. Oh, she looked at you in a Ula la It Was a different, yes.


There was A thing. I love Ula la Don't you love Ula la Everybody likes Ula La dude. That's why one of my favorite vibes, dude. You, You're Mr. Ul la la Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that wasn't the only reason. I do love music and I love doing it. But there was something about that object. But you realize You had, You had the thing That I had, maybe I had a little something. Mm. Maybe I had something I could work with. It's surprising you never did standup. Yeah, no standup for me. Probably better than it. What? He's Better than it. I know he's better than that. But I'm just saying It's a low, it's a low rent. It's A low bar. It's low. It's a low, it's a low. It's hanging fruit. It's low rent, art. You know what it is? It's writing. And I do like to improvise. I've, I've done a lot of improv classes and, and, and some improv in, in some of the, the sketches I've done.


But the best improvisers are like really good writers. And those standup comedians, you gotta be a real writer. And I don't really think of myself that way. I I Do, I do too. I think you would. I mean, I mean, you never thought about trying it. I have thought about it. 'cause I've been around it a lot. Yeah. When me and Kyle were doing tenacious d we would go and play these clubs and all these brilliant standups would go up there. But it takes a kind of courage. Hmm. And I always liked having that security blanket of being a part of a team. And if it went sideways, I could always say it was his fault. And having the guitars and the music was also, it was a, it was our thing that set us apart from the other comedy acts.


But it als also maybe secretly a little bit of a crutch. It's like, oh, we got the music here. It, I don't know. We All have a crutch though. We all have our crutches. Yeah. We all, I do the same things over. Like sometimes you're the things that you think, these are like little devices that I've created to save a set. When I was, I was, I just did a show with Bert at, not Savannah, Georgia. I forgot where we were. I don't remember. I know. 'cause you weren't There. You were in the south. Well, we called, I was in the south. You Called me. Right. And so j big big J org Yeah. I told you I bombed. Right. Yeah. So Big j Gerson, and it's about 10,000 people in the audience. Yeah. Big j Gerson has the set of the night destruction and also in the south.


And that's his people. What does that even mean? He's from Baltimore or something. I know he's From, he speaks their language. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like a kind of like a filthy white, can I say filthy white? You know what I mean? Yeah. He's not clean white. He's not Joe Malaney. Yeah. He's a filthy White. He's filthy white. Right. And I don't think he'd be offended if I said that right. I'm a filthy yellow. He's a great white. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a great white killing it. And I, I'm literally, I turned to Leanne Burt's wife. Yeah. And I go, I'm gonna, I'm gonna struggle. And she goes, no, you're fine sweetie. Love you. It's all about love these audiences. I go, I'm gonna, I'm gonna struggle. And I hear my name come, I'm going. And I go up there and dude, I struggle.


Oh shit. And then I started doing, I go, you know, I go, you know, I have a bag of tricks. Bag of tricks. Right. So this is, this is one of my, I don't want to reveal it, but I'm gonna do it. Do it. One of my bag of tricks is I'll do three minutes and then if somebody sits down, like when they went to the bathroom, I'll go, fuck, where were you? And they're like, I went to the bathroom. I go, I gotta start over. So I'll leave the stage, I'll run out and then restart my set doing the same jokes. And that usually kills, it did worse than the original true joke. They were like, we see through it. That's Almost if they said that, we see through your little antics, your little tricks. Right.


I did it all. What Could you have done? Nothing. Yeah. I bombed. What do you do when you're in a situation when you guys aren't being well received? Ah, No. They're always well received. No, there have been a couple times, but e especially If, you're going and playing festivals where there's a hundred thousand people there. Oh my God. That really came to see, you know, Metallica or whoever, you gotta win some people over. And what I do is, I al the mantra is don't forget to pretend to have a good time because it Why? Because If, you just stay in that. Just keep on like pretending like you're loving it and enjoying it. Eventually you will start to, and then, and then they'll, they'll, that's the hope and the dream.


And then they'll, they'll pick up on that energy and they'll start to enjoy it too. Because if you're suffering and, and you're, what did you say? Struggling. Struggling. Yeah. It's like, yeah, there's blood in the water. There's blood in the water. Dude. They can sense that they're like an animal. Yeah. Yeah. And, they can see your fear. Yeah. I tell people when they're doing the Tonight Show, I go, so, because because I saw, I'm not gonna name the name. Can I just whisper it? Yeah. Do that. Back in the day, I think before I did standup, I, I saw who we love. Yeah. He, He's Our homie do the Tonight Show. And he didn't do well. Even as a non-ST. Standup at the time. I went, oh shit, this guy's a legend. He is not doing well. Live TV's so hard. Right.


So what I'm, when I'm so what I tell you I can do. Yeah. You're going. Yeah. Yeah. It's a crazy

Is that something that you do or do you just kind of impro? I always go water. Water. What do you say? Yeah, cheese and potatoes. That's the cheese. And Cheese and potatoes. Cheese potatoes.

It Feels like a channel feed. Yeah, You're channel feed. But, but To be, let's be fair, the Channeling is for you to do a loan in your trailer right before. Oh, Martin Scorsese calls you to the set.


Wow. This is something that Leo Dekal will do before his Oscar winning performance. Yeah. In VA again. Once upon a time. Hollywood. In Hollywood too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love that movie. So, you know what? You're right. I, you know, I I I made fun of you just now I know youre not a channel. You're basic guy. No, just let's, let's be real. You're a basic guy with basic. Be nice.

He's got more balance in his life again. How many days sober Now? What are we talking? We're at like, we're at like nine months around there.


Wait, no more like six. The clapping S That's how I know he is not, but there's, there's something awry. Oh, no. It's because I'm not going to meetings. I'm not keeping track. Ah, Ah, Well, you go from nine months to six months. That's a three month gap there. It's A big gap. Well, I, it's a Summer. I was trying to remember what month it was right now. And because you usually, I'm just, I'm sorry. I'm not, I don't mean an argument and congratulations by the way. But my point being is, is that because I count days, you know exactly what days, You know how many days it's Been? Yeah, yeah. When you're going nine months, I mean six months. It's a little weird. No, Because I'm not happy about it. I'm not like thrilled about being sober right now. Mm. Right. Like, I'm not counting. Well Then go to a fucking meeting.


That is definitely the solution is to go to a meeting. Yeah. And We don't want to get into that right Now. Okay. Well, let's move on then. Anyway. You look great though. Congratulations. Get Carlos around applause. Celebrate Fucking wonder. Fucking wonderful. Hey, you're alive. That's all that matters. Right guys? Thank you. That is true. So can we talk about Borderlands or No? Yeah, let's talk about It. Oh, yes. The reason I'm here. Yes. Yeah. Just kidding. I've always wanted to be on your show. What? The movie that you guys did. Wait, Okay. We have a Conne, A three-Way connection. Right. You did the film together. Correct. My, one of my closest friends is a producer on the movie. So this, when he told me he was, she told me he was gonna get the role or they were gonna, whatever, you know?


And I, I auditioned. I auditioned And it was a cool, I was like, I knew before he knew. Yeah. It was cool. It was kind of a sweet little nugget of life. And I was like, oh, this is amazing. And then it's opened his world to all these great people and it's just been a, I saw the trailer looks fucking amazing. Mm. I saw it before they put it out, which I thought was really cool. But it looks rat. What's A bummer about it though is because I, you know, when when I found out you're in it? Yeah. But then I realized you're not gonna be there. Oh, so you were out in Bulgaria going, where the fuck is Jack? Black? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I realized, oh, he's clap track. He's the, This is bullshit. But we could still kind of work together. Yeah. We did one table read. Yep.


I remember that day you Crushed a zoom. A zoom table. Zoom. Yeah. But you crushed it. And can I tell, did I tell you what happened when we at that table? Or can I tell you what happened? Yeah. Alright. So, Jack, let's, I wanna be vulnerable and, and I want to be, you know, because I know sometimes people think I'm cool. Mm. And I got my shit together. Like, oh yeah. He's, he, he's got all the, you know what, There you are though. That's incredible. Look, zoom in. There he is. You got the smallest picture. But thanks for Putting on. Look, dude made the poster. Yeah. Guy made the poster. That's fucking Huge. It's Amazing. Yeah. Fucking amazing. So here's, so Who's the guy in the middle? Oh, Who's that guy in the dead center? Kevin Hart. Kevin Hart. That's Kevin Hart. That's right. With the Beret. Yeah. With the Bere Beret. Like you've never seen them before. Wow.


Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Special Forces Beret. Yeah. Ed Ramirez is a lot of, so anyway, I get the movie, and Jack, I'll be honest with you, I've never been in a movie with that kind of, this kind of cast before. Caliber Of stars. Yeah. It's just stacked, right? Yeah. And I, I, let me be vulnerable. Yeah. I'm nervous as fuck. Let's be honest. Yeah. Yeah. I don't dunno if you're remembering me. Act that a real nervous Yeah. You thought you might lose the job over the Zoom performance. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Not a chance. So this is what happens. Okay. Yeah. Chance, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. So what happens is, Eli's like assistant or something, calls me and goes, Hey dude, there's not gonna be a lot of people to table read at the Zoom. I go, okay. He goes, I'm, I'm gonna text you a list of characters that you're gonna be playing as well as the character that you're doing.


So I go, okay, And, they, and it's like 20 names, right? So now I'm panicking, like, ah, I could get fired from so many different angles now. Yeah. Right? Yeah. So I, for days, bro, highlight even the, you know what I mean, the sergeant or whatever, right. And I'm trying to memorize everything and like their point of view or whatever, Whatever. Right. Different sounding voices, different Different sounding voices. Right. I, I go, I, I have to kill here. Yeah. This is my shot. Right? So when we get on Zoom, like I'm there five minutes earlier and I'm looking at all the boxes. There's so many boxes, right? And in my mind, I was like, I don't know if I'm playing 20 parts, I'm just, you know what I mean?


It, it seems like there's Right. And I'm glad I did this. Two minutes before we're about to start, I text the guy again. I go, are you sure about these 20 names? It goes, oh no, I forgot to tell you, you are only doing two. Oh my God. So if I hadn't called, I would've been interrupting somebody. Yeah. You know what I mean? You would've been interrupting 18 people. I know. Thank God. I mean, would that've been bad? Oh yeah. I think that would've been bad. I'll tell you What was bad though, is that they made you rehearse 20 different roles. And really it was only two that you had to Yeah, it was me. Because you put in some hours it sounds like, and some stress lost a little sleep. They owe me money is what you're saying. Okay.


Yeah. Is that what they'll saying? We'll, Get a, we'll, what are we talking about here? Dude? Get a lawyer. Yeah. Oh no. Yeah, it was stressful. But you know, it's fine. I'll tell you what, when I found out you were in it, I was like, that's rad. And they're lucky. We are lucky to have you on that movie. 'cause you're fucking hilarious. Oh God Bless your cake. You can relax about the worrying about getting canned. They yeah. They're thinking they're lucky stars. 'cause you're killing it. Yeah. Yeah. It was also just a very positive experience. I'll tell you that right now. You know, what has currency that people don't really realize If, you like, kill it in like a, a social media post that has just as much, if not more like power in the industry than like having a zippy cameo in a major motion picture.


If, you fucking crush it like you do on the regular, on social media, on like podcasts or on like, interviews and other people's shit. That stuff, that stuff counts a lot. Yeah. But Jack here, I'm, I'm, I'm glad a lot Of eyeballs, a lot of clicks, Jack. I appreciate that. But, and I'll tell you the difference between me and Andrew Yeah. And the other podcasters. Right. The other podcasters. They understand that. But him and I, for some reason, and I know, I know you're like this, some of our dreams are still tied up with television and movies. Yeah. Because we're a little older, you know what I mean? And we're just, we were same. Right. So it's like, I think we gotta, I I I, I don't wanna talk, talk about your, I talk about my me.


I have to sort of, kind of, you know what I mean? Kind of unlearn that, you know what I mean? And find that this is the dream. Yeah. But I do we like the other stuff. No, we love the other stuff, but I'm just saying. But you are right. I, I think that it's great.

With an incredible duo. Sure. To take home the comedy Gold Olympic highlights with Kevin Hart and Keenan Thompson new episodes Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only on Peacock.


No, but I'm saying I Love it. I'm saying that it, it's, it's actually also working in the industry when a casting agency is a thing that really makes 'em laugh hard. Mm. It doesn't matter what the venue is. Right. They see you killing it in a, in a post. People get cast off of that just as much as anything else nowadays. I know, but you did it the traditional way. Right. You, I mean, you, you got a manager agent, you took acting classes. You, you know what I mean? You auditioned probably commercial. I mean, you kind of moved your way up probably. I don't know. Right? Yep. And there was like a clear pathway of a way to do it. And I think you and I were the same way, right? Or no? Well, yeah. For a little bit. And then the industry kind of changed. Yeah. It changed. Wait, Do you guys have a headshot that on the back has four different activities there?


A hundred percent. Yeah. See, we're old school like that. Yeah. Soccer. The Kids today, they don't have those headshot with the things of the Yeah. The skateboarding. Yeah. Yeah. Ken, Ken Ali not kick lip. The languages. I, I don't know any other language but English. But I would put like five things on there. I had eating Cereal was one of the pictures. I could eat. Cereal commercial. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. When we used to have to bring in those fucking headshot was so, it was so was demeaning and you they'd like throw it in a pile and you were like, that cost me $4. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. They'd throw it away. You know, you'd get stacks of 'em in your fucking car. I, I was around when your agent would call you and go, oh, you have an audition tomorrow. Okay, cool. Alright, come pick up the sides.


And so I would go to an alleyway, you know what I mean? And, they would have like a filing thing. Yeah. And I would have to look up Al Lee and pull out my, like, I'd have to drive there, you know what I mean? And there'd be like sometimes a line of other actors there. Once I learned that there were acronyms for agencies, I would make up fake acronyms of an agency. I would just, I'd type in three letters. It'd be like ccb, FCBF or whatever, CBF Creative Agency or whatever. Yeah. I did. They would never check. Why would they ever fucking even check? It was just like, the guy who was my manager was out of his studio apartment next to the Magic Castle. That's a hack. Yeah. That wow. It, I mean, it di it got me enough around where I got to sneak into shit.


But that's what you still have to, I have to staple your headshot to your resume or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing people would go is like, Fucking hated that. Hey, Are you, are you in sag? I'm am my points, yeah. I'm building up the points or whatever. Right. That was a whole thing. Oh yeah. If, you were in Sag or not, you know what I mean? If, you got it Is a catch 22. You couldn't Get a job unless you were in sag. But you can't get SAG unless you Get a job. Right. And then there's this mysterious thing called Taft hardly. I don't even the fuck that. Is that what I'm even saying it, right? Yeah. Taft. Yeah. Taft. Well, they merged after AFTRA and, and SAG merged. But Taft Hartley was how you got into That's what I'm saying, the backdoor. I said it. Right, right. Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, you did. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much. Inside baseball talk. But The truth is, if they, if the director really wants you, they'll find a way to get you into sag to do the movie.


Mm. Just costs a little more money. It's a little more hassle. But That happened. Mark Ellington, the guy that directed this, the first thing I ever did when the studio I worked at as a pa, I got this role to, to deliver Luke Wilson a pizza. And then they overshot and the pa I did 13 hours in a trailer, just like sitting, waiting, sitting, waiting. Like, excited, excited. And the PA came and was like, cutting your scene goodnight. And I was like, oh my God. Fucking killed me, dude. Yeah. And then Mark Pellington was smoking a cigarette, by the way that, that director, mark Ellington famously directed, if I'm not wrong, Jeremy Pearl Jams. Jeremy. I think that was Great song.


I think that's what he did, looked that up. But he was smoking a cigarette or something, or hanging out by the trailers. And he was like, oh, I heard they fucking cut your shit. I was like, yeah. And then I wanted to be like, didn't you cut my shit? Yeah. They, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where, where's they? And then he was like, we, we, we'll get you back, dude. We'll get back. Lie, lie. No, he was true. They brought me, no, brought me back as a hospital. Orderly. And. they gave me a line. I was like, sir, you can't be outta your Room. Wait, that's you. No, that's Mans the word. That's Jeremy. Yeah. That's Jeremy. Yeah. No, but he was cool, man. That was a fucking really rad thing. But that's, that was one, you need those little tiny moments sometimes to like, give you a little bit more hope. 'cause after that, I thought, fuck, man.


I was so excited to have one line to maybe get in the union to be able to get another job. And That's a huge thing. That dude did a Favor. You know, I got, you know, talking about that and about Borderlands. Sorry to bring it back. No, dude. But it made me think of a story about how I met Kevin Hart years before we did Jumanji together. And it was just sort of a general, general meeting. He was kind of new and up and coming. And he was going around. We were at the same agency, and he was going around meeting all the, the different people at the agency to just talk about maybe developing something. And we had a good like, meeting, just hitting it off, talking about things that we liked.


And then years later, I got that call to do Jumanji. And it was Kevin. I know it was Kevin that got me in into that room because even though I had a lot of success before Jumanji, I had in a little bit of a dip. And I was like, God, I gotta get another gig. And I remember thinking that, that Kevin Hart, he's a standup guy. He's a great guy. Yeah. He said we were gonna work together, and he went out of his way, I believe. And made it happen. Which is cool. Yeah. You, you even think you've been in dips. Yeah. That's the thing. It's a no matter how, how good it goes, this industry is a, is a fucking leviathan. And you never know when it's gonna end.


And you see it all the time. People get, get ejected off the rollercoaster. And it's such a fun job. And it's such a fun life. Mm. The name of the game is staying in it and you can feel it. And as soon, because like, if you're in, in a, like a wave of like, oh, I'm getting lots of gigs. This is going fucking great. It's gangbusters. And you can almost go like, fuck, I can't wait for a break. When is the Google calendar gonna be empty? So I can just chill? But then as soon as it gets empty. Yeah. Oh boy. And you don't have anything on the horizon. Yeah. There's a panic. Oh yeah. Wow. Ice cold water in the vein. It's like, oh fuck. I gotta get something. And Yeah. You get those moments. I think everybody has has. Well, I'm glad to hear that. We're glad to hear that you get 'em.


Yeah. Because I get 'em all the time. That's how We feel all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where I'm like, oh my God, I'm dead. Yeah. Know what I mean? I guess they don't like me. I guess the Ken Jong Randall Park show now. Okay. All right. I guess the Ronnie Chang. You know what I mean? You'll never fuck I fucking, fuck Ken. I'm out. I'm out. You know you're out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're out. Yeah. No, I know. You're right. Also, can I say this? I'm fine. I'm grateful. I'm so grateful. You should be. Yeah. And so happy and mind. Yeah. Life is good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Borderlands comes out August, what? August? Ninth. Ninth. Borderlands gonna come out August 9th. You must go see this movie. Yeah. If, if you're, if you're in a theater and you do see the trailer pop up, those look really good. You're in one, you're in two scenes. They cut.


You're in two scenes. We, we've got a scene together where I'm clap trap the robot. And in, in the bar. And you're in the bar. Oh, That's right. I remember now. I turned around. Now I was all pre-recorded. So maybe you heard my voice in the, when you were shooting it, or maybe you didn't. I did. I didn't hear It. Maybe someone I hear, hear. I did hear it. But you were in Bulgaria kicking is was it Bulgaria? It wasn't, but I love when you say it, I don't even know what Budapest, Budapest. Budapest. Budapest. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I also wanna talk about how I, just, something about Eli Roth. Yeah. Because you worked with him with the clock. Yep. Yeah. Right. And you worked with Kate before too. Yep. From that. Right. But I just, what I mean, you know, I've done some things and I just love that guy as a director.


'cause it doesn't, he makes you feel comfortable, man. Yeah. Really fun. Really fun to work with. Yeah. Yeah. And also good stories. Yeah. He's got good stories. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'll say this one other thing about the movie. It's got vibes that are kind of like, did you ever see Total Recall with Schwartzenegger? Yeah. Love. It's got that kind of vibes where it's a, it's another planet and it's, and it's kind of like a rough and ready, it's like a, a hard neighborhood world. And it's kind of like a desert. And it's squash buckling and it's death defying and kick ass. Lot of good explosions. So You saw the movie? Oh yeah.


Don't be jealous. It's not just because I got a sneaker peek. Yeah, yeah. I, yeah, I, I'm sorry. Yeah. He's famous. I know, I know. But I, he saw the movie. No, dude, He's a full on. But no, I saw it, but it still had the numbers on the bottom right. And, and the thing and the, the watermark. So I'd be in trouble. But you saw From beginning to end, I would've forwarded it to you, but I couldn't. It had the watermark. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You Do know he recorded it. He's been selling it. Oh, right, right, right, right. He's been bootleg. Right. Well, I'm glad you said that because I was, I don't know what the movie's gonna be like. It's gonna be great. We're all gonna go together. Yeah. Oh, You're gonna come. We're Gonna have a family outing. I think it's gonna be amazing. It's got that kind of road warrior, like post-apocalyptic. I'm excited. Bob Stewart. I'm, I'm really kind of excited about that.


Do you have anything else you wanna plug that, like, coming up? I did a, a, a little movie called Minecraft, but that's not gonna be until next Year. Oh, he did it based on the video game. I only do video games, dude, I tell you. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I just basically do whatever my, my sons tell me Now, what is Minecraft? How is that gonna be a movie? Exactly. Oh, that's, we have to figure it out. Well, It's like, not obvious. It's like, that can't be a movie. Can it? Yeah. Can it? Yes, it Can. It can. Wow. What's that gonna be like? Yeah, that's harder to describe. I'm not even gonna try. Oh, really? But it's a combo of live action. It's me. It's not a cartoon. Yeah. And, and animated like, like computer animated.


Like the world of Minecraft. Like you see it when you play it. Wow. So there's, there's human, it's like a, what's a movie? Another movie like that. Roger Rad tt. Yep. Tron Tron. Yeah. Closer to Tron. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's pretty rad. And it's pretty funny. I bet in my, my old pal, Jared Hess, who directed Nacho Libre. Is that the helm? Oh, wow. And Napoleon Dynamite too, right? Napoleon Dynamite. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If. you need him and Jason Momoa. It's me and him and Wow. And some great kids. And yeah. Look for that next year.

Well, you And there might be a tiny little bit of music, but I don't, I don't know what I'm allowed to say. It's one of those where they don't want you to talk to. Mm. You wrote some of the soundtrack. I mean, there might be some. I'm saying there might be. So I'm not gonna get trouble friends. Okay. We'll wait and see. Come Minecraft. But have you I I've never played the game because I do love seeing ice. I am building rocks and shit and playing fucking Minecraft. That might not be a song. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's gonna be pt. I dunno. I, I, I don't know.


Should I play it Minecraft? Yeah. Yeah. If You'd like. Because I like building world. I like building, but it's like so blocky. I, I don't even know how it works, Dude. It's really fun. But it is like learning a language. You gotta spend some time learning the world. Mm. I did it because my boys were, were deep into Minecraft a long time. And I wanted just to speak of their language. So I learned how to do it. And then I got into it. It's like architectural. Wow. You will be building buildings and digging tunnels and making, making progress in this. But Do you, do you raid other, is there like combat in it or what? There is fighting at nighttime. If. you get caught outside. Outside of a shelter.


You will have to scrape and scrap to survive. And there will be zombies. There will be exploding. Thingies. I can't remember what they're called. Creepers. Creepers. This is true. Their fighting should only be at night, by the way. That makes the most sense. Yeah. Daytime is for chilling out. What do you mean nighttime is for fight? What do You mean? Well, I don't fight. There shouldn't be daytime battles in these games. It should be only at night. It's, it's cooler. It's sexy. Or it's darker, I guess you're right. Yeah. Night fight dude. Night Fight. Remember Silent Hill? Yes. You guys are all remember, or no? Yeah. The video Game. Silent Hill When it first came out. Oh, It was so fucking scary. 'cause it was, you know, the first game where it was dark, like foggy And there was just creatures that would come run out at you.


And it was scary and jumpy, But, and you would have like a, I forgot what you had, but you had an apparatus. But, but there was an elementary school there And you were not supposed to go over there. Remember? I know, I know. Yeah. My parole officer says that. No, but no, but the, there's little kids like demons and stuff. Oh yeah. I found that to be so fucking scary. You know what I mean? There he is. Anyway. Looks Kind of like Michael Serra. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit like Michael Michael. He could play, he could play in the movie Silent Hill. Yeah. So Jack, I wanna say number one, what a pleasure to have you on. I truly, It was, I mean, because we didn't know how it was gonna go. Me neither.


I was scared. No, but It was A joy. Probably the best time I've had. Ah, I mean, it was since, Since MCG Within last week. Everything's d everything's different. But this was like, it felt like you were already a part of the ecosystem of podcasting. It felt like, you know, having Shane Gillis or somebody on Right. It just felt natural. And you know how to add information and you, you're silly. And it was just a blast. And If, you ever need to plug anything. You, you're always welcome back. Hey, how about this? If it ever comes a time when all three of us have empty Google calendars. Yeah. We get together and we fucking come up with some shit.

That'd be really nice. It'd be fun. Even if the Google calendars not I, Not him. I wanna be, I wanna be in a Western. I hear You. And I wanna be opium den guy. Wait a second. Well, is there an opium den in the Western? What do you mean? In Deadwood and all these town. Oh Right, Right. Like remember in fucking once in my time in America with Robert Dero. Oh wow.
