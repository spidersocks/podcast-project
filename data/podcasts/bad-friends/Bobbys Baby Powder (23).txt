People get bikes stolen. My bike got stolen. The first like three bikes I had here got stolen. So There's no lock. That's UNC Clippable in human history. Well, that's, let's invite invent that. Let's invent that. An UNC Clippable Lock. Yeah. Unc Clippable Lock. I almost called you yesterday. Yeah. Because I was walking on Larchmont. Okay. Our favorite. I was, yeah. And I was talking on the phone to a friend about the David Lynch documentary that they reposted the HBO Oh limo.


It's old, right? Yeah. But I rewatched it because I'd watched it when it came out. Yeah. Dude. Genius. He said so genius. He said something in there Made you cry. It just made me feel like what we talk about Right. With the Show that we're making. Give it to me baby. Give it to me. He Said, I realized at some point right, that life was about making art, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes. And sometimes a woman gets in there and I was like, that's dude, that's all his life was. Make art, smoke cigarettes. Drink coffee. Sometimes That's my life. Sometimes. Get a girl in there. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm saying what he's saying to you is, listen to the order. Make art first. Coffee and cigarettes debatable whether you should, I don't think you should smoke cigarettes anymore.


And sometimes a girl gets in there. But when you put the girl in front of the art, Are you, is this directed toward me? No, This is universal. This is a bra. This is David Ly. This is David Lynch. Yeah. What he's saying is, when you put girl in front of art, and girl represents not just woman, it represents noise, earth life, noise in front of art. Art. Bad art Go art bad. Art wrong. But if it goes art, cigarettes and coffee. Yeah. Yeah. And then Girl life. Mm. Art good. It's good. Art good. Yeah. I'm, I'm, that's exactly what he is saying. And he said it so profoundly. You're like, is it On HBO? It is. I wanna watch that. Right. Isn't it hbo? I think it was HBO Watch.


They reposted it. Yeah. But, so David Lynch, do you like his movies? What do you mean? I love his movies. What I don't like is people. Exactly. Do you know what I'm Try with Say? Yeah. Do you? I don't think so. No. Yeah, I think They don't understand. I think some people like David Lynch because of the abs abstract nature of film. And then some people like David Lynch because they really believe that everything was deliberate. I don't get that second part. I think some people really like it because not all those films were fucking perfect, quite flawed, if I'm being honest. A lot of them are quite flawed, super subversive and beautiful.


But like, I think some people like him because they like that it's weird. And some people like it because it's a lot of artistic choice. It's very, it's very deliberate is what I mean. I'm gonna tell you why I like It. I'll give you an example of what I'm Try with. Say, go ahead. Tell me. The example I'm Try with say is I think some people like Tarantino because a lot of his movies, for lack of a better explanation, involve violence and very hot, heavy, fast, throbbing film. It's very, it's a lot. Mm. Right. Which is why when someone talks about Once Upon a Time, they're like, I didn't like it till the end, till there was a lot of violence. Do you know what I mean? And then other people really like it because he's histor the way he tells stories.


Extremely specific. I love that movie. I love that movie. But it's stories. It's specific. That's my point is like, some people like Lynch because they understand. He's Try with tell this really beautiful, intricate story sometimes within, within, within itself. Some people like it 'cause they're like, it's fucking Lynch is out there, man. It's just fucking, it's like they're, they're just in fascinated with the idea that it's so unique. If you move, watch a movie, like erase your head. Right. This is the first time. And it used to scare me as a kid when I used to watch this movie. Well, it's a scary movie. Yeah. I get scared now. But There's these gaps between people's conversations. Yeah. And within those gaps, ga gaps, you hear like some electronical equipment or a buzzing or whatever.


And it's so awkward. And it's also so otherworldly almost, you know? But it's, there is a, a fear in there. Oh, You hear the, you hear the, yeah. You hear like the feedback of stillness, Like, how are you? And then you hear, and then there's literally a middle will go by pretty good. You know what I mean? It's just this weird way of, you know, and I, and I thought, you know, as a kid, I was like, I've never seen a movie like this before. You know, paced like this. Yeah. When you watch a Lynch movie, like Lost Highway, even I, I don't, I don't understand. Do you know what that movie's about? I have no idea. Yeah. But you're still watching it because it's just like every scene, there's just something that's completely different. And you can't, you can, there's no way you can go.


Like you said, sometimes you watch a movie, you go, I know where this is going. Yeah. There's no way to do that with a Lynch movie. Yeah. This isn't like a, his, his stuff isn't, he never worked with Kevin Hart. We We, yeah. So funny. Well, just Kevin. Yeah, yeah, Exactly. You know what I mean? Is like The, the Rock and Kevin Hart and David Lynch's. Oh my God. Imagine It's just David Lynch's lack of commercialism is Yeah. Was, was very on purpose. You know what I'm saying? Some people were like, he's like, I got it. I like, like were you, well, were you, are you a, were you, are you a Twin Peaks fan? I am. Yeah. So that's a big point of contention. A lot of people weren't I See. And a lot of people who were hardcore Lynch people that I know didn't like it. And vice versa. I know people who are like, didn't really love David Lynch. I fucking love doing peaks.


So do you know Jack, the guy that played Razor Your Head? We could find what his last name. Jack the actor. Meyerhoff? No, the guy with the hair burn Nance. Jack n So Jack Nance Right. Was in era your head. But he did, he was in Twin Peaks. He's been in a lot of Lynch movies. Right? Yeah. Do you know how he died? Fuck. Can I guess? Yeah. Yeah. Guess. Was it Autoerotic?

Okay.

Cell service or it was a phone service. Okay. There was a storm or something. And his girlfriend was gonna kill him. Kill herself. Right. And then the phone cut out. And by the time he, you know what I mean, found she killed him herself, his girlfriend. Right. And then he gave, it comes back to LA and he's at a hotdog store somewhere in North Hollywood somewhere. And some gang members beat him to death with a pipe. What did they have to do about the girlfriend killing herself? I Don't know. I just, there was a Oh, Okay. Okay. Yeah. It was a fun little extra, you know what I mean?


Thing they Beat him to Death. But there was a documentary called, you Don't Know, Jack and David Lynch directed it, I think. And it's about his life. This guy. So sad. Dude. Just go to Jack N's death. Yeah. Or whatever. I want to. Yeah. I wanna, I I, I might've got fucked it up. But On Nance launched with friends Leo Bull Gani and Katherine Case had a visible crescent shaped bruise under his eye. And when asked about it, he relayed him story about a brawl outside of Winchell's Donuts. Love Win. That's A donut place. Not now. That's a good donut place store. That morning, he went home complaining of a headache. Nance developed a, a subdural hematoma resulting in his death the following morning, found his body on, they found about in the bathroom floor of his apartment in South Pasadena, California. Later that day, an autopsy revealed that his blood alcohol content was 0.24 at the time of his death.


That's Probably did it. Yeah. But initially ruled as resulting from blunt force trauma. So Right. He had a subdermal, It wasn't a hotdog place. It was a donut place. And then could, is there any way you can look up his, because his, Check it out. It wasn't a hotdog place. A donut place. And he drank himself to death. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, 0.24 is fucking insane. But this is a guy that was, that's insane. That not, not in anything bought Lynch movies. He relied on Lynch. Right. And then when he put 'em on Twin Peaks, it's like saved him for money and stuff like that. But like he, 'cause he was a serious regular on Twin Peaks. Wow. But he never really, you know, point made it. Yeah. Two, Four. Do you realize that's, isn't that 2% of your blood? Correct. What, what, what's the most you've had in your body, you think?
