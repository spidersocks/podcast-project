So guess what I did used? I no went to A meeting. I, Oh, it took my phone out. I have this me meetings app on my phone. Yeah. I went to a meeting Good. And I felt good. Then what'd I do the next night? I went to another meeting. Good. And then there was a kid in the movie that was also sober. Good. I took him to a meeting. Okay. And then I went to Dallas to do what's his name's show? Dr. Phil. Dr. Phil. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Dr. Phil. And I know you have some feelings about that too, that we can share. We can share later. Yeah. Yeah. You can share whenever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But something magical happened. I was at a mall. I was planning to go to a meeting, but I went to a mall first to get some shoes.


I was walking around and I see a kid and he has these gigantic throat stab wounds in his throat. Stab wounds. Yeah. Yeah. Jesus. They're super thick. Right? Why are you laughing? It's just insane. How do You know they're stab wounds? Because I asked him, oh. Oh, Are those stab wounds? Yeah. I go, dude, what the fuck? He goes, yeah. I, You know, I, when I was super like using, I used to stab myself in the neck. And he goes, but he, he teared up and he was like, you got me sober. No, that's awesome. And I go, what? And he goes, I mean, you talk about sobriety. And, and then I go, what Do you do tonight? I go, oh. I go, how many meetings have been going? He hasn't been meetings in years. Mm. And he goes, The throat stab guy didn't go to meeting.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would assume he would be on track. So I go, You know, you, you, you, you, you, you're not doing it for you. You're doing it to help others. Yeah. So I, I said to meet me at this random meeting, and he showed up Good. He sat next to each other. And I think he, there was a shift that happened. Oh, you're smiling. No, I just think it feels good to hear this happened. I think this is very Important happened. And then afterwards, we, I sound his body. I knew it Because he wanted a tattoo. I knew it. Of my signature. Yeah. Are you right On the chest? He got a tattoo Of my, of, of my, of signature on the chest. Oh boy. Yeah. And then he got me two pants. He bought you pants from The store that Yeah. He, he works at a store. I like, I I, I like these pants, but, and so, I don't know.


I didn't get 'em, But you got me two brand new pairs. And then Can I say something? Yeah. I mean this, when I say this, I think the work that you do in the sober world is, that's Not what I'm saying. Can I just finish? I think it's extremely important. And I think there's a ton of people that listen to this show. They'd either use, used to use, have trouble, have thoughts. And I think it's a great world to put our audience in to know that. Are You being real right now? Do I sound, I feel There's a good joke coming. I'm not, yeah. Okay. I think it's a beans On toast or something. Is there a beans at toast? There was. Okay. Oh, I know it was, no, I think it's a beautiful important thing to do as a child of addiction.


As someone whose best friend is an addict whose friend. We have a lot of friends that have lost their lives to it. I think it's important that you do stuff like that. I really mean it. I think it's imperative to the future of people who are struggling to hear you. A famous guy who, who by the way, what? You guys are laughing. All right, I'll stop. No, I'll stop. No, I I I'm telling you why the disrespect from Andreas. It's insane. How did I know I'm being fucking serious? Yeah. Because literally when you're saying something very sincere and heartfelt. Yeah. And real. And I, dude, I felt it. Dude. I'm trying to be, Dude, I'm connected to you. This is what I see from this guy. You're Mocking me. No, Him. This is what and Andreas is doing for like 10 seconds.


It's fine. Looking at something, doing a smirk. Okay. And I'm going, what the fuck? Dude, what I'm Saying is boring and I don't care. No, I Love it. I Guess it's boring. You Think it what? Because I think it matters. I think it's an important part of life. You know, it's the same way when somebody comes up to me or emails us and says, Hey man, I was gonna kill myself last year. My mom died in June. My dad left us. And listen to the show makes me feel good. These moments change my life. I think it's fucking important. They make me feel like what I'm doing when I'm sitting on an airplane and it's 40 minutes late and I'm bummed out and it's freezing and they lost my bag, and I'm gonna be late to the thing and I'm pissed off and I didn't eat. I go, oh, this is all worth it. Because somebody gets joy from our thing.


I know it. I know. And you give people joy by giving them hope in the process of comedy. I know what you're gonna say next. Babes on toast. No, I'm bobbylee mom. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I think there's gonna be an uprising. I think there's gonna be an uprising. And I mean, this's going to be an uprising of the lower and middle class. And they are going to go after the top tier. The guys who own Amazon, who own Microsoft, the guys who control all of these big monolithic corporations.


I think it's, I think it's gonna happen. But if you see, I think it's gonna happen. These, These town halls now. Right. You can see the anger And you, you're seeing people that normally, normally wouldn't protest. Yeah. And say things just, oh, screaming and, and, and interrupting And, you know What I mean? They're, they're, they're in rage mode. People are, people are gonna fight back. It's gonna happen. So get ready. 'cause it's coming. I thought about that, but let's get a trailer. No, no. We're fine. Okay. We gotta get seeds. We, We will get The seeds. Okay. I've always wanted seeds and be wanted to watch 'em grow. Yeah. We'll, we'll get some seeds. You can do that. Can You do it? Can we, can we get seeds though? Oh my God. Erwan sells seeds. Great. Yes. We'll buy 'em from Erwan. No, but We gotta get seeds that I seen 'em on TikTok a lot.


You see TikTok seeds? What Are Yeah. Like a variety. Like a variety pack. Yep. All I see on TikTok now is people telling me that you're fat and you're lazy, And you need to get up and make money. That's what all TikTok is all like. You wanna optimize your day. Yeah. You think your day starts. Yeah. When you wake up, by the time you wake up. I've done six jobs. Yeah. I've had six jobs. I, I, I impregnated four women and I tripled my bank account. Yeah. While you're sleeping. That's what I see on Instagram. TikTok now is getting boring. Year, Two months ago, I fucking searched animals with Down syndrome. Mm. And now I just keep getting like, every other one is like koala work.


You know what I mean? It's crazy. Oh my God. That's an Yeah. I, I know. I I do it. And they're cuter when they have it. Well, The, the dog, the koala is look At the koala with this little fat tongue stick. Get out. I didn't know that they got down Syndrome. I think they all do. Yeah. Anyways. Seeds. Let's go back to seeds. Dude. That's me. There I am. That's my kid. Yeah. You want seeds? I think there's gonna be come, come to a time when peak oil, when peak oil happens. Peak oil, You know, peak oil When we run out of oil. No, it's not. When we run out, we get to the top precipice of where oil Right.


We can get it. And then the demand is gonna be too high. High because the, the, the pop the, the world is growing population wise. And we have bigger, like, we have empires not like India and China. Right. And so when it, we can't have the demand, that's when things start breaking down. Mm. Because fossil fuel isn't something that you can just make. It's just there. It ex Well, and then once you're done with it all, it's not there anymore. We'll find something by then. Well, hopefully. But my point is that after peak oil, and then all of a sudden we can't get blueberries from Mexico or whatever. You know what? I, You don't need 'em. Okay. Okay. Then you can't get plantains from Brazil. But look at this. It suggests between 2028 and 2035, I will say we will find a continuation of alternative solutions when we're put in a corner.


Humans do great things. Have you seen, by the way, Japanese are using kinetic energy to, to, to now try to power cities, entire cities. They have these things on the ground that you walk on just regular sidewalks. And by stepping on it right there, there's they're triangles. They're No, no, no. Do the one that's triangles down that one. Wow. So these are, these are kinetic energy walkways. And they're putting them all over Japan. When they walk, they capture the kinetic energy, which turns into electricity, powering an entire city. Amazing. So the proposition is that this will be all over major cities. New York, Chicago, Miami, where there's a lot of foot traffic. And it will end up powering the city itself.


Look, dude, the smartest people in the world are continuing to work on great shit. I'm not saying, I Just don't know. I mean, why don't we have it now? Then Everything takes time. I know, but they're making it for themselves though. But Jimmy Carter, back when he was president, was talking about peak. Let's move to Japan. He was talking about peak oil back then. I know. And this is a danger. I know. But look, it's not happened yet. We keep putting shit off. Look, dude, we're all dead. I got so many microplastics. I know. I pissed a Lego yesterday. I know, I know, I know, I know, I Know what I mean. It's like, it's fucked. You know, whenever I go to eat sushi now, they're like, yeah, you get too much sushi. It's, you're gonna blank, blank, blank. Well, fine. I like the sus. Mm. I like sus. I'm gonna keep eating poison fish from the sea Drinking this. You get a little microplastic. Right. Again.

The way that we, okay, we were going, we were going to try to get a car to go to the airport and there was traffic, like crazy traffic. 'cause they're, they're doing something to the expressway again in Chicago. And these people were waiting outside of the hotel to get autographs from There were the, the hockey team was in town and the LA Kings were staying there. Mm.
