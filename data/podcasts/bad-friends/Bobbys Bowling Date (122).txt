And apparently it's legendary Tom Cruise cake. It's called Tom Cruise Coconut cake. Okay. So, so when I went to that beef party, it was there where I saw Charles, there was six Tom Cruise cakes, and they made an announcement, Tom Cruise cake.


They bring that out, right? And I ate it. I'm like, It's pretty good. Yeah, that's fine. But then Burt brings it out. He goes, you can't believe like they as if it was from Tom Cruise's asshole.
