And I'm just like, I'm, so, I'm on my phone and I'm like, I, I think I'm on Instagram, whatever, and scrolling. And there was like a little scene of Timothy Chalamet Love, I love him. Great talented guy in the new Bob Dylan movie.

(34m 39s):
Mm. And he, and, you know, he was singing. I was like, dude, that's pretty good. Yeah. I, I might watch it. So I turned to the barber. I go, dude, this Bob Dylan movie. He is like, he's like, who? He go, Bob Dylan. He's like, no, what? Yeah. And I go, how old is this gentleman In his twenties? And I, he told me that I could even say his name is Ray. He even said I could say his name because that's how I was gonna talk about it. Okay. So then I go, wait, wait, dude, Ray, are you, you know, you don what I wanna say? Yeah. You, You Batman? Yeah, yeah, Yeah. And he goes, no, dude, I'd never heard of him. I go, alright, hold on. Fucking the barber next to him. I go, so dude, Ray doesn't know who Bob Dylan is. Like, she goes, oh, I like his paintings.

(35m 20s):
And I go, No way. Yeah. I swear to God. And I go, you never get His paintings. She Goes, oh no, that's Bob Ross. She says, right. I stood up, went around the whole barbershop. No one knew who he Was. No way. Yeah. And in my mind then I call McCone and I go, I'm sorry dude. You're a part of this generation. I go, do you please tell me you know who Bob Dylan. Do you know who Bob Dylan is? No. See, that's what I'm saying. And it's a travesty. How did you get the Bob Dylan haircut? Cut. Hey, don't get don't don't get mad. Shaka Shaka Shaka Shaka. Okay. He looks so much like Bob Dylan. Yeah. Yeah.

(35m 60s):
So you don't know who he is. What's a, what's a popular song? Oh my God. Like A rolling, like a Rolling Stone. Okay. Going in the wind. Yeah. I'm trying to think of what she would know. What, what rapper has used a Bob Dylan song and remade it. Hey, Mr. Tam man, play a song for me. No, the Man In Me is in the Big league. But that he didn't write that He was a cover, I think. Yeah. No, he wrote that. But people covered his Oh, people covered it. That Yeah. Yeah. The Man In Me Will Do you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Almost. I want You and that song. I want You. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great song. Anyway, Bob Dylan, it just in terms of the people that are living on planet Earth, right.

(36m 40s):
That like, you know what I mean? Have like cognitive reasoning, you know what I mean? And eyeballs. Right. Eyeballs. We, he's like The Beatles as Big and the Rolling Stones in the sense of the impact. Musically, he's a huge figure of the late sixties. You know what I mean? He's just a, a musical icon that like, it's like a Sinatra. Like I'm not, I might not be a Sinatra fan, but I, I'm well aware of who he is. It's, he's that type of character. And no one in your generation knows, except for McCone, knows who the fuck he is. And it dri I don't, and maybe I'm like, get off my lawn. I think I'm that old now. I'm not. So McCone, you're, I called him to see if I was the old man going, you know what I mean?

(37m 22s):
Oh, the kids of this generation and complaining. I'm seeing him on Wednesday at the bowl. He's alive. Yeah. But I mean, is that shocking to you, Bob Dylan? Yeah. Sadly. Oh, I get that. It's, he hasn't been as like, popular through culture, through Time. The Beatles will all, you know who the Beatles are, like the Beatle. It's just, it, some things kept up their culture. Yeah, yeah. Or kept up in culture. Bob Dylan probably didn't. Yeah. I've Never Heard anything. Yeah. This makes sense. It oddly makes sense to me. Okay. Because, because because you don't see him again on stuff. He's not like on a fucking Pepsi Commercial. Except for the fact that Tim De Shale Manne is playing him in a, his own movie.

(38m 3s):
No, I, I agree. I'm saying I get why young people don't see him. 'cause he is not in culture. The Beatles are still in culture. You Think this is gonna help? A hundred percent. I think it's gonna help. Yeah. Yeah. And then at Norton Junior plays, what's his name? That country guy. What's his name? He was so good. I forgot his name. The trailer was good. It looks so good. It looks so good. Does he sing Timothy shit? Yeah. Wow. And that was like, it's his voice, right? I think so. I think it's his voice. Whoa. I was like, whoa. This guy's talented. It makes me Mad when people are that talented. I know. Me too. Well, we, we don't have any of that. Austin Butler. Let's try to sing. Roll, roll, roll your boat Gently.
