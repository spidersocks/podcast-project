That's all he had. You know why? That's what the American government created the $2 bill. What? For dollars. Fucking, fucking the Fuck. And people don't realize that. Yeah.


They created it right during the Vietnam War. They did. Yeah. And it, they're so hard to cash in because they're rare. They're very rare. It's a trick almost. It's so the process goes, I kick ka. Right. And they frame 'em, they always frame 'em keep I actually have a lot of 'em. If you want some. Well, how did you get so many? Kirk Fox? Oh, he's, oh, that makes sense. King Of $2. Fuck you.

Jesus. Correct. All I do on this, I, God, all I do is set us up for material and joke. Yeah. Bam. Bam. Go ahead. Unreal. Unreal. Today. I wish we had a buzzer. Okay. But anyway, so explain to us what hope for, what Is it? Hope Core on TikTok. It's always within a soft, like, peaceful audio. And then the video is like mountains or like beautiful scenery.


And there's always like quotes about like That. That's not, that's not it. What is it then? And the quotes are always like, like hopeful. And that's hope Core. Yeah. That's not it. But anyway, what Is it Then? It's a, it's a lot of, it's a montage of videos that make you feel like hopeful. And so, but, but they include some of that. But they mostly include like, soldiers coming home or, you know what I mean? Or a dog, you know what I mean? Yeah. Or or friends reuniting and stuff like that. Right. So, but here's the thing. When I watch Hope Corvid, are you doing this board thing now? Are you mad about, are you mad about the Steve Wozniak two Dollar Bills thing? I'm, I'm listening. No, there's something going on in your, I can see you processing Steve Wozniak.


Let's, how about this? Let's pause Hope Core. Let's go back to the $2 bill. So tell us about Steve Wozniak. I'm Listening. Go ahead. Tell us about, I'm so curious now. I don't wanna hurt your feelings. What happened? So, Steve Wozniak, did You get some pussy last night? No. No. You in a good mood. 'cause you got a little Pussy. No, no, no. So Steve Wozniak it because he's Off Ozempic. Yeah. So Steve Wozniak, Go back on it. So Steve Wozniak, he prints his own two Dollar Bills. Hey. Does he really? I know you're the one that told us. I had no idea. Okay. How did you know about this? Because You told us this five minutes ago. I did. Yeah. I've never heard of this before in my life. This what you're doing is very interesting. I've never seen you do this style of comedy. Wait, no. What Of complete denial. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, yeah. It's A reversal. Go back to Steve Wozniak, please. Why are You obsessed with Steve Wozniak?


Oh, okay. Okay. So let's go back to Hope Core. Yeah. That's so strange. We're talking about Hope Core. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very odd to bring that up. Well, what Are you doing right now? Dude? Such a, this is an interesting, weird thing. What's you two right now? It is very weird and it's kind of pissing me off. Is it really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's going on? Well, I'll tell you why, because you, you put a halt to some of the things I say sometimes. Do I? Yeah. And when I do it to you, right? You have a nervous breakdown in your mind. Do I? Yeah. You did what? Your face woke got all pale. And when we're talking you were like this like, like Yeah, yeah. Okay. You were talking to yourself.


What was I saying? Like, I Thought that Oak Court thing was gonna Be a good idea. You Know why? The way Bobby did that was on Kong four. And I just, you know, this Is fucking weird. Is this your internal monologue or mine? What You're, I was reading your, it Sounds like it's yours. Reason. Your what? See, this thing you're doing, I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get the resentment out. So, because I don't wanna continue the show without, oh, see This thing? Oh, I've never seen one. I'm in. Good. Have you ever Seen Him do this? Good spirit? Have You ever seen him? It's a new chair. Do a fucking Fentanyl nod. That's the new chair. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. It's like this federal nervous, Get a new chair. I get a new chair and I'm feeling good. Okay, good. So, so anyway, the two Dollar Bills Are, you Try with Rock in, you Can't rock in new chair.


Yeah. I'm sorry. Steve Wozniak. You know what I mean? He created, he built a machine and $2 fucking bills. You know. So anyway, Dude, watching you not in Ohio, not be able to rock in that chair is so funny. Yeah. Don't get jealous. 'cause daddy be rocking. Yeah. Look, you Oh, You think you could thrust better than me? Dude, I can thrust you, dude. Dude. Okay. Anyway. Alright. That's enough. So, I've been watching Hope Core videos. Honestly, you and I have sent them to each other before. I do actually love them. Yeah. But the Thing is, is that make me Cry At the end of the day, at, after every video, I could think to myself, I would not react like that. Like, for instance, friends that have been seen 25 years or 30 years, they, they cry. They hug.


Dude, if you and I were separated for 15 years and then all of a sudden reunited, Oh, I would cry. I would absolutely cry. A hundred percent. 15 years. That's so long. I would cry too. No, you fucking would. No you wouldn't. I think I would cry too. It's fine if you wouldn't. I just definitely would. It would depend on why I was gone for 15 minute years. Like if I was in an internment camp. You know what I mean? I think that there's a lot of like, emotions that would come up. Like, oh my God, I'm seeing people for the first time. I haven't eaten either. Well, why did you go in the first place? What did you do? Yeah. Were you working? I said I, I lied. I was Japanese. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. You wanted that happens. Just wanted Free rent for a while. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, I, I, I don't think, I think I would be like, oh. Like I would be like, if I see somebody for a friend of mine for 30 years, I'd be like, oh, that's it.


Okay. Well, I I think that's the end it At the end of the show. Yeah. When this show is done. Yeah. When we stop shooting the show. Yeah. Let's not see each other for 15 years. And then we'll see what it's like. Let's see if the payoff is worth it. Mm. I'm down. Okay. But here's another thing I wanna say. 30 even maybe 30 Years. Okay. Let's try. Can you get there? No. No. You can die. No, he's, first of all, he's not You. You know, can I, Bobby's Gonna live. I already told you. I spoke to my, I spoke to my, I've never Regretted something more in my life Than what Been calling you out on the $2. Steve, the Steve Wasn acting today. I've never regretted something more. It was very funny. No, no, No. I can see your eye. I've never Oh my God.


Fucked up, dude. Well, I can't believe that you're, It's Insane. Oh my God. So anyway, but here's another, I love you so much. Here's another hope Cor thing and I don't ever wanna not see you. Okay. So there's, you know, the soldier coming home, soldier comes home. Yeah. Surprises his 8-year-old kid at school. He's blindfolded, right? Yeah. Sometimes it's blindfolded. Love those kids. Freaks out cries Daddy jumps on top. Right? Yeah. But my dad, I Then I always think to my, I'm home. Right? I'd be like, ah, you know, I would've like run, you know what I mean?


Yeah. You don't wanna be near that. Yeah. So It's like I, whenever I see Hope core videos and I relate it to my own live, they wouldn't happen. Bring Up a hope core so we can watch one and maybe it'll inspire us in a different way. The ones with the words I think are great. Yeah. Right. Oh, this is happy Birthday. Here we go.

That's what I don't like about it. The video of it. All the video. Yeah. Look how good I am. But let me say something the, I see a lot of dudes don't tip and, and give money. So maybe it's gonna force people to give money, I guess. I mean, what, what's the nicest thing you've done and nobody knows? 'cause it wasn't recorded. Nobody knows. You never really talk about it. What's, well, but If I talk about it now, then people are gonna know. Well, What's a good moment for you? So one time, and this really happened, I was at a seven 11.


The one right down the street. This one right here. Okay. Right, right. And there was a homeless man and he had a bunch of garbage in his, you know, like clothes, not garbage. You know what I mean? Yeah. But on top of his like wheel, what do you call It? A a like a cart. Like a cart Grocery cart. Like a cart. Yeah. Yeah. He had an album. Not a, not a a record album. An album. A photo. Oh, right. And I, it was funny that you just didn't leave with photo album. It is weird to be like, he had an album. I'm like, oh shit, he was a music. He's like, no, no, No, no. But when I opened it, I did open it because there was nothing in it. Oh My God. There Was no pictures in it. No photo. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't open it to put my headshot.


And like, here you go. It's funny. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But no. So I left a hundred bucks in there. That's, I opened it. I, I put it in there and I, and I closed and I left. And I never said anything. That's, I Love that. I've done little things like that before. I Love That. What about you? One time, one time I got cash from a gig. I was working and it was a pretty substantial amount of cash. And I gave, I gave the envelope to a, to a person that I, I saw used to see a lot in my old neighborhood. Oh, That's Cool. Yeah. The he didn't, wasn't like a big thank you. I was, shit that's, I was like, that was a lot of money, man. Alright. I like, I actually was like, did you? 'cause he was like, oh, thanks man.

And I thought it was the holiday season. I thought this is a, it was when I used to live in West Hollywood. Mm. I saw this guy all the time and I thought, this is gonna make his fucking, this is gonna make his fucking holiday. He probably has family he can't see. Or you can buy gifts now. And he kind of, he was just like, oh, thank you so much. And he kept holding it and he didn't really like look at how much. Yeah. So I waited a little bit to be like, what's in there? Like a, you know what I mean? Like a parent on Christmas, like open it up. Alright. So when I, when I did Gutter Muckers that movie. Yeah. So I did a movie in Montana, Butte, Montana with Eleanor Kerrigan Love and Leslie Jones Love.

So there's a theater in town and we called the theater and like, we're in town. They're like, yeah, we sold all of 'em out. Of course. Okay. There's no comedy club there. And at the end we gave the money to the crew. That's so Cool. And, and when you're doing that many shows, I mean, you're talking about almost eight, $10,000. You know, what's a lot of money? A lot of money. Right. Only two crew members thanked me Fuck off. That's it. Yeah. And What, and I would even walk by like the, the sound guy and go, Hey, what's Up? As he's miking you up.

Well, 'cause I used to give him money all the time, so maybe he just thought it was just whatever. But I would give him money a lot when I walk home from the store. I would give him money. I saw the same, it's the same guy. It's, he's probably still fucking there. He watches the Show. What have you guys done? Nice. Well, When I first moved to LA I lived by this.

Bobby will see a fan, see him in public somewhere and can tell that they wanna say something. This is, I'm being genuine. I'm being honest. Okay. And if they're look too nervous or whatever, he'll make eye contact with him on purpose and go over to them to like, make them feel comfortable to say hi. Mm. You'll deliberately I've done that. Yeah. You will do that a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's very nice. 'cause a lot of times people will wanna say hi, but they don't have the courage or the balls or the, or the fucking, you know, or, or just don't know what to say.


And then you'll walk up to 'em and just give 'em a hug. Or you'll smack 'em, you like to hit people. You'll go, what's going on man? Whatcha are you doing? Fucking, what are you doing? Yeah, I did that. Yeah. You'll crack 'em a little bit to shake 'em up. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And people like that. I think that's a nice thing to do. I think that's a sweet thing that people like.

What do you mean Born identity? What do I do that's born? So what you do, sometimes you'll wear a cap. I'm Jason Bourne and we're at the airport and you'll put your hat down like this and you walk and this is when this is you going, I don't want, Yeah. Sometimes I just wanna be, sometimes I just wanna be alone. I, I, I, I, there's all these little clues about him. I know it's The, it's the Leo. I do the Leo. Yeah. I do the Leo. So there's little clues that he does. I go, okay, he doesn't wanna be talked to or he's in a thing or this and that. Yeah. Sometimes I'm just in, if I'm in emotional mood, if I'm depressed, I just don't wanna say, because Then I'm in your photo like this, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I'm low in your photo. I'm sorry.


And I don't wanna fuck up your photo. Yeah. So it's like, you know. Yeah. I'll, I'll, I'll, yeah. Let's say hi. And then, but I do love saying hi to the fans. I just, some days when we're tired and we're traveling, it's hard when someone's like, come here, get a photo. And you're like, okay. Yeah. And you look like shit. And you feel like shit. And you haven't eaten or slept. What's your nice thing? Well, in the Philippines, Oh fuck. Oh, Here We go. Jesus Christ. No way to prove it. Yeah, can, yeah. Right. There's no tracking record. Yeah. Yeah. Also, can you do it in a first country? I'm planet of Hth. When I look at Hoff, the Antes, you know what I mean? I used to give them free hoofs. Those Ps I'll tell you those antes, they love that. I know You love it. Yeah. Okay. In the, when I met Z Zou, the third sun god of the rotating orb.


Yeah. Yeah. What did you do in the Philippine? What Did you do in the Philippines? My friend who, who's gay, he came, he came out, he came out of the closet to his parents. But then his parents were very like Catholic and very religious. So he, they kicked, so he kick So they kick him out. Yeah. And then he had nowhere to go. So I asked my mom if I, he could stay in our place. And then he stayed in. That's nice. That is nice. That's nice. I'm not gonna have a, by the way, when you said out of the closet, immediately, it's like my, my gay friend come out of the jungle, know no closets.


There's no closet. Whatcha are talking? There's No closet. Yeah. There is no closet. There's No closets in the Philippines. So what do they come out of? We have just like a table. Yeah. He comes out, they come a table. They make the gay guys get on a table. Yeah. Announce to everybody. Okay. I'm gay. So raise your, Raise your hand if you're mad. Yeah. Yeah. So You house this man who needed somewhere. And that's very nice. 'cause of a closed-minded family. Now is his family still disown him? Yeah. They still hate him. Yeah. But that's gross. That's gross. I, IIII don't think you're, it's real. Oh, I like, Yeah. I, I'm gonna tell you why you Think it's a lie. I think it's a lie. Why? Yeah, because you, because I've been out there how many times?


A bunch of times now. Yeah. And the gay culture, it's out. It's out. But, so let me talk. Okay. Okay. Let me talk. It's almost like it's so socially acceptable there. Right. It's very hard to believe that anybody would be offended by it. Say mom And dad. Even that it's like, because So when we do my talent show Right. The gays come out. Oh yeah. Do they not? Yeah. Right. And they compete. Yeah. Right. I've seen their families come out. I've never seen a dad or a mom while their son was performing who was gay, went. No, we don't. No, they're clapping. Right. Yeah. It's just, this is an open society.


And, and it's okay Jules. Right. Look at me right now. I'm not, it's it's lying. Ju look at that. Not lying. Yeah. That's everybody there. Is that your friend? Yeah. That's everybody there. So that's just The Philippines. Just be honest with me. I'm not No, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Because you're being very defensive right now. And you're yelling. I swear. I swear. You don't believe in God. Gay marriage is still illegal in the Philippines, so it's not, Thank God I shouldn't Clap for that. No, no clap. So sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Gay marriage is still illegal. Yeah. But, but culturally it's not. Culturally. Yeah. A lot of people accept them and, but it's just this parents Look at, look at them. Is that your family photo?


Yeah. Wait a minute. Go to, honestly go to what, what is, what is, do you think there's a higher percentage of gay men in the Philippines than in other Countries? No. I just think that it's, I, what I love about the Philippines is that it's such an open culture in that way where it's like nobody cares. No one cares. But it's Like here, that's like here, no one gives a shit that you're gay here. Yeah. Unless you're, you do drugs and then they still kill you. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. Well, right. According to the 2013 really updated Philippines young adult fertility and sexuality started, 2% of Filipino men identify as gay. Survey found 96% of young people in the Philippines identified as heterosexual. So it is still embedded in this scariness of the society. Maybe you're right then. Okay. I believe You. What's the percentage of gay men in America? It's gotta be four. Yeah. Four and a half. 4.7. Now 8.5 adult women identify as gay.


Lemme say something that's so fake. What is going on here? I think, do you think it's this Cultural? Because it should be. I think we're all human beings. It should be across the board. Well, It does say, look, I read it wrong. It does say 44.7% of adult men identify as LGBTQ plus. So it could Be, oh, it could be anything that Encompasses everything that could say like, yeah, I'm asexual, I'm, we Try with just do gay, not lgbt. That's What I'm saying. Gay men on earth. 3% of men identify as gay or homosexual worldwide. Oh, that's Good. That's a pretty good, a good number. What would it be? What would it, why is it good? Is it good or bad? Is just a number. What's good about it? I think it's a healthy amount. And Like, we're drafting gays. That's the healthy Amount of gays. I, we gotta get our gaze up.


It's a perfect amount. Listen here. If It was 12% of, you'd be like, what's going on here? We've gotta get our gays out. 72% of Gen Z adults identified as straight 15. Is bi five is gay or lesbian and 8% is something else. 72% straights. Now we're losing it. Straights we're going down. The straights are getting thinned out. Nearly 30% of Gen Z adults identify as L-G-B-T-Q. So 30% of the Gen Z population says that they are LGBTQ plus. Wow. That's a lot of kids. And I'm supportive. So let's move on. Yeah. I don't, I mean, fuck. I don't have any kids. I Don't have any kids either. Hey dude. Hey. What's childless? No wonder we're No, no wonder we're still doing this podcast.
