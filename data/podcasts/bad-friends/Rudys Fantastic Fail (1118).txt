Pretty Good. That's very good. Very good. Yeah, vet. I took my dog to the vet and we don't have pet insurance. And it was an emergency 'cause she was throwing up blood. I remember getting blood and I panic. I had the worst panic man. I was so scared. Mm, so sad. Then we go there and they take all these X-rays and stuff and they're like, you know, this is not covered. And I said, we don't even have insurance. She goes, okay, I just wanna let you know. Comes back with a bill and it's $1,500. Also. On top of that, she goes, some of the staff is a big fan. Can we take pictures of you? Yeah. It, I was like, my dog just shit, shit blood. I love it. Elisa, discount. No discount, No shit, no no discount, no picture discount. Nothing. I was happily taking pictures like my dog pooping blood. Oh wow. And I'm taking photos. Wow. I did the right thing, but I was also like, that's a little weird to ask me to take photos.


So first thing in the morning when my dog is shitting blood and I'm a little worried and you're like, can we get a picture for the studio, for the office? I was like, sure. Is the blood thing taken care of? Is she still shitting fucking blood? Yeah. It was a little weird. You know what my thing is is whenever I'm in a fucking pet food store, I hate it when there's always old white ladies. They come in and they go, what's the cheapest cat food? You got dry. Right. And I'm always like, you know what I mean? I'm always like, that's your fucking family member. Yeah. That's the love of your life. You know what I mean? Well, here's the deal. It's an economic thing for some people. Right? So some people can't afford free range. What? Some people can't afford to level up. It's hard. Yeah. But it's just like the cheapest.


You don't walk in the cheapest. Well think about let's genuinely, let's do this. Yeah. The the, in the scope of America, most people have to buy the cheapest gas, the cheapest groceries. Am I being arrogant? A little Bit? No, not arrogant. But you're Being Am I, am I being I think you're forgetting Outta touch with reality here. A little Bit. I Need my dog. Nice shit too. Like I think it's, yeah, but you live foolishly, You know, a they're not the, the gap between cheapest and average isn't that much. I a dollar or two. Right. I agree With you. I agree. But I'm saying most Americans have to buy the cheapest gas, the cheapest food, the cheapest everything to get through the, the, the, their lives. Yeah. But it's just like We're blessed that we that you don't have to.


I Don't know, dude. Because even when I, in my early twenties, I had two cats and I went to the pet food store and I got like, I had no money and I still went like, I'm not gonna get the cheapest one. I know you're talking. 'cause I want them to, you know what I mean? At least survive. I agree. But I think most people don't, can't. I think that's the bummer. I They care. I think some people don't care. I think most people with pets give a fuck about their pets. They love their pets. That's why there's like a, what's that place called that's near my old house? Just dogs. Just for dogs. Just food for dogs. Yeah. That shit's so expensive. I walked in there one time and I was like, this is fucking rude. It was like a, I love it there. Two Pound bag of food for like 80 bucks. I was like, what the fuck are you fee? They're like, we hand cut up filet.


Yeah, they do. That's crazy. But oh no, it's not crazy. That's crazy. And lemme say something. What's, that's what's Bobby pays for the dogs. You do that? Yeah. That's so much money. Well, it's my dogs dude. I know, dude. But that's like an, that's an inflation. If I go to fucking, that's BLVD. Right? Or you know what I mean? Or maestro. Right. I'm gonna get my dog. Dude, I got fucking, but you Don't go to Those Nobu for my cats. That's fucking insane. Right. And they didn't like it. So I'm like, oh, I guess this isn't gonna be a thing.

No, It's not crazy. No, no. It's crazy. It's funny, but it's Insane. Well, I, I guess it's, you know, here's, and I'm gonna cause a little controversy out here.


I might as well put my foot down. Okay. And maybe some people, and I was gonna say white people, but I'm not gonna say that. I don't wanna generalize, right? No, go ahead and do it. Yeah. They view Their animals as, you know, a lower family member. Not true. Yeah. Don't generalize whites, because I don't do that. And he doesn't do that, you Know, but it's like, Don't do that to whites, just people. How about this? Then you wanna take it there? I i, I, that's why I brought it up, dude. Let's take it there.

And going to like a, you know, going to wan or something and getting like organic nuts unsalted. You know what I mean? Right. I guess that's what I would do. I would assume that golfing come from the same farm and some of them are just packaged for eron. Okay. Okay. I don't know how they're packaged. I don't know what the farm Well, You know what? That's it. Then we need to do Bad Friends visit a farm. We need to go visit a farm so we can find Out. Well, but my point though being is boom, there's another one. Chilling, watching fucking, you know, reality TV on a couch. Dude. Probably, you know, 90 day fiance. Look at the fucking, look at that chilling Ball. He's watching. Love is blind. Yeah.

The first thing, the first person I kiss in my home when I walk. I know, I Know you do because I know that you spent $1,500, but there's a lot of people that are like at, at the vet. Like, what, how much is it gonna cost? Well, people, some people can't afford it. I'm lucky that I could afford it. Well, you know, I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky that I'm able to do that. Carlos's dog goes to the vet and it costs him two grand or something like that. He's in some shit. He's calling us. Would You pay it? Yeah, Of course he would. There we go. But he's scared. Yeah, that's Yeah. My god. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not saying the feeling behind it. Yeah. It's gonna be a hit and it's gonna be fucking a, a bummer. But I'm just saying it's like, but You're right.


Well, it Depends on what the like it. Okay, here's a, here's here's one. All right. When, when you guys, when you guys The grapes? Yeah, the grapes. I got a call like, oh yeah. All the dogs are in the vet. Right. And you gotta help with the money. Right. Because they all ate grapes. Yeah. So I go, they ate fucking grapes, like roman emperors. What the fuck are you talking about? Right. They're like, yeah. And they, and then nothing happened. But you guys, we had to spend thousands of dollars. It wasn't very expensive. For what? Yeah, exactly. So what was that all about? The vet said that they were gonna die. But why are you freaking the fucking dogs in the fucking vet into the first place? You called first? And they said, yeah, take the, You did one grape.


No, it was Three. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Amongst four dogs, they ate three grapes. And I get this call that's gonna cost all this money. I was like, what the fuck is going on here? So in that case, yes. I'd be like, ah, grapes. We'll figure it Out. We'll figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. Wait A minute. A bar of chocolate. I would be like, let's just see. Take it about hour by hour. Yeah. Can dogs not eat grapes? I do not. I don't Think it was grape. What was it? Grapes. The number of grapes can be lethal to a dog. Depends on the dog's weight. But the general rule of thumb is that one grape per 10 pounds of body weight is potentially dangerous. Why? Grapes and raisins? Cause acute kidney failure in dogs. What? I mean, my dog doesn't eat grapes now. You know, I, that's crazy. I don't know. Now, you know. I'm glad I know. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. And also, why do you have fucking just free grapes laying on the ground?

She goes, I should have taken the 4,500. Oh my God. That hurts my heart. And, and and, and I swear to God, and I was, my heart Cracked. You stiffed her on the tip. I go, yeah, but Hey Dude, can I get the fucking ketchup? Hey. You know what I mean? You guys have hot sauce. I asked you for the hot sauce. You know what I mean? Yeah. Oh, That's awful.

Oh, We need to, we need to figure out a way to have Rudy get her act together so we don't have a failure on our hands. Oh, that's the, That's a lesson that you, You listen. Did you hear the lessons today? Yeah. I'm Scared. No, no. You don't have to be scared. Well, should be. You have to make the right Decision. No, you should be scared. But how Do you know that you're making the right decisions? Fuck, that's a good question. That is A very good question. That's very good. I actually don't Know. Well, I mean, you, the opportunities that you get, Seize them. You seize them. Yeah. You don't go against them.


Because I really honestly believe that one day, and don't make that face. Don't give 'em that face. Yeah. One day you're gonna look back at certain times in your life, you're gonna go, oh, I, I didn't see it for what it was. And say that to all of our fans too. Sometimes it's like, if it's right there in front of you, the worst you, the worst that can happen is that it just doesn't work the way you think. But you gotta keep trying it. Like, for Instance, if you, like, if Seven Ecky is wanted to do a podcast with you individually, and you know what I mean? And they go, you wanna try it? Right. I think your instinct would be, no, I don't wanna do it. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well then don't. But I think you'd regret it Because, Because the dryer's hot now, right? Yeah. If you, it Won't be 10 years from now If you try it and it doesn't work, all that, all that happened was it didn't work.


It doesn't matter. You don't lose, you know, it just didn't work. Because in this moment in your life, you can make as much money as you can and then, you know, later, you know, have a little savings or whatever. But I, I honestly believe that, you know, life is hard. Yeah. And it's hard out there to make a living. And I, we've seen people struggle. Yeah. And it's like, it's like, you know, I feel like I've, and me and Andrew both have made decisions that were like, at the end of the day, you know, beneficial. Well, and I made some failures. I did a lot of failures. Me too. Me too. Me too. I mean, most of the things I did was a, was not a failure. Most of the things I did didn't work out the way I thought. They might've worked out bad sitcoms, bad, bad, bad scripts and testing and it doesn't work.


It just didn't work. Yeah. And then you go, go go until it works. But not seizing the opportunity is tough. And we want you to win. All we care about is you winning. I, I think I am more open though. I know you are 10 times Better. I think. I think you've grown so much on this show so much. It is crazy. So much Well end the show. Tell 'em. Goodbye. Thank You for being a bad friend. Fantastic. Woo. Woo, Woo.
