Like, who wrote the jokes for them? I Don't know. And they all had different point of views. They all went, it got to the point though, dude, where me, Griffin and Amir were standing there and we all were holding each other going. What if we bombed? It Would be 'cause we're we're supposed to be the pros. Yeah. Right. So then Eric goes up there, he does good. I'm next. Right. And I don't know why I brought this up, because you brought up the two, Two black guys, black guys Watching. Right. And this dude, this black dude had shades on. You know how sometimes they get Martin Lawrencey? Yeah. A hundred percent. You Know what I mean? Like, they get like, like bity.


Yeah. Look like, you know what I mean? They just get all hold on. They just get all like, where am I? You know what I mean? What are you talking about? Dude? They get all I was with you with Martin Lawrence. I, I, I know. Lost me. I don't No, he was an older black guy, right? Mm. He's wearing like a brown tracksuit. He was wearing shades and he was just kind of going, where am I? You know what I Mean? Was he on stage? No, he was off to the side. Okay. You know, you go down the stairs. He was sitting there with shades with a beautiful, his wife. Yeah. You know what I mean? But they're older. And he also, they like to, I, I don't wanna say they, that's insane. That's insane what I'm doing. I know what you were saying.


No, no, no, No. Yeah. But he, you know, he had like one leg on something like this. Like this, I think like this as if he was In a park on a bench Drinking lemonade. Hmm. In a nice summer Day. And you know what color it is? It's pink, it's purple, it's pink, it's grape. They black people love pink lemonade. They do. The way that we love Arnold Palmers. So This guy, right. I was observing Him. Yeah. He was dying laughing at every fireman. Okay. Okay. He was a fireman himself. I Don't know. I Didn't ask him. He must have you. And he was laughing. But then when I went up Ice cold, Ice cold, like a river. Nothing.


Nothing. Not a smile. Not a smirk. Not a wich. He almost looked mad. When I'm, when I get nervous and I have to do well, I start getting real weird fast Up front. Yeah. I know. You know what I mean? I, I make my hair weird, But I like it. I stumble on stage like a character, you know what I mean? And then I just start going pee, beep, beep, beep. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Poking my pee pee, you know what I mean? Like, I literal go beep, beep, beep, beep beep. Like that. Right. And he, our media's like, nah, Nah. He didn't like that. I crushed Still, but still He, I couldn't break him. Yeah. You never will. I will. No, you will not. One day I will, sir. Wherever you are. Yeah. Come back to a show, sir.


Let's see if we can really crack you. Yeah. Anyway. Do you know how much money they raised for firefighters? I didn't ask. My grandfather was a firefighter. You know that. And I've talked to 'em over the years and I said, you know, cops get a lot of like, flack. You know, cops are always, they're always like, cops are racist. You know, this is a lot of flack. People say, I don't know about that. You never heard this. Never heard that. Good. But I think it's interesting that people always say like, oh, cops are racist. All the cops are bad. Cops are racist firefighters. Never. No one ever says that about that. I don't think they are. Oh, they are? Yes they Are. Oh, they, I'll tell you what, can I give you a theory? Maybe? Yeah. Dude. They're just stronger cops.


Yeah. Imagine it's a job that you have. Yeah. When only one specific event happens. Yeah. Right. So there could be a month that goes by. No. Or like, you're A Robbery. Is there a fire every day? No. Right. So what I'm saying is, is that I assume months go by. Sure. They Rescue cats From trees. They do. But fuck you. Alright. 176 fire stations exist. No. How many fires are there in the United States? No, But in la In la I will say This out every day. Look at this. Approximately 17,000 fires in the city. That also includes like small shop for front fire. That's, Yeah. That's not a big, that's not, you Know. Yeah, exactly. It's not real. It's not unreal.


Arson. That includes arson. Arson. So 46 a day. Oh, so then they, they're always working. They're probably pretty busy. Yeah. Okay. Well then my theory's wrong. I always assume, like, you know, they're just playing like Jenga up there in, in the firehouse. You know what I mean? And then, oh man. You know what I mean? I dunno why I said it like that. But like, oh man, fire, let's go boo. And they go down the pool. They Have way more medical emergencies. And the West Hollywood Fire Department, that's all medical Emergencies. Oh. That's what they le they, because we, I used to, you know, we, we used to, Because when you get something stuck up your ass, they gotta be there for all that. No alano used to get heart murmurs. No, I get 'em all the time. And then we call the ambulance. No, I don't do that. And a fire truck would come. Sometimes they have To.


Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They come. Why though? Why? What? Why the Fire truck? Well, the ambulance, They wanna show up their big ladder. Oh no. They ha I think it's part of the, it's a part of, it's required that they have to show up with it with paramedics. Mm. Because in case someone's stuck in something or who knows? Well, here, let's get the fucking answer from this woman. The goal is to get help. Who needs a fast possible? Ambulances can be delayed or unavailable at the time. Because paramedics also are, are emt EMTs also can be firefighters, or they have to be Oh, I think you're right. Because I think a couple, a couple of times a ambulance didn't come. It was only a firefighter. But he had But he had all the equipment. Yeah. He had The experience and they had the, wow. They do so many things. Would She get her heart shock back into, into rhythm?


She had an ablation. So we used to, we got a couple operations on her heart. Wow. Yeah. I get murmurs all the time. Do you ever Get worried about it? Yeah. Yeah. A Lot. What have you thought considered? Oh, an ablation. Hmm. You know what it is? A, a black Asian. Yes. I should have said I ever consider getting a tiger woods. That's what they call the surgery. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. No, I thought about doing something to it, but my doctors have always said it's okay. Yeah. I guess they go, they, it's like a little, they go through all the like, veins and stuff on one side of the body with a, with, I Don't know. Usually. Usually they go through your belly button a lot. That freaks me out. They open up your belly button. My wife had surgery. She had Did it go through your belly button?


Yeah. Yuck. You know how they say that one day we're gonna have chips on our arms? Will you do that? Well, you, With all our information, our credit cards, everything. You know what I mean? You'll do it for sure. Yeah. How, How Convenient I would do it. You won't do that. Why'd you shake your head? No, That shit scares me. I don't know Why. It's just like, when that starts conflicting with like, mechanical with human stuff. Like with how brain and neural What you mean mechanical? I'm not saying I'm gonna get my arm replaced. It's a little chip. Dude. You think it's gonna lead to neural link shit? It's Gonna, I don't even like driving cars that like, they can turn off with a computer. That's why I drive an old Accord.

Let us be mean. Okay. From bridges of Madison County or something. You know what I Mean? That No, what I'm saying is you have your credit card, your id, id and also maybe a way to open up your front door with your arm. Oh, Cool. Oh, I like that too. I mean click, click, click. Yeah. But think about it. If somebody follows you home, they grab you. They just put your arm up to the door. Oh, that's true. They guy, he gets it. Right, Right, right, right, right, Right.

I don't wanna start a fight with you, but I I You're doing it. I know, but I walked in and I remember going, oh, I might have to move. That's the first thought. What do you mean?

I went to your front lawn pretty good. Nice lawn. Thanks. You have A gate and the whole thing. Yeah. Electrical, you know Yeah. Gate system. Right. You walked outta these gigantic doors. Not that your house is big, but you have gigantic doors. It's a big door. I'm six one. Right. Right. I mean, all doors are big to you. Right. Okay. You can make fun of me all you want, but I'm just, I'm Try with be honest with you. Well, I'm also Try with put comedy in the show. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

But I walk in and I remember my first thing is I looked around high ceilings.


Do not have high ceilings. Yeah. They're, they're tall. They're very Right. Well, They're tall. Right. And then I also like, I'm like, the living room is so far away from where I am. Don't be Real real. It's in the back of The house. Like I even know Where it is. It's in the back of the house. Yeah. So it's like, you know, my sight isn't that bad. Right. Your House.

So am I, I walk in high ceilings. I go, I don't know where the living room, but it's pretty far away. Probably half a mile away. And I walked in there and then I went, my thought was, I might have to at least get a house comparable to this because I want us feel like we're at on the same level.

And I said to Carlos with a smirk. I said, he's gonna be pissed off. Yeah. Tom DeLong is being inducted into the Poway High School Hall of Fame. Tom DeLong of Blink 180 2.


By the way, the thing that I was upset about was there was another woman that was inducted who I don't think is famous. None of them are. Well, Tom DeLong, He's the only, he's the first guy that's famous that is actually in the Hall of Fame before it's like scientists. And there was one guy, an actor who was like, he started a community theater in North Park. I mean, for gay men. It's like, okay, he's in, Well, maybe you need to do something like that. Important work. Something for the community. Oh, you think I'm not doing an important work For, for them. Yeah. But I, I, I don't know what they want. And, and, and when I went to school there, I didn't know what they wanted.


Mm. Yeah. I didn't feel a part of, I felt ostracized. And not by the school itself, by the people that inhabited it. Well, Just the whole, I mean, you have to understand Poi High School was that controversy where that kid wore that anti-gay T-shirt. And, and he went to court for it. I don't remember this. Yeah, Look it up. So Poway High, some kid wore I I hate gays or something like that. Oh. It was like, it was like a derogatory t-shirt with, you know what I mean? That expressed his point of view about Gay is not Okay. Is that what he wore? I don't know. But what I, what I wanna say is what I've done for the school. Okay. It was, I was on two sporting teams. Yeah. Wrestling and tennis. Oh, okay.


Right. What I forgot. Yeah. Yeah. I was a peer counselor. You were? Yeah. Wow. I don't know why you're smirking guy. So I, I Thought you said it was a pair counselor at first. And I thought, yeah, Like the fruit. I didn't know they did counselors by shape. The Good one. All right, come on. That was a good one. You were a peer counselor. Yeah. You were on two sports, Two sports. Everybody Liked you, you were a musician. Did you play at the School? No, I wasn't a musician then, but I was also in a play. And also, fourthly though, I also was, I got sober my junior year. Right. So my senior year, I was like, you know, I participated in, you know what I mean, 12 step kind of things and spread a positive message.


You know what I mean? At school, you know, I think what their, they're basing it on is my nudity and my And what Does that have to do with anything? That's what I'm, I mean, that's my point of view. No, I think they're basing it on, I think they're basing it on the fact that you are free, creative, wild, unhinged. And these people on that list are probably bridled protected, safe. Mm. You're free. You're an artist. Yeah. They don't have any wild artists on there. Like, did you remember like, they had a counselor for like, what was it called? It was like a occupational counselor or something where you know, that you would see somebody like, you know what I mean?


A staff member of the school and they would direct your life. Yeah. Occupational therapist or whatever they, yeah. Well we had that where it was like, and I remember going in, they're like, alright, well, they looked at my grades and they go wood shop. And I go, I was a junior. I was like, wood shop. I mean, that's because you're failing in all these things and you have no asset or ability. Right. And I'm like, you know, I, I, I, if, if, if I could go back now, I would go, yeah. But I'm funny is that, is there a path for that? Right. But that, to that school, that kind of is not even a, they wouldn't never promote that or give you an option. Option. Wasn't an artistic school. Didn't have like artistic. Well, It's like, yeah, it's like, it's either you become an engineer or lawyer doctor or whatever, whatever.


Right. You know, or businessman or you are working with wood. Right. You Get mean carping shit. I dunno what, you know what I mean? Right. You know what I mean? You're a welder or whatever. You know what I mean? I've also never, never in my life seen an Asian carpenter. Yeah. You Wouldn't last a day. I've never seen an Asian look. Google. Are there Asian carpenters? I cannot. Was Jesus Asian? I don't think there's ever been an Asian carpenter. Yes, there are Asian carpenters. There Are buildings who built the buildings in Asia? The buildings in Asia. We send white people over there. No, No, no, no. No. Africans. Not Africans. There's a Guy's Instagram called the Asian carpenter. Exactly. Well, Let me see some of his work. Let's see some of his work.


Dude, look at that table. Okay, dude, that's a standard, very good table. He built just the legs. It says he didn't even build the top. Alright. Fuck this guy. Anyway, that's nice. Doesn't look any carpentry to me. Oh, staircasing. That's the Ceiling. Oh. Oh. Anyway. Anyway. But what, I mean, it's just so I remember at school when I was in high school, I was like, I remember going, oh, I'm fucked. Yeah. I felt, I felt the exact same because they're Like, you have, they, they told you to your face. There's no future for you. Yeah. And this is where you sh we sh suggest you go.


And I'm like, I can't believe it. There's no way. So I had to go out in the world and, you know, feel some pain. Yeah. And then it drove me into whatever I'm doing now. But look at What you, look at you now. I think that in many ways, power Poi High School drove me into this because it's like they were, they didn't support me. Right. And so That made you stronger. So now you know what, with that point of view, I don't wanna be in the Hall of Fame. Good. But you do. I don't. You Do a little bit. I do. Yeah, I sure do. But you know what? But if it doesn't happen, I understand. It should happen. And I don't understand. And I will say this, I'm going down to San Diego to do shows down there. I'm thinking about stopping by.


No, when are you going? Paying a little, when are you going visit? When are you going? I think it's in February. I don't know. I have to, I Have to go with you. Yeah, You do. I think I'm gonna pay a little fucking visit to power to Power High School. I think it's the move, in fact. Yeah. You know what I would love to do? Yeah. You, Doug Stanhope used to do shows at Montreal across the street from like the corporate venues or whatever. Yeah. I think it was Montreal. Yeah. Have you heard About this? I remember that. Yeah. We should do a show across the street. A popup show across the street from Poway High. Where is Poway? Look up Poway. And what's across the street? Is it like a field or something? I Think there's a theater attached to Poway High School. I dunno. If. you can rent that out. It's Gotta be theirs though. Well, that's fine. That's on them. Yeah. Listen up. If there's anybody Yeah, that performing arts center, Like look at, That's nothing to do with the high school, I think.


Yeah. That poi center for the, I think, I don't think, I think it's attached to the school, but I think that it's private. Like we can rent it. Maybe we Should do our 250 episode from there. Just getting sick of his shit. I, I, I know. Just getting real sick of this Shit. I understand. Let's let go of this. I mean, are you in yours Hall of Fame at your school? There is no hall. We don't have a Hall of Fame, but I'm in like the Wikipedia page. Yeah, me too. I'm in the Wikipedia. Yeah. No, we don't have, we don't have a Hall of Fame. Yeah. Yeah. You don't have one? No. It's actually very weird. I've never Why, why don't you Start one up? Why I've never heard of this until your school. Do you guys know about height? Your hall of fame? Having Andres? I'm clearly not asking you. You didn't go to high school? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, well, you, You, Carlos, your school doesn't have a hall of fame. No. My dad's in the Hall of Fame at the military school I went To.


That's how well we asked. That's not What we asked. Interesting bud. I Was just proud. Yeah. It has nothing to do with you anyway. How about you, McCone? I don't, I don't know. Can I tell you what I I think it is. what? You're gonna be so mad. No, it's just too far away from fame. What do you mean? I'm too far away from fame? No, what I'm saying is, is that like, you know, obviously when you go out into the, you know, it's just less famous people come from smaller towns. Like for instance, I don't, I actually If you go to like Beverly Hills High. Right? Oh, right. How many famous people came from there? A lot. Because, a lot. Because the businesses just are enveloped around them. Right. There's access and you know, through nepotism and whatnot. Yes, yes, yes. And it's in the city Of the thing. It's in the city. Right. So I'm sure If, you saw the Beverly Hills High School Hall of Fame.


There's a, it's stacked. But then If, you go to like, you know, Peoria, Illinois, some school, there's Hall of Fame. There's probably nobody famous that came from there. I mean, I, so Why would they have a Hall of Fame? Well, We have, we have a not so, I, I know what you're saying. Although yours isn't impressive either. Let's be honest. It's not like you're saying a million Very cool, famous people came, went to Wait, Tony Gwen came, went to my school. Okay. Baseball player. Okay. Stephanie Seymour Supermodel who had a baby with Axel Rose. Not a real thing. Nobody cares. Okay. Nobody cares. Not a real thing. Nobody cares. I care. Yeah. But that's a bullshit. Don't make a real thing. Tom Geelong One guy. Yeah. That's the guy. No, you're not there. You're not even on it. So, no, that's wrong.


It's not you. All these other people are nobodies. You're wrong. Okay. Tony Gwynn. That was the only one. And by the way, these guys don't even know who Tony Gwynn is. Only I do. 'cause I like baseball. Well, They mean one from your school. Andrew. Santino. I know. That's it. No, there's no, there is actually a lot, a lot of pro athletes. Oh, that's Good. A lot of athletes. Okay, good. Oh, Bob, did you see you're at a sperm bank as an option for people to want their babies to look like you? What? Seriously? Yeah. You're under Bill Paxton Young. Wow.
