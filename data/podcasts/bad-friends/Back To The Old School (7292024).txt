Pretty fun to me. Before he was, you know, the guy, right? He went all like, he was like a, a baker in France for a year. I'm not kidding you. No Way. Then he went to New York and then was like, he worked on film. Like went to a film company, worked on film. Ho Chi Min was like an artist. No, he's just a world traveler, just going around the world. Probably fucking white chicks and stuff, right? Yeah, dude. And he has to do the, can I say that or no? Okay. And he probably has to do this because you need small, Tiny Man. And those are her shoulders. Oh, right.


And the laundry like that, you know? So anyway, PO Chi Min was like a world renowned, you know, you know, A worldly man, A cultural worldly man, And, they found, saw what was going on in this country. And he came back. He was like, that's it. That's It. That's it. I love making croissant, you know what I mean? I love this film we're doing about, you know, this film. What of Life film My, the photographer.

The tone of the movie is very creepy. It, I mean, at through the whole movie, you know, it gave me hereditary vibes in terms of like, they got the tone, right? But then there were times where I'm like, that doesn't make any sense. Or what is that? And what's going on? What is going on with the little orb? You know what I mean? The doll orb. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, of course. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I don't, 'cause I'm gonna go see it. Yeah. But if I say doll orb, you're not gonna know what that is. Well, I see it in my head. Well, you know what doll, doll orbs are? Well, I'm just obsessed right now with the afterlife, because I watched this guy on TikTok.


I don't even know if I sent it to you. There's a guy on TikTok who goes to graveyards. He cleans the grave, and as he cleans them, he has one of those machines that picks up electromagnetic vibes. And then it says words through the voice box. And I'm not, when I, dude, okay, He'll go, He'll go, he'll, it'll go. It'll go. Thank you. And he's like, am I'm cleaning your grave, Charlie. How did you die? And it'll go stab. There's no way, Jake. It doesn't, he Let the spirit there, play it. Play it for him. Thursday. Oh. Oh, sorry. Thursday.


My name's Mary. Oh, sorry. Little one. It's hard for me to hear you. Bye. Stop. If I heard that, I would just go to the car. I know what do what you do. Wow, dude. You think those are like demons and stuff? There's gotta be, I mean, look, people that havent passed over, right? Isn't that the theory? Yeah. Stop. I already know what it is. There's a little person behind that grave store going eat.


What the, I mean, how do you know that it's the grave thing? I don't understand. There's a machine that does it. So there's a box, there's a spirit box, and spirits can electromagnetically communicate through the box. And it, it's filled with like thousands and thousands of words. And it electromagnetically picks the word and it comes out. So it'll be like death. Oh, I see. Striking. I see What you think, mom. Right, right. Bob. Yeah. Lee. Yeah. That's it. We should buy one, A ghost box. And it records. But What if there's some words in there that I'm a spirit and I wanna say it, and it's not in the fucking box. It gets as close as it can. Like, which ones are you trying to say? Megatron? Would that be in it? I, I bet you Know what I mean.


Vort, It's loaded. Voldemort for sure is in the spirit. I Don't think Voldemort's in the spirit. Anal beads That's in there. Oh, you know, anal beads have to be, yeah, yeah. Ballen chain. Oh, but can I put said you, when you put BDSM. BDSM. Yeah. When you put that against a gravestone. Yeah. He just does a thing. And then as he walks through, Let's get one. Let's go to Hollywood Cemetery. Done. And let's experiment with this stuff, man. Absolutely. We can go to like Humphrey Bogart. Is it? Well, who's buried over there? Humphrey Bogart Isn't Monroe. Isn't Marilyn Monroe? We gotta Go to Marilyn Monroe's thing at Forest Lawn. We go Forest. They're all there, right? Yeah. Like May West, all these people are there. Yeah. Paul Newman, right?


There's all those. Oh, I love your pizzas, Paul. He'll say thank you. Will they do that? Yeah. Oh wow. Paul, you make the best pizza sauce. Yeah. Thank you. Wow. Have you seen my work? No. Yeah. But I love your pasta Sauce. I can't name a movie. Yeah. But wow. And I have to say, out of all the Hollywood male stars back from back in the day, he's probably the best looking Humphrey Bogart or Oh, Paul Newman. Yeah. Not even close, bro. He killed it back then. He Was so handsome dude. So handsome Dude. If I look like that now, oh, I wouldn't even be here right now, dude. But there's two kinds of Hollywood guys. What? There's a Paul Newman or there's a Steve McQueen.


Steve McQueen. Yeah. So, so Steve McQueen is our generation's probably like either Charlie Ham or, or, or what's his name? Tom Hardy. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And Paul Newman is like Austin Butler. Oh, I was gonna say Gosling Gosling. But I think Austin Butler. I say Austin Butler Hot. You No, you're right. You're right. But, but, but I think Gosling is hotter, But Gosling's so hot. He's the hottest guy in Hollywood. Dude. He's hot. Delaney. You like that guy? You like rye goss? Not really. Whoa. Whoa. Who gimme a star that you like? Jake Gien Hall's my favorite. Yeah, He's babe. Oh, nice. He's a Bagga babe. And he's jacked. Nice guy. He's jacked. I saw him one night at a bar on Fairfax and I didn't realize how big he is.


Yeah. Not sta tall. He's fucking huge. His arms were massive. Yeah. Jill, you know, he has a joke with me. Hmm. Because I had met him one time, I swear to God. So my, you know my friend Gene? Yeah. Hall. They're best friends, right? Yeah. And so Gene goes, you can come to the dinner, like I can come because finally I can come. Where was it, Damien? Right. So I come to the dinner and you know, and when you're at a dinner like that, everyone's like either a showrunner or like a, A huge person. Yeah. So I'm like, I'm there. Like, you've yet to read the pockets. Do you know what I mean? Nowhere to slip in.


Exactly. Nowhere To slip in. Yeah, exactly. Right. And I didn't slip in anywhere. I found no pockets. You, you? No, I was just eating. I would go, you know what I mean? Like that kind of thing. No words to Jill. I don't think so. He was so funny. And then I got so nervous. I was like, okay, I'll see you guys later. And I laughed. Right. Who is this? Who's this girl?

So people on the internet are mad. 'cause she said, get ready with me to go to Auschwitz. Yeah. Is she Jewish? She push, push pause for a second. She doesn't look Jewish, but the spirits in at Auschwitz probably look at her like, look at that fat fuck. Yeah. You know what I mean? Was that a pig? Owen? Wink. You know what I mean? The spirits didn't like her. Didn't Like her. Yeah. No, they probably bitch you. They did. She's very pretty. Yeah. What? She's a bachelor contestant. Anna. A Redmond. Yeah. I mean if, like, I imagine the spirit, the spirits see that. They're like, oh, hot, hot. What If you Had the little machine? They would probably say hot.

I think you would just go in and use it when you're done.


You'd leave. No, because I don't wanna, I don't wanna live in San Marco. I think Where do you wanna live? Everyone's gone. I would, I would go back to Malibu or something. Like a nice beach Property. Okay. Then get yourself an 18 wheeler truck and load that bitch up with sex style toys and bring it up to a house in Malibu. Yeah. Yeah. Bring it to Spielberg's house and pack that thing with real dolls. Yeah. I, I would love to have sex with a real doll on Dilaudid. Right. With a fucking Amistad poster in back of me.

I would learn to read. I'd be so bored. You can't just fuck a real doll all day long on Dilaudid. Try me. Yeah. Yeah. Eventually you're like, oh, Hemingway. Yeah. Sun also rises. I don't Even know what I would do. I can't even imagine what I would do if, like, so how many people are gone of the population? It's, it's like almost everybody. Only a few people are Left. No, half the population is probably, Oh, well that's a lot of people still left.


Oh, yeah. But I, I have scenarios in my brain when I go to bed, I think of these things. What, imagine if there's only 50 people Whoa. On planet Earth. You'll never gonna run into anybody. So what would you do? You're never gonna, so you're alone, basically. This Is the scenario. Yeah. What would you do? The first thing I would do? Yeah. You can't kill yourself. Boring. Boring. Yeah. Don't kill Yourself. No. You want, well, you stay, I'd stay alive. Yeah. But you're never gonna see anybody again. So you're the last person on earth, Basically. Yeah. You don't know that they're there. The 50. So you're never gonna see 'em. But what if, What if you run into one of 'em? Yeah. Yeah. It's the most annoying guy. Like, who would be the annoying you think To have on earth?


Yeah. It's not gonna also be, 'cause it's like if there's 50 people, Like a teacher from high school that's still around. Right. And there's probably half of them are women. Right? Probably. And then probably seven of them. That'd be great. If it was 49 dudes and one chick and you gotta go find her. Oh, Wow. The hunt. No, no, no, no. So what would you do? 50 people. All right. The first thing you do. First thing I do. Yeah. Boom. Everyone's gone. Clothes drop. Yeah. Boom. What do I do? Well, At first you would go like, what, what's going all that? What's going on? Panic. Panic. Sheer panic. So After a week, you find out, you know what I mean, that you're, there's no one around. Then what do you do? I go to go to downtown LA go, go to Skid Row because the bodies are gone.


But the drugs are still there. Right, right. You know, they leave all the belongings. That's That where all, I mean, there are other drugs, other places. Where Are they? CVS?

And I'm grabbing those kns. Yeah. Jamming 'em in my arm. And also downtown. There's a Lamborghini dealership. And I'm grabbing one of those things. And I'm on the horse as I'm flying through LA on that stuff, dude. Whoa. And I'm driving right to the sunset on The 10. Yeah. Dude. Just hoed outta my mind. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa, dude. Yeah. Right. Dude going. I'm as fast as I can. Just slamming, initiate. And then as soon as I get to the beach, we're watching meets the water. Yeah. Yeah. Right off of the pier into the ocean.

Well then you find a new fun thing to do every single day. Right. I would jump Well, a couple of times you wanna jump off of something. You want to know what that feels like. Yeah. Also fashion. You could just wear, wear wherever you want. Well, I'd be naked. I'm not gonna, well, I'm not gonna bother with clothes. Not me. Socks and underwear. I had like those gigantic green rave pants. Right. With the loops, with the tons of loops. I've always wanted to wear one of those little fucking hats with the little propeller. Right. And that, you know what, I would wear one of those, like, you know, the Eric Griffin masks?


Oh, the big nose. The big nose. Eric Griffin masks. Right. And I would probably take a tattoo gun and just be Tattooing yourself. I would, I'll always post 'em. Malone it. Yeah. On the face. Yeah. But would I put just like a bunch of fours? Four, four just all over my face? What, what some arbitrary number, right? Yeah. It'd be, and then all of a sudden they come back. Then I'm gonna be like, what? I got needles in my arm at the beach. Where, have you guys been Insane? My teeth are all gone. Yeah. Wow. It'd be fun to pull out a tooth. That would be fun. Oh, that's, yeah. The, the things that could go wrong.


I'll tell you what would go wrong. Well, if you get sick. Oh yeah. Well, so There's like, I don't know how chemo works Or how to get it. I don't even know if I have, how do you even know you have cancer? I'll go to the ho scripts. There's no one there. I don't even, I press a button. I don't know what to do. You just sit in the machines by yourself, boo. Yeah. Yeah. You print it out. I can't read this. Yeah. And you leave. Wow. Wow. Wow. That'd be a nightmare. It would be.
