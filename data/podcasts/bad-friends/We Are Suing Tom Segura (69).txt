I Can say it, but I'm, I know your title's Great. There's this thing too, when you, when you're naming, and they pointed us out to me. 'cause we were submitting just dozens of them. Yeah. Every title sounds fake until it's like official, right? Like when you're, when you're throwing them around, you're like, that sounds like a made up. That doesn't sound real. Well, Chachi BT says, Bobby's comedy special should be called Tiger Dad Unfiltered. Kimchi, the slept king.


The Slept King, pork Chop Samurai, Undiagnosed Diagnosed. That's the only one. Trauma lama is so good. Trauma la I feel like if, if you do go with Still Bobby, you gotta do one of these poses.

Nah. Woo. Everybody's laughing. Losing it, dude. I'm losing it. My favorite thing you said is it's the table setting for the entire special. And it made me think immediately, I know that's a turn of phrase, but how Bobby has literally never set a table his entire life. It's, I went to etiquette school. No, you didn't. I I, I, there's a paper in Poway. I have a clipping of it, of me going to etiquette school. Why? They took a photo of me. Why did they take a photo of you gonna etiquette school?

We're not drinking. We didn't order any booze. And she's like, no, no. This is from a gentleman in the restaurant. I was like, oh, fuck. I don't, we hate champagne. Yeah. Yeah. Like, we don't, I don't like champagne. I don't like champagne either. I fucking hate it. And I was, and she's, she's like, it's one of this bot, You know? And the guy's like, oh, it's a really nice bottle. I was like, okay, don't open it. And they're like, don't open it. I said, just put it in the thing. And I go, who's the guy? And then they lead me around the side. It's the guy. Yeah. It's the same guy.


And I walked it up to him And I go, Hey man. And then he goes, dude, I just wanted to apologize. I'm so sorry I took care of your meal. I, that was so fucking rude. No, that's really nice. And I was like, buddy, you're the man. I go, I don't drink champagne, tear. Have it. Take it. He had like three girls with him. I was like, do your thing. Thank you. And then I said, let's take a photo. But that turned out the right way. Sure. But it was cool. Move on him. He was like, I took, I paid for your meal. I was like, oh, that's fucking, that's nice. But at the beginning I was very like, dude, get the fuck out of here. Are You, do you shut people down? Ne never. But there's some annoying circumstances. Like If somebody did that, if you're at dinner with a girl Yeah. And somebody barged and like ignored them, you'd be mad. You'd be like, dude, that's fucking crazy.


Rude. I had a guy come up to me and from behind And I, I feel arms wrapped around me on the side like this. He just Come on, man. Like that without even asking. Yeah. You know, I mean, he just snuck in and like, let's, You know what I mean? I was like, what are you doing? Yeah. That's weird. Yeah. I'll always take a photo. Yeah. But if it's, I'm with, if I, I'm with my wife at dinner, I'm like, dude, I'm, that's fucking dinner man. That's in. But also the kind of person that just is chill about is like, thinks that that's chill. You're like, are you okay? Yeah. I'm at dinner, we're eating food. That's the worst time to approach someone hands down. Yeah. Well, just, any other time I was shitting also would be, I actually Would fucking, I did have one time at a, at a urinal.

Sometimes I go to celebrity ones, but like, You know, He does, dude, he loves celebrity meetings.


Yeah. Who's gonna be there? No. Oh. Who else is getting clean? Yeah. Yeah. I wanna ask you a question. And obviously I'm not asking you to reveal actual details, but in a broader sense, have you ever been to a celebrity meeting where a celebrity reveals something? Oh. Oh yeah. And it's just like, your dopamine rush is just like, Oh yeah. Oh man, I've heard some crazy shit from gigantic people. Really? Fuck. I go to this meeting, I'm gonna tell you what night. Yeah. Yeah.

If you call me and go, Hey, he let me in the meeting, I would be like, How funny would that be if I got into more important meetings than you Yy ya Dude, you gotta do it.


I'm Gonna do it, dude. I'm gonna do it. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. But I like to go to the regular ones, like the plumbers and all that stuff, because it's like, I wanna feel normal. Yeah. But also, like, you're also the No wait, that's no what I'm saying. Lemme rephrase that. But don't you wanna be the big shot at the No, No, no. He does. Yes, he does. Cut all that out. Shut up. Cut that out. Stop it. They're All like, we're just regular guys. And you're like, me too. No, because the, with all alcoholism, right. It's just like, you wanna have commonality with people. Yeah. And a connection. Right. And I wanna bond people through all alcoholism. Mm. And Story. You share a lot. Are you a Share? I do. You do?


Yeah. And dude, He loves na share. Yeah. He gets up there. In fact, I, He kills, You know what I don't like when it's like, so there's two types of, there's three types of meetings. Okay. Okay. Speaker meeting. Right. And then there's like a circle where pe everyone shares, but the worst kind. And I went to one Tuesday like this where it was like, anyone can share it, but you have to raise your hand. Oof. Right. So I can't me, me, I can't do it. No. Right. And so when some somebody doesn't raise their hand, they'll pick somebody. So sometimes they'll go pick me, pick, pick me. You know what I mean? But I can't raise my hand because You feel like it's too desperate.


Yeah. I just want to, yeah. Because it's like, You know, And I'm always because You're 'cause you're an attention whore. No, I'm not. No. We all we're standups. That's Okay. I am. I am. Yeah, We are. You are. Yeah. I'm, you're an attention. Look at how you just reacted to that. You're an attention whore. Yeah. And those things are, I mean, that's, so You'll speak, but not if you have to raise your hand. So in what circumstance do you see, so Some meetings are this, He wants them, he doesn't want to, he doesn't wanna be like, pick me. Yes. He, Some meetings are like this where the secretary, this is, we point to you. You don't raise your hand. Those are ones I lie You like that. Yeah. Y yeah. Could you share something with us that you've shared at one of those?


Really? Sure. 'cause if I say it, you, you, it's gonna cr you're gonna cringe. No, we won't. I promise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're your friends. Well, I'll like example, You know what I mean? You know, I'll say something like, You know, Socrates once said, a life not self examined is not a life worth living. You know what I mean? And so what I love about AA is like, it's internal. You know what I mean? And it's like, it's about looking in the mirror and looking in inside yourself. And so, and so, You know, I do the steps. You know, I think it's very important, You know, the weight lifted from eight and nine, You know what I mean? It is absolutely incredible.


Oh. You know what I mean? And I think it's very impor, that kind of thing. Thank You Robert. That like that. And then everybody, Well, no, but sometimes they'll have a music and they'll play you off. They'll play you off like the Emmys. That's incredible. Like, they know when you, they Yeah. Say you're done. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. You're like talking about, You know, was molested who let the dogs, You know, Really Cool. Yeah. And you're like, okay, I'm done. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's pretty incredible that you give them that shtick. I have so many different shtick I can use. You know what I mean? When are you actually being real? When there's a hot girl there? Mm. No, dude. How many times have you scooped one up? A million? No, It's gonna be S One One Throughout my whole life.


Sarah. Oh, Sarah, that's right. Yeah. I shouldn't blow ity, but Yeah. Yeah. That was the only one. I don't go there to like hook up. Is it It's against the code. No, they call it the 13th step. What is that? It's these, it's so gross. It's like these old timers guys, people with time, men and women, they see a newcomer and they go in And it's like, That's, that's the 13 step. Yeah. You're, yeah. It's just, it's not in the steps, but it's like, No, I know. It's a hypothetical. You're, you're taking advantage of people's vulnerability and desperation because you don't get sober unless you lost a lot. You know what I mean? No, no. If you lost a lot, you get, did I say that wrong?


I have no idea. You have To be a very low point in your Life to sober the worst. You know? I mean, people that are newcomers have lost a lot. Right. You know what I mean? And they've, You know. Well, It's a great place to be a predator is what you're saying. Right. What I'm saying is, is that some people, not probably 1% Right. They'll go in and not predator, but they'll like, You know, Hey, let me take you to after the meeting Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Take you to lunch. Take you Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Let me pick you up for meetings when their intention is this girl's hot. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's unfathomable And I think it's fucking wrong. Mm. Wow. You're a really good person. Except That it's just, here's the thing. And I, and I'm, let's be real for a second.


Okay. The whole point of it is to get out of yourself. Right. So, You know, when there's a newcomer, I like, if I'm sitting there in a meeting and a newcomer goes, I'm a newcomer, I'll always reach my hand out and go, Hey man, welcome. You know, if you need anything, let me know. You know What I mean? It's nice. I think you're being a jerk jerk. I said, that's nice. Yeah. When you do this though. Well, I, I, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm listening. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, anyway, let's move on from that. No, I Said that's nice. I was being nice. I was being generous.

My guess is that the girl you're dating has a king Charles. No, it's Not about King Charles the Dog.


It's a do dog named God. That's an adorable dog. No, King Charles. The, the alpha alpha dog. What is this? That guy? What about him? Oh yeah. This video's great. Yeah. It's so great. So what? See that I'm just, I'm just trying to ingest. So Basically in China, You haven't seen this video. Is that what he is? I have never seen it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. In China where there's like a, oh, I Know. The video ends then. No, it's not like that. It's a sanctuary. So there's a dog sanctuary, right. And there's hundreds of dogs there, right? I'm boring you. No, it just, I mean, so many jokes are running. It's unbelievable. I mean, you're like, literally, I'm like loading a gun.


I I know You're like, in China there's a hundred dogs. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Kept as a sanctuary. I'm like, this is a buffet. But go ahead. Alright. So what I'm saying is, is that, but there's one dog, his name is King Charles, and he's the alpha dog. But he's not the biggest Right. He's super small. Right. And the way the dogs behave in front of him. So this video in itself is, you see King Charles is not in it. Right. A bunch of dogs are fighting. Right. Right. King Charles. But it's, it's in the subtle details. Yes. So, right. Exactly. So play again. See, the dogs are going crazy. They're all fighting. Yeah. Right. They're all fighting at each other, yelling at each other. Here comes King Charles, that one.


See the push pause that's there. Rewind It a little bit. One dog bowed to him. Exactly. Yeah. So what the dog to his left bows, the other one gets up and leaves. That's the most Chinese shit I've ever seen. They bowed, they taught that dog how to bow. It's fucking bow. It's amazing. This brown dog leaves. Why go? Yeah. The brown dog's like, fucked. I'm outta here. Look at that. The rest of them. Whoa. The other one goes into the gate is like, I'm out. I'm out. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's slowly, Everyone Leaves. Everyone leaves. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I've been obsessed with this guy. This Is how you see yourself. Smaller but commanding. Oh, wow. Is that, is that a, a real observation, you think, though?


Is that relevant to you? That you feel like this, this is the dog you identify with. You're like, I'm not as big as the other dogs, but I should be respected the way that they Respond. Let, let, let, let me tell you the dog that he is in this video. Start the video over. Okay. I'll tell you who Bobby is. Okay. Okay. All these dogs are fighting Pause. You see the dog sleeping? Yes. That is fucking you. That is fucking you. And that dog gets up and goes, look at This. Oh, fuck this, fuck this. That's me, dude. A hundred percent. That's you. That's literally you. There's no argument about it.

Didn't you bail on an interview? I'm the king Charles and you bailed on another fucking gig. Okay. And then look at this and you try to make excuses. And I put my foot on your throat, but it Does give you a life, it gives me a perspective of like, You know what I mean, sizes and everything. You're Yeah. Nice. You know what I mean? Yeah. And the other day I was at the improv, there was a gigantic door guy. He's like six three. He's standing out front And I walked up to, and like his breasts, You know what I mean?
