Might've been my daughter's. My daughter's asked my body count the other day. What is your body Con six? This year? No, My whole life. Holy six. Your whole life. Yeah. My whole life. Oh, my. You are like a Christian dude. You're, you're like a Mormon or something. This is insane. No. I Don know who I was just telling this to, but like, I, I definitely, the problem is, wow, I was just ba I was, I was not, the first time I did it, it was really bad.


Who was I just telling this to? And I, it was really bad. And so after that, like just, I, I didn't perform well. I came fast. I, my dick wasn't even her inner, it was between her butt cheek and the bed. Mm. And then it was like, it was such a nightmare that I was so, like, I remember getting into the bathroom after it was done looking in the mirror. Whoa. And so it was so humiliating. And then even like, my next two times were so still just not, wasn't good at it. And I thought I'd be good at it. It's like saying like, it's like, it's like being like, you're Good, you're good. No, now I've gotten better. Yeah. Yeah. But I was not, But are you sure? I'm Sure. No, because that's what Leanne says. No, No, no. Now I'm good. Yeah. But Leanne could be lying to you. You could. Oh, she probably is.


Then You're not good. No. Yeah. Maybe I'm not. Yeah, yeah. I'm telling you, you're not good. It's the Reason, like, people that Don't, I wanna say you're not good People that don't sing karaoke.

No. Tell me about the, I like, I, I didn't even talk during sex. Like I was silent. Like Helen Keller, You'd moan like her. I agree. I'd freak out just, and then someone would Come and go, that's not good. That's not good. Bread. Bread. Yeah. Fill the air. Bouncing off my hand, Helen. Yeah. Wow. You know, I wanna learn. There should be a statistic. Right. And I don don't know if this is a fact, don don't think they have a statistic for this, but I believe that for fat Asian guys in America, right.


I think I have the biggest body count. Oh, what's your body count? I can't tell you What whatcha talking about. When did you start keeping secrets? Me and your open fucking books, Bob. Okay. I don't, I I I don't know. You like if ballpark. I Ballpark. I literally don't Know. If, you had to ballpark it. Like, let's just ballpark it in Asian countries. Okay. Are you China, where it's like so big can wrap your head around it? No, no, no. What? I mean, are you Japan where you're just, well, You can't compare it with a Chinese guy in China because it's like, I, I feel like it's easier. What Do you mean? Oh, Like if I was a Chinese guy in China, it'd be easier to get growth. My point is is but coming to America, being a fatty Asian guy and getting white chicks and Mexican all this harder, that's fucking key.


It's challenging. That's really difficult. I feel like I have the highest body count. I think it's easier when you pay though. Wait, are you talking about your body Count? That's so, you know what I'm, I'm trying to come here with positivity, dude. Right. And that your little jokes dude. Right. I'm gonna let them slide today. I wish I had paid for sex.
