And then Bobbylee got up and about two minutes in his dick came out and all the drunks in the hall loved him.


And it's been like that for three years. And then I think, I think on the third year, I remember, I remember went up to Bobbylee And I, I tried to talk to him.

But on the other hand, it's a cheap way to get out of a seam that you don't know how to fit. Right. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Wow. I think if you're well endowed, you can't do male nudity. I think it's only good if you're three inches and under and then you, then You can get away with it. That's what I say to him all the time.

I would've never pegged that. It's our favorite movie. I I see you liking it. In fact, Like it, there's, there's Asian lady that's at the cos that coat. I, I worked with her before. Oh, the, in the movie. Yeah. In the movie, there's a Asian lady that gives people, like, I think Pacino a coat or something.


Like a Coat at a coat check. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And I worked with her once And I kept bombarding her with like, what, what was it? Like this and that. You know what I mean? How embedded in the zeitgeist is Coffees for closers. It's like a, it's such like a Yeah. It's a thing that literally everybody knows. Yeah. I, I wrote this play, Glen Glen, Gary Glen Ross. And I did it as a movie. And I put in this extra scene for Alec Baldwin that says, coffee is for closers. It's all, everybody remembers about the stupid. It's funny how, why did, like, why it's, it's weird when things get picked out. Like I did, I work with Pete Fairley, same kind of thing. And Fairley says, the thing that you think people will pick out of it is probably the thing that they least will recognize. And the thing that you can't fucking believe they took like the coffees for closers.


You never thought that that was like a pop a moment that people would steal and then No, it would be like, used over in other things forever. 'cause it is, they put it in fucking like, family Guy or other shows will reference it. Yeah. That's great. And what everybody loves. Everybody loves everybody adores sh you And Yes. Not everybody. Yes. Okay. Oh, wait a second. Everybody In this fucking Room. So my, wait, my, my producer calls me the fuck up, man. Today, my producer calls up, he says, Dave, you've been doing this forever. I don't want to tell you your business, but don't forget to, to plug the movie. Let's do that. Then The movie's Called, we'll do it later. Yeah. Okay. Later we do it. Do It later. We don't it do do fucking later. Here's the thing. In the movie, he's got a line.


He plays a prisoner. And, and, and the other guy, Evan, Evan John, I, who is the guy who he's turning out is always punk says, but how do You know all this shit? And his line is, baby, I do this for a living. So that's, everybody's Talking about that. Yeah. I was gonna say, I, I think you're being humble. I think Dave does know. I think, You know, when we're doing the play, he's there. It's not like Dave's gone and the play's dead, and then we're just putting it up. He's in the crowd. He's, he's not watching us for the most part. I mean, I don't know what you're watching, but what, what, what I'm, what I, what I, when I'm backstage watching you watch, it's a whole lot of, You know, he's in the back. He's all the way in the back watching the backs of heads. Wow. Wow. And so, like, when heads start to like start looking around and stuff, he's gotta fix his script.


Oh shit. At least what it feels like. The stuff that gets revised and we don't get much of it. And it happens pretty quick. And it happens pretty early in the process. But he'll come to the first 5, 6, 7 different shows. He'll watch the crowd move around and you'll get these little revisions. And that'll be the last of it. See, that's the thing. A lot of movies, most of the people who make movies never see their movie with a live audience. Not Right. None of, none of the executives do. Right. So they're, what they're doing is completely theoretical because you gotta sit in the, in the audience and say, where did the a attention fade? Why? And how can I fix it? Right. Because if not, what the hell are you doing? Well, About focus Groups. That's why they're there. Right. You know? But it's so rare. Test a movie Or No, no. Focus groups are bullshit.


That's For marketing department. Oh, I see, I see. Okay. Yeah. Focus, I'll tell you a good focus groups here, because what you do with the focus group is you ask the people to become critics. So you're bringing out the worst in them. Just like you bring out, sit, think about it. Think about it. We go to a restaurant, right. And we have a pretty good time. And then the, the chef comes out and say, we're gonna sit down for half an hour and we're gonna talk. What did you like? What would you like different? Well, I don't want to feel stupid, so I'm not gonna say I had a good time. Yeah. You Gotta have something, You know. Yeah. I, I maybe a little bit more salt in that thing. So there was a guy called, there was a guy called Joe Ferrell who invented this, like in the seventies, eighties, I was doing a bunch of studio movies. This thing where the people would sit in a, watch the movie on a screen and they'd have dials.


Oh, right. And if you put the dial this way, it means I liked it. And you put the dial that way means I don't like it. And they would have graphs and graphs and graphs and all the p and a production and, and advertising money would get allocated based on the graphs. Mm. And Joe Ferrell made this huge amount of money with these stupid fucking graphs. And I was talking to him one day, I did a movie and I said, well, You know, Joe, I guess the numbers aren't quite as good as, as they could be. And he said, well, how good would you like them to be? Oh, Yeah. It all a scam. A Scam. Yeah. We can make the dials only lean one way. No. Yeah. That he's gonna, no, the dials are a fucking scam.


Right. He's, if You can, a a smarter man would've said, Joe, wait here a second. Oh my God. Is this your $50,000 or mine? Oh, Right. He was just bribing. Yeah. Right. Oh, brilliant. Wow, wow, wow. Brilliant. It is fucking Brit. It's gross, but it's brilliant. Yeah. But that's the throes of this business. You've seen a hundred thousand times. You've seen all those tricks. You've seen him come and go, right. Yeah. Exactly. So, but the thing is that the bi, we just did this movie very cheap, very effective. Let, let's talk about it. Oh, no. But the thing is, we made up with ourselves. 'cause Shya said, we just did the play, the plays over, let's do a movie. So now the complete bi the business is completely changed.


Mm. And the studio system's just completely over. Yeah. It's just dead. Doesn't exist anymore because the technology has changed. Mm. Right, right. Which is kind of great. It's, it's, unless you have an interest in the old technology and you wanna spend $250 million remaking a bad version of Snow White, and, and You know, you could take all the people who, who saw it and stick 'em in a fucking school bus. Right. But nobody's taken responsibility for that because they're all bureaucrats making bureaucratic decisions. David, David, did you see Snow White? I didn't see it. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't watch movies. Oh, he doesn't? Oh, you don't want at all Understand there was a lot of anti old movies antisemitism in it from this one girl.


But if I, I wanna see it, I'll just go to Columbia University. Is is that true? It's, it's, it's got a bunch of anti-Semitic. No. One of the girls came out and she said, You know, free Oh, Oh. The main girl we talked Rachel Zary show. Rachel Zary. Yeah. Snow White Girl. Zary. She apparently also said that the Prince was fucking stalking Her. Yeah, that's right. I remember that. Fucking We're gonna make Snow Red where he's a murderer. He stalks her and actually gets her and kill her. Yeah. And he uses the dwarves as little slaves. We wrote it. Yeah. I don dunno if we're ever gonna make it. Yeah. Yeah. But we're gonna, we're gonna, we'll fucking try. Yeah. It But you've, you, when you say that, that the studio system is so fucked and you guys made this movie now and you did it for cheap, when you say cheap, what is cheap now?


The same amount To amount to play. It'd just be like mounting the plane in Chicago instead of spending that money mounting in Chicago. We just filmed it with Dave. Yeah. Because the secret is, what does it cost to make a movie? You can make the, You can make the 500 grand movie for a hundred million dollars and You can do the Make a hundred million dollar movie for, for for for for 500 grand. Yeah. The, The reason that I, I am curious. I don't, I get, I don't need to know the number. Not to pry it. Just, we're creating our own shit a lot now. Right. Like, we built this little world. We did an animated show. We did a game show. We're doing it on our own. And they always wanna know how much, and we don't really, we don't know divulge. 'cause we don't really know. We Don't know.

It really does work. Yes. Yes. When you see that, you go, it works. Yeah. He's that example for me. Yeah. You know, when I, when I was, I was doing this play, I was still low. I would drag him to meetings with me. He would show up to meetings with, well, he's loves stories. So our rooms got stories for days. Wow. So he would just go in there to listen to these stories with me. Yeah. Sometimes I wouldn't wanna go by myself. I'd say, Dave, come with me. You know? Yeah. That's the kind of cat he is. So, Said he saved my life. I was going through a real, a real difficult, really difficult. Yeah. We met at a good time. He'd saved my life. And I would go to the meetings and the guy, one guy would say, You know, my wife left me.


And she took all my money. And then I realized that, that she'd, she she'd given me very bad disease And I couldn't even go dating anymore. And I bought a gun and bought and people and, and the room weren Laughing. Say Fucking thing. Get the fuck Outta to tears. To tears. Am I lying? No, it's the only Way. Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Yep. Because we relate. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. It is that, You know, I mean, I've been in and out since I was 17. Yeah. I had 17 years at one, at one point. Like In the program. Yeah. I know you, you, you were in the rooms when I first came in. Yeah. At Moorpark Moore Park. I remember Park. I still go there. Something even Before Radford. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like, but at se at 17, what a gift as a kid Yeah.


To get that. You know what I mean? Yeah. I wouldn't be here without it. How, How did you, how did you even get in? Like, 'cause your dad wasn't, it wasn't family. No. My dad was a violent alcoholic. Sure. Among other things. Thanks for bringing that up. Well, You sure? Yeah. You're welcome. But, but he didn't bring you in the rooms? No, I went to, I mean, when I was in high school, I went to a bunch of rehabs. Yeah. And then the, I think the third one it clicked. Yeah. And I met this old Korean man by name. You know Dan? Yeah. Dan. Yeah. Yeah. And when I was a kid, and he had 17 years at that point, he was at this, he long white hair tattoos full Korean. But he was adopted long ago. And he was my sponsor.


And it was my junior year in high school when I met him. And I just gave him a, what, 50, 60 year cake or whatever. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, he's still like a part of my life. Yeah. I mean, but yeah, without that I'd be dead. I think I Like Elijah's like that. For me, I got a bunch of these, like Jay, there's like 40 guys. I would tap and say, Oh man, if not for them. Yeah. That's the beauty of, I mean, that's right. You're here is life. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's right. While you guys were shooting the movie or the play is when you were going to these meetings? Well, no, when we, when we No, when we were filming, we were filming. When we were filming, we, we was grind mode. And then I would catch my meetings when I can get him at night. Usually he's, he way overwhelmed trying to mount, especially the way we did it. It was just, there was no like extra time.


Yeah. But before all that, You know, there it, because he is who he is. And, and maybe it's just my thing. There's a getting over Dave mammo process. You know what I mean? You gotta get over it. You just gotta get over it. It'd be like being asked to play Batman. Like, you just gotta get over it and get to the work. It's like, You can, You can scare yourself to complete mute. You, You can terrify yourself. First day he walks in and You know, you're about to be in a play that he wrote. It's one of the scariest moments of my life for like the first table read. So like, I showed up to the table read. I don't know really what I'm doing. I never did a play. I know it's a David Mamet play. What I know is like, that's the pinnacle, like get every word, every punch. So I show up at the table, read I'm Off Book. That's not normal.


Normally, You know, you're reading Yeah. We know. I'm scared. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Yeah. So, so that fear helped me. But the fear had to wear off at a certain point. And I don't know if it it ever wore off during the play. Mm. But we became friends in the midst of that. Like close, close. Like closer than I'd been. And with most any director I'd ever worked with also. You were the only one Off Book? No. No. Well, Evan was, well, I was so nervous. He was so, I was Nervous. I was scared. So like, Evan has done plays before. Yeah. Plus Evan and him already have a relationship I didn't have with Dave. I, I met Dave through fan letter. You know, I've been trying to get to Dave for 10 years, You know, and Wow. There'll be a project that pops up and I'll, yeah, I'll do anything. What do you want me to do? And, and then it'll come, it'll go, You know, or, or somebody will take it from him. Like, we were gonna do this JFK movie and they just took it.


He was Gonna play Oswald. Yeah. And that, and I was psyched. That's Oh wow. Oh, that's gonna be so great. Yeah, Oswald, that's, that's one of the great roles, You know, you could ever have. So, and in the midst of grinding on that, they took it from him and then he fell into a dark spell. 'cause it's like somebody taking your baby from you. And, and then, and then it was, and our play was still up as all this was going on. So it was a matter of like, me and Evan, like, ah, We got it. 'cause he's captain, we gotta get captain back up. You know, we gotta get his spirits back up. So we almost threw it out. Like, like, no way. Maybe he'll bite. 'cause usually we throw ideas to him. He doesn't, has no, has no interest. Right. He'll say something like, yeah, no, I hear you. Unless it's, unless it's to the work. If it's about the work, This was such a great idea. 'cause we did the play.


It was fucking great. And, and we could've run it forever. Except you can't ask the actors to come in and work for 1995 a week. We Would've though. We were Love It. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway. And so Cheyenne Evan come and say, let's do a movie. So I say, no, we can't do a fucking, what are you talking about takes forever. And we have to go and talk to the assholes in the valley. And then I said, no, no, no, no, no, dude, we're gonna, we're gonna do it ourselves. Yeah. We're gonna raise the money ourselves. We're gonna do it ourselves. How? So I say, how are we gonna do it? I say, fuck it. I don't know. We're just going to do it. And so, like a lot of the great things in my life, I got dragged into it kicking and screaming. Yeah. Yeah. He wasn't into it To be the best, the best thing that, that I've done in, in, in decades the most changed my life.


We Were prepping this behind his back actually. Oh wow. Yeah. We were prepping the thing, trying to get it mounted. Obviously we couldn't hire nobody, But we were trying to get everything. Me and Evan trying to get it more, mostly Evan trying to get everything sorted so he could come in and sort of, You know, turnkey go. And then he had to pick his dp and then that was his whole thing. But I, I remember there was like a month where we were trying to sneakily get this thing prepped and mounted behind his back. 'cause he thought, oh, no way you could do it. And I, I kept like pushing it towards Louis CK content. Kept saying, Oh man, Louis cck boy, Dave Louis CCK matters, Dave. You know, he matters for a bunch of reasons, but he should matter for us a lot. Right now he's kind of the guy. He's doing it. And he's, he's winning independent, You know, he's, he's pushing through all the BS and he's getting to the crowd, You know?


Yeah. He's getting And you like, I just came off of Coppola land. This is a guy who's got power. He can make the entire industry flex. Like he'll make 'em all turn based on a Did you like the movie? No. Okay. But, but I love him. You know, easy. Yeah. Yeah. And we fought all through the thing. 'cause it wasn't my dream. And I was trying to learn his dream, which he always trying to do. When you're on a movie. Yeah. You're trying to learn your guy's dream. Sometimes those dreams aren't easily accessible. Sometimes you feel like you're not old enough to get to the dream. Mm. With with with me and him, it felt like that. It felt like, oh, You know, shit, I don't know about, You know? Yeah. Because I'm a baby and you done lived a life, You know, so I would acquiesce him. But I remember he could, he could make the industry move, You know, because he had that kind of power. And then I look at his accomplishments, and then I look at Dave's accomplishments And I don't see this drastic divide.


I feel like, You know, I respect the stuff Dave did as much as I respect the stuff stuff Francis did. But Francis had the shot to get to the audience. They kind of made a clear path for him, You know, he was like the darling of the industry. Right? Yeah. And so, I don't know how many resident geniuses you boys have, but I don't have any, You know? Yeah. The fact that I know Dave feels like some kind of miracle. So then it was like, ah, well if I could just work on Dave's stuff forever, that would be a dream come true. Oh wow. Yeah. So then it was like, how do we get Dave a channel? How do you get Dave his own Dave Mammo channel? You know? Yeah. That's how the conversation started. They Dragged me into it. So what we discovered is, You don't need Hollywood. You don't need a bunch of money. You need some talent.


You need an idea, and you need a fucking telephone. Funny to hear you talk about talent, because that's very funny to hear you talk about talent. Anybody who's a David Mammot fan. Talent's not a big David Mamet word, persistence. Mm. Ah. You know, like, just like grinding, throwing water at the same fucking mark on the stone for long enough. And eventually it'll happen. I think even with you, because I feel like with you, it's like I have to be careful. I can't really tell you all the way how I feel. I respect you too much. You know what I mean? I kind of have to through Evan. Evan because Evan and him are, have a, have something I didn't have. You know, I'm not spending every weekend all the time, You know, with Dave like that. Dave. So Evan was good at translating things that I couldn't, like, You know, like I would just come off too thirsty.


I think I would scare you. 'cause I'd be too ambitious. Too thirsty. 'cause when I say stuff like, Dave, I'll do anything you ever want to do. I think you're the greatest writer. It almost sounds like bullshit. No, it's not bullshit. Listen, the first moment, the first, No, he goes, this is not bullshit. I am the greatest Facts Back. He knew facts. No, No. Best response ever. Listen, The, from the first moment, we had a mutual friend who eventually sold both of us out. And he, he, my mutual friend was having a lunch with Shaya. And I'd always admired Chi's work very, very much. And I sat down and my mutual friend says, oh, sit on shy ly above Dave. I say, hi, shy ly have such, I so admire you. And Shya says, that's not necessary. Huh. And it just, it was fucking shocking.


Wow. It's like you, it's fucking shocking. It's like I saw into who this, this wonderful man is in, in a second. I'm a human being. You're a human being. It's a pleasure to meet you. Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. What's the movie called? Oh, Henry Johnson Henry Johnson movie.com. That's how you get it. Henry Johnson. Oh, doubt. Now that's, everyone can watch it now. Yeah. Yeah. And then what, can you give us a brief synopsis of what it's about or, I mean, I, Dave would be better at it. The way I see this, like Yeah. These two life, these two lifelong friends, an old guy and an old woman. They've been high school sweethearts and they've both grown old together, but they meet again. And their lives seem to be older, but they go on a road trip.


And I'm kidding. What fucking Movie? No, no. This is, this is na. There's some other thing going on in his head, as he said. That's not the thing me we made together as he Said it, I was like, this Isn't it. No, it's about like empathy. It's about, it's about like overdosing on empathy. If I was gonna put it in a sentence, that's what I, what I read when I read it, it was, it's about overdosing on empathy. It's about how empathy can actually fuck you fully if you, if you overdose Or like, You know, you sometimes, You know, like the dog eating trade in China. I'm just giving you an example of empathy. When I think the movie's about, hold on. Wait, we getting a dog eating now? No, no. Just let me see me through. See, He doesn't eat breakfast. Fucking Hungry. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, I, I hate these people that, You know what I mean?


Do this to these kind animals. And I go to China, right. Right. And I'm like, and I'm like, Oh my God, look at this puppy. And the puppy goes, ah, right. And he eats my face. Right. Yeah. Is It like that, about That? Just like that. Just like that. How do you think about No. Am I right or No? No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's a, so we did this thing as a play. We're doing it as a movie. And it's about a guy who is so compassionate that he ruins everything around him and everyone takes advantage of him. He ends up going to prison and he ends up getting his life changed by the boss Conn over there. And then some shit happens. Wow. Some shit happens.


Yeah. Yeah. Pull up the site just so we have it. Yeah. For everybody. What is this shit happens. You get like a little fondled or what? What Do you Mean me? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. You mean, oh, you went right there, huh? It could have been a, it could have been 5,000 things. That's the movie I wanna see. Anyway. Okay. How long Henry Johnson Shaya. How long, when you're done filming this, how long does it take you to kind of clear your head out of it? Well, I've never done a play, so I still, I run these lines in my shower still. You do? Wow. Oh yeah. They're so tattooed to your head. I don't know. I mean, I never, I never prepped anything like that. Lines never really mattered to me. Yeah. And now, You know, after working with Dave, they kind of, I don know, he, they don't matter to him either.


I didn't know that. Walking in though, You know, I walking in, I thought, you better get every fucking comma. Right. Well, but see, that's the trick is the best thing in the world if you're rehearsing a play, is tell everybody, show up. Learning your lines. Don't show up if you're not letter. Perfect. And most actors don't know that anymore because they've been badly trained and badly rehearsed for you. And they want to sit down and talk about where they went to school and what their character's True for lunch and all this bullshit. It's true. So Shaya, because he don't know any better, knows better than any of them. Just show up, learning the fucking lines. 'cause if the actors show up in a rehearsal, late day one learning, knowing their lines, what do you do? You block the play. It takes you three days and then you put it on.


Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. Do you say anything with like, someone like me? Right. I don't know my lines ever. You know what I mean? Say what? I don I never know my lines. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. But would you yell at me? No, I'd say learn your lines. Oh, that's it. And you would No he Wouldn't. No, you would. Yeah. Yes you would. I'm telling you, bobbylee you would and you'd be great. Even the magic of Mammoth couldn't get this guy. No, no. I think his mine. The both of you. I think the both of you be great. I mean, Well wait a second, but you're a standup comic. Yes. You say like, wait a second, two guys go into a Whore house. Whore House. Yeah, of course it's a whore house. But you're gonna grow up on the, on, on On the bar. The bar. Yeah. Well, you gotta know your lines. Right? Gotta know Your lines. Oh, I gotta you telling, If you're telling jokes, you gotta know your lines.


Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I Get it. I'm not even lying. But you memorized the bit, You know what I mean? You No, I, we memorize where we need to get to. Right? Yeah. So it's like exactly the world, the words around it. As long as we can get to the joke. Yeah. What actually makes it funny. Yeah, that's fine. But you are, you guys do line by like word by word, right? Yeah. Yeah. I can only, only only because it's better if I could adlib. If I could, if I could ad lib better lines, I would Yeah, yeah, yeah. And have on every other show. Yeah. But when, when you're Here with him, of course it's, it's Aaron Sorkin him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's no need to help. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Is it hard to, I mean, I just, I'm gonna sound stupid. I I just need to throw it out if, because I'm dumb.


You know what I mean? It is just that, is it hard to make, write a movie? Hey, listen, It's too Hard. If you had Stormy Daniels on, would you say, what'd you say? Where do you get your ideas? Yeah, We actually, she's coming on after this. She's later. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Well, Yeah. Is it hard to write a fucking movie, dear David Mame? Is it hard to write a movie? You don I'm Not Ani or whatever his name is from the fucking show. Tani. Yeah. Whatever his name is. Write it Down. I can hit it every night. Ho anani Ho anani. I can can't hit it every time, dude. You know what I mean? I'm sorry dude. I just throw it out there. Yeah, Well, don't throw either.


Just fucking, alright. Alright. Just underhand. Ask him what you really wanna ask him. Be honest. That's Not a bad question. There had to be some That'd be, I got you. There had to be some harder than the others. Well, it is very hard to shy Protected. I'll tell you, I wrote this play a long time ago called American Buffalo. And it was a series of sketches about these thieves. I was hanging out with playing poker and they were really good. And I did it off Broadway with a bunch of sketches. And a guy called Ulu Gross Bart, who was a great director. You should see his movie Straight Time, Ulu Gross. Bart comes to me and says, if you find a, if You can figure out the plot, I'll put it on Broadway. So I went from being an out of work cab driver to, I had to sit down and figure out how to write a plot, which is very difficult.


And then he put it on Broadway. So I said, oh, I get it. I know what keeps the asses in the seats a plot, which means making the audience wonder what happens next. Hmm. That's a plot. If You can write a plot, the dialogue doesn't have to be good. Which we know because we see films in tech, in translation. Right, right. All right. Right. We wanna know what happens next. Oh, wow. Yeah. So it's very hard to write a plot because it's an equation and the mind always wants to come up with the easiest thing. Right. But the easiest thing is not the, probably not the best thing, because if You can beat yourself to the punchline, the audience can beat you to the punchline. Ah. So in comedy, what you gotta do is you gotta beat the audience to the punchline, make give them enough to wonder what happens next.


Right. A Penguin and nun and a rhinoceros go into a whore house. Yeah. They want to know what happens next. I, I do. Yeah. I do really want, of course. You know, so what does happen? What, what does happen? You, You know, oh Yeah, yeah, yeah. You climb inside the rhino hole. The penguin Fucks the nun, and the rhiner Eats some balls. Oh no, I'm wrong. Oh, no, that's not It. No, no. I was Like, we climb inside the rhino hole, But let me tell you. So A Penguin, A Nun, and an Ostrich. Go into a whore house. Where's a rhino? An an old gr He's taking tickets And they say, the whore house is an old brick building on a quiet residential street, the kind of street where maybe your grandfather and grandmother were. I want to know what happened in the whore house.


I don't want you to tell me about how it was built. Right?

But did you ever write with other people though? Or do you just, you Okay. I'm trying to help you, bro. Trying to help you from the slot. You know, hold on. A couple of times I wrote with other people, but at some point, I, I stopped doing it because even when I wrote with them, I said, You know, thanks a lot. Go sit down. Tell us about your time in Chicago. Can you though, 'cause we talked a little bit off air about Yeah. When he was talking about, You know, prior to Steppenwolf and prior to, prior to every theater in the city. Yeah. What were you, what were you doing? I was, well, I was, I got outta college and I was unemployable because I didn't know anything.


I didn't know anybody. And the idea that someone was going to support me, meaning my parents, was un unheard of. Yeah. I mean, and both in my generation and, and in my family. So I was like, I came back And I got a bunch of jobs. I worked at everything in the world. 'cause you could always get a job in Chicago. And I got involved in, in, in theater And I saw some stuff that I found very provocative. So I started writing plays about it. Right. One was, I, as I I said, I used to play in this poker game with a bunch of thieves. And I really, and then I used to work in a boiler room selling land over to telephone. Boiler room. Used to be you put 20 guys in a phone in, in, on a phone in a room.


And they have to call up the people and say, oh, You know, Mr. Lee, I see that you've we're interested in land because you wrote in for our brochure about land in Arizona. Well, it's kinda like Glen Gallian Orno. Exactly. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I got, I saw these things that, that interested me. Wow. And then I started writing, reading Checkoffs plays. Anton Checkoff. Is it the Star? Is that the Star Trek guy? Or, oh, The other one. Star Wars. Not Star Trek. Star Wars. Okay. I just threw it out. No, there was a Guy called Checkup and Star Wars. No, No. I was, Hey, wait a second. I I got a question for you people. How do you, how do you remember the difference between Star Trek and Star Wars? I can tell you, he got to see a Million things about it.


Whatcha talking about? He can tell you. He can tell you he's obsessed with Star Trek. They're A completely different world. Which Is Star Trek. Star Trek is based in earth. On Earth, like the society that we live in. Yeah. But like hundreds of years from now. Yeah. And then we have a, You know what's so funny? It's a crew. It's a, the enterprise, it's a crew of explorers from Earth. Yeah. That explore. It's William Shatner. Yes. It's William Shatner. Yeah. Shatner. Yeah. Okay, good. Did you like him? Well, Yeah, because I, I, I, I'm mad at him because he fucked me once. Not, not literally, but in a job. How, Oh my God. It was the worst. I get a call from Build the Billboard Awards.


Remember they used to say these stupid award shows, these annoying award shows. I don't remember that. Okay. We want you to do a sketch with William Shatner. 'cause they knew I was a Star Trek fan. And I go, yeah, I'll do it. So they fly me in. It's basically a scene with me and Willie Shatner at a poker table. Right. So I'm sitting there waiting for William Shatner. Right. And he comes in and there was another guy that they hired too, from la I forgot it. It was a black guy. I love black people. Anyway, anyway, Willie Shatner goes in and he goes, you're out. You're out. And then they dragged me out of the tent and he goes, he just rewrote it just now. So I've got, I'm back on the plane and flew back to la. Wow. Yeah. Whoa. William Shatner, no blacks, no Asians. That's his way. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Now we know who he really is. No Aurora and no fucking No, no. But wait a second. I got a question about William Shatner. Okay. Yeah. But it just occurred to me. Yeah. He's reading his newspaper out in the back by his swimming pool. Right. And his wife, who was an Olympic, like an a, a u swimmer, his swimming around the pool, swimming around the pool, swimming round pool. And she comes over and apparently, according to him, he put his ha foot accidentally on her head and she drowned. She died. Yeah. Oh, my question is, what was he reading? I'm sober. I'm a good guy. You know, but speaking of Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


Speaking, speaking of Louis Cck, dude speaking Louis CK, we talked about Louis that when we were doing this JFK movie, I know him from around. Right. And he was considering playing Jack Ruby against his Osmond Lee Harvey. Wow. How awesome Would that have You guys know Him too, huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Nice guy. He, yeah. Also, You know, I get so nervous around him, dude. Also one of the greatest me too comedic writers that we've ever seen. That's what I'm saying it to be. The same thing that I initially like, it's the same Kind of thing. Sure, sure, sure, Sure. So, wait a second. So I called up Louis, who was starting this new thing. Right. We're going, going right to the people and called up Louie. 'cause I knew he was doing it. I said, what's the secret?


He said, there's no secret. Call up my guy. I call up the guy. The guy says, yeah, there's no secret. You go online Henry Johnson movie.com. Yep. You put up an Instagram, wherever the fuck that thing is. Right. And you, and you go out and you talk to people like you and people buy your, buy your product. That's the secrets. Yeah. That's is that You don you don't have an Instagram. Lou cracked that code. Yeah. Yeah. Louis learned very early on when he did the first iteration of his Louis show. I dunno if you ever saw it. Yeah. But it was almost mocking multicam. It was like a clever kind of spin on shitting on Multicam. And I don't think people got it right. So then when he did, yeah, lucky Louis, that's what it was. And then when he did his second iteration of it, which was Louis on fx, he kind of just stopped all the bullshit and was like, I'm just gonna give you my world my way without any fucking directional notes from a studio and a thing.


And the deal they made with him was he got to write it, direct it, produce it, and, and edit and push it out the way he wanted. Yeah. So they didn't touch it. Right. So he was really the groundbreaker for troop, to be fair. What we do too. Yeah. Like this podcast shit. It's because of those formats. Because he was like, fuck it, nobody tells us what to do. And if you did, I don't wanna work with you. So every time FX was like, you can't do this, or you could do this. He was like, I'm telling you again, either I'm gonna do it or it just doesn't happen. That's okay. So we kind of did this 'cause this was our answer to, You know, him And I going through the business and either not getting roles or auditioning a lot and getting tired and being Like, we wanna make our own. I've had enough waiting in line. Yeah. He's waited too long. I can't do it anymore.


Audition. Audition. I'm done. I'm done. He's done. You know, also, I think Rogan and Mark Marin also paved the way they did in terms of like, having this format be something that we can just be like, You know, like, fuck Hollywood. Yeah. But we wanted to be goofs. We just wanted to be goofs. We wanted to goof all the time. Yeah. Which is hard to do now. It's not easy to do. It's not, it's not easy to Do. Well, I think we, we just don't take our, it's just, this is, this was a fantasy time. I mean, we painted this to look like a fucking child's room. It's so hard to do. You can't actually talk about it without kind of destroying the magic of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know? Yeah. We don't want it. Yeah. We don't want to. Yeah. Yeah. We keep it, we keep it rolling. This has been such a blessing, You know what I mean? Yeah. For me too. Well, thank you. Oh, Thank you. Yeah. You, you, A couple years. I told you bro. Yeah. You told me I was, Well, I told him the bond that was kind of crazy for David that you may not know, was that Bobbylee went to rehab when his dad died.


And we started this show because of his, because his dad passed away. And then he got clean again. And we just wanted something to like fuck around and go make something. And we started this, and then the pandemic hit. And terrible to say, but it was the greatest fucking thing that ever happened to us. Yeah. Because then we could just be free and We got a little Oh. So no one was making anything. Like, we were like, You know, and We were in the studio every fucking week and just doing our shit. Yeah. Yeah. That's so great. And we had no rules. And no, there was Nothing. I got tired. I got tired of being dead. Yeah. I really did. Yeah. Yeah. I got sick of it, You know? Right. COVID hit, and then the fucking theater died And I got blacklisted. Nobody wanted to do my plays, and nobody wanted to do my movies over there.


And I just got fucking tired of being dead. And somebody called up and said, let's do the play. And then we did the play and he said, let's do the movie. And now I'm not dead anymore. Right. You know, we're about to do another movie. Wow. Many more movies, it sounds like. Like Yeah. What's crazy is that he has that feeling, You know what I mean? It's like a Yeah. It's, Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Which is comforting to hear. Yeah. But don't we all feel that? Well, That's the thing. You think guys like that? Don't No, I know. I think the older I get, the more I learn that everyone has that weird feeling. Yeah. Like, It's gone. It's over. Yeah. But it's not, he says that fucking weekly. Yeah. But that's almost a shtick. You know? You're not going nowhere. Thank you. Yeah. God shy. I be here every week. Yeah. No, I'm not that, I'm not that either. Did You know Picasso?


Picasso? Yeah. No, you don't. He did, he did die in the, in the fucking eighties. Right. That's What I'm saying. That he could know. Dali could, he could have known. Did you, You ever hang out with Sam Shepherd? You guys ever go, Hey, You know, man, I like your shit. Hey, let's, nothing, never in passing. Like, No, we all want each other. Dead man. Yeah. Wow. Wow. We're worse than that. Wow. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. I say, okay, the money that you're making with your shit is taking food outta my children's mouth. Yeah. I hope you die. It is sport. It's sport. It is. Well, comics used to be like that. Yeah. But then we realized because of the New York, New York comedy scene that we banded together, You know what I mean?


And we just live within our ecosystem and we help each other by doing each other's podcasts. They all grow. Yeah. Right. So we, I mean, I think 10 years ago it was dog eat dog. I mean, it was, Well, the, the difference became, we all were fighting for the same slice of pie. And the business blinded us to think that there was only one slice for us. Yeah. And then once we kind of cracked this s code, we were like, oh fuck, we can all eat and we can eat different shit. We don't have to eat the same fucking, I don't even like that kind of pie. That's, that's just like Chicago in the seventies. All these little theater companies sprang up. Right. And we each had our own flavor. And it, we each had an audience and we worked with each other. It was great. That's exactly what we are now.


That's, that's literally what we've discovered. That we were like, oh, we don't even wanna fucking eat that shit anyway, so we'll make our own. That's right. And then we found that we had our own audiences that liked it. And so the gatekeepers, as they were slowly kind of, You know, fucked off. I hate gatekeepers. They didn't have power. Well, they had, they had less and less power. 'cause we weren't singing for our supper anymore. We were like, we're gonna go cook our own fucking food. I don't, I don't wanna do it anymore. And so comedy did used to be that way. It was cutthroat. We hated each other. 'cause You know, back, back, Carson was the spot. Those guys wanted to fucking slit each other's throat for us tonight. Show doing Letterman. You know what I mean? Getting those, then getting a comedy central half hour, or maybe getting an HBO special was impossible. Yeah.


As a young person. So I think it just cracked, it recently cracked, which is what you guys are doing with the movie. Same thing. It completely, it's over. I say it's like the Erie Canal, right? Yeah. However great the Erie Canal was in 1825. You can't put enough money into to make the Erie Canal work again when the railroads come in. Right. You can't put enough money into snow fucking white. Right. To make the studio system work again. When, when the poti verse exists. Yeah. Nobody, nobody. Nobody's watching. Right. Yeah. Nobody's watching. Yeah. Yeah. What's the last great thing that you've watched that's new. Last great thing that I watched was new. I liked Casablanca. That was pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He was looking at you kid.


I mean, he just learned about it. Yesterday's, who do you think, who do you think is someone that, you don't have to answer this if you don't want to. Who's someone that you were excited to work with that let you down? And then vice versa. Who are you? Who, who, who? You, you. Like he's gotta say That name. Well, he might do. No, I don't think I, No. My first react. You're talking about actors. Anybody, Anybody in water? All, Well, all, all the producers let me know every one of them. That's right. That's right. There's a bunch Of That's what I wanna hear. Yep. Yeah. There's A Long swine trash hate 'em. But at least back in the old days of the studio system, you got betrayed by a better class of people. Right. Right. You got fucked politely. Exactly. So, okay. I'll give you the opposite version of that then.


Yeah. Who's someone that you kind of were not, were surprised by? Or, or like, or, or, yeah. You were happily surprised that you, you worked with them and you thought, I, I I respected and liked them, but you were blown away by their work. Well, I, I've worked Shy, shy sitting right there. By the way. I've worked, I've worked with the greatest actors over the last 50 years, including Shy has ever worked with a better actor. Yeah. Ever. What about Gene Hackman? Same thing. Never worked with The Better Act. Shut. Fuck up. Shut the fuck. Real dude. Fuck. Shut up. Fuck up. Yeah. What about fucking Ralph? Dude? Rest in peace. You fucking bastard. He Shit. Shut up, dude. How come you never mentioned the Asian lady either? His wife. Yeah. He didn't talk about her. It Jean, what about, Wait a second Chang Tank. He went on a big ranch. What's her name? He went on a big run. He goes, so Jean.


And so I never worked with a better actor than Jean. No. Oh yeah. So Gene introduced, the first time I met him, he introduces me to his wife. Betsy was a concert violinist, an Asian woman. And he says, this is my wife, Betsy. I met her in a massage parlor. How will Laughed so hard? Well, that's why she killed him recently. Yeah. Yeah. That was, that, that joke lasted long enough. Like, how did you give Al Pacino notes? Did you give him notes? I Never give anybody notes. All right. I never give you a note. No, not notes. No, No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here's the thing. You work with a great actor. If You know what you're doing, what you get an opening night in the theater is the cast in the script. That's it. Mm. Alright. The, the, the direction the staging through.


Nobody fucking cares. So when you work with actors who know what they're doing, you say, okay. Like we, how do we rehearse the movie? Except for Blanca? We, I've never rehearsed a movie. Wow. Right. You, you work and say, You know what you're doing? You got any questions? Go, let's play the stupid fucking scene. Right. That, that's all right. That's all that there is. It's amazing. Did you have a big fight with Pacino? A big No. No. I had a big fight with De Niro though. What happened? What Happened? Well, it was just over the phone. He, he was doing the Untouchables, right? Yeah. And I wrote The Untouchables, and he calls me up, he says, I got some questions about the script he's shooting. I said, well, hold on. Aren't you supposed to ask the director about the question?


And the director? No, no. The director, Brian De Palmas had talked to you. She talked to you. I said, you have questions about the script? I said, yeah. I said, did they, did you read the script before you took the part? He says, yeah. I said, why the script got worse? 'cause they're paying you 2 million bucks for a week's work slam. So we didn't, we didn't talk for years and years and years. And then I ran into him. So he was very, I did like, he did like four or five movies that I wrote De Niro. And he, and he said, You know, blah, blah, blah. He said, You know what? I called you one. You called me when I have the greatest respect for you. I said, bobbylee, I have the greatest respect for you. So we go to have, do a mu a reading of some film.


I think it was The Edge that was originally, eventually played with Sean Connery. No, No. Baldwin, Alec Baldwin. It was Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins. Hopkins, Yeah. And Alec Baldwin. Yeah. So one of the great secrets about when the anybody asked who were reading, reading is they're never gonna do the movie. Right. Never. Right. Because they use the reading unconsciously as a way to get out of doing the movie. And so the movie star, the main guy's gonna mumble and everyone's come audition at the reading. So it's garbage. So, yeah. Yeah. So anyway, we do the reading. And I talked to Bob afterward. I said, what do you think? He said, it's good. It's really good.


But it's just not for me at this moment. It's just not, it. It's, I I only have so many of them, and it's gotta be it for me. It it's gotta be, it's gotta be great for me. Yeah. It's gotta be great. He said, do you, do you, is that okay? I said, of course. He said, you, you, you, you, are you mad at me? I said, of course not. He said, are you sure you're not mad at me? I said, no. He says, good, because I got this piece of shit I'm supposed to shoot on Monday. I wonder if you could take a look at it. But Wag the dog that came in for the table. Reed Wag the dog. Yeah. But I wasn't there. You didn't come in for the table? Fuck no. So it was just Hoffman and De Niro, whoever It was. But we did wag the dog.


Barry Levinson called me up. He said, I got this idea. It's in the book. The president gets in trouble. He is gotta go to war. I said, oh, oh, I got it. He's getting in trouble. 'cause they caught him in the closet, fucking a girl scout. He says, yeah, go write it. So I go write it. And two months later they were shooting it. Wow. Wow. Two months. Yeah. Fuck. Wow. That'll never happen again. That kind of shit. No, It was great. Do you like the new, I mean the, You know, the bill of bur, I mean the Glen Glen. I mean, have you seen it yet with Yeah, I Think they're great. Oh, Okay. Good. The reason that shit will never happen again is 'cause those conversations aren't happening like that anymore. Correct. Yeah. They're gone. You never have Levinson call a guy up and be like, Hey, like two craftspeople will be able to have that conversation unadulterated without any of the keepers. You know, the minders, and, God, you're A Bright Kid.


Alright, stop it. Oh my God. I, You know, when I, even since I've met you back in the day, you're A Bright Kid. Hey, Thanks. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. He's A grown man. No, but he's bright as Yeah, but you always know me as a kid. I met him as a kid. Yeah. I met him on a razor scooter. He Was right in Bumble Bay. You don't dare refer to me as that. No. You're not as bright as Shya. There's no way. I think also Because you'll physically, you'll harm him. I do wanna harm him. Yeah, I know that. All the fucking Time. Yeah. Yeah. But it's hug, love, it's love. It's, it's, I love him so Deeply. No, you, you have rage. Love. It's rage. There's rage. Okay. Be honest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. David doesn't know us well enough to know. Yeah. How much do I love you, David? Have you ever been to Fistfight? Yes, he has. For sure. Yeah, for sure. I was, I've been very involved. Yeah. He's like a black belt dude. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I am A black.


Yeah. He's a juujitsu black belt. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. But I actually got, yeah, when I was a kid, I got, got in fights, but the only fight I actually got into, You know, outside of the mat and in, in boxing, like shit. As I was walking down Fifth Avenue, these guys were playing three card Monte. And so, as my great friend, Ricky Jay, the great magician, said, three card Monte's. Not a game of skill. It's not a game of chance. It's not a game. So the guy says, okay, put your money down, blah, blah, blah, blah. Bob, the, the, the red, you gotta have the black. You get back 20 gets you 40, 40 gets you 80, 80 gets you little, little 80. Where's the, where's the red card? Where's the red card? He does this thing.


Right? And, and so he says, oops, we'll take, that's not the red card that's gone. Where's the red card? So I know where the red card is. It's where you're not supposed to look. So I take it And I go over there And I turn the card over, which you're not supposed to do, because they never let you win. Right. In three card Monte. Because if you say, I want that card. Oh, he, he upsets it. And you have to start again. So I turned the card over and the guy punched me in the fucking face. So, Really? Yeah. Did it hurt? It's on Fifth Avenue. Oh, sure. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was Fifth Avenue in the right near right near Rockefeller Center. You swung back? No, I just, I was in, they disappeared. Ah. Right, right. Took your money and ran. Wow. Yeah. Did You know Awa?


I didn't know. I saw him once. He was at the, the, the premier of r at you were At the premier R Yes. In New York. Oh my God. And he was there. He's a beautiful man. His big maze, like six four, I think. And he was there. He Was that big. Yeah, he was big man. Yeah. He had Blackfeet too. Something right. Happened where he was in the snow or something. And No, he Frostbite Frostbit feet. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Probably got it on Dear Ula Y. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did you, what's, what's your favorite al film? I'm a huge fan. I know. I bring it up a lot. Go fuck yourselves. All right. He does love cur, I think obsessed. Think here. I, I, I, let me, let me say four of them. Right. Dear Sir. Ula Certainly. Yes. Stray Dog, because it's got Takashi Shimo, the greatest actor who ever lived.


Yeah. Akashi Shimo. And then Seven Samurai. Yes. Which is perfect. But then, God forgive me, I think he screwed up the end of Hamman. 'cause he had an extra scene after the movies. Oh, I really, yeah. These guys trying to hit each, a lot of them were guys wearing like diapers, trying to hit each other with sticks or swords. Oh, right, right, right, right, right. Yeah. You see high and low. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Not only did I see high and low, I rewrote it, but that I was, who was it? See, Scorsese came to me and says, you, You know, high and low. I said, yeah. He says, you want to re redo it? I say, yeah. He said, what do you think of the movie? I said, it's a great movie.


But they missed the ending. They, they, it has the wrong ending. So I figured up the ending And I wrote it to Scorsese, and Scorsese wrote it back with a bunch of scribbled notes. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Wow. And then a bunch of stuff happened. I think Spike Lee did another version now. Yeah. I don I don't think it has anything to do with my script. Hey, Andreas. Wow. Yes, director. This, this is a director. I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Andreas behold your eyes. Right? I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you bow to him on the way in? Yeah.
