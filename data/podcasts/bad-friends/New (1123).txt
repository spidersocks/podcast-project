Like complex living next to each other and they reenact, you know what I mean? How their, their spouses got together.


So they would go through the dialogue and scenarios and stuff right there. And then through the process, they fall in love, but at the end they don't link up. And it's like, it's so sweet. It's like I have fantasies of like your pink butthole. Yeah. Right? Yeah. And my penis. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And you're, it's vibrating. WW yeah. Like shivering and mine shivering. Right.

You see, you always see the backside of their back. Right. Or their voice. You never see them because it makes the audience not have any sympathy for them. Right, right, right. And so you are only focused on these two. And then like six years later, there's one scene where this dude goes, what's what? you laughing? Because That's gotta be something funny coming up. Oh, this is all boring.
