Well, it would be kind of tight if he did have a Superman shirt underneath the suit, that would've been the crest, right? That'd been the move. So, who wait, they're make, so his kids are making a Zocdoc about him right now. Yeah. And when does this come out? It's soon. Look at the hand. Okay. Anyway. Well, what's The, was he ever un paralyzed? No. What Do you mean not so super? Huh? Like he, did he ever, did it ever get better? No, it got worse and worse. I don't so sadly get, Sadly. No, it's, it was a Awful, It's awful. Awful. Spinal cord injuries And it was it from a horse. Yeah. I don't know why you asked that Half. Sure. Well, no, I, I I don't remember it. A horsey did it.


Now did the horse, No, I don't think they call it a horsey. No. The thing not, you've ruined someone's ability to walk. Yeah. You Think the horsey got in trouble? I Think that horse is glue now. Sadly, that horse is gone. It lives with Whitney coming. Darks. Whitney. Whitney has it. Whitney's got it. Whitney Would show it to you. She'd go, this is Christopher Reeve sports. She'd go, this is the horse that killed Christopher Reeve. And they were gonna kill it. But I decided it should come here and watch me do makeup tutorials on Instagram live. Yeah. Because She has knickknacks That's right. On the shelves and stuff. He has it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. She would have, she would have the thing that killed an Amer that hurt an American hero. Yeah. That would be, she would take pride in it. Yeah.


Like it, you know, like the body of bubbles, like Michael Jackson's said. Right. Monkey? She definitely has bobbylee stuff. His monkey in a room. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was, this was Bubbles pacifier. Do you know that? Born in 1983, the, this was such a polarizing thing when he would walk around with this monkey. He's From Austin Bubbles. Yeah. Wow. Oh wow. You can see him at the mothership this weekend on Kill Tony Bubbles will be there. How long did Bubbles live? Give It up for the great bubbles. Huh? He's alive. Still Alive. Yeah. You better believe it. He's Chilling up. No, his bobbylee is literally still alive. Yeah. He He's 40 years old. 50. Wow. No, 40. It says 1983, he was born. He's at the Center for Great Apes.


That was the craziest Google Bubbles now. Yeah. I knew Google would happened. Yeah. Despite the fact that he is very photogenic, bobbylee is difficult to photograph. 'cause he does not like the camera. Mm. Often will turn his back when he sees the camera. Well, bubbles, nose the camera's the one that causes all the problems. That's exactly right. That's where the pain begins. Bubbles nose. Yeah. I mean, bubbles could have gone Chimp Crazy. Like the fact documentary. You watched it. Do you see it? Chimp Crazy? I haven't seen it yet. Fantastic. It's fantastic. Yeah. It's about a chimp oos. It It's about a, it's about a, it's about a group of people who are in the chimp industry. Chimp industry. Yeah. And it focuses what you would think was supposed to be on an original lady. But it ends up being about this woman right here.


This lady here, and her involvement in the, the chimp chimp trade. What is the chimp industry? Oh, dude. What do you mean what you, what you, what do you thinking? Is Tim People, exotic animals? People? Yes. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. In the state of Missouri, there is no exotic animal band law. So in Missouri, you can buy, sell, and trade exotic animals that are on the exo on the band list in most places. But, But did you notice in the documentary, she's, she has the little ones too. She's got 'em all right. Spider monkey, monkey. But Still, they're deep. Like the co co coveted thing is chimp. Right. They can have 50 of the little guys. Right. But they're like dreaming of chimp. Right. Chimp the biggest one. You can have no, No gorilla. You can get a gorilla.


No, you can't. But I'm seeing, I'm sure that's the biggest one. That's the Hope. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think they can, I seriously, I think they can have any, you can, you Can have a gorilla. There's no, we can have a gorilla At what's the largest exotic animal you can purchase in America. On the documentary, they talk, they show you one of these like, exotic animal auctions. People buy the wildest fucking shit. They, you know, like, have you ever seen those like Chex that have like, Of course, white tigers. White tigers in their Yeah. And their fucking kitchen. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. They was in a house in Beverly Hills, supposedly. There was a guy who had a couple tigers in the backyard, some Incredible, Pretty fucking cool. But in the Zocdoc. Yeah. It's Pretty Thick. In the documentary though, they show past incidences, like famous incidences with chimpanzees.


And you notice when the chi, because they, they never leave the house. And they're in a cage. They're Supposed to. Right. They're Supposed to be around the chimp. And then one of 'em, right. For like a year would just be sitting there like Rocking. Right. Walking Back and forth. Right. What do you do at that point? You gotta shoot it. No, No, no, no. Gotta shoot it. No You don't. I'm a chimp. It's gonna kill you. Am I doing a good job? Yeah. That looks like You. Oh, why, why? Why would you have a chimp and just have it sit in the cage and do that? It's kind of disturbing. Well, psychologically what they kind of, what they break down in this is, that's Not even impressive. No. If I went to your house and I saw like an animal like doing this. Yeah, yeah. I'm not, yeah.


I'm like, that's not really cool. That cold. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotta get my Uber. You Have a fentanyl monkey. Right? They talk about in the thing, they talk about the psychology of these, these women who fall in love. They, they think that they value them more than their own children because she says it in there. She goes, A baby only needs you for so long. The chimp. That's what it is. The chimp needs you for life. It's, it's, it's, that's a good, it's a baby. That's a baby. Forever. Forever. They ne they, they, they, they have the needs of a baby. That's what it's, and they never, even when they're 40, they don't grow out of those, those like instinct needs of you. But you don't, you don't. If they don't get to play with other monkeys, Yeah at some point, that's It. Yeah. That's it. That's it. So these are women who wanna have a baby forever.


So they get a chimp And they, they have babies of their own. But after like three or four years, they're like, eh, Well the kids even say there's kids interviewed in the documentary. They're like, she doesn't fucking love us. Us. Oh, there's, but there's no way any of these women are good mothers. Oh, no, No, no, no, no, no. There's No way. Like, their kids are like, she was an amazing mom and also had this chimp, there's no way there's something broken. Something Broken. Yeah. Something broke, something broken. Yeah. They talk about the kids. They interview some of the kids and you know, they have to, unfortunately on camera, passively go. No. Yeah. No. She, she, she, she did a good job raising us. She just loves, she loves her chimps. Yeah. Right. Really. I mean, you can see the sadness in the through line. It's right. It's the documentary's. Fantastic. Does the, does do, does any of the chimps act out violently?


Oh Yeah. Okay. I I mean, they show you Some footage on there. It's wild. There's one that I had to pause and walk away and go, that's, I can't do this. Well, You'll remember when we were kids. Yeah. Famously, one of the women went on Oprah. 'cause her face, This is what happens. Her Face was taken, removed. She went on, look at the picture of the chimp attack woman. Oprah. Yeah. That's the light. Is that Her? Yeah. Yeah. She went on Oprah and she had to wear a veil. Tim, you would love this for your new show. I gotta be honest, not only would I love her for the show, but I don't think she looks that bad. No, she doesn't. It's not bad. She actually doesn't look that bad. I, by the way, there are people in LA walking around that look exactly like that. It's Beverly and Beverly. Listen, I've lived here long enough where that doesn't shock me at all.


An old gypsy woman with one eye. That shocks no one. That shocks no one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen that too, I guess. Yeah. Look At the, look at, look at her. Up on a Chimp Woman on Oprah. She had to wear a veil. And then Oprah. The, that the funniest clip. They use it in the movie. Oprah goes, can we, can we lift up the veil? Oh Yeah. Yeah. Can we lift it the Veil? That's bad. That's Pretty bad. That's a rough one. Yeah. Yeah. It's tough. Well, Now wait a minute. Is that Oprah? Which one? Who's that? That Original. That's Oprah. Tim. What the fuck? That's Oprah. I don't mean, is that bad? It's before the money Oprah, By the way, that's almost no thought being put into that veil. All she should think about is the veil. I know. It makes it more ominous almost. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's scary it a Bat. This looks like the Batman villain.


Well, This is a perfect, like this is an Islam. Like go with that. Go with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's time to start thinking about it. Yeah. You think just wear a I convert. Oh, for sure. Just convert To Muslim. Convert you convert immediately. Yeah. That's actually smart. The documentary though, it does something. It's so powerful the way it tells this, this story, because I'm not giving anything away. But the guy who's making it Can't, there, there it is. The guy who's making it can't really make it. They have to let go incognito while they're making it. Why? It's brilliant. Because he's No, he's a known figure. Because He did, he directed Tiger King. Tiger King. Oh, Right. So there, and then when he asked the lady, can I do it? And they're like, I don't wanna work with you. Nobody in the chimp community likes this guy. 'cause he's exposed the exotic animal community. So they hired, he'd hired an actor to act as the director.


It's fascinating. It's fascinating. It's Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. They did such a great job. It's a great job. Yeah. I wanna see characters like this on your show. And that's a perfect transition because I do want to talk about it. Tim's got a new show on Netflix. Yeah. We're excited about it. We're, we're trying to get people like this who don't have faces. And what is it I want? Well, This Is Your Country. Oh, This is the talk show. Yeah, It's a talk show, which amazing. We're trying to bring back like a, a Jerry Springer type I concept. You know, this was my senior ditch day in high school. We went to Jerry Springer. That's Awesome. Was it in Connecticut? No, In Chicago. Okay. He came outta Chicago. He was outta Chicago. That's awesome. Yeah. We, we did a senior ditch day and went down there and it w it, dude, I love Jerry Springer so much in high school. 'cause it was, it was a perfect world of comedy. It was pure comedy. Yeah. And it's comedy on purpose where like, yeah.


People are taking it serious. But you're like, do you not understand that This is No, I think it's funny. It's like, it's also ends up, those shows end up being weirdly a better satire of America than the Daily show. A hundred percent. Because like, this is what we got. These are the voters. These are the people. This is Who's out there. These are All real people. Right. These are no scripts. They're not actors. They came on, we did like 20, 25 minutes with each group. We edited it down because like, you gotta get, you know, like, 'cause a lot of people that aren't accustomed to being on TV Right. Will just drone on for hours about something. So you gotta edit it down to like, but it's amazing. I mean, Can we show the trailer? Absolutely. Before you do, Can I ask you a favor? Sure. Can I ple you know how in, what's his name?


The, the, the Just breathe. That's okay. I'm very emotional about It. Yeah. What's going on? Yeah. I just wanna be like a, a handler. Come be a handler. Like, I bring guests on stage. I don't say much. Yes. You Know, you're like, you like Steve, Steve, Steve Wilcos. Yeah. Steve Wilcos. That's what I wanna Be. He he was security. Yeah. But I'll be security. Making him security is so fucking funny. We want security that like, the idea would be security that runs away. Like, I just want cowards. I want cowards. Good Dude. I gotta be your main. Yeah. We want cowards. We want people riding away. Excuse me. You never, the nothing is better than if a melee brawl starts and me and you run away out of the state. It would be the greatest comment, please. Ever. This runaway. Please. You don't even have to pay me. Yeah. Let me. Do it, please. Oh, Absolutely.


Okay, cool. Thank you. All right. Let's see it. I do wanna watch it again. It's fantastic. You are here to confess to your girlfriend that you used to do porn. Yeah. The music. Hello pigs. I think we can all look a rotting corpse of an empire. And we live in hell. Your Husband brought you here today because he wants to confess something. Wait a minute. Wait minute. Hold on. Let's talk to the food. Poison, drug addicted sex criminals who live here. You could play Minecraft, Fortnite. I've Never met a more Hannibal person. How do you think she's gonna react when you tell her What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. No. Are you insane?


We pop it up. We pop. We pop it up. Kidding. Three years. I gotta deal With you. Since I was a child. I don't know any life. That's not like this. Oh this. Oh, shut the Fuck. This is what America's About. The Unibomber wants to say. Bring out the BBL. My name is Tim Dylan and regrettably, This Is. Your Country. Wow. Brilliant. Wow. Brilliant. We had some homeless people I think in the audience.


'cause we shot it in Van Nuys and we just, people like came outta tents and got central Casting. Right. It's great. Yeah. That's so fun. You, you've done one episode. We've Done one. We're putting it out and we're super excited. I I, we didn't know what was gonna, it was a weird thing 'cause they wanted us to do something like political and I was like, it's boring. Mm. It's just boring. Going to political convention. Nobody's gonna ever do it better than Triumph. Right. Nobody's gonna ever do the Daily show better than John Stewart. Yep. Mm. No one's gonna like everybody, you know. So I said, maybe we'll bring back something people haven't seen in a while and it'll just be silly. And like our dream, we have dream ones that we couldn't get, but like our dream segments are. Like my husband said he was at January 6th, but he was just cheating on me.


Yeah. Yeah. My Sugar Daddy's gonna cut off my ozempic and I'm scared of what I'll eat. Yeah. Things like that. Like we have dream ones where like we wanna put things out into the universe and get these people. Yeah. Yeah. But are, I didn't see any violence. There's no real violence because the people there, there is arguments and there is anger. Yeah. Yeah. But violence is harder to get to. And a lot of the Jerry violence, I think some of it was staged. It Was a lot of it was staged. And none of this is staged. So the, the reality is, it's like, our hope is that if we get more episodes, there is violence naturally. We hope for Violence. There needs to be violence. The hope is that we we're gonna get violence. But we're, we have, we're now, we learned a lot doing it.


We, we made some mistakes and then corrected them so that, you know, we had two shoots. We figured it all out and then like, we're gonna try to get, you know, if we keep doing it, like we'd love to get some people that really are gonna attack each other a hundred percent while me and you run outta this. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Jerry Springer did turn into this fake fight show. Yeah. Which I think was kind of part, partially the demise of the show. 'cause it organically was so wild. The Fraternity. It's gotta be organic. Yeah. Somebody's gotta really wanna fight. Yeah. I Don't want Somebody's gotta wanna fight. But there are like, we have a guy confessing. He lost a lot of money to his wife with crypto. We have people like, you know, we have all kinds of stuff going on. That's interesting. Guy saying, I used to be a porn star. Yeah. With chick. Like, and this are all, these are all real things, but like, nobody slapped anybody else.


But, you know, knock on wood, that could happen. Yeah. I really hope it does. That's the Hope. My name is Yahi. Toto for this. Yeah. Yeah. He's still working on the character. I'm working on the character. Dude, I'm gonna look. No, It's me and you run outta the studio during a large fight. And then there's a kind of a older female security guard who is tasked with handling everything. Do you have this woman cast? No, but it would be hilarious. Like a female, like an older female security guard trying to get a, a handle on everything. Me, Andr Bobby. Sprint outta this sprint. Sprint Out. Yeah. Yeah. Just run out. Yeah. Yeah. Let her deal with it. Yeah. Yeah. That's not your problem. I hope this is A hit. I hope it is too. When's it Come out? October 1st. October 1st. October 1st. We Hope it's, this'll be out on Netflix. You gotta go watch It. Yeah. We hope it, it should be fun.


There's no chance it won't, it won't be successful. I told you. Yeah. It's fantastic. Well, I'm glad we did this and not, 'cause they were like, go to the convention and talk to people. And I go, why? Why? Yeah. Ah, there's 20 people doing that. Yeah. And then they were really cool. Netflix was awesome. We said we'd like to do this. And they said, okay, cool. And left us alone. Wow. 'cause If, you go to the convention and do the chat things. That's already on YouTube. There's like a dozen of those videos right now. Now Everybody's doing that. You'll never beat YouTube. It's fast. It's Already out and it's already out. And it's gonna, what's the point? Yeah. There's nothing to be learned anymore about people's, like opinions about politics. The only thing that's left to be learned is like, how are people living? What are people doing?


That's the more interesting element than like why you like Trump or why you like Kamala. It's like what do you, how do you earn money? How does your family dynamic work? Like what do you, who do you hate? And why Would you take this to another state and move it? I mean, shoot it in different places. I would Shoot it wherever. Absolutely. I Think it'd be interesting to like shoot, shoot episodes in different spots. I know that's more expensive, I think. No, no, I agree with You. Because then you really get a gist of like the, the, you know, shoot it Nevada. Then you're in Washington. We flew these people in. Oh, You did? Yeah, from all over. From All over. Oh, okay. Right on. Because, You know, but we would, I, you know, it depends on where they'd wanna shoot it, but I would shoot it wherever. Let's take it. These people that got flown in, what's the, what's, what was the general spot that a lot of 'em came from?


We talking Florida. I'm trying to think. There was Colorado. Mm, there was Florida. Gotta be Florida. How do you submit to be on the show? Well, we do was a casting call. We're like, do you, are you this person? And do you, do you wanna reveal a thing? Do you wanna do whatever? People do it. People are like, why would anyone go on that? I go, anyone will do anything. Yeah. People wanna do anything. I love all this idea. People are like, why would anyone go on a show like that? You go, anyone will do anything. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Yeah. Yeah. There's no value to dignity anymore in this country. There's no economic value to it and there's no emotional value. Like, you don't even sound good anymore. If, you tell someone you passed up on something and you go, I'm not gonna go make a fool outta myself. No matter what it is, people go, man, I Dunno.


No matter what, it's, yeah. It used to be like 20 years ago, you'd tell a guy at a bar, they want me to go make my family into a laughing stock, and I'm not doing that. And the guy would go, good for you. Now the same guy goes, I don't know, I would've maybe done that. There's not much left, there's no meat on the bone factory. So it's like, maybe something would've walked out. May it work out. Right. You know. What did you think you learned over the course of the show? What's the collective thought after seeing all these people to all this shit? What's like the one thing you took away from it? Genuinely? Yeah. No, genuinely. I, I, what I took away was, number one, how hard it is to do these types of shows. Yeah. Because it's, it's, you don't have a script. You don't, you can't just re-edit, like go back and say, let's do it again.


Like, that's not the way it works. Right. If somebody's gonna say something to someone else, they say it one time. Mm. You're doing it in front of a live audience. Right. So I had to learn how to be a talk show host. And because my podcast, I do it by myself, I just talk. Right. So for me, it was like listening to people and then, and I would lose track of time. So in your PC in, and they'd be like, all right, you've done 10 minutes with them. Like, you know, like, and I'd go, oh, okay. Bring out the gas. 'cause there's always somebody we're bringing out. Right. And a lot of the times the people in the chairs don't know. So I'm like, you know, somebody's been listening backstage and then we bring somebody else out. So it's like, it was learning how to do all of that and then meet like, re appreciating Springer, Jenny Jones.


Ricky Lake, yeah. Donahue, Maury. Mm. All those people who did shit like that, Sally Jesse appreciating it and going, oh, that was not, it was not as easy as it looked. Right. It's not, I mean, you have, you have to be a host and you have to be kind of, this, you, you're almost like a a a, you're almost manipulating them as you're telling the story with them. And those shows did it every single day. Yeah. All year. Yeah. We had one shot. We had two live shows Saturday and Sunday, and we edited them. You know, we shot 11 of these segments. We kept five. Yeah. So it took a minute, but as we get better at it, we would be able to sh like we would know. Now I know more about like, okay, I understand why that segment was, some people say they have a problem with each other and then get on stage.


They really don't. Of course. They really don't. We would find that out when we did Bad Friends Live stuff. Yeah. We'd find out. Yeah. People would bail on a thing that we thought they were really committed to. Yeah. We had a woman who's a Q Anon mom, and the older producers were like, she's a nut. Wait till you hear what she says. She's crazy. And then I brought her on stage and go, what's your craziest opinion? She goes, I like Trump. I go, alright, come on. And any, anything else? Wow. I'm like, are there tunnels underground? Like, gimme something. It just like, I'm, I'm pro Second Amendment. I like Trump. And the LA producers were so crazy that they thought that was like the most conflict. No. Yeah. Right. You know what I mean? They're like, wait till you hear what she says. And she's like, I just think Biden's too old. And they're like, see, See What a fucking nut job.


Yeah. And I'm like, oh no, this isn't. But we did find some, some people that were re it was really good. And there was some magic on it that happened where you're just in awe of it. Some shit went down where you, you do just stand back and go, what the fuck Yeah. Is happening. I love it. And it's kind of wild. Well, the Reason why this has legs is because there's two other comics that I can think of that had this a, a daytime show. Do you know who they are? Well, I don't Remember. No prob. I mean, probably Kirk Foxx. Oh yeah, Kirk did. He did a thing. Hey, Greg Barrett. Greg Barrett. But the problem with those shows is that they tried to be molded into a talk like it, they're playing a role. So they But you, you're yourself here. That's right. Yeah. That's Why this is, I think, Well, he's in on the joke. Yeah. That's what it is.


Yeah. These guys were trying to like, wow. You know, well, tell us, you know, they were just playing like some role Host. We were, but we were basically like Netflix. We were talking to them and we go, we want to satirize like America. Mm. And then the idea was like, well, let's talk to political figures and everything. And I'm like, but this is not America. No. Mm. So the Republican and Democrat conventions are not America. And I thought about it, and I was like, and me and the, my collaborator, Brian Frange, really smart, good writer.

So, by the way, and I, let's make some news 'cause I'll talk right about it and Yeah, yeah, Yeah. So Tim was in Joker too. Do you guys know that? I'll speak about it right now. And he plays A security, like a, A lot of people. Okay. A lot of people are shitting on it in the press. Why, why they're panning on it. I don't know why, but I'll tell you right now. I I was, I I had suggestions. They were not followed by the director. Oh, okay. Okay. By Joaquin. Yeah. Yeah. By Gaga. So the reality was I was a security guard. I had two or three lines. Yep. I felt underutilized. Yeah. I said, I will direct it.


I said, I will direct it. Yeah. Or I will assistant direct it. I don't know who that guy was. Yeah. Yeah. He did something with Affleck. I don't care. Yeah. I would've done any of, I would've done, I would've done cinematography, which I didn't, I wasn't hugely clear on what exactly it entailed, but I knew that, like, I had a lot more to give that movie than it's the three lines that it accepted from me. Right. Sure. Now, if it's a stunning success, I'm proud to be a part of it. Yeah. But if it does fail, it is because they didn't utilize me in a proper way. But if it's a success, I am proud to be a part of it. But what was It like If it fails? Yeah. What was it like? Because I know your scene has, Joaquin was in the scene. Right? He was in the scene. Right. So what was that like?


I Didn't, I didn't learn the lines. Yeah. Yeah. Because they always lie. The agent lies and they go, they want you to be you and be funny. And they lie. Right. They never, they don't want that. Andrew's a great actor and he does like the work of it. Yeah. I showed up and I'm like, I'm going, I'm okay too. You know Both of you. Both of you. But I, he was the one, I, he's white, but what I was saying, thank you, I showed up and I was like, you know, I didn't, you didn't get the script ahead of time because they were, they didn't want you to leak it. Oh, I hate when they do that. Yeah. So they give you lines in the morning and I like read them real quick and I guess I should have drill them a little more, but they kept changing them. And, you know, I was a bit nervous. And it's Wiv never done a scene in any movie in my life before.


This is the first scene in any movie I've ever done in my whole entire life. That's with Joaquin Phoenix with Joaquin Phoenix. Yeah. And Brendan Gleason, who's holy. Another shit. Holy wow. Genius. Loved him. Genius. Okay. Yeah. So I'm like scared. Yeah. Truly, truly terrified. Yeah. Like, I'm not even kidding. Like, I'm nervous in my trailer. I called my agent and go, I don't even think I should be in this. Yeah. She goes, no, no, no, no. I love this. It's all fine. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 'cause I'm outta my element. This is not what I do. Yeah. And, but I'm, I listen, I like acting. I like challenges and whatever, but it's a tough one to start with. Oh, there's a lot of blocking in the scene. There's a book that I have to move across the table. There's lines, but like, as I'm doing the lines, like the, the, you know, I have to look like the director would come up to me and he goes, listen, here's a scene.


You say your first line after you say your first line, you move your book. The book, you put your hands on the book. Yeah. Don't block the title of the book. Yeah. Don't block the cover. Yeah. Move it 70% across the desk. 80%. It's outta frame. Do you get that? Yeah. Yeah. And I go, yes. And he'd go, then you're gonna look, and Brendan, you're gonna look at Brendan, but you're gonna wait for him to say his line. Yeah. After that, Joaquin's gonna pick up the phone. At that point, you wait one beat, you say half of your line. Okay. Joaquin's gonna look at you. He gives you a look. He acknowledges that you're there. Yeah. And then you finish your second line. Yeah. Okay. I don't know what, and he would say this to me, he'd go, what the fuck is the problem here? 'cause he was being very like, and I get it.


I respect him. He's a great director. Yeah. I like being yelled at and was deserved. Yeah. And, but Joaquin was like, he's doing fine. Like, Joaquin would turn around and the director and go, he's, he's, he's okay. And I'm like, man, I'm doing fine. Yeah. But they would yell. So then there was like 80 people around. You were on the universal lot, all the cameras. Okay. And then they would go action. And I would go, I mean, I would fuck it up every which way. Yeah. One time, one time I was so nervous I didn't even say the line. Yeah. I just moved the book. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just moved the book and looked away and the director starts going, why the fuck are you looking away? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. He goes, just say the goddamn line. Does that make you even more nervous?


Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. I can't imagine this was one of the worst experiences of my entire life. Yeah. Except it was good at the end, I guess. I don't know. Did you sing? What did you sing? No, it's a, it's a musical. I should have sung. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I couldn't even speak. So then he would come up to me Sing. He can't get through a fucking line in the book shift. Yeah. Yeah. So he'd go like this, but it was hard. I'm telling you. I Know, I'm, I know it was, but just his questioning is, no, It just made me so, but I get it. I apologize. Should I apologize on it? No. But I should have sang. Yeah. Yeah. But the point is, I was there and then I would do it again. And then he would come up to me and go, okay. He'd go, he goes, listen. He goes, the line is actually this. And I said, and I'm not saying that. He goes, no, you've never said that.


Never said the line. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you've actually never said this line. Yeah. And I said, he goes, so he goes, just forget it. He goes, just say, he goes this, just say close enough to it, you know? Yeah. And then eventually I got it and I did it, but it was very hard. It's like, hard to do. And I felt bad because again, I, I'm not an expert and I felt bad. It's your first one. What are the chances? The scene does not make it, I didn't think it was gonna be in it. Okay. But Is it, do you know it's in it? Yeah. That's great. That's Great. Do we see a photo of you on the internet at all? Or? I don't think, I think maybe there's one little photo. Oh, really? Yeah. I haven't seen the scene. Because it's not a pivotal scene, I don't think. Yeah.


Where is it? Yeah, that's, yeah. With security guards. Yeah. Yeah. It's with security guards. But I didn't, I didn't know if they were gonna put it in, but they put it in 'cause Todd said he got it at the end. He said it was good at the end. Zoom in. Is that him? I don't know where I am. Where am I? There's Timmy D There's Timmy. Yeah. There's Timmy and Tim. D and maybe, and you know what? It looked, I look like I'm doing acting there. Yeah. Yeah. That looks so, I actually look like I'm doing, if I saw That photo, I was like, oh, that guy's a good actor. No. And you know what? Maybe literally maybe I shouldn't have said anything because maybe my scene is great. I bet you it is. I Bet It is. Here's the problem. It's shot so beautifully. We internalize it. 'cause the things that we're feeling and thinking.


Right. No one else feels are things. That's right. But because it happens to us Right. It becomes a big thing. I think I, yeah. Just 'cause I wasn't saying the line or doing the blocking doesn't mean I was doing a bad job. Exactly. No, I was, yeah. I mean, that's Feeling, yeah. Yeah. Because I was feeling it out. And that's what actors do. Yeah. I'm like becoming the, you know, thing. How was this guy in the middle? That's kind of Ricky dva looking. Was he good? Yeah, He was really, they're all really, here's the thing. I Mean, Gleason's phenomenal. They're all really good. All these actors in this film were excellent. And it's hard to be an actor. 'cause I was talking to them and like, they, they just got outta covid and they hadn't booked anything. And a lot of them were like, this is their big thing.


One guy went out and got covid and they had to get rid of him. Wow. Jesus. And this was like his thing. It was his time. I, I, I have a story that's kind of like this. Forget it. Forget it. I said forget. Forget it. I'm interested. Nah, I Forget, forget, forget. I'm not even gonna do it Now. What is it? What's the fucking look for? That was rude. I was waiting for you to tell your story. No, you're like, how dare you interrupt this ma magical thing we got going on. Well, No, I mean, he has given us some really great Juicy shit. But let but no, let's hear The thing. No, I don't wanna know. Because it's not even, not that you have to, it's not even that good. Now let's go back to the No, we're Not gonna carry on.

Well, 'cause that's what I'm, Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, in, you know, that's all. Well, come on, tell your story for real. Well cut it out then, because I don't think it's gonna hit Now What? Tell it, it will Hit If you. If this, can we do the segue again then? Yes. Let's do it again. Let's do the segue. what you, do you remember what you were talking about anyway? Yeah. So this and that. Yeah. Did are You ever have any experience? No, I'm doing it. Alright. I Get to do it. I didn't know. Yeah. I I'm very good at Segs. I know you're very good. Oh, wow. So, yeah. Gleason. Wow. Well, I have, have a story kind of like This. What is that? What Happened? That was so good.


Yeah. Thanks. And I wish that happened before. No on it. Don't you wish it, Have you ever had an experience that's similar to mine? It's Over. Kim. What is the experience? What happened? Well, I was in the movie The Dictator. Yeah. We remember great film. Okay. Beautiful playing Kim Jong-Un No, I wasn't playing Kim Jong-Un Dude. No, no, no, no, no. I'm serious. That's what, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Already now. Yeah. This is what's gonna happen. That's not Kim Jong-Un Yeah. That's Not Kim Jong-Un That's Me, dude. Right. So I have this Right. So I have a couple of scenes in this movie. Okay. And I have, you know, my, that's my wife in the movie. Yeah. Dude, I'm handsome. You look really good though, dude. I Look so good. You Really do. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah.


So there's a scene where I'm walking out of a bathroom with Ed Norton. Yeah. And I just blew Ed Norton in the bathroom. Okay. Right. And so Larry, Charles and Sasha are on set, and they're like, alright, Bobby, you're gonna walk out first. Right. You're gonna hit the mark. Right. Turn around. Right. And then he's gonna come behind you. And this whole thing, I have to memorize this whole thing, right? Sure. Just like yours. That's why I'm saying the story. Right. Hard. So I'm like kind of panicking. I I'm doing the best I can. I'm going, okay, hit the mark, turn left, see the line, this and that. And he's gonna walk this way. Right? So me and Ed get, go into the bathroom and he goes, ed, ed Norton goes, nah, we're not doing that way. I go, he goes, I'm gonna go out first. And I go, what?


What? He goes, yeah. And I'm So you, I know he said to say that, I think it's better if I say this. Then you turn around and you do the, you know what I mean? And he changed is the whole fucking thing. And now in my mind, I'm like, oh, fuck. Whose idea do I do? Right. Do I do Ed Norton's or Larry the director? In your head, you're like the director. Right. Even though he's a star. Right. So that I said something, this is the smartest thing I've ever done. I went, you know what, dude, I love that. That's fucking great. Let's do it Larry's way first and the second team, we'll do it your way. And he go, he kind of thought about it and he goes, all right, man. He'll hate you forever. Now Why That?

Are you fucking joking me with me right now, Dude? Yeah. Fucker. Yes. Relax. All right. Jesus Christ. You're getting so caught up. Yeah. That scene. He's handsome. Yeah, he Is very handsome. That is really, but it's an interesting note though, that he told you he wanted to go out first. Do you think that has to do with, is that Star shit? Yes. It could have been. Is that star shit? He's, he's also an actor's actor. Right? I know, but that's also some star shit.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, you know, Tom Cruise will say that often, that people, it'll be written a certain way and he'll often be like, Hmm, no, no, I wanna be in the front of the line. Joaquin would do stuff like that on set because, you know, he'd go, I, I'd like it to go there. I'd think this way. And he's a genius. Yeah. Guy's like, yes.

And he'd pull out money and I would steal money from him. And I did it a lot. Like, I would do this a lot. Yeah. I feel like I did it way too much.

But I, I would say overall the store, but I gotta be honest with you, the improv is especially recently, I feel like is amazing. I do love it. I Love it too. And I'm actually starting to like the ice house. Yeah. Even Though after you and I had a real wild experience with this time, We, we had a wild experience and I, I just didn't do well and I handled it maturely. I went to like, salt and straw and just climbed in the thing like, you know, with all the ice creams, I just climbed it.

Take it back. We'll Feel bad. Well, everyone will feel stupid. Like, like all of Us. Is there a shot that he can get out with good lawyers?


No. Why? I, yeah. I mean, oj, When I was a kid, Cochran's not around. When I Had, all we believed in was high profile defense attorneys. We grew up with them. I watched 'em, we watched 'em get OJ out. We watched em get all these people out. Like we got excited. They all had names like, like, like a Irv, Irv Fishman. Irv Fishman or Ben Braman. And they would come in there and they would just fucking kill. But, but, and his DA would get up and she'd be like, they found the gun. And he'd be like, you shut up bitch. And he'd have a $4,000 suit. Yeah. And he'd have a Rolex and he'd have a bunch of rings and he'd go Look at this bitch. Like, that's what he'd say. He'd go Look at this bitch. And it'd be some like frizzle haired, the state represented. And us kids.


We were like, the best thing about our country is that if you're rich and you kill someone, you get one of these guys who are the coolest people in the world. Right. Johnny Cochran. What's the other guy's name? Bob Shapiro. Bob Shapiro. Shapiro. Yeah. Oh dude. These people were fucking awesome. Is Dershowitz one Alan Dershowitz? Well, yeah. And he went down with, he went Down to other, He was a good one. He was, He went down. Yeah. The Durst, look at him. The Durst, the Durst dog. Look at him. They got his ass, they got him the Durst dog. But he's still out there. He's debating CNN. Like he's on Pierce Morgan all the time. Debating. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Man. They really, they made him look So Bad though. That's, that's they, the Durst dog got taken down. Well, What happened to him?


Because he's, he was, he wasn't he for what's his name? Flight logs. Yeah. He was defending all the flight logs and all that bullshit. Oh, right. Well he's trying to, he was like advancing the argument that Epstein had a nature conservatory. Yeah. And this whole thing's been a big misunderstanding. Yeah. Right. The guy just said, look at that. He had a green thumb. Yeah. Who you mean green thumb? Epstein. Look, how many times did he go to the island? Look at it. Look at That. Him and Larry Davis. This is my time in a fight in a grocery store in Martha Vineyard. Him and Larry David Did. Yeah. Larry Davis was like yelling at him. He dershowitz was like, I think, you know, obviously coming out for like, like Epstein and Trump and all this stuff. Like, and, and Larry, David and him got into it. That's Fucking Rad. Wow.


Look at that. This is the world we live in. And what do we learn today? Truly? That if you're rich enough and you kill someone, you can get away with it. If. you got a durhan. It depends. If. you got an Irv to come in with a nice suit. Yeah. You know, We learned the, the title of this episode should be somewhere in the middle. The truth is somewhere in the middle. The Truth lies somewhere in the middle. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Because that's the way it is. That's what it is. That's the way life is. That's the truth. And that's what I would, I would, I think that we should remember with Diddy, The truth lies somewhere in the middle. In the Middle. Well that's what I, that that's what we should all. And that's, by the way, I wouldn't even try to say innocence if I was his lawyer. Mm. That's where I'd go.


I'd go. I wouldn't even go like innocent. 'cause that's never gonna happen, right? No. Yeah. Yeah. So I get up there, I go, listen, is it as bad as they say? No. Was it great? Not great. You're a great, No, I'm telling you, dude, You're a great defense. I would've been a great defense attorney. Wow. I would've said, listen, none of this is great. I'm not here to tell you that. This was great. What I'm here to tell you Yeah. Is that I'm A jury. I'm a jury. It's not nearly as bad as what they're saying. And like many things in life and, and, and I would say to you, pay attention. I'd say please pay attention to it. I would say no. When I look, when I'm looking at the sky, you're thinking I'm contemplated. Alright. I would take me a while to learn that and trust that. Alright. Alright.


Let's start. You wanna start, start over. We're jury here. We are. ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I'm here representing Mr. Combs. And I'm gonna tell you this. Am I gonna stand up here and tell you that this was great? No, I'm not gonna say it was great. No, but was it as bad as all these people are saying no. Mm. Like many things in life, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Oh, that's life. People have parties, things get out of hand. No, it takes a lot of people to bake. I don't know what the exact term is, but the point is that cake Yeah.

Okay. It sounds like you're being a little rude. Okay. But I'm not gonna motion for you to be dismissed. What I'm gonna say is this, when you are deliberating, I want you to remember that this is a person. Wow. This is a person with children. Mm. This is a person with children and a career.

No, he is guilty. Act. Yeah. Guilty. He's definitely guilty. But he'll be guilty. He'll Be guilty. I could be sweet so easily. Also in the, in the jury room, you would be such a bad jury. Guilty. Oh, not guilty. What is it called? A hung a hang jury. A hung jury. Yeah. Hung jury. That would be because of you every time. But what's great about the defense attorneys is when they lose, they go on CN Yeah. And CNN's like, what happened? And the defense attorney goes, he's a s Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. He is a terrible person. Right, of course. Like, what did you want me to do? I was making money. Yeah. Wow. That was very intriguing.

So she was an attorney now, which is that her? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's gotta be. Look. So she defended this guy and she would wear these wacky outfits like Miss Frizzle on a magic school Bus. Yeah. And you would end up staring at his bitch's outfits all day and not listening to the thing. Oh wow. So like, I think you could do a fun tag where you're like, the prosecutor's up there doing something and you are doing something very distracting. Yeah. Even some of my language, I wouldn't even talk.


I would say something like, like Hey a new my cousin Vinny, you. Hey. I would go to the jury and go, Hey. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? Yes. Yeah. Right.
