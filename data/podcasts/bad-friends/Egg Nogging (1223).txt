And it's like, it's like a, a game of thronesy kind of a show where there's like, what's all going on?


Game Of a Throne, Right? Yeah. The guy's pitching us, like imagine Game of Throne. Like Yeah. But are you saying singular? What Game Throne? All of them. Too many Throne for Everyone. Every Throne. Everybody. You hear What I mean? Then they go, okay. And they're like, and then, but then you, you know, walking, walking Dead Walk. Oh, walking Dead. Walking Dead.

Game of Thrones. In set in Ancient Korea. Okay. So I'll give you, That's a good pitch. So I'll give you the premise. Yeah. There's a king, right? He's an emperor. Okay. Let me guess. Is it's set during the, the Joe Sun Dynasty? Yes. How'd you know? How'd you know? How'd you know? How'd you know?


How'd you know? Pretty good guess, I guess. Alright. And so he remarried and he, he had, he, you know, the queen is a concubine. One of his concubine. Oh. This must've been taking place during the engine war. Is that true or no? How do you know that? I know a little bit of Korean history. Seriously? You saw the show In the 17th century. No, I know. A little bit of Korean history. Keep going. Please talk to me. I want to, but I'm just, I know some of those things. Okay. Anyway. Does it follow based on, is it based on real people? Like Lee Chang, is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Follows Lee Chang. Shut the fuck up, dude. Shut the fuck up. Dude. What? Shut the fuck up. Did you see It? Okay. Anyway, lemme finish.


I know Lee Chang is the crown person. I know. Fuck. You know that? What Do you mean? I know some ancient Oh, you reading it? No. Yeah. You reading it? No, I'm not. Alright. Anyway, stop reading it. All right. Let Me pitch it to you. Okay. Listen, Jules. All right. Okay. Alright. So, so this, this con mine. She's young, right? And she's pregnant. Right. And he's old, super old emperor. Right? Of course. Course. But he, he already had a son. He's a good guy. His son is a good guy. Yeah. So when the king dies, right, the emperor dies. His son is gonna become emperor. But the concubine iss like, I'm pregnant. Oh. And I have the next. Right? And, and if my baby gets born, right? Right. I love this.


Right. And then the emperor is dying. He's so old. So there's a herb out in the mountains, right? And it's, it, there's like worms attached to this herb. And so when you eat the herb, the worms turn into these fucking worms and they attack your brain. You turn it into a zombie. Whoa. Right? So she's like, Try with prolong the king's life. 'cause he is dying. So she feeds him this flower so that he stays alive until she gives birth. Because if he dies, then he's automatically emperor this other son. Whoa. What? This is wild. No. Why you making kidding? I feel like you don't like It. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I thought it was gonna go a different way. No, no. Right. So the em, the, the emperor's o oldest son is like going like, he, he, he knows that his dad's sick.


He's already dead, but he's a zombie. And they're locked up. He's locked up in his like fortress. But he's technically still alive. He's Technically still alive. But the bitch conant isn't really even pregnant. She lied. She puts a thing in there to pretend. Right. She lied. And she's there. She's on the side gathering women all over that are pregnant and seeing if they're males. The, oh, she's Try with find to steal the baby. Steal a baby. Whoa. Right? And then what happens is the emperor, he's in the fortress and there's a little servant who feeds him. Like humans flesh. Yeah. Right? But the boy gets bitten And he turns into a zombie.


No. Yeah. But he dies. And some people don't turn into a zombie. He just died. Yeah. But what happens is the doctor brings him to a different town to just do an autopsy. But that town is so hungry that one of the villagers chops him. The boy's carcass up and feeds it to the Villagers. I can, I can see why people didn't watch this. And then the villagers, all, dude, I know. Okay, can I just say this? It's Too much. It's too much. It's No, no wa okay. There's this, this, after the first anyone will listen. The first episode, the very end scene. Watch it. It is incredible. I'll say this. Okay. It sounds good. It went a little too wonky.


Donkey. Here's what it should have been. She's pregnant. She's actually, the Show's a hit. Whatcha you talking about? If they did two seasons, you can't rewrite It. I'm rewriting it. Okay. Alright. It wasn't a hit. You just said it lasted two and then they killed it and no one watched it. You started this off by saying nobody watched this fucking show. So clearly it wasn't a hit. It wasn't a hit. Here's how it would've been. Great. Take it outta the fantasy world of zombies. Just make it so that she's pregnant and there is a team of people who are Try with, kill her so this baby doesn't get born so that this other, other next to kin gets the kingdom. So it's a war of Try with kill this woman to get this baby out of her. So she she's not carrying the next king.


No, I love that. Better than eating a worm in the brain and to keep 'em in the zombie and the bites. The boy. No, But these villagers that eat I don't like zombies. That's my, you know, I don't Oh, You don't like zombies? Can I, can I ask you about zombies? Zombies doesn't do it for me. I I have a thought about zombie. You like zombies? I like zombies. Okay.

One morning my dad go, goes, wakes me up. Merry Christmas. I go, okay. And he goes, he gave me 200 bucks. Right? That was Christmas. It, it gets worse. It was July. Is that Korean Christmas in July? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they don't know anything about, so you never did Any Decoration. My parents knew nothing about any holiday. You Didn't get a tree, ever. You, yeah.

Tell for Koreans. Tell Yeah, Tell me. They do. It's considered a national holiday in Korea. Most employees have a day off from work. But where can you look this up later? I mean, whatever. When that was a thing. I don't think it was like that when my parents grew up. Well, right. I think my mom, my parents, because when they came to America in their, in their six in this 1960s, they knew nothing about it. So there you go. When Did it become concept of Christmas was introduced. Oh, right. It was before it was. Yeah. Really? It was the late 17 hundreds. In 18 hundreds when Catholic, my parents Didn't care.


Introduced as Christmas as important holiday described by Christian events in detail. So in the late 17 hundreds. Well, your parents were way before that. Your mom was born in like 1502 or Oh four. No, what? That boggles my mind because my parents pretended like they didn't know. Like, well, you don't Know. Yeah, but check this out. This has gotta be socioeconomic too. Right? Like I'm sure your parents didn't grow up with anything. They couldn't afford Christmas. They were struggling to survive. Yeah. I don't think this Has gotta be privileged People in Korea that had money could celebrate Christmas. Maybe not. Your your not your fucking parents. They, they maybe. Yeah. Maybe their Families didn't come from a lot of money. Well, why don't say that like that, that's A good thing. No, my parents look at, look at my mom on my mom's says we were royal.


No they weren't. Yeah. The royal bloodline. No, No chance. My dad's side were ghetto. My, my parents' side, my mom's side was royal. My, my, my grandfather and my, remember I told you about the hill that my mom used to walk down? Yeah. That was like one house on a mountain. How did you guys fall so far? What do you mean?

You think so? Well, I think because it's compass through compassion that they understand that you're probably using drugs because you have an addictive bloodline. They Didn't know about it. They don't know About it. No. But they, you can, you can empathize. Maybe there's something in your mom. Maybe your mom has a very, she does empathetic way.

So like a, a 'cause remember we went, so we went to the Philippines. Yeah. We were in that one field, not a field, but there was like a goat tied to a, like a stick. Yeah. And then we brought spaghetti. Yeah. You feed spaghetti to the goat. No, no to, no. We took, we took like hundreds of spaghettis boxes of spaghetti. Yeah. To feed the hungry. Yeah. So, and then they ran outta these huts.

And, and I warmed it up to the American cheese melted all over that fucking Oh my Lord. And I had mercy on, I had a little bit of onions and peppers leftover. Wow. Buddy. So I had two of those. And then I was up, once you eat that midnight snack, shit, you're up, you're not going back to bed. We gotta let di Digest first. Well, that's why I stayed up for a little while. Yeah. You know, when people wake, do you wake up in the middle of the night to pee? Oh yeah. Do you wake up in the middle of the night to poop too? No. I've started to do that. Some, yeah. I'll wake up to poop sometimes.

If I close a door, they're just waiting there like this. And I hold my pee. I go, I don't want deal with 'em. What are they gonna do to just walk around? No, they try to get in. But What do they do? Sometimes I'll open it and one will scurry it and then go underneath the bed. And then now I have to like, go underneath the bed and grab them. Grab Them. What do they do? If you're in the room when you're sleeping? You don't even know they're there. They just kinda walk around. No, because You don't understand. Cats are nocturnal animals. Yeah. They're up.

Everyone showed up. Good. Roger. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone showed up. Hmm. I remember I used to go every, every year. Mm. You remember that? Yeah. Yeah. You do. You do. Huh? Yeah. You don't really think about that. Do you be honest with Me? Yeah. Yeah. While you were driving back from Palm Springs. Yeah. Did you think about maybe popping in there and surprising? No. I don't even know where it is. That's even more hurtful. Yeah, It's very hurtful. You know, Where's the address? You know that I know whose house it's at. 'cause if You don't get invited, then You don you have no idea where the fucking location is. Right. It could be a number of places. That is true. 'cause we had Thanksgiving, but we didn't do it at my house. We did it at Buca Depo. So you never know. Yeah. You never know where it's gonna happen. But when I was driving back from Palm Rego, I was thinking to myself, wow, I should just drive off this freeway because I'm so lonely.


Why don't you come to my house? I'm so lonely. I wanted you at my house. And I am so lonely and so alone. I have nobody, I literally have nobody. I know you have you, but it's like, you know, I don't wanna rely on, you know, so it's like, I want you to want me. I know. I, I know, I know. I Want You to want me. I know, but I, it was so miserable. I actually held out. I feel so alone. We kept a Chair. Oh my God. We kept a chair for you at the dinner table. Do you know this? Oh, we kept a chair at the table in the hopes that you would show up. Because I even said, oh my God. I said, I Have nobody. You have me. I'm alone. I'm truly alone. No, you're not. I really am. Why Do you say that? Because I am, But, But I wake up and I go, oh, no one's fucking here. Okay.


Okay. First of all, yeah. First of all, let's be real though. Yeah. Not someone being in your home is different than you having a wealth of people that are deeply in love with you on many levels. I don't Know, man. I can tell you that's a fact. I mean, Last night I was like sitting there with Ian bag just talking, you know, Love Ian bag. And I do too. It's Like one of the funniest dudes in comedy. Yeah. And I was like, he's like, are you okay? I go, I'm so alone. Where were you at? Store Improv. Well, that'll make you feel lonely. That place. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no. I get it. Just, I, I get it. But by the way, comedy clubs are the worst place for our egos. Why? Because it's like a, it's a, it's a, it's a test. It's a test. Your, it's a test of your skill and your self-assurance and your self-awareness and all that shit.


Standup clubs are hard on your ego, whether we know it or not. What do you mean hard on our egos? Because It, you're, you're constantly in, you should know of all people. You are constantly in conflict with yourself over being good enough and funny enough, and Yeah. It's also, That's a hard place to do. To be Keeps you honest. Keeps you honest. Yeah. It keep, well, it keeps you, it also keeps you very in sharp, introspective. Yeah. 'cause you know how you and I did a show Friday night. It was packed in the main room. Slammed. But, But you weren't on the lineup last night in the main room. I didn't go there. It was just me. Yeah. It was dead. Really? Yeah. It was. So Saturday Night, they had to put both curtains up. No. Yeah. So I was back there and I'm like, you know, the only kind of name except for Yamanaka was in town.


So she did it. Oh, wow. But I was just like, oh, I, I can't, I'm, I'm, I don't draw anymore. I'm Gonna, that's not true. I know it's not, but in my mind, I'm like, and people are like, dude, it's the hol you know, it's the holiday weekend. I know. But it's like, and then when you're already in a state of D depression, it just kind of piles on and you start thinking negatively. It spirals. It spirals. So I'm like, been spiraling. Well, I thought in the, the morning, this morning in the shower, 'cause we talked last week, you asked me about my depression and I want to give you some credit. You, you guys listened and I got out when I needed to get out and it made me feel really good. But I want you to be honest. Then go ahead. About your depression. Where you go when you get low. 'cause I didn't ask you back.


You kinda let me just mouth vomit. No, it's fine. What do you mean where do I go? Well, you asked me inside myself. You Said, where do I go when I get really depressed? And I told you where I think I disappear to. Where do you go? I told you last week. I think I, I, I just, I get in a place of isolation. Oh, I see. I see. I don't wanna talk to people. I need to be left alone and I need to either exercise or go away. Like when you drive back from Palm Springs and you were sad, where, where, where are you? I start fantasizing about like, where I could like ending it all. Not my life, like where you, but I would end this whole pursuit of comedy in this dream. Right. And then I would like sell all my assets.


Retire So to speak. Retire, you know, grab all my, and go to the, you know, like a town that no one knows me. Where is this? What does it look like? I've always thought about like taking, like having, so like a bunch of like in a fishbowl. A bunch of like trailer parks. What? Like trailer parks? Like Oh, the Paper. Literal Trailer. Yeah, trailer. And putting my hand in. I go, oh, I guess I'm gonna live in like Shreveport, Louisiana. For how long? A Year? For my rest of my life. No, no, no. You gotta keep doing the, keep dipping in The fish. Maybe every year. But I would get to go into a trailer park and just disappear. Wow. Yeah. Trailer Park bobbylee. Yeah. And then I would look strange too. What Do you, what Would you look bell bottoms Every day. Yeah. Yeah. Even in Louisiana. Yeah. I look like Elko Racha.


Oh, I love El Racha. Yeah. I would do El Racha with a, I would bring a wife Beater. What are you wearing up top? A Wife beater. But also I want, but also I want definitely like one of those El Mariachi guitar. Oh yeah. Or on my shoulder. Right. All bottomed. A lot of like his like, you know, I would go to his style too. Who? McCone? No. Fancy fan. Oh, What shitty shirts? Yeah. Like t-shirts with like, you know what I mean? Elegant bread, people doing dancing, you know what I mean? And then I would probably wear, and this is probably not appropriate, but something with feathers. How is that not appropriate? What are you not allowed to? Like feathers, you Know, peoples it's cultural appropriation or whatever.


How I would ha you know what, I would do that, but with three flutters and a gigantic blood diamond on my forehead. Love. You know what I mean? Like not a polished one. No, just a raw blood diamond. Right. And then it was like maybe blood from like real blood. A revolutionary, you know what I mean? On it? Or, or, or you know, or smuggler. Shout out to smuggler blood South Africa. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Just dried on there. You know what I mean? I would probably wear the football paint. Oh, like war paint? No, not war paint. Football paint. Or just, you know how sometimes they just put black? Yeah. Do you know what that's for? Why? That's actually interesting. I'm surprised that football players are the only ones that wear that. Yeah. Why aren't I Soccer players could wear it too. Yeah. I would do that. Reflection of the light. Light of the sun. It helps. That's Right. Helps. That's Why I would do it. Helps. Keep it outta your eyes.


Make My eyes wider. Lemme see If I will that 'cause the sun's not. That's so funny. Blood, Blood diamond. You imagine all it takes for free feather. All it takes for Asians to have bigger eyes to just put on that black under the, their eyes. Yeah. Whoa. They can use an extra fine sharpie. Okay. Oh, okay. There he is. Yeah. Yeah. He only waits. Yeah. He only waits for the jokes that he knows. He can tell. Yeah, that's right. Right. If we ask him to do the joke, he can't think of it. That's right. Right. But if, if one pops in his says, even if it's gonna piss me off, he has to say it because he knows that it, it's kind of good. Kind Of good. Yeah. Yeah. So let's, let's get back on a happy track then. Yeah. Is there something you're excited for at the end of the year or at the beginning of next year?


No. Really? Yeah. What? There's nothing brewing for you? No, nothing. Well, I'm excited about, I've, I've lost 10 pounds, so I'm gonna, I'm think I'm, I'm excited about. It's awesome. I watched The original Christmas episode like a few days ago. Yeah. It's wild. How much smaller you look. Yeah. Yeah. That's like, Yeah. You do look smaller. Everyone has commented. Yeah. Literally every then. But when I get another 10, 15 pounds, I'm gonna then go To the gym, Do my thing. Have you, can you, does your penis look better? No. I'm serious. When you lose some weight, sometimes your dick looks better. It's most of the weight's from that. Oh my God. Yeah. Your dick lost 10 pounds. Five pounds. Five pounds. Wow. Definitely five pounds a dick.


So Let's get you fat again. Dude. That's a bad idea. It's so funny. I went to the spa the other day and I saw a couple of really big dudes with like little micro dicks. Love. They look like buttons. You Mean big as in fat or strong? No, they're just a button. No, no. Their body. Were they fat or Strong? Oh, fat. Oh, well, fat's different. They're Huge. Right. But they have a little Benjamin button there. That's why they got so fat. Yeah. You have a tiny penis. You're gonna eat your sadness away. But I don't, I wonder why, how that happens. They have big hands. Yeah. But they probably got fat because of their small dick. I just said they got sad. They saw that little pecker and they thought, never gonna use this. I might as well just eat away my feelings. Wow. I like seeing a buff guy at the gym with a small little penis. I love that. Why?


'cause he's like, fucking I'm Jack. And you're like, nah. But that's why he's buff. I know. But that, for that overcompensated. That's why regular guys like us have regular dicks. It's great. Yeah. We didn't, we didn't win. We didn't lose. It's fine. Yeah. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, you know what our cos are? Vanilla bean ice cream. Exactly. French vanilla beef. It's good. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's not the one that everybody wants, but it's fine. Yeah. You know, and yours has a little bit of mango in it. You did a couple slices of mango che fruit, cheche Che fruit. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. Anyway, yeah. By the way, I just, at the spa today, I went in the hot tub and you know, you go naked in the men's spa. And so you, I'm naked in the hot tub. And a guy came out of the, came out of the sauna and didn't know if someone was in there.


'cause I'm sure he went in and no one was on that section. It was kind of quiet today. And he came out and he like saw me and panicked and grabbed one of the towels to cover up his little penis. And then I had to pretend like I didn't see his little penis. Yeah. 'cause he stood right there. And I, and I kind of like, are You Naked? Looked the other way. Yeah. You have to be. Yeah. That. So when I'm at the, I took Jules to the, not Jules, Jesse to the Wiba. Oh yeah. We Went to Wiis Spa together. How was that? It was so fun. Yeah. Yeah. She was a little scared. Yeah. It's you, it's foreign. Yeah. But when I always notice, literally, yeah. I always noticed though, there's like white dudes completely wearing like basketball shorts. Yeah. In the steam room. And then the Koreans and the blacks were like completely naked.


Right? Yeah. But there's always, why, why is that White At the white meeting? The, you guys talk about that. The white meeting We do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and this is gonna offend you, but we wear shorts. 'cause we don't wanna sit on the same ground as you. We need some sort of cloth separation. Oh yeah. Oh, it's good. Oh, yeah. Because you know, the thing is, when I go to the sea room, I put a towel down and I sit on that. That's not enough protection. Not for us. Maybe it's psychological. Yeah. It's mainly psychological. Well, It's like, you know, when you put down Right. You don, when put down people put down those things on the toilet. Yeah. You know, the, the, that's not doing anything. Yeah. But we need the reassurance. Can we create a company that makes those but make 'em like thicker The toilets he covered.


Yes. Okay. I think it's a great idea. Can We not have a fucking, there's gotta be a substitute for that. But Could you? But it has to be, be able to throw away. So how can it deport? 'cause the thing is, is that when you, 'cause I sat at the, I was at the airport when we were coming back. Yeah. And I was pooping. Yeah. Emergency poo. And somebody had peed on the fucking seat seat. Gross. So then you have to put nine layers of those things to absorb the pea so that it doesn't get on your, what If we just travel with one of those? I know, By the way, it's a neck. There's a net pillow. It's a neck pillow and Wow. Yeah. That's interesting. But there's still pee on the fucking LL what do you call it? The seat. Yeah. So you gotta clean that. You have a pea side and a butt side, and you always have the pea side down.


You just always know which side is it's by color. Right? I don't know. The Pea side will be yellow and then that's a Little too thick to walk around with. Right. You think so? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But we'll have a carry all, we'll have a bag that's specifically designed for it. That looks cool. See, you don't see women don't have that. Because you know, women sit down and they pee. Right? I Don't, no. She stands up. I don't what She lifts one leg up like a dog. No, she hovers. I step On the seat and then I squat. Why? Because I Don't want It's Gross touch. Gross. Wait a minute. You really, you don't stand on the seat. You just hover. No, you Physically stand. He put two feet on there like a fucking monkey. Wait, You put your Feet on the Toilet Seat? Yeah. That's Insane. Like a spider monkey dude. Yeah.


Why Don't you just hover? It's hard because I know a lot of women that hover hovering is a very normal, they hold the walls. Yeah. But what, but what I'm saying is that if everyone just sat, you are not gonna get pee on the seat. Correct. We have pee on the seat. Because people stand and pee on the seat. On the seat. That's true. Well, how about this? How about this? Why is it, you know, like the, the women do the hovering technique, you know, like this, this is like a, a constant thing. I, I I like what you're thinking. What, what, what was it? What do I, I just know it's gonna be something enlightening. It's gonna be great. I love it. Tell me, Why aren't women's toilets higher off the ground then?


That wasn't what I, Why do they have to hover and crouch? Why can't they just, why don't they make a mechanism that like goes up to them so they can just stand? Yeah. Why don't they do that? Why do they have to hover over? Or this one. Oh, Oh, so your stand, and it's kind of like a thing that goes over here. Yes. And you're just like, right. You hit A button. Woo. Yeah. And it Just cups. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Why don't they Do that? And They p And you can walk. So now you're in. Why don't they do that with us? We don't need that. 'cause we, we like to stand and pee. It's like a nature. It's like a, it's like a male nature. No, I mean, for pooing. Oh, I don't, well, extra tall toilet. See, this is what I'm talking about getting off.


Can you, can you poop like that? No, you can't poop like that. I'm doing Yeah, I've done that. You pooped straight Up. Oh yeah. Stiff as a board. Oh shit. It must be Messy. That's how we end the meetings. Oh. Oh. Tell you it's your exit. No, but when I've camped, when I've gone camping. Yeah. Yeah. You lean against a rock and poop. You never done that? No. Have You pooped in the ocean? I, god knows. I know you have. I know you poop. It's super hard. I know you've pooped in the ocean. Yeah. Yeah. It's so gross. It's so Awesome. It's gross. It's actually awesome. Yeah. Now I've never pooped in the ocean, but every time I pee in the ocean, I also stand up above water level. So I'm not peeing underwater. Why? Because I don't want anything swimming inside my Pepto Speak.


Speaking of the ocean. That's a real thing. Yeah. That's a real fear. Something. And by the way, oh, this is what I was gonna say too. Looked up the statistics of this. Catching something like from a toilet seat, like from sitting on it is literally impossible. You'd have to have open wounds on your legs and they'd have to be fresh bacteria on the seat to catch anything from the toilet. Oh. You can catch poo. And I don't want poo. I'm sorry. You can catch poo and pee and I don't want that. Yeah, but you just wipe it off. It does. On your o off of my butt cheek. No, dude, I don't want poo on my butt cheek before I sit down. Yeah, yeah. And by the way, who's pooping on the toilet seat? I've seen it. This one that's hovering. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen it. A hover shit. Yeah. Yeah. No, but when I get into the bathroom, I take toilet paper, I wipe the seed.


Anyway, it's Still dirty. How, how dirty. Yeah. Yeah. How dirt. No, seriously. How dirty? No one is pooping. Only, the only thing that's getting on there is other people's butts. That's it. That's it. No one is lifting up and pooping on the seat. It's, it doesn't happen. It will not happen. It cannot happen. I've, I swear to God, I've seen poo on the seat before. Then. Maybe it's at a, where, a place where young kids are and they're fucking, their little shitty gross. But most of the time in a Yeah, yeah. In an adult atmosphere. There's nothing on the seed. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a little bit of piss. Yeah, a little bit of piss. By the way, if you pee in a toilet with, with shorts on, you feel it on your legs. Yeah. You pee in a urinal, you feel it all over your legs. I just think that the God should have made it different.


Our body's different. Well, Where would you, where would you put it? I put the butt hole in the bottom of my foot. You've said this before, and I think I've said that before. It's A great idea. Yeah. I've this before. And where do you pee from your fingers? Yeah. Yeah. You can get it. You can get it. You can get it away from you. You could shouldn't Pee at the same like, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just Your, yeah. Your Dude. Imagine This would be great. Yeah. That's why if someone's pissing, But then you'd sit down and you have to wipe like this though. That's Not bad. That's not bad. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Or you do. Or we just create a mechanism, you know, like at a bar, you know how they, you flip a glass upside down and they have a washer. Water sprays up. Stab that for your foot. That's fucking great. Little foot. That's great. Dude. Don't have to wipe ever again. Yeah. Unless somebody has a foot fetish. That'd be weird. Maybe not really.


No. Well, yeah, that would be weird. Oh, How would gaze Foot. Foot fucker. You foot Fucker. That's a new look at these foot fuckers over there. Look at that foot fucker there, dude. Fucking fucker.

And it's, I try to bring up the last podcast. I said I, I brought up Caco. Right. But then we didn't riff on it. But it really is an enlightening little Podcast. What is it about? So, have you ever seen Free Willie The movie?


Yeah. Yeah. You did. Yeah, of course. So when they, they, they found a whale to play Willie. Yeah. It was this whale in Mexico. Hard to cast. Yeah. It was a Mexican whale. Yeah. I wanna be free Willie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. You would think if they got a whale to jump, it would've been a black whale. Right. But so then when, when the movie comes out, it becomes a hit. And all the kids were like, where is this whale? And they're like, it's in this tiny little pool. It ha it's mal malnutrition, malnourished. Yeah. Kind of. I mean, I, you know, I don't know what the conditions were. They weren't gross. I mean, they weren't the best. It's awful. Right? So they, so the playing pretty much every, everyone on the planet that had something to do with whales, they go, we, we want to try to free him.


But he's been in captivity since he was a ki baby. This is real free Willie. Yeah. Yeah. So they ship the, they build a completely big facility in Oregon, this high tech facility. Yeah. So it, they build his muscles and they try to train them in terms of how to catch fish, how to dive, you know what I mean? All that stuff. And then after a couple years, they bring him to ice Iceland where they found the baby to release him. But they put him in a little bay first. And it's this voyage out into the real sea And Wow. And you, well, you don't see it. You hear it. It's A podcast. It's five episodes. I listen to all of it and it's really just, you know, it melts your heart Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Did it live? Because a lot of times, yeah.


I mean, I, I don't know if we should give that away. Well, We did. It's great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Fuck it. Well, my, That's, that's what makes me so mad about this document. And that's why I want people to listen to it. So when people go, what the fuck? And I go, fuck you, dude. I thought you, you know what I mean? That's on you. You know what mean? Whatever my instinct was that did live. Because when they re-acclimate, he Came close though. Not Really. No. What Ha Can I just tell, we just gave it away. Was He killed by another killer whale? No. What happened was, it's so sad because it's like all these, you know, all his trainers and all the people that work for this organization, they, they got to a point where they, 'cause he was so reliant on humans Right. That even if he saw a boat, he would just come up to the boat and, and say hi. So that what all these people would do, they would have to hide. Mm. So all of a sudden now KO's alone Oh.


And he doesn't know what to do. So they open up the bay and then they see, you know, sometimes these killer waves have these parties. I've been to one I know. In the white. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But they're half black too. We're okay with that. Okay. Alright. Depends on that. So they had these parties and like Kako would watch from a distance. Yeah. But he's in the ocean and they're all communicating, having fun and KACO's just like, I don't know what to do. Right. So when did Caco just 'cause they're all the, his trainers are hiding. He just starts going into the ocean by himself. Traveling thousands of miles. Oh. Caco by himself. You know what I mean? And then one day in Norway, this little kid and his Norwegian family were on their boat and Caco pops his head up.


He would travel thousands of miles. Wow. And they're like, whoa, this killer whale is so nice. And he would just follow them around. 'cause he just, you know what I mean? So lonely. And then, and at nights, the family could hear Caco outside. Yeah. Yeah. Like, where are you? You know what I mean? I know. It's so sad. Feels so right. And then he dies. He Dies. He dies. No, he dies. It's so sad. It's so sad. But That's a circle of life. Yeah. It's Not, not, that's not the circle of life you don't take. Here's what it Is. It shouldn't have done in the first killer Whale. Right. You, they, they're so attached to their mothers. In fact, right. Killer whale mothers.


Right. Even when the, when their son is fully grown, they'll rip up a piece of fish and then leave some for the kid. That's how attached they are. Right. Right. And it's like, and they're, they're called pods. That's your family. And they know each other for all their lives. Right. And they have their own language. They know how to communicate. Kako doesn't know any of that shit. So, Of course Kako wasn't gonna survive based on all that. I mean, this is like ripping away their core instincts and Yeah. It's like, you should not, I mean that she ruled should not exist. Any of these things should not exist. I agree. Yeah. Do you do what about zoos? I think zoos are bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit. It's Auschwitz for animals. A hundred Percent. You know what I mean? A hundred percent. What are you laughing at? I like, you know, you know what?


You seem like a guy that captures them. I like the Alliteration of Auschwitz for animals, it sounds like. Okay. Do. Anyway. It's, and whenever you see these animals, it's just like, they just, they don't know what's going on. Well, It's also, I don't care how like kept the zoo is, it's always, it's always awful. It's always looks like shit. They look like they're bummed. That's why there's all, there's always sorts of like, wild shit that happens at a zoo because they just don't wanna be there. They don't wanna fucking live. Like they know in their gut, they're not supposed to be there. And they look sad every fucking time you go. It's the worst. But also when they, so when they brought Kako to the new or tank that they built in Oregon, they built half of the tank with it's see-through and reporters and people from the town would visit, and Kaco would always come by and just sit there and just say hi.


Mm. Through these humans. Like, you know what I mean? And play with them. He was Raised by humans. Yeah. He, she just loved humans. And all of a sudden we were like, nah. You know what I mean? It's like, it's it's insane. He doesn't Yeah. Is a guy or a girl. Caco. It's a boy. Really? Maybe man up his name. Wait, what? Make change his name. Caco. Yeah. That was probably why he didn't make it. Anyway. I mean, Merry Christmas to everybody. Merry Christmas to almost everybody. Yeah. Thank you for being a almost everybody.
