Which Is what? Well, they're all having like politicians on journalists. Tim. Tim got fucking interviewed by like CNN. Yeah. I was like, what in the fuck is going on? Yeah. We stay here.

You know what I mean? Replacing some of that. You know, I That's not good. Yeah. People, we shouldn't replace it. This should be its own thing. Yeah. This is its own form of music. Do You know what I mean?


Well, You know, like the news on TV was like the dictatorship, the regime. And then the internet was like an American military coup. Mm. And then there was a vacuum. And now comedians and like grifters are like Warlords. They're like news Warlords. Whoa. We're Warlords. Yeah. We're not Warlords. No. What are we We're like Sweden. Sweden war. You guys like funny Warlords. Yeah. Yeah. Used to we're Funny Warlords. Okay. The dictator would be in control and give it. Now you're like marauding. Warlords in control of your own fiefdom. Wow.

And I had a bond with them.


Oh yeah. That was what, Yeah. This is what people do when they try to cover from the fact That's right. That they want all, all of 'em out. Yeah. I'm not done with the story. Okay, go ahead. Right. So I had this experience with them, You know, I mean, every morning and then I called Ice and they're gone. I knew it. I knew it. Well, it's so close to the border. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like that to go far. I'm kidding. Yeah, no, I I I really love those guys, You know? Yeah. And to me, they're just hardworking people that just, You know, they came from a place where they couldn't really afford to feed their families and they came here and they, they're doing the work that normal people don't want to do. And I have no problem with that. I agree. And We're all normal people. Normal people, nor Wow.


Americans don't wanna do. Wow. But you call them normal people, so they're abnormal people. Mm. No, they're not. They're normal as well. So, but why'd you say nor they're Normal in an abnormal way.
