Because you know I got the answer. I know You got the answer. This Is gonna break something.


Yeah. Look at McCone is the most scared. Don't go hard, because When I go like this, it's gonna naturally go sideways. You know that right? Oh my God. Stop. Stop. That's it. So what's your, what are your, how's your sleeping and Saying It's terrible. I can't believe you're doing spots. I had a spot at midnight and I first time in my life canceled It Saturday night. I didn't do it one Saturday. I canceled. Well, I told you that was a bad No, no. I went, I Thought you, yeah, I went, I went. I went. I went. And you went Monday. I went Monday. Yeah. Not Tonight. And tonight. No, No. Tonight. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. So what time have you been sleeping? I've been trying to go to bed at night, but I stay awake till like 4:00 AM and then I, I still wake up at 9:00 AM and then I am tired all day.


Yeah. Yeah. It's rough. What about you? I'm good. I know you are. I knew You would be Good. I'm good because I did the exact pattern. I told you. Oh my God. It's gonna drive me crazy. That pattern. Oh my God. Isn't that funny? Oh my God. The funniest part is I need it. I literally said when we fly to Sydney, He, he, he, this is what I did. I did the pattern. Everyone that listening, this is what he does. This is what he does. Okay. Yeah. Because he's Mr. Know-it-all. Okay. That's my new name. Mr. Mr. Know-it-all dude. Right. But it's Mr. Nno. Mr. No. Yeah. No, Mr. It's for noit All. And so Mr. Know-it-all, he obviously, we do a group meeting. We do. When he has his little Ted talks. Right. Well, there, well, this Is what we need to do. Right? They're TEDxs.


Yeah. Yeah. So he goes, so he says, alright, from, from Perth to Australia. Right. Don't sleep at all. We were In the airport. We Were in. Yeah. But yeah. Per perk to Sydney. Yeah. Sorry. From, but okay. That's another know-it-all thing you just said could let it go. You could have let it go, But you did it. I'm Mr. Know-all. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All that's my gift. Alright. So from Perk to Sydney, don't sleep it up. Which is like a four and a half hour flight. Four hours. Yeah. What did I do? Slept The whole time. The whole time. I Stayed Awake the whole time. Because when he says something to do, I go the opposite. Smart. I want to, I'm miss, and I'm know-it-alls nemesis. Wait a Minute. Yeah. I'm Mr. Know-it-all, you're Mr. No. No. At all. That's Mr. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what it is. Yeah. Right. So I say, no, I slept the whole way.


Right. Smart. Yeah. Good For you. And then like A fucking idiot. You stayed up the entire flight home? I did. Yeah. 15 hours. Watch me, watch me. I said stay up on the first leg. On the second leg. Eat the dinner, and then last as long as you can to match up with the la clock and go to bed. 'cause then it'll be nighttime. Then when you wake up, it'll be noon in LA when we wake up and get to la. But it'll actually kind of be our sleep schedule. We'll think it's like 10, nine or 10:00 AM which I go, that'll work perfectly. I took, I I was up during the meal. I see him, I watch across the aisle. He's on his iPad. And you can hear him. Ha I can hear him laugh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then I go to bed. Right. I wake up from bed feeling good, take a piss.


He's still up, still on his iPad. And I know he hasn't fallen asleep. Still giggling in the exact same position. Yeah. Ha. Yeah. Exact same position. Then I go back again. I'm stretching a little bit. I'm thinking he probably is asleep now. Wide awake. Wide awake. Not one hour of sleep on 15 hour flight. Ha ha. And now what's happening? I Can't sleep. Yeah, I know. See, I told you so. Well, you were right. But I refuse. Right. Good for you. Right, right. You should. I would rather, And here's another thing that I Would rather, you know what? I'd rather this for you. I like this for I Know you do. And here's another thing that I did, huh? One long time ago, you and I went bowling. Yeah. Right. And you tried to teach me how to Bowl. That's right. Yeah. And I refused.


That's right. But then when we went to Sonny's birthday party. Yeah. Right. Charles Melton taught me exactly what you taught me. But I, I listened to what he said. Good. Do you remember? Yeah. Yeah. Right. And I started bowling correctly. Right. And I looked at you and I, I think you were a little upset by, by it. Yeah. A Little bit. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, you know, I re like, if he teaches me something, I refuse to listen. But if it's like anybody else Right. With the same knowledge. Yeah. Because he has all, he's Mr. Know-it-all Right, Mr. Know it all. But I don't know why that is. Why is that? You think? 'cause you resent the fact that I am younger than you, but no more than you. He's talented too. There's literally nothing you can't do. God Bless. I love You. We talked about it the other day. I said, can you name one thing you can't do?


And you couldn't. That's not true. I said he Couldn't do that. He couldn't think He can't beat me. That's the one thing he can, he can't Beat. He can't beat me. He can't beat me in ping pong. How about this? I can't play piano. And he's beautiful at piano. Ping pong. Ping pong. I can beat you. Get a table. Oh My God. Tennis. A tennis. We might be more evenly matched. I wasn't tennis team in High school. I know. Broke it. And that was 40 years ago. It Doesn't matter. I, and that was literally, I hadn't ridden a bike since I was in high school. And we went, rode a bike in fucking Australia. There's no phrase. That's, Hey, it's just like tennis. Once you learn, you never not learn. There is no tennis phrase. Yes. It it, it goes to tennis. It's Just like hitting a tennis ball. Yeah.


Yeah. Once you know, you know, Once you know, you know. Yeah. Yeah. We did ride a beautiful bike around rotten ness Island and had a gorgeous day at Rotten Ness Island. We did probably one of our best days. What A rollercoaster though. Incredible. Right. Why? Well, 'cause we, I kind of hyped it up the entire trip. Andr Bobby kept pulling me aside and saying, listen, I know everyone says they're the cutest animals on earth, but what if we get there and they don't like us. That's right. And we got there and they were all just like looking for food. 'cause I'll tell you why. Yeah. May I tell you why? Yeah. My wisdom on this. Yeah. Okay. Look at 'em right there. Oh My God. They are cute. They're so cute. Rice. They're so cute. They're so fucking cute. So Edible. By the way, they look very edible. Yeah. They look like porks. They Look like they look like Little Andres. Yeah. Little Andres.


So here's the situation here, guy, my friend is, is that, I'll tell you how the cuca came into my, I told you right? How? Yeah. Jim Jeffries. Jim Jeffries, right. Months ago. Pulled me aside night. You gotta see the CUAs. Yeah. He told me the island and everything. Right. So I've been thinking and dreaming about a Long time. I get that. Yeah. And then when we got there, some fucking bloke, some Australian bloke says to me, Knight, you know why they call it Rot Nest island? I go, why? And he goes, because the first guy that went there Right. Thought they were rats. So in my mind I'm like, oh, they're not.


They're, they're not as I, because what we see, we, I thought they were like gonna be real small like rats. Me Too. Yeah. Right. But then when I saw, that's me. Yeah. When I, yep. Look at that. You'd taken a photo with one so beautifully. Yeah. Oh, the Joey's coming Out. Yeah. The little Joey's coming out of the stomach. Dude, that was like magical In love at the, in love with that. And that was Like four hours into the trip. You got that. Yeah. That was the last second. We were about to Right. We're about to board the boat to go home. Well, because I don't, here's, you know, when people go crazy over celebrities? Yeah. That's how I Felt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I go less crazy. Yeah. I take a step back and I go, you know, I'm better than that. Right. So there, there was a lot of ef fawning. A lot of fawning. Yeah. Right.

It's fine. And Wasn't that will not, you are right. No, I'd actually preferred it if you did. If you did go ahead and make fun of me. Well, so you asked me to close the shows.

It Could have been one show where you're like, here's a deal. It could have been one show. I was like, you know what? I just feel like closing out the second show. No, No. The truth really is, I thought, okay, if they're coming to see, I'm not gonna have you get upset at me because I did too much time in the front. So I was like, Let me close the show so I don't hear it from you. From, 'cause every show we've ever done. Mm. If I do too much time, okay. And there's proof in the booth, you do get mad.

Because I'm healthy. I'm alive. Are you afraid of a dentist? Is that what that is? No, I'm really not. I'm just lazy. Like how my car skied. I didn't fix it, but This tripping me out. When's the last time you went to a dentist? For real? Maybe when I was a teenager. Andrew checked this out In fucking 30 years. Yeah. Andrew. Andrew. Check it out. What? What am I doing? What? Who was that? You're a dentist. No, no. It's worse. What? Every woman that makes my, Oh, okay. All right. I just imagine It. That wasn't Kilah. Oh. Oh, Wow. Whoa. Shots fucking fired, dude. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Very good. The frequency of dental visits depends on your individual circumstances.


However, the A DA recommends the American Dental Association Wow. Recommends adults and children see the dentist every six months. That's so Dorky. No one does that. I think that almost everyone I know does Really? Yeah. I go to dentist. Everyone in this room goes to the dentist. What? You, you don't, you don't ev I mean, at the very least, once a year is definitely what you should do. I Did tell Jesse this, but I did brush my teeth with Sprite and Adelaide. Yeah. I forgot about that. I said, my Sprite. And he goes, I don't know what fizz is, Bro. He's just rubbing sugar on his Teeth, bro. Bro. Dude, that's the problem. That is. Yeah. Yeah, that's, I think we found it. Yeah. We found the problem. You're brushing your teeth with Sprite.


Yeah. Yeah. I Was too lazy to go to the bathroom. Just do It with pop rocks. Those fits do dog. Do you smell? I mean, is there other smells in your body that you're not aware of or privy to? I don't know. I can't smell them. I Can't smell. You can smell, But I can't smell like marijuana or anything like that. Yeah. You dip. You dip and smell. You dip and smell. Yeah. Yeah. Like dip your finger in your butt and Smell it. No, not the pot. No, no. But don't start there. Yeah, don't start there. No, but I'll like, I'll go like this and do that. I'll Yeah. Yeah. You Do that. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna surf. I'm see if I'm on track. Yeah. I think we need to get this solved. And I mean this, because now I feel like it's dangerous. Are you really throwing up in the mornings? Oh yeah. Oh, buddy. Come on blood.


That's not good. Yeah. Oh, that, that's not good. Well, then stuff's going on. It's like indigestion. It's a whole thing. And McCone knows my pillows have blood on them when I wake up. Yeah. McCone, you're not voicing this to us ever. You're not going, Hey guys, I think you should know this. Both for the sake of health and comedy. I mean, I feel like everybody who's like 10 years older than me, I'm like, oh, they got it somewhat figured Out. No, they don't. They don't. No. No, they Don't. They got it. No, there is no such thing. I did Love all the music we made together though, with the piano and your singing and the trumpet was so Fun. I'm gonna say it right now, dude. I told you backstage say it, and I don't know if you really took this to heart, but I mean this, I said, man, it's incredible when you are freestyling on the piano and she's backing you up and just flowing with it.


I'm, it's extremely impressive. Maybe I'm a fucking underexposed person to that kind of style of music, but it fucking blew my mind. Every night I would sit down when you would freestyle on the piano and you would just smooth come in. I was, I'm gen. I'm being so genuine to you guys. It's so impressive to me. And maybe I'm don't know shit about music composing and com composition in theory. But it fucking was incredible. I'm not kidding. The basic Chords. Really. Sure. Yeah. I maybe, but it was fucking gorgeous. I do also have to say that the shows versus the shows we did in America, Europe a couple years ago were way tighter Over there. We were much tighter. Well, we had 60 cities of practice. I mean, we, We found a groove.


We found a definitely groove with all of it. It just fee seems faster. It was smooth and smoother. And we'd had some incredible people, fans to help out in the show. We had a woman who was able to squirt breast milk out of her mouth into My mouth, Out of her tit into your mouth. Her mouth would crazy. Well, crazy. And spit it like Milk Coming out. She's squirted. Breast milk. Breast milk into your milk. And it's sour. It doesn't taste like oat milk or Right. Well, Of course. What do You mean? Yes. It does not taste like oat milk. Yeah. Or, Or any milk that I've ever had. Right. 'cause it was like sour. It was a human milk. Oh, it's human milk. Yeah, human milk. And let's see it right here. Let's play a clip there. Oh God. Oh my God.


So much more than I remember. That's insane, dude. Wow. Wow, wow, Wow. That's all breast milk. That's all breast milk. Man. Those babies are not gonna go hungry. That is So much. That's a lot. And can I say something too? Probably one of the best breasts I've ever seen. Gorgeous. You saw 'em, right? Yeah. I snuck Back. I mean, they Were a perfect breast. And her husband approved. We asked her. Yeah, exactly. We said, we said, she goes, my talent is that I can squirt breast milk very far. And that's us asking her husband. I'm saying, dude, do you, was this cool? Do you approve? And he was thumbs up all day. What show is that? The show that Dakota was at? It was that. Was that, yeah, that was In, oh, that was a magical show show. That's a magical show. Then Sarah Snook, Jake, Lacey Dakota. Oh, Jake Lacey from White Lotus.


White Lotus. And I'm dying up here. I'm dying up here. That's how We met. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Sarah Snook, who is Secession, Such an incredible actress. I walked up to her and I, I just kind of grabbed her L Arms. Yeah. And I'm Such a Big fit of her. I have such a crush on her talent wise. You know what I mean? Like, I think she's so talented. I'm like, God, you're fucking, I know. I love And Dakota. Dakota. Oh my God. She's the shit. She's so not what you think. Well, 'cause she's, you know what, what's funny is when you grow up in LA and you meet people that grew up in LA that are like actors that grew up here. Yeah. I guess it's more you have a projection of an idea of who you think they are. You do. Because you meet some kids that grew up here and they act and it's a thing. And you know, even though she moved here as a young kid, she kind of grew up here.


But you See a lot of young actors that I, 'cause I know a lot that they play by the Hollywood rules. Right. So they don't wanna say the wrong thing or they want, they're just very like in the middle about things. Right. Political. Political. Yeah. She seemed to be, she reminded me more of a comic. She floats her own way. Yeah. She's Like, cool. Like, just doesn't give a fuck. Like, can accept. Yeah. She loved the show. Yeah. The show was wild. It's Really nice to see. Yeah. It was wild. People feel free and not feel like Yeah. Because our show is fucking insane. Like, you know, Sarah brought their 14-year-old son and when they came backstage, I was like, do you want him to see this show? Yeah. And she was like, yeah, I mean, why not? Who cares? And they Just saw Neil deGrasse Tyson play there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. We played the same venue as Rocket scientists Deal.


Rocket scientists. I said, and we're sucking on tit milk. Yeah. Yeah. Rock and roll, dude. Incredible. Rock and fucking and roll. Yeah. It was a great trip Overall. What a great, yeah, the whole trip was good. There's only one part of it I didn't like. Tell me. There's only one part of it I didn't like. Tell me. You know what it was McCone? Yeah. Yeah. Did you make me mad? The whole, the whole show? Did you, did I, was I mad at you a little bit? I was, what? What was the anger about? I forgot. I can tell you exactly what it is, because it's a little bit of jealousy is what it was. Okay, go ahead. We played the clip on here of you walking out to Sydney to all those fans. Right? Oh, I Knew it as soon as I saw Bobby Post that I knew this was No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not mad at Bobby. I said to him, did you get us all coming out to the fucking Crowd?


But wait, he didn't get you coming out. No, no, No, no, No. There's gotta that, that doesn't make it. He does not. And you were Re-watching it all day on your Instagram. And I just knew that you were, I was, I wasn't upset at you. I was. I said to him, did you get everybody getting that shot? I got all Of us going out. Is that what I asked you? I said, did you get me or Jesse going on stage to the big crowd? I don't wanna, I don't wanna fight you, Andrew. What Can I side with McComb for a second? Interesting. Interesting, interesting. Interesting. Someone's trying to get under Mr. Noal tutelage. Huh?


What? Someone's trying to be Mr. Hoad all for the show. I mean, just, just a little thing. What is it? I did go up to him before the show and I go, make sure you get me coming out. Interesting. Okay. That, that has no bearing. That he would literally go, I should probably get everybody coming out. Yeah. That Yeah. But that doesn't mean, yeah, you're right. That doesn't make It's 8,500 seats. Yeah, you're right. You might. Yes. Yeah. You Assume If, if one of us said, Hey, make sure you get this shot. Why wouldn't your instinct go, I should get this for Jess? Because You were already on stage Cor Correct. At that moment. So he couldn't go back and play. I was also running. No, no, no. He asked him before the show. Oh, I thought it was like, No, no, no. And I was running Up to run the cameras to get the back of everyone going.


'cause I have running second camera As well. I, I don't, it's over to me. And that will always lay inside of me as something that you disappointed me at. And it turned me, mm. I was extremely upset. Mm. I went into my hotel room and I said, not happy. Doesn't care. It is, it Doesn't care. Almost the Dollywood moment that day. Pretty Close. That wasn't why I was feeling that way. But that, that, that Dollywood moment almost happened again. Yeah. I had a day That was scary. I needed to go. I kept wanting to hang out with you So Bad. But I knew it would be best to just sleep alone. Had to go to the gym. I had to just walk away. But McCone was a big sliver, a big sliver in my hand. Ow, how do I get this out? Right. Can't I Do have to say my relationship with McCone got better on the trip?


Because, because of that. No, not because of that. I feel like he was trying to, she was trying. Yeah. I will say he got, He was trying Got, oh, you're welcome. Every one of my said, excuse Me, that's me. That's all me. I know what I is doing. That's all me molding and shaping the Kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what is.

You stayed back and caught up. Check. Let's talk about the best hotels you think we stayed at. I think the coolest one we stayed at was the W In the W was good.


Brisbane. In Brisbane. In Brisbane. Yeah. That hotel was wildly dope. But also my second was the Ritz Carlton the last night of, Yeah. Was it Perth? What night? Perth? Yeah. Yeah. Perth. Oh, The Crown. The Crown, I mean, yeah. The crown. Yeah, the crown. Well, We had Nobu that night. Incredible. Incredible. A little Nobu dinner. Yeah. And the kid never kids. Kids never had Nobu.

Gimme the time. He Probably has it on camera. He's on timestamp. I'll pull it up. That dinner was amazing. I love the lazy Susan Love Just spin the fooder around. Love of the lazy Susan Love a good lazy Susan.


And we had ano, we had overall man, every city did what we thought they were gonna do. Nobody let us down. Every city was amazing. Every venue was great. And let's be honest, can we be honest? We thought one of the cities, you, we both were like, what if this isn't that good because of the venue? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And it turned out to be fucking great. Which, Oh yeah, that one. We Were both Oh, I walked into that. Walked out. I went, oh, here's another Memphis. Yeah, you did say that for me. You thought it was Here's another Memphis, Tennessee tank. Yeah. But it wasn't, that show was amazing. Incredible. Amazing. Amazing. One of the best shows I think Did Yeah. Yeah. Saved the Trip. I had a panic attack that day and was At Brisbane.


Adelaide. Adelaide. Oh, wait, tell that story. Yeah. On The plane. I had a panic attack and I was trying to like hold it together until I got to the hotel room so no one would know. And right at the end, or, well, when I got to the baggage claim, Andr, Bobby was like, go get me some donuts. So I'm like still trying to like hold my breathing together and I'm ordering these donuts and the lady's taking forever and shrimp's like, come on, you gotta go. I'm sorry. No, you didn't know. And so I get the donuts and I get on the, the thing. And right when we park, Bobby's like, what's going on with you? And I was like, I think I'm having a panic attack. Yeah, you were having a panic attack. And then he starts yelling to everyone. She's having a panic attack. I was like, you're making it Worse. Well then I went back there and I go, are you really having a panic attack? Yeah. I didn't know if he was joking. And then you were just, I just Got to my hotel and like tried to control my breathing, took a shower and like calmed down.


I Felt So Bad. Yeah. And then the show was like transformative. 'cause it was like all, I just could focus all my thinking just on the show. Right. And perform and, and yeah. That venue was great. And yeah. Well, since we're being honest. Yeah. Since this is the honest show. Yeah. When you get low, you get low. When I get low. Mm. That's what I said. I thought it could have been a royal, when people get low, they get low. Oh, right, right. No, when you get low, we, we can feel it. Yeah. Right. And there's always like a 12 hour period where it's like, we just know not to. Yeah. But what happens to your mind there? Well, I have clinical depression, so I go into a deep, very dark low hole.


Yeah. It's, I Disappear. It's scary. Yeah. I get really, I feel So Bad for you. Well, thank you. No, I'm being real. No, I I'm always like going this. Oh my God. I mean, I can't imagine. Yeah. I wanna get you out of it. I We try to get you out it, but then we don't even, we don't say anything. I, I think I, I don't think I said to you anything to you that day. No, you didn't. Yeah. Yeah. But I, I would walk by your green room and just, Hey, If I'm being honest, if we want to talk real shit. Yeah. Yeah. I get fucking, I have, I have, I have depression. I get extremely dark and low. I think the worst negative thoughts. I'm sure there's fans that have exactly what I have or, you know, they do this thing. And I found my only solution is to not communicate with people.


'cause I just feel like I'll be mean or rude. And sometimes I am that I just get snappy 'cause I'm really low. And I apologize if I am. And I find that if I can go and exercise or just break away for a second and just kind of do my own little thing, it helps me reset my bearings and then I can get back to it. And I've done it a few times with you guys, but that's just unfortunately, I think it's a part of my chemicals. Yeah. I think it's a part of my fucking unfortunate DNA I'm born with this awful, you know, I don't even know how to describe it. It's awful. It sucks. I'm not proud of it. I'm not. But it also is who I really am. So I'd think if I service myself and I leave people alone, I can, I can figure it out.


I found the tools for me to go. Okay. And you know what? Help me shout out to, I'll tell you this. Shout out to the guy I met in the gym. I didn't wanna fucking talk to you. I absolutely didn't wanna talk to you. I was lifting weights. I had headphones in and he approached me multiple times to talk. And I was being a little mean, at first I was doing, I was like, what's up? I did that. Oh, I've done that. Like, what, what, what, what? And then as soon as I dropped my internal guard, I thought, this guy's just a nice guy asking an a question. And then I shout out to that guy. For some reason it helped me like get back to where I needed to go. 'cause I knew this was a test. I don't know what you believe in. I, I don't care if you believe in a God or a not or a universal energy.


Mm. This was 100% a test from the universe going watch this. I was in the gym alone and it was like, watch this. Mm. And it put this guy in front of me and it was like, you can either fucking be a fucking grump and be bummed and ruin someone else's part of the tour, the other people you're performing. Or you can take this guy as our little fucking tool. And honestly, I felt great after that. Like, I, it's something in the universe gave me that guy. I believe that to be like, look at this happy, happy-go-lucky sweet guy who just wanted to talk, chat, didn't know me, had no like, it wasn't like a fan. It was like just a guy wanting to chat about something. And I don't know. I wholeheartedly believe the universe was like, deal with this because you gotta cut it out. And then it did it like re-triggered my, I gotta be good for the other people on the show.


It's not fair. It's not fair to your friends and performers and people who support you to bring your shit on other people.

waiting team for team Saying, what is this clip that you wanna play? This is, this Is just Bobby throwing a sig back at Carlos After you threw one at him first. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So you threw one then he just retaliated. But that seems fair. I For an eye smoke for a smoke leaves Everyone blind. Yeah. Like the good old days. There's a resent. You know, your behavior, you keep there is there is something there. There has to be something there. I Think he loves you, but the bad breath is like, like venom. Like it's taking over. Maybe that's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's not, the bad breath has something To do with it. It's not him. It's morphing into its own thing. Yeah. It's beco. It's, it's, it's like actualizing. Yeah. It's becoming its own because he's Changing, right? Oh, a hundred percent.


Carlos has the, the change is there. I see it. It's the responsibility y'all gave me. So we gave you too much. No, Just the right amount for me to grow. Interesting. I will say this, we had a little talk off camera. People don't know we're working on right now. We looked up our analytics. We, I think are going to play a show in jolly Old England. We're working on going to London for a show because our fans in the UK have said, why don't you guys come to us? The first country we went to outside the US was, well, Canada, but Canada. We went to Australia and I think we owe, we owe it to our Australian London friends, Our London, our Londoner friends.


So we're working on that right now. So, wait, can we do this? Yeah. Make a whole vacation out of it. No, I know, I know. But the problem with Australia trip is, is that we, there was just too much traveling. I mean, what I would want is to be in Sydney for two or three extra days. Two days. So we can travel around. I know. It's, we lose money that way. Mm. No, that's fine. You mean London go? So when we go to London, no, When we go to London, I don't wanna be like flying in and flying out. I wanna, I spent two or three days. I wanna go to the Emirates and look at Our, I was just gonna ask if we go there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I say something about you? Yeah. She saw the Champions League game to the, did you see it over the highlight? I watched the Whole thing. It started at noon. I put it on my big TV and just watch skate. Wow. Because that's the best way I can learn the players. Yeah. Is by watching them.


And so I know. What do you mean? Same thing. I would love a bond with you. I know. I know. This is your, I love it. So Let me ask you something about our bond, right? Yeah. You saw, did you, do you love the team or I love the Why. I became an arsenal. Why Though? Why Do you think? Well, it started to bond with Bobby. Why do you think it is that she likes to Why? Because of my passion. Yeah. So that's where it Started. That's where it started. Started. And it Starts with she wants your love. So she loves what you love. Well, let's face it, we don't, we love each other, but we don't have a lot to talk about. Mm. We went to a dinner together and they took our phones away and it was kind of hard for us. That was a great day though. Hard for the, It was great. Oh, so, so, but we ran out of this.


You were Matt. Okay. Can we talk about that Day? It took away your phone and you were at dinner without a phone. Yeah. Yeah. I've never seen that in my entire, I'm not kidding. In the 20 years I've known you, I've never seen you at a meal. Not on your phone. Yeah. And if I liked Arsenal, then it would've been way different. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. So here's what happened. That's right. Okay. We were gonna go eat, go. And then you go, I don't want to have lunch. You said you guys go get lunch. You said you guys will go, go Get lunch. Verbatim. But then you were mad that we had lunch without you because you Went to a fucking five star restaurant. Well, yeah. If I knew you were gonna Michelin, I thought you were just gonna grab a snack like we've been doing. I didn't think you were gonna go to a fucking sit down Michelin restaurant. I thought, Hey, grab lunch. We'll all just grab lunch and then we'll have a nice dinner. But it was Discovery. So we Yeah, we, we looked, looked and look.


Couldn't We looked and looked and looked. And then we found this place. And then, oh, we Stumbled into a Michelin restaurant. Literally we did. Yeah. Basically was what we walked by. It. It we did. Because there's no sign. There Was no sign. It was like It was stumbled into a Michelin restaurant. Yes. Yeah. So then I go, no, we Googled it. There It is. Yeah. We it. Oh Shit. Actually, literally, he, I was looking for restaurants and he goes, no, no, no, no. Just type in expensive restaurants. Correct. And then, then we found One. So there was a, so we walk by and then, and then, and then, and you go, I don't think we, it's here. I think it's gone. Yeah. I go, I think you know that fancy door that the stairs going.

And we sat there and then we didn't, did we talk, we talked about Comedy and like the state of comedy, but like, that could only last so long. Yeah. But Yeah, at the, I, we went into this store in Perth that was a, a sports vintage store, and there was some arsenal.


Oh, that's how I, so yeah. And I saw one that I really liked that was like, my fit. But I was like, I'm such a poser. If I wear this, I go, will you teach me about arsenals? That weird. Wow. And he said, are you serious? Yeah. And then so we, I educated her and she memorized a bunch of things. And now you can wear the jacket. I think. I think I, I'm close. I think you can wear the, I think you can wear the jacket. I really like them. It's 'cause it's like I get super into certain shows. Like Mr. Robot, Why? Wait, wait. Why are you guys laughing? No, it's cute. Why? Because it's Sweet. There's something else. Look at Carlos. I don't, I'm, yeah. I just thought it was nice.

I don't see how it's like basketball and American football together. No. I like, just 'cause it Moves so fast. Yeah. But I like, I like fast paced scoring. Like, you like basketball. Basketball's the best. It's fast-paced scoring. Yeah. But they're bouncing around the field. It's Whoa, whoa. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. Yeah. That sounded, Yeah. Yeah. Little. What?

There's a women's Department. Yeah. There's a, there's a sec. There's a section. It's like men and women. You Would go in your own section. Yeah. What is it? Like? Walk me through it because I can't, I have no idea what it Is. Can I ask you something? Yeah. I'm not trying to start anything at all. Yeah. Are there, are there trans people in the saunas and stuff? No. Okay. Well, there was a con That's a real, there was. So there was a controversy. Now you're, we spot. Do you know the controversy? No. So Wipo isn't, see, that's, see what you, that photo right there, they give you clothes.


And so there's a, like a, you know, a co-ed area of the spa. But there's no nudity. There's no nudity where there's like a clay room, a salt room. And then we're fully closed with other people. Right. And you steam out there and do your thing there. You can meditate, you can, there's yoga. And there's a women's department too. Right. Anyway, the controversy was, if you go to Wiba, there's kids Sure. Running around. You know, there's like a lot of, like, in my, my section, little boys running around. Not late at night, but Yes. Even late at night sometimes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Even late at night, you'll see like a Korean kick on. You know what I mean? Right. And you're trying to like, you know, maybe be cool, you know, but you know what I mean?


Yeah. You gotta be cool. That'd be cool, man. So A, a couple years ago, a a, a man, a, a woman, A trans, a trans Woman. A trans woman, right. Who hasn't had the procedure Sure. Went to the women's department and there's little girls there. Right. I think that's what happened, right? Reed? And then it's right here. Yeah. And then there was protests. 'cause they kicked up the, the guy out, the girl out. A trans woman with presence of a nude individual with a penis, most commonly to believe as a trans woman. The women's changing area of the spa. The video went viral, attracting significant attention from gender critical feminists also termed trans exclusionary. Oh, turfs. Right. And some media, which led to protests and counter protests. Some media outlets initially questioned whether or not the alleged incident had been a hoax.


They reported, again, the transgender woman was charged with indecent exposure relating to the alleged incident after four women. And one minor girl filed police reports in July. Suspect is awaiting trial on seven counts of exposure. And finally, judge ruled that the indecent exposure case could proceed. Citing the testimony. Two witnesses in the individual in question had partial or full erection for a duration of 30 to 60 minutes during the incident. That, that, that's, that's a bummer. It's a bummer to have a boner. But that spa is phenomenal. I mean, if I could walk around there hard, I would Yeah. Imagine taking a fucking BLUECHEW then going to Wi Spa. But it's also A cultural thing. It's a, it's a Korean establishment. Right? That's right. What? Yeah.


Yes. And they're like, you know, it's, it could just a different culture. And it was just like, what else are they gonna do? You're saying they, you're saying they're just in their, in their removal of the, There's, I mean, 'cause I know that there's always little girls and little boys. Right. I'm talking about five, 6-year-old kids running around. Right. And it's just a part of Korean culture to bring your kids to a spa. It's like, you know. Yeah. And I would do it if I was a father. And I don't know. I just think that it's inappropriate. It's, it's hard for your kid to see someone else's penis. This kid only sees my penis. My kid sees my penis. Yeah. But they're little girls. Right. So I know he's in the women's department. I know. You know what I mean? Do you remember the first time you saw your dad's penis, by the way?


When I saw it or sucked it. Okay. You should just did. I remember, I remember the moment. I see my dad's penis. I mean, what a bummer. I almost grew up in a nudist colony. Did I ever tell you guys that? What Did I, you almost did. So You didn't, yeah. Well, no. My dad wanted to take me to a nudist colony. And my mom was like, I don't want the first penis. She seems to be a, your penis. How Old were you? I Don't even remember it, but it had to have been after they were divorced. So probably around six to eight, seven. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. A nudist colony. Yeah. Different life. Are there any nudist colonies in Southern California? Welcome to Southern California's premier family Nudist Resort and RV Park.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Look at they got the first shoe in Africa on there, on the, between 30,000 and 120,000 years ago. Oh. Just a small gap Between 30,000. I know. Wow. And 120,000 years ago, early clothing was made from animal skins and fur and leaves and grass and wrapped, draped tied around the body. Clothing changed with wealth. I mean, I just think like, you know, there was a point when nudity in the summer was chill and somebody didn't like it. Some small dick weirdo was like, we, we should cover up. That's so funny. That's probably exactly how it Happened. You know what I mean? Yeah. Some small dick loser in the community was like, I don't like to see other guys penises. It's gross. And everybody's like, what are you talking about? Yeah. Whatcha talking about? Yeah. Everyone has their penis out. Yeah.
