And he said in the, you know, what he said in it that was so powerful that really moved me in a way. Two things. He goes, he was crying and Ian said, Mr.


Pigg said it meant more to him that Ian Wright played for the country of England than when he flew over Buckingham Palace. That was more important to him, that someone he coached Wow. Played for England. Wow. And then he said he turned to hug him, and he was like, two steps down. They're in the stadium, they're up in the stairs. And when he hugged him, he was below Mr. Den. You know, like he was, he was hugging his waist almost. 'cause he I saw that. I saw, yeah. And he goes, and I felt like I was seven years old again. I was a young child being embraced by someone. A father figure. Wow. Dude. I was, I, it gets me. Wow. Every time. Every time. Every time. But when whites, Oh, what about the whites?


What about the whites? What do you mean? What about the whites? There's so many good things to say about the whites. Not lately, dude. I know lately. As of as of not know. You know what I mean? But you know what I'm saying is over the history. Yeah. You guys get a bad rap. We Do get a bad rap. Yeah. Yeah. And what I'm gonna say is, you know what I mean? Thank you Dave. You guys done extraordinary humanitarian. You know what I mean? Deeds. Some of us, some Of you Schindler. We've talked about that before. What? A list. That's it. Schindler and Ian Wright's coach. Mr. Pigment. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mr. Pigment. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. No, but what I'm saying is, is when, when it's, it's human. All humans have someone, I'm sure there's a Korean out there like that.


Gotta be somewhere. What do you think? I don't know where they are. Like A One Good Korean that like helped out. That's a great movie. One Good Korean. Oh, Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Speaking of it, did you see the guy that snuck into North Korea took video of the traffic cop with his phone? Did you see this? No, I didn't see it. By the way, they're gonna get this guy. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I think about these guys. You're off your head. They're gonna get you, dude. They're gonna come find you and kill You. Did he go back to South Korea then? They can't find him? No, no, No. He left North Korea and went somewhere else. Look at, I don't know where it is. It was on TikTok this week. How do We take him out? How do we take 'em out? Kim Jong Ill un Do you wanna take 'em out? I do. See, here's my thing. 'cause that, that whole, there's millions of people that live there and they're in poverty, and it's like, they still believe that we're getting ready for the war with the us.


We don't think about you ever. You say that until they start some shit. What if they start some shit? They Can't. Like, how Says who. But With like Russia, they could in China, but them alone, they're Like, what did you just say with Russia and China? They could, oh yeah. But I thought so what are you talking about? Of course they can. I Think that just them, it'd like No one. Yeah. But Russia and China give them no one Acts alone other than Germany. And look how that turned out. So now the axis of evil could reunite and start another war. And why wouldn't they? Honestly, why wouldn't they? The time is now. It'd Be Awesome. We're they're ready. I'm ready to go. Go dude, let's go blow this whole thing up. Lemme ask you something. I want post apocalyptic Shit.


If there's, if there's a World War III. Yeah. And you and I were called in, there's a draft and we go, we need everybody. Everybody. Yeah. Even Carlos. Even Carlos and McCone. Yeah. Yeah. But he is at hold duty. Those guys are inside. Yeah. No, I Mean, no, he's glory hold. Glory hold duty. Oh, I see. Just sucking off the soldiers before they No, no, no, no. I'm just saying that he, you find like, if we're in, like, you know. Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know how we're fighting in Hong Kong, right? Yeah. And then the sergeant goes find the glory halls. Yeah. He knows where they are. Yeah. That's like Working. But we don't put dicks in. We put bombs in there. Oh, that's, they Explosive. I was gonna say, like Notre Dame football, they slap a sign that says play like a champion. As they go out onto the field, they all smack it.


It's funny, if every soldier before they go to war, they just get to stick their cock and Carlos' mouth. He's just standing next to, he's like, go Ahead, play. Anyway, if you would you, would you be in the same platoon as me? I don't think they would put us in the same platoon. Would you think there's an Asian? No. Whatcha talking about? Oh, just no, no. No. Strength and skill. Strength and skill. Strength and skill. No. No. Dude, are you pissed me off today? Dude, Am I, I'm just, No, I, I would call my agents. No, dude, you'd never get in this. We'd never get in the same category. That's crazy. No. The Platos are all, they're like, this is the No, they have a mix. Have you seen? No. Shut the fuck up. Have you ever seen Si saving Private Ryan? There's a mixture of different people. You know what I mean? Of it. There's the one guy that's scared.


Like, you know, you know, like the fucking in saving Prime Ryan, the guy that plays the interpreter, even though I don't know Chinese. Yeah, You'd be the interpreter. Yeah. But I'm just saying, I, there's gotta be something that I can do. I'm the Dennis Hopper character. Like the eccentric, you know what I mean? Yeah, man. You know what I mean? War is globalization, whatever. I don't know. I say things, you know what I mean? I don't know. What Do you think? I know you'd be, you'd be one of the luna, one of the crazy boys in the bunch. Yeah. But Why would you not push for that? I wouldn't want, There's no way that I could, I wouldn't want you in my platoon. But then the whole time I'm at war, I'm like, you know what I mean? What's Andrew doing? I have to write you letters. I'd be missing you. That'd be so much fun. We'd, I'd see you from afar also, if we're in the same platoon, think about that. Then I'm gonna see, we're gonna see each other die.


I'd rather sit in a tent at night hoping that you're well writing you letters like a long lost love affair. Mm. On the other side of the battle. Mm. And I wanna find out that you die from someone that goes soldier. No, no, no. The dumpling was killed at 4 35. I would've called me the dumpling. Yes, they would. They Wouldn't call me. No. They all Get nicknames in the Army. That's what you fucking get. Everybody gets a Nickname. If somebody called me dumpling, I would pull them a, like, can you change that? And they'd be like, you got it chopstick. You got a chopstick. I wanna Be chopstick. Yeah. Okay. So, so you're funny. Dude. The Chinese Cho died at 4:44 AM Sir, Let me say something. He, He was Korean. Right? What does a, when when a soldier at war and they get shunned into them, that they know they're gonna die.


Yeah. What is the one person they call out for? God No. No. Their mom. Mm. Mom, mommy. Remember Giovanna esi? Oh my God. Heartbreaking. Can you imagine? You call your mom, she's on an iPad. She's like, leave me alone. Yeah. Well, what I'm saying is I would call out for you, Andrew. You go, mom, Andrew, Andrew, And I'd come running You. Right. Morphine, morphine. Bob. Bob. That's what I want you there. All right. I'll be there with you. I, you know what? You know what the Fuck you, I, I don't wanna be in a Plato with you. I just said Yes. I just, Carlos, you wanna be to same platoon? Hell yeah. No fucking way. Is he gonna get in there? Dude, he's never gonna pass any of the tests. Oh, yeah. No.


We're in a situation where They're never easy, dude. They're gonna take his blood and be like, this kid out. It's a long war. Or it's a, where when they went 18 to 35, right now they're at a, you know, okay. I'm, I'm, I'm give you a Lord of the Rings. A lord of the Rings reference, right? Yeah. In the two towers. Right. They gave old men and kids swords to fight. Right. We're in dire straits. So we're in a position where we're all being called in. Okay. If they ran outta 18 to 30 fives, they're done. Now they need 40 and ups. Yes. That's what I'm saying. So you get 40 and up. Yeah. So at that point, right, I would call, write a letter to Congress and go, can I be in the same platoon as Car Georgia out?


You wanna be in it? Nah. If I'm, I'm fine. I'm fine fighting from home. You, you know, he's, he's fleeing the country. Oh, he's a Canada A hundred dude. Well, not where, Wherever. He's one of those. No, he's one of those Canada. Canadian. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Or Mexico. You know, you could see him in Mexico And he is like, you know, wearing tie dye. Right. You know what I mean? Just with a bandana, you know what I mean? Like this. And it's like, shut the fuck up. You coward. Shut up. Coward. Dude. You piece Of shit. Yeah. Yeah. So you call Crystals and Oh my God. You imagine this guy, dude, in the sixties, dude, you were one of those guys. Patchouli boy. Yeah. Patchouli boys of little, no, my dad Pulled the Adventist card to, for, to get out of Vietnam. Your dad did? Yeah. Sk he said, said religious reasons can't fight. So then he was, he went and just got medical tested on for War.


What, what was the It was the White coats. What was the religion? Seventh Adventist. Adventist. Adventist. Adventist and Adventist. Do you know these? No. Lemme ask you something. That thing that Trump, like, is there flatfoot? Oh, Protestant Christian domination. Flat feet. Yeah. Flat feet. Well, for that. But that's, that's back in the day. That was like back. So, You know what I would to get out? Just give you Dr. Shool. I wouldn't get flat feet. Huh? I, I would claim flat face fra feet. Dude, I would claim flat face. Could I get out? You think, your honor? Dude, I got flat face guys. My friend has flat face. Alright. He's just not aerodynamic. Yeah. Not Aerodynamic. Yeah. The wind is just gonna bounce right off of this guy. Yeah. Yeah. Although I could like camouflage myself on a wall like Ramo.


Yeah. Dude, I imagine me. You just blend it, dude. Bricks on me. Right. And I could just stay there. I would stay there for two weeks like this. I wouldn't even, you know, with a knife. I wouldn't even do that. I would just stay there. Just stay steady. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How would you camouflage Impossible. And fire impo. Yeah. Yeah. I'd, I'd have to be a fireball. Yeah. Yeah. That is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Rambo in all mud. Yeah, dude, remember that? Yeah. That's what I would do. But I would do it with actual brick wall. Smart. And they would not see me. How Could they? Yeah. Yeah. I saw some of the, something was showing out all like the tricks of the tunnels in Vietnam that the Vietnamese would dig. And they were super intricate, dude. And how they would try to trick them to get them in or out. But what they would do is they'd try to like, flood them out.


A cchu choo chi tunnel. Tunnel. Yeah. But look at the tunnel system that they had. And they would flood them out with water and bombs and all sorts of shit. But then the Vietnamese had counteractive shit for the weapons that the Americans would use. So the things that they would have, they would, like, if it was a rope or a pole, they would pull on the pole and it would get caught in a machine. So then it would pull the soldier in with it while they were down there. Yeah. And they would have rotating spikes and shit. Or they would, could they'd have, they'd have to crawl in backwards or like upside down. Mm. Because it was head first and they would fucking drown them upside down and backwards. Imagine I'd be so close claustrophobic. Oh, dude, dude. If I forget it, I had an MRI yesterday. I was claustrophobic.


Yeah. I was fucking freaking out in the, I hate the machine. And those, and all that you hear is like blood. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 1. And ho chi min is the best trail maker. Top trail, Don't you think? Look at that girl. I'm on vacation. She's on vacation. Oh, You know what? It actually looks pretty solid though. I mean, yeah. Structurally. It is. Structurally. Yeah. Yeah. Then I would just be worried about fire or, you know what I mean? Mm. Something trapping you down there. Look at that thing. That's Insane. Don't narrow that. That's so crazy. They Created an entire network. They could like hang out. Yeah. They had, they could sleep for days and days in those things and just hide out. We've never had like a like, have aside from like the British back in the day, you know what I mean? Yeah. We've never had like a country attack us. You know what I mean? I wonder what, like a Nine 11.


What do you mean? We had the fucking nine 11. Yeah. But not even in a traditional like war where, where there's like troops and, you know what I mean? And Yeah. On our soil. On our soil. Yeah. We haven't had war on our soil. I think we would destroy people. No, they wouldn't even get to our soil. Even in LA they're like, we've got MS 13. You know, we got people. Oh, You don't, You think use what we have. Don't you think we Would've? Yeah. Go get the Crips and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Blood. Hey Bro, what the fuck, dude, you pa whatever the, you know, fuck A Palestinian bro. Yeah, Palestinian bro. Yeah, yeah. Or whoever am I, what kind of Chinese are you, bro? You know what I mean? Dude, I'm me. I'm from Ralph. I'm from here. Okay, good. Move over, man. Yeah. But how, who would they fight for? That's what's interesting. Who, who would these gangs fight for?


Well, if you are fighting, if we were in a war with Mexico, but we don't get the MS 13 Don, we're Never gonna be in a war with Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. We Oh, destroy. No, I mean, I think we would never be in a war with America. Yeah, exactly. So those are Our, those are our dogs. But If you were in a war with Russia, I think that most of the gangs in America would be on our side. No, you say that, But like, think about it. Some of those gangs have drug ties and those drug ties. They don't want the fucking federal government telling them what to do. Mm. You're right. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They'd get, they'd get in bed with like the cartel and whatever government agencies they have power over. Mm. What a weird in la Imagine if we were like Red Dawn and we were attacked by, oh my God, it'd be insane. Where would they hit up first? I Would be so scared.


Would you be scared? Can you imagine if they're like, we're gonna bomb la and they bomb downtown. And you're like, nobody's down there. Hit the wrong, they hit the wrong part of the city first. Yeah. They're like, and then, yeah. And then we're gonna bomb North Hollywood. You're like, yeah. No one, no ones, no one's up there. Yeah. Bombs ski roll. They're, they, you won't kill them. Oh, they're like zombie. No, Those are no, they're, they're undefeated. Yeah, they're undefeated. What does that say? Is that Newsweek thinks they're gonna, that's where the centrifuge of war would be. Oh, In you're talking This is a nuclear bomb. Nuclear bomb. Oh my God. Forget it. What happened? But it wouldn't even hit Santa Monica. The, Oh, west side safe. West side. West side. Yeah. But That we are fucked where we live. No, dude, we're just, yeah. No. Yeah. We're fucked. That's all. We're in the fucking, yeah, we're in the center of it.


Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hell, Whatcha gonna do? No, no. Don't you think that, that, because we're on the other side of the hill, you don't think the hill would protect us a little Bit? Some of it, I think the hill would, would get some of like the, the radiation fog and smoke. But I think we'd still, we'd get a bad leg. I'm In the yellow. Yeah, you're in the dark. Oh, You're done. You're done. Yeah. Yeah. You're in Los Fila or, or Silver Lake Los Fli. I think I'd become a shadow. Yes. Which Is awesome. You'd be Yeah. Shadow a. Yeah. You would do a Carlo shadow. Yeah. Ca Carlo shadow. It's just interesting. And his mouth is like this. Y yeah. Wow. That would, that would be, I mean, that was, that would be the way to, you know, I mean, destroy us bomb. But that's what it says. Nuclear bomb shows the impact of new gravity weapon of the biggest US cities.


Wow. Wow. That's scary. Let's hope that doesn't happen. Let's hope it doesn't happen. Or I'm on the road. Yeah. I wanna be gone. Yeah. I've always imagined that, like, if I was on the road and I was sudden LA's taken out, like, Oh, well, no, I got two more sets tonight. So I gotta, It would be terrible. I mean, imagine, dude, They wouldn't hit LA first, though. You would? No. Who would you worry about? You're on the road. Yeah. My, well, my wife and my dog. That's number one. This studio you guys actually Yeah. You first. Okay. Well, you'd be on the road too. Yeah, I'd be on the road. And then what would you do? Like if I was, you were in Cleveland and I was like in Denver or whatever, vice versa, however, whatever you wanna say. Sure. And then, and we would be mourning. 'cause you know, I would lose so many people. You would lo lose so many people.


Right. And then our cell phone still worked. And then we, well, you think in a day we would call each other or a couple of days. It Depends. I don't know. See, you know, in, who knows if we could get ahold of anybody, you know how like they have like, cell phones crash when all that stuff goes down, you know, like nine 11, no one could like call anybody and the phones are down and all that. I'm just thinking hypothetically, if like the satellites aren't down and we could call, would you? I think in the, within the first 12 hours, we would text each other A hundred percent. Yeah. Right away. Where you are you okay? You, you good? I, no, I would text you. Are you gonna sell your house? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta keep your house. And Then what would, would we, what would you do? I mean, honestly, what would you do?

If that's the end, that's the end. Yeah. I wanna go out like a fo dude. I had to do my will today, this morning. I had to do like my living will. I've done that. Oh My God. And, and you have to decide. Like, he literally was like, step by step. He's like, if you're, if you are in a tragic accident and your brain is incapacitated, right?


Like your brain, you're brain dead, essentially. How long do you wanna be alive? Ooh. How long did you Say I had to do it today? How long do you think I, I said Your brain. I'm brain dead.

Let's talk about the birth of life. Let's talk about a, a birth of life. The ancient Big Head People.


Scientists uncover a lost human in Asia with an abnormally large skull that lived alongside Homo sapiens. A hundred Thousand. They're called Asians. What are you talking about? Big Head People? Yeah.

But Is that why Koreans have such big heads? 'cause they intermingled a Little bit. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Mm. There's a, I don't know what the people were called in, in Korea or in Japan, but there was this, there's a type of people that were, they didn't look Asian, but they're mixed with Asians.


And that's why Japanese people look the way they do. It's nicotine. Okay. I'm not vaping weed at work. I Don't know, dude. We don't know anymore. We don't know anymore. We don't know. I we know. No, we know. We know. How about that? How about we know. Yeah, we know, Bro. I'm Not smoking weed at work. They are like vape. Whenever you've seen me vape, You're smoking weed outside of work though. I'm not vaping weed or anything like that. I'm not, dude, What's the truth? The truth is that, But did you take something last week? What do you mean? What do you mean? Oh, at bad. Here at work. I, dude, I'd never come to work high. I Okay. But you do it off of work. I have Yes. Yes. A little bit. Yeah. I know, but I'm not like, Because when I saw you in that alleyway a when I saw you in the alleyway, You did look stoned.


You Looked stoned. Dude, When, When I caught you in the alleyway, dude, That was a whole, Were you not high? I was not high that night. Nothing. I was embarrassed because I was with a Girl. No, dude. There's something going on. What do you mean? You Were embarrassed? You embarrassed a girl? That's No, Because no, there was a girl and a guy. Oh, right, Right. Yeah. And then they were doing some sort of trip, like some sexual three-way. And I was Did you have a threesome? No, I didn't. But I was embarrassed. Bobbylee caught me like striking out with a girl. Oh wow. Yeah. That's kind of funny. Yeah. Yeah. But, But I didn't bring, like, you've never seen me vape weed in Australia here. Ever. Never. Did You, did you hook up with the guy and not the girl? No, but he was like more in interested in like, talking to me. It was weird. What is With you?


He's, he DMed me later. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Oh Yeah. I watched this reality show This week. I only related to the gay men on it. Okay. Anyway. What's the, what's Going on here? What's it called? Mexican dynasties. I loved it. Have I seen this? Have we seen this Mexican dynasties? I heard Mexican reality show. It's so good about rich people in Mexico City. Oh, oh, Wow. Yeah. We now I have to watch that. Yeah. Because Rich Mexicans are my favorite. They're My favorite. Yeah. Yeah. Great restaurants in Mexico City. I hear, I mean, they eat at McDonald's. Is that the people What? Juman, right? Yeah. What are they Called? Juman. Joman. Joman. Joman. Joman people. Joman people. So they, they, at one point they looked like a Spanish midfield soccer player.


Okay. And then they mixed it with, you know what I mean, a regular age. Right. Right. And then it, the Japanese occurred, but at one point they looked like that. See, it's interesting when people, it is funny when the more mixing there is as time has gone on. Yeah. Like, like Tiger Woods look at his kids. He just plays playing in this thing with his son. Obviously, Lemme see what Tiger Woods looks like. But his, he's got a daughter and a son. But they, it's like, you couldn't tell what that kid is. You'd have no idea what that kid is. Oh, That kid Islander, they always look Hawaiian Pacific Islander. At the end of the day when you mix enough, they're Hawaiian. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What are you Hawaiian? You Know who's cute? Jordan Peele and Chelsea Peretti's kid. There's no photo. I did see a photo.


I mean, it was through a text or something. He was like really cute. Like handsome. Almost. That's A big thing. People now, celebrities, they put their kids up on the internet, but they cover their face with like a smiley face or like ice cream cone. Mm. It's weird. Why then, then why even have the photo itself? Do you know what I mean? Like why put up the pic if you don't wanna have your family on there, don't put 'em on there. But then why put 'em on there and then cover up their face? That seems so strange. It's like, just do it or don't do it. Mm. Do you like, I Ms. Jordan. Do you ever miss people? Yeah. I mean, I don't know him. I don't miss him because I don't know him. Yeah. Yeah. I miss, I Used hanging out with him every day for so long and then I just kind of miss him.

That was good. It just felt like the old, it felt like the old days. The old days. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so Jay called me and he and I, Or I called Jay and we both said the same thing. I was like, dude, that felt like, it used to feel when it was like, I don't know, when the store had people coming and going more and, and everyone was finally in town. That was fun. Yeah. It was great. That's a fun. Yeah. But I miss, there's some guys that I miss. No, I want to, can you be completely honest with me, because You did great last, I wasn't gonna say anything. Oh boy. But let's just get it outta the way.


When I walked in the improv and I saw you in the dark. Yeah. I got the vibe of you going get away from me. Was that true? No. You know better. No, no. I'm being real. When, When have I ever done that? You were sitting there on your phone. You look up at me, I look at you. And then you went back into your phone and I just left the room. No. That's What happened. No, I Know, but I didn't because it was quiet in the room. But if, when I see you at the store, we always say hi. What do you mean? Okay. No, I'll tell you what it really was is I was in the You're back. Yeah. I was in the middle of a little pain, little pain moment. And I was sitting there in pain until the, until the drugs kicked in.

Where are You going? Where the fuck Are you going right now? Right now? Yeah. Right now. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, there's, there's an obvious piss break, which is when the house goes up Yeah. And brings people on. That's your way out In between comics. Yeah. Yeah. Or or Yeah. Sit it out and in the middle of the set at the joke, joke, joke. And then when there's a little break between jokes, then get up and get out as fast as you can. But not when you're like in the middle of a setup. Mm. It's like right when you're starting to tell a joke and someone's like, and they get and you're like, what? Yeah. Because Then everybody goes, where, what's that guy doing?


Is he gonna Mm. Where's he headed to? In the main room, something happened where I, I told one joke that I knew that some people aren't gonna like, and then I looked to my left and these two girls were so tuned out at me.

She goes, Oh, she showed your feet. And I put Her feet in my face. Right. With two feet coming up. Right. I go, what the fuck is that? And then I just walked to the other side of the stage.

I know you do. So I, and I've talked about this before. I think, I don't know where, but, and I've had to campaign because in the late seventies, early eighties.


Yeah. There was one thing that was the greatest thing ever made. It was the greatest thing ever made. It's what I survived on. I I, if I think about it today, my mouth waters. All Right. Gimme the initials. I can guess it. You're never gonna guess it. Gimme the initials. I'll just say Carnation. Oh, instant. The instant breakfast.

If You were gonna put a hit on, on somebody, how would you go find someone to do that, though? You can't Google it. There's no way to do it. I, I, I, I've, late, late at night. I do think about stuff because, you know, late at night, you have Revenge Fantasies. You do for sure. You don't have Revenge Fantasies? Not really. I don't, I don't care. What am I, I'm, Me either. Then you love It. I know you do. So I, I lay in my bed and that always putting on a hit in my scenarios in my head. 'cause I go, how would I do it? Well, you go get a homeless guy. Even then, it's like, no, because they're gonna catch you on tape.


How Even approaching the homeless guy. Hmm. What's Bobby Lee? You know, giving a homeless guy four to four grand. I wasn't giving him that much money. Okay. I hid the money he had to go get it. So I'm at Skid Row. I got it all planned out. You do? I'm hanging out. Skid Row. Yeah. I go, that guy might go, yeah. Hey sir, can you come here? And he's like, ah, shit, I'm a fake do. And then you're like, okay, that's not the guy. The cuckoo Kado. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my guy. Right. And then so where would I go? And then I would probably go to like Guam, The guy that works this sports. Yeah. Yeah. He looks like he knows somebody. Yeah, he does. Hey God, you know anybody. I'm just, you know, hypothetical. Yeah. No, dude, what the fuck? Get the fuck away from Me. That means he does. He's like, I, right. So Then I think I would call the shadiest guy now.


Yeah. But after that, I'd be like, I don't know what to do. I'd get a homeless guy because then it's phone. You know what, if you get a crazy homeless guy? Mm. And you, and you, you hide the money. You give, you give him like two couple of tasks. One, he is gotta go kill someone. Two, I've hid the money all over the place. It's a scavenger hunt for him to get the money. Mm. Then it gives him an adventure, you know? Well, the money fi part because these clubs now pay you cash. Yeah. Right. So I would just do a bunch of improv spots. Right. Get the cash. Right. That's how I get the cash. Right. Right. There you go. So Then I have cash in my Pocket. Untraceable. I'll save about 10 grand worth of You think someone's gonna kill someone for 10 grand Down payment? You always say put a down payment down. Oh yeah. Right. Until the task's done. What does It cost to kill somebody?


You go 10 grand at first. Yeah. Okay. 20 grand. 20 grand to kill someone. Yeah. No chance. There's, it's gotta be way more than that. Someone's not gonna kill someone for 10 grand. You can hire a hitman on the dark web. Well, Or you could get a ghost gun. That's what I was gonna tell Bobbylee to do, is he should kill her himself. What's a ghost gun? Yeah. What's a gun? 3D printed gun. Wow. Oh. And you can destroy it when you're done. That's What Luigi used. Did he really? That's Why it was so weird looking. Wow. Whoa. So he printed his own gun. Oh, that's cool. But that's kind of weird. He printed his own gun but didn't cover up any other parts of his tracks. Like, he literally was like, see that? Huh? He didn't have gloves on. He didn't check to see if he was dead. It Was, yeah. So it's like he left all the other evidence. He like went out of his way to get a 3D gun, but he Also got a silencer.


And apparently that was the wrong move. Why? Oh, you don't know Why. Wait, why? Because, Oh, you don't? Oh, You don't know. No. You don't know. No. I, okay. So what professional would say right, is you make it loud because, so that people can hear it. And they don't run toward gun violence. They run away from it. And they duck and they hide. Ah. Right. So if you would, that's good. What? That's good. Yeah. So you use a regular pop pop pow right that way, right? Mm. There's no one around. Interesting. Right. But he and, and the cop that I heard on the news Yeah. News News cop. They said, they said that he played too many video games.


Like kids today, they play so many video. They think that's how you do it. Oh, they put a silencer and all that stuff. Like you playing? No, just subsonic bullets right in the ear. You're good to go.
