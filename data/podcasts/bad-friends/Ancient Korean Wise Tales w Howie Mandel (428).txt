It gets like, It's a Surprise. It's, yeah. It's, that was a whistle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a whistle. So what, what was that all about? Guy Billy Corrigan came on my show and told the story that he'd never told before. I, it wasn't even a bit that I planned. Yeah, yeah. The plan was, I was, Billy Corrigan was on gonna do my podcast.


And I said, You know, here's, this will be funny. I'm gonna just say that Bill Burr is doing the podcast and we will never cop to the fact that you're Billy Corrigan. And I'll, we'll talk, you'll answer questions as Bill Burr. He goes, nah, I don't want to do that, But You know, my Bill Burr story. And I said, no, I don't know you're Bill Burr story. He said, I never told it before. Can I tell it on your show? Go ahead. Tell me your Bill Burr story. So he told me that his mother or stepmother told him that there's a famous comedian who has a really good chance of being your brother. Yeah. You heard the story. I'm not gonna, I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But maybe the audience hasn't. Do You want me to tell it again? It's, that's fine. Piece. Did it It's Billy Corrigan's story. Yeah. Billy Corrigan said that his father was, but, but, but the problem is, is that was a traveler.


Yeah. Yeah. A musician who, You know, had fun. He did meet and greets. Right. You know, and he, he liked me. Didn't shake hands. He just put his music. But didn't, but I mean, it doesn't make any sense. 'cause Bill Burr and Billy Corgan both knew their dads. Right. I don't know. Individually. Did they know their dads? Like, did Bill see, they know who they, they know who they think their dad is. Yes. Oh, they never physically saw their dad then. No, they physically, just because a guy lives in your house with your mother doesn't make your dad very nice. Very good. I never thought. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Somebody steal that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But is he, is Bill Mad? Is Bill still mad? Not Corri and Burr.


Yeah. Burr's mad. Burr's. Never mad. I know he's not mad. I've Never seen Burr mad. I don't think I've ever seen Burr upset. He did. You see he internalizes it. I think he's mad.
