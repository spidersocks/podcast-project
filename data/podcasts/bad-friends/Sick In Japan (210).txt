First of all, have you ever tried to have sex when you're on opium? Have you? Yeah. It's impossible. I, I'll, how about this? I've had, I've tried to have sex on opiate opioids. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard medication. Even opioids. It's hard. You can't get hard. It's Hard. It's hard to get hard. Yeah. It's hard to get hard.

Straight from the tap. Right. From it. Right. And they're still able to go, Hey, man, I mean, get your butt over here. You know what I mean?


I would be like, oh, fuck this one. I have to Do it. Gotta do it. Yeah. Yeah. Have I saw a TikTok video the other day? There's people just posting how to make cocaine on TikTok. Do you know this? Yeah. I wouldn't Known that he put it behind different kinds of music. But there was like, guys that were, it was just like, with music, and he was just showing like the coca leaves in the barrel and all that stuff. They're Just, now cocoa leaves are different than cacao. Cacao is chocolate Leaves chocolate. Right? Yeah. Okay, good. I Try with make it Up. They're c but they're cousins. Are they Really?

We wouldn't know what to do with It. Well, they started chewing on it. That's how they found out the powers of it. They chewed on it and gave them energy. Yeah. But then Who was like, oh, this be great in a powder and up my nose? Like, who came up with that? Who Started cocaine? Yeah. Yeah. Mexicans. And how, how, Why would you think that you could do that? Like, Here's what we're saying. Right?


Albert Neiman isolated an active ingredient of co coco leaves, which he named cocaine. Well, that's like, I found out, you know how, you know how microwaves were invented? Oh, He should teach me. There was a guy who had a bar of chocolate in his pocket, and he was working near a, a, a, a radioactive, a radioactive radiator or whatever. Mm. And it melted like, 'cause he was standing next to it. And he was like, oh shit. Are You being real right now? Look it up. I thought you made that up. Look it Up. How microwave Watch the first microwave. It was a guy, he had a fucking bar of chocolate in his pocket. And he, it melted. 'cause he was too close to this radio actor or whatever that's called. I'm saying it wrong. American engineer. Percy Spencer. Spencer was working with a radar set when he noticed a candy bar in his pocket had melted. He discovered the magnetron tube and the radar set was emitting microwaves that generated heat melting the bar of chocolate in his pocket.


That's how fucking dumb we are. We find all the shit on Accident. So all Yeah. In therapy. This is so shameful. I've never shared this before. No, you have to. But I did something in third grade about the microwave. Anyway, can I, I was living in Minnesota and there was a girl that lived next to me, and there was a rumor that she put a rabbit in a microwave. Yeah. And exploded A pet rabbit. Yeah. And I, when I found the rumor, right. I was so mad. I mean, I never met a rabbit, but I was just, I just remember as a kid going, fucking, fucking explore rabbits.


Man. Can't do that. Yeah. That's fucking bullshit, man. Bad. Right? So I, I would, every time she would walk by in class, I would go Rabbit Killer. And she didn't do it. Well, but you a rumor. It Was just a rumor. Right. And one time she cried in class Because you kept calling her Rabbit Killer. Rabbit Killer. Yeah. Yeah. And then the teacher brought me on in front of the class and sat me down in the chair in front of the whole class and goes, you are short. You know what I mean? You are little. What? How does that feel like he was belittling me in front of the class because I was making, and I started to cry. Yeah. It taught, taught me a really big lesson. Here's a lesson. Even if it's a rumor, you don't say shit, dad.


Keep it to yourself. Keep it to Yourself. Also what? Also that teacher. What? We gotta get that guy We Do. Where the fuck is he? Yeah. Yeah. Belittling my friend in front of people. Did that makes you mad? That pisses me off. I wouldn't put up with that shit. Really? Leave him Alone. You would've said that in class. I would've been so mad if somebody belittled my friend in class. Oh yeah. Yeah. I I think now you can do it. I've seen TikTok videos where students talk back. The one kid is my favorite. That's like, instead of you, you ought to be Oh yeah. Oh, I love that guy. Guy. I love that kid. I love that Guy. Yeah. Yeah. Instead of Yeah. Yeah. What? He's Like, well, no, no, you make it up to me. He's Like, yeah, you, you know, you know, you know Charles, Charles. You know, I just, I You don you don't pay attention in class.

You skip a few classes. You don't remember. So, Charles Yeah. You know, I'm, you know, I'm tired of your attitude. You come to class late. Right. You don't seem to like be interested in your book work. Right. And your essays are all over the place. I mean, what is going on, pal, pal? You know, you don't really care about us as youth. You don't invest in us. You don't care about our issues and what we care about. All you wanna do is get a paycheck. And that's disappointing to me. And maybe if you showed a little bit more love to the students and cared about our world and what was important to us, maybe just, maybe we create a better environment and a better future.


That's so good. You don't even have to look that up. That was good, dude. I would never be able to do that. Yeah, you would. There's No way Dude, Do yours. I Can't do it, dude. There's no way.

We just wanna learn by tactile approach, by touching, feeling. Right. Learning through our own physical experiences. Man, there's other ways that we can learn. You know, not just analytical. Well, you're failing. I, I, exactly.


But if you taught me the right way with love and empathy Right. I'd be able to absorb the information. Maybe. That's very good. But the beginning, the algorithm part, I, I no, that part that I didn't know what I was doing Then. I Dunno how even know how to look that up. But that kid was so powerful. Was such such a great speech. Yeah. I could've never snapped back at a teacher. We never did that. Yeah. We never did that. We got in, dude, we got in so much trouble all the time.

Take your pants off. Alright. What? That's interesting. End scene. Even the teacher doesn't know. Yeah. I don't know what that is. Yeah. I wouldn't be a good teacher because, not because I, I don't only I don't know knowledge and I, I don't of any topic. You got a lot of knowledge, But yeah. What, what if I had to be forced to be a teacher at a school with the things that I know, what would it be about?

You know what I mean? The history of the History of punk Or the history of alternative music. Maybe I could do, You could do alt music. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But by the way, think about this now.

And you're just gonna sit there, pop, pop, pop. People are dying. You just sit there flame. Yeah, I would, I'd probably just point out that every single person has died as they left. So, oh, alright. This Is pretty logical. Pretty logical. It does make Sense. Yeah. I, you know what, you're, you probably go overboard on the other side under the Water. They would throw me over you saying I that because if you were in front of me and you weren't moving Right, I would throw you over so I could get forward.
