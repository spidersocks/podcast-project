Oh, like look, when they did the remake with, and PE PEs was so good in that movie. Okay. Okay.


Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah. Because at the Renaissance Fair, we ran into a girl that has a kid, and I'm friends with her, And I bought the kid a wand, but it's like, looks like a light saver. So the kid would go like that. He was loving it, and he hit me in the leg And I went, ow, ow. And I fell to the ground. He laughed. So he did it for four hours straight. And then I had to constantly go, ow, owow. You know what I mean? Right. And I wanna disappoint The kid owow enough. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But it was crazy To what? This new, new love on there. No, No, no, no. It's no love. It's D friend. But another thing is, is that you see the stress of it, Of having a kid. Yeah. Mm. Come, come, come, come here.


You know what I mean? It's a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah. Where you go, where you go, where you going? You Know? But see, our parents never did that. They just let us disappear. Yeah. And figure it out. I was kidnapped three times. Yeah. They didn't care. Molested all three times. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. By Downs Patrol. You're all fire today, dude. Yeah. Keep that in. That one's gonna pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta keep that in. That's so funny. But yeah, it's a big responsibility. But I said in the car, I go, if there, because You know, there's a lot of predictions that AI is moving so fast that in the next three or four years, there might be like nuclear, You know, weapons being released.


You know what I mean? Hurry up, speed it up. Let's get the shit over. So I was saying is that having a child would be great because if a nuclear bomb you knew was gonna hit and you had your kid, you want to be strong for him. Mm. And hold him and go, I got you buddy. Right. Yeah. But if I didn't have a kid, I'd be like, what the fuck? What the fuck is going? You know? Right. I would freak the Fuck out. The real you comes out like the fuck. No, I'm both. You are. Oh. So if a nuclear bobbylee was coming and you were alone Sipping coffee. Yeah. You were gonna be cool. Stoked. If I, if it's like National alert, a nuclear war has started just sipping my coffee and my little breakfast.


No, going good. You're not gonna call anybody Who? Your parents. I just talked to 'em an hour ago. Yeah. Love you on time. What do You know? There's Steps For this? Huh? There's steps For this. When a nuclear attack out, seek immediate shelter. I'm already inside. Go underground. Can't no basement stay low. My chairs are low. I have a, I have one of these like little lounge chairs. Yeah. Cover your mouth and nose. Yeah. What is this COVID? Fuck that, dude. I know. Ventilation needs to go off. Shut off the ventilation. I wanna keep it cool inside. Okay. Well let me ask you this. It's just, this is, you're dead. You know what's gonna happen? Yeah. You're gonna fucking die Eventually too. I'd rather die now. Me too than later. Slow death sucks. You know What I mean? You're just walking on a certain plop, your arms gone. You're like, what the Fuck happened?


What happened? You know, Like imagine though. Yeah. Body parts just start falling off 'cause of radiation. Like, fuck that just kill me now. Yeah. The big blast. Just Shock Me. Now, would you get nuclear radiation For Country, meaning then No fucking idea what you're talking about. Yeah. You will. Yeah. Yeah. So it's one of my shows I always go to just to watch over and over again when I have nothing to do. What show? It's Chernobyl on, on Max. Oh, Very Good. Right. And so, You know, they would go, we, because there was one scene where there, they had to get these water bulbs released and they can only send three men down there. But the men were gonna die.


They knew they were gonna Die. Yeah. They knew they were gonna die. You'll, when you go down there, you'll be dead in a week. And three guys volunteered. I'll do it For Country. Would you? For Country? Yeah. Fuck. No. Because If you And I were sitting there, right. And if I stood up, You're saying if I go down, if we, you And I go down, if they go, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, you must do this For Country and it would save the country. Yes. No, you wouldn't. You already showed your cards, dude. Well, this is what would've happened. I'd stand up. Right. He wouldn't stand up. I'd sit back down. Right. I'd be like That fast. And they'd go, Mr. Lee, did you? And you're like, no, no. I just, My back my backtrack my back real fast.


Yeah. So there was a lot of those kind of scenes. No, I wouldn't do it For Country. That's crazy. Because, because The, 'cause it's guaranteed that I'll die. Right. But it's not guaranteed. It'll save the country. It is. It's A literal guarantee stamp. It will, It does. Because in that particular scenario, right. If the molten lava seeped into water tanks, it would cause an explosion. Okay. Right. That was gonna make Ukraine, I think half a Poland and, and some other country completely inhabitable. For a hundred years, we wouldn't be having these problems. Now What Do you Mean by that? That shit would reach Spain before us.


Fucker. You would've died a long time Ago. No, we could definitely reach us first. Yeah. We're much closer to that than Spain. Oh, really? Very. I don't know. Moscow. No, It wasn't Moscow. It, I think Chernobyl is more close to Ukraine. Oh, than, than Spain. For sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So what I'm saying to you is, is that it's gonna, it's gonna make 80 million people die immediately. Wow. So would you make that sacrifice for 80 million people? Well, there's 360 million people in America. Do we have to make a decision now? The commander's standing there. Okay. Commander, can I ask you a few questions, sir? Yeah, sir. Commander, sir? Yes, You may.


You may. Okay. So listen, hold on. I talked, I talked slow. Who? You've, Where are you from? Commander Moscow. Oh, My name is Vladimir. Great. Gohan. Vlad the Impaler. Yes. I love your work. Wait, you may continue my fellow townsman Downs, man. Doy. Doy. Do Doy. Doy. Doy. So listen. Yes. Just because I do this. Yes. What if in a few days something else happens And then, then it's, then We'll send three more Compat.


Yes. You're not gonna, no, that's why I'm not doing it. But you, our offer is this, we will give you a family 40 rubles. 40, 50. 50. 100 rubles. A hundred rubles. Yes. Sounds like every time I repeat what you say, you go up. Did I say a thousand? A thousand rubles? Yes. All the rubles that your family can eat. That We can Eat. Yes. You must eat them because you're gonna have cancer. Okay. Yeah. How do we survive? Eat the money. So you wouldn't do it. No way. Yeah. By the way, you just reminded me of that old Richard Kind told me this an old Jewish joke. He said a Jewish kid asked his Jewish father for a hundred dollars, and the dad says $60.


What do you need $20 for? That's a great joke. That's a good joke. I would never do it For Country. You're not doing it For Country either. And You know that Don't play. But if, but, but, so some of these men had wives and children. These Are stronger men than we. No. And I'll admit that. Dude, stop. If you had people Go to the military, Your wife and your child, We don't have any fucking kids. No, But in this scenario, Okay. But I don't. Okay, okay. Okay. My How many kids? Right? And what do I have weighs? Kids? I got 10. No, You, you have more raw kids. You have six, Seven. What? What? I wouldn't do it. So your children will die.


I don't give a shit. I'll be dead too. We'll all be dead in heaven together. But if you go in, they will not die. Yeah. But then they, I won't be with them. I'll be with them in the afterlife. Ah, thank you. Would you like their position in the government? Oh, I like your thinking. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Government. How Many rubles is that? 20,000 rubles. 20,000 rubles. That's Right. I don't know what, I don't know where that went. What's that old Russian saying? If You hit me in, in Russia, if you Hit me with a feather, I'll hit you back with a tank. Is that right? Yeah.


Caesar Christ's fucking brutal. Is this, I was just playing with my chicken. I'm sorry. Live a century, learn a century. Oh, these are right Without effort. You can't even pull Do it a Russian accent though. Without effort. You can't even pull a fish out of the pond With Don't have hundred rubles, but have hundred friends. By the way, that's government fucking propaganda. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Look, so you are poor. You eat your toenails for breakfast. Big fucking deal. You are friends. Yeah. Yeah. Look at, it's all about friends. Measure, measure seven times, cut once. What does that mean? It's saying, if you're making something, like if it's diligent, that's like, that's Japanese shit too.

In that He's like, it just, I guess something just didn't make sense about it. Wow. But I was like, that's how is that, how do you have that? Yeah. You know what's also funny about him is, is that when I saw him at the Comedy store, I would fucking love Yako, by the Way. Yeah.
