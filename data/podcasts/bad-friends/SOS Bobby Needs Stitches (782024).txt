They're separate bunks. You can't Sleep in there with another person. You barely fit in there. I know. My point is, is then why do they both get bottom bunk? What does it matter? Because They want to pull the curtain back and have a little chitchat. What? Up and down. That's even better. You can, you have to look down one. Oh, That's true. That's true. Okay. Anyway. Anyway. And by the way, when you're across, they can sneak scurry across and then scurry back. Disgusting. Okay. Anyway, so I go, so what are I, where am I? And they're like that top bunk dump bunk. So I gotta take all the shit off. And then there's no mattress. Right? I go, where's the mattress?


Oh yeah, we took it out so we can put the stuff on. So I go, where is it? I You know. We had to put it in there. Right? And then the pillow and the sheet smelled like Tony hcl because he slept in it. It's misery, dude. It's camping. The worst kind of camping you like once The pony's in there. Right. That's my stable. So I'm sitting there and I decide I'm gonna watch Battlestar Galactica from season one again. Nice. Okay. I'm watching. Then I drift You know how I dream. You be drifting. I Drift. I dream. And I, I fantasize revenge fantasies, You know all the tiktoks I'm gonna kill and You know. You know how it does. Yeah. And then I, around two in the morning, I go, You know how one does pee.


Most do, One does All do Sometimes. That's right. All The time. So me, I'm like, should I wait? You know how you're in asleep. You're like, you contemplate, you wake up because of the pee. You're like, can I sleep through this? Right. But then it builds like a damn, It's bubbling. You're bubbling, dude. Good to see you, man. Good to see you. And I go, I, I go to the bathroom. So I, I open the curtain. It's pitch black. What's so funny? Let me guess. You forgot. Don't say RGA again. Once I say pitch black, we can't say rga. I, sorry. Sorry about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You forgot you were on the top bunk.

Right? And I said, oh, the, this is a way you reach over to the other side and put your hand on the edge of the other bunk. That's across the hall. Yeah. So I reach and I go, there's no edge. And I fall. Yeah. And my head hits the edge.


Hilarious. My Head gets, knocks back. I fall to the ground and I, I'm not, I'm knocked out. I You know You know what I mean. I don't know what the fuck. And then this pain in my mouth, I thought I lost teeth. And I open up and I'm drenched in blood. So I take off my shirt and I put it on my face. And then I go into the, the, the first half of the bus. And I go to the Dr. Bus driver. And I go, Hey, I got knocked unconscious and I think I need to go to the hospital. It won't stop bleeding my lips. And you go five hours away, bud. What am I gonna do? We're in the middle of nowhere, five hours away, bud. You can't just sit there five years, five hour away.

I was at Painted Rock Elementary School. We were playing softball. Right. I was running from first base to second base and You know, know what I mean? Kicked me in the nuts. Ack, Why? I don't know why I don't like that. And I fell to the ground. And I remember it was so much pain. And I, I remember also thinking, wow, my nuts are so small. He hid it right on.

What do you do? You smell something. Do you, what is it, what's the take? What's the moment that brings you back? Like, what's the thought or what's the emotion? I think of my dad. I think You know mainly like The way your dad talked or sounded. Yeah. I mean, because You know. I You know. I talk about my life as it was kind of grim.


But there were pockets of joy and there were pockets of good You know memories with him. You know. And my mom You know. So what was your best memory with your dad? My dad, my mom would yell at him like, you don't ever to, to no nothing. You don't ever take him to nothing. Nothing. Like, he was not one of those guys that's like, You know, let's go to the ball game. Or You know what I mean. Well, you don't ball game. Lemme talk game. Teach you how to do this. Yeah. So one day he didn't know what to do. So he like just put me in his car and he didn't know where to go. So he is just trying to drive around. And I just knew this as a kid instinctually. I go, this fool doesn't even know where to go. You know what I mean. We're supposed to put Father Sunday You know what I mean. And he just went to some like generic park with a bench. And he goes, I guess You know Emily will come here.


Yeah. Right. We get out and we just sit on this bench. Right. And he, I remember this because he yelled at me later because I, I, I forgot my jacket there. Yeah. But I remember being on the, and this is why, what's it, why are you smiling? I'm listening to a next story. You and your Dad. So in my mind, I'm like, this is reason, the reason why I remember this is because it was so, it was such an anomaly. Right? Yeah. And I sat there, we didn't talk, but I just remember thinking though. He's trying. It's really nice. It was nice. But then later it was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. We a jacket. You know what I mean? You know what I mean. And he hit me. I think You know what I mean. But I just remember that day though was nice.


I like those moments. Yeah. Yeah. Do you smell? Do you, do you remember how it smelled in the house? I do. Do You know what I mean? When you remember how a house used to smell?
