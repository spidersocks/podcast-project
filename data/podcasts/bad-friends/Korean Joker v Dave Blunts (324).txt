There was a Mongolian guy on my show and I kissed him in the lips. Yeah. And he had the, he just came, came here from Mongolia and he stood up and petrified and he goes, I don't know what going on.


Like, he was like, I don't know what going On here. Imagine a Mongolian guy who's like literally never been to the United States. That's his first track. Look at that. Look at them. They're all data from fucking Goonies allies. They're still dressed like that. That what A peaceful life. Don't you wanna do this with me? Dude, zoom in. That's so funny. What I just realized. Look at his hat. I realize why they like Spider-Man. Why? Look at those eyes. That's the closest superhero they have. Yeah. Might as well do it. Mongolian Chi, Spider-Man. Might as well do it. There's a window open. Let's go spot. Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


Oh, and there's no fucking buildings or trees? No. Yeah. So they're getting trees and then there might be trees. Trees. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Trees. Spiderman, Spiderman from Tree to tree. You Will see. Anyway, this Is Mongolian Spider-Man. That is kind. It does make sense when you see the mask now. I've never even thought about that. Wow. Yeah. Oh, what a cute guy There was Chinese Spider-Man. Yeah. Asian Spider-Man is out there. That's so cute. Alright, so what else in your life, Jules? I want to hear what's going on besides you being tired, which is the narrative that's been happening for the five years I've known you. I'm just living with you to bobbylee 'cause of the fires. Yeah. I have all the dogs. School work.


Well, I could see you working at like Chick-fil-A and that would help us. 'cause I'd like to eat it more often for free. Yeah. I also wanna do that for free food. Well then go get a job at Chick-fil-A. There's one near here. Well, I Need a visa. Oh yeah. The, can you buy the 5 million gold visa For me? What does that mean? Trump says, Trump is giving us, will sell 5 million gold dollar wait, sell $5 million gold card to wealthy foreigners. So you have to pay $5 million. Yeah. And then you get a really easy path to citizenship. Apparently it's not even that much money for a lot of people. So it's gonna attract, like Grifters, $5 million is not much money. That's the Rich people. Every country has a gold visa, which is like, if you invest enough money in the country, you're going, well, I understand that, but this is just your buy out outright buying a visa for 5 million.


If you are an entrepreneur who's invested and has work here, then it's different. But this is, you just pay 5 million, buy A house or whatever it is. Wow. Yeah. But the, the guy that's doing the rice on his head, you know what I mean? He can't go If he had a dollar for every grain. That's true. That is true. That's True. We're gonna be selling a gold card. I love that. It's, it is a gold card. Yeah. It's crazy. You Have a, if you, if you have a green card, this is a gold card. I love, dude. He puts everything in toddler perspective. You have a green card. This is a gold card. But do you know why he is doing this? Because Elon Musk and the tech stuff, remember? Yeah. And so you mean all the Doge shit? What? All the Doge stuff. The, like the Doge employees that are clearing out the government.


Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But there's a lot of tech people from other lands. And then Trump goes, I don't know if he, you know what I mean? And he got, he got, there was a controversy. So now I think this is a way for them to get in. $5 million is insane. So you're telling me enough people, that's a very limited amount of people that have $5 million laying around. That's why they do it. Yeah. But I mean, but then it's like a tease. No one's ever gonna, how many people can really do it? I mean, I guess Chinese money may a lot. There's a lot of billionaires in China. Yeah. But doesn't China have the most billionaires in the world? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. But they're the most people I know. But no, but even still per capita, they have the most billionaires. Really? Yeah. By far. I, I, we don't even have that many. We have the most billionaires.


We do. Yeah. Oh, wow. We're the best. Holy shit. There's Indian bi billionaires. Do it. What? I am the K King. Yeah. That's it. I will be a billionaire. Wealth and technology. Pharmaceuticals and energy. Wow. Wow. Germany. We made a lot of mistakes. Yeah. Yeah. But we're back. Yeah. Russia, of course. We stole this money and killed we they killed for all that money. Yeah. Wow. Russia will kill you. Yeah. Well, 813 billionaires. Do You want that card? Really? I was wrong. I thought If we, if we gave, what would, what would you do for us if we got you a $5 million gold card?


And let preface by saying we're not doing it. Yeah. Yeah. But what, well, if You were gonna Do it, what would happen? You would do this podcast. You're basically, every Week you're basically buying her. Yeah. That's like a buy. You bought a human. Yeah. That's like you would buy a human. Which by the way, you know this is gonna enact human trafficking For sure. That's inevitable of what this is gonna do. Mm. There's no way this is a positive program. Sucks. So what? Yeah. What could you even offer us if Bobbylee and I got a bunch of investors to give us enough money to pay for you to become a $5 million gold card citizen. What do we get in return? I can, I can clean, I can cook. I can wash the dishes. You've never cooked me anything, bitch.


'cause you never asked. You never kicked me. One thing today I woke up from my nap bacon. Oh, I love, were you cooking bacon? Love bacon. Yeah. Yeah. Bacon throughout my house. Yeah. None from me. You cook bacon and don't leave extra. No. That's insane. Yeah. It's insane. That's crazy. Another thing she does is do not like me because I, even when we live together, we never see each other. That's Because I wake up in the morning. You wake up at night, you don't see Each other. There is fact that Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. But even when you're there, trust me, you don't leave. And what do I give you? Donuts. Mm. Old fairy donuts. Mm. Right. I like The pistachio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, get, guess what you've gotten me as a gift?


Zero. A burden. A burden. You're a burden. Trust me. Light. Let me ask you something. What? Everyone in the room, when you cook bacon at home, you cook the whole package? No. No. What? What the fuck are you talking about? What are you talking about? You Don't cook the whole thing. I'm Not gonna eat 15 strips. I Am. I know. No, but I mean, what do you three? No, what you do is you cook the whole thing and then you have, you have some for the dogs. And then you have some in the fridge that you make later with a sandwich. So it's cooked already? No. Oh, that's, I never thought of that. This, It's the best. Okay. It's the, every time I do it, you cook a whole fucking, you don't do this. I do it. I microwave my bacon. Maybe. This is some Midwest shit. Yeah. I've never been into a house back in the day when we were growing up.


Yeah. You always had to have extra bacon because what she's doing is violating you. She's cooking in your home, not leaving leftovers for you. It's a complete violation. It's a complete Violation. Yeah. I agree. It's A complete violation. You cook the whole fucking sleeve. Yeah. You leave some for Tito, you give some for the dogs. You something Bacon. Tito bobbylee. No, but Rap wrap. Wrap Wrap. Tito Bobbylee doesn't even eat like cold stuff already. You heat it up. No. Even then he doesn't eat leftovers once. It's like, Oh my God. There it is. The, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. Baseline fact. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't, But don't say it out loud. Yeah. Don't tell anybody that. Yeah, yeah. No. But honestly, you cook the whole sleeve. Maybe that's in the Midwest, because every house you go to, they would cook the whole sleeve.


You absolutely wouldn't save it. It doesn't make any sense. Also, once you've opened the package of bacon, slimy, sloppy, greasy bacon. You put it in the thing. It's a thing. It's a spill. It's a thing. It's a fridge. It's a nightmare. Yeah. Don't do it. Cook the whole sleeve. From now on, you cook the whole packet and you go take that bobbylee. I cook your bacon and you give some to the dogs. Or do you not feed the dogs bacon? I love, I love who, let me ask you another question. Who gives the dogs treats you? Exactly. Do you buy any treats? They already have their food. No. No, no, no. Yeah, she's doing Filipino rules. That's insane. Yeah. Yeah. And we're in America. Get one meal a day. Yeah, I know. That's what it is.
