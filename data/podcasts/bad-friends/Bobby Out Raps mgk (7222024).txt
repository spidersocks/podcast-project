I was a huge John Cena fan. So that was The first time I got booed by 80,000 people. You Got incredible in. I, because it, you know, you have to play into the storyline of like, the Rock versus John Cena. And I was bringing out John Cena and it was in Miami and the Rock's Hometown. And I thought it would be a really good idea to be like, fuck the Rock after I was done. Why? It's crazy. And Yeah, I just, you know, but they Boo But they love you. It's No, they, they, it was, it's love. But it's The heel. It's the heel theory, right? It's like you become the enemy. So you're a hardcore John Cena fan. I was growing up. Yeah.

I don't want to, you know, pitch it as if I'm like a, you know, a character. Yeah. But you know who else is in this? I Think that's my cambio right there. The top left. Top left. Click on That. Whoa. Lemme see. That's my, like MGK room. That's why it's pink. Wow.


And that's my signature guitar right there. That's your, is that your arm? Whose arm is that? Unfortunately, I'm not that buff. Oh. Oh, wait a minute. Is that your actual guitar in the show? That's my actual guitar. Yeah. Wow. You brought your song. Yeah. When you do, when you do something like this, right, like If, you do a shoot, whether it's a film or a music video or anything like that. Do you always dress it with your shit? No. I, this, the joke was, the, the joke was that I was playing MGK in the movie. Ah. So I, I was myself, which of course, upset a a lot of people. And by a lot, I mean like two bad comments. But, you know, Mgk, when you're on a movie, when you're acting, do you get nervous or you're go, you're good. I get more nor nervous for stuff like this, like quick cameos.


'cause you only have like, you know, what, two minutes to like, make an impression on an hour long movie. So Yeah, yeah, Yeah. I was on a show called Sean Saves the World. Yeah. It was a sitcom. Yeah. And I had, so there was a, he opens the door, I have to say a line quickly. What's The line? I forgot. Yeah. Like, probably something, Hey, how are you? That's okay. But I just kept repeating the line in my mind. And you know, it's in front of a live audience. And as soon as the door Yeah. That I was on that as soon as the door opened, I go, how about, whoa, because I thought about it. I get Some audiences probably understood it. I know they did. They redid it. Right. But I got, well, as a director, would you have me do it over again?


I'd have fired you on the spot. You would've fired me. Was this a Multicam? Yeah. Fired. Immediate. Look at me. Look at me, dude. Handsome. Because You gotta be so on point for Multicam. You gotta be It's But do I look nervous there? A hundred percent. I do. I know. I'm petrified. Yeah, You're staring right in his chest. I have a Question. Yeah, go ahead. So on like Fresh Prince of Bel Air and sitcoms, like when the audience is laugh, there's an actual audience there. There is. And then they, what? They do what they call sweeten it. So they, they they sweeten it. They sweeten it. They put more laughs on top of the laughs. But So what If, you have to do it take six times. It has to be funny six times. No, they do do, it takes six times. Then sometimes they, they just interject more laughs into where the, But also the audience gets it. Right? So they kind of protect, they get, they play along almost like, that's so cool.


It's like, it's pretty positive. What? It's like this show. We laugh all The time. We're gonna turn off your mic any second now. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, keep that bullshit up. Yeah. It's bullshit, dude. What You're doing. Yeah. No, but this is what's interesting about that world that you're asking is, is like, people go to a taping expecting one thing. They're like, we're gonna be there for the recording of the show. Like, as if it would be a 30 minute tape. No, they're there for hours and hours. Whoa. It's like a 10 hour event. It's a long, long, it sucks because they're changing. And then when they change scenes in rooms, it's different stages. So the audiences sometimes have to move. And it's, it's way bigger than people think. And I think when people go once, that might be the last time they go. They're like, it was cool we saw it. But it's a, it's like a workday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're watching people work or Sometimes they're paid to be there.


A lot of times they pay. Yeah. Yeah. They, they pay the room. So they're like, I'm making hundred it dollar. What if it's a big Show? If it's what? A big show. Like what? Gimme a show.

I don't, I actually don't buy like meals there as much as I buy bullshit. Yeah. I buy snacks. Yeah. Great. If your daughter goes, daddy, My daughter is grown. She's 14, But Yeah, let's just suppose she's like, yeah. Yeah. Right. Daddy, good morning, daddy. Now she's Asian. Yeah. Alright, let me white it up. No, no, no, no.

How are you today? How you feeling today? Daddy? Good. And then what, what, what's The question? Daddy? Is it okay? I smoke weed in the house. What'd you say? You're, you're an infant and you're, you shouldn't be smoking. We what? Yeah. Okay. Good. Good. I'm just, I, I don't know because I think I would be the guy, like, you know, just do it in the house. Mm. Right. I'm one of those guys. You're saying if your daughter was 14, if your kid was 14. If it was 14, I'd be like, yeah, just don't do it outside. Do it. I'll get you the stuff. Do it in a controlled environment. When does that talk happen? That Whole like Yeah, that happened. Yeah. Already. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, so Daddy, can I get tattoos like you Oh yeah. What's a tattoo called? What's that? What's that? What's that cat talk? You said that one happened when she was really young.


Oh. She wanted to get tattoos. Like, and you said what? When you're older. I, but I, I also, I just don't want to limit her, you know, creativity in any way. So She Gets the best. I don't, it really is if, yeah, as far as weed goes, I mean, a lot of this stuff, she grew up just seeing, I, I didn't really hide who I was to her. So I, and, and I also never really wanted to because I didn't want that to, I didn't want that from another person to like lure her like the right, the person of being like, oh, you know, the perception of, oh, I want what I'm not supposed to have. It's almost like very just, she, she could never be impressed by someone being like, I, I got cars and weed and Right.


You know, these, I, I, she's, she's very comfortable in her own skin and a very strong independent woman who is like, you know, I come from a father who gives me flowers and tells me how beautiful I am and, you know, is very open about, you know, his, his his lifestyle to where that doesn't impress me. Like I need someone who's gonna, you know, court me and all that. Well, She needs, she needs genuine. She, there's none of the bullshit can impress her. 'cause she's, you've, you've not tried to pretend like that's not a reality. For sure. Yeah. But if, if If, you know, I, I would assume she's gonna want to smoke weed at some point. You know, like, I'd rather like just, I'd rather get her some, get her the weed than it be like, not laced and shitty from some sketch person.


Because the other side of it is Right. Like, otherwise you're so restrictive and like, Bobby was an addict when he was like 12 was smoking meth at 14, 15. Don't move on. No, that's a real story. I mean, you were smoking meth and 15 years old. Yeah. And it is because you had a crazy upbringing. Well, I just didn't know how to, I didn't know how to feel good. Right. Right. And that's was the only way I could feel good. Escape, soothe you escape by using, using Drugs. Right. But that's not the situation. You know what I mean? No, I'm Saying daughter has this is this is what, this is what he's avoiding is. Yeah. No, but he already did it. You can already tell, you know what I mean? Like, she's like, you know, mindful and healthy. And I think the, the phrase that you said that's, that's powerful is I didn't hide who I was to her or hide my lifestyle.


That's a cool, that's a, I think you kind of have to be transparent as a parent. I think so. Because otherwise they're gonna know. They're gonna find out. Yeah. And also, you know, it hit me at a certain age, like when I really needed to, to mature as an individual when she was, like, when she started seeing when she, she, she has the internet too. And so she would started seeing, you know, me in ways that I'm like, Ooh, I'm not proud of that as a father. You know, like that it's, it's different when they're little. You know, I had a baby when I was 18 or 19, and that was before I was ever famous. I was working job, you know, she, she was very young. Like, it was, it, it didn't hit until she was, you know, able to kind of admit that she was disappointed in me.


And I was, you know, as a father who views her as, you know, like my best friend and, and someone who probably the only person I really cared to impress. You know, I, I didn't, I I wasn't proud of a lot of the things that, the ways I was representing myself. So, you know, I I'd say probably when I was 30 is when I really got my, and that's also your Saturn return, you know, just as in as far as astrological things go, that's a very powerful year. Like your Saturn return is, is is when you're 30. And that's very, it's a very powerful year for everybody. You know, like that's a, it's a karmic even for Me.


For Sure. For you it's 60, Like 30 is a very powerful, It's anu it's, it's a powerful number. Yeah. And that, and that year is your sa is everyone's Saturn return, you know, so that's your karmic. I didn't know that when I was 30 though. Yeah, but that's fine. But you, I didn't, regardless your karmic purpose started. I returned it. I setting in, I forgot. And you can either choose to take advantage or I didn't take advantage. I'm sure you did. You seem, I didn't even know. You seem great. Yeah. Yeah. It was fine. I guess Will say you're not on meth. Well, That's true. Yeah. Not, not anymore. Not Anymore. That is true. That is true. Yeah. I'm not anymore. Yeah, you're right. I, I will say, But I mean, I can I go ahead. But that, I think that's one of the reasons why I haven't had a kid because of the shit that I've done. Oh my God.


I would have to go no internet until you were 18. It's hard, man. But it's Hard. Yeah. It, I I I, I accept it and I also, you know, I'm weighed down by it a lot and I, I and plenty of people on the internet choose to remind me all the time. But it's, it's also my job as a leader of, or one of the leading voices of a generation to who, who also can relate to being misjudged by things they did when they were younger or, you know, maybe needing someone to show them how to mature. And, you know, like we all, I I at least like, I looked at the people on TV or in music as my parents, you know, that was kind of like, those were the people.


It's like when Jordan took the Nike and was like, this shoe is cool. Mm. And people are like, yeah. Yeah. Mm. We, we are what we embed ourself in. And to me, frequency, like music was always in here. So I was, you know, trusting these people as my leaders. Like, okay. Mm. And I don't do a great job with that all the time with my lyrics, but, you know, as I grow, I'll, I'll continue to do. So I, I continue to, you know, try and take my job as a, a fuck up who is no longer that. But people know there's a, there I think more than ever, there is always a separation between the art and the artist. And I think people are more cognizant of that in this day and age than we've ever been, I think because We should be.


You and I we're not doing any Of that. No, dude, you're No, no. I'll tell you what, no, we have to change our thing. Dude. Dude. No. Comedy Is so Important. No. We aren't feeding garbage to the people. We have no Message. I'm telling you the rawness of what you guys do. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I I was telling him this on the plane when he was completely incoherent about the puke on my face. Yeah. Yeah. The, it's so important what you guys do. The un the unfiltered, you know, the, just taking the pendulum and swinging it the complete opposite way of what it just was the past five years of just like, where everyone's so scared to be funny or say anything at the, you know, fear of people being like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come for your platform. Right. We Keep taking it away.


We keep doing it then just, I think we had to. Yeah. Yeah. I think we have to, because for us it was the, it was the thing that made us laugh the most. And I think with audiences, going back to what I just said, people know what, what we're saying when we're fucking around. Clearly it's coming from a place of like love and heart. For sure. We shit on each other. It's all, it's all for the art of the fun of the thing. I also don't know how else to do it. Yeah. We, well, we don't, you and I, I mean, I mean, you could say, you know, that's why I don't do like certain shows. Even if they ask, I go, that's not, That's Not for me. Like when I did Chelsea lately, I struggled every show. I mean, I don't care. I mean, I mean, people even said like, why you struggled, you know what I mean?


Because it's not my thing. Right. It was never my thing. But I tried to fit into that format and it came out weird. It didn't work. It Didn't work. This is my format. Right. Yeah. You know what I mean? So this is why It works. Yeah. This is why it works. It's important. What you guys do is important. Like laughing saves our lives, you know, God, I don't, I never think of that. This, it's, it's a grim world. And so to make us laugh is very important. And I'm, I'm very appreciative of what you guys did. Oh my God. I'm appreciative of you. Take me back. By the way, take me back to your 18 or 19 and you have a kid. Are you feeling like you're, you're fucked? Did it feel like that? Or was it hurt? Oh Yeah. Yeah. It was scared. Yeah. I, I, me and my friend Slim, we were sharing a, a, a single bedroom apartment. We were in, in Cleveland. I was working at Chipotle.


I, I had gave up my job because I went to chase my dreams at this new music seminar that was coming into town. I spent my rent money to get a VIP pass to get a, a meeting with the a and r when they, that they do at the seminar where you'll get like an individual meeting with an A and r. Damn. But I had to, it was on the day I was working, and I don't remember if this was the day I traded two days in, like one day I traded my off day to a manager. I gave her Jay-Z Tickets so I could have an off day to go do something, to go Oh. To go to the Apollo. And I got the off day band. But this, this one I couldn't get off, but it was more important than my job.


So I went there, didn't get a record deal, did get fired, did meet my manager who was behind the scenes over there somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. And, and she's been whacking with me since that day. But she was Wait, wait on since then. Wait, how did you meet her? She, I love her. Yeah. Oh, Ashley. Yeah. Yeah. How'd you meet her? She was, she was there. I thought she worked with a record label. Yeah. 'cause I saw a white girl with a clipboard and I was like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, For sure. She works with the right label. She tricked you. When you see a white woman with a clipboard, you do the thing. This is corporate. Yeah. I, I met her and she was really like, she was like, yo, everyone's talking about, you know, you, oh. 'cause there was a, they did an open mic at the, at the seminar, but they gave it to some like, you know, a kid from Atlanta who danced.


Mm. And after he was done performing, I stood up and I was like, guys, like you're in Cleveland. Let someone from Cleveland perform. And they were like, well, who? And I was like, me dude. Dude, I love this. I got up there, Lenny es ironically who works over at Rock Nation and had become my neighbor years later, he was there. So, and it's, it's always great seeing, that's how I get invited to the Rock Nation brunch was Lenny Es shout out Lenny es, Lenny Es. But he was there. And so afterwards, yeah, they were talking and I met her. And then, you know, she came over to my house after, or a day later with, with my friend Slim. And we were all there. And I was like, dude, like I met this record label person. Like, we're on, bro. And she came over and she was like, yeah. Like I'm, I was interning there helping out, like checking, checking the names for everyone who's coming in.


And yeah, I go to college, I'm about to graduate and I, I had just gotten fired from Chipotle. Chipotle. And anyway, she was like, I, I'll, I'll leave everything like I believe in this. So she dropped outta college and she got me a job working on a, at Red Bull as a Penske truck driver to go drop off like pallets of Red Bulls and stuff to People. I had a buddy of mine do that when we first moved to LA. Did. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. So I was doing that and you know, she had a car, so she was letting me, you know, put all my clothes in her car and crash there. 'cause we ended up getting evicted from that apartment. And Yeah, man, like And you're, you're loyal is what I love about Oh, for sure. For sure. 'cause I'm pretty sure since then Yeah, you've had every manager go, come to you and go say with us, you, you won't leave her.


No, that's, you won't, you won't leave her. That's, That's for life. That's for Li dude. I'm the same way dude. Wow. And also, can I say this, may I say something to you? Is there was that moment where you said, I'm gonna go up and do it without that you would've never probably met her, right? Never. Right. Never. And that's the thing that everyone needs to make it, I think in any kind of art form, it's that, you know, you see the window of opportunity. Like when my friend Randy signed me up at the open mic, I didn't know I was supposed to perform. And then when they said my name, I could have gone, I'm not going up. Yeah. You know what I mean? But I want, you know what, I'm gonna do it. You're just like in, in instinctual thing of like, I have to do it. You risk it All, you risk it all. And I just go up there and it didn't go well.


But it's that instinct to do it. You know what I mean? Is I think you need, You do. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You had to have the balls to do it. But that's also what kickstart that sickness that we have where you're like, I need, I have to, I don't have AdChoices. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I must fucking do this. I'm not going back to Chipotle.

I met a lot of great friends and, and, and I, I just, the, the extreme hate that boiled in my chest from seeing people that went to my school, come back from college on winter break to see me working at Chipotle and being like, ah, you were supposed to be a rapper. What happened? Like that probably fueled a lot, but I would be in the back washing the sour cream out of the, like the, those tin Yeah. Things And the hot steam from the sour cream would always come into my face. And Mrs. Officer by Lil Wayne was always playing.


So every time I hear we wee wee, I always just re-sell hot. Wow. Steaming sour cream. Oh, Wow. Because it was like the hottest song on the radio at that time, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hot sour cream, Because I haven't used sour cream in many years. There's a smell. I used to wash dishes. I was a busboy and I did dishes and for Outback Steakhouse. Mm. And there's a smell for everything like that. Exactly what you're talking about when steak and mashed potatoes is like sitting on a plate for a while and then hot water hits it. Holy shit. It's the fucking worst. Worst.


It probably smells like burnt orange oranges that are rotting or Something. It smell, it just smell. It smells like a, it smells like old, old feet. It smells like old wet feet. Yes, sir. I gotta smell. Yeah. You know, in Korea, you know how they, All right, here we go. Take us back to the motherland.

It was like literally 2000 years of Poo. They never emptied it. They Never emp No, it's no, it's like hole in the ground. So it's a hole in the ground. Right. That's been, and you look down.

But that smell I can't get rid of either. You know, If you in those Holes and it smells like shit In those holes in the ground.

What?


Wow. Fuck. Whoa. Now is that cultural appropriation? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That goes the other way. That goes the other way. Wow. And they do it so much, but like everything, they do it better. They do it better. That's Insane. There isn't one Asian guy that can do it that good on earth. Guy. Guy. I imagine this guy gave you, brought him 2000 years in old Japan and bring that guy in there. He'd be all, we Give up. Where's he from? Where's this guy live? Atlanta. Atlanta. And so he came over to the, the house and Yeah, we just kind of, we both like love Dragon Ball Z and Naruto. And so we kind of You bonded over that. Yeah. Low key. And then we tried to kind of just pay a little homage to that in the videos for that song I was playing.


Yeah. Can I talk, talk to about your childhood? So your parents were religious? No. Oh, my father pastor was very religious. Yeah. Have you ever seen American Psycho? Yeah. Oh Yeah. Yeah. He kind of experienced such bad things that he over he overcompensated by becoming OCD. Like how? Oh, yeah. So everything like was either black or white. There was no gray area with him. So yeah. Even religion, I'll never forget. First time I got arrested, he, like, his solution was sitting me down. Like, besides like, whooping me. Like his, his solution was like reading the Bible to me. Wow. To like cure you. Yeah. Yeah.


Yeah. The evils that You were doing. Wow. Did it work? Shut the fuck, fuck Up. It did the opposite. Dude, you Shut the fuck up. It Did the opposite. It Worked. Look at him. Dude. It fucking worked. I kind of, I I, Dude, are you mad? I hid from God my whole twenties, you know? And kind of, and found him later. Where are you now? Completely with God? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I'm with Got, And ultimately, I, I've just, you know, tapped so much more into the Norse magic that was, you know, given to me in my blood. That, that, that also plays like a, You probably love the movie to the Northman, huh? I thought It was all right. I wish, I wish that they, I mean, it was great.


It, it did show, it did show a lot of the magic that with the shoulders is, is on our culture and our ancestors. And so I appreciated that. You know? But I, I wish they wouldn't have focused on one guy on a farm. I wish they would've just shown like war. Whoa. That's my only critique for that. But I did love, like, you know, the, the magic was great. And that's such an important part of our culture. So, and I, and I think that like, you know, we've, I, I watched the internet view that stuff as like Illuminati or things like that so much, but really, you know, magic. Jesus did magic. You know, like, that was magic was such a huge part of our culture. It's just like, been stripped. Because if we all tapped into our own magic, we, the, the, you know, government would be fucked. Everyone would be fucked. Mm. It's if you're, you know, like with with Norse people, you, you know, ruins are a, there's secret words, you know, that the legend is that Odin hung upside down from the tree of life for nine days and nine nights.


And that sacrifice unlocked the secret of what the ruins were. Which ruins are like, things like what's on my hands. Right? So was he On a tree or something? Yeah, The tree of life. Okay. Like backwards from a branch. He had the legs on a branch. It was backwards. I'm sure it was. I I'm sure. I mean, I wouldn't know just visually when Was I, I wasn't there when Odin did that, but Yeah. But he was backwards. How? That's the tree about he was upside down. I said he's upset. Yeah. How is he upside down? Was he dangling backwards? Why are you so fucking aggressive? I'm not being aggressive. I just wanna fucking answer from Yeah, But you're Yelling. I'm so sorry. God. Damnit Close. I'm sorry. I'm trying to see it. Let me see the image. Yeah, ed did his hill. Yeah. Egg. Did I say whoa, I've seen this tattoo. Yeah. Many, many times. Yeah. So Norse people have that.


That's a big thing in our culture. And that's what's on your hands right there. The words, The ruins. Yeah. Yeah. What's Going on? Just looking lighter. Do you want a lighter lighter? A lighter. I got a lighter dog. Thank you, Bob. Wait, toss it and make it fun. Yeah. Toss it. Thank you. Boom. I like playing catch. Yeah. You're not a lighter collector. What of all people that started smoking again, you don't collect lighters. You don't care about 'em. Do you care about lighters? No. Also the most stolen object in human history. Lighters. Yeah. Absolutely Not. Money Probably comes second to lighters. Yeah. TSA So many lighters they owe me. Hold on babe. Bob, catch that. Good job. Good job. That hit my finger A hundred percent.


I knew how that was gonna go. Did you? Yeah. I would've, If this was a sports betting place somewhere, I would've bet fuck all my back. But There was three or four years of one like no lighters. So it's like they have thousands of my lighters to TSA. Well, they throw them away for sure. Yeah, they do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, but then they got rid of that rule. Now you can do it. Yeah. Why do they make you take your laptop out? That's a real question. I have so many questions. Why do they make you take your fucking laptop Off? I don't know. Why do they make you put your tray table up when we're going 700 miles an hour and we're gonna die anyway? If you. Yeah. You're gonna Die. Why Do they, why do they make me move my seat up six inches if we're already, And because a one shoe bomb guy, now we have to take your shoes off. I mean, no, you don't.

But the, yeah, he wa and you know, it was funny, I had a championship ring, the Cavs championship ring in my backpack. When he was searching it, I'd come back from New Zealand and he was like, oh my God, this is my daughter's favorite team.

You know, you know how sometimes when like pills expire? Yeah. Like it just turns To dust or whatever. So I was assuming because no way I would be that stupid, but was definitely that stupid based off the test. And he was just looking at me and he was giving me the kind of vibe, like he was gonna be cool. Oh, you know, Can I borrow that lighter again? Wasn't cool. Yeah, Yeah. Was not cool. Yeah. It is funny though. He takes a picture, finds cocaine, and then you, when he is like, I gotta bust, you're like, I gotta delete that picture of the Yeah, yeah. That picture back my head. I was thinking that like, wait, this, this exchange is not even, oh, Watch the, watch him throw it. This gonna be even funnier. Can you get it right this time? Because I don't wanna keep doing this.


You know? A hundred Percent. A hundred percent. Why don't just let him keep the fucking line. Yeah. Won't, I won't light it again. This will be my last light. Him. See, let's just, let's Just see. You know what? You can, This will be my last light all ready? Yep. He's going over him. Okay, dude, Look at that. Yeah. Athleticism. We'll throw it back. I'll catch it. I was making a joke earlier. Dude. Focused so fucking hard. It was unbelievable. Unbelievable. Dude. I saw his eyes. Dude. I know. I learned from Bush. Remember the shoe He dodged? Yeah. Yeah.

I'm winning today, dude. That was Really Good, dude. I'm winning all the time right now. Dude. You're Yeah, you are. You're winning harder than I think you did that, that catch this, right? Him and I have that.


You know what I mean? We're doing good, dude. What do you, Do you have any mortal enemies? Mortal enemies. Like Bobby has mortal enemies and, and we've talked about it on the show. We don't need to mention the names, but Bobby has mortal. I know Mortal Enemy. What the fuck you talking about? Dude? Really? I love, I love everybody. Really? Yeah. They're just fun little wars. I like to start with people. They're not enemies. I love them. If they died, I would fucking weep like a little baby. Not all of them. I'll tell you why though. Can I? Okay. Here's the thing with me. You do have mortal enemies. I'll tell you why though. Machine gun can call your machine gun. Absolutely. You. I like, I like machine, Machine, machine. Check it out. So if somebody physically touches me in a, in a very violent way, that's when I go, okay.


That's the boundary that I Sure. Right? So like, if anyone assaulted you, would you fucking have, you'd be like, Unless you were my friend. Yeah. But somebody that like, was like, Hey, fuck you bitch and pushed you onto the ground. Yeah. No. It depends on if we were close and then we made up somehow. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But otherwise, no Have ever, I've never physically assaulted you. Right. I don't think it's assault if you're less than. Do you know what I mean? There's a better way to say it. I don't think you could hurt me. Dumb, dumb, dumb. No dumb dumb dumb to you machine. I'll tell, I'll, I'll tell, I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this machine. Dumb, dumb, dumb to you. Is is that I could physically hurt both of you right now and I choose not to do it.


No, I don't want to because No, get up and do it. No, because I'll tell you why. Get up and do it right now. That I'm not a violent man. I'm not a violent, I'm not gonna stay for life Then don't talk violent shit. But what I'm saying is, is that in a situation, dude, in the right moment, I will fucking go monkey style on you head. Well, when I'm asleep, yeah. If I'm passed out, You got, I'm monkey a spider monkey onto your head and I'll do damage to your fucking head. Top, top, tippy top. Dun dun dumb. Alright. You guys are mocking me, dude. But it's like, no, you don't wanna raise me Out. You're the one that started it. Why? Because You're talking like that. You could physically assault us. It's crazy. It's an insane thing to think. No, I'm just saying that. I just dumb.


Alright Dude. Comedy isn't praise. You do really That well. It was perfect. You Do that well. But what I'm saying is, you Know, you would never put a hand on me. That would be crazy. I'm, I know, but you put hands on me. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think that's right. And I'm gonna draw the line now. Don't do it again. I'll do it whenever I want. I know you will. And I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Get this outta Love. Do you have any mortal enemies? I'd say I had an Ego Death. And so that kind of dissipated with that. How Beautiful. When did the Ego Death come? 2022. Why? Realizing public perception will always change.


If. you just continue running the marathon. And I think also realizing I have no control of outward opinions. And that what is important is how I feel about myself. And that's what radiates. So I, it's also not my job to be liked by everybody because art is what I do. And art is always supposed to be conversational. And if the conversation is just one way, then it's boring. So as long as I do my job and create conversation bad or good, I'm an artist.


And by the way, bad and good is an interesting, because you're, I agree with everything you're saying. There's no such thing as like a bad version of the conversation about you because it's all, it's all surrounding what you're making. Agreed. So whether people like it or not is, doesn't Yeah. It doesn't really matter. The People that like you and the people that hate you, it's all the same thing. Sometimes People that hate you, like you more than people that like you. It's, it's all money in your pocket. Well, no. To, to, to me. Why? I'll tell you why. Well, It's not just the money. No. I'm just, let, let me, I don't know why you left at that. You meet a Spanish friend. Okay, I'm gonna say you this. Okay. Let me get my points out if I may please. I'm 50% of the show.


40. Yeah. 40. I'm 70. Dude, you're 75. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm so what am I what I meant? But say not money in your pocket. But what I meant to say is, is that you're a correct. It's the conversation, right? Yeah. It's just like if I wasn't causing conversations out there that I wouldn't be successful. True. As is. Especially as a comic. Right. I think the reason why we do, well, maybe, you know what I mean, is because we do, cause you know what I mean? There are people that don't like us. Sure, of course. And our style of comedy or whatever, of course. Oh, whatever. And I just think that, and you're right, machine, right? There's nothing we can do. No, They're, the one thing you can do is finish the book. Finish book. They're gonna read the beginning.


Oh God, I gotta finish the book. They're gonna read the beginning and they'll make their assumptions. And as long as you finish the, as long as you get them through the entire book, they might find out that the, you know, perceived antagonist was really the protagonist. And there is a nice spin at the end. God. So this, This Guy, it's fucking great. Yeah, dude. But it's also so true. It's the amount of people that even like, as a kid, a someone that was famous or a celebrity of some kind that I had a perception about. And then I got older and then you saw their life change or saw their, saw them develop and I changed my opinion of them. It's, there's tons of them. There's so many people like that. Yeah. Gimme one example.


Well, I would say not, my first thought thought was the way people always perceived Rodman when I was a kid. 'cause Dennis Rodman was such a polarizing figure. And then it, the more people that learned about him, about who he was or who he, you know, versus who they perceived him to be, it was kind of a beautiful flip or a change. Tyson had the same thing. People didn't understand Mike Tyson. I feel like now they're getting to see who Mike Tyson really is. Yeah. But as a kid, it was always like celebrities in certain athletes or certain famous people that I was like, I don't even know if I like that guy. Or they bothered me. Then you see them grow in their whole, you're reading more of their book and you're like, oh, I, no, I do. I guess I didn't know that person.


Yeah. I, I always was scared of Mike Tyson for some reason. And then one day I was, no, He is pretty fucking scary. Yeah. But I was at the comedy store. He goes, Hey man, I'm Mike Tyson. Yeah. I'm a big fan of your work. Right. And I go, oh shit. We took a photo. I remember showing my dad the photo. My dad cried. You go Michael Tyson. He said, I can't, he, I can't Believe you know, he called him Michael Tyson. Yeah, Michael Tyson. Michael Tyson. He literally weeped. 'cause he, my dad's a big boxing fan. Yeah. Right. And then I did a movie with Mike Tyson, you know what I mean? And he, he's just a nice guy. Anyway, What movie did you do with Mike? It was called, oh my God, I hated this movie. I even forgot what it was called. I hated it. Well, I can't wait to see this. I have a funny Rodman story. I think that's what it gimme the Rodman story.


So we're, I was directing and writing a comedy with my friend Mods son, and we were looking for a Oh my God, Dude, that was me in the movie. I, I looked, oh my God. Dude. Dude, why didn't you tell me, dude? Well, I mean, I just, I Why didn't you tell That? Look, our frat lesbian. You Dude. Dude, I look like shit there. Dude. That is wild. That is, That's Look at that dude. It's a bad fit dude. It's a, when you put that on, you won't like, gimme something else. That's a tough thing to wear. But that, does my body look like that now? No. Be real. It doesn't. Okay, good. Thank God. The boys Will tell you. Yeah. From now on, if I ever look like that, just say Ozempic and I'll get on it.


Right. Because that's fucking, I look like, anyway, Gimme your Dennis Rodman Story. Rodman, can I Have your lighter one more time? No. Bump, bump, bomb. No. All right. The teasing of it is great. Yeah. Can you throw it back? Can you just do it as hard because you did it hard last time. Do it hard. No, don't do it as hard. Okay. Gotcha. That's what she said. Alright, Ted, gimme Dennis. So Do you know who this is? Yeah. The redheaded guy? Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Me and my son were doing a comedy and we wrote this part for, you know, an athlete to come and punch me in the face. And we were like, man, what athlete could we do?


And, and Maude has Dennis Rod's face tattooed on his arm. And so we were looking and I was like, you know, we were like, oh my God, Dennis Robin for sure, we should hit him up. And so we hit Dennis Robin up, he agreed to do it as long as we booked him a Rolls Royce to bring him from Orange County up and Seems fair For sure. And I was like, great, no problem. Fine, fine. And so he's on the way up and the Rolls Royce driver is like, he's smoking a cigar in my Rolls Royce. Like I'm turning the car around. I was like, this is Dennis Robin. You let him do whatever the fuck he wants. Just please get him to the, we rented Van Nuys airport out for like an hour. And and up until this point the producers were basically like, why did we do this?


Like, we don't have a confirmed athlete. This was all like, we were doing the Dennis Robin things behind the scenes, just kind of just please do this. Right? And so he finally gets there and you know, ma is the one that has his face tattooed on him. And so he walked up and he was like, dude, Dennis, what up? And he goes straight past him out and he sees me. He is like, what up superstar? And wow. Me, ah, Maud laugh about that to this day. It was so funny. And then he did the scene and he killed it. And he had on a wrinkled t-shirt that we were like, do you want to change? He was like, I'm already in my outfit. And we were like, yeah, for sure. Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was good. And it was great. Yeah, he was awesome.


He was so, so cool. And I really appreciate him for doing That. Smoking in the, in the rolls, right? Smoking a cigar in the rolls is so Machines. Yeah. Mr. Machine. So awesome. Mr. Machines.
