That's just Jello. Yeah. Yeah. That's jello. They could have tried a little bit. It's Nice and red. I like it. 'cause it's, 'cause the thing is, it's in the uncanny, like, they want it to be physical. It's clearly not an actual monkey brain. They respect you enough to do that. But they'll be like, it's a rendering of a monkey brain. Especially these are, these are like homages to old adventure movies when they didn't have that stuff.

That's the best one. It's not the best one. Number one is the best one. Number one's the best one. But that they're, they both, both two and three have their fun little charms though. Totally. Sean Connery. And then the beginning part with River Phoenix. River Phoenix. That's fucking fun. Yeah. But in the temple, my dog, he Also runs into Hitler also. Yeah. Runs into Hitler. Yeah. Yeah.

And she had to read a bunch of times. She had to read a bunch of times. No, no. She Got the role offered for sure. No, I saw the documentary.


Really? But she got The role. She got the role offered. Oh, They asked. That's awesome. This is the most, like, let's lose every young person tuning in. Yeah. Talking about by, by in detail. Discussing Indiana Jones. Yeah. You know, she kind of looks right, like right there. She kind of looks like Einhorn is Finkel. Finkel of Einhorn. Oh yeah. Mm.

Well, she played a girl so well that could have been a guy that we didn't even question it when they said it was a guy.


I, I have a different read on. Okay, go For it. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Gimme, gimme a read. But San Roses, I, well, first of all, I'll say I was so fucking dumb as a kid. Yeah. That I was like, I didn't realize, because the whole idea was they put her dick in her ass. Yeah. Or she was tucking her Dick Tuck. Yeah. So, as a kid, I thought she shit herself. I thought that was the big reveal is that she had shit. And I, and they're like, ah, she's gross Now. She's a dirty, she's a dirty More than shits herself. Wow. But I also will say, I think it's a complete, like, I don't think she played it as a dude. I think she was just a hot, aggressive woman. She had masculine qualities that they did tip off in the movie a few times. And by the way, I know why you thought that was poop and not a penis.


'cause 'cause Mama Halkias was just feeding you that b about being like, don't worry baby. Don't have to worry Poop. You're probably right. I, it's a poop's a poop. I watched with my dad and he didn't wanna explain. Totally. He didn't wanna explain it. He was like, she shit herself. Right. You didn't have a jilted childhood where my dad was like, that's a dick. That's a fucking dick. But the, I think the re the, the fact that they played her masculine, actually. 'cause if a trans girl looked that good Oh yeah. He wouldn't be masculine. They Do. But what I'm saying is they, I don't know. Be more feminine. Dude, Get on the internet. It's insane. No, No. They do. They do. But I'm just saying it's insane. But I'm saying their mannerisms are not aggressive. They like to be girly. Do you masturbate? Yes. Do you masturbate to trans? I have to have you, you Look so concerned.


No, I just want, I'm just wondering whether I've taken it for a spin a couple times. Well, you're Not, you're not a fan of the party. You don't wanna show up. Well, I, I, I, you know, because of Jim.
