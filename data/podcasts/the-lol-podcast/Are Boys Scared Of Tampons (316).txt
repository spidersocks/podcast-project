Kate do be running funny, but that's okay. No, I She looks like a little Barbie. Ding Ding ding, ding. That's what gets me the most is her hands. You on this way, anytime Kate runs or if you ask her to throw a punch, she does this. Well, just so you guys know, she flicks a today on the treadmill.


I was highly insecure because you've made so much fun of me. So I was, I Focused on my posture. I thought you looked good. It was Great. Thanks. I, I was, I I ran today for the first time in eight months. You know, I'm not even capping. I've seen Harper at the gym just as many times as I've seen Mav at the gym. That's not true. I've been going to the gym with you for like four years. We've went To the gym. That's crazy. That's because I don't go to the gym. Gym. That's No you don't. But I've seen you at LA Fitness a couple times and I've seen Mav less than that. Do you do tanning beds Harper or no. Pretty Finish with you too. To play basketball when You go hands. My friends do tanning beds. But you're, you have to be 18 to do tanning beds. So they Tanning beds are bad for you. Don't do 'em man. I know. I told you. Why are you doing them? Me? Why are you doing them and skipping the gym? I don't know man, guy die somehow. You know what I'm saying?


I'm so scared of tanning beds is the final destination. Movies. Listen You over. I don never watched. It can be bad for you, but it's scary. Wait, What movie? What happened in the tanning bag? The final destination movies. What, what happened? I shouldn't say it's actually, it was like a horror film. No, just tell me it Was bad. Wait, where do you, can you, where can you watch it? No. Like, just for a Question. I don't know. I only ever saw the clips of it. But my family was always like, don't on TikTok. No, no, no. My family always told me don't watch the final destination movies. Like people die brutal deaths in those movies. So you're gonna be scared. Don't watch 'em. And I said, I got Y'all. I wanna watch it. Oh, they died in the tanning bed. Well just, yes. What happened was the room caught on fire and they were locked in the tanning beds and they couldn't get out. And then it was just, you know, Oh my.


And so now I'm Terrified. If it helps, I think actually dying in a tanning bed would even be worse. Yeah. If, if it was just trapped shut. Yep. That's why I don't get in. How, how long do you think it would take to kill you? You sh I don't know. You definitely, you'd definitely be well done by the time you're, you're like, how long is a normal appropriate time at a tanning bed? Like 20. Like 20 minutes. Well, it depends on the light bulb. 20 No. 20 if you want to freaking die. It depends on the light bulbs. Okay. In In like tanning beds where you lay down, some people do go in for like 20 minutes 'cause the light bulbs are not as harsh. Wait, Isn't tan bed or just Standing up? No, You can do 20 minutes. You just have to work your way up. Wait, did you Stand up in the tanning bed or lay down stand? I don't do the lay down ones. That makes me feel gross. 'cause other people's bodies been, I don touching my friends do.


I don't. Here's the thing, you can do 20 minutes. You just have to work your way up. You gotta start with like three or four minutes. I just don't understand why, why you're going. I mean Mean just get a spray tan. It's, it's But a spray tan doesn't help you in That's Most likely a lady. It makes me looks good. You're already tan though. Why would not wanna Harper tan? Me and Harper are white as can be. Sorry. But it's true. We both are. I mean you think tan Cash has to take I'm probably the measures when he goes in the sun. He could. I think the tanning bed might actually be good for cash. Your knee? No, If he goes in like, like two minutes. Why knee skin? He, her knee knee's broken. Look at that. He tried. Ew. Her knee does look broken. How do you bend your skin? Your tibula is not tib.


How is your legs are Bow in this way. Oh my God. Look at my arms. Do y'all see that? Look at my arms. Oh, I do that too. But it kind of feels good. I Know. I love it. No catch.
