Well he's so nonchalant about it too. Look at it. He's so like, it's so weird seeing cash this quiet on an episode. Like he's never just not talked so Much. Yeah. It's 'cause he has no energy anymore. Yeah. And I'm kind of like, It's the best day ever. I'm kind of, you know, I, I feel like cash and me like can kind of relate right now.


Like I'm just so tired. Be Honest. You're tired. Well wake up. Well wake up. Dang it. Wait, hold on. I would argue that I'm honest. I would argue that I'm honestly I Can, I can't in a worse position than cash right now. I feel like we need to wake up. I feel like we don't got Oh, that got us. Congratulations. An Actual hole on the tv. There we Go. Real quick. We woke. You need water? Yeah, he's still alive. Good. Harper. You wanna feed him some water? Yeah. Alright Harper, wait. No, not water yet.

No, let's go. Okay. Okay. Relax. It's fun. What do you want me to talk about? Who? Who thinks dinosaurs are a conspiracy In the water? You know, The other day. The other day? Yeah. Are you talking about pyramids? No. No. No one cares about Pyramid but the other day we went ahead and did an all girls. Oh my gosh. You. I don't like that The other day. You I didn't get any. I don't really care. Here you go. The other day we did an all girls podcast and it honestly was like the most relaxing thing ever.


It was me, Kenzie Harper was very relaxing. Reese Harper's older sister. And it was so nice, so relaxing. We had a cutie little LOL girls' like logo made. It was so fun. I know. And like, nothing like this happened. Like nobody was almost dying. Nobody was breaking and putting holes in our wall. Like, because I actually don't think cash is okay. No, I Don't think he's okay. Everyone relax. Also guys all day. Harper has been talking about how she like wants to hang out with friends and stuff and like how everyone's hanging out. But she didn't get invited. Yeah. And so I was like, oh my gosh Harper, we're having a little like movie night with some friends. We're gonna watch like the proposal or the Princess Diaries or something like You can hang out with us. And she was like, She's like, ah ha ha. Yeah.


Hard pass. No. And now she's all hyped 'cause she's got someone to hang out with Tonight. Personally, I wouldn't wanna hang out with someone either. It's because that believes that, what is her name? Helen Keller is real. Is is fake. I never said she was fake. Yeah, you did. Yes. I didn't say she was fake. I believe Helen Keller was a real person. I just don't know that she was 100% blind and 100% deaf. Why don't you believe that? Because I feel like there's no way she could accomplish all of those things being 100% blind and 100% deaf. I think she had to, she a song. I don't know about that. But I think she had to have been a little, had a little tiny bit of sight or could hear just a little bit there. Yeah, she definitely could. She was not 100% blind.


Both ways. I think that if, I think that it was kind of like made up to be this like inspirational story that they tell you in school. Oh yeah. Because they needed that. Yeah. No, When she was born, she was actually not blind or deaf and then she got over sick Or Something. I didn't know. So that's Why she was like two years old or something. She got sick. Yeah. But I just find it a little hard to believe. When I was in high school, I went down a whole like rabbit hole of why, and one of the, one of one thing that could have been is that her teacher, Ann Sullivan wanted to kind of, you know, make the whole thing for fame. And she got a lot of attention from it. She Kicked Ann Sullivan's teeth out one time. She did, She kicked her teeth Out. That's pretty good aim for a blind person. I Know. See she wasn't Hundred percent blind.


No, the chick was blind. What is wrong with you? I just, I don't know. I think that I did you, okay, so what do you call someone that's like blind but they can like see like light, like you can see like a little bit of like, okay. Yeah. Shapes and stuff. There's definitely a light over here. I wonder if blind, you're blind. You can watch A Podcast. I would say that To that. If You can see, I, there's a guy that's blind that I walk into church and he sits with me. But he can see like where the stage is 'cause of all the lights, all the lights are, but he can't see like anything else. Yeah. Like wi he would you say he's blind? Yeah. Yeah. Like our dog I would say. Would you say he's blind? Yes. I would say he's blind, but he is not 100% blind. If he was 100. But you call him blind. Yeah. So Helen Teller was blind and deaf. I'm saying she was blind and deaf. I'm saying she was not 100% blind and deaf.


Like they're telling us, Is anyone a hundred percent blind and deaf? Unless they lose their eyes? I'm Sure. I think so. I think there are people That can, I think most blind people can see like some light a little bit here And there. Well, I most, not all. Well you know what, blind people, you know when you close your eyes you see red. Well, I don't know What, wait, you see red. We're not Why? What, why? Well, I Also guys, because these lights, someone gave a really good analogy one time. They were like, I see black and red. Like you see black and red. Let's all open our eyes again. I don, someone gave gave a really good analogy. They were like, when you're blind you cannot see, like try to imagine seeing outta your finger. You can't. Oh that's, ooh, why does my finger feel weird now? It's like, or your kneecap or something. It's like you physically cannot see. You can't imagine.


And you cannot see outta your Kneecap. Wait, do people who are born blind have dreams then? I don I don dunno Anything like first You can imagine more than a kneecap because we, You Can blind, but you can touch, You can imagine something you've never seen. You don't touch what to imagine. You can touch them and feel them. You can imagine there's some bars here that I Can feel and touch. I Don't know. I honestly, I don't understand it completely. I just know that when I was 15, I had way too much time on my hands. And You wanna know the genius that came up with that analogy? Who he Didn't? Yeah, he was the one that said that on a podcast. You Did not say that. Yeah, he said like, imagine trying to see out your kneecap. Maybe He Did. Maybe imagine though. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I can't Failure.


He's soaked. He Loses. He is literally soaked. Oh, That's so sad. Ew. He's got Except dripping down his body. He's got, he's got Sweat. Bro's. Got enough water for all of Africa right here.
