I was like, I knew I wasn't gonna date her. If I was gonna go see her, it was literally just gonna be to hang out or it was gonna go be to see Kate. But I've already been dragging Kate on for like four years. So I was like, okay, if I see her this time, like we either have to date. Oh yeah. Or like stop talking because we've been talking on and off for like four years. So it's either time to date Kate or time to cut her. And I had to make up my mind and I said, you know what? I'm gonna date her. I, 'cause I like her. And Wait, hold on. Can you stop? No. You said you were gonna cut her and then me and Alex said you should probably date her. No, cut her off.


Oh no. I did not say that. And I was like, I I'm gonna date Kate. I like her. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna choose her over every Other. You always the ultimate decision. I wanna know like what in your mind was like, this is it. This is a choice I have to make. Okay. Y'all acting like I had a gun in my head. Hello. Maybe I just liked Kate. Anybody ever think that I really feel like me and Alex and you, me and Alex, you shouldn't be here. Me and Alex should story. No, no. Listen, then Alex knows. No, then I know I don Kate. I know ma shut up. I go pick up Kate and then I'm, we're driving back to Oklahoma 'cause I went to go pick her up. We're driving back to Oklahoma. I was like, and I was like, okay, I gotta tell her and shut up bro. Crap dude. I got poop on my fingers. What the, what?


How, how I like wiped. I don't know. Did you touch cash? What? I'm kidding. Wow. You got me. You Got, so what is that? Eyeliner? A nick stick. Oh, What stick A knick stick a marker. NYX. Yeah. Knicks eyeliner stick. Anyway, So I picked T up. Very impressive. I'm driving back to Oklahoma and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna tell her everything tomorrow. That seems like a good time. Pretty much by every, She's stuck in Oklahoma and can't leave By everything was just, I was gonna be like, well I'm gonna ask her to be my girlfriend tomorrow. No. And then I'm also gonna tell her like, oh, by the way, I also did kiss quite a few girls. That's crazy. Girls. That's like the, Hey, will you marry me by the way, I'm $10 trillion in debt.


No, no, No. It was what? Well first of all, he's also Y'all actually, I literally was single and all I was telling her before we started dating. You say that before you asked. No, no. I I was like, I hadn't asked her to be my girlfriend yet. I just picked her up just to hang out. And we're driving to Oklahoma. Y'all are making this story so chaotic. Like Kate, tell it. No, you're chaotic. Keep erupting. And that's why the story's not good. This Is lighter than Kate's hair. Yeah. Wow. Isn't that weird? Inside. I we're in Oklahoma the next day, so, so it's fine. You're leaving him. My gosh. In, in detail. What did we stop at Sonic? No. After we stopped at Sonic though, the girl from Florida starts calling him on the phone. Beep. While I lay, while I'm literally in the car with him. This other girl is calling his phone.


Oh. And I'm like, I'll answer it like as a joke. The thought that he had another girl in Florida did not even cross my mind. I was like, oh, let me answer it. And he is like, hold the phone. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's fine. Gimme the phone. No, no. Gimme the phone. And And I'm like, okay. I won't answer it. There's probably a reason why he doesn't want me to answer it. I Don't want Anyways. So girl from Florida calls, That's it. That's it. She she called my phone. Y'all Didn't answer. No. But then Did you have any But then no I Didn't. Any suspicions. We weren't dating Question. We Weren't dating Question. I'm allowed to talk to females when I'm single.


Question what? This is an important part about Cassius character. What did you tell the girl from Florida that you weren't gonna go meet her in Florida? That's what she Calling About. Listen, I was making up my mind here. Wow. I was a single man. Oh So you just ditched her? No. You let this girl in Florida be like, where's Kyle? She's not here. He told me he was gonna be here at 10:00 PM but now he's stuck in Houston. He's gonna have a four hour drive. The same thing you did to Kate. What I always say, the other man person, there was no happy ending. Can everyone shut up and let me explain myself. Okay, continue. I was a single man. I had two girls asking me to hang out. One, I was gonna D date potentially one I was not.


I said okay, I'm gonna go with Kate 'cause I like her better and I want to date her. So I go pick up Kate. We're driving back. Then the girl calls that. That is completely not my fault. I'm, I'm still single at this moment. At this moment. I this exact moment I'm not even dating. I have no relations to Kate. But you like, but like let's be real. You went to Kate's house. You drove down there three hours. You go to who? Her father. You ask her. You ask her dad, right? No, no. Ask him what to like ask your daughter to be my girlfriend. No, no. He came down. He was like kind of serious though. No, He came down and like met my entire family and we went to dinner and Everything. Yes. I had to meet her entire family. 'cause I was taking her to a different state. Obviously they weren't just gonna let you run off of some guy.


Anyways, and let me get to the story. Okay, so we're driving to Oklahoma. Okay. She called. I was like, no, we probably shouldn't answer that right now. Maybe later. And then the next day comes, we spend the night in Oklahoma. You laugh at Kate. Matt was just a hard person to tell a story with. I know. Oh yeah. That's what you're laughing at. Okay. The next day comes, okay, we spend the night in Oklahoma. Next day's here, me, Alex and Kate are in the car. And Alex goes, did you tell her yet? And I was like, And it was at that moment, no Alex, my car. I did not actually who's in the car? I'm in the car. Yes. All three of us are in the car. I was like, no Alex. I did not tell her yet. It was then why would you ask that question?


Because if I didn't tell her, obviously this situation is happening right now. I think Alex was just kinda on Kate's side. He's like, yeah, Alex was definitely team Kate. He was like, did you tell him yet? And then Kate was like, tell me what. And I was like, oh. Oh it's just time thing I tell you. We'll get back on Funny story honestly. Oh my gosh. And then Kate, I was like hey,

I want you to be my girlfriend. But also I just thought I should let you know. I don't even know why I should let you know like I was single. This is ridiculous that I'm even in this situation now. I was like I want you to be my girlfriend. But also the past like couple months since we've been talking a little bit, but like not dating, but we've been talking. It's important information. I've been talking to other girls too. No, but you know I'm gonna cut them all off and I'm just gonna date you and I wanna make this official and that was it. And I see no harm at that's single important detail. When you're single, you gotta play the field. You gotta see which people. Before I talk people, I was like right before I asked you to be my girlfriend, if I was like, hey you should know though. I've been talking to like 70 other women and I'm gonna cut 'em all off though.


No, it's kind of the opposite. Which still hurt my feelings. What Ma? Before he asked me to be his girlfriend, like a week before he was like, oh You can go on dates with whoever you want though. Like any guy that you want to talk to, it's fine. Oh That's so pick me of him. I was like, Go On any other dates with any guy not like me. I'm not the Special man. Well it gave off the impression that you just were not into me at all and you just could not wait for me to go on a date with any other human being except for you. Yeah. Well play hard again. Play hard again. Do you Think, do you think it's bad if, if if like you're talking to a guy and before you date them they kiss another girl and then they're like, oh yeah, while we were talking like I kissed a girl but like now I'll just like cut them all off. Yeah, Cut 'em all. You cut them off.


Yeah. No that's bad. That's bad. And I'll tell you why. 'cause that's exactly what had happened. You kissed the other Girl. Oh My God. That's called not being intentional Maybe. Okay. No, but listen, when you are single, okay, see y'all wanna hear that word? Single. Single. Single. I got you are allowed to talk to people. Yeah. And you're allowed to talk to multiple. Just are you though? Are you though? Are you supposed to like talk to other people like that? Literally just talking. Okay. What? But were you like even literally just talking question, question kissed a couple times. But that was, see that, so like there's A social media guy. Okay, who likes Harper, let's say, which hypothetically. And he's going around kissing like every other girl in LA and Harper's like, I really like him. I really like him. You'd be like, no, he's trash. Don't talk to him. Yeah, That was your trash, that was you.


But if he had a change of heart and he was like, actually all that stuff I did was wrong. I know I shouldn't. Oh I'm sure they're gonna take Harper. I'm not gonna, I'm not doing that anymore. Like that stuff's wrong. Yeah. So that's the old me. And then also since it's the new me here I I, I wanna date we should be official change then, you know, that's completely fine. So then cash and I, you know, have our happy Lee ever after for about a week. And then I get curious. Okay, I am a curious Kate All day telling just to tell why you went through my phone. That was Crazy. So I'm 15 years old. Okay. Not even, I couldn't even drive yet. That's how young I was 15 years old. I finally am dating cash. This is all I've wanted for the last like five years of my life. So happy.


But I also could not forget that there was other girls. He had literally kissed before me. So I'm like, let's just go see. So I open up, oh no. I was like, I just wanna see what he talked about with them. Like was he into them at all or was it literally just like, let's go hang out. Valid. So I open up the most recent girl that I knew he had hung out with. I open up her messages. Okay. Oh no. He didn't say, will you be my owo? No, this is crazy though. I open up this girl's messages. Okay. Oh no. And I remember this night. 'cause this had been two weeks prior. Let's Also clarify. Don't, you don't need to go through people's phones. Okay. Yeah, no I could've. This was a wrong thing for you. Very wrong. Wrong. It was wrong. I could've just asked and he would've showed me anything.


And you've never done it since. Right? That's what I was confused about. False. What? What He just told me the other day about a different thing. No, What the us That about cash though. Will you beat my ew The other thing that you told me, Did you go through somebody else's phone besides mine? She's gone through my phone before. I know that. No, Not your phone can. Okay. My iCloud. Oh, I didn't go through your iCloud then. You did? Yeah. A bunch of pictures. Everybody did my iCloud. We all, we were all gathered around this tablet that Maverick's iCloud was linked to and we were all scrolling through, okay Wait Kate, this makes it so much better. What? It doesn't make you look as bad if they're all there.


Oh Yeah. It was a group activity. He was scrolling through his phone. It was like every single morning this man took a shirtless picture in the mirror flexing. He was like, Did he lay, have skinny bones Too? No, I was working out there as apparently a crime. This is why this was recent. This is why we were living in this house. I don don't understand why taking a pic. It's not like I uploaded it anywhere. I just kept it to myself. Yeah, that's even weird, man. What, you took a picture every morning flexing. He was like, it's called progress photos. You ever heard of it every morning? Yeah. No progress photos are like maybe every month. This man, every morning was like, I'll say I had morning routine. Those pictures I just laughed at Matt or Cash and Alex's reaction to him having a shirtless selfie every, it was like a part of his morning routine was taking his shirtless photo.


Wake up, take myself with my shirt and Then I Can his morning. I can't help it. I look better every day. Okay. Sometimes you just gotta like, it's just refreshing. Yeah. You alright Kate? Tell say what you found. Oh, anyways, so two weeks I, I was on his phone while he was sleeping. Okay. And two weeks before, I remember there was this one night I stayed up until five o'clock in the morning waiting for cash to call me. You were Way too deep. Five five. I had school the next day. No, I stayed up until 5:00 AM waiting for cash to call me because he had said, I'm on video games right now with my brother and my friends and I will call you when we were done. And I said, okay. So I stayed up until 5:00 AM lights in my bedroom on all night.


Okay. Forcing myself to stay awake, waiting for him to call me. This Is just so, so sad. Oh my God. Kate loves her sleep too Then. Yeah. No, I'm, it's a highly valuable thing to her. Yeah. So I'm waiting up. Okay. I remember this night 'cause I was pretty mad. I finally fell asleep. I was pretty mad that he never called. And then the next morning he text me, Hey sorry, I was just on games and then I fell asleep before I, before I called you. And I was like, dude, whatever. Okay. Go to his messages. And two weeks before that same night at 9:00 PM when he said, I will call you once I'm done with video games. He was texting another girl, do you wanna hang out? And he drove to her house and picked her up and hung out with her.


Oh No. All night. Okay. I'm sitting in my bed up until 5:00 AM Okay. You're in trouble at dude At 6:00 AM he drops the girl off back at her house and that's when he sends me the text. Hey, I'm sorry I fell asleep playing video games last night. Oh my gosh. Okay. So I'm mad Up. Lied. So Furious. I'm mad. I'm very mad. Okay. The fact, The fact I put two and two together is crazy. I, I'm mad Cass is sleeping so naturally, what do I do? Wait, Wait. Y'all married at this point? No. No. What? Two weeks into a day? Week in day. Two weeks into a Dating. Oh, okay. I was 15. Okay. Y'all married. This is not one of my proudest moments, but it shouldn't be one of yours either. So I roll over and I said, took my pillow.


I need a pillow. No, no, no, no, no, no. She comes in my room, takes my phone, does this. Then I don't even, I think I'm alone. And then she grabs a pillow and starts hitting me and then she like, stop what happened? This is so valid though. And so you deserved every bit of that. He wakes up from his sleep also. I not, I would kill him. I did not go into his room, take his phone out. I just did it next to him while he was sleeping. Okay. What? Anyways, so then I'm like very upset 'cause I find out this, this was just another thing that I felt I had been lied to about and he hadn't told me. Yeah. And he was like, oh I'm sorry. Like yeah. And I was like, okay, I'm sorry I went through your phone. He was like, You can ask me anytime you wanna say anything. And I was like, fine.


So ever since then I have not awoken in from a slumber by hitting The pillow. Yeah. I would've showed her then too. If she would've just simply asked. No, you don't get to talk. Hey, you know what y'all paint me to be this little bad picture man. Let's See if I Can find it. No. Painted your picture now you look at it. No. Lemme tell you something. Let me tell you something. No, I'm going. You're gonna talk. I'm looking Through your phone. You are a bad man. No, wait, don't look through my phone yet Kate. We'll get to that. Okay. Lemme say something about a scenario. Okay Al, I would be furious. See that's what I'm wanna To talk about it. Nobody has no right to be furious just because I said I would call you and didn't call but then picked up another girl. But then you lie about it and say, oh I fell asleep playing video when really you were with another girl. The lion's questionable. But everything else I was single.


It's like two lies because it's not like you forgot you were gonna call, you deliberately didn't call. You definitely saw her text, her calls, all that stuff completely ignored her. Yeah. All you have to do is shoot her a text and say, Hey, I can't call tonight. Hey I can't Call. I'm hanging out with another girl. Just have the truth. That's all you had to do. Who was that simple? Like I would, I would like be more happy if somebody said that I wouldn't want, unfortunately there's another girl that I'm about to make out with so I Can speak. Speak right now. Yeah. That's like crazy. I would be so mad. No, I just, okay. I Can leave you on speaker though if you wanna Okay, fine. Look through my phone. Kate, Can we go through each other's Phones? Yeah.

He says, I thought we were just gonna be friends with benefits. I know it's, she says I know it's friends with benefits but I feel like you have friends with benefits with a lot of other girls. Oh my God. That's crazy. And he did. You were correct to assume that my friend, She was on to me. Yep. So cash responds a couple but that's why it's called Friends with Benefits. A Couple.


It says I being a couple. I said that. That is great. I said that you said, I mean a couple what I was, I was truthful. I was Abraham. I cannot tell a lie bro. Did not lie. That Was a crazy thing to say. So let's see. Let's see what our friend responded when Cash said that. Like go off. That's when you should block somebody. Okay. A couple. A couple. Yeah A couple. But that's why it's called friend. I have a Just like you, you know. But like other than that She says, who You want me to name them that she's a crazy, she's gonna kill this. And Then she follows that up with, and I don't want to have friends with benefits and I thought I was more than that.


Oh thought spelled completely wrong by the way she said thought like a girl's a thought HT Anyways. Cash yourself. She said I thought, I thought I was more than that. I thought me, thought me. The thought here I was more than Okay cash proceeds to say why did I spell wrong? There's, this is a lot of incorrect spelling here. Listen, cash says yeah, I understand that. So if you don't wanna hook up now, no worries. Oh my gosh. Like he's just sort of honest. He's like, yeah, no I totally get where you're coming from.


If you're catching feelings that's fine. But if you don't I'm Like, if you don't wanna, If You don't enjoy being one of the four or five, I mean it's right. Get you off the roster.

She's giving you chance after chance. She's like, I know who wants me. I know. You know what Cash responds to that?


He sends A ball pool, A game of a ball pool Every, You're human. I've, that is insane. Okay, So then you just confessed, you're a girl. I've actually heard this story before, but seeing it real life Crazy. I've heard, I crazy know you said the girl eight ball pool. But like reading the messages like that is like, okay, so dating is Funny. Think about this Eight ball is brutal. I'm so listen, I behind the smiles right now. I'm so sorry to that girl. I should, I should apologize to her All, you should text her right now. Now you should reply to that message. I'm sorry for this eight ball pull down.


Like that is bad. Did she play Back you, would you like to know what happened? Oh yeah. Did she play me? So you were playing girl cash Follows up with, oops, sorry, I didn't mean to send that. Okay, well lemme tell you one little backstory to that. See your finger Slipped a game pigeon. Like what? No, lemme tell you the backstory to that. Michael Lamaya, the guy who edits all our shorts, you know, one of our best friends. I'm sitting there with him and I'm like, what? What should I text her back? I don't know what to do.

So then after that, after after he sent her eight ball pool to distract from the fact that she's literally being heartbroken, he then says, but I understand that completely. I just can't have a girlfriend right now. And then she doesn't even acknowledge the eight ball pool. She just says, I wouldn't either. I mean that's just disrespectful. I Don't understand how you can have friends with benefits and have a girlfriend. What? Wait. How You can have friends with benefits and if and not have a girlfriend. Oh okay.

Yeah. The amount of times I heard that man, okay, Cash responds he wasn't supposed to. And now that he did it, it makes everything hard for me. 'cause he isn't on work at all my, so it all falls on me. I'm a big social media star. My life is whore. She said cash. Absolutely. You understand? I need friends benefits.
