I have a least favorite part of the wedding. Ooh. It was when they were supposed to get in their car and leave like a fairytale ending.


I freaking sat in the back seat of that car with no AC on but like, I'm not even kidding, like I think I just won my taxes. Yeah, I just switched to h and r Block in about one minute. All I had to do was drag and draw blasters, return into h and r Block and bam, my information is automatically there so I don't have to go digging around for all my old papers to switch. Nope. Sounds like we just leveled up our tax game. Switching to h and r block is easy. Just drag and drop your last return. It's better with block.

Wait, He didn't like it. Did he Show his, did he show his face? Like He showed his face? Yeah. Yeah. He had a normal account like me and Cash. You could ask him, but you know, he's on the other side of the wall. He doesn't own Account. He sold, he sold his account. He did. He got rid of his TikTok with $11 million At one point. He woke up and he said, I'm not this guy. I Don't like It. This isn't me. And I don, this just isn't who I am anymore. I'm gonna sell my accounts Here. I think I just want to edit tiktoks.

Another girl's episode I guess. Yeah. Wait, are You leaving that painting on for every single episode now? I Really hope not. That was, It's another girl's episode. Yeah. Time To talk about the girly things.


Oh, Oh, I have a question about your eyelashes. Oh yeah. Do you put them on your eyelashes or do you glue it to your skin? I Put them like right at the base. But where do you put the glue on the skin? No, it's like right where the skin ends. Because if you put it on the lash, it's just gonna rip the lash out. Okay. And then you curl. That's why I curl it together to like make it blend. They look That way. They look so natural. I know. Kates Always look good. I've been mastering it since I was 16. Like literally ever since I was 16. I've been wearing lashes. 'cause when I started TikTok I was like, oh my gosh, all those TikTok girls wear false lashes. So I started, I don't see a Michael in your hand. So I don Why would they wanna come? Okay. Well You could have forced him. Wow. He really doesn't wanna come. Yeah, he threatened us. You're telling me Michael is stronger than the two of you combined?


No, he just weighs a lot. Okay. He just threatened us. Okay. What Did he say? What did he say? Well, Since we're employers, he was just like, you can't touch me or I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell the police. Like, you can't, you can't, you can't. You can. He's not gonna tell the police. You can't forcefully put me in here. He's Not talking to the police. He said, you can't forcefully put me in here, Michael. But he's also in my massage chair, which I don't wanna mess up. Maybe Since I'm a stranger and I go in there, maybe he, he will get so uncomfortable that he'll just come out. We were like, I'd love to try that. Me and a girls episode talk. Oh. Oh Really? Yeah. Guys, I've actually gotten good at putting my lashes on. I like put them on like every morning. Or not every morning, but like, I like try to do really fat. Yeah. Wow. I'm almost entertained. Yeah. Can not so easy. Wait, I wanna start. The last time I tried it was like two different eyelashes.


It was, it is hard to like figure out at first, but I've been doing it for so long. I figured it out. Carpet. What's Up? We're in the Middle of The girls. Don't. Yeah, I know you are and I can't take it. Don't, don't you don't. You wanna ask me something? Not at all. You don't Wanna ask you anything? Did anything new happen since? Like, anything you've seen him maybe. Anything At all? I mean, see you got anything? You, you got you. Your ring's a little big for your finger. What does Black ring fits? Great. Wait, our private question. Whose ring do you like more? Mavericks or Cass. Oh wow. It has black on it. I mean, Yeah, that's what I said. Yeah. Dingy. She said. Oh No.


Okay. It's supposed to. It's supposed to. We did pick a ring with black studs on it because we thought it looked cool. Wait, pull it Off and show her how circular it is. No. Okay. It shaped like An old, which one do you like better? Harper? I, yeah, I Mavs looks are really feminine, but Cassius looks like stuff That looks like they're showing up your nails. Yeah, you were. He was like mine. You know how like when girls forget a ring, they're like, ah, Ooh. Ah. That's what cash just pulled. He hit the, All I need is, lemme see your ring cash. Mav. I'm not gonna say anything, but that's the third person that said your ring looks feminine. No, that's just you. It's just like ring looks Feminine. Her who's the, who came in and she said, is it too girly? And you were like, because No, No, no. And he Was likes said that it's a man.


'cause he told me that you said it was Girly. So I was asking You to confirm, is it too girly? Is it girly? No, I'm just saying three people said the word girly and you're ring in the same sentence. At least my ring is a circle. You Think it's girly because it's shiny. Well you've been wearing it a week. Give it time. Lemme try. It's a circle. Yeah. Mine's not gonna move. Mines real sweetheart. Oh Yeah. That's not what yours is. Hold up, give it to me. Oh Yeah. If it's real, let's take a hammer to it. Yeah, it's literally hammered. That's the style. That's what it is. They hammered It. Wait, he was telling me that it's real. It it will not be misshapen. I mean it would take lot of pressure I think. Oh, but we Could do that. Yes.


One hammer, You can put it like into a clamp and like clamp. It would probably be no one hammer hit. And it Like, if we were to put it on the table and hit it with a Hammer. With the hammer. Yeah, probably. Well he, he got The thin band. What? It Might actually, I got the thinnest one. They had what? A cheap ring. How embarrassing. So embarrassing. You're gonna voice a cartoon character one day, dude. What? Yeah. Wreck it Ralph. I was Thinking That. What? Wreck it Ralph. Why? What about Penelope or whatever that Girl's name is? Penelope. Penelope. Wait. You can do a whole Like movie and do every single Character You could. You have so many voices. Stop that. See Harper. Is there anything you wanna ask Ma about? Fine.


How was the wedding that night? Well, You wouldn't know because you weren't there. You wouldn't know. 'cause you weren't there, were you? Oh. Did you have fun at homecoming though? Mm. We're not talking about homecoming right now. We're talking about my wedding. Your wedding. Well, we were Out there so we already all know what happened. But none of us were at homecoming. No, no, no. Homecoming is a different episode. Y'all Shared your's first kiss. We did. We did. That sounds weird. Don't say about that ever again. Please. Wait. You shared your first kiss. Me. She glitched at the altar when Matt Leaned in. She did. I did Glit. Like Penelope. It just wasn't, it didn't feel Like natural because we had never kissed before. So, oh, he came in and I Was like, okay, how do this now She stopped.


Was it scary? I don think anyone would be rightfully scared of Marick coming in. Like seeing Maverick. Matt gotten shot. Show us like you're, let's see if you get scared. You ready? Yeah. No, you come here. Come here. I'm good on this side of things, but show us that face. Listen. No. This is bull crap. No, there's no way I look good right now. There's absolutely no way I do this. And it doesn't get made too short and look horrible. No, no, no. Why Don't you kiss Kinzie and show us what you did. I, We can make out on the episode you want. I I bet he went in like this. I bet he went like Everyone's getting used tongue kinzie. No. I imagine the first kiss being like immature with tea is not being you.


Wait, wait. I don know I was off to the side. Like I did not get a view of the kiss at all. I got the, I got Kenzie's beautiful hair in the back of Kinzie's head. So did you see that Video trash took at the wedding? You know my viral one has like 20 million views. Did you see it? I'm Coming down the, he pulls his phone out. He's like, oh, hey bro, I'm sorry I go call you later. Yeah, kidney's coming down the aisle. She's walking the song's like, here come to brag. And and I take the Song out. That's not song. And I was like, Oh man, I can't talk right now. I'm kind of busy and I turned my camera around and she's just walking down the aisle. Wait, what, what, what account is it on? Cash. My baby, my personal. It was, it was insane. I was flipping out before. Oh my gosh. Yeah. What you guys did not funny. See funny is I told Kate my plan of what I was gonna do.


I was flipping out right before we all walked out to do the wedding. 20 million Views. I think it has 12 million views. Oh, She humbled you. But, and that's Okay. Right as we walked out, I told Kate what we were gonna do. So I'm standing with like all the groomsmen. Kate's standing with all the bridesmaid Kenzie's coming down the aisle. It's intense. Kate looks over at me if she knows this is my time to shine when Kenzie's walking down the aisle. It's Not. That's exactly what it's not is cash. Baker's time to shine when the bride is walking down the aisle. And Kate looks at me, she goes, don't do it. But before this told him no, like a hundred times. Oh yeah. And I was like, I Was like shaking. I was so mad. Yeah. She was like, don't do it.


And I was like, okay, I'm gonna have to not look at Kate while I do this. And when I found out I did it and I just didn't look at her for the rest of the Way. Yeah. He did not make eye contact with me. I was so mad. I was more concerned. But to be fair, I had told cash like 17 times. I was like, absolutely not. You cannot do that. That is not okay. And then he turns to Mav and he goes, Maverick, do you think this is okay? And Mav Wass like, I guess so. Yeah. So I told Mav, I said, it is your wedding. It is up to you if I do this or not. No. And he was like, no, you wait. No, you make, you gotta change. No, you waited until Kate was gone. I'm about to walk down the aisle. You walk up to me, you're like, listen. Last chance. Last chance. Okay. Listen man, it does. No, I said, last chance to back out. I was like, if you don't want me to film this video, if you think Kenzie's gonna get mad, You can tell me I won't Film it.


No. Was out there when you turned, when you asked him. 'cause I, it was upstairs before like we all lined up. He asked Ma I was there when you were like, yeah, fuck it Didn't matter. Saw mad Garrett. And then Garrett pulled me aside 'cause I was so mad. And he was like, listen, if he wants to do it at his wedding, he's, he can just let him. Garrett pulled you herself. He literally was like, if Kinzie gets upset, she's not gonna be upset at you. I was like, okay. Kate cared about herself. I care how kids are getting upset. But once Maverick had said, go ahead and do it, Garrett was like, well if Mavs saying it's fine, there's nothing You can do, Kate. So, yeah. Yeah. It was unfortunate for me. 'cause I was like so mad because I didn't want Kenzie to be upset.


And Ken, did Jason know you doing this? Were were you doing, you upset Kenzie? No, but I would've been upset if you would've waited till I was like At the Archer. Wait, everybody be quiet. Who?

Okay, well since you are at the wedding, you know what else happened? Oh Wait, I wanna know was did my sister say anything? Did she object or did she just let it be? I We didn't ask your sister. Oh, I don't Was Jason, she would be so mad. She Would, very mad TikTok. It was all the groomsmen and then just me trying to convince him. 'cause all the bridesmaids were still in the suite or something. You know what A viral TikTok would be if somebody objected from the crowd? Or like, if I was in the crowd and I said I object before they kissed. That's what I wanted to do. I wanted, when they said that I wanted to be filming my video and be like, I do. But they don't ask that at weddings anymore. Apparently I never got that opportunity. Oh. Oh, you were gonna take it though. Maybe. Okay. The risk we're gonna have to take. Well, just like life advice to anybody going to a wedding.


Don't object. Just Maybe you should Hold your piece. Should, should've said something before she walked down the aisle. Yeah. Sometimes it's your only chance you live outta town. Your only chance is when they are about to say I Do. But what actually happened, God is they, they made like their entrance to like the, the, what's that called? Oh my goodness.

Well y'all Weren't supposed to do your first dance right after Yeah, we were. No, The DJ was supposed to wait until the dances After dinner Dance were supposed to have after dinner and DJ the floor.

There was someone there to clean The floor, cleaning people floor.


There was someone There clean the of those floor. Because this thing is always nasty, man. Now there was someone there who was supposed to clean the floor after the bridal party's entrance. 'cause there was napkins and like bubbles everywhere. But then the second ma McKinzie get downstairs instead of like doing what he was supposed to do. The DJ was like first dance when they were not supposed to do their first dance. And they were like, okay, I guess we'll dance Even know he announce What? No, he Did. Did he even announce it? He did. Okay. I Don't remember. I just know that you guys were not supposed to dance right after the entrance. Yeah. I have a least favorite part of the wedding. Ooh. It was when they were supposed to get in their car and leave like a fairytale ending. I freaking sat in the backseat of that car with no AC on for like, I'm not even kidding.


Like 40 minutes. Oh Wait. Also the DJ's fault because we had to redo our last dance like four times. What? Yeah. What? That's what took you guys so long? Yeah, We were all sitting outside like, what This Is he couldn't get the song. Wait, what do you mean mean you had to redo it? He couldn't find the, he had the wrong song. Oh my gosh.

And he But you can It on. No, no. That sounds bad. You guys guitar? No, no, no, no. It's just the guitar. A Striped person. You guys stripping and I was sitting in the car. Yeah, sorry about that man. Yeah, but you know what we were actually, you're lucky you sat in the car though.


You, I mean you're lucky. I I drove you back up to the front. 'cause I thought about driving to the end of the street and then just kicking you out there. Man. We should done, yeah, they sat, they were doing their last dance or whatever for like 45 minutes. We're all outside. Yeah, I'm, I hunkered down in the backseat of their car. Sweating badly. Okay. But y'all have to keep in mind. Ma did the same thing at our wedding. He got In the Backseat of Our car. That was funny. Yeah. And I was like, I don't think Maverick's gonna remember that he did that at my wedding. So I'm gonna do it to him. So I sit back there waiting for them to get in the car so I Can scare them. And then they get in the car and the second they sit down, they go, they sure they took off was, sorry. Lemme tell you man, what it Was like the second the door closed, they were like, Yeah, this man was ready to get home. He was not happy after the wedding actually.


Really? I left my fast With my mom. Whoa, whoa. First We had to circle back around for you and then we left and I was like, I don't have my passport. And he was like, we gotta get the passport. And then we Went to the, it was all taken care of. Someone was like supposed to bring it to the Airbnb for y'all. No, that did not happen. No, that was to, I, We had to run around till like midnight getting the passport shut up. It was like another 45 wedding. Wait, so on y'all's 40 nights your guys' wedding night, Kenzie didn't have a passport. You were running around for a passport? Well, because We had to leave the next morning at like 4:00 AM to get to the airport. We got no sleep that night. Oh, I bet. Yeah. Anyways, Literally up all night looking for a passport.


Passport is only 40 minutes. What? Okay. Okay. Anyways. Wow. So so after the wedding, you guys got in the car, you said we're married. It's our, it's our wedding night in June. Let's go look for the passport. We gotta go find The passport. That's gonna happen. No, on top of that, I want y'all to know that we completely fumbled the bag and I was so irritated. I don't know why we didn't think of this sooner. I guess it was just one of those things that like you have to make a mental note to yourself for, but like we never did that. Right? What? But when the bride and groom are getting in their car to drive away, it's the bridal party's responsibility to get all of their belongings and put it in the car for them. Oh No, no, no. I told Are you talking about the grooms?


No, the bri the bridesmaids. We didn't even think about it. I didn't. I didn't. I put, I told two of my grooms where my stuff was and I told them, I said put it all in a past, all this goes in the car, everything right here gotta be in the car. Oh my God, Steve. Then I sent them to put it in the car. Yeah. Before the thing. I got a story about that one. Oh, okay. Matt hands me his phone to turn on his car and he's like, Hey, go pull the car around and everything. What? And do all this. What do you mean there's a story? Yeah. And I go, I was like, ugh, I'll just have Alex and the other Grumen do it. 'cause I was busy. So I go over to Alex playing Poker. Were you busy playing poker? Alex, Michael and Zach. And I was like, guys, ugh guys, I'm going to trust you with something. And I probably should never, those words should probably never come outta my mouth.


But I was like, I'm gonna trust you guys with pull Matt's car around. That's it. I just need you to grab his car and park it in front of the door. That's it. Flat out. And they were gone like 25 minutes. And I was like, what? And so I go out there and they literally are still parking the car And They're still parking it like this. And they're like, it took a minute, but we got it. And I was like, guys, it's backwards. They parked the car where Kenzie would have to go around the car and my has to open it and then we gotta do the other way. And they Were like Serious. They were like, oh, we had to think about that Was like, Just gimme that.


Yeah. That has nothing to do with my stuff though. That I sent you to get, Did they not put it in There? No, I sent them to get my stuff. Oh, we didn't put that in there. No, we didn't put, Nobody told you. Oh my gosh. Y'all should have literally someone you should have told me. And then if you would've told me, I would've been aware and been like, shoot, we gotta get Kinzie's stuff. Because literally like the second, Well you didn't know where my stuff was. I put all my stuff in like backed up and everything. My shoes that I needed. Everything right there. Yeah, No, Because you look entertained. Yeah, I am. No, Too bad. You missed the wedding. Rochelle Was Like, Rochelle Told me, she was like, cash, can you go pull the car around? And then I was standing there and I was like, I looked to your sister and I was like, jc, we didn't get any of Kinzie's stuff.


And she was like, oh my gosh. And so all of us bridesmaid's like run up to the bridesmaid suite and like Kenzie has nothing for her wedding night. She doesn't have a bag, she doesn't have her phone, she doesn't have a wallet. It's all at Airbnb Already? No, you still have all your stuff in the venue that you needed though. Your phone, your water Wallet, All of it. All this stuff that Kenzie needs. And none of us remembered to get it. And so we're all running around upstairs. You guys Were bustling. We Were literally like sprinting and like, we were like looking around the the suite and we were like, what stuff is kenzie's and what's not? And so finally I was like, okay, frick it. I grabbed your phone and like your water and I put it in the car and I was like, we'll just take the rest later. Because Like my water, I forgot my, my phone honestly. But my water, I was like begging for it after our last dance.


I was like, my water, somebody please get my water. I need my the car. Sorry. No, no, no. It's a good thing. Oh. 'cause Mary's like, you do not need it to go on the trip to Dominican. You don't need your water bottle. And I was like, no, I need my water bottle. Yeah. Wow. Well, well you guys are officially married. Life's crazy now that we're married now, is there anything that's been different since y'all have been married? Yeah, We sleep in that little room together. Wait, did y'all not Used to?

I don, I don about say in it. Trying To think other things we do together. It's kind of normal for G and Kate. 'cause like cash is just like farting in the bathtub. But like, Dude, I do be farting in the bathtub. I will not lie. No, it's just, I, what did I say a couple months ago? Kenzie was like, I was like, Kenzie just, I don't know, it seems inappropriate to say anything about Kenzie, about her getting married.


Like you, you should not be showering with a man. Kenzie, thank you. What The, yeah, like think about me getting older and showering with a guy that's, whoa. No, We're not thinking about that. Nobody thinking about that. We'll see you next time. So this thing is making my butt crack crack man.
