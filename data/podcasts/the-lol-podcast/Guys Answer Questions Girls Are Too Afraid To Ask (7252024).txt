This is full of questions that all of the girls in the world want to know, but they're too scared to ask guys. So kids, Where did you get these questions?


Yeah, Kenzie, And. I took it upon ourselves to come up with them. You made, you made them up and Harper? Yeah. And me. Did you come up with any? Yeah. Oh I did. I came up with some too. But I don't think y'all put mine in there. Nope. Why would you come up with questions? Girls are too afraid to ask guys. 'cause I, I know what girls are too afraid to ask me. 'cause they haven't asked me these questions and I've been waiting for them. Look at them. Okay, well can you give us one of those questions real quick? Yes. Which one would you like? No, Don't because I actually did put a couple of your, I did put a couple of your in here. Wait, You wanna put Mine in there? I put A couple. Okay. Okay. Well let's see what Mav has. Okay. No I mean before the jar opening. Well, well what questions I have? Yeah, please enlighten us.


Are you scared? I don't. Are You scared of? Period. That's what you're gonna ask. Really? Mav very mature of you. Oh, don't ask that. Are you sure? I'm positive. Harper. Are You scared of periods And kind and would never ask that? Well, I Okay. Okay. Ask it. You've been waiting 'cause a girl are just going to ask that Are I. don know if he Actually should. Okay. Maverick. We have a very young audience. Okay. Ask, can we talk about, Matt's gonna ask this questions bleeped? Yes. I'm very sorry. Okay. Okay. So here it goes. I've never had a girl ask me this and it's been a concern of mine. Why I'm scared is would you go swimming in the ocean with a girl on her period? No, because she, that's valid because sharks smell blood and I'm not trying to die.


No, that's valid. Doesn. That's valid. Doesn't stop in the water. No. Do you? No. Not. Would you go swimming with a grown, but would you even go swimming with No. Would you? Yeah. So would you? Yeah. What The, that's dangerous? No, Not one's. You don't think that's dangerous? No. Because you're not just like, Maybe that's why most shark attack victims are women. Oh, That's not bey. Hamilton was on pb. That Makes a lot of Sense. No, I don't think that's what That was. Harper Is that an accurate statement? Did you just make that up? No, I just made that up. She just completely made that up. So no one wants to answer. No, I Already said I would go into the ocean because you're not just like, I think it's fine, But like, I like me personally. Like if even if I just have like a little cut on my wrist, I'm gonna be like, Hmm.


I don't know. I don't wanna risk that. No, but you're not actually like, that's different because there's blood on your hand. And. it is like literally going into the water. When typically when you're swimming, you're using a tampon. Okay. I I don't even know the details, sweetheart. Well, you asked, You asked open the dog second question. No, I have no one I didn't on there. That's good. I think your questions are d Great, great. Can they just be done? No. Kate has so many good questions. So real quick before he says that, can you guys comment down below if you want me to bring back the megaphone? No. and I'm gonna, I'm gonna read the comments and if people say they want the megaphone back, he has to get at least 20,000 lights to bring the microphone back. 20,000 likes. Yeah. It has to be like, top comment with that many likes to get the megaphone back. Nobody. Maybe 20,000 is absurd.


I can't wait to see how many dislikes. The comment. Oh my gosh. Okay. Yes. Everyone comment down below if I should you the megaphone, but whatever the top comment is, everybody please like that comment. 20,000 likes to bring back the megaphone. Okay. And if it gets, and if it gets 20,000 dislikes, then I'll never bring it back. Okay, listen, All, right? So please, please, here's my second question. Go. Please go. Like the comment that girls have never asked me as a guy, do you prefer to hang out with tampon girls or pad girls? Maverick. What? What that dude, why does it make any Sense? You're just weird. What? Oh, and I. Oh, they're different kinds of girls. He's already said, he's already said this. Well, I think that The one I know we've had this conversation. They're feisty. That's literal what you said. No. Yeah. I think pad girls are just a little more adventurous.


They like to get out and do more. Oh hey. He said day. They're a little less stuck Up. Okay, Now we're done. Okay. My joke, maths just weird. I think everyone would rather listen to the megaphone than listen to you talk anymore. Yeah. I, I'm saying the megaphone needs to be brought back before we start talking like, yeah. Okay. Would you be a Tam girl? It gives off, it gives off the Where's my hug guy? I'm telling you. No, you just sound like you're a little stuck up. No, see everyone, everyone's fey this episode.

Did play Softball. You did. I never did. Well first of all, how do you even test us Softball's like a freaking 10 person sport. Yeah. Don don't know a way to test It.

We actually do actually wiffle ball style. Actually no. Wh ball. No. It's very easy actually if we, we just need one more guy and they need one more softball player.


And then it's easy. You can have a pitcher, an outfielder, and just somebody on one of the bases. I ain't gonna lie. And I haven't touched a softball in like four years, so I'm not Do you have any scary softball stories? Not to me, but like, I've seen some pretty, pretty, You saw some things out there?

And keep watching if you wanna hear the rest of that story. Yeah. Okay, let's Continue. I would say the worst thing I watched was one time when you're a pitcher, you're supposed to wear like a face mask, but not all of them do. Oh no.


And you know, they're pretty close. So, but yeah, the girl just got like drilled in the face, And it knocked her out and she was bleeding all over the field. And It, it knocked her out. She got the girl hit the ball, she pitched the ball, the girl hits it with the back, comes back, hits her in her face, knocked her out blood all over the field. Ambulance came and took her off The ambulance. What? Go? She was Not 70 miles per hour ball. That's going towards your face. Yeah, it is pretty. It is Rough. Oh, that's funny. She thinks women can hit 70 mile an hour. I have too many stories to even tell it. Probably Can't. That was the worst. I had no clue what the hitting mile That was like. The scariest one to me. I've seen. Wait, how fast do y'all, like how fast that ball coming out? How fast it Go? Like 60. Yeah. 60 Told You to the bat. To the bat. Well, once by the time it gets there, it's probably about 60.


When she first pitches it, it's probably a little quicker. Yeah. Yeah. And then when they hit it with the bat. But like when you put a radar on Off the bat, how? Yeah. don don't Know. I don't think they never measure that. Yeah. It's not like baseball. It's like a hundred, a hundred plus. I don't think that's like a thing. You can measure it. Yeah. All I hear Is like pitch speed. Yeah. Yeah. Well, can I tell a story? Wait, do you have a horrifying story? You have stories? Okay. Well I have quite a few stories. My batteries just, I'll You quick and I'll say one That was like really crazy. Really crazy. I've seen several people break their bones and like the bone sticking out. Oh, that's Crazy. No way.

I've seen that before. That was crazy. Oh my gosh. The one time we had a catcher, she didn't have her mask on. They were just practicing and the pitcher threw the ball and she turned her head at the last minute to talk to somebody because she didn't realize it hit her right in between the nose and the eye socket shattered her eye socket broke her nose. Her nose was like on the side of her face. Oh No. That was picked. Yeah. I, one time I was, when, when I was younger, probably like 12.

That's crazy. Wow. What That So you No longer have a crush on him then? No. I mean now that he likes my sister. It's just, And you found out he sleeps with a bonnet? Yeah. I mean, I find that pretty cute. Oh, Oh my gosh. You like bonnet guys? You hear that Guys? No, no. I was start sleeping With bonnet girls. Like Bonnet saying, I like when he sleeps. Oh, because you watch him. That makes sense. I do that too. Yeah. I watch him Watch, watch Parker like Creeping out the door watching me.


I'm not gonna lie, when I'm walking on somebody sleeping, I do look at 'em for a second. I'm like, look at 'em. They're just so like off. That's crazy. Just Power off. They're just not on like, no, not vulnerable. That's the wrong thing off. They're just literally off. Like, they're not my favorite. Somebody like literally took the batteries outta of like, favorite. And you walk in And, it's like, holy cow, they're Turned off. My favorite thing to do is like, just look at cash when he sleeps, because he sleeps like, like if this is the bed, he is like, and he is always got some sort of drool, like coming out. And then he, he will be like, he like breathes honey. Hey, that's fine. Kate's new favorite thing when she goes to bed without me, I walk into coming to bed. Her new favorite thing is to wake up and just tell me how mean and rude I am.


That's, that's what she does. I come to bed. I, I try to sneak in there quietly. I get in bed. I, I, as soon as she does, as soon as I lay down, I lay down and pull the cover over. And she goes like, I you are so mean. You're so I mean me mean, I'm so mean. And I'm like, what the freak dude? And she just, then she goes back To sleep. I was pretty mad the other night because for some reason when like, I have to be up early and I know I have to be up early. Like, you know, you can't fall asleep, obviously. But if cash is laying in bed, like I'll fall asleep quicker. But when he is not, it just takes me forever. So I was mad because I had to be up early, but he wasn't coming to bed so I couldn't fall asleep. And, it was just gonna take even longer. And the same thing happened two nights in a row. And the next night, I know I, She didn me have it the next night I was pretty mad.


And the thing is, is that I was dead asleep. I was so dead asleep. and I woke up to yell at him about how I couldn't sleep. Yeah. She wake up, she said, you're so mean. I can't sleep. And you know what you're doing to me And it so mean doing. And now I'm awake and look what you did to me going back to bed. I'm like, the fuck, you just woke up just to say that. Now you're out again. This morning I woke up and Cash We have these like new, like, literally like skin color sheets. Like they're literally just like a color like this. And cash is like wrapped up in it, like a butterfly and a cocoon. And he looked like literally a sausage link with a head on it. Like What?

That's what I'm saying. No, I, I'm sleeping at night. She's like, I hear sausage with a head on it. I'm like, what?
