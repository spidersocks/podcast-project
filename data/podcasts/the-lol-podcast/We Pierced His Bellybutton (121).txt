Why did y'all do that? Why did I do that? You started it. We had simple demands. All right. Since that happened, now you have to put a whole jellyfish in your mouth and, and like, and like eat it for 10 seconds. You are trying to get me sick. That jellyfish has literally algae all over it. That jellyfish is crazy. Since You do that, you have to get, you have to get the jellyfish. Put it in your mouth for 10 seconds. That's all I'm waiting for.

He instigates the whole thing and then proceeds to bully the rest of the No, No, no. Y'all are, first off, instigation is an art. Okay. Second, You can never blame the instigator. They never technically did anything. I didn't do anything. I Think if there's one person at fault here, it Would be nobody to blame but Me think it would be you. No. Yep. What did I do? I did nothing. You demanded cash drink jellyfish water After he lost his own game And then you, and then you pulled out a very powerful water gun and threatened him with it. And then you just waited.


Did I Ever shoot anyone? No. You just waited until someone else did. You provided everything. No, he poured the pond water on Kenzie causing her It slipped hand to be forced. It slipped. She had to shoot. I dropped it. I dropped it. I didn't mean to pour It on her. I think it all could have been avoided if Maverick didn't bring pond water and a powerful water gun to set. That's possibly true. That's, that's probably, that's accurate. Okay. But I did, and it's not my fault if I bring some things and you guys happen to just cause chaos. That's not my fault. How is that my fault? It's like bringing drugs to a party. Yeah. And if someone does 'em, it's not you. No, I'm kidding. That's a joke.


It's only member Baker is okay with drugs. You wanna here First? No. No. Just the ones cash takes on his nightstands. The vitamins? Yeah. What? He likes them vitamins. I do. I eat a lot of vitamins.
