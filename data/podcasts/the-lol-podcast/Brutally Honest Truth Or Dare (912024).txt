That's the only except Oh, it's 1111. Gotta post on my Snapchat story. Do you still do that? I didn't know. People still like, No, it's not like very private story. I might add you If you're lucky. Do You'll Add you? She said I might, I might add you. Sometimes I'll add you. Maybe If you're cool enough, you just keep it up. You might get at. Okay, fine. I honestly, I will add you because you are lowkey my friend. Very Only on the lowkey though. I'm lowkey I'm Lowkey friend.


But that's crazy because I'm on the story because Everyone else is a co I'm I'm a coworker In front of everyone here. Kate, I added you. Thanks. I Needed that. And also you're also pinned. Thanks. I am pinned in Harper's messages too, but I'm like the last person. Well, these things are kind of disgusting. Honest. Wait, Wait. So I'm pinned in your iMessages I'm pinned on Snapchat, but I'm not good enough for the story. I just added you, You just added you. When Did you make this story? It was about like a year ago. Wow. No, but there's only 15 people on it. Power break is One thing. My egos another. I'm actually scared of what goes on that story. I, I I, I I post everything.


Everything. I have a question. Yes. Gosh, This Is so embarrassing. I'm about to admit this. It's okay. Have you ever like, made a private story for just like one person? I have. Like, I have Kate. I mean, like, I, I have like with girls that I wanna hang out with. I'm like, does anybody wanna hang out with me? But There's more than one person in there. Yeah. Oh, But you never, she's talking more like, you wanna get a guy, you a story with just a guy on there. No. So he'd see your thing. I know people would do that. I made a private account and acted and see, see I, I made a private account this like blonde girl and like acted like it was Coco Quinn. And, 'cause nobody knows who Coco Quinn is, like, like in my grade. And so, except for like, the people that are fan fans of her.


And so I texted this guy that I liked and I was like, Hey. Or I, I made my snap score really high on it. And then I said, Hey, aren't you and Harper a thing? And then he was like, no, what? And then that's when I knew my answer. Wow. Wow. You Went to go find out yourself like that? Yeah. Okay. I was like, whenever cash. 'cause you know, everyone knows that cash treated me like literal garbage. Whoa. So I was like, whoa. You know what? Whoa. It's Dumb of the earth. Yeah. I'm gonna, Whoa, whoa. I was like 12. No, you were like 15 or 16. Hey was Don't be mean to him. I was like, I'm gonna get his, you know, since he's ignoring my text, I'm just gonna like post some my private story for him to see.


But I didn't have anyone else to put in the private story. So it was a private story with just cash. And I would post in it. And then it was really humbling when I would post and he wouldn't even see what Was Cash. Do you feel manipulated? I feel Are you getting angry? Do you feel manipulated? I do. You do? I do. Yeah. You're angry. I Can see you. He's turning the hole. I'm mad at that case. Oh my goodness. That made me mad. Oh no, he's mad. I'm mad. Oh no. Oh my gosh. No. I'm mad. My sister wants Oh, why I'm mad you put a dip in the wall. Ow I Can hurt your hand. Ow.


It's bleeding. Make you mad again. I Can, I can't. What doing, dude, first Of all, if you're gonna punch the wall, at least punch it normal. Why'd you punch it?

Stella than Maverick. I know that Stella is just a dog. Everyone keeps telling me that. But I do love her like a child. But if, if I'm gonna marry Maverick, you're supposed to love your husband more than your children Or your dogs. But you're not married yet. So who do you love more? Well, actually y'all will probably, no, you won't be married by the time this comes out. So you're not married yet. So we, We might be. Yeah, we've been talking about just doing a little courthouse thing. Oh, shut. You know, Actually no, we haven't talked about that. We're not yet. Would y'all actually, I said let's just do a courthouse wedding thing and then we can have an actual wedding like a couple months later. Why do you wanna do that? Just, you know, It loses the specialness For what reason? What would be, what would be the reason of that? So that way we can combine bank accounts?


'cause she's rich. Mm. You got trust fund. What? Like how, how did that even happen? No one even touched it. Guys. I'm really sad about that tv. 'cause I think we all know our finances and we can't afford a new tv. I Can, I Can buy a new one for y'all. Kenzie. Can't afford it. I have about $15 in my bank account and that's all. So Maverick's getting nothing. Many, Many. Spend it all on Stella. We can't. Guys make sure you re-watch this episode. Watch, watch all the way through. Guys, we gotta keep the lights on.
