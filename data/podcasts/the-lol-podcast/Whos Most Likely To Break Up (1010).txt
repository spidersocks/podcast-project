It was like he knew what my ear was. He literal? It Was before, after it came outta your butt. He was never near my butt. Okay.


Oh. So when People joke about being a little OCD, I wish they knew what it's really like to live with OCD because it's nothing like the stereotypes where the people need their room to be clean. OCD is a serious condition that can take over your life and become totally debilitating. Like it did for me. When I was in fourth grade, I started having these disturbing, unwanted thoughts I couldn't shake and feeling like I had to do certain actions to make the fear and anxiety go away from those thoughts or go away to keep bad things from happening to the people I love. Even though it didn't work in the long run and the thoughts just kept coming back. That's what OCD really is. But I didn't know that back then. I had no idea what OCD was. And I didn't know OCD could focus on anything. But it often latches on to the things we care about with most. Like our relationships, families, values and identities. I just knew something wasn't right. So I went to therapists after therapists for help, but they didn't get it because none of them specialized in OCD. And that's why I wanna tell you about NOCD. NOCD provides specialized therapy, the right kind of care for OCD. And when you get the right kind of care, OCD is highly treatable with NOCD. You can do virtual therapy with a licensed therapist who specializes in OCD so they understand exactly what you're going through. An OCD therapists use exposure and response prevention or ERP therapy. It's a type of therapy that was specifically designed for OCD and is considered the gold standard. They also accept many major insurance plans to make it more affordable. And since dealing with OCDD doesn't stop when your therapy session ends and OCD makes sure you'll, you're never alone between sessions. You'll have access to their powerful and app support. If you think you might be struggling with ooc D and want to learn more about the therapy with N ocd, go to n ocd.com and schedule a free 15 minute call with their team. That's n ocd.com to learn more and book a free call.
