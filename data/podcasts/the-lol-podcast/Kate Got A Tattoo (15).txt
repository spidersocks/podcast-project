You Know the answer. Kate likes reading books and getting tats. Man, that's the two thing Kate likes. Whoa. She does like tattoos. No, I don't do Are you Tattoo girl? No, I don't. You found her tattoo the other day? Oh my gosh. Harper did.


I found her tattoo yesterday. I was like, what is that? Harper Got so scared when she saw my tattoo for the first time. I feel like we gotta explain the story real quick for the people that don't know. Fine. Okay. That was aggressive. Fine. When I was 15 years old, I went to the Herbie Larbie and I stole No, no start from the beginning. Kate was a menace at 15. You sold she she was stealing things. She was tatting herself up, tatting other people and literally robbing stores. Yep. So she was bound to head a life full of crime in prison. Yep. I was made for prison Anyways, I went to the, I went to the Herbie Luby. What's that? And Hobby Lobby. Oh. And I went and I sold You work on your back.


Yeah, that was, that was millennial court right there. Harper was like, oh, okay. Sure. Herbie Urby, come here. No, that do you guys don't get it back. Okay. Okay. Continue your story. So we went, I stole a little thing of Indian ink and I got a sewing needle. What's happened? And I feel as if no one's listening to me. No, we're Listening. Don't you worry about that. You're gonna suction your spine out. Your Your spine is gonna be pulled out. The chill Lego. I'm Oh Yeah. Ew. That might work. Oh, that's gross. Fix This button. I'm not big enough. Yeah. Not working. Continue. So I found out about stick and pokes when I was a freshman or sophomore in high school.


You know, stole a thing of ink from Hobby Lobby. And then I took a sewing needle, you know, like a needle that's pointy. I wrapped thread around it and you dipped it in the Indian ink, which is literally like black ink, but it's permanent. And you poke your body with it and you poke it with the thread on it. With the sewing needle. Yeah. I feel like there Had to have been, please Stop giving kids instructions. The thread was there to like collect the ink. You like put a ball of thread on the end and that's where the ink was like in. And you Put that in your Skin. Yeah. You like poked it just enough to give yourself like a tattoo. Stop Giving her instruction. Harper was like taking notes. And then what step number four again? It hurt Very bad. I gave multiple people these stick and poke tattoos and we were told that they were gonna go away after six months.


They start to fade. They don't fade. That's not good. So yeah. Kate, have you ever wanted to get a tattoo on your lip? Right here? I, oh, I tried to give myself a lip tattoo by myself. Are you kidding? Stick And one, how many tattoos did you get? I Don't mean give one to yourself. I mean, go to a tattoo shopping. Get the Oh, LL.

Oh, the dentist's over here getting like underground tattoos. Freaking, Yeah.


I was giving, I was running a, an illegal tattoo parlor. Well, now that you My bedroom. Well now your first job was at an illegal tattoo parlor. I was the only, it was the only job I've ever worked. You owned The illegal tattoo? I was, I was, I was the owner management manager and artist management. And the artist is crazy. I was a momager. Yeah. So I gave lots of people these tattoos. Anyways, six months go by and they're not fading. And here we are five and a half years later and they still have not faded. They're Very not faded. Like they still look like a fresh tattoo. No, that's not true. True. Is that true? Okay. Okay. Maybe she got like stuff Tooken off. I'm, I'm, I'm now in the process of getting them removed with like a laser and it doesn't feel very good. I have two. I've never seen your tattoos, so you're never Going to, This laser hurt worse than the Tattoo did.


I mean, neither one of them felt good. I would say I would honestly, the la the laser removal is a little bit less painful than the actual tattoo because the tattoo was so slow and just, it was like poke p it was like con consistent Because it wasn't a real tattoo gun. Yeah. It was just like poking your skin with a sewing needle over and over, over and over again. You did It to yourself. Did you go far Into Yeah, I had one, one of my friends did one of them and the other one I did myself. Oh. I could not do that to myself. So no, the one that I did myself, I got halfway through it and I stopped. So I have half a tattoo. Oh. Oh my God. A tattoo. Yeah. But I'm getting them removed and like the laser is, you Didn't even remove. Do you regret them? A hundred percent. I would, if I could go back and tell my 15-year-old self one thing, it would be don't give yourself a tattoo and don't give your friends tattoos.


I Remember I wanted to give like my, this finger right here, a little cross or a heart on. Don't, Don't, don't I don No, wait until at the bare minimum. Wait until you're 18. But even at that, most of the people we know that got tattoos right when they turned 18, don't love them. Yeah. Like I don, I don't know very many people that are like, oh, I'm like really happy with this, you know? Yeah. Some people are, but like, most people regret the one they got when they were 18. But yeah. So I'm getting it removed. Pap Pap got, do you have a Tattoo you regret? No. Oh, okay. But I got It when I was 18. Well, I guess go get tatted up then.

Dude, I watched it and I almost started like tearing up Loki. Who says that about me? Like those guys are amazing dude.


Like they're amazing. Like I'm just spreading kindness out in the world and they're over here doing things. But you know what? It's okay. You know what's funny about that episode? What? When the yard talked about us, they were like, they're in a warehouse. Yeah. They're like, they're clearly in a professional warehouse or something like that. Trying to make it look like they're in a house. Yeah. This is our house. I'm not even kidding. Mass bedrooms right there. I think they know. They just saw you climb next to our Christmas tree. Yeah. Yeah. Trying to get staged. Like those guys were very committed. They got fake gifts at all. Just No. Like those guys had like a whole like yard and it was really cool. That wasn't a real yard. We could tell. Yeah, We can tell it's in a warehouse grass. We could tell that was not a real yard and it was in a warehouse. I'm not gonna lie that their set was kind of cool.


It Is kind of cool though. But I mean that one guy was like, we should Competition called like the porch or something. Maybe We should just copy their set or The garage Copy. The air set. The garage would be like cool. Like the garage would be Garage. Oh wait. Garage in. Garage. The Garage. Having a podcast in the garage and calling it the garage is just like, That's almost as bad as having a podcast called the yard and makeup picture. Whoa. That is shots fired. Kate, you talked bad about me first. You are really holding this today. That different. She's tatted up at all. I wouldn't mess with her. Yeah, I got tats. Honestly. The yard ex-convict over there. No, the yard con. I'm confused 'cause everyone keeps saying the yard talked bad about us. No they didn't, but they didn't really, They honestly were kind Of, it wasn't That bad.


They just tried to make it sound like we were some freaks or something. And just because Harper a 15, We thought to have a podcast with a 15-year-old and you didn't doesn't make us freaks. Well, when you say it like that, it kind of does. So I don't know. Joey locked up in our houses, not make us freaks'. Always welcome to our home where we also film. Just because we hold her hostage does not mean her. And I'm locked in this room until I'm out. Like that does not make them freaks guys. Yeah, Seriously. But you know, it does make someone a freak wearing jts. No, that's not true. Take that back. Wow. Full circle. Thanks for watching guys.
