Like the, the latex on that dog's body is running thin. I'm so mad. Oh, we know. And We can talk about it after the episode. I Really don't understand why we can't vaguely talk about it. Then The video's gonna get more and more views. Harper. You gotta stop making videos with people. That's, I do. That's it. Okay. You gotta start barking at them.


Sue Him. Sue him. Hey, I actually, I have something I was meaning to bring up on our next podcast episode. What? What's up, up? It's day? The economy? No, we were cash and I were in the car the other day and we're talking about our future house and like things we wanna have when we build our future house. What am I at your future house? Absolutely Not. Oh, so actually that is not Right going, oh, I know where, know where this story's going. This bull crap. No, so I open up, so we're talking about something and he is like, oh, I have a note on my phone. Open it. I'm not at the house. No. So he's like, open up the note and add that to the list. And I was like, why? And he was like, well, we're gonna forget little details like that if we don't write him down.


So I was like, okay. So I open up his notes app and there is only one thing he has on his no List. That's, that's Ka There was multiple things. That was just the number's on the list. That was just the number one thing. The number one thing. Is it a secret gaming room? No, the number one thing cash wants in his future house. And he and ironically put this like, he was not trying to be funny. I just caught him looked through his nose. Did she catch you lacking? It was a Wait, wait, who got you smiling like that? Like yeah. What you smiling? Like I taste because It's crazy. Like Yeah, I got her smiling like that. You know what I'm saying? The fuck hitting baby. That's got nobody smiling. Actually. No. That's what everybody's laughing.


So anyways, cash. Wait, I want everyone to guess what my number one thing is. Yeah, Maybe you think it's a secret gaming room. It's a secret something I think. I think it's a secret. No, it doesn't. It doesn't have be secret. No, I think it's just when me and Kate built a house one day. What do you think? My number one A jacuzzi. You know what that was on the list. That Wasn't number one. What you think I I was also gonna guess that, but let me guess something else. I would, it's not something you already have. No, I would, no, I would bet it's something to do with me. No. I's something To do with I know. I I know what it's, I would actually Go so far to tell you. I would genuinely give you guys a million dollars if you could guess it. Wait, no one shake On it.


Shake on it. I mean, no one's guessing this cash A hundred dollars. Fuck no. You don't have to owe him anything. He said he'd just give it to you. I know, but he is not gonna give you a million dollars. I don wanna shake my hand for something. So. Oh, What smart $100 Did you tell her? And he is Gloves on? Did you read my notes? No. How would I get in your Phone? I don know. I'm just making, I don lose hundred bucks. Okay, we What kind of I was ask. Okay. Like on my fingers. Alright, guess that was so weird. What do you think it was? Is it like a little builtin thing for your snacks by your bedside table? Wrong? But that was a great answer. Well, that was good. Okay. Wait, add that to my list. Let's at this a boxing ring? No, no. That's on the list.


No. Do you Wanna know Cass's number one request for his future house? Wait, I wanna guess, let me think for a second. A big, I'll even give you a hint. It involves the bathroom. A big toilet. Oh, separate. Separate toilets? No, and a locked door. So, okay. He can't watch you. I mean, no, but that's good. Okay. Just tell. Is it, wait, is it like a TV in the bathroom? Up a day? That's good, man. We gotta have more of these conversations before I build Up a day. Oh heck no. Heck, heck no. No cash is, I'll not use that. His number one request for our future house is that the toilets have to have extremely deep bowls. That is The number one thing he wants. Oh, so does it splash On you?


Yeah. When, when you pin No, no, no. Specifically, it just flashbacks just hits you up. Or splashback, I mean, splashback or the splash Back when you're peeing splash back when you're pee in a shallow toilet bowl. Ma'am, it splashed back. When you're peeing in a deep toilet bowl, you're so stupid, you don't splash back. Why wouldn't you just add in a ural? Oh yeah. That is a great idea. That's what I was saying. A ural. Yeah. Then you just pee on the floor half the time. What? No. Wait, you don't do that? No. What? You pee on the floor in a Urinals? No, no. And a urinal. Well, some urinals go in Urals. Did you guys know that? What? That some urinals go all the way to the floor. I bet you guys didn't know that.


I've seen that. Yeah. You can like step some urinals. They start up here and they're like four or five feet long and you pee on the floor. Are Those like considered nice urinals? I mean, they're at like Brahms. Brahms does have them sometimes. What? Yeah. And they, they go all the way to the floor. Oh, That's, That's the gross. And you pee pretty much in the floor. I think it has something to do with gravity and, and the physics of like, the arc of the stream. You're basically just peeing on the wall and It trickles down. There's like no splash. If you literal, you're just peeing on the wall. Impact on the wall. If you go straight at the wall, it would be bad. Oh my God. You can tell a man's intelligence just by walking in the bathroom, apparently. 'cause Oh, we can't pee in circle. They have to pee on men's horrible, honestly.


Oh, oh. When we were in Vegas, oh me. You looked like a gorilla bell. Like you really did. When me and when me and Mav went to Vegas last month, I accidentally, I was on my phone trying to get my bank to send me more money when I'm in the casino. Did You just hear Mavericks laugh? And I was so distracted. I was so distracted on my phone. I was trying to cash out more money to gamble. I was, I I was just walking and I had to go use the bathroom and I walk in the bathroom and I'm just texting. And then a female walked by me and I was like, ah. And then she was like, ha. And I was like, ah, we, we were like looking around and I was like, ah.


We both thought we were in the wrong restroom. Turns out I was in the wrong restroom. Is this a real story? I say that. Yes. What? I say that you've got a serious gambling problem. Why have you not said this already? I don't know. I I, I I blanked out probably. 'cause then after that I went to go gamble. But no, I say that because, man, that restroom was nice and smelled good. Very much nicer than men's restroom. Oh, the women. There's so many stalls you wouldn't believe. Just stall, stall, stall, stall, stall, stall, stall, stall. There's no urals. There was none. Wow. Not even one. How do you pee? Not even What the world may never know. How do you voice? Or, I mean, like, do you never sit down to pee? Well, this guy does. 'cause he's weird.


What? We've talked about this because I, We really wanna go over this again. To be fair, we don't have deep toilet bowls. So, I mean, kind of understandable. But if we had a deep toilet bowl, you could stand like a man. Oh, imagine a urinal. You could just, oh my gosh. Have you ever walked in on him sitting down while Peeing? You can. No. Huh? No. I asked if if she's ever walked in on you sitting down while you pee. Oh wow. I mean, you wouldn't really know if they're just like doing one or the other. And then she like, goes over there and like, looks in a bowl, which would be kind of weird. Oh, Can we move topics? This is Kenzie. You gotta get more comfortable with these conversations. No, no, no. Kate Open. We're very open. I'll just never walk into the room when he's peeing. Oh, not me.


Have you ever farted in front of him? No, not yet. Wait, have I What? Are you kidding me? Have I, oh, she Don't make stuff up. She Smelled so bad. I don. Okay. He's making stuff up. Kt. I don't care what you think when you're sleeping. Sometimes they slip and he's heard it. No, He's, That's bull.


Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
