So my sister works at, my sister works at a junior high school and she was telling me on the first Wait, a junior school or a high school? A high Junior high school. Middle School. What? The, a high school for juniors? Yeah. It's Called junior high. Freshman, Sophomore. It's not high. Freshman, sophomore, junior. What is that? You're high? No, it's sixth. It's like middle School, like sixth, seventh, eighth Grade. Hi, how are you? Hi Are sorry. Keep going because I wanted to know what you were about To say. Okay. So apparently all summer long there was this possum that somehow got on top of the junior high, the building. And it was just living up there all summer long. Okay. And the first day of school, it was like looking over the edge at the car rider line in the morning. It fell off.


And as it's falling off the roof, it's peeing. Okay. Oh, Oh no, it, It hits the ground. It's still alive, but it's doing its possum thing and like pretending it's dead. And all these like, like sixth graders and seventh graders are just like, oh. So the principal walks up and he just picks it up by its tail and he just puts it in the trash can. What? Hey, That's it. He didn't even like dispose of it because it was still alive. He just put it in the trash can. He disposed of. It's crazy. That's East Texas. Trash. Trash. I'm not gonna lie. Well, it's possibly committed suicide. I you just put it in the trash can. Right? But Could you Move along now? Junior kids, That thing was just living its life all summer and all of a sudden it's like, oh my gosh, what are all these, these people doing? And then it just throws itself off.


His, His it had social anxiety. Okay. He couldn't take the first day of school. It was too much. He was just caught off guard. Expect he didn. Did he not wanna go back to school? Guys? This is a heavy helmet. Yeah. I feel like, I feel like carefully I hurt her neck. You feel what? Ew. Oh, you feel what? Stop. Okay. I don dunno what she feels. But guys, I had a great idea for a podcast. Do you guys wanna hear The mic Again? Okay. Does anybody wanna hear mic? Yes, I do. I do wanna hear. I really wanna hear, Want anything? I want everybody to want hear. Isn't that funny? You kind of looked like the person on your shirt. Watch it. I Can shirt. It's the Alfred and e watch Eddie. Like, because it's heavy Wall.


What are we watching? Whoa. Whoa. Harper, you might be the funniest person. I know. That was impressive. That's so funny. Okay. I have a great idea for a podcast. Yeah. Here, let's Hear it. We're gonna bring one of those ginormous sumo wrestlers on and I'm going to wrestle him. You're gonna, that's a great idea. Do you should do that? You're not gonna beat him. Yeah, I will. I have a strategy. What's your Strategy's Called? Do and weep. Yeah. Dodge. You know how sumo wrestling works? Kate? I know how to get a guy on the ground in about 0.2 seconds. Really? Let's see That. I did it Before. Let's see it. How do you cash and Kate, right now? She says she's gonna get you on the ground in 0.2 seconds. There's no way you can get me on the ground in 0.2 seconds. I'm starting a timer. Yes, You can gimme, gimme, gimme one.


Do I Can do I wanna fight back? No. Why would you Fight back? What? Why would you fight back? I didn't say I could fight. I just said I could get you on the ground in like two seconds. How does that even work? I don't even think that's true. I think I Can just stand there and she's not going to. Okay, Here we go. Do it. Go for it, Kate. He's ready. Let's go. We already know what he's gonna do. All right, I'm about to start your time. You have 0.2 seconds, which is not very long. Three. Come on, Kate. Just do it. You don't want me to, I'm gonna point Kate, What are you doing? Just stand up and do this. Ready? He, he knows what's going on. And Here we go. Ready? Three and five. Four. Wait, I didn't start yet.


What the frick was that? Okay. Okay, we're starting. I start again. We're gonna start in 3, 2, 1. And your time's up. Oh, I didn't know we started. How did you Say? Okay, go. Oh, okay. I'm not on the ground. I win. No, but it, I did, it did work one time because I actually did hit him hard. Why would do that? He just, he just doesn't want me to hit him hard again. Yeah. But like, Why did I Do that? Because that's not impressive, Kate. No, That is because the other day, me, Cassius sister and his mom we're all talking about how if we were ever to be attacked, the first thing we're gonna do is kick a guy where it hurts.


Okay. Where? When all the guys in the room we're all like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why would you do that? Listen, that's just off limits. If you're ever in a street fight, you can't do that. Like why I'm talking, I don't even think it would work. But you could try. There Are no limits in street fights. No, There is. If you're, if no Rules or regulations, If me and a guy are in a street, okay. If literally there was five of them, I still wouldn't kick them there. Why? Because this is an unspoken rule. That's Not an unspoken rule. When you are being attacked, Where are we talking about? Don't Attack people if you Don't wanna kicked. I dunno what we're talking about Either. Yeah. Where are we talking about kicking? I'm so confused in the heart. Really. Really? That's where our hearts the most. Does it Like an open heart or like a bone? What Open car are you talking about?

If the sumo wrestl is the equivalent to three of one of them, I don't think it the, I don't think it is. Oh my gosh. How many of do you think all five of us could take down a sumo wrestler? I, I don't think I would touch a sumo wrestler. Yeah, they're gonna be sweaty worlds sweat. Yeah. He's probably like sweaty. I think that's like, yeah, they have to be sweaty. That's just like comes Well, that's Part of the sumo wrestler.


Yeah. It just comes with the package. Maybe When you take the costume off, you're not sweaty no more. But like I Can, the Costume. Do Sumo wrestlers have diabetes or something? Like, I don't know. Like I'm Not who probably Not in a rude way could for them to like, You know, you know Paul Blart, the Malco? Yeah. Inspirational man. I will say, Yeah. As a kid for some reason I was always like, that's a cool superpower. He's got Diabetes. Diabetes. He man runs off sugar. I was like, imagine I wish I, I've always had an excuse to eat sugar. I thought he just always had a great excuse to eat sugar. Yeah. Yeah. Does That's if you, that's if you have low sugar as a diabetic, you can have high sugar as a diabetic, which means you don't get sugar and you just take insulin.

Not attractive at all. Wow. That's unfortunate. He is a 10 and he punched a hole in the wall and then said, don't worry, a drywall guy is gonna come fix it the next day. And he didn't get a drywall guy to fix it the next day. What is he then? Wait. POV. He asked, had a drywall guy come and fix a different hole, but left that one. I did have a drywall guy come to the house and fix something else and he is like, you want me to fix that one? And I was like, nah. Just like, alright, because that makes sense Harper. Harper, you go, oh, He's the 10. But he wears skinny jeans.


These jeans aren't that skinny. I mean, come on my right. I mean, come. I would say a 10. Okay. No, no. We're gonna move on now That I just don't like anything about that. So. Oh my God. Yeah. We gotta you wanna hear the one I was gonna say earlier? I can't say in the pocket. It was so funny. But I'll whisper it to you. No, don't say it. I can't whisper it to her.

Because he doesn't have one. Okay. You can he literally, Why Don used one before this. I wrote some down. Okay, Fine. Oh, she's a 10. But only because of inflation. What? I wrote that one down. What I, well, okay. Well I also wrote it down.


She's a 10, but only because of She of inflation. What does that mean? Like, you don't know what inflation is. I know what inflation is, but I don't get how that Resonates. She's a 10, but only because there's not a lot of other tens around. So that means she kind of goes up in the numbers because everybody else around's ugly. Woo. I don't even know that's what it meant. But good interpretation like that her value went up because the demand is high supply. And the quality demand is what he's trying to say. The supply is low.
