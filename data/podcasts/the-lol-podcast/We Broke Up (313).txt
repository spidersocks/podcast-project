You, you keep saying, oh well we're kind of on a break. Oh, well we're On a, lemme tell you. We're kind of just, we're On. Are you together? No. Are you broke up? Listen, Harper, lemme tell you something. There's no such thing as a break. You're either together or you're not. Be you. I've been on a break and he went on dates with my friends. So, Are You kidding me? No, that's not real friends. Sorry. I Yeah, that's what my friends some might say. Yeah. So you're not on a break either. Once Yuri doesn't, and if he wanted to, he would.


So, well hold on, let me say something about that. Preach. He's done. No, don't preach. Don't don't Snap at me. 'cause listen, that's a good snap if you're on a break. Therefore you are free to go talk to other people. No, I Mean, Yeah. Lemme ask you if you're at work and you're on a break, that means you're free to go do whatever you want on your break. Yeah, but wait, you think if you're on a break You can't talk to other people? No. But being humble Has nothing to do with this. No, no, no, no, no. If you're on a break, This feels so Ross and Rachel for friends, you Cheated on me. We were on a break. We're on a break. No. If you're on a break, then that means you're taking time apart to think about things.


Yeah. Then come back together and make a final decision. Or to Potentially talk to other people to decide if you want to continue the break. No Long term. But in today's world, people cannot stand true to a break. So you're either committed to each other or you're not committed to each other. There is no such thing as a break, unfortunately, because men cannot stay true to the word break. Whoa. So whoa. Yeah. You ever seen men are the problem? What? You ever seen it? Okay, well, okay. No, no TV show. Lemme give you a new thing. Okay? If you are on a break, I just, all I hear is Ross. Ugh. No, listen. Yeah, you just, I just said men are the problem. And you said, have you ever seen friends?


I have. And that's what proves that men are problem Is that? Yeah, Rachel was being an H Oe because listen to me, she that she was hanging out with some other guy and Ross got mad and then, you know what happened? Rachel was like, Hey, did you get mad for me hanging out with another guy? And then guess what? She got mad at him and out she dated that guy. Okay, So, and Cobra, Kai, bottom line. It's always just a friend. Yes. Kate, take his bow off. I'm Sick. This, I'm watching Cobra Kai. And guess what happens? These couple starts dating Sam and what's his name? Colby. Miguel. Miguel. Sam. Miguel start dating and then Sam starts hanging out with Johnny. No way. No wait, what's his name? Robbie. Robbie. Oh, and Sam and Robbie are hanging out. Yeah. And then Miguel sees Sam hanging out with Robbie and he's like, why the heck are you hanging out with Robbie?


And she's like, we're just friends. And then like two episodes later, she's dating Robbie. Here's the thing, men are never friends with women just to be friends. Okay. Never friends for two reasons. One, they like you. Second reason they like your friend. Okay. That's the only two. That's the only two reasons. That's pretty accurate. Yeah. They're using you to get to another girl or they like you. That's the only, only two things. Is that true? So now that we've kind of clarified more dates, is that Alex? Alex shook his head. No. Do you think Dudes, oh, Alex doesn't agree, Disagree. You can dudes are friends with girls outside of that. I think they can be no, they can be like friends, like acquaintances, like, oh yeah.


Like, but they're not like go Out their way to hang out one OnOne like Super close. I like, I was friends, I was friends with girls that I danced with, but I wasn't like friends. It was a little weird. I wasn't like friends like, like, Hey, you wanna go get ice cream together just as friends? No. Yeah, that's a lot. Yeah, I didn't do that. That'd be weird. Long story short, I guess with Harper's situation we have going on here, are you or are you not talking to other people? Yes. Are you or are you not? That yes does not answer that. I, I said like, I like if you're saying that cheating or if you're saying on a break, if you're saying like if you're on a break with somebody and you're talking to other guys or like just snapping them, then yes I am. Oh, okay.


See, that's what a break is. So we're on a break right now, but we're kind of basically broken up. So we kind Of, are you together? No. Now You're, so are you broken up? Okay. Answer me this one question. Are you single? Yes. There you go. If you were gonna date another guy, would you have to talk to Jason first? No. Wow. That's it. Then That's kind of like single as a Pringle type beat. You guys kind of Forget, she's only 15. She's still figuring stuff out. Oh no. I don't really care what she does.
