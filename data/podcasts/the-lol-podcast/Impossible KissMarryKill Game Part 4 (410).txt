Yeah. And Harper grabbed the girl's face and smashed her into the counter twice.


She was like boom, boom. And not Actually, And then she took a bottle and smacked it on her head. No, actually the girl was unwell. Yeah. And then, and then, or part of the video, Harper was supposed to slap the girl fake slapped the girl and Harper actually slapped the girl.

I'm so, I'm so sad because when he rolled up I was like, oh, he's coming on. I mean he was dripped out. Honestly, if it wasn't six o'clock and probably not a dinner rush. That's True. Probably he would've missed out on so much money if he came up. Here's pod, we're ordering food again. We'll get one one day. Imagine Juan. Pull up. I say every podcast for now on. We order Postmates and Please. Yeah. Next we're shooting another episode after this. I say we order Postmates and see if that Uber driver will come up that we have to honestly.

I have a seven mil party with just my friends. A Seven mil. Y'all Here on the pod. Oh, yay. Wait, what do you mean 7 million? Oh, on TikTok? Yeah. Oh, okay. I see. Wait, no 7 million is like rounding up to 10 mil. Right. So it's like the wind up process. And So like two years ago I had zero. Now I'm at seven mil. Yeah, it makes Sense. That's why you throw a party rounding up from what, What seven? Like rounds to 10, But it doesn't Yeah, it does.


Hold On. Yeah. Yeah it does. From zero, no, seven and and a half. Five, seven and 7 million. 501,000 would round to 10. No. Yeah. Imagine I hit eight years. See I have 3.5 and that rounds to zero. What? Okay. Okay. Well anyways guys, comment down below what we should do for our 200th episode. I'm actually very interested. We can do anything. Probably not probably having a budget, but you know, comment down below. I'm kidding. We got a pretty good budget. That Cash Shot a cake. He sat in a cake and caught his hair on fire. But we have to be careful about what we do. Like. Yeah, so I, I would request that your request does not involve me getting lit, lit on fire again.


If it does, that's okay. We have insurance now, so, so we'll be fine. We don't, I remember after the 100th episode, I went and took a shower and just all my hair was just falling out. Are you kidding? Yeah. I mean, chunks of hair just, I literally started screaming from the shower. I was like, Hey, I'm voting. He was like, no, no. And then like two weeks later, Our hairs stylist Asked him. Yeah, alright. Like two weeks later our hairstylist looks at his hair and she's like, did you have to give a hair sample? Yeah, a hair sample was like, no, she thought just On drugs and had to give a hair sample. She thought he needed to give a hair sample for something. 'cause there was a chunk of hair missing. You do that for drugs and drugs only. What? Yeah. I was like, no, I just have a podcast.
