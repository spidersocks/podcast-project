How's cheating? What the what the what? I don No, I wouldn't know. So Wait, what happened with that? Because I, I thought your car got like broken. I did. Yeah. So what happened was, I was actually like Pranking Piper, like, I guess I was just testing her loyalty, I guess. But it got too far when she broke my car.


So You wait, you tested her loyalty. Wait, hold. I don't know any clue about this situation really. So can you just Explain? Yeah, elaborate. I wanted to like spice things up a little, so Right. As one does. Yeah. So I guess I kind of pranked the internet and Piper and I was like just saying I like cheated on her and stuff. Oh yeah. And I got, that's normal. I live with her right now. So I just got an Airbnb and like, so I could like not be next to her. And then I just like started acting like a total jerk. And then Did she Know? No, she didn't know until, no, until like my car got smashed at, This is what you get for cheating on me with her. And she kissed you today. That's disgusting.


And then we had like a whole talk about it and stuff. Wait, Smashed my windshield. Yeah. That's So valid. Respectfully. Honestly. That's so valid. You're telling me that didn't go well. Yeah, no, it didn't go well. Huh. That's interesting. Yeah. You lost like 300,000 followers Too. I did, but I gained them all back. And actually the crazy thing is I gained like all my followers on Twitch. Like I would rather be famous on Twitch and TikTok in my opinion. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. Worth it. Hashtag worth it. Yeah. Well that's valid. That's just, Maybe I Should try that. The windshield. I get an Airbnb. Yeah. I mean, If not ever thought, even just the thought of cheating on me, I would do a lot more than smashing car Windows.


So Yeah. What would you do? Kenzie? I, I cannot say it on the internet. First degree murder. I Would do something. First degree murder is always the answer. Can you just get a notification map booked in Airbnb? She's like, oh no. Whatcha doing? I'm so bad. Wait, what made you wanna do that? Like I said, I just wanted to spice things up a little and I just wanted to have some fun, I guess. Yeah. Oh, just mix it up. So when you're bored, you're just like, yeah, I guess like a fake cheat. Yeah. I, I actually, what do you guys wanna do today? I was, I was like confused on what was happening, but I kept seeing stuff and people were being pretty rude to you? No people. I mean, I mean like, As they should be. I mean, yeah, but really get to the point like, there's things you should say and things you shouldn't say.


Like Yeah. But I understand why I, I already knew they were gonna be mean to me. I already knew they were gonna switch up like that. So I was like, I just wanted to Testa. Wait, So how'd your car get smashed? I was just chilling. And then Piper and Lil Tay and Lil Tay grabbed the baseball bat. Not Little Tay not, yeah, not Little Tay, little T. And they said I love her. Started smashing my windshield. That's so valid. Wow. Dang. Good For that. Who actually smashed it? Was it Little Tay? It was both of them. Wow. At the same time With the same bat. Different bats. Two bats. Wow. So is your car windshield fixed now or? Well, yeah. It's been, yeah, my car's in the shop. I'm getting like stuffed onto it and stuff. Oh, okay. Yeah. Can we smash it after this? I don't think that's necessary. Really, Because I think, I think we're all getting kind of, you know, bored.


We wanna spice things up. We Should spice up this podcast right now. Yeah. Let's just go do it. Yeah. No. So how do you feel that people call you Chari? I mean, I don't, I don't really care.

I Don know why I saw it too. I was wearing, Because it was on Cash's nightstand. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know who put it where, but somehow it ended up just on my nightstand. That makes sense. Yeah. So then when we played three things you can't live without, I took the picture and I put it in Harper's bag. Oh, thank You for telling the truth. You Thought it was your bag? I thought it was my bag. But then the bags got switched. Yeah. And yeah, then I didn't have it in my bag, which I was sad about. Okay. Yeah. But now you're with him So you can look at Yeah.

I mean, like, I I didn't mean any harm by it or anything. Cash wrote it. Piper wrote more like what The No. Yeah. Myrick actually wrote it. My African cash wrote it. I don't think so. No, no, no. Y'all Did. Ah, well Maybe Yes. I have bad memory. Could have been Heavily influenced. Yeah. And then Maverick was like in the, in the studio. He was like, pipe more.


He was like feeling It. I was like, Moving on. I took the Video too. I need to find, see an in video. Yes. No way. No matter When we were in the studio and Maverick was like singing, Hey, pull It up, up. Pull it up, pull it up. I need to find it. It's so bad. No way. Y'all don't understand when I sing on the microphone, I have to like imagine like I'm in front of a, a crowd and like actually singing it So cinematic or it sounds like B's. So cinematic. Have you ever made a song before? Yeah, I have. With Piper. Yeah. But give me a, we my, my Twitch chat is the one who wrote the lyrics so that to do something like that. Oh. Shot. It was pretty bad. Dang. But if I, wow. I think if I really tried to make a song, it wouldn't be that bad. Yeah. Well can you actually like sing? No. Oh, well we'll get you in our studio. 'cause you don't have to, you don't have to be a good singer.


'cause just Autotune will get married. What did you look at me when you said that? Oh, what? Yeah, what anyone Is welcome is messing up. Anyone is welcome. Hey, I don't know if she's gonna find this video. Yeah, probably not. I'm not sure it exists. But, but It it, it does exist. I think it does because I think she sent, Wait, we reported it in December of 2023. Oh no, no. Cash sent it to me. Cash sent it to me. Oh. Cash. It Cash leaked. Okay. Well I didn't realize I I leaked your footage, man. That's here. It's, Hey, there was, you found it that quick. Ready? Oh no, that was fired. That was fired. Jeez. Help me. Oh, that's the help me one that. Yeah. Well it still was really embarrassing. Yeah. That Wasn't even the right song.


It's Like somebody help. That was fired. Dude. That was fired. Like what, what It, it was okay and then No. Okay. Yeah. And was, That's better than getting what we got because we made a song a couple months ago. The whole podcast. Podcast to rock from podcast. Have you heard from Podcast to Rock? Yeah. No. Really? It's good. Yeah. It's probably better that you don't, he was like, let me Just melt this quick, quick. No, That's how the song goes. But when we were, when we were recording it, Kenzie and I like, aren't singers and everyone in the, you know, everyone in the studio. They kept being like, it's just not gonna get better than that. Every time me And Kenzie Had to hit our line and like they were, tape and chase were both like, it's not happening.


That's the worst line to hear when you're recording a song is just, it's not, I think that's the best you're gonna get. Oh, thank you. That Happened multiple times to me. I literally couldn't hit the note and I was just like, they're like, that's the best it's gonna get. Oh wait, yeah. When's your song dropping? I don't know. Oh, okay. Okay. Have you announced it? No. Oh, cash just did. Yeah, we've talked about it in the pod. Remember we said she was like talked about. We haven't said the name or anything. Yeah, yeah. But you don't know when you're driving it? No. Oh, you just holding onto it? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I don, when we were at the Nickelodeon awards yesterday or cash, you, you ran into somebody and I did. We can't talk about that though.


We can talk about it vaguely. No, no, we really can't. What can we, we said last night we talk about it. Okay. Can we talk about it? No. Okay. We can't talk about it. No. Wait, I don't even know what we're talking about. No. We'll tell you guys later 'cause we can't really talk about it. Matt loves to do this thing where he likes to like out people on the internet and we really like can't do that. So we're gonna move, move. Last night Tax said he was gonna talk about it. No, I didn't. Like was it like a bad No, I didn't. Alex's voucher. No, I didn't. Mav said you should talk about that. I said we can't talk about that. We had had a slightly weird experience, but we're moving on from it. Did you tell me? We'll tell you later. I easily get in fights with people. That's all you need to know. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Just That's it. But yeah. No. Who's like you? Can we talk about The security guard that wouldn't let us on the Dadgum Ferris wheel ride?


Can we talk about that? Kenzie still mad. There was one ride she wanted to ride one and we kept hanging out the Dadgum And then we're finally like, dadgum. Okay, we'll go, we'll go ride. We're on like the Santa Monica Pier and there's like rollercoasters there. Yeah, there's like only four rides. So we finally get to Kinzie's ride that she really wants to ride. We go over to it and Cash and Kate walk up and then me And Kenzie go to walk on and security guard just goes, no, no. We're like, what do you, what what, what you do. And keep in mind, no one's in line for this ride. Zero people. The ride is completely empty. There's like one or two people in front of us and the ride holds like 30 people. Nobody else in life. She just puts the rope in front of us just literally as they walk.


She's like, it's already done. And Matt was like, what? They're like, well, they're about to go on the ride. She's like, Nope, this is the last time they're running it. And I was like, yeah, so can can we just pop on? Could go. You know why they run it? It's like 20 Extra seats empty. No Way. The whole thing was empty. I was so angry. And the security guard was like, no, no. Yeah, no. Wasn't letting it happen. I started to bark at her. Yeah. No. Yeah. So then the entire ride, we sat there, I was watching Mav as we're riding the ride. Mavs standing two feet away from the security guard just staring at her like this With a chicken hat on him. He thought he was scary. I was like, Mav, you're not scary. You have a chicken on me. No. If anything you looked like when I was watching you, I was like, if I were the security guard, I'd probably be fearing for my life.


Because you know those serial killers that like, just get a look in their eye or those like, people that like, you know, are gonna hurt other people. They're just like, I'm pretty sure it That is that type of serial killer. They're like, why'd you kill him? He's like, they didn't let me on the ride. I was like's Like, what do you mean they what? No, I was, I was so irritated. I was like, there's absolutely no reason we care. Even the guy running the ride was like, dude, that's crazy. He's like, I'd let you on the ride. Yeah. You ever been to Santa Monica? I have, yeah. You ever been in on the rides? Yeah, I have. Dude, there's just one ride. It's so funny. You got a video of it. Which one? Oh, I Have a video. It Literally just goes up and down. Oh, I do. He thought it was The pirate one. The the Dragon thing? No, it's like the drop one. It's like, it just goes like this. Oh, that one? Yeah. Oh, that's like the Superman version.


They wouldn't let anybody on My, it's like the Superman version of it. It's called the Superman. It's six. It's Literally just this Wait That It looked that crazy And then you just like drop it. But But it was so fun. We were, it looks like a little kid ride, but I was like, guys, guys, let's get on. Let's get on, let's get on. And everybody's like, no, we're not riding that. And I was like, no, it, it could be fun. We don't know. And I get on it and I'm by myself just completely on the ride by myself and it's just going up and down. Is that me? Yes. Kicking his feet. What was like your weirdest fan experience? 'cause I feel like they're just talking about themselves. Oh. Oh, here's a, come On. I'm, I'm joking. I'm joking. I just promise. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Nobody. Yeah. All Right. I was at the prom, the streamer prom thing, and we were leaving, So like two Days ago.


Yeah. And this, like, a bunch of people were academy me and stuff taking picture with me. This one girl, because like Popular And This one girl, she was like, oh my gosh. It was bad. Like, she kept touching me. She was like, if Piper does you wrong, I'm gonna give it to you. Oh, What? Oh my God. Trying to kiss me. Let me get a kiss poppy. It was what? It was bad Poppy. What? It was so bad. I'm not gonna lie about crazy. And I was streaming it too. So it's, it, it's there. I Can show you a video, bro. It no, no streaming While she did It, I was streaming. Yeah. Oh my gosh. It was so bad. That's crazy. Yeah, it Made me very Uncomfortable. Wait, was it like another creator or was it a like a fan? It was a fan, yeah. Oh, it Made you uncomfortable.


So uncomfortable. That is bad. No. Yeah. I feel like, I feel like people need to know their boundaries. Like when it comes to people, like we're all like just people, you know? But, but like, when it comes to people just like touching up on you and stuff, it's just like kind of weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sorry, what? Oh, nothing. I, are you sure I wasn't cash dressed in a girl's? What? What? You never did answer my question. I asked you if you've ever prank cheated on Kate. Yes, he did. Well that, that's a literally like, is like you're tossing him that question, knowing the answer to the question. Yeah. Yeah. Are you trying to set me up? Well, I, I want you to Say, I know you've seen the video.


Yeah, no, I want you to say it out loud so then I Can tell you how it wasn't a prank and that I was actually cheating. Wait, what? Okay. Yes, I did do If I ever get a boyfriend. What? Explain it. No, you the why is she just, you explain it. Wait, no, I'm, I'm not talking about a recent one. I'm talking about a long time ago. Yeah, I know which one you're talking about. Well, I've never seen the video And I'm very confused how you think this was cheating. I'll just summarize it. Apparently for Kenzie, me and Maverick were playing a video game and we set up cameras and I had the headset on and I'm acting like I'm talking to a girl on like, online on the Xbox.


And Maverick was the girl on the other end talking in a girl voice. This what you're talking about, I guess. So She doesn't even know what she Saw. I, I've seen, I've seen some, What the heck are you talking about? Where Kate has bleach blonde hair super long. Yes, very young. Yes. Nothing, not young anymore. And you walk in and you're like screaming at cash in, in his bedroom or something. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So what about that? Did you finish explaining it? Yeah. So then Kate thinks I'm like cheating on her or whatever. And then Mad walks in the room and he has like a wig on and Yeah. Yeah. I think that's real cheating. I mean that if that's, if that's the case that is messed up. I cheated on you with my brother Kate.


Well, that's even crazier. That's what you're saying. You're, you Well He caused you to have mental distress and like, made you really think you were cheated on. I Mean, yes. Isn't that a Prank though? Isn't that the point of the what I'm Saying? Yeah. So prank, If it was an actual girl, I mean, maybe, but it Was, yeah, it's like a, it's, it's my brother man. You actually cheated on or like prank cheated on Piper with like Maddie or what's her name? What's her name? What's her name? Dang. The one A Such an A, such an a Do you not remember Alice? I Forgot What, how do you feel It's like that? Because y'all were like, Ty yet, what's going on? I swear y'all were like, really like Ty.


We like Ty. Did you just forget after this? Somebody's gonna be like, yo, what podcast you just got? And he is like, I forgot. I don't know their names. So we're not, wait, Do you know our names? I, Yeah. Really? All of 'em. What's Our names? Start, start right there? Yeah, he lying. Rick. Okay. Okay. Oh, cash Harper. Okay. Kate. Ooh, not, That's okay. I'm new here. My name is Casey Lock. And Kenzie. Yeah. Kenzie, what'd you tell? I got like, he wasn't gonna get it eight 75%. Right? So actually no, you 85. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. I'm actually doing good. He's like, that's a passing grade. No, I don't, I don Dunno if I should bring this up, but actually no, I don't think I should.


Well, we'll just cut it if No, I, I Don. Oh, okay then don't I just, I just think it's like, it's a, yeah, no. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. All right. So it's not cheating. Wait, wait. What? No. So you think It Cheating if it's a prank? I mean it depends on the extent of the prank. And Kate was very distressed and she truly thought she was cheated On. I would not say that. I consider that cheating. Yeah. Okay. So say, would it, were you not like mentally dis disturbed would've been cheating if I I think that he upset me, yes. But I would not say that because I was upset. I was cheated on. Like, if cash did something to upset me right now, I wouldn't be like, you cheated on me.


He is like, no, I didn't, I just didn't take the trash out. That's not like, that's true. Being upset doesn't equate to being cheated. Do Y'all think it it, Is It Cheating If, like, would y'all say it's cheating if the guy you're dating like goes to Hooters? Yes. That's like an actual good one. Oh, that's a, that's a good one. I'm Gonna say yes. Why I We going Hooters. Why can't they just go to Buffalo Wilds? Twin pea guys probably do. Twin pea is also Hooters cake. What? She said, why can't they just go to Twin Peas? That's, I I would say it's probably not wise. Probably not a good idea. Yeah. I mean I feel like if anyone is like intentionally going to Hooters, like who is really going to Hooters for the food?


My uncle says he swear he just goes for the wings. He says they just have the best wings. I'm like, are you sure Uncle, uncle? He did, he took his, he went to, okay, this is that. Actually I, We have a funny story. Oh, he took you too? Yeah, he takes all of us to Hooters. When we were younger, We went, we went. So it's, it's my best friend and her dad. So Cass's uncle, we went with our dads one time when we were like 11 or 12 and we're sitting in Hooters and my best friend is like freaking out. She's like, dad, dad, I don't think I'm supposed to be here right now. And she's like panicked in the middle of a Hooters. And he was like, why?


Why? It's fine. It's fine. It's a family restaurant. It's a family restaurant. And she was like, but Tad, look at how they're dressed. And he was like, it's a family restaurant. We're gonna have a family meal and enjoy it. And she was like, I don't think I'm supposed to be here. Yeah. And he was like, there's nothing wrong. Okay. Well that same uncle also used to take my sister when she was a baby to try to pick up girls there. So you know. Yeah, he did. Which I'm kind of confused how that works. Look, I have a baby, but it's not his. Yeah. Oh, oh yeah, you're right. Yeah. You're been to Hooters. He's just babysitting. He's a good guy. Yes. You have have been to Hooters. Yeah. Why you've been dating, why? No. Oh no. Because that would be cheating, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question, Harper.


Yeah. What do you think? Yeah, I think it's cheating if you go to who to call Your, Is It Cheating If they're like follow an Instagram model and like their pictures? Yeah. I wouldn't enjoy that. Do they know this person? Nah. If they, Well even if they know it. Like before Cash and I started dating, he followed a lot of like just friends in LA and stuff and they were like bikini Instagram models and stuff. And once we started dating he was like, I don't care. But like if I unfollowed him, that's like rude. 'cause like we were friends at one point. Yeah. So he just muted every single one of their profiles. Would it be like cheating if like, if you like caught your significant other, like looking at like my gym photos? You don't Got gym photos? Yes, I do.


Remember when you pooped yourself out the Yes I do. Yes I do. He he Pooped himself out the gym. That was one time. That's the only photo. And there's no photo of that. But would that be cheating y'all think or no? No. Oh no. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Appreciate that. Would it be cheating if like you're on a guy, another guy's gym story? Like you like add yourself to it? Like just like without thinking like, oh, like you're swiping through your stories. Yeah. Yeah. You see you got the good ones today. Wait, wait, what? I don't understand. Like if he's like, Hey swipe up. If you wanna be added to my gym story. I'm on One of my friends gym stories. Me Watching. I didn't know Jim's story were a thing. Is it A dude? Yeah. Yeah. Cheater. What the She's on one of you gonna let that slide?

No, I'm Kidding. No, they're like fully clothed. They're like, I'm gonna lift 500 pounds. Oh, there goes my back. Oh that friend. Oh, I know who she's talking about. Nevermind. It's fine. You know you're down bad when it's like a, oh, it's that guy. Nevermind. You can do, yeah. Yeah. Cashier that guy. Oh man. Is It Cheating If like you, like they tell another person about Or 2025. I've kept Pause it, pause it, pause it.

Oh, there we go. Now it's on and we're back. You said, I was saying is it considered cheating if you're significant other? Tell somebody else about you guys' relationship troubles. Oh. Oh. Like confides in another person of the opposite. Wouldn't it just be like the same person? Like No, it's like they're confiding in that person. But like, wait in a different, but how could it possibly be cheating if I told Maverick about our relationship? No. No, not me. No, no, No, no.


If you haven't told another girl, I went and told another girl. I was like, listen, my life's so hard because that's great. So you know me and you though. Yes, I don. Yes. That would be, That's cheating. But it would easily lead to it. I have seen this happen. If ma Was going, it's happened to me before, Girl, That like if Ma was going to some girl and was like, dude, like Kinzie's just so she's just been too much lately. Like I just Can't, That basically means like you want to cheat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'd be like, what's the, you're like waving a flag. You're like, you Know, You can like, it's like saying I might, I might, I might do it. Okay. But like would it be cheating? Like if like you kissed another person obviously. Right? Yeah, that's what I was thinking. What if it's, what if it's a grandma? No. Yeah.


You kissed kenzie's grandma. Yeah. That's why I, that's why I was asking. So I just didn't wanna bring that up. It got brought up. Was brought up. So I kiss, I kissed Kenzie's grandma at at at her wedding. At my wedding. Was It on the cheek? On the lip? No, on the lips in front of everybody Make make out or just kiss. Well with the grandma. Well I just, just to kiss. Oh My God. Do not do my grandma wrong. She kissed him on the Cheek. Yeah. After she, but I was trying to get her to kiss me on the lips after he was, After she felt his bicep. She kissed him on the cheek. Yeah, she, she wanted in my gym story after that she did. No, but like what? I was like you don't even have Snapchat it be this whole thing you No. 'cause I've seen people do that where it's like they're talking to their like guy best friend or something and they're like, I don't know how to feel about like me and blah blah blah.


And so like I need your opinion. That's Just when they hit you. I would never do that. Okay. Yeah, I know, I know that. But like I don't think that's cheating 'cause I've seen it happen. I think it can easily lead to it. Cheating though. To cheating. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, it Could. Is It Cheating If you make a private story to post on that your, so I guess person won't see It's not cheating. Just weird. It's Just weird. Okay. I mean I guess it depends what Delete that real quick. What the being Secretive? Yeah. I guess it depends what you're posting. Yeah. But like sounds pretty weird to me. Sounds cheating. Yeah. Yeah. Me. I thought that too. Yeah. Right. Is It Cheating If you haven't dating yet? Yes. Yeah.


Is It Cheating If you use the dating app? No one. No one clarified that. Yeah. No. I'm just looking Clarification. Is It Cheating If you have a guy or girl best? Is It Cheating If you have a guy or girl? Best friend. Oh, Best friend. Yeah. Like we're best friends. We're not anything else that's a But you never Know people have, I strongly agree that guys and girls cannot be best friends. There ain't no way. Yeah. They don't wanna be friends Unless, you know, They genuinely don't wanna be friends. What? Unless what? No dudes, they're interested in each other. I'm friends unless lot of dudes and not a single one of them is like, man I have free time. I think I wanna go hang out with this girl. And he doesn't have any feelings towards her or, or just wants to hang out there.


Or he is at least single. Yeah, I agree. Like what girls would be like, Hey let's hang out with some guys. Like what Actually no girl would do. That's So, yeah. No, I'm saying like strictly not liking him. No, that's, that's Like girls. Girls would do that. Girls would do that. Girls Do that. No, it's just different when you're single. 'cause then they're like, well maybe he'll bring a guy friend mom. Actually girls might do that. 'cause then they're like, well maybe he'll pay for me. Maybe like, but but no but, but both of them, the guy always likes the girl. At least I'll say Y's point of view is Y'all think that guys don't think that girls are funny at all and girls think that guys are funny. Yeah, I think girls are funny. Oh, thank you. Really? Yeah. Wow. Piper's funny. She's like my best friend. Yeah, but you're like dating her. Exactly. Yeah. So Y'all can be best friends and dating.


Yeah, But I don't, I think the only way a girl and boy can be best friends is if like the boy likes boys or the girl likes girls. Right. Oh, because like boys always just are That's fair. Fair boys always End up liking Them. Fair. I'm not gonna lie, girls. Girls, You can be friends with a boy and not like them boys is not, no. I feel like most, a lot of girls like if they're like best friends with the guy like there's a little something there. Like, even if they're like, oh my gosh, They like his friends, they like him something. There's something Something. There's always something. Yeah. Yeah. Is It Cheating If it they have like a a if they like ask somebody for their social Yeah. Security number. Yeah.


Like actually Security. Why would you ask that question or reason? Social. I mean, I would've Like Yeah, like their Instagram, their, their, yeah, that's true. Snapchat. I mean, it depends. The intent, I guess. Like, Piper walks up to a guy and you're out with her and she asks for his Snapchat. Oh, like Why? Like, what Is so, he's like, oh, I just wanted to get his Snapchat. No, the only, for What reason? The Only way I'd be like, No. Yeah. Like Snap is kind of weird. Yeah. But like, people, like, we like Instagram. Yeah. Like Instagram and stuff is really normal. Like just yesterday, like we were sitting down on a table and that guy handed his phone to us to put our Instagram in. Yeah. But that comes down to the thing. It's In like an influencer though. Like if it's Like, yeah, it's like, yeah, but that comes down to the thing again. It's like, it depends on the guy.


Like, I looked, I was like, that's fine. Yeah. Well, okay, first of all, I think he was like 15. That's what I'm saying. It's like, that's fine. It's like he's Like 15-year-old Also. But if it was like a threat, some guy that's like, I was like, okay, that guy's pretty attractive. No, I, I think that in our, like in social media specifically, there has been a lot of girls, like, I feel like that we've been like at events and stuff and it's the first time we are reading them and it's like, oh, let's get you on our podcast. Yeah. Can you get our Instagram? Exactly. Like, that's not weird. That's true. That's true. Yeah. Wait, hold on. But if we weren't in social media and you were just casually like, oh, lemme get your Instagram, I'd be like, what The heck? Yeah. That's weird. Yeah. No, I wanna clarify this post. Are you searching up my name?


Yeah. I'm searching up your name. Let me get it really fast. Just honestly While you're finding it, Is It Cheating If you have a snap treat? Snap, snap streak. Geez. Can I speak with the opposite gender, you think? Or No, I don't Have snap streaks. It Depends. The intent. I, again, I, I don't really have streaks me, but I will say when I was in high school and I did have streaks, if I had a streak with a guy, it was 'cause I liked him. Oh, really? Is It Cheating If you say you're on a break? Yes. Yes it Is. Is it though? Yes. Is it though? 'cause I watched this friend actually every friend episode. Yes. That's every friend's episode. We were on a, If you say you're on a break, but you're not actually on A break.


No, no, no. If you're like, Hey, we're gonna take a break for, for a while. Oh yeah. That means you wanna cheat. Okay. No, no, no. Not wanna. I'm saying if you're like, Hey, we're on a break, let's take a break for a while, and then like you, and then you go On a date with one of the girls' best friends in her hometown. Yes. That's cheating. Damn. Okay. Well, well what, what happened to you, Kenzie? No worries. We don't need to speak on it. Wait, so look. Now, who did you take on a date? No one. I take no one. I don know. 'cause if you say like you're on a break, it's kind of like, I mean, I would assume like if we're on a, if you're saying I wanna be on a break, I'll be like, You're not interested in me. Also, like guy that I dated for four years, three, four, we, yeah.


I just actually caught him in the car with my mom because she accused me. What the, wait, what'd you say? Of being on a break? Yeah. Yes. But he, he, he got, or he cheated on me with like 18 other girls while we're On. But if a guy, I feel like this is easy for me to say now 'cause I'm married and like I don't have to date and stuff. And I know my mindset would change if I had to date, but if a guy was like, oh, I just think we should take a break, I'd be like, okay, loser. Goodbye. Don't talk to me again. He You say that in it And then No, I know. Cash was like, let's take a break all the time before we started dating. And I was like, okay, I'll Do it. No, but it wasn't a break. It was, what's the point of a break? No, no, that's what I'm saying. It wasn't a break. Yeah, we k was like, can we date? I was like, no, no, no. I just wanna wait a while. It wasn't a break, it was just, I don't wanna date You. He was so mean to me. Really? I should have hit him. Hey guys, look this.
