And she said, it's a, it's a white bronco, but I wanna get it wrapped pink. And I was like, that's like really cute. You should And her, she was like, my parents are really nervous about it though because they think my car's gonna get keyed. And I was like, I mean a very real possibility. You know when you're the only person in town driving a big bright pink bronco like that.


And everyone knows Harper Zillmer drives a pink bronco. They're probably gonna key your car. And so Then the key is, because I'm gonna, oh, But then her dad's like, well her dad told her like, you realize when someone keys your car and you have a wrap on like that, you have to like it. It's way more expensive. 'cause you have to rewrap the whole car. And she's like, I don't care. It's my car. So she's getting a pink Car. Hey, you know how You can give $5,000? It's 3000. Oh, Okay. Well you know how You can give him 3000 by end his episode. He getting nothing. Okay. Okay, fine. His episode, he getting a gift card. That's what he kidding. In his episode, he owes her 3000. Fine, Fine. 500. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But no. Well, either way, if you do wanna give him money, I know how You can do it and commits your parents. If They Say no, you can be like, You can film a YouTube video out of it.


I don. And then that way the YouTube video will hopefully make $5,000. I know, but I don't. So then you break even and he gets 5,000. I don want people to be like, she's just using us for money.
