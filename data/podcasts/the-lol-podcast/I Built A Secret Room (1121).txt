I'm not stupid. But I do think that pooping arguably is worse because here's my statement. It Might, A Baby is meant to come out of your belly button.


Poop is not meant to. The ones I have are not meant to come out of that. Are you sure? Let me tell you man, that tiny Little Butt, that tiny little bubble is not meant you need to Chew your food better. Fuck It. Yeah. Well you this, your Lips look like a bubble.

Don't Do any of this. Let's have like 30 seconds of good influence. Okay. I think school is great. Don't do drugs except pharmaceutical and don't do drugs except pharmaceutical. What else? I would just, oh, if somebody, not everything is possible. Some things are impossible. Your dreams are not always achievable.

It just says type of guy. Type of guy Type of guy. No. You know what's funny? What if we like what, what if we like got all the memes from our podcast and like put 'em on shirts. Like, whoa Dude. You're just saying bro as heck Man. Like I'm not a baby, I'm a be. You're looking like a purple. That Would be a good One. And then you look like a cyber truck. What'd you say? Like what if we put all of our memes on shirts? Dude, ev, I just know the comic in is episode is gonna be so brutal. I Know what the stigma. I wanna make a shirt of you. Yeah.


Like mashed with the Wendy's girl. Oh you know that. I feel what? You know what? You know what? You know how sometimes you're like, oh, those two are the same thing. Like, there's like two completely different things, but they give the same vibe. Yeah. Yeah. So like how this episode is right now, this episode is the same as my greasy hair. 'cause like I didn't wash my hair yesterday, so my hair's really greasy right now. Like they give, I Washed my hair yesterday. No, but like it's the same, you know, I didn't understand The analogy. I don't understand. No, you, I think this episode's like really the same as like burnt toast. That's yeah. What It, my number six is the same as Taco Bell. No. And like math and four And four. Yes. The number four. Math. Math and blue. Math and blue. Yeah. Math and Blue.


Or like number seven and Sunday. What else? Yeah, my math journals were always Red. What's going on? Number or Thursday And I Don Dunno. Awesome. Sunday's always yellow. Monday's like, yes. Blueish. I don know Sundays. Yeah. Butterflies and water. No. What? Like what? I try again. I try again. Crabby and patties. No, I don't think you understand either. The letter E goes with the number three. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's just 'cause they look the same. What? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you can't tell if it's an E or three. It's like especially oppressive about shovel in a dove. Oh, I get it. 'cause dead people and dos. Oh and then they always really doves at the funeral.


Vanilla something. Yeah. Like the scent vanilla. What in the color beige? Yes. Same thing? Yes. Oh. Oh, like bodybuilder and cash? No, that was like complete opposite. Beginning Was like, oh, like Texas and rice? No. Oh. Like Texas and trail mix. That's a good one. That's a Good one. That makes sense. Like Texas makes and sweet tea. Yeah. That one's good. That one's good. Yeah. Okay. Let's see what's other like Analogies. Can we sing like Shakira? So can Shaquita Shaquita when you talk like that. Oh my God. Whoa guys, I just had a flashback to reality.


Oh my gosh. There goes gravity to reality. I just had snap. What are those things called when? Like deja vu? No, you see yourself outta your body. What? Outta body outof body experience. Oh, that's pretty self-explanatory. Yeah. Okay. I just had an outof body experience. What'd you see? I went through that camera lens and I saw all of us on TikTok and I was like brain rot. And now I'm here again. Brain. Yeah. I podcast brain rot. You all should share that. Can we all Sing like Shakira? I Can. I Can. Oh, I, We should.


We should talk about something serious. Y'all. We should talk about something serious. I We in the episode telling No something serious. No, no. Listen, I think we should Probably, the reason this episode is like this. No, no. Hold on. No math. Stop touching your mic. Math I, nobody likes boos. The the reason that episode, I'm going through the secret room. No, The reason this episode is like this right now is 'cause we all collectively are sharing like one brain cell. Ooh. So we're kind of like, I personally have to at least No, we're like, no. Like there's one split among five people. So 20% of a brain cell, 20% of our brain cell 20, 25. I'll say 25. 20% of our brain cell. 20% of our brain cell. 20% of a brain cell. Oh, it is a good question. I have a good question. Especially for this episode. Okay, You can go first. Okay.


What do you guys think is the most painful? Matt, stop touching way to die. Wait, wait. Restart, restart. What do y'all think is the most painful way to die? Killing Yourself. You're probably honestly getting thrown through a wall. That was pretty Painful. No, I mean you could kill yourself. Mul. Multiple ways. What's the most painful way? Let's not say that. Drowning. No. Let's To talk about anyways. But my question then That's, yeah. Next. What if there was an alien? That's a good question. If there was an alien that landed and somewhere and we are like the only people on earth, would he try to be friends with it? No. Who? Who is? Who do we nominate to talk to? The alien? Yeah. Who are we nominating to talk to? The alien. Easy three. Everybody get Wait everybody. Three. Wait. Everybody think of their answer.


Three. Two. Two. One. One. Myself. We each said cash. Yeah, you you did. Yeah. And then I said myself. That's three. We already win. What did y'all say? Wait, I said Mav. What'd you say? I said Kate, All my Kate. Wait, why did, should Oh never said Kate. Wait, why did you say me? I didn't feel, I thought you'd say yourself. Oh no, I was definitely gonna say you. Why? Just because like what I say what is appropriate To do that could fold the alien into thinking he's an alien. What The, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Matt, why did you say me? Okay, so personally, if we're gonna send someone, You can not gonna send, what are the women? Why not? Why? Just 'cause like, you know, y'all could easily Send me, I would make friends with the alien.


No, I, it'd have to be one of us. 'cause what if something happened to us? Harper would walk to the alien and us and be like, kill them. I'll terminate them. And if one of us is, you know, gonna go up to the alien and I've heard things about people abducted by aliens. Well, aliens aren't Real. What? I've heard things that aliens do to people. What? And I think you would handle that kind of thing. Do You think aliens are watching us right now? Let me tell you why you're all wrong. Wait, you want me to go? Because I have if you, in case I die. Well, no, not in case You die worse. I called it before this episode started. You were saying something absurd. Okay. Lemme tell you why you're wrong. Say, can't say it. Alright. Shut. Matt.


You already got the episode cut once. You're not asking anymore. My apparently we're back 'cause I got cut. Yeah. Said lemme crazy about aliens that I do not know. Okay, lemme tell You'all why Kate is the best option. Okay. To talk to the Aliens. Yes. Talk to the aliens. Talk to 'em. Because if the one of the two of you go, they're gonna immediately be like, oh, human life is not intelligent. Just destroy them all and we'll start over. What The, whoa. So mar cash for sure cannot talk to them. That was great. Okay. And Kate will walk up with empathy and intelligence and be able to get on their level and speak to them kindly and befriend them. Yeah. And therefore the human race will not be destroyed. Just every one or two or three or every other human that deserves to be destroyed by the alien.


Were you such as Cash Maverick? Were you gonna travel or try to be a lawyer? No. Oh. Actually been a good lawyer. Like, like El. Thank you. I Appreciate that. What did he say the other day In the hot tub? And we were like, wow. Oh, he's, oh, one of our friends was like, we were like, would we get in trouble for this or no? We were like, who's fault? Kenzie has a story that she won't tell and somebody, one of our friends is at fault And Kenzie won't say who it is. Okay. And that's fine. So we went around the hot tub and he was like, is the principal offender in this case cash? And that was it. No, you gotta explain the story. Well at all. That's it. That, well, there wasn't much of a story. They don't even know we had a lawyer friend in the hot tub that, well that was just pretty much it. But you just, horr explained that story. Said, well this wasn't really a funny story, but I had to touch on on, we had a lawyer friend in the hot tub and when he came for time for him to ask the question, he said, was the principal defender in your story that you claim in this hot tub?


And we were like, what the Yeah, You just like, I mean we shouldn't have told. I'm sorry. That was so much better. That was a lame story. I'm glad we just came. I didn't know why you said the story. Fricking dude. I'm sorry. Honestly guys, I Wait, what? What? Go Give him a hug right now. Trying to tell stories man. Here, I'll rub your feet. I dunno what to do. What happened? Oh yeah.
