Why'd you do that? He was like, because you were ignoring me. And I was like, Okay, cool dude. I guess not cold, dude. I guess don't, you didn't get like, you didn't get mad. You got very mad. No, because it was the weirdest thing ever. We're ignoring you on purpose, which is like a funny little prank. And you're like, it's funny for like five minutes after like 15 to a funny little prank. You're like, I threw your water bottle outside and you got, what's crazy is you got upset about it. No, I didn't. Yes, you. Okay, so you didn't get upset. So you're saying you didn't chase me around the whole street trying to grab the controllers and then get in the car and pretend like you forgot about it.


Oh, you left that part outta the story. No one told us that he, Then he tried to pretend like he forgot about the whole thing. Like, oh yeah, we're just best friends again. And right before we pulled in, he is like, well, yes, his hat off my head. You can throw it out the window. Listen, listen, you threw my water bottle so it looks like I didn't get to you. No, that's not what I'm saying. Listen, you threw my water bottle outside. I knew you right where it hurt, obviously. I'm gonna be like, why the freak did you throw my stuff? That's disrespectful. I mean, That's a, you are notorious for that, but Threw My stuff when you got Mad at that. No, when America is agitated at all. At all. So, sorry, somebody upsets Matt. It actually happened the other day. Cash. And I talked about it later. Maverick, I'm telling you, it happen the other day. Did It's a little special or something. Listen, when he gets mad, I think you're both special.


No, no. When he gets mad, he immediately goes to whoever he's mad at and he's like, is this yours? Because he's gonna break it. He has to break something. I'm gonna break it now. No, that's not true. The other day I broke your day. What do you mean thats not true? I Haven't seen that side of him. Yeah, and cash. You break my stuff and like you chased me around the whole lot. Harvard trying to smash my controller this week. You're the same person. This don't act like you're not because I'm breaking something. Because you were trying to break something to mine. What? This week I farted on him and in retaliation he was threatening to smash Kate's candle because I farted. I wasn't gonna smash her candle. No, you, I farted Picked it up and you were like, is this yours? Yeah, It's just yours. That I, no, that was, I went, I went and he goes, I'm going to break your candle.


No, I said, Kate, I was like, if anything you gonna need that candle. I said, Kate, I you, you fix this Because lately my threats have been like, listen Kate, I'm gonna smash your candle or your face. Do you not remember? And that's crazy because when have I ever threatened Kinzie? I don't, I never threatened Kinzie's stuff. You have that was, that's the first thing We said. That was the first thing we said when Kinzie moved in was, anytime you guys are mad, you leave. Ken Cash is never allowed to touch anything that belongs to Kenzie or Maverick And Kenzie. Because if it belongs to Maverick Kenzie, then that also belongs to Kenzie. Kenzie Well, kin does stuff that I ask him not to do like fart. There's nothing I Can do to, to get him to stop. Okay. But he can't help farting.


No, thank You. Can you're right. Preach Carl. He can't but he can't purposely help from putting his butt in your face while you're sitting down and doing it and going, ha, sometimes my belt is loose. No it's not. My belt Is loose. You know the funniest part of that story, I think that you didn't tell was that after Mav was saying that he was Yeah, wait, smashed the candle. Wait. Yeah. I would never smash a candle, by the way, Zach, I forgot what happened after that. What happened after that? Oh, you don't know. He's about to be real mad. Oh no. Was he gonna say that? Now? Be quiet. Okay. Okay. Anyways, then he's like looking for something that belongs to me or Maverick. And he's like looking in the kitchen. Everything in the kitchen belongs to Kate.


Everything in the kitchen is cakes. And he's like, I gotta grab something. He grabs a butcher's knife this long and sticks it behind his, but he like, I'm gonna fart on it. I'm gonna Fart on. I'm like, you better be real careful with that because he literally almost himself with a butcher's knife in his butt. Wait, So up. He What? You're what Did you Kenzie or I'm going to fart on your bed. Better yet, Kinzie did it Actually, I was forced. We forced. What happened? What'd You do? I can't tell you what happened. Oh, I can't Open the Door Fabric.


We can stop. Unfortunately, there's nothing I Can do except grab something of Kate. See what I'm talking about guys? The only thing I Can, the only thing we could do is use the women as leverage. Casey, You can stop this by telling us what you did. So like right now, my options are I could pour something on Kate, I'll break something. A Kate tell me. No, you gotta come out. I'm gonna tell you. Okay. There's just nothing around here. See, there's nothing up here that belongs to Kate. You like this guy? Yes. Down. What is it? You like this guy? He, I have your teddy bear. He said you like this guy. Kenzie, tell us what you did. Tell me what? You dated me or he gets it. You'll get Mav. We really should fix this. Nope. Harper Heath gave that.


Hey, come on. Sit down by your microphone. What happened Mav? What? What? What was that? Kinzie did it. Gosh. Okay. Actually put her stuff down at bet. She was a very participant accomplice. What happened? I don't know if Kenzie wants me to say, come on Kenzie. I won't go back in there. Come on. I won't go back in. Wow. Okay. I won't go back in. I already have what I need. He has to throw. Dude, that's not even worth. Nevermind. Wait, What happened? All right, now tell me what happened or he sit there after we tell you what's gonna happen. That guy's losing his head. I know. So just please. So unfortunately I can't tell you. Please tell us what happened. That's crazy.


She tells you what happened. You're gonna kill that guy. I know. Let hold it. Let hold. Guys's gonna steam down his pants. Hurry dam. Listen. He's more expensive than what you have 60 seconds to do. Okay? Okay. Okay. Maverick. What Was like, we have to destroy something of his And I was like, oh, we don't have to do anything. And then he runs over and he is looking through the kitchen for something. That's Your, I said, this man has farted on me for the past five years. I'm done with it. I'm doing, I'm taking action today. Okay. And so the only thing that was left in the kitchen, because Kate cleaned it up so nice, was a poker set. And so Look how mad he's look at him.


Okay. He Opens the poker set and he's like, okay, we're gonna throw the queen away. We're gonna throw this one away. And how about this ace? We'll throw that one away. And I'm like, no, no, don't throw away. So I take them from him, right? And before I could take them to save you, he rips them in half. And so then this is where I was forced. No, she was participating in the whole thing. No I wasn't. No, you have to rip them. I, no, I know You're lying. Well, it was something like that, you know, I was trying to save them and he ripped them before I could take them. So Don herd my cow. Well keep talking.


So, so then I took them from him and I was like, we have to get rid of the evidence. And, and so I, The cards were still usable at this point? No, they weren't. They were ripped out. I mean, probably not, but you could use them. So I had to light them on fire. But then you walked outta your bedroom. So I so you panick. So I quickly put them out and put them under the drying mat. And then you walked out and you were like leaning on top of the drying mat. And I was like, oh no, Debbie, She's right There. And then I was like, he's gonna be able to smell it, obviously. What's a drying mat? The black mat that we put our dishes on to dry. Okay. He looks So hurt. Oh no, no.


Continue. Anyways, then you're sitting there telling, I have a story just laughing up a storm while you're leaning on the drying mat, which really is the death of your queen of hearts or whatever it is. And, and then you finish your story and you fill up your little jug of water and you go to bed. And then I was like, Harvey, Harvey and light them on fire again. And it was taking too long. So I put them out and we threw them in the trash. The little like burn pieces were all in the trash. Yeah. Oh My gosh. That's really so, So if you're looking for your queen of hearts, it's it is gone. Is it just the queen of hearts? No, it's like half the deck. No, it's So you lit my board game on fire. Well, first guys, let me get this correct because I shifted No, no, no.


It was repeated. So you lit my board game on fire. It was a repeated offense. Okay? You, you, you did it for too long. And I did not destroy them. I just had to get rid of the Don't leave Them alone. Leave it alone. Leave it alone. Remember, remember the reason they did it was because you farted. Okay. You can just let this go. Like you. Let the fart go. Come on. Yeah. No, you better not toot on my warming. No. Oh wait, He's gonna do much More. Did he rip him? No, he, he ripped this off my little. What are doing with cash? Whatcha doing that?

Everybody saw that She, that's actually something that she liked and she used and you genuinely, you told her to throw it away and she didn't. So you told your brother to cut the head off. The Way I'm being framed right now is crazy. Like that end all just happened instantaneously. Cash brought in there, looked for something to kill, finds a cow comes out and now suddenly I told him to go get the cow and kill it. No, I don't think you told him to get the cow, but I think once you saw that he had the cow, you got excited. You said, this is my time. Were You excited when I got the cow? No, I'm not accomplished the smile. No, I'm not. Y'all trying to make me an accomplice.


Actually, you're trying to make me the main murderer. When I never even touched a weapon. Hey, that's my chain. I'm sorry. Hey, I'm so, so outta breath. I'm Sorry about your Cow.

You just don't, you don't anything Guys, I'll tell you the truth. 'cause I saw the truth unfold and unravel. Thank you. So cash ran in the room. Yep. We need a dramatic playback of these Events. Okay. Ready? Ready. This is what I saw and I know is the truth. Cash ran in the room. He tried very hard to close the door. So Kenzie wouldn't get in. Please. No, no. No, don't get in. Kenzie finally closed the door. He ran back in, he called the cow. Hi cow. He went behind the wall. He asked Maverick, he went, cut the head off. Should I cut that? And Maverick looked and I was looking at him when he did that, but I didn't know.


I like looked through the wall and I don't know if when I was looking, Maverick was like, yes, but when I looked back. So you, you missed the key Parts to the story. Wait, But when I looked back, Maverick was like, and then that's when I came in and I was like, for the clout? Yes. And then She's like, for the storyline count Must die. So, so that's when Cash ran downstairs. Kate ran too and her dramatic fast pace and he came back up and got the knife. And that's kind of the story. The end of the life of the cow.
