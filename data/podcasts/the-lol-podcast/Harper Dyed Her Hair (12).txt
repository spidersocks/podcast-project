Decided to be angry. No, she does That a lot. That is not true. I do Not decide to be angry. I'm kidding. Alright. Right. What were you mad at? No, I think for like two minutes before the podcast I just got really like, overstimulated and a little like high strung because like, we had just filmed like an episode that was close to an hour and a half and it felt forever. And then I go downstairs and I changed and I was like, gosh, we still have a whole other episode to film and Harper's gotta get home and study for finals. And we started late today. Oh my gosh. And I, and then I'm starving. I'm really hungry. So I'm eating a bag of granola and, and then I come upstairs and the podcast is just like trashed. And I'm like, are we gonna reset this? No, we're not gonna reset it. We're just gonna go ahead and film the second episode. And I'm like, okay. And then Cash's like, okay, can you, can you get the TV on?

That's all I am. What the heck? You are the TV girl. Some people are starving. And this is your issues. No, I I'm telling you, I was just high strung and then you were really asked me to do something and I I, our studio is trashed and I'm hungry and we're taking way too long to get these episodes filmed today. And Harper's got a study for finals and that's why I was a little bit snappy. And that's all I was saying. I'll say some quick points. Short, long story short, Kate's hangry. Yeah. Sounds like it. Harper doesn't need to study for finals. Yes I do. Yeah. And apparently, apparently my clothes can't be thrown on the floor. My Finals are tomorrow and I don't have any on Friday.

It was. That's A valid app. It is a magic floor. And I, before marriage, I said, there is one thing I really want. You are so right. A magic floor. I warned you. I said, listen Kenzie, Matt's gonna want a magic floor. Yep. That's all I asked for. And she said, whatever. I Can deal with the magic floor. It's just No, no, no.

Listen, Go on. I feel like every podcast episode, no, I'll just kidding. I just get in trouble more. Oh, You can't say say it. The ball gots so big. I know. Like everyone got on the edge again just for Matt to let us down.


Sorry, I got jumped. I looked around the right again. Matt, just say it. We can cut it. I really can't. Oh my God. I don't think he can. I think I like, it'll be worse than the cake on my face. Kenzie, on a scale from one to 10, how mad would you be if he said it? Well, I mean at this point he's basically said it. So say It. So say it. Sure. You can say it because you're probably gonna say it. I, Oh, it's coming work a lot. But Kenzie works a lot also. And then on top of that she tries to take care of the bedroom. She cooks for me. She's got a lot on her plate and I got a lot on my plate 'cause she cooks for me. Okay. That's story. Okay. But that was crazy.


Anyways, after I, my plate, I go to the room at night and during the day and things and I walk in there and the last like week there's been like piles of laundry and I'm like, I don't know what this laundry is. And then I found out it's all clean and it's just on the floor and piles. Well I mean who would do that? Yeah, exactly. So I said, I don't understand what's going on. I don't understand. And then she, she got mad that I got, she thought I was mad about the laundry. 'cause I was like telling her, if you don't have time to do the laundry, you said we need to figure out a solution. You know? No, He was looking for a white shirt and She said, she said, well why don't you do some laundry?


And I said No, that wasn't part of the deal. Okay. Magic four. Magic four. Okay. And okay, keep going. Yeah. So anyways, there will no longer be Magic Floor and, and I'll be helping with the laundry and yeah, that's, that's that. McKenzie what's your side? He is looking for a shirt and he walks in every, keep in mind they play Smash Bros. Every night. Not Every night. Every night. How much often do we fight Smash Pros? Three times a week. 20% of the nights. How? 20% Opinion. Kate, how often do they play Smash Pros. That's biased.


That's so biased Opinion. No, I'm being so serious. I would say the last, I don't mean, I don't mean to let you catch a stray pa, but ever since Fa got here, listen, all I'm saying is that the Bois never had a fourth person to play smash with. So when Pave got here, they realized there was a fourth guy to play Smash with. Okay, blah blah blah. We play Games. And ever since you guys, you It's all your fault. No, it's Not Paige's fault. You guys are the married mid and you should learn to balance your time with your friends and your wives and your work better. I would say overall you guys are playing Smash at the very least 50% of the week. Which is too much. When you have a wife that you have to come to bed to and you have to prioritize time with her as well.


Yo, I wouldn't care if Loki like Yes you would. Shut up. Sorry. Golly. That's what I'm saying. If your man wanna play Smash, let him play Smash. That's not the Problem. The problem is not the smash. The problem is that Can you scoot over a little bit into your mic? Hold on. I'd like to make it known. Two things. One, to make it sound like we play Smash without you guys and we're not trying to spend time with you is crazy because we have invited both of you with, you guys are choosing not to spend time with us. No, because we, no one should try to take an interest in what your husbands are interested in. Yes. No, that's not the point though. I don't sit there and I don't make cash read my books because I like to read books or I, I've always wanted to watch a romance movie with cash.


He will not watch one with me. I don't sit there and force him to watch romance movies. I don't believe in it. Let me ask you this. When you lay down at night, do you read your books sometimes while he's there? No. I turn on the Touch Me Brain. Roger on TikTok much better. I try get Much better to get, I try to get something to do with cash. I try to talk to him. I try to watch tv. Okay. Alright. I try to do anything. We aired out all it's, is this A cake or the couch? That's the couch. Don't eat that it cake or couch. Let's find out. Alright. Kenzie say your, say your side here. I don't care that he plays Smash Bros. Her side starts with then I'm sorry, go Ahead. No it doesn't. Oh, I don't care that he plays Smash Bros. I care that he plays Smash Bros and then proceeds to walk into the room and be like, why isn't this done?


No, I never said that after Smash. That's that's Crazy. That is crazy To say that. That's crazy. Why isn't this done? I Didn't say that. That's just putting words in my mouth. Hey, but the women say about it, you know how many times I've heard why isn't the shelf fixed yet? I just got done playing Smash Bros. Why isn't this done? Why is the room not cleaned? Why am I not fed? Why isn't the Trash taken out? Why am I not fed? Listen, you know what? I've never had to hear though, Maverick. Why isn't the credit card bill paid? You know why? 'cause That Bill, it's always paid. Big paid is on auto pay. Yeah. That thing was not auto pay. Never get paid. Hey, my bad. I thought I set the laundry to auto too.


This is a crazy conversation. I don don't need so much trouble. I understand. Why don't if if laundry's like a big deal, I mean, Why don't you guys just hire out a a Oh, Why don't we And have Maverick pay for it. Yeah, Why don't we, Oh, I'm done. Nevermind. I say all, but I just said I just take it back. You guys can pay me. I'll do it for you. No you Won't. No, no. It was for real. Like we have like cash. We are all very, very, very busy. We don't really have time for laundry. Like, I'll be honest, none of us. Why don't you guys like, like pay someone to do it, especially with all our laundry because we have to shoot multiple things a day, which means we have to change clothes like three, four times a day sometimes. And we're getting all of them dirty like fish And not just dirty cakey and peanut buttery.


So laundry's a lot of work around here. It's Sticky and gooey. Yes, you Do. Yeah. So I mean why is my solution not valid? I don't know. I wish I would've thought of that myself. Oh wait. Oh, oh, did I hit a sensitive topic? Did I hit a soft for Not for cameras? Yes, but it is for microphone. So here you go. Nope, no for microphones You're audio. No, There is just like I, 'cause I agree. I really, I mean if someone were to come in and like do all of our stuff like clean and laundry, like that helps. But also at the same time, just the way cash, Alex will set the camera a angles up every single episode. But you have to double check it and make sure it's the way you like.


That's the same thing with us. We want our laundry done the way we Want. Exactly. So why would you want me touching the laundry? Ju You would learn, We put so much into these videos. Like every episode I've realized that we get it all dirty. Like we put so much into these episodes. Well, it's not just these, we have like 10 other channels that we film on every, every day. Yeah. We Do a lot. And so that's a lot. Not Me. Yeah, yeah. But you're in school, so you're busy too. Yeah. You are filming. Yeah. You are doing school work. I'm getting in shoveling, scoop And then dying. Your hair on the side. I mean, no, laundry was not the topic I thought this episode was gonna be about, but No, we are man, things happen. Hair, laundry. That's the topic of my head. I've had, I've had two like obnoxious you.


Oh, you know what? If we're talking about your laundry issues, we can talk about our laundry issues. We've never had laundry issues. Kate? Me? No, But I really don't like, I'm trying to make things better for them, so. Oh, okay. We're gonna relate. No, I, I Can relate. I Can relate. No, we, we, we went out and we filmed our music video this weekend and cash, when he goes out to film music videos, he grabs like his whole closet. And because my brain can't let the clothes be outside of the house in like a dirty studio and then just hanging back up on the rack, like they're clean because they're not clean. Yeah. Even if they didn't put them on, they have to be washed again. Yep. So I've had like a hue humongous pile of laundry that has been sitting on the floor for like a Week. Well that's what ours was. Same thing. It was that pile that was from, from the music video, which she cleaned them, but then they had just sat there dirty or sat there clean.


Well, Yeah, well putting them away takes time too. Oh. And then I sorted the piles and he mixed them all together. Yeah. Because there was four piles in the room. So I tried to help, which you know, I was told to do and put them all in a pile. Yeah, listen. Got in trouble. I think who's at fault here is the viewers because we just are doing so much for you guys. We have no time to Do our laundry. You know what else? They came here to see us Talk about Harper's hair. All right. Yeah. So let's clip farm for a second. Get some No, Harper was what came Over you to do this though. Like I kind of vibe with it. Yeah. Did you not like red hair?
