Basically seven days away from her dog because I had to take her dog early. Okay. She like, it's gonna be seven days away from my dog. She spends seven days away from you all the time. That's what I said. I said, I said, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. You're going on vacation and you're worried you're gonna miss your dog. She was like, yeah. She didn't say nothing about you, did she? It's gonna be so hard. She said nothing about you gonna be so hard to not see my dog that I lock up all day while I'm at work anyways. Oh, And. I puts it in a little prison. A little prison. Is there any the garage right now in the dark garage? It's in the dark Hot garage. No she's not. The lights on point Is, I found out my place.


Did you turn the light off? It's so low. Oh, It was off When? I It. It's below dog sitter. It's unpaid dog sitter. It's at the very bottom. That's where I stand with with her right now. It's dog sitter. You realize that's going to be your dog. So it's actually you're a dog owner in Like a month and a half. Well, if I'm part owner of the dog, I got some opinions about that dog. First off, Matt wants it to be dead. No, never said that. No, that never said I. wanna, I wanna? Yes. He doesn't. I did not. I'm gonna throw it in a blender. Yes you did. Never have. I said that. A big blender. The biggest never have I said that. It's a cute dog. It's a great dog. What are the great dogs? She's a very pretty dog. It's gonna end up at Panda Express. That's where that dog's going. Listen, no personally, dog is a delicacy.


I've always wanted to know what it tastes like. I mean. Dude, You don You. don kidding. No, I would never eat your dog babe. Babe. I would never eat your dog as a donkey. That's not okay. As a donkey. Yeah. I think it's okay because listen, why do we eat every animal? But if somebody eat, no, I draw the line at dogs I mean a cat. Why? Why is that? People are so fine with eating. don. Don't cats cows. but like, if it's a dog, everybody would think you're like some cereal chicken messed up cu pig. Chicken pig, cow horse. Oh no. Maybe rabbit. A pig in like deer. Mm. That's it. Why? I Oh, easy a fish. I'm eating fish all day. I don't get why? We just randomly fish have no feelings. Why do we just randomly pick and choose?


Because ones that I can look at. and I'm like, mm. Because they're not the cutest. I don't care. Well, Cows are cute and Deer are cute. Deer are pretty cute. I've only ate deer once more. Hey fish. Get the worst end of the deal. My mom tricked me. People fished him just for sport. so you pretty much stab it in its mouth just for fun and then throw it back in. Yeah. That's kind of crazy when I think about it. Like, and then, and then somebody imagine doing that to a dog. They're like, oh, I got one. They're real by the mouth with a hook. Yeah. Like I, I'm not gonna lie, people would lose their mind kind of messed up fishing like, but are fish really even like conscious? No, they don't feel it. Like, that's What I'm saying. I know. Like, do they have a brain? And I'll tell you what, actually I didn't have a brain fricking, I'll say it, I'll say it.


Stop fishing. Except for sharks. Oh, I'm so down to serial killing sharks. Say, I say we ar 15. Those bad boys. I don't think we sharks. Yes. I think all sharks should die. I say we send all prisoners on some boats 'cause they got good aim or they wouldn't be in prison. And we let them, if you, if you kill 10 sharks, we set you free 10 sharks for your freedom. Well, you Know what I found out, which is kind of really sad, but people like fish for sharks in the ocean and they'll like catch sharks cut their fins off for to make fin fin soup or something. Yeah. Shark fin soup. Fin. And then throw the rest of the shark back in the ocean. But he doesn't have his fins anymore so he can't swim. Is that so he just sinks to the bottom of the ocean.


Is that what happened in Nemo? No. Oh. That's who we should dress up as next Nemo. The Finding Nemo cast. Is That Robin Nemo? Yeah. She's that little girl with the braces. No, I I no guys, I swear if we dress up as that, I'm not being a little girl with the braces. Everybody calls me that. No, you already that girl. Nobody called. Nobody calls me. You know who that girl reminds me of her. Y'all have seen Monsters Inc. Boo. oh, Yeah grown up just a little bit more. She's like 13. Oh, she's got braces? Yes. He kind of does. Yeah, she went bad evil also Kate, just because the shark loses its top fin doesn't mean it's sinking to the bottom of the Ocean. No, it it loses all its fins. Oh. So he just sinks all its fins.


He's just a, he's Fless. He's just like a little noodle And. it goes floating around. He's I mean a seal out there. I wonder what it looks like Shark into a Little, little, but someone said, gosh, I wish I could remember who told me this, but you guys know how there's been all the shark attacks. Yeah. Someone said that. They just made it illegal to do that. So you're not allowed to like fish for sharks. Yeah. No more shark attacks. It's illegal. No, no, No. There's so That feels so much safer in the ocean. Ever since they made that illegal. They should have done that a long time ago. Know they made fishing for sharks like that illegal this year. Oh. So this is the first year that people haven't been fishing for sharks like that. So there's a lot more. Well, shark attacks The, 'cause you know, usually the shark, a lot of sharks die each year at the cost of fence soup.


I, It sounds like we need bring, we need to start eating more offense. So y'all are Gonna believe it. But what, one time I've, I caught a shark in, in Alabama and or Gulf Shores and, and, and I held it and there's a photo of me holding it. The shark. The Baby shark. Shark? Yeah. That was a baby shark. Shark baby. Shark. Shark dude. Okay. No. Yeah, we probably should Don't do that. That's the worst song ever. We could dress Up as that. Yeah. What But what, what's it called? What were you about to do? I didn't like that. Like she's about to break out a song. And. it was her moment. High school musical second. I thought we were in a musical.
