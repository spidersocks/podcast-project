If she has acne, it's someone else's fault. Which is crazy, crazy thing to say. Yeah. Everyone, everyone ever dermatologists doctors, they've all told me that the reason my acne is so bad is because I'm in a high stress environment. And I'm not Joking. This is not a high stress environment.

No, I'm not doing that. I already have a bruise on my hip from trying to do it.

It's for us because Harper's leaving for a month. We got our live show coming up next week. Like a lot's going on. So we've been trying, we've been filming a lot. We wake up filming planning, got a lot of things we gotta get done in the day. It's like working until nine to nine. See, I say this is a boring conversation. Hey, minutes and the live show already happened like two months ago after this episode. Be quiet. I'm working. Let me cook. I'm working ladies. Okay. Singer Harper. Yes. You're just on Snapchat stories now. Wait, do you, do you not wanna be here right now? No, I Do. I don't Harper here right now. Please, please put a smile on your face. Do You wanna stay for dinner there? You apparently we're uninviting cash so You can have his plate.


Really? We are. Cash is uninvited to dinner. Kate, you're still welcome. Thank you. It's just cash. Cash. Are we locking him in the bedroom during dinner time? We should. Yeah. He, he was being mean earlier and honestly, I don't talk about this enough, but it hurt my feelings. What did he do? Cash. What'd you do? I don't know what he's talking about. No, once I say it, it's out there, man. Do you want this out there? Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out. Okay. He's got nothing. Oh, I do. Harper's on her phone again. There's this thing called Cassius time and he only runs on Cassius time and he is inconsiderate about everybody else's time.


Very inconsiderate about time. You feel this? I Can tell you're resonating with me. I do resonate with you right now. Mom. Before The podcast, I was like, Hey, we need to, to get going. 'cause you know, I got a dinner at eight o'clock. I got people coming over and we're cooking for him. So like, we gotta like, wait, people are coming over, people are coming over and I'm cooking for him at eight. Okay, so you never told that. You never said that? Well, I shouldn't have to because tell you, Marick has a thing when I tell you, Hey, here, agree with me. No, no has a thing. No, you're still not allowed to talk. Okay, go. No, you're still not allowed. Go listen. So, and, and you're trying to invalidate my feelings, which is very wrong because my feelings are valid. Oh, I don't care what you say. I just hurt myself with Gerald. Hold on. Let, well, I don't even know why you have him.


If you don't have the Gerald, then you can't talk math. Share your feelings. What I feel, I I personally feel like cash doesn't care about me at all my time. Oh my God. Speed this up. We're trying to, I was trying to start the podcast and I was like, Hey, we gotta go. And he's like, we will start in a minute. We can I start in a little bit because that's my issue right there. You don't have the jail. You don't have the Jail. We had a time set to start at, it was five o'clock. Okay. Harper was like five minutes late. That's okay. But Harper's here. I'm here. Kenzie's here. We're sitting down waiting to start. Camera's ready. Alex is ready.


We're just sitting here waiting while you sit on the stairs and, and guess what? No, no. 'cause none of you, None of you do today. None of you help with anything. You guys are family Your biggest Concern? No. No. Think about it. Your biggest concern today is, oh, I need to get all the, we need be done with the pod so I Can have my friends over while before the episode. I'm over there planning our live show that we're all having and doing that. And Maverick's biggest concern is like, let's start so I Can go have my fun and not pay attention to work. My fun. Let's start. I have to cook that for you's. That's your biggest concern. No, the problem is you're trying to do that at, that could be done after when we have to shoot our ads. That can easily be done after. No, no. The ads that I told you to shoot five times and you won't do it. So It's your fault that you have to shoot these ads.


Its fault, fault. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's your fault. Mom and dad are fighting again. Alex, can you come on set for just a second? The podcast, the, This is literally, I, We Now he's crossed the Line. Oh, my acne is coming out. Is this man, My acne is forming right now. This Man is a liar. Who's The mom in this Situation? We, we had the ad ready to go, did we not, Alex? Totally. And then today he said no, they want a brand new one. So I said, okay, we'll shoot it and we're gonna shoot it after. And then you also said today that Harper has to shoot an ad, which means max. No, I'm talking, which means there was, it was inevitable. And so we could be doing that little 15 minutes that you caused us to be late. We could have done why we were shooting ads.


I called and texted you today. No, shut up. My feeling to apologize. This Is the wrong podcast. I this is like such a real conversation right now. Yes, because listen, this is Not say this was scripted three. Can I have the jail? No, I have it. So all y'all can suck it. Listen, you stole it. Listen, Maverick, you stole That. I drank your finest. Pardon? Listen Maverick, you don't have to. So you can't talk now I called and texted you and Alex three days ago. Oh, the He's Forming. You guys don't have the stick and we have the ad ready Three days ago I said film this ad and you did not film it. You said, no, we we have it ready. You didn't film it. We didn't. And I told you, I said we're gonna do the same one 'cause the same exact screw. Yeah. He was lazy and just wanted to do the same one. No, they sent the same thing twice.


You don't have the Gerald, you stole it. Stop. You don't have the Gerald do my hair. Stealing doesn't make it. Yours does it. And the the, I don what this breaks down to is Maverick gets mad that he has to do work instead of stop. Fine. Please don't slap me. He just wants to please don't slap me. He just wants to go dance. He just wants to go out to eat. Don't wanna go dance. He just wants to do anything besides work and pin it. Don't wanna leave the house. And then if I'm like, Hey ma, this needs done. He gets mad. Guys just wanna cook dinner for you guys. I'm bro So serious. I can't even do that. Can we cut? Start over. I'm being so serious. I don't think I Can handle this today. I'm just scared he's gonna spit on me and slap me. That's what I'm, I don get it. Nobody, nobody else cares. That's what I don't get. Would hate to see him. I care. Would hate to see him life out again. I tried, I tried to have a good podcast show and nobody cares. I come, I try, I I have the thumbnails ready.


People throw fits on what the thumbnails are, but nobody wants to help with them. We have, we sit down to talk. You guys are doing stuff. She's still ignoring us. Maverick is like, oh, I need to be done so I Can Can go eat and I'm the only one ever caring about the episode. This is what you sound like. This is how, this is how you sound like. Well my friend, it's like math, math tonight. He's gonna go eat. And guess what I'm gonna have to do? I'm gonna have to come up with the thumbnail that goes out tomorrow morning. You're gonna come eat with us. No, the thumbnail that goes out tomorrow morning is what I'm gonna be worried about tomorrow morning. Is already, already work already and the already done and all that stuff. Gosh, you're just such a liar. What do you mean? How am I a liar? Lies. How lies? Well you just lie. How am I a liar? Sometimes, sometimes we do have days like this. You just lie. No, I'm not talking about a lying.


I'm talking about someone has just been fed up because we are all overstimulated because there's so much that needs to be done in such a short period of time. You we're a little tense and the arguments start to come. And that's just what today is. That's one of those days. You know what Would help? And it's unfortunate that it Happening on would he would start to recognize that everybody else does work around here. And not just Tim, but he doesn't care about anyone else but himself and his own time. And that's the truth because you don't do nothing. You're conceded you don't, nothing you don't do. You conceded arrogant little kid. And that's often happens. Nothing when you're the youngest child. You don't, it's not your fault you have youngest child syndrome. It's it's because you don't do nothing. No, exactly. You don't con you don't consider anybody else's value what they do. You think if somebody else comes up with 10 thumbnails, it doesn't matter.


'cause you came up with one. For instance, I came up with all the thumbnails today. Today for instance, I did everything today instance do anything. This live show that we planned. I planned planned book the entire live show. I planned, I planned the, what's it called? I made sure we have the intro for the show. The I entire show. I paid to the venue. I ordered all the mer know. Didn't do that. We had a, the merch, I ordered all p badge, all the bracelets. I made sure we have the steam cannons coming. I make sure we have the first can square things to take payments. I make sure we have everything. The square things. I, This morning this is going not You, Jack, ask mom, I handled it this morning with Bobby. You Can do doing it right now. This is going to get bad. Okay. This is, someone's about to go through a wall that's about gonna And not, well What do you mean?


And Maverick has this thing to where earlier when I'm working, doing things for the whole entire show, he's sitting over there just saying, Hey, let's start, let's start. Not saying he has anything else planned. We are running. Because he doesn't wanna say that he has other plans tonight because he knows I'm working. And for him to be like, cash, can you get done with work so I Can go have fun? Have won't say that I'm cooking dinner for you. You No, I don't want, I don't want your dinner. I don't care to have your dinner. And you're not cooking it. Yeager is downstairs. No, I'm cooking it. Yeager's cooking it downstairs. I I'm cooking the show Cooking. Yager. Yeager is Kate Yager.

I don't wanna be his brother anymore. I don't wanna be here anymore. Honestly. I'll be really probably need to cut all of that. Why? Because it's boring. I told you if I don't talk, it's gonna be boring. No, it's boring because you're talking I I have no, I have a list of conversations and all the stuff we can talk about, but I'm not gonna do it. Oh my goodness. So we'll see what we can talk about this episode. No one wants to talk when you're here. Okay. Go leave. I'll be quiet. See, let's see what you guys can talk about. I'm, wait, why, why Are you, we tried that and you kept interrupting. He, he just, here you are again. Now started an argument for no reason. I didn't, This makes me like physically ill. Okay. I'm not gonna bring up my notes or anything.


I'm just gonna be quiet. Okay. Harper had apparently my what'd do you school Day. I did chemistry and hated it so much. Can You tell me what you were gonna tell us before the episode? It's just that, I mean like, like, I don't know. Every guy's the same. Yeah. What, what'd this one do? I've never cried over a guy. Yeah. I'm in your private story. I've seen it. No, like actually though, like, it's so annoying. Like why, like why are guys like that? Like Cash did the exact same thing to you and you still went for him, but you're telling Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. And you're telling me up. They they eventually grow up. They do grow up. But I'm saying right now, like, I don't think you should waste your time waiting around for a guy that like, do you really even like him that much?


Yes. I don't think you do. I do very much. I don't know if you do Harper. I really do. Okay. I mean, if you think this man is your husband, I say waited. I don't, he's my husband, but exactly that. You don't like him that much. I Do. The reason I waited for cash that long was 'cause I knew he was gonna be my husband. So if I think like Zach Efron's gonna be my husband. Yeah. I mean, wait long enough. I mean, is Zach Efron married? I don't even know. Well, Not actually, not actually, but like, you Know, dude, have you seen him lately? Kind of crazy. So What?

I'm kind of scared for like the shows and stuff to like, I don't know how the audience would react to me after I've been gone for who knows how long.


But yeah. So, and you Might join us for the tour during the summer. That's what the plan was is I told them like I needed to be back for those two months. 'cause they said that there was gonna be like a small break and it was just happened to be then. But yeah, I just, So Well, I'm glad Mav pause the episode for this Mav stop eating. Have, Are you kidding? No. Okay. And not to be insensitive, but do we have to start over or can we start from where we stopped? Should we just start over? No, I don't have time for dinner.


What we got. Okay, how about we just film like three tomorrow, whatever day it is that we're filming. It's supposed to be club tomorrow. This is our last po. Yeah, this was supposed to be the last podcast and then, because by the time Harper gets back, I'm gonna be leaving. So it would be like my last one for a while. Do You have cheer tomorrow Harper? No. Or yes? I do actually. I tumble dude. Oh my gosh. Kate, please don't leave me. I mean, I can't, like, I have to, it's not really optional.


I I already told him I would do it. Yeah. I told them I would put the cookies Down. Yeah. I don't know. But that's it. I already told them I'm doing it. I gotta leave right after Thanksgiving. I'll be back probably about the end of May for two months and then leave again about August. Oh my gosh. Can we have the master bedroom? I still can't believe this. Like I Mav Mav. What? It's not the time to bring that up. He Doesn't know how to be sad. So he brings Jokes. Things. Well y'all tax doesn't need the master bedroom by himself. No, he does. That's his bedroom.


He's a big boy. I'm just, Okay. I That was a joke. I I obviously we're not gonna Yeah. Know it's a joke. Obviously we're not gonna take your room, Kate. No, I know you're not going to. I still can't tell if this is like real life or not, or you are. No, it's hilarious for you because you're not the one I'm gonna leave your spouse for six months. I, And he can't even freaking come out and visit me. I just, like, I and I can't come back here. I don't, I I, I'm so sorry. Like, I, I just can't believe this. Like, I physically can't, like there's no way you're leaving for 12 months. Well, I'm leaving for six and then back for two and then another six. So There's no way. Yeah.


Anyways, that's the news. Y'all wanna start again? Math. You should really apologize. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Can we fix that light? It's so loud. Loud. It is buzzing. You want me be done? We need like at least another like 20 minutes. I actually need you here with me, Kate. Okay. We can pick up now, but we still need like another 20 minutes for the rest of that other episode. What are you gonna say? Like, we're back or? Yeah, I just say we're back. Bring it Back. Just start arguing with Ka again. No, that, that's not, we don't have time to restart.


No. Kate and Harper don't wanna do it now. Like I'm fine with doing it. I never said that. I didn't. I'm just so sad. I know I have to. I don't wanna leave you guys. No, there's no way. Look at me with straight face and tell me that you're moving. I'm sorry. Are you seriously? I don't want to. You are not even going with cash. No, He can't come. He has to stay here. It's like if you were to leave then the whole podcast, like you can't do the podcast with just three people. Like it needs to be four.


So it's like, if he leaves then and there's no reason that the podcast should end. Just 'cause I got a different job for a year. But it's fine. I'll come back and hopefully fit back in and people still want me. People are still gonna want you Kate, Maybe. No, they are After a whole year of not being in episodes. That's a lot. No, they're gonna miss you. I mean, they might at first, but it's like, I don't know. You get used to it. You get used to change and then you, someone's Gotta yell at me. You yell at you over the phone. Probably. Like, you're probably still gonna be making me mad. Across the ocean. Probably Across the ocean.


Hatred transcends the ocean. I don't know. Well, let's finish this episode up and then we can talk. Okay, well let me, Harper Has wait. Yeah, 'cause because I just like, I, I'm in shock. There's no way there's abso what like Is my makeup and Stuff? Like what? No. Why'd you do? No, because we, we literally have three more shoot days until Harper leaves. And that's the last time Kate and them get to see each other. And now you roomed it all.


Well, Harper doesn't leave till next Monday, so. Yeah, but Kate wasn't gonna tell her until Next Monday. But don't you leave, but I Don't know when it was. No, but you, no, we're done shooting next week and then you're gone for a month and then as soon as you get back she's gone. So y'all won't see each other. So this is the last time that you'll see her for seven months. And Kate wanted to wait until the last day to tell you so you guys can enjoy the next three days. But AV just wanted to ruin it, so.

No, I feel Horrible. I Feel like terrible. Not about our joke. I just feel sad. 'cause like, no, as soon as we started the joke horrible. I knew Harper wasn't gonna believe it. She's like, I'm not believing this. I was like, Dang. I was trying to talk. I was like, I was like, I'm not gonna believe this. Like, I can't believe that. Like, there, there's no way. 'cause like I knew Kate wouldn't go up there by herself for No, I would never, I don't think there's any amount of money You can. It's a Stupid, I don't know why we would thought that would work. Yeah. I, We, she, we should at least said I was going with you. There's not a, there's not an amount of money you could pay me to make me leave my Yeah. Husband for six months Because I could tell that it was like, it wasn't real. Because like cash would usually try to make a joke out of it.


And like, and like Maverick was doing that. Yeah. We kind of flipped roles normally when it's real. I'm the one making a joke and you're the one telling me to shut up. Yeah. And we flipped it when we freaked out. Okay. Maverick trying to fake it. It was a blood joke and it ended. Maybe I didn't know how to act when it's fake and we Well, I'm Sorry. I love you so much. I love you. And it's gonna go by so quick. I'm kind of sad. I drank Hard. And guess what we're gonna, you're gonna do that and then it's gonna be Thanksgiving and Christmas and then and then what? And then we have a tour. Yeah. And Harper, we feel, we feel the same way about you. Like I've never had a little sister, but you're probably the closest thing I've ever had to a little sister. And Your little sister-in-law is looking at you like, what the freak dude? My little No.


Yeah. I mean that's Anna. Oh my gosh. No. And Anna's not Anna's like one year younger than you. Yeah. But like, I mean like for real, like me, I have never had a little like a little sister. We, our our sister was older, so it was always like different. And I, I obviously, I know we aren't like, like friends, like in that type of way, but I do look at you as like a little sister. Yeah. And we are all like family. I know. And we're really sad that you're, that we're like, we're sad to see you leave, but we're also like really excited for you to like, try something new. Like It's, but we'll cut that part out. Like, I mean, So, so We, we, we, we were, we might have had to cut something because somebody said something themed tiny bit out of pocket, but we're back.


Don't worry. You only missed like two seconds. What I said was I, no, I don't know. No. And I think Harper like I month sounds so long. It really does. But it's, it's not at all. Yeah. Like it's going by. Like, time goes by so quick And you know it's even worse. What? Like Everybody thinks I hate Kenzie. That that is worse. That is worse. I'm not gonna lie. All four of us are like on this side Kenzie's like, oh, That, that didn't cross my mind. And I was like, there's nowhere for me to go. That's so bad. And Harper was like, I even liked that one. I asked Matt to come sit with me. He said, no, I'll stay over here.


I'll be an observer. No. Gosh, this looks so bad. I Feel bad. Okay, now what about me guys? I was Like, for you to leave, It's like, I even like No, no. Matt, you gotta stay. You gotta stay. No, no, no. You gotta stay. Everybody on the couch here, you Get next to her. So she Harper we are gonna be very sad to see you leave here. I'm You bring so much joy. Not me, us Matt. The wave as the plane takes off And I'm, and that's why you are not on the blue couch, right? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm gonna miss my girls. I know. And and you're gonna miss me. Hey, all her girls. Oh, guys, we're just one big happy family. Al We're just A big happy family guys. One big happy family.


Big happy family. And we are, me and Harper are in the fire zone. It's a, It's gonna be sad to see you go, but if there was a time that I thought on Three Off one, three. You what? Oh yeah. Ow. Sorry. It just, there's not enough room up here. How child of the family, Harper, since we met you, you've grown up so much. Yeah, and I'll be honest, like even like nine months ago, I'd have been like, no, Harper's not ready for that. Yeah. But you've grown into such a strong person that I think it's, it's time for you to spread your wings, But she's spreading her wings to like, it's Time for you to go. It's time said that it's time for you to fly all the way to Canada.


You're spreading your wings to, to go to Canada. No way. Oh boy. Just said that. You literally were like, that was weird. You said I She was the little sister. Yeah. I said she's like a little sister to me. That's it. Yeah. You said spread your wings and fly a little birdie. Yep. That's definitely different. No, no, it's time. No, I'm, I what what Maverick is trying to say. I'll translate What There's no translation needed. It was English. No. Is that like, it is such a good thing that you get to go and do this because it's like, it's something you have wanted to do forever. That's why you did theater in school. That's why you like signed with an agency like you, you did all of this to get here and to go. Did Did we explain at all like what she's even doing? We just keep saying do this. Oh, we Don't know if we're, are we allowed To talk about it?


Yeah. She's in a movie. I don't, she's going to shoot a movie. They go a movie in Canada for a month. And that's like, once again why the dates are all outta wag. It's theater. We shot this episode like actually I, two months ago. No, her mom said you can't say anything details about it. You can say details. Oh yeah, ma, just shut up. Don't say any details. I I always give you say details. I'm so sorry guys. I always say things I'm not supposed to say. Yeah, You do. Anyways, this is like Harper's first like, official acting role and it's definitely a little intimidating, the fact that it's a movie and the fact that it's in Canada And it's such a big movie and that I'm missing Halloween And all the parties and it's okay. Like honestly, Halloween parties Are, you're gonna remember this Halloween forever. You will, you're gonna be like, I was 15 years old filming a movie In Canada.


Especially because I don't think they celebrate Halloween in Canada. So, no, I'm kidding. I I'm kidding. That's a joke. And honestly, you're just gonna like, you should just put your phone down on Halloween and not look at it. Yeah, yeah. That's what I would recommend. Yeah. But yeah, I think that it's a, it's really intimidating, but it'll go by so quick. Yeah. And you're gonna be so busy. Like honestly, you're gonna be so busy that it won't even seem like a month. Yeah. Yeah. Like think about how busy. Yeah. Kate, Kate, we Get it. No, no, no. But like, think about how busy we've been this last month trying to like film. Yeah. You're gonna be doing that. Just a different version. Yeah. She's not crying anymore. She wants you to stop talking. Kate. We got it. We got it. She's, she's not No, I'm trying to tell myself I'm crying. Okay. Till next time. Harper. Shut Up. Till next time.


But guys, also, I can't believe this prank backfired this bad. I really wanted to prank Harper and then be like, JK Matt had the thing run on his stomach. We had it all planned out. It all here, Matt. But it turns out Harper just caught onto our joke and made us all sad. So wait, what? This is the last podcast. This is it. Oh my gosh. You're just now catching on. No way. Well, no way. Okay, so you don't track very well. Matt, fix your mic and stop touching it. The very Next episode. So if this comes Out out on Wednesday, see us Saturday. If this comes out on Saturday, see us Wednesday, we're gonna be like woo Hunter's back. Yes. But like, it's gonna be like she never left. And I probably will have another different hair color by then. So. Well mare just can't stop touching his mind, dude.
