And then I'm gonna start scrolling through and don't mind if I'm just gonna throw your cards on the floor. Sorry. I'll pick them back up. Okay. I'm not really feeling any of these. If I'm being completely honest with you. I'm gonna be very impressive if this works. I'm not really, but it's one of these three.


All right. The Jack of Hearts, the Queen of spades or the the four diamonds. And I think this guy is, he is a big Jag guy. So is this you? Oh, that. He's So much better than you Kyle. He's so Destroy. That's the easiest magic Trick. That's, anyone knows what magic is. You know exactly what I did. It's just like what now? That was so Easy. How did you do that? Because I'm just dialed in. Like you're a musical magician. Exactly. Musical Mu. Alright. All I know Magic can you ing are while doing Magic All bro. I think. All right. So I know magicians aren't supposed to like reveal their secrets, but I'll let you know exactly how. Yeah, yeah. Let's see it. So I was telling you to like do this.


Okay. And then when I did this, I just looked at this card. Oh, right here. And I memorize it. And then I like shuffled around it. And I was like, oh, it's Man, you should never give your tricks Away like that. No, but it was cool. I'm not as impressed now. It was lame. All right, bro. Yeah. Your trick was bad. You ever heard a 52 card pickup? I have not. You haven't heard that trick? All right. You're not gonna do this. I figured it out. I'm gonna put these right here. Yeah. Yeah. So let's cut to the chase. I got a question. You guys were at Disneyland yesterday. We were. How Was that? It was fun. It was, besides almost having to s on Charlie. I'm not, I'm not gonna answer for her, but I just know I had a good time. I mean, I threw up. That's great actually. And they talked about it the entire time we went to dinner.


Wow. We went to dinner at like this nice restaurant in Disneyland and all they were talking about was how Harper threw up in the car. Wow. Harper, you. That's not what that is. You throw up though. I don dunno everybody What I did. Like what? While I'm eating, I'm like, Oh my God. Why? No, they actually only ordered bread, so I don't think, yeah, they didn't order pancake and it was like a really nice restaurant. So I don't understand. Yeah. Yeah. Because I think ish, she's a vegetarian and she didn't want anything because she threw up earlier in the day and I wasn't trying to be like a happy Wait, Salish Also threw up? No, No, no. She's just A vegetarian. She's about to probably, no, when I tell you I threw up in the car ish, like turned her head out and like started like going out the window like barfing almost like it was so bad.


I felt so bad. Well you threw up in the car. Yes. And Jordan had In the car, like on inside or outside. I threw up in a Starbucks bag, but I made no noise so se couldn't hear it. That's so gross. Oh my God. Man. I'm getting, And you know those chocolate pandas? The chocolate, like Asian pandas Harper. This is all they were talking about. Oh my gosh. Wait, the ones were like the little graham cracker and a chocolate inside. Yes. Yes. Those are my favorite Snack. Snack. I had like 18 of those. Oh. And I remember I threw 'em up and I threw up Harper. I saw a smiling Panda. Harper. Harper Harper. There are something. That's the type of stuff like, that's the type of details that she was giving while I was getting through them. My mouth. No, but she my goodness, no secrets. Well I know. And I was just like, wow, that was funny. And these people can hear us. I know. I feel so bad for the waiter.


There's no shot. He's watching this right now. But if you are the waiter, oh, oh my gosh, I feel so bad. They double know we bunch of bread. Yeah. They were like, these kids are insanely weird because we ordered bread only because Salish is a vegetarian and there was like nothing on the menu should eat. She could eat. There's like fish filets And stuff. Like, just not, not it. It was not. And then she like threw up earlier so she didn't want any food. So I was like, I'm not gonna be like that type of guy and just get something, you know? I didn't wanna take up that much time. So I just ordered break From Disney on March 21st.
