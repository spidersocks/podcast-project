But we film a lot of content with him where it's like we build like some of the most insanely difficult things to get through. Yeah. Like polycarbonate, which is like bulletproof. Oh, all these really cool things. Like we bought a bulletproof truck.


That's fun. And had him go through it. See if he could get in. Did he? You gotta Watch the video. He did. But We have one where it's a hundred layers of glass. And so we start off with like, like all the different types of glass. So the first one being like sugar glass. And then it gets like harder and harder and harder. And it's like glass they use in banks that keep people from like, getting in and breaking it. Wow. Yeah. And the guy that solds the glass is like, dude, this is what they put in banks. He can't get through it. Literally like three hits. He pulled the glass off No one. And dude, that's insane. Insane. And then the only thing he couldn't break was the bulletproof glass. Wow. Wow. Carbon. But he did so much damage that the entire wall that the glass was on fell down. So the structure around fell down. He could just walk into a bank man, just by himself.


That's a literal Hulk. Yeah. So that's crazy. Genuinely. Oh, and then we did a video with him where it was like world's strongest man versus airplane. So the final challenge, we rented this private jet to see if he could pull it better than 10 regular people. So That's great. He, he did. Wait, who is this?

I usually go behind. Yeah, we all do that. That was not what I was asking. Oh yeah. If you go front to back to front, that's just wrong. So wrong. When you wipe, do you stand up or sit down? I, I believe the correct way would be sitting. No, that's not what I asked. I said what do you do? Oh, I sit like You don't stand. I stand on the toilet seat. So I, That's the best way do you're not even, you drop the toilet paper right then and there.


Well now I'm like insecure. Is that know how you're supposed to do it? You Bitch Normal people do it. Yes. That's how mean you both do it. I know you stand up. Yeah. That's why no one can watch us. Okay. It's a very vulnerable position. That's gross. Shut Up. I'm serious. You're lying. No, I'm serious. And I didn't know I was alone. That makes sense. And then I found out No, he does it too. Wait, why? Does that make sense? Why? Does that make sense? Oh My gosh. Okay. Wow. I'm hiding. Is there stuff on the wall? Oh, Kate. No, No. I'm highly disturbed. Okay, so cash and I have black tile on the floor in our bathroom.


Okay. I don dunno where this is going and not true. And toilet paper, as we all know, is white for the most part. No, not for the most Part. He's white. Mine is always white. He's just white.

But every time I go in there, I never understood it. I was like, what? There's like little like little like shavings of toilet paper on the floor And I That is not from that.
