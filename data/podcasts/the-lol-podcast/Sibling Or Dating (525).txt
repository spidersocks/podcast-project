Welcome back to another episode. And on today's episode, Mackenzie, would you like to tell us why you're gatekeeping house plans?


Stop it. Huh? I'm sick of the slander. Would you like to tell? Because just to fill the audience in, right before this episode, I heard Maverick And Kenzie whispering in the hallway and I walk over there, I'm like, what's going on? What's happening? Sweet word. Whispering it. Cash butts in. Yeah. And I'm like, what's happening, Matt? What's happening? And Matt's like, go ahead, tell 'em Kenzie, don't worry. I Can put out this hot situation. Listen, here's what happened. All right. I'll keep it very cool. Like I, We, I'm sorry. Why did you all that Kenzie was over there? Like I cash was like, man, your house gonna be so expensive. And I was like, yeah, it is. Look at this like, time out. Time out. Look at this. Wait. Time out for y'all. That I don't know.


We just bought land and me and Kate are building a house and Maverick And Kenzie are building a house on the same piece of land. So continue, listen. Right? Okay. Right. So before this podcast goes up in flames, I just like to say, oh my gosh, that I am not a responsible party for That. I got these people's heads talk normal. Okay. Kenzie, No Talk showed me some ideas for her house. For our house. And, and dang, he just called it your house. That's how, that's How, that's fine. That's Fine. That's how much of a control freak you're being. Wow. Wow. And I was like, dang, that looks expensive.


And then later cash was talking about, he's like, man, your girl like expensive stuff. Your house about to be so expensive. And I was like, yeah, I'm look at itm. I'm building my house and a rectangle. 'cause rectangles and squares are the cheapest way to build a house. Yeah. Okay. So I'm about to, I show cash the pictures and he's like, dang, that's crazy. Your house ain't a rectangle. And then Kizzy comes out, I need a rectangle. And she's like, come here for a second. Can you just come here, come here, come here. Bring Did not say it. Yes she did. I thought, yeah, okay. And then, so I'm like, okay, why am I in trouble? And she's like, you are sharing our plans. You're sharing our plans. And we can't be sharing that.


That's for just us. We don't want them having house. Oh my Gosh. I don't talk Like that. And I didn't say it like that As us. Right. Okay. Glad we're on the same page. I was like, I don't understand. So you're making me so a little brat. That's not what said saying. Well, that's what I proceeded to call her. I called her a brat. What I did. And that up, don't I? You know what, you know, it is house building process. I've called Kate a brat a lot of times too. It's true. It's, I, We should get used to the term, honestly. So Kenji, Would you, so that may have been a first for you, but I Can assure you it's not the last Moral of the story. Kenzie is worried. All the cool stuff she wants to put in her house. No. Oh my God. Ka is gonna be like, that's dope. Let's put it in our house.


Which, which I don't see the problem. If you put in like, you know, like a cool fridge, why can't I put it in a cool fridge? My brother did that. You can put in a pool fridge. I wanna make a pink house with pink Pretty stairs. Ooh. Yeah. And you do that, you do that and you let The main, the main thing of the house, like the main attraction, the thing I'm most excited about, your House has attractions. One thing. It's the one thing I'm so excited about. Hey. Which is, and they Had to share it. Kenzie, which is what? Cool down. You're getting a little heated. Wait, what's the main attraction? I actually don't know. A little heated. Alright, we get it. 'cause you're a five fighter. Yeah. What's the main attraction? I'm just keeping things under control. What? Okay, we can move on.


Okay. So what's the main attraction? Isn't funny. Lights camera. Well, if you don't remember, I don't wanna tell you. Is it the stone wall that your fireplace gonna go up against? Because that was not, I hate listen, the stone wall is really pretty, but I hate to bring it to you. It's in a lot of houses. Oh yeah. Yeah. But like, It's the way, the stone wall. Oh no. Her dream is going up in flames. It's the way also, I don't understand why, why do you, your house have to be like unique? Like if you have a dope house, why does it matter if like a thousand of the people, a million other people have that house as long as you like it? Have y'all heard all the jokes that Maverick are making? It's not funny whatsoever, But it's kind of funny, right? Oh no. Her Dream's going in Flames.


Yeah. Like I don't understand. Like I'm kind of hot right now. Can I get it? Oh My gosh. I think Cassius Taco smells bad. Dad banging. You must smell banging probably. No, it literally smells like a, a cookie cake. Where's, where's that from? I don't even know. Like, how does a taco have a sweet smell? But yeah. Anyways, during this house building process, the girls have been getting a lot of slander their way. Yeah. Because they're like, we need to build this, we need to build this. And I'm like, you know what? We need to be grateful that we are building our own house. You know what? Not many people get to do that and take advantage of that in life. You definitely Not say That. Actually what? I did say that, yeah, he does. And then I pulled up a picture and then I pulled up a video of children in third world countries that barely have enough food to eat.


And I was like, tell them about your house problems. Ooh, You know what I do say every day? That always did that. Put out The fire. Maverick does not say that Actually. Yeah. Tell them about your Stonewall Kenzie. You know what? Actually, yeah, it made me cry today. I was talking about our house and It did, she was talking about it and I just flipped it around like mid-sentence. I was like, cry. It Was So sad. Yeah. And it was just kids scraping for food in a bowl in some third world country was like, that's really sad. Did it make you cry more than when you see me flamingo dancing? What? Nothing. He flamingo. It's funny Today of Flame Flamingo. What is he saying? Dude? Yeah, I Don, nothing's Funny. You're saying. I'm sorry. I'm a hot mess. Okay. No, but cash always fails to leave out. He is like, you're so, she just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


She just watched things, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I do actually, believe it or not, say every day, every day when we lay down for bed and we're about to fall asleep, I say, I'm so thankful for this life wheel every night. Man. I'm so thankful. Now let me complain about all the things I don No, I'm So thankful for this life that we have. I'm so thankful when we were living in, we are living in this house. I'm so thankful for this house we have. I'm so thankful that we finally have land to build two separate houses. Yeah, but you can't say that. And then follow it up with, but I don't, I wait till tomorrow to follow it up with the But What, what I, I say that with everything. Like even this taco right here, you know, if some, if Kate was to complain about this taco, I would just show her the same video of the kids starving looking for food in a pan where there's no food.


Yeah. And it's like, I don't even have smoke on now. Complain to them about your taco. What? You gotta cut it out. Sorry. Yeah. It's really not funny. And I'm not laughing. Can you like see my face and Not laughing? So when you put your life into perspective, you realize you're grateful for what you have and that you shouldn't be worried about these things that do not matter. This is true. Yep. Be more grateful. Guys. What, where my taco got grease all over it. Hey. Saying just like this. He's like, yo, that grease got some smoke on it. Yo, it's what type of greasy taco is this? Don't your Taco Harper.

I, I I would do that to my Siblings. I always put, I put my hand on your, on your chest.


Yeah. But it doesn't mean dating siblings would also do dating. I would picture She's a tough one. Take Picture with one of my brothers with my hand posted up like that. Yes. The hand, the wedding dress, the vows, the smiles. There's no ring. Are they siblings or are they dating? But they do look a lot alike. I think they're siblings, but that is, I I just wouldn't put my hand on my brother's chest like that. Yeah, I'm gonna say they're siblings. Okay. Kenzie? Yeah. I don I don't know. I mean, if there's no wedding ring on her finger, I guess siblings, no, but it could be on. But she's at a wedding in a white dress. It makes no sense. Wow. Maybe It's a wedding's. Well See there's other white dresses. So it's, it's a white dress party. Okay. It might not even be a wedding backyard. Yeah. It could just be like a, just A little hangout.


Little fireside. Okay. Siblings. Siblings. So everyone said, siblings, you are all correct. They're saying Yay. That's weird, right? Kind. Weird. Yeah. That's a, the hand placement's a little weird. Other than that different, they look like a nice couple. I mean kids, I Mean it's like a, a profess It's like a, It's a professional like post.

Yeah, because like Well I saw your show. Oh, I got hit by the steam can cannon.


Oh, I did. We were like going out on stage. And who? You, you are in control of the steam cannon? No, no I wasn't. I wasn't. It was my dad. Okay. Well James Baker, you plotted against me. Yeah, He is the steam cannon button. So I know he, wait. No, I don't think he did. But we were going out on stage and I was like going right by the steam cannon and I was stepping over it. He shot the steam cannon off and it hurt. So I was like, ah. While we were going out on stage. And I was like, ah. Yeah. And so, but anyways. Was it New York? I think it was Dallas. Dude, the first two shows we did, I don't know if we'll do this for the, for the tour or not, but I would come out on a, a toilet that's like rideable and I, every time I would get so scared that I was gonna fly off the stage on the toilet, We were all scared.


I was like, alright, Here we go. Everyone's on stage. Entrance was like different, like, I mean, not different. I guess Mav would pull a back flip and he'd, he'd skip out and like hit a back flip. Like think crazy. He, I'm trying to get a mini tramp into the budget, but I don't even the budget. The mini bucks. No, it's not. I want a Super Tramp. It's like 2K. What, what? What's up of Minit?

Billy Eish, the nf, let's both do it. Let it, no, they don't do a trampoline. They have the stage that goes.

And it's like, oh what? Yeah. So we could all be like inside little boxes and then just like jump out. Just, I mean that that's, that's, yeah. But that's crazy. Those are also about two to 4K each. I'll buy one. I Can, we all buy one each. Imagine somebody just didn't go up 'cause they weigh too much. Oh, that be The suspension of the car. What? Yeah, you wouldn't go up. You'd be like 3, 2, 1. I'm Not allowed. Everyone just goes up. Think about it just, and you're like, Harper just flies.


Just no Harper flies. And then one of us just goes, how cool would that be? Like everybody coming at different times? Like I think it'd be more cool if we all Say I We should on one live Show show. That'd be so high if you come up. Just We should have like zip lines from the balcony. Like pink down to the stage. Yeah, we should just all the Zipline onto the stage through. And if you guys come to the live show, I'll take my shirt off. No, no. Nobody wants To take care about that. No, I trust me, the audience does. I wanna do, I wanna like fly from the ceiling. So at the first live show, can we like fly from the ceiling? Probably not. It might be a safety hazard. I wanna fly from the ceiling though. I mean we don't really have, like Matt Said, if you wanna put it in the budget. I mean what about like, Do you wanna s slingshot backwards?


What if we could slingshot one of the crowd members backwards out into the crowd back? Yeah. What Is like, hey crowd member, come here. Just get inside this slingshot. Okay, thank you very much.
