Speaking of you getting hurt, I know this is like your biggest fear, Kate getting killed by somebody because you're like an influencer. Yes. Because an influencer, somebody just died. They got killed on their live stream. What? Yeah, it was pretty sad. She was live streaming to my knowledge.


She was just live streaming. And then this guy, crazy guy. I don't know if he like, knew who she was. I didn't, I obviously, like, I didn't search for the clip so I don know. No way. I know what you're talking about. It was in Mexico, right? Yeah. Yeah. Probably her name Ashley was talking to us about, yeah. Valerie. Val something. Valeria or Valeria? Valeria. I haven't seen this. It's happened like two or three times in Mexico. Yeah. Are you kidding me? Wait, what? Marquez? Yeah, she Was an influencer, but I, I think While she was livestreaming, She was like an Influencer in Mexico. I think this girl Lemme look it up. Something about like her boyfriend or she cheated on her boyfriend maybe, or there was cheating somewhere and her boyfriend shot her. Is that right Kate? Oh, I don't know. I don't Know. I'm sure. I don't really get, when that happens, like in like stories, like murder stories and stuff.


They're like, oh, this person cheated. So then they shot their spouse. I'm like, well you let me, you loved your spouse so much that you were upset. They cheated so you killed 'em. It never makes sense to me. That doesn't make sense. No. A 23-year-old Mexican influencer was shot dead while streaming on TikTok. Rumors began to swirl. Was it a cartel? Hit another tragic example of violence against women. What was it on Tuesday? Valerie Markia Marquez was shot dead at Blossom and Beauty lounge. A beauty salon owned by the victim in, I can't say that word. A town in central eastern Mexico, Mexico somewhere or something. I guess the state prosecutor said they're investigating the crime. We're working to catch those responsible. So the person's still out there.


That's so don't don't be live streaming. That's that's crazy. So sad. Imagine, just imagine. That's my biggest fear. And she owned the, the beauty salon? No. No, I don't think so. She had a hundred thousand followers on TikTok. Although it was unclear exactly what happened during her final live stream. Ms. Marquez says she was waiting for a care, a courier. She knew to deliver a gift. Oh my God. She added that. She was a bit worried because her friend could not see her courier's face when she arrived. What do, why didn't he just drop it off the gift? Where were they going to pick me up? Kidnap me or what? She wondered. She wondered and alluded to her followers while holding a pink stuffed animal. Ms. Marquez looked away from the camera, immediately grabbed her chest and belly before collapsing into her chest.


Oh my God. Did she get stabbed? No. She was shot. I believe. That's so sad. Imagine Being on that live stream and just like watching all that. Oh, That's traumatizing. Why do I have a lump in my throat? 'cause it's sad. That's so scary. Yeah. A lump In your throat. Yes. Anytime I think about death, I get a lump in my throat like that. What does that mean? Last night I was actually live talking about, about death. You choke for some reason. And, and I had a lump in my throat. I just, it's scares me so bad. Wait, What does a lump in your throat mean?

Harper, you should, if you like true crime, like if you're driving or something, you should listen to Crime Junkies. They're like the biggest true Crime process because you don't start your thing with that intro. I don't like that. I Won't I'll, but the first time I ever listen to Crime Junk, I was in the car. It was my first week of work at Efco and I, I was in the car with this like 60-year-old man. He has kids my age and we had this 6-year-old man 60 60. Oh, okay. And, and we had to drive nine hours there and back to a town. And so for 18 hours we listened to Crime Junkie. Oh. Oh my gosh. I thought you were gonna say like a crime happened with the 68 Man. 18, 18 hours of Crime Junkie. Why would you listen to crime? Why wouldn't you just like do something else Like play B?


Well, you know, I tried to read a book, but he liked to like sing and tap like Maverick does. And I was like, man, I cannot focus. And so then we talked for a little bit and then we were like Crime junkie. And he was like, yeah. And I was like, okay. So You know how we were talking about how Maverick makes weird noises all the time? I was trying to sleep on the car when we were on a road trip like two days ago. On the car? Huh? On the car? No, you meant in the car, in the door. Yes. That's What happened. Okay. My bad. I genuinely thought you were sleeping on the car because People pink for clarifying. Stupid. What? Anyways, I was sleeping inside the car, not in the engine. Kenzie in the normal part where people sleep, You said on, and it's not abnormal where people sleep on top of a car.


Okay. When I say I went, did you say it's not abnormal? I slept in bed. Yeah. Do you mean like you were in the mattress? No. Anyways, I slept on the normal part of the car and she said on and okay, whatever dude, I slept inside the normal part of the vehicle that was transporting me. And Maverick was driving and we had hours to drive and we start driving through this place and he tells me about how, you know, how Maverick is obsessed with animals. He was telling me about how elk live near here. And then as I'm trying to go to sleep, all I hear for the next 15 to 25 minutes is just this man in the driver's seat just going, Ooh, That is not true.


Not true. Had window down calling out to the elk like they were gonna hear As you driving While they drove by. I was like, bro, they ain't gonna hear that. The sad. Even if they do, I was gonna peek their head out. Like did, did. Oh yeah. Look at that truck go by. The sad thing is I Can see Mare doing that. No, he was, I don dunno if you, I don Dunno if I said this or not 'cause I really wanted to say it, but I don't know if I did. I remember. I don't, I don't know if now you gotta tell me this happened or not. Sorry. I was, I was half asleep. Yeah. But I remember being like, can you please stop? And then I went back to sleep. Did that happen? No. No. So we all collectively Need to just start telling him to stop because I think all the time like I need to tell him to stop. But I'm like, I don't want him because I Remember, remember as I'm falling asleep, I was like, there's no way he's making elk noises right now.


This is not real life man. First off was actually making elk noises. Yeah. And and elk literally goes like this. Ooh. Yeah, it did it back. What? So you can't be that mad 'cause it did it back. No, nothing. Did it back? No it did not. Yes it did. No it didn't. No it didn't. I was making female elk sounds I made that Can You, can you show us a female elk sound? Yeah. He goes That's what he was doing. That was the noise. Ew. That's what he was doing. I was like, sounds Like an anime character. I guess I was like, is someone watching anime right now? Dragon Ball Z. And then I looked up and it was just, Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew. I was like, what's that? And he's driving what's happening? Ew. Yeah. I thought he was like, thought he was pretending he was in Mario's car. He just, I Can wait.


I'm gonna play this and y'all tell me if I'm, if I'm close. 'cause I feel like I I are you about to have us rate your out call? Yep. Here we go. He's connected to his Alexa in his bedroom. That's So bad. It was Plain anime. Sounds Not, not that one. Not that one. It is more like a Why does that sound like a, a a a mum baby, a monkey. High stress dude.


Ma, I listen if I tell you, because I think I will just start telling you to stop making noises kindly. But don't take offense to it. Just know that it's just like, sometimes people just like peace and quiet. Why'd you shine that at me? I don't know. I mean, does he like make noises like that? Like while he is sleeping, is he ever like, like while he is asleep, what? No. Is he ever looking atella? He's like, rah, what the Fuck Trying to make call her. What Speaks English? She does. Guys, can I, Can I end the podcast? Like, like, like when we're done, like can I, 'cause I've never ended one. 'cause it's always like casual. Like, all right.

This be, how did we not think about this last episode? We met the, I don't even know if this story is gonna come off well to you guys. Yes. And that's the sad part because you guys will never be able to understand what we witnessed.


What Y'all meet. What did y'all meet It? What? I can't even begin to like try to pretend to be this guy. No, you can't. I actually we said that in the car. Yes. I was like, you know what's unfortunate about the, the man we just encountered? We're gonna try to explain this story to people And I don't even know how to act like him. They'll never get, I can't even impersonate him. Yeah. And long story short, here's what happened. Well first, first Abigail calls us or not calls us first. You, you gotta, no, this is background. This is the pre. Yeah, but this is like the, I know I was gonna give the pre background. Okay. Do you Remember when you got up? So a Kate for the pre background? Yeah. This isn't a pre background anyway. This is foreshadow. Okay. All all right. I see. So Abigail is trying to set up a thing so we can go. Who's Abigail?


That's say thank you. I was gonna say, I'm telling our assistant Abigail was trying to set up this location for us to shoot at. That's what I was gonna say. You set up the location first us to shoot you say trash, but go ahead. Abigail's trying to set up this location for us to shoot out that had a Ferris wheel. 'cause we wanted to shoot content there. And she gets off the phone with the guy and she's like, I don't know what just happened. Literally she was like, he said maybe some other time we were like, well did you get the, did you get the Ferris wheel or not? She's like, no, I don't. I don't think so. And I was like, Abigail, what happened? And she's like, he literally just said maybe some other time. And then I tried to schedule a time and he was like maybe some other time.


And she was like, I I, so I, I don't know what just I experienced and we thought she was crazy maybe Some other Time. Yeah. So then we drove, how far was it? Three hours. Three hours. We drove three hours to go to this, meet this man at this place because he has this little tavern and I don't even, it's like a, he calls it a trading post. And he literally a tiny coffee shop. A very, very, very, very, very tiny like Brex coffee shop place. And I think he also lives at the coffee shop. And in the back of the coffee shop area there is his Ferris wheel that was opened up like 70 years ago. We've gotta more details to this coffee shop, this co. Have you ever been in like your friend's garage? That's just like, you can't even walk through it. Yeah. You mean our garage?


That's the coffee shop. I'm not even kidding. No, it was, it would not even looking at the front of the building wouldn't even pass the health inspection. It's just junk and dirt and like, just like old like wanted signs for like, I don't know, like An antique Store kind of. Almost like an anti store. And keep in mind we were in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma nowhere population of like eight and he's one of 'em. And we go in, me and Matthew we're like, and we're with our friend Pap, we're like, pap you stay in here because you are wearing a wife beater with tattoos. So you look kind of scary. So we're gonna go in and ask him if we can go in his backyard and shoot his Ferris wheel. And the Ferris wheel is an old Ferris wheel, like 80 years old that is all overgrown in the trees and all this stuff.


So it's not like useful anymore. Like it's not a useful Ferris wheel. It's like he's letting it rot. So we were like, he probably won't mind, we just wanna shoot a video in front of it. So we go in there. Why they'll worry about that. Yeah. Because it didn't work out anyways. Yeah. And we go in there and we're like, Hey, what's up man? And he's like, looks at us like this. He doesn't even really doesn't even look at us. He's just like staring at nothing. You know when you walk into a restaurant and you wait for someone to say like, Hey would, would you like or are table or booth? You know what I mean? Like he just, He was probably shocked. He was like, no one ever walks in here. Who are these people? No, no one. It was him and an old lady in there and I think she like just like knew him and was friends with him. No one goes in this restaurant and he literally was just staring at his notepad. I Understand the problem.


What? It wasn't a restaurant or a coffee shop, you're just walking to these people's houses. No, and they're like, what the freak. Trust me. It was, yeah. Okay. And he's just staring at his notepad like this. And we kinda meab wait there for a good like 10 seconds of awkward silence. And then Mav finally starts convo. He's like, Hey man, so how you doing? And stuff. And he kind of gives us some convo back, just slightly. I mentioned on the way in, I saw that he had a sign that said Quana Parker house tours. And I read a book about Quana Parker and I was like, oh, Quana Parker's house is here. That's cool. I'll ask him about that and see if I Can like, like butter him up a little bit bit before asking him for the Ferris wheel. And we mention it and I'm just like, I saw the sign. Y'all do Quana Parker tours out there.


That's sick. I like, I love Qua Parker. I read a whole thing about it. He's like, I'm not doing tours for Quana Parker today is Quana Parker the Indian. Yes, I know him. Yeah. Really? He's like, he's like, I'm not doing tours Fora Parker. And I'm like, okay, well we don't want a tour for Kwana Parker. Actually we just wanted to talk want, we just wanna see your Ferris wheel and this man looks at us and goes, no. And we were like, that's it. We were like, no. Okay, but You can another, we drove, we, Hey man, we like, we said it just like this. Like we drove three hours from Dallas, like just for this. Like is there any way we could just get back there for like 10 minutes and take some videos of it? And he goes, no you didn't. You didn't drive from Dallas for this. If you did, you would've called first.


And we were like, well we did call first, but you didn't really get anyways. I was like, first off you had to drive three hours from anywhere to get here. Yeah. Because you are in the middle of nowhere. So we obviously drove and we're like, anyways, I understand that, but what if we pay you $400 for us to just go back here? It was all the cash we had and, and take some videos. That was all the money we had with us. Like, we will pay you $400 for you to just let us use your rotten Ferris wheel that nobody for 20 minutes even even cares about you. You're letting it go to rot. And he goes, I done told you no. And we're like, please man, please. And then he starts looking out the window and he sits down and he looks out the window and we're like, why not? And he's like, I'm just far too busy today.


And we're like, meaning books? We're like, what? And he's just looking out the window, the most impossible busyness thing you could do. I'm so unbusy. And he's just like, I couldn't even if I wanted to, I'm just so busy today. We're like, okay, is there any way we could do it, man, like anything is at this point you're being kind of annoying. Is there an amount of money? Oh no. We were being very annoying. We were like, like please, we dropped three hours. Please. I'm willing to give you $400. I I'd done told you no. And we go, okay, we know you said no, but there's always a way to work something out there. Did you ever say we have a YouTube channel? We told him about the YouTube and he called us Liars. Yes. We said we should have pulled up your phone. No, it didn't. Doesn't understand the I, We don't even know.


We said, Hey, we have a YouTube channel and I'm sure a lot of people would love to see your Ferris wheel and see the stuff. So like we'd love to like just post about it. And he's like, no, no. He said no. He said, no you don't. You don't want, you don't wanna show it online. That's right. You just wanna look at it yourself. We don't care about your Ferris wheel. We were like, duh. And then we were like, okay, well is there any way we could schedule a time with you? 'cause he says, I'm too busy. You'd have to schedule that. And we were like, okay, this is my favorite part. Okay, can we schedule another day to come up here? And he was like, well I work on the weekends and you work on the weekdays so it would never work. Oh my God. We're like, you don't even know if we have jobs.


And he's just like, so it would be impossible. And we were like, oh dude, please. She was like, yeah, this is my job. I said, well can I take your number and we can schedule today? And he reads off his number like 2, 7, 6, 5, 4 or whatever, reads it off real quick. And I was like, I did not even get that. So I didn't even wanna ask him again. I was just like, so self, we could be free for one day. So what day would work? And he was like, well now I'd have to even think about if I want to even do that. Oh My. This Whole, this whole time he is looking out the window like this with his back turned to us. It's like, you ever seen those movies when they're talking to like a scary figure and it's just the back of him and they're looking out the window like He's like a Vampire. That's what we were talking to. I was like, dude, can you turn around please? I was literally at some point I was like, whatcha hiding at the Ferris wheel?


Whatcha hiding back there? Yeah. And anyways be, he Should have just ran back there. I might have shot them or something. And I was like, okay. So we gave up, we walked out the door. I was like, last chance man, $400. We just need to go back there for 10 minutes. At this point he turns around and looks at us. Yeah. And he goes, I told you no. And we're like, Frick. And so we Go outside and we're like, well we drove up here three hours all for nothing. So Pap you might as you might as well go in and see if he'll say yes to you. Oh my God. Because we're not coming back. 'cause this guy's never gonna schedule it. No. So you might as well just see what happens. And also we were like, pap, we can't explain this man to anyone. How was, because you need to go experience it for yourself. And Pap goes in and about 30 seconds later he walks right back out.


He goes, there's no shot. We're getting in there. He goes, that man's mentally cracked. I told you the man is insane. Y'all Are what if he's probably literally is just like some, the old guy that's just No, he's like 50. He's not even, and here's how we know, here's how we know. It wasn't like I was picturing he Was like 80. No. And we know that. It wasn't like, oh, maybe his wife died that month. And so he's just like out of it or something. No, because this man has 80 reviews on the Quantum Parker tours for Quantum Parker's house. 80 of 'em and 80 of them are all one stars. And every single one says for no for 10 years. These reviews go back 10 years. And they all say, man came here to see Quana Parker's house.


And the guy said he was too busy. All of 'em. Oh my God. All of them all like eight reviews. Like quotations. He's busy. Yes. For 10 years. I'm You've been busy for 10 freaking years. Other ones are like, that's crazy. We, we figured out a way to to see it and, and then we went back there and like this was like a historic Comanche Indian house. Yeah. And apparently he's just let it go to like nothing. How Does he own This? And he must have inherited it. The Indians have literally tried to buy the house from him and apparently he won't. Whatever the issue is, he won't sell it or something. He's Too busy on. Yeah, He's too busy to show. I'm not kidding. Mr. Beast could've walked into this man and been like, we will give you $1 million to give us a sandwich.


And he'd be like, he'd go, I'm too busy. You just wanna see me eat a sandwich? No, you can. No, I'm far, I'm far too busy for that Ego. So high. Wow. And we were like, no freaking way. Wait, so is Quantum Parker, is this like the sh Quana Parker? Like a historic Yeah. I didn't know what that was. And Mav wrote up there and he goes, quantum Parker's house here. And I was like, what? What? And Mav, you know, knowing all the information he does, he was like little young Sheldon over there and he was like, yeah, Teddy Roosevelt in Quantum Parts actually met at this house once. And I was like, how do you know about this man? He brought a house in his backyard. I was like, it has stars on the roof. He's like, what? And he knew all about it. So apparently it's a famous house. I mean, Harper knew it. I know about it. Yeah. I learned all about it in school. Like the Comanche tribe.


The You're just saying that 'cause I said Comanche. No, I know. It's like the Kawa Kwa tribe. Ki Kiowa. Yeah. Kaywood. Yeah. Yeah. Kiowa tribe there. I learned about it in fourth grade and I will never forget. But yeah, no, he does crazy. Anyways, He owns his house, which Teddy Roosevelt met Adam and all this stuff, and he's just letting it fall apart in the woods. Take over it. And he won't let anyone preserve it. Wow. That's crazy. That's kind of sad. It's like a piece of history. It's Yeah, but if it's a historical like landmark or then he doesn't really have a choice, right? They have No, he owns it. He does. It's, he must have inherited it or something. I don't know. Did he know most Of the tribes or Indian tribes are actually like based out of, based out of Oklahoma? Yeah, Eventually they were.
