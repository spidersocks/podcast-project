It's the lineage pepper or it's the Lineage Candy. Cane Lip balm. And I got it because I peppermint like flavored B lip stuff. Did I say like stitch? Oh that, wait, wait. Matt does a good stitch impression ham. He had just like too much alone time at one point in his life or something. Like Who? Master Stitch Has bullying. Just instantaneous. Like anything else I'm good at. I think there's still heat between you two.

(2m 44s):
Heat for y'all that don't know the other day. Like literally like 48 hours ago. It Was yesterday. Okay. 24 hours ago. Mav and Kate got into a very heated argument actually. Actually it was not heated at All. That was the most, wasn't really heated. Shut up. Shut up. That was the most heated argument you guys have ever been in cash. That was not that Heated. It was one-sided heat. One-sided heat. That's kind of crazy. Like I Are you talking about in the living room? Yes. Yeah. No, I was not mad in the living room. It was just like later I was like, yes you Were. I was mad. I Mean, Marick was obviously the most mad you were, but you were calling me names and things. I didn't call you names. Let's not, let's not bring it back up. We bring Back up. No, Move on. What's next? What are we talking about today? No, We need to bring this out.

(3m 24s):
This is great guys. Trust me. I called mad, annoying and she got mad and many other names. But I was thinking about the annoying one. I just thought that was kind of crazy. 'cause like she's called me annoying probably a million times. They, they were arguing and it was, it was crazy. Kate was all like, ma, I just don't get why you think that? And he was like, I'm not talking to anyone in this room. No one and Kate. So what annoying and stupid and You can shut up. Like y'all. That's what it was, Was shaking his head. Yeah. That is not what happened. This conversation had been had three times and they wanted to bring it up again. And I was like, I'm not having This conversation. Okay. No, no, no. And I, and then, and then Tate, she's crying to me. She's like, why would he call me names? And then Matt was like, Hey, it was heated. I don't know why y'all are all blowing this off. Like this Didn't happen.

(4m 4s):
It was not that heated. Okay, well, what had happened was something was done during filming the day before and everyone on set agreed that it was kind of crazy. But AV didnt, not Mav didn't like that I had Said something. I just say all the time, Mav and Kate disagree on things about videos and what can be said and what can be this and what can be that y'all don't understand my hard life. And me, I'm, I'm like the moderator. Like I'm normally like the middle ground. Like I'm like, oh, this could be, you know, Are you speaking English? But yeah. What? But anyways, Matt and Kate are like both very opposite ends of the spectrum of like what can and can't be said or film or posted. And they argue a lot about that.

(4m 45s):
It's true. I have too much pride and Kate has too much fear and these two things don't, don't end well together. Yeah. Way. So recipe for disaster Either way. I brought it up again because everyone who had been there the day before was there again. And I wanted to get others' opinions, but he did not like that I'd brought it up again because we, either way. Yeah. You know, it doesn't really matter how the argument is suited. It ended up with name calling and tears and it was crazy. And then afterwards I was like, okay, I'm done. Okay, Marick, come here, Kate, come here. And I called in the same room together and I'm like, you guys need talk this out and apologize to each other. And Kenzie, for some reason, he was like, And Kenzie come here too.

(5m 25s):
Well I, We still married. Y'all have to do it together, you know, like, And I, you guys need to talk this out and apologize to each other. And it was literally like children. I was like, ma, why are you mad at Kate? Okay now Kate, are you mad at Matt? And then the classic woman thing and starts bringing up stuff from weeks ago. Actually it was kind of unfair, I'm not gonna lie. 'cause Kate's just sitting there like, you just crying. I Told you I didn't wanna do it while I was crying and Crying was no, no crying. I told you, I said, I'm, I don't wanna talk to anybody while I'm crying. And you were like, it needs to be done. And I was like, well why were you crying? Because I was upset Because he called her names. Oh, well, not just called her names. Wait, there was a whole argument. You know what I think is disgusting? Your husband hasn't tooken a shower. What the, and I Can pro prove to the you that because look, there's still paint on his leg.

(6m 10s):
I told him before too. I was like, Harper's gonna roast you. You need to go wash your legs. Because He did tell me that. But hey, to be fair, the paint that is still on my legs from like two or three days ago, Kate washed my leg. So she has to wash your legs. Kate washed my Kate. You're like, here. Kate washed the Leg. So it's Kate's fault because I was like, here Kate, you washed my leg and she washed my leg. I Didn't even know he still had paint on his leg. So I now for not responsible for a paint on my leg. Yes you are. You are what you want my washer? It's your leg. You're my washer. If I would've washed it, it would not be there. You can guarantee that. Yeah. Well It's disgusting. You're, Because I, I'm opening for a new washer, man. Anybody wanna be my new washer?

(6m 50s):
No, I don't wanna wash your leg. I got, oh my gosh. What? I still paint all my nails. So that's Yeah, you do you actually have more paint on you than anyone? I had the time. Okay. Well anyway, I Can sing now. Okay. We're, but yeah, the argument, I don know. I wish I I I should have videoed it. I'm videoing it next time. But this guys was the only argument they've ever had. Not true. And like, that's the whole time not even close to true. That's not true. You guys have never argued like that, ever. We have argued multiple times. No, not like that. I've, I've been standing in that same doorway having to apologize multiple times. It was such deja vu. No, I don't care what y'all say.

(7m 31s):
That was the only time y'all have ever argued like that. What, what else? When else have you been calling her? Stupid, annoying. She brought, why Did you call her stupid? I remember I may have called her stupid. I Listen guys, it was a bad moment. It was bad. It was a low moment for you. It was a low moment. You know, low moment. Kate said, she goes, and we are, by the way, we were talking about me at my worst here. Okay. Like this is like one of the worst things I've probably ever done. Okay. This was really bad. Kate told me really bad. She said, I just don't know why he called me stupid. Like you would never call Kinzie names. And I was like, well I might one day. I don't know. I We get really mad at each other. We might. No, the thing was they're stupid. Kate didn't specifically actually call me any names.

(8m 14s):
Kate would just say things like, that's the stupidest thing. You don't actually believe that that's the dumbest thing ever. If you believe that that's a lot different than calling someone. No, but it's implying it, it felt implied. I felt like a 50-year-old like mom that had like two like babies. And I was like, okay. So apologize for calling him stupid. I wasn't even upset. Apologize for calling her stupid and hug it out. You apologized for saying he's ignorant. Okay. All right. Now hug. I literally said that Harper. I said no, y'all should hug. Because it Was a conversation that I didn't want to happen right then and there. And it was good that it did wasn't it was, it was Maybe it would've been better later. Yeah, no, it would've made you feel better if I wasn't crying. That didn't really affect me.

(8m 55s):
Didn't care. Heartless. He couldn't look at me. Yeah. Time She sitting. I was like trying not to cry because I told, I said like five times, I don't wanna do what I'm crying. And Cassius words actually were. No, he needs to know that it actually emotionally affects you when he does that. I just wanted it to keep you over with. Whoa. That was what the, should we call your mom to come pick you up? Because that was crazy. That was crazy. That was real. Oh my goodness.

(9m 37s):
Lord. Reclip it. Recl. I was gonna call your mom, but my phone just died. Sorry. You're just gonna have to suffer now. If You guys didn't watch the last episode, Harper accidentally told her mom that her fart sprayed everywhere. It'll be the last episode. Oh yeah. That's not the last episode. But a long time ago now. Sorry, we filmed it a while ago. What are you doing? Making sure you don't get covid or something. I thought it just broke. Wait, what are you doing? Okay, Harvard, next time you fart, you gotta be at least that far away from Me.

(10m 19s):
All right. I'm Sure another one will come up in the episode. Okay. You must be 100 inches away. She just stayed so chill too. Didn't move at all. I feel like it's only socially acceptable for her to do it though. Like if mayor or Kinzie were a fart like that, she would like what's going on? Can y'all please with that? Yeah. Next time You guys have a fart. Can y'all please do it? I've never, I've never heard kinzie fart before. Have you ma? Nope. Really? Never happened. Never heard it. No way. Yeah, she refuses. That's Ka. I'm serious. Do Poop in front Of her yet? No. What? Yeah, she won't. She told me before the honeymoon, she was like, what happens if I have to go to the bathroom? Wait. Oh, we shoulda talked about that in the honeymoon episode. We had two bathrooms. That was the best part of the entire honeymoon.

(10m 59s):
That Tough, that was your highlight. Two completely separate bathrooms with showers and everything. It was crazy. That was your highlight. That's like, was that y'all did have to be near. Wow. So it was so convenient. Yeah, Because she was like worried about it before. She's like, what if I have to go to the bathroom with the honeymoon and like Make poop noises? Yeah, that's the one. No one can watch me poop. I will not allow it when I'm pooping. It is me and that's it. Me and my poop. Okay, so what if Kate just needs to be in the, in the same room? No, you can wait like you understand like she's not just gonna sit there and be like, watch you.

Okay, so cash and I have black tile on the floor in our bathroom Floor and I dunno where this is going. Not true. And toilet paper, as we all know, is white for the most part. No, not the most. For the Most part. Everybody's White. Mine is always white. He's just white. So for the most part, I need know if you're telling the truth right now. Yes. I stand up when I wipe. Yeah, he does. It's on the wall. It's on the floor.

(15m 9s):
No, it's not on the wall. But every time I go in there I never understood it. I was like, what? There's like little like little like shavings of toilet paper on the floor And I was, that is not from that. Don't let her get in your head. That's all that's from. Yeah, that's not me.

Like he toilet paper shaving thing just going everywhere They were are in those tiny little things goes Yes. Like the little like shavings are on the floor. And I never understood why I thought that the roll just like flug 'em off All. Yeah, that doesn't happen in my restroom. Are You lying? No, I'm not lying. But I But that makes zero sense what you're saying.

(15m 50s):
I think it's highly more common than you would think. Well Don't stand up and wipe your butt in my bathroom. My phone's dead. Someone Google, how many percentage of people stand up? Yeah, I'll google that stand myself. I don, I'm Actually scared to far in front of boys. You just did. No You're not, not in front of them but like She cares though. She just caught us women math. Yeah, she just called us like, like you know if you're doesn't care about I you just don't want my boyfriend, I would be too scared to fart or poop.

Wait, wait, wait. They just not what? B 65.7 and six Oh and 34. Wait, I've wanting a bidet. That would make sense. 60. You should wait. You should it. It depends on America. Okay.

I don't really know. Yes, they probably do. But why does it matter? You think like if British people sit that makes 'em or stand that makes 'em less? Yeah. Like why does it matter? No, because they just have different habits in different countries. Like in, I think it's India.

(18m 4s):
They're only allowed to wipe with their either, I think it's their right hand. So they always shake with their left hand. They eat with their left hand. That's Like honestly more. More. Right.
