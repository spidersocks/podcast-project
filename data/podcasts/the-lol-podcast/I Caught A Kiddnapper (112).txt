Yeah. Okay. The movie, movie made about us. No, this is literal movies will be made about us. It will be. And we're driving down the highway and all of a sudden this guy in front, it's like just that little highway that you would expect. It's like hardly you would never expect this. Not many people on it. And this truck just goes, and then he just goes, goes side to side and starts like hitting the gas, going left. Right. Breaking hard. It's a miracle the truck didn't flip. Yeah. It like Wait, like a semi-truck? No, Like a, like a pickup. Single cab pickup. Oh, okay.

And so he pulls the guy like finally pulls over on the right side of the road and we pull over on the left and this girl's trying to wave us down in the passenger seat. No, she's like sobbing, crying. And she's trying to wave us down. And when I say pull over, I mean tire, middle of the highway. Tires screech smoke everywhere. Yeah. The guy's like, eh, smoke in the tire. And we have it on video. We do have it on video. Oh. Keep telling the story though. Okay. That's crazy. And Then we're like, we sit there for like two seconds, we're like, oh shoot. Well we pull over. That's what I'm saying. And yeah. Yeah. Well when we pulled over, we kind of pulled over in front of him on the other side of the road and we're like looking at him and we're like, is this guy about to like, throw some shape, like throw some bullets, like what's about to happen?


We were scared a little bit, but we're like, oh yeah, but we can see the girl. And she's like crying for help. And so we're like, what are we gonna do? And then the guy I think looks at us and he we're coming back from Colorado and he sees a giant elk head on the back of the truck and he was like, Nope. He just, he floored back on the highway way. Yeah. We just have elk antlers out the back of our stuff and he just takes off. He's Like, they definitely have ammunition. And they were, they were like, follow him. And so me and Matt and my dad were all following around the highway. We called the cops on him and he's swerving a little bit of stuff. And then he finally starts acting normal and we keep following him. Well he does it a couple more times. He like pulls over to the side of the road like smoking tires, like all this. Oh my God. And she's like, yeah, probably crying for two more times. And like when we're, we're like parked parked, is she getting Kidnapped?


Well just wait. Don't man, just wait. Just wait. Don't tell yet. And we call the cops and they're like, okay, yeah, we're gonna get highway patrol out there. Whatever. Right. We drive for 30 miles following this truck. Wow. And no, no. OHP showed up. No. What did you call It? Oh, that's Oklahoma Highway Patrol OP Which is where we were. Oh yeah, we were. Oh, okay. But yeah, we're driving down the highway for 30 miles. They never show up. I call 'em back. They're like, oh yeah, yeah, we already have that in the, the system, so they're still gonna get out there. And I was like, okay, that's good. You know, don't rush. She's dying, but it's fine. She could be dead now. Yeah. Don't rush. And then we finally get into this small, super small town that has like, literally like two gas stations and that's it.


Yeah. And I call, I called 9 1 1 again. Well, he pulls over for gas and I get their police department and I'm like, Hey, we're at this gas station. Literally why? I'm on the phone with him. Like, wait, Does he notice that you guys are there? Yeah, he knows we're following him. But when we pull into the gas station, he first pulls up like he's gonna go in the store and we're like looking at him like, and my dad rolls down the window. He's like, do you need help? Like y'all at the lady. And the lady starts to try to like open her door and he like throws it in reverse and then, and then like pulls quickly like skirts through the gas station up to the, the pump.

During his music video guys, I Actually Saying, saying that reminds me of, so today, yesterday I got back from New York and when I'm in New York, the people that are don't like me.


What? First some strange reason Kate, If I went with you, they would love you. Just like you Know how New York is you, you special. Huh? You Know how New York is? Like if you're in anyone's way, like they, Let me tell you why New York does not like you. Why? I think you offend New York a little bit. Why you're so she walks around with one hand out and one hand with germ X. Like everywhere she goes, she's like, somebody brushed my shoulder, whole body, Somebody's hand. She's like, oh, it's so good to meet you Along with her. I love New York. She, I'm very, I'm not that dramatic, but I like Texas. You're not that dramatic. Okay. She made me hold on to the like subway railing and then she just clung to my body so that she wouldn't have to hold onto the railing case.


To be fair, all of us did that. Laney just took one for The team was just taken, Laney was just part of the subway and we were holding on the Laney. That's exactly what people behind. I was like this and I got Kate on this side and Brooke on the other and they're just like Junk here holding me. It's Like of people, you know what? I don't do it for the thanks, but If that train made an abrupt stop, mys arms are just not gonna hold up Man. Y show is the weakest one too. I slowly feel like you're getting darker as the episode goes on. And she Is. It's developing. My face is getting dark. Dark. Her hand is developing. I'm sorry. Why does New York not like you? Oh, So for many reasons, if you guys go watch my New York vlog, I've vlogged the whole week and it was really fun. But at some point in the vlog, I'm just trying to give you a little update.


I'm like, we're going to the store now and the crosswalk, I was walking across the crosswalk and I completely eat it on the video. You'll see it. Y'all Can't walk straight. No, I bet I fell. Walking is easy. Oh it was. It was the day you were gone. Oh, I didn't see that. I like face planted on the crosswalk and everyone like side eyed me. Nice. Like you're on your stomach on the ground. Yeah. I like fell over and everyone just walked around me and like gave me dirty looks. You know what I on The ground in the street and I literal In New York. I kind of wanna be that. What's his name, dude, that like pulls social experiments on people and like I, yes. I wanna pretend to like pass out on the street. Are you talking about see if anybody actually stops to help me if we talked to Oh yeah. Are you talking?


No, It's that It's an actual social Experiment. It's a show that's like, what would you do or something. Yeah. Oh's. Like she passes out on the street in New York. Like do you think anybody in New York would help you? I Think there's a very slum chance's. Any of you guys in New York? Actually A phone right Now. Now that I say that one time something did actually happen to me and somebody stopped and helped me. Oh, what happened? Wait, what guys we're having like two different conversations. Huh? Actually I probably can't talk about that Really. Bye unless we talk about this. Okay. Sorry. Oh, Sorry. She said take a phone call. Daddy needs help. You could be an unsung hero. Yeah. That's crazy. She said she just got a phone call. She said I need help. She said bye. Barbara will not be the unsung hero I actually have. And then an unsung healer hero for myself. For yourself?


Yourself. I have. That's Just, I don Own yourself. You saved yourself. So wait, We've all gotten hit by a car before, right? Well Naturally. No. I Almost hit someone with my car. What hit? Yeah, that's What I was saying is today I I Have a hard time believing you've only almost hit one person. No, like, like I've been to New York. I trip on the crosswalk. Everyone spits on me as they walk by. Like treat me like a dog there. And today I'm driving in Dallas and I almost hit a man on the crosswalk in my car and he laughs at me. That's just the southern friendliness. That's So true. What it must be like to be a pretty girl driving a car. Because if you were driving that car I did. I did that once. I backed out of a parking spot and I kind of bumped the guy.


He sure Did. And I bumped him a little bit with the back end of my car. No, he didn't hit The guy cash Backed out. He it, he was trying to get an insurance claim. He sure was. He He went bam. Not he hit the top of my car with his hand. I was like, I saw that I didn't hit you. You hit me. You Didn't hit him that hard. No, you did hit Him. The guy, I think the guy like over dramaticized it. 'cause it was like cash touched him and then the guy went, Yeah, that happens. Are You guys trying to kill me on every episode? I We sometimes, but the good news is the board jerky still hanging out. I like that. None of us flinch besides Lainey who're all so used to that. Well, Why do you think I have fight or flight over here?
