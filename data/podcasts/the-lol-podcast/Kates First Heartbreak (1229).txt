We're upstairs, like in the, in this room getting stuff together and Pap walks over to the bedroom door to go ask Matt a question and he hears that Matt's in the shower and then he hears Matt talking and Matt was like, pap was like, Matt's going on and on about his wind and smash right now. That was crazy. We all heard that Matt was in the shower talking to Kenzie about how good he is at Smash Bros. No, no, no, no. That's not all I I When when y'all done Playing sometimes, sorry. When y'all are done playing at two in the morning, then he walks in and I'm wide awake. 'cause all I hear for five hours while I playing here and I Got champ on my head, you're Like, bro, you're an bro, you're an idiot. And You can fight him Because you already played him.


And then he comes in at two in the morning and then he has to sit there and talk about where's my belt? How he won or how he lost to cash. Yeah. Don't You check my belt? That's my belt. I like myself talking. No, I was listening. Thank you. I'll talk to you. Yeah, I'm listening. He has my belt. So when he finishes going on for 30 minutes about y'all's game that I had to stay up till two in the morning for. Then he sits there and listens to Joe Rogan or Joe Blow, whoever the heck else he listens to. And then we don't go to bed. Bobby Jack Smith. Bobby Jack Smith. And then we go, don't go to bed till three in the morning. Are you too fast? Wake up the next morning and continues to tell me about his smash. Bros. Are you the current champion? I'm always the current champion, Stacey.


False news. Mom. Listen, I We need A piece of paper right now. What do you mean? I need a piece of paper. Somebody. Anybody. Paper. Why? I'm gonna make a contract For contract on the pod. I don't Think your contract we're signing any sort of contract right now. Yes. You're we're not trying To be legally bind to anything. Hey, if someone else Can sign on our behalf, we can sign on your Behalf. No, either A, the games move to PA's room or B, that's doable there. There's three options here. B, the games move to Alex's room Not doable. Or C, the game's moved to the living room. No, That's also doable. No, that's, that Are too many Options. Alex paints her room. I like where we're at, honestly.


Yeah, that's a great know. Y y'all unfortunately you do have you, you do have to move. That's like extremely unfair that Kinzie has solicited online. Unfair. When is life fair unfair? I mean she gets die on the cross. Is that fair? No. You guys, the the like the the bare minimum would be moving into PA's room That is the bare, bare bottom of the barrel. The least You can do. What we Look at it this way when we play right here, Kenzie gets to be closer to the champion every single night, which is me. So it's not every night when Mal goes in and debriefs the game. Kenzie's probably like, man y'all so I married the wrong brother y'all because cash is an eight time champ y'all. And my husband is only a four time champ. I do hear that when She talks to me at night. We always talk about how cash is like always the better One.


But that's False news. Fake news. I'm always the champ and I will always be the champ. She kinzie's a lot nicer. Your wife's being quiet because she knows you're only half as good as me. No, because she has videos of me coming in there with champ on my head. Yeah. Four times. I have eight of them. You have those when I'm not around, they don't count. I have nine when he's not around. You can't hold a champ. You lying Cares. But I will say Kinzie, you are a much better woman than me because I would be flipping my head every night if I was being kept up. Like I would just start raging. They would all be like, What's Kate's Problem? She's such a rage woman. You're just being dirty. My problem is, you guys you's what? I would say A brown. I'm gonna record you later and I'll just put it outside the door. Get out. Yeah. You guys have to move to a different broom.


Unfortunately. Can't Do it. Never could, never will. Well Mike can maybe PAs room. That's the only one. Take the TV off again. Oh, even the TV off. I know what the problem is. Ain't got no water on it. No, no That work. It's unfortunate. Maybe we can buy another tv. You guys think we can do that? Watch this video so we can afford another one. Oh, y'all should do some things so we can make some extra revenue. You should subscribe to our channel. That brings us no revenue. Yeah, it doesn't really, but maybe you'll watch more of our videos than I We get a diamond plaque maybe. Yeah, we could get a diamond plaque.

You definitely seem older, but Guess what grade I'm in. Ninth. No, 10th. Yep. Oh Wow. That is great. It does not look like you're, y'all look like the same grade y'all. Wait, who's taller? Oh yeah. Let's see. Oh my goodness. Let's take a look. Oh, lookie. Oh, she's stepping on. Oh, she might have her who? Wait Harper stayed up. Street Harper might have Harper Zillmer. Yeah. So no, that can be right. Yeah. This couch is soaking wet here. Sorry about that one. Actually no, that was Matt's fault. Yeah. No. Who's fault?


She's sprayed me first. Everyone saw, Did you see how mad I was? My Hair bad. Sorry. How long? Oh, you're good. His legs are compared to Their, you were, you were, you were down bad. You were trying to get a boyfriend down. So tremendously bad. And then I, I'm assuming this kid was also down tremendously bad. Aw. So that's why he chose me. Yeah. So anyways, I remember like his friend had said like, oh, he thinks you're pretty. And I was like, wow, I've never heard those words before. And so I was like, I need to get married to him. Like, that's my husband. He thinks I'm pretty, dang, This is a sad story, Kate. So In sixth Grade it gets, it gets worse. Yeah. So anyways, we start dating in like Jan, February. I wrote it in my diary. I remember we started dating in February and we maybe in the whole two months that we were dating, spoke like 10 words to each other.


Face to face. We texted every day. But like if we passed each other in the hallway, we wouldn't talk. We wouldn't look at each other. Like, I don't know. So You guys were like secret, like Romeo and Juliet Type lovers. Everybody knew we were dating. Oh, Everybody Knew it. So like, Did you say goodnight to him? Yeah, we texted. Did you say I love you, you see? Yeah, yeah, Yeah. I think so. See, we think The same thing. Yeah. We're we're we're twins. Yeah. Yeah, we were twin. So I was like, you know, obviously texting him all the time, but we didn't talk in person and yeah, I, I remember always being upset that he would never come up and talk to me, but like, I wouldn't talk to him either. So, you know, It's scary to talk to a guy in Person. Know. So then anyways, it, it goes on and on. And this is like side, little side thing that shattered my heart.


His best friend. This was really sad actually. The guy I was dating told his best friend that he thought I was the most beautiful girl in the world. And his best friend responded, if you ever say that again, I'm gonna slap you across the face because she's so ugly. Wait, how did you Find that out? No. 'cause His best friend said that to my best friend and my best friend told me that. Oh no. And I was like, My god. Oh my God. So you must have been crushed. Who Was your best friend? Were you crying Hailey? It was a different girl. I bet she was. Well That girl needs to, no, it was, it was Friends. How are you not still crying? I don have a love question. No, I actually, if I thought about it hard enough, I think I could cry right now about it. Like, it's really sad. Don't know why anybody would say that. 10, 11-year-old girl. But that sucks besides the point. So What if somebody said to you, if you, what if somebody like you were dating a guy and you were like, and then they were like, their friend was like, Hey, like, don't ever go up to that girl.


She's ugly. What would you do? Yeah, that's exactly what I be so, oh yeah, yeah. It was so mean. So so the end. So the guy like that says that, and I'm like, okay. Like that's really sad, but it's fine. At least my boyfriend thinks I'm pretty, Man, this is a sad story that's so bad for you. You've never made me feel bad for you. Like you always play the victim, but I never buy it. But this is like, Yeah, I was really sad. Everybody's just like, and so then I'm like, okay, he does, that guy doesn't think I'm pretty, but like my boyfriend thinks I'm pretty. And then Little 6-year-old Kate or whatever you said sixth grade. Sixth grade. You must have been just, Oh, and then a week later it's, we're having like our little passing period and I'm walking to my next class and my boyfriend, who I've spoken to maybe three times in person after two months comes up to me and he has like three or four of his bros behind him.


Oh. He got the squat, he got the, like he squat to break up with you. He pulled up on me. He was like, they're gonna back me up. Listen, listen. He pulls up on me in the hallway with like his bros behind him and I'm like walking and he comes up to me and I'm like, oh my gosh, he's speaking to me like he doesn't do this mean character. And I'm like, I'm like, this is my chance. Like what if he gives me a hug or something? Like what if, and instead of that, no, he goes, I'm breaking up with you. No, No. In front of everybody.

So Then there's no way this story gets worse. Yeah, It gets worse. So he breaks up with me and instead of just being like, oh, okay, I'm so in shock and I'm so embarrassed that it happened in front of everybody. I immediately start sobbing and I, it was like early in the day I sobbed for the entire rest of the day. I cried in every single class. Everybody was like, what is wrong with her? Like my art teacher or like my theater teacher or someone pulled me outta class and was like, like, are you okay? Like, is something going on at home? Like my face was swollen all day.

And I remember, I will never forget this kid. I will never ever forget you. I'm not gonna Well you're crying voices coming. Are you about to cry? Yeah. This is giving you what if you tell the art teacher this? I had a boyfriend that he said 10 words too and he broke up with me. No, I, I don't even remember what I told her. I was like, no. Like I'm fine. Wait, wait, wait. Continue what you were saying, it was about to get good. Yeah. Yeah. I I'm not gonna say your name, but I rem I will always remember this kid. 'cause this was like the nicest thing. He was like, he saw me crying all day. I had like multiple classes with this kid and he, I had like kind of been friends with him, but like, not really. And he was like, what happened? And I just told him and he was like, well you just, you really do deserve someone a lot better than that.


Like, you don't deserve that Kate. She should dated him. I, I had the fattest crush on him after that. I was like, please, I bet. I was like, please come marry me. Like be my husband.

But that would be that like, if there was a story you, I Just keep So is that the whole story or is there more? I mean, yeah, that was pretty much it.


And well, to top it all off actually. Oh gosh, I forgot about this, but I just remembered. Does it get worse? It gets worse. Oh my. So the same day that we break up, I'm like, I've cried all day at school and finally it's time to go home. So I walk outside and I'm standing with my friend and it was like, it was really hot this day. I don't even know what was happening. But I walk out and I'm like irritated and I'm like, why is it so hot? Like what the frick? And I said, Frick, that does Just top it All off and no, no, no, it's hot outside And a teacher hears it. What the frick, she hear me say, what the frick? And she goes, I like said it pretty loud. She goes, Uhuh, excuse me, what is your name?


And I was like, Kate Baker. I was like, oh wait, Kate Marie. I was like, Caitlin Wentworth. That was my name at the time. Wentworth, I, yeah, Wentworth. I was like Kate. And I told her and she was like, who's your, who's your homeroom teacher? And I told her and she was like, I'm gonna tell her that you said that. And on Monday morning she's going to get the message and she's going to call your parents and tell your parents that you swore on school campus. And I'm like, brother, like I can't, like I got too much going on right now. Like, no. And so instead of just being like, okay, yeah, I, who does this? Okay, you get in trouble. And she said, your teacher's gonna call your parents on Monday. I said, I have my phone right here. Would you just like to call them now?


And I hand her my phone and she calls my mother, the teacher calls my mom off of my phone. I have a story like that. And I, and she's like, I'm out here with your daughter after school. And she just, she just said this and it's just outta control. It's outta control. And I was like, I was like, oh, okay. Wait, was this like an old teacher?

That's, that's not a bad word. No. And then like my parents didn't know I had this boyfriend so they take my phone and the same day we broke up, all of this is happening. Oh no. They take my phone and they go through it and they see that I've been texting this guy. Oh. And I like, I love him and he's my boyfriend and oh gosh.


And then they pull me into the room and they're like, Kate, who is this kid? And I was like, it's just a rumor at school. Everybody made up that we were dating. Like I never, I've never had a boyfriend before. And yeah, so I'm like heartbroken lying to my parents. That's not a good alibi when they have the text messages. No, that is a horrible day.
