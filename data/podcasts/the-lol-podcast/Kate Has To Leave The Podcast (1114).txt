Alright guys, I'm not gonna lie, we only have like nine minutes or so left.


Mm. Okay. So everybody I say we start like this. Everyone go around and say why they should be. Stay on for the rest of the episode. Wait, I'm gonna officially set a timer for eight minutes. Here go. Okay. There's supposed to be 10 minutes each time, but, alright. Everybody say why we should not vote you off. Maverick. Go. Go. Okay. First off, we all know I'm not winning this. Okay. I'm getting voted off, so I am willing to team up with someone to at least try to make it to further round. Team. Team. Wait Us three. Oh, what? Yeah. Oh, I see. I saw hands going with everyone. With all of y'all. My thing is two, I just like to not be the first one out and so I will gladly team up with anybody. Okay, go ahead. Your, your turn. Oh, I've been on this podcast for longer than I Can say.


Super. Almost longer than you've been alive. Almost longer than I've been alive. What about cash? Like mid episode, you're opening up a lunch league. It's Harper's speech right now It's my, it's my speech. Say you're getting getting voted off first for that. What The Show. A little bit of respect to the other players. Alright, well anyways, I think I shouldn't be voted off because I personally was, you know, I was the Do you have a reason? No, I don't. Which can't think straight because you're over there crunching and I don't think I should be voted off because I have a really good, I know exactly Who's going first. Yeah, same. This is really annoying. What?


Like, you're just like, Alright, You can plead your case now you I could Even distracting everybody. Hey, hey, if you did get voted off, I would carry on your legacy, if you know what I'm saying. I figured. But That's disgusting. You won. You won't get voted off just because I'm eating food. I need to survive. Hello? A survivor. Cash. It's your turn. Plead your case. Okay. My case is all y'all ate before me? I haven't ate today. I haven't either. Yeah. You want lunch Lee? No. Oh, that's why I'm eating. Okay. Everybody else gotta eat food today. I haven't gotta eat. Sounds like a personal problem. I ate in between episodes, so like you could have done the same.


Oh, and y'all should keep me on the episode because If we kick you off You can go eat. Ooh, it's tempting, but no, I don't really know why I should be here, but I feel like I should be Kate, your turn. Mm. I'm kind of like in the same situation as Mav. I'm like, I'm probably, I don't think I'm gonna win this. Oh my God, y'all stop being picked me. She tried to play a victim, Kenzie K and all said, I know I'm not gonna win, but you know. Oh my God. No, no. They're trying to steal my card. I played the card first. Okay, So you admit you were just using it as a manipulation tactic To get through the first round.


Yes, exactly. But again, I mean, in all seriousness, we all know I'm not winning. Listen, Okay. You want a real reason? I feel like I'm the brains of this show. Oh, you Should. Any route besides that? I feel like, I feel like I kind of Last, there's a couple episodes ago you were saying PS stands for Please stop The brain of the episode, you said? Yeah. Really brain. You're a brain act. I just am at a higher intellectual level than most. Okay. I'm owning. Really? No, you're just making fun of us. You're just calling this all stupid. All stupid. Wow. Thanks. Thanks for insulting our intelligence. Wait. No, I was kidding. I just feel like I'm a good, I I literally, I take it back like, look, I'm giving y'all good laughs right now.


Like I contribute a lot. You Do? Okay, Kenzie, why should we not vote you off? Well, because I feel like, and I know I'll get voted off first. Oh my God. But No, here, here's the reason. I shouldn't, it's because that will actually probably make me very sad. Listen, Then it'll just confirm the thoughts in my head that oh, if anybody had to go, it would probably be Kenzie. Wow. Also, that was convincing. Convincing. If we let you stay, then it's almost like we're letting the, the sheep stay and trying to get the lion out first. Is that, how does that make you feel? What, why did you worry?


As in I'm not a threat so I Can stay. Hey, get, get the prize. I'm not saying that you said that. No. Okay. Well that is not my tactic. My tactic is simply that my feelings will be hurt. So please don't hurt my feelings. I'll be pretty hurt too. Wow, we got three and a half minutes left. Tuck decisions all around. Alright, I don everybody who say you're thinking the boat. Matthew, you start. No, fast. Fast. Everybody say a name. Okay. Ready? Kate. Kate, Kate. Oh no. Now I don't even know why I said that. Hey, I feel like I just had to keep it going. Me too. Oh, oh, Kate, you have three minutes. Go ahead and change my mind. Change to Kenzie. My, I switched, I switched my thing to Kenzie. What she what? She didn't even, okay, I got you babe.


Kate, change my mind. Well see, I think there is no changing Maverick's mind because I think, I think we all know that like Marick. Wait, Kate, who are you thinking? You just gotta say it. Hey Kate. Kenzie. It's okay. No, Wait, shut up Gabe. Just say your name. Ka. What the Oh, I switched to names. I couldn't, you Better not ever say My name. Wait, wait. I, We talked about this. I switched my back to Gabe. Kate should get off the episode. Hey, hey, hey. I'm with you. And by the way, Kate, I wait. Did you say you're voting for cash? No. Oh, okay. 'cause I thought you were gonna vote for me because I broke one of your bowls this morning or whatever that thing is. Oh, I heard that actually. Yeah. Thought, what the hell? Did you Hear me try to stand up for your vacuum cleaner?


What the No, but I heard something shatter and I heard my little witty beety ty tiny vacuum cleaner being used. And I was like, It's fine. I stood up for it. KI promise. Well what Bowl was it? Was it just in one of the White bowls? No, it was like, we're up on a rabbit here away. It doesn't like something You would've stored sugar minutes. Guys, the ball doesn't matter. Kenzie, who are you voting right now? We're distracting the two minutes. Wait, shouldn't it be anonymous or It'll it'll be, it'll be anonymous. We might all be lying on who we're voting. Yeah, It's like white and it has little black painting on it. And it was by the forks. Are you still describing the bowl? It was like the spare forks he Was trying to get for, Hey, yo, they just whispered. What? Hey, We're not whispering Maverick. We talked about this. I'm Pretty salty about my bowl.


Kenzie, since she is found out about this, it's tried to be like, Maverick, please. You can't, like I, We have to be, you can't vote me, right? You, yeah, she tried to make me pinky promise downstairs. She's been playing games this whole day. No Cas is playing games with me and so I just pinky promised him. So you better not take that. Wow.

OO podcast. That's a good reason. Remember how you said is a good reason, a good reason You said that before. Yeah, I did. And now it's biting me in the butt. Yeah. So anyways, I, I don't think I should be voted off because I, you know, I come up with most of the thumbnail ideas. You do. I do. Yeah. It's True's true. I work my butt off every day. All true. And I, I don't know, it's just this whole podcast surrounds around the queen bee. It does. Okay. I don't think you understand the point of the game You're supposed to make us like you Anyways and all that said, all of y'all are so pretty except for them. But yeah, just a vote. Did You not see the last person who took Thera that said, I'm smarter than all you guys.


And now do y eight minutes? No, we'll just do it at the end here. No, I set a timer. Eight minutes right Now. Okay. So now, yeah, just don't vote me off. I just don't think it'ss Smarter. Okay. Y'all should have voted me off because I'm the guy reading the names And me And you. So we should probably stay. Just, you know, 'cause we're the name readers and also symmetrically. You know, me and Harper are the closest to like the middle of the by the TV I just threw over. Yeah. But you know, we're just the closest to the tv. So like, think about it. If it was Mav And Kenzie left, they're just like so spread out. Yeah. You should scoot in. You should take Kate's seat is a sin. No, take her seat. She's gone. Wow. I'm sorry. Kenzie. Kenzie really just took your seat like that. I'm sorry. So yeah, that's why I think, oh, I should, I should stay in and I feel like I should stay in because it's cold up here and I'm, I wore the proper clothing and you guys didn't, so you guys probably wanna, I, I didn't hear a single reason to vote.


Vote not vote. You not to you. Honestly. No. Wow. Kenzie. It's my turn to plead my case. Yeah. Okay. Well I'll start with Maverick. Mm. We talked about this. So you don't want me to vote You so you're, you're not gonna vote me. I Can watch the cameras back and I'll be sad. Hmm. Wait. And we talked about this. Wait, what's happened? So I can't vote for you? No, you can't. What did y'all talk to everyone else though? Huh? What about everybody else? They gonna vote For you? Oh yeah. I'm gonna make the rounds, but I just wanted to stare you in the eyes and let you know, okay? Okay, Okay. Okay. Wait, what did y'all talk About? It's just not anyone's business. What? It's actually everyone's business right Now. And, and cash. We had it packed. Yeah.


Our, my piggy is still standing. Okay. So, And, and Harper, you provide so much value to this podcast and it would not be as funny without you. Okay. So who would you vote for Then? Therefore, I Whoa. Stop. I'm blaming everyone. Kenzie. Yeah. We need to hear who you'd vote for. So I'm, I'm not gonna vote for Harper, so therefore you shouldn't vote for me. So, so You're voting for me. That's not the point of this. The point is, The point is, we wanna know who you're voting for and why. Well, The point is I just cannot disclose that information because, Okay. My pinky is still standing. I don't see your pinky standing. My pinky is not standing in his car because, Okay, not pinky. We did a pinky promise, but you're my husband so I'm not gonna vote for you. So you're voting for, so who are you voting for yourself?


I cannot say it out loud. You have to say, so you're a liar then who? You. Why? Alright ma. But ma, why should we not vote for you? Well, first of off, I want everyone to know that if I ever told anyone I wouldn't vote for them. I'm a liar, Maverick. And I might, will. Wow. Okay. That is crazy. I Can vote for y'all. That is crazy. So right now, y'all better really give me good reasons not to vote for you. Everything that had been Said, I don't think You can vote for me because we are the blue couch.

Yes. Not quick. And I didn't even vote any of the girls. Really? Nope. Wow. We did that by ourselves. For all of us would be staying. Hey guys, we have some good teamwork this far. Yeah. One of us is gonna go though. And On the live show I'll d you up. Okay. You better d me up with a live show. Man.


I don't even know. Like if we should, I don dunno what to say. This is, I don't even honestly know if we should really talk about who we're voting. 'cause we all already know, don't we? Yeah. We have to know, right? Yeah. That's, But you already know who you're voting. Yeah. Who are you voting? Harper. You say who you're voting and you say who? I'm voting on three. Currently no one. We both know who we're voting. Okay. 1, 2, 3. Harper. Oops. I Can, I need cash. Yeah. You really think that I'm gonna, you really think that I'm gonna, I'm trying to, oh No, I'm totally down to vote cash with you. Let's break up the whole plan. We can do, listen. You ever know if I lying? You dunno if I'm mine. Harper. Think about it. I'm voting cash. I'm voting cash.


They're never gonna see it coming. It's a Great stretch. Why does it like we could do this ourselves. You're right. Why Does he get, why does he get a win? Why does he have to do that? Why does he get a win? But I don't, I don't. He doesn't deserve it. You're right. You're right. You. I deserve. But also, Yeah. Yeah. Also, Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That that. What did y'all say? Nothing. Nothing. This supposed to be a group conversation, guys. No, nothing. Group combos. I don't know who to choose then because it's either, it's either us three. Okay. I say we all vote ourselves. Let's just all vote ourselves. Really? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's do that. All Right, let's do that. I don't think we even need 10 minutes. Let's just go ahead. Listen, The cake gets me so end.


My heart's kind of racing. Yeah. I didn't think I'd make it this far, honestly. Me neither. Me neither. For some reason I thought everyone was gonna look at me and be too scared. I'd fart or something and all vote me off. But here I am. I am very happy with our decisions to vote off so far. I mean, Kate, you gotta be quiet here on the episode. To be honest, I didn't really even have to think about our decisions to vote off so far. It's brutal now. Now it's actually getting tough, you know? Well, we just voted off our wives. Like, get outta here, man. The last thing about the mo, what the most funniest podcast would be. It's these three, right? No, no, no. Without. Hey, we're the core hosts, right? Yeah. Except for one person without Somebody. Hmm. What would it be like?


You know, it doesn't matter guys. We don't need to hurt anybody's feelings here. So I Don't think we should vote me off. 'cause we should have two genders on the podcast. Oh, I'm not a gender. What? My beard does not grow Ginger. Oh my gosh. Well, we should have at least a boy and a girl on the podcast. So it, it equals out for our audience. Listen To stay you way. I agree. We don't mav what I had to say. Either way. I didn't mean to say that. It just came out. Wow. I would never, I'm totally down blue couch for life. The fans would be so happy to see Blue Couch win. Exactly. Yeah. Right. We have to win. Yeah. And Then whatever happens, happens. Yeah. No, You'll have to see Whatever happens after that happens. But yeah. But to see blue couch stand well Would be, everybody will really happy.


Awesome. Hashtag blue couch must fall. No, everybody loves the blue couch. It's like, kind of like an unwritten destiny. What are you doing? Blue couch is fine guys. Yeah. Not with you over here. Not the blue couch will stand. Yeah. Not with you. You Know what I'm saying? Nope. So who you gotta vote off the blue couch? Yeah. 'cause I mean, after all, it is a sofa. Three people fit here. Yeah. I don know about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's go get the chair and the stool or whatever. Okay. But who you voting Myself? She said that last time. She's the liar. She's not gonna do that. Wait, wait. Guys on the low. Who did we all vote last time? Oh, I totally voted. Kenzie. Me too. Did you vote?


She voted me and she voted Harper. I can't believe that. Yeah, I thought, listen, listen. I Can't believe that you voted you last time. Yeah. This time we switch that up. Okay. All right. And And even if the plan doesn't, Have you voted me every time? No, I think she has. I think Harper wants the blue couch to fall. So I'm not gonna be on it. What the, well, The thing is maybe not this time because I had to not vote with the girls because I have a such a good friendship with them, you know? So I can't do that. Right? Yeah. So now stool table. Do you wanna vote right now? Yeah, I'm ready. I still feel like I could like go either way. I know. Same.


You guys are both so good people. You know, I don't wanna do this to either of you. Yo. Everybody in the comments, do me a favor. Go follow us on Spotify. We're trying to become the number one podcast in the world on Spotify. Yeah. We became number one in the UK and like some other countries. For real? Yeah. Yeah. So you guys should go follow us on Spotify and give us a five star rating. We're trying to number one so's follow us'. See we're now on Spotify. We're dropping down to like number 15 or something. Yeah, it's Really bad, but No, but I saw yesterday. Also comment down below who you think's gonna win right now. Oh, that's what I was gonna say. Oh, we're going down Everyone. Ooh, everyone comment. What list you would vote off. Comment down below and what order you'd vote everyone off and comment who you think is gonna win. Yeah, because I'm feeling pretty good.


Okay. Shall We vote? Yeah, I'm feeling great. All right. Yeah, let's Vote. Okay, listen, here's what we need to be thinking about right now. After this round. Yeah. The losers vote. So whoever you vote off is about to vote against you. You get what I'm saying? So who do you think you have a better chance running against cash or running against me? Wait, describe it better because I, We didn't explain that. Okay. So after this round, there's two people left. Obviously they can't vote for each other. So all the losers are gonna come back and vote on who they think should win. Okay. Now if you think I've made all the losers more mad, then that means it's an easy win for you. If it's just me, you left. Yeah. But if you think they're all gonna vote for cash to win, then you should probably vote 'em off. Right now I think all the women are voting for my app to lose.


So that's a good reason for Me to stay. Either way. Either way. If I vote For, that's a good reason for me to stay. If I vote for cash, You wouldn't wanna vote me off, then The plan will still work with you. Even if I vote for cash. Oh, Of course. Yeah. Listen, everything is fine. I just think I would need to stay because if it's you and Harper Cash, you know they're probably gonna vote for Harper. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Listen, they're gonna vote Harper to win. The girls are voting Harper. I guess I'll go first. You might be right. Yes. Wait, hold up. No, Harper, he might be right. If we don't vote you out, the girls are gonna come in and vote you to win.


No. Yeah, because you voted for me every time and we voted them off. Y'all Can't vote me off. Yeah, but then the girls are gonna vote you to win. No they're not. Yes they are. I a No they're not. Look At 'em over there. They, they, they know they're gonna vote you to win. No, I'm voting for Maverick. She's a liar. I voted her. She has no, she's not voting for me. My point, I'm voting you all. Kenzie said she's voting for Maverick. Yeah, she's gonna vote me to lose. Okay, well I guess we'll just have to see where it goes. Ah, I don't like the game. Okay, We'll just have to see where it goes. I, We Got all, we gotta vote. Somebody step up and vote. Okay. I, I'll do it All. You got it Harper. Wow. Alright. Wow. Looking at all the past falling names.


Man. Wait. Blue. So sad Blue. I guess you can't look. Yeah. Blue. We bow harbor. Stop whispering. What? I think so. I dunno. Yeah, we're gonna go Harper There. Go ahead and write. You're good. We're just playing telephone. No drama over here. We're gonna go Harper For sure. Who are you voting? I didn't argue. Vote. Who are you voting for? Harper. You look suspicious over there. Harper. Harper. Who you voted for determines if you win right now. You know that.


I'm gonna show the girls first. This is so scary. Stop. Can you see it Open a little more? Yeah, you're good. Oh my gosh, I don't like this game. Okay, wait. Okay. Alright. Mav, you go. Who'd you vote for are Man, go off to see. Is it me or Mav? Just tell me if it was me or not. That's all I need to know. Oh Man, you guys were great to play against. What the you? It was fun.


It was fun to play this game. What the shig ma But He's gonna write my name in all, all caps. Matt takes 10 years to write a name. This is crazy. Yeah, no, he's writing my name Like I, and I know it hasn't been very long yet, but I remember last time he wrote a name. It took forever. So maybe I'll wanna skip four in 30 seconds. Oh my gosh. Marick, come on. He's writing my name. How Do you know? Not I'm not. How do you know? Because it took longer. Cassius four letters. Harper's six letters. I Threw something. Okay, can you see it? Yeah. Okay. Oh, I wish these papers would bleed through so I Can just see it to the person I just voted.


I am so sorry. But that was honestly my only option. What? Oh, it wasn't, Why was that so cinematic? Man? I feel like you're in a movie. Alright, Your turn. I'm gonna go vote someone. Guys, the brothers are like, I've known you since you were born And I've known you since I made you relevant. I taught you how to pee standing up. Okay, so Harper's still not pleading the game. I don't think she knows how to play the game still. Hmm. Okay, I'm gonna say something into the mic.


So, for everyone in the audience, there's only one reason I Can vote this. And it's, I'm playing the game for myself, not for them. So there is a very, very, very valid reason of why I'm going to hurt this person. And I'm gonna explain it to you. If I vote Maverick, We can hear you. If I vote Maverick off, the girls are gonna gonna Vote Harper to He's horrible. Whisper her. Yeah, He's terrible. What In, Okay, everybody quiet. I'm gonna always, if I vote Maverick, what? Oh my. If I vote ma off, the girls are gonna come in here and they're gonna vote Harper to win because that's just what they're gonna do.


And, but, but if I vote Harper off now, then I think the girls dislike Maverick right now more than they dislike me. So therefore I win. So you're gonna vote me? Yeah, because I think the girls like you better. So unfortunately, because of your favoritism, you must go Shut up. Don't even No, no. Don't even write the age. Don't write the age. Don't write Dr. Don't write. Please. Please. It must be done. Is it mad For my own good? Did he just vote me? He just voted me, didn't he? I saw the camera turned to me. Did you?


The camera did turn right to Maverick. That was kind of Crazy. But also we're on the same couch, so it might've turned to me though. No, see, it's Megan. Me. Okay. Have you voted me? That was suicide. Y'all want me just read the names? Yeah, just read. Actually no, let Kenzie come read 'em. Yeah, all Kinzie. Come read the names. Kate's coming back just for fun. It looks Kate even didn't even call you in here. I hope they all say Maverick. What? The what? See, that's the type of energy. Why? I'm not gonna win, but I Can get a salt. Second place. Kate's even micing up. It's just like old times. Yeah.


Throw Back. Are you ready? Yay. Yay. Aw man. Matt, I Didn't, that really Fucks for you. I don't know why Harper voted for you. Did you vote me? Kay? No, I didn't vote you. Wow. I would never, wow. Are you ready? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. No. Hop. Oh. Oh. Next vote. Is it? Oh my goodness. It'll be Maverick. Okay, Let's so intense. Oh my goodness. Who is it gonna be? It's not me. That's the good news, right? Kizzy.


Can I say who I want it to be? Cass, you know who it is. What do you mean? Oh, I do. Yeah. Oh, one of y'all gone. Bye. You know we voted for probably each other. Probably not you. That's true, Harper. Oh, Hold on. I just have to, I just have to I'm gonna Go. Just take a second. I'm just, just breathe you. You can breathe Harper. Who Wrote this though? Because it's actually decent handwriting. That'd be me probably. Lemme see. It's good handwriting. Oh, that's me with the angry face. I'm just Gonna, I You wrote that? Yeah. That does not look like your handwriting. You should write. Wow. Gotta switch it up sometimes. You know, I'm just, I I'm, I'm gonna go. All right Harper, there's nothing You can say that would make them just know that the audience is gonna be mad and that's all that matters.


If Kasha Maverick are happy, who gives a crap? All that matters is that you guys are mad that this is happening right now. Bye bye. Of You. You? Yeah. This is sexist. Yeah, but y'all gotta go off. He's been an evil villain this whole time. No I haven't. No. Hey. Okay. Hey Harper. There's no need to rage Harper. Harper. There's no need to rage. You played a really good game. Thanks. And it was a pleasure to play with you. Okay, so they're not stay on so you No, now we'll vote him off. Me and cash are gonna step off for a second for y'all To talk about who y'all are gonna vote. Talk. Okay? Yeah, that's fair. Okay. You guys, you guys all talk about You can, You wanna step back? There's no need to rage sharper. Okay. One of y'all can go sit on the blue Coucher here if y'all want. I'll move this mic.


Alright you guys. I like blue couch, Cy. I know, I like it too. Sling house. So actually I feel really left out. Come. Hey. Hey. The awkward silent. Oops guys. I think I already know who I'm gonna vote out. Who? Me too. I'm probably gonna vote out Maverick. He's so rude. Well, What I, I Can get behind that. I think that when he starts to get a little bit competitive, he starts to just like naturally be, excuse me.


Oh, there's a flight of stairs right here. I'm just gonna, oh, Oh God. Hey, Pick him up, Kate. Okay. Okay. Anyways. Hey, what's up? I'm back. So anyways, I Can agree that I do think that when Maverick starts to get a little bit competitive, he starts being extremely rude, which is a very big red flag. When cash gets competitive, he just gets loud. It's a red flag. But I think being mean is a little bit more of a red flag than just being loud, you know? So I Can back that. Who are you going for? I'll also be voting for Maverick because that rude husband of mine voted for me.


Well, you never, I honestly, there's two things. There's two different things between them. Cash is super loud and Maverick gets super mad. Yeah. So y'all will have to see who I vote. I don't know. And I also, I'm gonna expose myself a little bit. I did, I think in the first round, you know, the only round I was here for, I think everyone assumed that I voted for Maverick because, you know, Mave and I got a little bit of tension between us at all times. And I Can honestly wholeheartedly say I did not vote for Maverick. I voted for cash because, you know, I, I wanted to start off on a good foot and that backfired for me. So it is long overdue. What is Maverick doing For my boat to be placed?


So I think we all know who I'm going for I think also just to back up all those claims, depending on who we let shoot us with that, whatever that thing is called fire extinguish, that cash might go a little crazy. Ooh, okay. That's something that you need to keep in mind when voting. You're right. Yeah. And your hair, you know, but you're actually, so right. If we let Maverick shoot it, then you're gonna be hearing about it for the next three weeks. Yeah. Yeah. So all You gotta pick, do you wanna get super messy right now? But he won't care To talk about it after? 'cause he doesn't hyper fixate on one scenario. Or do you want it to be maybe not as bad, but he's gonna let you know about it every day for at least A month.


Oh yeah. I won the survivor game. Oh yeah. I'm the best on the podcast. Yeah. Like, I don't know. I, I just can't believe we got voted off. I think there's Pros and cons to each of them and I think we really just have to like go with your gut. I'm not sure there are pros. Can we help you? Sorry, what are you doing? Ah, you guys just going to see if you guys are gonna vote me. Get off. Go. Oh, you almost broke the couch cash. This Is not helping your case. Yeah, this is making you seem really annoying.


Okay. Sorry guys. Yeah, I think that there are things to think about, like situations like that Or him just being annoying. Yeah. Like I think they both have a level of annoyingness that we just don't appreciate. So I think it comes down to who is the most annoying? Who has been the most annoying and who will continue to be the most annoying after this? It could be both. I think both is a good, fair option. Yeah. But I think we also know what needs to be done. So let's, are y'all ready to vote? Yeah, I'm ready to vote. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. We Didn't really call y'all back in here. Oh. Oh, we're here. Okay. Please. Okay.


You dropped a green card Over by the pen. You dropped. Alright guys, this is going to be 10 And tennis. No, wait. Hey Kate. It's not athletic. Oh, no, no, no. That's good. No, just let him sit there so they have the microphone. Okay. Yeah. What the, you weren't sitting here. Yeah. I thought we were gonna sit together. Absolutely not. You are the enemy right now. Well guys, this is gonna be very intense and you might've thought I Can, we're about to be intense, but No, I said it's gonna be intense. Are we gonna show them before or should we not? Should we just like read 'em out after? Yeah. Don't show us. No, no, no, no, no.


Like show Like, like normal. Oh, do you like Normal? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't look at the things Matt. Who do you think is going out? You can see back. I think, I think me, I was pretty villainous this whole episode. Yeah. I, I don't think people like you man. I think there's a very low chance They Say it unless somebody just decides to, to be crazy. I don if somebody just decides to throw everything off, I'm down. I feel like they don't like you this episode, but I feel like overall they just don't like me. 'cause it's like I get called annoying a lot, but just know no matter what the plan could still happen with me, I could be the best. Is this like, whoever's the ultimate LOL member, one of us is about to be the ultimate one of us'. About to be the champion. The champion the king of the podcast. Some might would say the best.


The best, the best ever. I'm still to exist not only the number one podcast in the uk, but the number one podcast host in the uk. Yes. I mean, okay guys, come on. Oh, get it over with. So drama man. I Can see that y'all are trying to like take, I've never peeked in my life. I would never trying take a pee. I would never cheat, never, ever cheat over here. Y'all are a little bit of peekers. I would never cheat. That's, listen, I didn't wanna be the bad guy. I was this Episode. Well you are. Yeah. Well guys, I I don Dunno what you did to Kenji. Man. This Is hard. She's not happy.

And you turned your back. Not the game of life. Listen, partnership. I think when you're looking at who played the best game today, I played the best game. No, because I should have made it. I think time will tell I should be rewarded for playing the best game. Okay. Either way. Are y'all ready to hear the final? Do y'all look back and you're like, man, I wish I could've played like Maverick. Can the winner get a lunch Lee? Sure. I'd like that. Okay. Are you guys ready? Oh my God, yes. Wait, wait.
