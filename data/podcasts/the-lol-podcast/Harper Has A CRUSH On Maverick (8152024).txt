And then to top it all off, he tries to make a joke. He said, what do you see? Not a joke. Everyone says, everyone's like, oh, I feel so bad for cash. He was just trying to ask a question the other day. Cash. And I talked about it. I said, the look on your face told me everything that he's trying to distract.

And that's why I was so frustrated. 'cause he had been interrupting her for like two minutes. I mean, it's The podcast. He had been interrupting her for like two minutes and then he starts asking dumb questions when she's trying to be serious. I was so fed up with it. That's why I told him to stop talking.

The only time I Pee is if I'm in a public bathroom and like it smells. It doesn't have to smell. I'm just gonna hold my breath. Oh yeah. I don't know why I just hold my breath.

You actually can't say what she kind of looks like. No. I mean, I think you would say it, but she won't let me say it. No. Is it just rude or something? No, it's just not something texting To me. Mav? No. What? Okay. What Kate? It's Just not something that needs to be said. Is it? Is it rude? It's not being said. It's being texted. Okay. Is it rude? It's Not mean. It's just like we don't need to say stuff like that.


Like, I'm very confused. What? Because I I I thought it was Even those things you say that like most people wouldn't find, like get their feelings hurt Funny. Most people wouldn't get their feelings hurt funny. Like a basketball or something. Like funny. There's, there's things that You can say that people won't get. Their feelings hurt too. But there are people who would get their feelings severely hurt and we're Not gonna hurt people's feelings like that, that I'll say. I'll just say this. He said that You look like all now we Okay. You might have to bleep some of those things. All of it and her face. That was crazy. I'm sorry. I should have All right, welcome back. We might had a little cut. Theret. She's so dumb. I, when Maverick texted me the thing, I kind of said it. Yeah. And we had to cut it. Yeah. And I'm sorry sweetheart.


Kate, do you forgive me? I'm just so tired of everyone ignoring me like I'm some idiot who doesn't know what she's talking about. You are just a blonde headed bimbo. I was just, that was mean. No, it's from that movie. You, you're just a stupid blonde-headed bimbo. What Movie are you talking about? I don know you guys. None of that movie. I think, is it White Chicks? I don't know. That's a No. It's a movie. Blonde Nose. I have a question. It's TikTok Audio. What goes toro's mine? When the guest comes on and they cuss. That's ever happened? No. Who cussed? I can't say it. No one cussed.


I know one girl did. I don't think so. If One girl did, you Might know who she's talking about. I know who she's talking about. One or two. One of the 2 0 2. Yeah. You Probably had to bleep it. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh, they're whispering the people right now. You know what I don I'm not good at cap guys. I don't really like having guests on What the heck is Said. I love all of you that came on. I said it like, I don't know why, but when a guest on it just feels so interviewing. No, it doesn't. When Grace was here. Yeah, that was crazy. Because our friend, if it's a, if it's a guest, like somebody like we actually know like Harley, like a sister, like a friend or something. But when it's just some random person that we've never met, like another person that came to be a guest on our podcast, it just feels so much like an interview and it doesn't feel like, it doesn't feel like our podcast.


Hey, comment me down below what guests we should have on. Oh, great. Okay. Donald Trump. Donald Donald Trump Was on Logan's podcast. Yes. I If we could get him on You're wearing an ear bandage. Okay. You know what, you know what Mav said about that? Hi guys. Mav said he saw that too, that Donald Trump was on Logan's podcast calls. Yes. You're ruining it. What? Oh, sorry. What? I was just fiddling. It's fine. Wait, can I have it? It still functions. Yeah, it's fine. I'm sorry. Oh my gosh. No. It's just like the packaging was all nice and now it's all bent over here. I start over here. No. Anyways, Mav saw Donald Trump went on Logan Paul's podcast and mad legitimately, like yesterday told me, he was like, I think there's a shot we get Donald Trump on our podcast.


Because I was like, Mav, what? Donald Trump is not coming on our podcast. Why not? There's a chance. And he still thinks that Donald Trump would come, come on our he needs to connect with the young voters. You know, they're not even vote Lowkey could young female voters. We had a lot of females in our audience. I, I didn't, I didn't see that. Whats it called? It's like 60% female, 50% there. I didn't, I I didn't see that. Like, like Logan Paul's podcast and whoever is else on that podcast, I know him. I know his face. I just don't know his name. But I like, I don't see him on Spotify charts, so. Oh, haven't seen you. Can't see you so high. Can't see you. That is true. Logan Paul's, we do rank higher than him on Spotify podcast charts. So make sure you guys go follow us on Spotify.


Trump episode would be huge. Don't follow us on Spotify. Rank us huge. Donald Trump. Huge. If Donald Trump came on our podcast or any president, can Jon un trump Putin? Oh my Gosh. I don't give a crap who it is. If we have a president on our podcast, I'd freak out. Like I would be sitting next to them. I'd be like, can you give me a tax benefit? They would be sat in the middle like, oh my gosh. Yeah. Where have we sat there? Like you can't, you can't put a, a world, what if we got Obama? We are United Nation. You can't put a world leader. Obama would be crazy in between M and Harper. Yeah. We would just do something. Maybe they can have their own chair. They need this. They need that. If Putin comes on our podcast, Kim Jong o Trump Biden, they need that A throne.


A you know, Biden did drop out of the election. Yeah, I saw that. So maybe he'll come on a podcast. Yeah. Maybe He's Why are you following politics? Yeah, you follow politics? No, I actually, I don't follow politics. My, my family. Okay, cut that. Cut that. And we're back. Oh my goodness. And we're back. Just all of the talk of that person. This episode. Yeah, well just all the talk of that person that we just talked about. You can't do that. Oh, Well you can't do the last One. What do you mean? Oh, listen, I'm down though. From now on, I'm down. We just talk and then we can cut things if we need to. Because if it's, if you think it might not be good, but what if it is True? It could be good. No, Because Maverick would say so many things that you cut. Well, I guess I just said something that needed to cut, but it was only because you texted it to me and you needed something cut the other day.


He's been doing it a lot recently. Y'all haven't noticed Who gets cut the most though? Probably cash. What? No. Definitely you have. It's probably mad that Harper, Harper is, Harper gets cut the most cake. She takes the entire cake cut up the most. Obviously I've seen TikTok actually never had to cut Kate. No. Cut up in TikTok. She gets cut up in tiktoks because people, because they just cut her up yelling at us. There was one video Verbally abusing, you Know. Oh. That made the cut. Get cut. Oh wait guys, can y'all make an edit of me right now? Wait. Yeah. Like a, like a, like a What y'all doing? Flowy hair. What is that? Wait, get the, What is that? I don't know. I Look guys.

You know, like when, when they have TikTok edits of you looking like this and it's like all lies on me. I'm a center of the ring. You can just like circus, you know those and it's all like in slow motion effects on it all lies on me. Center the ring. Like what? You know what I do? I'm resigning my, nevermind my brothership.
