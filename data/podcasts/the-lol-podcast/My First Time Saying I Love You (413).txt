I assumed. Yeah, sure. I've never been to that bathroom before. But then it was the other bathroom. It was the guest bedroom. Not that one bathroom. It was bathroom. Yeah, sure. And I was like, Kate normally does my makeup bad. No offense, not my makeup. I'm, she normally covers my, she Does it often. No, And I talk, I do this like three times a year for like a video or something or like a photo shoot. And I cover like a tiny pimple that I'm, that I may or may not have at the time. Why are you so embarrassed? Because listen, that's crazy. I didn't know hide in the bathroom. I thought there'd be good lighting. 'cause normally when she does it, I'm like, Kate, this doesn't look natural at all. And so I was like, she needs good lighting in the bathroom so she doesn't make me look stupid. That's crazy. Yeah. Because every time I'm like, does that look good to you? And you're like, yeah, it looks Great. I see. I don't know.

Anytime you graduated early, what do you think of genius. Can you spell graduating Super scientist? That's me. They just gave up. They said he's not gonna college. He doesn't need anything. What he's ignoring. I'm saving you from spelling, graduating. You're welcome. I wanna hear him say it. Students. I rather get cash. Can you tell us the months of the year? Okay. In Order. Let me tell you something. A spelling bee, practicing a spelling bee or the months of the year does not decide someone's iq.


Okay. What decides someone's IQ is like their intelligence and like, I feel like More things besides, I feel like everybody over the age of 10 should be able to state the months of the year in order. Yes. And you know I have issues doing that because I, I am dyslexic yo yo too. And that I mix things up all the time too. I Go to tutoring. So yes, I go to tutoring and I mixed. I mixed j and g up a lot. Did you miss what J and g do you spell? Jesus? Like GES? He didn't do that once. He did. I'm not gonna lie, he did. That's actually map. Favorite story we said said okay, spelled Jesus. He goes G we go. Oh gosh.

Treat yourself to fat shack. Dang. Alright. DoorDash, you're down bad over There. It's okay. Cash has like concealer on, so, Okay. Okay. Ma, I have a question. So when, when you found this Christmas gift that you had bought me but never gave me, instead of just being like, oh, I'll give it to her now. You just threw it away. Yeah. You kind of did the hard part. I think I just gave it to Kinzie. What He He put it in a drawer with all the other stuff that he put in drawers. This man just throws Like gift cards. Wow. So can I get my Christmas present?


Credit cards? Like, It's insane. I don't know if that is. Starbucks cards are still there. Kenzie, You use my Christmas present. He bought me a Christmas present. And you, you said no, but it's mine now. It was a year and a half later. That's crazy. Also, I'm kind of confused why you didn't even give it to her Year You guys met. It would've been two months before. Yeah, I feel like that's give it Well Because buying is the hard part. Didn't take them until we were married. What? Wait, what? That's even worse.

Well, you know, Kenzie, I'm gonna hope that it's a lie. But that is true. That is so not true. No, I'm actually serious. That's true. Uhoh, that shouldn't have been said on a podcast. Why would you say that? Actually? Because It's true. Are you being serious? When did you say you loved her first? And why would you lie? I'm serious.

What was It? How'd it go? I love you. Like He said, I love you. Yeah. Well obviously you know that. But Actually, actually, I said, I love you first. Oh, Oh.


And, and then, And then he like basically told me not to say that. And then he told me he, He said, don't you say that ever again. Oh my God. And then she started crying and I felt bad and I said, I love you. I did. I just start crying and then I said I had to say, I love you. Wow. I, I think this story actually is true now. No, it's not true. It's true. It's very true. No, sorry, Wait. You actually started crying. Yes. I'm gonna start crying again. Why would you say that? Cry. Don't cry. It's in the past. We're married. I love you. I love you. It's fine. Everything's Fine. Wait, why'd you tell her to not say that? Oh don't, it was too soon.


Just how soon was it? What'd you tell him this? Like on the first date? No. Oh my gosh. Don't act. You're such a liar. April Fool's True. It's actually April 1st today. Yeah. So how did to get one in there? Okay. Whatever. Wait you, Are you crying? Are you really crying? I'm making her cry. Wow. I did good. No, That's horrible. That's like a fundamental abuse to make her cry. This Kate that's called April Fools. Yeah. This is my favorite holiday. Don't take It away from me. I made both my friends cry today for April Fools. 'cause I said I was moving to LA for a year And a You got me so good actually with that. Well yeah, I was at the Chick-fil-A drive through and I was like, oh no. And you were like five snaps deep. Like you were like playing it. And I was like, Kenzie don't cry.


I'm fine. I'm recovering. Oh God. I can't believe you just lied to the entire world like that. Like It's April Fool's Day. What Fools is my favorite natural holiday. It my favorite holiday. It's Same. I love it fool. Love it more than anything. So That's Horrible. Anything Not funny. Didn't last more than anything. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Yeah. Yeah. But you know there was still something that I would like to hit on. Yeah. Outta that story. Yeah. Why'd you tell to never say that again? I'll be honest, I don't remember any part of that story. Don't say that again. I was very happy when you didn't ask me. Okay, well Kenzie, why did he say that? Oh, we had had a serious, well first he had asked me when do I think is an appropriate time to say I love you.


I'm assuming 'cause he didn't have the courage to just say it. Is that so deep or is that, is it really that deep or? Actually I, I think it is. I mean it is pretty deep. Yeah, it's pretty deep. So how'd it go? He had asked me probably like a day or two before. When is like the appropriate time to be able to say I love you? Because he didn't have the courage to say, I love you. I think what A stupid question to phrase it that way. You asked that. No. Wait, what a girl thing to say. No, she phrased that so bad. Dude, you, you're so did you have your makeup on while you said it too, man? Maybe did app time to say that. Wouldn't matter the appropriate time to say that. I love you. Hey buddy, you are wearing makeup. Oh, good thing. Good thing I got my Starbucks gift card with me.


I have an fume. I mean, No, I don't remember exactly how he said it, but we had a conversation like that. He was Definitely like, and so when's the time to say that I love you? Well that sounds asinine and I definitely didn't say it that way. What's, nobody knows what that means. What? Oh my gosh. How many times we gotta tell you stop using words above seven letters. No one knows what they mean. Seven and under that is under asinine. There's no way asinine under seven letters. That is a IDD acid. You gotta spell acid first.


That's a You spell acid wrong As Well. A acid. A SI. Oh, a CAC acid. A CID. Yeah. That's how you spell acid, right? Why is no one telling me? Right? Yes. That's how you spell acid. Okay, but I didn't say acid well as like a SED Asinine seven letters. Asin nine a C is no a s Yes as A-S-I-N-I-N-E-N-I-N. So A-S-I-N-I-N Is that the whole word? No, EE. Yeah. That's seven letters. Seven letters. Yeah.


Okay. So did I say seven and under or did I say under seven? You said seven letters. I don't know. But if you can't do a seven letter word, that's a pro. Okay. Well no one else could either. So. Alright, so I think we should all really stop interrupting Kenzie now and let her tell your little girly story. Gotten like that. Zoe have that conversation and then a few days go by and then we had another really deep conversation. Wait. Whoa, whoa. You're saying everything too fast. I can't soak it all in. Ask you Two. Ask Donnie for me. SI Someone give him the Definition. That's my new favorite word. So Mav came to you? Yeah. Do you want the definition? No. Should we just let him use it? Yeah, we should, we should just not use the definition of the word. Okay. So you mav what happened? I just need to know the story.


So we had to Story to say that. And then a couple days later we were having a different conversation that was really personal. Like what, what, what he said. What did y'all say in it? It Can't tell you it was personal. No. Aw. And then about an hour after that conversation I told Mav I love him. And he was like, don't Do not tell me that. Just 'cause I told you there was some personal stuff about me. And don't, don't say that. Oh wow. She really changing the vernacular right now. Vern. Dude, what? It's preposterous the way you formed it. Oh my God. And did you cry when he said that?


Yes. Wow. Do not say you love me, please. That that's Me. No. So wait then. Who said I love you after that? When was the first time after that? Ma. Oh then, then Does It was a, was a lie. We would, when we said, when I said a statement, it was a lie. Yeah. We'd like to hear from Kinzie. Oh. Then I explained to him how I Can say I love you whenever I want to say I love you. And You said that I some sort of those words and that I was not saying that just because of our one conversation. And then he was like, Oh, okay, fun. I love you. Wait, then you followed up. I love you. Something. I don't know. You told her not to say it. Then like seconds later You said it back. It was a, it was like an hour and a half long conversation.


Okay. That's still not very long. An hour and a half later you told her you love her. Oh fun. I love You then. I'm not saying I Told you what I said. He, he already knew he loved me two days before. It just took him two days for courage. How long were you guys into dating when you said this? I don't know. I Yes you did. I love you a month. Oh, no idea. I actually, I really, I don't remember. I feel Like you have to Wait. Do you remember Cash? And I were saying I love you before we were dating. 'cause we had been talking so much. I, We were talking when we was 12. That was like my, okay, so when did you say that was my go-to? Oh wait, cash. Wait, when did you say And you meant it what? Probably I meant it pretty good on the wedding day. Okay. That's pretty good. Real good day.


Okay. Yeah. I love you Harper. Have you ever said I love you On accident? Yeah. I mean, I've been like, all right, bye. Love you. See You in the morning. No. Have you ever told a guy you love him? Yes. I accidentally told my like ex I was like, we were on call or like in the car or something. And I was like, all right, night, night. Love you. See you in the morning. And I say that to my mom every single night. I'm like, all right, night, night love you see in the morning. And I gave her two, Did did you give him that? No. Whoa. No, no, no. I kissed her on the cheek. 'cause we made it up in Minnesota and we, she, she's right, this is my mom. So I go night, night, let me see in The morning. Oh, that's Cute. And then, and then, and then I walked out of his car and I was like, all right, night, night. Let me see you. Morning. I mean, I mean, and then, yeah, it Was a whole thing.


Oh, Was it awkward after that? And no, he, he was like, it's fine, don't worry about it. I remember the time you told me that you love me. And I was like, wow. Does he mean it was one time after cash, you know, had called it off. 'cause he was calling it off every month and a half And you were like, maybe he means it this time. I Remember I didn't talk. There was this one time that like, it was okay because we had not talked to each other for like six months. And then we started talking to each other again. Like as you know, Wait, why didn't y'all talk for six months? Oh, Probably 'cause she called it off. But it's not really that important To story. You wanna hear the traumatic I I I would love to hear the traumatic story. I did, I did share a bit about this in the interview. Can we title this episode the first time?


I said I love you. Well, we never gotta play two shoes in lie. Well I know, but I, We title that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's a good title. The first time I said I love you. Okay. Yeah. You say your story and then I'm gonna say mine. Well, I don't know if I should share the full story because I shared a lot of this in our, our Other video. Oh, oh yeah. Don't say that. We're not allowed to announce that yet for like a good like month. What? Anyways, I will give You, you know what it is I gave, I'll give you guys kind of like a rundown, but you guys will get the full story in detail later. Anyways, so pretty much cash. And I had been like on and off texting and stuff for a couple years and when I was almost 14, so it was the end of eighth grade.


Him and I, I almost 14, 13 years old. No, no, no, No, no. That's insane. This is a key point. This is a key point. Okay. The fact that I wasn't 14 yet is huge. Oh yeah. Okay. So I was 13 and I was getting my braces off in like a week and then like two or three days later was gonna be my 14th birthday and I was hyped. I like, there's no way you were just waiting for the braces to come off cash? No, I had to see what she looked like underneath. Kidding? No, It's even worse. I had like a week until I was getting my braces off and I was so excited. Like for months I was like, I'm gonna get my braces off and I get to show cash, like what I look like without braces. Like, this is so exciting. Like two or three days before I go to get my braces off, he just never answers my text again. Ever For six months straight, he does wanna Text me.


No heartbreaking. We had been texting every day, FaceTiming every day. And one day when he's at VidCon in 2018 with whoever the heck he was with, he decides he's gonna stop texting me. And so he didn't text me and I got my braces off and I didn't get to show him what I looked like without my braces and he didn't text me Happy birthday. Oh. And I remember after I got my braces off and he didn't text me, I was waiting and I was like, surely he's gonna text me on my birthday. Like he knows my birthday is next week. We were just talking about it and he didn't text me on my birthday. And then Guy sounds like a, yeah, like this guy sounds horrible. And So I, after about a month They really slow down. I really wanna take it in. Yeah, okay, you're dropping a lot of bombs. Okay.


So after about a month, because I sent my last snap to him, it was normal. Like we were like texting and Snapchatting. And so I sent him like a random snap and then he takes a few hours to answer and I'm like, oh, that's weird. Like, he usually responds pretty quickly and he didn't, after like a day or two, I was like, I did something wrong and I like was like panicking inside and I, I couldn't just keep snapping him or anything. And so like after like a week, I like double snapped and I was like, Hey, like what you up to? He didn't answer. And after about a month, because I don't think I sent anything after that, after a month he opened my snaps. And you know, You can see when someone opens,

And I'm all excited to get his red Adidas hoodie and Mav gets outta the car and cash just looks at me with this look on his face. And I was like, oh no. Like he's calling it off again tonight. And two days ago he was gonna be giving me his hoodie. And so I was like, that Was a big commitment. I know. And I was like, he was like, yeah, we just, we can't keep talk. I told you guys, we called it off about every month and a half. So he Was just like, listen, I gotta keep the hoodie. No, literally he was like, You can far away. I wait. Literally. I thought you were gonna say He gave it to some other girl in Florida. No, no. He literally, maybe he did. That's why he didn't give it to Me. That was probably what he did. Maybe then I was like crying. Did you wait?


Did you Well, no. Hold on. So I didn't, I don't know if that happened or not, but when I went to Florida, I did meet another girl and that's why I called it off. That's crazy. Like a respectful person. Yeah, like a, because because we weren't dating yet. So I was talking to you kind of, then I was met this other girl. I was like, I don't said, look, I want to give you my hoodie. Like stop saying that's very far ho in relationship. You my ang you act like you're, I want you to be that one that, that's like not even to first base. That's like, and then you got on a plane and met another girl and you, you were like, wanna make out? No. Okay. Yeah. Well anyways. Yeah, pretty much. And so I was like, I'm sitting there crying, he's calling it off and I was like, can I at least like still have the hoodie?


And he was like, I just don't think that's a good idea. And then later I find out that the reason he didn't wanna give me this freaking hoodie, I just don't was, 'cause I just happened to pick his favorite hoodie and he didn't wanna give it to me. I just don't think that's a good idea. I don't know why it was your favorite hoodie and you gave you the option to choose it when you were like, which one do you want on FaceTime? I'm all, she's gonna choose the one You wear all the time, dude. 15, 16-year-old dudes are dirt bags, man. I mean, that is, yeah. So I mean, and then get this, get This.
