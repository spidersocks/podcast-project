No, but you know what? We will get me and Matt will get a miniature pony. 'cause we were already thinking about buying one. Yeah. Why did we get a miniature po? We didn't see what we saw. We saw the cutest pony you've ever seen. It was so cute. Just there it is so skinny. That's gotta be against our HOA. No, I don't think so. It's just like a dog. Yeah. Well say it identifies as a dog. You should saw this pony mem. I've looked at it and it is this little horsey. He's standing there. He is just like Horsey. It identifies. Are you sure? It wasn't like a German shepherd. Sorry. It was a little horse. There's a little horse there. And it was like, that's Kind of like equivalent to Matt saying he wants chicken nuggies. What? He just said horsey. He said, you wanna a horse? Oh, you wanna go ride your Horsey? You can horses. What you call a little horse. You wanna Go get you Ride your, if it's a big horse, you're like, that's a horse. You Guys could go ride your horsey and go get chicken nuggies together. Her, I will call it Horsey thing is if, if it is this, if it's this tall, it's a horsey.


The, The thing is, Maverick said it like, so mainly just no set it Marick did. Maverick said it. So mainly he was, he was like, yeah, we can go get some chicken tinies if you want so Bad it's gonna get some chicken tinies on my horsey. And then he got so excited. He said, yeah. He's like, yeah. And He's so excited. But go watch after that. That's not what happened. I do think we should get me a mini horse or a pony to sit on The episode. Oh, she's telling me to keep, make fun of Maverick. What? No, she's not. Yeah. Are you dumb? Stupid. A dumb, huh? Huh? Are you dumb? Stupid. A dumb Pleasure and a pick me boy pleasure. And a pick Me boy. Swear girl. What? The friend Nole.

Big old feet. Big old feet. New host. Gonna gonna be new host. Gonna be. That was really loud. I'm sorry for your ears. Wow. That is, I saw Kate getting really excited and then New Host is gonna, new host Is gonna be okay. Kate doesn't even know who it is. She's like, who's gonna be, I know. I've gotta share a couch with this new is gonna be, yeah, guys. Kate's biggest. We are like, you know what? I think it's time to add a new host in on the podcast because we decided the more people, the better. The more the merrier perhaps. And now when we have a guest, there'll be six people on There. The bigger The better. And with six people, I just feel like it's, you know, it makes more entertainment conversations. But there was one downside to adding a new host. Oh no. Kate does have to part ways with her chair.


Yeah. Because after this episode or after this episode and the next episode after I'm done sitting in this chair, her chair, it's going in the dumpster. Oh heck no. What? That chair is not going going. The dumpster. This dumpster fired. You guys know? No, it's kind of sad because the pink chair's the only chair that's been here since the beginning. Like even the blue couch, you also on a white couch. The first like two or three episodes. That is true. It was gray. That True Cash has a new chair every single episode. The pink chair, I'm pretty sure has been in every single episode ever. Every single episode. Yeah. And after the next episode, this episode and the next, it's not gonna have been in every single episode, but I've also been in every single episode. Wow. It's just the significance. Actually, nobody's there.


What the freak was that? It's like the opposite of like winking at someone. No, bro. It's like, that's how I imagine pirates. Like that's scary. Roll of guys. Like no, A pirate trying to hit on you. Like, hello, I got my eye out for you. Put an edit if you, if you edit me or whatever. So ready? Watch. No, it's like a lump star. Yeah. A love star. Hey, you guys know what you should do?

'cause I don't want you to stress Kenzie Out de No, no, no, no.


I do not stress Kate out. That's not true. Remember when Harper Harper said that he stresses you out?

Yeah, you yes, You have the baby thing. Oh well that was, We know it was all hysteric. Hysteric. Maverick's gonna cry when I walked down the aisle. Oh my God. She says that with a smile on her face. Dude, you have to, I had to fake it for mine. It's worth it though.

But they, I didn't wanna flood it, but then he, you think I was sitting here and I was like, I can't wait to flood my bathroom. I think you find enjoyment in doing things like Yes. What? No, I think you think it's fun to be like, oh, my bathroom's flooded, huh? No, I didn't wanna do That. It's not normal. I flooded my bathroom on purpose. I feel like you find a little Bit of enjoyment. That was just for film.


We had to do it. It's our job. And then I get stressed out that I can't trust you enough to clean it up completely. I did, didn't I? No. 'cause there's a funky smell now because It's mold. I think that's just the rugs. Oh my gosh. I'll tell you what stresses her out that you do. Thank you. For instance, you know how you were hanging up gonna, you know how I thought you new rugs? Oh, I did. I did. You know how you were hanging up blinds? Yeah. That shoe ordered. Yeah. She really appreciates that. Yeah. Yeah. But you left the cushions. You like took, you took a break. Oh, I know. And I called her and told her that I had to leave and I've been working on 'em the whole time. Yeah. But for some it just es I'm just letting you know. I'm just informing you. You're right. I'm a horrible person. You guys hear that? 75% of the time I stress her out. She buys like $1,000 blinds that are all complicated.


And she's Like, yeah, he called her in the car yesterday. He said, these blind suck balls. Yeah, I said something like that. Okay. I may not have said that word for word. Okay. That's pretty crazy. No, he, I say that. Listen, I don't think that was my choice of word. It's good. Have been. Maybe I don know. That was A very bad example. Listen, 'cause that's not No, no, no. That is a good example. I am going out of my way to hang up her blinds. Okay. And I start on 'em one day, battery dies on the drill, gun, can't find the charger. So I, I put everything away, wait a couple days for the charger to come in. I start getting on the blinds. I have to go to church. I have like an hour to do it. So I'm working as fast and as hard as I Can. I wait save. I wait until the last second I have to leave. And I'm like, all right, I'm gonna have to stop on these. I didn't get it finished.


And you know what? I'll just have to pick it up tomorrow. Can, And you know what? I left, I left the couch cushions out and you didn't work fast enough. That's why I stressed her out. Ma was like, and so that's true. Instead of going, you know what? Maverick worked hard on these blind. That's not true. I Can pick this up real quick. I Think everybody here knows that's not true. I Can, I think cash is literally making me out to be some psycho. Yep. You were putting him to work. He was like, da, never finished Master working. Maybe one day Master Sammy free. No, I come and I, I heard Him sing a song when he was hanging the blinds. Never Nom. Sorry. Okay. What stresses Kate? What stresses Kate out that Mavs does?


I Can. Oh, I Can I don want you to stop talking. Just making me look crazy. Not using a coaster, Guys. No, That is not true. Do Y'all wanna See my, our marble cabinet? Like what? Sorry. I'm sorry. Sweetheart's just funny because it doesn't, but she bought, she bought a coaster for a marble cabinet. I didn't know that. Wast that wasn't a normal thing. I thought you bought coasters to put drinks on. Yeah, but On like wood things. Yeah. Yeah. That isn't things that it would stain. Well, that just seems weird. Like when you have a glass of water and like the, the glass starts getting wet on the outside, it drips all over the counter and then you just got a puddle of water on the counter. But if you put it on the coaster, it stays on the coaster. Yeah. Putting a coaster on a marble counter is like vacuuming the grass anyways. It's like use, it's like useless. I'm Going to defend myself on the blinds.


It's like digging a hole in Too, because I look crazy. You're gonna defend yourself on the blinds because I look crazy. I came in and I think everybody knows that I, okay, I have a little bit of some issues and I know that, I know that if everything's not perfect, I shouldn't freak out the way I do, but I do. Okay, so let's rephrase what you said. I stress myself out 75% of the time. No, that was just cash saying like, that was literally just cash being an instigator and trying to get us to argue right now. What? 'cause I Came in, no. Wasn't I heard the reclip. It was raw. I'm just an innocent man that secretly recorded something. Wait, no. Does does this stress you out? Just be honest. All right. All right. Okay. So hold on. Don't keep you sit up. You can t do it.
