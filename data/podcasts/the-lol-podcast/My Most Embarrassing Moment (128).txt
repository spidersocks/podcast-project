I mean, I, before I open the shower here, what I was like, is there a visco girl in there? What's going on? A SCO girl. This Is what I see.


Yo, that's like Mackenzie. That's like a whole nother level. I done to see that photo if you wouldn't show it to Me. Wait, Kate. So you didn't get to wash your feet then? No, I did because then I take my feet out and I step on top of the plastic bag and you scrub your feet and then you put your feet back in. What We went, but the inside of the bag's pretty dirty. And then after she gets outta the shower, she's like, CAS, make sure to hang my shoes. Hang the bags. Gotta let the bags dry. I had to hang dry them because I had to use them the next night. Oh my goodness. Did what y'all think when you walked in and saw my bags? I Okay. Took a shower. No, I, I, I genuinely, personally think that could be considered a problem.


Maybe you become mean. It's not though because hotel showers are, you might have ocd possibly. No, I'm writing that off my list of things To talk about. Okay. No hotel showers are, I Can guarantee you they don't go in after every single guest and bleach the shower like you should because people go into these hotel showers and do who knows what. Okay, stop defending yourself. You're just weird. No. Okay. You're just gonna have to accept that fact. Do Y'all know that people like pee in showers and then they, I pee showers and they splash a little water on the pee. That's to these two people right here. I peed one time in a shower. That's a lie. Lie after I learned it was a thing, I listen. I was like, but How do you know Maverick pee's in showers? Because, 'cause he openly says it. 'cause he was yelling at him in the hotel and was like, stop peeing in the shower. I Don if was, that was a weird phrase to hear coming from the shower.


That was a joke. But what do you mean it was a joke? You were like, just kidding. I'm not pee. I am waiting for our marriage to get a little more stable. No, You can't say that. I'm sorry. Y'all shower together. What have I missed? I didn't realize what I said could be taken totally wrong. So we probably should cut that part out. Yeah, cut that. But that part was funny. I just, I'm just confused. I just can't see y'all like The same shower Just, well you shouldn't Anyways, just I'd like to move on now. Okay. I'm just gonna let you all know, make Sure that pork got cut out.


That people do gross things in hotel showers. Like what? And they don't like pee like pee on the floor. Okay. What? And you come in right after that guest and you're stepping in there. Yeah. You would hate to know that before we got married. When I went to a hotel and they had the bathtub. Oh, did I sit in there and eat chocolate? Oh, Say. Oh, you did not sit in the bathtub sit. Oh no, because I didn't have a bathtub at home. At home. So when I had one in the hotel, I was lit. See like Why y'all making chocolate Cash? Actually loves baths. I've caught cash for chocolate. Epsom salt candles. The whole nine yards in the bathtub. He does. I was really little. What When was about 15?


No, he was like, he watched some video that was like top five things millionaires do. And cash was like, well I wanna be a millionaire. Listen, You act like one. Do you guys all see bath? Do you see the reaction? You guys all just had to cash sitting in a bathtub in the hotel. I sit in bathtubs in the hotel. Why? I am sorry. Respect. Thank you. You survived. I I sit in the bathtub in the hotel, but like in my, in my apartment in Canada, I, I took baths. No showers. Well that's Okay everybody I shower off After my baths. How in the world is an Airbnb? Different? Kate. What? Because if you're staying in an Airbnb, you probably have apartment little bit more time to go to the store and get cleaning supplies to clean it yourself. Did you bleach your bathroom? No. You cooked. You cooked.


Kate, you really hate to know that before we got married. You don't tell me. You know how I laid down in the shower? I did. I did that in in hotel showers too. I'd be full on.

Oh, I was saying that as a complete joke before you just said that. No, she really thought that it was hilarious. That's funny. That's bad. I've been to pawn off your trees. Dude, that's bad. Me and Cash tried to sell some things growing up. We sold everything. I sold out, dude. They were a little Businessman. I got Facebook market when I was nine. What? Yep. I was listening my video games on Craig. $5 a pop. We're we were not stealing. Your parents Were Facebook at nine. Yeah. But they did not know I was hustling.


We were hu They did not know that. We would find, and we'd find things to our parents and literally sell them. Literally I'd be like, mom, you need that. I haven't used that in years. Can I have it? Sure, You can have it. Put it up. Great. Yeah. If I'm gonna be honest, I actually, I Had like such a big habit. I just, okay. No, I'm kidding.

You had To pick up a lot of poop. I did. I did. But no, I went on Poshmark and I sold all my stuff and I got some money. Wow. Recently For a while. Not a while ago. Oh No.


Cash was like trying, he's like 10 trying to go meet up with strangers off of Facebook. One time, I remember when I first started, my mom didn't know I was listening to things on Facebook market and I listed some video games for sale and this guy was like wanting them and I scared him away because every time I texted him after it's like been a minute, I'd pick up my phone and text him and I'd say, Hey. And that's it. I, I'd wait for him to say, hey back. And then I'd be like, great. So now about these video games. And then like a couple hours go by and I'd be like, Hey. And he'd be like, hi, hey. And then I'd be like, all right, let's talk more. And I don, you wanna buy? Very weird. Now looking back on it, dude, I remember doing some weird deals.


There was one time I, I like traded for this little mini computer, like those little tiny ones. And then me and you really wanted paintball guns and this guy had three paintball guns. What, what thought? So I met up in this like gas station parking lot and I was like, how old were you? I was 13. Oh. And I think mom or dad one drove or something. Yeah, one of us was there. And, and so I like jumped out the minivan. I remember to this guy's car and I like handed him this little computer and he hands me three paintball guns. Now they're going across the parking lot. Like Let Like an illegal arms deal. Just I Can So when you were 13 you met up with like a strange man in a parking lot and Well, my mom and my mom and dad were there. I'm not saying it was a good idea, but, but at 13 years old you met up with a man in a parking lot and like That's crazy. But my mom and dad were keep leaving that, leaving out a key part.


They're not real guns. They were Paintball guys's. Good for the intro. Now people are gonna see that and be like, Maverick met up with a man in a parking lot. Oh, I Can get in the intro. Yeah. I met up with this guy off of Facebook when you were 13. When I was 13 in a parking lot to buy guns from him at 13. And we bought them paintball guns. He bought the guns. Paintball guns. You bought the guns. Well I didn't buy 'em. I traded him for that little laptop. Dude, I was a trade, we were trade, we were making bargains. That's crazy. One time Harper, we bought a unicycle off Facebook marketplace. This was crazy. Turns out, well first off it was a crazy good deal when we found it. We were like, oh my goodness, a crazy Good deal for a unicycle. You understand? They expensive. They get expensive.


And I said, sold brand. And I was like, that's an expensive 1 36 inch wheel. An expensive, it was a mountain bike of a unicycle. It was crazy. We went and bought it and then we post a picture of us riding it on Instagram, like, look at my name of uni. And then we, we post it and one of our friends or like, and we paid like 200 bucks for it, which was a really good deal because it's like a $900 unicycle. Yeah. One of our friends that we met like a couple of times was more like my sister's friend. An acquaintance. Yeah. Yeah. You could say. Yeah, he comments on it. He said a friend and he's like, where'd you get that? And and then I was like, I bought it on Facebook. And then he starts texting me and he's like, that's my unicycle. I was like an hour half away from, and he was like, oh, somebody Stole it from You.

He was, he threw his u he got something stuck in a tree. So he threw his unicycle in the tree trying to get it down. What? And he got his unicycle stuck in the tree. So he went home to get a ladder and then when he got back, his unicycle was gone. That's Crazy. Yeah. Also because even if I saw a unicycle in a tree, I'm assuming that's freebies at that point.
