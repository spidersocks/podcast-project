Yeah. Okay. Just a little bit of sad music right here. Okay, got it out. Ready and go.


So last year for Halloween I was like really excited because like it was the first Halloween, second Halloween in our house and like it's actually gonna pass out candy for the first year and like, oh no. You know all the things. Yeah. And we got this package in the mail from Feast Bowls and they had like the mini feast bars. Yeah. And all year they had sent us so many chocolate bars we couldn't even get through 'em. Oh yeah. So I was like, I'm gonna save them for Halloween. Nothing stays on that wall. Well it's very sad. I was unfortunate Ruining the sad vibes. Alright, Back to sad music. Alright, cue the music back in. Go. So I was so excited that we were gonna be the house with full size feast bowls and mini feast bowls. I had bought in like so much extra candy in case we ran out. It's hard To talk about. So I'm sitting outside passing out candy and it's freezing and cash went and got the toilet for that to be our candy bowl. So we had a dirty toilet outside. We had a dirty toilet candle. I put poop on it to make it look or I put peanut butter on it to make it look like I pooped In it. Did he actually, yeah. Some parents would walk by and they were like, don't get candy out. Yeah. There was like multiple parents who were like, we're okay. They Were like, oh we'll go to the next house. I was like, what the, yeah. Anyways, So I put out the feasts and stuff And some of those kids, they were double fisted and grabbing candy outta there. They were like yeah because we didn't have a limit and full size candy bars inside there. Yeah. That's Insane. Well No, that's what upset me was I was like being very generous with the candy I was giving out because not only was I giving out all our feasts, I also went and I bought, which were like vegan. I went and I bought full-sized candy bars


and I bought extra extra bags of candy just in case we ran out. And I was like, okay, well I sat outside for a while, most of the kids had come by and I was like, okay, everyone finally is like here for the Halloween party. So I'm just gonna like leave this out here with like a sign. Like, I don't know. I said like, what did we put on it? I don't even know. Please take one. No, Not take one. I wouldn't have said take one. I was not gonna be that house. But I like made it clear like, don't take the whole bowl. Yeah. That's just rude. And I literally, I kid y'all not, I went inside to go to the bathroom. All my candy is still there. I went inside to the the bathroom and I walked back out and every piece of candy is gone. Well what did you experience? Every Single, every single chocolate bar. Every single full size bar.


Every single tiny little piece of candy I had bought. Completely gone. Probably Got flushed. I bought candy two years in a row and not a single trick or treater has come to my door. That's depressing. I'm sorry. So I've had candy till like February. He's Been real sad. Well this neighborhood in like this area has a lot of kids. So, and then like people showed up and they like some people were like, knew who we were. So I feel like they took advantage of that. And if I seal again this year, What are you gonna do? Fight 'em. No, you're not getting any of my candy this year. It's right. 'cause you took all of it last year. Greedy. Greedy little kids. Somebody stole our cauldron. Your what? I'm sorry. What? Somebody stole Our cauldron.


Right? You had a witch cauldron. Yeah. Talked our cats and spouse. It had all The fun candy in it and They got stole. Wait, so you put all your candy in the cauldron and then somebody took the whole cauldron. Like not even just dumped it out. They took the whole thing. Yes It Did. That's Crazy. Got the truck up right here. I got a cauldron. That's pretty Sad. Was crazy. Somebody left their cauldron out. Did you guys Ever do that? Were you ever the kid who like when they left out a bowl of candy? Listen, you Took like the whole Bowl as a kid when I was going into the house, like this is me. Right? I got to, oh, the candy's right there to, I got to eight oh oh oh. It's a bowl full of candy. It says please take one. I'm gonna take it all. I'll take eight and I take eight.


I don't take the whole thing. Eight. Okay. Eight is like, okay, if you say please take one. You gotta expect kids to grab more than one. At least a handful. But It's the like 13-year-old little boys who think it's okay to dump the whole bowl in their pillowcase. Oh my gosh. So annoying. It's like, Like it's so, it like ruins it for everyone else and then it's like 7:00 PM and all the candy's gone and like no one can get candy for the rest of the night. 'cause one 13-year-old boy thought it'd be funny to take the whole bag. Like it's not funny. No, Not funny. Wait, can We make not funny? Can we make like a hallway to the front door this year that's like lined in black sheet paper. And so it's real scary to go through And at the end it's like a big bathtub or something and cash is like laying in the bathtub with the candy and They go to get a piece of candy.


Scary. We should post. No it not scary. We should make a post for everybody to come to our house to trick or treat. Wait, frick. No. Are are you sitting? Yeah. That'd be so fun. I'm sorry, did y'all not just hear? Ken said we should make a big thing and then at the end of it just scare everyone. It's just cash in a bathtub. Wait, I Didn't finish my sentence. Okay.
