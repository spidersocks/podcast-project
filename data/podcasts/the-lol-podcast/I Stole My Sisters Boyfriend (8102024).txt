And he was like, yeah, sure. And he drops his bags to take a picture with him and they're like, no, with your car. They what? That did happen. I'm not gonna lie. Oh, that did not happen. It was the most awkward thing. We were at the casino. That's so funny. Casino. And I'm walking in. Yeah, we were walking in and we were gonna stay the night up there. So I'm carrying bags in and this lady runs up to me like freaking out. And I'm like, hi, hello. And so I I, she's got her phone out. She's like, can we get a picture? Can we get a picture? That's rough. and I'm, I'm like, I am like carrying all this stuff. I'm like, yeah, sure. I set my bag down, I look up the lady's gone. and I was like, what? And she wanted a picture with the truck. That's so funny. But her daughter, That was with her, was like, probably That was humbling.

Alex, were you with me? That's what it was. she didn know me. Maverick was, but she didn was, it was me, Michael. It was me. I was with you. Not Michael was with me. Not you. Nope. It was the funniest thing. Michael was like, what do you wanna say? The girl's just sitting there like just staring. I don feeling. That did not Happen. That did happen. But you know what happens all the time, brother? This happens every single day. These people run off the cash and they say, are you Maverick Baker? Not even once. I can't Confirm that. Whenever we're, since I am unbiased here, whenever we're out, people come up to us and they'll say, where's Harper?


Yeah. People for people Come come up to me and say, Where's Cash? Kate and Mav? And I'm like, yeah. People for some reason feel like I Guess. We just all, yeah. I think we talked about this the other day. We need to get a Team 10 House. I. Guess. Yeah. We just all walk around together 24 7. Like, I'll, I'll see people gay. Like I get it when they ask me Where's Kate? That's kind of understandable. But people will be like, why aren't Mavin Harper here? I'm like, I'm at Walmart. Like, what? What do you mean? They're like, walk around, but where are they? I'm like, don don't know. They're waiting in the car. They're in the car right now. No, but to settle the cash or Maverick's debate, It's settled. Okay. Nobody thinks they're, What is the worst part about living with Harper? She's, she really likes to embarrass me. Like no matter what, like she'll go out of her way to purposely embarrass me.


And like, I would never Yes, you do. Like for instance, whenever we're at like restaurants and stuff, almost every single time without fail, she will put on a whole act in front of the waiter. Like Harper, she'll all of a sudden be British or like have some sort of strange accent and start like, like not Yelling at her. I can just see her now. She sitting there But making weird noises at the waiter or like doing random stuff just to try to embarrass me and my family. Yes. Yes. She'll, she'll put her arm like in her shirt and act like she's missing an arm or something. I know. I've never done that. Yes. Bring her water. She's like, how do you expect me to grab that?


I do that for now. I'm gonna put both my arms, my shirt and I. I'll be like the waiter, Hey, can you lift up my drink so I can drink it? And then after I drink it, I'm just gonna take my arms out. Yeah. No I mean I can say I used to do that when I was little. You've done that. Oh, I Bet you do that now. This past year I can see her at the table just like, can I get a yes, that's exactly what she does. I should do that. and I was like, can I get a hug? No, no. But literally you wanna do the mumbling. It's like, can I get him in? Yeah. No, me and Brooke used to do that. We, we, we went in TJ Maxx and we used to go up to people and we were like, hi, do you know where the h showing is? And stuff.


That was so funny. But, and then this one lady got really mad at her. But anyways, that's besides the point. We have a special guest on here got backing away from me. Well, something I like to do a drive through me and cash actually love, I love messing with people at Drive-throughs. It's just the best thing. I It because you can just drive away when you want. So no, I hate it. I, I'll mess with people everywhere, but I will not mess with people that are making my food. I don't do it. I, It and Maverick loves to do it. We'll be ordering our food and then he messes with them and I'm like, great. I'm not eating it now. Because they Probably poison spit Your food. No, but I joke around with them. They'll spin your like I'll bark at 'em. Yeah. Matt jokes around with 'em. He's like, they it so funny. and I'm like, no, Matt, they're annoyed with you. They're very annoyed.


No, just put Or the last, what did we do at Panda Express the other day? don don't know. I said something. Oh, it was funny. That lady freaked out. That's, they knew where my chihuahua was. No, That was last week. Okay. No, That was. No. Oh. I said, I said we got to the window and she was like, okay, it's gonna be like $37 'cause you got cash orders, like five big fivefold boxes of food. and I was like, oh no, we don't, we don't have any money. oh, Yeah, she like, that's gonna be 37. And That was like, oh, okay. And he like fiddles for a second. He goes, don don't have any money.


She, she was like, it was just awkward for a minute. She was like, it was awkward. Oh, I didn't say anything. she didn't say anything. We're staring at each other. And then I was like, can we get like a, you know, comp or something. I got you next time. And then last time Maverick also when you, did she give it to you? No, no. I had to pay. And then one time, or not one time, multiple times when Maverick picks me up food, like at Panda Express, they'll always ask at the end, oh, would you like to donate to this, blah blah blah. The donate to the trees or whatever. And Matt's always like, if it's on my card, he is like, yeah, $50. I'm like, what? It's to The children's hospital, you know That. Oh well sometimes it's, it's very generous of you, honestly.


Thank you. Yeah, no, I will say I learned that those places do that for tax purposes. Oh. Oh really? Oh, you're one of those people. I did learn that. I always, I was always donating and then I realized that the only reason they do it is 'cause they get tax benefits if they I. Don thought you're speaking on a subject that you really don't know about. Yeah. I don. I don't think you're an accountant. I don't think you really know the, the children's donation at Panda where it really goes. Exactly. We don't know. Well, okay, I mean don don't know much. But I know what a write off is. A write-off does not actually save you money. Yeah. If you give them the money and they give it to someone else, it means You don't pay taxes on the money. And, it makes it zero. They didn't benefit at all. If you give me money, then I give it to the foundation. That doesn't benefit me at all. So Should I be donating to the children's hospital at Panda Express?


I don, Why would I donate my money to Panda Express when I could just donate the money to the Children's Hospital directly? Go for it, dog. Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep track. Yeah, cash won because I'm gonna still keep donating your money. I'm gonna keep track of every time I round up my change of Panda and instead of giving it to Panda at the end of the year, I'll just give my like $7 to the Children's hospital. Yeah. Somebody, the other day I pulled up in a parking lot and Kate goes into like the mail place and they like, they're outside with like their table and everything. And she was like, and I was like, oh, Yeah come. She was like, want me to come to the car And. it was Outside of a Bakery. Yeah, she's gonna like come to me. I thought they were giving away free smoothies, like free like smoothie samples or something. And she comes to my car, she has no smoothie and she gives me a clipboard. She's like, would you like to donate $500, 100?


I was like, what? Oh God. And she was just like, $500 helps 100 kids from anti-bullying. I'm like, first of all, how do I know that? They just put a random number on there and was like, if you donate 50 bucks, 30 kids won't get bullied. Yeah. What are they paying off the bullies? Well like giving 'em a hundred bucks a day. Not to bully kids. Yeah. I can say that. Like Reese does sometimes bully me. What? When have I Bullied you? You need $50. That's what you need. You probably bite at her ankles though. I did say, or I did do remember when we were younger? I bet your arm and you're like, ow. And then like, and Dad got really mad. You still hit me sometimes to this day When me re, me and Reese used to get humongous fights. Like we used to get so mad at each other.


Did you guys ever fight over chairs? Chairs? Like, Like, like who could sit where? Yeah. Like if they were sitting like in your spot, like for instance now We have put this way right now. Maverick is very jealous of me. Like if Kaf got and I on the podcast because I'm sitting in the amazing chair. No, after the podcast he'll become very jealous and he'll try to fight me for this shit. I certainly won't. But if he got out of that chair, let's say he got up, went downstairs to make himself a bowl of cereal and then I was like, All, right? He's outta the chair. I'm gonna sit there now. Then he comes back up and he is like, Hey, I was still sitting there giving my chair back and I'm like, mm, I have 15 minutes left. I'm not getting up. Would you guys fight over that I Mean? Yeah, probably. But I don think like specific like I can, No, we're trying to like, I'm trying to think like, like At at the dinner table, our family has specific spots.


We always Sit up. So that's like Reese, my dad are sitting together. I'm saying Byre my Mom. Yeah. We had specific spots like that too growing up. And now when I go back home, my spot, there's like one empty chair and it's like not next to like where Kate would sit if like a guest came over. So now when we go back home, I still sit in my chair next to my mom and then Kate sits on the other side of the table. She's like, why are you sitting over there? and I don't know. It just feels right. I can't see that. You can't Have to keep your spots Every time. I'm like, cash, why don't you sit next to me? And he's like, this is my spot. And he, So she ends up sitting next to me. It's just like weird. And then Kenzie's gonna be on the other side of the table and he is throwing, Yeah. Kids could be sitting next to cash. No, but they did it because when Cash was younger they couldn't trust him with knives to cut his food.


What table? And when we say younger we mean like 14. Okay. Yeah. I stabbed the table with it. So his mom had to cut his food for him. Yeah. That's embarrassing. Couldn't trust him. But no. Yeah, me and Reese, I remember we got in a big fight over like something and like you slammed my fingers in the door and stuff. Whoa. That did not happen when It was like a few years ago. I do not That's on you. Harper for like letting was terrible. She held your hand there and was like, I'm going to slam it. And you just like let it happen. No, she I can hear lie Reese's voice.

I tried to film a good video. oh, Yeah, if you post pooping videos' of you pooping On Instagram. but like Disney does the same thing I I for a video the other day I was gonna wear like, well who are you gonna wear about?

She's, She does these, she does these big back activities all the the time. Wow. Big back activities. Wait, what is, what is a big back activity? Is Big back activities For what is that? That Was me. What is that? Actually, I'm so jealous of Reese because she's so tall and she's Wait To the, the question Harper know you're jealous of Reese.


You've made that very clear this episode. Okay. I know I'm very, very jealous of Reese. 'cause she's my pooky. Oh, do Not call me that. Explain. Do call me Pooky. A big bag Is just Like eating like someone that eats a Lot. Oh, you a big bag? No, like a big bag is I. It is, it's like if you're like from here to here, like that's how big you, you are. Okay then. Am I that big? Am I really that big? So you're saying it's literally just a big back. Basically. I mean one time, one time on the boat, Reese called me, said that I had a big back because my swimsuit was going to up my back. Like it was like, like I, well I I don't think I mi it like that. And it and like, it's supposed to be straight, but like the bikini like made a curve on the back.


And it looked like I had a big back and Reese was like, you look like a big back right now. I don't even remember. Oh, is It's supposed to be like a whale, like a big back. Yeah. Yeah. And but like me and Reese we do have sometimes where we like have good sister Bunny slam was like yesterday. Yesterday fun. We had a good time. We went to get our nails done together and, and then We got food. and I made you help me wash my car? Yes. Oh, That was nice. You, oh. And then I sucked up some plastic and I was like, yeah. And then she sucked up a huge plastic bag and clogged up the vacuum at the car wash. And it iss making this huge like super loud noise and everyone's looking over like, what is going on? It was really bad. Did you guys leave it like that? No, I took It out. He would like yank it out. Yeah. Those things get me though. When I'm sucking things up, I'm just like, what?


Can I suck up? Yeah. What can, your dad is freaking out right now listening to it. Yeah. My dad owns a car wash and I tell him the things I do at Car washes. And, it causes them nightmares. Like one time I was on the way to church, I had a 44 ounce smoothie and I, I got it in my car. It's ginormous and I drop it as soon as I get in my car and it's all over my floorboard just in a big puddle. and I was like, it's a pool. and I was like, well going to the car wash. So I take the vacuum And, I just suck it all up. And. it did a great job. If y'all are ever in that situation, it does a great job. I said, no vacuums Could Suck up Liquid. oh, Yeah it supposed to, it just sucked it all up. And then And it just sucked it all up off, even off the carpet.


And it looks like a brand new floor. And then I told my dad about it and he was like, oh no. Oh. Oh. Apparently it makes a huge mess for the car wash people. Yeah. Oh. So now that's why you pay. That's it's worth the a dollar 25. Actually I think the vacuums are free. Vacuum are free. You know what? I don didn't even pay at that one because I didn't even take my car through a car wash. I just use the free vacuums. You're wow. But you know, now that your dad owns a car wash, I'm in my head about what I do at car washes though. Like the other day I broke the vacuum and I got scared. I was about to just drive away and I thought, what would James want me to do? Oh. wait, wait, wait. You, how did you break the vacuum? And Literally broke in half. Like it was in two pieces. Snapped The plastic snapped.


Yes. Oh, it like, And you were just gonna drive away. I was so scared. That is crazy. You don't take responsibility for your Own actions. No, I wasn't going to. Wow. And then I said, what would James do? and I said James would want me to go find him. So I went looking for James for An Attendant for Hey James. Hey James. No. Yeah. I like yelled across the parking lot. I was like, excuse Me, You, you're crap broke. I was like, I was like holding it in two pieces. I was like, it broke. And he was like, oh, that happens all the time. and I was like, okay, well it sounds like y'all need new vacuums if this happens all the time. Yeah. No, but So I got one more question. What have you guys ever like liked the same guy I fought over him. Yes. What the No, not Really.


No. It's crazy is me and Mal are the same age happen. We never like never talked to the same girl, looked at the same girl. The same girl was very respect with the same girl. Like if he was like, I'm slightly interested in this person. Off limits not even close. Yeah. Well The thing is But, we also have two different types. Completely. No, What? Like We have chicks. You and Kenzie are that far apart. No, I'm saying before. No, we just like, we just like chicks. Girls. Any I mean Trust me. Cash likes any girl. What? Trust me. I know. Like literally me and Reese, we like, she's at, she's gone for a bunch of younger kids like me. Younger kids. Kids. You for younger kids. Well, you're an adult in Texas. I've never gone for someone Younger than me.


Oh really? Yeah. Really? I, I know you haven't, but like, it just, I I literally just want you to know that I sometimes Wait, that's kind of concerning. 'cause if Reese's only gone for people older than her, you're quite a bit younger than her. So if you're going for the same people, well Yeah, you too. Like what? Yeah, but remember we don't go for the same people. Yeah. Not even, never even slightly. Well MA's his Kate, right? Nope. What? What? Certainly not. That did not happen. Okay. This is true. I wanna know right now. Oh no, that's, I'll say theirs. This one time we had to do a video. What Remember the swapping girlfriends for a day?


We Didn't kiss. No, but it was like A cheek kiss. Yeah, we we did a video kiss. It did really well too. We did swapping girlfriends for a day. It was so bad. Ah, It's such a hard watch. I can't Watch the video. That was a hard video. It's not on AV channel. Yeah. Yeah. I took his girlfriend. He took my girlfriend and then we like make content And. it was, it was, it was pretty weird. Was it was really awkward. We do, we need to do it again. I got confused. No, we don't. No, No, no. That's no I mean like I, I like text Grace's Exes when she breaks up with him and stuff, but yeah. So you just wait for her to be done. Yeah. And Then you shoot. That's respectful. Yeah, exactly. She, she's just checking up on 'em like And I also. Hey, how you doing?


Since my, since my sister broke your heart. I know. Really messed up with her. I would never, I would never do that. She's always trying to stir the pot. No, I'm not. I'm not Ese. Yeah. Are you over there? Like, I think Reese is still interested Sometimes. Sometimes. What? If not, I'm interested. That's A easy Oh, Well I like Jo. I troll around. I'm like joking around with them and I'm like, it's not like I'm always here. And, and like they're, they're they know it's a joke though. 'cause I'm joking around like obviously. No, you gotta be careful. I, so my sister was older than me and I used to joke around with her friends. Yeah, yeah. Oh, this was bad. We've talked about it. No, we haven't recently. No, we no we haven't. We haven't talked about this.


We haven't joke around. Yes, we certainly have. No, we did not. We did not talk about this. We talked about it months ago. Months ago. We talked about this in Oklahoma map. Okay. Okay. I'll say the story then. All. right. So I was feeling that probably the worst. Not good. This is probably one of the worst things I've done on the internet. Okay. First before anything is done, anything is said, you gotta set the scene that we were two immature children. No, not even that. I felt like I was a very mature kid. No, my sister is four years older than me and like two years older than Mav. So for some reason we just always look and, but she was so much more mature than us all the time. And like we said the same thing. You're kind of saying like, oh well it's just a joke. They would never Yeah. And we were like, oh, our sisters like so much older than us.


So she had all her friends come over. Right. Obviously we had a crush on like every single one of them. And Oh. And not to mention all of my sister's friends were models. Every single one. Yeah. So it was every single, it was a great childhood. And I was like, I loved when she had sleepovers. That's Yeah. Yeah. I looked at her while she slept. What? And I was like 4 13, 14. And. I was like 15, 16. And we're like, we got a great idea, Matt. You should call one of her friends. Ask them out on a date to troll them because obviously you're so much younger and they're gonna be like, what? No, we thought I'm gonna get rejected live on a live stream. I'm gonna get rejected.


And we, we, we live, live streamed it. so we made it like kind of cringey. Even like, I'm sitting there like, like, and I'm like, when I'm saying it, I'm like, would you wanna go out on a date sometime? oh yeah. Know we like purposely made it cringey and I'm live streaming. And he, he's like, oh, he's about to get rejected so hard. Yeah. And then did Did she reject You? No. She said I'd love to. How old is she? And then you know what happened? And old is been like 18. No, no wait. And then do you know what happened? She was like, yeah, I'd be down for that. Me and Ke go like this, mute the microphone. We're like, oh no. And then, and then Maverick panicking and then Maverick panics and just hangs up. Pretty girls never said yes before. We didn't know what to do.


He literally just hung up the phone and we were like, oh my gosh, now you gotta tell her it was a prank. And he called her back and told her it was a prank. What did she say? Live on the live stream. We called her back. oh My gosh. That's awful. Oh, Yeah. Yeah. I Don know why y'all had it in your head that these girls were like in their twenties. Don don't know why you, why you got back and said it was a prank. Why didn't you just go with it and go on the date with the hot model? Yeah, because don don't know man, I got scared. I felt bad. Now that I'm thinking about that. You folded. We folded that bag. Fumbled that bag. You folded hardcore. That's so sad. As 14 and 15-year-old boys. Four girl. Yeah. That was, That was, yeah. I would love to with this 15-year-old boy Dude. They were saying yes. That's that's crazy.


That's Actually insane. That's really funny. Oh no, it wasn't funny. It was, it was sad. I It was one of the best moments of my life. But the moral of the story is you can't joke around. Yeah. With Reese's ex-boyfriend. don don't I. don think she's joking man. I'm not joking. No, she actually, So would you say that actually likes them? Would you say that Reese has a good taste in guys? No, not really. Her. Can you talk to them? Not really her, one of her boyfriends. She's only had one by the way. Then Why did then, did You say one that she said like such a Disappointment. And how many boyfriends have you had? Zero. No, sixth Grace Slade. Slade. No, You. don, you don't count.


I Don't think a relationship counts. Give each other Valentine's Day cards when you drop it in the bag. No, we didn't Even talk to each other. We dated for 24 hours and then I don.
