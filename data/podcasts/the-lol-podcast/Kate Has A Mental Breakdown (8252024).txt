They also have peanut ones. Is that Girl? Wait, we should get the, the hot dog floaty and tie it to the jet skis. Oh. Oh, I see. I've always wanted one of the hot dogs floaties, but Maddie and Kate told me not to spend that much money on it. What? Yeah. Cash. The hot dog float. You Can spend your money. I don't care. Cash has a thing where he like loves to save money and then he randomly will pick like the most whack thing he wants to spend, buy his money on like a massage chair. He decides he needs this massage chair so bad. Is it his one? He finds it and then he has buyer's remorse and now we're after buying it. Okay.


He would've had buyer's remorse an hour after buying the hot dog floating. The thing is pretty cool though. I don't have buyer's remorse because I will sell it and make my money back. Maybe I make profit. Maybe you don't. No, it's just, I Think what you do is you get so in your head and you convince yourself you need it so bad and you start thinking so deeply about it. And it's like, I don't know, life without this massage chair. I have to have it. I don't know, life without my hot dog. Floaty. The worst buyers remorse I've ever experienced. Yeah. And you were there with me. The worst buyer was remorse. We did it together too. We were like, you know what, it's our honeymoon or something. Or our anniversary. It was our anniversary. It Was Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day. Like it's, it's Valentine's Day.


We're gonna go to a nice restaurant. We go to, we go to this place called Perry's. And we normally always go on Friday because they have this like pork chop that's like $18 on Friday and it's like banging. But normally in the week it's like 50 bucks or something. And we are like, you know what? We're gonna go not on Friday, go On a nice date, Go on a nice date at night because on Friday you gotta go at like noon. But we're like, we're gonna go at night, dress up, go to the science restaurant. What, You know what's sad is we did go on Friday, we just went about an hour after the pork chop deal Ended. Okay. Well that was just stupid of us then. But we go there, we order normally our meals like maybe $50 when we go there. Not too bad. And this time, how much was it?


I don't like talking about it. It was 200, right? It Was, I'm pretty sure our meal was $200 and all we got was two pork chops. Oh. Well one got Like 600 food. We got less food. I'm not even joking. Less food for like triple the price. Because when we go during the pork chop deal on Fridays between 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM or something, you get the pork chop and Mashed Potatoes. Mashed potatoes. This Time I paid more money and they gave me no mashed potatoes. Well, Wait and I, We were literally sitting there eating and we're eating this meal and both of us are just like, I'm not having a good time. And, and then when, and then when the ticket came, we were like, Ugh, This sucks. We we, let's never do this again. It was the worst Valentine's Day ever. It was Sad.


I We Was Valentine's Day though. It, it's not gonna be funny anymore. I feel like We should never What do you mean? It's not gonna be funny, funny On food. My pie's a joke. One time I went to a sushi place and I didn't eat any sushi and it was $800. 800. What? What The, that's Just a lot Mom. It was 600 or 800, but there Was a bunch of us there. Dang. Y'all spend 600 on Sushi. More than two people. Yeah. I don't, when it's a group setting, it's not as, it doesn't hurt us bad. But when cash and I just decided we wanted to go spend $200 on a meal just for us To, that it's a hundred dollars a plate. God can to you. Nothing is, It was brutal. Like, I was like so upset. I was like, I feel like Maverick and I never wanna feel like Maverick again.


Yeah. That's why we did it too. Because of you. What I got in y'all's head. Yeah. You literally, your first date with Kinzie was at Perry's. Yeah. Not on Fridays. Yeah, but I'll tell you what, we didn't spend 200 bucks. What could y'all have gotten there Then? I got a steak. He got a steak and we shared some fries. Oh, that's, That's 200 bucks. No, that was like a hundred bucks. That's Literally what we did. No, it was literally like a hundred bucks. I had to get, I'd love to see the bill. I Just went to lunch with a friend and I paid and it wasn't a date and I spent a hundred dollars. And so that's what you call stupid. Whoa. Wait. So your Valentine's Day, how Did you spend hundred bucks? Well, I Don dunno. Why is it so expensive to eat? Where'd you go? Sip and saver. Sip and saver. Sip And saver. It was good.

How did that go? Asking everyone to be your bridesmaid? Well, did they all say yes? Yeah, everyone said That Was kind of awkward if someone said no though. Right? It says it. That would be really awkward. Like, and Maverick has no groomsmen. Who's The maid of honor? What? My sister. Your Sister? Okay. That's good. That's, I just don't ask people to be my groomsmen. Like, that's weird. Will You be my Groomsmen? Yeah. Hey, will you be my groomsmen? Like, no. Yeah. You have to start the conversation like this. Listen bud. I know you don't wanna be in the wedding. Yeah. And I'm sorry, I'm asking you, but I have to have groomsmen.


Yeah. I don't understand why girls like being in weddings scenes. It's so, so every guy I ask, I I know inside is like saying, please don't do this. Please. It's like an honor to be asked to be in somebody's Wedding. Would you wanna be in somebody's wedding? Harper? Yeah. It's just really, No. Yeah. I don't, don't. Yes you do. You don't wanna be, you didn't wanna be In our wedding? No, I don't wanna see people kiss. I don't do that. I don't wanna see Love. No, our first kiss is gonna be at our wedding. I know. You Don't wanna watch it. I talked to Kate about it Actually yesterday. She was talking to about it. Yeah. What do you mean? I'm Gonna tell you also. What, What On Wait, wait, wait. What were y'all talking about? First of all, it started out like Harper saying that's so weird. Cash used to be the attractive brother because Maverick's definitely the more attractive one. What the I'm kidding.


What the I'm Okay. No, no, No, no. Wait. Are you kidding? No, No, no, no, no, no. Or was that a conversation that happened? Because I know these things. I, I will say it was a conversation that happened, but I wasn't like, oh yeah, Maverick's definitely the Q1. No, no. It was, it was hard to say but But you did say it. Yeah. I said like, it's crazy now that, now that Cash used to be the Q1 and now I guess Maverick, like everybody likes Maverick now. Yeah. And then You said that or did you say like, no, that's what she said. She said That's crazy. No, Exactly what you said. You never welcome in my Healy game. Speaking, Speaking to your wife. She said that's crazy. Cash used to be the attractive one. Oh, that is just, Oh my God. Well, how, how, what would you do? That's just, that's just personal, you know? Well, That's very personal.


It's true. Like now you're this and then I talked to not true your own wife about how must you are and now she makes you shower. Did she agree? She's like, no, he's actually very clean, more than Maverick. And I was like, what? I was like, I was like, what? And what? Well, I got cash showering twice a day. So like, he has to be kind of clean. He's gotta shower twice a day. Sometimes three, sometimes middle of the night. Sometimes I take a shower before the podcast. I'm always sweaty from the day in a pool of sweat. Sometimes in his bed. He's gotta go shower in the middle of the night. Yeah. And you know what? I thought that was normal. And so I started talking to other guys and other guys were like, that doesn't happen to me. So, I don't know, maybe I have low iron like something. Yeah, But no, back to back to what I was saying about Hartford. She was like, is Maverick and Kinzie's first kiss gonna be at their wedding? And I was like, yep. And she was like, that's so weird.


Do they know how to kiss? Okay. With kissed other people. All right. That's I, you're gonna have to practice math. Alex, come here. No. Wait. What would you have done if somebody said no though? When you were asking people to be your bridesmaid? Well, I'd be a little sad. Oh. Oh, That Would be personal. I Guess I would have to pick somebody else. 'cause they weren't my true friend. If A dude said no, I'd be like, no, listen, you, I need this. Please just please. You have to. I know you don't Want to. You know what was crazy, my sister, she was like, did Matt ask you to be his best man yet? I Down, I was like, after Matt asked me to be his best man, just so excited. I was like, no, he did not ask me.


And she's like, we all the groomsmen need to do that dance Laney. Genuinely my sister's Laney. Oh my God. And then she genuinely, she was like, do you think he's gonna ask you to be his best man? I was like, obviously I'm his best man. And no, he doesn't have to ask me. That's not like a thing. He's got asked. Well, what a Maverick had in his head that he was gonna have a different friend as his best Man. That would be crazy. Insane. But can we, when we, after we kiss in the wedding, things like over when we walk down the aisle past everyone, can that be our outro song? Hot Dog? I, Kate, Kate Let Ours be SpongeBob. I did, did was actually my one request. I was like, when we, after we kiss and we walk out, can our walkout song or when we're leaving the ceremony SpongeBob, can it be at the base right now?


Zoom it on that face. And that, that was our song. It's the best I ever That was. And I literally, I argued it for weeks. But he did not do any, he didn't care about anything at the wedding. He did not have any say in anything. And he so truly, deeply wanted this to be his song. I think there's like a deeper meaning to the song to him that he just hasn't told me yet. It's just, it's the lyrics We had that it's the best Day ever. Did you not listen to the lyrics? Yeah. Our, our walkout song was to a sponge. Okay. Yeah. Well, you know what, our last dance or our first dance or whatever it was, our first dance was some song. I don't even know. Yellow. Oh no. Our Prime. Yeah. Yellow. It's all yellow. What? I remember your first dance song. It was All yellow. It was also It's All yellow.


Yellow. What's yellow? We don't know. Best Day Ever is ver everyone knows because the lyrics are true. Oh, so you're trying to connect everything. Yes. The lyrics are true to its meaning. It was a foreshadowing, honestly. Yeah. And yellow, what's that song about the sun? I don know the sponge. No, it was about, yeah, The SpongeBob. Yeah. No. Or it was The two were connected. Yeah, the two were connected. What were you gonna say is I Don doing nothing And our private jokes. No jokes On us up. No, no, no. Go on. The joke's not funny anymore. Why do you keep saying that? I'm a failure. My Do you not have funny jokes or are you gonna ask if, if we could talk to the manager? Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. So to ensure that I don't have SpongeBob playing at my wedding, I'm gonna need some help.

Nothing genuinely angers me more in life than when I say a joke and no that people are like, dude that wasn't funny.


Like what the freaking are you think? Yeah. That's Happened to me twice on this episode so far. It makes me mad when they're like almost insulted that you said. They're like, why would you even say that? And it's just like, yeah, I don tell about it. Said it was funny. Tell me about it. Yeah, we catch sometimes your jokes a little far.

You don't live here yet. You said once I live here, I was literally trying to look at the coloring on a video with Alex and we're on the computer going through it and cash is going through it with us. All of a sudden he turns around and he pulls his pants down and he's just trying backing his butt up to us. He, it's funny like dude I was at, No, I would simply jump out the window.


I keep Saying no. It's funny like you guys understand I was at LA Fitness all the time. Every time I go to LA Fitness bro, there's always an old man butt naked in the locker room. That's who naked. And every time I laugh I walk out there, I said butt this guy. Who that? The urinal. You knew that. It's just not funny. It's not. No, it is funny because, no, it's not five year olds when they're at the urinals. That's funny. Girls probably don't know this, but little like 5-year-old boys, they just pull their pants all the way to their ankles. They don't, they don't give a free, they just pee right there. Everybody's just like, okay. But I is missing the whole thing. Yeah. Like the hit in the urinal, this is the first time in my life I saw someone above the age of like six years old, pulled their pants all the way to their ankles to use the urinal.


And it was this old man, he was probably like 60 and his pants were all the way down at the ground. Oh my God. And he's using the urinal. I was like, yeah, go dude, you don't Do that. This was seems like something you do, Huh? Seems Like something you'd do. No, I don't do that. And the craziest part is there's a bunch of empty stalls he could have used. I was like, what? No, my little like Sorry, sorry. You go, you go. My little brother, When he was in T-Ball, they used to call Timeout and him and his friends would like run to the outfield and stand next to the fence and they would all just drop their pants and go to the Bathroom. Oh It was so cute though. It was just bunch little 5-year-old just run And they Just accepted that like the coaches, It was like a team. They were like, alright, timeout. The boys gotta Go.


And I just feel like there had to have been a bathroom that was probably closer than the back of the fence probably. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. No, the these old tiktoks, I'm looking through them. I'm like at Cash and Kate's house, they're like, I get secondhand embarrassment. Like what is this like The first time you ever came over? Yeah. And Like you were like Katie. Yeah.
