What, what's the title? That episode gonna be, I think it's Harper has a Mental Breakdown. Oh yeah. Something like that. I don't want My, has a mental Breakdown.


Not to put any shade on you. No. Hey, would you rather title that Harper has a Middle Breakdown or Harper Starts Crying Or Cash and Kate or trying to get pregnant? Well, the most views would probably be Cash. And Kate tries to get pregnant. Really? I feel like Harper has a middle breakdown. It gets more views. Do you think? I thought maybe like Harper was having withdrawals or something. Anyways, Anyways. Listen, the whole episode, you guys might have seen it by now. Probably came out like last time, whatever. Yeah. You know the one where she was like, I need cake. I need cake. Yeah. The one where she had a little moment because she's just a girl. Eyeball was like swollen the whole time. And no one here told me. And I walked downstairs. I don I don't even think her eyeball was swollen. I, I swear I can't see it. Like take it, take your thingy off. Nope, I'm not Doing that. Looks fine.


See, Maybe Fixed. No, look, look into the camera. It's fixed. Look at, look at me. No, look into the camera. Kate. Is it helping Ms. Potato head? So look into the camera.

He wants me to sit down like stretch my butt and you don't have all my weight. How want you sit right here? If I put all my weight here, you can't do it. If I, yeah, if I lay down across you but then you're not moving as much weight. Even though I don able To. I don't think my eyes look better, but I think I'm gonna stop for a minute.


Do it lay on camera. He lay On top of you. No, do it how you want. Okay. It might look very weird, but he looks like he's riding a horse. Oh. Can he get up?

If You mean why are you, why are you sitting on him like that? Yeah. Thank you. That's A crazy way to sit out so much. This is wild. Because I wanted to be max heaviness.


He can't push shoulder mobility. He can't do it. He can't even Move his shoulder. It's possible. Wait, Wait. Lemme try Scoot back a little. What are you, what are you doing?

Kate, what? You look so awkward. Gimme a second. Kate. Maverick knows if you sit right here, it stops their shoulder from moving. Trying to do it. Not, that's not what it does. It's just more weight at the top. And he even tried to grab me right here. So it stops my this for moving.


What if you sit right here, bro, your shoulder cannot go up. First off, if that's true, first off, thank you for giving me credit 'cause that's way smarter than I even knew I was. Okay. Yeah, I I know I did not think too far. I'm just thinking I need to put the max weight on your arms because if I put it across your whole body then it's not very heavy. But Matt, your shoulder has to have mo movement to do this. Just Put just this. Just lay on him and see what happens. Your shoulder. Okay, so let me ask you this. When you do bench press, how does that work? Oh, you bench, you're on the bench like this. Your shoulders are past the bench. Not if you are kinzie and I show bench press, it's fine. Yeah. See a girl just showed you up and bench pressing is different than a pushup. No, it's pushup. What do you mean it's completely different?


No, it's not completely different. If you can't do it, then I'm gonna smack this on your face. That is fan art And okay. Alright. But seriously, lemme see if I knew both of you at the same time. Laying down. You can Do Maverick. Yeah, That's what I'm saying. No, like the normal human way. Listen, it's way easier if somebody lays down. That's what he wants to Try.
