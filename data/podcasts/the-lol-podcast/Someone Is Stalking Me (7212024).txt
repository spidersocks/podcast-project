Maybe That's what was smelling yesterday. No, that's what I smell it right now. It's like the burnt vacuum smell. I don't really know why it does that, but it just smell. I smell Harper or What? The Shama Wait. Yeah. That was weird. Why did you fly like that Pro really quick? Like a Ninja Harper. How was your day? I mean? It just started. It's literally one. So gimme the walkthrough. What your day starts out One. What time do you wake Up? I mean like two usually.


But I wake Up early. So you woke up early this morning, you're No, actually At one o'clock in the afternoon. Actually. I literally went live. I'm always going live on YouTube. Yeah. Harper, why do you always go live for like 35 seconds? Like Yeah, I know. It's so much fun. It says you're live and then I click it and then you're already ended. It's just so much fun. Like, I love going live and like I. think it's so cool that like 3000 people are watching me at a time. Like, you know, it's like cool, like Whoa So. what? Yeah. But why do you only go live for like 30 seconds? I don't, Because then the viewers start to leave 'cause the notification's not there. So she doesn't want it to look like she doesn't know that many people on her live. Yeah, That's actually exactly what now, because you know how People accidentally join a live stream from the notification. Mm. You know I It swipes down and you try to swipe up and then you actually join the live stream. So then the view count goes up.


Oh, Yeah. I know on Instagram live, the only good part is like the first like two minutes. 'cause then after that everyone leaves. Yeah. Imagine if TikTok sent notifications out to all your followers that you live like millions of people. That'd be clutch. Oh, man. Your TikTok live could be huge. Dude, I wish I could go live on TikTok. Yeah, but you can't too little. Wait, can you go live when you're 16? Yes. I mean you have to Be 16 probably. Cow. You can, they'll freaking ban me. So you Can go live next year. Because what's it called? Anna McNulty. She's 20 something and she got banned for, for being underage. 13, 22 Years old. She's like 22. and they got banned because they thought she's 13. She's not 13. She's 22. Yeah. TikTok Is kind of messed up. They don't know what they're doing half the time. Like even if like, it's just so annoying.


Like don't assume how old I am. It's not not cool. and I know. It may seem like I'm a small being, but I I am not. And well, I Hate that you do that so easily. Like it's just like a part of your vocabulary. Now. Wait, actually don don't know. don don't know why I do that a lot. Like does it, does it feel like I'm looking at you, but I'm actually looking to the side? No, it looks like you're looking to the side. Did you get scared when I was doing that? No. I can, But no, sorry. Anyways, what About this That, that you just look weird, but no. What's it called? Like my day started off. I went, I went, I went to bed at like, like Your day.

You do Me and Matthew and you do. What if we just brought all three of the sisters on at the exact same time? I don know if they'd know how to act or like Not. That'd be an odd bunch. Not That they don't know how to act, don don't know that. They'd know how we, how to handle, how we act. Wait, what's the thumbnail for this episode? All of our sisters are very, very like normal. Yeah. What Though? What are we I can Ask my sister to come on right now. Obnoxious. I think there's not a lot of people that could come sit on this podcast with us and enjoy themselves. You know how people, Why you consulting our own podcast? I'm so confused. Like where you're going with this. Yeah. She's like, there's just not a lot of people that could stand us.


Like our podcast is just so annoying. Honestly. We're just so bad. Our sisters are normal people. But we're okay, but we're, we're not normal. We're weird You guys. Have you guys ever seen the babies that have air tags wrapped around their ankles? Yeah. It's so cute. Yeah. Harper, would you please go back and try to explain to me how you were eating healthy? Oh yes. First of all, let's, I do agree with some of the people. They say like, this is brain rot or whatever. Brain rot. At least Our podcast. Sometimes I see clips of us and people are like, brain, brain rot. And I'm like, brain like, yeah, that's facts. Brain rat and I. Like, what is brain rot? Did you like Did, Y, allall? Look at the clips of us from the inside out episode and just think, what is wrong with those people?


Like what are, what are they doing? These people are, these people are like, have their lives and we're just dressing up as inside out characters. I know someone commented on our inside out episode, the bills can't be that low. I was like, The bills can't be that low. I don't get No, the bills can't be that high. Oh. Oh that makes sense. Yeah. I was pretty confused. I was like, the bills can't be that low. The bills can't be that high. When we were dressed up, like What characters should we dress up as next? Yeah. What themed episodes should we do? I said we should have a slumber party episode where we all just sleep. Yes. What? That is the most Kate episode ever. We all just dress in our pajamas and come sleep for 45 minutes. You know what's weird? If, if we all slept for 45 minutes, I feel like that episode would lowkey get views.


We should do it for the hundredth episode. A 24 hour episode. Yo Lowkey. Yeah guys, the hundredth, our 100th episode is coming up. But, we don't know what to do for you. No Idea. I'm up it, I'm up for doing a 24 hour live stream. 24 hour video. I don't know if I can do 24 hours, Man. Oh yes you can on this set. No one's getting up for 24 hours. 24 hours. Hours. Harper is not up for porta potty right there. No, you would not. You are not up for 24 hours. Oh, Harper's totally up for 24 hours. But no, but like we can take naps and stuff, right? We can take shifts probably. Oh, I'm gonna wait like, well, yeah. What do we gotta do? Do We have to talk for 24 hours? There's no way we can talk for 24 hours. How about I mean there's a chance If you fall asleep, you are out. You're out. Oh, that sounds miserable. And if you stay minimum 12 hours of sleep a night, the person who stays on or awake the longest wins the channel.


Wins the, the play button or something. Wait, Actually, 'cause I had to buy my own play button for this channel. $400 outta my own bank account. Not everything's free. However, It costed a lot of money. I think we bought your play button. No, no, no, no. She bought it. But. we bought ours. No, she bought her own. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody had for play button. Their Own own. I thought we paid for like half her play button or so. No, No, No. I bought my own. Yeah, she Bought it. Really? Yeah. Doesn't everybody gotta play for their play buttons? Do we not pay for our play buttons? No. I thought we paid for our play button. No. 'cause if you, if you own the channel, then you get it for free. Like I got my Oh, Oh. If you want an extra play button, you gotta pay for it. Yeah. Yes, yes. Oh, so, so I paid for my extra play button.


But now it was semi true. So we should really pay you back or something. Like at least half that. It's Fine's. Crazy. It's, I, my mom was just like, oh, Yeah, let's, let's buy it Harper. and I was like, its, it's a little expensive. Like let's, let's go down. Shut Up. Harper's Never seen Sephora. Shut up. Hey, I let her, she's trying to be savings. Let her I, this girl walking with Golden Gooses Harper Harper like so casually can drop like 400 at Sephora. Whoa. Whoa Whoa. That's a lot of talk coming from you sweetheart. I don't drop that much. Yeah, I see. I see our credit card bill also casually. You don't know this girl. No. You ain't been to Sephora with her. I Seen her. I'm in her whole private story. Did you watch by Sephora Hall? Obviously Sephora. Did you And it was like that.


I haven't been to Sephora in two, two months. So it was like the first time like I had to like she Had to take a two month break. That's how much she spent. I did what I used to spend a lot Of money. Well, wait, wait, hold on. I gotta ask this question E. Each one of you Kate, what's the most money you've ever spent in one Sephora trip? I'm gonna be honest, I don't shop at Sephora. Okay. As much I do. Ulta. Okay. Ulta. Yeah. What's the most you've spent in one Ulta trip? Hmm. Probably like when I bought my shark, the hair tool I use all the time, it's 300. But I got it for half off 'cause I used my points. So That was one 50. And then probably just whatever hair products I needed that day. So I'd say probably like, oh Yeah. I would say 200 to two 50.


You know, that's actually not as expensive as I. Guess thought it was gonna be. Guess what? Kenzie When she was like, I need to stop at Alta real quick to get my shampoo.

plan. Yeah, It might been 50 50 or 75. 75 each bottle. 75 is absolutely absurd. I said if you're walking $10 an hour, it was redkin. I think if you're working for $10 an hour, sounds about right. $75. You gotta work for almost eight hours to buy one shampoo bottle. I said what? She goes, you don't understand. I haven't had this in like a month. I've been out And. I just, it's my hair. Like it has to have it. Has she ever heard of Walmart or just like not? That's a big talk Coming from this guy because when I, when I was, my hair was dead. Listen, when my hair was dead I asked, I asked my hairstylist, I said, what do I need to do to get it healthy? And she said, this shampoo and I said, okay. So I bought it and then I kept buying cash to like Walmart shampoo. 'cause I assumed he didn't wanna use the expensive one.


'cause that just means We have to buy it more. And then one day I was like, hun, you're not using this shampoo, you're using the expensive one. And he was like, well I have to, I have color treated hair as well. You know, that I had to use the expensive shampoo too. Whoa Whoa. I didn't say it with that much sass. Whatcha you talking about? Yes. So he uses the expensive shampoo too. Whatcha talking About I? did not say it with that much sass. Willis. Willis. Willis. Who's Willis? You never heard Willis before? Like, calm down Willis. No. Wait, what's the, what's the same? But what you talking about Willis? What you talking about Willis? Yeah. I had never heard that, but I You never Heard what you're talking about Willis? I'm not Willis. Okay. Well I I didn't say it that much. Seas sea. Okay. Well maybe he was like, I have color treated hair. I have to use it too. Yeah, it Was more like that With more swag to it when he is talking about his Pureology shampoo.


Alright, Harper, what is the most you've ever spent in one Sephora trip? Okay, guess because it's actually, She told me one time she transferred 500 when she knew she was going shopping over To my account. Yeah. She said she transferred 500 from her. Five. Not just hundred, Not just for Sephora. A few days ago I transferred a thousand. oh my Gosh. You got double. But, but, but, but I, to be fair, I was running out of my own, like spending money. Okay. You need to clarify. All of your money is in like a savings. And when you wanna spend money, you transfer money out of the savings until like your spending. How do you know, how do you know about her financials like that? Because I've talked to her About before. She's talked me. And now I have three accounts, which is one for my business. YouTube video. So goes subscribe.


I spend some money on my videos and then I have a checking account where I spend my money and then a savings account where I save all my money for future plans, whatever. I don't really know. And so outta my checking account or out of my business account, I added a thousand dollars into my spending account. And at Sephora I spent, it was, it was around like, I'm pretty sure I I got it on video, but I'm so scared for this number right now. I'm gonna get six 50. I was say, oh, if it's above 500, that's absurd. I Was gonna say 800. 800. Oh my goodness. I don Dunno. Harper, how much did you spend? 1,400. No Kidding. I'm getting, I'm kidding.


I spent 300, like three 50 Still's. Stupid. Horrible. Still, still. Just spin that Sephora. It's stupid. but like it, I also have been very, working very hard at my stuff. Okay. Like I, I, you know, I do some brand deals here and there. and I try really hard. Hey, Word of advice as influencers, we can't say the word working hard 'cause no one believes we get bullied on that. Dude, I do work hard. I No one will you will ever believe you Instagram reel conference. You're about to go crazy. I Watched both of these boys. Yeah. Wake up at 8:00 AM and then go to bed at freaking 11. And all day they're on phone calls and stuff, just figuring stuff out for the week. Exactly. But you can't ever say that because no one would ever believe that you work hard as an influencer. Like, But I'll say, I'll say compared to other jobs, I know we're getting cooked up right now.


Stop talking. I'll Say an influencer is the easiest job to have in the entire World. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, I It just went from, they work. so we work so hard to easy work Hard at your easy job. No, no, no. That is rephrased. If you are a pretty girl and you just take Instagram photos, sure you can have an easy job. Yeah, that is true. You, but if you, you're past, you have to work really hard to make a penny. Okay. No. Like, It will be hard if you ain't got a pretty face like me. You gonna have to work real hard. Every subscriber counts. Every subscriber. My GoFundMe is in the link in the description guys. It's low-key. A hard job. Like, I'm not even kidding.


Especially like, It's not physically demanding. No, not Like physically demanding, but like, like get getting home from school and then going straight to, I would say, I would Say it's more especially the, because I don't know about the other 15-year-old influencers, but I do see, like, you wake up and go to school all day and then you have to come here right after school. Well, actually most here's what I wanna say because it's so hard before everybody goes off. What I saw online about influencing being a hard job, I would say being an influencer, very easy. oh, Yeah very, very, very easy. I would say being like a content creator, like a YouTuber or something like Mr. Beast. Oh, That's very hard. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Preston plays Ben Alar is like, stuff like that. Brent Rivera. I would say that like, making YouTube videos is is more completely separate from being like a TikTok influencer girl or something.


Yeah, that's that's true. Like the TikTok influencer people that I know that is like, make a TikTok and like go to Hawaii versus like the people that because you were that time drop like weekly. Yeah. Versus the people that drop like weekly YouTube videos or like hundred, hundreds Of thousand bucks each Video's easiest job in the world. Yeah. But still there's also a huge just difference. Like, yeah, this person, like, they may make okay money, but this person works really hard. Like the YouTubers work really hard, but everybody knows some of these YouTubers are like super rich. Yeah. Awesome. But I'm still not gonna say Super Lucas. It's not a very, a very job. We love our job. It's very easy, but yeah. Yeah. We don't, it's a huge blessing. We definitely don't worry work like as physically hard as like, you know, A roofer or something. It's really, it really is a blessing to be able to do a job that you love so much. But there is work that goes into it when you're not just posting tiktoks.


Like when you're trying to like, like we, like we put a lot of work into the podcast trying to grow it and the LOL club channel, a lot of work goes into those videos. There's a lot of planning and just like things that, like no one would ever think that happened and stuff. So yeah. But, we love doing it, but it definitely, like, and being an influencer is just, And there's yeah, there's like influencers on TikTok that just like wake up every morning and post like one TikTok.

That those looked far away. don don't think It was in that window. I know. Downstairs Window. Yeah. One of 'em in the window. That's Freaking Weird. But. we don't have a camera there. Well, y'all will see me on the camera every time I come here. I make a weird face. But every single time I've never not made a weird face on the camera. Really? I'm, I'm so for real. Never. That's so funny. Not one time. Every time I've came over to your House, I've always make one.


Do We have all that footage? We might, if We have all that footage need make, make a talk of that. That'd be so freaking hilarious. Yeah. Every time. I'm, But that's not, that's not hilarious. That's, that's concerning. That's very Concerning. Is that real? Do you think it's real? Frankie? Yeah. I'm What do you mean? Is it real? don Don't know. Is it real? No, it's fake images. They're drawings. That's weird though. That's, I'm saying. Wait, you did this. No I didn't. Yeah, She did. She brought it in. No, I did it. It was on the pos. You can check the cameras on my life. You did bring it in. Look, I did bring it in. But I swear on my life, I did not do that. I would not take secret photos of them getting in their cars and stuff. You, you promise. This is not a prank On my life. Like I will swear on everything on my mom's grave. Well, she's not dead, but like on everything.

I did not do it. I did not do it. I swear If your fingerprints are on those, They're obviously from all the photos, They're on the synthetic coincidence. I swear I didn't do it though. I like, I I would actually tell the truth because I know y'all are calling the police after this. I'm like, I'm, I'm being so real. I did not do it. Well I don't really know if we're, I don don't know if we should restart or what we should do, but No, it's fine. I think this is a good episode. We should probably Restart. Yeah. But what what we're saying is like, what if it's not like a little like 11-year-old kid?


Like what if it's like a grown adult? Do you see the riding on the package I mean? Yeah, but That's, that's a 5-year-old. Lemme see open to anybody. Head kiss. Yeah. It does look like a five year old's handwriting. That looks really bad. There's no way a grown man wrote that you're Writing. Yeah. That's impossible for a grown man To have wrote that. That looks like my handwriting right now. Look at this. Oh, like what is that? Okay, we get it guys. We get it. We get it. Like there's no way. And even if it was a grown Man, yeah, we get it. We get it Harper. We get it. Wait, no, continue. Even if it wasn't, Even if it was a grown man, y'all are safe. Their their passcode to the door is 1, 2, 3. I'm kidding. Well, changing the passcode now.


Well, yeah. This might would be a good time to say to Frank. I did that. You're kidding, right? I Wrote on it and you just insulted my writing. What? So a grown man did write that. Yes, I wrote that. Why would you do that? And I staged the pictures of me and I. I see you really took pictures of you and I. Sorry, I felt like a little bit of a weirdo. No, This why It was fine. And then Yeah, That was a screenshot from the TikTok. TikTok, yeah. From the TikTok. Which I was hoping you wouldn't notice. Yeah. Yeah. What about Mavericks?


Oh, we took em earlier. Yeah. Matt wasn't honest, but it was pretty funny watching you guys just go in on his handwriting. Yeah. I was not expecting that. Yeah. Also, wow. Also, I was expecting you guys to be more scared. Well, I scared was out. You were not scared at all. It's because it was, and you were so chill. You didn't acted like you didn't care. Well, Because I have house protection. She got a Pew PI Got multiple. Oh. But anyways. And if someone, if any of you freaking grown men try to come in my house, you're getting led in your head. What? The what? What the, okay. The podcast I don't play.


I literally, new ad is crazy. If someone tried literally some grown pervert, some stalker person. If you come on my property. Oh no, it's over for you. Game over You Don You don have the restart button 'cause it's over for you. What the No I mean so serious because I know I'm being so serious. I don't think she could hit you if you were more than 20 feet away. I, I think she would miss every shot. So are you kidding? Ask your dad. You're certainly not hitting their Head. Ask your dad. Your dad gave me shooting lessons. Oh, Did he? No. I, I gave you shooting lessons But your dad taught me better. Oh, Oh man. Your dad said your dad because you had me just standing in practicing. He said Kate, if someone's coming at you, you're not gonna stand there. You're gonna run backwards.


So practice running backwards. You the backwards with a gun. Yeah, I did. You never ran backwards. Yes I did. I'm picturing Kate with the gun like sideways. I'm running back. She's Just Missing every shot. Listen, when you have a lot of people on social media that follow you and you also live with people who don't care about blasting your address on the internet. Because we got an email today. Actually. Someone literally emailed us today and said, Hey, dunno if you noticed this, your address was put out in the most recent video. Here's your address, blah, blah blah. Just didn't know if you knew this. It was in this video at this timestamp. Just wanted to let you know in case you didn't know. Was that what video Ashley? It was that. But now say the video.


I'm not Saying the video, but yes. Our address was put out and I tell them all the freaking time. I say, boys, stop filming where our address is seen And it. It's fine. It Wasn't me. It's wasn't me. Someone's gonna see it wasn't, It wasn't me though. I say all the time and someone, someone literally emailed me this morning and said it, but Was it me? What Did I leak the address? Oh, Y'all always do. Y'all don't care. Tell y'all all the time. Always do. I'm not gonna lie, ma, one time you were filming in your Tesla And, it literally said our address on the screen. Kate was like, what the heck? And then y'all Got mad at us because they always like, they get mad because like Maverick was like showing his Tesla screen and the maps was right on our house. Our little emoji was right where our house was. Our address was fully seen and I was like, yeah, but It wasn't, our address was fully seen. It was just we, you could see the bap I've done one time been like the address wasn't put in like When the permit.


But it's just, I like, I maybe it's just 'cause I'm a woman and I pay attention to things like that. But I know that there are creepy people that watch. Not not, not the fans, but there are grown adult creepy people that wanna come hurt us. No. And I'm not gonna let that happen. No they don't. That's in your head. No, it's it's not in my head though. Okay. Someone's been walking watching too much. Jeffrey. Jeffrey, why would we wanna hurt you? Because We have millions of followers. That doesn't mean you want, okay. Do you wanna hurt Logan Paul? No, but there are people do that Messed up heads Fred Rivera. I Don't. But there are people that do because there're not right in the head. People don't wanna hurt people just 'cause they have followers. Yes they do. Yes. Especially Girls. Why influencers not just getting marked every day? Heard confused.


Never heard of. I've never heard of an influencer. Die jury. Certainly not. Because, not because they had followers. It was because of something they did. What I've never heard of. What about Ava Maj Shotgun gonna kill her? Ava Maj, I don't know too much about it. Was it the, but I know she was originally like texting with the guy and stuff like that. It wasn't like the guy That was, was randomly some random stranger that she's never texted before. Showed up at the house. I don't think so. I know she texted. Was It the, you're telling me there aren't people in this world that are so messed up, they would not come? No, no, No. There's always a chance. There's people like Jeffrey er that just randomly killed people for fun. But don don't think your chances are really increased much. Just 'cause you have followers of getting murt. It's pretty, It's Pretty increased. Maybe robbed or something like that. Sure. I don't wanna get robbed either.


Yeah. What like robbing was fun. They might like myself get robbed. They might be like, oh, I know they fell with their house. All this nice camera equipment. They keep it upstairs. No, but if someone comes into my house and shooting, It's like right by the front door. So, they can come up. If someone came into my house, You're telling me that if someone came into our house to try to rob us, y'all aren't gonna try to stalk them? Honestly, I'd probably just let 'em have whatever they wanted. What the frick? No. No. I wouldn't. The business paid for it? Not me. No. But guys like, actually no, I don't care. Like for some reason if somebody was robbing me, I will die. What? Just, just to get my for a camera. Just to get my thing thing back. What? It's the principle of the matter. Okay. Don't rob me. It really is. Don't rob me.


No. What's it, what's it called? If I, oh, in my recent TikTok I said for 5 million I'll give away my queen beat tracksuit. And for 5 million. Why not like 50 bucks? For $5 million?

That's a bad idea. No, wait. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. No, go ahead. Math. You Say I man. No, that's, well, how funny it was. I was thinking what if we just did it somewhere like, like we did it like somewhere dope. That's not here. Target. Maybe it's not Target. Like something like that. Yeah. Like something that's not, or like on a beach, we just do a different location. Yeah. We shoot it. Like, that's kind of lame. No, it's not. I think it's a lot better. Like No, we tell people we're doing it, And it and they it's live and they can come. Yes, they can come like be in the background shots. Say live or live. Live person. Like in person. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a, a great idea. Like actually though, like, I think we should go, Like, imagine people are just coming up and we're like, oh, Yeah, we're shooting the 100th episode. Yeah. Yeah.


No, that would be so cool. I think that's the best idea. Like actually where, where, Where would you like to do this episode? Math Costa Rica. There's a pasture out here. We do it in a pasture. A pasture. What if we shot it in Costa Rica? I mean? No, I was, I was thinking like the shops, like, you know, the shops of our, that'd Be cool. You'd have to get permission. Oh, actually they kick us out. Wait, somebody say a funny joke, please. I've been waiting for somebody to say a funny joke on the podcast and I just haven't heard one. What about, did somebody say one right now? Yeah. You want a funny joke right now? YI like one I mean right now. I mean. Yeah, if You don't have one, that's fine. but like, I can say one. But do you want it now or like, just on the podcast or No? I mean I. Guess now it works well, like right now. I mean I think he wants it right now. Yeah. Which lemme see I mean.


Yeah, right now it'd be good for a funny joke. Like, so you'd like me to say it in the podcast now? Yes, probably like now it could be different things, probably like this very moment now type of thing. You know what I'm saying? Okay. The moment that she passed, no, I see where that could be confusing. And I. See where you're like, well, the moment that you said the moment or the moment we're in now, because the moment we're in now is not the moment I said that in. Yeah.
