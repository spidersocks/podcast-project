You are leaving I mean, what's it called? I still need my cut, but I But are y'all joking or not? Like, are y'all actually I mean? Y'all would tell me before, right? Or are y'all telling me here I mean like, it's chill. Like it's a couple's podcast. God, it's so cute. Well, you know, yeah. It's just like two couples on like, what, what place are you gonna have I mean?


I'll have Cassius spot now. I'm, I'll be the funny one because you, you have, you have a wife and he has a wife and I'll just be the one in the middle who's like the main character. Right? Well, well our idea was this podcast Kenzie since just because you have school and a lot of things that, like, we, it'd be easier to shoot with just I mean we need four to shoot. But it'd be easier to shoot with just us four. And then we could start like a, like a like kind of like a branch off one that like, when you can shoot, you know what I mean? I mean. Yeah, but what, wait, actually, like what, what I Get if if I mean don don't know. I just feel like, do you like the podcast? Yes. Wait, are y'all actually serious?


I'm, I'm actually gonna cry. No, we're Kidding. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's joke. that is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. She's about to cry. Don't cry, don't cry. No, I'm not. I'm not. She scared me. No, I actually started getting scared. I was like, wait, Don't, don't cry. Don't cry. She Scared me. I Was like, no, no, don't cry. I can give her a hug or something. Do something. I was so scared. No, You're never getting Kicked up. Look at him. This chair is so Smash. You're never getting kicked Off the house. No. That would never happen. It would never happen. Aw. It would never happen. Good. No, because if y'all kicked me off, I would make make some bad videos. She'd be like exposing cash.


Maverick and Kate behind the scenes. No, no. Ashley what? Did. Y. She'd make it quiet on set. We never No, no, no. Harper. We would never kick you off podcast. The only time podcast you'd be off the podcast is if you left. If I left. No, it'd be very quiet on set without you here. I'm not gonna lie. Yeah. Like No, you were, if you leave the podcast, we're gonna be sad. We can't kick you off. Yeah. But if we could kick you off, we Would. No, Let's Be So for real, if someone's leaving the podcast, it's me and I think we Why do you think that? I just know it. Please Don't leave. she didn say it's not, she just said, please don't leave. She didn't reinsure that It wouldn't be you. I know. That's Crazy. Said No, please don't. If Somebody wants to, like, if somebody was to lead the podcast, it would be me.


What? No. No. I'll Type one for the team. Okay. The only Reason you I see, I'll say it here. To me, I think the strongest placements are me and Harper. I don't think me and Harper are ever gonna miss an episode. What? Hopefully you think. I think I'm most likely to miss an episode. Think Kate's most likely to miss an episode. I think MA's second most likely to miss an episode. I Agree. I agree. And I think she, I think Harper Harper is third most likely to miss an episode. Just because I'm just talking about missing one episode. Like, what's Harper? Just because I feel like Harper's gonna be like, oh, I'm on vacation for three weeks and we're gonna be like fricking on someone. I feel like I'm so unlikely to miss an episode. You No, You pretty are. I think you are So, so Kenzie. So Kenzie has the only Reason on The pod. She'll probably be on like maybe 50% of the episodes or a lot. I don't know. Whatever she wants.


You. don, Are we gonna get an extra chair or is she gonna send you? No. Okay. I wanted to talk to y'all about that. So can We get an extra Chair? so we, we recently posted an episode where we were like, do you guys wanna keep Kenzie or Kick Kenzie? You know, And, it was kind of a joke where always Oh, everyone was like, keep Kenzie. Yeah. Everyone said keep Kinzie. Which is amazing. I Just feel like if we, if Kinzie's on when We have guests on, I feel like there's So many people. No, no. The issue is that I think that the audience loves the dynamic that this blue couch has with them two. Yeah. And they're like, I was reading comments. I mean we were You can't break up the blue couch. I'll be fine to leave it. No, no, no. We can just give Kinzie like a yoga mat desk or something. No, I think Maverick would've to sit in the middle. Mm. No, I I think we would just get a different, a different Layout. I think We have to rearrange the setup a Little. Yeah. No, I I I'll definitely be fine taking another chair.


Getting away from Him. Does Kenzie want to be on all the episodes or does she just wanna come and go? Or what if what if or if she fine. Whatever she has. She has No preference. Kenzie had like a little couch too and like, we shared a couch. I feel like that would make more sense. That would low key. Yeah. But the you two over there in the middle and like how it is right now. Yeah. You in the middle and them two on the couch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like that'd make a lot more sense because I really would hate to break up the blue couch. 'cause everyone loves y'all's beef. No, I, but anyways, y'all Can't stand each other. And. it just brings life to the podcast. Yeah. Like they're sitting on the farthest side of the couch and they're like trying, They lowkey just wanna box each other. Oh. But by the way, when we were whispering before the epi episode started, what? That's what we were whispering about boxing. No, no pranking that we were debating. Should we tell her we were gonna like, do a prank? Not tell her what it's not, but let her know she's gonna have a prank pulled on her.


Yeah. Well the prank So she's not like, broke, Broken. The prank wasn't funny. I'm kidding. No. Well, what's it called? Like Harper? You gotta do a prank to us. I I've done pranks to us. She has, I'm thinking she's like live on the pod. Like, where's Gerald? Okay. Well yeah, she just killed Gerald's. Really? A prank. Prank. I'm prank about, I'm Just like, look, he's dead. No, I'm trying. There was no, just kidding. I'm, That never happened. I'm Genuinely trying to think of like, what's it called a prank to do. but like I, I am scared. I can Help you. Yeah. But I'm gonna prank you. Maybe you should do this. What like maybe like, maybe like six months from now you should prank us that you are gonna voluntarily leave and you're gonna be like, guys like I think I'm like, oh My gosh, if I did that, we're Gonna forget this too.


She's gonna come back in six months and actually do it and we're gonna be like two Or, or like two years from now. No, but Because what if I go off like, like not off camera. What if I'm like, Hey guys, I'm gonna leave. Like, I'm sorry. Like I can't do it. Yeah, you should like tell Alex to record from like over there secretly off camera. Like set. And then when you're like a senior in high school, you should say you're gonna like leave for college. Oh. And we will wholeheartedly believe it because we're gonna forget about this. And honestly, I not, so I'm gonna leave for college 'cause I'm not doing college. That'd Be so sad. I feel like every week you change your mind. Yeah, I know because I do, I do wanna party and stuff in college. What that but Like No, no. That's like why you shouldn't go to college. No. That's not at all the reason for college. Yeah. And believe it or not, there's parties outside of college. Wait, math. So Who do you think is the second most likely to miss an episode?


Just miss one episode. Okay. Well I thought the whole order was crazy. I would say most likely to miss an episode. Is this one really? Yeah. Most likely to have something going on and We have to shoot. oh, Yeah True. No, I, I agree with that, but I think we would all be like, we can't shoot without Harper. Think. Well, The only way that would happen is if like there's a guest. Something happens. Like we're, we're not like, like generally right now, guys like We have like two, like we're shot up to like a month ahead on podcast. but like if we were down to like one week and then something happened where like Harper got sick or like a family member she had to go visit or something. Like it was like passing away or something. Yeah. And then Harper was like gone. We might would have to like just be like, Frick, we're gonna miss an upload date if we don't film. Yeah. So that could happen.


But also I could see Kate being pregnant or having kids and being like, listen, I have a thing the kids can't miss. Or I'm in labor or No. I can try to, I'm in labor. Y'all are all gonna stay here and film though. My husband, my Husband misses the birth of our first child to fill a podcast. Kate's not here today because she's having a baby at the hospital. So, Oh. In our, I'm here though for you guys. Let's get this episode started. What if we just had let her have the baby here On camera. On camera Be on camera. Yeah, That would be an episode. That was push. She's Like, she's in labor for like 20 hours. Don don't wanna quit the podcast when I have a baby.


I really don't, but me Neither. I I'm being so for real guys, when We have a baby. Yeah. Well a we'll probably have to have a babysitter slash nanny on set. Yeah. Just so if the baby is crying that we can like hand it off for like the hour and she can like go tell not to cry. Stop her not to cry. But I think a great thing would be to get a little baby carrier right here and it's sitting in between us. oh, Yeah, what do y'all think? Or, or we just let it crawl around Or y'all can put me in the carrier and act like I'm the baby right here. Or we just fence this area in and we just let the baby crawl around and do whatever it wants while we record fence The baby in I. think it depends. I would, I think if, if the audience were to like that, but if people were like, get the baby off set, we'd probably be like, okay, Yeah The baby would like this chair.


Do a back tuck off of it. I'm not doing a back tuck off of it. Try it. You do a back tuck off of it. Okay. Harper can do a back top off it. Kind of impressive. Look, I'll do it, I'll do it. and I will impress all of y'all. I will Oh. wait, you can actually do it. Yeah, she can. Did she do it the other day? Yeah, she Did Y. Y'all be impressed. I was actually pretty impressed when she didn. I was like, there's no way you can do a back flip off that. Wait, hold on. Also, you gotta stop calling it a back tuck. You gotta call it a back flip. Sounds way cooler. Hold on, Let me just stretch out a little Bit. Guys, I'm so scared. Please Be careful. Some odd stretching. Hey, she just woke up in the morning. Oh. wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. We Do first. What do you need?
