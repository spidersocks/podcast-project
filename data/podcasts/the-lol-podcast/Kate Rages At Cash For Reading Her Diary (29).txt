Honey has thrown up three days in a row every single morning. My Poor baby. Yeah, she has tummy issues. You know what's so bad is I told, I told Kenzie this, but the other day when Ka and I woke up, I went to go let her out and I let her outside and then I was putting her in her little kennel in the living room so we could go to the gym and there was like throw up all over the carpet over there and it had been there all night because I, that Carpet is so done for that. Somehow we don't have Steaks in that white carpet. Put like that was like, that was like some dirty throw up and I got the stains out.


Why is that? Freaking, They don't even care about Honey's wellbeing. Honey is almost an a senior dog and she's throwing up often. Does that not concern anybody else?
