Be more you this year and find them on Bumble


In the best Man speech. I kissed Kenzie's grandma. And then when I brought up the joke about my mom and dad, man, that part might've ruined the wedding. That actually might've ruined the wedding. Wait, did I ruin the wedding? Yo, what's up guys? Welcome back to another episode. Absolutely. Nobody's ready for this episode. Kinzie is editing a TikTok. Kate is eating a freaking sandwich that she just lost her nail in. How? How's your sandwich? I wish I Could knit right now. It's Okay. But I literally guys, my fingernail fell off somewhere and I don't know where it is. And it's in my sandwich. That's, I don. Why are you still eating it? That's just like hor. And I also, since I'm on the diet, I can't eat a bun, so I'm literally just holding a chicken breast lettuce and bacon in my hand.


Well darling, you're just nailing it. Said she said bread. That's what I was gonna say. I said breast. You said I'm just holding a chicken breast well in my hand. It's got a crazy chicken booby. Ooh, dude. I need do chickens have those? I'm confused where that at? Yeah, because apparently they have lots of breasts, but I ain't never seen a chicken breast breast. Two breasts. 'cause one time I had a whole chicken breast, but that means I had two chickens. What The heck is the breast on a chicken man? Like I ain't never seen a chicken walking around with like movies. It's, I think it's like they're like shoulders to their like achilles. Okay. Im not even, oh, so it's just their whole body, man. I'm not joking. I like, like being so serious off camera. I do not know where my nail is in this sandwich.


Why do we say that off camera? Because like sometimes we're like, like we're, we're still on camera. Like we're so over dramatic kids sometimes, but like in real life and like all realness, my nail is somewhere And I don't know where it is. But this is also real life. We're living in the fruit future. We're living in the future right now. We waited like five minutes to start. Do you ever, when you watch the podcast back, you're like, Ew, why did I say that? Yes. Why did I make that face? Yeah, you two probably think about that. I figured you did that a lot. Yeah. What? Yeah. So I figured you would do that a lot because you do this. I'm just a baby. I'm a man. No, I, I self-reflect sometimes, but not like that. Okay. I'm not a baby. I don't think I've ever watched the podcast back and been like, man, I should not have said or done that.


Really? So what? Right. A couple episodes ago, I actually may not be a couple episodes ago, but this episode went out the other day and we had to cut like 15 minutes of it because you kept doing things that were inappropriate. I never saw it. I never saw it. So therefore I've never watched myself and been like, I've never seen a clip on TikTok and been like, oh, why did I do that? I know I'm gonna be regretting this. Like I'm literally absolutely demolishing a Chick-fil-A chicken breast and bacon and lettuce. But you're eating lettuce demurely, lettuce Okay's, demolishing. No, I'm not. It is very demure. Those are not, well not the part where you lost your nail, but everything else. Oh no. Right next to the ranch. Oh, that's kind of disgusting. Like I'm kind freaked out by that $15 if you eat it. Her nail. Yeah. Oh. Oh.


It's got chicken juice on it so it taste like 15. I Okay that It just put in your mouth. You have to eat the nail. Please do this. I'll be thinking about it. You want some ranch on it? Disgust? No I don't. If you put ranch on it, I'm not gonna eat it. Okay. This episode, I'm got you looking at it. It stuck to the finger. Oh, there's like old nail like plaque that was in between her fingernails and her nail on You. Would you rather eat this? Look At she really gave you left to chew on there. There's really like ear wax stuff In there. Would you rather eat ear wax? Look, look, look in between my nails. Would you? It's black Harper and Harper's Nose are black Harper. Like she dug through some dog poop or something on that thing. It's paint. It's paint guys. Her pooping scooping business is still active. Sorry. Wait. You don't Do that by the way.

The love letter? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay.


That is the opposite of what I was gonna talk about. But I guess we can talk about that first. So probably about a year and a half ago. Cash. I mean if we're gonna glaze me, we can talk about this all day. Cash was, oh, so sweet. And I woke up. He had gone somewhere early that morning. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Really? Yeah, from reading the letter. It's that bad. Do you need grape Juice? No, it's fine. I'm okay. Don't do that. I think that would make me actually throw up besides the wine. Oh, looking at it.

And I'm sitting laughing at your handwriting. No, it's so, I love, it's so cute. But it looks like a 5-year-old man. He has your It's crazy how hard she just freaking giggled at my letter. No. Okay. Tears in my eye. Yeah. First Of all, his handwriting is a much better Handwriting is way better. I have Good handwriting. Do you think I'm a good? Okay, well pass the handwriting. What did you wanna say? So Anyways, I had Always knitting.


Yeah, I've got a knitting. Nevermind. We'll stop there. Anyways, I one when cash wrote this letter for me, obviously the first thing I noticed was like the little bit of grammar that was not right. But I never brought it up to him. 'cause like, it's like such a sweet little letter. Don't hold it. It's A delicate, I don wanna see it at the grammar's. Right? It's a delicate, You can look from a distance. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that. Gimme gimme. Be careful. Gimme that. Okay, gimme That. I'm living in it. Laminated. Pass it around over here after you're done. No, no. We just need to see it. I love you so much. Exclamation point. You are so beautiful. Exclamation point. Pss some statements. PS the little two dot thingy. Your secret lover.


My Harper. See it. She's not, it's beautiful. Spell run. That's a tricky word. No, y'all. She said we're not gonna break it. Are you gonna break it? No. I'm so serious if I'll touch it there. Okay.

Don't Do that to me. Let me see. Lemme see Missy. Okay, so, so let's talk about this thing. But the thing is, is that he, he wrote the sweetest letter. Everything's spelled right, but he doesn't know what PS stands for. So PS at the end of a letter stands for please stop. And then you add like an extra note. So like, you know not, that's not how you sign your name. Please stop your secret. Admir. Yeah. So No PS means please stop. So it's like, Oh baby you don't, guys, she doesn't know.


It means no Kate. No everybody stop. You're got me down myself. Guys, don't be mean to Kate in the comments because she doesn't know what PS means. Okay. It means post. It's like post note. But I don't know what the S stands for. Post. Post script. Postscript. I thought it Meant, please stop. No, no, it's for postscript. Oh this is a great episode. You're telling Meine please stop. Wow. If we had a mic, I Listen to what I'm about to say. That is revolutionary in my world. My Whole ain't no way you try to make fun of me on that.


That's crazy. Either way it's still incorrect. Oh please. Because stop, Stop. It still means the like post script or whatever still means like an extra little note after the fact. PS not where you would say like you would've started that with your secret lover or ended it with, you're so beautiful or something. No, no, no, no. Ps you would say from, I'm not saying Ps your secret lover. PS means Ps. Not like that. No. Wait you guys let me like finish bro. Good means like good. It means listen. That is such a circular argument. It's insane. No, it means like I'm coming back later to add onto to my note.


No. Yes. No it doesn't. You said it in a letter. It just means like, it means like also by the way, that's what it means. Yeah. It's like an extra little Nerve there. Yeah. Like yes. Not I'm coming back later to finish my sentence. Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine. What did you, what was the way you just worded it also by the way. Okay, also, by the way, that's what we're gonna go with that PS means. Okay. Also, by the way, now how am I wrong? Also because You ended it with, you're so I'm looking it up also, by the way, you're a secret lover. It's postscript. It's like if you said also by the way cash baker, It's like when you write a letter you start off with the post script. Yes. Post script Instead. Instead of writing Ps, wait, Harper, read the definition there.


We know we don't care. Apparently I don care. I was the only one here who Did not Definition post or ps. So what does, Oh, oh did you hear that? I don't know if y'all heard that in the camera, but she just sounds like rice Crispy Treat. That sounds, sounded like the machine gun As a rice Krispy treat when the meal gets poured in. So what does PS stand for? This is an abbreviation that stands for postscript. It comes from the Latin word postscript. When translated, this word means written after therefore, therefore it. Okay, sorry. Therefore it should become as no surprise that anything that follow the ps comes after the rest. The letter's already done. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I was right outta everyone.


I said it is when you come back later to write something. No bingo. That I was right. It means also, by the way, same thing. None of That's the same thing. None of that said to come back and add onto the letter. Yes, Yes it did. You literally just read it. Great. That's okay Either way. Matt. How am I wrong? I don I still don't understand. That's not when you are, when you are introducing yourself, you don't do it at the end in a posts script. You do it at the beginning. I didn't introduce myself. I said your secret Was like signing it guys. I was it. Then you just sign it. Look at it. It says your secret lover. When you sign something you don't say p. S and sign. No, I agree. I think you should have said you Sign. I I agree. You should have just said from You put a little dash or like your secret Lover I love or something. You Just put a little dash.


Oh my gosh. I said Ps your secret lover, your nose trash. It's trash. And spel it wrong. It's Not. It's not spelt bro. You Can literally see it's like faded. Like the sticky note is so old. Didn't too, that is not spelt wrong man. Acting like I'm, it is just crazy. I don everybody. Are you gonna be okay? Oh my gosh, it's okay. Harbor. Are you? It's okay. I just Can't believe my mom un like had unenrolled me and she stopped. She like made me adopt it. What? And I mean I, no listen. It's okay Mom. That Was such a good prank. Wait, y'all Are all talking and miss the best part.


The door starts beating. She's like, she goes y'all my mom. And Really Quiet. I knew somebody would see it but I was just like, oh God. Gosh, Gosh. I don dunno if that prank really worked or not. So moral of the story. I was wrong. That's moral. PS does not mean please stop. Yeah. And Also PS do not in your notes with PS or You'll get made fun of. Oh, speaking of notes, I found another note today. What, since we're go, we're talking about notes. I brought it and also no one is allowed to touch this one either. So notes. I need to read that one. Gimme that. Gimme that gimme. No, it's the one I told you about earlier I found. But you didn't read it yet. Oh Yeah.


This is kind of crazy. Where are my notes? Math. No, this isn't from cash. No. Kate wrote this note to herself. Yes I did when I was like, sounds sad, But When I was in like sixth grade I was like so cliche. I was like I need a bucket list of things I have to do before I probably like just finished watching some movie. Like you need a bucket list of things to do. 13 reasons probably. I don't even know. So here I hold a piece of notebook paper that was ripped outta my journal called Caitlin's 'cause I've used my full name. Then Caitlin Is your Real name. Yeah. Caitlyn's bucket list to do before finishing high school. No I didn't. Oh, let's see if you finished it. I never called you Caitlin. I know it'd be Weird. Which that's like a different person. I'm glad that everyone like you don't even know her name is Caitlyn and stuff.


Because the other day I was filling out her information and I was like, how do you spell your full name? I, she didn't know. She was like, you Didn't know how to spell my full name. K-A-T-E-L-Y-N. Thank you. Yeah. No one knows. No, no, no. Oh wait, it K-A-T-Y-L-N. K-A-T-E-L-Y-N. See this is, that's What I said My point. Oh I thought you didn't say E. Yeah, I said E, E, E. I heard EI said E. Okay, Well would y'all like to hear my bucket list and see if I completed it? Yeah. Yes. Let's hear. Let's hear it. Yeah. Get a job. Yeah, No. What there goes that fail you on?

That's so Kate, did you ever think you're, you're gonna be like a celebrity? I'm not. It's kind. I probably went to LA though. I, 'cause I went to LA when I was in high school. I'm assuming I probably ended up at some of it. Yes. I just hate to burst all the all's bubbles. But if we were celebrities, This TV would Work that. But also if we were celebrities. Hold on.

The declaration of Declaration of Independence. See if they can read that. Declaration of Independence. That's real cursive. In cursive it. It's always in curse. It was it not it. It was written Incur of Honey. That's probably why they're always arguing about it. Nobody knows what It says honey. Figure it out. It says it. No, It says that nobody knows. Don't get your education from the LO podcast. That's for Sure. No, but like for real man.


If they wrote that in cursive actually sorry. Writing in cursive. It's probably like y'all wanna learn another language for fun? No. Oh My right. So you know how there's like the letter A, that's Another language. No, You just have to learn the alphabet a second time. Yeah, it's almost 26. That's another language. It's 26 letters. Yeah that is another. And language is the same. It's not like you have to remember like this is A and Portuguese. What is that Spanish Portuguese Is is not Spanish. It French Chinese. What? Whatever all still makes the same. Somebody read me the first sentence here. Who? Who thinks they're the best? Me? I think I Can read it.


I don't know what part of the independence that is, but I actually had to memorize the declaration. It it becomes necessary for one people to, it's cut off For one people. That doesn't sound right. And then Why you gimme a cutoff picture. What? Can I have one with a full Sentence? A lot of people were blurry. I Can, It's all Reddit. That's why it was all blurry and like old looking 21 Savage. Is this Christian? Oh Yeah, You can get Cross on it. Yeah, no this is like hard to see. All these pictures are like extremely blurry. Let's, if we can find 21. Find like a real picture. 21. 21. Okay.

Imagine seeing a blurry person just like walking public. I Bet people throw me, People have who have to wear glasses and they don't probably experience that. Oh. But like imagine every other person being clear and then there's one blurry person. You're like what the Oh blur. Hey blurry. Like what? Like hey blurry. Sometimes y'all's eyes ever do that though. Where you like blink and it's blurry and you have to blink again. Yeah. In Morning especially my lash glue, I get a little, it gets the Lash glue's just shutting your eyes. Yeah.

I shall, well, we talked about what he scarred from in the thing. He talks about it. Tell, tell me right now. We Can't, we can't talk about it. We can't. It's honestly like brutal. It's, it's bad enough. Like I don't even wanna bring it up again. It sounds bad. Maybe don't post it on our channel. But it sounds bad to like say it, but for some reason standing in front of a crowd I was fine with. What do I stating in front of Me. You see that seems wrong. And I don't wanna do that. I knew it was gonna be bad from the very beginning. So before they even gave Mike, Mike, Mike gave before, before they gave cash the mic, I took it and I was like, I'm so sorry to everybody here for about what you're about to witness.


Luckily Her mic wasn't on. No. Really? Did nobody hear me? No. No. It was On dj. The the mic wasn't on. No, I remember when I got it. Nobody got my apology.

She's like, I'm sorry for anything Cash's about to say. And then I grabbed the mic and I was like, okay, I'm, I'm gonna die now. No, listen, just know that anything that was said at Kenzie's wedding still is not near as comparable as to what Maverick said at our wedding. His was so bad that we actually cannot post it. No. Ever. So we got your blessings Kinzie.


We're lucky we can post mine. I, mine was like on the borderline. His was like so far across the border, but you couldn't even see two borders behind him. Man, It was bad. It was, it was pretty crazy. But yours is even cr I mean, arguably crazier. No, no, it's Not. Now there's a reason we can post cash. Is it not yours? He kissed the Grandma. Yeah.

She was, she was Getting a little bit insecure when she was doing that. Yeah. I was like, no one's ever wanted me to model before, but That's Actually in front of everyone right now. Yeah. Yeah. Her eyes like went right when you turned just, And then when I brought up the joke about my mom and dad, man, that part might've ruined the wedding. That actually might've ruined the wedding. Wait, what was The joke? It Was close. No, to be quite honest, you ruined the wedding with that joke.


Like that joke that when you said that, I was like, there's no way he's saying this right now at A wedding. Like inappropriate. Our mother was looking at you. Oh, I have a clip of her in her eyes. She's like trying to keep the camera on, but she's like this. She was like running like, basically she, she was so upset. You could just tell she was so upset by what you said. I made not believe you ever said that. Like, I don't know what would ever possess you to say something like that in front of everybody. So it was same you said practically the same thing at our wedding. Okay. Yeah, but that's different. Wait, did I ruin the wedding In my Did you ruin it bro? Mom was, mom was literally so like read from what you said. Yes. I ruined the wedding for mom, but everyone else had a great time.
