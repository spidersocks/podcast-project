Biggest, my biggest mistake is obviously kissing a bunch of random girls. Soullessly Maverick. What's yours? Oh, my biggest mistake is I serially dated girls and led them on to believe that I would probably get married to them even though I knew deep in my heart that probably wasn't gonna happen. Okay, well that might have been the most cruel of them. Oh, Harper, what is yours? I'm gonna be so honest.


Hitting a vape. Oh, You can get out. No, that is unforgivable. No. Okay. Okay. Everybody here has No, I haven't, I have never hit a vape. Oh no. Oh, double whammy. Double whammy. Really?

Okay. When You're, I hope you guys don't listen too.


These are our mistakes. We have made regret. We're not condoning this, this is the time of our lives that we wish we could take back. Y'all ever touched the stove and I'm living in it right now. And you realize it's hot and you regret touching it. We touched the stove. I did it too. I I did it 30 times and then on the 30th time I was like, it wasn't really that yours happened so fast. It was, it was like 30 girls and it just flew by and then all of a sudden you were like, it's just like kissing booth. And you know what's crazy? I'm living in that time right now. Yeah. What? I'm living in the time where y'all were regretting. Well the thing is, is That you're figuring things out. When I was your age, all these mistakes we're talking about. We were your age. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm Living So we are here to guide you. Like Miyagi, that was funny.


No, when you're like 14, 15, 16 things just seem so nonchalant to you and like it's so casual because everyone around you is like, yeah, it's drinking and vaping, making out with people and it just seems so normal. Normal. And it's not Dude. Yeah. And your parents might seem lame for being like, don't, don't go drink or Yeah. Smoke or whatever. But seriously it actually is. It's not just your parents being lame. Yeah. I bet if you asked anybody you might die like in their twenties if they regret like the things they did in high school a lot, like the average person would say, yeah, I regret some of the things. What? You're 21. Make your own decisions man. But but Like vaping it gives you popcorn, lungs and stuff and it's like a crisis in America's like teenagers right now.


Like so many teenagers are vaping. And guess what did people that have been vaping for like 10 years, their lungs are collapsing. They're destroyed That. Okay. Sot I'm But It Tastes so good. But the, the only reason people vape is for the buzz. You can get non-nicotine vapes and they, what you promoting now even is bad for you. Yeah. Any chemicals are happen Harper. Are you saying vapes are good? No, they just tastes good. Nobody stuff there. Like we said, you do it. Harper is stealing her time where she's making mistakes. So no, just shut up and say you're Yourself people. They literally socially, like when I was, when I was like 14 and I tried vaping, I only, I literally only did it because people around me were doing it and it's, that's Regret I started too.


Yeah, you do it 'cause people around you are doing it and it's not fun. We once get popcorn lines once again. I just wanna reiterate again, everything we are talking about, if we have done it, we are not condoning it. It is actually not good to do and we don't do it anymore. We're Good role models To you guys. You know what's crazy is I remember thinking how much better I was than you two. What? Because like I was like, I have a girlfriend. Like yeah, I'm kissing her and stuff, but like at least she's like my girlfriend. You're just kissing random girls. I remember thinking I was so much better than you. Okay. I wasn't though. It is my point. If you asked me, you kissing one girl and me kissing multiples, it sounds like I was better than you. Well no, because yours was mistakes remember? Yes. Yes. Very bad. Yes. No.


And mine was arguably worse looking back. Yes. But but what? And I thought I was so much better than you too. That's crazy. I actually don't want people to think that I'm like vape addict because I'm not. You were saying it was a mistake Harper. Yeah, it was a mistake. That's that's what I was trying to clarify. We are talking about these things so hopefully you guys do not make these mistakes. Yeah. Okay. But Also we're just five kids on a podcast. So what are we doing?

Kidney stone. Just get this out. It was bad Jose, I meant to tell you earlier today. What did you And and that was when I came out and I told Kate, I said, childbirth is hard. That was also very hard. And I don't know which one are they comparable? Who knows? Who knows. But if it's anything like that, I feel very bad for women. Mav told me that women everywhere, my heart goes out to you. M told me that one of the worst pains you've ever experienced cash was getting your eyebrows threaded. No. The worst pain I ever experienced was my tooth bigs. You have Jelly dripping down your But your eyebrows was up there, right? My eyebrows? Yeah.

I had to pee really bad. And You know what's bad? I don't know if I should say this. The Guy just kept talking, man.


He just kept talking. Well, I don know. I won't say it. No, Don't say it. It was a sensitive phone call. You probably can't say it. No, no, no. I was gonna say something else. Not about the phone call itself. Oh, We'll say it Ma and Cash, when they talk on the phone, if they try to, they can sound like each other. Oh, it's so, it's, it's one of the most amazing things in life. It's Pretty good. So cash runs to the bathroom and Mav just takes the phone and starts talking his cash And the person, and no one ever notices person has no clue what. And if cash comes back Yeah. And takes the phone and you would have no Clue. Sometimes if we have like a long call with someone, like that's gonna be a long business call. Big shift. Sometimes we'll rotate. I'll talk to them for like 45 minutes and I'll, I'll just be like, yeah man. So what do you think? And then while they're talking, I'll just hand it off to Mav and I'll go chill for like 45 minutes.


And Mav just continues the phone call. And the craziest part is we even do it to our grandmas. Yeah. Sorry, your, You've done it to your mom before too. And, and Our moms. Yeah man, we were on the phone the other day with this guy who stole a bunch of money from us and pay up. Yeah. He stole a bunch of money from us. And I was like, okay, like what are we gonna do? Like, or do we like threaten to sue this guy? Like what are we, what, what should we do here? Bread Sue. It was like $20,000, $25,000. We were like, that's insane. He stole a lot of money. Yeah. So we're like, I don't know what to do. So we get on the phone and we're like, we'll play good cop, bad cop. So I'm being like, good cop. Cash was kind of being bad cop. And I'm like, listen, because like, well, because someone's, I understand like Ka is like on him.

And he, while I'm talking to him, he's like, I'm like, dude, no, I, I think we're just gonna have to settle this out in court, blah, blah, blah blah. And he's like, Maverick, you need to get your brother under control. He thought I was talking the Whole time. He was like, no, he was mad.

Now's I've done it to Kate many times. Yeah. There's been times where I've picked up the call from cash and it's Mav talking to me.
