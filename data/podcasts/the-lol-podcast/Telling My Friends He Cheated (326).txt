I worked hard for these privileges. Cash was talking to me the other night. He was, he was like trying to flex on me or something as if I wasn't already married to him. And he had to prove himself to me. Oh, first of all you started that convo. Wait, what? Kate started the convo by saying no one ever liked me growing up. I I did not say that Every person I ever had a crush on never liked me. I did not say that. You're literally, I said Being picky. I said everyone liked cash. That's what I was saying. Yeah, because he started it actually. He was like, yeah, I never experienced like, oh, a girl not liking me back. Okay. I really, you was like, that's Crazy. I was trolling you, but ew.

You did too, didn't you? No. Yes you did. No, but I don don't remember. He's lying. I don't remember any either of us liking her. You liked her? Whatcha talking about?

I I I promise I did not hold Chloe's hand. That's crazy. I Can call her right now. And she'd say yes. I remember the spot. You held her hand. That's crazy. And then I looked over and YouTube let go. And you guys were like, you don't remember that Cass was traumatized. Apparently. Dude, that must have crushed you. Yeah, it did. Mav. Okay. That's And the fact that you don't even remember is insane. I don't, yeah. He held her hand and I liked the girl. I don't remember, but yeah. No respect for his brother. We did meet when we were really young.


So wait, So how old were they? And they Went, we were like, at the time they were probably like nine and I was probably younger. They were probably like nine, 10. And I was probably like eight. And I looked over and they were holding the hands. And then they like even been, when I looked over, they let go really quickly. We were all walking in the woods. It was our first year being homeschooled. So we might've even been like seven or eight. No, we were not seven and eight. Probably. We might've been eight. It was like 10. But yeah, So traumatized. You know what he How old are you in third grade Year? Like nine. Nine? Yeah. Okay. Well that was the year I got pulled out. So I'd have been nine then. Yeah. Well I wasn't pulled out when you were in the third grade. So you would've been 10. What? Oh my God. Where you were hanging out with the Group. Here's what year you guys were pulled Out. You know what? Fine. We won't argue. You know what? I don't care. All you gotta know is there's a love triangle. Maverick did not respect his brother. What? And neither one of us ended up getting the girl first off.


If there ever was a love triangle between us. There was, it was so obvious. Even Alex knew Alex even just said yes. Oh my goodness. This is all fake. I know it's fake because you just said earlier today. Yes I did. But no, that's actually false. Earlier today. He goes, that's false. We're definitely making this up. No, that's false. Because earlier today I'll call her right now. I'll call her now. We need to, we need a love triangle on the podcast. Exactly what he said. That's what I did say. And that's why I thought of the story. I said, we need to love trying on the podcast. But we're all married and Harper's only one person. So Yeah. Earlier today you, he was like, we really, I wish we had a love triangle on the podcast. Would That's what I thought of that story. So, and I wasn't going to tell you, dude, if we get two extra, 'cause I'll call her right now. Well, and she's married.


This is about to be real awkward. Don't Call her I'm I'm calling her. Hey, you know who we do need to call What? Your mom.

Excuse Me. It didn't mean to it's natural gas. How do he get mad but are easy? Or is it kind of hard? He Doesn't really, playing chords are pretty easy. I mean, bar chords are hard. Like he, He has before, but he playing, He Doesn do it like cash difficult Depending on, well Is it easier than the piano? Because pianos pretty hard for me. Yeah. You know what Ka did say last night? Mav, it might be harder. While we were talking about this, what last night we were talking about, about how like every girl liked him back and he was like, oh, walking into church camp you were, oh, me and Mav were the kings of church camp. And I said, not Jesus. We had long hair, too long flowy hair. And Ka was so proud of himself 'cause he was in the church band and he sat on a little box and it was a square box, but he called it a drum 'cause he got to hit it with his Hand.


Okay. Okay. And he was like, I have to go be Wait cash. You were proud of your box? No, I was not proud of my box. It's called a coone by the way. And there was a drummer in our band. I need to be proud of your box. Chloe's older brother was the drummer. And since he was older than me, he gotta beat the drummer that played the actual drum set. So you and I got stuck on a coone, but Cat, which is a box that you tap under you, which by the way, called a box you used by a campfire. Not in an actual band when there's already a drummer. So pretty much no one can hear anything I'm doing. I I had, it's like having a microphone that's not plugged in. That's what I had. No, but he was like, he used To and he still had to show up to practice. He hated him. I literally remember telling, I remember telling our parents one time, I was like, this is pretty useless.

Cash literally says, Hey can you, can you get to the email? Do you know how to do that? Okay. No, I didn't say it like that. Yeah, okay. I was like, it's a computer. There is one thing I don't really do. And that's use a computer. He doesn't, I don't use that. I use my phone for everything. Sorry. Domi. And then I need someone to use the computer. I ask Mav, Alex or Kate or Kenzie. He sits there and watches like an old man. Like Okay. Okay. I Understand. Okay. Did you find it Okay? You know, what does it say?


I feel Can you open it? I feel it's downloading cash. Well what, what do you mean it's downloading? Just open it. The the thing that got me was in one of the episodes, the guy goes to a pawn shop and he buys a computer and it's like a used computer and he gets the charger for the computer. And the guy's like, well did you plug the, he's like, the computer doesn't work. And he is like, well, did you plug it in? And he's like, you said it was wireless.

Why do you keep saying that? It's literally getting booked. I'm so tired of people telling me that. No, it is getting booked. But you know what's funny is we were, we were gone this last week and Harper had been in Costa Rica and we went to LA and Harper was like, oh, I wanna go to LA with you guys. Like next time without my mom, because she's only 15. So her mom still goes with her.


But she thinks we party when we're on la. But we don't, no, I know they All go party, but I'd just rather be with my friends. Yeah. Do you think I'm a friend? I consider you a friend. Really? Yeah. Not like a younger friend. No. You're Like, You're in fact a younger friend. You're Younger friend by definition. That is what you are. I Know, but like, what do you Like think about it this way. Okay. Pap and Chase hang out with us. I know, but they're, and they're 30, 30 years old. Okay. Yeah. They're like 10 years older than us. Okay. Yes. But like, And you're like only like four years younger than Kate. The age gap between me and you is way less than the age gap between me and Pape. Yeah. No, the age gap between Kenzie or Kate and Harper. Harper is only four years. The age gap between me and Pape is ten nine and, and Cash was 16.


Hanging out with Pap best friends. Yeah. Yeah. Well, well The thing is like, do you, do you actually see me as a friend? Yeah. Yeah. No, no way. Yes, I do. Straight through. I literally text you.

I don't snap, but like I text and I, well I don't really text either. I'm sorry. I'm really, it's okay. I don't Look at my messages. You don't text? No. Harper doesn't text. I think out of every time I've ever texted something to Harper, I've waited about two days and then I, and then I text her mom and I'm like, Hey, can you have Harper check her phone? She responds to me instantly every time. Really? Yeah. What's, what's up with that? It's Because I don't have your contact saved and I see Maverick's.


I know you have my contact saved 'cause I was on your favorites. Okay. Okay. The thing is, I don't have a photo for you, but every time I see, see Maverick's orange photo of him like looking into the light. Like you His AI photo. Yes. His AI Photo. Dude, I have face TAs on in his AI photo. I gotta show y'all MA's contact photo. It goes to everyone's phone when you text him like, oh, I changed mine. Does somebody have it? I have it. Call me.

Where? Kate? Oh yes.


People. Yes, yes. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Essentially the game is, is you call somebody's friend to see if they'll cover for them. So Kate would call say Alex, but he's right here. She would call him and be like, Hey Cash said he was with you last night. Is that true? Implying, implying that I'm hiding something for Kate or like sneaking around and like trying to lie to Kate. Yeah. And then you see if the person covers for you, what are you doing? Yeah. What, what was that you trying to do? Doing A pushup. You wanna see? Yeah, Kate Loki might have her pushup down.
