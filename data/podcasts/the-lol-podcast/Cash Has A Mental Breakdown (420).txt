A home life. Why are you mad at Kenzie? That's the first time you'll ever hear me say, but I'm emotional today. I feel like a woman. This thumbnail should be Cassius. Cassius breakdown. Mental breakdown. Yeah. You know what I always, I always thought it was funny because if you scroll through our episodes, Kate has a mental breakdown episode and so does Harper and here it is, 170 episodes in, I'm having a mental breakdown, a crisis. I may say you are having a mental breakdown nav. Will you hit me a green ball? I've never seen you. This can, are you disgusted? You can you please share Why you're upset with me And Kenzie then? Oh, I'm sorry. Because you shared why you were mad at Matt. Have you shared? Maybe that's why. Okay, fine. You want me to get continue?

If you wanna be treated right, you go there. Everyone knows that. Okay. And now Kate, did you just do an ad for T-Mobile and Kate mid mental breakdown. I'm not really super mad at you, but I'm just angry and I want the gender status.


And then Kate today she was talking and, and then she was like, you know what, I just won't ever help you with any ideas ever again. And that was just because I said her idea was bad. Yeah. I don know why you wanted me downstairs anyways. 'cause anytime I give either of you two boys any ideas, you just sit there and stare at me with a blank face. Like I didn't speak at all. Yeah, Because your ideas are dumb. I'm kidding. Whoa, I'm kidding. Rude. They're good. I'm done. Good ideas. I'm done helping, Doing anything. That's true. Kenzie does have good ideas. If we are like, you know, down back like we, we really, that's what I felt like Mom. Mom. See that's just, that's insulting to say. Yeah, it is. Yeah.
