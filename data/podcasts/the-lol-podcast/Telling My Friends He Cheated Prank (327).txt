And they went, we were like, at the time they were probably like nine and I was probably maybe younger. They were probably like nine, 10. And I was probably like eight. And I looked over and they were holding the hands. And then they, like, even when I looked over, they were like, let go really quickly. We were all walking in the woods.

Corny. It's pretty cheesy. Knock Johnny. It's a little cheesy, but it's a Good show. Good show. It is liter literally cash my like cash. Gosh. Acts like that man. Because the guy Is like the old guy that can't work the wifi. Yes. That's literally cash in every episode. He is like laughing at inappropriate things like making inappropriate jokes. And I'm just like, that's you. The other Day we're on the laptop. Cash literally says, Hey, can you, can you get to the email? Do you know how to do that? Okay. No, I didn't. Didn't say it like that. Yeah. Okay. I was like, it's a computer. There is one thing I don't really do. And that's use a computer. He doesn. I don't use that. I use my phone for everything dummy. And I need someone to use the computer. I ask Mav, Alex or Kate or Kenzie. He sits there and watches like an old man. Like, okay Don. I understand.


Okay. Did you find it? Okay? You know, what does it say? I feel Can you open it? I feel it's downloading cash. Well, what, what do you mean it's downloading? Just open it. The but the thing that got me was in one of the episodes, the guy goes to a pawn shop and he buys a computer and it's like a used computer. And he gets the charger for the computer. And the guy's like, well, did you plug the, he's like, the computer doesn't work. And he is like, well, did you plug it in? And he is like, you said it was wireless. Like I was like, that's cash. That's, but it's funny because the two like rivals in the show remind me of like, Mav, you're the other guy and Cash. You're him. I'm the Russo. Yeah. Aw ha. Literally, honestly, LaRusso is kind of like a nerd.


Well he kind of like kicks your butt like all the time. He's pretty good at karate. Yeah, He is the karate kid. I'm just excited For the summer to go To go away. No, No, no, no, no, no. To go on tour with y'all. Oh, I'm so excited for tour. Wow. It's gonna be fun. Hopefully tickets will go on sale semi soon. We are playing a tour, but unfortunately they're not on sale quite yet. But stay tuned. And it's not really booked either. Yes. Why Don, you keep saying that. It's literally getting booked. I'm so tired of people telling me that. No, it is getting booked. But you know what's funny is we were, we were gone this last week and Harper had been in Costa Rica and we went to LA and Harper was like, oh, I wanna go to LA with you guys. Like, next time without my mom, because she's only 15.


So her mom still goes with her. But she thinks we party when we're on la But we don't, no, I Know they all, all party, but I'd just rather be with my friends. Yeah. Do you think I'm a friend? I consider you a Friend. Really? Yeah. Not like a younger friend. No, you're Like a friend. You're in fact a younger friend. That younger friend by definition. That is what you are. I know, but Like, what do you Like think about it this way. Okay. Pa and Chase hang out with us. I know, but they're, and they're 30, 30 years old. Okay. Yeah. They're like 10 years older than us. Okay. Yes. But Like, and you're like only like four years younger than Kate. And the age gap between me and you is way less than the age gap between me and Pap. Yeah. No, the age gap between Kenzie or Kate and Harper. Harper is only four years. The age gap between me and Pap is ten nine and, and Cash was 16.


Hanging out with Pape best friends. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, well The thing is like, do you, do you actually see me as a friend? Yeah. Yeah. No, no way. Yes, I do straight, I literally text you. I I don't text. I actually, I don't text very many people at all. Really? I don't text. She's actually really bad at texting your pin. I don your pin number went on my snap. Really? That's so sweet. I don't snap, but like I text and I, well I don't really text either. I'm sorry. I'm really, it's okay. I don't look On my messages. You don't text? No. Harper doesn't text. I think out of every time I've ever texted something to Harper, I've waited about two days and then I, and then I text her mom and I'm like, Hey, can you have Harper Checker phone? She responds to me instantly every time. Really? Yeah. What's, what's up with that? It's because I don't have your contact saved and I see Maverick's.


Yeah, I know you have my contact saved. 'cause that was on your favorites. Okay. Okay. The thing is, I don't have a photo for you, but every time I see Maverick's orange photo of him, like looking into the light. Like you His AI photo. Yes. His AI Photo dude change stuff. I have face TAs on in his AI photo. I gotta show y'all M's. Contact photo. It goes to everyone's phone when you text him like, oh, I changed mine. Does somebody have it? I have it. Call me. Call me. It pops up. And it seems Just To all on my phone. I, I couldn't keep looking at it. I was like, that's goofy. So I changed It. Mav Lilly has an AI photo of him. Mav loves his AI photos. I Cash's photo. Oh heck no. Look at that cash. Yes. Yes. That one with the orange background. Yeah. Yeah. So that kind of lit eye picture of me for a while. Do you still have that?


Well, I had to change it, Dude. That's that's a good one. So that's my current one for av. Oh. Oh, oh. I just almost flashed his phone number, Man. He tried to hold my hand a couple of times. More than, than one that actually, that actually plural. I, I am gonna ask Yuck. This ends mad if you pro Mav. Look, here's my chat with her. Haven't texted since 2019. That's crazy. 'cause I, I cannot, I do not remember that. That's crazy. I never felt like it burnt in my mind. Yo. Anyways. Well, I mean it really scarred you, I guess anyways. What was, that must have been absolutely nothing to me. What was the game you guys were talking about? I want to play the game. We did it before where? Kate, the TikTok. We were watching it earlier. Where? Kate? Oh yes, yes, yes.


I know what you're talking about. Yeah. I, We essentially, the game is, is you call somebody's friend to see if they'll cover for them. So Kate would call say Alex, but he's right here. She would call him and be like, Hey Cash said he was with you last night. Is that true? Implying, implying that I'm hiding something for Kate or like sneaking around and like trying to lie to Kate. Yeah. And then you see if the person covers for you, what are you doing? Yeah. What, what was that you trying to do? You a Pushup. You wanna see Kate Loki might have her pushup down. Actually she did it last time. Do you think that was a bug? Yeah, she's been hitting the gym. Let's see it. Come on all the way down nose. One more, one more nose. Touch the ground. Kate. She did too. Oh. Oh wow.


Good job Kate. Thanks. I'm Proud all. So who wants to call Who's friend first? Oh, I'll call Kenzie's friend first, but I don't know if she's gonna answer. And it might be a little bit weird 'cause I don't know her reaction. All right. You call and then you are, you call. Okay. Wait, who are you gonna call? My sister? No. What friend? Gabriela. Oh. Oh, Gabriela don't think Gabriela your phone. I need her phone number. Gabriela Is such a morally upright woman. She's not covering. She's Gonna be like, oh no She's not. She's not Lying. She might Kenzie's probably been kidnapped. Yeah. She's gonna think of, I don Dunno who Gabriela is, but that is such a drama name. Gabriela gimme A phone. Gabriella is not drama. She is actually so calm though. Like few Days I would call one of her other friends. Is that do I think that because of high school musical, but somebody Gabriela Gabriela From Yes.


Gabriel School musical. Okay. All Of them right now I Can On her number is that's high school music math 3 9 4 1 math 8 0 4 1. Right. Just leaked the number online. That better be fake.

I'm nervous. You're just gonna make someone mad. Okay, Here we go. What do you, what do I say way before I call? What should I say? Say, Hey, it's Mav. I just wanted to ask something. Kinzie said she was with you last night. Is that true? That's it. Or or you could say that Kenzie said that she was going to dinner with you tonight.


No, I'm gonna say last night. I don know what last, Last night. You just gotta lie. It's literally not that hard. You can say anything. I'm good at lying. Alright. Hopefully she picks up. Why am I getting nervous? It's 'cause it's Gabriela. She's gonna say Now. She may not answer. Gabriela. Yeah. She might not answer. 'cause she doesn't know a number. Scared. A lot of times people don't answer when it's a random number. Come on. Especially Oklahoma. Yeah. Your call has been forward. Told you you gotta text her and say it's Mav call me. Okay. I'll text her. She'll call back. Also, I'm kind of sad that Chloe picked up my call after not talking to her in years. Didn't have my contact saved. And I said, hey. And she goes, oh, I know it's you just by me saying hey. Said hey. That's crazy. She said, I know it's you. Her voice didn't sound the same, but apparently yours.
