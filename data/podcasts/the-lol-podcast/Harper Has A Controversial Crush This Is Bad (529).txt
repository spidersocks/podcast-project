My house is coed fire. Yo Harper, did you hear about this? Yeah. They go on a walk for like maybe five to 10 minutes and they come back and they open the door to their house. Wait, they couldn't see the flames or smoke from the outside? It was in the back of the house. That's So bad. I can't tell Y'all about my true love right now because it will spark some controversy. He just broke up with somebody. He's gonna come to Texas. If this guy's coming to Texas. Is he coming on the pot please? Yeah. No, just who He is first. I know who it's, yeah. What's up guys? Welcome back to another episode of The LOL Podcast. Walter Shma. Callahan is on his phone.


Yeah, Shma Today. Shma, Listen, today what? Listen, please listen and stop talking, okay? Yeah. But like Maverick was trying to tell the girls something before the episode and I told him, or no, ma was trying to tell them on the episode. And I said, girls, you guys do not wanna hear this on the episode. Let me tell you this before the podcast starts because this conversation does not need to unravel. Yes it does. On the podcast. Justice does not wait for nobody. And I'm telling you, you the girls insisted. No, keep it. Save the conversation for the podcast. I don't know. So here we are on the podcast. I don't understand if it's gonna make us upset. Why wouldn't you just tell us after the podcast? Why Don, you? You were the one that said, say it on the pod. I said, should it be said on the pod?


And you said, you said just say it on the pod. It'll probably be entertaining. But then y'all said, oh, well it's just gonna make them be quiet and sad or whatever you said. Yeah, it is gonna make. So why would you not tell us sad? I Don't get Sad easily. So we'll just say no because you guys sad. Nobody should be sad. You're supposed to be very grateful people. Yes. So Something happened to the property. We can't have two houses. No, I wish, I wish in case. So just to fill the audience in, in case they don't know. We bought a piece of land that me and Kate and m and Kinzie are splitting, right? And we are building a warehouse for The LOL Podcast and all that stuff on it. I will be security on the podcast.


And then we are also building May and Kate's home and m and Kinzie, a home on the land. Yay. But the girls have each favored a piece of the land where they want their house to be. Okay? So me and Maverick decided to keep the girls out of it because within them in it, they're just going talk and too many emotions act like they don't really want it, but then talk to us like they do want it and all that stuff. So me and Maverick are like, you know what? We're just gonna keep the emotions out of it and we're gonna flip a coin. And we flipped a coin. Alex was there to witness this. Oh my gosh, what? So this is not real. We, there was no, no one was budging. No. And so we flipped a coin. You are joking. Wait, what do you mean we're joking? No one You're joking. Do you mean told you for the videos?


This is not real. I, We Could stop the podcast Right now. I was trying to tell you before the pod, I, I told you you guys did not wanna hear this. I said unfortunately there's no idea Harper, Harper is so happy. One of you're about to be sad. Listen, I told cash before. It's not, there's, I said unfortunately. Oh, I see it. There's no way Kenzie does not something on my head that that's insane. That's insane. It's just gonna be awkward. No, I told Katherine, so before we started, I said, there's no way something on my head. Kenzie wants that side and she's not gonna back down. She and I side, Kate also wants that side and there's always, she's gonna lay down so there's no use in even all four of us talking about it as couples or whatever.


You and Kay talk, there's no use. 'cause you guys, you guys have been here before. We coin flip for the best bedroom in the house. That's just what you do. You each want it. So you just do a 50 50 fair thing. Okay? What about my take? Yeah. Harper, what's your take? Right? Al Jake, the queen bedroom or the master bedroom? Remember it was where we built the houses. Yeah. She doesn't Know what we're talking about. Yeah. Would you guys like to know what the stop Picking at your skin? I know. It's so bad. Look. Aw, Would you guys like to know who got the, the wood side that you guys both want? I'm just gonna Cover my face. Look at them. I don't think I don want to know. This is like, you don't wanna know. It's like draft night in the NFL. Like I was, I enjoyed living in oblivion.


So we flipped the coin old. Actually, I don't even feel right. Okay, we'll just wait till after the episode. It's clearly gonna break them. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's so special nervous Now what, what's so special about one side and the other? The other side just has like woods unfortunately too. The other side has just a private driveway, like the wooded side. It's like the better side of the property. And then the other side is just more like, it's still good, but it's just like not as good. It's not a better side of the property. Okay. Both. Okay. So you're fine with that side. You both wanted that side. And ca look, if you guys, we can disregard the corn flip. Okay? I'm just gonna say if you guys can come to your own agreement, we'll disregard the coin flip. But I Don't think there's any world where you guys either of you bch.


Okay? So I'm just gonna announce who won the side. So we did flip the coin and Alex was out a witness, which I, I went to bat. Okay? There is reasons Kenzie wants the Woodside. Yes, ma. We understand. We get it, but I, okay. All right. So we flipped the coin. Maverick called it in the air. Maverick said heads and the coin landed on tails. Which I, I'll be honest, I feel like it's unfair because Kenzie wants the side with the trees because she likes she wants to be in the trees and cash said Kate and them are just gonna cut down all the trees. Yes, but Kate likes the private drive. That's what Kate likes about it.


So, so who won better? Because who won? Who won? Kate won? Dude, That's just messed up. But I think this was a dumb thing to do on the podcast. I told you before the episode you would want to hear this conversation still be grateful. Dump say Before the podcast too. Kenzie, You should still be grateful and and Kate should be grateful. Yeah, I wish I We were getting, I told you great. I told you neither one of 'em was gonna be happy. Kate's not happy because she won the side and she feels like she's taking it from Kenzie. And Kenzie's not happy because she didn't get the side. We should move on. Our audience does not care. Or you don't care. The audience does not care. Harper, do you Care?


I mean, not really, but like, I, I'm not, I Can I say something? Please. No, Kenzie, look at me. Why is she not Looking at you? No, why is Kenzie gonna cry? Gonna, no, Kenzie, I just, I'm just gonna tell you one thing. You get the, you get the side with the trees. We already discussed it. I actually Kenzie this this Decide me. This is a joke on me. I was not letting in on this joke Actually. Yeah, we didn't tell you. No, I'm trying to Stop it before you cried. I'm sorry. No, it's okay.


I'm so sorry. I didn't want you to Cry. That was crazy. Why would you do that? No, y'all don't understand. Okay. Kenzie and I, when we first looked at the land, I liked that there was a private driveway, but I also don't wanna live like in the trees because I'm scared of the bugs and stuff that come with that. Kenzie wants to live like in the trees. Like she's in some sort of secret magical forest. And so I was Like, dang. Well, I mean it doesn't make sense for me to just come in and cut down all these trees when Kinzie wants the trees. Understandable. And then, and then we Drove and then we actually, we drove down the private driveway and I was like, it was kind of bouncy and stuff and I was like, I don't really know if I like it a whole lot.


Like kind of hurt my tummy a little bit. So I was like, dang, I don't even care for this side a whole lot no more. 'cause it hurt my tummy when we were driving. And I was like, what? So Then I was like, sorry. So like Ka and I had talked about it weeks ago. We just never actually clarified with y'all. We were like, yeah, we're fine with this side if they want the other side. Are you Sure? I'm being so genuine? Actually I'm being So serious. I genuinely like prefer the other side. Yay. So we're both happy. Yay. Yay. Why did that scare me so bad? Oh my gosh. Yeah. But good luck with your bugs. Okay. Not me though. We Were in a gas station the other day in Livingston actually. And there was just like a cockroach on the floor and it was like this big, and ma was like, lu that bug.


And I don't, what was the conversation that we had? I don remember. Well, there was that bug and then we turned around, there was another big caught rock correl, which on the other side of the store after I was like, man, I don't like this gas station. And Kenzie was like, this is what it's gonna be like living out there. It'll be great. I was like, what? I was like, no. Wait, I have a question because, Oh, what is that? Oh, I have a question for you guys. 'cause like you guys have always, always, always just been like, I don't care what side we get, we're happy with whatever. But genuinely, I think you guys do have a preference. So what would you prefer? I know me and Matt. Yeah. Oh, we could care less. Literally. What would you like? I could care less. I, I please like Whatever you Like. That's what I want. My first instinct, if I bought the land was gonna build a house, I would build it on the field side.


Yeah. Just But that's also just where the, the field is. Either Way. I just think it's a better view of the pond. Y that's been my whole thing. Well, either way Y'all gonna have To, is your wood on the field? If I was buying the land by myself, I'd build it on the wood side just for the noise of the highway. That's it. I don't think it's gonna be the They're The exact same. Well no, then you wouldn't though, because you wouldn't wanna pay to take all those trees out if you don't have to. There's Already, oh actually no, no. Yeah, you're right. There's already Like a Good spot to, if you're riding by myself, I would not do that. I don't think it's gonna be much quieter. Like I, I walk around the pond and stuff and like you hear the same thing, but yeah. Yeah. We're both Happy with the side of the land. We get, I was, I was stressing for a minute cash and I were low key. Like when we talked about how we wanted the side with the field, we were like, we gotta keep it low key. 'cause like if they hear that we want It keep, see I said from, I said from Maverick.


From Maverick specifically. I, We said the second we tell Mav we want this side, all of of a sudden he's gonna want it. I wanted it the whole time. That's, see I even best I even said here. No. Hey, if it has, wait, actually I don't think you, that's true because me and you each talked about the wood side, how it was better. Oh no, I said that just to make you want the wood side. Ask Kinzie, which side did I always say was better? He, he did say he'd rather the filled side. Yeah. He thinks it has a better view of I you tickets Ladies, you'll end up shopping for your guy's deodorant. Right? So try degrees original. Cool rush.

You Literally just told us, you just told us yesterday that you're, you're not, Since you were 10, you've been on lot since you were 10. Well, in fifth grade we met each other for the first time. Josh, You can't talk. You were on and off with Kate since like 10. Yeah, but mostly on. Okay, so No, mostly off actually. Did you know that? Okay. When we were like 12, it doesn't count. Harper's 16 years old. Yeah. And by the time Kate, me and Kate was 16, we were engaged. No, basically Child. Whoa. That's crazy. She wasn't engaged at 16, 17. I was Going to be At 17. That mean next year. Imagine Harper being engaged to someone. Harper could be married next year.


No. The first Time you were gonna propose to me. 'cause he, he attempted once and it didn't work out. Yeah. So I was, she was 16. I was 16. Should I get married? Not just for the No, no, no. Not just for the heck. I don I mean I do recommend have one person that I'm like plotting on, but other than that I'm plotting on them. I don think that's the right language. What does that mean? Well, have you asked us? No, that's like what I do. What? Nevermind what? Huh? Have Asked. I feel like that's what girls do though. Like guys are pursuers and girls are OTs. They're like, how can I plot my life into his life? How can I make Shirley that I'm in the same place at the same time? Exactly. It's true. When I was in high school, I had a friend that was interested in this guy. So we would go sit outside his work in the parking lot and wait for him to come out that We got a stalker.


Yeah. That, that deserves a call in. So yeah, it was our past time. I remember you telling me that we were like Snapchatting or something and you were on the phone and you were telling me how you guys would Go outside this guy's work. You were Snapchatting cash while you were doing that? No, it was for her friend. My friends friends. Oh, your friend liked him? Yeah. So it was just like a pa It was COVID. Like nothing was happening. It Was so illegal though. You know. So when you guys would see him, you're 16, when you guys would see him come out of his workplace, what'd you do? Well, he was a, he was, he worked at a store, so he was pushing carts. So he was out there a lot. Blue Strip. You just watched him. Did she like get outta the parking lot and like walk by him or just stare at him in the car? So one time we did. And one time, how many times did you go? Not that many, but we definitely went like a, like a few times.


And there was one time me and my friends were like hyping her up. We were like, come on, like let's go out, let's like walk by him, see if he notices you. 'cause they, they had never actually officially met. Yeah. What? So wait, wait. I didn't know that part. How'd she meet the guy? Through, through Snapchat. It was just like added through friends, you know. Okay. So anyways, she had been like Snapchatting him and she was in interested and so she knew where he worked. So we'd just go like sit outside and wait for him to come out. And we were like, are you gonna talk to him? And she was like, no. That's so weird. Like I just show up to his work and we're like, yeah, you right. And so one day, do you need me to off We were plotting it and we said, Why don't we just like walk by him and act like we're here. I Can it off. I mean, Mav, what are you doing? I lost something in the couch. Nobody worry. Okay, well I'll just keep telling my story then. No, hold On.


Wait. Mav, he obviously wants the attention on him. What do you want? I'd actually prefer it not be on me. What do you want to not have attention? Well what do you want? Just take the bag of the couch off. There You go. Good idea. I asked to get up and you didn't. Sorry. Well, yo, sometimes my walkie get stuck. Why Did I launch Like that? There it is. His wedding ring Maverick. Is he? And That's why I didn't, he's always taking it off And that's why I didn't want catch it. Why's gonna happen? He takes his wedding ring off and he just chunks it in the air as high as he can, just gets guitar and higher. And then sometimes he'll put it on the countertop and he spins it like a top.


And one day he's just gonna fall down the drain and I'm not getting you A new one. You know, if it goes down the drain, like it's, You can just take the drain apart. You can take The drain apart and get out. Well cash. Okay. Alright. What, What If It goes down the drain? Go back to your stalker store. Alright. Yeah. So anyways, she'd been talking to the guy and we were like, you know what, why don't we just like walk into the store and act like we're just here buying something. Mind you, this was a Home Depot and we were 16-year-old girls. Home Depot are, We're just here for some lumber. Like what? So so we walk into the Home Depot and he's like putting the carts away and we walk right past him and I look at him and I was waiting for my friend to look at him, but she didn't. And she just walked right by. And he was, he had his back turned the whole time.


So he never even saw us. But we obviously couldn't walk out empty handed. So we grabbed some paint samples and walked out. Paint samples, Paint samples. The free ones? Yeah. That's crazy. You got I love those. The ones I used to collect them. I thought they were so pretty. What? What? Why do you guys like paint samples? Cute. Like, like pastels? Yes. Yeah. I used to cut, I used to collect them and they would be like yellow. Wait light pink, Pink light blue, Yellow, light pink, light blue. You both collected paint samples? Yes. And college. Oh sorry. No, you're good. If you go to my parents' house and you look in my dresser or in my like desk drawer, they're still there. I have a stack like this. No shot. That's an interesting hobby. In college, I had friends who went and got paint samples.


'cause obviously you can't paint an apartment and they would hang their paint samples and they'd make decorative things on their walls. Oh. Oh. Instead of buying the Paint. Hey Harper, what? You still never told us about this true love that you brought up. Oh Yeah. Right? Yeah. Yeah. We like talked on and off for six years, then like three. And then like when it came to ninth grade or eighth grade, it got pretty serious. So just to double back, are you in love? Have you found your true love? Is it a love? What is it? It's something honestly, I don, Oh my God. Brought up true love. You said before the podcast. She's like, I found my true love, you know. Well I did, but like at the same time there's five, six, Ashley, other guys that I think are cute and I think are better than this true love.


But this is a true love that Ashley wants me. So like I'm thinking maybe I should just go for him and then like, Sounds like you're desperate. No, no. That's just my opinion. I'm not, I'm definitely not. No. But like yeah, we've been like on and off for like six years. So Wait, are you about to tell us that the one you were on and off with for six years, you are in love with? Well I, I was in love with him, but not anymore. Yeah, not anymore. You're done With that? Yeah. I'm not in love with new person. Okay. Okay. Okay. So scratch the six year guy. Tell us about the one you're in love with Now. I Can Dude, I I'm so glad I'm not single anymore. I can't deal with all this love. Okay. The thing is, I'm enjoying it. I can't tell y'all, I can't tell y'all about my true love right now because it will spark some controversy.


Okay. Okay. Well don't give us any hints then. Can you whisper Right to me? No, wait, wait, wait. I have Questions. I'm sorry, but like, this is like one of a a like a, not a, this is an influencer and he just broke up with somebody. We've been texting. Okay. So he, He's gonna come to Texas. Okay.

But we can narrow it down though by a lot, right? With the more details you give. Yeah, I know. So please give us more. He just broke up with his ex 'cause he cheated on her. But I mean, Okay. Harper's cut up.


He's done for, but no, if he cheated on the last girl, what's to say? He is not gonna do the same. She's like, because it was with me. We're like, what? No. Yeah. So he is coming down to Texas soon. We, she just breezed over this. So this, I have a good question of this. Cont no, it's kind of irrelevant, Right? So yeah, so he, so he's coming down to Texas. We're gonna date Harper, aren't you? Actually? Yeah. Oh my God. You're gonna date But Harper. Harper. Are you actually, is that him now? No, No. That's My friend. He Cheated on another girl. What makes you think he won't do it again? He won't. Oh he won't. So the I'll do, I already told him what I'd do if he did. Oh.


Oh, okay. I'm sure the other girl said that too. She's, I'll make sure his career is over. That's a good Wait, I got a question. If, if everybody here was single and you were, you like met someone and they were dating someone, but then they met you and they were like, oh shoot, I like this person. And they broke up with the person they were dating just to date you. Would you date them? No. Yeah. What do you mean Ke You literally did that? No. Is that like a red flag or is that like reasonable? No, I think that's a green flag. I literally had a boyfriend and then I met you Red flag and then I fell in In with you. That's not, well that's not exactly, yeah because Imagine they find somebody else up me before I had the chance to break up with him. Okay, well that's not exactly how our story went because we met before. Yeah.


That's not really the same story at all. But anyway, You can have a similar story. I do go into More detail about that story when I in I book, I was in love when I met Kinzie. Oh wait, hold up. That is true. We gotta play the book real quick. Yeah. With myself. No, we do actually this is the story we just talked about. We say in the, This episode is brought to you by LifeLock.

Apply LOL Podcast book that we are writing. And it's dropping semi soon, probably within the next month. So stay tuned if you wanna Yeah, if You wanna find out how I fell in love with cash. And then why Have, dude, I got a story. I don't even know if some of y'all have heard that. I'm gonna put in the book. Really? Like I, like I almost don't want y'all to read it 'cause like I feel like y'all are gonna judge me. What? Yeah, y'all might judge me and like don't 'cause I don't read. Okay, good. But there's an audio book. There's an audio probably. Well don't audio my chapter, but no seriously, like, say, say Kenzie, you met Maverick and Maverick was dating some girl named Hannah. And the second you guys met, he was like, shoot, I like Kenzie.


And then he broke up with Hannah to date you. Would you date him? No. Why? I'll tell you why. Because there is always, always, always gonna be somebody better. The grass is always greener on the other side. That's so true. If he's willing to break up with this girl who's probably a perfectly good girl, if he hasn't already broken up with her or he's stupid and he was with a girl who he shouldn't have been and he needs time to heal and grow from that. And so if he is willing to break up with her for me, he's willing to break up with me for the next thing that comes along. That is better. 'cause there are far more better girls than me. So Maverick would be a red flag. Well what? Okay. I mean you kind of gave more of a Mature answer. I like the fact I'm Trying, I'm trying to help the people out.


Yeah. Go for this guy. Okay, well I will. Okay. Have to learn own life lessons. I I like the fact that I just picked my nose, put it in MA's face the booger and then he blew at it. What? He went Ew.

And it's gone. Okay. Well they go on a walk for like maybe five to 10 minutes. Right.


And they come back. Okay. And they open the door to their house and you're like, smoke everywhere. Wait, How? Wait, hold on. First smoke. My dad couldn't get the door to open because they have like one of those keypads, the lock on it that's electric like ours and the lock would not work. So he was like, because It was so hot, Because it was so hot. It like messed up. Gosh. The thing. And so he was like trying to get the door to open and he could not. So he like basically shoved it open and smoke just came barreling out and like hitting them in The van. The house was like 180 degrees inside. Wait, they couldn't see the flames or smoke from the outside? It was in the back of the house. That's So bad. Oh my God. Well we have, are they okay, Well you could probably see it if like there was a window. You, You wanna another There's A window on our front door, but it's like that blur the dog inside the house.


You can't really see inside the house. Mm. Listen, here's the sad part. They're going to go on their walk. Oh yeah. And their dog has arthritis. They just got diagnosed so its back leg didn't work. So they decided to take it on a walk anyways. Okay. But if they did it, they, they literally were talking about it. They're like, should we bring it? Nah, her, she's a jerk. Yeah. Her, well, well, yeah, I guess we'll bring her on the walk, see how she does this time. And then they got lucky or so they took her, that dog would've been a hot dog cooked. It would've been. It would've been. Yeah. My mom would've been so sad. Like, think about how much we're attached to Stella and Honey.


My mom is way more attached to her dog, like times 1000. So the house was 180 degrees inside. I mean, just straight cooked. Oh my gosh. I can't imagine if I got left honey inside a house than it Caught on fire. It'd be devastated if I left. It was so sad. If I left Estes in the house and it caught on fire.

Cash. There's pressure that builds inside the house with the heat. Yeah. When there's no like o like when the door's not open, pressure builds and it'll cause it to bust. It could like think if it's burning up all the oxygen in the house and that's No, you're getting too signs. Vacuum, then it might actually bust the windows inside the house. I don dunno know what to tell you. But the windows Busted here. You can play that video. Wait, you have a video? I haven't seen the video. Yeah.
