No, I just would do stretches to like try to stretch my hip flexors and then it would like it like, I don't know. It was hurting really bad, so I Stopped. Probably. 'cause you weren't flex. You should probably keep stretching. Well, I, I thought I was like Kate. I started stretching and it hurt. So I quit. Me too. Kate. Me too. That's real. No. What's it called? I, after Anna Ulce came over, she told me that if I stretch like every day for two months, I could become like, hurt. Wait, because She was my inspiration.


Yeah. She was my after, After she came on, I started stretching because of Her. I was like so jealous. 'cause she was like, you're already flexible. So if you like stretch for like two months, like every day, you could probably be pretty flexible. And I was like, okay. So I did, but, or I didn't. I kind of, I Didn't. So I took that advice and I just, I didn't do it. Do that out the window. Harper, Pull your mic closer. I'm sorry. No, You're good. It's okay. Just Don't do it again. It's Okay.

Non-believer. Theni ain't no way. Kay has for the longest time since I've known her, believed in this conspiracy that Helen Keller was fake. Not a conspiracy. Helen Keller is supposed to be blind, deaf and Mute. This Is so and mute. Pretty much. Cool. She Is not mute. She Like screams.


Oh yeah. She's screaming like, yeah her teacher's name was Harper also. But somehow she wrote a book. She did a bunch of these things. So yeah, She like Wrote a plane. Wrote a plane.

I'm a firm believer that they made up the Helen Keller story For little kids to be late. I don't, I, Okay. Yeah. Okay. We know I think Helen Keller was born and she was a real person. Yeah, we know. But I just don't think she was 100% blind and 100% deaf. I think she had a little tiny bit of one of those sensory things. I heard that she like used letters and water or something to touch it. Letters and Water. No, I remember reading a book about her and it was like she used water. It was a hoax and it didn't make sense. Did You just breathe on me? Ky done Still. You can't touch him yet.
