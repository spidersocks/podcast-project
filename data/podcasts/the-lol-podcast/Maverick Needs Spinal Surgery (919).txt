Like I just don't complain about it all the time. There's no point. You didn't mean to hurt your feelings. We're just messing. Y'all didn't hurt my feelings. I'm just saying like, y'all always talk like, oh, like just go to the doctor and get the surgery. But it's not like I Can just go like, y'all don't think I think about that like all the time like I do, but it's like it's gonna change my entire life. Yeah. And it's not just like tenant a very expensive surgery. It is expensive. It'll cost to make sure to subscribe so we can afford it cash. But no, I cash, I'm not saying that in a like a mean way.


I'm literally just, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm leaving. I admit that in a good way. You know, I, I'm staying. I'm staying and I'm gonna be good. I just said I'm fine. I just like, Are you okay? It's just like not knowing like even if it's gonna make me feel better or anything like that after Yeah. It's just like a, a thing that I like. I've, I mean I've thought about it for like 10 years. Like I know it's coming. It's just a matter of when I have to get the surgery. So I just don't really want to like, I don't wanna talk about it anymore. We can talk about something else. Well, when the time comes, you have at least me. And if we're still living with Kate and cash, then they'll Well you changed my diapers, But you won't need diapers.


I will. You Are not gonna, I can't get up and go to the bathroom. Stop diaper. You're not Gonna diapers. Stop joking around diaper. I'm being serious. Someone will have to change them. Well, Okay, if it comes to that. Yes. I'll change your diapers. You will. And cash will carry you up the stairs. Promise not the diapers. So whatever reason you can't walk for a little while, we'll put you in a wheelchair and I'll dance in a wheelchair with you. That sounds horrible. Maybe don't say it like that. Don't dance in a wheel. I'll be in a wheelchair. Well, well if you can't walk for a little bit, but you're gonna learn to Walk. You would learn fine. I don't want to be in a wheelchair. But you would learn, you Would be a walk again. Dude. It, it would be the best option for you. And it's like, I don't know. I mean I know it's like easy for us to all say just like, oh, it won't be as scary.


But like obviously you're the one that's gonna have to go undergo like a super intense surgery and like completely change your body. But I mean, I think you know that like you have all of us and you have great parents that would help you in any way, but, and you're gonna have a wife soon that'll help you. It'll be fine. It's just like, you know, it's just one of those things in life that's just like, you don't plan for it. And it's like not supposed to be like this, but Yeah.


But God, God built you to have scoliosis. No he didn't. Yes. No he did. I'm sorry. But he did. And you are just born like that. Thank you. That was really sweet. No, I mean I think we know that God didn't build you with scoliosis. What? Like No. Okay. That's Not I'm naughty Lego set. That's not what I meant. Why is cash crying? What? Why is cash crying? Wait honey, what happened? Why are you upset now too? He cares about you. It almost looks like it.


Whoa. Is that why you wanted to walk off a minute ago? Yeah. Wait, no cash. Stay Here. I know why he's crying. Why? It's because after I get the surgery I will be taller than him. Man. I Need to go check on him. Hold on. It's, he's, he's very self-conscious. He wants to be the tallest person in the room. If y'all haven't noticed Mav deflects any sadness or pain or anything with jokes, it's gonna be okay. It's okay. It's fine. Guys. Surgery or no surgery? It'll be Okay.


It's fine. Well, I mean, I know that like, okay. Is he okay? Yeah, he's good. You'll always, you'll always have me. No, I won't. It's true. When we get divorced one day, there'll always be Harper. What? Sorry, what? What did you just say? I saw that statement. She's a child. What would she Do? We're not getting divorced. I'm Just kidding. We're not getting divorced. No, that's a joke Bob. I I really am sorry for like, anything that we've said that's upset you. No, y'all upset me. Y'all are fine. It's just like one of those things I just don't like to think about. Let's not play with the lighter. Yeah, I know. Is cash coming back?


Does He I don't, I mean I talked to him but I think he just wants a minute. What's wrong with him? He's Just a little, I don't know. I'm fine. I mean I know I've talked to cash about it before just 'cause it's been in conversation. Like it'd be crazy if you got the surgery and stuff. But we've talked about how it would like change your life and stuff and like obviously as your brother, like Just knowing like the rest of my life, like I won't be able to tie my shoes is like just gonna be like frustrating. Yeah. And I think that that's why he's kind of upset is 'cause he, I mean obviously it's cash. He doesn't show his emotions like that but like he Has. But I and him do everything together. We play basketball together. Juujitsu like, we just are always like wakeboarding together. You Won't be able to do jiujitsu together. Yeah. Like it'll be just him by himself too.


So I know it affects him too, but Yeah. Well not the way it affects you, but I think it really does scare him. The thought of you going through that as his brother. Some of those things I Can still do, but it's like a risk because like if my back one of the screws like pops loose, then I'll be like paralyzed and like if I'm paralyzed in the middle of the lake, that's like not a good place to be. Yeah. I could drown. Yeah, that could happen. Yeah. So You could drown. That's true. I just swallowed this lip stuff and it's hurting. Oh Yeah. That's plumping glass.
