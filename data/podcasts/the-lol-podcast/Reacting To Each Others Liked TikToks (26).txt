I said, I said, but in the meantime, like I said, it's super important to post. You can Congrats on 1 million February 27th. He texted me on February 5th. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Well, well What did your mom say when you came to him and you were like, mom, this TikTok will DM me and he wants to do brand deals.

I'm gonna have to hop on this girl's live stream to get her to message me back. And I did. And I was like, Hey, I sent you a dm. And she's like, cash Baker's trying to slide into my dms.

I was like, cash is trying to slide into my dms. And all the comments on her livestream was like just weird way easy. They like, Hey, what's he doing? I was like, no, no cash Baker. And then I was like, oh, he's trying to join. Okay. And then I like, let him join and then you're like, hi. And, and then Harper was like, who are you? When I came on? No. And a week before they actually sent me a video before I was ever like even popular on TikTok or Anything. That is the craziest Coincidence. That's the weird thing in the world. My sister saw them at Chili's and she was like, oh my gosh, these are like, like these viral tiktoks.

And then a week later I started becoming viral on TikTok and they deemed me. Yeah, like what the, you could say We were your inspiration. All, all you needed was that video. Yeah. It was like when she saw us saying hi to Harper, she was like, this is what I wanna do. This is my time. This Is my time to shine. What was y'all's inspiration to start TikTok? I didn't have any inspiration. I was forced. Shout out Paul Zimmer man. He, he is man I none of y'all know who Paul Zimmer is. Probably now. It was, it was way back in the day. But Back in the day That's, that's originally why I dyed my hair too.

I trying really hard, you know, it's actually just mean, just straight up rude. I feel like y'all should have more followers than you. You know what's rude? What is Kenzie and I are actually like trying our absolute hardest to run our own YouTube channels by ourselves because everybody is so focused on Kasha Maverick, the podcast, everything else. What that, that was really rude. Maverick And Kenzie and I are trying so hard and we have videos ready to be edit.


I've edited, I've got four videos, But they just keep giving all their videos. The podcast and Cash and Maverick, they just keep giving them to our editors and cashing or Kenzie and Kate. I Can edit them. Keep getting pushed down at the bottom of the barrel. I gave my video to the editor and he was like, oh, it's gonna take at least two weeks. I have like three things that Cash and MAB want me to do. And I was like, of course. Yeah. So Kenzie are now taking applications. Okay. Editors. Anybody at Cash Baker? Okay. I'm sorry guys. I sounded like a brat. I'm sorry. For what? Apology not Accepted. Which day? Well, which day Are you talking about? The follower thing? Yes. Did hearing any kids, did you talk how, how we're like, you know, struggling?


No, I sounded feel, I sounded like brat because I was like, I was like, It's okay Harper, whenever you think you have a lot of followers on TikTok, just remember I have tripled that you YouTube av. That's not true. How much does Mave have? Like 13. That million. Th I have 13. So Cash. I actually forgot how many all of us have for something. 13 Something. 1918. 18 something. 19. He's been at 18 for two years though. Yeah. Well at least I'm at 18 so Well Wait. What are you at? Doesn't matter. Four 6.26. 6.3. 6.7. 6.6. 6.1 6.5. Yes. Okay. I missed, I literally went through the whole count.


Wait, what's our Cash and Kate account at Five? Wait, it might gone up 6.6. No, our cash and Kate account's at 6 million. I think the hard cost is at like 8 million something. And you should know all of those followers were already there when it was the cash and MA account cash. 6 million. Yeah, I know that. No, no, no, no. I'm just, I just, I just thought I put that it's crazy. Yeah. Fun fact for you guys. The LOL Podcast TikTok. Okay. Used to be a TikTok called Cash and Maverick. We had our personals and we made a account together called Cash and Maverick. We don't say that though because like people, and It gained like 8 million subs. And then we didn't post on it for like three years and then we started the podcast. So we switched it to The LOL Podcast. It had Seven. They lost verification because of that. You know what I'm thinking now? Why didn't we switch the Cash and Maverick Instagram to The LOL Podcast? Because it's verified.


Oh wait, if you, if you switch your account name on Instagram, you, your verification Mark taken away. I think You got it taken away live on TikTok though too, didn't you? Huh? Passion math. Wasn't it verified on TikTok? And then you lost it 'cause you Switched it. No, no. It was never verified on TikTok. Dude, getting Verified on TikTok is like impossible. Are you verified? Was shot In the dark? Honestly, I'm not verified. It took them, They had like back when TikTok was like, even like when you guys had like 7 million on TikTok, that was like some of the highest followers. Like, 'cause it was just, that was when people were like popping off on TikTok. You guys were like some of the biggest creators on TikTok at the time and they couldn't get verified. Ah, like TikTok just would not verify them. True story. Yeah. Don't think I'll ever get to a million. Yes. Nope. Y'all are like, oh, I got six and three and five Kenzie.

And You know what? I brought honey on here. Hi honey. And did you know what happened this morning? What Guys? You know this morning else you should bring On Honey Jack on the couch. That's what happened this morning. No, I was gonna tell you guys A singer, Honey.


Literally this morning threw up bye all over the couch. Wow. Good. Good story, bro. No, she didn't throw up all over it. It was just like a little bit. Then she got all mad at, she got a all mad at me when I had the audacity to put her in the bath to clean the throw up off of her body. He's being all rude and stuff. You gave her a bath personally. Daddy did. She just didn't know. Weird. Yeah, she didn't know Honey. And then row up Is Disgusting. I know. And then, and then also at the same time, after Honey threw up, Stella came into the kitchen and knocked her bowl over. And so the dogs both bath this morning. That Ain't okay. And then Kate charged my card $35 for a dog bowl. I did. Because your dog broke my dog bowl, so I had to give him One buy 35.


But that's crazy. Who buys a $35 dog bowl? Somebody wait. You wait, wait. Stella broke something. So you charged his card for Well, I Told Kids, said, I'm gonna buy you a new one. And I was like, okay. I mean, yo, I need a dog bowl. Can y'all sing $35? Dog bowl is kind of crazy. Can we not agree That? No, it was, it was. No, no, no. It was two. It was a set Was I think she bought more than a dog bowl. Wait, it was a set. It was like, it was like two dog Because Oh, Stella broke two dog Bowls. No, she broke one, but And You bought, bought two. Well, because it only came in a set, I would've brought one. You gotta take advantage of it stuff. You can, I mean, you, your dog shouldn't have broke the dog bowl and you wouldn't had to buy two more options. So if I have matching cars and, and you crash one, you have to buy 'em two. Well, no, because You can buy the car separately. You couldn't buy these dog bowls separately. It comes in a set, it comes as a water bowl and a dog food bowl together.


And they were matching and they fit on the little holder thing perfectly. So I had to get, I mean, I Really feel like I'm getting scammed here. You're so readable. You're so readable.
