And then another time I was on stage at a live show and I was given a gift and it was a box full of crickets.


And also a dad ate them. Yeah. That. No. And then everybody complained about the crickets afterwards. Whoa. Whoa. Are we upset or something? I don't get it. Nothing happened.

I didn't know it was in the box. Okay. She didn't know. But that doesn't change anything. She's my wife. So she's partially responsible what she Is. Because I really thought like something was under there. 'cause I saw that thing and like I saw plastic and it was so weird. It did look deadly. I threw a couple things in there. The fragile logo. I mean, that doesn't look good to, to open. Like, that's a lowkey. Scary. When I like started opening the box over there, that's when I was like, oh wait, so Kate has to see it. And then it was fricking blue earphones. Man, that was so good.


We should do this more often. Oh, what? I have something we can open. What? Hold on. It's in the attic. I'm gonna get you. Listen, I have a present for one of you and it's actually a good present. Who wants it? Well get it from you. Oh, I want it. No, no. Who wants it for real? Not me. I don't want that one. I think Kate wants it. No, I don't. I don't want anything. I want it. I want it. Give it to Me. Okay. No, I actually have something and I've been waiting for it to give it to you guys and I've been hiding it from you guys. So I put it in the attic. Why it in the Attic? Because I was having to hide it from everyone. And the only place no one goes around here is the attic. Dude, I'm, I'm kind of excited. Can you go get my gift? No, guys, I'm being serious. You put it in the attic? Yes. I, I bought a gift to give someone on the episode, but I had to hide it from everyone, so I put it in the attic. Okay. Who is It for? It's for anyone. But seriously, I need you guys to nominate Who wants the gift?


Me. Me. Nominate me y'all. You're Telling me if I actually nominate Kate, she needs a gift right Now. I'm not. No, I'm not doing that. You wasted space in the attic. What do you mean?

Do Space the entire guest closet as well. You technically Do have two Bedrooms. There's a third guest closet if you would like to use it.

We're looking for land to put other houses up on so we don't all have to live together. And we, I don't know if your husband is actually trying to figure something out. He looks All day, every day. What are you talking about? Whoa, Joe. Every time if you go look at his most used app, it's gonna be Zillow because he's just staring at his phone all day looking for land.

Do you See the the settle? Eh, He does want to. No, I meant like a, I don't wanna move to like freaking Europe.


I wanna move like locally. Yeah. And that's what we're looking for. We don't, we we don't have the luxury of moving away three hours to a small town and just doing stuff there. We have to be in a big city. And I think we all know that trying to find land in a big city is expensive and difficult. And trust me, Kenzie, he has been looking at land since before you and Maverick started dating. He's been looking for a long time. He looks all the time. Oh, she got her. You. It seems to be a problem then, doesn't it? What do You, what If it's been over a year? Crazy. The problem is crazy. Nothing comes up. Nothing comes up. The land that comes up, five acres is a million dollars. Do it. And you know that, that's not reasonable. God, we can't just drop a million on five acres. There's, there's literal stretch marks on my ankle.


What happened? No, no, that's not stretch marks. Sweetheart. That that right there can, no, that's not kales. No, it's it's shins. Actually, I've seen that before. Shins. Really?

I'm gonna start vacuuming it all up. You know what's gonna happen? Okay, So, oh, you think you're gonna clean it up all by yourself? I think that I'm going to probably initiate the cleaning and then if other people see me cleaning, they will help. Sorry, how is that silhouette? Oh, sorry. Keep going. I, I don't understand what, what you're talking about. Do you? I feel like Kate, Kate thinks she does all the cleaning. I don't think Ooh. I know. Supposed to go with, I wouldn't say nothing. Right. Okay. Well I don't think I know. I just Remember I was supposed to go with, I said that Kate does think that she's better than everybody else. That's all I Say. I don't think I'm better than everyone else. I don't know why you said that. I thought that was the most ridiculous thing ever. Wait, you said that. So no matter makes the mess, you are gonna clean it up and you're gonna be Everything.
