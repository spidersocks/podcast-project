And say, okay, those people are not real. They're not real people. No. and they're not real names. Mave doesn't think people you meet on cruises are real. They're not real. Why? Because I went on a cruise. Remember I think I told you about this. I went on a cruise and a butter knife and I met a kid named Sam Fisher and Richie. And Richie was Rich. Is your daddy coincide? He was very rich. He took me to the candy store trying to not Did you think? and I was like 12 years old. He took me to the candy store. He's just getting whatever he wants. and I was like, dude, this is gonna be like a hundred dollars of candy. He told me to get whatever I want. So I I I, I got some stuff. Sam Fisher got some stuff. Richie got some stuff and that kid ran up that bill and he just swiped his parents' cart like nothing. He was like, yeah, this is like my fifth cruise this year.


I'm like, what? Anyways, I hung out with these kids, the whole crew, Sam Fisher and Richie, Sam Fisher, happy to see you out there. That'd be crazy. Sam Fisher could be seeing this and Mav doesn't believe that they were real people. Okay. What else did Sam Fisher and Richie do? Maybe they can like, 'cause we need to find them honestly. Well, I mean it's pretty specific. If your name is Sam Fisher and you went on a cruise about what, what year, what date? About like 2016. Yeah. If you went on a carnival cruise that lets out a Galveston Carnival Breeze. I think mine was Carnival Dream. Really? That's the Carnival Magic's. Nice one. Carnival Magic was our cruise Carnival Magic. Yes, sir. Oh, carnival Magic. Yeah. Car of a, that's like the good one you went on like the R. Yeah.


Okay, so Point is Cinnamon Richie Rich and fricking whatever Pink sugar person you said. Wait. Yeah. What was Sam Fisher? These aren't real names. So Sage was a boy. He was like, I can't wait to do edibles when I get home. And then, no, Sage was so funny. I loved him. No, he was so funny. That was me in the candy store, bro. I was like, I can't wait to eat on this. No. So Sage was a boy, saffron and Cinnamon Saffron. So, and we called them Saffy and Cena and they were my best friends throughout the whole entire cruise. And then, and you know, it was fine. It was fun and, and I tried to go for Sage, but I, for I forgot that he's actually, you know, I can't say that. Okay.


Yeah, that's good. Don't, okay, moving on. She Learning? No. Wow. I'm like lowkey kind of. Okay. I'm very excited because I've never gone on a cruise before. You would love it. And to all of you people who are like, Cass is such a bad husband. Yep. Go ahead. Tell him Kate, tell him It was so sweet. Tell Him what I did The other day. I was like, I was doing stuff And I walk into my room and he has like a little gift on my vanity and a little, yeah, Like a picture you wanna show or something. Or with the Back handwriting. What? With the back handwriting. It was Cas handwriting. That is fun though, isn't it? Yeah. When I read that I'm like, Wow. I thought I didn't know what it was. Anyways, this was the, I'll text this to you Alex, but this was the gift.


That was on my vanity when I walked in. It was a little note that said happy late anniversary. 'cause our anniversary was like three weeks ago with a Diet Coke and a little gift bag. And I ripped the gift bag open to see what's in there and there's a gift card to Barnes and Noble. Yep. And I was like, oh honey, that's so sweet. Like, I love, love books. That's it. Oh dollars aren't you so sweet. And Then I was like, I was so excited. I had a $50 Barnes de Noble gift card. Like, let's hit the road Jack. We gotta get going. We gotta get to Barnes de Noble before they close. So I'm like, you know, put my shoes on, getting ready to bounce out the house. And he's like, wait, look in the bag again. And I look and I pull out a note. And. it says you need books to read on your cruise.


'cause he knows that I've never been on a cruise and I've been wanting to go. So he is taking me on a cruise right after Maverick and Kenzie's wedding when they're on their honeymoon. And I'm so excited. Yep. Guys, I'm in a trouble. That's Kayla Yo. I was in the middle of like, no, no. Soaking in my righteousness here. Okay. Anybody would like to d me up? No, no, no, no, no, no.

Anyways, for while Harper's going through it, I'm gonna continue my thought process, which was Nobody by the way. Nobody say her name anymore or else then we just gotta bleep it more. Yeah, But my thought process was that when you go on a cruise at that age and that age, you like fall in love on the cruise. And cash tells me about the club you went to on the cruise with the girls, with the, Okay, what's the I don Dunno if this is inappropriate. Whoa I. don Dunno if this is an appropriate topic to bring up. Wait, wait. No, hold on because I'm your brother. And I was also on this And I know pretty much everything about you.


So would you like to tell me what information you're withholding from me? Yeah. Maverick. See, Maverick was old. He was like, you know, he was older than me. So he did, he went to like the different, we were like a part of the kids groups or whatever. Wait, are you saying Club as in the little kids club?

I was like telling my mom I wish KK Ma, we here.


Like, I'm so scared. No, I literally said that. You asked my mom. I Would've gone if we had been invited. If Nobody Choice Awards, nobody kind of upset that we weren't nominated for like one of the best podcasts. Well, Well next Year is I don know. If that's the same this year, we should have been nominated I don know if that's an Award Category. I dunno if that's in a category or an award They have, but they need that because as to far as to my knowledge, there's not many other podcasts. So that be So cool to go up on stage next to Adam Sandler. Like what? Adam Sandler was there. Yeah. Dude. If I get, like, if we get nominated for a Kid's Choice Awards next year and we win and Adam Sandler's there, I'm gonna dress up like Adam Sandler. Guys.

This looks more like Gerald's coffin. oh my gosh. What? Hi. Unfortunately I have some sad and serious news to share with you. Wait, is it a cop? The last dinosaur you called Gerald was in fact a double agent. He pretended to be the real dino, but I have insider knowledge that he was fake.


And this one is the real Gerald. Yeah. The people. The people who destroyed fake Bro was like curb stomping Gerald's face his face. The people who destroyed fake Gerald are your friends and were trying to protect you. Since I'm sending you ridge real Gerald, you need to guard him with your life. Hence the case that caused 20 times more than the dinosaur itself. I bet this case was expensive. Well that makes sense because you know it literally a while ago we were like where the frick is Gerald? Which is actually kind of concerning that Gerald's actually gone and now here's jail. How did we know Gerald was in there? I don't know. I have a feeling this is fake. No, this got shipped to our house. It's imaginary.

It says it's a bunch of different poems but We have to mash. You think they go together? I don't think so. Cash got a new dino one morning with what? What?


Maverick can just called Kate a bus, which caused quite a bit of fuss. She f frowned with dismay and had so much to say. Now Maverick's treading with hush. Okay, you called me a bus Probably.

Not with armor. Okay, what that All, right. So Wait, I think, What do you mean they go together? There was once a woman named Kate. Oh, I have those who didn't care much about fate when the dinosaur fell. She just shrugged. What? What the, okay. Oh well I think that's enough of these. And continued her stroll feeling great There once was a fellow named Cash whose farts were his thunder splash With each noisy bout his friends would clear out and he'd laugh. A ye old grand gas flash All. right. And that's the, I love that. That's the end. So. they got my fart to thunder. Nah, nah.
