When you look at me, you know that's an alpha male. Oh, Right now? Yeah. Yeah. I don't even have to say it. That's a, when I walk out people know I'm Alpha, I'm a man.

I don't have much makeup on though right now. I'm gonna say one of The two of Them.


That was like the biggest roast you did to them ever. That was crazy. What Are you saying today? I feel like Harper does The most, no, no, just Who do you think is the better makeup artist? I Feel like Harper. 'cause she plays with it so much. Like she spends, she spends a lot Of time. No, I think you're really good at makeup and kids. Kenzie Judging Makeup. No, no, I Know. Yes. I tell you right now. Harper sucks. I'll tell you that. She's no good. No. Harper Is like one of those girls that like, I feel like we will literally put on a full face, be like, I like it. And then take it off just to do it again. Just 'cause she likes it. I mean told That's, I do like getting ready. But Like one time, you know what? You wanna know what Kate told me one time, what she was like, Remember when your arm was, was getting less cute In, you know? Yeah. Told me what? That she said. She said Harper put the same thing on me twice.


Remember that? Oh, when we were doing, oh, when we were doing our makeup video? Yeah. You put like, It was like, are you saying she did it wrong? Yes she did. No, no, no. I was just Confused. Oh my goodness. Oh no. Wait, what did I put on twice? It was like Concealer or something. It was like two different types of concealers. Yeah, she needed it twice apparently. But yeah, maybe Harper just like, oh, she needed it again. I have a Friend who does makeup for like weddings and stuff and she puts concealer on twice the normal skin color. And then she knows a, like a lighter one. I just thought it was interesting. See, I told You Harper knows more about makeup. I just thought it was industry. None of you three said yourselves. Oh, I don't know. What do you think you do a Poor job at? Well, Harper's, just being humble. Kate and I both said Harper. No, I don. Wait, What do you think you do a poor job at with your makeup? I really try to get that like, I have like super like dough eyes.


Dough eyes. What Is a dough? Eyes. I have dough, eyes Don't like this. Like berry, like dough, like Peaberry D boy. What? I Can deer in the headlights. Like, No, I like, Oh, bag ice. Like Kay has dough eyes. You've siren eyes. I want siren eyes. What Are siren eyes Like? They're, is it like This? What's a siren eye? No. Kay has more siren eyes too. I think. Well what are they? Can you describe what these are? They're Like almost, they're like almost like, like, like like lifted. Lifted eyes. The Shape. Think they more like rounded shape. Oh, Okay. Yeah. And mine are super of rounded. I don't like it. And I think I wanna like big Round brown eyes. I Got big round brown eyes. No, no. But, but yeah. And. And I'm the only one that has, are you okay Trying to do them?


I getting cold. Wait, wait, what do you mean? What eyes do I have? Dough. What about Maverick Dough? Definitely. Okay, wait, look. Normal math. Dough. Dough. So everybody here has dough. Besides, I'm just dough boys. Nobody loves me. Okay y'all Boy, dough reminded me of brownies. And brownies reminded me of the story. So I gotta tell it. Now we are y'all. Oh my goodness. This is a crazy story. Yo, Kenzie is cooking brownies. Y'all for me. What? She's a reminder. She's cooking brownies for me. No, obviously she opens 'em up to everyone. No ma. But well first of all, that was my box of brownies she made, I allowed her to my Box of brownies, Kate. It was Kate's box of, okay, so somebody said, Hey, can I make these?


She Said, Hey, you wanna make brownies? And I said, yeah. And she said, can we, 'cause we were both in the kitchen doing stuff. She said, can we use this box? And I was like, yeah. Okay. Anyways. But I remember her down there before she even asked you. She said, do you want brownies? I said, yes. Okay. Anyways, I feel no matter who box, she trying to make it sound better for herself. It's bad. Kenzie cooks these brownies, me, Matt, Alex, Kate, Kenzie, all of us eat a brownie. Right? And there's still like half the brownies left. They literally were just pulled out of the oven. They were still hot. It was like five or six left. Kate goes, we should just throw these away now. Right? Because everybody had a bite. And we were like, they're literally still warm. If you throw 'em away, they will melt the trash bag. And she was like, yeah, but just nobody needs to eat any more brownies.


'cause that's just not good for anyone. And she tried to throw away all of our brownies because she didn't want to eat any more brownies. Well, I thought she tried to put the whole house on a diet. We're still making it sound better than it was because Kenzie paint the brownies and for me. Yeah. Then Kate comes out of the room is like, we should just throw these away. Right? Listen, I, everybody in our house, I feel like we can all agree that our sugar intake is insane and it's bad. Sugar is bad for you. I'm not one of those people that's gonna sit here and say, oh, we as much sugar as you want. Sugar is bad. Okay, well respectfully, you don't have to eat sugar. Where's my a and w? No, I Just assume that like, we all know we have way too much sugar, so we should maybe control it if, if everybody had a brownie.


So I was like, oh, if everyone's had a brownie, like just throw it away. We don't, If someone ever makes brownies, what are you doing? You not throw them away. Okay. I won't. I was just trying to help everybody. I want us all to live long healthy lives. I need, how are you closing? Just throw away. No, I need my, I'm texting my Y Wait, hold on. What are you doing Matt? You're what? I'm not missing. He's trying to make not Doy eyes. What's that called again? No, But yeah, I make, I try to make siren eyes by going in with this like dark liner underneath, but it ends up, oh yeah. I end up accidentally crying during the day. Same. Yeah. And so then I'm like, what? No, I found out I'm allergic to eyeliner. Like I used to love putting black eyeliner like on my waterline. It makes your eyes look bigger, but like literally my eyes would water and burn until I took it off.
