I just said something crazy. The comments wanted to be heard. Is that why you waited to show me those until we were in front of five cameras with about a million people watching? Yes. Because I wanted the audience to know that they're being heard. Sometimes public embarrassment is the way to go. So it's about publicly trying to humiliate you. I actually asked cash. I said, should I show it on the pod? He said yes. Yeah, that'd be me, my dude. It was your idea. You were just looking for verification from peers that this was a good idea.


Why is she trying To talk about you Embarra? I just said that You basically just pulled a pur reviewed paper. I mean that's insane. What, what does that Even mean? Why is my constructive criticism? I feel like Kenzie doesn't like it. Maybe if I had any, you know, I'd say it off the pod to you. Like a, a nice person. That's cool. Kenzie. Do you not like it when they beef? Huh? Do you not like it when they beef? Kenzie told me I had to be nicer. I did say that's the truth. Oh wait, why'd you tell him that? What? Why'd you tell him that? Because You're trying to, you're trying to make me say that he was mean. No, I'm not trying to confused. She's like, I'm not saying that I the rest of your son. No, I'm just asking. Why'd you tell me he had to be mean?


What'd he do? Or why? Oh, Just in general. It's like a just a weekly thing. Oh, just weekly conversation. He just A mean person. No, He just hurts Kate's feelings. Yeah. Yeah.

Were you scared earlier when You walked downstairs to garage and my mom was Oh. Oh no. Only, oh really? Wait, I have a question. Yeah. Mav. Yeah. I need you to tell me what I Can do to fix myself. I can do it And do it As your sister Paul, you're Still, you can still worry about her self-help journey. All stop worrying. Listen, I am, I am on a journey to better myself.


Okay. Do that. Me Too. And I need your help. No you don't. You Are the only person that will be extremely brutally honest with me in this household. You think? Yeah. Can you walk on your knees while you do it though? But you'll just think I'm wrong. That's what, absurd. I don't think so. Yeah, you will. Whatever I say you'll just be like Aaron. He's stupid. No. If it's valid. Yeah. See if it's valid. You say and then we'll all vote if it's true or not. Yeah. Matt, I need to better myself. We all live together. We all work, work to be better today. You dragged gone for way long than You can just it 'cause because I say we're not gonna talk about it. You guys keep pestering me until we talk about it. Ma, you literally did every episode content. Come on. I think Kate is a great person. Oh my God. Good job. So proud of you. What The, are you, are You telling him not to say this right now? Are You encouraging this? I'm Encouraging him to not be rude. Yes. But Is it rude or is it something that I could genuinely fix?


Oh, I don't know what he is thinking, but it's probably gonna be rude. Kenzie thinks the same thing too. Don't let her be. Okay then I need to know if it's something. Because we all live together. I'm a firm believer that if there's something wrong, we all need To talk about it. And I need to be better because something's obviously wrong. So what is wrong? You know Maverick well enough to know that he's probably trolling you. There's probably nothing at all. And he's, Yeah, once, once he said Kinzie thinks it's two, I figured out it was a troll. Oh no. It's not a troll. Yes it is. Mom, Be honest. I Can do sound noises. You see Dramatic. Didn't think at all to just get under your skin. He's just like, oh no. If I say nothing, she's gonna think she's the worst person ever. She's thinking of all the horrible things she does in life and ooh, that'll really make her feel bad.


What? That's inside an average break. You like, Woohoo. Feel bad. What does he do to you? Kenzie? If there's something this is so dramatic or noises, keep it coming. Okay. If there's something I Can do to fix being your housemate, what is it? Mm. Do I take up too much room in the fridge? That's not what I thought that was going. Me also, also that might have been the baddest statement ever heard in my entire life from, for Anyone I was looking at. I lowkey was like, dang, I got a lot in there compared to this. Kate. What? Like, it's not like, it's just, let me put it this way. The, the, the problem is you, I'm gonna get in so much trouble for saying this.


All right. The problem is you look at things from a perspective of like, not that you're better than everyone else, but like what the, but like, oh, things just got good. Is he I'm here for the drama. Yeah, but like, like, you know, like let's say He's Like trying to make up stuff to not sound bad. It's just getting bad. Let's say somebody does something and you do something but you don't even know the other person did something. But you know you did something I lost. So you're just gonna assume person did nothing. I lost. How do you, you have a talent for losing people. Oh, are you saying like, I clean and you were Sitting like throughout this whole time you've even made lots of statements. Like, oh what do you have a problem with me being your maid?


Do you have a problem with me being, I do clean A lot. Do you have a problem with me? I do clean a lot. Good things You do. So, but you what? You did it name. I don't think you was like, oh Maverick, do you have a problem with, you know, maybe this thing I do or, or maybe this other thing. I do aware you only the good things 'cause you think you're perfect. I don't think I'm perfect. I was here for the drama at one point and now I would do anything to not be here. I what you're saying but I don you don't get what he, he's that made no sense. No, I do makes no, no. He's saying makes, he's saying like she thinks She's better Than everyone else. I'm aware that I do all these things. I assume that nobody else does anything. See not true. I don't think that What Not true. Is that what you meant? That is not true. See, I actually Tell think she's better than everyone else. That is not true. How did that say it?


Say it one more time. Because I am aware of what I do. I'm aware that I will do like Clean this or Exactly. See that's exactly The problem. Do that. Okay. But because I know that I do that he thinks that, I assume that nobody else does anything. Okay. Yes. See she's very aware of everything she does. She even said it in her own statement. Yeah, I am. But I'm also aware of the things that other people do too. I'm aware that Kenzie worked for days to get the spreadsheet for The LOL Podcast. All of our stuff organized, which is something we three have never done in the last year and a half of having a podcast. And I'm very thankful that she did that because that is not something that any of us wanted to do. Oh, I'm cooked. So cooked. I'm aware ma, that you take care of things for the podcast and you are making sure that thumbnails get done.


I'm aware that cash is doing the same thing as well. What? This guy, I mean I do that all lot. I not every day but I You no, I I hear him talking all the time. Do we have the thumbnail? What are, what are we doing today? Do we have this Figured out After I reminded him. What the Well you still, he's getting stuff done. You're getting stuff done. I'm aware that everyone's getting stuff done around the house, whether it's work or house. What? Okay. You're right. You're right. I didn't wanna hear about any of this. I told you you're Right. What doing on your phone over there, Harper? I'm stealing information So hard to think of bad things about People From who Have you ever stolen information? Yes. What? What Do you mean? Stealing information? Oh, are you trying to get into like identity theft? I know a guy. Perfect. Okay. They tried to get Kate today.

Yeah, I've been stolen from multiple times, but I'm not Bring it up. Well there was a time, middle of the night I used to steal things. He did. I remember one time he stole a bunch of candy. I did. And he had to go back into the store and return it. I thought it was free. He Did do I think it was Free. I did. Did two one free to everybody that gets caught things, they tell the police officer. Dude, I thought the car was free. No, it was stealing. Tell you something. I thought puts a candy bowl. A candy bowl at the checkout counter.


That's Valid. I did the same thing. Yeah. What? And people not assume it's free in individual packaging. Yeah, like the Little bumble Gum. Was it at a gas station? No. Yes, It was at a, it Was at a And did it have a little sticky note that said dollar cents per candy thing? I don't know. But if you can't read, you probably did. If you can't read, you can't see. You assume it's you were old enough to read. How old were you? How would I know? What do you mean? How would you know? He was like 15. No. How, how would I know? Because it was a long time ago. Yeah, But he was like 15. He was like, at least like seven. How old were y'all when y'all's dad started putting cameras up? Not old enough. First of all, what did your dad do? Because I don Dunno if that was normal.


What are you talking about? What do you Mean? What do you mean? Our dad putting cameras up. Your dad, dad has cameras everywhere. 'cause people break onto his property. CI wish he had cameras pre like when we were like pre at home still not pre at home. Whatever the word I'm looking for. I wish he had cameras when we still lived at home because, So we did not have cameras when you were at home. That was my question. And y'all failed to Answer one time. There was this guy, well it was the middle of the night. I believe it was like August 31st. Wednesday afternoon what? Wednesday evening. Sorry. And this guy while we're sleeping, starts breaking into our garage. Oh, garage. Wham. No, he's breaking into our garage.


It's not even part of your house. It's, It's literally like right next to my house. What do you mean? Yeah, it was a close call. Yeah, he breaking in the garage could could've been me next. So has anybody's house actually ever been? We we're, that's what we hear inside. We're like, oh gosh. Was it your garage? Someone's breaking in our garage. So then my dad comes out midnight in his underwear with a pistol? Yes. Oh. And, and he starts shooting it in the air saying, I'm gonna kill you. He's running around saying something like that. I don't know his exact words, but he was running around just like saying, if I see you, I'll kill you. And then the person takes off running and he starts shooting at the person.


Good Boy. Kate, what Would you do? That's what I do every time. Dude. Kate, what would you do if you were like out in the garage for, I don't know why you'd be in James's garage, but if you were in James's garage at one in the morning and then you'd just see him walk outside in his underwear. I'm gonna Carry underwear If you, if you show your face, you're dead now I'm put you six foot under. What would you do? I knew I inherited it from somewhere because every time I walked that garage I shouted the exact same thing but nobody was there. But I was always scared there was I'm gonna kill. So every time I'd have to go out to Garage. Do you have pcsd Me too time? We have to go out to the garage at night by myself. Keep in mind we live in the country and our garage is not attached to our house. It's like a football field away.


So I would have to go out to the garage, turn off the light at night every once in a while and it was dark 10:00 PM 11:00 PM sometimes pushing midnight. And then I would be terrified and I would walk around like in a 360 walking outside and I'd be like, I know you're out here. I know, okay, I'm gonna hurry you if you come out here. I got a gun. Imagine being down though. And then as soon as I would hit the light to turn off the light in the garage and the button to close at the garage door you ran, I'd book it back to the house. That's what I do in my bed. But imagine being the the lar though, on the other end of that. And you just hear a little like 10-year-old boy, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get, I know you're outta here. Honestly, I'd be scared of a little like 10-year-old boy.


He's like, I gotta go out. Go get you. What? What does that for? Alone? Like A smell too. What's crazy is smell like a bitch. He's Ash. I remember watching him out the window and he'd be literally walking in circles. Yeah. And this guy was, and not a good sibling at all. I'd be like, Matt, please come out there with me please man. Dudes. What is smell? So smell? Yeah, I does smell. Wait, what are talking? Somebody's cooking something that smells bad. Whatcha are cooking? Hello? Popcorn. That smells horrible. Yeah. Popcorn. Not popcorn, Not popcorn. Cook That. It's crazy. Anyways, that No popcorn. I was, what was I saying? Oh yeah, I'd ask Matt. I'd be like, Hey man, can You, can you do me a sod and walk out here with me? And I'd be like, as like the good brother I was. I'd say, no, there's bad guys out there.


Why would I go out there? That popcorn smells so bad. And I was like, Bri, I thought it was like, and Every once in a while he would tell me, fine, I'll watch you from the window. And then I'd go, I'd be like, you know what that'll do. And I would Go outside. He's like, you got my six. And I'd be like 20 steps out. And I look back and he's not out the window. And I was like, ah. Do you feel terrify? Do you still feel that way sometimes though? Yeah, He def, I mean he definitely runs back from putting the trash cans out. Sometimes doesn't, I'd be lying if I say we didn't go on a camping trip last summer when when I had to go take a wee, I ran back still zip on my pants bro. It's just, oh we did, You really, people don't understand when you got PTSD S from really terrified. It's terrified because this guy took me out in the woods in Colorado where there are bears and elk and you know what the elk make?


Woo Sounds like ghost Around. No sound like you know Ghost. It sounds like ghosts are all around you. And it's like, oh come on, hurry up pee. And Loki did sound like screaming women just all around you. It's like, oh whoa. That's what sounds like. That's what it sounds What? And you're like, oh do do it one more time. This is what it sounds. And I'm just there with my pants. But once you're in that magical, nothing can touch you. Sounds tent that weird. When I was in the tent pretty close. I was like, even if a bear comes, he ain't getting through my tent. I always had so much faith in that tent. Dude I had, I had a dream the other night that we went to Montana and went camping and Nope.


And it's actually grizzly country not doing That. So are you down this year to go to grizzly country? No, I'm not down for you to go anywhere to do that. K, I'm asking you a question. I could ride a grizzly. What the you a ride. I heard. Lemme tell you a story about a grizzly. I have a friend. I'm sorry. Do you actually have a story about a grizzly because that's kind of crazy. Yes, yes. And I'm about to listen, me and Matt have had this conversation for the last like two weeks every other day. I swear It doesn't count if it was at a zoo. No it wasn't at a zoo. Okay. It is in the wilderness. Okay. And Maverick just thinks that he's invincible and he's never gonna die. Haven't died. Not even once. Welcome to my life One time. Stupid. Stupid, stupid. Anyways, I have a friend who goes on hikes and does all the running things and all the nature, whatever, I don't know.


Yeah. And he has a group of friends and two of his buddies went camping one time. Okay. And they're in separate, in separate tents. And as they're hiking, they like pass this family. They have like children. So they're like oh, nothing of it. Right? And the dad of the family says, Hey, like I don't know if y'all are planning on, 'cause they had their packs with their tents in them. He was like, I don't know if y'all are planning on staying out here tonight, just be careful. 'cause we did see a mama bear in her cup. And when a bear has cubs, they're more aggressive. Okay? And so they're like, okay, yeah, yeah they've gone camping like their entire lives. They were the boy scouts or whatever. And now they're like 24 years old. Oh that bear has no idea what's coming for them two boy scouts.


I mean I'd Be scared I that Bear. My point is saying that is they've gone camping a lot, which the two of you have not. So What? Whoa. Y'all are just a step below Them. I've been solo camping at the lake Nearby. Anyways, lemme finish. What The they they go to sleep right in their separate tents. 'cause they have just one man tents. See that's a no go. You can't do that. If a bear's gonna attack, you must be in the tent together. Everyone knows that. What? They're obviously not very good boy scouts who the world would sleep In their own tent anyways. Listen. Who would carry, Do tent? Listen, what if you, what if you get love me at night and you want to cuddle, listen tent go. This is a serious, This is a serious thing. Y'all can't be joking about this.


This is serious at that, that night. I the knock on his door and everything. Sorry. A bear attacked the one boy in the one tent. See? Yes. And the other boy, If he was in the other guy, stop laughing. He would've been fun. Yeah, this is real. I'm not if she's Being serious. Stop making jokes. I'm being so serious. Oh really? Yeah, we Should talking And the bear's like attacking this boy and the other boy can. Did he make It? No, he doesn't make it. But the other boy, okay, really sorry about the kiss. They're like 24 years old y'all. Okay, so y'all aren't special and You can die from bear or anything else. Jumping off a cliff. Cliff in Montana can kill you. What are You joking? He Attacked. Wait, continue this story. Yeah, Continue please. Okay. Anyways, so the bear is attacking his friend and the other friend is asleep in his tent.


But obviously he wakes up 'cause he hears what's going on. And he said all, all You can do is just like You can like smell everything and You can hear his friend screaming. Oh my gosh. And but he can't do anything. 'cause if he gets out of his tent, like you're not running away from a grizzly bear. Which smell what the bear because it's like their scent is just so strong. Oh my gosh. So his friend is just sitting there dying and he's just having to lay there and wait because if you leave then you're screwed. You're done for dude. And If I, if my best friend was getting attacked by a bear, I was told I would get outta my tent and help her. So this guy says that until the bear. So his buddy's getting killed by the bear and he stayed in his tent. What is he gonna do? Get out. He gonna kill turn if a bear has you, you're done for Yeah the bear.


You're not stopping the bear if he's already attacking somebody. Unless you have like A gun. Bang. Did they have a gun? No they didn't have a gun. Yeah, They're really not very good boy scouts. 'cause I would never go into bear country without a gun. Well that's what happened. So you're not gonna go tint around. They They were in Montana? Yes, I will. No, I think I don't remember where they were. Okay, I will go in there. But I will bring, The Guest is calling. Maybe I should answered. Nah, Just wait. Maybe next time Just, just text them. Okay. What was I gonna say? Oh, I was talking about your PTSDs d You were gonna ride a bear. Yeah, I was gonna ride a bear and then I was gonna kill a bear and I forgot.


I remember my, we were talking about getting robbed. Oh yeah. Think up. Getting robbed. My car got robbed one time. We lost our gun. Yeah. And guess what? They stole my stuff. Yeah. Stole his stuff. They broke into Matt's car and stole my stuff. Shouldn't have left it in an unlocked car man. And they stole our friend Michael's stuff. Everything besides math stuff. That's crazy. Yeah. But math still didn't learn his lesson. Learn my Lesson. My house got broken into one time but it ain't, they didn't like steal anything except they tried to steal my uncle's identity. What? And that was fun. What? What do you mean? Wait, hold up. So they went in there and was just like, where's the social? No. Yeah, actually What? What I remember and I know you're jerk joking earlier and you're like, it's on August and Wednesday and blah blah blah blah blah.


Nope. I remember it was in November and it was Wednesday. Wait, people actually broke into your home Wednesday are dangerous. And they were trying, People break y'alls parents stuff all the time. No, no. They broke into your h your house though that you were currently living in. Yeah. With your uncle. That's why I'm scared of the dark and Maverick makes fun of me. Wait, hold up. No, no. Tell the story. This is good. Somebody's Here. Whoa. Hey Peg, can you get that? Wait, tell him that you're the reason our house smells bad. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Tell the story. Seriously. There's Mustard whatever where? Oh. Oh well it was Wednesday and on Wednesdays our house cleaner came over. Okay. And so my mom disassembled the alarm, not disassembled or whatever turned off the alarm so the house cleaner can come in and we don't have these anymore 'cause we've remodeled.


But our house at the time had like glass windows, like sliding glass doors and sliding glass doors are really easy to pop open, like pull off of the track and just open and then put back. So You can easily break into them anyways. Okay. I've in second grade it's November, it's Wednesday. You were Little It and yeah and I've been scarred for life ever since. This is fun. A long fun story. Do we Have time for this? Make fun of her for it. She's no, we have time. Don't worry. Well do we have time? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Okay. Not have good any guess. Anyways, so this guy, he like goes to Walmart, right? Well, before he goes to Walmart he's tells his mom, he is like, hey, I really tell, He tells his mom.


Yeah he, you got this whole guy's background story. No, yeah, yeah. No, the whole background story. What? Because he like reached out to my parents afterwards and like tried to apologize but ah, Sorry I broke into your home. I didn't mean for you to catch me. What do you say to that? This Is such a long story though. I should have started at the beginning. Yeah, Go back. Okay. I mean the beginning of the podcast. Okay, so he, he tells his mom, he is like, Hey, I'm gonna do something bad. The guy's bipolar. He has issues probably. So like he just, You have a lot of stories with bipolar people. I, I do. That's not good for me probably. Anyways, so he is like, I'm gonna go to Walmart and do something bad. So his mom calls the police. Imagine if I told you that Mav, I'm gonna go to Walmart.


I'm I'm gonna do something bad. I'm gonna go to Walmart. Y'all. It's gonna be bad. Y'all make jokes outta things that should not be jokes Continue. Honestly. Yeah. What? Okay, sorry. Yeah we should stop doing that. It's definitely The LOL Podcast. Last time we do that, the guy got killed. Okay. This is the Very, I'm gonna try to go fast. You're taking my fine. You keep interrupting. I'm sorry. Okay. So he goes to Walmart, his mom calls the police. Okay. So the police are on their way. But before they can get there, he has like stolen some stuff from Walmart and then he runs out to get to the quickest car possible. And it's an older gentleman and his older wife and he like pushes them to the ground and like backs up over the wife's legs. Oh my God. They're both fine. He just broke her legs. But they're fine. They're alive. Oh my God.


He backs up me and leaves with their car. 'cause he is trying to get outta town, right? Well there's only like, it's a small town so there's like four ways outta the town and if you can't get through those four ways then you're done. So and so they had, the cops had already blocked off the roads and he he zo Yeah he pulled over by the Whataburger. And the Whataburger in our town has like a pond with a little fountain and there's like a creek that runs from the pond and the creek runs all the way back behind my parents' house. And so he like parks the car by the pond and he like takes off and somebody who was working at Whataburger called the police and we're like, Hey, I think like that guy that y'all looking for, we just saw like, I don't know if it's him but like somebody just pulled up randomly and just started like walking through the woods back behind the creek.


And so the cops trail after him and they're like go. Also meantime, me and my sister are in second and third grade and my mom is teaching first grade. So we're all at the same campus. Okay. And then my little brother and sister are babies. So they're in daycare and it's the middle of the school day. And while all this is happening, y'all know, I don't know if y'all know this, but Harper and Kate probably do whenever they have like lockdown drills. Yes, yes. And you have to like get underneath your desk. Yes. Where you hide against the wall. We did that from like eight in the morning until school closed at 3:00 PM that day. Why? The guy was, the guy was like running, they didn't know where he was. That's terrible. And it's a small town so like Walmart is just a mile away from the schools.


So anyways, they shut all the schools down and basically we just kind of like hid the entire day. Wait and what did he do in the beginning to like make the whole town shut down? He said he told his mom, Rob Juan ran, ran over grandma what? Annie told his mom he is gonna do something bad. Yeah, well yeah that'll do it. So they're just searching for him. And also the couple had a gun in their car. Oh no. And they reported that and when the cops went to the car they realized that it was gone. And so we had taken it with him on the creek. Okay. So we're all locked down in school and my mom teaches first grade and in first grade they hatched chickens. This is kind of like a side story but I just think it's kind of funny. They hatched chickens as like a science project in first grade.


And so my mom had like 10 chickens that had hatched and she brought them home like the week before. So we had just like a little box of chicks at our house. And so my mom was joking with her, like other teacher friends that day like, oh hopefully he breaks into my house and steal those chickens. And they're like, oh Jenny, don't say that. And she was like, oh no, I'd love for him to take those chickens. That'd be great. Anyways, that's a side story. And then the cops, so after he's run through the creek back behind Whataburger, the cops are like trailing him and they have dogs on his trail. Oh That sounds so fun. And With the dogs. Yes. Yeah it does sound fun. I think we can get Stella to do that. Probably not. I think so.


Cash. We should test it Out crazy. You gotta find a bad guy at Walmart. We Can make 'em trail cash. Anyways, so the dogs trailed them up to our house and the cops check all the doors in the front door and the side glass doors and everything is locked. So they just move on. They keep going but the dogs lose the trail. Meanwhile he's inside trying to become your uncle. Yes. Wow. Wait. Whoa. He wasn't your uncle in the first place? No, I'm sorry. I'm a horrible Storyteller. I was keeping up. Okay. Anyways, So I'm sorry. He's inside. He's about to be her uncle. Just wait, He's inside the house. Okay. But the cops don't know that. So they're looking at throughout the rest of the neighborhood, like trying to figure out where the sky is.


If anybody else has leads, it's a whole day pursuit. Okay. So by the end of the day, do I not have any more time? Oh No Kate, you're scrolling on her phone. No, I saw something and I was checking it but it's fine. Okay. By the end of the day, the school day, my mom and we all get in the car and we are heading home. And also a little side note, my grandma had picked up my little brother and sister from daycare. There's a lot Of side notes. Well It's, it all makes sense in the end. I promise. I promise. Okay. She picks them up from daycare and me and my mom and my older sister JC are in the car heading home and we're coming down the street and there's cars everywhere. Okay. Also, when I was younger my dad worked in the oil field so he was always gone.


My dad does Too. Side note. Well kind of, I'm sorry. I'm Sorry. Not the same but kind of. Oh, my dad like worked off for months at a time. Oh. And so he wasn't in town. And my dad has a brother named David who they're twins. So it's like cash and Mav, they're like best friends and brothers. That's how they are. And so if anything were to ever happen, my mom would call David. Yeah. And before we left the school, David called her and was like, Hey like tell me when you're about to head home because I wanna meet you to make sure like everything is okay with this like guy running around town. And she was like, oh I'm fine like it like he's not gonna be in our house, you know? And so David's like, alright, well just call me to tell me.


So she calls him, we're headed home and as we're going down the street there's cars everywhere and my mom is like getting all giddy and me and Jce are in the backseat. We're like, what's happening mom? And she's like, oh your dad is so sweet. He just came into town, he's throwing me a party. And We're like, oh This is so fun. And as we get closer to the house, you realize all the cars are cop cars and you see David at the end of the street, my uncle, my real uncle and he is like telling my mom to like stop, like don't come forward towards the house. And my mom's like, oh, like why are there so many cops here? This is crazy. I didn't really know. I knew that many friends that were cops. That's Insane.


And so she gets outta the car all happy and she like walks up there and now this is her point of view 'cause I don't remember any of this, but she told me all this. She walks up to David and she can hear someone yelling. Jenny, Jenny, please tell me how old were you? You I was in second grade. Okay. So okay. Like eight, seven, something like that. And the cops walk up to her and they're like, Hey we found this man in your house. And he's saying that he's David and he like has all the information on David. So similar how like Cash probably has like all of Maverick's passwords, all of his information. Maverick probably has all of Cash's stuff. They just have a lot of information about each other. He had gone through my parents' desk in the office and had gotten like all this information.


He had looked at all these pictures with people's names on them so he could tell you exactly who was who. And it's a small town so all the cops in the town know our family. And so they were like, we don't think this guy's related to you, but he sure seems to know a lot, lot about your family and like he can point at pictures and know exactly who's who and what their name is and all these things. And, and so my mom was like, Yes. See? So I, I know this one David. Hey I'm David. I know I changed a lot but anyways, so So this is like a freaking crime that like takes weeks to like plan.


Yeah, no, but also he was wearing completely different clothes from what the people had said that he looked like the bad guy looked like, because while he was in the house all day. Oh he took David's clothes? No, my dad's, he had taken a shower, like made himself breakfast, ate He was the, the CO said, is this guy Psycho? Yeah, he was really playing the role. He's like, I gotta feed my chickens. Yeah, well He was waiting for somebody to get home to have like a getaway car because he has his gun and all he has to do is have somebody walk in the house and be like, get in the car, we're going and You can just hide in the floorboard while they pass the cops. And that was his plan anyways. And it's crazy because my grandma was supposed to get home like just minutes before all the cops arrived.


But there was just like something in her heart that she was like, ah, I feel like I really need to like go to the grocery store for some reason. No, my grandma does not live in the same town that we live in. So there was no reason for her to go to the grocery store at all. She had my siblings in the car with her from preschool. She just felt like doing it. Yeah. She was like, ah, might as well just take them to the grocery store. So she goes to the grocery store, she doesn't buy anything but whenever she pulls up my, my mom was like, where have you been? And she was like, well I was gonna come home and I went to the grocery store and anyways, that's just a god thing I feel like. Yeah, I know. That's what was about to say. She could've easily pulled up and he would've gotten in the car with her and who knows what would've happened. But anyways, so this guy's like saying that he knows my mom and my mom was like, I don't know this guy.


Like he's insane. That's crazy. And so the cops take him to jail and like a month later he writes my parents a note saying like he's so sorry for breaking in and like he has all these like mental issues and stuff. But yeah, for the whole day he just spent the day eating food, taking showers, using my dad's razor, putting his clothes on. That's crazy. This guy looking through all of our stuff literally broke into your house and trying to impersonate your dad literally using his razor and everything to try to literally that's be part of your family's. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty crazy's. Insane. But anyways, ever since then I have not been a fan of the dark. That's valid Of the dark. And that's why I'm scared of the dark. Yeah. See nothing like that ever happened to me. I just didn't like the dark.


Well you should come up with the cooler story. No, everyone should be scared of the dark. It's just like you should be like, if you can't see oh, One of your gone. Wait another side though. That's kind of funny. After all that happened, did you take the chickens? No, he did not take the chickens. He just gave me the dirtiest look I think he has Ever made. I meant what? Imagine you come home, he eat us, cooked the chickens for reakfast. You like, what was your side note? Kenzie, that's not sad. Like, you Know when you're in the middle of something like really bad, you, you're like really focused on how horrible it is. But then weeks later you look back and you're like, oh that was kind of funny. My mom like weeks later she was like, dang it, he didn't take those stupid chickens. And anyways that's, that's end of the story. Well good story.


But anyways guys, say you so much for watching this episode. Sorry it took so long. No, We'll see you next time. Peace. Peace.
