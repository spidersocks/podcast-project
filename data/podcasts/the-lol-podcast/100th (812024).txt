I have Realized though, that I actually have the best chair on the podcast because the other day we were playing Gang Beast and I was sitting on the couch and I was like, Hmm, gimme my pink chair.


Sounds like your chair is comfy. Gang bouncy. I love my chair. Listen, I feel like I'm on a trampoline. I'm just gonna say all y'all should be grateful for y'all's chairs. I I hardly ever even have a back rest. You Know you love your chairs. I do like this chair I gave, if I ever get hungry. He's, he is a, he's a birthday cake. He's sitting in a birthday cake. If y'all couldn't Oh, Yeah case. Not a cake. I'm the cake. Take a Bite out of it. Can I, can I have a bite of your cake? No, I would but you just pour water all over my cake. Well you were on fire.

The I was You run your mouth like nobody else here. that Is a hundred percent. Okay. I was think I was thinking it. Okay.


Yeah, just sit down there for the rest of the episode. Yeah, it's Definitely you. You never let anyone talk. And if you try to talk, you usually just interrupt us. That Does happen a lot. The least amount probably Kate maybe. Yeah. And then the second to least Probably you. Me, the second to least. Yeah. oh, Yeah actually Harper it. Sorry. It goes I. Guess, I. forgot. I forgot. I gotta get my word count down. Yeah, you're already maxed Out. Actually at the top it goes. Cash Maverick Harper me. Yeah, but all lowkey. That's Weird because you think the girl, oh sorry. The Girls talk more. You're okay. You're allowed to talk cash. It's not a bad thing that you talk the most. It's just sometimes Annoying. A lot of bad things have happened in this house too. From the club video. Like this room. So many things from club videos to this. So many. Yeah. So these like our carpet Destroyed.


No, you guys don't understand that. This used to be just a nice little like cute upstairs living area. There was these windows Give a nice Pan around. There was, we had a couch. I don't even remember what it looked like. We had a tv. You could just come up here and there's supposed to be windows behind this wall. There's three windows behind the wall. Yeah. Oh. And this, this so much natural life. Oh. I'll tell you my worst memory of The. LOL Podcast history. Oh. Oh. And me and Alex were fighting. Me and Alex were getting pretty mad at each other. What? Wait, what? Oh, oh, oh. I know, I know. 'cause when they decided that, 'cause for those of you who don't know, the first two LOL podcast episodes were filmed in a studio. But then we were like, the studio was like moving.


The lady was selling it or something. so we were like, well we were not gonna find another studio. Let's just recreate it upstairs. That way we don't have to pay a fee or anything. so we put some, we spent some money and recreated, yeah. The studio. However, do y'all see that white brick wall? Yeah. That didn't just get there by itself. No, it didn't. I built it. Maverick built it. Yes. Then wait, you got on a behind the walls windows. that is a completely fake wall. Yeah. That wall you're looking at is plywood with wallpaper on it. Yes. But that wallpaper man, Oh man. I will never wallpaper again in my life. Especially not with that guy. If anybody ever needs to wallpaper anything, do not ask me and Alex, because We were, I'm not even capping guys.


It took them probably like two and a half days. We were so irritated because if, for some reason this wallpaper was printed so bad where you, it doesn't just line up. You had to find the matching brick and line it up with each one. Oh gosh. Like you see how you think it would go horizontally? The, the the, the stuff. No, it goes vertically. Yeah. So you had to line it up with each brick, not lines. So this brick, the paper was probably like don don't know. Freaking 12 inches, 18 inches long. So, They would be like, like this big A strips and stick 'em on. Yeah. Yeah. All that whole wall is about sometimes even smaller, like This big. But then also the wood is like slightly uneven because of the, like, what is it? Even mounting or something? I don't even know.


It's just, yeah, it's, it, It's slightly un, un uneven. So then there would be little gaps. There's like little gaps in between the wallpaper. And me and Alex would like try to do it and then the other one would try to like change it. It was irritating. Yeah. But shout out to me and Alex and halfway Maverick for that wall. Yo. Yeah. and I built That wall too. Wait, he should Do I get no credit? What the, because You, I, I was building that wall. You specifically sat there and watched me and said, it's not gonna fit. It's not gonna fit. It's not gonna fit. and I said, I measured it. It will fit. It will fit. Yeah. And let me tell you, it did take, it did take me and Alex and Cash to raise that wall up. that Is a tell You that is a heavy wall. That wall is very heavy. Also, Maverick does not have a bedroom door.


No more bedroom door. I'm worried that when, now I'm worried that wall's gonna just like fall down and kill someone. Well, I have it like secured to the wall, but not like amazingly. Yeah, no, that definitely could wait. Our house is, so I also helped with both of the walls. No cash stood over us. What? The, and like micromanaged, but didn't touch anything. What? He would just tell us when it looked bad. He'd be like, mm. Change it. He'd Just run his mouth. Like usual Wait's. Kate. Why were you angry with Alex? What did he do? We just couldn't figure it. It wasn't that we were mad at each other necessarily. I. It just frustrated. It was that we were both trying to do it and we couldn't figure it out. And, it was just like, no, it goes like this. No, it goes like this. No, it goes like this. Okay. Did, Y, allall scream at each other. No. But. we did walk away a couple times.


I was like for like, there'd be times where I was like, whatever, Alex, you do it. and I. No. There's been a couple times I thought we were actually gonna burn this house down. We had the smoke alarms going off. So many fires, so many things. oh My gosh. The cops got called on us. I, yeah. Twice. Filming Queen Bee. Yeah. Both times. Both. Two days. Both days. The cops showed up? Yeah. Or were y'all Inside or outside? No. Queen Bee was, we were, luckily We weren't in the house when I was On fire. I see what you're saying. Yeah. No I mean the Yeah. I mean that desk is like immensely burned from Yes. We lit a cell phone on fire. We threw a cell phone in a microwave. Lit that on fire. What else? We lit on fire. We lit on fire. A doll. Cassius head, Just now Cass's head.


Not on this channel, but on another channel. It's odd. It's odd. We poured gasoline all over a hoodie and then we lit it on fire. That was, That was ago. One got taken off. YouTube. That was, and I ran and jumped in the pool. That was so dumb. I can't Believe Yelled able to that. and I was completely on fire. Yeah, we were like 16 there. Did it hurt? No. so we soaked it in water first, then we poured gasoline on it. don Don't know why. Like who does that? Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. That was very dumb with us. But. we were like 16. That's funny. Wouldn't recommend. No. I did not get hurt. Ran like 10 feet and then jumped in the pool. Yeah. But you, I literally took like four steps and then jumped in the pool. Wasn't something I'm putting myself on fire. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. That was something. That was So funny. Yep. That's unfortunate. Yeah. YouTube did not like that one. Luckily the house has not been burned down. No, I've never been in a house that's on fire.


That would be terrifying. My Parents' house is caught on fire like two or three times. How does your house catch on fire? Three times. Okay. You know what's crazy? What? I know house fires are obviously very dangerous and a lot of people don't make it out of it, which is very sad. But I just feel like every scenario I'd make it out. Like, unless I'm sleeping, you wouldn't. If I'm sleeping, I'm gone. There's no say in that. But can't you just always jump out a window? Not at the window is like engulfed with Fire. Yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes you're trapped in, there's like All you want So. what? You just dive through the window. I not work home dog. I'm just gonna dive. Yeah. Sometimes I Think what happens, wait, hold on. Y'all don't think I can dive through a window?


Not if it's not open. Yes. I can. No bro. You would just hit, you're just gonna go. What are you talking about? You need the glass. You're not gonna shatter. I'll shatter the glass. No you're not. I will shatter that glass. No, you, you know how hard it's to shatter like a window of a house. Not that hard. I'll run straight through it. I did not did a cartwheel through my parents' window.

Secret Stop Cash. I haven't told y'all secret about this one. Hey Cash. Let's stop that please. Oh, What the, no, so out. So basically when we were filming the Thanksgiving episode, I remember I had to pee so bad. I was like, oh my God, I gotta pee. I gotta pee. But I was so scared to ask to go do the restroom. What? So I Why like, don don't know. I just, are we That scary? We're seeing Video. It's not like a podcast can just stop recording and go No. and I remember, I remember when we, we were, we ate the popcorn. I was like, I have to pee. So I couldn't even chew. I was like, Why would you not Harper? You can add why you're allowed to use the bathroom. Wait, I'm confused. Why you can't swallow and having to be at the same time that I, I was in pain, physical pain.


I had to, I don't understand women in peeing. What I can do that yesterday. She goes, we are joking around. She's like, stop. I'm gonna pee. Well, I already had to go to the restroom. But. we were in the middle of doing stuff and then you started making me laugh. So I was like, hold on, hold On. I'm Gonna gonna pee. Yeah. I don't get that. And then I had to go to the restroom. Kate has Peter pants so many times from laughing and just like two years there. Oh, I've done that a couple times in the podcast. Those are always good. Wait, you feeded yourself on the podcast? Oh, There was actually, wait, wait. Did we ever say the time what happened with the raccoon? How? oh, Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. The possum. The possum. Wait, can we say, yeah, I'm gonna say it. Yeah. When Matt trapped a possum. We already talked about this. Yeah, we already talking. No, I know, but don don't think if we, this was my, this was actually not my favorite episode, but my favorite thing.


All moment of last year. Moment in life. Favorite moment in my, Probably this was a topic on our first date. Wow. It made the, it made the first date. He was so, no, not proud of it. I was like, let's per se, cash puts a po. A rat, a possum. Oh, it was in your shower. oh, Yeah. Would you be okay with Oh? wait, why were y'all talking about That was I need to know if she could take a joke and if, or if she'd be like, no cash can't do this kind of things. I think he, in general, he just wanted to know if I was gonna hate you or not. Oh. Because he was saying like that all of y'all are a package deal or whatever and would you want to live with all of us? And I was like, we do crazy things like put possums in each other's shower. Yeah. so we wake up. No, We don't. We do not. We're a group here.


Okay. We wake up. Kate doesn't use the bathroom. I hear, ah. and I was like, oh my gosh. Like I literally thought she died or something. It was so Seven In the morning there. And she's like cornered in a room and there she's yelling, pointing at the shower. There's a possum in our shower and she's freaking out and I look and our floor is just wet. And I'm like, what? Why the frick is our floor wet? Yeah. And she's like, I peed. She peed all over our floor while she ran through the house. Left a chair Like a dog. And. it was like an excited dog. It Was like a trail. There was literally like a trail of pee all through the bathroom, all through the Bedroom.


I was like, listen, I'll get the pasta. But you are getting the pee doing that? No, she comes to my room and I put this in there at like 2:00 AM So by the time she wakes me up at like eight in the morning, she's just throwing things at me. And I'm like, I'm like, oh no, whatever you think I did, I probably did. But why you hit me? Why are you hitting me? It wasn't, and then, and then about after like 20 seconds, I remembered what I did. and I was like, ha. Okay. I don't understand though. How did he go through your bedroom door, through your bedroom, into the bathroom with a possum in a cage, set it in the shower and then sneak back out without Sean? No, no, no. That was for the TikTok. The first take That was, That was for the TikTok, which was like a reenactment of it.


The first one I carried the possum by its tail into there. oh my gosh. Set it down into the shower. He think he's him. He wasn't even in a cage. Not even even thinks he is him. and I was like, I was like, yeah, she would've got rabies for that. I was literally thinking, I, I was carrying it. Wait, actually don't people die from rabies? I was like, yes. Yeah, don't get rabies. I was like, I don't think possums can get rabies. Yeah, they right. Do what I don. They Do. I don't, don don't know. They're Foaming of the mouth. They don't eat like meat like that. They eat insects. They probably do. Okay. Anyways, this possum, I'm sitting there and I'm like, cash told me to not, because I told him I might do this if I ever catch a possum. He was like, just don't let it go in the bedroom. Just put it in the shower or something. If you ever did that And I was like, okay. But I'm sitting there like the bedroom would be a lot funnier if I just let it go in the bedroom.


That's if that thing bit one of them and they got sick, They wouldn't bite them. Yeah. If we get rabies, rabies I. It didn't bite me. I'm pretty sure it's like a 99% death rate or something. You would've been it for real. You would've been real sad if we would've got rabies. Let's look it up. I'm sure rabies. Yeah. If you get, if you get bit by a wild animal, you need to go get a rabies shot. Like in year brother Murders. Brother's wife with rabies from poss what, you Know that's, theyre not immune for rabies, but they're unlikely that carry it because of they're low body temperature. Those people that you know, like murder people. Like, I feel like that's a solid way to do it though. Get an animal with rabies and let it go in their house while they're sleeping. God's not a solid way to do No. Like You're, you get your rabies shots. I feel like you wanna get caught that way. No I mean my brother had to get one. What? The rab shots? Yeah. 'cause he got by. Why'd you bite 'em?


No, 'cause he got bit by the raccoon. Remember? Oh, so my, my brother was saved by a rab shot. Yeah, Let's go. Yeah, He's Awesome. That's that 0.1%. Michael Knows Zach. oh yeah. No, he, I don't even know if he, they don't, well they don't know like which animals like raccoons and stuff. They don't know which ones carry 'em. So it's just like anytime you get bit, go get a rab shot. You Don know what I want bro. I want a baby raccoon. I've seen so many people raise baby raccoons and they turn into adult raccoons and they act like a dog. They are cool. I want one sell that We had a friend who That are a squirrel. I really also wanna raise a squirrel. I everyone who had a Raku Too. Yeah. And. it would take things And. it would go hide them in its little hole. Yeah. One of our friends figure your keys.


Her brother like, Oh That's not fun. No Racon run around with your keys. They Always knew where it was. They'd like go over to a toll and there'd be keys and spoons and shiny Things. You get everything in the same spot and they always grab shiny stuff. Yeah. Is that true? Yeah. Yeah. That's actually true. I heard, or I read it in a book. I can't remember that. There's actually a raccoon trap that hunters would use where they would stick their hole into something. They'd stick their hand in a hole and they'd have something shiny even it that they can't pull out. So they'd stick their hand in and they wouldn't Let go. No way. Why are you? And you could then you could come up and like get them like you you, you'd catch them. 'cause they wouldn't Let go the shiny things. Are they like little leprechauns or something? They shiny. Wait, why do they want shiny Leprechauns Shiny I.


don. Why they do that? Because it's, they're gonna eat shiny stuff. Are they just like shiny things? Their hands too sparkles before They eat. Wait, they, I'm pretty sure they're like Their hands like with soap. They're over there. Wait, wait, Wait, wait. That was soap but they wait, what did come put 'em in water or something? They clean their hands. I'm pretty sure before they eat. So you're telling me they go over to the pond and they're like, they gotta wash up first. Ready for dinner? Oh, there's my shiny spoon. I mean Wash up before Shiny Spoon. Yeah. I I wanna raise a squirrel or a raccoon. So bad. Squirrel. Preferably. I think a squirrel would be pretty cool. A squirrel. But I mean Harper. If I per se person caught another possum. Yeah. Would you want me to put it in maybe someone's shower at your house. Yeah, That's fine. I mean possums are cute.


Yeah. Also, I dare you to do this And I, just think it'd be a funny story if you put it in Reese's shower. True. What? Do this and Let go do this and Let go. Please do it. Do it. You do it. Okay.
