The amount of time she runs into a wall, she'd be like a new world record. She Poops herself. Oh my gosh. Kate was sewing her quilt the other day in the extension cord from the sewing machine to the wall was right by the back door. And Kate let honey in and her back foot got caught on the cord And she was like, And she ran in place like Scooby-Doo No, she literally, literally ran in place for a solid 10 seconds because she was so scared.

So you taught her not to speak. Do not speak. But yet she said you taught her not to speak. And how to say Mom? Okay. Yeah. That doesn't add up. I Didn't teach her how to say mom.

I Think Stella knows my name. Dude, look at her like she's trying to act like she's not here right now. Wait, try to say like, try to make her say your name.


She won't. She doesn't do it. You think she's just gonna say Kenzie outta nowhere? I'll tell you what, if she does say Kenzie, we're about to be rich. Come on, say it. I have a friend whose mom is an animal control cop. And so she deals with animals all the time. And she took in this little chihuahua when it was a baby and now it's like 10 years old. But she can tell it to go hug people. Oh my what? And like, like she could point at Maverick and be like, time Out. No, no, no. I see mam. Ow. What? No, you think a little Chihuahuas walking around like, no, I promise I She walked, she walked out. She's like, where my hug at? Where at? No. She's like, where At She'll Point at whoever she wants them to hug and she'll be like, go hug Maverick. And the little dog will jump down, run over there, jump up.


And she just places her paws on either side of The neck. Neck and just lays down. I thought Chihuahuas were like tiny. So like clearly were C They're tiny little devils. They bite every chihuahua I've ever seen. It is like, they're like, ah, don't pet it. F Yeah. Literally a Chihuahuas and dash sounds. They're like, Especially in the movies, all the chihuahuas are like mean. They're like, ah. Chihuahuas and Dash hound. I swear. Swear all of 'em are possessed. Even just, even just a couple days ago, me, Mav and Pap were filming a video and this chi or this dash hound came up. Dash sounds really? Yeah. It was like a weenie dog. Yeah. And it was midnight and we're just filming this video and then this dash hound comes out nowhere and They Say, Hey, I don't think You're saying Right. A dash?


No I think it's, huh? I think it's a wiener dog. It's both. It's both. It's both. I want a dash pound. His dash wound came up stalking us like, and then the owner come by and was like, oh don't mind cowboy. I was like, Cowboy's about to bite my ankle. Can you get it? And she's like, oh, he just wants to say hi. That dog did not wanna say that. All dog owners are like, he doesn't buy it. And then he is like, yeah, Then we ignore him for like 15 minutes and suddenly this dog sneaks up on us and the owner just goes, he wants to say sorry. And the thing's so tiny, I don't see it's dark out. I'm like, what did you say? They go, he wants to say sorry. I'm like, sorry for what? This thing's about to bite my ankle snuck up. Sorry. I'm like, whoa. He doesn't seem like he wants to say sorry to me.


You know, honestly, hey you know where we didn't go on tour but we need to go. Oh I know North Korea, they are open for tourism now What? You can go wait. Really? North Korea. That's, that's what you was gonna say. Really? I Don't think we should go to North Korea. I'm actually learning something on that right now. Yeah, no it's tourists A place. No, it's a great place. I vacation there. No, There's no forced people to go to our shows. Oh my gosh. Wait, how many people would go to our show in North Korea? None of 'em. They don't have any money or photos to watch. Yeah, they don't have like Access photos to watch, watch access internet because they, No, they don't. They would not have any clue who we are 'cause they're not allowed to use it. But you know who might know who we are? King Jaun has 30, 30 little Imagine. King Jong-un just watches the pod.


Dude. He's like, that's my favorite show. Wait, you wanna see Necklace being a, what's it called? An animal control officer is probably the most terrifying job I think that I could ever have. If we ever do one of those YouTube videos facing our biggest fears, that should be mine because I would hate to be an animal control officer. Why? I don't like dogs because they scare me. And even Stella scares me every once in a while. What about honey? You don't remember the time when Stella, she was carrying something in her mouth. Then she would show me her teeth. Like I, I thought she got possessed for a minute and I, I started walking away. I was like stuff nose. So no. And then she just had a ball in her mouth and I was like, oh no, she, but now dog, that doesn't scare me.


No, you're good. Because Honey's like barely a dog. Honey Does have teeth. Is Honey's a dog? She's her own individual. Okay. Why is, see that's why dogs scare me sometimes. Why is it sitting like that now? It is probably about to say, mom, look at it. Are you sweet baby? No, it's about to be like Kinsey. What does the baby say? Oh, go lick it. Oh, take me to the four Orlando. Yeah. No, but imagine being called out on site. Say me. Imagine you're the guy they call and they're like, Hey we got an angry pit bull that's going to kill everyone right now. Could you come get it? No, I don't wanna come get an angry pit bull.


And I think those guys deserve like a medal of honor for keeping the streets safe. Because imagine we have a bunch of Rab pit bulls and Rajas running around. I don't know about you dude, but I wouldn't be going outside. Just imagine all those dash hounds running around. Thank if they were all in packs. Dude. A bunch of dash hos. It's just the dash. A gang that like I've seen gangs of dogs. You don't wanna mess with them. No, actually she didn't, Didn't Really have very many dogs. She had more like she had a deer at one point. She had a skunk. She had an alligator. Sounds like it's the zoo you went to. Dog Is her house. Oh okay. She would like rehabilitate them at her h like inside her house. Why are you rehabilitating an alligator? Kill the alligators. Yeah, alligators should go and sting.


I'm gonna start a hashtag. One time she had to come to our house to get a raccoon. It was like this big. It was so cute. But it's, mom had left it and it was out in the daylight and it was like up in a tree and it was like if a raccoon could be drugged, it was definitely drugged 'cause it was like hanging on by a limb literally. And eventually it just fell out and got brain damage and so she had to take it and But the raccoon, the raccoon, the raccoon. It was so tiny. So cute. I love them. We should get raccoons for LOL Podcast episode. Please. You guys think dinosaurs. Can we do any, any sort of animals for LOL Podcast episode? I would love that of my gosh. Raccoon would be awesome. A little monkey's running around climbing the street. Let's get a chimpanzee Monkey. Oh my gosh. Monkey. Monkey. That chi chimpanzee. Chimpanzee try to kill you. Chimpanzee would play dead men but with his eyes open. You don't want any part of that?


No. I Actually do love chimpanzees monkey though. They like hug you. They wrap around you, They take your face and they take you off and kiss you. That happened one time? No, I'm, it Happened multiple times. I'm not downplaying the lady that happened to, 'cause I've listened to that story maybe over like 20 times. 'cause I listen to the true crime every morning. Every morning when I get up and that story, I just play it on repeat and it just scares me so bad. But I love monkeys so much. Wait, wait, how'd the story go? It's so basically this woman owned a monkey. Her friend was taking care of it. The friend was like babysitting the monkey. The monkey wasn't used to her. She took his name was like chimp or something out out of the, Are you making this up?


No. Swear or are you telling me? Planted the games I'm, she's like and they took over San Francisco. We're like, oh She took the, she took the chimp out of the, out of the cage and it like attacked her and ripped off her face. And she called 9 1 1 and then the friend called 9 1 1 'cause she came back. Or the actual owner came back and saw that her friend was like totally her face was ripped off. Oh my gosh. No, it's not funny. No it's not. Yeah, what I'm thinking about. It's really funny but it's not funny. Well what are you thinking about? So I Can't say it. So then, so then they had to put the chimp down. Of course. Yeah. But that, that chimp was such an emotional attachment to the lady. But then she didn't die but her face was all ripped off.


Yeah. Oh so scary. And You can look up the photos. I Can show you girl who got her face. Oh no. We don't need to see. Right? We need to see that. I got a real question. You know everyone's asking around who would win in a fight? One gorilla versus a hundred men. Who do you guys think would win in a fight? You, His name was Travis. Oh that The monkeys. That was not anything related to Chip. Oh, Monkeys name was Travis. Oh his name. Just Travis. Who do you guys think would run in a fight One Or you, we've already talked about this week. No, no. You individually versus 1000 dash hounds. Oh 1000 dash Hounds dash. For sure. No, I'm killing all of them. No. Yes, I'm, no they're not one kick each Dude.


No dude, I Can see I get tired after like four, Four kids. Honey. I Can literally just, I bet you You can kill a thousand. You imagine. Would you imagine you in a football field with 1000 dash hounds on the other side? All going, I Can Done. Well speaking from experience because I do have a dog that's similar to a weenie dog. A boxer? No. Huh? Honey Honey's Really sweet. Oh honey. Yeah. I guess Honey's kind of. Yeah, honey's like a practically a weenie dog. They have bad backs. You just literally step on their back. Oh my. Where you expect to get that? I was just like one back three back.


No step on a crack and bake your back. I think I would die. Or grabbing and like crack your back very quickly. If I had like a thousand honeys coming at me, I stand no chance. Really? 'cause honey don't even got no teeth. So I'm allowed. Do you She Four. Dude. Four. Imagine all these puppies running up to you. I would be in heaven. I Know. Okay, so we asked this question because we have a thousand dash hounds for you all. I would love that. I would literally have them all run up to me and kiss me and another Rabbit. I'll tell you what, if I was in a Mr. Beast video and his thing was like, there's 1000 dash hounds guarding this a hundred thousand dollars. I'm not going for that. A hundred thousand. Oh I'm not going for it. And I, I'll tell you that. I don't even think I Can kill one dash pound. They're so cute. Yeah.


Oh You can if they're killing you. Little we if it's attacking me. No, I wouldn't. Wouldn't I'd let them kill me? What? Okay. What a sacrifice. Honestly. I mean, yeah. Real noble. No you wouldn't. I've seen you literally just get like a bug on you and you're like, God, Well a bug is a bug. Are you kidding me? Dogs are so different. A dog is like halfway human. I felt bad the other day we were playing volleyball and there was this, there was this like little bug. I don know what it was, but it was some sort of like mid-size bug and it was flipped over on its back struggling in the sand like this. Kinda like a turtle wood. I Love helping bug. So I, I didn't know what to do 'cause it was mid volleyball game. So I just buried it in the sand and I was like, I hope he dies quick.


What was it? I don't know. I don't know what it was. And maybe it's just one of those bugs that lived in the sand, but I just buried it in the sand. 'cause I didn't wanna step on it. And then I was like, I don't know if that really helped him out or not. Because now can you tried to have me help a roach that was stuck like that? Oh it was in a store. A roach. Now we talked about this before. The roach in the store, one of 'em was stuck upside down and you wanted him to save it. Well no, but like get rid of It. Oh, I was like, nah, he's stuck there. He deserves that. He is a roach. My my sister was in the school bathrooms and like two rats just went under her stall in the school bathroom. That sounds about Right. It's disgusting stall. And there's also roaches in the school. Bathrooms. They're just walking around in the rat. They're like dead.


I wonder what like dogs think right now. Like what is Stella thinking of right now? Like She's probably so happy that she hasn't even kicked off the podcast. She's like overwhelmed With me. No. Like does she have words going through her mind? Like actual words or like, or like, or like actually like words going to, she actually thinks Words thinks in English. Well, I don't know about English. Think She speaks in some, she thinks in some sort of language. Yeah. We found out Honey was a spaniel the other day. We did Remember ESP Spaniel. Yeah. Honey thinks in a Spaniels Espanol. Yeah, That's what she thinks in Honey's. A Spanish dog. Hey, that's all right. I think it espanol too, I think in it. But I can't speak it. You don't?

You could have talked about it for when we talked about dogs for 10 hours. Okay. You know what? Sorry, I didn't know how to work it in there.

This happened to Kate yesterday. Yeah. And we purposely told her not to tell Harper or anyone because it happened. Well, all of us know. But this happened.

No, it, it's, oh Without Kenzie. I'm just gonna tell the first part. Okay.


Basically, last night, Kenzie and I had gone out with a group of our friends. We were celebrating one of our friends' birthdays and our plan was to go to this like rooftop movie in Fort Worth. So it's like 45, 50 minutes away. And the theme was PJ's. Like everyone was gonna be wearing PJ's, Which was your first mistake. Why? Well, We'll get to that. Anyways, so the theme is PJ's and we drive down to Fort Worth and we get outta the car and there's two other girls and they're PJ's. Wait, You gotta talk slow. Oh, I am. Oh, What I'm getting past the like unimportant stuff with like the stuff you need to know. Okay. Anyways, so these two girls that were also in PJ's, because it was a PJ party, Woo Hoo, came out and they were like, Hey, are y'all here for the movie?


And we were like, yeah. And they were like, oh, they canceled it 'cause of the rain. And we were like, dang, we just drove like 45, 50 minutes and we never got a message from them. So we assumed it was still gonna happen. So anyways, we were like, well we, we, we drove like almost an hour and you know, it's the first time in a few weeks everyone's been free. We're still gonna like, you know, go do something. So we just spontaneously decided we were gonna go out and we went to a Mexican restaurant and we had very good food. Oh, can We fast forward? Oh my God, you so much have enchiladas in the frame. And we're at the roller skating Rink. Okay. So after Mexican food, we decided to go to the roller skating rink. Alright. Yep. Yeah, that's where we're at Now I Can, okay, So we go, this Is where the story actually begins.


Well you needed to know like why we were in our PJs. I guess so. Yeah. So we were in our PJs at the roller skating rink and it's adult night and it's probably like 9 30, 10 o'clock. So the only people at the rink on a Sunday night are people that like actually roller skate as a hobby. It seemed like. Wait. So we go in, we get our skates, Kenzie and I start out on the baby rink just to make sure we can do it because we haven't done it in a while. And you guys are still in your pajamas? Yes. Our pajamas that were normal. They're cute. Yeah, They normal. He Maverick is insisting that our pajamas were inappropriate, but it was literally a pair of pajamas. You'll know why I think that in a minute. No, you're literally, So maybe they were, it was like InApp a Set. No they weren't. It was a pajama set. Short. Short. Alright. Pop, pop up a picture, right.


You get it. Pop. See that's what I thought. I understand with like the buttons. It's just like everything's kind of loose. I understand Because Kate has a gi well first of all, my GI was not showing. Are you sure? Just pop up, pop up a picture of what the girls were wearing. We they're loose shorts. They could be going in the window. We should have pictures of you guys in it. Yeah. I mean, yeah, we can get a Picture. Yeah. So we'll pop up pictures of what they were wearing. It's, they were not inappropriate, but Kenzie and I are the first out of the group. There's like six girls. We're the first ones to go to the big, the big skating, the girl Skating. Real quick question. Were all the girls wearing these type of pajamas? Yes. Yes. The whole group. All of us were. No, because I saw some of them and they were wearing like pants. Like the first, There was one girl that was wearing girl who was wearing pants.


She was modest. And you know what, say say the modest one of group Degrees. It was literally 90 degrees outside. And y'all have to keep in mind, we would not have gone to the roller skating rink in pajamas. We were going to a movie. I realize you rollerskating outside. Yeah. I didn't understand that. Y'all Roller skating outside? No. Are y'all Gonna an movie? So why matter what it was outside. We were gonna an outdoor Stop trying to gaslight us. Modest Is hottest. We were gonna to, it literally was like a girl's night on a rooftop washing My gosh. Mom again. Oh my gosh. Yo. We're trolling. You we're trolling you. Well, you guys Look Maverick Been t troll. No, Maverick. Maverick genuinely believes this. And I asked cash last night. I actually asked cash last night after we went to bed. I said, did you really think that the pajamas I were wearing were bad? And he was like, no.


And that's when I lied to her. No, He, he would've told me if he actually thought the, the pajamas were bad. But the pajamas are away or Not bad. I dear. We've talked about, we've talked about Mexican restaurant, we talked about pajamas, we talked about the movie and the rain, the actual good part of the story. You guys Interrupting us? Oh, Girls are better. Okay. I'm gonna rage and slap someone on the podcast. That's what's about to happen with these hands. Okay, shut up. Shut up. I'll tell the story. Girls are better storytellers 'cause they give all the details. The audience wants the details. Yeah. So Kenzie and I are the first two to get onto the big girl rink. And I'm not even joking. She is telling an opening to a chapter in a book. No, because that's literally worse.


And We've gone onto the big girl rink. We're storytellers. Okay. We get onto the rink. I'm not even joking. We are like two seconds on the rink. We start going and I'm like, kind of have my arms out to balance. And I feel someone come up behind me and wrapped their arms around me. And I'm like, oh, Cass is here. He checked our location and saw we were at the skating rink. So he showed up. So weird. POV from our position, we get a call. Hey, we're no no call. No call. Oh no call. We get a text. No, wait, no, no. Let her finish. Yeah. Whatcha doing? I don feel like it's like a valid No, just let her finish first. So I look, I thought it was cash for a second, but then I was like, wait, and I turn around. It's this man I've never seen in my entire life. This tall man has his arms wrapped around me.


Are you serious? And he just, he didn't let go. He kept his arms wrapped around me for like a, like a a period of time. It was like, it literal, probably like four or five seconds. It was, it was a, it was like long. What were you thinking? Kenzie Kinzie's right next to me. I was Thinking this don't to Kate. Don't Kate can keep moving out one mile an hour If you did not understand it. So this man has his arms wrapped around me and this is where the reenactment can come in. Okay. Wait, how Old, how old was he? Like, he was probably in his like mid to late twenties. Like he was older. He was older than me. Yeah. That's disgusting. Cash. Will you be the man? I guess can kids he be the man? The woman guy was like, the guy was be the woman.


But I guess I'll be the man. The guy was just a lot bigger than me. Yeah, well I am a big strong man, so I guess I'll play the part. All Right, ma, can you play the part? What the No. Okay, so I, I'm skating. Can you hear me? Can you take off your shoes? So I feel taller. Yeah. Thank you. They're Flat. Well you guys turn and look at the turn and look at Mav. I'm skating. Okay. And this man comes up, I'm like, this comes up, puts his arms like one right here and one right here. And he has his arms wrapped around me like this. Oh, Oh my God. And I Can, I can't really move. 'cause my, I'm like, and I, I'm like, and I like, oh, it's cash.


And I said, get off of me. Ow. And she fell just Like she fell just like that. Wait, you did you scream? Yeah. Yeah. First she Was like, wait, wait, wait. You actually just slapped him. I slapped him. I slapped him. Good. I slapped him as hard as I could. Are you kidding me? You're telling Me everything's okay. Stella, go back downstairs. I can't believe I reenacted that. So's Like, I'm coming Kate. No. She's like, I can't believe I reenacted that perfectly because that's exactly what happened. I was like trapped in his arms. I saw it wasn't cash. And I turned and I slap in him. I yelled at him and I said, get off of me.


Like as loud as I could. Because why are you grabbing me? You freak. I don Dunno who you are. Make a scene. You don't know who I am. Psychotic. Kinda to think that you are so entitled that you can come up behind a random woman that you don't know, wrap your arms around her and hold onto her. And then I slap him and I fall to the ground. And as I'm falling, he's like, whoa, whoa. What, what do you mean? Whoa. Whoa. What? You grabbed me. You psychotic man. You are mental. Seek help. Okay. Oh my goodness. Don't Grab, I know who it's who. It was Andrew Tank. No, Don't ever grab a random woman that you don't know ever. She's gonna be married. No psychotic. You're a psycho. You're a mental seek help. You need to go to the mental institution if you think that's okay. Okay. Dude. I think that's crazy. 'cause that if a man, if a random man came up to me and like hugged me, no, it was so Scary.


I was like, why are you touching me? He like Played it off like he was gonna fall too. Like it was like, he kinda like faked a fall because he grabbed onto her and I immediately thought, oh, like he's gonna fall. He didn't mean to like grab her like that, but then he wouldn't let go. And I was like, well that's kind of weird. And then he skated away and me and Kate like looked at him later on that night and he was doing like little spins and stuff, stuff, videos. Like he's professional. I'll show you in a second. Please. Was He at least cute? No. Oh, disgusting. I don't care How right here the I don't Care. I don't care how attractive you genuinely are. If you act like that, you're ugly. You're so ugly. And I saw him talking to multiple other girls that night. Ugly gross. That's why they all walked away from you. 'cause you're a freak anyways. Well, Kate can say all she want. I was like, Matt, should we go pull up on him?


No, no, No. Wait, wait, wait. Can I finish? Okay, please. Anyways, so then after I fall, Kinzie like comes over to me and she's like, Kate, I don't know if he meant to. And these two other men that I don't know come over and they're like, do you know who he was? I was like, no. And they're like, why did he grab you like that? I was like, I don't know. That's the question of the night. Why did he grab me like that? I don't know who he was. And so then I'm like, very, I'm mad because like why are you touching me? And then yeah, we watched him the rest of the night. I took some video, I took a video of him proving that he does know how to escape. Show video on the video. No, I'll, yeah, I Can. Oh yeah, we can. What do you do? Of course we you don't, you don't get don't don't exposing him. You don't get to grab me like that. Like you know me and then expect me not to go post it on my podcast and all my social media platforms. Psycho you, I'm talk about this on my podcast.


I literally said that the clip, I said, I'm gonna talk about this on my podcast because No. Oh my, Are you kidding me? You can do anything nowadays. Don't put you on their podcast. That's No, actually. Yeah, no. Because actually you got the wrong girl. If you think You can touch me like that. So yeah, this is the man in the gray shirt doing twirl, doing twirl. What a what a zesty dude. No, like You can tell like he clearly knows how to skate. Like there's no excuse of Oh, he was about to fall. And even if you're about to fall, you say, oh, I'm so sorry. You could tell he knew, like, you could tell that I was scared because the way I yelled and slapped him and he just skated away. He didn't say he was sorry. He didn't say, oh, I didn't mean to oh, this blah blah, blah. He skated away. But after he was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like I acting like I was a psycho. So yeah.


Yeah. But Kate acted like it wasn't a very big deal because then we get on the phone and I, it was mem al, pape Michael, a bunch of us. I was like, well let's just go pull up on him if he's at the skating rink. And the kid was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So you're not that mad at him. No, I was, I I, the thing was is that I knew it didn't matter whether or not you showed up. You would've showed up 20, 30 minutes after it happened. And it was just like all that would've happened was a fight. Irrelevant. No, A fight wouldn't have even happened. Here's the thing. He real realistically, he only hugged her, which is like, it's like inappropriate. But it's like, is it worth driving 20 minutes away to even do like, it's like, yes. No, thank not, that's what I said It unfortunately. No, no, no.


It was the entitlement that he had to think that it's okay to grab somebody you don't know. Like that did, that's, you would've been soul. That's the thing though, is that you're thinking that because it wasn't kinzie. If a man came up behind Kinzie and grabbed her like that, you would've been livid. I don't Think. Yes, she would've. You've let him get away with it, I think. What do you mean? What do you mean get away with it? It Kenzie would've got up and skated after him and tackled him. I don't think the Ray Kate was Kenzie. No. Yeah. I don dunno. I don didn't really skate very Well. I would've done that for, I hit him as hard as I could. Actually. They did him pretty hard. Get up. Yeah. I think Matt would've a different reaction if it was Kenzie. Yeah. I mean a hug isn't like that deep. It's like, yeah, like You can call the skate. Like you can't really do anything about it. It's just hug is what I'm saying. No. Yeah. But by the, it's, you can't go around just hugging people from behind.


You also can't press charges. Get Someone. Yeah. Especially Buffalo. Someone for hugging you. Yeah, You can cant No, but coming up and grabbing a woman like that you would if you did that, we would be like, Mav, what the fuck are you doing? You don't just grab people like that. Well I'm not saying it's like okay, I'm saying Like, wait, don't, don't we all have freedom of touch. It happened like an hour after Freedom of Touch. No, I don't think So. I don't think freedom of touch. I don't think that's in the constitution. Ultimately Kate, you were Assaulted by this guy. Well you're downplaying It. Well now you're switching up. Yeah. Now you're saying well Kinsey wouldn't have let it happen. No, I'm saying it's bad. But I'm saying is it bad enough for Ka to go down there and like try to pick a fight with the guy? I'm sorry because you said you can't file charges and then you just said you were Assaulted. No, I said you could file charges. He did that for the thumbnail or whatever. I said can't I meant foot actually. Okay. You were Assaulted but it's not that big of deal.


No, the thing is, the Thing is is after the se, after it happened and Kinzie came over and she was like, I don't know if he meant to, I was like, okay, maybe it was an accident. So for like 15, 20 minutes after, I was like, did he mean to do it or was it an accident or did he do it on purpose? Right. And after I watched him for a while and I was like, okay, you know how to skate. It wasn't An accident. You also don't know like two things. One, he could have been embarrassed by it 'cause he could have thought you were some other girl that he does know. True. But he would've, he wouldn't said something To be fair. He shoulda said something to me. Something Actually, lemme put No he didn't because that's right. You guys were wearing pajamas and no girls wear pajamas. No, but also to be fair, hey That's my homie Me in pajamas. I see her everywhere. Yeah, No, he was like talking to like four or five of Girls.


Yeah. Like I literally, I watched she talk to a bunch of other girls too. Like That's so weird. Weird. No, it was weird. And don't like, I, I shouldn't have to say this, but don't grab random women that you don't know psycho seek help immediately. Please for the sake of society. Seek help. Your mental, I'm trying to think if I've ever been Assaulted. No, if you have to Think. Yeah. Say wait. Yeah, and no, no, no. Like I'm actually really trying to think because I feel like it's happened to me before. Can I, Can I defend what I was saying to cash? I texted cash. I didn't immediately call him but I texted him because I was like, I don't know if the guy did it on purpose. I went back and forth and then after we had decided to leave, 'cause honestly the place was just like weird. It was late. The people were kind of strange. We're like, was It interstate? Yeah. We were like, let's just get outta here. It's kind of strange. So we left and when we had gotten into the car, Kasha called and he was like, what happened?


And I told him and all of the guys, half of them were gonna wanted to come the other half were like, it's not worth it. Kenzie. And I didn't want the boys to come because we didn't wanna fight to be picked. Like we were like, no, we don't like we just wanna leave. I just wanted to be home. Like I didn't care to stay longer. I didn't care for cash to go. Like I didn't want any of that. So I was like, no, don't come, don't come. Don't come. We're coming home. Well, well all that. Unless there Was a tornado. So That was No. Yeah, there literally was like a tornado. A tornado too. And there Was like ambulances in the parking lot because this one guy, he fell in like, I don't know if he cracked his head or broke his leg, But he's, when y'all told me that you were going to inter skate, I don't remember if it was a text or phone call or what it was, but I looked over at cash and we're sitting downstairs and I go, the girls are going to inter skate.


He's like, okay. I was like, I don't know if that's a good idea for them to all go. It did. He he said that. I said, I said, it's a bunch of girls going there alone. I was like, and I assumed a roller skating rink was full of like 10 year olds. Ka starts mocking me. He's like, they're gonna go roller skating. Last time I went to a roller skating rink, a bunch of someone's gonna, someone's gonna flirt with your girl into a roller skating rink. I'm like, I don know man. This is, you know, it's, listen, last time I went there was a bunch of 10 year olds with playing par party Rock anthem doing the limbo. Yeah, yeah, I know. I Actually that's And you were hyped when you got the free ticket to go to the counter and get a free Laffy taffy. No, I actually, I would not have gone if I would've known. It was like gonna be weird like that because the last time I went I was in high school and it was a bunch of other high schoolers. So I was like, oh, it's just like gonna be a bunch of Teenagers, you know?


Oddly enough I do really wanna go roller skating now. Me too. Right? That I, We going back go. Absolutely not. 'cause tonight is dancing night. There we Could, I We should have pulled the man. Oh, sorry. You Should have forced him to go. No. Wait, so there's no roller skating? No, its, yeah, there's roller Skating. You not. He do. No, but if had I known that you girls were going in pajamas to inter skate, I don't know why I probably, I've probably called at midnight. Hey, y'all should just come home and change real quick. Well wait. Y'all gonna know that Maverick's being just a little bit overprotective when you see the picture of us in our cute pajamas. Were Were just like matching pajama sets because Kate knowing Clearly they were a little too cute.


That was the issue. Yep. The other girl, wait, wait, lemme ask you. They Were floral. Y'all already told us that floral is like for grandma Floral can only be modest. Yeah, I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm J Ka. Oh he's J Ka. I'm j Ka. But did the girl that was wearing the full set pajamas with like the pants and everything did did that that boy come to, They never a kitty ring. There was six girls. One girl was wearing a long pajama set and the other five were wearing short set. And you guys chose to not wear long pajama sets. 'cause we were gonna be outside, left Her left Out the girls, because we were gonna, I told her I, she actually got in the car. She said I couldn't find my shorts set so I just wore long ones. I said that's fine, we're gonna be outside and it's 90 degrees. Oh my gosh. We're kidding. You're letting him get under your skin cake.


He's jk. No he Is not though. That's the thing is that he genuinely believes our pajamas were bad. And it makes me mad because they weren't, you should get the security footage From inner skin. What do you mean? It's my opinion. Oh my gosh. That would be so we should, that'd be great. I actually thought about that last night. I was like, I wonder if I, I was like, I should have gone. I Wanna see his face before it happens. If he was like locked in, go Wait, go wait. Should I call him? That would actually be good. But I'm confused because Kate is always like one time these like 11-year-old boys were saying things about her but she wasn't there And she was like, well why didn't you do anything about them? I was, well Not 11, they were like 16. No they were not. You were not there. You literally told me you said that they Were like 16. How old? 16. How old those boys? They were like 11 to 13. A lot of little boys say stuff about your wife so you gonna be more specific.


That's what I'm saying. They're like 12. Listen, anytime we're at the basketball court and there's like a 12-year-old, 15-year-old, 16-year-old start, boy boy they start losing, boy your wife's hot. They start, yeah, they start saying that up. Your wife's hot. Oh I bet your wife would like to kiss me. And they're like 12 years old. And Kate was like, well Why Don dot you do anything about it. What do you want me to do? Curb stop a 12-year-old just how about this little kid? Well dash hound just You wanna know why? And then, and then all of a sudden, so an an actual adult assault someone, she's like, nobody come. Nobody come. 'cause I literally knew, I said if you come tonight and people start hitting each other, you're an adult and you get arrested. You can't just walk in a place and hit somebody. First Of all, I don't know, you know Actually you said shot at.


I was, I said Kate, what do you think we're all gonna whip up with a bunch of guns and have a shootout? I was scared. It's an Inscape. We go talk to the guy. Wait a second. And the worst thing that happens, it's like a couple shoves get exchanged and they kick us out. Now I'm really starting to question y'all's judgment. If you guys didn't want cash to go there 'cause you're afraid he'd get shot. But you guys went there in pajamas. Yeah Dude, that's scary because like, Okay, so y'all walk in the door, you're like this is the kind of place You can get shot. Let's roller skate. No, because it's one of Those let's get boogie. I Think it's every time I actually believe it or not, every time I go into a public space, like a mall or like literally anywhere like restaurants, malls, concerts, anything. My first thought church all the time.


I'm always like, what if someone in here has a gun? 'cause it's like people, I think about that in church too. Yeah. Like every time I'm like unfortunately In church like probably 20% of the audience has a gun in there. No, I know. But like person in there we're in Texas, a person in there that's like has the intent to harm people with their gun. Wait, what do you mean? That's why I always think that. Yeah, that's don't think you get very far. There was one video that came up one time of a guy that tried to shoot a church and it was in Texas and I'm not even kidding, like 30 guys in the crowd stood up and had a gun and shot him. Yeah, Well no, no, no. My point is, is the thought of me being like, oh, someone in here could have a gun is not rare because I have that thought every single place we go to I do too. Well. Okay. Yeah.


Do you have anything left to say to this guy? Seek help. You're mental. Well Don't grab women. I'm just confused still though. Why you want me to defend you to 12 year olds, but not to an Adult but not to 20-year-old. No, I guess. Well She wants me to actually go to jail. No, I To insult a minor. No. If if like I was saying, you need to say something back to them. Don't just let them like talk like dirty about me. You don't understand a 12 year. She Doesn't understand all my guys friends. Second, you give 'em a reaction. You know how I rage bait pap And that's what they're beating people all the time. Oh my Gosh. I get rage baited so Much. Yeah. I rage great people Time. Now you're comparing yourself to a 12-year-old. Yeah, I am 12. Yeah, no, that's what all men act like. Well the second you show 'em attention, guess if they're getting to you. It's like, I Guess you're right. It's, it's on now.


You're right. There's nothing You can do for a 12 year old's. Just like let them do what they wanna do. But I genuinely was, and every, every, and I know you guys think we're dramatic, but every girl in the car was like, no, they don't need to come. Like someone's just gonna get hurt. Let's just go home. Yeah. Every single, all of us in the car, were like, we're going home. They don't need to GOs my between guys and girls. She thinks you couldn't take him. Yeah, there was five of us. Are you kidding me? This guy's on wheels. You just shut them over. I mean that was the easiest fight Whatcha gonna do? Come on. Yeah. No, it's not that. I was like, oh you can't take him. It's that. I didn't want anybody to go fight. What? His Buddies gonna come up there on skates. I'll tell you what anybody I wanna fight, I hope they're on skates. That's like negative 10 points right off rip.


That would be so funny. They'd be like, Oh, you got heavy things on your feet. You're like, Yeah, I don't know. In my mind, if you showed up something bad was gonna happen and people were gonna get arrested. I was just Like, and you know how long it takes to take off skates? They'd be like, gimme five minutes. Just trying to untie them. Yeah, unclip Them. I used see is so much fomo when we'd go roller skating him out, put his skates on faster than me do I know. And he'd be out there just running it. I was like, frick, leftover. Probably spin the loop. Come on. I'm not gonna lie. When you guys called last night, cash was mad. Cash was storming out the door. He was like, and you know what Michael and Al were with me. They were like, yeah, let's go. No, this and Mavin just like, calm down. No, they were like this. They were like, yeah, cash go.


Actually I didn't, no they didn't have their phone. Alex didn't. Michael were like, yep, let's get in the car and m and paper like, well was this really a big deal? Listen, if you, we really need to play Smash Bros right now. No. If he like grabbed her butt or something, it's like, okay. I mean my man's like, what, what is that called? How do you say it Like that Aggressive. I mean if you like grabbed her butt or something, that's some more serious, but a hug if You like grabbed her brother or Something. Matt, you just, you're you're only thinking that though because it wasn't Kenzie. I watched dudes at the meet and greet line hug Kenzie, The 12-year-old. Okay, like 12 year olds. Yeah. Say No, but like if a guy came up behind Kenzie wrapped his arms around her and he held on long enough for her to turn around, be freaked out and slapped him.


You would've been mad. I'd be like, you would've Been livid. I'd be like, whoa. Yeah. Good thing you got outta there. And when you did, I mean that sounds pretty bad. What, what, what, what are you gonna do? Go down there and beat the guy up because I'm pretty sure you're on my side Kate. 'cause you didn't want Kate cash to go down there. No, But you're just acting like it's, it wasn't a big deal all around it. Like I'm acting my cash shouldn't have went down there. Which I still disagree with. I think five guys. So I don't understand why you're acting like I should be mad at Kinzie and be like, I'm gonna go down there. I'm confused why everybody thinks we're gonna go in there. Guns a blazing, like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Like that's Literally just like my first thought when something bad happens. Like We're going to in skate to talk to Guy. Now worse, some people are gonna like yell or like maybe shove something and then like they kick us out.


But there's just no reason to go down there like that. Is it the worst is like somebody, it's like somebody yells like f you and walks out and that's like it, like 30 minutes Kate Passed. Kate already Slapped him and it's like, oh, it's kind of over with. Probably forgot about it already. Yeah. So lemme get this straight. No, I, I don't know. I don know what I want. I don dunno What I, to be clear. Okay. I don dunno what to tell you because I don't know what I want because part of me is like, yeah, I do want you to go talk to the guy. 'cause he shouldn't have grabbed me like that. But the other part of me is scared that something bad could happen when you just start going and talking like that. Yeah. What if he hugs Us too too? He Could have choked you. What if he hugs? He, we get there. He's like, come here. I don't know. Hey, he'll be there next Sunday. Guaranteed. Yeah. I say we, well it's dance night.


That that means he's like a 20-year-old who is like single. Trying to look for girls at a dance club. Not a skating rink. Skating rink, but like, It doesn't seem like the place to look for girls. It's similar. Actually, look, keep if you're in high school, baby, stop Harper. Just stop. What? What was She saying? Nothing. Okay. Well that's the end of this episode.
