1 (5m 8s):
Really, you really trying to get your way out of detention, huh? That's it. I'm going down there and I'm talking to the principal and

0 (5m 13s):
Also guys, I went to her office today because she always calls me down and I love you. I,

4 (5m 20s):
I am literally so I cannot stand the public school system dude. Like they are. So I have learned, I was like, you know, obviously when you're in high school you're like, oh, like teachers are so mean. No, they're so rude to students. My sister is a senior, senior.

1 (5m 34s):
Harper loves her teachers. Oh,

4 (5m 35s):
Well no, I'm talking to my sister, at least my sister's school. The school I went to and I left because I hated it so much. But some she made it through. Congratulations Anna. You're graduating this week. and I don't think

1 (5m 46s):
I've ever heard a student say a good, like my school was just the best. No,

4 (5m 49s):
I'm telling you Anna had sent multiple emails. There was some scholarship that they said, all you have to do is fill out this form and you'll get scholarship money. But they didn't tell the kids until the due date, like the day it was due. So no one filled it out. and they all missed out on like a thousand dollars of scholarships. So then Anna's emailing their like principal and stuff and she's like, Hey, like what's up with this? Trying to get a response. She does not respond. And she was responding. Anna had other friends emailing. She was responding to those friends, but not Anna. So Anna had a loop in my mom and That was, when they responded to her was when my mom got in the email thread and they responded within, within a couple of minutes and I was like, why could y'all not respond to her when she had like sent the email herself?

0 (6m 26s):
Do you guys wanna know why I got sent down today?

1 (6m 28s):
Wait, you guys wait, how often you get sent down

0 (6m 32s):

1 (6m 50s):
Even you rolled your eyes when you said great kid. Like I feel like even you didn't believe that. Wait, you

4 (6m 55s):
Guys listen to the office

0 (6m 56s):
Today? Yes, because for what she sent me down, she's like, Hey, did you sneak into detention? and I was sneak

1 (7m 2s):

1 (7m 10s):

Wrong with that. Maybe I didn't read my book so I had to go to detention.

1 (7m 16s):
She ed her self detention. And so I self serve myself. I been a bad kid. I need detention. You stay, you voluntarily went to detention and now you're trying to argue yourself out of detention. You voluntarily go to detention. And so then they're going to give you detention.

1 (7m 33s):
Women. I can never make up their mind. She's

4 (7m 34s):
Gonna hang out with her friends. She can't go. It's

0 (8m 12s):
Yeah. So why do I need an id? Why do I need an id?

1 (8m 14s):
'cause you, you're not special Harper. Yeah I am. You're just like every other kid and you need an id. You're treated like everyone else except Trump's son. Look, he has all Trump's son graduate and Trump's son's graduated from high school. He was not treated same ever. Everyone had their phones out just staring at Trump. And Trump's just like watching his son graduate. He's like, Aw,

0 (8m 34s):

4 (28m 12s):
Favorite is when no one says anything and people will comment it in the comments themselves. Yeah,

Yeah. Timestamp it. Yes.

0 (52m 43s):
Just be hitting cars

4 (52m 43s):
Left and right

1 (52m 44s):
In the band. Listen, listen. Too tall. Listen, listen Linda, listen Linda, you're the worst driver here. Ka I,

0 (52m 51s):
No, I'm actually the best driver here, dude. You

1 (52m 53s):
Should see me. You have the worst record. So you should see me in go-karts. I come in first place second if the card sprayed. I've told her one car. Two and

4 (53m 3s):
Yeah, two. You did the van and the truck

1 (53m 5s):
We're really counting the van. Like really? Yes. Like we're, we're really gonna count that you did that. You did that. He's such a, you like, literally like that's something Kate would say. You're gonna count that. No. What do you mean count that? Why did you count that? Yeah, I was 15 years old. Why we count on that. You, because you crashed the van because you were, you totaled it. A driver. Fine. Listen. And first of all, I'd like to say both of my car accidents happened in the same spot or the same like type of scenario. And both of my car accidents, the car should not have been totaled. First one was at a stoplight. I fell asleep at the stoplight. It, it was a long line. Okay. And no

0 (53m 39s):
Way.

1 (53m 40s):
And I did, I fell asleep at the stoplight. And, and then his foot hit the gas and just p and then, and then my foot hit the gas and I and I hit the person in front of me and see the, the car should not have been told. Okay. But the reason the car was told is 'cause I was driving up hunk of junk All. right. And the, the car itself was only worth like a thousand dollars. It was worth way more than that. No it was not. Dude. Three 50,000 miles on it. 85 outta 300. Yes it did. Yes it did. It had so many. It did.

0 (54m 6s):
He said a honk and junk.

1 (54m 8s):
That car was fine. No, it was old as frick. Dude. It was old as Isaac. Newan. And. it was like in 2005. And this was in like 2015. No, no. That car was like 19 hundreds. What? And listen, listen, it was basically a first car I ever made. It was 19 hundreds. No, it was like brand new. It was 19 hundreds. and I hid it And. it was like they're gonna be, they were like, oh, it's gonna cost $700 to repair the car. so we might as well just total it out. That's what said it's such a junk car. And so like total. Yeah, technically the insurance totaled it out. So it was, but the car was completely drivable. No, it was completely fine. And. it should not have been totaled. And. it was not drivable. Moving on to the second one, the second totaling of a car happened because I was at a stoplight eating orange chicken.

1 (54m 56s):
And when I was eating my own chicken, it tasted a little funny. Shout out Panda Express caused my car accident and I had to roll my window down and spit it out. But when I spit it out, next thing you knew, I hit the car in front of me. And. it was not my fault. That's the most was what you hit the car in front of. The guy slammed on his brakes 'cause something ran out in front of him. You weren't paying attention.

0 (55m 18s):
And I'm gonna be honest, you can sue

1 (55m 19s):
Something didn't run out in front of Sue Panda. I was thinking same thing

0 (55m 22s):
Honestly. You can sue anybody for anything these days. That's what I was thinking. I'm being so real like I can sue I can literally sue, could

1 (55m 29s):
You sue cash? Yeah, no. Great. I

0 (55m 31s):
Can sue you because I would say that you

1 (55m 35s):
No, I'm really excited

0 (55m 36s):
You took my phone without my permission. Mm,

1 (55m 38s):
That is

0 (55m 39s):
True. And it's my personal property. And that's actually

1 (55m 41s):
On the video for someone not getting outta my house.

0 (55m 44s):
Oh, well you invited me here, right? Mm. I'm invited. Right? Well, Kate

1 (55m 49s):
And hold. Wait, let me, let me clear up the second one. Yeah, whatever. The second one, it doesn't matter. You totaled it. No, no. And then no, the second one. Tell lemme other time. No, lemme defend myself real quick. I hit the car in front of me and turned out the car I was driving had bad underlaying issues in the car. Like the insides of the car was not good. Like the, in like the, not the interior but like the engine. And so when I, when I like organs of the car, when I totaled it, yes. The organs of the car were bad. So when I totaled it, they were like, Hey listen, the organs are actually bad, so we're just gonna trash the whole thing. and I was like, okay, I I have never damaged a car more than like a dent. That is not true. You totaled two cars. And then on top of that, do you remember, Alex remembers this, you fell asleep while driving back from visiting some friends.

1 (56m 33s):

0 (56m 33s):

Already you decided at like midnight. I'm gonna drive to Arkansas and go see two girls. So you drive like four hours. I was, I was like, I was like, I just turned, it was like the, like I just turned six. It was a four hour drive.

4 (57m 11s):
You went to Missouri and you could, if you were going somewhere, you could've come to Texas. No,

1 (57m 15s):
She got you. I I, you know, I tried to go to Texas, but I added up the hours And it was gonna take too long. so we went to his backup. so we see

4 (57m 22s):

1 (57m 22s):
So we had a backup

0 (57m 24s):
Girl. And you didn't even get married to these girls. Imagine?

Wait, did your parents not notice that their car was gone?

1 (58m 3s):
Well they, no, but they, well they knew I took it, but they didn't notice all the damage. Wait,

4 (58m 8s):
Were you supposed to be staying the night at Alex's house or something? Yeah. Oh, okay. So

1 (58m 11s):
Cash was like, you know, I got a flat tire. And then they're like, well why is it crash? And he's like, I was said, yeah, I told, I told him I was doing donut. I told him I pulled into a McDonald's and hit the curb. And then they were like, no you weren't. You were doing donuts. and I was like, you got me. And then you figured you doing donuts versus I drove four hours in the middle of the night to go see some girls was better. Yeah, donut. The donut punishment was definitely better than,
