At the same time. I know. But if y'all were the ones that started talking instead of me and her, you guys probably would've grown up and just married each other.


Jess. We met the same, and if I would've met Kenzie, I, I probably would've meet Kenzie would've started dating and we would've got married. Bro. I met Kate the same time as you.

I was a, I wasn't even looking for someone to date. You were A mature older man. I was. Yeah. You know why you didn't, you weren't interested in Kate because you were dating someone Time.


No, I wasn't. We met the, when we went on the cruise. Yes, you were. This guy doesn't know anything. Catch the cruise. We wouldn't, did not Ma But. we met her. You, you were like old and like you did. You didn't run it. Yeah. Whatever. Okay, So what's wrong with me now? Let. go ahead. Offender her real quick. For starter. That fit, ain't it? The fit Maverick literally looked at me when I first got it and said, I like that a lot. That looks really Cozy. Yeah. That was a lot. It, it, it's a fine fit. It's a fine fit. Here's the Thing. I like this clean girl And nice. I like it. Yeah. It's clean girl. Yes. What does it even mean? It's clean girl. Yes. Clean girl. You wanna know what's CL girl? Is that dirty girl? Yeah. Oh yeah. That's a dirty girl. I do look like musty girl right now. No, I'm so sunburn. I can't even move my legs.


I can't. Let's see. The reason I wouldn't date Kate. Okay. I'll be honest. Kate, I think you're is is it because your brother's married to her? That's reason Number one actually. Reason number two. Okay. No, I think you're great. You're just like, you know. Thank you. You're a bit much for me. Why? Just for me. You're a bit much. What do You mean a bit much In what way though? Like, I just don't do well with rules that like, I don't like, lemme put it this way. You think I'm stupid. I think you're annoying. Okay. That's where the conflict lies. Okay. So, so either one of us is stupid or one of us is annoying.


And sometimes it's me and sometimes it's you. Okay. Okay. And that's just, yeah. Yeah. It's both s so sometimes it's her. Sometimes there's a rule that I'm like, okay, this is dumb. I'm getting yelled at. 90 is stupid. Why? So you so you wouldn't date Kate? 'cause she has rules. No, no, no, no. It's, it's, for me, its, some of Kate's rules are based off of her emotions. And that's okay. That's how she feels. What? It's not based off logic. What some of your rules, what Do you mean? Some of my rules? Like don't wear your, your dirty shoes. That step off Public. What So, what rule, what rule? It's just some things she has that she's just, she likes things a certain way.


Yeah. Like let's say I wanted to hang a photo up in the house. What we talking about here? It could be anything that I wanna hang up. It could be a problem like a make Photo For instance. For instance, there's a, some art up here that you may see that I think is some good art. This piece right here in particular. Yeah. Ill say Kate does not like our art. Let me put it this way. If say, if it was up to me and probably up to cash. This right here. Be above the fireplace, baby. Okay. It's not above the fireplace, as you can see. It gets pushed up to the attic where we are right now. Because that's just I It. It's just, you know, there's just some things that it's like, you are like very like homemaker. Yeah.


I'm a 30-year-old home wreck. Home destroyer. What? What? don Don't think you know what Homer? Yeah. I don't think you know what Homer is. You Hang up naked photos of yourself in a Bathroom. No, I don't. Yes, he does. He Does. He has, he has a portrait in our bathroom. Bring the portrait. No, no. Don't bring the, bring the portrait. Get the, no, no, no. That portrait is from the past. It's an old man. We're not doing that anymore. It's Not even hanging up anymore. I had to take it. Oh listen, In the Closet. The portrait is inappropriate and I shouldn't have taken it. Okay. Showing the portrait I took took a photo. Portrait. Portrait, portrait. No, seriously, this is children's show. We're not showing that. We're showing that It's okay. It's, it's covered, right? I don show It's, but listen, so I took a photo. No, don't bring that on here.


Don't bring that on. I, I took a photo for cash show. Hey, can we bring it on, please? No, we can't show that. We show that I can. No, listen. Bye. Listen. He's Like, If you, if you wanna see it, go to Cass's Instagram. I Guess. Don't do what? The, listen, I took this photo in my underwear and then I put like a black box over my underwear, if you can describe it, to make, to make it look like I'm naked as a prank for cash. 'cause he was gone and didn't care about me anymore. So I gave him a photo to remember me by and I hung it up in his bedroom. That's it. And then somehow I ended up printing another one, giving it to my grandma, printing another one, giving it to my granny and my granny. And these photos are just getting passed around now.


Like, nevermind. And so, yeah, that's, and They got And. it was hung up in our bathroom, our guest bathroom downstairs, Which was funny. Me and cash thought it was hilarious. Yeah. But it, I had to take it down because we had like guests, we, Well, and I just think it's not very like, you know, don don't think we're necessarily Promoting Jesus in the best way with that. Well, yeah. don don't know if I'd say we're living above, living above or proof or whatever. Yeah. I mean from someone that's staring at the photo right now, I would say you're correct. Yeah. I don't even wanna look at it. Please stop. I It away. He's storming me. He still like 360 with it off camera. So listen, my point is, is there's just some things that I think me and you disagree on fundamentally.


Thank you. When it comes to what's okay and what's not. Yes. But do you not think that that has Wait, wait, Wait. Pause, pause. Time out. She was the one That was saying, that's inappropriate the whole time. And you were the one that had it up and now you're saying it's inappropriate. I changed So. what did you disagree on? I changed my mind. I think it's inappropriate now. Yes. Y'all agree? So, and then you're like, I think we disagree. Do you agree? No, no, no, no, no, no. Because for most of our life we disagreed on that. Okay. So back to the question. That was an example. You said Kate has rules that are based off emotions, not off logic. Yes. That was my logic time As an example. What, like, Kate will always tell us to be quiet. What? When we're not even being that loud. What? No, when y'all are talking and y'all aren't talking, y'all are screaming.


and I'm like laying. I'm like trying to take a nap or something. And I'm like, Hey, can you guys like be a little bit more quiet? Yeah. That's, that's a reasonable ask. Mm. But why you nap it in the middle of the day? Oh, the relationship's falling apart already. Yeah, Because I can't, I don't have anything to do. and I You can't. That's why you're telling us to be quiet. No, I'm taking, I was tired. Like maybe I, I woke up early and I was tired and I wanted to take a nap. I should be, I should be able to take a nap in my own house. I don't take nap. I hardly take naps. No, I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to take a nap in your own house. And I'm not saying we shouldn't be respectful of, of time and be quiet sometimes, but, but most of the time it's not a nap. It's my head hurts or something. And so you want us to be quiet?


Yeah. Yeah. That's valid. This is, this is a crazy combo. You're pretty much saying you can't ate because she takes naps. No, no. Anything that's based off, I'm not, for instance, not back it up because I'm trying to be nice right now. I'm trying not to be mean on podcast. Be real. Let's hear it. Like for instance, the other day you were like, Maverick your shoes, can you get them And? I was like, yeah, I'll, I'll bring them up. I left to go get food. I came back, I was gone like an hour and a half. My, I had two pairs of shoes down there. They were picked up and like set or thrown, however you wanna put it into my room, which is fine. I'm like, okay, cool. I feel bad that you grabbed them. 'cause I was like, oh, I, I wish I would've carried those up before I left.


But then I walked down there and this girl got three pairs of her own shoes there. She got two pairs of his shoes. And their shoes are fine there. But my shoes had to be, my shoes were ugly. Mm. What you got against his shoes? And there's just a thing that Kate does where she calls things ugly and she doesn't wanna look at it. No. Sometimes you got ugly shoes. Sometimes it's me, You, don understand. She walk out. She's like one. Those get those out here. Y don't understand. Y'all don't understand. We have freaking, how many people are in our house right now? I feel like We have like 40 shoes in our freaking mudroom at all times. Yeah, but I, It iss called a mudroom. That's because a reason have your shoes that you wear out, then you have your outside like, like freaking. Oh, that's a crazy guys can has two pairs of slippers. Yeah. She has her indoor slippers, outdoor slippers.


And those are always right there. And then she has her regular shoes and they look at, they look the same. They're the same type of pa slippers. So, so when she gets to that, when she, she carries her outdoor slippers to the door wearing her norm, her indoor slippers. When she gets to the door, she steps her outdoor slippers outside, steps out of her indoor slippers into her outdoor slippers. That's what I'm, and then when she comes back in, she does the same thing. She, she steps into her indoor slippers and picks up the outdoor slip. She like I'm saying, and nothing's wrong with that. You're just like very particular about things that I am not particular about. But cash Was never like that either. Like cash, Never cash does not have outdoor and indoor slippers. What he hand Cash never cared about anything like that. No, No, no, no. Until there's lots of times Dating me. No, no, no. There's lots of times where you're like, there's lots of times where Cass, Cass is saying even he's on my side and he is like, Hey, well, mm.


And you're like, it's ugly. I don't wanna look at it. And me and him just go, okay, we're not gonna complain. She cleans the house, she takes care of things. We're not gonna complain. We'll follow the rules. We'll follow the rules. But All, right? Kate. Why don't, why couldn't you date Mav? This is a long list. No, I'm gonna be honest. I think that had cash and I not just been the ones to start talking then. Or maybe if our age gap wasn't as big as it was. 'cause I think I met him when I was like 11 and you were probably like, what, 15? Something like that. Yeah. So obviously a 15 year old's not going for an 11-year-old. But I think had I been 14 and or 13, I could see myself Just see at least she's realistic.


Yeah. I think think I think it could have. I think if the age difference was like different, it could have been a 50 50 shot Possibly dating. You're in denial. Married is crazy. You're in denial. In denial. I don know you would, he's like, he's like, you love my wife. Yeah, you're in denial. You Marry. You would Marry my wife. You. I hate this conversation. You like, this is weird guys. Y'all are weird. All I'm saying is is that it's weird. Look at which everyone agrees this conversation's weird. No, because all the you, you're making it weird because all I'm saying is is it's just like me. Is it not weird? No, thank you. I'm just saying It's who you, me. It's weird. If you would've met Kate and I would've met Kenzie everybody. If you were just think that's normal. Yeah, sure. And if I were to bring up the conversation, then everybody would be like, this is a weird conversation guys.


Wait, you can't deny. There's a huge difference between Kate's personality and Kenzie's personality. Yeah. I never did Kenzie me personally. That's my point. If I wanted a Kate, I would've went out and found a Kate. Yeah, yeah. But you can't just go find a Kate. You can't tell me there's just Kate's laying around. You can't And I. You can't just go find a Kenzie. You're telling me I can't go find a white chick that dyes her hair, that loves to shop at Target and and goes to church on Sunday and and shops at Starbucks every single day. They're rare. You'd be surprised. I can go in, I can find probably one in that exact same outfit at Target right now. You guys, she literally walked into Target the other day. She goes, I'm everywhere. She said. She said, it's just mean. I literally did. I walked into Target and there was probably five other girls wearing the same thing as me.


I was like, this is terrifying. They were all fake blondes. They all had their hair pulled back in the same gold clip that I was wearing. We were all wearing those like oversized T-shirts with like biker shorts and freaking like running shoes. I was like, Wait, which none of them bike or run? No. No. Like it was so That's so true. Why do they all wear biker shorts and they don't even bike guys. Yo. I think Harper Harper should say something. 'cause she hasn't said something in the whole episode. I have two things I've been wanting to say. Okay, So the one, just two. No. Yes. Anyway. I appreciate your patience and not interrupting. Exactly. Yeah. That was, That was, That was nice. That was amenable. You guys wait. No, That was wait. That was admirable anyways. Admirable is still not the correct way. That was admirable. I wanna put my I wanna put my hood on?


No, that's not admirable Guys. I wanna put my hood on? Just because I want people to think that I dead my hair and Oh Guys, Harper died. Prepare. We can still see the red hair. Hey Har. Yeah we can. That's a good clip. We can still see the hair. Oh, here. Lemme fix it. oh, Yeah. No, it's all gone. Actually, you know it's still coming out the bottom somehow. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, they, yeah. You know what you look like. What Yoshi. Wait. Well the second thing, That was pretty good. The second thing I wanted to say was, what if I was, what if I was still shy? Like what if I still didn't like talk on this podcast? Like, what would y'all do? What if I was just like, I What do you mean shy? Like still shy? If you didn't talk, we'd probably replace you. You don. You know, like, you know like episode one you were like talking about like the bathroom.


No. Like how much you fart and stuff. Yeah. It wasn't like you started out shy The first time I met y'all. I was like a little nervous and y'all could tell Right? Like right nervous. No, I was, I was like, hi. Well, okay. I could tell you were kind of nervous. Just 'cause like Yeah, but like, but like just Kate scary. but like, what if I was still, what if I was Was No. Like what if I was still like super, super scared? And. I was like And. I was like, hi. Like, and I wouldn't talk the rest, We probably wouldn't do a Podcast with you. Probably wouldn't be talking much. It Probably wouldn't be a very good podcast. Probably move you to like camera Number one. So So, what was the second thing? That. was it? Oh, That. was it? Anyways guys, I literally have been thinking about this fun game.

Not even the slightest. What? No, like girls' do that for you. The amount of time girls talk about nails and like, I think that they think that like, oh, this is gonna look good. Like the amount Of money we spend on nails too is Crazy. And like, I, like I'm genuinely saying, I don't think a guy has ever noticed a girl's nails. Lemme put it this way. If I was dating, if Kenzie never like got her nails painted again, I don't think I'd ever notice me. Or, and like you could get your nails done. You could redo them every single day. 60 and I don't know if I would notice. Wow. Unless it was like a crazy color. and I was like, why the freak? Do you have orange on your hands? Sure. I know, but I probably spent like, at least $1,200 on my nail. Yeah, but I think y'all do that for yourselves. I don't think you're really doing it for us.


Oh, a Hundred percent. Dude. What I mean? You just Whoa. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. That story flipped real quick. Whoa Whoa. Whoa. What do you mean by that? I obviously get my nails done for myself.

Wait, when you almost have a breakdown Because. I didn't notice them. Well obviously I want you to notice 'em. So you're not doing it just for yourself. No. But like, I, I would Rather she's doing it so she feels good. 'cause she wants you to tell her she's doing it for her. Yeah, but my point is, you weren't doing it just for yourself because you, you really don't like it if I don't notice. Well, and I would get my nails done if I was single too. Yes. But you, I'm saying if you're doing it just for yourself, like for instance, like what's something that you just do for yourself?


Pee brush. Brush your teeth. Yeah, like brush your teeth. Like when you brush your teeth, you're not like, you didn't notice I brush my teeth like clothes. 'cause in reality you're doing that just for yourself. Well actually you could do it for other people. 'cause Kate does tell me to go brush my teeth for herself. I do. She does. I sure do do that. She does Do like change clothes. Put on shoes. don don't know. Put on socks. Okay. Maybe it's a little bit so that you'll notice my nails.

We did a free meet and greet and then we tried to do a second free meet and greet. But then they were like, you have to have a venue and security and like this stuff to make it legal or whatever. So then we had to pay for a bunch of stuff and then we only had to charge $5 a ticket and we just asked for $5. We said, if y'all can't afford it. Yeah, we were like $5 like the like if you don't have $5, don't worry about it. Yeah. And then midway through the meet and greet, I'm like, where did cash go? Where is he at, homie?


Y'all don't know. Cash is a really nice kid. He seems really mean sometimes. Oh, is about to be so sarcastic. No, no. You always seem, you come off as the villain on the podcast. You do because I'm confused. When do I come off as the villain besides the one time I made one joke? No, you've come off as the villain a lot. Like you're actually probably the most hated host. But what the, listen, I'm the host just because Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. Am I the most hated host Guys, listen, cash please don't loves to do on Spotify. Guys on Spotify. I'm the most hated but guys on YouTube. On YouTube. Am I the most hated coming out below you? Never Tide. You drive the podcast though. Okay. So you're good. Oh, okay. You're the driver. Some people get mad at the driver, they don't like how he drives, but he gets this wherever you need to go. Okay. Okay. Honestly, I don't contribute.


Do I? No. Get off. No kidding. But like think about Wait, wait. Glad You don yourself. Okay. Think about it. If y'all if, because at the time when we created Yeah, I'll take your cut. Just leave. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Kidding. At the time when we created the podcast, like y'all were, y'all were popping, right? Were y'all like pretty relevant? We created the pod. I mean. I'd like to think I've been relevant for a while. so we think I've only been doing this six years. Do y'all think you would've been, this podcast would've gone crazy? No. Without me. No. I don't think it would've been as big as Quip. Maybe I, I Think, I think that you really helped get it Going. Really? I don't know the podcast so bad. Bad for the first like month or two. Yeah, I don't know. And then just out of nowhere it took off. Yeah, that's what confused me is like, I feel like the Clips used to be Hit the algorithm like the first like two month or two months.


I don't know how long ago we just hit that algo like we never did Good. It's because for some reason all of our YouTube, because you don't really have I mean you do now a little more, but especially at the time you didn't have followers on YouTube A lot. Yeah, not a lot. And we had some following on YouTube, but like crazy. But I don't feel like, I don't much of the audiences 2 million don Don't know. I don't feel like much of our, I feel like the first like month was our cross-promoting on everything. But. we were only at 10,000 subscribers. Yeah. Remember? Remember we were watching it here? Mm. And you were like so hard on your, on your TikTok. We were pushing it on our tiktoks and just nobody was watching. But then all of a sudden YouTube shorts just blew. No. You know what I think Thank you guys for That. Yes. Yeah. Shout out. This is you guys. Shout out the fan. YouTube family. Shout on YouTube. Shout out my mom and Jesus.


No guys, I think what really helped also was posting on TikTok, which Cash never sends me the shorts anymore. If you want the shorts just hit me up. I'll send you all of Em. Actually I will. 'cause, 'cause literally I love, they used to go like get a million likes, you know, I didn't know if you liked posted 'em. So I just didn't see if few, I Love posting the shorts, but I used to actually like do my makeup for the podcast. And now I, now, now I just come back from school and I'm like, yeah, yeah Me too. Wait, All. right, So. what were You saying about Matt? About cash though. Oh, you were saying so Cash always seems like the villain. This bad man. Yeah. Big bad Booy man. Because, because he, he Booy man, he makes jokes and like he's very sarcastic and he just kind of roasts people and he just kind of like hurts people's feelings a lot on the show. I'm so confused. And you guys feel like that's what you guys all the time, not you myself, but in his for from his portrait Per or his per perspective?


My POV from his little POV, he's making comedy, making jokes 'cause it's a comedy podcast after the podcast. He's all love. So we're at this, we're at this meet and greet and like I said, we were doing this meet and greet for free for you guys. And. it was, I worked it And, it was a $5. I Was an employee. She was, we paid her as an employee. She was, Hey guys, this me and Greet was like five years ago and Kate was like 13. Throw our first ones. There was like only like what, 300 people? Four Oh people pair up and we paid all of our friends and everybody we knew in Dallas. Yeah. We paid Alex, we paid Alex. Alex was there to come. Like we paid them to just come take pictures for all the fans in the like, like you give their phones to the Kate and then Kate would take Yeah and just like manage the crop. So Sometimes I like, there was like one time I got tagged like, 'cause I think this like literally is still up on one of their Instagram highlights.


but like they did like a, like a whole like 360 of the venue and like you can see me standing there and I had like my black hair before I started dyeing my hair blonde. And I'm like, wow. I It was black. It was very, very dark brown. Oh Okay. So I'll try again. So we're, we're, so Cash always comes off as the villain. And we're at this venue and it's like three or 400 people and we're trying to make this thing free. so we just ask people to pay $5 if possible, making me to cover the cost. And these people are going through the line. All of a sudden I look to my right, me and Kash been taking photos together with people and he's gone and I'm like, where did he go? So this person comes up and I'm talking to him for a few minutes. He comes back, he ran across the street to buy shoes for a fan because she didn't have shoes.


Okay, you Ran across the street? Yeah. Well mid, mid shoot. He goes, I don't care that all these people are here. Not like to be mean to them. Wow. Not to be mean to them. Yeah. I appreciate Matt, but you were like, you were like, this is more important. So you ran over there and bought them shoes in the middle of the meet and greet or you sent someone to buy them shoes or something? What can I say? and I was like And. I was like, I was like I mean, first off I didn't even notice that people are coming through. They get 20 seconds pretty much. It's like, hey, nice to meet you here, let's get a photo and then we get the photo and we gotta go to the next person. 'cause We have 400 people to meet. Yeah, it was a long meet and greet and yeah, it was like four or five hours standing on our feet taking photos. That was a long one too. I mean I love that. I wish my face from smiling. I was like, eh, my, my, my muscles and my face hurt.


Yeah. That was a long one. So like I was definitely not noticing like people's shoes. But you apparently look at people's feet a lot and you saw like that this person didn't have shoes so you ran over. What did he say? And That was really sweet and talking, you know, I'm liking the glazing map. I really like it. Honestly. Aw appreciate it. Yeah. Moral of the Story. Yeah. Who else wants to glaze Me Kate? What you gotta say? I Gotta say that. You're kind of annoying. Okay. Moral Story is everything is not as it seems. Everything is not as it seems. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
