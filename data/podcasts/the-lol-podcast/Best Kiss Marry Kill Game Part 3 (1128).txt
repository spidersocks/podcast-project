Kinzie says, next time Kate butts into our relationship, you should tell her that it's okay because that's like the third time she's done it And Kate for some reason thinks there's an issue that she needs to like step in. I will Admit right now that it has always been in the back of my mind that Maverick talks to Kinzie in a way that I don't think husband should speak to his wife. Last night, Mavin almost lost his mind. Wow. About this candy we're laying down. Right. Candy Math. It was evil. What she did? You're Eating. Wait, you're evil In the pod.


Hold on. Did you take his candy? No. No. Just listen. If you took his candy, I'm on his side worse. It's like, what time was it? Midnight. We're already in bed. We've been laying down for like 30 minutes and he like, like violently looks over at me. He's like, where's my candy? I was like, I, I don dunno. You Don't understand. You never get those like feelings when you're sleeping and then you wake up and you're like, I have candy. Yeah. You know I do. Actually, it's funny because you know that Kinzie says that because you know I was looking in my candy stash by my bed. Oh yeah. And I noticed it was gone. Mav, Wait, you actually took His candy? Yes. The candy he's eating right now is from my bedside. Well wait, where Did you take the sprees? You didn't even know you had 'em.


Yeah, I Didn't. But I would've looked through his basket. Dane gave us the candy and I assumed, you know he gave it to all of us. No, no. He gave me the candy map. Gave to cash. Were you there when he gave me the candy? No, but it was probably like a to the house kind of candy thing. No, no. It was you type of candy. No, it's to everyone. Anyways, Kinzie. What did he do with his stolen candy? That's not No. I's just like staring right there. No. So he like flips out. Right. He's like, where's my candy? And I was like, I don't know. He's like, what did you, what did you do with it? And I just jokingly, I was like, oh no, is it the freeze dried candy? And he was like, yes, my freeze dried candy. I'm panicked at this point. Y'all understand? She sold it. She was like, oh no where, where's my candy?


And he was like, he immediately stands up off of the bed and he like, looks at me. He's like, you did not throw it away, did you? And I was like, I, I might have, we like cleaned out the room. You know I had Alex take everything to the dump and he was like, you wouldn't throw away my candy. You wouldn't. And I was like, I was like, sure You can we get some more. That's What I was saying. He Starts Pacing. I barely have candy. He not Have candy. Still Thinks he doesn't have a, He still thinks he doesn't have a sugar addiction. Yeah, you have a candy statue now when you're pacing around your room. I Candy go next to your bed right now. Listen, listen, Listen. He's freaking out. Okay. He's pacing back and forth in the bedroom. Okay. He's like, I just, I can't believe you would do that. I can't believe he walks over to my side of the bed and on my nightstand I have like nice stuff.


Okay. On unlike his side of the nightstand. And he picks up my candle. He's like, oh you wanna throw something away of mine that I wasn't finished with? And he like opens it up. He's like, looks like this is halfway finished. It's basically trash. And he goes, throws my away. What? That was her argument for my candy. She goes, well it had been open for a couple days. So I said, oh this looks like it's been open a couple days. Oh my God. This goes hand in hand with the conversation me and you had today. Kate Had a conversation today to me about you and she might be right. What? That I, I told her she wasn't but she might be. What? I said you need to stay out of their relationship. But you know what? She was right. I actually, I said, I said I do stay out of it. I ha I just think that Tell she was telling to Tell.


Y'all are gonna think I'm so involved. But listen, when you live with a, when you live with people, you pick up on literally everything and every day at least once a day, Maverick says something to Kinzie in a tone or something. He says, that just sounds straight up rude. Dude, this is so funny. Y'all aren't gonna believe this. I have to say it now. She told me not to say it, but I have to say it now. Okay. Okay. Wait, pause before you say it. There are some times when Kate is correct in that. Okay? Oh, very rarely. Harper, have you seen Maverick be room to Kenzie? No. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, anyways, For the back here, what are you gonna say? Well, I, I wanna finish the candy story, but here we are. So you, why is he talking in the place? What you said last night?


Yeah. Why are you doing that man? You said what he said last night. Yeah. What did I say last night About the dishwasher or something? You were Like, oh, because last night, yeah, Maverick gets this new spatula in for his grill and he's going to set it in the dishwasher and it's huge. It's not like a normal spatula. It's like this big. It's pretty big Guys. I don't mean to, you know, take away from the spatula story, but like no listen, if we're on the third story, we gotta finish Off here. No. Okay, we're finishing this and then we're gonna go like wrap up everything else. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, he puts this spatula in the dishwasher. I'm just sitting on the couch. I'm not saying anything. He puts a spatula in the dishwasher And Kenzie goes, no, don't put it there. It goes up here. And he just like so rudely okay was like, oh yeah, I don't love when people tell me stupid things that don't make any sense.


And it's Just like, I didn't say that at all. That's crazy. Literally you did. No I did not. Yes, she, he said that and I was like, I didn't say that. I don't even know what I said. But I remember thinking like, wow, I'm so happy that that is not the way my husband speaks to me. I said, why does it go up there? And she said, I just think it cls better. I go. I said it would've cleaned there just as good. There's no reason to to move it. Okay. So anyway, now that we, and then Kate butted in, what did I say? I don't even Remember. She knows she didn't butt in. She never butt in. She did. She did butt in. Okay. Either way. And then Kenzie says this today. Kenzie says that she says, well Wait, I'm gonna confirm if this is correct or not. 'cause he could switch my words around. Okay. Kenzie says, Hey next time Kate butts into our relationship You should, I did not say it like that. Sh you should tell her that it's okay because like we're not mad at each other or anything.


We're just talking. And that's like the third time she's done it and we're not having an issue. Listen. And Kate for some reason thinks there's an issue that she needs to like step in? No. When there's no problem. No, Because there's been a lot of times I haven't said anything because I am aware. Wait, Kenzie, did I say something? What did I say last night? Can someone tell me what I said? You said Maverick, can you please stop? Oh because he's talking so Rude. I Probably did say that. Wait, Kenzie, did you tell Maverick that What I said was not like that? It was semi similar but not like that. I said Hey, hey, the next time like something like that happens, you should tell Kate hey we're not actually arguing. Like we, we know that like she's not actually mad and I'm not upset. We're just messing around with each other. And what did I tell you Kate? I said is people just talk to people differently.


Just like you don't think I, We should talk like that. But other people that's just how they talk and that's how they like talking. I said I Kenzie said this is what Kenzie said after she said now it's gonna come up sometime on the podcast or something and Kate's going to say, you're Leaving parts out. You're leaving parts Out. She said parts out And she said, and she's gonna say, we fight all the time. No, when we're not even fighting, we're just messing around. It's not a fight. I just, Alex, she said this word for word would happen and here we are because this crazy, Listen, I will never say anything ever again. And You know what I said? I said, well when Kate does that, we should just tell her she doesn't need to gossip. So gossip We're on a podcast are what? What the wait I don't get it. Gossip. Yeah, like I don't get it.


Talk about other people and their problems, things like that. I also said that it was not Gossip. Were you guys all Not the one that just looked through my phone last episode and put me on blast video all and terribly gave us that it made me call the girl from six years ago. Whoa. That I don't even know if that was, Lemme tell you from my perspective. So Kate, you don't feel bad because that's Maverick's version of the story. Well she said Make Kate feel bad. That's what she said. No, I sure did not say that. Why would I ever say that? That Kenzie would never say that? Yeah, what happened was I told him, Hey, whenever Kate thinks that we're arguing, unless it's an actual argument, then don't say anything. But if we're not Actually actually upset with each other, you should tell her, hey, we're not actually upset with each other. So that way she doesn't think that we argue all The time. Wait, Why don't you just tell her that Kenzie, that's what I say.


She goes, that's the third time Kate's done that. Do you think she thinks we're actually upset with each other? Well typically, typically It is. I say yeah. I said I'll tell her stay outta our business next time. She goes, no don't say that. I don't say that. Say just say hey we're not actually upset. I said no, I'm just gonna tell her she needs to mind her own business. No, but typically it is you have done something that Kate does not agree with. So she's speaking to you. Coming for that from Maverick is crazy. 'cause anytime Maverick heard me and Kate slightly arguing, he will come out of his room to watch. Yeah, yeah. Watch two watch is insane. Watching like is fair. Listen, if two people are yelling at each other, I'm coming to the watch. I'll Always, I'll admit right now that it has always been in the back of my mind that Maverick talks to Kinzie in a way that I don't think a husband should speak to his wife.


But I'm also not a part of the relationship. But I've always been like, is Kenzie like too scared to say something? Or is she like okay with it? I mean like y'all just got married, y'all are like, like is she scared to say something in front of other people? I don't gonna lie guys, I'm totally bored with this conversation. That is crazy. Change this subject. I am, I am astronomically just bored. Hold on, I'll never I'm sorry. You're, I'm sorry to you Maverick. I'm sorry to both of y'all that I was just What About me and Harper? Huh? Well I'm sorry you sorry guys. Yeah, I'm sorry. Because we have to deal with the boredom. No, I'm sorry that I overstepped in any way and I made comments that you guys did not appreciate and I will not do it anymore.


No, no, no. Wait. Yay. Oh there's more. I did not not appreciate your concern or comments. The concern was okay, she said this is insane. Can we please move On? I just wanted it to be clear that we were not arguing. Okay. I won't say anything and I Can Harper say something. Can I just please Harper Say something Here let me get it. What?

Kate does have some good teeth. Not gonna lie. She had the best, she had braces. I did. I had braces. Matt, I got mine. Have braces. Yeah's. True. That's a Good point. I, my braces were terrible.

Well you're, That's, that looks like there's your Oklahoma. I would expect nothing Less. No, no. But you don't understand.


It literally just looks like green, like nasty stuff in your teeth. No, That was the thing with braces is like every color I was gonna get, I was like, it would just look like food in my teeth. And for some reason in my head, black would not, I did black and red. It was black, red, black red, black, red. I did like blue. I did blue a lot. And then I did hot pink. Orange and orange. How long did you have your braces on? Two. One Dad. How long? Like two years? Yeah. A year and a half. Yeah. A year and a half. Two years. That's Pretty quick. I had mine on for five. Okay. Insane.

Not mine. Was it pretty, you guys have braces? My guy like, did you been so hard? Do you have braces on your teeth? Well it's worth it 'cause my teeth are absolutely flow.

She had the Invisalign. No, Invisalign was cheaper actually than braces. What is it? What? Oh, That does make a little sense. At least for my teeth. It was. Wow. But where y'all went to the dentist and y'all got like, I don't know what y'all did with braces, But cranked up And like cranked them and like made 'em tighter? No. With Invisalign it was basically like a retainer kind of. But you had little dots on your teeth that hooked them into place and you had to pull 'em out every single time you eat. Yeah. So imagine re cranking your teeth after every single meal.
