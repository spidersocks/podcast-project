You know what game we should play? It's that game where we give a scenario and we're seeing how you would scream, like how you would scream if, Oh, this sounds fun. This was happening to you. So Maverick. Okay. How would you scream? How would you scream if you were in, if you were on land. Yeah. And you looked behind you and you saw a alligator running like 30 miles per hour at you.


And Oh, I'm gone. I don like alligators scream. I don't know about even scream. I just be gone. I hate alligators, man. No, no, no. One of the guys is hitting the Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa.

And you hear like loud banging, like on your, on your door. Yeah. Once again. No, No, that's not the scenario. Okay. Uhoh. And then I know where this is going. And then Someone busts through the door and it's cash, but he has his butt out. I'm like, oh, maybe like a Mm.


No, no. It's honestly gonna be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. That's actually pretty accurate. He does that already. That is, that Is exactly what he says. Okay. We can scream as loud as we want guys. Oh yeah. It's my house, my rules. It's Not your house. I like it. But it can be your rules. So go for it. Scream as loud. As loud As You can. No, y'all gimme a scenario. Oh, okay. But Like, it's actually scary. Okay. I got a scenario. Okay. I got a good one. No, I got you. Look, look in the mirror. What? Your mic. Oh, okay. My joke didn't hit. Move on. Okay, Here we go. Harper. Yeah, you are. Let's see. You are, he didn't even have one. No, I have one. I have a have one. Ready? No. Genuinely Scary. Ready? No, I got you. Okay. Okay. Ready? Thank you. You are traveling through a land.


It looks like Nia. Okay. And all of a sudden there is a dark creature off in the distance in the woods. You're not sure what it is, but it looks bad. And then you remember this person told you that this creature might would kill you in a prophecy and you're in a musical and you have to scream right now. Now just, Just, just gimme your thing. What? I wanted to hear your musical screen. That was la huh? Okay. I'm running. No, you're, my scenario for you is you're walking down the street by yourself and a mysterious van pulls up next to you and jumps out and starts trying to grab you. It sounds Very similar. Are You ready?


Ready. Yeah. But, but like, your only hope is you scream loud and someone hears you to come to help. Come over here. Stop. Okay. That pretty, that pretty good out. That was real. Yeah. I felt like I was there. I don't Ever, She's like grabbing at her knees Though. If we bleep that, it's just 'cause it sounded so terrifying. You don't want to hear it. No. When mom was saying his scenario, it reminded me of this one time cash was camping. Yeah. He went, he went camping one time. Did he screamed like that? That's crazy. Oh, I know what time you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. It, I was Camping Embarrassing by myself. I was camping by myself and it was nighttime. And Kate was coming. Kate was coming to my tent. So I see her like way up.


You thought she was the scary, dark creature from your pro? No, no. I see her park. So I run away from my tent and I hide in the woods. And you literally, you have to walk through the woods to get to my tent. And I mean, no one's out there. It's just me. Oh. And she, I see her walking through the woods and I'm like, now it's my time to sign. She has a lantern and all the stuff that she's bringing me like a bunch of, a bunch of food and everything and a lantern. And I just am running at her. She's full sprint. No, I don't say anything. Nothing. I'm not screaming. I'm just, that's almost more terrifying. It's so scary. And she just hears me coming and she just takes off. She just, but but, but lemme tell you. Did she drop the No, she held everything. She was like, and she didn't Scream or Anything?


Nothing. No scream. Nothing. Just silent. Go silent with the lantern. Just, just silent. And it was a silent run. I was silent and she was silent. It was just, all you hear is leaves. Just At one point I would know. And you were like kicking. Yeah. I finally caught up to her because she's slow. Even when she's running for her life. Why got scream. And you know, I, like I said, there's, you had to go through the woods and it was pretty secluded. But there was a lot of people right outside the woods. Like if you scream, someone would hear you. There was people there, but she was just like, I run. I, No, the reason I didn't scream is because I think some part of me knew I wasn't like actually in danger. And I knew that if I started screaming, I would just be like disrupting everyone else's piece.


And then when I got close to her, because like I said, she's slow, so it didn't take very long. How far do you ride? I caught up to her and I caught right behind her. And she literally just goes, no. And that was it. Just no. And that's how she would've died. Just No. And then I started sobbing. I was really upset. Yeah. Then after I was like, ah, she, I was sad. Kaley's the same way. She doesn't scream. I Can, I tried to scare her and I was like, they're coming for you all a sudden. Boom. Right in the face. Just literally punched me. You Can't scare me. It's not nice. And she's like, I'm sorry, I got scared. What? That's valid. No kids not laughing about that situation where you're quietly running and leaves. And he said, no. No. It was no, I was also like 17.


Like, I didn't know it was a perfect, I feel like you were 17. Like if I Was being chased in the woods, now I'm screaming. No, You wouldn't. Did he not know it was cash? No, she did not know. I don't care what she says. She was running. No, I, I didn't, I didn't know it was him. How far? But I was How far did y'all run? Sorry. Like, no, probably like a hundred feet. Hey, you also remembered in, in, in mine. 'cause we didn't really finish mine. You didn't really gimme a scream. So you remember that the bad guy no runs off when you scream. But you have to sing scream. No, He's still coming man. Nobody likes this. Really. Cash has been trying to challenge me all week and I won't play a stupid little game.


And Maverick, I think you will play a stupid little game. Who is it? Oh, Play a stupid little game. Bye. I'll play your stupid little game. No, the game is, you have I think like three or four minutes. I think it's like four minutes. And you both write down as many states as You can and whoever can get the most states written down wins states. Yeah. Why Don? We do countries because I Can do all 50 states. Oh, I Can probably do 'em an alphabetical order. No, I saw this bro. I wanna do It so badly. Kate doesn't think I can do it. What I I Can name all 50 states in six. I Can name all I Can. I Can Six minutes. Six Seconds. I can do it In 60 seconds. Wait, we'll do it here in a minute. I Can do six in a minute.

I never heard the song. Yeah. I don know if we should do that on here. Yeah. It's, it, it would literally just be a Oh yeah. Well let's mention a screaming game. K How do you scream if you saw Kate but she had a knife and, and she was right ne next to your side just staring at you and you woke up and you're like, and she wouldn't stop moving. You're like, stop Kate, stop. Stop it. Please stop. And then she, Her eyes just roll back Into, and then her eyes roll back into her head and blood starts point pointing.

No, you did not know. Wait, What? Did you figure it out? Your, Your mom? Yeah, I knew it. No, You didn't shut up. You did not know. Yeah, I did know.

No, It's, yo, I felt like I was in a real argument. It's when you threw the phone. I was like, and I thought it was my phone and I was like, no way. You know what Sucks? K is you threw the phone, it bounced off the wall and landed in her lap and Really? Yeah. So she Immediately picked it up and Realized it wasn't hers.

That's what I'm saying. No, I, I, I, for like five seconds or for like five minutes. I was like, wait, this is real. 'cause what Kate said, that's what I'm saying, Hot. The phone case thing had this on it, and she thought she just left that on because she put, she put that phone case on literally like an hour ago. Yeah, bro, you look so angry. You made that painting fall. That's never happened. Never happened. That's a new painting to fall did.


When, when Kate said, when Kate said, all let's just go home. Hey. That's when I was like, Hey, did you? Yeah. Oh no. I'm not gonna lie. Everyone, everyone was in. No, I was in on it. Harper, Harper hates when we break her every time. She's like, I do the whole time. The No, I genuinely, I genuinely, If you never one of our prank, have you ever said We got you? Because you've never gotten mad like that. You've never actually gotten like genuinely mad. But then you went, you Should've seen him in the airport. Sweet. But when Kate said, all right, let's just go home. I was like, about to get up and like, what? Like, actually, but I, I knew this wasn't my phone 'cause I saw Oh yeah. Okay. Whatever. I promise you. No, you did not. I swear. We, you just said a while ago, you go, I must've forgot to take it out. No. Yeah. So you thought it was your phone Feed into it. Oh shit.


Literally, guys, every single time you have pranked Harper, every single time she goes, oh, I knew the whole time. Yeah. I knew I was, I was going along with it. Actually. I, I was playing into it. Okay, fine. Maybe y'all got me. Maybe, bruh. I could see it in your eyes, but I, I really wanna watch it back when the phone flies into her own lap. Dude, you It's shattered. It's just I know. Wait, why did you do the wall? Oh, dude. No, I was trying to get you to give her the phone back. 'cause you were pretty mad. I was like, you need to give it back and then take it again. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, that why I was it back? Yeah, you should joking. Because then I would've actually thought it was real if I didn't see the phone. Like You, she's, I've ne you know, I used to think, I used to think Maverick was the most inden denial human on the earth. But now I think it's hard for her.


Yeah. But like, genuinely get this way. Frank. I thought he was mad. Like, I thought he was actually mad at freaked me off for a second. Hey, I think my acting skills are pretty on. Like with Dwayne the Rock, I felt like dude was the normal time you're yelling at me. I mean, I felt like it, like it was so natural when I look at Matt to just be like, why you man? Like, I think anyone else, it would've been hard. But math, I just like, yeah, that, and I walked out, I hit the water bottle on the way out. I was like, I know. I was like, what? And that's when I was like, oh wait, maybe. But I, I thought it was fake right there. But then when he walked downstairs and hit the wall and then pave got up and he was like, yo, chill out. Ka That's when I was like, oh, what the, it's quite serious. It's quite serious actually.


No, I'm not gonna, I would love to know. Dang. I sh Kate was involved in on this, but man, I wish she wasn't. I would've loved to see what Kate done. Oh my gosh. Wait, if I, what would you have done if I asked if I grabbed Harper's phone and just if that whole situation just happened, but you thought it was really her phone. I mean, I'd be pretty mad at you. That's it. That'd be so funny. That's it. Yeah. I'd freak out. Yeah. But like, what would you do? Would you like, I'd probably grab you and be like, stop it. We had to fake this plan out far ahead. We got matching phone cases. Yeah. To get Harper to switch her phone case. That's crazy. So we put the bad phone in. There's, we had to, the last episode we got, we gave them all phone cases and we were like, hopefully she'll just take it and put it on her phone.


Then if they change to that. And then we had a fake phone set up under there and Cass us through it. Yeah. So if you guys wanna watch us on the Christmas episode, I gave them all three matching phone cases. So then the dummy phone would have the same exact phone case. That's crazy. Oh my gosh. That was well planned out. Honestly, I wish nobody was in on it besides me. That would've been the best part, dude. Yeah. I would've, I would've loved to. See I messed up. I should have done that. Man. All, all, everyone in the room would've just been out. No, you should've told Mav what? Because then y'all would've had a real altercation. I might have hit you. The might might. We've been on the ground or through the wall or something. He's got me a choke.


I'm gonna call the police. He's wild. Oh, that would've been so good. I would've loved to see everyone's reaction. Oh my goodness. Alex, by the camera would've been Alex would, Alex would've just been like, Yeah, he would like, Alex was like, never stop filming. They always told me to never stop filming. He's like, but I need to take cover. I don I just Like, I don't wanna catch a string like what your mom would've done. Oh my gosh. Her mom just left. But if your mom was here, oh my gosh, that Would've been crazy. We weren't gonna get her in on it. Yeah. But then she, gosh, she left. She Should have No, but imagine if she wasn't in on it. And I just grab Harper's phone and just, she She would be like, that's what she deserves. I don't think she would say that.


Yes, she would. I don't think she would. She wouldn't even be mad at cash. She'd be like, cash. Break her iPhone. Break her iPhone right Now. Break the AirPods too. Oh, I already broke those. Well, well there's that. Well, one day I want all y'all to prank me on the podcast. We've pranked like you, you, I've pranked you for sure. I don't think you've pranked me. Oh, you definitely have.

I never Something. Comment down below if we've ever pranked. Wait. You know, honestly, wait, what's The thumbnail That I broke Harper. Breaking Harper's IPhone. Yeah. Destroy Harper's iPhone. But I think if that was all or all, if I didn't tell any of y'all that and I just planned it by myself, That would've been, I Think Matt would've been mad. But I think Kate would've been the one I had to watch out for. I think Kate would've been on me. Man. She would've, she would've grabbed Harper and been like, we're leaving. No, she would've been on me. I mean, on me. Like, I would be maverick's punches. I'd be like, listen man, come on Kate. I can't, it's not like I Can hit her back or block it. I think she would've just been throwing things at you. No, I Definitely would've been aggressively grabbing you. 'cause you were like raging like a toddler. But, Well, hey, I think that's gonna make a great intro though.


The intro is gonna go crazy. Oh, that intro is gonna Go Crazy. Y'all look at my reaction when it, the phone hit the wall. 'cause I thought it was actually my phone. I was like, I was like, She made no noise. Everyone else was yelling. Harper's just like, But phone. Yes. I'll start over on block Blast Harper. What did you think before he threw the phone though? Because they were just sitting there arguing and you're like, oh, I was on my phone. Yeah, I was, I was just like, oh, wait. Like I, I, I shouldn't have been on my phone. 'cause I know, I know that. I know. I really shouldn't have been on my phone this time. No, no. Lemme tell you, you getting on your phone does not bother me that Much at all.


I would hope not. But no, I does. I was just like, I was just like, no. I was like, where Do you think the idea came from? I was just like, oh yeah. I like, they don't like when I go on my phone, like, nobody likes it. No. Not even the audience. And I was like, yeah, I shouldn't have gone on it. But like, he's definitely like over exaggerating it for the podcast. But then when they started getting in a fight, I was like, what the Dude, I don't know what I would do. Like if Harper grabbed my phone, he's like, Stop on your phone. Her and her and Reese are arguing in my phone, just in Harper's hands. Like Harper. Okay. Okay. I need That. That Would've been good if that didn't happen. Gosh, just got Astray. Just no.


Harper's Face did drop when you threw it though. She was Like, I, I went. You looked like she looked like you just stepped on her puppy in the arms. Did someone Please put that music behind the phone? Flying against The wall? Low motion. Just the black and white. There goes my TikTok career and Everything. Everything. Yeah. I don't even know my TikTok password. Like I, There goes everything. It Gets locked outta her account. Oh, that Would suck. We had a lot of drafts. Oh my gosh. Gosh. Oh gosh. I should really back up all my Stuff. Yeah, that phone is actually plastic too. That's crazy. This looks so real. I had it, dude. I had it since it's plastic and not a glass phone. I had to take a knife and scratch the phone. Yeah, I was gonna say it looked Scratched to Make it look like purse.


No, to make it look cracked. Oh, you Should have just put a screen protector on it and cracked it. Well, Kenzie, we're not all that smart now, Are we? Okay, wait. So Kate, When you told me to scream loud, was that for me to look at my phone? Yeah. Okay. That's what I thought. I was like, yeah. Oh yeah. Surprisingly Harper wasn't picking up her phone this episode. I was waiting and I was like, pick it up so I Can grab it. And she never did. So I had to text Kate like, Hey, text Harper so she can get on her phone and I Can grab It. I was like, okay. Because She was like, I don, I don't even get on my phone. I was like, of course this is the episode. She wouldn't get on her phone. I started to start texting her, but then I didn't want her to be like, I was only on my focus. Maverick is texting. It's like She would've ratted me out. And then we're just arguing. Twist. We mix up the phones and he throw maps at the wall instead.
