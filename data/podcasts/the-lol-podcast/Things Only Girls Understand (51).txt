You know what else is sad about that? What? We paid for the seats that like do the little motion. Yes. It's supposed to be like four DD Box. That is not the movie. You should buy those seats. No, but it was fun. I loved those Seats. Extra $10 piece.

Well, well I turned my dbox seat off in case you guys were wondering. Oh my. That's thing. Yeah, we did thing to do. Dude, I'm not even kidding. Three minutes into the movie, I look over Kate just turned her seat off. It. It's supposed to like do all the motions with the movie Kate Js KK was like, not for me. That might be the lamest thing you could actually do. Pay for the seat that moves and then just be like, I'm sorry too to the movie. No, Maybe I lasted like 20 and maybe if you guys would've taken me to a better movie. But you took me to the Minecraft movie So it barely even moves. And you were like, no, No, it was so bad. I wanted to just fall asleep. And I was like, well, I can't fall asleep. And my chair keeps vibrating.


Did you fall asleep? Did you really fall asleep? I tried to, but It didn't work. Yeah, she did. You dunno if she did, bro. She was trying to fall asleep and she wanted both of my hands to cuddle. Yeah, she wanted both of them. So I was trying to do some popcorn. I was like, I was like, maybe I could just have a little bit of popcorn and then she'd grab my hand and be like, and I was like, I mean, both hands is crazy. I was like, oh. They were sitting and separate chairs. Oh. Trying to, there Was like A whole like blockade between them two. Yeah. So she had me literally like sitting, they were this get all the way over there. They were sitting this far apart. That's, That's Crazy. So she had me like this because she wanted to hold both of my hands and I'd be like, maybe I could just get a little sip of my icy. Oh, nope. Okay. I was trying to guys, I was just like, why would we do this right now? I don't know. Should we bury someone in it?


Yeah. I found my phone. Yo, why Would cash, why would you do this? Do what? You just saw this Big mess. You just, I don I don know this was gonna happen. First of all, This is, I did not start this. Oh My God. This is Probably what the inside of our duvet looks like. 'cause it's like a feather down duvet. Oh. You Know, I'd love To talk about our duvet. What's a duvet? But This is just disgusting and I don't know what to do. Yeah. Out nar. Yeah. Or nar. Like literally guys, I don't understand like why we would like throw feathers around like this. Like okay. Poppy, Poppy bounce house is one thing. Throwing feathers everywhere is another. Yeah. 'cause I'm not clean. What? Yeah. You know what, you know what this reminds me of? Your mom, you know when you're in the shower, Adam Sandler.


Oh no. You know what this reminds me of? When you're in the shower and you're washing your hair and there's just hair sticking to your hands 'cause your hair's falling out and the shower and you just can't get it off your hands and you're just like, you're covered in hair and it won't go away. And so the last thing You can do is crumble it all up and stick it to the wall so it gets off Of you. Yeah. Oh gosh. I, I recently lived with a woman. That's what this feels like now that I'm married. And let me tell you, the hair sticking to the wall thing is not okay. Yeah. That's whack. Do you do that Harper? This the person. I don't, I noticed that all my friends do what? I don't do it. That's, that's a respect. Respect. You just let it go down the not respect. I don't, I literally, I watch You don't shed. I watch all. Oh, I do, but I watch all my friends like put it on the wall like that.


And I don't do that. You watch your friends shower? Yeah. What the You'll shower With them. Okay, we'll move on also. Anyways. Yeah. Kenzie kenzie's hair. She takes it and she puts it on the wall, right? Yeah. And then I go in there to shower and I'm like, Have you ever seen her do it? What was that? I look at it and there's just a pile on the wall. And then I tell her after, yo, you be quiet. Okay. I I tell her after and she's like, oh yes, I'm sorry, I forgot I left that there. And you know, purposely put there. I mean, bud. Whatcha doing? Whatcha doing? I thought we go farther down. No, you down. Turn it on. Turn it on. Oh, oh, let it go. Hey wait. Another one. Did You see that?


No. Okay. No. It's coming right back at me. Oh gosh. Awesome. Okay. That's enough. No, listen. No, no more fans. It's all contained. Okay. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think the fan's working bud. It's not really cleaning it up. It's in fact you're actually just pushing it more in my direction. It's actually, it's coming over here. I mean, I feel great. That's epic. Epic fail. Yeah. But have you ever seen Kinzie do it though in the shower? Pull it off? No. Oh, You ever seen me put it on the wall? No. I I, after every single shower, I take it off the wall and I put it in the trash can. But this one time I didn't take it off the wall and he was like, what is that?


You Know what? But, but I, no, no. Time out. Time out. But why do you say no? No time out? Yeah, time out. Why do you girls do that anyway? Why, why do, why what in girls' brains make them go. Oh, that would be a good idea. It's Because when you're washing, you can't just throw it down the drain. 'cause it clogs the drain. Yeah. So you have to like stick it to the wall so it doesn't go nowhere. So You can throw it away later. Now I'll admit I let it sit there for like a day or two after because I washed my hair every day. A day or Two? Two. That's insane. Yeah. One time I came in and it was in a heart shape. She was making art with it and she left it there. She, one time I came in and she spelled out, I love you in her hair. Okay. Not attractive case. Yeah. That's gonna sit there and grow mold.


He's gonna be like asbestos. I know it equals out because cash leaves his ice cream wrappers and his Chobani. Yeah. Bottle thing I've ever, our shower. What? Everybody, everybody eats now and then the shower. You leave ice cream in the shower. No they don't. I What You leave ice cream in the shower or Eat ice cream in the shower? I Can honestly say tries I've never eaten while taking a shower. I don't like It. Well y'all, I don this either. No one thing. No, seriously. Lemme tell you. Don't You just get water in your Chobani? Here's the things I eat in the shower. I drink my yogurt. I eat ice cream. I eat popsicles. Listen, every single time you start with in the shower, I eat. Everyone thinks you're weird. It's wrong. The fact that it's multiple things.


Yeah. Try it, try it. Take a popsicle in the shower and you will, your life will be changed. Stop Acting like it's just a simple popsicle. I have walked in on you eating a plate of panda es express a bigger plate. What do you mean you're eating orange chicken in the shower? It's not weird if the water's hitting your back and you're just eating like this. I love eating and I love warm showers. I get best of both worlds. Why don't you try taking a bath or something? I do that too. That's for my bigger meals. When I'm eating like steak, I'm not, I'm being serious. I eat steak in the, in the bathtub. This Has to be worse for you than like smoking, like inhaling all this. Oh, I'm Getting feather lung right now. Yeah. No, it's natural. It's from the earth. Wait, Robert, If you don't, if you don't put your hair on the shower, like What do you You do, you do, do you do like when you're washing your hair?


'cause when you wash your hair, your hair naturally just falls out. So where do you, your body, you don't put it down the drain, do you? No, I, it just goes to the bottom of the shower and I like, like kind of wipe it off. So You let it go down the drain? Yes. Oh well that's worse. You're just like clogging your drain. I know, but then I like to clean it out. Oh, oh no, no. That's way you like to clean it out. Listen, I, I clogged the drain here and math had to like stick this little like tool down there blue thing and like, yes. And it came out and it was so disgusting. I love doing it. I love watching videos of it. Have You ever, well, I'm assuming not. What are you saying? Do you have a Sentence you're gonna Say? Why do you stop mid-sentence? Well, wait, let me say something.


Have you ever, have you ever flushed a tampon? And then, Oh, okay. Why are we talking about that? Didn't you clogged the pipes? You know what your Hesitation was necessary. Have You? No, I've never flushed a tampon and clogged the pipes. Okay. I'm not even What happened after you did it? Were you like, oh no, I'm not even a female and I know you're not supposed to flush a tampon down the toilet. Okay, I see the signs in bathrooms. Guess you are. I Can him on the toilet. Wait, wait. You see the signs that say don't flush tampons down the toilet in the bathroom? Yes, in the men's restroom. Some Restrooms are multi people. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. And sometimes I walk into the wrong one. Like for instance, when I went to the casino and I was so worried about my loss, I was checking my bake statement and then I look up and I'm in the female's restroom.


How long were you in there? What About as long as it took me to find the urinal. Okay. Can I was very confused when there was no urinal in the room. It's like, what'd they do with the urinals? This is what is going on. Did it smell better in the girl's bathroom? It was way, way more fancier. I'm pretty sure they even had like chocolate mints in there. And then chocolate mints. And another lady came in and she was like, oh. And she like runs outta the bathroom. And then I was like, dude, she just like came in my bathroom like that that how embarrassing for the lady. And then, and then she walked back in and I was like, it's me. Huh? I'm, I'm the problem. And I'm the one in the wrong restroom. Well, I actually did walk in on my crush going pee once on purpose, like going Pee once. Who, who says It like that?


No, no, no. Like So he was going pee. He was, he was doing the pee. No, it was a girl. But I And you walked in On Purpose? No, no. I, yeah, I walked in on purpose. 'cause I was, and You just faked it. You're like, oh no, I was in, I was in kindergarten and I walked into the restroom. I was like, AR no, I literally just saw him anar like, this is so bad. Anar. And so I walked down. I was like, I'm so sorry. Like all that a no. Yeah. And then what, did you guys share a pre sign or something? Yes. Oh my gosh. This is tickling my nose. Yeah. Did y'all used to, I mean this is probably not, I'm gonna sound like such an idiot, but I'm gonna say it anyways 'cause there's maybe one person out there who did This. Wait, I wanna hear more stuff that you guys think is normal. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She was in the middle of a sentence. Yeah, but she's gonna change the talk.


Don't interrupt your wife like that. We'll circle back. Don't worry. We'll circle back. Don't change topics. When you, when you're in the bathroom and you're, you're just sitting there in like kindergarten, first grade and you stare down to the floor. And in, in my elementary school, they had like square tiles that were really small and I would just stare at 'em so long that I would start like hallucinating. Y'all ever do that? Do Yeah. Instead of start Shaking Me, get this right. You stare at some tile and then you just started hallucinating and seeing things. I'm picturing Kenzie at five on the toilet start. Or if feet don't even touch in the ground. Actually didn't touch the, I don't think her feet touched the ground right now. She like, she's just staring at the tile and then sudden she's like squares. She's like, I'm hearing voices. Wait, Harper, do you know I'm talking about squares On The I know exactly what you're saying.


Talking about, because when I'm using the restroom and I'm like really hunched over like this. Oh, y'all are talking about the zone out. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, the zone outs. That's a different thing. Yes. And you, and you look down at the, the danger zone. You look down on the squares and then you like start hallucinating. You like seeing rainbow almost and you're Like, yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Wait. But that's only when one. Oh, I think that's when you're like losing blood flow to your head. 'cause your head's so far over. Okay. Yeah. Oh no. You're hanging your head off. Oh, It could be maybe. I don't know. Yeah. Cool. Scientific evidence. Mav. I wasn't. That was cool. Okay, well we have some fans here today. Hilarious. Hilarious. Kate thought was funny. He was keeping that joke for A while. That, that was funny.


That joke was off the knob. I don't Get that. I don't get that. Oh, corn on the cob, not knob. Get it. Well, oh, like My love. That really blew Me away. Okay. Oh Well. Okay. Well back to what Kate was talking about. What is more stuff like putting freaking your hair on the wall. Cash Hates Me. Did that camera get bumped? It got bumped probably. Yeah. Hey, fix that camera. Sorry. Continue. Ooh, You're talking about me. I wanna just know more things that you guys. Well I will never understand. I actually had an experience. This Is so bad. I like this week. Oh, sorry. Keep going. Oh, You're good.


Did you have something? Oh, no, no, no. Alright. Oh, Sorry. Mav, it Just came up. No, I had an experience this week. So we were filming a YouTube video and it was a nail art video. So Maverick calls me and says, Hey Kate, we're filming a video where you're gonna be doing your nails. Yes. I said, I already have my nails done. He said, go get them taken off. Oh. So I was like, okay, I'll go get my nails taken off. I go to the nail salon and they take my nails off. Yeah. And then the day we were supposed to film, we didn't. So I went like three or four days without my nails and I'm not used to that. And so I realized how different my life is because I'm so cautious of not breaking my nails. And one thing I was able to do was open my own diet Coke can. Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.


Y'all Can't open cans with nails? No. Well you had to like, you Had to like, so what do you guys do if no one's home? You're just like, well no, you have to use, because I'm not drinking that You have to use like your fingertip and get it under there. Get your, because if you use Like, you have to like shove it under there. Or I use my mouth sometimes. Sometimes I'm like, Oh, that can't good. Your teeth Can, oh, you wanna know something? I have a special talent where I Can open bottles that spin or bottles that need to use bottle openers and I Can just take 'em off of my teeth. Oh, That's not good for you. No. You can swear. No, You don't get a bottle promise. I will get one next episode. There's no way I, We will get one of those next episode for you to do that. I Can be good. Oh, speaking of your teeth. Your teeth. You wanna do something funny? Yeah.


I Can just take a photo of you on AI and it'll just take your tooth out. I Can send it to your mom and say, you lost your tooth on the episode. Yeah, Let's do it. She's like, I Can it. I don't think she's run it. I don't think she's gonna believe that. I Don't think she will either. But when you have nails, you can't open it 'cause it breaks your nails. So I, I was like, wow, I Can open my diet coke can. So that's not normal for me. That is just insane that you guys can't open stuff with your freaking nail things. Only girls will understand. Wow.

And Also wore hair ties on my wrist. You remember scrunchies when, when girls would try to give guys scrunchies and make 'em wear them? I remember one time when, when you Guys, that's pretty su No, no, No. I, I got a story for y'all. I'm confessing into this fan. I'm sorry. So one time Casia Maverick. Long, long time ago, many years ago, they did their own tour. Casia Maverick. Are you upset? What? You sound like you're upset. Yeah. This is normally how a story starts when Kate's mad. No. So it's fine. It's funny. So Kasha Maverick along many years ago did their own tour. What was it? The whatever it takes tour. Yes. They did the whatever it takes, whatever.


Where They performed the songs, views. Sorry. Oh my gosh. Did any of you guys go to the whatever it takes, tour, side note, whatever. Crazy if y'all 50 views, if you guys went to the whatever it takes tour and then you also still watch the podcast. You're a real one anyways. You an og would I, so Cas and Mav were on tour and I went to the Oklahoma City show and I'm sitting up with the family and stuff and the girls all start shooting their scrunchies on stage. This was 2019. Okay. It was the vibe at the time. You have to understand. So they're being pelted with scrunchies. I mean hundreds of scrunchies flying just Left and right there. I Felt like, yeah, if you guys wanna throw scrunchies at any of our LL podcast shows, podcast shows feel free. I felt like told Kai, dodging 'em on.


No you weren't. And that was the issue. You see that's where the whole issue came in is I am in love with cash silently. Okay. And he was in love with me. Whether he wants to admit it or not, I, We all knew Whether he wanted to admit it or not. He was in love with me. But he didn't act like it this Day. Yeah, I did. Yeah I did. I made out with you that day. Okay, Well besides the Point What? Yeah I did in the back room. So anyways, pretty much, pretty much the girls are out throwing scrunchies on stage and I see this hot pink scrunchie fly and all these scrunchies were like a light pink. This one was hot. It was the only one. So cash picks up the hot pink scrunchie and puts it on his wrist. And I said Uhuh Uhuh. And I was mad because I just watched my husband put another girl scrunchie on his wrist.


Not your husband. A guy you were going to kiss later that night. Yeah. So my husband had another girl scrunchie on his wrist. So I took batters into my own hands after the show. The boys had brought all the scrunchies back to the green room and I went back there. For what? Well they just had to pick 'em up off the stage. Oh. And I went back there. We had A big scrunchie fest. Yeah. And they were pretty much like, well what are we gonna do with all these scrunchies? And then they were like, Kate, would you like a scrunchie? And I said I would actually. And I took the one off his wrist and I took that one and I still have it To this day. Don't Use it. No way. That's crazy. I don't use it. I just have it like at my parents' house in like my dresser or something. That's crazy man. Shout. Shout out to the girl with the hot peak scrunchie in Oklahoma City.


In Oklahoma City and November, 2019. I'm sorry. Okay. I had jealousy issues. Kate. Kate now owns your scrunchie. I know. I own that scrunchie. Alright, Kenzie, what do you got? You own that Other one. Alright, let's hear it. You own that. I'm not Gonna say anything. I'm just gonna Show. Oh yeah, it's the picture. I forgot. We gotta look at the pictures. It's Tragic. Alright, lemme see. Let's see what we got here Is like a goof. I really want to hit him with all that padding in there. Yeah, same. I don't understand why he is not stopping his shirt more. It's really Embarrassing for him. Oh, I know what that is. I know what that is. That's easy. That that's easy. That's easy. Don't take too long now. Don't get too long. You look at It forever. Nah, I like that for like two sec. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Wait. I understand.


I'm thinking what would people throw on stage at us That because like scrunchies are probably Like popcorn and water bottles and boo us off. No, but like scrunchies are 2019. Like what's 20? Oh, Make, make products from Sephora. Maybe Harper, like gift cards, money. No, that would be dangerous. Do you think you understand Av? I do. I Know what It's what do you think?

The little lead piece fell out. The piece that you draw with fell out And anything else It was snapped Snap.


It was, it was small. No, it snapped. I don't know. The cap is too, it did not snap. That was the cap. Yeah. Oh. The fact that it was so used that there was like only a little bit left. Oh, so nothing broke. Yeah. Well the last Little Piece Fell out. Yeah. And then the, there was, it's probably a discontinued lip shade because brands like to do that and so You can't repurchase your favorite lip shade. Wait, so I was right. No, that I, oh my gosh. I love Bath and Body Works, but they suck for their stupid limited edition smells 'cause they hook me and 'cause I want the smell and I smell it and I love it and I wanna marry it and then it's gone.
