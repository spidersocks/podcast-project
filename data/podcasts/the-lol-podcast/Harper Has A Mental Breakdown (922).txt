Seriously? Is that like an actual thing? Yeah, apparently Because Kate, Kate had a major life change recently. Major life change. Recently Kate spoke to a doctor I didn't speak, which told her that if she does some serious life changes, she's gonna go on a very, very strict diet. It's very hard.


Very difficult. Matthew, you didn't even describe what she's trying to fix here. I'm getting there. Okay. If she goes on this very, very intensive diet, that is gonna be life changing for her. She might can get rid of her P-P-C-O-S and then she can have kids wishing You're in a herpes. The Then she can have kids. What's The diet? So Just listen. These doctors go to school for a long time. I personally take their opinion very serious. You should too. No, no, no. We didn't get these information from a doctor. No, no. I saw a TikTok. That's why she's going on a diet. Because I saw a TikTok. No, listen. And I said you should do this diet. Listen, I have very strong opinions about the American healthcare system.


They don't wanna tell you, they don't wanna tell you that You can fix your issues with diet because then you stop paying for the stupid medicine they prescribe you. Oh. And I've always known that if I figured out what was wrong with my diet, I would be able to fix it. And a doctor on TikTok got you. Let us know, doctor On. No, it wasn't, they're not a doctor. Oh Well a woman on TikTok. So the doctor very passionate about this. That told you how to fix it. You're just throwing that out the window. Listen, I'm gonna hitting asked this 17-year-old girl on TikTok that told you how to fix it. 'cause literally I asked the doctor when I went in there, I said, is there anything I Can do to fix this? And she said, I mean, there's medicine I Can give you to help with like your cycle and stuff.


And I was like, Hmm, that's not what I wanted to hear. I said, are there any diets I Can do? No, there's not. Okay, Well let me, lemme tell you something. Y'all wanna know something about the healthcare system? No. It's A scam. It's a scam. Is it? Yep. Yes. Because listen, I have a theory. Oh, someone tell me, how do, how do hotels make money? Mav Harper. Anyone? Kenji. Oh, hotels make money by people spending the night there. Okay. Yes. By by what? Their rooms being occupied. Yes. Some may say yes. Okay. How do you think a hospital makes money? By, maybe by their rooms. Maybe by their rooms being occupied. So what do hospitals need Called Sick people. They need occupants.


They need people, yeah. To be sick. You think doctors purposely make people sick? I don't think they make you sick. I just Think that's, no, I think BlackRock does. I don't. BlackRock does. I don't think they tell you. I don't think that doctors are allowed to tell you how to make yourself better. I don't think there's a big like evil doctors that like, no, I don't. It's like, oh, to become a doctor you might take this evil cause to dealing With this. No, I just think that the American healthcare like system Brainwashed. I think everybody's brainwashed. You're taking pills and what we need to be eating is like, you know, probably what we should be eating. Not saying I'm eating that. I'm definitely eating tea belt after this. But you know, we should be eating like, you know, eggs. Grilled Chicken. Yeah. Good food. I'm so scared of eggs. I can't eat one. The food that the Lord has provided.


But anyways, dude, guess what her diet is. First Of all, the Lord is a provider. Ken do not experienced That firsthand. Wait, what do you mean?

And you do that. Should we just have a planking competition? Yes. Okay. You guys talk we'll plank. Okay. I think he just wanted a plank El All right, So, okay, ready? Two, One.

And I feel like there's other people that may not know too. Okay, I Will break it down for you. I would assume most of you guys know what a period is, but if you don't, it goes at The end of a sentence. Yeah, they, it's, it goes at the end of the sentence. And also every month a woman gets a period and it's part of the reproductive system. It's how you get pregnant. If you don't get a period, you can't get pregnant. There you go. Anyways, so when you start your period, that's like day one of your cycle and then a couple weeks later you ovulate, which is where you're like fertile and You can get pregnant. But I don't ovulate so I can't get pregnant.


Bummer. Yeah. That's not good. Yeah. So my doctor told me that I Can take this medicine that'll pretty much make me ovulate, but I don't wanna take the medicine. I'd rather just fix it naturally because I know I Can fix it with my diet. So that's why I'm doing a new diet where I pretty much eat like high protein and high fats and like very low carbs. It's keto. That's the diet. And it sucks. But If I, if I Can fix my Hormones, he, If I Can fix my hormones, then my body will start to go back to like a normal cycle and I will start ovulating ovulating again. And I'll start getting my period naturally again.


And which means I will be fertile and I Can get pregnant. So that's why I'm doing the new diet, because I won't be able to get pregnant unless I take medicine. And I don't wanna take medicine to get pregnant. I'd rather be able to get pregnant naturally. So doing a diet would make me be able to get pregnant naturally. Hopefully. That's what I heard. So that's why I'm doing it. Mother, they're still Planking. I listen to every word Honestly. So ultimately you just wanna have a baby. Yeah, I do. I really do want A baby. So you're giving up all this food just for a child? Yes. So when my future child sees us, just know your mother loves you very much. So when your, your child tries, dad tries to complain about not having food, whatcha gonna tell 'em you was, oh no.


Harper, you would've really fit in with Kate the other day. It was when she first started, I can't do anything. And even Maverick was helping me. Yeah, I was You were lifting was holding her up. That my, my, I'm very demure and my arms are very weak. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. She's just like, I don't think anyone knows what that word really means. If you think of a demure person, it's like this Very classy put together. I thought a demure person was just like thoughtful. Yeah, No, like just like putting, putting your fingers. I don't think that's demure. I think demere's like thoughtful. Oh my shoulders. Oh my shoulders. Oh my shoulders. You're dying. Oh my God. I had like a one. Yeah, pretty much. We're trying to get pregnant.


Hey, how's that going? She's eating beef and chicken. Yeah. I mean, is that what babies are made of? Beef and chicken and eggs. Man, that's you go, if you wanna get pregnant, go on keto. Wait, Yeah, well we'll see If it works. Can I share what happened yesterday? Yeah. Yes. Okay. You would have just fit right in Harvard because we're sitting in the Panda Express parking lot and Kate starts having a breakdown about food, mental Breakdown. She's fallen apart. Main reason is because it's day one of keto her diet and it sucks. And she's like, I can't have this but I can't have this. And We all feel bad because it's a big life Changing thing. And it just kept getting worse and worse because Kate loves coffee and someone was like, oh, so you can't have coffee anymore? She's like, oh, I can't have coffee anymore. Yeah. And I was like, Kate, we have apples at home, you can have apples.


And then we looked at apples and they have like 14 grams of carbs. And I was like, oh Kate, you can't have apples. And she was like, I can't have anything. Everything is trash. And then we go through the Panda Express drive-through and the one thing on the menu that she could have, they were like, oh, we're out of that. It's gonna take 15 minutes to cook. And she was like, no, I'll just starve Fine in the drive through. In the drive, The drive through lady, I'm just starved then. So she's Losing her mind. Right? And then it's time to drive away. And she's already had a breakdown and Katie's driving and we're all just kind of sitting there like watching her break down and she almo, it's like pitch black outside. She almost runs over this curb. Okay. Not Runs over the curb. She tries to go the wrong way and the curb is this way.


She's driving the curb is this way. She's heading at the curb like this. Like I had to turn right, but I thought there was an opening to like go across the street and go start going down the different lane. But I, there wasn't. And so she's like perpendicular to oncoming traffic coming to hit us and she's like, I can't do it. I can't drive, I can't eat. You had just, somebody has to drive so we like pull over immediately. So she's begging someone else to drive. Get someone else to drive, please. And Lemme tell you the fear That just pull over please. Any of us will drive. Please. Just not you. Kate is like, her eyes are closed driving. She's like, I can't do it anymore. I was, they were like, please don't kill us. Wow. This store is really entertaining you, isn't it?


Yeah. Take your arrow. Plus, yeah, it was just like, Did you person? Yes. It was funny laugh. Is It a keto diet? So you missed the part where I almost killed my entire family in oncoming traffic.
