Everything in this house was falling apart. Dinosaur. And also two of the beds, which they did not promote at all, were literally in a shed in the backyard. Like, It was just not what we thought. That's terrible. Yeah. So I went to the hood and it was terrifying. An oak cliff.


You are a pleasant place. And Michael Amaya, when you were cutting up these shorts, because I know you're gonna do me as dirty as freaking possible, add this in there.

Hot Wheels Cars from Target. Wait, what? Hot Wheels cars from you get you for that? Yeah. And I'm done it before. What? Dude? If I went to jail, ma'am. Oh, it would be for something bad. I relocated a turtle the other day. What? And man, what are we switching Lane?


Or is this this the same thing? No, listen. Okay. We did, I relocated a turtle. Aw. I grabbed him off the street. He was About to get hit by a car. He was moving very Slow and I saved his life. But sometimes the hero looks like a villain. Oh, so that's how Yeah. Oh no. And I grabbed the turtle. No. And you thought it was a water turtle. What? And you threw it in the lake? No. Oh. I bring him over to the other side of the road. He was trying to cross and I, there was nothing over there, so I was like, I don't think you wanna go over here. I was like, Kate, let's drive down to the lake. I'll drop him off at the lake. And this thing pees on me in the car, on me in my car. Dude, did you kill it?


That turtle is not alive. Oh my God. You did. I have this shell in my bedroom. Stop. Wait, is it, is he being real? No. So you go to jail for killing a turtle that pee on you soup man, because it's banging. No. Whatcha gonna do? Peed on the floor? No. I said it back in the road and left. Oh. I don't know what happened, but there was a curb on this side and a curb on that side. And he's about this big. So I don't think he got up. Wait, I have a question. Did y'all actually steal that boat one time and ride around in it? Or was that like That was a joke. Okay. That was completely a joke Because I was like, actually I'm just kidding. The curb, the turtle didn't pee on me. Sounds like though. Oh yeah. It did pee on me though. Yeah, it did. And I was very surprised. We were driving down the road and I saw a turtle and I said, cash, you gotta save it because I absolutely in no world am touching a turtle.


Okay. That is not me. I slept on bro. I never held a turtle. I did one time when I was by myself and it took everything in me. Aw. But yeah, so he picks up the turtle and he like walked around for like five minutes finding where he should put this turtle. Like he was thinking deep about where to put him. And then he finally decided that there's not a place good enough for this turtle on this street. So he made me take him to the lake. I realized then if you're a turtle, you have a high likelihood of just death because You can can't go nowhere. How do you think the turtle got there? He was about to die. Mav. That's exactly my point. And then he's gonna die because you Put him back. There's nowhere for him to go. Like I was like, you can't get up. Take, go over there.
