That's, you don't have to, but don't that you guys don't, you don't have to that. But I have very bad sweating problems too at night. So it is horrible that I have both of these things. I Can honestly say I have not peed the bed since I was like one years old. I don Oh, shut up. Shut. Oh, shut up Josh. Genuinely, I don't think I've went to bed in at least two years. You Seem proud of that. I am at least two. Yes. Oh, you're like 24 years old. Yeah. Well, you said you do it yearly. Okay. Yeah, I do like maybe once a year if I drink a lot of water and then I'm like really tired.


But I also have a very bad sweating problem that when I'll wake up, wake up in the middle of the night. This happens like once a month. Yeah. We all know about your night sweats. Yeah. So I have to get down on the sheets after I wake up and use the bathroom. And I come back and I feel my bed soaking wet. Ew. I have to smell it. I'm like, is this gonna smell sour or is this gonna smell like nothing? And when I had to get down and smell it, it's like once a year I'm like, oh, I'm gonna have to go join Kate on her side of the bed. Oh, hold on. Oh my God. What, what does does it, how often, be honest does it smell like urine and like once a year. I told you, really? This is not real. Y'all made this up. No. Check my mattress. I have a protector on it. You know that he pieced the bed.


What? She's not supposed to marry me or something. She's crazy. Yeah. I'm open and honest about it. Yeah. It's not like she can do anything. I mean, Kate. Yeah. It's not like you're in it now. You're in it. Okay. Ready? Yeah. What's yours, Harper? So I actually have two lies in one truth to say mad. Okay. So that's crazy. So wait, you have two lies in one truth? Yes. Yes, yes. Wait, is the game two lies and a truth? Or is it two Truths and a lie? Two Truths and a lie. But I, I I switched it up. You Adjusted. She hit the, okay. Switch your adjustments. She wanted to copy me. Wanted to be like, okay. Okay. So number one, I was born with a small hole in my heart in like the top left corner. I've never number two Specific.


She stole that from a friend. She definitely has a friend with small hole In her heart. Okay. In the top left, I have never tried American cheese. Okay. I believe that. And number two, I used to pee the bed for attention. Why does everybody have the bed? You know, it's crazy. I almost put pee in the bed on mine too. Just imagine Harper standing over her bed. Like, come on, I'll do it, mom. I'm doing it right now. Wait, so yours is two lies and Truth, only the truth. Truth. Yeah. Two lies and one truth. Okay. So there's, the truth is there's a pee in the bed. There's a truth that she peed the bed for attention, never ate American cheese. And she has a hole in her heart. You don't have a hole in your heart. That's not true. How do you know she could? No she doesn't. She could.


A lot of people have that. I don't, but I feel like it would've came up. Yeah, I don't think you have that. I feel like, I feel like with the amount of hours I've spent talking to you on this couch, I I would know about that. I'm gonna say it's the American cheese thing. You feel Like she's never had American cheese? Yeah. No. I'm going with, there's a hole in the heart. Alright, what do you, what do you guys think? I think the truth Is wait, you think that's the truth? Yeah. Okay. You think that's American cheese is the truth? Yeah. I think the truth is also American cheese. Okay. What do you think Kenzie? I think the Truth is you peed on the bed for attention. All right. Which one is it? Oh my gosh. Okay. So the lie is I don't actually have a hole in my heart. And then the other lie is, wait, what is American cheese?


Like is Wait, what? What is it is America? Is it is American cheese? The cheese on pizza? No, that would be mozzarella. Yeah. Yeah. American cheese is like, what's on most part Illa. It's just like yellow cheese on burger. It's Like what? When you go to a burger place. Okay. Okay. Then the other lie is yes, I've had American cheese and then the, the truth is I used to pee on my bed for attention. Wow. Kenzie actually got it right. Dude. We both had pee once. Yeah. Did you adjust man? I'm did. I adjusted mine. That's crazy. How old were you when you stopped?


Like last year? I'm sorry, I'm not lying. Alright, Here's mine. No, I'm, I'm joking, but like, I actually like used to pee the bed so I, my mom could come upstairs and me be sorry. My mom would come stairs. No, my mom would come upstairs to me screaming and the bed being all wet. Oh. And she would, I I would have to go lay down in her bed. Alright, here's mine. That's a Strat. I mean these are all involving Maverick. So Maverick You can answer. Oh see you can't be mad for me doing that to you. Maverick told me is these are all about me. They're all Maverick told me. Okay, so which one of these Maverick tolds me? This is insane.


One is true. Two are a lie. Maverick told me. I think Maverick just parted. This Is good. I I like where you're going. I Do two Truths and a lie. Either I two lies, one's true. I no, mine are mine's two Truths and one not. Oh man, you are so right Kenzie. I even mixed up the game. It sounded like it should be that way. I know for some reason I think one should be true. Okay, well one of these are true. The other two are lies. Maverick told me not to date Kate. Okay. Maverick told me Kenzie wasn't his type. Maverick told me Harper will never find a boyfriend. Oh. Ooh. I know the truth. Oh my gosh. MA's like, which one I looking guys?


I think I said all of those. I don't think any of those. I didn't say only one is true. Yeah. Which one do you think is true? Are you sure all three aren't true? Maverick told me not today. Kinzie or Wait, well what? No, let's start Maverick. I did say that. Be good for you. Maverick told me. Not today Kate. He said Kinzie wasn't his type and he said Harper will never find a boyfriend. Which one is true? Dude, I feel like mine's kind of true because it's kind of also very true. I will never find a Boyfriend. So which one? You think yours is true? Yeah. Kate, what do you think? I also think Harper's is true just 'cause I know he didn't say don't date Kate. I know he was telling cash that he should date me.


Okay. Kenzie, what do you think? I think he Said don't date Kate. He was telling Ka to Date me. Oh wait then what's true? Wow. Kenzie. There's nobody got it right again Threw the right. That is great. What did she get right? Maverick told me not to date Kate. No way. That's when He did. When Mave explained yourself. Can I get a recall on when this was? What? When did I say this? Well how did you know it was correct? Probably, yeah. Well because it sounds like something I said what before we started dating, he told me not to date you. That's crazy. You literally were saying that the weekend before we started dating, he was saying you should date Kate. No, but at some point he told me not to date you because He probably got mad at you.


Some point in my life. I'm not saying it was like the week before. I think when we were in la I think I did tell him like many times. I said like I remember saying you should either date her or cut her off. Yeah. And then you kept telling me not to date her and to break up with her. I don't remember ever saying her or not break up with her because I wasn't with her. But you were telling me not to date? Yeah. Once I started dating, I never said no. I didn't say it was when we started dating. But you told me not to date her because you, you if it helps Kate, he thought you were too good for me. Okay. He was like, you just keep leading her on. Don't date her. Just cut her loose. Dude, that's insane dude. It was true. I remember telling him to cut you loose many, many times. I said I remember many, many times I'm hurt. I'm very hurt. That's mean It hurt. What Do you mean?


Matt was saying not to date me. You gotta understand he was treating you likes trash. I mean Well if it was for my sake, I'm very flattered that you were about This. Well it was me and the other guys in the house all agreed. We all said, yeah, you're a horrible person for what you're doing. Yeah. And I had to nod along and be like, I am but I'm gonna keep doing it. He'd, I'm gonna go call Kate. Yeah, I'm gonna do something about that. He'd leave and a couple months later we'd be like, so what's going on? That's great. Same situation. Alright, Kate, your turn. Okay, Well mine is two Truths and one lie. Oh. Oh, I'm mixing it up. I see. No, I'm playing the game the correct way. Okay. Can you switch it? What? No, you switch it.


I really like two lies. In one truth I do two. But we now we gotta find the lie. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah, you right. I cried every day for four months straight in high school. True. Everyone believes that. Yeah, That's I'm allergic to Stella and I never told you guys. Wait, Wait, wait. How do you know that That's true? I'm allergic to Stella Too. I secretly am sad to move out, but I feel like I can't tell you because I've said so much about living alone. I know which one. It's right off rip. Can I answer? What Do you think Secretly? No, I know which one. It's Which one You want me to, you want me to answer right now? She's secretly sad to move out. Is the, is a true one. And the lie is It's two Truths and one lie. So two of them Are truth. Yeah. So the lie is, wait, can you repeat the First? I think the lie is that you, I'm going last because I know the first one Is I cried every day for four months straight in high school.


Yeah. Cried every day. Allergic to Stella. Sad to move out. I think bitch, She is allergic to Stella but she's made it very clear she's allergic to dogs. So it's kind of like a false dichotomy in that sentence. So I don't think that's gonna work. I think that the lies you cried every day for four months. There's no way you have that much cheers. Like built up in yourself, You know, four months. Every day is a lot. I can't imagine you cried Every day like four months. That's like so many days guys. I think's, I think it's like a, just like, what's that called? Like a analogy or something? I think it's just like a Oh, so she's not being literal? No. Are You being Literal? What do you think? What? What do you mean what you think? We're asking you a question. Like You have to be told I was being literal Every day for four months.


Okay. That's a lie. That has to be the Lie. I mean, that throws me off. I'm with Harper. I don't know if that's physically possible. Yeah. Then that's not. But then again I did put her through a lot. So, you know, I don't think she's actually sad to move out. I think that's the lie. I think that has to be the truth. I mean, there's no way it can't be. Okay. So what's the lie, Kenzie? I, I think the lie is that she's sad to move out. Mav. I mean, we all know she's allergic to Stella. To being secretly allergic to Stella wouldn't make any sense. So I'm gonna say that's the lie. I think the the crying, It's a lie. Okay. Do you want me to tell you guys now? Yeah. Wait, what's CA's? Yeah, What Was your answer? Well, this whole time I was thinking what the truth is again. And I was like, the truth is she's allergic to Stella.


This Game messes me up. There's, I know she's allergic to Stella and I'm with you. Mav is every made the made it clear. But I think in Kate's mind, I think in Kate's mind, she hasn't made it clear. Oh well I don't know how that could have happened. So I think that's one of her Truths. And then I think the other truth is that she cried and I'm with kids. I think the lies is that you're sad to move. You're not sad to move out. Okay, let's hear it. The truth is the the wait, the lie is the crying in high school. I didn't cry every single day for four months. Knew it. I cried a lot. I got it Right. It being a lie on a technicality is like, yeah, I mean that's kind of crazy. You don't remember I had like a chart of like every day I cried 'cause I was trying not to cry every day. You don't remember that? That so sad.


Yeah, I absurd was sad. I did, I had Like, I don dunno if that's pick me or sad or what that is, but No, I'm being serious. I was like, sorry for That. I gotta the point, dude, it's a good thing I adopted honey for you. They'd have been like, no, we sleep her record, she cried. Okay. Also y'all knew I was allergic to Stella. Was it in the notes? See I told you. Yeah. No, no. Okay. Not like, oh, a chew. Every once in a while lately I like, I thought I was going crazy, but then I just realized if she like brushes up against my bare skin, I like break out in hives. So I Purposely, I told you I cut her with the top of my hand. I knew she thought she was being like secretive. Like, oh, no one knows I'm allergic. But then all also, she walks into the house and she's like, I'm you're allergic to the stuff.


I've never said it out Loud. Then how did he know? I think 'cause I did the, it must Be something that she's touching in the backyard. Could be, because a lot of people have told me that they're Allergic. I get it too. I get it really bad from stuff. Yeah. No. Yeah. I don So, but also 'cause my parents' dog is like short haired, like Stella and I'm allergic to that one too. If she like touches me hair, like break down. It must be them short hair Dogs. Yeah. You must not like them short hairs. Yeah. I don't know how honey doesn't make, she might make me a little sneezy though. She's not even very short hair. She Kinda long hair. She kinda lost.

I think we milked it for all. Okay. Alright. We're done with all that. Anyways, I was milking this goat and it had its rope like harnessed onto its face. This was so, and the rope went behind my kneecap right Here. That's a long story. So this is the truth. Okay. Okay. But anyways, anyways, The go got mad at me and took off and the rope like slashed behind my knees. Oh yeah. And like gave me rope burn and I got so mad. I like yanked that thing and it passed out. Okay. So there's the truth. There's the truth. That's the truth. Okay. But there is some passing on goats. Is that necessary? Okay. And the next one Is the tornado is coming. I mean, the goat was probably not happy with what you were doing down there.


The tornado is coming. I Can break into any front door using only a credit card. As long as it doesn't have a deadbolt, I Can do that too. Doesn't like every front door has a deadbolt. No. Nope.

Right now everybody knows I Can get into our house. No, No, no. You can't get into a deadbolt. Oh, you'd have to like, Oh my God, You so far behind. Okay. And then the other one is, oh man, my family and I, there's six people in my family.


We lived in an RV for a whole year and then we lived in a hotel room, just one hotel room for six months. Okay. That one's a lie. No, I think that's the truth. No, But, but, but there's two Truths in one lie. So that one's A lie. I know what the answer Is. That's a no. That's a truth. And the other truth is, Ma, You can go last. The other truth is the Goat. No. No. Okay, Kate, just say what the lie is. What Was the middle one? The credit card. That's the Lie. I'm gonna say the lie is the goat. I'm gonna say the lie is the last one. The RV thing. The RV and hotel. Mav. What do you think the lie is? The goat? Yep. That's what I think. Okay. It was too specific.


She tried to sell it too much. Unless she's trying to get off on a technicality. Like we were in the hotel room for actually five months. So let's hear it. All Right. What was it? The goat was partially a lie. I didn't make it passed out, but I did get in a fight with a goat 'cause it slashed my legs with the rope. So is that the lie? Yeah. So that's the lie. Oh, Okay. Yeah. See I knew she made it way too detailed. Yeah, Yeah. Tried to sell. That was a Real story. Well, all the details were real until the end when I made it pass out. That part wasn't real. So you still told like half the truth, half The truth. So it was two and a half Truths and a half lie. People don't understand the game. Kate was like, I mean I cried 28 days out of the 29, but it wasn't every day. So I cried during W That's my lie.


I'm sorry, But hey, I made you laugh 'cause you talked about utters for five. I mean, I've never played disc golf in my life and I, I got YouTube. Believe it. That was my life. Congratulations. You're a better Liar. I immediately knew that. That's not a good quality to have. Did you know that You immediately knew that a lie? Actually, I'm Not even gonna lie. Yeah, because I've seen you throw the Frisbee for Stella. It took you forever to get good at. And Sorry, you go. No, continue. About Costa Rica. Well, Yeah. In Costa Rica we were milking cows and there's a guy named Chandler. I'm sorry. Sorry. No, what? That's what you do on vacation. Yes. We are milking cows in Costa Rica. Can't wait to go on vacation. Oh my goodness. Milk some cows, bro. Kenzie would love vacation with you. I didn't know. I'd Love this excursion. I I didn't know goat at s Yeah. Is that really true? Yeah.


How do you think they get goat milk? Have y'all ever drank goat milk? No. I have goat cheese in the fridge downstairs. Once, once I make goat cheese. You gotta shake a lot. No you didn't. Yeah we did. At Pioneer camp. Yes, at pioneer camp. Pioneer Camp for y'all's like band camp. We're like this one time at Pioneer Camp. Yeah. Pioneer camp was, Dude, I love pioneer camp. I was whole Yeah. Pioneer camp. You. We made goat cheese. We made butter. Goat butter. That's probably what it was was butter. Yeah, it was goat butter. And I don't know if it was goat, but I remember making butter. And lemme tell you, that stuff took a while to churn. Yeah. I felt bad for them ladies back in the 16 hundreds. Just dude, remember charm butter. That was horrible. There Had to be a more practical way.


No. And then what's it called? So we were milking the cows and this, The laughing at that with horror was crazy. I'm lost. Wait, why are y'all laughing so hard? Nothing. They're laughing for a reason that they shouldn't be laughing at. That's messed up. Okay. Okay. Well we were milking the cows and this guy named Chandler was pulling the udders off. Stop it. The cow. I'm trying to listen to the udder story please. I'm sorry. He was, he was pulling the udders like off the cow. He, he was like, and the, yeah, okay. The S over car came off. Well actually pulling off and the cow cap like kicking. Dude, I feel like milking a cow is so cruel. Like it's not, I know, I'm pretty sure like it feels good for the cow or something. I don't really know but like, but like what?


I don't think it feels good. No, I think it does. I think if you don't milk 'em, I think they get like hurt. No, They get, They get clogged ERs. See they get clogged outers. I told you their otters get clogged. Especially, especially if they're lactose intolerance. Wait, does it come out like positive? It's clogged. I don know. I don. I don't know. But I do know that if you don't milk 'em, I'm pretty sure it's a bad thing. But yanking on their ERs just like that just seems bad. Like what do y Allall know so much about cows and their Ts. So imagine the first dude trying to milk a cow and he scratch things like I think we could drink that. I mean the baby. Yeah. Imagine the first year that was like, watch this. It like they were like whoa. And then he was like, I think we can drink it. No, no. There there was like a actual technique to doing it and so you had to like put your fingers down and keep on going and squeeze up.


It was so gross. It Was so gross. No more talking about that. Okay. I've never done that actually. It's Like you're playing the piano and like squeezing the ter at the same time. Okay, well I've never milked it cow. I can't but you, you Should try sometimes. Oh Yeah, maybe. Maybe I Should. And is there udder like when the milk bores in, it gets hard. What? Okay, anyways, We gotta Stop. I don't wanna talk about milking cows anymore. We gotta stop. I'm done talking about milking cows. I'm sorry. I'm done talking about that. Let's talk about milking goats. Kenzie, please enlighten us. Is it just the same as milking cows? Yeah. Did You ever eat the goat? Whoa. No. You never sacrificed it for the better. Good.


But no. Did you ever as a child have to kill your food and then eat it? Yes. That night. Same day? Yes. Oh my gosh. Same day is crazy. What do you mean? We did that the same day. I don't remember killing anything and eating it the same day. Just, I mean remember once we, we we killed a rattlesnake and put it on the fire and ate it. Yeah but she was, that was like same hour. I, hers was more like pick out your dinner. Growing up In the suburbs is Just completely different. Yeah. Like Yeah you got Kroger. Well my family didn't do that. My best friend growing up lived on a farm. So when I'd go over to her house, her stepdad would be like, alright, go pick out whichever chicken you want.

I still can't believe Kenzie squirted eggs out of a, Oh, lemme tell you what happened. So there was this a snake, this chicken snake in the Guinea chicken Snake. Wait, chicken snake. Sorry, what? What's a chicken? Is it a snake or is it a chicken? It's like a rat snake but a chicken. Now they call them chicken Snakes because they get in the chicken pins. Oh, so a snake that likes to eat chickens? Yes. Yeah, it's a rat snake is what? It's okay. Okay, but why did you squeeze the eggs out of it? 'cause I was messed up little kids. Oh my God. Yeah. This, this, this snake was in the Guinea pen.


And so How old were you? Probably like 12. And you're like, snake come, come here. So me and my friend went, I got a snake. Chicken. Chicken, get the yard joking. But we really did, We, we took the hoe and we cut the head off of the snake and then we, we like it. Ugh. I Can, I Don know why head so easy. Just be like, I got it. I got it. And Then we squeezed his body and there were live little guineas in there. Guinea guine no's guine type of chicken. It gu, it's a bird. It's a type of chicken.


A bird. It's not really a chicken but it's kind of, it's a bird. A chicken on. You squeeze the chicken or the snake. Yeah. I'm confused too. No, the Guinea were inside. What is a Guinea? How did Aine Guinea come into play? Listen, Guinea looks like a chicken, so, oh wait, but why isn't chicken looking like A snake? 'cause the snake ate the Guinea eggs. Okay, that makes more sense.

You were 12. That's all right. Anytime I saw a snake in the woods when we were kids, I'd kill it immediately. I do not like snakes. They all the rattlesnakes. He says that. But sometimes he'd take off and running. He wouldn't even be the most of that snake. No. Listen, if it was a rat snake, I wouldn't really care. But the snakes that are poisonous, you don't need to be in my woods.


That's not a risk I'm willing to take. You don't even be in my woods. I'll kill you because I'm not trying to die by you. We almost died once by snakes. Remember one time we were in a, we were in a snake pit one time we went to our friend's house I got, and we went down in his creek and I'm not even kidding, we were like, frick.
