I said, and you said Five more Than you did you see all the Gerald's. And I let it speak for itself. And that's not my fault. That internally you thought, oh, cash is the favor. No, I thought internally that you thought that that was remotely a possibility. Math remotely a possibility. Do you, you know what remotely a possibility is. This is a tiring conversation. This conversation could potentially not kill this guys. If you haven't noticed. Cash does that every time. He doesn't know what to say. He repeats what you say a to buy time. And this is a possibility.


What? Of what Man, I don't really know what his a possibility. Like see, like I said, he was buying time and he's still couldn't come up with anything. What do you mean? What am I buying time for? See, you just said again he, to try to do it. Whatever. I say, what am I buying time for? Nothing's happened. Whatever you say, he'll say the exact same thing back to you and then answer the question. No, I'm okay. No, I'm asking what am I buying time for? What? On a podcast. You buying time for your brain to your little brain to just try to work out as to why am I catching strange right now? I haven't done anything.

Do you think Chase sees, thinks what? Do you think he saw anything?


Or do you think there was an alien there? Because I think, I believe it was an alien because I believe there was something there. Yes. I don't know if I believe that there was an alien there. Remember last time Cash questioned someone if they saw things I got yelled at if They saw things. I remember that. No, No. Harper was like, sometimes I see things and I said, what Do you see names? I said, what things do you see? And Kate yelled at me and she's like, stop asking what she sees. What Does see you? Because you sound like a witch. No, because Cash Harper was genuinely like opening up about our OCD and it was like a really sad episode. And Cash was trying to make jokes. And he, he'll swear to this day. But Maverick, you know when he is got that tone in his voice and a slight curvature to his mouth, he's like, curvature.


Yeah. You just like smile. No, it's just like, it's a smile. Well, can't be happy. I thought it was a B, C. No, no. I'm sorry. When somebody's opening up about their ooc D and They Say, I see things, I think an appropriate question is, well what do you see? But you Were laughing, you were Fu numbers. Huh? You're gonna wanna know that? No, you were, You were like making fun. Not making fun of it, but you were like trying to make a joke in the moment. And it, it was just not a good time for a joke. And I was telling you kept in and You know what? I still never got the answer to That question. And on top of That, so Harper, what do you see? See There? That was it. You can see the carbon. What do, And he had this tone in the laugh in his mouth and he kept in erupting her tooth.

I'm Not gonna do anything. I was just gonna see if I could like, you know. Do You do it yourself? Yeah. Let's see. No, I got a backup. TikTok. For some reason, only five people can comment and my comments aren't restricted or anything. Oh my Gosh. Same. Well listen, you Still, you have more people following you on your backup account than I do on my row one. So. Well You're gonna, ma, you're probably destroying the mic. You're probably, Yeah. Did anybody see that? I mean, It did. Nobody Heard what I said because you Were not really, but no Kinzie.


You're gonna pass me on that account. 'cause it's literally just like my backup is literally just like lip syncing and doing nothing. If I don't pass you on your backup account, I will cry. You will. But that's the thing. That would be, so Embarra, you were at 500. I'm at 800 on my backup. But how long have you had your backup? Oh, I've had it since I was like in high school. Since musically. Oh really? Yeah. That's my, and I got, okay. I feel a little better. I started getting followers on it like this year. Okay. Because I started Pressing on it. Guys, when Taylor, what's her real name? I think her real name is Charity. Charity, Yeah. Oh, that's pretty, okay. Well, when charity started singing Sabrina, I was, I'm quite a Sabrina Dirt. Oh. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. I'm quite a Sabrina. What? I'm quite a Sabrina fan. Yeah.


Okay. Yeah. Is that it, bro? Was that all? Yo, I feel like I should sit in Cash's chair just like somebody needs to No. Nope. I don't think you should. Yeah, I will. Okay. Yes, she always wanted to be the main like middle center of attention. Listen, like the blue couch is a vibe, but the wheelbarrow, like this is like the center. This is, I wanna, Matt, how do you feel about your brother? Like getting the center spot on the pond? I don't know how he managed that, but he did. And I'm very jealous because this is literally the center stage. Like everyone's looking at me right now. This Is great. Yeah. I'm like lowkey wheel. You Can't even like put yourself together. Your arms are like failing. It's just how you sit when you're here. You know? Cash does this all the time. You just like the little Donald Trump cash Is Crying on it.


Yeah. Is like crying. Well, ma, now that you've ruined the podcast by sitting in the middle and you're not the main character. Listen, I personally believe we should take a vote and maybe I should be in this chair from now. No, No, no, no. Voters have said no I don't. I think cash should Do, we should do an episode Where we all switch seats. Cash and Harper on the blue couch would be a vibe. Tell me not What Are you doing back here? What are you doing? I my ze bruh. Where'd you put, where'd you put our Taylor Swift? Where Is Taylor Swift? You're wearing my t-shirt. Oh, that's not my t-shirt. Where's our Taylor Swift? Huh? Where our Taylor Swift? Where guest? Where Were you? Yeah, where'd the guest go? I just want you to know Cash. You are feeding into Maverick's delusions of him being like center stage, by the way. And you're also eating on my microphone. Where Is Taylor Swift?


Oh, we were Taylor Swim. Where is Taylor Swift? Where is Taylor Swift? Who knows? She wasn't here today. Okay. Where is Charity? Yeah, we're charity. Yeah. I don't know. What do you mean? Did you kick her out? I mean, she was only here for a few minutes, by the way. We did have to pay her for that. So even though she didn't do the full 10 minutes or whatever, or 15 minutes, we're probably still gonna owe her like, like, oh, trust me. She came on the pod. You don't gotta pay no one. Nothing. Are you serious? What are you Talking about? What do you mean? Just taking care of What? Okay. What do you mean? Please, please, please Don't.
