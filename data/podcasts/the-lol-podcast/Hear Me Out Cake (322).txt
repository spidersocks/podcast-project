I think you that'd be fun. Just pick the boys to together. Yeah. So, so we go to, we're in LA and we book an Airbnb for like the time we're supposed to be there. And then we decided to extend our trip. So we had to find a new Airbnb. Airbnb, yeah. So the next morning we're like trying to find Airbnbs and Cash found one that he really wanted to book because it had a hot tub. And so I request to book it and the lady messages me and she says, Heather, Heather. Oh, that's name dropping. That's crazy. Right Name dropping him. They'll find Heather. Yo, what would Jesus do?


Said I said Jesus. I think Jesus would have a conversation with Heather. No, Actually Jesus wrote a book and he name dropped every person in the No. I said, Hey. He was like, and then this guy betrayed this guy. I said, Hey, we're he Killed him five times. Oh my God. Five times we're in town for work, blah, blah, blah. I would love to come say, she said, I see you're a new user without reviews, we screen all our guests. Can you gimme the following information, names and ages. Does anyone smoke or vape? Can you read through the house rules? And I put all of our names and all of our ages and if anybody smokes or vapes. And I said, nobody smokes or vapes. And we agree to the house rules. And then she said, I'm sorry, we have a minimum age requirement. LA has lots of great listings.


The youngest person in there was Kate, who's 20 and I'm 20. We had ages from 20 to 30. And I said, I told her we were here on work. And I said, and then I'm like, okay, fine. Whatever. I was ready to find a new place. Like I didn't care. Did you Give her but not me. Did you give her Her our last Names Josh was not ready to quit. So I do a little bit of research and go to the Airbnb rules. You said you're, she might have looked up our names. No, no, no. She, I don't think she did. Well just she did look up our names. No, Later. Yes, I know. So after I did my research. Yeah. So think that couch should stop talking for a second. That couch is kind of chaotic. I'll take over. Wait, K has the Receipts. I have the messages. Yeah. But I did some research Let K talk. Yeah, but you got number research. I did research. Thank you. Okay. I did some research and I found out. Stop typing your fingers, please.


No, I can't because I did some research. Oh my God. And listen, I found out that on Airbnb you are not allowed to discriminate against anyone or anything. Yeah. So age discrimination is illegal. And that was age discrimination. And she Just discriminated against that girl in jail against my age. So I was gonna type her a nice little message back. I'm sorry. That said, unfortunately that is age discrimination, which is illegal on Airbnb. So if you don't let me stay at your house, I will report you to the authorities. But Now, now that's just like arguing with a lady and we don't wanna stay at her place anyways. I was discriminated against. Of course You're not discriminated against anything. Okay. People Like you are why things don't happen. When you see things happening, you gotta take action.


I just, I don't care. Action. I Can care to stay at Heather's house. You Can't let people bully you and run over. You. Wait. You're not even the best part. Okay, listen. So then cash is getting, cash is all irritated because this lady just discriminated against my age and he wants to send me Were y'all that mad? No cash. Cash Because it was the only Airbnb we found with a hot tub. Needed that hot tub. He wanted to stay there really bad. So then he starts typing. And this is on my Airbnb account, so it's like my name, my face. And I'm like highly embarrassed because you know when cash types, it's never grammatically correct. So he says, he just goes, is there any way we can stay pleased? We're on a work trip for our company. We won't even be at the place that much. We don't have anywhere else to go today. Now he is begging Heather to stay at her house. You weren't begging Heather.


Oh, begging. I was begging. And then if she didn't accept my begging, I was going to threat. And the threat was the follow up. Then she says, what company? What kind of work do you do? This is where it gets Messy. I was giving her a second chance. This Is where it gets messy. Oh no. I said, we are the owners of our own company, blah, blah, blah. We film YouTube videos and if you look up Cash and Maverick on YouTube, you will find us. We are here to meet with other creators and tour their houses. We have been here for a few days and needed to extend our trip to filming video. We're two married couples and an employee here strictly on business. She ignores my message. We're just sitting in a diner at this point, have nowhere to go. Like I'm waiting answer. Yeah, I would, I would, I would like, and then she says, Hey, I'd love to know. Yeah, We're about to pull up on Heather. Yeah. I said, I see why homeless people yell at people, people. I wanted to yell at someone And I was like, Hey, I'd love to know as soon as possible.


By the way, I was looking for other Airbnbs. I was not staying here even after all that. But cash was like determined to stay here. 'cause had a Did y stay there. We'll just wait. We'll just Wait. She goes, I I literally said cash. I don't know if it's a good idea that we tell her what our YouTube channel is because she's gonna look at our YouTube channel and see the giant hole in our wall. Such a fumble you. And then she did, she applied back. Hey, I looked up y'all's channel and there's appears to be a giant hole in the wall where you're filming the Size of a body. Wait, wait, read the exact message. She says, I checked out your channel. I'm sure this is just a weird coincidence, but there's a huge hole in the drywall behind you for that video. It looks like the size of a body That after the video, We don't matter The size body. A secret roof. Okay.


She Said, we don't allow any filming at the house. And the minimum age is an issue. I'm sorry. It's not a good match. Okay. Freak you. Oh, see, I still wanna message each other back. Right now. I Can see you getting angry right now. Be the minimum. Age is not an issue except for the person that is discriminating. Yo, If you hand me the phone, I will do Damage. It's Thank I don.

And cash looks over and says, stop being Brad and send the message. And I said, I don't know what else he said. Okay. That was a way louder volume than I said it out. I said it like this. No, I said it Calm and assertiveness. I said, I said, I said, I was like, send the message. And me and Kate kept going back and Kate was like, I don't want to, she didn't. And I was like, just, just send the message. She's like, no, no, no. And I was like, just stop. Did I say brat? Yeah. Yeah, we did. That Was rude. Yeah, that was rude. I don't think Said it was really Rude. I went not I would divorce him right After that. Yeah. So apparently I said, just stop being, I said it like this. Just stop being brat and just send the message. That's how he said it. Okay. Yeah. That's why. And then, and instantly I knew I was dumb for just right there and there. I was like, you wanna Throw in the other word you used? No, we don't wanna use that word. No.


What was it? No, you don't even know. Was it a bad word? Now you're talking things that little girl. What Now we gotta almost like say the word because now they're gonna think I said a real bad word. Say it. It wasn't that bad of a word. It's just like a word that's like, not polite, but it's not a bad word. It's not actually crude. What Kate suffered slings and arrows about wrongness. That's what happened. Okay. And everybody. And so Kate not only suffered from cash, but she suffered from Heather and it was just a bad day for Kate. And, and, and Heather was the one getting to me. And then I, I let my anger out on Kate because she wouldn't let me let it out on Heather. Wait, Kate, tell them tell them your New idea, your book. Oh, yeah. So anyways, wait, your Book where in a Middle Harper was about to ask Wait, this is relevant.


This is like with the story. Story. Oh, okay. So Cash is all irritated that I'm not letting him message Heather. And then we finally book a new Airbnb and we move on. Okay. We go shopping and cash, Like we'll never move on Cash sneaks. And I hope Heather doesn't see this. Heather, I'm sure you're a nice, no, I hope Heather Does see this. You you rock us. We have him betray. I actually, I actually was not mad at all. I was more irritated that cash was so mad over her. She's Now watching this Kate, And as soon as I said the thing to Kate, I knew I was dumb for her because Kate was eating like her steak and eggs or whatever. And then I said it and she goes and Seth down her silverware and was just like, I was sick to my stomach in The diner. I was like, oh, I amm so close. What did he say?


I'll tell you, it wasn't bad. It was just like, it was a rude thing to like, I You Shouldn't say it was not also Heather That is not the size of A body. Yeah, I don know what Where you Yeah. Cash tried to fit her. It many times doesn't work. I don't know why you're shocked she put her silverware down. I mean, when you call her fat, I didn't call her fat one though. I'm kidding. Kidding. So we go to the grocery store and cash like sneaks in, buys Me Flowers to apologize and takes him out to our car. Whoa. Whoa. What? You're spitting wraps so fast. I can't keep track. Oh. So after we booked our new Airbnb, we were going to target to get a few things. Cash went in and he bought like a, a bouquet of flowers for me. And he fell bad because he was, he fell real bad actually. Apology flowers. Oh my God. God. You wanna see a picture of my apology flowers? He like put them. It was so funny.


I'm sorry. I was like here. That, that's crazy. Dude. It was so funny. Me and Kasha paper walk in and we're walking by the flowers and we're like, where all three of us are looking at, no ones sang anyway. All three of us are looking at the flowers. We're just kinda like, nah. Yeah, yeah. We like brick. Yeah, Bryce, you get those. That's amazing. You said Brick. No. Yeah. So anyways, he gives me these flowers, but then I can't bring a whole bouquet of flowers home because, you know, I have to take it through the airport. So I put one single flower in a water bottle and I carried it all the way from LA to Dallas. That was not one single flower. You put like 12 in there. There was like 20 in There. Yeah. Well, it was one single stem, but there just happened to be lots of flowers. And then she's walking through the airplane aisle and everyone's looking at her and like everyone's trying to hurry along.


And Kate is like carrying her flower. Like you guys the airplane. Do you guys notice Despicable Me where she's holding the Cheeto and she thinks it's a butterfly? Yeah, that's what Kate looked like with her bottle walking through. She's like, everybody's like, hurry along. She's like, she like put it in the little TSA bag check thing that goes through the scanner. Her flowers just, I lost a few petals along the way, but the majority of the flowers, do you still have it? I'm getting to that. The majority of the flowers made it home. And then when I got home, I put them in like a book to press 'em and I decided that I'm starting a flower journal. So I'm gonna put all the petals in a flower journal and like write little stories. Is it a Flower journal or an apology journal? Yes. No, it's, it's all the above. So I'm gonna put my flowers in there and I'm gonna glue them in.


And then I'm gonna write a little story about how cash yelled at me in Norm's diner in LA one time. So he bought me these flowers to apologize. And then one day our kids are gonna look at that. She's gonna have a whole book of how cash is wrong during bought flowers. Yeah. What that, that's like Cute though. But like Yeah, but like, Also I Can yell. I didn't yell. I like toxic. Yeah, it's like completely toxic. Yeah. I was not, yo I literal said, can you just send the message and stop being a Brett? I mean, you're killing things said so else. You're putting them in a book and to like steal the like wrongness that. No, to be fair, it's like sacrifice book to be fair in the, it's like that's the definition of someone apologizing and be like, Hey, hey, say that again. I need to get this on camera in the almost five. I'm making an album Five years in The almost five years Kash and I have been together. That is the first bouquet of flowers he has bought because he did something wrong.


So that should tell you something. In five years, I've only had to apologize once. I'm pretty flawless. No, you've apologized before, but you just like didn't get Flowers. Well, do y'all wanna know the story? Yeah. Oh, you have a story too? Yeah. Well I was in Costa Rica just having a grand old time. You know, I look at my cameras or actually, no, no, no. Cameras.

But know those moments when something happens and you look at nothing, you're like, No. Okay, Well anyways, yeah, I mean, I I do know that. But like, anyways, so I was in Costa Rica, I checked my phone and I see my best friend's little brother texted me, Hey, blah, blah, blah, said that she's gonna TP you my ex-best friend.


Yeah. Oh, I saw that. Who very wronged me. And the nicest, Hey, stop it. You're gonna have to buy flowers. Next thing you know, it's no good. Okay. So, so I'm like, oh, okay, great. So I look at my camera. We only have a doorbell camera, so I always see Oh, you're talking about your ring doorbell? My ring doorbell camera. So I see, I see a little flap of toil paper and I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? She really did. But my mom was like, that's not toilet paper.
