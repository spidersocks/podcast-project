I'm taking the inertia of this podcast and we're silencing it. Inertia. What is having To walk?


What Dude, no one even knows what you're Saying. The eyes are broke. I'm stopping the momentum where this conversation Inertia. I understood Matt. It's just funny 'cause I knew he was even like, what's inertia? No, seriously. Definition inertia, energy. Yes, I know. Nobody else give a us an iner. I want the guy that he used it to tell me inertia. I don Inertia is the energy that an object has in motion. Let's fact check him. What? What was the word? Inertia. Inertia. Inertia. Inertia. Inertia. Wait, wait. Alex, he can spell it. He's real smart. Inertia. Inertia. I-N-E-I-T-E-R-I-A think I-N-E-R-T-I-A in a minute. Harper.

Just, Nope. Oh, Oh, oh. She, she ate the glass. The Ate the glass. Crazy one. That's another bottle. Will you just, alright. Matt, what do you think inertia is? That's, That's Okay. Yeah. Smart guy. What does inertia mean? Inertia is the energy. An object has in motion the tendency of an object to resist changes to their state of motion. Yep. He's close enough. It's a fundamental principle. It's a fundamental principle of physics and is described in Newton's law of motion. Newton's Law of motion is that an object motion will stay in Motion. Motion. Unless something starts it.


Stop. Dude, I see that all the time on TikTok. Teachers think they like coming up with something new. Can you gimme a bottle of water? Yeah. Thank you so much. Teachers thinking that they my come come up with something new. That's really Newton's law. You're my maid too. Can you gimme a bottle of water every time you hit that button? What? Really? When I hit this button? Yes. It doesn't like it. It does not. I sitting like it's a high frequency. Am I sitting like radio frequencies in the air right now? Ready? Radioactive. No. Will you touch it? Like when it's not working? I mean they just touch it. But as I said, nothing bad should happen. Right? I don know. Touch it. No, it will shock you. Even though it's dead. It'll shock you. No touch it. Because right now it doesn't have enough power to jump through the air.


But if there's an object there, like your finger, it has enough power here. Dude, this guy literally think Newton. Do it. Okay. Put it on your leg. Cash. Put it on your leg. Yeah. On your leg. Lemme see it. Apparently I'm just stupid. So go ahead and put it on your leg. Let me see it. It takes more energy for it to jump across the air, but if it has a physical connection, it can jump through it. Go ahead. Okay. Calling me dumb. This whole podcast. Why are you guys beefing so hard today? Here we go. Do we need To talk about it? So we gotta keep on It's willing to me. Dumb. So focused. I'm scared. Yo.

I Still have ant Ever happened and I'm gonna explain what happened. 'cause this was a one-way fight.


Wait, there was a fight. A one way street and missed. I feel like an outside source should explain this. Alex, Get over here. So wait Alex, explain it and then Alex will explain It. No, you can't explain it. You're too biased. You're your wife. Alex can't, You're married to him. I feel like Alex is also gonna be Biased. Alex, how is Alex biased? Alex? Alex isn't biased. He's not committed. Alex didn't hear half of it. Oh, I heard the important stuff. It's fine. Okay, let's, let's do Alex, explain. Alex, I bet you Maverick can't keep his mouth shut for two whole seconds Explaining Maverick, you keep your mouth shut. The only people allowed to talk are Alex And Kenzie. What? No, not Kenzie. Yeah, Because I feel like he's gonna stuff out. Why don't we call like someone that was there the whole time then like Alex was there.


I was the only one there the Whole time. Oh actually Kenzie. No, but you weren't there. Unfortunately A wife. A wife is just too biased. I were, I'd be too biased towards Ka. So we were at the pickleball courts. I just want you to know Maverick was mad before because me and Michael were beating them in a two V two. Oh, okay. So he was already beating. We were Matt, I told you in two seconds we were beating Michael and Alex Maverick. It is not your turn to talk. Alex. I it's Alex is Mike. Who made you dictator?

Nobody wants to hear your side. We just wanna hear Alex. See Marick was already mad because me and Michael had a crazy comeback. Poor cooking him against Come, but they were also cheating.


It's okay. He was mad because he kept talking. I kept serving it at while he was talking because he didn't show up. Angle your mic that way he doesn't echo. Yeah, this is true. Or let Alex use it. Yeah. And anyway, we won. So he was mad. And then he decides to leave like an hour and a half, like 30 minutes before he really needed to. No, Not true. That's not true. It was kind of true. Mad. It's your turn to He was not talk. That's just lies. Matt, I'll not in my name be sworn down in the dirt. Like this is not what I feel like I should talk. Oh, This is why I smash the TV all the time, bro. Because just makes me so angry. I wanna smack. It's not, I have things I'm disagreeing with right now too, but it's not our turn to talk.


We're letting him tell the story talk. So let him talk. It's pointless when he is just saying stuff that didn't happen. Dude, Maverick. That not happened. Ma No. Maverick would be horrible in court. Well it's because at the time, person, everyone to court. Listen, I wasn't here. Can I be Judge Kate or no? He was 15 minutes late and then we couldn't get through. What I would like to hear from the witness, He wasn't a real witness. No, the only, and guess what? If you talk court inside, Hey, if you talk in court, they kick you out A 500. Fine. You'll owe Judge Me 500. I'll be the judge then. No. What? No, you are these suspects. Suspect is not also Judge, dude, let out this suspect up here is acting like the judge and Suspect is keeping his mouth shut right now.


I I'm saying I'll be talking. Hey, be quiet. Suspect. Hey, suspect casual. And stop coughing on Me. Yeah. Mr. COVID. 19 over there. That's the call I would like to hear. That's What I would like to hear from the witness. Alright, so here's what happened anyway, after we beat them, he was a little angry. So they left. That's not why we left. Talk on your head this time. I'm not gonna let lie happen. Wait, lemme, they Left, but they were angry when they left. Whether that's why they left. I don't know. But they were angry when they left. Losing Ka Decides to stay with us and he's gonna come back by three 10. Maverick said three 10 and we all knew Ka was gonna be there by three 10.


Let's go. You knew that. Wait, I'm so lost. I, They had to leave this house at three 10 and Cash decides to stay with us. And Maverick said, I'm leaving you at three 10. Okay. If you're not back. So we're driving back. We're Gonna be Oh, from Pickleball. Yeah. We're supposed to be the, we're the map says three 19, we're gonna be at the house. So me and Cash, it's crazy 'cause we were about five minutes from the house and we looked at each other and we're like, Maverick's definitely leaving you like he's gone right now. Yeah. And then we pull up to the stop sign and we see their car turn the corner. I waited eight minutes. That's Waiting. After eight minutes, I said, all right, I'm leaving Maverick. And then we pull up to the house and then Cassius gets in the car and that's where my, my story ends unfortunately. That's right. Story ends. Okay.


All right. I guess, I mean unfortunately this story is like butchered and stuff 'cause Mav kept interrupting. So I feel like everyone's confused now. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna, as Judge Kate, I'm gonna tell you what I, what I suspect happened based off of the witness. They were at Pickleball, Maverick And Kenzie are playing. Michael and Alex. Michael and Alex are beating Mav And Kenzie. But Maverick And Kenzie are upset because they feel that Michael and Alex are cheating. They feel that the game is not being played fair. Therefore Maverick gets slightly upset. So he decides I'm not going to play with people that are cheating. Were they cheating? That's the big question. No, Maverick said many times. I said, I don't even know if, if I'll have time for another game.


Okay. Before we played the game, I said we have to leave at this time. See that we played the game and finished it and left late still. He, he said, he said very hurtful words to me that I cannot repeat. It was very offensive, honestly. Okay. Alright. So the final, And then after that, he walks over to me taking his anger out on his brother because his brother out, his brother is the one person mad, can take his anger out. I said, Hey, fair walks over to me. He says, Hey, we're leaving. We're leaving. He walked over. That's not true. Liar. Liar. Literally everyone gets literally Happened.


Turn. That's literally his lawyer. It's my word. I walk over to Cash and I say, Hey, we're already a couple minutes late. We need to head out 'cause we have to stop by CVS. And he is like, well, I'm gonna, I I really wanna play to the game. I'm almost late. Let me let play one more game. I said, we don't have time. Hey, Can I talk? And I said, he's like, okay, I'll just ride back with Chase. I go, these stories, shut up. These stories are everywhere. No one knows what's happening, happening for the Entire thing. Please. Okay. Okay. Ken, I'm biased. I think Mavic was stupid in parts Two. Okay. If you're being, if you'll I I I think I'll be able to tell if you're being biased. I wouldn't Judge biased. Okay. I will tell you if she's being biased, I judge Kate, I make the rules Before we go play pickleball. Maverick says to me, I don't know if cash heard, so that might be irrelevant.


But he says to me, we need to leave by this time so we can leave the house by three 10. And I said, okay. So we go out there playing our pickleball, doing the thing. You know? Yes. Maverick gets a little upset that he loses. That is like absolutely irrelevant to the story. I think Alex just wanted to say that out loud, but No, that's where it started. He was angry at cash after. Okay. I'll say due to previous experiences, I could see Maverick being irritated that he lost. I beat him so bad. One day was so irritated. He wanted to keep playing. I beat Marick to win. I beat, he walked over and sped my face. It's My talk guys. It's My child. Talk Cash. You sped on me. You don't win. You cheated. You sped on me first. Can we actually, I mean, so serious.


I I actually, I should not have asked you guys because I think you guys are genuinely just arguing and it doesn't make any sense. You just need to let somebody talk and tell the story. He Did. He Me first. I'll go, he's back to Kenzie. My shoes. Kenzie turn. I have a stick. Yes, thank you. Where was I? Mav told you to leave. Oh you guys, Mav lost. Mav was slightly irritated. He could have been Slightly irritated. Hey, Matt didn't try not to touch y'alls mics. He was probably gonna go up to cash and be a little bit rude regardless of if he lost or won. But because he was irritated, he could have been just a tad bit more rude to cash. Could have been, he was gonna be rude regardless, but he could have been a tad bit more. So he goes up to cash and says to cash about five or six times we have to leave at three 10.


Why don't you just come in the car with us? And Cash's like, Mav, calm down. It's fine. Like, I'm gonna be there, don't you worry, I'm gonna be there. And so after the fifth time Mav gets in the car and we head on home in Cash's advantage, there were no seats in the car. He would've had to sit on his mom's lap. So Which he's done is we've put four people in the back of the Tesla many times. It's a five minute ride. Okay. Okay. Be fine. Anyways, so we get to the house at 3 0 5, everyone's ready to leave and cash is not there. And Marick says, well I told him three 10, so we will wait. So we waited inside the house until three 10. At three 10 we walked to the car, Mav drove to the stop sign and he was like, I'll wait just a little bit longer. And so we waited until like 3 15, 3 18, whatever it was.


And then Mav was like, alright, I'm done. We're leaving. And so then we drive away and then we see Cassius car pass by and Maverick calls cash and is like, just get outta the car and hop in our car. And Cash's like, no dude, just come to the house. And Maverick's like, dude, just get outta the car and stop being brat. And they're like saying crazy things to each other back and forth. And Cash's like, Nope, I'll go home. And so Maverick turns himself around and goes to the house and cash gets out and they're like, ah, we're so haha. And then Cash gets in the car and Maverick loses his mind and says all kinds of things he shouldn't have said. He should just been quiet. No. What happened in the car? I said, I'm gonna lose my mind when he gets in the car. And then Exactly. And then I said, you know what? You're right. I won't, as long as he doesn't say anything, I won't say anything.


There's silence in the car for about 30 seconds. And gosh, she goes, well, you know, what did you say? I said, well, I said, probably would've been just a whole lot quicker if you would've waited at the house for me. That's probably true. Then I went in, you went And then argued for like 10 minutes Then. Well I'm glad we've just completely butchered this entire story. No, that was up. That Was so Lie. You just told the story. I'm not even done. Other people are story. It was the boring story I think. Yes, thank you. Because Mal ruined it all. Once again, mal Story even ruined that day. And he ruined this story. Hey, it's because He kept talking over. Okay, lemme ask. I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking what?


The story's over then Cash says something. So Maverick's like, alright, well it's all at war now. So they argue for about 10 minutes and then Tara's trying to be very positive. Tara's the boy's mom. And she's like, well boys, how we just all love each other. Let's just calm down. And they're like, and she's like, please, I just wanna have a good family trip. And they're both quiet. And then five minutes later, me and Tara are like, do you think they're okay? And then the boys are like, oh hey, blah, blah, blah, blah. And they're all best friends again. Yeah. So that's what happened. Okay. Of course They are. Well, here's what I don't understand about this whole podcast. If you have someone on who saw an alien, for instance, do you have, do you have the person who saw the alien on?


Or do you have their mom whose son saw the alien come on person? Literally, I, We, we were the ones that were in the story. And unfortunately Story, why Are we letting other people? 'cause y'all can't Story summed up in about four sentences and let do it for you because you guys could you, You Can talk about arguing. What I we're at the pickleball court. Matt walks out to me and he goes, cash, we're leaving the house at three 10 and I'm leaving with or bat without you. No, it didn't. Bye. That's such a lie. I like, no, I looked at Michael, I Said, I feel as if that had to be the truth. Oh, this is gonna be a bad experience Ma, This one Too many times. And I feel like that had to be the truth. Wait, listen. I looked at Michael. I said, I said Uhoh, this is gonna be a bad day. Because he was like, you for no reason. I'm playing pickleball. Ha. No, that wasn't to be Casper leaving the house at three 10.


I'm leaving with or without you. You wanna know the Problem? Yeah, I'm, I Can tell you. You exactly. And he's like, and you'll do what I say. No, I Can tell the problem the, well I haven't to, Hey, the judge is talking, Is speaking. I'm talking now. So listen, the not now, the haven't talked so much. I haven't gotta to say anything about the story. Harvey. You have though. We, No, I have Tiny little pieces, but I haven't gotta say anything. We're at the pickleball court and cash thinks the entire world revolves around him. And he disregards everybody else's time. And I say, Hey cash, we have to go. You can ride with us or whatever. What, what's that kind? We're leaving at three 10. And I said, no, that's matters. Is it Doesn't matter. Matter wasn't that kind. And I said, we have to go. And then he goes, well no, listen, I, I wanna play one more game. And I go, okay, well we don't have time for it.


End the game. So you have to come if, if you're, if you're writing nobody but said you have to come with us. And he goes and he goes, seriously, we're beyond the point of anyone cares. Can I just say you're, we're so far beyond the point. I wanna Give the verdict Please so we can move on. The Verdict is cash. You sometimes do not regard other people's times in the most respectful way. If he says he is leaving at three 10, you should have been there at 10. I don't deal with idiots. Guess what? After all that, we still arrived three minutes early to the place. Stop. No, we say sorry, listen to me. We were supposed to stop and get food on the way. No we weren't. We didn't have time information. He made that. Can you listen after the fact? Can you gimme So he would have an excuse Can and the driver like to send you both to jail. Now What?


You sometimes are slightly, you know, not No, Just videoing something. And it was the funniest thing ever. And then I literally it deleted. 'cause when you video on Snapchat, Oh yeah. Sometimes glitches. No. So cash. Sometimes you don't regard people's time in the best way. Mav, you are a little notorious for getting very upset. Very unreasonably sometimes. But that's okay. We all have our faults. I got upset. So That's the verdict, Wayne. I said go To prison. Come with me. Come with me to the house. Just right now. It'll just then, then we don't gotta worry about it. He wants to keep playing. It's okay. Oh, sorry, I got big hands. No you don't. You gonna say you got big beef with someone? Can you see your Hands? Oh, I mean you got put Up. Put 'em up next to Matt. Have you seen Alex's thumb?
