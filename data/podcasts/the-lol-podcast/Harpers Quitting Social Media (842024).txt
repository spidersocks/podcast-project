What should I go compete in one of the comps? You should go compete. Yeah. If there's one in Dallas, you need to sign up, bro. don don't know if y'all have seen 'em, but there's competitions where people ride around on stick horses. Like I literally just did and they like, I go to breath. It's like a competition. Like they actually rank it. Yeah. How, how embarrassing. Don don't know if I'm fit for the competition. I was made to be a hurdle. That was my, that is my calling on this earth is be a hurdle, Y'all. I I actually wanna go in one of those competitions now in this fit and just be like, No, because they were proper fits.


Like actual horse riding fits. oh, Yeah rounding. So seriously. So cosplay. oh, Yeah. No, no. They're, I'm so serious. This thing, it pop, pop, pop up a clip from just anything of that competition. No. It's usually for like 6-year-old girls. No, It's, it is Like preteens. People have started to continue now. Now older people are doing it. Yeah. It's Like LARPing. But instead Yeah, It's more like 6-year-old girls at the state fair could run around on the hobby horse and compete. Yeah. But now it's like, people take it like seriously now. and they actually do it. Yeah. What? Why the freak? Are y'all talking about it bad? I'm not. I'm right here. No, no. I wasn't talking about it about it. I was just saying what, what it is. So you think it's cool? I think it Is really cool. I, I think that, I think that, how cool do you think it is? I think It's so cool because when people, why are you looking at me like that?


I'm just wondering how cool you think it looks. Yeah. No. Okay. Because there are people that wanna do horseback riding and stuff, but a horse is a lot of money. These are at Walmart accessible to almost anybody. So I do think it's cool that if you can't keep that in mind, if you can't do horseback riding, you can Do that. Okay. But you guys gotta listen to how they write about these things. In the sports magazine, Pablo and fire nuts breezed through course with minimal to moderate galloping questioning their riding technique and possibly just considering it running with a horse head. But after 48 blazing seconds, the two cross the line to a roaring crowd. It's a race. Yeah. Oh. Or it's like a competition I think too. It's Like there's a race one.


I'm entering that for sure. Well, I think It's a race. But they also critique your riding style. Yeah. It's like they critique your form. Yeah. They, I'm not even kidding. They actually walk like this. It's Do's high stepping. That's weird. I don't like This. I'm trying to find a competition nearby. Have You ever seen the horses that do high stepping? Yeah. They like train themselves. oh, Yeah. They look so goofy when they walk the horse. They look so proper. It's like they're scared to get their feet dirty. Yeah. It's Like, it's like Kate as a horse. Literally Me as a horse. Yeah. No. If we can fire one of these competitions guys, I'm gonna go enter and I'm gonna come in at least top three, I think. Or are you gonna enter with that horse or are you gonna go? Probably this one. Definitely this one. You don't wanna go with Gerald?


No. Gerald's dead. Look at him. Look what y'all did to him. Literally. Look at him. Look at him. Right there. There actually. Okay. Wait. You can actually barely even look at him because he is not even there. You should have a funeral service for him. Oh, we should. We should. Oh, we should. To Bury and Gerald. We can't. I'll go. We can get, we can get something. Okay. The good news is it's only $5 per class to learn how to do this. There's quota. No way. Yep. People are paying And. it is also a $5 entrance fee for the general public. so we are gonna have to pay to go watch 'em. Holy cow. They're gonna make $25 off all of us. It's okay.

She does say, and she says, it's not a weird topic. You Don't share bodily functions though. You don't tear the, you're not supposed to share the graphics. Apparently, since we're on the topic, I have a message. Whoa For every single woman in the world that uses products. Tampons. No, not just that. Not just that. Listen. Pads. All of the above. Listen, when you are in a public bathroom, feminine products, feminine products.


When you are in a public bathroom, wrap it up in a piece of toilet paper. Why not the wrap? The pieces of I'm tired of seeing them. They used once. Okay. What the wrap 'em up in a piece of toilet paper. It's just common courtesy. I'm not Gonna lie. I've made my whole life without seeing one of those. And I'm, I don't wanna ever see one. And it's because You don a don don't wanna Wife that has a little bit of respect for everyone else that's gonna use the bathroom after her. I'm never going in a women's bathroom. 'cause I'm terrified. I'll see one. I'm not seeing one. And, and because he's a man, he's not gonna go I mean these days. I know. No, just to clarify, I just, I thought it was like a universal thing that like, you know, you wrap it up in a little piece of toilet paper and drop it in the bin.


But apparently not. I have learned that not everyone was taught to do do that. So it's Okay. In men's bathroom, I swear sometimes they try to pee everywhere, but in the toilet it happens. Like, I'm not even kidding. They, they go around the rim of the toilet and they just pee on all of it. Yeah. It's bad. It happens. Ew. Wait. So I heard that you did something funny on your birthday. Can you please tell me about it? Wait, before we get to the birthday, the phone's at 5%. You think that's good enough? Oh, to film a TikTok? Yeah. Wait. Let it film in a second. Before we talk about that. Harper are, are we gonna talk about how Harper is quitting social media? No. Harper. Not while I'm getting started.

Say thank You. don, your fans Don enjoy me as much As they enjoy No say thank, say thank you. Oh, thank you. And, and yeah. Yeah. Literally. Now Keep going Harper. You got this?


Yeah. I liked where you were giving the account to Kenzie. Come on. Hey, Kenzie, ask for the passwords. 1, 2, 3. No. Practically no. No. Okay. Anyways, guys. Yeah, I'm not, I don't I mean like, I, I'm scared to post on Instagram and stuff. I don't even I mean I have gone followers from Instagram. Like from posting reels Yeah. And stuff. And that's pretty cool. Like, it's awesome. No, I think, I think I know the problem. The problem is, as Harper mentioned before, is this too high? No, you're Fine. Okay. As Harper had mentioned before, she is in a public school and Instagram is a bit formal when you're still in public school.


Okay. So that's the problem. Is she, she she wants to post her cute little vacation pics. Yeah. For from Italy and from her ski trips and have cutie little captions like, love my girls. Because that's what you do in high school. No she doesn't. No one wants to do that. I actually do. Harper told me she like, love my girls, Love my girls. Or like, hang love hanging with them or love hanging with girls or, Or like, like what? Like what? Like when it's your birthday Fi cheers To 16 years Or like, or like, or like new chapter 14 or chapter. Chapter 16. 16. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you can't, you unfortunately though, when you have a lot of followers, you need to not do that because what happens is you work so, so, so, so, so hard on your tiktoks and You.


don don't post 'em to Instagram. So everyone else does. It's better. I don't let people profit off of the videos that you make. Yeah. We, we've tried to get Harper to post her. I don't profit off of Instagram. Yes. You don. Well that's 'cause You don't post. Actually no one really profits off there am not gonna cry. I be to differ. Instagram. Can you set? I beg to differ. I beg to differ. Profit. You make like $200 a month. I still make money off of it. Yeah. I mean I mean I. Guess. Thank you. Thank you. It makes about 40, 50 bucks a week. Actually, The res bonuses have been doing kind of good. What? For me the last couple weeks bonuses. Harper's like, I can make money. She's like, no, because Actually Since I'm not 18, I can't make money off of Instagram.


No, but seriously, I'm like, Harper, you gotta start posting Instagram. She's like, no, I think I'm just gonna quit And. I'm, Look, this Is a 5.6 million views. Exactly. And someone would've taken that video. So Why posted Instead? Why quit now? Why Quit now? One point, 1000000.7 0.5 million views. Wait, has she been deleting reels? Are you actually deleting content?

I was quite literally in public school as well. Oh, That's so cute. Thank you. It was for a Mother's Day post. But everybody bashed me because I didn't put, I put my mom at the end of the post. What? Well, Yeah. Sorry mom. I didn't mean to do that. I It was anyways, all about me. I Guess. It's a Harper show. It's the Harper show. It's a Harper Show. No, no. One of my friends was like, said that I make everything about myself. I'm sorry. I I didn't mean that I mean. Yeah, I mean you can try to change the name of the podcast.


Harper's podcast. Yeah, I did. It's okay. It happens. Like we Yeah. I mean. Yeah. When you made a whole new logo called Harper's podcast. No, it's gonna be crazy. Yeah. One day you should do one episode called Harper's podcast. Harper's Pod. One day Harper is gonna, is gonna like grow out of that. And she's not gonna care About Instagram. Yeah. Not, not about Instagram. She's not gonna care that the people, the 16-year-old she goes to school with. Make fun of her. I know. Because because it Happened to me. I was so, I was like, Oh man, these kids at school are so cool. I just wanna be just like di Yeah. Instead I have to have a boyfriend with 18 million followers on TikTok. oh, Yeah. That almost sounded like the south part. What was what? Yeah. That was literally how I lived my life. I was like, man, like I, I didn't know I was such a burden.


Kate. No, I Literally, when I was, I'm sorry. When I was 16, I just wanted to be like all of the cool kids at school. I Do. No, this was T at 16. I'm so sad. Yeah, I was so sad because I just want to lay in my room and cry. I was, because I went to public school. That's why I was sad because I, I did TikTok and I did public school. The two and two don't mix together. and I'm so sorry. It's fine. Do Any, any of y'all, you will eventually quit social media Maybe? No. And be a famous singer. No. You, but then you'd probably still be on it. I mean like, delete social media. Like, maybe not delete, but I may come to a point where I'm like, Hey, these videos will live on forever. Y'all can watch 'em, but I'm out. Peace. That is such a ma thing to do.


That is so mav that's So, it's possible when I'm like 35, 40, I probably, yeah, don don't know. Like, I feel like it'd be kind of weird if I, I, I may like, I may like take a young guy that's like 18, 19 that wants to do it and just like, like manage him and just, you know, help him pursue his dreams, mentor him through it. I know, I feel like if we're all like 55 and we're all like, I don No, no, no. I'll pick it up again at 55 All. right? We're back Baby golden age. oh yeah.

Like it's been raining a lot. So all of the boat docks are underwater. And We have not been able to go out on the lake. Not a time for the whole summer. The whole summer. We have not been able to take our jet skis out on the lake yet. And we've all been super bummed about it. Yeah. And That was like, my plan for my birthday was we were all gonna go out on the jet skis. so we get to the boat ramp. Obviously it's underwater. We can't drop our jet skis in Last chance to veto this. It's closed.


I think It's fine if we want to. Okay. I think it's fine. It's fine. So it should be fine. so we decide, you know what, screw this, we're gonna go to the marina where all of the boats are. What are you doing? And we hopped the fence. Yeah, we, we definitely, were not supposed to be there But. we werere like we'll just go to the marina where the boats are just kind of like, look around, see if there's a place to drop the jet skis in. If not, we're just gonna chill. So we're kind of trying to find a spot to drop 'em in and we're like, it's Like nine o'clock at night now. Yeah, It was, it was dark. There was no one out getting dark. so we were walking up and down the dock. We were like, well we can't drop our jet ski in. Let's just kind of like see what's going on. So there's a boat there. And for some reason this person, their nice big boat, the keys were just sitting on the seat.


so we were like, well it's nine o'clock at night. No one's like, like no one's out. And. It got gas, didn't it? Yeah. And we, we were like And. it had a sail. It what? Didn't have a sail. It didn't have a sail. Yeah, we did. We sailed away. No, come sail away. Come sail away. Come Sail away. Why did we sing that song then? Why do we sing the song? Well, Fun. 'cause we were just singing that song. There was no sail anyways. Yeah. so we hopped in the boat, we're like, well let's just go out for like a minute. It was, it was a nice little wake boat. We saw the wakeboard like hanging out Actually like, so we hopped in the boat. No, she, we, she stole it. She ho she jacked. Literally boat jacked it. She jacked this boat. She said, it's my birthday, we want to go out.


We said, well we're not doing it. She said, fine, I'll do it. She grabbed Hert, she took it in there and cash said, well you can't drive cash. No way. There's no way. Yeah. It was right after I, I Oh. wait, I mean we we returned the boat. We did. Yeah, I did But. we had some fun on that boat. It Was the nicest boat We have ever been on. Probably ever will be on, honestly. But it was, yeah, it was bad. I was freaking out the whole time. But I was like, you know what, it's my birthday. I'm no longer a teenager. Let me do just one last little teenage thing. One Boat Thief little boat. Yeah. Yeah. so we did that. But I was a little nervous because do y'all remember when there was like literally all the cop lights like at the marina When we got back?


No, when we were Pulling up it was Bad. There was like literally like three cop cars in the lights. So I had to go talk to them. No you didn't. Whatever In this fit. No, no, No. Now no But. we pulled up, we did decided not to park the boat. Like we parked it like close to the marina. Not quite back where we found it. Yeah. But. we just pulled up next to like the area and then we walked kind of like through the side area. Yeah. To get back to our car because we pulled back into the marina. Them cops were going to get us. oh. Yeah. They were gonna see us. They were gonna Get em. So. oh my gosh. so we were able to like get back to our car. 'cause the cops weren't by our car. Our car was like in like the parking lot over almost. That's crazy. I still can believe it. So the car, yeah, we left the boat. Dumbest thing we ever did.


Probably. But it was a lot of fun Memories. It was fun. It was But. we probably shouldn't have done it. The Mims. Yeah. I can't wait to play that video game again. GTA is so fun. Or Madden, you know. I like I don Madden. It was pretty fun. It was really fun. Ah, no, it was fun. Yeah. Until, yeah, the boat. Can we say this part? I Guess. Yeah. I Guess. We're we're this deep in this. Okay. Okay. So the real reason we had to get out was not because of the cops. What? We caught the boat on fire. It was crazy. so We, we there was a fire extinguishers.


I'm not gonna lie. Okay. Maybe We. shouldn. Okay. Maybe hold, hold Maybe We. shouldn. Maybe We, shouldn. Post this. You're right. Okay. Just like the car.

What's the worst thing you've ever done like that? Illegal Illegally wise. I'm trying to think. I don't think I've done anything that bad. I'll Have to think about it. 'cause there's been a few times. I'm trying to think if I've done anything like illegal that if I got caught, like I would've went to jail. Mm. Shoplifting. Is there anything we did shoplift. oh, Yeah is definitely shoplifting. When she was like 14. Kate's a big old thief. That's sure. But. we ever do anything But. we should.


so we would've, Did y'all never like go to y'all's friend's house and vandalize? No. What the vandalize my friend's house I mean. Do you mean like toilet paper? It That and then like we used to take Oreos and break 'em apart and lick 'em and stick 'em to the car.
