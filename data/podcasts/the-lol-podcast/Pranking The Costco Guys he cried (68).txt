And it got got crazy views, but Oh, Congratulations. Okay. I thought Congrat welcome. No need to fights, man. I thought for the longest time the Grizzler was like, with you guys, my Son. Literally your son. So, hey, I thought the same thing.


I thought the same thing. So who is the Riz kid and what Does he do? Big Joe says, you wanna tell him all about it? He's My best Friend. Oh, nice. Got, so I saw the Riz on a couple tiktoks, like his original video with the Black Panther costume that blew up. Yes. So we reached out to him and we got their number and we called his dad Brian Sava, uncle Ava. And they were like, oh, we love your videos. And we were like, we love your videos. Oh. So we kind of just connected. And from there, now we're best friends. Yeah. Smile, I feel, I feel like people know you guys all together because like, I texted my brother, I was like, oh, like the Casa guys are coming over today.


He said, is the Grizzler with them? I was like, why would the Grizzler be with him? I guess you guys are all linked together now. Wait, so Is the Grizzler your age? No, he's nine. Yeah. What? Oh, my Goodness's. Like he isn't this tall. He's nine. He's that tall. Wait, how, how old are, he's about four foot. How about Rizz? Next to big show Rizz Next Rizz next to Paul White. That was crazy, right? Yeah. That was Crazy. Wait, so how old are you? I'm 12. Okay. Okay. Turned 12. April 8th. Yep. How do you I told her it was just my birthday. No, I, I knew it. Oh, okay. I knew. Hey, happy birthday. Yeah. Happy birthday. Yeah, you're welcome. Anyways, so your, your chain.


No about it. Oh. So this usually has my boom pen. It has, it's like I got it from time timepiece trading and it's just a boom and it's has the bomb. It's just our logo, but it's like a pen with diamonds. It's really cool. But I had to take it off because it got worked on. Okay. Yeah. But normally it has like, the boom on the boom. You were, you were scared Cash was gonna steal it from you. Definitely. He would steal it from you. Don't worry. Yeah. I steal jewelry a lot. Yeah, no, he does steal mine. Sticky fingers. So you probably shouldn't leave that around. Around. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay. Or, or the watch.


Okay. Yeah. I like watches a lot. No. So when you guys first like, made your first video at Costco Yeah. Was that, like, did you guys, like, obviously y'all didn't expect it to obviously blow up, I assume. No, not at all. Like what was the thought process? I think I do think at one point though, we kind of knew we always had something special. Okay. We did. And the reason why is because we grew up watching a lot of Father and son YouTube channels. And a lot of times I would see the father taking the lead and I would see the son was just about to talk and the father would kinda like brush him off and, and not let him take the spotlight. I was like, no, no, no. I want to hear the kid. Yeah. Yeah. So that was a real vision we had with Big Justice was, I want a big justice to really take the lead on this.


Okay. And I just kind of wanted to almost be like the anti father, like the father that instead of telling the kid, no, no, no, we don't shout in restaurants. No, no, no. We don't record in Costco. I want it to be the father saying, big justice, go do your thing. I'm right here supporting you the whole way. And no one's gonna tell us we can't do it. That's Awesome. Wait, so what was the first video that blew up? It was just the, it was just the first Costco run for mommy's birthday. Well, The first video that blew up was our Sally Slices video. Right? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you guys, do you ever ever watch Sally Slices on TikTok? I don't think so. No. Oh, crazy Italian pizza guy. Great Video. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We walk into his pizzeria once and it was before AJ and Big Justice, anything. He was like, my my friends, come on in and there we go.


Yeah. It all took off from there. Aw, That's fun though. Wait, so when did the Costco videos blow up? Oh, aj. It was like one after the other. We posted one for my mom's birthday. We went and bought Meatball Mix. 'cause we were making, he makes the best meatballs. It's crazy. Yeah. Italians, they make the best meatballs. Yeah, we know that. We know that. So he was making meatballs for her birthday and he went over, he got all the mix. We did a video and it got like 10 million views. Wow. And then we kept posting 'em and they just kept getting better, like 20, 30. And then we did where father and son, like, remember that trend where Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we did where Father and Son, it got like 10 million views and then we did where Costco guys.


And that was the video that blew up. Wait, so where did the boom come from? Oh, we always said boom. Oh yeah. Always been there. It's So crazy. The, the boom has always been there and we, we just have so many more people to share it with. Yeah. So Like even before social media, you were walking around saying Boom. Yes. So when I coached Big Justice in Baseball, oh. Since he was four or five years old. And whenever Big Justice got a huge hit, we would say big justice goes Boom, No shot. So now every year the coach gets the bucket of balls and everybody would write their name on a coach, whatever. And I always put Boom on every ball. So my hard, so I put Boom on every, so even still To this day when people steal back from New Jersey, find a boom ball over the fence in the woods or something like that.


That's, or around Boca Ratone where we are now. Every time somebody finds a boom ball, they take a picture and send it to us. Oh, That's For a long time. Were you always called Big Justice? So my middle name is actually Justice. Wow. So during baseball they start calling me Big Justice. Okay. Nice. What's your first Name? Eric. Oh. Does Anybody call you Eric? Well, My grandparents and my parents and my cousins. Like, I'm Eric Justice Fumo. Oh, Right. It's a great name. That's a great name. It's a great name. That's a good name. It sounds like a famous Yeah. So I, I got a, I got a real gift for you here Kenzie. So good for Me. Wow. Yeah. Well here you go. So I've been calling him Big justice since basically he was a baby.


Right. So it's always big justice. Now his grandmother ma mom. Right. She doesn't go for nicknames. You call everybody their name. Right. So my whole life from my mom, I, I saying Big Justin, I had to hear from her. His name is Eric. But that's all over now. No, you are now Big Justin. Now He's Big Justin. Yeah. We brought that up today when you guys were on the way. We were like, what is his name? I was like, I, I don't know what his name is. What's, what's the Riz lord's name? Christian. Christian. Yeah. I was like, I don know either one of y'all's names, which is crazy. We were watching this clip before and and Age or Big Justice called the Riz Christian. Sorry. There's a lot on names. Called him Christian.


And like he looked at him like this, like, and it's like really demonic way. And he like turned his head super slowly and was like, he was like, How dare you. Oh wait, I do remember that. That was On the lowest polo podcast. Yeah, I do remember that. That was funny. He was like, He's like, how dare you Dude? Does he not kind of remind you of like a small Donald Trump? He's like, we make the best meatballs. We have the best. No, your voice actually all the boom. I was thinking about that when you were talking. Your voice does sound like that. It's like the biggest meatballs you've ever seen. They're the best ones. Hey, big, big Justice could be president one day. Honestly. You should I Make America Boom again.


So are you guys from like New Jersey, right? Yeah, we are Jersey. Which I guess is also where Donald Trump's kind of from New York area. Rizzo's from New Jersey. Yeah. So, so it's probably, so it's probably the same cadence is why I think we're related. Oh yeah, You're related. I Can see the resemblance. Oh yeah. Maybe that's not Maverick. Isn't that pretty crazy though, that two New Jersey kids that didn't know each other before, like come up on TikTok right around the same time? Dude, it's Actually gonna, same. We lived in New Jersey, we lived about a half hour apart. That's crazy. And then, you know, Risler starts putting content out. We start putting content out and boom, everything happened then Boom. Yeah. Boom. Wait, you guys only live 30 minutes away? When We were living in New Jersey. Yeah. We only lived about 30 minutes from the radio day.


That's like perfect. That's like us like she started blowing up and we're right here. She lives 10 minutes down. That's awesome. That's Crazy. It just works out no more. Only like five minutes. Honestly, if I speed, but like Speed. No, I Even, like you guys were just at Preston's house. Yeah. Or Preston's the studio. Yeah, studio. Studio. Yeah. It was like 40 minutes.

We didn't know him when he lived there. Yeah. Which is like, the odds are like, first off, there's only like 10 people in the whole state yet alone the same town. So it's just crazy. Yeah. There's there's a lot of creator hubs around the country. Huh? Like I know we have a lot in Miami down where we are.

Like overnight. That's insane. Yeah. It's, it's been a lot of fun. It's been crazy. And we talked to, we were with Preston before we got here today. Yeah. And Preston was talking about his recipe, how his recipe is always based around fun and humor. And it got me to thinking, so our recipe has always been happiness and positivity. And then from there you just, you know, you throw in other ingredients. But no matter where we've been and who we've collabed with, we've always brought that happiness and positivity.


Yeah. Dude. That's like one of the reasons we wanted to have you guys on. 'cause all we do is like Christian family friendly content. Awesome. You know what I mean? Yeah.

And We hold him And I was like, this is not good. When I was rolling up, I was looking at everyone else. I haven't been to a wedding in a while. It's like, this is definitely not good for me. And then Kate's mom made us late to the wedding and we were like probably 10 minutes late to the wedding. And we show up when the bride is about to walk down the aisle. Girl. And then wait, had the wedding party already came in? They were, Yeah. Oh yes. The bride's about to walk down the aisle song's playing it all. Oh. And, and instead the, the people like rush us in there. So we walked down the aisle before bride instead of the bride to the song. And I was wearing this and that. You got and you got shorts off? Yeah. That, that was definitely one of the top, like no one most embarrassing moment In my life.


And like it was, it was my brother's two best friends that were getting married. So they still like talk about it To this day. Like they will bring it up. That's so funny.
