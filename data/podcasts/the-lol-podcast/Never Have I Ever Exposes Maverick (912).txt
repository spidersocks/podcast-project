Lunchtime comes around, she's still too nervous to eat and she doesn't like the food. So Madox comes over and sits down and says, I don't really care for the food either, but my team is making me eat. So I'm eating right now. But I agree with you. Let's make some tiktoks. Okay. They go and make tiktoks film the music video, me and all the fans. Woo-hoo. Great time Harper gives him a non cheeky hug at the end of the night.

Me on the other hand, Youngest is, gosh, ugh. I feel like I'm I okay. Youngest. I'm gonna say 20. How old Are You? 20. I'm 20. Just because like Wow, Kenzie, she said you're weird for dating Mav. No, no, no. I'm saying like Mav is 23 and he is more mature. Like if I were to date a 19-year-old right now odds are he is not that mentally mature. Yeah. Like That was so sweet. That's the first compliment I think you've ever given me. Yeah. Okay.


I'm mature. Moving on. So anyways, not 19 because 20 is kind of pushing it. I feel like 20 year olds are like on edge. 20 oldest. Probably like 35. What? 15. You'll hide your grandpa's goodness. I would definitely, I don know. And your dad? I would. Would I brother? I would go on a date with a 30 5-year-old. 35. That's your dad's age? That's 50. My dad is 56. Okay, well it's close. That's okay. How about this? It's probably closer to your dad's age than you. No, that's 15. It's closer to, that's closer to my age. She's a decade and a half.


Yeah, that that means you, you would date someone that when you were 15. So when they were Harper's age, they weren't born. What? Someone You, you weren't born. Oh, maybe I have a, A friend who has parents that are 20 years apart. Yeah. And they're happily in lived. Yeah. Oh That's Not right. Never have I ever dated a girl 20 years apart. Never would I. What? Hmm. You thought that was silly. Silly. Yo. That was, it was slick. Because today we're playing never. No, no. Don't even try to cover it up now. That was the cringes date. Okay. Who wants to go first? All I ever heard. Wait, Matt, you gotta see you're younger. Older. I already did. Yeah. I would say mine. Okay. I would date a girl like 11 months older.


Yeah. Now what's your youngest and what's your oldest? It's really gotta be like in that 11th month range. Really? You Can see, you can see the middle bone in my nose. Your nose is turning blue. I don't like it. It is, That was weird. What? Well It was like blue. It was the lighting maybe. Well the youngest Iowa would date is 14. That's Good. The oldest Iowa would date is how old Mac is 25. Why Matt? What's the old youngest you date? Oh, about 11 months older than me. Yeah, that's the youngest my guy answer. Yeah, that'd be the youngest. What? Younger Than me. They'd have to be about 11 months older. The youngest and oldest you day is 11 months older than you. You could be in that like that range.


Yeah. Right. 30 day period. Wait, I don did you, how much older are you than Maverick? 11 months. Oh that. Yeah. That's awfully convenience. That I don't even know how you found that ma worked out. Perfect. Honestly. Honestly. That's wild. Wait, Did it actually turn blue? Yes. It's not anymore cash. What's Your oldest and youngest? My youngest would be, I don't know, maybe five years younger and five years. No older would be like Insane. No. Well you're 21 right now. So younger Ka years younger Definitely Is illegal. Yeah. Oh, ca No MA's like 19, 20, 21.


Oh cash was trying to date a minor. No. Yeah, four. Four years younger and I don't, I I don't. Hmm. If it was older, it definitely, you're Literally gonna get canceled for saying that because apparently 18 year olds are not legal adults. What people, people don't like when you say you would date an 18-year-old because they were just off, off Of being a minor. Yeah. Maybe if you're 32. I'm 21. I would date is all I would 18. So four years younger and I would date, I don't think I could date a digit older. Like it would have to be within like maybe a month or two or so. If I was 22, you couldn't date me. Probably. You'd probably be outta the question honestly. No, No, no, no. You have a Biased tv.
