I have such a bad cold And. We had to do two shows last night. So I lost my voice completely by the end of It. It's coming back a little. I've been chugging some honey. you know, I Love losing my voice. I've Like. I used to scream into my pillow to try to lose It. Yeah, You've always said That. You do I. I do like the aesthetic of it. But. Then when It actually is Like straining. I'm dying a little bit. We just shot an episode two days ago. So we're gonna do our best to pull some new topics out of our, some new guests out of our, today's episode is yet another $2,000 episode.


So I, hope you guys enjoy It. Where are We? We're in. We Are in Rhode Island. Providence, Rhode Island. Providence, Rhode Island. In this Beautiful theater. It's so funny to me. It will never get old. Looking up And, seeing all this beautiful architecture. And. Then knowing we're gonna walk out on stage. And talk about Like. Yeah And. Just another example of Like What men used to do versus like What they do now, which was Like post Instagram stories. You literally just took the thought out of my head. Like whenever I See a it in Paris. McCowell was Like going on a tangent. When we'd See like old buildings, And architecture, he'd d be like a man. like a man built That by hand. It's so Crazy. And. It's so prevalent in my mind now. 'cause I'm Like now. All they do is paint their nails. And.


Gaslight. Literally There's this cathedral in Cologne, Germany. You have to look it up. It is the most insane, intricate thing you've ever seen. It took 'em. Like like 600 years to build. Do you Think Cologne, Like, the term cologne comes from That place. I Don't know. Do you know What? I Wanna just straight up open the Podcast with I would like to know. It's Like a little crazy. It's Acra Normally this is like a three fourths of the way in topic. But. It is I Like. I mean scared. Like. I've been chomping at the bit. Okay. Okay. So a long time ago, I was hooking up with this guy And. I thought I wanted to date him. And, if you See this I, think he is gonna See this And I. Just wanna say I. Still think you're a great guy. We are still Like great friends.


Like, No. Hard feelings by anything That. I'm about to say. Okay, Lay it on me. You, You've brought this up on Cancelled. Okay, I'm talking about But. I. Don't know how to like set it up. O Okay. I can say It. Okay. TANA was hooking up with this guy who is not her typical type. Let me tell you. That much. Okay? Nothing really wrong with him. He has a great personality. He's one of my closest friends. Yes, okay, And. He is. He is great looking Like. It's just, we're just different people. But, Very just Like. Not Tana's vibe by any means in any world. Okay? And. So when she started talking to him, I was Like. This is a little, a little interesting. But. It got serious fast.


Granted, we were Like fucked up when we were Like talking And shit. So like But, we were Like planning our wedding. We were like late Como Italy. Like, let's go like It. Was Like a thing, right? Yes. And. One day. I, forget What. The conversation was But. TANA was still Tina at the time. She was drunk as fuck. Okay, And we're talking about how she's hooking up with him. And. She goes, his family owns Disney. And. We. Go But. I. Just wanna clarify. That Like. Obviously I didn't think he was Like Walt's son. Okay, I Didn't think, okay, No, she But. Well. I'm sorry, let me cut you off for a second. I'd d be like, he does not own Disney. And. You'd d be like a big part of it. Yes a big part of, he owns a big part of Disney Super, Right?


Super And riding the Dick. Like. Who? Gors. But. like, I'm just thinking about the fact That. That probably played like a major role in Like. What attracted you to him. And. you know That, that's Like a horrible thing to say. Now. But, at the time, It was just a different vibe. Okay? I Was, That was, I was in my Like. I want a rich guy. And. I never wanna work again. Era as Well, obviously wanting That. I still wanted a guy. That. I liked And. That was nice. And, whatever. you know, What, I mean? Yes. But, Yes, But. The joke of the matter was That. I have been friends with this guy for Y Like years. Yes And. So Brooke, So I'm m like, he does not own Disney at all. like And. And. So Brooke, Brooke has, Brooke has consistently cooked me for this since the moment I ever s sat on it.


And said, who? Right? Like. She has fucking Like sauteed me for this on Cancelled. Like. That's how we started ever. The bit of you saying That, Like, when I'm really shit based, I'm playing a game of telephone with myself. But, you were saying That, that's how It like Came to be. So Like. you know when like something just Like progress, like it snowballs into a bigger And. Bigger lie. Yes. And. like you believe it yourself. That is like What happened in this scenario. 1%. I was under the impression That, like I was gonna be getting married in the Cinderella castle. 100% And. So I have given her a hard time about That forever. It's my funniest joke. It's literally my favorite bit. I. Hope you guys know That when we're saying this. I mean like once every four days.


Brooke brings this up just to me or to a new person who is unaware of it. Okay? Like. I never living this one down. And obviously. Like. It's just been funny. Like, I've accepted It. like, okay, clearly he doesn't own Disney, right? Or, or clearly he's not a part of Disney in any way. Like, I made That up. I was Tina, right? So tell Me What happened, bro, The other night. I go to dinner with a guy friend of ours in New York. And. We are talking about it. And, he's friends with him as Well And. So he's talking to me. And, he's Like. Actually, didn't you used to hook up with him? And. I'm m like No. No. No. That was TANA. And. That was specifically, specifically because she thinks That. He owns Disney Thought.


Thought That. He owned Disney And. He began by bursting into laughter. Okay? As we do But. Then he followed It up by saying, O Like. Ha ha ha. He doesn't own Disney. His dad was just a huge, huge lawyer at Disney. And. I was Like. Fuck Like. Just the fact That, he has any Disney affiliation at all. like literally just ruined my whole bit a hundred percent. Because now it's Like Like almost get where she was coming from. Because Obviously you're hammered. And And. He's also the type of guy who would get hammered. And as Well kind of ju up some things. you know, What I mean Like as as a rich guy does.


So obviously he was probably just Like. My dad is high up at Disney. I love the And. Then I And. Then I just took out, my dad is at Disney. I left out high up. You, you, you just, My dad is Disney. My dad is Disney And. So obviously now I'm finally understanding That. That's where it telephoned into That. And. I feel so fucking validated. You should, because really I thought you pulled That right out thin air. I'm not kidding mean m like And. It has been treating me as such for literally a year. Like longer. I'm so sorry. And. Like. The imagine the vindication. I. Forget What. You texted me I wanna like find What? You texted me or texting me. Like. I'm eating my words. Like.


I am dying at dinner right now. I cannot believe No 'cause I couldn't even handle it. I was like, I can't even, I don't even wanna know this information because of how hard I I reamed into on it. She texted Me, she goes, I have the best news is in fact affiliated with Disney. I. Go No way. She goes, I was chewing my words. Hoo. I am sorry, But. We've all been wrong sometimes And, technically you were still were wrong. I was still wrong. But just, just Not as wrong as I wanted you to be. Yes, Like, I. 100% think I was still wrong. We've all been wrong. Just the actual genuine Mickey ification of hazing That, you have given me for the last year to feel any form of vacation.


I'm m like TANA. Can you get us Disneyland tickets? Like? Come on, No. All my we'd be anywhere. And she'd d be Like, TANA. Can We get a fast pass? Like, she would never live it down. And, come to find out, this man's father was high up at Disney. Again, I I Never Well. He was probably just a big lawyer who happened to work with Disney. Maybe once. Honestly, I'm gonna call him. Call him. I'm Calling you Well, actually. Okay, maybe not. 'cause his dad died. You know? you know But. We talked about it A lot. Okay, his dad died. He inherited Like $50 million. I'm calling him I. Don't know if he'll answer. He knows. You think That. He owns Disney, by the way. And, I'm sure. That. That's some at fault. That's Dylan's fault. Hello. Hi TANA.


My engineer's name is TANA. I was like looking at my phone. I'm Like. I can't answer. TANA. And. I again. And. I'm m like TANA. You have an engineer named TANA. No. TO. Tane. Okay, Well. Hi. It's Like. Looks Similar. And. I was Like. I. Don't wanna answer. Then I got another phone. mean m like It's it TANA, it's TANA. I have a question for you. Can you explain to me, And, you can also just tell me to literally shut the fuck up. Fuck off. And, kill myself. Okay? Okay. Can you explain to me me your family's affiliation with Disney? My That worked for Disney. What. Yeah. You told them That. I said I. Was Like an owner? I never said That. I. Okay, we can unpack this later.


I'm filming I. Thought you were okay in the state. That I was in I thought. That. That's What. You That your family. Were owners of Disney But. We're recording a podcast right now. Obviously I won't leave any of That in But. I. Just wanted to know if you had any comment. Comment. Yes. Like. like just where Did It come from? Where, Where, where does your family, where do you stand with Disney? I mean Like. Am I affiliated Yeah? Or just was anyone closely related to you? Yes. Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse, Yes. Am I on the Podcast right now. Yes. I'm putting him on the Podcast. 100% I. Don't know if I actually should though.


He's a very private guy. He is a private Instagram. He's not a private guy. He's out with GE Z every night. Well, we just called him I. Don't necessarily know how much he wants to be affiliated with the Cancelled podcast. So we may have to cut That. We don't have any I mean he said, yes-ish. One day we're gonna get to the bottom of this. Are you related to Donald Duck? And is That. Why We? Donald Fucked. you know, know it. You were talking about how much you love soft pics the other day. Okay, And. And. you know, What. Actually I. Don't even think I'm ashamed of That at all. I love. If I love. Probably nothing more than a soft pic. Why? Because I, It feels Like. I'm in the room with it.


you know, What. I mean Like. No, Like. Elaborate. Like if It, if it's hard, it's like I can't even relate to That. Like. I've never really seen much of those. But, No But. like there's something like it's more intimate than Like a regular Eck. It Like feels like it's more because they're more vulnerable. you know, What. I mean Like. They have to really care about you. And really like you And really be confident. And, Like securing themselves to send a soft Pic. And does this Like get you off? For sure. And. So then do you want them to like cup it in their hand? like What is the What, are they just standing up in the mirror Like Yes? Sometimes it's like That or sometimes it's just Like. Lightly pulled outta their pants.


And. It's just like What. If they're like What, if they're a grower And, then they send you like a little knob gripping on That knob. That has happened to me before. But again, it's Like. I'm, if I'm asking for it, I'm asking for it. I, don't think I've ever received a soft dick pic in my entire life. Well. I had one guy who like couldn't send me anything. But a soft pic because his just didn't get hard. O, same. Anyway, Yes. I do love a soft pic. It is I am not ashamed to admit It. I don't know why. I just do. But Mean. How do you like for the first time, ask for That. Like or Like. He sends you a Hardick, Well No, Like O on FaceTime. He'll be like, show It to me. And. Then he'll be like, Well, No. It's soft. I'm m like, I. Don't care. That's my favorite. And. So then he will, or I don't know.


I don't think that's That weird. Paige backed me up. Soft Yeah. I mean so into it. Yeah. Paige is into it. Really? Okay, wait then. Then I wanna revisit this once Paige gets on, because I Wanna know, like, think about it. You can Like push it in. You could tie it in a little knot also. Okay. you know What, let me compare it to you. This is like the reason That, you want to people because not so much so That. You want to do It, But, But. It's like you want to know That. They'll let you do it. Like. I want to know That. They will send me a soft Pic. You just read me because they Like me. Thatch. Yeah. You just read me to filth. Because now I I literally completely understand But I. Don't know if I've ever talked about this on the Cancelled podcast.


like post clarity I. Don't I, don't know That. You have I. Don't know If I should actually, you have you said No. I said I. Think I talked about it at a live show. O, because this girl was asking Like Should I my boyfriend. And. I was Like. Well. Just beware For The aftermath. Aftermath. 'cause then What Like, obviously there's so much lead up. And build up to Like. O My God. Like, I'm gonna you. This is awesome. This is so awesome. And. You're fucking But. Then afterwards you're like, damn, you really let me, you And. Then you Like. Watch him with this boys Like, acting And. It's like m like the the strap on was pink. Fuck. you Know, Like I. Don't know. Yeah. I get That. I, Yeah, And. This is all Just Like. That's Sad though, because it's like There. They did. They just did this Like really nice thing for you. And. Now you look down on them.


No. But. It's kind Of Like, See. Like like I. See a soft pick. And. Now I think the world of you. Think about how Like, even last night at one of the shows, this girl wrote into our advice segment. And said, my boyfriend really wants to on me And. I let him And. Now I'm Like. I didn't Like. I love him. So I said Yes. And, which is just fucked. Like. Don't do That. Like unless don't Like. Wanna get on. Don't do That. Don't But. I'm not kink shaming. But. Like. Also I kind of am Like I. Don't understand why I don't know I. Don't know But. Then after he on her, he was probably Like. Damn I just on you like Has Yeah. Now she like has to walk around the grove with her being Like. Yeah on her. Yeah. Like, I. Don't know. I don't like.


I'm not into That. I mean And. You, you know What. I'll try just about anything. But. I'm not getting on No. Yeah. That's so fair. But. Also, have you ever experienced, have you ever been with a guy who won't let you See his soft No? I have What? Do you mean I have been with a guy who literally wouldn't even Like the second That. We were done. He was Tuck That shit away. I was never allowed to See it unless it was Like. One time I was in the shower. And. He had to like I had to wait for him to get hard to Like for him to get in with me. Can you say who It is? And. We bleep it. That's Like. So weird. Like. Why? I don't know And. He had a honker on him. So like And I wouldn't call It a Honker. I think he knew his angles. That's weird.


S calling me back. You fully remember the story But, Like. Like have to like cut this if you don't want podcast about it. So should I call you after No? You can wait. Wait, why? Okay, I, tell me the context first. Like, you're live on the microphone. Okay, But, tell me the context. I don't have I don't have time. Right? I don't have time right now. 'cause We have to be done filming in Like. 40 minutes. Essentially like I Th I thought something I you after I thought something. Brooke was cooking me about it. She went to dinner the other night with Adam Fa. He was like, wait. His dad was like a lawyer at Disney. Yada yada. Brooke feels bad for making so much fun of me. 'cause she thought That I fully pulled it out of thin air. O No. No No. You No Yeah. I mean Well. Do I want my dad's job? I mean he's dead. So I, guess it doesn't matter.


But No Yeah. My dad was EVP Disney But for like 30 years of of TV But. The thing is, 'cause We were like we, you were like I, Like, Disney movies. And I was like I fucking hate Disney movies. And. You were like, why? I'm Like. I have P Ts m. like my childhood is Like Disney. Shit. And. Then Like months later, Dylan goes, P I thinks you own Disney. Okay. I was like, But. Listen, like it's not as far of a reach as everyone thought it was. I mean, babe, I'd be a fucking billionaire. I'd be, come on, you'd have fucking 20 Birkins at this point. If it was the owner of Disney know What O shit. know I'm gonna end this call on That note. We love you.


You later That. Alright, bye bye. Anyhow. Damn the wedding What

Alright, I, have a lot more topics. But. I. Do think That, they would be funny with everyone else. Okay, Should We bring everyone else on? Yeah? Alright, And, now we welcome to the Cancelled podcast. Paige, Cameron, And, Amari Stewart. Anna Delion, dancing with the Stars. you know That, we already brought this up. But. you know That. Now she's eliminated. Right? Right. Which is just funny. I wanted her to last Like three weeks. But in her exit interviews like they're asking her Like. So What, are you gonna take away from this? And? She's Like. Nothing. I didn't want do it. I. Don't fuck with It 'cause it's Like. like it was funny in the beginning. But, it's also like you ungrateful bitch I. Just, here's my thing, I love a bitch with zero media training. Like. It's so funny to watch them just be so chaotic.


Like Like a chaperone. Yes. Speaking of love We to get into That. Yeah. Any thoughts? I personally just feel so bad because That guy, Ezra, it's his first season ever. So it's Like O Yeah. I See. A lot of confidence. Like. That. Where it's like Yeah. It's just Like. Damn. He deserves so much more And. He's so talented. And. Then like this is your partner And, how youre going out And know every single person on Dancing with the Stars. He is like stoked to be There Once to win Like. This is an anomaly in the sense. That, Like, Yeah. It's like a lot of people's dream. Mine. And, I. Don't know. I feel like she was kind of like I Justice for Anna. Delve v But also like I. Understand why people were so mad. I think she got eliminated because they got so much backlash for her being on It. Honestly to God, the ankle. Don't, Don't think it had anything to do with the, with the votes or anything. I. Think That.


They eliminated her because It was not a good look for Dancing with the Stars. Yeah I, I. At first. At first I was like, this is so Camp Like, bedazzle, That, ankle monitor, And, go do. Horrible. It was just a fly. It was a Tactle. And. Just go do a horrible fucking salsa, right? like that's funny. But. Then obviously as It continued to come out, Like how not excited she was, was kind of Like such a fuck you to Dancing with the Stars. And. It's Like. Why say Yes in the beginning? Imagine her PR people like, you know, they are scrambling like they thought this would Like do something insane for her. And. Then she's Like in the, in the fucking Like could free her from the ankle bracelet. Well. And. Just like I Like, Cancelled But. like remember when Olivia Jade went on And? Everyone was Like.


This is the cutest thing ever. Yeah And. That was right after her cancellation. And Honestly. She was so good on It. But. It's 'cause she took It so seriously. She was so into it. And. She was so good. Wait, wait. You're telling me Olivia Jade went straight from rowing to dancing with the Stars. Yes. And. That's why she was so athletic. Wait, okay, I'm confused. I haven't seen Clips. I haven't seen clips of Anna Delve dancing was she's just Like not giving a fuck. I Haven't seen a single clip of her dancing. I've Do you Think her little right leg was Like a little weighed down? She couldn't move properly. O Hit this Sal. I didn't think about That. Well, all I've seen is interviews Like in every interview. She might as Well have gone Like on the fucking interview. They go, where are you gonna put the, like the golden trophy or whatever. If you win And, she goes in storage. I thought she was gonna say Like in the trash.


No, No, But. It's like That or Like. What are you most excited for after dancing with Ezra Like, whatever. And. She's like the outfits Like. It's Like. Insane. Do you think that's Like her actual personality? Or do you think she's Like running with this bit? And trying to like put on this persona. There is this clip of her where Like before the camera focuses on her And dancing with the star. She's all like Smiley, And, whatever. And. Then she notices the camera on her And. She goes like, Like Lana Delray accepting Like except the word she's laughing. She goes Like, just starts Magging. Like was Like ready for It? Lana Del Rey Got married. Dude I. Do you know about this? Amari? You told Me about this the other night. But. I'm not like as into Lana Delrey as you guys are. Boo. So I have No idea. Any of this was going on. I'm Wrong. You're wrong.


Wait, What. Just for like not being into her Like. We are o, sorry. And. I Literally woke up TANA the other morning with That news. That was the first thing I said to her. I busted through her door.

She's Like. We are not dating Me. Two Months later she's married. Maybe That. Maybe that's What.


She meant she's, they are not dating. They're re the here actually engaged. Absolutely. It's just so Lana Delray, it's like I. Feel like Lana Delray is constantly doing things. That are so, Lana Delray, But, Like, That. Even the fans couldn't think of Like. She's one upping the so Lana Delray image. She is But sometimes like I love And admire so much Like people who just want be fucking normal. like And. Did you See her walking down the aisle. There's like tractors next to her Like.

The pause would be like a minute long. Like do. You're Like. Dom D is a good rapper. Like Dom DLA is performing tonight. It just makes sense for That to happen to you. It Really is.


It's just That. Was I mean? That was a different girl. I'm reformed. No. But. Jesus Christ. I'm surprised I've never been called the wrong name. I. Think about That all the time because all my men always have Like. Five girlfriends at a time. Oof. O. Last night, Brooke Amari is Like in the corner of the fucking tour bus. like in my room. And we're all Like hooting. And hollering. Kiki And, he's Amari is so wildly addicted to this iPhone game called Genian Impact. And. I mean Like sponsor Me. Wild. Wildly addicted though. Do you know one time I was Like really shitting on him about It And. He goes, they have more Twitter followers than you. like. Defend The here. like defend the here like 4 million Twitter followers. They're huge. Who's they? Gen? They impact Defend But. Anyways, And, obviously I haven't seen Amari.

Wait, give Paige the mic. Did she talk? She starts O. Sorry, I. Keep getting comments on my TikTok being Like. You look Like young car Baskin. I'm m like, shut up. I. Don't want to hear it. And.

Tell me this couldn't be potentially Paige's mother O. Wow. You know, Wait, why is she's a badie? Yeah. She speaking of us. I. And. I.


Wonder. She was getting, getting them in. And, killing him. And whacking 'em. Like. You. you know. So anyways, we're trying to get Amari's attention. And like, we're like Amari. You have to See this photo of Paige's mom. Like. They look just to like, like he was ignoring us in the room while we're having this whole conversation. And, we sent him the photo of young Carol Baskin And. He's Like. O My God, that's so cute. Like. Paige's mom is so cute. Like, whatever, blah, blah, blah. And. We're dying. Laughing. And. Finally, he's Like. What, And. We're like, that's young. Carol Baskin And. He goes, O I just didn't even look like he, he didn't even fucking No. No. He didn't even look at the photo. I looked But. It came in. And. There was a text message at the top. And. The photo was just right. There in the corner. It's Like, I, See It. Small And. I was Like. They do resemble each other. No, You don't give a fuck about Us young Carol Baskin is serving And I.


Don't give a fuck about Carol Baskin. You should But. It Was the fact. That, he was so immersed in playing Genin impact That. We had this whole conversation two feet away from him. And, he didn't, didn't even notice. Aw man. like, like was telling TANA about how Like, I've been getting comments. And like, we're looking up Carol Baskin. He didn't hear a word Locked. Okay, But. This is the queen of elective hearing right here. So it's the Podcast calling the Kettle black. Why? You always go to deflect blame? Because You're sitting here talking about how I wasn't listening. You're like, That. Was Paige talking about how you weren't listening? You brought It up. Because you're talking about how I wasn't listening. But Paige. Paige just said I love when everyone fight, Sibling a behavior Caught on camera. We started Chimp. Crazy. How Far in are you? Four minutes.


Brooke. Brooke, I'm gonna try again. Okay. But, I, And. Paige has a lot of thoughts on this as Well. Dude. It's weird. Here's a Dude. Here's my thing. Yeah, that's the whole point. But, you don't understand how crazy it gets. Chimp's kind of freak me the fuck out. And. I just realized it's Like. But. You Don't understand how crazy, crazy it gets. like It, like it's so wild. And. The fact That There are people like this who just roaming the earth, like the pe, the owners of the chimps. By the way, Yes, it is not even like it's Like Tiger king on crack I. Don't know if I can get over the like, ugh. Feeling like why do you have a walk-in h Hannah Montana style closet of clothes for your chimp Like.


That chimp wants to be, because it's Like a Swing From a tree. No, But. We were so high That, it was freaking me the fuck out. Like I was looking at these chimps, And. I'm m like they are one degree away from being human. It's It worse than That. They have the strength of Like 12 men. So like We were watching one of the chimps watch tv And. The thing was like clapping, And going crazy. I was like, wait, I mean Man, wait, you seeka who To drive a car? Okay, But. It's actually scary 'cause they, they age just Like humans. So Like, when a chimp is tiny, they're the cutest things ever. That's the ones you're Like swinging around. You See 'em in movies, And stuff, But. Then they grow into Like. These enormous animals, And, they can rip doors off of cars. And, Like, Like. the here. Scary objectively are a very fascinating And, cool animal I.


Don't know if I can get behind these chimp people. But, you Know, Yeah, But, But, That. You can because it's so insane. And. Just the way That, they like the lengths they go to to own these chimps. Like, underground. It is the craziest thing ever. Like set Those chimps. Free, Free, free But. You have to See. There's this girl O God, I Wish I. Remember her name. What, Did you say toddlers? And Tiara's Chimp edition. like that's What. It. Fucking like they were going to Like beauty pageants. No But, Like. Can I give you a spoiler? Yes. Well, okay, But. This is a spoiler alert for the fans. Imagine TANA has a chimp, okay? Right? She Calls you, she calls you And. She says, my chimp is running rampant. I need you to come help me. Like corral him. Okay, so you show up to help And. You have his favorite Elmo toy.


You have his favorite Elmo toy. You're trying to lure him in. He comes And. He starts, he pulls both of your hands off. Rips your face off your body. And, dismembers your whole body. Okay? Okay, But. Like. You Like. TANA calls the the police. And says, my chimp is killing my friend. My chimp is killing my friend. Okay? The girl, her whole, she had have an entire face transplant. You should have seen What. She looked Like, And. Then sh TANA goes back out. Less than a year later, And buys another Chimp. That is the ultimate disrespect. That. You have to be like on drugs. I mean. I'm sure they are But. like that's Like. What happened. But. That's how attached they get to them. 'cause they're Like ba, they're babies Does do they know. like If Murphy read someone's face off sucks for you.


But, Like, I just getting attached to a chimp. I think is like I. Just I can't I don't know What mean Question mean. So, so Like, how is this not fucking illegal? 'cause Clearly it iss not. That's the point. That's the whole process. Like the concept of the show. They're keeping them lowkey in their basements. And, Like hiding them from the feds. What the fuck. And. It's like a whole thing. One of them 'em killed off. Tonka. And made fake, fake ashes. And, they're looking, everyone's looking for Tonka And. She's Like. Tonka is dead. She's in court going, I miss him. And. Then she's just going downstairs to her basement to feed him. That actually Is fucking crazy though. But I understand What. You're saying like the, here they are so cute. Like you have to watch it as babies' with them. Dude. Do you know That, you chimps have been taught sign language.


And the really, think about this, the longest sentence That, a chimp has said in sign language is like 18 words. Yes. They're very smart. New, there's a gorilla's. know 40 words And. Then the sentence is like, give me food. Give me food now give me food. Give me food. Or I hurt. like it's Like. No. Who was the gorilla? There was a gorilla who was taught complete a SL. Who? Coco. Coco. Coco. Cocoa Gorilla I. Think he actually just recently passed But. He, he was, he was fluent in a SL. I'm not even kidding, But then I'm thinking about Chi. Crazy And. I'm thinking like Jane Goodall could have could've slayed Like Jane Goodall. I'm, I'm positive she could have just skipped down the street with those things. Have You seen like the orangutan on TikTok?


About Like Does the bag halls. No. See. I'm telling you, we're on different sides. But. Like people Yeah. Last week, Paige is talking about rock cleaning competitions. This week it's Orangutan Bag Hall. O And for those have been, who have been asking if I'm on Nutter butter? TikTok, Yes, I am What What happens on nutter butter. TikTok. So Who has been asking Multiple people? Yes I am on nut Butter. What happens on nutter butter. TikTok, I'll show you What. Is It? It's like five words. Like, just please. Or 10 brain rot official Nutter butter account. O I Can't wait. Like. Deep fried Me. Okay, so isn't one of those, isn't It one of those like Like, gen Z people who are running accounts And, they're like really funny. like the Empire state Building account. But, The here, Which by the way, me, And, the Empire state Building are beefing.


Okay, we are in a fight And, we are No longer friends, because I'm not even kidding. 'cause they, they Like moving From like Alyssa Violet to like the Empire state Building. like Just No. I'm not, not even kidding. I was Like going around boasting about how close me And the Empire state Building were. Because obviously we've been texting And I was in New York for four days. Ghosted me the whole time. It's literally I felt Like. He Like. Literally, you know, I love me know, you know, when a guy is Like, all Like excited to hang out with you until it actually comes time And. Then all of a sudden he just disappears. That's What I. Think about the Empire state Building. So I'll, I'll remember this Left, left me speechless Honestly. It's funny because Paige has a similar situation about That. But under the Empire state Building.


And I was actually gonna ask you to talk about It. Do you want to talk about it? Yeah? I'll open up. Okay. But to finish my thought. Sorry. Orangutan TikTok. I'm not kidding. People will come by Like holding their bags. And. They'll go like this. And Like. They'll take out items. These like this Like Bag halls. It's actually so scary. Bag halls. You know, What. What is Like. The percentage of Like difference between our DNA And. A And. That's What. I'm saying if That question has to even be asked, I cannot get behind big chimps. Like m like them where they, where they're at. Like jungles. And zoos. And shit. But, Like. People just kicking It with them. It's like, okay, it, because they Are so close to humans. And. That's why they're so smart.


And Honestly. There's the are probably chimps out. There. That are completely smarter than us. Yes. There are chimps. First of all, there's, She can't drive Chimp probably smarter than us can. Tonka, the chimp could drive better than her. Dude a newborn That 5-year-old girl just went to Target. like, anyone can drive better than me. like, do you know That There was this psychological study done? That the human brain, if they, if you See something really close to a human But, it's not a human Like, for example, AI robots or like certain things, That, your brain is wired to feel uneasy about That. like, because it's like your brain can't compute That. It's Like not, isn't a human.


Fully Isn't like uncanny valley. Yeah like It. It's kind of Like That vibe. But. People Always comment. That That on my tiktoks That, wow, I'm sorry. That's, that's Like how I feel about chimps. like it's too close to a human. That watching It do human Like things kind of freaks me out. I don't know know, tell me about this man. Know That.

If you really wanted to See me, you would've seen mean in New York. Yeah, good luck in our And. Here's my thing. I'm kind of in my era now of like saying What, I feel. Because I feel like for the most part, I don't do That, Yeah, And, Like, I. Just hold shit in. And, Like, I, I. Just look back And like, there's so many times where I'm Like damn I should have said this.


I should have spoken up about this And. Now it's like I have the opportunity to like do That. Why not just text him? And Say how I feel No. I mean just I'm all for That. Just But. I was just talking to Jordan Morona about this weirdly for Like a long time the other day about how some people are just Like innately Like, That Like, just abrupt And say what's on their mind. And Like address situations, And. Then some people And. It all kind of comes back to your childhood. If you were raised with people pleaser tendencies or not Like, you know, What. I mean Like, I don't know. It's just some people don't ha Like have That in them. So it's harder for some people. It's So hard for me 'cause I'm such Like a bite my tongue. Keep the peace type of person. So I feel like I'm really working on like saying how I feel.


And Yeah, I'm m Like. Show It out. There There my tongue ruin my life. Yeah. I, just I. Feel like my fuse has gotten shorter. So now I'll be like, okay, Well sucks for you. Sorry you couldn't See me then you can't See me now. Sorry. Yeah, And, I. Think that's just like how I wanna go about it. Yeah, I Also think That. It's like he's already shown himself to you. So if you were to get in any deeper And, then this were to happen. Imagine the Like, genuine Like, Yeah, And. He'd d be like Like already knew That. This was coming. And I. Put myself through it again. Yeah, you know, I. Guess I. Always just try to Like take things at face value to Like. If he's telling me, O my God, I'm so tired 'cause I did Molly And, I'm fucking crashing out right now. like da da da m, like try to consider That But. Also, I'm m like, that's such a good shit. No, But, But. If you really wanted to See someone, would you ever text him? And say, I'm too tired. Yeah No Never And.


Why are you 35 taking Molly? Like. Is That just not a red flag To anyone's I. mean I. Guess it's I. mean I. Don't know. To me the here 35 isn't old at all. If they're taking Molly in Like, a camp occasional way at 35 Like, okay, But. If they're Like taking Molly all the time at 35, then Yes, that's the biggest red flag ever. Well. What is a camp occasional way like Like. They like a Peggy Go Concert. Like, they have a good job. everything is fucking, their life is in order. They don't have any addictive tendencies. Problems. And. Then they go to Like, a music festival with their friends. And. They take Molly Yeah like, like the here they go to Burning Man. Nope, that's always wrong. But in their Teslas, you don't Like burning man.


Man, when the here si they take their cyber trucks to Burning Man O No, But, you know, What. All this to say I have a really hard time standing on business. And. I'll probably be in his bed in approximately two weeks. O my God. So, so like, like sometimes I just wanna Like chain you to something. HR violation, I won't o, speaking of talking to Jordan And shit, I've been, we've been doing meet And greets, right? And I've met like at every meet And, greet, pretty much I have people be like O I came to the TANA And friends tour or I came to like your first ever tour or Like I came to this tour, right? And I was just talking to Jordan about Like. All of those old shows, And, I was thinking about Like my first ever run of tour, right? I was Like 16 years old doing these shows, maybe 17 years old, And.


So then That means my audience was probably Like 13. And 14. And We would have to do the shows in the daytime like Meet And, greet at 10:00 AM Like I was awful. Okay. O No. And. Like Show at Like 3:00 PM because like the bars couldn't open Yeah. 'cause It was Like a mat. It had to be like a matinee, right? And. I was asking Jordan I was like, What. Did I do on stage? And Like. This was during my Storytime era. So I would just walk out And Like do one. Storytime, right? The tickets were very cheap. But. Imagine like the whole show was just me coming out here doing a United Airlines rant, And, then walking off of stage, right? I Love That. And at this time too. I. Think I was a lot more vulgar. like obviously just 'cause I hadn't been raised yet. like Jordan helped raised me.


like I was just like straight out of Vegas. Awful. Like on stage. like Job Like. Awful. And. We demonetized. Yeah. That might happen to be a lot of bleeping But. Often I would have Like. Moms would bring obviously their kids. And I would have moms like, stand up And. be like, What, Like. Stop using this language. What the fuck is the show. I'll never forget this one time in Freehold, New Jersey, I was playing I play. And. I. Like was on stage telling Like a sex story. And again, obviously like I'm m like 17 And. There were some older people as Well But, like. Also There were people who were my age at this time in my crowds.


And I was telling a story. And, this mom stands up And. She's like, shut the fuck up. like, stop doing this And I. Were you There for That I? Remember when I think this is the same Mom is That the one That called the police? That's What. I was gonna say. So Yeah Like, she's saying That And. I very much obviously just rowdy wild child. Vegas I was Like. Listen, I'm sorry, you're not monitoring What. Your kids watch. like It was just like And. Then obviously probably Like 17 And. Then like obviously as Well, the whole audience was just wild And TANA fans. So they're booing the mom. Like. It's like It. It was like crazy. It was wild. And. Then she called 9 1 1 on my show. And said, What Like. I See. A girl using poor language.


Essentially Yeah. Essentially Yeah And. like the police came But. Then they ended up Like coming on stage. And Like. The show just went on. Yeah Yeah It was a moment like the here. Like And. Everybody knows That. I'm a good girl officer. You know what's so funny? That, you brought That up. Sorry, ma Thank you the last meet And. Greet That. You did. Some girl came up to you. And. She was like O my gosh. like the last time I saw you was Like. When we were so young, my mom brought me to Like. Your show And. You kept talking about doing And. She literally had to make me leave. O like That happened. Like a decent amount of times. That's Insane. That's sad. We had one mom in the audience last night. I don't even I don't know if you saw her. She was literally Like right over here. And the whole time. I'm not kidding. It was just never even cracked a smile.


And. I was trying so hard for her. I couldn't do It. And. A lot of our stories are Like. Way more Like. A childhood trauma story, a shitting yourself story. They're not as Like know. You know What. I mean But. Not know But. Just think about the context of my YouTube videos. At the time. Like, That was the time bleep this. Obviously for those who know Like. My biggest storytime was me talking about a fight in the airport where I'm going, you're a, you're A, you're a. So Like. That was Like. The whole context of Like, those shows. O okay, Yeah. And. It's just Like. Who gave me a microphone? like But. It is weird now because Like we do shows. And, Like. 24-year-old girls will come up And. They'll be like, I went to your show eight years ago. And. That is insane. Whatever. Like, it's I. Don't know. It's just fucking interesting.


Raised by Tana. Mongeau a. Anyone that's been raised by me, But, you Have a pretty good retention rate. Yeah, the here Coming. They just, they deserve financial compensation. the here coming back. Okay, Like, that's all you know. It's just Like fucking nuts. It is so crazy to Like. Have a fan base that's growing up with you at The same time. Like simultaneously. That's Literally What. I always say I'm Like. Thank the here. like you raised me. I'm Like. Thanks for growing up with me. Obviously like That is just Like fucking insane. O my God. We have a Scorpion update. So you know how last time on the podcast we talked about how I had a roommate who went on a date with a guy Yeah I. Thought it was Paige, No, No. No went on a hinge date with a guy And. Then You never said It was your roommate. You said close friend o Well. It was Ashley o And.


She went on this date with a guy And. He gave her Scorpion venom. m like out of a dropper. And. I was Like babe. That's gh. HB Like, What are you doing right? Right. But, I, podcasted about it. And. Then he found out somehow the guy O, the Scorpion guy And. So then she makes a TikTok about it. That's why I'm now allowed to like say It was her O. She blocked me one day. One day. We'll work it all out on the remix. But, any Zy. He said That. He was doing a scorpion. The reason he found out is because he was at a Scorpion Venom convention running a booth, And. All of these young girls were coming up to him asking if It had Like Roofies in it. And, he was Like. After Like. The ninth girl came up to the booth. He was Like. Why are you asking That, And, Like?


The girls were like, I just watched this episode of the Cancelled podcast. Where Like, someone Like was talking about Scorpion, venom, And, Like, yada yada. And. It's just funny. like him Like, the actual guy I was talking about ended up Like. I, Like. It's just so weird to think about the like impact of Cancelled. like I. Never think about things like That, like That. Now all scorpion venom salesmen might be questioned by girls in our demographic. you Know, he wants to come on the Podcast And spread awareness about Blue Scorpion Venom.

Don't want any man who wants is begging to go on the podcast. And I, respect her for That.


So heavily There is one thing I wanna talk to you guys about Yeah. I just recently was tripping with tart O Yeah. I was in New York City. Like literally at the same time as you guys, which is just so crazy. I went a little early because you guys were There. I didn't even See you at all. I had No idea. You were There Yeah, Which is just so Like weird. But No one told me But. It's just so interesting. Like being a part of That Well one. I'm so grateful. It was so fucking cool Being being part Of That Yeah it one, it made No sense to me because What business do I have on a tart trip. Plenty of business. You're amazing. And, fless, Yeah, But, Like. Where's my wing? Eyeliner. O, right? you know like What What. Have I ever promoted to about Yeah? Maybe That was Like a Mario invite.


Okay, so I found out like the reason why That, they were doing this 'cause I was Like. Everyone saw the air. Me bracelets, And I. Remember getting my package at the house. And I was Like I, there's know there's No fucking Air Me bracelet in my package. Two different things. So Tart was doing like the gifting or whatever for the girls. I'm sure that's just for people. That Like make great sales And. Then they wanted to do something for creators. That are Bipoc, which is black, indigenous people of color. And, What, am I, you know, And. So that's how I caught my invite. And so grateful And had so much fun. As for the Charlie XCX Sweat or Charlie X CX choice on sweat tour It was fucking nuts. Imagine Madison Square Garden full O my God, full Of the girls in the gays.

Did I also put up a you? you know how you can Like write on Snapchat? Like know you. It's my Favorite. B know I. Put it up to my head. And. I go. Anyone got poppers? Wait. And at one point cigarettes question mark. But going into it. I was so nervous because I mean you guys have been on Like really cool chart trips. Like, the ones That have Like.

A bunch of with all these tar was And shit. Girls There were girls. Like, I. Remember We sitting in the Uber, And, Like. We're talking the here Well. I'm just sitting There playing Shin Impact And. They're like talking about Like wedding bands, And Diamonds, And, all this stuff. And, Like. Even Like. I wanted to meet Maureen so bad because you know, she gets down.


Yeah. And. She wasn't There, she was in Florida. And I was so sad. O Like. How do you know That? But? you know she Like to have fun. She has a good time.

So then tell me, so then Tari Yummy shows up. And Like. Do you have any tar, yummy tea? Any tar, yummy lore. Like, What. Did you guys get into We? Went out after to Like. Various like bars. And, I, Like. you know, Like. Did You feel like you were I? Feel like Tara Yummy at a Charlie X CX concert. Was is Like Kim K At the Met When We were leaving? When we were leaving, It was Like. Literally a madhouse. And. Not to even mention Like. Just Like. The the everyone. There was already so amped up because Like, you're bringing out Addison Ray, you're bringing out Lord. You're bringing up the original Apple girl. like just Like.


It was nuts. That, Like, What, they put into this concert. So everyone's vibes are so high. We're leaving. I'm not kidding. I felt like I was leaving with Kim Kardashian. And. I was Like. This is lit. We talk. I mean Like. She put you to shame. No, No, But. It's crazy. Can we talk about Addison Ray for a second? O my God, I'm so obsessed with her. I mean Obsessed. Dude. I was up until 3:00 AM last night. Deep diving like Addison Ray's Lo And, We were talking about this the other day. 'cause obviously we've known Addison for a very long time. And I fucking love her. And. I always have I. Think she is Like the sweetest girl in the world. Who Like truly means Well. But. It is funny because I, my first memories with Addison Like, when I first met her And stuff, she very much was Like Crawfish.


And, What. Did Tim Dylan say Crawfish And hate. Like. Kidding. Not hate But. Like very much. Like. Where's the fireball? Y'all O like Yeah. When We were in That car. know, you know What? I mean? Mean sorority girl ass outfit. And. Now Like seeing her at like the VMAs. And. She Like No. Southern accent. Like, full rebrand. Cadet like And. The full rebrand is so insane. 'cause Like, at first she went from That to like high fashion, right? And, she was killing high fashion. But then decided That. Her niche was like two thousands. Tumblr, you know And. Now it's all like sideways digital photos. And Like getting the paparazzi photos in Like with the Britney book. Half read. Even though she just bought It. And I love That. You Like say this like the full 180. She's done. Because when I saw her come out, I went to like text her after to like see what she was up to.


And it's like, okay, Addison's not gonna respond to me. Like come on, she's left. No, everyone in the dust. But yeah, but no, it's, she Hasn't left everyone in the dust. She's sweet. That's Every time I see her. Like she's so fucking sweet. Yeah, we have a great time. But I opened my phone to text her And. I'm like, why can't I find her number? I was Like. I have Addison's number. We've texted before. She's in my phone as Addison Easterling because I met her as Addison Easterling her last Name. Her last name. Yeah. I forgot about that. She did just, I was like, Oh shit. I was like, God damn you were the back of Taylor Holder's car during Fireball. So Like, oh my God. I'm like enamored by her. Like, what was it, the recent award show where she wore the little white, the poof and she's smiling so much and she's just like, oh, at the VMAs she is just like, she has, she's in full Britney effect.


And so, oh, and She's on her knees on the carpet. I'm like, God, I love you so much. She, Everything. And then I, so even her performance at Madison Square Garden, her whole like set was insane. It was her like bending over, busting it open. Like I lifted around and bent over. And, I, Like I. Silly. So Britney, so, so many people were like that. Oh, that's not, and like trying to like hate on it. Really? That's not what, that's not what I can do. That's not Appropriate. Exactly. Like that's appropriate. That's all's not what I'm like sitting at home Also. Yeah, that's what, why you're not there. We were jumping. It's so easy to sit on your couch and criticize. But add Ray is at fucking Madison Square Garden also.


Literally. Literally. Madison Ray. I think it's Like. I. Just think it's fucking crazy. I garden, Most people struggle with the influencer to fucking worldwide. Pop star pipeline. And. I think every move she has made is so calculated and intelligent. Whether people realize it or not, neither you get it or you don't. And I just like fucking love her. Okay you guys, a dark stage is a union. What is it? A union. Listen, the union's about to come up in here, like the feds and raid us. Okay. It's like a union regulation basically. Like there's a certain amount of hours per day that nobody can be working on the stage. It's like, it's just like policy and, And y'all know I don't work well with policies.


And There's a huge fine if anybody sets foot on stage during the dark stage. And it is from four to 6:00 PM today. Okay, what time? And right now it's 3 56. So we are going to move this party to the green room. Yes. In layman's terms, We're getting the boop. hello and welcome and Welcome back to to this episode, episode, episode. We had to move due to union rules. Now we are in front of the meet and greet backdrop. I kind of wanna have someone from the meet and greet come be on the podcast for like 10 minutes. Like I. Think it would be so fun. I think so too, because we've never done that. But does that mean we don't get to go back downstairs? Oh wait, no, we have to do, you're right. Okay. I'm not sure about my outfit of the night. Like the, this is originally my, these were my Vegas show shorts.


Like the cheetah glitter shorts. I might have to change before the show. I get to go home before those shows. So I get to do a little one too of shopping. Ooh. Oh we, I'm so jealous. Yeah. I'm gonna have to go shopping at some point. Four suitcases. You're fucked. Tori just called these the vintage Charlotte roof shorts. Did you See That TikTok Honestly though with the meet And greet yesterday. This girl was wearing like really cute boots. And. We were like, where are those from? She's Like. Charlotte roofs. Charlotte's making a comeback. Mm I love To See. That But. Did you See That on TikTok? like this girl was like Yes, Like, Yeah Like. She was Like the little tiny ones. And. She was selling 'em for like a billion dollars. Yeah. Depop is crazy. Honestly I might get into it. like as things ever get go really south. It's crazy. That, we're like getting older.


And Like Charlotte Rus is now vintage. like I stole my first ever thong from There B. Wet seal, Charlotte roof No people post Vintage wet seal on Depop, find God What. like is it vintage to Like? The younger generation That. It is just crazy. What makes something vintage Like. How many years Yeah? How many years have to pass for something to be vintage? S definitely don't know. I mean Not in the winter of fact. Check Like, I, Like. Can we can We ask any of the old people In introduction? Like Mom I. Remember one time I stole a shirt from wet seal. And It had a fire extinguisher on It And. It said I put out And. My parents made me return It. Wait, Do you know That And? I was Like. This is so funny. Funny. While I stole it, My mom Fawn used to wear a shirt all the time.


It said I put out on the front. And. Then on the back it said fires. Okay, like it was from the fire department. But, she would like wear It to Like Like with everybody. She'd wear it. Like like to church. Yes. I was just Like. You can attest to this so hard. Like. It was so crazy. When my parents randomly woke up one day, And like had a rule. Like, you can't wear That. you know What. I mean Yeah. It's Like like It just made No sense because It's like there's No curfew. O like I'm seven. Like my parents would slut shame me. I'd d be like leaving the house. They're like, why are you wearing That? Top Yeah? I'm Like. Let me live. I'm 16 Yeah. O my grandma always wanted me to slay. She's Like. You look amazing. I mean mean like a tiny little skirt. Okay, this is such a random little thing.


But, because we're talking about Like clothes, And stuff. And slaying And. Our parents wanting us to slay back in Like second grade. you know those Converse That Like are just laceless, Yeah, And. They're just Like fray or whatever on them. Yeah I wanted them so bad 'cause I was just like O the here. Laceless I. Think they're so cute. And I went to school. And. Then my parents got me for them. 'cause the here Like, whatever makes em happy. the here they don't know whatever. They don't think they're gay. I go to school. Everyone's Like. There's You. Hesitating was funny. So okay, So gay. Everyone's going Gay. Know I mean Like. In second grade, I was bawling my eyes. I was Like. Take these. Converse back. Now Wait, did you know in second grade No O I didn't know until I started social media. Well. Maybe you should've known. You did. You really did not know you were gay until you started social media because That's when I started getting attention from guys, which I need more of.


Now, Great segue. I'm newly single And. Okay? So you know What, you're thinking because I did just hard launch with him. Like, this is What. It looks like. you know What's crazy though? A a lot. This is a lot of people. I'm not, I'm not even sure That. A lot of people know That. You And. Ty broke up No. They really No because, so I hard launched my relationship. And, we were together for five months before And. We were like talking exclusively pretty much for like six before Yeah, But, I. Just keep it off social media because that's just Like my preference. You guys have seen my past with relationships online. And. So No one knew That. Like. I was in a relationship. And I hard launched us. Finally. That's And. God. That's the worst.


It all this time shows looks. It's Like o. Two weeks later the post is archived. you know, you have 30 seconds also archived. I'm m like, why archived Me? Because you know it's coming. Holding on Hope. I always archived. 'cause you never know What, the future holds. You really do. Never know. But Yeah. I'm newly single. So I would say, if you want to take me on a date, But I. Don't think this is the right demographic to be taking me on dates. And being Like, No. No. We got gay here. Well, Yeah. But Like. Turbulent ones. I. Like. That's What. You need, you just need to Like. Have a little turbulent time. Little turbulent twin time. I. I tried That. And. We saw What happened. I mean at it.


Well. You Redownload Hinge. Okay, so I, Amari, Dude. It's Like. 4:00 AM last night the lights are off. He turns to me And. He goes, Hey, can I use your flashlight? I. Think he's Like looking for something. He takes my phone flashlight on his face. He's like Hinge scanning his face. Like trying to Like Like terrify. Okay, But, let me make one thing clear is because Like, obviously this is Like new And. I feel like It. It kind of looks like I'm just like over it. And, that's not the case. But, What. I will say Is he's like, please come back. No, No, No, No, What. I will say is like, I'm m like I'm looking for a boyfriend. like that's What. I want Like. I want a partner. you know, Yeah. So it's like, if you're not going to be That for me, then it's like I'm going to like find That.


you know Yeah. So it's not like I'm just like, o fuck That relationship I. Don't love him anymore. like that's the Case. Are you also ki kind of low key? This is something I would do. Are you on Hinge trying to See If your ex is already back on Hinge See. That's What. Can I tell you something? Psychoed, Do you wanna Yeah someone here? Yes. And. Then I have to laugh at an unfortunate moment in my life. Okay, Fine. I was trying Totalk one of my exes. And I knew That. He had just moved to a new city. So I changed my preferences to only his age. And. Then I paid $60 a month for Hinge to specify his ethnicity. So That I could only See people his ethnicity, And his age in his area within 20 miles. And. I found him almost immediately. And.


Then I realized just a couple, few or days ago when I was deleting Hinge That, I am still paying $60 a month for Hinge, which is Like. How Horny was I? I mean 60 A month for a Hinge when I was single. I paid $60 a month. The preferences they give you, they let You, like, they let you say Like. Like won't date anyone less than six five. Like, Yes, Like. You Could. It's to the point where you could Like like defer my Like dietary preferences. Like, it's so funny because Wait, What, huh? It's just worth every fucking penny. Like. You can be like I. Don't want a man who doesn't eat gluten. I'm so desperate. I have No parameters. It's Like age range. 25 to 60 plus. I've never been on one hinge date. And I was paying $60 a month for probably years.


That's so Crazy. I paid it last night. Fuck Dude. O my God. I will never, ever, ever forget I. I thought about this the other day. I'm Like. I will live with this anger for the rest of my fucking life. I dated a guy off of Hinge. My first ever hinge date turned immediately into a relationship. And I thought all Hinge was gonna be like That, right? like Yeah. After We ended up breaking up. like I realized Like That was such an anomaly. like everyone else is a murderer. But. Anyways, we break up, right? And, I, get back on Hinge or No. Brooke was on Hinge And. Brooke is swiping through And. She goes, isn't this your ex like And? It was Like my ex of like three weeks ago. And, he already had all new photos on Hinge. Like. And photos. I had taken Like.


I was o my God. I was so fucking mad. I was Like. When were you in a forest? Sorry, really quickly on Raya. I can talk freely about it now because they kicked me off. I used to check Mr. Big. 'cause every time Like, you're in a new location. If you log on, they'll update your location. Okay? So It would like say when he's somewhere he came to visit us on tour. And. I went to check his Raya. And. It said That. He was where we were. Like, Orlando, Florida. like he had logged into Raya laying next to me. O Kill O. Sorry, Can I just say though, it's crazy. That, you got, so Brooke got banned from Raya, right? You had violated some actual strikes in the past.


Like talking about Pete Davidson on Raya I. Understand why they were upset with That. Okay? You don't have to remind them. Okay? You don't need it. I don't need it. Now I literally taken It But. They banned her because she literally, on the podcast, all she said was I just got Aya notification. Just the words Ryan notification. And. I was, have we talked about this? I Don't know. I was talking about this with JP Sacks where he was Like. I. Feel Like. If I said That, they wouldn't ban me. And. It's like they wouldn't at Like at all. like it's But m like, you know, That feel Like. They were just Like. She's a liability. Like. They saw Cancelled. And. They were Like. This is it. I. Think It was Like a yearly thing. like they were waiting for the review period to just kick me off Like.


They were always gonna kick me off. you know, What, I mean because they do That. They do an annual review of every single person. And. They decide if you're still worthy or not. And, I think they hit Google one time. And. They said she is not worthy anymore. O fuck, I've never made it on. So I, just I cannot partake in this conversation because I would Like to keep my position. But. O My God. Wait. I have something fucking crazy to tell you guys. So my guy, I'm just gonna call him P Man now, because that's What. Everyone knows And. That. That's A crazy nickname. Like. You pee through someone's hands a couple times. And here. We are And. Here he is my P guy. So I had him over to my place. Like, right before We left for Tour Yeah. So he came to mind to pregame for Like, the McGee concert. And.


Little does he know my roommate had matched with him on Hinge when we first started talking. O fuck. So I had started talking to him. Like a a week in my roommate. Emily was like, O my God look like he just liked me on Hinge. I was Like. There's No fucking way. What a rascal. So I withhold this information, right? Until he's at my place. And, we're we're Pregaming for the concert. And. I. Go O I. Have a surprise for you. And. He is Like. What. Is it I? Knock on Emily's door. I go. Emily, come on out. They meet face to face. I go. Do you remember her? He's Like. Who the fuck And, I go. You match with her on Hinge Babe. Weeks after we started talking. That Is so hilarious. I wanna go Diabolical behavior. Diabolical crashing the fuck out.


I'm going, you guys No You her. I'm going, you guys wanna go to the concert together? I'm going, this is a great love story. Crashing the fuck out. That's incredible. That's actually incredible. I Never had any real success stories. Like I had a lot of guys. That I talked to from Raya. But, Like No one. Nothing That ever stuck. I met my ex-boyfriend on Hinge O I. mean I. Guess it's not A success. See h has better guys though. 'cause those are normal guys. Like Ray's. Like O I'm an actor, You know, all talk know I always trying to get on R For so long. I had Like Eight Friend passes added to my account. Yeah the here And Like. It was like O I was doing this stuff with MTV. like, 'cause you know how they're just so Like, eh? you know Yeah Yeah like, Nope, nope. They didn't want me. I'm Like Dirty Friend passes Yes.


Like 30. And I. Remember I was so livid because There was one time I was asking the fr the, our group chat for Like friend passes or whatever. Because the boy That I was talking to was also part of a friend group. And, he pissed me off. He proceeded to send me a friend, pass himself, A guy who fucked you over. Proceeded to then send you a friend past Uriah. Obviously DV is diabolical Est thing. Someone can do. Like. That is diabolical. I Would have to go Like. Lay in traffic. I think I cried. Should We talk about Chapon? Yeah? Absolutely. Okay.


Okay. Handing It to Paige. 'cause she's Like Midwest Princess. So when did this all start? Like. Here's What. I. Think I. Think Like. Like. You say, you always say this I. Think you said It today. Like I. Love watching a bitch without media training you did about Anna Vevey. And. A lot of it is really funny. Like just, you know, What. I mean And. I understand Like. 40% of the like when I don't feel this way. But. I'm just saying I can See how some people do where they're Like. I don't want to be bombarded in public by fans just because I'm putting music out. Like. I didn't sign up for this. Like, you know, What I mean people treating me as if they know me when I don't know you. And like I, Like, Doja Cat did That, right?


But, Doja Cat kind of did it. Right, right. Like, she said It once And, then she got back to her. Her version of media training. She meets fans when she wants to whatever, like chapel. Straight up Like I. Don't know I I. Just think action after action. It's starting to Like cussing out the photographer on the behind carpet. Wait, Zach confused me because, so did you watch the clip? Mm. He's saying Like shut the fuck up. Or something like And I. Think he was Like. He had to have been talking to like another photographer. 'cause why would he be telling her to shut the fuck up? She was silent. Yeah, But. Then she turns around And. She goes, Don't fucking Talk to me like That. And. It's Like. Dude. She's crashing out. Big time. But. I Mean I'm confused 'cause I'm Like Like. I really? Actually don't think he was talking to you. I love Chapon.


But like I do. I love her so much. But, it's Like, And, But, Like. All they are horrible. Everybody on the carpet. But. It's also overwhelming. And. Everybody's trying to get a photo. And. People are screaming over one another. Okay, But, where? Where is the point? This is What. I. Wanna say I fucking love Chap. I'm genuinely just asking out of curiosity. And, I've seen a lot of takes on this, okay? Where people are like, maybe she didn't want to be famous. She just wanted to make art, right? And. Like, she just wants to make art And live a normal life, okay? But. Then when you're going to the VMAs, And, you're walking those carpets. And, you're doing those things you're signing up for to be on a carpet of a bunch of people yelling, Like, you're signing up for rocketing into a new level of fame.


Like, if you really didn't want the fame, release the music. And. Just be like, you could Play like Lana Delrey, Like No one sees Lana Delrey anywhere. She's in a field getting married. Yeah That. That's just Like. She's That. Waffle House. And Obviously Yes Like. Some people just want to make Art And. Maybe my take is completely wrong, But. I'm just, I'm, I'm starting to get to the point where I'm Like. If you don't want this, you can't love the good things about it. And then hate the, you know, What. I mean, right? So then whatever she Cancelled the show Shows Like a day before she was supposed to do It. Which is so fucked because you have to think about Like a of the fans who not only Like live in the state, That are going But. That are traveling from out of state who have their flights, And, hotel rooms booked. And like have taken work off. Seriously. Like. That is so fucked to do.


So last minute, And just it be so flippant about It. Is She on tour or was it literally just 'cause I could understand like an artist saying, I need to prioritize my health if they're on like a long fucking tour. And. Like. Do you know What I mean Yeah? like, do you get What? I'm saying But. like if it was just a one off show That, you're Like promoting And, then you're Like. I need And. Honestly like I. Almost wish she lied. You literally took the words outta my mouth. like, forgive me for saying this. But like, just lie Like. Just PR wise. That's What it. Like. Just, just say you are sick. Maybe Like, because it's just Like saying I need to prioritize Like. What about prioritizing your fans. What about prioritizing your job. Yeah. Yeah. like, I'm fucking deathly ill right now.


But I wouldn't just be like, Like need to prioritize me. I signed up for this. you know, people traveled. Like, Yeah, You know I don't know. I love her a lot. But. I just feel Like. God. I want her to get used to it 'cause it's Like. I. Think it just What the, her major problem is That. It happened so quickly. If It was like a slow burn And, she kind of got like to dip her feet in the water. Yeah I feel like it would be a little bit different. But. She did not But. She also was try Like performing on the street, making music for years. And years. like you wanted the, you wanted What. You have the years But. It is a classic Case of And. You could also getting What. You want And then It's not What. You imagined, you know But, There's such a thing. Like. Charlie XX did this for Like. Literally ever. She was making, making art. She was making music. And. like you wouldn't like necessarily stop her on the street.


Mm. But she wrote every single song you can think of. Like, she was huge. Yeah, Yeah. So if it really is just about making art, make art quietly, she Did say, Hey, you just, just exactly. Like, don't tour And. Go to the award shows. And, set yourself up for the bad press. Potentially. Opportunities. Like. Just make the music. Put And, put it out. And. Then perform when you want to. That's Like. I. Guess that's where my Head's at I. Agree too. 'cause you said it was like a one off show. like it was Okay. I think It was like A festival. O okay. And. It's just Like, Like, What. You're saying about the tour thing. Shawn Mendes, the Cancelled, like a big portion of his tour. I had tickets to go But. It's Like. He put out a statement. And was like, O Like. I really need to prioritize my mental health. Like tours a lot. And stuff. And. It's like Sean I love you to death. Do What. You need to do Like.


know Yeah. You know And, I. Think It was just the last minute Like one off show. Yeah. And, this I. Think That. When you're in this beginning phase of your career, you're still And. Maybe she doesn't want the spot. So who am I to say this? But like earning your spot, creating diehard fans. Like, someone can love your music. But to have fans for Tiny, Earth a lot of times requires more than That. Your personality Or Yeah makes it makes me scared to be her fan. I feel like she won't even Like me. I. Think also to Like. Get this gassed out. That's early on into her career is crazy. Because granted, Like, she did have a very quick Like rise to fame. But also sh Like. She hasn't been doing like this for That Long.


Like as, as far as like being Like, an Alister Like in the spotlight. Yeah. She's been doing it behind the scenes for Like a long time. But Like to be in the spotlight for just a short amount of time. And already being crashing out. Like this Yeah I. Also think the combo of like I I fucking hate my fans. And. Then Like, I'm gonna perform this festival. It's Cancelled I gotta prioritize me. Like the the smack pack of those two Yeah Like. It's like choose a struggle. Also, I'm thinking about Like people. Like Bill Eilish, for example, who had Like And, I I. Think her beginning of her career was also Like. That, quick, pretty much And. She was like the most depressed, the most suicidal ever. And was the best to her fans. Yeah ever Well. Because Now Like, in the beginning of this time, Like is the time to really put your best foot forward.


And put in That fucking work. And. Commit to It. And I. Think she's Just, you can say like Like out And I. Don't like the Parasocial relationship. Don't come up To That. I. Get That Like. you know, What I mean people come up to me on the fucking streets. And. Like. Grab my tits. like I hate That. you know, What. I mean There are things That. There are boundaries. You can set And things. That. You can hate But in a, in a way, That doesn't make it seem Like. You just fucking hate this shit, Right? Yeah, Well, And. like for like Doja Cal. It's like she, she did It. And. Then like a year in was like, hey, like I'm all for artists setting boundaries. like I'm all for That. It's just, it's just really seeming Like. It's Like. She doesn't want this life. Yeah to me. Did You guys See That video of Anne Hathaway?


Where Like, there's like a bunch of fans. Like. She's Like getting outta a car. I think she's like going to Like some event. That's Stone fans. like That wanna Like meet her. Maybe she's leaving And stuff. And. She's Like. Okay. like hold on, hold on. like, just take a step back. Like, I'm gonna come to you. Like, Yeah, And. She's very calm. She's like Yeah. you know What. You're talking About Yeah. I was just Like, That, Like. If that's That seems Like What she needs to be doing. If that's how you, or even You know, I also get being just like, like I mean not mentally stable. Could also just be like, I don't wanna come to you. Like. I don't want to take photos. I mean, or like Like. Yeah. I'm so sorry. I. Don't want take a photo. Yeah, Like, I. Really just think it's like the delivery of it's, it's not really the sentiments, it's the delivery. And. It makes me Like wonder. I was gonna say though, like I joke around like I love a bitch without any like media training or any pr, da da da.


And I. Think for a minute. Like, that's What made her so likable was because she was relatable. And, like all of these people were looking at her Like o, she's just a normal girl. And. She got launched into fame. However, it does get to a point where it's like, when do you draw the line? And. Like. You do need That media training. And someone grab her fucking phone because this has been going on for like over a month now of like all these things like Cuating to Like. This actual I. mean Like. Fall of the Midwest. Princess But. I. mean Like. The Rise And fall. We're witnessing It right now. Yeah, But, I. Think Yeah It. There comes a time where it's like she needs someone to Like. Put out proper statements. And, take her fucking phone away. And. She can't just Like shit post. Go online. And like be crazy. And hectic.


Post What. She's saying And. Then Like not expect to have any backlash because of It. Like, right? Like she could also just double down like I I relate this to this to like Lil Wayne, right? like I'm a diehard low Wayne fan. And Like. I've shown up to six low Wayne shows where he bailed That minute. Like I. I was There in the crowd waiting And. Then it was like, actually he's not coming out on stage, right? But Lo Wayne has very much owned That. And. It's like That. It's a part of his brand. Like. Lil Wayne fans know if they're going to his show, he might not be going to his show. Maybe Yeah Chapel's. Maybe it's just Like. A lottery system. Like, Yeah. May, May like, There are artists. Like Kind of Like. She'll come if you're lucky. Yeah, Yeah, Like. There are artists who double down on all of it.


And, if she doubles down Honestly, That might be a fucking hardass move on her behalf too. Like. That's dope. I. Guess if That's Yeah. I. Think I. People love relatability until it becomes like too serious. And. It's like she's doing And saying things. That she would say to like her friends. And family. Like around a kitchen table. But instead of around a kitchen table. It's Like on a platform too. Millions, And, millions of people. And. Then It gets to That point where it's like, okay, No, No, No, Like, Yeah, But, I. Do love her. Her And professional I wanna See her win. know for sure me Too. But I mean a big fan. If it's really just mental health. I want her to get That together. 'cause That sucks. And, I, Like. Fuck. like Yeah But. I'm rooting for her. I mean me too. I. Hope she add her Shit together. Pinks so funny. Like like have a conversation. Like this And. Then end it. Like But. I'm rooting for her. But like We are Like We.


Genuinely are know But. I. Feel Like. She would hate me. And. It's sad 'cause I love her. And Also like if she did cancel this last show because she is Like on sewer slide, watch Like. That's really fucking sad. And Like. If she is canceling the show because like her mental health is rapidly declining, And Like at That point, then you know you have to like give her some grace for That too. Yeah, I, Agree, I. Think it's just Like. The don't book the shows. Don't do, don't do the VMAs. Carpets don't. If this isn't, if this isn't What, you Want overloading herself. Is She a Puppet though? Like. I was just about to say know I mean Like. People are are forcing her To do shit. Like, is she booking the shows? No? She is she booking the appearances? No, Yeah. Like. you know how That goes? I guess That is true. She's getting Like. But. Don't you feel Like? If she was a puppet, she'd be the type to be online.


Like. I was just a puppet. She probably Yeah. But. She probably can't say That. you know, But. She probably can't say a lot of the things. That, she feel Like. you know But, Like the stuff. That. She is saying there's probably No like clauses to she's just going on And, Like firing But. She probably can't talk about Like. Her management. And, Like, Yeah stuff. Like, That, But. Then that's where the confusion comes into me because it's like, wouldn't you think That? like if you just wanna be putting out art, And, all this stuff, And, you don't wanna be famous like you wouldn't be interested in having managers. And potential like events, And all this stuff. And like being thrown into like this stuff. Like I. That's What. I. Don't understand Yeah I. Guess just Like to end it. Like. We'll, See Like. We'll just, we'll, See, I'm rooting. I'm streaming Pink Pony Club forever.


Like I. We will See Knee deep. You know we don't wanna call it off. But, you don't want to call It love. Relatable as fuck. Cardi B is fucking done. And. I am so motherfucking here for it. Wait, Why? you know What Well? Have you not seen what's going on? No? She's going the fuck off on the internet in a crazy manner. But. It is very much giving Like. I have tried with this man. And tried with this man. And tried with this man. And, I am done. O And, obviously Like. He offset has cheated on her like openly their entire relationship for so many years. But, What, I. Love is when someone keeps something in their arsenal for so long.


And lets it out at exactly the right time. And, this is What. She did Paige. She finally, he threatened to like go online. And say like all the shit That, she did like all the trifling she was doing. And. She Goes, And, mind you, she was only ever trifling because he was trifling. So to me, PDOs cancels the fuck out. I said this last night, if a guy cheats on you, And, you cheat on him back. You did not cheat. That is PDOs. And. They cancel out. And, you Cannot Yes Convince me on the That. That has Nothing to do With like, like cross cancellation girl. My girl, What, What, What, PDOs has nothing to do with cross cancellation. Pedos is Like order, whatever. It doesn't even matter. So order Operations, order Of operations, it Doesn't matter. So No, so am I just saying cross cancel. Yeah, Yes, Cancelled.


Cross country. She Always Yeah. You've been used, brought a lot. We should have let her know sooner. Okay, But, this Is, this is the most important part of the situation. Okay? So he's threatening to say Like O, this is What you've been doing all along. Threatening to say it online. And. She goes online. She says, listen, I'll tell everyone myself. In fact, I did this, this, this And, this And. I was fucking take off while he was still alive. O I Didn't Know. That, And, I, And. She said, And. I. Miss it. And. I. Miss my nights with takeoff. Wait, And, And, he was Like. He comments in her comment section. Like, tell everybody how you were fucking when she, when you were pregnant, right? And, she goes on Twitter. And just tweets. And. I did And.


I did And. I did. Wait. What, the But. I. Think. I think it's like, that's awesome. like I feel like so many, even just Like girls in their normal life deal with Like, a shitty fucking guy trying to hold shit over their head. And gaslight them. And manipulate them. Even though the guy's the cheater, And the shitty one. Like taking That power back. And saying, bitch, I'll expose myself. You're still a piece of shit. Is Yeah And? She said, she's Like. Listen, you're a good dad. You're all right. But, you are. You've never been good enough for me. I've always been better than you. And. See. You later, have you been seeing this Shit? I've seen Like, some clips. But. I haven't known Like all the best. And. She just kind of on a whole tangent. Like, Like, I'm, I'm not gonna suck your ego. So you have to go fuck these Like other bitches.


Wow. Like. She was calling them lots of things. That. I. Don't think I should say But. Like, Honestly. So you have to go fuck these other bitches 'cause they'll gas you. And like I won't Like you. you know What. I mean And. She was Like. I. Don't regret my kids. Like kids Card's. A good wife. Have you seen her? like she's cooking, she's cleaning. She's like, she's the best mom. I love her. And, I Cook. And, I. Clean. O my God. Honestly, go off Cardi. That's insane. I didn't know any of That. Yeah, And, I feel I really do feel like she's gonna pop out in a new relationship. That is gonna fucking gag everyone like I. I wanna See Cardi be with like Liam Hemsworth? Bad example. But. I mean, or just like I. Don't even. Who's Like? A great guy Like a Tom Holland type.


But. Like. Not Tom Holland. Dave Chappelle, Like. Just someone that's Like so different from him. And. Like won't fuck on her. Dave Chappelle might be married. I'm just saying Like, And. But. All Yeah. He is married. And, also I. Don't think Like. We're thinking good. Well. I. Love. Dave. Dave, Chappelle, But, I. Someone would treat her right. And is successful in Like. A a different realm. Like. Like card And. Jeff Bezos. Yeah. I mean Like. Cardi being And. Zac Efron babe. I was gonna say like Michael, Sarah. That's just your dream man as hell. Yeah I. Get It. I do understand Michael, Sarah's everything. Damn Yeah Or an alligator hunter like Lana Honestly. God, she's so I, That. Maybe behind. Need an alligator Hunter.

Mama knows best sloshing Through marshland Like Dish Land, tour guide. O, my God, Let me call him I, wanted to talk about Vincent And. Sam on TikTok. But I. Don't know if anyone else is a Vincent.
