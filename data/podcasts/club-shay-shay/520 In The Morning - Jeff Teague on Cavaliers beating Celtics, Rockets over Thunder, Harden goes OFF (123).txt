The Volume. Good morning, happy Monday. It's five 20 In The Morning. It feels good to be back in the studio, man. Had a couple days off of the gate vacation, but we back with y'all to give y everything y'all need in the sports world, especially basketball. I'm your host. My name is DJ Wells. Joined this morning by my two esteemed cohost of my left The Bday boy. My brother Bishop Hendricks. How you doing this morning, brother? Cooling bro. I'm revived baby. Let's work. Let's work now. Listen, we didn't know what was gonna happen man. The the Hendrick experience was last night. We thought my boy was gonna use his PTO day. Nah, hell nah. I gotta work still bro. I got a job to do my boys. We went up last night though, for sure. For sure until I Right my brother Tig. How y'all doing this morning? Man? I'm chilling bro. You know what it is.


Let's get to it. Nasty. I'm, I'm vibed out this dude. It's crazy. Lawsuits still all the way. Listen man, a lot of sports happened this weekend, but we gonna keep it basketball this morning man. We had some great matchups yesterday. Number one verse number two in the east. Took off yesterday. Now mission went crazy in the fourth yesterday as the Cal took care of the Celtics. One 15 to one 11. Listen man, that was a great game yesterday, man. Donvan Mitchell showing why he deserves to be in the a VP conversation. Aw man. He's being, he's on a run right now. Yeah, the only kryptonite right now is the Hawks. My Hawks. But Donvan Mitchell man, he playing at a all time high right now. What he did last night, he kind of showed that he's here.


All NB all starts started for sure. Yes sir. Playing like a first team all NBA player. I'm excited to see how far the Cavs can go for sure man. Listen, he had 35 yesterday, 20 in the fourth seven rebounds as well. DARS Garland showed up yesterday. Last time they played the Celtics, you know he laid the stinker but 22 and eight he was back on track. No JB yesterday but JT held it down for him yesterday. He had 33 and eight and Ingas man 21 to eight. It's crazy that this game was that close without jb Yeah that's, that's the big red flag right there. Like it was a close a dog fight all the way through. But like we talk about the Celtics, they got so many players they can be all stars at any given moment. Yeah. Without JB you got a close battle like this. JB obviously a all NBA kind player.


That's the difference between the Celtics and the Cavs. I mean JB out, you still got a dog fight. They got JB a probably a blowout win for the Celtics. Yeah, that's the crazy part about it. And you were, you were talking about this before. I seen a lot of people said about that six man a year for Peyton Prichard. Yeah he been balling. Oh man, he been ball as well. Hang that up. That's his, yeah, for sure. I think the dope thing about the Cavaliers though, for you to have a closer in Donvan Mitchell and it seems like obviously we know he can get to it but he's been doing it in the fourth. He's doing a situation where winning matters. I think to have a player like that, getting that mode at this time of the season going forward, it's gonna be ugly man. Because like you said, maybe it don't match up with the Celtics but who really does? Other than that I, I don't feel confident in Donvan Mitchell giving me a dub in the fourth quarter.


Yeah, so far I think he, like y'all said, I think Jeff said it, he might be the best two guard in the league right now. Mm. He balling, he going, he going crazy right now for sure. My only fear with the Cavs is they one injury away from being a seed. True. That's a fact. They need everybody. They need the whole squad. Like if they don't got the squad it's over with. So I pray that they stay healthy 'cause if Donovan Mitchell or Darius Garland go out, they going to drop immediately and listen man, I've been looking at some teams in the east that could use a little bit of help on the Wing, but we'll talk about how terrible the wishes are later. But a Kyle Cosman type player could go to the Cavs and help solidify some stuff for them. I'm not saying he gets them over the hump but another player like that who give him another strong defensive win and able minor shooter and score.


I'd get 'em there Man. I don't know if they could beat the Celtics but like you said that'd help with the death 'cause that team everybody gotta play perfect and not get hurt. I mean they still got Kara Vert six man. For sure. Yeah, they still got capable players. I mean all buddies having an all time year right now. My favorite backup point guard besides Pippen Pippen, what's his name? Ty Jerome. Oh yeah, your boys. He's playing great but they need a solidified score. I wouldn't say it'll be Kyle Coman. I mean he could, but he had, he had to come off the bench. Yeah. And I don't know if K is ready for that. I mean I know he did it in LA and whatever, but I don't know if he's right there in his career to be like yeah I'm coming off the bench.


Yeah. I I think he'll, he'll be nothing on that. They need like Jordan Clarkson or somebody. That's somebody that comfortable with being a solidified role player. Mm Kma still want to be the star damn near on the team. Yeah. I don't see him coming off the bench at all. Damn. That's interesting. You, you think he would have to go to a role where he would start? 'cause I mean I I'm just looking, we ain't gonna talk too much about the Wizards but like a player like him could go to another team and probably contribute on the championship level. You don't think he'd be like, all right well y already got a role and I'll come in do my thing. I mean I imagine he could probably beat out, beat out Isaac Curl for a job if it came to that point. But it is that chemistry though. I got you. You don't wanna alter it. Yeah Isaac, they playing great. Like why would you ever Yeah don't fuck the vibe. Don't fuck up the vibes.


Not for cos nah no Disrespected cos but nah I'm not messing up the vibes for cos Uhuh for show for the show Man listen man Celtics, we talk enough about that team. They just go ahead they, they can't win 'em all. They ain't gonna go 82 1. Oh man that's, that is scary though for them to be that close without they dog too. Come on. Andy White didn't play shit. They don't they good man. Oh shit. Like that's what I'm saying. Like they, they are man we ain't worried about the Celtics. They lose a couple games. Still the number one team to me like yeah they're still the team to be, everybody's chasing them at this point For sure. To still be that good of a team when you got two of your key players out. Come on bro. Says a lot about that organization. They know how to build a squad.


Not for sure but I mean they got, they they took a chance with the money. They ain't care. Yeah a lot of teams care. A big gamble ran up too. Golden State when they went on they run they didn't care. They paid whatever the tax was. Boston right now they don't care. I think we in that era like I said I think they in they in that Golden State era, I think they got a chance to win three in a row. I'm rolling. They they are look like to be what could be the next dying scene in the NBA For sure. I can see 'em going back to back this year for sure. Most definitely speaking to paying that money. The man that they said they shouldn't have paid their money to for Air Van Fleet went crazy yesterday. Number one verse number two in the west. Man Rocket secure. I told y'all the Rockets man be hint to not believing in them man.


I, I'm sleep good young team though. I'm, I'm just asleep. I'm just asleep on the rocket. I like the rockets man. I love Houston but I'm asleep on the rockets. I just like the way real they play. I told y'all Dylan Brooks man for some reason nobody likes him. I like Dylan Brooks. He just brings that energy to a group like a a young group. He like make you believe like he don't give a damn and last night you know him and SGA actually cool yeah for him to get the scuffle going for SGA over the ball that just bring a different kind of energy to a team. Yeah for sure. Like you said it, it may not always show up in the stats but the energy and the swag that he brings to a team is definitely undeniable. Listen man, close game yesterday 1 19, 1 16.


You know what I'm saying bro? Love Dylan Brooks on the squad. Yeah You need one of hell yeah he's that person that you hate playing against but love to having your squad bro. Yeah like he like how can I say I ain't gonna say he better than Pat Bev, they remind me of the same person but he bigger, he more effective than Pat Bev like 'cause he actually 6 7 6 8. Yeah so he actually can like really bother people. Pat Bev bother guards and stuff like that but he actually like kind of get under like a SGA skin even though SGA kills. Yeah but you could see it like you got a throwback comparison like somebody from the nineties that Dylan Brooks remind you of. I was just trying to think of who I could. Anthony Mason, I don. I got a story to tell the real end man.


I'm just saying like nah dog like that. Yeah because you know like it is different. No shade to Pat Bev, I love Pat but Pat a point guard so for him to be effective as defensively and whatever, but you need your point guard still get buckets in this league. Yeah. Get buckets average 20 and 10, blah blah blah. He don't really gotta do that as a wing. 'cause you got scoring guards. He got, he had Ja Marin, I got Fred Van Fleet and they got Jalen Green. Yeah he's straight, he got Desmond Bang. So like his role is to be that but as a point guard you kind of gotta run the show. Even though when he was with the Rockets, James Harden did all the point guard, guard duties but they're very similar.


I just think his role fits a little better for sure man. That makes a lot of sense. For real. And the crazy part about the whole team, like with Dylan Brooks, like you said, you could feel the void he left when he left Memphis. Now he with this team the energy, the way they compete On top of that. Listen man in a, you saw what he did with the Celtics man I told you. And he's already building early. I know it's early in the season but he got a tattoo team in the west off two years. Hey Mark Jackson, bro. Boston? No I love Joe. Joe was my guy when I was in Boston. Yeah. Joe Steve Kerr. Mm. He built that team got him where they needed to be. They added a new piece Joe, get over the hump. I see what I'm saying. I see what you're saying. So now he goes somewhere else.


He building up this Houston team. Hopefully, hopefully everything goes smooth over there. I I wish them well bro. Yeah I know they just, I'm I know they out there. They out there. Well so tread light little different than the first of all in May just it's a better match. Yeah. You got a better field to play here bro. The open gym, you just single now so it don't even matter. Yeah the open gym out there tap in with me. It hit the deal. The real proms got a few places that you could attend my boy. But he definitely know how to build a team man. He get people to believe like I was against him sending like, ah, what's my guy name that went to Villanova over there that doesn't get, he can get to play on anymore.


And Ken Whitmore. There you go. I I was like confused that he wasn't playing 'cause I think he's a star but shit I guess he know what he doing. Yeah. And yeah everybody was just like, you know they gave him high praise like looking For more m but he like, nah I got this. Yeah. Like and how can you go against it now You can't bro, they didn't dream of being two in the in the west earlier at any point in the season. Probably them making the playoffs with them was probably a great year so far. But they ended position to be good. SGA still went crazy. 3 2 1 8. He's going crazy. Jalen Williams man 22 5 Isaiah Stein man playing great. 19 and 13. Do you agree with Ken Kendrick Perkins? So he said he's the top 10 center in the NBA? Yeah. Yeah because that's, he double double position spooky anyway though.


So he might fuck around and be higher though. Yeah, at this point honestly so far it's his value. Like his value is them there screaming top five at the center position. I mean he played great for the Knicks last year. He playing great for them now. He definitely top 10 for sure. All right, I gotta shout this question. One and two outside of SGA, who's a Allstar from where these two teams? Somebody gotta make up. We feel like Jaylen Williams is supposed to be Allstar. I'm gonna let y'all cook man. Y'all know how I feel about this multiple Allstar shit. You don't feel like sunken should be one for the rockets? I'm saying we go from either team as well. No. Yeah. Okay. He should 18 and 18 and 10 is number two. Number killing 18 and ten five And the two CI mean if they stay top three, the top, what is Jalen Green averaging?


Let's see, I think Jalen Green is probably in the mid twenties. We gotta go to his stats. That'd be lit if he make the Allstar team. Oh I mean 19 I'll probably have to give it to Sagon. Yeah especially with the Garner West. Yeah especially the Gardner West. If he can give his up to like 22. 'cause Jalen Williams is averaging 22. If he can get to 22 and they number two in the west, I'll give it to Jalen Green. But Sagon right now is yeah I'm gonna go with it. Yeah, that's tough. 22 6 or five. Yeah he's Jaylen Williams. Yeah he deserve it. Y'all Allstar bro. For sure man. Shout out to the young boys killing it for sure. James Harden went crazy vintage 39 man he on a little tear. Yeah he been looking like, you know what I'm saying?


Days of James hard to pass took care of yo yesterday. Hey he still got it in the tank bro. It's still there. 39, 11 and nine. Damn near Triple D bro. Yeah he big age bro. He's still cooking bro. Yeah he he different. Yeah him and Justin. I'm not even gonna talk about him. I'm him with Justin to those players. Like he had a sacrifice for Paul and Kauai, you feel me? Fell into that role. Dumbed down in Sta we like shit we back in Houston back in H Down. Yeah to LA Times of LA we back home with Yeah that's running track your but that's also like Paul George. I know we give Paul George shit on the show but I feel like he needs to be James Harden bro.


James Harden dumb down his road for y'all but when we need him he coming out and killing bro. Some people don't got that capability. And I'll say this, see how I feel about it. I don't feel like that Paul George was ever a better player than James Harden. No, no I'm just saying no question. I don't think he get able to. No hell no he not talent wise, I just don't think that he could ever facilitate a game the way that James Harden does. Yeah that's not, I think that's the difference. Like they put all the players around him. Likewise it was in Houston with this team and you got great coaching with Lou. It's like yeah bro we put PG in this position, they wouldn't be in the same boat. Nah for sure 'cause they two different players. I'm just saying when it's time to take over, whatever you do as a player, Paul George turn it up when we need you the most, you can't be a role player when we down three or four players.


That's all I'm saying this turn it up a notch. Yeah Facts. Last year when they went out he started Cook, he started cooking. The thing about James Hart, he's a point guard. So I always tell all players you want to have the ability to play point guard. Even if you are a great scorer, you wanna have the ability to play point guard 'cause you can control the game. So that's what makes Draymond Green special. 'cause he can basically play point guard. Yeah. So he got the ability to control the game offensively and defensively. But James Harden can do the same thing offensively. He can control the game 'cause he can play point guard when you just a bonafide scorer two guard and you can't control the game. That's Paul George. He can have moments where he's great in a game. Yeah.


But to control it, putting people in places to make everybody successful. That's why James Hart can play with under man teams and look great. Yeah, for sure. Man listen man, he made history. Only him and Steph. Two players everywhere. 3000 make threes bro. That's crazy. Nah damn.

In the aftermath of a transformative election like the one we just had is hard to read the news without asking yourself every five seconds. How did we get here? That's exactly what we're always trying to figure out on Fiasco. A history podcast from the co-creators of Slow Burn. In our first season Bush v Gore, we examined an unmistakable turning point in American politics. The 2000 election, which came down to a recount in Florida and ended with one of the most controversial rulings in Supreme Court history. In many ways it's the beginning of the story we're living through right now. So if you're trying to make sense at the present moment, check out fiasco Bush v Gore and find out how a statistical tie in the Florida vote count. Put the nation into an unprecedented holding pattern during which American voters waited with bated breath to find out whether Al Gore or George W. Bush would be the next president of the United States. Listen on the iHeartRadio app, apple Podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts.

My guy D Ross, I watched that nigga put look in the rim and dunk on a nigga. Yeah. What's his name? Drag it or drag it with two. Yeah. Filthy. But Ja, he, he's a freak athlete too. I mean the thing about the difference between them two is like when you see D Rose the way he was built. Yeah it was like all right that's a like a running back. Josh Slim like he's super skinny. He dumb athletic but I, he rose was crazy Now that's different bro. Yeah but his damn man, he like fly like a, like a YouTube person.


Nah, straight up like when you, you don't expect that from him And like when he jump it's like what the fuck? And to me I think it's like he'll jump but then he'll cock the ball back so far it's like bro that's crazy bro. You could just fly like that for sure. Yeah. Special. Nah for sure. Darren Jackson JR man DPOI candidate. How y'all feel about that? Yeah, he be holding it down. I mean gotta share with Ja man. That's the only reason he getting that. I've never seen seriously bro I've never seen somebody knee. They nigga that bad bro. Bro. He only, he, he definitely only plays well when just for real bro, because Desmond Bain's still the producer, you know what I'm saying? He going through a little slump right now. But usually Desmond man is still produce regardless. But yeah he's a totally different player bro.


He's crazy bro. He needs, he needs Ja, he needs Ja to deal the Josh stimulus is real. Marcus Marcus my boy Marcus is back. Marcus smart. Yeah he been playing well for them too. He gives him that Dylan Brooks kind of energy. A little different player. Who better Dylan Brooks or Marcus Smart. Yeah. Yep. Today I say Marcus Smart two years. I mean Dylan Brooks two years ago. I'll say Marcus Smart. Yeah I think Marcus Smart was better in Boston. But for this role I think Dylan Brooks a better player than Marcus Smart for this role. Okay Marcus smart point guard and he playing with Ja Morant who's a point guard. It's a little different role like yeah.


How tall is Marcus? Smart? Like six four? Yeah. Okay. 6 3, 6 4. So it's a different role. I mean but he fit the way that they play so perfectly. Like you said like he'll get after it. He gonna full court pressure. You know what I'm, he gonna get grimy with it. I like him for that team. I think he's definitely with that need. They still need a wing to me to compete in the West. But I like the way the team is built bro. Especially when Ja healthy everybody game slot is on the way up. Yeah. Ja that's crazy that they play like that. It is like me on 2K when I'm on the team we, it's like a guaranteed win. You on mouth. Yeah you when I'm not on the team mouth struggle. Mm. You know what I mean? He can't carry the team but when I'm out there like damn when I'm there it's like everything's better I don Triple J. Yeah. Yeah.


Dang he Jerry Jackson Jr. Without me bro. I'm the job Miranda our team man. But the thing is I play Dylan Brooks position so I don't even know how this works. Damn Keenan. See Marcus smart Mark Keenan? Yeah. You know what Keenan, he's effective as long as Bird ain't playing with us. Mm. Shout out to Bird but if Bird and Keenan on the same team, we probably gonna lose the 2K. Damn. The 2K chemistry is hilarious because they both, they similar players. They both shoot threes and cut and then they be cutting at the same time and Mel quit then we got called with then it just get crazy. Oh since we on 2K is this somebody that you know, y'all can shout 'em up if y'all want to.


Is this somebody that y'all haven't beaten that plays 2K that y'all know is like super cold? Like who The coldest nigga on 2K The super, I played a couple YouTubers but I don't remember but the game, we had a real good game against the game. I think they beat us by one. Right Milk? Yeah, he hit like a hook shot or some bullshit. Oh. So he called at the game. I don't even know if that's him playing. Oh okay. But they playing on his account. I'm questioning if that's him. I don't wanna know if that's him out when we Ling. No, we got in the chat. He like yeah get your team nigga. You know how he talk. I'm like it might be him but I don't know if he he'd be on that motherfucker all day. Whoever it is, they don't lead the game. That's like I get on, we go on there right now bro.


I guarantee you he on there having a ghost ride for 2K is crazy. I hope that's him though. But he was also, I remember him being really, really cold at Madden too. So he he might just be like that might be gonna do some investigations for sure be but he be on there though for sure The Pacers. It is what it is also. Hey, oh my God.

Really good game yesterday. RJ Berryman kill it. I gotta put some respect on RJ. 37 to seven bro. Hey he's having a hell of a bounce back year man. Yeah, yeah they put a lot of small his name leaving New York last year. I mean him playing back at home. I know they don't get a lot of attention but I think that's what he needed and he's starting to become a player that we thought about when he was at Duke for sure. Yeah. I hype for him and you know I'm saying he dealt with some crazy loss this year. Lost a sibling so shout to him bouncing back, you know having a wherewith without to even get to it like that For sure. Oh for sure, for sure.


They've been talking about the heat all years. Most insistent player. Tyler Hero 31 yesterday. You said it keep him in South Beach White boy my favorite white boy bro. Go where you celebrated bro. Not where you tolerated bro. He celebrated out there I. Don't know man. Told y'all man let my boy go man. Pat Riley said ain't nobody celebrated here bro. If you don't got no banners, watch your mouth. That's how he feel. That's how he talk. For sure. Now I respect it though. And Pat can say that though. He, he talk about that to Jimmy and I think that's crazy but he like bro I, nah it's real talk though. But y'all think Jimmy should leave though before Pat for sure get the statue. Oh for sure. No they already said it. Send Pat before send Pat. I mean not Pat, Jimmy send Jimmy away. Oh yeah Jimmy about to be gone.


Yeah, Jimmy gotta go Jimmy, Jimmy. Yeah he gonna be leaving to where though? Where would y'all, where would y'all put him? Let's Wild Out. Send him to Cleveland. Wow. Now we went championship. No they lit. Yeah I ain't mad at that. They lit. We winning that chick. You got another closer with Don. Another capable defender. Somebody else who ain't scared to guard either one of 'em. Most importantly as far as being able to as well. That'll put them in win mode. I don I. don I don't like it though because the chemistry, he might rock the bowler because he, he play hard. But I like Donvan Mitchell being the leader of that group for sure. And I think Cam Johnson, he kind of, he low, you know, he low maintenance, mild mannered, low maintenance is a good word to use in this situation.


Jimmy gonna come in there with a blowout and they gonna be like, all right bro, they'll be good. He, they gonna have some. Yeah, but who you gonna put the ball? Who hand who you want the ball to have in the fourth quarter? Who? Well who you want to have the ball in the fourth quarter? Jimmy or Donovan Mitchell And it's like, mm, Jimmy's a great closer. We know that Donovan Mitchell's growing to be a great closer so you might have that little controversy like yeah you don't know if Jimmy Ray to sacrifice yet. Yeah, because Jimmy ain't gonna walk in there and be like this, this N team. Mm, not yet. I mean he real though 'cause I seen him do it with Minnesota. Like he was like this is Cat team. It didn't work out long. But how many games last he said it. He said it. He did it with Philly.


If Kat was a dog to him to Jimmy, he would've. Yeah he did. He did it in Philly with Joelle. So, but I wonder if he got that respect. 'cause you know they wanted to get Donvan Mitchell in Miami so maybe if he got that type of respect it could probably work out. He probably, they probably like each other. We don't even know him off the court. They probably cool. Sure, yeah. Might work. I don't know. I just think as far for Donvan Mitchell, he beat in conversation now 'cause I know that he got a lot of S money in Utah for that. But shout to Don. Hey, seen your shoes brother. You supposed to sing. Oh yeah, yeah. Allstar. It's new. Allstar the way brother. Yeah you supposed to. You Delin brother. We supposed, we've been waiting for the last dance. I like these new ones. All right. We can't even put that on Jr. We're gonna do it anyway.

In the aftermath of a transformative election like the one we just had is hard to read the news without asking yourself every five seconds. How did we get here? That's exactly what we're always trying to figure out on Fiasco. A history podcast from the co-creators of Slow Burn. In our first season Bush v Gore, we examined an unmistakable turning point in American politics. The 2000 election, which came down to a recount in Florida and ended with one of the most controversial rulings in Supreme Court history. In many ways it's the beginning of the story we're living through right now. So if you're trying to make sense at the present moment, check out fiasco Bush v Gore and find out how a statistical tie in the Florida vote count. Put the nation into an unprecedented holding pattern during which American voters waited with bated breath to find out whether Al Gore or George W. Bush would be the next president of the United States. Listen on the iHeartRadio app, apple Podcasts, or wherever you listen to podcasts.


Lakers took care of the jazz yesterday, 1 0 5 and 1 0 4. Did y'all see the end of that game yesterday? Nah. What happened, man? Basically College six was in a position, you know what I'm saying? Go ahead, bucket time and Will Hardy caught the time out the head coach of the Jazz? Mm, about one second, 1.4 left and they were just like, why would you do that? Basically young, you know, young coach made a mistake. It's all good. I've done that a couple times my second year. You make mistakes. Yeah. That's what happened to that game. 'cause it was a close game. Obviously says it's more about the Lakers than does jazz to be in a competing situation with them. But ad 33 11, LeBron 27 to 14. LeBron is getting stats but he has looks like old man, LeBron man and nobody wants to say it unfortunately.


I mean shit. What he 40? Yeah. Shit. I don't know. I only been carrying the league since I was 18. Like right. I 22 9 22 8. What's that? 8 9 2 18 To see LeBron only averaging 22 is crazy. But LeBron's, I don't know what he was about. Myself and dads are fire as far, what's crazy? He's high five in the, I believe too. Hey, what's crazy? I would've averaged 22 any year in my life. I would've told you, y'all nigga. I was that nigga. The fact that we're disappointing LeBron, like this is a Now here 22. That's crazy bro. That lets you know how great of a player he is. They're still doing that bro. I, I don't even see him getting old. I don't even look at it as old man buckets. It's like why can't y'all still guard this nigga? They still going for the fake up hardest move with basketball.


Nah, that's a fact. That's what I'm saying. It's kinda wicked seeing him average that it's, it just be weird seeing LeBron do a regular dunks now. 22 8 9. Like yeah, when his like head don't really get to the rim bull. Yeah bro. Man, it's like he dunking with all arm now. Yeah, that was nuts. My head is always at that. You said th highest but yeah, like LeBron do a more dunking with the arm now he be, he be, I got, I got dunking he rim grazing a little bit. Damn. And people be feeling like they can contest like Bradley building a block on LeBron boy in 2002 of you would. Would've never. He the windmill on that end, but damn. That's crazy though. His dunk package is definitely down the, yeah, he got the GT dunk package down.


Oh that's tough. Oh shit man. Like it you will man. Ma took care of the blades yesterday. 1 37 to 1 31 8 of the last nine. Man MAs been going crazy. Luca returned but they've been winning without him. But he showed why he was needed 36 and 13 yesterday to return. Getting 36 is crazy. Something slight off the pond. A 36 is nuts. Mm. Walking the park situation. Listen man Blazers, they competed yesterday and Anthony Simons had so many thousand in the first half. Yesterday was crazy, but he dropped 24. If his 27 or third quarter yesterday he was cooking that boy. Hey we watched him. Yeah. We know that boy can shoot that ball. He's special. For sure. Free that man. Man. He he'll be another good trade candidate. Like he'd be good in Milwaukee.


He'd be good in some of these teams that needs somebody off the bench that can get buckets. He'll be a bonafide scorer. He one of those guys for sure man. Like you said, you don't gotta do much for him. Just get out the way. Let him cook. Yeah. Quentin Grant, Quentin Grime, excuse me, had a great two last games. He took care of the revenge game against Knicks. He had 28 last night against the Blazers. Man, listen, like you talked about the team was constructed to help Luca. The role players been stepping up like they supposed to even he was out helping Kyrie. Yeah. If they can keep playing like this, we ain't say Clay Dam in a minute. Obviously we know what's going on with that. But yeah, if they can figure that out and keep attributing like that, they gonna be a problem in the west again. What's the best part of Luca's offensive game? His, his ability to create space. Mm. Like he know how to create space. He know how to use his body so well.


So he can always get to his step back 'cause he can create space but then when he drives he know how to use his body to create enough space where he can get any kind of shot off. Yeah. Like he's so slow and people still can't figure out figure like how does he score, how does he get by? He know how to use his body so well create space and make contact at the realm. He a great finisher ball but like he just got a overall game that's special and it's all based off him being able to create, create space and pauses. He big as hell like that makes it even worse. So he got all that. He know how to use his tempo. Like you said use his body wheel bro. You can't guard that. I was started, Nick when his rookie year he was starting at the point of Wesley John Wesley Matthews was at the two I think.


But somehow I started the game off on him but Game starts. I said what the fuck? He went straight to the block. I'm like nah this ain't gonna work. Dro switched. I was like Dro, I got him, I got me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gonna take that. He went to the Post on him. You was like hey man somebody else gotta guard him man. I was like what the fuck? Damn, he too big bro. That's crazy man. But yeah Mask doing it like they supposed to Spurs security. The Kings yesterday 1 27, 1 25. A lot of close games yesterday. Man. Weby trippy Dub 34. This shit, he starting to, he's starting to round on his, he's starting to figure it out again. The 11 assist part is what stood out for me. Obviously I ain't numb till you getting 34 and 11 but 11 assists as of big.


Yeah bro. He's starting to figure it out. We gotta, we gotta, I gotta call my kings guys man. I don't know what's going on man. Especially getting 11 sis on that team. That's a hell of a game. What? Trying to say it's po. That's the mad ass over there. No, don't do 'em bad. For real bro. Yeah, they develop it for sure. Yeah. Alright man. A couple games. Nice. See how y'all feeling. Heat at Celtics. Where y'all going? Damn that's a good game. Heat. Heat at Celtic? Yeah, heat going with the heat. Okay. My hawk been playing better too. What we in the what we in the east right now. Why 11? Yeah I got, I got the Celtic, I got JT with a big game. It bouncing back. He killed yesterday too. We didn't even talk about it.


Slide 33 Pelicans ad Hawks. Woo. We eat seven seed in the east right now man. Hey the east is the east is spook. I told y'all I hate the east. You are a three game wind streak for being out of the playoffs to the top seed. It's kind of crazy. That is wild. Like man we, we know we playing well right now. Jalen Johnson doing, we do Trey's starting to, he still always plays great. I mean his stats always great but he, they starting round him to a cool team man. Jalon Johnson should be an all star. He probably won't make it this year. Yeah but he deserves to be all he does. He's getting the numbers for sure. He hooping. So you taking the Hawks in this game? For sure I got him too. Pelican Square 85 points. Yeah I got the Hawks. Yeah. And they went out last night. Mm damn I got that Deonte Murray and my damn parlay.


He is. Oh he about to go crazy though. He playing haw revenge game. He probably, yeah I got him hot tonight. Net nets at Bulls. Nets. Nets. Talking nets. Lakers at Timber Wolves. Hmm. Let's talk about them Timber wolves. If we had a chance to talk about them T Wolves or me what we got today. Has he ever say hey y'all wanna know why we suck? I'll tell you. Yeah. Hey he was wilder. I told y'all though that locker room though. I figured that's what it was. I figured lot stuff in basketball. Yeah he don't, he Miss Kat bro. He misses dog. The vibes is different. I know because Kat allowed him to be him. They all knew each other.


They all had years together. You know they that first year Kat was, I mean an came they was sad so they grew together. They all knew. Got comfortable with one another. Everybody let an be the man. Yeah it is different Jr come over there and shit. Talk about it. We the man too now. I ain't, I'm trying to solidify myself around here too. Yeah. And Dante you know he ain't happy at all. I don't, I ain't talked to him but just from the way he been playing the way it look he ain't wanna leave New York. Yeah. So basically we need to go ahead and you know what I'm saying? Look some other trade options 'cause I don't think they wanna take this year as a wash and you can't have your star disgruntled when your stars talking. Like that changes gotta get made.


I don't know how soon but something gotta change. Yeah, Mike probably frustrated too. Losing Kyle Anderson hurt them too. Yeah, yeah for sure. He was in the locker room guy and another good player for them. Him and Nas was a really, really good Yeah, really front court to have for sure. Yeah. Bust them up bro. Pause like get to start over man. Yeah that's kind of tough to go a western conference, finals trip to, you know what I'm saying? Making some would say almost an ill box trades and now it's like all right now those trade pieces that I got, I can't even move nowhere else 'cause you gotta go out, you gotta thug it out the rest of the year. Oh yeah they hopefully they catch a stride for sure. But I'm saying they probably gonna catch a little momentum I think Jr. I don't think Julius Randall and Anthony Davis solve the problem.


I think they probably cool. They just probably don't play well together but I think they probably cool off the court. Yeah. Oh yeah for sure. It's like all the other pieces I think so. Listen man five buckets beat he who was getting to it yesterday Gotta give it to old school man. I call him Jimmy Hardin man. He 39 11. That's a crazy name. Jimmy Hardt. Yeah, that's why I call him Man Jimmy hard in bro. Oh my fault bro. Damn I didn't, I didn't hear that hard. I was say that. That's a yeah interesting name. Hey and hold on just you know shout out to the verified bucket. You know we love that segment of the show but have a something I wanna say.

I don't, I'm not too sure if this is true or not but I did believe that he did it up passing away. Unfortunately I hope days later but they put that report out.


Please fact check me on this. I'm not a hundred percent correct. I don't wanna put no death on nobody who ain't gone But they had put out that he was gone before he was gone.

No, no The semis. The semis against, they wasn't into conference finals but yeah semis Dan been good since like maybe 17, 18. That's why John Wild deserves all the respect that he gets as a legend in that city. Him and Brad Bill but especially John Wall put a lot of buckets so they had a lot of great season and they was accustomed to, I know Gil had it going fourth second as well. But John Wall had the city lit. They was a 50 win team a couple times. Obviously it's hard to come by in that city for sure. Best wizard ever bro. Outside of mj. Damn who? John Wall. Yeah. Yeah.
