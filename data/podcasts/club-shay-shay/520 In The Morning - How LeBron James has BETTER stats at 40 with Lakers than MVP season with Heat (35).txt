Before we get into yesterday it's working NBA man some dope comparisons going on LeBron's year currently 20, 25, 40-year-old man MVP year 2013 at 27. Look at the stats. That shit's dead near scary. Both averaging 26 ums. Feel guard percent a little bit higher this year. 10% higher and three point at 45% a rebounds at assist.

9 (6m 23s):
Nah, what LeBron is doing is special at the age of 40. That's crazy. He not real. He like a robot. What they call that when you not the robot but when you like Super sand up. Yeah. Yeah he cyborg. Yeah he is something else bro. He ain't, he ain't real. But that should just show you how down the league was in 2013.

8 (6m 46s):
Damn.

9 (6m 47s):
I ain't gonna say down but just like him averaging 27.

2 (6m 51s):
Yeah

9 (6m 51s):
I should, I should say how much scoring was down. 'cause right now he would what you think he is in scoring top 2025?

8 (6m 59s):
Nah, 26

2 (6m 60s):
And a half. Nah

8 (7m 0s):
At least top 10. Yeah

9 (7m 1s):
10. Nah

2 (7m 3s):

9 (7m 6s):
It's a couple people averaging 30. Gianni's averaging 30. It's just a

8 (7m 9s):
26

2 (7m 9s):
People bro.

8 (7m 11s):
He at least 15 at 26 and a half.

9 (7m 15s):
Shit I might be wildling.

8 (7m 16s):
Nah, where

9 (7m 17s):
You at?

9 (7m 26s):
I'm just saying like

2 (7m 28s):
I mean 20 five's a big game bro. Yeah

9 (7m 30s):
I'm just, I'm not, I mean I was exaggerating but at 26 back then he probably was third in the league

8 (7m 36s):
Facts

9 (7m 36s):
For sure. You know what I mean? Yeah you look

2 (7m 38s):
At because it was a drop off after the teammate got to the league after teammate left the league. I mean

8 (7m 43s):
SGA 32 and six, Giannis 30.9 yolk right there at 28.9. AE at 28 basically there.

2 (7m 50s):
Look at J Tatum. I see you boy.

9 (7m 52s):
That's what I'm saying though. Like LeBron averaging 26. I mean he is 40 but I'm just telling you how much, You know, how many more points is being scored in the game nowadays.

8 (8m 1s):
For sure and shout to Tys Maxey. I ain't know he was top 10 buckets like that Respect. I know he was hooping but

2 (8m 6s):
Oh yeah bro, when he out there, he out there for

8 (8m 8s):
Sure. 26 tonight is crazy. My

2 (8m 9s):
Boy N P's top 20.

8 (8m 12s):
He is at number 20. Respect,

2 (8m 14s):
Respect bro.

9 (8m 15s):
Nah that's

8 (8m 15s):
Tyler hero. Hey respect man. Boys can get buckets this

9 (8m 19s):
Year but the fact that Brian is probably 20 years older than half the dudes on that list. Right. At least 15 years older. I know that

8 (8m 26s):
For sure.

9 (8m 28s):
It is crazy. We won't never see anything like this ever again in life done

8 (8m 33s):
Bro. Nah, as long

2 (8m 34s):
As we, Jordan was not doing this at 40.

9 (8m 36s):
Hell nah,

8 (8m 37s):
Nah but Jordan was doing it at 40. LeBron could never you see him in the club. The real goat

9 (8m 43s):
To be to average more rebounds and assists as you did as a 27-year-old when you were the best player on the planet at 40 years old. Yeah. To raise your game up. Shooting a better percentage from three

2 (8m 58s):
Over 13 years. You still like that some niggas had 13 year careers bro. Me,

9 (9m 5s):
I'm niggas

8 (9m 7s):
That is on Number one. Yeah

9 (9m 8s):
He said niggas I did. Yeah I him double

8 (9m 10s):
Up.

9 (9m 11s):
I had a 13 year career. He average 26 and then 13 years later, 26.

2 (9m 16s):
When you got Terry 26 he

9 (9m 18s):
Left my, my whole career he gave back. He still averaging 26 and he got better from percentages. He got better.

2 (9m 25s):
Yeah. Brian being a better shooter is fire.

8 (9m 27s):
That's a crazy part.

2 (9m 28s):
That's a big leap in the three point percentage. That's a different payday actually when you up against a contract he's like damn we shooting 45%, gotta pay

8 (9m 37s):
Average 27 8 35.

2 (9m 38s):
Yeah

9 (9m 39s):
Bro. So I you tell him to retire

8 (9m 41s):
Like you don't

9 (9m 42s):
So what's wrong with him playing two or three more years And it is like

2 (9m 46s):
There's nothing bro because he is still playing at a high level.

9 (9m 49s):
Yeah. When dude be tell bro like listen man dude do we ever wanna see bro averaging 18,

2 (9m 56s):
I'm okay with it bro because you average 27 and 40

8 (10m 1s):
At 42 you can average 18. That's

2 (10m 2s):
And if you, if your team is winning

9 (10m 5s):
But

2 (10m 5s):
Do we ever at 43 I

9 (10m 6s):
Never want see bro where I feel like somebody I see

2 (10m 10s):
You don't wanna see Brian on the Lakers team with Lance Stevenson and all them averaging 18. That'd be impressing never, never, never. But if LeBron is on a championship aspiration with Luca and whoever else they grab bro he averaging 18. That's fire.

9 (10m 24s):
I never wanna see what people start ice on Brian.

8 (10m 27s):
Yeah.

2 (10m 28s):
Nah you gotta come get in a blender bro.

8 (10m 29s):
Like there's a play where Brad Bill is like throw LeBron shot off the backboards just like hey I don't wanna see this bro because two years ago bro he's getting poked on bro.

9 (10m 37s):
Like, I mean but everybody get they shot. I'm talking about when they start ice on you,

2 (10m 42s):
He ain't going

8 (10m 43s):
Bro. 27-year-old LeBron bro. Brad Bill wouldn't left three point line. I mean I seen LeBron

2 (10m 47s):
Was getting shook

9 (10m 48s):
Bro for I seen Jay Robinson block LeBron shit.

2 (10m 51s):
Hey niggas was getting shook. Nate Robinson called him. Yeah people didn't call him bros. Yeah

9 (10m 55s):
But I'm the saying word niggas is clearing bro out like put him in a pick and roll.

2 (11m 1s):
Yeah. Keely and Hayes.

8 (11m 2s):
Yeah when you see Dyson Daniels ISO bro, I don't wanna see that bro.

9 (11m 6s):
Yeah they like, he can't stay in front of you like, You know what I mean? I don't want, I don't

2 (11m 9s):
Wanna see that. I mean well AE just did it to kd. Yeah

9 (11m 12s):
I

8 (11m 12s):
But that's Anthony Edwards too. Yeah

9 (11m 14s):
But that's a one-on-one battle. Everybody get the be I'm talking about when niggas like me start iso on bro. Like lemme get that.

2 (11m 20s):
Oh y'all trying to pick on him? Yeah

9 (11m 22s):
Lemme get that switch. Yeah

2 (11m 23s):
Bro you did that for your career or

9 (11m 25s):
Like put Brian in a pick and roll like nah

8 (11m 27s):
Yeah I don't wanna see that. I still laugh. I went back and watched that metal world piece episode you was talking about. Yeah I had you on the island.

9 (11m 33s):
Yeah. See I never want Brian to be put on the, I put metal world peace, one of the best defenders ever in basketball.

2 (11m 40s):
You, you my dog for that too. I put

9 (11m 42s):
Him on the island

2 (11m 43s):
For telling for telling him. I said yeah see that's why we brothers fuck these niggas. He told the craziest person ever remember I put you on a motherfucking brief,

9 (11m 57s):
I'm just speaking my truth.

8 (11m 59s):
And then Louise made clip for a shout to Luis.

9 (12m 1s):
I never warn LeBron to have that moment 'cause LeBron don't deserve that. But I don't think that moment happened for another two years.

8 (12m 8s):
I don't think we should LeBron retire until the second year after he's a player on of a team that Vegas NBA team that second year then LeBron go ahead retire but he gonna play that first year for sure.

9 (12m 16s):
Yeah that's tight.

8 (12m 17s):
Shout out to LeBron man. Let's get to it Yesterday FGA went crazy with a 51 piece yesterday took care of the rockets. 1 37 1 28 like we said man four 50 point game this season, 51 75 J Dub had 24 4 and three. That's

2 (12m 32s):
Back to back too for sure. The young I picked the rockets for him to do that on back. Toback night is insane.

8 (12m 37s):
The young talent for the rockets hoop that yesterday Ken Whitmore had 27 11. He was balling we talked about re shepherd, he got a moment yesterday 25 and five.

2 (12m 43s):
Yeah G leading to helped him.

9 (12m 45s):
Reid Shepherd gonna be a good player. That's what I was talking about with the rockets like going forward instead of going for a big name point guard, do you let this young kid develop and see what you got with him. Is he a Peyton Prichard or is he something better? You know what I mean? So yeah you keep Van and let this young guy develop. He young. He super young with he probably 19 if that 20 years old. So I know they got a bright future with the Rockets

8 (13m 14s):
Man. If year two fare shed looks like Peyton Prichard, that's fire. That's a hell of a look for them. I mean obviously you want him to grow more into that with him being in such a high lottery pick. But if year two he's Peyton Prichard now. Yeah you gotta still right now I think he

9 (13m 24s):
Has potential to be a little better. He bigger, he around six three, You know what I mean? Six four way more athletic fact for sure. Way more athletic. If what we, what he showed us in college and what he showed us in the G League just as good as a shooter. I've known him forever. So I know you a high IQ player and then as a rookie getting 25 and five against the best team in the league besides the Cavs. Well one of the best teams in the league when you got your opportunity it say a lot.

8 (13m 56s):
Most definitely took advantage.

9 (13m 57s):
It say a lot.

8 (13m 58s):
Oh scroll to his pick. Oh that pick is crazy. Yeah

9 (14m 0s):
He got a poor mustache. Yeah LeBron

8 (14m 4s):
Reed

9 (14m 4s):
Sanchez. I don't even know if I should say

2 (14m 5s):
That. Don't even look like my boy Reid.

8 (14m 8s):
Reid look like he just got off work

2 (14m 9s):
As day now look like Tim T Greed right there man. Yeah.

8 (14m 13s):
Oldest 20 year row ever.

2 (14m 14s):
That's how they treated. That's how Travis Kel looks because Reid used to have a cool little taper fade. You feel me? What's happened to your side bro? Get that bad. Yeah he, he

8 (14m 28s):
On the Jimmy Baller picture that shit because re don't look like

2 (14m 30s):
That bro. That's a no he really don't. That might be a fake picture. Nah he look like that might be AI bro.

8 (14m 35s):
He look

9 (14m 36s):
Like that bro.

2 (14m 38s):
He

8 (14m 38s):
Got re shepherd messed up the

2 (14m 39s):
Comb over. It's crazy how different white people could look by the haircut bro.

8 (14m 43s):
Oh yeah, different agendas bro. By the style you got a great clips it goes line it up yourself. You get real different at GA Man four 50 pieces month. I mean this year. Excuse me. That's crazy. Just consistently killing the way he is been killing. Always gonna at least get 30 but the 50 piece averaging 32 best team in NBA.

2 (15m 0s):
Let's go ahead and give him the award bro. He got it.

8 (15m 3s):
Oh yeah he has to get MVP this year. Anything else would be insane. That's cool.

9 (15m 6s):
Yeah he, he wanted the coldest players to watch play basketball. Like when I watch him play he's so smooth and effortless with his game that it is like I don't know how we don't highlight him more.

2 (15m 23s):
Is he more smooth than Ray Allen on the books? Yeah

9 (15m 26s):
He the smoothest player I ever seen play basketball bro. Everything about his game is nasty. Like if you think about it like when you think about him as a player, he don't shoot a lot of threes. All his game is bump, step throughs fadeaways mid-range. But when you watch it, it's the smoothest thing ever. Like if you heard somebody say this guy play like this, oh he shoot his mid ranges and bumps and try to go to the basket, you would be like he got a nasty game.

2 (15m 54s):
Yeah

9 (15m 55s):
But when you watch it, nah that shit go shit

2 (15m 58s):
Just, I don't even see nobody else that play like him. Nah

9 (16m 1s):
In the

2 (16m 1s):
League. Like he, he plays like damn near against the game. For real.

9 (16m 7s):
He like a, he got like Rod Strickland game I like that. Like he got handles get to the paint finish really well and then he got this smoothness about him like a Ray Allen. He just don't.

2 (16m 18s):
Yeah that's right. So like Ray Allen in Milwaukee Diner play the same way. He just Ray Allen shooting the three for sure.

9 (16m 24s):
Yeah but he got so many counters and handles and step throughs. He got like gin Ray Allen, rod Strickland all mixed together. It's kind of crazy. His game is

2 (16m 35s):
He bringing the tools back? I remember they was getting away from that in the NBA. Yeah they was against shooting tools so yeah he getting 30 shooting them damn DeMar de Rosen.

8 (16m 43s):
Yeah I was gonna say getting 50 pieces and probably making a couple threes is crazy.

9 (16m 47s):
Nah, he like that he get to that free throw line

2 (16m 49s):
So he got the deepest bag in the league.

9 (16m 52s):
Oh for

8 (16m 52s):
Sure. I think so for sure. Outside of Kyrie,

9 (16m 55s):
Him, Kyrie got the craziest handles and all that but like to get to it, him and Luca get to it more than anybody. Like they put you on they hip, they get any shot they want at any time.

2 (17m 8s):
Y'all got a top three deepest bag right now?

9 (17m 12s):
Say Luca and Kyrie.

8 (17m 14s):
I like that they

9 (17m 14s):
Get right to it.

2 (17m 16s):
You ain't gonna throw KD in there.

9 (17m 18s):
KD got a deep bag with KD more if I just shoot over you.

2 (17m 21s):
Okay. Like

9 (17m 23s):
I one, two dribble, seven foot shoot over you.

8 (17m 26s):
Yeah I don't even see you gonna pull up.

9 (17m 28s):
Yeah like KD don't even go to the basket for real for real. He shoot straight mid, he's just over you for sure. Three

2 (17m 34s):
Balls. Yeah.

8 (17m 35s):
Yeah he went five from nine three or straight with a 50 piece. Yeah if, if Shay's hitting five threes you're cooked Cool because he didn't even take that million other games. So yeah shout out to him more for the Rockets man. They started off this year, 17 to six on the road dropped the last seven row games and Sam Amick has reports that they're both looking at KD and book possibly to join that Raus team. They have the capital and they have the young talent to do

9 (17m 58s):
It. Nothing bro they have to trade for KD and book. Oh

2 (18m 0s):
Nothing bro. Possibly

9 (18m 2s):
Nothing that ain't happening bro. Don't they

8 (18m 4s):
Have to give up everything in the world

9 (18m 5s):
Ain gone. Yeah that

2 (18m 6s):
That's a business decision though. I ain't trading for them if I got a young core like that, that's like the thunder doing that bro. Y'all got a young core. They ont. I mean book ain't on his way out but KD is bro too high risk bro.

9 (18m 19s):
You gotta give up the Thompson twin Ken with more Reed Shepherd and probably Jalen Green

2 (18m 25s):
Don't have to needy.

8 (18m 27s):
I'll take KD in that situation.

9 (18m 29s):
Oh yeah Jalen, I'll take, if I

8 (18m 30s):
Can just get KD in this situation. Yeah I'll make some, I'll make some moves with kd.

9 (18m 34s):
I'm not

2 (18m 34s):
Taking both those contest. He as a business owner bro. I'm sleep bro.

9 (18m 37s):
KI give up Ken Whitmore, tar Easton I give up all the wings. What you Thompson twin? Yeah,

8 (18m 44s):
I'll give you Ken win

2 (18m 44s):
Dylan. Wish I can keep my whole cord. Well yeah but if I gotta give up the smoke, I'm not bro.

9 (18m 49s):
No I'm saying as long as I can keep the Thompson twin I give up Dylan Brooks cam with Morta and Reed Shepherd. No

2 (18m 55s):
Say less.

8 (18m 55s):
That's what I'm saying. I I'm

2 (18m 57s):
Just, I'm not giving away Jalen though. I'm not giving away Thompson. No that's absolutely not bro. But

8 (19m 2s):
Ken Whitmore. Jabari.

9 (19m 4s):
Yeah I know Jabari for sure

8 (19m 6s):
The two

2 (19m 6s):
Picks.

8 (19m 6s):
Jabari

2 (19m 7s):
KD probably gonna go to the Hornets. He's on anybody's straight block right now.

9 (19m 10s):
Yeah. Don't do Jabari like that. Oh I like him. He a quality player though.

2 (19m 14s):
He is but I'm he's on anybody. Yeah, but I'm saying he's more, y'all want him.

9 (19m 18s):
I definitely,

8 (19m 19s):
I think we'll have a good postseason too. I think

9 (19m 21s):
KD going be, if he gets to the Rocket that's a good pick. But I want him to go to the OKC. Okay. I think OKC got a better formula for him. They got all those picks give up three of 'em first round picks for kd. One of them little young joints he got on the bench

8 (19m 38s):
Make

9 (19m 38s):
It happen. Yeah.

2 (19m 40s):
That way when he go we still the same.

9 (19m 42s):
Yeah,

2 (19m 43s):
That's what I'm saying. I

9 (19m 44s):
And it's a homecoming like Yeah.

8 (19m 46s):
Yeah and BA would love that and

9 (19m 48s):
You fit, you fit that group 'cause he ain't a selfish player. He don't need too many shots. KD get 14 shots, he gonna make eight of them.

8 (19m 57s):
Most definitely.

2 (19m 59s):
Yeah

8 (20m 0s):
For sure.

9 (23m 50s):
Is a good, still good defensive player by probably the defensive player of the year. Mm. He averaging three stills a game.

8 (23m 59s):
Tyson de which is crazy.

9 (24m 0s):
Jackson Daniels is having a hell of a year Win went out. I think he should be next in line for Ave Player of the year. I know everybody talking about Triple

8 (24m 7s):
J. Yeah,

9 (24m 8s):
The league ain't gonna let it happen anyway though.

8 (24m 11s):
Oh

9 (24m 11s):
You don't think so? Nah, he gonna be up for that super max. And they all work together. Yes. So D and Daniels probably he should be defensive player of the year. He is having a hell of a year.

8 (24m 20s):
Yeah.

9 (24m 21s):
Averaging three stills is not normal.

8 (24m 23s):
No, that's insane. Actually. Yeah,

9 (24m 24s):
That's, that's not normal.

8 (24m 25s):
Here we go. This is how this game ended. Ja was out. Triple J was already hurt. Lemme hold

9 (24m 29s):
That.

8 (24m 29s):
Gimme that shit

2 (24m 30s):
When you come on the show Dance. We gotta talk about that one.

8 (24m 33s):
Hey you in Europe for game. It's crazy.

2 (24m 38s):
We gonna talk about that one Dad

8 (24m 40s):
At D Band Hooped out yesterday. 35 point triple double 35, 10 to 10. He played great. Amazing. It's

9 (24m 46s):
Just a, You know, just a heady play by Dyson Daniels. That's one of the best defenses in the league. And he just happened to make a good play on the ball.

2 (24m 54s):
Good pass pass too. That's a K Love pass. Good pass.

8 (24m 58s):
You're up for Game is crazy. Curious about hoop out yesterday 25 and five.

2 (25m 2s):
See Trey Young. Celebrate your guys man. 'cause you had a bad game.

8 (25m 6s):
Still had 1215 though. Five for 17 from the field. Young Zachary look good yesterday with 27 though.

9 (25m 11s):
Yeah they they, they speak high in him

8 (25m 14s):
Very, very high. They

9 (25m 15s):
Say he he one of those gym rats. One of those guys gonna be really good. You know, speaking to my family over there in Atlanta, they were really excited about him so it's good to see him having a moment. Yeah we, when I was even a scouter we loved Dyson Daniels, we loved his defensive ability so to see him get on the team and doing what he's doing hype for him man. That's fire

8 (25m 36s):
For sure man. Shout to, I was getting a W yesterday unfortunately for the Grizzlies job was already out yesterday but they lost Triple J as well. Parent ankle injury. We'll hear more about that. But they dropped six to the last eight man currently Fourth in the West.

9 (25m 51s):
Yeah I think the Grizzlies, they is one of those teams. They always an injury away from being out the playoffs and with the Lakers playing how they're playing. I think the Lakers solidified that two seed for the of going forward if Luca and LeBron can stay healthy but the Grizzlies man without Ja they just not that

2 (26m 12s):
No

9 (26m 13s):
Triple J can have moments like he did the other day, had a big game

8 (26m 17s):
But hell of a season.

2 (26m 18s):
He don't have no like Kevin Garnett impact on the team

9 (26m 21s):
Bro. Yeah his 35 is just like it is just 30.

2 (26m 26s):
It's different. Yeah. Yeah

9 (26m 27s):
It is just like he had 30 but like Ja Marin 35 is like I can change your season 35. I can win a playoff game 35.

8 (26m 36s):
Yeah

9 (26m 37s):
I can change the momentum of a series 35. Yeah. And without him Memphis is just whatever.

8 (26m 42s):
For sure. It's a a different type of impact for sure. Could we go to the Western Standard please? They drop down to four. Yeah. Rockets. Grizzlies right now. I'd have to go Rockets.

9 (26m 54s):
Look at them. Look at them warriors though.

8 (26m 57s):
Right there at six.

9 (26m 58s):
It might get, they don't wanna see the Warriors in the playoffs series. Oh

8 (27m 2s):
Nah.

9 (27m 3s):
The Rockets don't wanna see 'em. The Grizzlies don't wanna see 'em That that's not that don't that Jimmy Butler effect is real man. Warriors

2 (27m 11s):
Play the Grizzly that's four one

8 (27m 15s):
Real right now it'd be Nuggets Warriors. So that

9 (27m 17s):
Jimmy Butler effect is a real thing bro. I was a part of a crew when Jimmy came along.

8 (27m 25s):
Hey man, while we here. Speaking of the worst six to the last seven got a Doug Bishop of the Hornets won 19 to 1 0 1. It look like a different team. Married man

9 (27m 33s):
Got Jimmy Butler effect is a real thing. I'm telling y'all I've been a part of a team where they ain't make the playoffs for 14 years.

2 (27m 40s):
Dre got hurt little stats again too.

8 (27m 43s):
Yeah.

9 (27m 44s):
Draymond. Yo

2 (27m 45s):
16, 12 and 16 was a real Draymond green line.

9 (27m 48s):
They playing with a sense of urgency. Yeah and you seen it defensively. They playing better offensively. They rolling. Yeah it's a sense of urgency and I think Jimmy brought that or like a little sense of hope like all right we know we going for it now. We done brought Jimmy in. Yeah we ain't playing all these young dudes. We trying to win. For real.

2 (28m 7s):
Yeah and for him to win. For y'all to win And he only had 13 four and three. It's fire.

8 (28m 12s):
Come on man. Yeah but he had 22 yesterday

2 (28m 15s):
Solid bro. Brand

8 (28m 17s):
19

2 (28m 17s):
Yesterday. He change the dynamic of a locker room

8 (28m 19s):
Instantly bro. It's crazy. I mean also we gotta go to the Hornets Miles Bridge is Hooped out 35 and nine. Melo Hooped out with 25, 9 and seven. Miss Rub that both of them are going to be on the trading block this off season. Where would y'all like to see the Melo Ball

9 (28m 33s):
Clippers?

8 (28m 34s):
Okay.

2 (28m 35s):
Yeah. Go somewhere where it's dynamic boy go to Miami boy, go to somewhere.

8 (28m 40s):
Hey I am not mad. Another ball in Miami

2 (28m 42s):
Can't go to another Charlotte team.

9 (28m 44s):
I mean

8 (28m 45s):
The Meow and Pat Riley. I don't know if that's gonna work out but I would love to see him.

9 (28m 48s):
Well never gonna work out the clip. See if the clips, the Clippers is trash. Like if the Clippers don't make no noise, you go get Lalo, you trade UA or you trade James Harden. Whatever you get rid of these older dudes bring some new blood in. You bring Lalo LA kid. It is gonna be exciting. Mm You

2 (29m 9s):
Go that's the steal.

8 (29m 10s):
I like that

9 (29m 12s):
Because the Clippers are always in that middle of the pack. They not gonna compete for a championship this year. Yeah, it ain't not winning. You might as well put buts in the seats and Lalo gonna put 'em in the seat. People love Lalo. Kids love Lalo.

8 (29m 24s):
Especially in LA too. LA

9 (29m 26s):
Kid. Yeah,

8 (29m 27s):
I like

9 (29m 27s):
That. You might as well move on from James move on from Kauai. Whoever you gotta move on from. Bring Lalo ball

8 (29m 35s):
Start to rebuild. What Lalo? Yeah. Got new stadium too.

2 (29m 38s):
Him and Tylo will click. Yeah, that'd be cool.

8 (29m 41s):
I like that idea. I like that idea a lot. I forgot about Tlu being a good leader for him in that situation. For sure. Yeah. Damn. Like you said man the Warriors is a tough team. I would not wanna see them in the playoffs. I think outside of Nuggets. Anybody else don't feel comfortable or me feel okay in that situation. But yeah, I would leave Steph and Jimmy alone. They do too much for sure. The

9 (30m 0s):
Only thing about the Clippers is that they dealt with people with injuries for so long. PG was injury prone Kawai out with injuries. James Harden since he's been the only one who's been consistent, always willing to play. You trade for Lalo, you basically

8 (30m 19s):
Iffy.

9 (30m 19s):
Yeah. He might only play 30, 40 games a year or two. So

2 (30m 24s):
It's a curse.

9 (30m 25s):
Yeah. Such a

2 (30m 26s):
Curse For real bro. Clipper curse. Curse damn near. Damn in Brooklyn bro. Them is two franchises where boys go and he gonna get hurt.

8 (30m 33s):
Yeah. That Brooklyn shit different. Yeah.

9 (30m 35s):
So I don't know if I, I'd be like a little iffy to trade for him 'cause of that but whatever.

8 (30m 41s):
Yeah. Speaking of her teams Dallas, we gotta bring up the allegations against them yesterday. Give us on to Kyrie. He got hurt yesterday in the game belt to as situation 1 22 98. King's got the dub Levine 22 and three. Der Rosa had 20 man Kyrie got hurt yesterday. We will see what's going on with him. Press up for him but sprained

2 (30m 59s):
Knee. Okay.

9 (31m 0s):
Yeah. Why you can hold me down?

2 (31m 2s):
Glad he didn't tear nothing

9 (31m 4s):
For us.

2 (31m 5s):
Yeah, that was wild.

8 (31m 6s):
Yeah but shout to the DoorDash pulling up later than ever. Yeah man. Give us home for Dallas. Everything that's walking the door is getting hurt this year. They just need to go ahead and shut everybody down for next year man. Yeah

9 (31m 16s):
It is pretty much over with that Kyrie injury man. I pray that everything is straight but that shit didn't look too pleasant.

2 (31m 26s):
Yeah, I I wouldn't want play.

9 (31m 28s):
Nah I think he gonna have to sit the rest of the year out. That was, that was pretty, yeah

2 (31m 32s):
Was scary. Hopefully

8 (31m 33s):
It's a sprain. Well that's what other people are thinking it is. Hopefully not that but

9 (31m 36s):
I pray it's a sprain and it's Ramadan too so just chill out brother.

8 (31m 42s):
Yeah, for sure bro.

9 (31m 44s):
You

8 (31m 44s):
Know what I mean? It's not worth it right now. It's

9 (31m 46s):
Chill out. Yeah.

8 (31m 47s):
Especially not doubt Ramadan

2 (31m 48s):
Easier when you ain't playing so shit. Yeah,

8 (31m 50s):
Well it, it is easy when you got people who care about your meal. Remember how they say Brooklyn was giving him them the Lunchables saying get out the mud

2 (31m 56s):
And it was out of pocket. Yeah that seems that was that Covid stuff though. They, they was just playing with his mind.

8 (32m 2s):
We need a 30 for 30 in that situation about how the next did that to James Harden. K

2 (32m 6s):
Kyrie has really overcame a lot bro. What?

8 (32m 9s):
But they trying to shout Kyrie out the league bro. Like he was trash or a terrible person bro.

2 (32m 13s):
It was wild bro.

8 (32m 14s):
For sure man. But shout to Vin man. What's the coverage player of the week? Been going crazy. 26 and a half. Is he a person that the Kings wanna keep long term next season?

2 (32m 23s):
They don't want to keep nobody.

8 (32m 24s):
I was gonna say who knows what the Kings wanna do. Yeah,

9 (32m 27s):
I don't know. Probably though they been wanting him for a long time. They was the first ones they offering him that, that contract before the Bulls and

8 (32m 35s):
Bulls said restricted free agency for a reason. Yeah.

9 (32m 38s):
So he had to come back to Chicago but been fan Zach Levi for a while. So I think they probably keep him

8 (32m 44s):
For sure. Shout to Zach Levine man couple games took place last night as well. The Blazers took care of the seven Sixers. One 19 to 1 0 2. Every Simons Hooped out yesterday 34 piece. Jayden Sharpe Hooped out as well. 2011 and five. Tyree Maxey got hurt early in the game though. Give us some for him as well. But Andre drummer hoop out yesterday 25 and 18.

9 (33m 3s):
It don't matter. Shut the whole team down. Okay.

2 (33m 6s):
Drum.

8 (33m 6s):
Yeah drum hooped out yesterday.

9 (33m 8s):
Shut the whole team down. They they can probably get Tank for Cooper or something. I don't know. Capture

8 (33m 14s):
The flag. Yeah, they pick. Gotta be terrible too to keep you I believe too so. Yeah. Yeah we be doing

2 (33m 20s):
Lit.

9 (33m 21s):
They ready to hunt. Boy.

2 (33m 23s):
That be lit bro.

9 (33m 25s):
If they just lose the next,

8 (33m 27s):
I don't want that to happen bro.

9 (33m 28s):
The rest of their games bro.

2 (33m 29s):
Tyrese Maxi, Jerry McCain and Freaky Cool.

8 (33m 33s):
No give them X Bailey.

2 (33m 35s):
I'm something bro. I'm rocking.

8 (33m 37s):
I only give them Cooper if they trade him B

2 (33m 40s):
I'm rocking bro.

8 (33m 42s):
I love that. They ain't fear for him to walk into that locker room bro.

2 (33m 45s):
I don't like him on none of them bottom three teams right there.

8 (33m 49s):
Well don't you worry he'll be there. I

2 (33m 51s):
Ain't mad at you. I ain't mad at Toronto though. I ain't mad at him in Toronto. Who? Coop?

9 (33m 59s):
Nah,

2 (33m 60s):
If he had to go out out of them three teams. You mad at that?

9 (34m 4s):
Nah I won't. I don't

2 (34m 5s):
Want you see him with the Wizard go to the West. I'm just saying brother. What you,

9 (34m 10s):
I don't never wanna see him with the Wizard or the Hors. Can you go to the Western conference? I won't see who the last team was. Oh You

8 (34m 16s):
Know who it is. You Tall Baby

2 (34m 19s):
D Aaron Fox bro. You know we know you watch the show bro. Keep losing.

8 (34m 23s):
Shut it down.

2 (34m 25s):
I don't want to say you no shit like that but you just did. Well I did not know y'all are 13. Let the Blazers rock out bro. Yeah, let Chay and them figure it out. If he can get to the Spurs, that'd be Oh Lord.

9 (34m 38s):
But they, they not gonna let him get Weby in. That's, that's too stupid. You don't think it's gonna

8 (34m 42s):
Happen? Adam Silver make the fucking call

9 (34m 44s):
Weby in Cooper flag

2 (34m 46s):
Nothing Jim I'm

9 (34m 47s):
Something. They need Cooper flag in a different market. Already got Weby.

8 (34m 50s):
Nah, I'll turn it up.

9 (34m 51s):
Utah. Utah's getting Cooper flag.

8 (34m 53s):
That's a

2 (34m 54s):
Waste. I swear I didn't know they was 13 y'all. I thought we was just talking about the Spurs being like up.

9 (34m 58s):
You gotta think Utah don't have a star. Weby is Spurs. Pelicans got Zion, jazz, they got nothing. They gonna put him in Utah

8 (35m 9s):
If you don't, if you don't send him. I wish

9 (35m 11s):
It, it was like the old days where you could see the draft. Who got the Number one pick while you was still in college and you had the chance to go back to college.

2 (35m 18s):
Yeah,

9 (35m 19s):
I wonder what boys would be going back to college.

8 (35m 22s):
Yeah they was making light jokes. He was talking about yeah I might come back for another year but no you're not bro. John Shire is not allowing you to come back to that university. Yeah, he

9 (35m 28s):
Will

2 (35m 30s):
On you. Damn.

9 (35m 32s):
That's my job. If you tell me if you came off and said I'm coming back coach, I ain't gonna be like no you not. You going to the NBA, you're gonna be no one draft pick. And he'd be like, no I a of

2 (35m 40s):
Coaches do do that though bro. What? Tell him man you ain't coming back. Yeah bro. Get

9 (35m 44s):
Yeah. I mean I would tell him that

2 (35m 46s):
Ca did the markets like that.

9 (35m 47s):
I, if he told me to my face coach I do not wanna play for Utah, I'm coming back here. I'm gonna say no you not. You need to take your ass to the drama. Cause parents say y'all are the Number one pick go and their parents say No, no, no we don't want to go. I'm not gonna be like well I'm not letting you back. Okay motherfucker. Well

2 (36m 5s):
I try, I mean well at least you I'm just saying. Yeah at that point you act like Nick came in the office shit I was gonna tell you don't go anyway. That's how you make a decision. Nah, nah,

9 (36m 14s):
Nah, nah, nah they ain't gonna do that. I'm saying

11 (36m 16s):
You ain't on

2 (36m 16s):
That bro. Nah, it is different bro. Kyle was pushing them boys like yeah

9 (36m 20s):
I'm sure Duke is pushing him. Man you gonna be the Number one player. You the best player in the country to go to the league bro. You deserve to play in your

2 (36m 25s):
Best because you don't risk that injury.
