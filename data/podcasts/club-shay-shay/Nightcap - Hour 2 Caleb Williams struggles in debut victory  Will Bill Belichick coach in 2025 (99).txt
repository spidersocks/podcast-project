Joey b will have to pick it up now. Oh yeah, now he make 50. He 55 million. 55 million Gotta be better than That. Yeah. Oh, be good now. I mean, there's a reason why he got that 55 million before he got it. He still started O one. He still started season O one. You hear me? We we good. We good. We gonna be all we gonna, Hey, remember two times two bowl winning champ. How they look Last year? In the beginning they wasn't too pretty now they weren't too pretty. But as a young, there's a, there's a young dude that's three and one against that young fellas. That's a, a two times Super Bowl champion coming in into week two, going in the Arrowhead next week. And you know what's gonna happen? And I I'm telling you, I'm not even Cleo. Remember the, you remember the commercial? Remember Cleo? Yeah, I know Miss Cleo.


Okay. I'm just letting you know in the chat though. No, I'm telling you right now. I'm telling you ahead of time. If you're a gambler man, put your money on the Bengals next week because we ain't losing. We ain't losing. Oh, y'all gonna win. I guarantee you next week the Bengals will be four in the one against the Chiefs or Joe Burrow will be, I'm telling you, matter of fact, I'm going to the game. I'm gonna go to the game. I don't even know what Kansas City at, but I'm gonna get a flight because I know Spirit go there. Okay. That, that, what happened to Miss Cleo Ocho? I don't know. Boy, I remember that. I used to see the commercials all the time.


The little infomercials. I ain't seen him in a, in a minute, Did she? I don't know. I think she might, something might have happened, huh. But anyway, Adam, she to drop the bomb this morning that Coach Belichick wants to return to coaching next season, tell he wanted to coach this season. That's why he went on job interviews. They make it seem like, they make it seem like Coach Belichick turned jobs down. That wasn't the case. I I, you know what I, I'd like, I'd like to see him coach. I think the difference now with, with Bill is will Bill be able to adapt to the younger generation of players? Will he be able to evolve? I don't think, I don't think the older style of coaching in a sense will resonate with the younger, with the younger generation.


I don't know if that makes sense. I think you might be able to explain it a little better. I think those in the chat might understand what I'm saying. Being able to relate to the players, being able for getting the players to understand how you do things. I don't think the old school style of coaching will, will, will go very well with them, if that makes sense. As Adam reported, coach Belichick wants to return to coaches. Yeah. If the right opportunity presents itself, Belichick will be able to keep a close eye on the league through the media projects, tracking his players and ready himself to coach again. Coach O where do you land?


Where would you think he will land? Like as I said, Cowboys, he went on some interviews. Remember he had two interviews with the Falcons before they settled on Raheem Moore. Right? Morris, excuse me. He interviewed somewhere else. Where else did he interview at? Did he interview with two teams? I know he interviewed with the Falcons. Hey. Who? Yeah. No, I'm saying did he interview? I'm talking about to be a head coach. They wanted him as an old DC in, in, in San Fran. Did he interview in Seattle? Did he interview? Why? Why am I thinking he interviewed with two teams? I know he had two interviews with the Falcons.


I, I I like, I like, I like, honestly, honestly, I like Bill on TV better, man. I like Bill on tv. He want that record. Is it three? He want Shula? It's 3 79. What's the number again? Nah, I think it's like 3 42. Something like that. 3 47. Where, where, how far away is he? Probably like 20 games. I think that's it. 25 games. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. That's it in the right situation. That's it. I mean in New England he there. Yeah. I mean he wasn't gonna get it 'cause Well, I mean we we're, we Where could he go? Can you imagine Belichick with the Cowboys, Didn't he like No. What what'd he say?


Just the Falcons. Just the Falcons. Okay. So you, you just, you heard me. Go ahead, coach. Yeah. Could you, Huh? Could you imagine Bill with the bill with the Cowboys? That ain't happening. That ain't happening. It's hard Ocho when you think about it. Yeah. When you've had power for 20 years. Yes sir. No, for so last, so 20, almost, almost 25 years, right? You had total control. How do you go and you have a general manager over you and you don't get really final say on the roster or draft how you operate under That. I think I you, you have a conversation before you even, that's why you have those, those those interviews.


Yeah. Understand. Understand the land, land land the landscape before you even get hired. And if, if, if the young fellow with the star who run owns the team doesn't, doesn't agree. You just walk. You just walk. It's, it's just that simple. The great, well arguably one of the, you Know Jerry gonna give you that. Jerry just told you Ocho he told you can't nobody do it better than him. I I, I mean Bill has six Super Bowl championships. But I think he can Jerry say he been through it. He seen this thing from start to finish. Can't nobody do it like me. Hey, one thing about it, he's a, he's a salesman.


Can't nobody sick. Can't nobody sell a product like he can now. That, that, that, that I agree with. So the Vikings beat the Giants 28 6. The Giants were blown off the field by Minnesota and the opener, they heard booze after the second offensive play again while leaving the field at halftime. And consistently throughout the second half Giants fans even posted a video of themselves lighting Daniel Jones jersey on fire. Ah, New York did not attempt a single pass over 20 air yards in the first three quarters. The offense didn't look any different with Brian Bay. Brian Day Ball as the play caller as it did last season with Mike Ka Kafka after the game.


Dexter Lawrence spoke about the giant fans booing Daniel Jones. Oh Joe, let's take a listen to the sound. Mm. I don't respect it honestly. I get it. They wanna see their team win. You know, it's, it's, it's a rough patch. I mean it just, it is what it is. Rough patch. It's been a rough patch for a while, huh? Yeah. What, what do you think about the board of Daniel Jones? You okay with it? I mean, it's part of the game. It's part of the game. Listen, you have to have thick skin. You know what, Daniel Jones plays football. Right. You know who he plays for you. I do. You worry about the fans, boy, the media don't even play that.


The media playing in the New York media. You got to, you gotta have thick skin. You do. You gotta have thick skin playing anywhere in New York. You gotta have thick skin. So he should be used to it. Listen things, some things just haven't going Daniel Jones way. They haven't they got you some weapons in there. You gotta use them. You gotta use him. And the John Mara, how you say his name? Is it John Mara? Yeah. You have to be upset letting Sequan Barkley walk watching him perform the way he performed Thursday night. Like that. No, you gave for $140 million to Daniel Jones.


That's what you should be upset about. They didn't have, they didn't have a choice at that time. Remember? Oh, you got a choice. The timing, the, the timing of everything. There, there, there, there, there's no other option. There was an option. Ooh, because you gave it to 'em. You still had a 50 year option. You still had a fourth year option. Oh, you had options. Let him prove it. That's what they did. That's what they did to Sequan. They put the franchise tag on it, didn't it? They didn't give him no long-term deal. Oh, you, You, you know, you know that, you know, they don't value the quarterback. I mean the running back position in the NFL no more. Well the problem is they value the wrong players. I'm not saying the the position isn't valuable, right. I mean No, that's, that's the way the league has shaped. I I don't, I don't know how to explain it.


I don't know at one point now that it's it's, it's shifted to being pass heavy. Yeah. They don't value the, the the running back position as much as they used to. I mean, lemme say it like that. Let, Don't Nah, Because he said it's a pass happy league. Nobody just, oh, we just gonna run the football. Right, Right, right, Right. And because you pay the quarterback so much, you paid a wide receiver. Think about it. Quarterbacks making 60 wide receivers, making 34 mm 35. Yeah. So that's 95 million between two players. Yeah. And you want me to turn around? You want, so in other words, I got two players that I'm paying 95 million. Right. But you want me to turn around and hand it to a guy that I'm paying 8 million to.


You gotta be special to get that bag, boy. Like you gotta be, you gotta be special. You gotta be able to, you gotta be a Swiss Army knife. You gotta be able to line up at receiver, come out, run, run out the backfield, catch out the backfield. You gotta be, be able to do so many different things and be dynamic to actually get well over double figures at the running back ion. Oh yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only, only McCaffery. I think McCaffery was making what, like 18, 19 million a year. Damn. But he got that big, remember he got that big contract in and in Carolina. Right. And nobody's been able to surpass him. A lot of running backs has come up. Zeke came up, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, there's been a lot of backs.


Right. That's come up and no one has been able to surpass that number. Right. 19. Yeah. He Make 19. He 19 Camaro's next with 15. Okay. But remember C but, but remember McAfee got 16, 5, 4, 5 years, four years ago. Oh. He been getting Dagg and nobody's and nobody's been and nobody's been able to to leapfrog that 16. Right. He just got an extension that bumped him up to 19. Yeah. He been getting that bad And Right, right. I get it. You know, offensive player of the year. He can do it all. Yeah, he can catch it. He can run it. Oh yeah. You know, he's great in pass protection. You know, they do a good job of using him. They, you know, you don't l leave him in too much old pass protection 'cause you don't want him to take any more hits, hits that he has to.


Right. Considering Ocho, I'm gonna hand him the ball 20 times and throw it to him another five to 10 times. So I'm trying to keep trying to keep him as a, a, as fresh as I possibly can given that we're so dependent on him. Right. Because they're, you know, the, the play action is huge in San Francisco. Like I said, I played for Kyle dad and so I know that offense, the Giants guy smoked at home by Sam Donald and the bikers, it took the Giants, You ain't had to say it like that. It took the Giants defense one minute and 15 seconds remaining, remaining in the first half to force an incompletion. Man. They had, they had Sam Don out there looking like Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes and Peyton man.


Hey Sam. Donna was on fire boy. Sam Donald was on fire. And listen, I'm, I'm happy for Sam, you know, 'cause obviously you are on your four team. Yeah. Things didn't work out in San Francisco. Things didn't work out in Carolina. Things didn't work out in New York. You was in San Francisco last year. Yeah. He was back at the party. Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm happy for him. I'm happy. I'm happy he's looking like that because all you're doing is you string you're gonna string together some games. JJ McCarthy is out what, for the whole year, right? Yes. Listen, this, this, this, this is your time to shine because this might be another opportunity, another stepping stone. If you put together a good season with jj, well, You know, he ain't gonna be there, but he putting a season together from somewhere else.


Yeah. Bingo. He, he, he have opportunity to be a starter again somewhere else. Yeah. I'm, I'm happy for him. Woo. Man. Lord Ocho What, what's wrong? You all right? The Saints beat the Panthers 47 to 10. Bryce Young was accept intercepted on the first play and started the second half with another. His new targets didn't help. The defense stunk it up. Are the Panthers and second year quarterback Bryce Young, really as bad as they look? Hold on before you answer that. 31 31 3 Halftime deficit by Canales was the second largest for a coach in his first game since Brian Flores and the Dolphins. Trell 42 to 10 to Baltimore in 2019. Remember that was the year Lamar won the MVP unanimously Ocho.


I don't know what's wrong. We can't blame, we can't blame it on Dave. He just, he Dave just got there. Mr. Canis. Mr. Canis just got there. Okay. Who, who do we blame this on? I'm just, I'm just asking and I'm not gonna say it's weak one. I ain't gonna do that. I'm not gonna say that. So who we blame it on? Oh man. Hey, you can't start Look you on the road. You can't start the game with an interception. Interception. Yeah. You can't come out in the second half and start the game with another interception. Right. You can't do that because your team is not good at over, aren't good enough to overcome it. Overcome those kind of mises. Right. I'm trying, trying to pull them, pull them up right here. Here they go right here.


They trying to hide Ocho. I don't blame them. Oh, man. Yeah, they were, were they, they were good and take up a little Show. Hey, EE Xavier Legett. Am I, am I saying his name right? Yeah. Who's the other receiver on the other side? Well, they got rid of Terrence Marshall. You remember him from He was on that national championship team down in LSU? Yeah. Okay. Nah, they yeah, they, they got, they got, they gotta help. They gotta, they gotta, they gotta get some, some weapons in there from my dog.


Man, they gotta get some weapons in there for Bryce. Oh, they got Adam Thilan. Okay. They that's right. Th the Thena plays in the slot. Xavier Legett And who, who's the, who's the, who's, who's the number two Mingle? They got Deontay Johnson. Remember Deontay Johnson from Pittsburgh? Oh wait, they got Deontay for the Steelers over there? Yep. Okay. We got something we can, we got something we can cook with Bryce Young. Andy Dalton even came in. Bryce Young was 13 or 31. 61 207 ships, four sack. Mm. They didn't look good. I mean, O ocho it, it doesn't look good. It didn't look good. It hadn't looked good in a long, long time.


Yeah. David Teer doesn't seem to be a guy that has a lot of patients. Who's the owner of the team? Hey, if I'm not mistaken, I think he fired, wouldn't he? Didn't he get rid of riverboat Ron? Yeah. Got rid of Ron Rivera hired Matt Rule fired Matt Rule. Who was the guy last year? Oh, didn't Steve Wilkes and, and didn't, didn't hire him and everybody wanted him. And so now he got canals, man. Okay. What, what you think he gonna get canals what, two years? Three Cops? Damn. And you ain't turning, you ain't turning no entire franchise around in oh two, three years.


I know that. No, It's possible once you have that centerpiece, Bryce Young be, if, if Bryce Young is the answer, you know, if, is he, is he your franchise quarterback or Is they're probably like, damn, we had a chance to get CJ s Strau because whoever went first and they, the other guy was going second. Well, you definitely couldn't pass up Bryce Young with the season he had with Alabama. Yeah. I mean that, that the Two seasons. Yeah, for sure. I agree. So I agree. Putting them pieces around him. He you gonna be all right. But I, you know what? I think they gonna be fine. I think they gonna be fine. I mean if you look at Baker, he left the Panthers, he's playing really, really well.


Yeah, in Tampa now. Tampa do have more weapons. They got Mike Edwards. Yeah, they got Chris Godwin. They got a nice, you know I love Todd Bowles. That defense plays outstanding. Yeah, they got some nice pieces. Sam. Darn you look at what he, he played really well today. Like look Baker, we saw what Baker and parlayed that into a nice contract. Baker played well last year. They won the division last year. So Baker is playing really well and earned the contract that he's got. Right. And he played really well today. Joe Brady, he was a oc He leaves, he's calling a good game elsewhere. Something, something going on O Joe, what's going on? I don't know.


I don't know. Everybody leave there and everybody do good once they leave. I, I, I don't, I I don't Know every, everybody do be everybody do better once they leave. Yeah. Once they outta there. Once they outta there, I don't, ugh, now, hey, listen, it's, it's so early. I'm not gonna overreact. I'm not gonna overreact. But what we saw today, what I saw today from the Panthers is basically what I saw last year. Yes, I agree. And, and I, I hope as a young quarterback, especially for Bryce Young, I hope he hasn't lost his confidence because you know, once you lose that confidence, UNC is hell to get it back.


Yeah, It is, it is hell to get it back. You question yourself, you know you want you one, you won you one step off, you know, wanting to throw it, you hesitate, you question it. That's once you lose that conversation. I mean they made some, it is whole, it sucks. If you think about it, Ocho you look at what it did, they basically gave Christian McCaffery away. Yeah. Same thing with Brian Burns. I think some team offered offered 'em two first rounds for Brian Burns. They end up taking like, what, what'd they give, what'd they give for Brian Burns? Somebody offered 'em two firsts. They said nah, we good. I think it was might've been the Rams. I think the Rams offered 'em two first for Brian Burns who offered 'em two firsts.


Somebody did. They ended up trading him to the Giants and didn't get nearly that you, you let, you let 49 ERs police you for Chris cmac. Yeah, they, they ran cmac into the damn ground. They, The Rams offered two first round picks and a second for Brian Burns And they said no. Who's in Carolina? What did they trade him for? Watch this. Watch. Watch what you find out what they got for him. Who made, who made that decision over there? Mr. Temple. The Rams had two firsts and a second. They take traded to the Giants for a second and a fifth.


They must, it must be something personal. I don't know what it is because see normally the ev a even swap isn't a swindle. Right. They got swindle on this one. Yeah. That's why I said he didn't wanna, he didn't wanna help out. Mr. What's the, what's what's, what's the owner name over there? Stan? Stan k Cranky. Yeah. They they might be beefing Ocho We could be beefing, but if you wanna win, you need capital. You need players, you need good players. Yeah. You don't have good Players. Yeah, he probably wasn't thinking about that. I mean 2 1 2, 2 ones and a two, bro. You supposed to jump on. You Supposed and you trading for a two in a five. Yeah, you supposed to. So it tells me you don't, you don't know the hell you're doing. Yeah. Oh, you ain't take, you ain't taking winning Serious. How about that?


So, I mean, you release Cam Kiley didn't do your solid 'cause Kiley retired. Yeah. He had, you know, had issues. Yeah. Kiley had many years left. He left. So he was the So you lose when one year you lost the two heartbeats of your team. Team. Yeah. Cam and Kiley. Damn Smitty. You let Smitty go Smitty. So Yeah, the, they, they need, they need to and, and the what the, the quickest way OCHO is to is through the draft first round picks. Yeah. Just think about it. You got first round picks.


Now granted, you gave up your first round pick when you traded a for Bryce. Right? But you needed that to restock it. Damn. And yeah, David Teper who, but you know, when you got a lot of money and you try to run every, it's hard here. It's hard in this league is, it'll humble you. Is he a football guy? Is Mr. Tepa a football guy? Does he have a football background to actually What he's going? Well that's why, that's why I hired Matt Rule. Gave him, gave him seven, eight years, Fired him and then, and then you find him. Then what you call him comes in. Do, did really, really well for you.


Steve Wils. Right? Let him go too. Oh, oh.

Josh Allen's second Russian touchdown. Today was a leaping effort in the end zone over Budha Baker. But after leaping over Bakker Allen landed on his left hand around the ball underneath and appeared to hurt his hand and the bills went on to win 34 28. Alan led the bills to three scores in the second half. A touchdown with nine players catching a pass in 10 on and 10 targeted. Alan joined Steve Young as the only players to have multiple rushing and passing touchdowns in four games. Ocho what you thinking? Is it gonna be okay? Josh Allen ain't gonna be okay. He was 18 or 23. 2 32 2 touchdowns. No interception did have two sacks. Yeah, but he took care of the football.


Yeah, he didn't. He didn't. He didn't turn the ball over. No. Keon Coleman had four catches for 51 yards. Shaki had three for 42. James Cook three for 32. Cook had 19 rushes, 31 yards. Josh Allen had nine carriers for 39 yards and two touchdowns. So what's going on? Is it gonna be okay for Allen? Yeah, I, I think it's gonna be fine. I think it's gonna be fine. The one issue that we've always talked about, we know him being a dual threat, being able to throw the ball, being able to run the ball. He showed that today. But the most important thing for Josh Allen, something that he's done in the regular season. Something that he's done in the postseason. The turnovers. The turnovers have always been costly and they've always come at the opport the wrong time.


They've always come at the wrong time. Yes. And it's good. That's Always his problem. Yeah, it, it is. It is good to see him, you know, to be able to get the win to go out there and do what we know he can do with his legs. And. we know he can, he can throw the ball. I'm sure there He did have one frontal, lemme take that back. Ocho. He did have a fumble. He lost a fumble. Josh Allen did lose a fumble. Wait, did They So they he had one turnover. They Didn't get that back. He lost it. Damn. They, they, they gonna, they gonna have those, those those passing days. Today one today wasn't one of those days. We just sling the ball all over the place. You throw it 40, 50 goddamn times, put it through air.


Keon Coleman gonna be good. He gonna be, he gonna, he he gonna be nice. He gonna be nice Before the game. Keon Coleman revealed the chores he hates more than anything. Let's take a listen to what he had to say. Ocho Chores. A lot of you guys don't do chores, but let's not bring it back to number one is worst number number five is not. Oh yeah. That goes so one as you don't want one. Nah, nah, hate doing this. You just put them in a dishwasher. This is dishes wouldn't be too bad. Put a hair, grew up with a dishwasher.

But see I'm, I'm a sweater. Ocho, I'm a sweater. Okay, Okay, okay. Okay. That, that's, that's Understandable. I'm a sweater. Ocho. Yes Sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. Hey, you think, you think old girl a fighter? Because I be enough. She be ding my face one than me. You know what I'm saying? Don't you?


I'm a, I'm a fighter. Right. That ain't stop though. Yeah, You gotta have that AC on man. Oh yeah, for sure. Oh yes. 65. 65. Ooh. See all the Seattle Seahawks beat the Broncos. 26 20. The Seahawks frustrated Bo Nicks and often kept him throwing off his back. But before he wanted to, Nicks was clearly wobble. Sunday early interception two miss on two other Miss picks two sacks in the first half. But Peyton kept calling passes by the, by halftime. Nicks was averaging three yards per attempt on 22 throws, the Bronco had run 16 times.


Nick's best moment didn't come until late in the fourth quarter when he rushed for a four yard touchdown after the game of reporter tweeted absolutely horrendous game from, from Nick. Nick horrible. I left felt the game been rough and a blowout for sure, but it definitely didn't expect him to look this bad. Every positively I praise for him is gone. Bad footwork, widely inaccurate reading too. Reading this out. Too slow, unsafe with the football. Everything ho's just the first game, JIT, either way we'll see a against. Hold on. They play pit, they play the stadium. Well, good luck. It's gonna look the same goddamn damn, damn way. What playing Hope they play in Denver, pat. He responded.


Honestly, this is what I expected. Not going to lie. So fle, this is part of the game. Stuff happens. He played great so quick to hate on someone to go on social media and talk about it. That part of the process man is pathetic. Well listen, you have to understand Bo Nicks, you know, they, they sat there, they watched him in the preseason, they crying on him. He looks so good. You know, you're scrambling around. Yeah. You're making plays, you're making throws. You look good. You're not understanding, you're not going against the ones you going against the twos and the threes. You're going against some of the people that's not even going to make the team. That's what, that's what people have to understand. And then the plays that are being, being called defensively, everything is very vanilla. You got cover one, you got cover two, you got cover three, you got cover four.


That's It. Ain't nobody getting exotic. Ain't nobody, ain't nobody Exotic. You Ain't, man, listen. Now you see, this is what happened. You got the ones, this is why you need to play in the preseason. But the, the bad thing about it is Bo Knicks doesn't know what it was gonna look like until you're going against the ones. Now you see everything is speeding up a little bit. Now you see you have to process information a little bit faster. Now you see you gotta get that ball out your hand. Oh yeah. They coming And, and listen, if you think the Seahawks was coming at you now wait till you gotta see the Steelers next week and you got TJ Watt Hi Smith Man. Come on now. Listen, as as a rookie quarterback, you're gonna have some growing pains.


But this is one of the reasons why it's good for rookie quarterbacks to sit behind a veteran for a year to get acclimated to learn, become a sponge, and then transition into playing in their second year. Now they just throw you out there to the wolves. They throw you out to the wolves. And when you lose your confidence as a young quarterback, that young, or I'm, and listen, I already know how hard it is to get your confidence back as a receiver. So I can imagine being not only a captain, but the leader of the team and the throw of the ball. And you got everybody to, depending on you. Sh well you better than me.


Boy. The Texans go on the road and they beat the coach. The Texans scored 29 points. But the defense allowed an a coach quarterback Anthony Richardson to have three completions of 50 or plus more yards. Richardson had a 60 yard touchdown, which was a thing of beauty. He threw it off his back foot. ocho. Yeah. Why receiver Alex Pierce, Andy Slipped And a 50 and a 54 yard touchdown to Aston doula in the fourth quarter. CJ Stro was pressured on 38% of his drop back and sacked four times. That's something that would have to be fixed. Texan wanted to keep Stroud healthy throughout the season. Mixon was the best player on the field. He finished with 159 yards rushing and a touchdown.


He helped the Texans offense on keep this Texans offense on schedule when the passing game was a little bit shaky. He played unbelievable. We always thought he was gonna be big Dip, played big dividends because he could run the football and he can catch it outta the backfield. He's a really solid guy. I think the Bengals are gonna miss him. Ocho Yeah, I understand that. The, you know, salary cap issues. But I like this edition with him because you got Stroud, you got digs and you saw Digs had two, two touchdowns today. The tds. Yeah. You got Nico Collins, you got Tank Dale Dalton Schultz. They're really Yeah, really good. They got great defense. You know Defense Stingley Jr.


They got Will Anderson Jr. They got some players over there. Oh yeah. The Texas, the Texas is gonna be good for a minute. They're gonna be good for a minute. But I like what, what, what, what did you like, what did you like what you saw from the Texas? I mean they, they showed flashes. Think Dale showed flashes of brilliance. Digs showed his flashes. And Nico Collins as well. Obviously the Colts. The Colts. They pressured CJ Schau so much and made him uncomfortable. You know, we, I didn't, we didn't get to see the CJ Schau but used to seeing, to be able to drop back to process your information, you know, to read, read your read your, your number one region, number two, region number number three, and be able to make the throws.


They always, they always kept, they kept him on the run. Listen, the the Colts have a good defense. The Cols have a good defense. They, and so listen, they, I'm about, I'm talking about I getting ready to say the Cols, they goddamn damn Texans were able to get the win. They, they have to fix that offensive line they got. They have to fix the, the leaks, the little leaks in the offensive line that, that has CJ Shroud running for a damn life sometimes. Other than that, they, they gonna be fine. Yeah. I like, like I said, the Texas man, they gonna be players. They got a young team buried. They got a young coach. They believe in him. The city believes in him. The players believe in that quarterback.


They got some receivers, they got a nice running back. We're mixer now the offensive line defensively. They're gonna be, they're gonna be tough. They're gonna be tough. Now they need to put this thing together Ocho. 'cause you know you saw Dak now Dak got 60 million. Yeah, CJ Strides gonna be available for a contract extension in another two years. So he'll probably be, he About to get 65 million Probably. Yeah, probably 65. And he would be, And and then you, you still got digs, digs contract is up after this year. Yeah. Do you resign him got they just who they just, they just gave money to who? Tank. Tank Dale. One of the guys just got money. Nico, I don't know if it's Collins or Dale. Probably Nico. Man. Dale is only in his second year. Okay.


And then guess what? Will Anderson Jr. Oh yeah. Hey Stingley Jr. Oh. Stingley up next. Stingley gonna say Yeah, for sure. Stingley, Stingley gonna reset the market at, at, at at, at the, at the defensive back position. He gonna reset the market. He nice boy. Yeah. Huh? Stingy you nice? Oh yeah, for sure. He nice. But I like look man, it, it's early and he didn't get a chance. But when Richardson develop a little more touch and realize that he don't have to throw everything through the hurricane. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because he can make every throw. I'm talking about when you say son, you, you don't normally wanna see a guy throwing a ball from one side all the way to the other.


The other. Yeah. But he got more than enough arm. Oh yeah. Oh man, he was making some throws today and a big physical kid. They had him stopped on the gold line. He said man, I'm going in the end zone later for y'all get off me. He bull ass rattled the right on in the end zone, don't you? You big Dude. Big dude man. Yeah, yo. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is he about six four? About two 50. So basically like Cam, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You right. You right. But man, that joke arm, Woo, that joke got an strong arm. Yeah, he do. Yeah man, man, I I, I like, I like, I like, I like the kid. Like I said, he'll develop some touch as time goes on, but hey, he got some nice receivers.


He didn't, I mean, Pitman Jr. Really didn't get that involved and you know, and they, they still got a a p they got dueling, they got Mo, ally Cox, Jonathan Taylor, they, they, they did a great job of bothering him up. But Richardson had six for 56 on a touchdown. But they, they, but they, they get, they get Jonathan Taylor going. It opens up everything else. The fact that the fact that they wasn't, they were able to contain Jonathan Taylor. And he and you still was able to throw No, the two deep passes. One you slipped and still was able to get it out there. Right in stride in the bread basket. Goddamn damn arm strong as hell.


Oh yeah. Richards the only completed nine passes OCHO for 212 yards. He was nine or 19. That's crazy. But Like I said, once he, once he developed a little touch Ocho. Yeah, he gonna be all right Because that kid, hey, that kid got, that young man got an arm. I mean he can make every throw just a little touch. You don't have to throw everything through the I of a hurricane. You gonna be fine. I, I mean, I like him, I like him a lot. Caleb Williams be became the first number one overall quarterback to win his career. Start since David Carr won way back in Texas. Two. Yep. Yeah.


Come from behind win. He was the first to win his debut David car in 2002. But he didn't look, he didn't look that comfortable. Ocho I mean they, they they won the game. Yeah. He was run around. He was run around for his life too now. Yeah. He was running around for his life. If I'm not Justin Field, say I know what that feels like. Yeah. I, I forgot, I forgot the stat. They didn't did What, what? I don't think he had a hundred yards passing. He didn't, he didn't have, he didn't throw a touchdown. He had, he was 14 or 29 for 93 yards. Yeah, they got a block 0.4 touchdown. Touchdown. They got a pick six, four touchdown, touchdown. And they got another, they got another turtle will Levi through.


He shouldn't have ocho he shouldn't have done that. How Many times you heard me say Don't make a, don't make a bad play worse. Take the sack son. Yeah, Yeah. He was trying to make something. He was trying to make Something happen. It's another day he made it happen for the Bears. You see, that's what he wanted. Yeah. You say he wanted, he tried to make something happen. He made it happen for the Bears. Yeah, he, he, he, he wanted that, he wanted that The Bears won the game despite generating 148 yards of total offense. Special team. They had three field goals by Cairo. Santos, a block punt that safety. Jonathan Owens and a pick six look, he won.


I think Kyle Murray in his rookie season. I think he tied in 20, whether 20 19, 20 19, I think 20 19, 20 20 when they tied, I think they tied Detroit. But all the rest of the number one overall picks, quarterbacks have lost in between 20 2002 in 2024. And Caleb Williams and, and David Carr were the only two to win that. The win number one overall draft pick. Yeah. So give give him credit for that. They, they were able to pull this off. Chicago's defense looked really, really good. Very, That defense looked really, really good. You know, he missed Keenan Allen. He had Keenan Allen Port touchdown.


He overshot Kenan A Williams there in The end zone. But look, Kenan Allen dropped one too now. Yep. Look, Look outright right in the end zone. But they'll, they'll, they'll get it fixed. They'll, they'll, they'll get that, get that comfortable and, but Caleb Williams wins his debut.

Ocho. Three years after Kindred Lamar guested during the Dr. Dre Super Bowl halftime performance. He'll headline his own halftime show. Yeah. At Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans, rap music is the most impactful genre to date. Yeah. And I'll be there to remind the world why Lamar said in the statement they got the right one. How they not at Lil Wayne gotta have. Look. Congratulations, Kendrick. Yeah. Congratulate, listen, congratulations. Kendrick a, a phenomenal talent. But how you in New Orleans Yeah.

When it comes to people that headline the Super Bowl, I always think about who has the visibility and can, can, can be relatable to all demographics that are going to be watching.


And that first thing I thought was, well, listen, it is in New Orleans. I mean a no brainer from a business standpoint, LA Wayne. And it just made sense. So, I mean, Kendrick Lamar, based on what he's done, his accolades and, and him being on the run that, you know, he's been on this year, I kind of understand it. I get it. I get it. And I, I think, I think Kendrick, Kendrick Lamar will probably do Right. And have a feature or have Lil Wayne as well. I'm, I'm thinking, I mean, I'm just throwing it out there, But you got it. You got it. Look, man, come, come on, Ocho. It's just like, how you gonna come to LA and not have Snoop DL double G. Right. How you gonna come and you don't have Dre. Right.

Yeah. A lot of people say, look, no matter what you think, but Wayne, probably he top five, he in my top five. Yeah. A lot of people got him as the goat and for him not, look, I look, you know, a lot of people I just saying were Jay-Z responsible for this because, you know, they allowed Jay-Z to pick like who's gonna be there. But Lil Wayne got be there in some capacity right now. Whether or not he excel, you know, he gotta be, he gotta be ocho. Yeah. Does Jay-Z have anything to do with that? Yeah, I ain't, I didn't, I didn't. I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

Yeah. Don't really talk to him that much now, but I know that would've meant the world to Him. World to him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would've meant the world, The halftime show. Yeah. To have that kind of eye, that kind of visibility. At, At home, at home, at that. Yeah. At home. Damn. So. All right, Ocho now it's time.

Nobody saw this coming. You know, I was, I had a, our club Sheha was doing really, really well, but Kat Williams took me to another level. Yeah. And you know, a lot of things, they see the commercials. We have major, major sponsors now. Ocho, everybody ain't happy. Like everybody ain't happy about that Ocho everybody's not happy about that. That's fine. Listen, everybody. Oh man, y'all doing good. But y'all all try, try to undermine It. One, one thing about it, what God got for you can't nobody take that away, huh? They can't, can't nobody take that away. You can hate all you want. You can say what you want. They can't, you can't take that away. Nope. Nope. Shout out guys. If you haven't watched it.


Marlon Williams podcast is up right now doing an unbelievable number. It was a great sit down to hear him talk about his journey, his family journey in living color, things they doing. It's great. Appreciate that. Marlon, the sit down, been trying to put this thing together. I had reached out to him probably about two and a half years ago. Mm. And he said, bro, I, I ain't really got nothing to talk about. He said, but when I have something to talk about, I'm gonna come sit down with you. And so I appreciate the sit down, Marlon. I, I think he has a comedy, a comedy thing coming out here, but I'm gonna make sure I get that posted when I, when I find out more information on that. So appreciate you guys for supporting that. You guys have been unbelievable with the views, the retweets and things of that nature.


But again, thank you Marlon for that Lainey Ray, hold up. You mean to tell me you in tonight, Lainey? Because you know the other night Ocho, she was out by jukebox. Yeah, she was at the bar. She was at the bar. Yeah. Yeah. She getting a little drink, get a little drinky drink. Lainey Ray said, Hey guys, which team or games surprise you the most today? Good or bad? Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise. Well, listen, I, I I, it wasn't even a surprise. I, I had the Bengals of Wind, but we start out, oh, oh. And one, we start out oing one out the gate. We start out Oing two out the gate. But we finna be the chiefs there. There wasn't no surprises. Really?


Me. It was the, it was, it, it wasn't, I think I was more surprised by how thoroughly New England dominated Cincinnati. Yeah. Especially on the ground. Man, they ran down our throat. I'm like, what? Man, what's up? I, I didn't, and here and also Ocho, I didn't, at no point in time once that where the tight end tried to get, get to the end zone, the guy, old guy punched it Out and he peanut punched it. Yeah. At no point in time after that did I think Cincinnati was gonna win that game Win. I didn't. Damn. They did a, they did an unbelievable job. So that's why I would, that's where I would have to go. Glad you're back, Laney. Stay away from the bar.


Dr. Frank l Bellamy said, who's got a tougher challenge? A high powered offense facing must stand your defense or a struggling defense trying to stop a red hot quarterback. The struggling defense trying to Stop a red hot Quarterback. Quarterback. And he gonna probably like that. You know what up? Completely. Yeah. Yeah. Doc, doc, look. High powered offense. Look, a great throw gonna be the great coverage. But if you struggling defensively Yeah. And you got a red hot quarterback, you get you, you best running and run up against a Patrick Mahomes, the guy that can spin the ball. Yeah. Where going You ain't gonna be, hell gonna be hell for you.


Darren g Ocho, please start referring to a great defense play as a snooze fan. We understand you played offense, but some of us appreciate great defense. Right? But when you have great defense for a fan that loves the game of football, it's a snooze fest. That that's, that's what it is. As, as with all due respect, when you have two teams that are playing great defense, like we saw tonight, the first, the first and second quarter of the Rams in Lions game. It was a snooze fest until things open up offensively for both teams. I'm just being honest. You want just being honest. You want you, you, you like, you're the guy that wanna go to the baseball game.


You don't wanna see a two, A two, one game. You wanna see nine, eight. Yeah. You wanna see 10 11. I need to see you go to a basketball game. You wanna see 1 25 to 1 28. Now you See, you remember, you see how I went to go watch the, the, the 76 ERs play and just so happened the game I went to and B dropped 70 and I came on the show. God damn excited. What's the chances of me seeing that again? What's the chance of me seeing 70 again? Ain't ain't ain't good. I ain't been to a basketball game since. Yeah, I mean you gotta think about throughout history, there's only probably been about 12 of those. And the NBA like 77, 78 years of age. So you see one probably what, 12 in the, and so probably one every six years.


Mm. I mean you've seen more. Devin Booker has a 70, Dame has a 70, Luca has a 70. Yeah, Joel has a 70. So you've probably seen four 70 point games in the past five years than you saw in the previous 30 years. Right now just, that's just the way it is. Ke Norwood Jr. Who is rookie of the year, who is this, this year's class will have a breakout season. Who in this year? Who in this rookie, in this year's class will have a breakout season? Like Brock Purdy did Breakout season. Rookie. I guess he's talking about, I guess I, I he didn't mention quarterback, but he just mentioned Purdy.


Well I guess he's thinking about who's going to be like, be like, we'll have a breakout season like Purdy, but Purdy breakout season was two years ago. Yeah. So who's gonna have that breakout type of season? Damn. I don't think any of the quarterbacks. Nah, because ain't no court. Hell no. Really? No quarterback went to a team like what F San Francisco had. Think about what San Francisco had. They had Deebo. They had iu. iu, they had a powerful running game. Ray Williams. They had Kittle. Yeah. So Jennings. So the likelihood of somebody having that outstanding defense to support that Kera? That's a, that's a good question, man.


I, I really, really don't know. 'cause I don't really see as far as quarterback, I don't know who has that kind of supporting cast around them to be able to, to, to be able to do that. I'm trying to think. Ru running back. Maybe Jayden. Maybe Jayden. Daniels a a cable. Yeah. Well, Jayden, Daniel. Yeah. But the thing is you could, you could see that he only gonna be able to do so much. Yeah. He, I mean he, they don't have an offensive line. What the 49 ERs got had had. Well they had, they had Trip Williams let yo True. Well he was, he was done with them after they did what they did to him after.


Who just told, what was the guy's name? Dan Snyder. After they did what they did to him, he wasn't playing there no more. He was a rapper. Huh. And plus, you know, Kyle was there. He was there with Kyle. He knew Kyle. Oh. So It made that Much easier. Can you imagine, you know who tried to get him? Who? Kansas City. Can you imagine Trent? That wouldn't be fair. That wouldn't be fair. That wouldn't be fair. So Stephanie Warfield said, who you rooting for in the southern classic Tennessee State or Arkansas? Pine buff. I gotta go with my golden lions. Also.
