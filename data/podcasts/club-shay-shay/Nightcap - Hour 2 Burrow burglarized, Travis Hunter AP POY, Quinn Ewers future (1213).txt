Oh, Joe. Joe Burrow made some noise this week by indicating he'll play a role in helping push the Bengals to resign. T Higgins, the franchise tag wide receiver who has been viewed as a, like, as likely to leave in 2025. Yeah. Said he would like to stay, but did not offer much confidence. He resigned. Jamar Chase chimed in and said T deserves to be here. He wants to be here. It's all about how they wanna play it. Yeah. T has parted ways with his agent David mug. Yeah. I don't know who he, who he signed with Ocho. You know, Joe had a situation where after the, during the game his home was invaded. Yeah. Joe, as someone that's been through that, yes. You feel like your privacy has been invaded by the worst way.


Somebody came into your home, uninvited, went through ramble through. I don't know if they take, took anything. And like you said, Joe, you know, you, you know, you play, you ask to be a professional athlete to be in this role, but it doesn't make it easier. Yeah. And it seems to be something that's reoccurring ocho. Yeah. And they said it's a gang that came up from South America and they're targeting athletes while they're play. 'cause if you play, you clearly you're not home. Right. In the likelihood of somebody being there because hey, family, friends and loved ones, they're gonna be at the game watching you. So this is the best time. And you know, it's a, it's a coordinated attack. Yeah. But I don't wish bad on nobody.


But I'm gonna tell you, like my grandma used to say, but I don't wish bad on nobody. Right. I don't wish good on 'em either. So if, and I saw two today at his press conference, say he's had armed security. Right. Say y y'all might need to think, y'all might need to think twice. Joe Burrow issued a statement addressing the burglary that occurred at his Cincinnati area home while the Bengals were on the road to face the Cowboys. I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one and is already out there. And I want, I would want out there. And that's care more than I care to share. We live a public life. One of the least favorite parts of that is the lack of privacy. Agreed. And that's been difficult for me to deal with my entire career.


Tua announced that he has hired armed security to guard his house. Just let it be known they are armed. And I hope if you decide to go to my house, you think twice. Oh man. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's crazy, huh? It's crazy. We, we, we, we are in different times. We're we're, we're in different times as people. We're in different times economically. And you know, people are doing what's necessary to, I I, I don't even know. I I don't even know the way to put it. They're taking chances. They're taking a life, they're taking a life altering chances to take from others and their hard work, you know, and they willing to do whatever.


And I'm willing to do whatever to protect, Hey, Listen, eye for eye, you know? But man, that, that's unfortunate. And, and back back to the situation with obviously contractually from, from a business standpoint, it, it's impossible. IIII love the words that all the players are saying about T one to stay. And I'm sure we have a lot of Bengal fans in the chat. I think it would be unfair to t it would be unfair to Jamar Chase, who is, is is due a, a hefty, a hefty deal, you know? Oh yeah. And I think it's, I think it's also knowing from a business standpoint, it's impossible to pay Chase and t it's impossible to pay Chase what he's worth and pay t what he is worth as well.


And still having the same, at some point, the person that would be getting the shit end of the stick is t Higgins. I think t Higgins deserves to go to a team where he can be the number one guy. It could be his show and he can get the money that he deserves as a number one receiver, which I see him as. I love the thought of t still being there, but the way the business works, you can't afford both of 'em. You just can't. I know Joe, Joe Burrow is saying all the right things and I would love to see both of 'em stay there. But it's just impossible. It's just impossible. It's just impossible because of the type of receiver that t Higgins is. You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't take a hometown discount. You don't take a pay cut because you only get so many chances.


Not the first Ocho not the first contract. No, not the first. You don't take no pay cut. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you wanna take one down the road. Yes. You done stack some chips. Yeah. And we wanna try to keep this thing together with the championship. Yeah, but not the first one. No. The first one. No. I'm trying to get every dime I possibly Can. You, you got to, you got to unc because you listen with this game, with this game of football, you need your security and you're getting older. You don't get younger. It's not going based. It's not going backwards. Yeah. So you, you listen as much as I love the thought of t stand there, like he deserves his money, the right money, not just anything. Now we just gonna throw you this and May and see if you gonna be happy. Nah, come on. Nah, Hell nah man. You can't, you can't do him like that. You can't do him like that.


Yeah. Nah. Hey, so, and Joe's like, Hey, my privacy been invaded. Hey, because I think little Shay wanted to call the police. Joe didn't want y'all to know about that shot. Oh, We had a little short over there. Yeah. You had a little something over there. You know, he over there come home, you Know. Okay. Okay. 30 in the morning. Okay. You know, honey, I'm home. Yeah. You know, you know Joe, Joe going hand me something. JoeGon hand him a knife. Man. I don't blame him, but he don't want people to know. Right. Right. Privacy. That's The pro bingo because Guess what? They sports illustrated or somebody model. Right. Call the police. Oh, I, they had to put that. Just say somebody called the police. Right. Right. Oh, they did. That's All y'all had To do.


Oh, they did. Oh. They, you know, you gotta leave your name now. You know, when you call 9 1 1, you gotta think, who am I, who am I speaking to? Ah, your big neck mammy. Yeah. And hey, that, that's how it got out. But listen, that, that's the life, that's the life you live, man. That's the life to live. It's a price. It's a price you pay for Fame and being who you are. Yeah. Derrick Henry dropped the dreads for braids. Twitter said he was like, Omar on the wire. Fans are saying he lost all his aura. What you think Ocho I Mean, we gonna see, we gonna see if he lost his or come Sunday. We, we, we are. You don't The man Samson.


I don't Yeah, I was just gonna say, is he like, Samson, we going, we gonna, we gonna find out. I highly doubt it because I don't think him running the ball and being, being as good as he is has anything to do with them. Dreads. It might be a good thing he might be lighter. Yeah. You ain't gotta worry about nobody tackling because you hey, because you know, guys tackle you. Because it used to be devil's penalty. If you tackle somebody now, oh, now, now Being your uniform of your uniform, uniform, uniform. If it's ha if it's hanging, if it's hanging out, you got them helmet. It is part of your uniform. You could pull it Uniform. Yeah. I know that's painful for you. Running one way. If somebody pull you, Hey, hey, you jump on.


Hey Ojo, you jump on on a fight. What you want me to do, bro? That's you. I I grabbed your jersey. I was trying to grab your jersey. Yeah. But I don't know how them guys, I mean some of that stuff ojo, they, they that the, they hair covered his name. Yeah. I think that damn it back. Yeah. You know, most of the time I think the, the, it's a larger percentage of players with dreads that's covering their name, that play on the defensive side of the ball. Oh yeah. Yes It is. Yeah. I like, I Like it. I think somebody tackled Troy Paul Malu by his number. Remember? I remember that he on the interception, he had got an interception but picked up a fumble of summer and he pulled his hair. Yeah. Yep. I remember that. Yeah. So Quinn Ewers is reportedly debating on returning to college football or, and, and forgoing the NFL draft yet again.


However, Texas is reportedly ready to move on to Arch Madding next season. Yeah. Which we point Ewers to enter the transfer portal. Mm. Many NFL scouts reportedly believe yours could benefit from another year college. Mm. Yours has one more year of eligibility left on it. And most likely it will be spent on another top 10 team. The long harms quarterback has a decision to make. Yeah. Oh, they moving on. He, He, he know good and well, he might as well go into the portal. 'cause Texas is arch man and team from now on. Yep. So I'm not sure where you can go. There'll be many, many suitors for him. Especially with the NIL money where he can come and, and try to help lead them to a national championship. Go to Ohio State.


Well, you gotta be careful now you got, you gotta be careful if you go to Ohio State, you have to understand who the quarterbacks are that are already there. Are you able to beat them out? Are you better than what they already have at Ohio State? You know? Isn't Di Dylan Gabriel? Isn't he a senior? Oh, go To Oregon. Yeah. Go shit. Take take ass Oregon. They, they, they put it in the air. But you gotta be, you gotta make sure, you gotta make sure you can beat out whoever's already there if you can't or you gonna be stuck. Well, he ain't gonna be stuck. He ain't gonna be stuck at, at, at, at what you call it in Texas. Nah, nah. 'cause they going to Arch. Yeah. I mean he knows that. I mean, it might be a situation where they encourage him Yeah. To enter the portal. Yeah. I I, I think, I think he can read the room.


He could, he could read the room. Yeah. Oh, Joe Travis Hunter is the associate AP college football player of the year. Right. Felic. So he received 26 or 2343 volts on a panel of AP top 25 voters. Hunter kept piling up the hardware. He also won the Walter Camp Player of the Year award along with the Chuck Mcna Award as top receiver and the Biletnikoff Award. Yeah. No, the Chuck Mcna as a top defensive player and the Biletnikoff Award as the top receiver. And, and he should have won the Thorpe Award. Yeah. Yeah. Matter of Fact. But they didn't want, because if he'd won that, nobody else, I don't believe another player would've ever won the these w Right.


Well that's, that's not, that's not the only one. He, he got one more coming too now. Oh Yeah, yeah. He got, he got one more. He got one more coming. Yeah. That's some, that's some good hardware too before the draft. That's some real hardware. Oh, Joe, the, the Thorpe understand how that looks. I'm not saying let's just say for the sake of argument with ocho. Right. He doesn't win the award. Right. But do you know how that looks when you don't have him as a finalist? Yeah. And he just won the Chuck Nerrick as the top defensive player Yeah. Of the year. If, if, if DB not on the defensive side of the football ocho Listen, they, they don't know what they doing. They, they don't know what they're doing. Okay. We can't give them everything. We can't give them. Why do you can't? I mean, because they didn't, you, you, you, you, you know, you know how they are.


Yeah. You know how the people are, the people that are in positions of power. You know, we, we gonna find a way, we gonna find a way around it. We gonna find some type of excuse. And I would love, I would love to hear the reasoning behind whoever makes the decision on whether he wins it or not. Why wouldn't you give it to him? What's the gripe? Did you watch him play? Do you actually understand the game of football and what he was able to do this season adds a defensive back. No. Come on now. It's always personal. It's always personal. He had a phenomenal season. Yeah. He had a phenomenal season.


An Ohio politician has seen enough of flag planning by visiting sport, visiting sports team Republican state. Josh William said Wednesday on social media, he's introducing a bill to make flag planning in sports a felony in the state. Ooh. His proposal comes after November 30th. Fight, fight at the Michigan, Ohio State rivalry football game when the Wolverines beat the Buckeyes 1310 and then attempted to plant the flag at midfield. Guys, I don't know, would this be considered like a snowflake? I'm just kind, so, so I, Hey Chad, y'all help me out. What would this be considered Snowflake is.


That's a good one. That's a good one. I'm Just curious. I mean, Ocho now we don't do politics here.

I was planting something else. You see how fast, you see how fast they created a bill for something that really has no meaning. It ain't harming nobody but don't wanna create a bill for Nevermind, nevermind. Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna leave that alone. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in policy. I'm not a politician, but Im just saying, Yeah, I should, I should be in Politics. You see how fast they move. You see how fast they move, huh? Yeah. I'm tell you, it depends on what It's, whatcha gonna do. No, I, I work for a certain group of people.

What about it? What, what you want me? What? Hey, I look at everything as unlimited, right? Yeah. Yeah. We're worried about it down the road. We kick the can down the road. Shit. It's the way. Hey. Yes. It's the way they operate anyway. Thank you. It's the way they operate. Anyway. OCHO bro James celebrated the G League road debut by setting a new career high in points. Bro led the southbound la South Bay Lakers with 30 points woo.


And a 1 0 6, 100 loss to the Valley Suns on Thursday night in Tempe. Bro had 30 points. 13 to 23 field goal attempts. Three made threes, three rebounds to assist his first G League roll game for the South Bay Lakers. He was balling ocho. I ain't gonna lie to him. He was balling. Yeah, He was. Yeah. He was. All you gotta do is keep stacking them. Keep keep stacking them and building that confidence. Yes. Keep stacking them and building that confidence. That's at some point, I'm not sure where, when it's gonna happen. At what point, you know, you playing the gen, you playing the genie like this, you beat your confidence up. You get confidence in your shot, you know, doing whatever it is that you need to do and transition to the bigger stage.


That, that that's, that's how it all starts. Yeah. That, that's, that's how it all starts. I'm happy for him. I'm happy for him. Especially for all the naysayers. He can't play. He don't belong here. Okay. He gonna pull you wrong, you gonna pull you wrong. And it all start with the worst ethic. Yep. And we'll never run outta money. Ocho I, we just print more. I saw that during the pandemic. Oh yeah. We ain't got no money. And they just started printing more. They just, them printing presses just started rolling. They don't have money depending on who's asking and depending on what they need to spend it on. Don't ask me. 'cause I spent all my money. Oh, it's always money baby.


KD is back arguing on the internet. I like that he finished his Twitter thumbs this morning saying, I've accepted that most people would die. Guy Haters. Yeah. I like that. I saw that. I saw that. Can somebody, can somebody tell me what, what, what, what I mean what was said? I didn't, I didn't see this, oh Lord, at Mercy. It, it wasn't that, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that bad. But I, I like the fact that KD engages with the fans. Someone, someone that polarizing a figure of that magnitude, one of the best in the world that's ever played, probably the greatest scorer of all time sits there and he fucking interacts with us.


Regular folk does. I like that. He does. Yeah. I like that. And I, I think more, I think more players should be acceptable and show that they're also human as well.

And I've been doing good. Right. I've been doing really good. Yeah. Because you know me. Yeah. I I I like it though on That's what, that's what makes the platform to me so much fun. That's why I think the X apple or the Twitter app, whatever you wanna call it, is the best thing because everybody has an opinion. Everybody's not going to agree with you. The difference in opinion and the negativity and the positivity. It what makes it so fun? Because you control what you wanna respond to. I like the negative stuff. I like the positive stuff. I, I respond to the positive as well as a negative to keep a, a healthy balance on my timeline.

Beyonce will perform in her hometown of Houston doing the Ravens Texans game. Mm. Hey, that's gonna be live boy. That's gonna be live. What platform is this on? You know Netflix. It's on Netflix. Whoa. Wait a minute. Now. Now listen, I I I wonder are the servers gonna be able to handle the amount of people that are going to be watching? Because obviously when it was the Mike Tyson and Jake Paul fight, there was some issues with, with the, with with the service.


NFL gonna lose their damn mind if them servers don't handle it. I'm telling you. Yeah. You know how the N NFL is about that problem. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They, they don't play. So obviously whatever problem there was there, there were, when Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fought where, where it was kind of buffering of it, it was kind of messed up a little bit. I'm sure those have been rectified. Understanding that you have Mariah Carey got them Beyonce coming, you know, for the Texan Ravens game. So I'm, I'm assuming those issues are gonna be fixed, but that's gonna be dope. That's gonna be dope. 'cause a lot of people that ain't even tuning in to watch no goddamn football are gonna be, are gonna be tuned in. Yeah. They gonna be tuned in because I'm gonna be tuned in. Yeah. They want to see, you know, game on on Christmas. Yeah.


And then obviously we wanna see Beyonce, NFL man leave Beyonce alone. Let that woman have a break. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There. Yeah. Yeah. But listen, that, that, that's, that's what you need. Huh? That's what you need, you know, and and BB is the real did it all. She does. I I told you, remember I told you I was a backup dancer on the Yeah, on, on the, on the tour, right? Yeah. One of the, one of the girls, one, one of the, the backup dancers, the male dudes tore his Achilles. He tore and I, I filled in for the back half of the tour. It was a great experience. Beyonce was cool as she was cool as hell. And you know, she treated, she treated as well. I was hoping to work with her again, but now, you know, I got too many damn jobs now. Yeah, but look, I mean I guess the best part about having Jay Jay-Z in the fold is, you know, you get access to Beyonce and it's kind of hard like, babe, I need you to do me this solid stop.


Yeah. Because, because normally when they ask she doesn't tell 'em no. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But Mariah and Beyonce will be performing at Christmas Day game. Mariah will perform her performance, will air our head of the game and then Beyonce will perform at the halftime of the Ravens Texans game. Alright, Ocho, now it is time for q and a Q and A.

I'm assuming he's from Cincinnati, right? I mean, probably. Probably. I mean he could theoretically, I mean he could be from Pittsburgh, but really, I don't know if the CI kid, then again it might be Jordan. So, Hey sense kid, if you watching tonight, man, I salute you. I salute you. I appreciate the support homie. If you are from Cincinnati, you already know what it is. Yeah. He from ci. Yeah, I I appreciate that man. That's love man.


That's love. It absolutely is. We appreciate your support, man. Appreciate you always tuning in and checking us out since the kid has watched a grand total of 13,623 minutes since the Kid 19. We salute you bro. Terrance G said, Hey guys, another poor season for My Bears. What do you think about hiring Brian Flores? I love hip. I love it. Because the only thing that matters to him is winning. I think he's gonna get another opportunity. I, I think most coaches it's the second time around. Now every once in a while you get coaches that that figured out the first time. Right. But if you look at a lot of times the F coaches, Brian coaches Billy, I mean Coach Belichick, first time Cleveland.


Okay. But not so well. Right. All that. Mike Shanahan his first job in in CI in Oakland, Denver figured it out. Yeah. You look at Pete Carroll. Pete Carroll had two stops. People don't realize before he went to Seattle, he was at the Jets and the Patriots Not so much. Yeah. Now you look at Bill Parcells, look at the success he had. First stop, boom. Jimmy Johnson, first stop, boom. But a lot of times guys, that takes a couple of stops, at least one stop before they figure it out. And I think he learned by some of the things that he did. Well some of the things that at the end of the day, you gotta be you. Yeah. Y'all gotta stop trying to be Coach Belichick. Yeah. And that's what I think.


That's why a lot of his disciple guys that came from Coach Belichick, they tried too hard to be like him ocho. Right. And they don't be themselves. Right. There's only one coach Belichick. Yeah. And you know what else is important too for these coaches? What? That get these stops maybe there be 1, 2, 3. Now ma how many stops it is. But normally it's all about situation and where you go. Because if if you, if you go to the right team with the right personnel and the right players that it can be one stop, it can be one stop. Yeah. True. Depending on where you go. So we think about Brian Flores getting another opportunity. Hell, he can go any goddamn way. If you kick, if you take the same personnel he got with the goddamn Vikings, you take the Viking defense with you, but you go to another team that doesn't have the same type of players or the same type of skill set as certain positions that allow you to do some of the things you do in Minnesota, it's gonna be a problem.


You right. Myrle land 88. Ask Dan. Oh, next time, first take. Why did Rams play so poorly even though they're more healthy than the 49 Ewers? It Rain. Hey, I want to ask him, Brock Purdy still, you know, still a top five quarterback, still Elite. They said he was. That's what d say every time He said they said he was. I'm just curious. But, but normally, you know, when you're a top five quarterback, right. Despite the injuries, despite the players that are out, you know what they continue to do? Uplift their what? I'm, I'm I'm just saying now, I could be wrong if I've just been watching the game of football for 20, 25 years. But I'm just saying if you're a top five quarterback, once you're in that category, in that tier, regardless of who's hurt or who's around you, you continue to uplift.


What is Josh Allen done? Okay, that's, I'm, I'm just curious. I'm, I'm just curious. I'm, I'm okay. I'm gonna let that go because I don't really like talking about people too much. I done got a little better at it, but yeah, you get the point. OIE pope too. Hey Uncle Ocho as a Seahawk fan, do you think we have any chance to win these next game and win the division you got? Damn right. Love y'all. Be safe. Yeah, for sure. What you talking about man, we got Gino Smith. Boy, you know where Gino Smith from? Boy he from the 3 0 5. Anytime you got somebody with that type of background based on where they from and what he's done, you know what Gino Smith been through to get to the point where, man, don't get me started man.


Y'all good? Yeah, you got, you got opportunity and listen, that goddamn that damn con that conference, that NFC that's up for grabs that N Ffc NFC West, right? Yes. Yeah. That's up for grabs. Whatcha talking about? And if there's anybody that's gonna do it, it's gonna be goddamn Gino The Frog. I agree. I like them. I like them. Red Hood said Ocho Ocho, you and Vic gotta retire from Madden just 'cause y'all ambassador don't make y'all good ing two. Hold on. Time out, time out, time out. Time out. Young bull. Time out young bull. Listen for one. I'm the best player in Madden in the world. The problem is, is the fact that I haven't been able to play Madden the way I used to because I got 57, 11,000 goddamn jobs.


So I haven't been able to be on Madden as much as I like to, which is why you saw me lose tonight. The sketch. That's it. Well get your ass off there. That's It. That's it. That's it. I haven't had the time, I haven't had the adequate time to put the time in like I used to. I used to win the Madden bowls, I used to win the Madden bowls, that's how great I was. But the fact that the past five, six years, like I've been stacking job after job and I ain't really had time to focus on gaming the way I used to. Okay, well stay off it because you've been stacking l after l just like you stacking jobs, you stacking Ls now. Right? Right. We see, you see, you see that's what happens. That and because of my job that that, that is also it, it it has also ruined my, my my romantic interests as well.


You see, I've, I've I've I've had a singer, I prayed on stuff like this. I prayed on opportunities like this and, and just everything seemed to be falling by the wayside because God has given me what I prayed for. Yeah. Bunch of a's 4K keeps saying, oh okay. Oh, you ever heard of the story Junior Bridgeman former bug flare seventies and eighties made 2.95, a little less than $3 million playing brought wind and chilies franchises after career. I absolutely have turned those into he's just American success story. One of the first African American players to take the small money that he made invested in off time. He learned the business invested and now he's worth seven, $800 million.


Yeah. Absolutely important. And he's one of the few two unc, think about all the horror stories with that small amount of money that he took a chance with. Think about all the horror stories that people have had that had more money than that. Yes. Ever done investment after investment at the investment and they and they and they failed. Yes. I think a lot of people always hear the good stories about people investing their money and every time you hear somebody about getting a lump sum of money, the first thing they say, oh, I'm gonna invest it. Not realizing nine times outta 10 you're going to lose before you hit. So you have to have the money to continue to keep investing because you're gonna take it loss after loss after loss. Every time you invest in something it ain't gonna hit. Nope. You're absolutely right.


And so that's what you have to like, you know, hey I, hey I'm gonna take these singles because you know everybody, everybody ain't gonna be able to hit no with the Google, the DoorDash and the, the ride share and all that other stuff. Everybody ain't gonna be able to hit it out the park with that. And you got, so I'm gonna take these little singles right here, Ocho just keep keeping my little seven, six, 7%. Yeah. Yeah. I would love to have a couple to hit 25 30 10 x Woo. It's hard. It's hard at this point in time now. Nah, I'm lose it. It's hard Because I can't to lose. I can't, I I'll never make it up. No, you can't. I mean not, not at this point in our life though. Nope. Adrian and Meto Ocho, the river dance, the top five celebrations of all times.


What made you do it? River Dance Saturday. The lord of the Lord of the something, Lord of the dance. The commercial came on, we were playing Chicago. It was 2005. I'll never forget. And this is how the, the celebration came about. The Lord of the dance was in Chicago at the time and the commercial came on in the hotel room and I was like, you know what that is cool. It's funny. So I practiced in the hotel room and I, I had no choice but to score. And so obviously when I did score against the Bears, I tried to do what I saw pre the previous, the previous night in the hotel room. And that's where most of my celebrations came from. When I did the Tiger Woods put on, tiger had, yeah, tiger had just won a major and he did the, you know he did the, yeah, did, did the fist pump.


And that's why I grabbed the pylon and I just copied that when I did the mar when I did the marriage proposal to the cheerleader on the sideline. Right. My homeboy had just got married. I said, you know what boy I got, I got one for you, you know. And I told the cheerleaders, I don't know who's gonna be near me once I score, but when I come to you, yes you react as if I'm really proposing Yeah. Every, everything was a spur of the moment. The last, the, the underscore last philosopher said if Drea text y'all, hey at 12:00 AM what y'all doing? He ain't texting me. I ain't got, she ain't got my number. Drea. Who?

Be there. I promise you, you don't wanna miss this one. The Rams got four field goals, but that was enough to beat the 49 Ewers. 12 to six in a very sloppy game. But the news out of the game was Devon. Dre Campbell told the team he did not wanna play anymore and he left the game in the third quarter of tonight's game. Kyle Shanahan said, DiUS Ward, who's a teammate, spoke about Deandre Campbell leaving the team in the middle of the game. He's probably gonna get cut. Kyle Shanahan, rip Campbell after the night of loss. That's somebody who doesn't wanna play the game. Plain and simple, not a good look.
