So this story McCordy about the meteorologist Bill Belichick is insane. OCHO take a listen. What Devin McCordy had to say about Coach Belichick. Yeah, This is my rookie year. We're playing the Jets on a Monday night. So we're doing a a, a nighttime walkthrough Sunday night before the game. And he grabs all the corners and he grabs me and he says, Hey, when we're running down this sideline, the way the wind pattern is in our stadium going towards the open end, the wind whirls like this. So the ball's gonna look like it's going further than what it is, but it's gonna hit that wind and it's just gonna drop. So when you're running on this side, make sure you turn around and get your head back. And I remember sitting there like, really, dude, the wind pattern.


And sure enough, I get a, I get a a a go ball on that side against Braille Edwards. I turn and then I look back at him and then I remember like what Bill said, I turned my head back, ball drops right in my lap, get an interception. From that point on, there was nothing a guy could tell me that I would be like, nope. I I I believe in everything I was drinking the Kool-Aid heavy after that. You know, old Meadowlands, everybody knows Yeah, there's the win and and you have to play the open end, the win swirl a different way. And the quarterbacks knew it. It's kind like certain areas, like there was a field OCHO and that there's a dip in the field and like, man, when you're on this side, there's a dip in the field. So just be careful. Yep. Coach Belichick having played, he was the D coordinator for the Giants also remember he was at at the Jets.


So he had been in the, he had been in the that stadium for so long. So he knew. Yeah, he knows, he knew. I, I remember, I remember that playing there, playing, playing there as well. We had the same thing. And what Carson would do when we were on that side of the field, if you are on that hash, the DED balls, he wasn't throwing them. Yeah. You he wasn't throw he wasn't throwing 'em that way. I remember that. So that story, that story is correct. So there wasn't no no bull drive. And it's because was it it is because of the gate, right? The Opening. Yes, it's open. Yep. I remember that CJ Stroud denied his intention was to little bro Caleb Williams during the post game interaction in week two. He explained how older players approached him on the field last year to offer helpful advice.


So he wanted to pay it forward. Ocho let's take a listen to the sound, Caleb and, and cj I saw that I was trying to like little bro him or nothing. He knows that too. I a ton of respect him. I told him I respect him, but I had so much, so many guys coming to me after games last year. And that meant the world meant the world to me. That, that, that those guys even thought about giving me advice. So I just try to give back to what the game has giving to me. So I, I wish him the best man. I want him to do amazing in this league. I think he will, I think that he'll get his groove. And once you get your rhythm, I didn't get my rhythm until like week three, week four. So I, I can see him, his game picking up from here. And so, and you know, I I don't think he was trying to like, you know, be any towards way.


He just upset they that they lost. I totally understand. So I have a ton of respect for that guy, man. I want him to do extremely well, just like any other guy until we play on that day, you know what I mean? And after the game we can be cool, you know what I mean? But I'm, I'm definitely, you know, rooting for him and I wanna see him do extremely well. Is every time is everything we try to show somebody up Ocho Is that where we are now? I mean, I kind of, I kind of understand though, you know, esp I mean, you gotta put yourself in Caleb, Williams shoes, you know, I'm going against the number one quarterback, you know, that's my partner, you know, whether you know each other or not. I'm just coming off a bad game though, huh? Yeah. I'm just coming off a bad game, you know, and at that time a camera's rolling with you micd up, you know, with you telling me, you know, wanting to, you know, not make certain plays or telling me I need to make certain plays or certain throws at that time when everybody's listening and watching can be, I think it could be a little uncomfortable even with CJ Stroud's intentions not being that, just that I think the timing and the setting of doing so was maybe a little wrong.


You know? I, that, that, that's all, that's all. But I can, I can kind of see both sides because when it comes to Stroud, you know, Stroud intentions, he's authentic as it gets. Right? I'm talking about authentic. If you don't, if you don't know him yet, you know, I, if you know his history, you know, I done known Strive for a little minute, you know, he grew up with, with my son out there in LA now, you know, so I'm talking about when I talk about authentic as it as it get, you know, and you won't know until you actually meet him in person and talk to him. So I know he meant nothing by what he was trying to do. His intentions were pure, right? And the message he was trying to give Caleb, but I can understand Caleb coming off a loss after a game, feeling a certain way about losing the game and having a bad game.


And just the, the timing might've been just off a tad bit. So that's why you, you could see the mannerisms of, of him listening and then trying to pull away and then try out trying to engage again and it feeling like, or like, like, come on man. I, yeah. Not, not, I get it. And that's why Ocho I don't even, I don't even offer any advice. I don't offer, I don't try to mentor. If you wanna reach out, I'll reach out, I'll respond, I'll return, I'll, I'll, I'll call you back or somebody get in touch, say man, such and such trying to reach out to you. Okay? Hey, he gives information because that's why, that's why me, the way I took it, man, when them guys would walk up to me like, damn, little sharp, you gonna be like a big bro, huh?


Man, that beat the world of me on try and catch with one pass. But somebody saw something in me that made them think that I could be like my big brother, Right? I don't care if you ain't nothing, but if you a day older than me, you could offer me some advice. You offer me words of encouragement, I'm good. Tell me, damn. Hey, I ain't, I've never been too a too proud to receive info that I believe can be beneficial. So that's why I'm and see Ocho, that's why I don't, man, you should have mentor it. Ask. I ain't stepping on nobody toes because for that very reason, everybody think you trying to son everybody, everybody don't want Shannon's assistant. Everybody don't want Shannon's help. If they want it, they'll reach out.


That's where I am on that situation, right? So guys, there are a lot of guys, I never mentioned their name. If they wanna mention it, they'll mention it, talk to 'em a lot. Hey, they do. I stay up. Do I go, Hey man, you've been through this, blah, blah, blah. Hey, you have to understand what it's like here. You're never gonna be as well as, as as thought of there X, Y, and Z. Hey man, you're doing great. You know, Trav will reach out, nephew, you'll reach out what you think, what you see, man, this is what I'm looking at. This is what I, hey, this is what I see. And from the time I had a relationship, I felt, he made me feel if I saw something in his game, Right, I could reach out and tell him, you on the phone, Hey, this is what I'm seeing.


But every, everybody's not receptive like that. Everybody, you know, I ain't trying to be your big brother. I'm not trying to be anything. I'm trying to offer you some advice. So way I do it. If you want the advice, you reach out. If you don't, I'm cool. Right? And no, no thing. Hey bro, it's Cool. Yeah, it's cool, right? Yeah. But I, I listen, I I see both sides. Yeah, I see both sides. But I know one thing, I know a lot of people might not be on Caleb's side right now. They might be talking trash, you know, some of the, some of the pundits, some of the, some of the analysts, you know, saying some things whatnot because of 'cause of his play, you know, and throwing interceptions, making Aaron throws. I know one thing when that young brother figures it out, understands the pace of the game, the flow of the game catches that rhythm.


When he, when Caleb Williams catches that rhythm and the speed of the game and the game starts to slow down to him and he's able to process information, boy it's gonna be hell, boy. Yeah. And that's, that's how it is with anything. He, he got all the tools, huh? Oh yeah. He can do it all. He can. He got All, He got an arm he can run good throw on the run. Yeah. But so it's like, it's like in this digital space, you know, guys will reach out. I sit down and have a conversation with him. I say, well, I kind of did it like this and, and so forth and so on. And I said, you are kind of in a similar situation. I say, because you, you know, you're somebody fast. I said, but you gotta work at it now. I said, now if you just try to get in this to do, I say, what, what, what actually are you trying to do?


Right? 'cause if you're not gonna devote the time, What good is it? I said, bro, you gotta spend time. I said, you don't understand how much time my team spends that, you know, Ashley, I mean, I have an idea. That's one thing about she, her phones don't do not disturb except for one number. And so when that number, and sometimes that number calls at midnight And, if you didn't know better, you swear she was, she was expecting me to call because she's wide awake. And sometimes that conversation might be five minutes and sometimes it might be an hour and 35 minutes. But she's listening to what I have to say.


Because at the end of the day, we're trying to make Nightcap as good as we possibly can. Yeah. Pass this information along to a OCHO producer, so forth. And so same thing with cj. We're looking at get, okay, who can we get that's gonna be engaging? Who's gonna be entertaining? Got a great story to tell. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to create, we're trying to create content that we think our viewing audience, our listening audience that they want to hear. That's what, that's what to do. We study the trend, we try to stay above it or in it never fall behind it. We are looking at numbers. We And we are seeing what we need to do in order and, and you know, we listen And, we, we see comments, And, we listen.


How can we give them what we want? But at the end of the day, it's UNC and Ocho. We gotta be true to who we are. Yes. We wanna please our fan base. We wanna please the, the people that subscribe, people that watch people that purchase our merchandise. But at the end of the day, you have to be Ocho I have to be unc. We're two different people, but we're striving for the same thing. So yeah, a lot of times people reach out and you know, when you explain to 'em what it takes, it's, I said it's, it's not easy. I mean, it's like trying to be, get an electronic, I mean, it's like trying to get, it's like, okay, I'm gonna compete with Apple. Hmm. Shh. But they got, they got 400 B you don't in cash.


Yeah. They spend another, huh. Speaking of Apple, you know, I, I was with, I was with Tim Cook. Tim Cook laid on, I mean, early this evening, and they were doing the unveiling of the iPhone 16. You got What? Yeah. Yeah. They gave me, they gave, they gave me an iPhone 16, pro Max, whatever you call it. I'm excited though. I'm excited to open this up. I don't know. Yeah, I'm, IM going back with, I think I'm about to get me a flip phone. I'm done with that. I'm done. You don't, you don't. Yeah. Yeah. Bad, bad. They, they got me, they got me running scared. Oh, you shout out. Hey, I see. So, hey, I see, I think Motorola got a flip phone that you can fold up and put it in your pocket like a, like a, like a billfold.


That what I'm for. There you go. Shoot that. That'll work. I, if, if I gimme another phone, I ain't gonna even have, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have, I ain't gonna have no Instagram on it. I ain't gonna have no apps on it. Just a phone. There you go. That'll Work. Yeah, man, it got me running Scared. Ocho Ocho Andy Reid says Isaiah Pacheco is headed to IRR to have surgery. And that has no timeline. Said it could be the season or next. Excuse me. Should chiefs fans be panicking? Oh, absolutely not. Absolutely not. Listen, if you understand the running back, if you understand the running back position where players are replaceable now, there's nothing wrong with Pacheco, but you know, there, there's a, there's a upper echelon of running backs.


Your Alvin Kamas, your Christian McCaffrey's, your Nick Chubbs, your, your your Derrick Henrys. They ain't Got No, no, I, yeah, I I think Pacheco would be in the tier two. Yeah. Correct me if I'm wrong. He would be in the tier two of Yes. You know, the, so filling in that position or having someone else fill that role that Pacheco does, it would be easier to do. And I mean that in a, in, in, in a respectful way, it just, it it is, it is what it is. You can find someone else to put in that position that can give you that same production. Well, they got Kareem Hunt coming back and ka before he, you know, got in trouble. He was as good as running and catching the football as they had and Catch out in the back field. Yep. You remember that outstanding rookie season.


I mean, his first game, he did a number on Coach Belichick. And Coach Belichick I think went to the center field, said, son, you got a hell of a career in front of you. And he had a little mishap. He got some since you got in some trouble. And he ended up, if I'm not mistaken, I think they released him and he ended up signing with Cleveland. Had a couple of good years there. But I, I I, if the thing is though, you'll think about it. You lose Pacheco and you saw the cheese last year in the playoffs, and this year they start to run the ball a little bit more. Right now you've already out Hollywood guy used Count on. So that's two weapons. Now remember they benched their left tackle. Yeah. They, they're kind of picking up, starting up. They, they benched him. So now you bench your left, tackle your other guy that came in.


He got two penalties held on the wind. No Hollywood, no Pacheco. At some point in time, you know, you well who, who's the biggest threat to the Chiefs? The Chiefs. Yeah. And injuries. That's the biggest threat. You can't keep losing these good ass fla. Oh, next man up. If the next man was so good, he'd have been up. Yep. Oh, he wouldn't have had the No. If the next man was so good, he would've already been up There. Exactly. He'd have been up, he'd be the gal. This, and this is the funny thing. This is the funny thing about the Patriots. I'm talking about the Patriots. This is the funny thing about the Chiefs last year, they had issues. Yes. Everybody dropping the balls.


Nobody throw the ball too offensively. They stunk. They were stinking up the house November in the, in the month of October. They were very, very good at getting over adversity and just keep on chopping wood and chopping wood and chopping wood. And I think it's going to be the same thing again. Because as you, well, as you know, when you have a quarterback Yeah, like that, of that caliber, no matter what turmoil is going on around you and your team, as long as you have that centerpiece in place, you will always have a chance to win. Well, Trav gonna have to pick it up. I mean, I think he got what, three, four catches for 39 yards.


37. That, that, that ain't gonna cut it though, Joe. Yeah. Rashid Rice is giving you y you know, he's taking that next step. He's playing unbelievable. I mean, the way he finished the last half of the season, postseason, okay, he picked right up. He picking Up, he picking up right where he left off at, Picking right up. Now we need Trav to go along with that. Well, you know, they, they got, they gotta give him the ball now. Yeah. You know, they got ball, you know, have some play, have some special plays called up for him. And depending on who they're playing, he gonna have games where he gonna go slap ass off. And then, then, then you're gonna play some team that's gonna be like, you know what, we taking you away no matter what. Right. We taking you No, my we w no matter what, no matter where you go.


And then obviously everyone else is going to have to, you know, do what they need to do. Rasheed Rice, Xavier worthy heck gonna have to go off. He has to go off and he need to make him pay early. Xavier need to make him pay early. Yeah. So that's, that's, that's why I am on that. I think the thing is for them is that it needs to be a situation where the other guy's gonna have to step up. I'm anxious to see what, what Kareem Hunt can do. Maybe they go out and get Jet McKinnon 'cause he's unbelievable. He can run the ball. He better in the passing game. Great at blocking great special teams player. So it'd be interesting to see how that works out for them. Wish Pacheco Speedy recovery. Jim Harbaugh is back delivering great football moments and quotes. Let's take a listen to him giving props to his coaching staff.


ocha All, he is just a, he's just a great, he's a great coach. I mean, one of the best I've ever been around, you know, like Moses, I'm gonna, I'm gonna die leaning on my staff, Greg, Roman, Jesse Minner, Ryan f and those coordinators are, you know, my opinion, the, some of the best in the business. You like that you see Greg Roman, remember Greg Romans was his brother John? Yep. Yep. You see his d coordinator, his former D coordinator at Michigan was the D coordinator last year for the last couple of years for his brother John got a head coaching job in Seattle.


You see, you see how, see how they take care One hand, one hand lift the other always. And the the coaching circle is so tight knit. Yes. Depend on who you know. It's not, it's not what you know, it's who you know. Especially in that area. If you look at the umbrella of where some of the coaches come from and then they, they, it expands out and they all get their opportunities. You know, you go from d coordinator to officer coordinator, the head coach, and you know everybody. But at some point everyone always keeps a job. And you always bring your brother with you. Yeah. Go look at, look at Mike McDonald.


Look at, look at Mike. Mike McDaniel's staff guarantee at some point in time they was associated with Kyle Shanahan. Look at the, the Ram staff. Look at it. Mikey, Matt Lalo and Sean McVay. All the go look. Ah, that's crazy. That's, that's dope. That's dope. That's dope.

Nobody scored Arsenal. Six shots on goal. Six shots on goal only two were on target at Atlanta. Eight shots on goal only. Two that were on target. Both teams had about around the same possession. Arsenal had about 46% possession at the Atlanta, had 54% possession. Past accuracy was the same. Files were almost about the same off sides. Two blah blah. That's, that's you. That matters.

That was Soccer Cap with George. Truly Ocho cinco. Now the Game of the Night show Hate Showtime O just one of the greatest performance in MLB history. He went six for six Ocho three home runs two doubles of singles, 10 RBI if I'm not mistaken, he's the 16th guy to have 10 rbis in a game. I think Mark Whitten has the record. He had four home runs in a game and he had 12 rbis. I think that's the record with the St. Louis Cardinals. And he had four runs. Score scored, two stolen bases. He became the first player in MLB history to reach the 50 50 club.


Now he has 51 stolen bases. 51 Homers Ocho. What do you think about Showtime? Soha Tani? Listen, Showtime Sohail Tani is is is doing something that has never been done before. It is never been done before. But the funny thing about it is a story that nobody will believe. But I do have video evidence of me doing something similar like to this. When I played for Liberty City Optimist Baseball Club, you know, I played baseball when I was young. Now Probably back crawl handy I played, huh? Lemme see how your bad hold your battle up. Lemme see. Okay, Hold on. Let hold on now. So, so you know, now hold on.


Let me, let me, let me, let me show you. Now you can see me? Yeah, I see you. Hey, tell, tell, tell me when you gonna throw the pitch? I throw it right now. Strike. See that the ball already gloved the the catcher. Throw it back to me. Nah, nah, nah, nah. That that's gone now. That, that was a ho that was a home run right there. That Was a home bullet wing. Listen, listen. Hey, I was a five tooler when I was eight years old now. Yeah. I was a, I was a five tool. They, they say you was a guard. You did landscaping, you had a hole, a rake, some hedges, a hedge, see, and a lawnmower.


Those are tools You had this I had the Marlins. The Marlins was looking at me. The Marlins was looking at me. The black Coming outta high School and no, I'm talking about the floor. Okay. I thought you were talking about the fish. No, no, no, no, no. I'm about to float them out. No, they were trying to draft me outta high school to play baseball because I was a five tooler. I hit, I I hit 30 and 30 at, at 10 years old I hit 30 and 30 I had 30 home run to 30, 30 stolen bases. So that's why, you know, seeing o have a 50 50, that's a, that's an amazing feat. But if I was able to do it at 12 years old, imagine if I went to the big leagues and didn't choose football, I would've probably done it there before he did.


Yeah. I don't know. You about have 50 inside the park home runs. I don't know if you hit on, I don't know if you hit on the fence, like sure. Hey, I'm old enough to remember when KO was the first to do it. He had 40 40 and I think it was in the eighties, I think 88, 86, something like that around there. When, when he did it. And obviously Barry Bonds did it. Arod did it. Jose, Ronald Laia did a junior LA did it last year. I think he had 40 home run over 40 home runs and 70 steals. Right. This, I mean, he is a modern day Babe Ruth. Now I'm not because I think this is the first time that they've really allowed, because there also a lot of great players that came in the pictures.


Right. That could hit in college. But once they what? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are a lot of great pitchers that could hit in college. Right. But once they became pitchers in the majors, they cut it out. He's said because he okay. He's like, I'm only gonna go somewhere that you gonna let me do both. I have a question. Yes. And I'm glad you said that. Now you know I don't watch much baseball, so now you put me up on games. Now I didn't know they were actually pitchers that could also slug just as good as Oh, in college. Oh absolutely. Oh absolutely. In college. Oh yeah. Yeah. Occasionally you see him come in and they'll pitch hit. Hold on. But are they as efficient as he is at both? He's efficient as a pitcher and he's efficient as a slugger at the same time.


Are they, are they In college? Yes. In college. Yes. Yes. In college. Yes. It it didn't translate to the pros though. No, because they make them choose one or the other. Now they'd come in and do pitch hit. Now if you went to the National league before they got the dh Yeah you could, you know, you had to hit Okay, okay, okay. In American League, the pitchers never hit because you had to dh. But now that you have the DH in both leagues, it's a different story. But yeah, there, there were, there were, there were pitchers that absolutely could crush it. Right. But I understand that when you throw it 98, you throw it a hundred miles an hour. Nah bro, you only gonna do one. And you, you choose and pitchers make the made the most, some pictures making bread and you only working every five days.


Ocho But think about, think about this though. She ho got 10 years, 700 million. Yeah. So think about all those players coming outta college that know they can pitch and can also slug. Now they can make the decision and say, you know what, listen, if I'm coming to your team, I want to be able to do both. So I'm a, I'm of that much more value to you because I can do more. I don't even, they, I don't, I'm not so sure they still, I mean, yeah. I mean, I don't know if they let pitchers hit like they once did. I mean, occasionally they would come in and pitch, hit. I think, I'm trying to think the picture that hit a needing, I'm trying to think. There was a pitch that hit a hit a pitch hit home run in the, in the in in the playoffs.


Right. And I'm old enough to remember, I, I can't, I think it was the Cardinals against the Dodgers or the Dodgers against Rick Bueller, I think is who it was that hit that pinch at home run. Are you looking it up? Pinch at home run pitcher in the playoffs. Hey, that, that's crazy when I think about it because like, you know, I I used to pitch too. You did? I used To. Hey listen, I had a hell of a, I had a hell of a split finger. A knuckle ball. How you, lemme see, lemme see how you hold your hand for the knuckle ball. Oh, my knuckle Ball. Yeah. Lemme see that. How you hold it Like that? That's what I'm doing. No, yo, you gotta see, you see all these fingers on it? No, no, No, no. That, that, no.


That's how you, that's see there's The only way you can throw a knuckle ball. You can't throw with two fingers. That's How you gonna tell me. I I call it the orthopedic way. How you gonna tell me Now you just got arthritis? No, I ain't got no, I'm telling you. Listen, I set up, I set up right. I set up, boom, I'm here. Yeah. Uhuh, Uhuh. And once I come up here, yeah, I'm, I'm like this, I'm like this with the, with the, with the pitch. Are you trying Oh up, lemme ask you a question. Are you trying to throw a split finger? Are you trying to throw a two scene? You trying to throw a four scene? You trying to throw a Not two scene. But listen, listen.


Two scene two scene four scene fast ball. I don't need that, that, that. I don't even need that in my repertoire. 'cause I can, I can throw, I could throw a hundred, 120, 20 mile per hour. Sli So you, so you, so you don't throw the cut, you throw the cut fastball like Mo Rivera the cutter. No, I ain't, I ain't got, I ain't got that. I ain't got that. I ain't got that. I ain't got that in my repertoire. Yeah. I I I'm just saying back. Listen, my, my knuckle ball, I know you taught this is the way they teach you to do it. Yeah, but the way I flip my wrist, I flip my wrist. I can use two fingers. Even though this is supposed to be a two fingers flipped, you know. No, but I can do it with, 'cause the way I can turn ma wrist and I can make a nothing.


But You can't turn your wrist. That's why it's like this here. I know, but that's why You want the ball to dance, don't you? But it could dance. I I'm telling you, I know how to make it dance. No, Kirk Gibson was a, was a, he was a, he pinch hit. That was the 88 World series against the pitcher. There was a pitch that pitch that hit a pitch hit home run. I think it's Rick ni Buer. I mean just type in pitch that pitch. Hit pitcher, pitch hit in the playoffs. Hey, hey, I listen to, but I had a, I had a cur in ho in high school. Yeah. I had a curve ball.


Boy, listen, I had, I had a curve ball like, like no other. You Throw the slurve like bur Bob Levi. Nah, nah. My my curve, my curve was like, like Pedro Martinez. Oh, okay. It was like that. Yeah. Yeah. I had, I had a, I had a nice curve. Like, like Pedro. Yeah. Was it Luke? Or 12 to six? Huh? Was it 12 or six? Nah, six to 12. Can't be. You throw side off about your six to Hey, listen it the funny thing, let tell you how good of a pitch I was.


I Got a picture. I had my glove. My glove was aex, it was an ambidextrous glove. Sometimes I picture my right hand. Yeah. And when my right hand gets sore, they didn't even have to come, they didn't have to come to the mound and get me out. I just turned the other way and put the glove on the other hand, Picture My left. Okay. Like that's How, that's how good I was. They, you ain't never seen no ambidextrous picture. And then like, so with my, well, Well, I think Michigan got one. I think there's a brother that, that I think he might have just got drafted that he was For Real? Yeah. Oh, that's live. I thought I was the only one. I think. But there, there, there, I think they got the guy, a guy got drafted this year.


Throw, I think he throw nine with both left and right. You know Greg Abbot that played for the Angels? He had, he had one hand and he had a, you know. Yeah, I Remember. I remember Greg Abbott. Yep. Yep. I remember Greg. So, Yeah, I like baseball. Listen, I don't, I don't watch it much because it, it is, it is hard for me to, I used to enjoy the game. Yeah. Now, if I get there, if I get there, maybe the fifth inning I can suit through the whole thing. But the game, the, the, the the, it's such a tedious process to get through the game. The pitches and, and the waiting. And it just, I give me any five, get me know, get me two, two hot dogs and the Coke with no ice and some fries. I and the popcorn, I can sit through it.


But from, from any one all the way to nine, I can't do it. Unc No. Can't you got I can't. Like, I mean going to the Dodger games, man, you got, look, it's one way in and one way out. So I'm gonna give you a good three, four innings. I'm gonna be there like before I'm gonna get there like the top of the second. Right. By the fifth, sixth inning. Right. I'm up outta there. Right, right, right. Because I'm not finn to be, I'm not finna be in no two hour traffic to get home after no ball game. That ain't gonna happen. So Yeah, I give you, I give you a couple of innings. Right. I'm up outta there. I got to go eat some chicken fingers. Like you said. I get some chicken, some chicken tenders and some fries. I'm gonna bounce. That's all I got for you bro.


Ocho make ocho ocho your boy got some good news on Monday. Whoa, whoa. Talk to me. Wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait. Lemme wait. Lemme wipe my forehead. Now tell me something. Good. Tell me something. Good. Come on, come on On again. I won my appeal. Okay. Against, against f He said, I, he said I defamed him and in a a strongly worded opinion, they said Mr. Sharp offered strong opinions. Right. Based on things that were reported. That's Fact And that's not defamation. Right. So hopefully, look, there's a chance he tries to throw a Hail Mary and take it to the Supreme Court.


Who knows? Maybe his job is to, but I was never gonna back down. And, and Right. And, and P Mac you know, said, Hey, he didn't, no, I didn't feel I did anything wrong. I ain't got no problem mojo. I and I Yes sir. And, and, and fans and, and people that's listening and watching right now, you've heard me say actions I control that consequences are without or outta my control. But the consequences that come from my actions stand here on it. Yeah. I'll take it On fitness. All 10. I'm wrong. I'm wrong. I don't believe I defamed Brett Barb, I believe I off offered this very strong opinion on what was reported in the papers.


Speaking of what was reported. Is this, is this still true? And has, has, has, has, has the money been paid back or are we gonna leave that Alone? The money. The money. He, he paid the original, but they said he owes interest. That hasn't been paid back. Oh, interest. That's what, that's, that's what was reported. I was speaking on what reported now at the time I said he took money, money, skip said he paid it back. I said, and what about the interest? It's been reported that the interest hadn't been paid back. And like the funds went, some of the funds, $5 million, $4 million or something went for a volleyball arena. And so, you know, I was surprised that he filed a lawsuit.


And so, you know what I always do Ocho I go call. Yeah. I get with Marvin. I go in, I say, so what are we gonna do? Right? He says they got these firms. He said this is the, this would, this would be the number one Williams and Conley. Yeah. Oh, Williams and Conley. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They helped me. They helped me on a few of my cases. Man, Ocho. Yeah. It cost your boy a penny. Oh yeah. Oh, you ain't got, you ain't gotta tell me. You ain't gotta tell me. But it wasn't about the money. I wasn't gonna bow down because you know, sometimes people try to put you in a pinch and think big bank, take little bang. I'd spent up all my money.


I would never, never gonna apologize because I don't believe I did anything wrong. If I was wrong, if I say something and somebody like, okay, Meg thee stallion. She took what I said, she took it, it, it, it hurt her. Okay. Ain't got no problem, Meg, I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention. Intent don't matter because you were equally offended. Even though I, that, that wasn't my intention. If I say something the way I behaved at the Lakers game, I'm wrong. I'm wrong. Dead ass. But I don't believe I defamed Brett. I don't, I was offering a strong opinion on what was being reported. Right. I mean listen, everybody reported it.


Why was he just solely focused on you is the question. You know why, but it is what it is. Okay. My bad. My bad. I didn't mean to bring that up. My bad. It is what it is. But I'm glad. Yeah. It's what, it's so all the people, Joe, everybody that handled it, Ocho they came in, they took all Ash emails. Yeah. Because she, you know, she was my producer. They Yeah. My phone. They came and plugged that machine up to my phone and took everything off it. Yeah. Everything. Yeah. I got, I got one of them too. I got one of 'em at the, I I was like, I say, so what happened? I say, I just want y'all to know I'm about to own something. If anything on this phone, get out.


I'm about to own something. I dunno what, but I'm gonna own it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. And like I said, bro, it was, it's just, It was just, I'm, I'm just, hopefully it's over. I really do owe you. I hope it's over. I wish Brett nothing but the best. I I heard that he's going either tomorrow or next week, he's going before Congress and they're gonna have ask some questions about the funds. Right. Right. What he knew how much he knew. When did he know, what did he know? And so I just like, I just want the people of, of Mississippi to have their day in court. You know, that was wrong for however it got out that the funds were misappropriated.


And I just want, I want the people of Mississippi to be made whole. 'cause that's one of the, that's the poorest state in the us. Mississippi is the poorest. They can, ill afford to have any money slip through the cracks and go to people that didn't deserve it or didn't. And that's, that, that's, that's bad. And I, I just don't, I, I, you know, Ocho you know, I've, and people you've heard me say I hate, like, I, I just want like, people that, that can't help themselves. I mean, you talk about people making 10 and 15, $20,000 a year and come on. And I just, I just feel, I just, I just feel, I look, I I'm for God, you, you blessed me, you, you, you've shown favor to me more than I probably deserve.


But everybody ain't like us Ocho everybody's not gonna play a number of years at, at the NFL or play a professional sport. Everybody's not gonna have a job and be able to take care of their money. And when they retire, they good. Everybody ain't gonna be like that. Yeah. And I like, and I just, I just, I just hate that the people of Mississippi. And I, I don't know why people would do that, but I'm just glad it's over. I wish Brett the best. I wish the people in Mississippi did they get their day and, and, and let justice be served. So that's, that's where I am on that. So I'm glad. Thank you to my team at Williams and Conley. You guys did an unbelievable job.


Luke Williams and Conley, remember them boys, listen, you know, I don't mean to be telling a personal business. I had to work with them on a very high profile case for myself. You know, going through a, I was going through a little rough time. So during that rough time, rough patch I was having a couple of years ago, Williams and Conley helped me. You know, I was a mule for the cartel. Now a lot of people don't the story, but I can tell you this story, unc, you know, and you know, I was, you know, doing, doing, doing trips here and there. I had to get on the road. I had my CDL at the time and I was taking big loads. I was taking big loads back and forth from, from Miami to Houston and you know, Houston to Texas, down to Mexico. And, and I got kind of, kind of caught up and, you know, Williams and Conley came through for me, man.


Yeah. They was able to get me out that, and ever since then, God has been good. That's, that's all I can say. I, I don't wanna get too much into it, but just know God is good. Yeah. You know, and Yeah. I, I appreciate, I appreciate them. Alright. Don't your, now it's time for q and a. Hey boys. A it's one o'clock. You knew that. I did know that. I got, I gotta go work in the morning. Hey. Hey. You see how, you see how hyped I am? You see, you know I, I took a nap early now, but I can, I feel I could talk for another three hours. That's how I'm feeling. And I got this list. I got this Rev. Nevermind. Oh, Cody. Hold Rod said They, they don't pay us. I can't mention them. No. Hold Cody. Hol ho. Cody Horo said Ocho looking like frozen from the incredible Samuel Jackson.


Where's my super suit? Wait, why come Every time, every time a black person has a bald head and got on glasses and a sweatsuit, they gotta be fro they gotta be. What you trying to say Woman? Where's my super suit? Hey, that was a good movie though. Yeah, for sure. That was a good Movie. Kepper know we junior Unc, my question is, are the jets going to make the playoffs or just, just me. If just me, if they continue to play like this and they got 17, they're gonna take 17 to the playoffs. Obviously gonna take your four division winners and then you take your three wild cards.


I think that just have a great chance of being Getting what? Getting what could that be? Absolutely Buffalo. You believe, you believe they're gonna win the division? You believe they're gonna win the division? Me? Yeah. Me? Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. But we don't know when two are coming back. And. we don't know what tool we're getting When he does come back, I don't care how good at supporting cast is that surround him. What tool are we getting back? That's all I wanna know. Tyler Huntley or Tyler Hunt's the quarterback right now. I like Tyler Huntley. I think the numbers will suffer because Tyler Hu being that he's a dual threat quarterback, I think he would, would run more. He would run more as opposed to pass more. And as opposed to sitting in the pocket. I just, I think things are going to be different for the dolphins and things are looking different for the Jets because now it's a different year.


Last year the Jets lost their quarterback. So Miami was on fire, right? This year Miami lost their quarterback and now the Jets are on fire. And I'm looking at Buffalo. Buffalo to me offensively don't have enough pieces to compete and put up as many points as some of the other teams they're gonna have to face. Right. And one of those is the goddamn jets that should have score almost 40 tonight. Yeah, I definitely, they should have scored almost 40. I do think, I think that Jess is gonna make the playoffs. So Kera, that's where I'm at on that Ocho believes they'll win the division. I believe they'll make the playoffs. Daniel Quinn said, what's up Unc Ocho What do y'all think the probability of Cam Cam Newton returning to Carolina.


Why would you put Cam in that situation? Hypothetically? Why would you put Cam in that goddamn garbage? Even, even in the hypothetical situation? Don't, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't, don't. He can't, he can't save the day. He, he, he, he shouldn't have to play Superman. Jesus himself, any of the 12, the disciples couldn't come down and save the Carolina Panthers at the quarterback position. It, it's just, it's just not wa watch the game. I'm gonna be at the game this Sunday in Las Vegas And you tell them what's really going On on the hill side. And I'm gonna tell, I'm gonna tell you, I'm going, I'm gonna come on the show that night and I'm gonna tell you this is the issue.


This is what's wrong. Because I'm not watching from TV and I'm not telling you what I know. I'm telling you what I saw. Right? Cory Gbb said, O ocho. Did you trademark the fa the phrase Kiss the Baby? I absolute, I absolutely did not. I surely did not. I did not franchise it. No, I didn't. Trademark not franchise, Joe. My bad. What's up Uncle Joe? We talking about coffee, about franchise. If you meet, if you used to being the man and meet someone with kids, how do you deal with it if it seems like you don't fit in?


Whoa. What you, what you, what you mean? You, you don't have no kids, but she got kids And you don't fit in And you don't fit in, fit out because you used, you're used to feeling like the man because the women that don't have kids normally put you first. You right. That Mean that's not a situation for you buddy. Right? I can tell you that. But when it comes to women with kids, I'm gonna tell you about me. I ain't dating nobody without no kids. I've always been like that. I Always, you gotta have one, maybe two. Look, this Is what I, or you have three because I understand the type of snack that's gonna be in the pantry. See, unc, you, well, you, you laughing. I ain't playing ass. And for the dudes that's in the chat, if you date single women that have no kids you ever notice, you always gotta take out to eat.


You ever notice, she always wanna put on looks and go places. You don't never notice that you date a woman with kids. Sometimes, you know, she'll cook for you. Sometimes after horizontal like activity after horizontal activity, you go to the motherfucking pantry, you grab your honey bun. Huh? You grab your chocolate brownie. Oh, you grab your oatmeal pie, you get a Capri Sun. Like, it, it, it, it is different dating a woman with kids. She's a lot more re she's a lot more structured and disciplined. She's a little bit more responsible than the woman that don't have no kids. That's always out every goddamn weekend. And when you call on the phone, she don't answer and pick up 'cause she with somebody else. Ah, come on Ocho. See you. We coulda done without that. Ocho I'm, I'm just, I'm I'm just trying to give it to him.


I'm just trying to give it to him raw. I mean, pause. Oh Lord, what is My Bad? Yeah, I mean, just, just to rally go. You was carrying a load. I was like, come on man. I was taking a load. I was like, oh, I ain't even hit you with the, I just let that one slide. I said I don't even wanna talk about that one. My bad, my bad. I'm, I'm just, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good tonight. I Think the thing is, Ocho, look, this the one thing I know. My grandparents, it was my grandparents. The kids ain't coming. They, they go, oh, I will put my kids first. Okay, put the kids first and see what happens.

Hey, it was never a situation. Ain't no kids with no kids coming in between. It's gonna be the a mom and dad. Y'all are united front. Yeah. I ain't I ain't telling you to abandon your kid, but I'm like, like, come on now. You gonna have to let, you gonna have to let the man be a man in the house at the end of the day. You gotta let him And. if you don't, if that's not what, if you wanna be the man, don't invite somebody in. If you're not gonna let him be what he is. Right. Right. And man, don't go in that situation if that's not what you're trying to be. You can't find a date a woman with kids and then get mad that she got kids because she's gotta devote time to them.


Yeah. Because At the end of the day, I don't, I don't know the re I don't know the relationship she has with the kid's father and hopefully he's there but she's gotta vote sometimes. You can't, you can't hog monopolize all of her time. That's all I'm saying bro. But I get it, I get it. I've been very fortunate that when I've dated women with kids, they made me feel special. Yeah. And I appreciate that. And like when you go into that situation, you do understand it's not like, like you gotta treat them as if they were your kids. That what I would do for white own kids, I would do for them. But I li you know what I like if I did the one with kids that when they ask for stuff, it's normally for the kids.


I got a well kids, he need this. Oh you need PlayStation, you need Xbox, they need this. They need a camera. Well, okay, you got kids and you talking about some YSL or you talking about some Tom folk Get outta here. They ain't me. Ask me something for the kids. I got you. I ain't gonna never ask you. I ain't gonna ask you. I've never dated a woman. And when they ask me, Shannon, could you help me with X, y, and Z? I never said What about the Dan em my responsibilities. I understood that you had responsibilities when I met you because you, you don't tell me, I don't know how you feel about this, but I have a child or I have two kids.

And likewise, the top three coaches on the hot seat, Robert Sala. He gonna be good. Hold on. A FCC. Let's see. A FC East I think. Oh, Sean McDermott. He might be on the hot seat. Even if they make the playoffs.


Buffalo. Yep, Buffalo. They better go far in the playoffs. They wanna change the scenery that I Guess a LC South. What do you think about, you think Doug Peterson on the hot seat in the south? Yeah. In Jacksonville? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Hell I put Dave Canales on, on a goddamn hot seat too because that's why me, they just got so, so did Frank Wright. That's the reason why he made that switch so early. Damn. I'm telling you. I'm telling you that's the reason why he made the switch so early. Uhuh. I'm Finn, I'm gonna put, I'm finna put, I'm finna nip this in the bud right now.


Oh. And you know what's gonna happen, you know what's gonna happen. They gonna go to Andy Dalton, nothing gonna turn around. Then they gonna go back to Bryce Young. I'm telling you Chad, I'm telling you what's gonna happen. Andy not gonna be able to do nothing. They gonna have to go back to Bryce Young. The man don't, don't, you'll see. What about the Giants head coach Brian Day ball. You think? Hey, I mean listen in the the the perfect situation, the phrase players get coaches fired. I wouldn't be surprised 'cause Daniel Jones right now coming off of last year based on what he's done so far this year, shit.


Dang man. He might not make it to the buy week. Man. I don't, I mean talking about Sean Payton man, Sean Payton, they owe Sean. Well look, they got the money. The Walton Pinine family that purchased the Broncos, he's the wealthiest owner in the NFL worth over 70 billion. So 60 million ain't nothing to him. Nothing at All. Nothing. That's 1%. But it's not so much losing, it's how they lose. Yeah, That's the thing I I, I think with ownership and be looking at it, but I think it's, it's how they're losing and it's gonna be interesting to see if the Broncos can turn it around.

Nah, nah, I would, I honestly, honestly, Alan, I would not, if the NFL is not, I I don't think they're looking to expand. I don't know where they would go. Jerry damn sure. Don't want another team in, in, in Texas. He got, he got hu he got Dallas and Houston. D they don't want anybody infringing on that market. They got three teams in Florida. They got two in, in, in the New York, New Jersey area area.


I, I'm trying to think what city, what state could hold. The only one I can think of is Texas and Jerry ain't gonna let that happen. Right. Jerry coulda let that happen. I mean, I'm, I'm, I Could, I mean when you gonna go to Oakland Go Yeah. Get a team back in Oakland. Yeah. I mean, but you, but you got the 49 ERs in the bay. You got the Rams, you got the charger that share the same building. So that's three teams. Could they possibly hold, I mean you got 40 million people, so theoretically you could, but I don't know if expanding maybe a team relocates, but I don't think anybody's looking to relocate.

I believe everybody, every person should at least have to go one semester to an HBCU and it needs to be in the fall.


So you can see the pageantry, you could see a homecoming, you could feel the students in a buzzing woo. You could see the, the saws and the frats on the yard stepping doing what they do.
