I guess we coulda got the Chick-fil-A sauce. We coulda got raisin cane sauce, Big Mac sauce. Yeah. Yep. Yes. Sriracha Ocho. Wow. Nacho Sadan shot. Lonzo Ball recently admitted that the big of brand sneakers he wore his rookie season could have contributed to the left knee issues that sidelined him for 1009 days. Ball told ESPN that the first version of the big ball of brand sneakers were comparable to kick ball shoes. Lonzo suffered his first meniscus injury in January of 2018.


And he could not help but wonder if Triple Bs played a part. I think it's a possibility for sure, to be honest with you. I wasn't really getting hurt like that until I started wearing them. Nah, Uhuh, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not buying that. I'm not buying that. The structure and the design of a shoe is a reason why you have, you know, injuries when it comes to all shoes. They're all designed and structured in the same way to be able to do the same thing. Especially when it comes to playing the game of basketball. I'm not putting that on those shoes. Absolutely not. Well, some people, well some people Ocho you have, you have, you have some people that are flat footed. You got some people that have high arches.


You have some people that have narrow foot feet. They have some people that have wide feet. And just because everybody, everybody is not gonna get the same benefit outta wearing a Nike as they would. 'cause maybe Nike fits differently. Maybe Adidas fit differently. Puma sketch, whatever the case may be. This is your brand though, huh? Your brand. So obviously the shoe that you're wearing specialized for you is going to foot, is going to be, be, what's the word I'm looking for? It's gonna be fit for your foot. Ocho Do you think they had the kind of money to do r and d research your development to structure a shoe straight, have mercy ocho do you know how much that, do you know how much these these companies put into r and d?


Do you have any idea? Yeah, because I used to have a shoe. Do you understand? So you think a shoe, a guy said, you know what, I got a son going to the NBA, I think I'm gonna come out with a shoe. So how much money? 50 million. A hundred million. 500 million. How much money do you think they put invested into that shoe? I mean, oh, that's, you know, that's a good question. I'm not, I'm not sure, but No, No, no, no. Speculate. Give gimme example. RD Research and development. We gonna design a shoe, we gonna cast a mold, we're gonna fit it. You do realize how long it takes because the Air Max, you think the Air Max just, okay, you know what I like an Air max. Let's do the Air Max. Which one?


95 and 95. 95. You take the Air max ones, you can take the 90 fives, you can take the 97. You take any shoe that you want. Right? It takes time for a shoe to come from a vision to being able to put on somebody's feet and somebody wear it. Right? Yeah. I I understand what you mean. But just the the just the, the thought. Even, even if there was no, what do you call it? R and d? Yeah. Research and development. Yeah. We, Without the research and development to say, oh, well the reason for my knee injuries because the shoe I was wearing, like, come on. You could, you could have, he Said it could be a possibility. Ocho it could. No man. Hell no, man. No, no. Let we let, let's not, let's not blame the shoe.


No. What you gonna blame it on Ocho? I mean, there are a lot of people that change Ocho. There are a lot of people that change shoes, Your body, genetics, you know, But he had never been injured before Me telling me the goddamn shoes I'm wearing is the reason you missed a thousand something games. Hell no. Ocho you do realize like the feet, everything leads up. So knees. Yeah. I mean, your ankles, your hips, your knees, everything is impacted. Come On. And maybe the shoe, the way the shoe was constructed. Man, listen, Lonzo, that that's my dog, man. But no, we ain't, we ain't no, we ain't, we ain't doing that man. I, I hoop in motherfucking Chucks, man.


So I ain't, ain't nah, hell no. Yeah, you did once upon a time. How many people you see playing in Chucks now? Hey, can I tell you something? Yeah. Just real quick. I I'm not even, I'm not even joking. I know you all think I play a lot. There's footage. I, I score, I think I scored maybe 17 points that there was, there was a, a celebrity basketball game in Philly with, with Gilly Jerron Ennis boots. Jerron boots Ennis. It was, it was fun. It was very competitive. And I played in Chucks full speed, high tops, you know, and I'm just, and I was able to move and maneuver and then, and my lateral movement. And I'm taking people off the dribble and, you know, jumping and shooting it, you know, and like, so I'm, I'm like, Chuck Taylor is a, is a, is a great shoe for lifting waist because of the flat.


So The other flat soul Maybe. And maybe that's why we saw a lot of guys that had foot problems when they wore Chuck Taylors. That ever that ever cross your mind. Yeah. See it is, you know, it's, it's, it's hard for me. You, you know why it's hard for me to even understand why, or I really can't even even fathom the shoes being the reason. 'cause my black ass ain't never been hurt. So it's hard for me to, to kind of have any type of sympathy or really empathize with the fact that he's saying, you know what, the fact that maybe the structure of the shoot is a reason why I had, you know, the noted, Noted possible. Okay. It's okay. It's a possibility. I know the, the percentage I, the percentage of that possibility is extremely goddamn low.


Well, he think he didn't say it. Did he say it may have contributed. So we'll leave it at that right

What's The name of that place that we went to? Remember we went down to New Orleans and we went to that place, twisted Waffle. That's where we went, man. They got so many different kinds of waffles. Right? You know what? It it is been so, it's been so long since I've been in New Orleans. I can't remember the name of the spots, but I, I know when I do get there, I gotta get my beignets. Oh yeah. I, I got Oh, oh, so you wanna go to Cafe Du? Yeah. Cafe du. That's, that's, that's one of 'em. I gotta get my beignet and I don I don't We want all that powder of sugar on top though. Yeah.

I mean, anything else Is UNC civilized? Huh? You got even money. And I tell you what, I I ain't a big fan. You look a lot of people like that king cake. No, It's too sweet for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can I tell you something real quick? A quick story? Yeah, Go ahead. Why and why I'm excited about going to New Orleans and I, I want, I might get there even earlier than I'm supposed to. I don't know. I don't know how long. Well, UNC you will know maybe some people in the chat. Chat. I don't know if you guys remember the homeless man that I had, like unc, I sw, God, it might have been, we had maybe a three year run. His name is Pork Chop and I mean Ash A Ash, if you could hear me look up, look up me and Pork Chop.


When I tell you, me and this homeless dude, he came and he came and bothered me at Davis Cafe one one day on South Beach and asked me to buy him a beer. I went and bought him a case of beer, but I made him sit and eat with me. And we sat there and we ate and we talked and I, you know, I asked him about his, you know, his story and how did you become homeless and what you doing out here in Miami. And he, he was from New Orleans, new unc. When I swear for God, I, I tell you, no lie, me and Pork Chop and some people in the chat might know this story. Me and Pork Chop hung out every single day, but damn, two years straight. I about, I got him cleaned up, bought him clothes, had him stand at the big, I had him stand at the big house, you know, back in the day. And I tried to do everything I can to help him and save him, but he didn't have the resources, you know?


Right. And so, I know he was getting a check somehow. I don't know how he was getting a damn check, but he got on the goddamn bus and left New Orleans, man. And that shit hurt me so bad, man. So I'm hoping when I'm in New Orleans You run into him. Yeah, I, I, I gotta find him. People, people on Twitter that live in New Orleans, always, always see him on Canal Street. He's still homeless. He's not doing as well as he was once I got ahold of him. So I'm really looking forward, man, to, to find him pork chop and maybe hoping to, you know, clean him up again and may maybe have him come to the lab show or something. Man, just, I, I, I missed it. And Ash, if you look it up, Ash, you'll, you'll see the story about Yeah. She, she found, yeah, she found the story.


Hey, when I tell you every day for two years straight, like I, you know, I don't have no entourage. I don't hang with no, you know, I don't hang with nobody. So it was easy for me to become, you know, become friends with him and go places we go eat everywhere. We went to, we went to King of Diamonds. I took him to King of Diamonds. I had him fresh. It's a picture of him online and he, he dancing on a stripper. Right? And it's another picture where he's not used to seeing that much money. So instead of throwing the money at the women, what you think he doing with the money? He Grabbed it, putting in the pocket. He, Oh, he's stashing all the money in his pocket, man. I'm like, cia, you just gotta throw it to the women.


I'll take care of you after this. Yeah. Just have some fun. You're like, ah man, fuck that. This shit go with me. Goddamn poor Char man. Nicky said, Shannon, can you please tell all these younguns why Sterling Sharp deserves to be in the Hall of Fame? I, I think the thing is for the most part, OCHO is a lot, a lot of people didn't see my brother play. But in that he was a Triple Crown winner. He's one of six guys to win, lead to league and catch his touchdowns and reception, I mean yards. He led the league in catches three times. He led the league in to, no, he led the league in catches three times, led the league in touchdowns twice, led the league in yards once.


And you see those numbers in seven seasons. That's what he did. So he led the league in catches three times in seven seasons, led the league in touchdowns. You can see right there. Three time, first team all pro, five time pro bowler, 65 touchdowns. That's seven seasons. Seven. Now go back and look at, he retired at 29. Go back and look at Antonio Freeman's. Look at Robert Brooks numbers. Those next three to four years that they played with Brett. And, and I think Antonio Freeman, he went to the, we played against him in the Super Bowl here in Brooks. And you go, and this is not a slight on them, they weren't Sterling sharp the year that he played the only, the only receiver that you could say, okay, he was better than my brother was Jerry.


And he was right there. Go look at the numbers, Jerry's numbers for seven years that my brother played from 80, from 88 to 94. And compare anybody else's numbers. All the receivers, that's whatever that's in the Hall of Fame. Look at their numbers from 88 to 94. Look at my brothers and look at Jerry's number. So we hoping he made it as a finalist this year. That would be probably, I've had some great moments in my professional career. In my personal career. I don't know, man. This it, this will be it for me, man.


This will be, this will, this will be, yeah man, this will be, I ain't really gotta, I don't even see if I don't see 57 to see my brother go into the Hall of Fame. Yeah, that'd be live. Boy that That's it for me. That's, I would've lived a full life. Yeah. Everything coming full circle. Damn. Yeah. Everything coming full circle. He led the league in receptions 89 92, 93. He's the first to go back to back With over a hundred catches two time touchdown. In his last six games that he played in his career.


He called 13 touchdowns. Mm. Led the league in rec touchdowns twice 92, 9 4. Led the league in catches, I mean in yardage I think in 92. But you know, sometimes that it happens. But I got an opportunity to play 14 years and he got an opportunity, he had the best seat in the house. So we won three Super Bowls. We went into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and he got an opportunity to see that. And so he's been by my side. Every, every major event that I've had happen in my life, my brother's been a part of it.


And so to be, to get an opportunity to potentially be there, to see him get that call and to see him go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, man, it wouldn't get any better than that. That's for damn sure. That's Live Life's lesson says what's up guys? What do you think Prime would have more difficult time guarding on? First in goal at the eight yard line? Or all three of you guys are in your prime? Oh, he gonna put his clamps on Ocho because OCHO ain't physical enough. He already told you Ocho I don what he gonna do to you. I don't need to be physical. That wasn't even part of my game is the fact that I was so goddamn cat quick.


There's nothing he would be able to do. 'cause he ain't even quick as me. He just fast. There's a difference. You need to understand skillset. That's all right. Prime got something for you. Yeah, I hope so. Yeah. Prime can't do nothing with me except catch a catfish, man. That's it. Yeah. I need to go down there and beat him in his own pond. You don't like that? Yeah. I don I don't got the patience for fishing, man. I do. I got, I ain't got the patience for fishing either. I got the patience to beat him. That's what I got the patience to do. Beat Him Patterson. Yeah, it said chat.


Should I shoot my shot? I'm nervous. I haven't asked anyone out on a date in forever. Any advice? I think this girl is sending me signals or am I just delusional. Have been single for single for several single. I've been single for years. Is it my time to shine much love? Yeah. You need no con man listen, you gotta walk in that thing with confidence, man. Ain't nothing we could tell you that shit. That shit that come from within, man. What you talk about man, you better man. What's man, what's up? What's her name? I gotta tell you. Take them sparks First aid. Oh, will you take what a spark.


You see you walking there with three legs. Oh, that's, that's my dude. That's my man. Oh, you Well, man, he try, he try, he trying to go from home plate to first base. He asking for advice. You can't get, I'm at the plate. I'm trying to hit it over the fence. Hey, I'm trying to hit it over the fence. Y you can know baby step baby steps. The man said he's been single for a minute as he's, he's saying she's been giving him signs. So he's unsure. He's unsure of himself. You got to go for that. And you can't go all timid and shy. You gotta you gotta be confident in your approach, in your approach.


Like, what's up? You know, I've been think I'm, I'm thinking you've been giving me signs. How You doing? Yeah, how you doing? I'm not sure. I'm, I'm not sure how to take, you know, the sign. So I would, I would appreciate it if you would be a little, little bit more direct. Because if you're interested in me, I'm interested in you. And I would love to see where it can go. Listen, we can go to dinner, you know, breakfast, a lunch, depending on your schedule. I'm here for you. So what would you like to do? We can exchange numbers. I give you my Instagrams, my Twitter. Yeah. That, I guess that's the new thing. Now. You exchange, you'll exchange numbers. You exchange Instagrams now with Joe. It depends, depends on, on, on, on how efficient he wants to be.


If you, if you really about your business, you need to get all three. Get, matter of fact, get a Facebook too. Matter of fact, get an Email. Man. Ain't nobody man these young on Facebook. I don't, man, I don't know. I don't got, I don't got no Facebook. I mean, I got it, but somebody else handle that. I don't know nothing about no Facebook. I don't, I don't know. You just, Hey, hey bro, you got Jordan. People be messaging us on Facebook talking about all the time. Jordan. Don't be turning over the info. All of you talking about, hey, hey boss you about, if I take the rest of the day off, hey, now all of a sudden you want you done check my my Facebook and now you want the day off.


Something ain't right. Something fishy about that. Michael said, me and my girl of 10 years broke up tonight. Damn mo 10, bro. I've been there 10 years is a yep. Fuck man. Hey, I'm I, I'm honestly, I'm, I'm sick of these breakups, man. Shit, it happened though, Joe. Shit, man. I mean, yeah, But it don't, it don't, it don't have to happen. We need to, we need to find a solution on how to fix this stuff.


Well that's what with people that, that's been married for an extremely long time. They choose to stay married. 'cause it's easy. It's just as easy to stay married as it is to break up. Wait a minute, hold on, hold on. People choose to, People choose to stay married. You got, you gotta, you Work, you work through whatever problem that may arise. Those show you work through it or you attempt to work through it. You don't say f it at the first sign of trouble right at the first time where there's a disagreement. Now people just say, Hey man, I'll start all over. There's something out there better than me. I ain't finna do this. Well, lemme write that down. Lemme write that down bro. I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna take this some A therapist.


Yeah. I like, I like that. I like that. I like that. Matter of fact, hold on. You know I got, I got something I want to tell you too. Now that you, now that you on that topic, I had something, I had something I had to had to tell you. It was real, it was real good too. Hey young dude, 10 years and now y'all no longer together. Right? Always remember the game ends when the king fails.


Not when a pawn takes your queen or whether the queen leaves a man doesn't lose value because a woman has betrayed him. She only removed herself from the game. The king always moved with a strategy, not emotional. Now you take with that what you will, the low poem I wrote back in, back in 92, and it still resonates today. I think OCHO is, is just, here's the thing with relationships, it's always tough. The breakup is always tough. Yeah. If you are not the one that wants to get broken up with, see if you wanna do the break it up, it's easy.


Hey, I'm, I'm done. This ain't working for me. Right. But when you want to be that. Right. And, but at the end of the day, if they're not trying to hear that Ocho, I can't beg, I'm not Finn to beg you. Yeah. I I can't with me. Right, right, right, right. Now listen, I ain't, I ain't gonna run after you. Now I might might, I might jog a little bit. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Know I might, I might, I might speed walk. You know, it's, it's, it's a, we talked about it last night with, with, with, with jr. You know, you know, there, there, there are times and, and that, that pain in being in that fetal position and understanding that hurt that comes with That.


Yeah, for sure. Something that was a, a intricate part of your daily routine. And, and, and having that, having that gone. It's, it's, it's, it's, it, it can be rough. It can be rough regardless of how tough. And I don't care how much pride and how much ego you got, you know, Hey, well, I don't wish that, I don't wish that pain on nobody, man. Ocho if it doesn't hurt you didn't care enough. I'm not telling what somebody told me. I'm telling you what I know because I invest a lot in whatever I do. So that's why when I lost, it hurt me. That's why I had to go home. I couldn't be around people because I know what I put into that game.


Right. Not just the game that week, but I know what I did that off season, when you're in a relationship and you know what you put into it Yeah. To make this work, and all of a sudden it doesn't, and that person doesn't wanna be with you. That is hurt. Hey, you know what, you know what the most important parts you just saying is the fact that you invest in something and you don't get the, you don't get the return on said investment. You can't get that back. And then that individual doesn't wanna be with you anymore. And then you start, no, boy, I'm, then you start questioning yourself. So I'm looking in the mirror.


Well, shit, what the fuck wrong with me? Look at me. Look at this. Who don't like this chocolate? And, and what hurts sometimes Ocho, Oh, talk to me now, Is that at as the thing is starting to fray? Hmm. They give you the worst of themselves, but immediately give somebody else the best of themselves. Nigga, I ain't doing it. Ocho stop. Ocho, I'm done. I'm done. Ocho I'm done. I ain't get, Hey, I'm done with this. I'm done. Let's, let's just move on, Ocho, let's just move on. Let's just move on. Ocho, let's move on. Hey Boy, you talk, boy, you talking tonight. You talking tonight. So when things are ending, they give you the worst of themselves and give the new person the benefit of the doubt.


And they get the best version of them. What if you had, I give a hundred dollars right now. Boy, bad. Look Here, bro. If you had all firm playing out right now, you can, you can have my whole savings account. Boy, Bro. Hey, look, well You preaching now you hear me, Ocho I know, I joke a lot. And, and, and, but I've had a, I spent a lot of time by myself and analyzing. I'm very self analytical. I, I, I look at it, I analyze things and I see things for what they truly are. But come on, Crap. Come on. Craft shark talk To me.


They call me Creflo. No dollars. But, but that, but that, that, I, I think that's what really hurts Yeah. And, and that's why like a lot of times Ocho like when you leave a relationship, you really have to, you really have to like, let it go. You have to like, I don't, you know, I, I can't follow because I, I, I, I, I've been that ocho I know because I broke it up with people and gave them the worst to me and immediately gave somebody else the best. I, I've done it because I'm not telling what somebody's told. You told me. I'm telling you what I know and I'm telling you how human nature is.


And so that's, and I, and I, I remember, and I'm thinking to myself the way you are now, Shannon. Wow. Why couldn't you be like that? Then? Take your Time's. Tough boy is tough. Tough. It's tough, man. I, I, I, I, I remember it like yesterday. Come on, Take your time. I mean, look, and this is really the first time I remember my homeboy, he called, he said, homeboy, how you doing?


I said, man, I ain't good. Oh, He said, homeboy. He said, I know you'll never, you would never ask me to, but if you need me to, I'll call on you on your behalf. When somebody, when somebody that, that's close to you and they say, I'm willing to extend myself. I'm willing to extend my name On behalf of you. And then, and my sister. I remember talking to my sister and she would always send me things every morning, every morning when I wake up.


'cause obviously she's on the east coast. I'm in la So by the time I get up at, you know, I was getting up 'cause I had to be to work at four ocho. So I'm getting up at three 15 'cause I gotta take the dogs out, let them do what they need to do. I need to take a shower and I need to get to work. So she would always send me these things. And I remember getting home and I was about to go to bed. I was about to take a nap after the show. And I remember she called me and she said, how you doing? I said, I'm all, I said, I'm all right, buck. She said, Shannon, it was quiet. She said, she said, how long you been Shannon?


I said, all my life. She said, you've been big, you've been strong, you've been resilient, you've been loving, you've been caring because this woman exited your life. You still gonna be Shannon? Don't let this situation change you, Shannon. You're still gonna be my baby brother and I'm still gonna love you. And it was the, obviously my homeboys bucket and burns they call and they checked on me. Yeah. But it was my brother and sister because like, they're like my mother and father, even though we brothers and sisters is the relationship that we have.


And they were, I, I remember, and this when this, when it really dawned on me Ocho that I was really in a dark place. Yes sir. And my brother's never said this before and he is never said this to me since. Take Your time. He said, if you need me, I'll come out there. I'm a, at the time, how old am I? I'm 2000. So I'm 48. Yeah. 48, 49. About to be 40. I was 49. Right. He said, if you need me, I'll come out there. That's when it really dawned on me. I was like, damn.


He really worried. Yeah. My brother really, he had never shown me. Now I know later after talking to him, he's been other situations that he's been worried about me. But he never, but he never let me know that he was worried. Right. That was the first time in 49 years that I could see, I could tell that he was worried, man. I remember. And I was thinking, I was like, man, what the, Oh, you sna you snapped up outta her. Called my sister. I said, Hey, I'm good. Told my brother, I said, I'm good. How, How, how long it took though, how long it took Mark.


It took me a while. Ocho this happened October, November, December, January, February, March. Took me about six, seven months though. God damn it did o it did, it did. But Hey, Sunshine follows rain Ocho. I'm better for it. And I look back, there are some things that I could, I I, I wouldn't had, had I had I not did that relationship not dissolved.


I'm not here because I, I turned away a lot of things. Right. Because I didn't wanna be away from home because I didn't wanna be away from her because, you know, she, well, I need to go make, you know, I'm turning down 50, $75,000 gig because she's not comfortable. Her people have and well, he's a, why does he want to be with you? Mm. She started to believe like, yeah, why do you want be with me? You're this and you can have this, that, that right. I factor all that in when I decided to be with you. Come on. Do you not, do you not think about that? Then why is it an issue now?

We have one more act for you this evening. I Don't even need to say his name. Mr. Bob Dylan From the director of Walk the line at Ford versus Ferrari. Anyone who's gonna hold your attention on stage, you have kind be a freak And starring Timothy Chalamet as Bob Dylan. Are you a freak? Hope so. Once upon a time Inspired by the true story, I want to know which side he's on Then You this Christmas. They just want me sing. I'm blowing in the wind for the rest of my life. Bobby, what do you wanna be? Whatever it is they don't want me to be. How does it feel? He defied everyone. Turn It down. They laugh To change everything is our Elvis direction.


Timothy Chalamet, Edward Norton, l Fanny, Monica Barro. Make Some noise. Bd track some mud on carpet. Complete unknown. A complete unknown. Only in theater's Christmas day nar under 1790, middle without parrot. Stop worrying about why I chose you. I did. Why is unimportant? Right? Because in this situation, Ocho Yeah, I'm who I am and you are who you are.


But should I not love you? Just the same. Should I feel differently? Because you don't have this name, you don't have this title. I I'm just, I I was, I was, I was confused about why she felt that way. Why? I hate when women ask me, you can have anybody. Why me? You know what? Now that I think about it, I probably should go try to find one of them antibodies and leave you the F alone because you are unsure of yourself. Right. Which is gonna make you unsure of us. And then long as there's doubt in your mind, you're never gonna be able to fully give yourself to me. But like you just said earlier, God, don't make no mistakes.


Hey, in 1987, Chad, well you grow your hair back. Love you guys, man. Thanks for all the relationship and financial advice. I mean, what what I, what I will do as far as growing my hair back, if I go into campus, campus about three months, I'm look forward to beating the shit outta Keith Lee. I'm not sure we can schedule that fight. But when I do go into a fight camp, I will, I will grow my hair out. Won't cut it look scruffy. I won't cut it till fight night. So at, at whatever point this comes into fruition because he done, he done, he done wrote a, he done wrote a check. His ass can't cash.


Yeah. But you know, sometimes ocho when you dealing with, when you're dealing with situations, and we'll get back to this. Yeah, those shoes is that a lot of times it's the outside. 'cause when I was in college, all her girlfriends was in her ear. Right. Oh, he ain't the, I was like, do you understand? Right. Why you over the, and I I ain't rat him out. I said, but you know your girl's trying to holler at me. Right. Hey, what? Hey what? While they telling you I you shouldn't be with him. I don't know what you see in him. They the same ones when they catch me and you not around. They asking the same, I'm saying to myself, they asking the same why you with her?


You can do so much better. Hey, But okay, I said, you gonna let them talk you right outta the relationship. Yeah. And matter of fact, and and you know what, you know, you know what's funny? Is the one doing all the talking or why you with him, you ever notice they always single? Yes. Always notice they don't never had nobody or they misery Loves company. Listen, They, they bouncing from Pillar to post or they bouncing from Dick to Dick. But they want you in the same situation. They in. Yes. No consistency. Nobody you can depend on consistently come hell outta water. You know? Well, you know what, I know he always gonna be there for me no matter what. And guess what? Why they talking about, I don't know why. I guarantee you right now they'll switch positions with you, but they don't know why, why you wanna be with him.


But they'll switch positions with you and be with him. I don't know why women like that. I ain't never been in no situation. Hey bro, that's who you wanna be with. Take off. Yeah. Yeah. Have Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Enjoy It. I ain't gonna let you. I ain't gonna let you, I ain't gonna let you, you know, mess over my boy. Now if I see something, oh, I'm telling You gotta say something. You gotta say something. Damn. Listen, you can't, don't, don't let, Don't be talking about it ain't it ain't what you think. It's exactly what I think. So whatever you think, I think I'm thinking that's what I'm thinking. And I'm gonna tell him. That's what I thought. Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't leave me blind. Don't, don't leave me blind. Don't do that. Yeah.


I never, the switching shoes, regular, those, those straight tracks. I, I look, I bought a pair of the Big Baller because I, I'm, I'm a support. I'm a LA fan. I bought, I bought a pair too. I love, I love the fact that the way he, I love the way, the fact that he came for his boys. I love the fact that he and his wife Tina, he been rock solid. You know, she went through her little me, her medical issue. He was right there by her side. He never wavered. And he love, he loves his family. And I can respect that and I can appreciate that. But I mean, at the end of the day, Ocho, you're like the mind of the, you know, I think O Lonzo, I think Zoe really feel that that might have had an impact on his career.


It might have prohibited him from becoming what he could have become, because Ocho three years is a long time away from some, especially a professional sport. So that's a long, long time. Hey, we know you're a busy man, you too Ocho, but on your days off from first take, do you stay tuned in to some of the hot debates or watch any No, I don't, I don't watch any, I don't watch, I don't watch any of that. I do not. Because you gotta think about it, we, Ocho and I, we go five days a week. I'm doing two days a week of first take. And sometimes I take two episodes of Club Shehe.


The days that I'm off, I'm looking at stuff that we could possibly talk about right on Nightcap. I'm trying to find out, okay, who do I think my listening audience, my viewing audience would like to see me sit down and have a conversation with? So I, I don't know. I don't watch, I don't watch any, I don't watch any, if it's not a sporting events, no, I don't watch any debate. I don't watch First take when I'm not on, I don't watch anything else when I'm not on. I'm just trying to be the best I possibly can. I know what's expected of me when I show up. I know what Stephen a you know, gave me the opportunity. I'll, I I'm forever indebted to him for that.


But I know what they, they expect to get from me. I can and I'm not gonna disappoint 'em, but that's how I am. Even when my time was, because when we first started, Ash didn't, they used to have somebody to fill in us undisputed and then they, then we just went totally dark. I didn't watch. Hmm. I didn't, I don't, I don't watch But Dark Born said Detroit probably has the best team in the NFC if not the NFL. How scary could have been if Hutchinson hadn't gotten hurt. Yeah. Hutchinson Hutch was, Hutch was good. Very good. Very, yeah. But he, he, he's on his way to being, you know, he was, you know, he had what, six sacks in the first four or five games.


He was on his way to being a serious defensive player to your candidate. And hopefully he can come back next year a hundred percent healthy and pick up where he left off. But they're getting great production from z Zaius Smith Zaius is a professional. Go get the quarterback guy. That's what he is. He can rush from either side. He got great moves. You got great tenacity. I like I, I like, I like ZA lot. And so hopefully they can, they can put it together, but that, that back end is gonna have to get, they're gonna have to get a little better ojo. Right? Because you don't want, you don't, and here's the thing, but yet you can't let it come down to a call one way or another and have it impact the game Right When you leave it, when you a when you leave it, it's a three point game or it's a five point game or you down and you try to get the ball back, the last thing you want to do is to do something dumb.


That's the last thing that you wanna do. But they look good right now. They look really good. Kim Norwood Jr. Said if the Bears needed coach, I think it should be Ben Johnson because he's a great one. Yep. That's a good One. You like Ben going into the division? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like Ben. You know, listen, if you can't get Ben Shanahan is, is, is is next, next, the next big thing. You know, I think Ben could do wonders for, for Caleb Williams. He can do wonders for DJ Moore and Keenan Allen and, and and Mette with, again, with his creativity and having Deandre Swift. I'm not saying Deon is, you know, Jamir Gibbs and Montgomery, but he's good. He's good at what he does and you know, at the running back position, he can catch out the back field as well.


So with, with Ben Johnson's creativity, I think they will, they will be just fine. Or Shanahan, either one. You can't go wrong either way. Right. NFL matchup highlights said, what's up Gancho just wanna say thanks for the shout out. I made the video edit of Sterling versus Dion and I saw you guys post on Nightcap ig story. I feel like I made it appreciate that bro did a great job of that. My brother obviously has the ultimate respect. He's a year old. He got into the league in 89, time came in in 90. They had some great matchups time, has always had a very, had a fondness for my brother. He's always appreciated his work ethic and how he played, how he approached the game. My brother feels the exact same way.


It's always great when I see those guys get together and, and, and reminisce about the battles that they had. But it's, it's, it's great. That's one thing I can say about Tom. Like I I, I know him on a different level. Yeah. And it's, it, it's, it's funny how people perceive him and then when you know him on a different level, yeah, it, it is funny. But, but yeah. I appreciate that man. We appreciate that and thanks for letting us use it. Marcos Angel said, Hey Uncle Ocho, love the show. Could you do me a solid, shout me out. I turn 31 today. Any advice for a 31-year-old? Hey Marco, appreciate that. Thank you for your support. Thanks for watching. Thanks for listening.


And we, yeah, 31, keep living. Now the thing is, you need to be a better man you were today than you were yesterday. Yeah. And so when we have this conversation next year or five years from now, I want you to be able to tell me how you've improved as a man both professionally and individually, and that you allot you are exactly where you thought you would be. No. As a matter of fact, you are further than you thought you would be because that's what progress is about. Congratulations. Happy birthday, happy 31st birthday, man.


That's it Ocho. That is it. What's happen, me on that conclude? That concludes this episode of Nightcap. Thank you guys for watching us. After Thursday night football game, as you watch the Detroit Lions beat, the Green Bay Packers, their division rivals by the score of 34 to 31. The Lions are not 12 and one the Packers fall to nine and four. But it was a very good ball game. I think everybody got something out of this ball game. I think this is a far cry from some of the Thursday night games that we've had in the past, but this was a very good ball game. And thank you guys for spending your time with us after the game. Thank you for joining us for another episode of Nightcap.
