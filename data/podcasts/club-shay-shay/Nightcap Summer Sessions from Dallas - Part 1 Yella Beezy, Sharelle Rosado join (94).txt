Welcome to our final stop, stop on the Nightcap tour. We really appreciate it. Atlanta was unbelievable. Houston was great. And. we expect Dallas to be everything that those two stops were and more.

We got the heat of, we have a drink called Heat of the Moment and it's sponsored by Roe, the op spirit sponsored bill, op, op. Thank you guys for sponsoring Ocho. They were the first sponsor of this, of, of the tour. Also Old fashioned sponsored by Oscar Meyer. Make sure you guys stop by the merch table at the front of the lobby and get yourselves some T-shirts in Dallas hats during this trip. Dallas, we've officially launched by Cognac La Porter in stores across the state. So you, I know some of you, I saw some of you guys and you told me you were coming to the show. So I thank you guys for showing up both times.


Thank you. We really appreciate that guys. Bottle of Shea by BSOP for yourself. We've done two bottle signings at Total Wines and more to come. So check Instagram, la portier, cognac and see the next stock coming near you. Alright, Ocho, we gonna get this thing started right off the Arthur, the Muscle. Arthur Muscle. Alright, we have a new segment called what's Ali popping off where we discuss trending topics, making headlines and sports and culture. Big shout out to OP for coming up as our first sponsor. As we mentioned, nightcap summer session tour sponsor and being the presenting sponsor of this new segment. So what exactly is op? Think of it like this. It's a new kind of soda with 90% less sugar that we all grew up drinking and it's good for the gut.


So I've been drinking op, I like the ginger A, but they have great flavors. What else? We got this? Ah, I eat fruit punch. I had a fruit punch earlier. They got little fruit, ginger punch Ginger, ginger a that's orange. What is this ridge rush? Lemon lime. So guys, make sure you check out the new flavor Ginger Ale, the brand New Ridge Rush. Check it out. It's very delicious. And remember less sugar and it's good for the gut. So we're gonna start off with this Ocho, what's popping off today? Dak? Prescott is popping off today. Yeah? Yeah. Dak Dak Sicker. D oh oh. Hold on.


Hold on, hold on, Hold. Let, let's get this back. Hold on, Hold on, hold on, hold on, on. You know we gonna give you a chance. We gonna give you a chance Spot. Hold on. Hold. I know y'all ain't born my quarterback. See y'all need to be born. The owner. Shit. Dak revealed his frustration with Jerry yesterday. I stopped, honestly, this is what Dak said. Now, if he's misquoted And, we read it interpreted wrong. But this is what Dak Prescott said. He said I, I stopped honestly listening to things he says in the media a long time ago. It doesn't really hold weight to me. Dak knows he has the leverage here. They can't franchise him and they can't trade him. So he's set to become a free agent unless the Cowboys get something done before the season or during the season.


According to Mike Florio Dak age, talent level, and the fact that he plays at the Dallas Cowboys makes him one of the biggest free agents available in the open market since Reggie White. And remember it was Reggie White that started free agency in 1993. Reggie White free agency is still considered historic as one NFL analyst could see the next coming. Free agent decision by quarterback Dak Prescott Ocho. Yeah. Do you agree that Dak Prescott hitting the free agent market will have the type of seismic impact? Yeah. As Reggie White in 1993? Most definitely. The timing. The timing and everything. The timing of everything. And obviously the, the teams that actually need a quarterback to actually compete at the highest Level.


Yeah. That's about 15 teams. Yeah. And listen, you gotta think 15 teams are willing to pay for someone to compete. You have to understand what Dak has done for the Cowboys and the regular. I know they hasn't been much postseason success, I understand that. But to have a quarterback who can be efficient during the regular season at least, and at least give you a chance to get there, get to the postseason, and then I, once you find a way to get over that next obstacle, we can get to that point. Now, for me thinking, I think the issue really isn't with that because if you don't pay him what you got next, it ain't like quarterbacks are falling outta the goddamn trees like apples. It is very, very difficult to find a quarterback that's competent to lead the goddamn franchise and to be the kind leader that's done everything right. Like, like Dak has, right?


Yeah. I I, it is tough for D because he's like, okay, what else you need? I mean, Jerry, Keith putting this guy, he says, I'm going all in. I'm going all in. And, and Dak has said Dak iss. Like, I don't take anything that he says serious. I take everything he says with a grain of salt. I mean, he's into, you know, cliches and euphemism and all this other things that an 80 something year old man would would use. And Dak Dak is basically saying, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it. So the question is, are you guys tired of it? I mean, what are your expectations for the Dallas Cowboys this year? Man, stop saying Super Bowl. You know damn well, and he, he yelled a loudest Super Bowl.


I'm saying like, look like, like, like Sears. All of y'all, all of y'all live here in Dallas, right? And I'm, I'm always those of you from Dallas that are cowboy fans, do you think they should pay Dak? No. Y'all think they should pay Dak up there? This is the way Ocho looks at it. Ocho says, okay, if you don't pay Dak, who do you have lined up? You don't. But, but I promise you Who Cooper? Who? Cooper Rush Child. Please stop playing man. I'm Here with that.


I tell you what, your job might not have anybody replace you, but if they fire your ass, I guarantee you they'll fill that seat. Yeah. I guarantee you, if that doesn't come back to the cowboy, they're gonna gonna try somebody else out there next year. I mean, in 2025 O Joe, It's not gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same. You gonna start all over. You starting over from scratch and who want to deal with that? Like the, the, the problem for me, for me, from the outside looking in Jerry Jones is always that front of front center of the camera. You look at the other 31 teams, no other owner is always that front and center of the camera. Yeah. But that's what you want. You, you don't have to do that. The star on the helmet is gonna sell itself. The Cowboys itself, it already sells itself the product.


You don't have to say nothing. True. He adds more pressure on the players. He adds more pressure on the staff. Everybody walking on fucking eggshells and can't do they goddamn job. Wow. That's how you feel? Yeah. I mean, I mean, yeah. Yeah. Well imagine y'all go to work wherever you work at and your goddamn boss always looking over your shoulder, always doing all the talking, always calling a goddamn meeting. Always at like, you don't even play. You don't even play what you laughing at for real. Nah. You talking about the boss always called the meetings. Yeah. Man. So, so he done pull the sugar down. He all it, everybody fade. Yeah. He And everybody, Everybody knew press conference.


And the funny thing about it is, is he thinks his way works, his mindset. He had, there was a, there was an article came out I think two, three days ago. There's nobody else better fit to be the GM of the Cowboys than me. You ain't one in 27, 28, 30 something years. Right? Like at some point you gotta, you gotta get out your way. Right? You know what, my, my way ain't working. Let me hire somebody that, that might be good at it. That can change things around here. But You know how it is guys, when you are in a relationship, you know, a lot of times I would rather lose my way than win someone else's way. And the problem is, is that you don't realize the type of success you can have if you don't care who gets the credit. But Jerry cares who gets the credit.


He said he wants the credit. Damn. The man told you Ocho, He's the owner of the team. He gets the credit regardless no matter what. No, he didn't. Jimmy got that credit and he got Jimmy ass up outta here, didn't he? And he waited damn near 30 years to put him in the ring of Fame. Yeah. Yeah. So now as, as Cowboys fans, for those of you that are Cowboys fans, let's understand who the problem is. Thank you. Fucking thank you. But guess what? He gonna come back there and says, you know what? This is what his Steven does every year. This team reminds me a lot of those champ Super Bowl teams and y'all body, you know what heard what Jerry said? Jerry say this. Remind him of ate and Troy and Mike Hailey Dion.


Nah. Darren Woodson. No, no, no, No. You know what? You know what's funny? If you ever want change, if you really want change, the one way to hit someone with that kind of power and a position of that kind of power is to stop showing up. Stop going to the games. Watch what happened. Stop buying tickets, watch what happened. But we all love football too much. Y'all love your cowboys too much. So ain't nothing gonna change. No. Nah, Nah. But pay D bitch, that's It. I'm sure that money will be, look How long they look how long they made cd. Wait, look what they did. E Ezekiel Elliott. Like every time it's time for, excuse me, every time it's time for us to get paid.


They make us climb, scratch, crawl. We gotta sit down, we gotta wait out. We gotta sit in the corner. We gotta do everything just to get our money. Especially what we deserve. When you look at the, the the wide receiver market, there's no reason CD Lamb shouldn't have been in training camp. All training camp, right. And getting a few preseason games in. Because now you gotta think about it. Well, Some practices, even though he ain't Complain, get some practices nobody played. So now you gotta think about it. Next week you gotta hit the ground running. Yep. And you going from zero to a hundred miles an hour right away. And what's the first thing that happen when you ain't, when you just get a car, you just rev it up right away. Fucking inch Soft tissue. But knock on wood, let's hold that. Don't happen. Nah, come on cd stay healthy. CD makes you eat McDonald's CD don't eat no McDonald's.

Are you ready to have your baking loving? Mind blown Well, here it is. Oscar Meyer takes 12 hours to smoke some delicious thick cut bacon to perfection. Listen, most of the bacon out there is smoked for four to six hours. But Oscar Meyer doubles that time. Let me put that into perspective. You could drive from Detroit to Omaha and Oscar Meyer. Thick cut bacon still wouldn't be finished smoking. Check this out. You could go to bed. You can get a full night's sleep. Hell, you could wake up, shower, have breakfast, including some delicious Oscar Meyer bacon and then dry to work and that bacon would still be smoking. My point is that Oscar Meyer takes the best cuts and smoke some over real hard wood chips for a really long time until it tastes really good. So go out, buy some Oscar Meyer thick cut bacon now and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.

I don't know why he act like I'm in the dog house, but he is in the doghouse.


Nah, we, we beefing you. You know what, it's, it's something that's really funny. You know how you, you look at Instagrams, you look at Twitter, you look at just pictures in general when it comes to couples. You ever notice how they always show you the good? Everybody's always smiling. Everybody's always fucking happy. They don't never tell you about the motherfucking ups and the motherfucking downs. Why you Gotta curse so much? Huh?

Was it a day? Was it two days? Less Than five Seconds. Damn Ocho. I just happened to have my phone in my hand. Okay. Okay. My Phone, my phone was in my hand. Okay. But it wasn't five seconds. About 30 seconds. It was five seconds because I had to scroll through the pictures first and make sure she was when she was. And I saw the feet.


You saw the feet. I Saw the feet. And that's the only reason we together is 'cause I seen the feet. You know, I'm, I'm a I'm a foot guy. Yeah, I know. I Really can't help myself. So you a lot of guy. Yeah. Anything to end the o that too to elbow? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. All that. Yeah. So I, I seen a few got answered so fast. Boom. And I, how long I, maybe two days. So how long did it take y'all? Okay. You said the hard eyes. He responds. Oh damn. Near immediately. So how long before you guys actually met face to face? It Was about four weeks. Three and a half Closer. Hold, hold the mic closer. It Was about three and a half weeks. Okay. She lying. No, I'm not. I'm serious. For real. Yeah.

Yes she did. We Went to Green Bay. We talked and I was actually surprised because the guy who I thought I knew was a different person. Like, he, he spoke a lot. Very intellectual. I thought I was dealing with a, you know, a hood.


Yeah. Yeah. I could, I could be hood, I could add a switch. No, But he, he switched it up on me. Right. And And, we connected just like That. Yeah. I tried to be, I tried to be a gentleman. Right.

It was amazing. What advice would you offer women? Obviously you know, you, you are a savvy business woman. You built this brand, you built this business through a lot of hard work, a lot of determination.


What advice would you give women that want to follow in your path? I think, you know, choose you first. I was at a point where I felt like I needed to put, I was at a point where I felt like I needed to put my man first. Okay. And follow his dreams. But find you someone that supports you and go after your dreams. It only works. A lot of people think that you should put your kids first, but that's not true because you stress out. And in order for for everyone else to be happy, you have to be happy. So focus on your dreams, do what you need to do, communicate with your kids, with your spouse and everything else will fall in place.


So that's the biggest thing. Making sure that I'm set. If I'm set and I'm good to go, then everybody else attached to me will be good. How did the military, obviously everybody knows, I don't know if they know, but Rell was, Sherell was in the military. So how did that military, because you know you have to be disciplined, you have to be structured, you have to be punctual. How has that helped you in your business? It taught me discipline. It taught me how to deal with different personalities. I do own a brokerage. I deal with different personalities. So it did teach me how to be able to lead different personalities. I mean everyone is not the same. It taught me structure, mainly discipline, how to lead.


I did 13 years in the army, two tours to Afghanistan. I jumped outta airplanes. I was a ba a badass motherfucker. Yeah. That what I'm talking about re Yep. Yep. And she pulled the gun on me twice. He lying. No, for real. Yeah. Oh. But when I told you old girl pulled one on me. You talking about Yeah, but that wasn't your girl. That was somebody else girl. That's the difference. Chubby lying. I did not. But it de it definitely taught me discipline and you know how to control my emotions and how to communicate.


Because you di you are dealing with different personalities and people wasn't raised how you were raised. Correct. You learned a lot. What? You travel a lot. I mean, Ocho say you've already been to Turks and Caicos like three times this year. You travel a lot. Obviously when you're in the military you move around a lot. But what are some of the destinations that you haven't gone that you would like to go to? Africa. Africa? Yes. That's my next destination. So you wanna do like a, you wanna do like a safari, you wanna go to the Sey shells? You wanna go to Zanzibar? I mean, where do you wanna Go? I'm doing it all with or without Chad. I who coming with me.


Oh Joe, you don't like to travel? No he don't. I everywhere she want to go out and been two, three times already. No, you have not. Name somewhere. Name somewhere. I ain't been Yet. Our first place was the Maldives. You never went there. We went together. Oh yeah, that's right. Exactly. But that don't count. 'cause ain't nothing not there. You haven't been to Dubai. I just ain't nothing not there. For me. It is. It's A lot. What's the only reason I travel to do what? The only reason I travel is to watch what Soccer. I mean even they know that I just don't be. But soccer ain't in the Maldives. I Know, but it was your birthday. That's the only reason I went. You Came because of me. So that ain't the only reason why you travel It. School was nice. I'm just, I'm not into traveling.


I'm not into sightseeing. I'm not into taking pictures. Like You gotta compromise. I like to travel. You gotta have the compromise with I did compromise. You know how I compromise? Huh? Compromise. That ain't compromising. You don't think so? No. Why? You Need to know what you want. That ain't, I don't want That is I know I wanted you so I put okay. No. Yeah, look at her. She's smiling. oj she smiling. Ocho. You see how violent she is. Next Question. What advice would you offer young mothers? Because you have kids and to juggle kids, juggle your business, juggle a relationship.


How difficult and what advice would you like to share with some of these young women out here? It's very hard. And don't get discouraged. Like go after your dreams. Have a village. I don't do it all on my own. Like my father is here, Papa, he helps out a lot. And a lot of people will say bad things. Oh, you're not taking care of your kids, this, that, and the third. But you know, the bigger picture, like, you know, your end result. You don't have to explain anything to anyone else. As long as you're communicating with your inner circle your babies, letting them know this is why I'm doing this because this is the bigger picture. That's all that matters. Wow. So what was the, the, the hardest part about starting a business?


Because I mean, I don't know if you've ever owned a business before, but what was the hardest part that you would say was the hardest part to get this thing off the ground and get it moving? So quick story. I did 13 years in the military. Right. When I knew I was medically returned, I started my business. Okay. And everyone around me was like, you crazy. You about to give up 13 years. You need to get a GS job, a government job, and go back in. And I'm like, no. So I started my business while I was still active duty military. Okay. Wow. So once I medically retired my, my leave date, I jumped right into my own business. Wow. So I didn't even have time to even think about the hard parts because once I jumped into my business, I started recruiting.


Then I landed a TV show. My business wasn't even set up for three months. And I had a show on Netflix. Do you always know you wanted to be a business woman? Yeah. Give her a round applause. That's unbelievable. It's, it was a lot of hard, like, I I, I had a lot of criticism. I had a lot of, oh, y'all ain't doing nothing, y'all. But the biggest picture was to show us as minorities, us as black women, that we can get into luxury as well. When I first got into real estate, it's like, I was like, how can I sell 2 million, 3 million? They was like, girl, it is all about who, you know. Nobody had the, the blueprint. And I wanted to change that. So I recruited some women and I took a different route and it got me to Netflix.


But what was your question? 'cause I got No, did you always know you wanted to be an entrepreneur? Did you always know you wanted to be a business woman? Honestly, I didn't have a plan. I was a teenage mom. I lost my track scholarship. A lot of people don't know that. Yes, I was a 400 runner. You see? Yeah. You See these legs. But I lost my track scholarship and it wasn't about me anymore. It was about my child. Okay. So I decided to go into the military. I didn't have a plan. I did 12 years, 12 and a half, 13 years. And I was like, I'm tired of working for people. I seen people stress out diet, the age of 55 working for the government.


I was like, I'm, I wanna be my own business owner. And it just blew up from there. Yeah. O Joe, Hold on now. Now what she did that is, is, is is I I'd help too. Now what you Help with? Oh, Not with the business because the business was here before you came along, baby. Okay. But you did help once you came into my life. You did help take it to that next level. Oh, Level. Let me, okay, lemme get you together now. Don't Do that. But the business was business before, right? Right. I gave you a little catapult. Now don't do, don't do. Okay. You did. You did. I'm gonna give y'all, I'm gonna give you your credit. Yeah. So y'all, so, so really y'all, y'all business partners?


Not how ojo? No, we are not business partners. He Supports, okay. You can't mix business and pleasure. No sir. You can't do that. I don know nothing about real estate. My business, I don't know about real estate at all. He supports a lot. And I'm truly grateful for that baby. Yeah. I, I'm in, I'm in the streets. My business is my business. What? Streets? In The streets. Oh, No streets. Oh, I Thought you said she. No, you're not. I called the other day. I said, Ocho, let's go do something. Oh, I'm already to bed. I was in bed. Oh, I let tell y'all. So y'all wasn't there for Houston. He was trying to act all hard and bad, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. She in the dog house. I leave early, go back to the hotel. 'cause I was tired. I had an early flight back to Tampa.


Where you staying at? I was like, I thought you was going outre there. That's not the I she had, She had my what? I got Text. She had my watch. What? I didn't have shit. Nah, I had left my watch in her purse. I just wanted to go get my watch. What, what? What's your room number? I like that Ocho. That's nice. Knocking at the door. You start, you, you, you, you like dating the process all over again. Yeah. It's like first time, like, Hey, where you at? You knocked on the door. Yeah. Yeah. You ain't knocked too hard 'cause you didn't wanna disturb the neighbor. You like, so how you gonna talk about you and the dog? Go on to give kids. Go ahead. We in public.


Come on man. I'm shy. That's my dog. Man. Look here, man. Y'all, y'all, y'all amazing together man. I lo I love Look, everybody's gonna go through something. If you're in a relationship to say that it's, it's peaches and cream every single day. Absolutely. It's not. It's Not. And I think, I think I love the fact that people do watch us. I mean, they go to the extreme, I'm not gonna lie, but Chad and I are normal just like everyone else out here. We go through things, you know, we shut down with each other. We need a break. She's Stubborn. You stubborn too. She's stubborn. But At the end of the day, our love overpowers everything. And you know, we have a, a great family.


We have great support and that's all that matters. And. we keep God first. Well, you know what, since y'all back together, thank you guys. Dallas, Rell, Rosado. Dang. I'm done already. Yeah. Bye.

Are you ready to have your bacon loving? Mind blown. Well, here it is. Oscar Meyer takes 12 hours to smoke some delicious thick cut bacon to perfection. Listen, most of the bacon out there is smoked for four to six hours. But Oscar Meyer doubles that time. Let me put that into perspective. You could drive from Detroit to Omaha and Oscar Meyer. Thick cut bacon. Still wouldn't be finished smoking. Check this out. You could go to bed. You can get a full night's sleep. Hell, you could wake up, shower, have breakfast, including some delicious Oscar Meyer bacon and then dried to work and that bacon would still be smoking. My point is that Oscar Meyer takes the best cuts and smokes them over real hard wood chips for a really long time until it tastes really good. So go out, buy some Oscar Meyer thick. Cut bacon now and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.

I can't think of anybody else from Dallas that rap besides yourself. What was, who was your, who would Come on Natalie? What? What is he talking about man? Who? Who you got? Get him together. Get him together. Y man, get him together man. I got a lot of stuff going on man. Gimme a little Homework. Who you got? Who you got Got Darro. We gotta check it out with Darro.

So those, those were your influences growing up that made you want to get into the rap, get into the music industry? Yeah, the older ones for sure. The older ones for sure. Gatorade, low dey, you know, it's, it is a it. It's a line open. What about sports? Were you involved in sports when you growing up as a kid? Football. Football. What position? What position you play? Running back and I was like that. You was like That. I was like, I was him.


Him. Well something made you go start getting on the mic instead of, you know, taking them licks. That was, I was getting in trouble. It wasn't like that now Don, we ain't gonna act like that. Like that. I was getting in trouble getting kicked outta school. That what that was and Right. I had just let it go. So when did you make a decision? Say, you know what? Okay, the music thing, the rap. That's, that's, that's my calling. Probably like 17, 18. I was in school. I had a song and it kind of went crazy when I did that talent show. So I was like, I'm gonna take this shit serious job. Hey, to me your breakout hit, that's on me. Yeah. Put you on the map. After that song, how did your life change? So for me real quick to give you a quick story, to give you a better context on why I'm asking you.


When I got drafted, see if I got drafted on Tuesday, my Wednesday life was completely different when that hit came out where life had to be completely different. So for you, how did life change after that? I was on the road like 24 7. Like going to places. I was meeting cousins. I ain't never met people with Kyle. It was just, you know, it was just like a life changing experience, bro. I ain't gonna lie, I was outta town more than I ever been. I was just like, man, I knew, you know, I made it. Then when they started calling back out of town shows I was like, yeah, I, I'm doing something. How do, how do you, I think the thing and Ocho can tell to this being like how we are is that friends, how do you like keep that inner circle?


The people that you came up with that you know, that you trust. Have you had to put some people by the side and go on this journey alone by yourself? It's a couple new ones, but mostly everybody that, that's around me. I've been around 'em since I was about 13. So we like years in. I don't really hang with a lot of new people. I like that. I don't, I don't, I don't like energy like that different energy, you know? I don't, I don't trust people. Right. Another, another thing we have as athletes, once we do make it, do you have a problem with family members and everybody always asking and asking and asking and, and what people would do is if a petit ask and ask until they bleed you dry, do you have a problem saying no? 'cause I notice what most rappers, everybody has a entourage.


Yeah. And most of the time the person that takes care of that entire entourage, is that one alpha. Right? That's leading, leading the way. Nah, I ain't got no problem saying no. Like I'll tell you like you ain't, I look out for a prison, but you not finna just keep on doing it just because you know I got it. Like Right. If you ain't gonna do nothing with the money, it's like I'm giving it in vain. You know what I'm saying? I I'm only gonna take care of the people I'm supposed to take care of. Yes sir. The, you know what I'm saying? Home, my mama, my granny, like stuff like that. But I don't have people around me who feel like they obligated either. You know what I'm saying? My partners all kind of wanna pull they own way to try to do they own thing. Yes sir. But if they need me, they know I got 'em. You know what I'm saying? So it's already understood. I I, I got real people around me like real friends. So it ain't never been nowhere.


It's like everybody just wants something. Just wants something. But I tell a nigga like, yeah like you know, you just, you on your last one, you ain't finna keep on doing it. Now Do do your do. 'cause a lot of it is hard to tell family. No, because like you said, a lot of your partners have been with you since you were 13 and 14. Family's been with you since day one and sometimes they can make you feel guilty because if it was me, I would, I would do it for you. I still know how to say no. Like you can't, you can't, you can't butter me up. Like you hear what I'm saying? I know who was around. I know who, who really like supported me. I like, that's cool. You know what I'm saying? But like, if I say no, I say no and I ain't gonna lie.


Like a lot of people don't even got my number. Like if it's some extended family members, my mama kind of, you gotta go through my mama anyway. 'cause she ain't have like my mama ain't trying to have hear none of that to this day. Like she ain't trying to hurt none of that. You opened up for Jay-Z and Beyonce on, on the Run tour two. What was that experience like? It's like, it was different. Like 70, 60,000 people. Like that was something like I ain't never experienced. And then when I came out, like the hometown just showed love, hometown, always gonna show love. So it was just like a beautiful thing. Is it, is it everything that you doing what you did? 'cause for me, like all I want to do was make money to get my grandmother, to get my family outta that environment.


I mean, I really didn't think about like 70, 80,000 fans cheering for me. That wasn't what I really wanted. I wanted, I wanted the fortune, the Fame. I could, I could have done without. But obviously that's a part of it. Is it everything that you imagine that when you like in your bed and you thinking about, man, I'm, I'm going on this journey and one day I'm gonna be 60, 70,000 in a, in a, in a stadium, not arena a stadium. Is it everything you thought it would be? Yeah, like it's like a bittersweet feeling. 'cause like you pray for a lot of stuff and then when you actually living your dream, bro, like you gotta understand like it's a lot of people out here praying to be in your position. You know what I'm saying? It's a lot of people been chasing dreams 30, 40 years and ain't seen no success with it.


So I'm one of them that can actually say that I made it. So every chance that I get, bro, I'm gonna pray about it. I'm gonna thank God and be grateful for everything because like it's a lot of people that want to be in my position. Yeah, that's that's a good One. What are some of the things that came along with this, this Fame that you came with that you didn't expect? Yeah, for sure. A lot of hate. A lot of it is one of those situations like damn, if you do, damn, if you don't, right? And it is like one of 'em situations where you, you gotta just really just, you gotta be built for it. 'cause a lot of people, if you not built for this like success, success will tear you down too. That that's, that's the side that they don't tell you like, it's a lot of credit. Like they gonna critique everything you going you do.


They going to think whatever they think about you. You know what I'm saying? If you want to change that narrative, you can, but at the same time you gotta have tough skin. 'cause people going to hate, they going to be jealous. They going to envy you. They gonna just say anything there And. if you let it get to you, like it'll tear a motherfucker down. Like, you know what I'm saying? But I ain't never been a type that let it tear me down. But it, I I didn't know it was gonna be like so much bullshit like to come along with the, you know what I'm saying? Yes. Yes. The funny thing with the bullshit, it only happens because of success. So now that you have the success, what has continued to inspire and motivate you to continue to want to climb that mountain and ladder in your, in your craft? I just wanna shit on motherfuckers who don't think it's still in me or like everybody that hate.


I like I I'm glad y'all hating on me. I'm glad that you feel like it's something sweet. 'cause I, I love proving motherfuckers wrong. Like it's, I'm here for a reason, you know what I'm saying? Like, God ain't bringing me this far just to turn his back on me. So I damn sure ain't finna let no motherfucker tell me like otherwise. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I like it. Listen, you, you, you've collaborated what some dope ass major artists is that one person you haven't had a chance to collab with that you want to? Besides me? I gotta get one with the light-skinned nigga man. Drake. I got you bro. It is just, we gotta, we, you know, dark skinned y'all, you know y'all, I'm dark at heart but you know y'all, y'all, y'all y'all been picking on us since we was, you know, since, since the beginning of time.


So I gotta, I gotta do I would do it in the Eighties though. In the eighties. Y'all ran the eighties? Yeah, I, I probably, yeah, I ain't gonna lie, I definitely would've been shitting on y'all in the eighties. I ain't gonna lie to you. I would've had a different type of attitude. Michael Jackson, prince Elder. Yeah, I would. Y'all had 'em all. I would've had a perm and everything. Bush. Hey, we best around got Michael Jordan, we snipe. They was over for y'all. Yeah, We don't talking the Charges, they Zel man, come on man. Where the yelling niggas at? But nah, gotta be Drake. I wanna do one with Nicki. Okay. I wanna do some Afrobeat too. Like with, with Burno boy, I want to get one Rihanna too. I ain't gonna lie. And Vibe Cortel just came home free him.


I mean, shout out to him. I wanna do one with vibes. I wanna do something with just everybody, bro. I ain't gonna lie to you. I've, you know what, now he think about the names he just named. Right? Right. Like some of the biggest in the world man. What's the process like? Do You to get the phone And be like, Hey, I got something, I wanna send it to you, I wanna work with you. How does that work? I really think that go off like relationships. Like you just gotta be at the right place at the right time. Right time. I tell people all the time, relationships are worth more than money. Yes sir. You know what I'm saying? Like certain shit you just can't buy. Like people just gotta want to fuck with you genuinely. Yeah. And that's why I get like a lot of my features like it, people be thinking like, damn, I I know he paid for this, he paid for that bro. I don't be paying for nothing. Like niggas literally be looking out for me just off the street just 'cause of who I am and how, what type of awesome genius, what soul I have.


You know what I'm saying? Which is the blessing, you know what I'm saying? I don't be thinking like I'm gonna get it for free just nigga, nah, I fuck with you. It'd be really be fucking me up though. You know what I'm saying? But relationship, just being solid, having a good face card to take a motherfucker far in life. That's awesome. That's unbelievable. I tell people that all the time in business. People think business is about money, business is about relationship because a lot of times that since I've been in business for myself, a lot of times that people that I've met, they're in position. They weren't in that position in the beginning, but as they've climbed the ladder, they become CFOs, they become CEOs. It ain't what ain't what you know about who you know. And they say, man, I remember when I was such and such and the way you treated me and the way you, I I introduced you to my dad.


I introduced you to my brother, my friends and man. And I said, hey, this is the guy I wanna be a part of. And so it's all about relationships. You think it's about money and all, it's about relationships fault. You never know. You never know who's gonna be in a position to help you. So just make sure you treat people on the way when you're trying to rise because you never know who's gonna be in a position to really help you out. Lemme ask you this. We talked about this earlier. You and I were talking about this in the Green Room. What's your expectation for the Cowboys? We know you, you believe that blue and silver, you love the blue and silver.
