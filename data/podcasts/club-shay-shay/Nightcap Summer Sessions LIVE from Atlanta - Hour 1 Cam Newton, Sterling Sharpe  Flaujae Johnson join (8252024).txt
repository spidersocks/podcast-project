Alright, without any further ado, the guy that's coming to the stage right now, he's your head coach of the Atlanta Falcon Falcons. Mr. Raheem. Morris. Yeah. He back there watching on TV when he should have been standing at the side. Right here. Here he is. Ladies gentlemen. Raheem Morris. Hey, the man changed the script. Guys, Before we even start, I just want to know, do you need some fresh legs out there at camp? Say that again?


Do you need some fresh leg? I can still go. I promise you. I tell uncle all the time. I still got it. Even at, listen, even at 56 I, I'll tell you this, Ocho definitely can gimme a couple of releases. There We go. And then we're gonna stop right there, guys. Yeah. We got no routes Coach. How you doing? I'm doing outstanding. I'm in this beautiful city of Atlanta. I got, I got one of the best fan bases in, in the National Football League and And, we about to go out and earn it pretty soon. And. we got so much to prove to the city for the people. We bringing this thing back and, and it's just an exciting time. Coach, this is your second time being a full-time, NFL head coach.


What can you take into this experience that you learned from your first time being a head coach in Tampa? What, what is the difference between that Raheem Morris and this Raheem Morris? I, I say this so many times, Shannon, that the biggest difference when you're 32 years old, you got all the answers. You know, the 47-year-old Raheem Morris, I'm such a better listener and I can take that into account. I'm able to, to detail my work. I'm not surround myself with, with people that can gimme great information. I'm able to listen to those things, take it in, make decisions, be able to sign guys like Justin Simmons, be able to sign Matthew ine, be able to take this, take this thing and listen to the people, listen to the fans, you know, innovate and create every single day. Be a part of the culture that's here, that's been built already. And like all of those things in my life are different because of the experience I was able to go through.


I remember you came down and been with in 2012, 2012 in DC I was with Mike Shanahan. I got a chance to go to LA and do these different things and be around different head coaches. And I've just grown so much since that moment. And that was right after becoming a head coach. Listen to you talk and the passion and the energy that you bought trying to get players like you two to come play for me. And that's what I wanted. And that's what we got. You draft the court, look you signed Kirk Cousins in free agency, the eighth pick roll around. There's a quarterback available, you take a quarterback. You've been around the NFL for 25 years. You understand the dynamic with quarterbacks. They're different than any other position. No doubt. So when you signed Kurt, did you think Pennix Pennix Jr.


Would be available? And once he was available, you make that decision that we're gonna draft him? What was the conversation like between if you had a conversation with Kurt cousins or you didn't have a conversation or you had a conversation with his agent? It Goes back well before even a conversation with Kurt is when I got the job coming to him in the interview process, the, the process was about Kurt, you coming in, you wanna get immediate winner right now. Okay. And how do you do that? Go get Kirk Cousins. Okay. And that was a part of my interview script. That was a part of my plan. Arthur Blank, sell a vision, sell a dream. Terry Fondo, here it is. How do we find a way to go get him, put him in part of this fold so we can go win football games right now. And if we go get him, we gonna be in no position to draft the quarterback in the next couple of years.


You know, when you, when you talk about quarterbacks, we understand how important that position is, obviously, in order to sustain a consistent success for any team. If you look at the top teams in the NFL, it always comes down to the quarterback position. Is there, is there a disconnect in any way with the quarterback competing with each other, understanding the pressures that are on Kirk Cousins, if he doesn't play well, that in job is in jeopardy. I think, I think the message was clear coming in, right? It was open. It was honest. It was clear. Kurt's our starter. Yeah, Kurt's gonna take us to places that we want to go to. Okay. And Michael's gonna come in and he's gonna watch what it looks like, what it feels like. He wanna see what it looked like When you had your quarterbacks on your day with John Elway.


He wanna see what it looked like. You ain't having no quarterbacks, but what it looked like to go out there. You've been a, you've won Super Bowl at two different stops. You've been an assistant on a lot of different head coaches. What is the common denominator between winning and losing The people? Mm. It's a people first business in everything we do. When you were a Raven, I watched it live in hand. I came into that stadium and I watched the confidence in the people. I watched Ray Lewis talk smack. I watched you talk smack And. we went in there like, man, we about to beat 'em and then y'all let us know after the game that y'all wasn't. And it was, it was, it was the people that was involved with the organizations.


It was all about that. And here we're building a people first business and we're doing it with us. We're doing with our people, with our fans. And like, I just think that's just the messaging. Like you gotta have that type of mentality. It's gotta be a people first mentality. It has to be at all times in everything we do. We're talking about with the fans, we're talking about with our community. We're talking about in the building, we're talking about with myself and Terry font, knowing our relationship Art the blank and how he communicates with everybody. How we go about our whole process. It's the people. It's the people. It's simple As a coach, you know, players, we come into a season with a goal in mind. We set goals and goals that we wanna hit, standards we want to maintain throughout a season. As a head coach for the Atlanta Falcons, what are your personal goals for this season?


You know, it's hard to set goals when you're head coach. 'cause everybody's got the same one. Super Bowl. We, we all, we all got the same one. Right? And, and make no mistake about it, And, if you don't win it, obviously you don't feel like you reach your ultimate goal. I was fortunate enough to do it twice. You were fortunate enough to do it three times. And I'm gonna lap your ass. I did it. I did it. I did it on Madden. I did it. I Did it. That shit count. Fuck that. We, We, we count, we count those two. Yeah. Count That. I know. But seriously, you, you, you had a chance. I remember you and TO teamed up. Yeah. You walked in there. We went. Oh, we went four and 12 that year. We, We, we walked, we walked. Y'all did And.


we went four and 12. Me and T. Oh, I don't know what happened. I Don't know what it was. I know what happened. A young young man named Cody Grim playing safety for Raheem Morris got a pick six on your boy walked it in And. we was talking Smack Smack. That's right, that's right. That's right. Oh, I know that's right. That's right. That's Right. I'm a reminder, Ah, Haven't played this game as long as I have having been around it. When I tell people, and I I, and I haven't, I've never, I've been to a Falcon game where my brother played. That was many, many years ago. Old Fulton, Fulton County Stadium. But from the outside looking in, I say the Falcons are unlike any other stadium because if you go to it and you watch it, it's an experience. It's an experience like no other And. if you convince those fans that you're gonna win.


You saw how excited Troy was in the, in, in, in, in the green room back there. You see how these fans are. How do you, how do you your message like, I'm a winner. I've won. I know what it takes to win. How do you get this fan base behind y'all and say, look, we need y'all to show up in Pittsburgh. The first game is Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh travels. Well, how do you get 'em to make sure they don't sell them tickets and show up? I, I can tell you right now, Atlanta's not built that way. Okay? We all from everywhere, right? Yeah. We all from everywhere. We from New York, we from Philly, we from everywhere. We from Atlanta from all these places. Right? But Tampa. But this is how you do it.


I was here in 2016. You gotta earn it. And then I know the people that were here in 2016, remember what that dome felt like when we played Green Bay, that last game versus Seattle. They know what that felt like inside that dome. And you gotta find a way to earn it and bring that back. Now you gotta go finish the deal. And that's what we're trying to do. So if you go out there and earn it with these fans, they're gonna show up. They're gonna show out, and it's gonna be just energy in the building that's just unmatched. And they gonna love you for life Forever As a, you are a veteran coach. Now. You, I mean you, like you said, when you first got your head coaching job, you were 32 years of age. Sure. Now you're 47. This is your second stop. So now what is Rahe, what is your mentorship or leadership role as you give back to coaches that are in their first year?


You know, it's awesome 'cause that's what you do consistently throughout this whole business where I see young coaches all the time, and the whole goal is to always give back. So if we have ways to ever find ways to give back, whether it be youth coaches, whether it be high school coaches, whether it be college coaches, whether it be coaches from within that's on the rise. I'm finding that new young Raheem Morris, like Mike Tomlin found me. I'm finding that guy like rest in peace, Monty K found me. And be to bring those guys into your organization and teach 'em your ways and then let them go out and branch off a little bit and find their own way. Right? And then you find your own identity and what it means to be a coach and how you wanna form your script and how you want to touch each and every person out here and the individuals that you coach. Right? I I, I've been fortunate enough to be able to touch people's lives. Whether you're talking about with Rde Barber from way back in the day when we're the same age and I'm able to touch his life.


Or you're talking about Jalen Ramsey win a championship out in LA and you're able to touch his life and you become a different coach in his eyes just because of the presence that you have every day and the amount of effort that you're giving that one individual to make him better. And I wanna make everybody in my team feel that way. That I'm trying to make them better no matter what the circumstances are, what this competitive, what there's something I can give 'em to make 'em better. Whatever the case may be. You gotta be willing to go deeper than that because the relationships matter more than anything. I got a question. That's a good one. Being a head coach, obviously when you started, you were 32, now that you're 47 and there was just a small issue with, with Tua and Mr. Brian Flores. Sure. As a head coach now, how do you navigate knowing which players you can coach hard and which players which have to push?


Yeah. Which ones you can push. Like how, how do you navigate that? Because the era, the era of players not is different. I ain't calling nobody soft, but you just, you gotta, you gotta navigate a little different. So I'm saying, how do you do that in today's era where the players are making who God knows how much money and really don't take coaching that well. You can't do irregular things with regular ass relationships. Ooh, shit. Wow. Hold on. Oh, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Write that down. Write That down. Don't Joe, stay with me now. Stay with me. Stay with me. I got, ain't nobody got no pen. Well that was a good one. Boy, that was a good one. Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that one more time. Lemme put it in my phone. You, You can't do irregular things with regular ass relationships.


I'm gonna use that word real. So, So when, when you, when you, when you live in an era that these players live in right now, right? And not just at our level, right? I'm talking like high school, your kids, right? They live in this social media area. When they go home and they lose a game, they didn't just lose it in front of whoever was at the stadium that night. They lost it in front of the whole state. They lost it in front of, across the world, across the nation. And the stuff that's happening with these kids and how they press that mental health is real because so many people know when you drop that pass, when you dropped it, about 16 people knew right?


When I, when our high school kids dropped the pass. Now, I mean, the whole world knows. And how do you address that and how do you go about that business? Right? You let 'em know. You in it with 'em. Right? I'm gonna be right there with 'em. I, I remember Jalen Ramsey had a bad game versus the Buffalo Bills on the opener after we won a Super Bowl. I went to his house and I told him, I don't give a damn about none of that. And. we coming out next week, And, we gonna show out And, we gonna go get it and I'm gonna fight right with you. And I'm like, I'm, I'm gonna sit in this lab. Yes, Stephan D's got the best of us that day. Yeah. Right? But the next guy gonna get it on his behalf. Right. They wanna know you there for 'em. Like, and you gotta have that type of style. Like, and you can coach people hard. They'll let you coach 'em hard. You can and you know who you can, you know who want that motivation. Right? You know who wanna be driven.


Yeah. You smart enough to figure it out. You wanted to be driven. You a pit bull, right? You, you, that's who you are. You wanna be that guy, right? Right. And then there's guys, you gotta go pat it back a little bit and bring 'em with you. Okay? That's all. Lemme ask you this and we're gonna get you out here on this one. Rahe, I ain't going nowhere. I'm leading this show. But you can say as long as you want. Obviously you had other opportunities. How do you convince coaches that look like you, that don't feel like that opportunity is ever gonna come? Because you had, think about it, there was a 15 year gap Sure. Between the time that you were the head coach until you got it again and you had interviews and did you ever think like, man, I don't know if I'm gonna ever get another chance to be a head coach Again.


So you ready to Shannon this? It's real simple for me, right? I was a 3-year-old head coach and I did it again. And people were telling me, you should have had it a long time ago. I don't give a damn what your people were saying. I'm gonna work for it. I'm gonna go get it. And when it happens, I'm gonna be ready. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep developing my skillset that when it happens again, there's gonna be no denying on what you can and how you're gonna be able to do it and go about your business. And I don't give a damn what color I am. Results don't know color like It, like it, You look at what you've done.


You got Grady Jar, you bring him back, you signed Justin Simmons, you signed Matthew Judon. You just gave AJ Terrell boat load of money. You locked him up. I drafted him too. Don't forget. You did. You did draft him. So what is the expectations of this defense? Considering you've got guys that have been pro bowls that have been to the all pro. AJ Terrell's, one of the better young corners in the league. And, we know Gary. Jared is one of the outstanding defensive linemen in the league. What is the expectation That's your area of expertise As you know, as you know, it's really simple, right? Stats are for Loses Yes. Their expectations to go out there and beat dogs. Mm. Right? We gotta find ways to affect the quarterback and make 'em just feel uncomfortable at all times.


And once you find a way to make 'em uncomfortable and you dominate rundowns and you get the ball back, then just go watch our offense shine. Right? That's what winning teams do. That's how you form your identity. That's how you make things move. That's how the needle moves. And the next thing you talking about it on your shows about the stats, we don't care about none of that. We care about the dog mentality it's gonna take to get there. That's what our, that's what our goal is. That's what our, that's, that's what the expectations are. I like it. Ladies and gentlemen, Atlanta Falcons head coach. Your head coach. Raheem. Morris Man. I see y'all. Alright. What time practice in the morning?


They got me working. They got me getting the mic. Alright guys, hold On. Go ahead. Waymo. Where you at? Waymo? Who? Waymo. What's up? What's up boy? Shit. Love you boy. Appreciate you coming to support that. My homeboy, we were locked up together. Oh, okay. Yeah. That my dog. Well, one or two things just happened. Either he just got out or they looking for him because he real quiet. Hey.

'cause like during the season, coach Mokey like, all right, this is my time. You know what I'm saying? That was kind of, that was kind of our like, you know, that was kind of our deal. Like, you know, you give me everything you got in the season and in the summer I'm gonna let you rock and do your music. So yeah, Tell us the story.


I saw you over at Cannes and you was telling the story that you had a concert one night. Yeah. You had to do the concert. Yeah. But you had to fly back, got back early in the morning. You was sleepy, you was tired. But you know, you had to get it because Coach Mokey was going to be on your, you know, what had you not. Yeah, no. So what happened was Rod wave, he gave me the, like, the chance to open up for him in Atlanta. So we had a game that night the next day after games, we always have off days. So I flew to Atlanta on my off day and then I drove back seven hours to go to br. Right. And like I'm already knowing it's a stigma of like, nah, she can't do both for real. Like, you know what I'm saying? So I don't even wanna give people a thought to even be like, oh, she came to practice and she was tired.


Nah, when I came to practice I was like bouncing off the walls for real. Like, because I knew that I had to come in and kill. You know what I'm saying? And I was the first one in the gym last one out. Like always. So, I mean my, my, my mindset, you know what I'm saying? I think it's more mind over matter. I think your mind can make you do things that your body sometimes won't allow when you determine. And that's how I feel like I work all the time. You know what, we all have dreams as when we growing up as kids. Obviously my dream, I want to be in NFL player. One of your dreams I'm sure is to play in the WNBA. Yeah. Will you continue to your path as far as how, I don't how, I don't wanna word the right way actually wanting to rap as well and be able to balance both at the, at the highest level.


Yeah. I think it'll be easier, honestly, because, you know, I, I don't have as much commitment. Yeah. Like, oh my gosh, what school you got? You got school first of all, then you got tutoring sessions and all of that and you got weights and you got all the other, you know, required practice of the athlete, practice everything. So I think it'll be easier, you know what I'm saying? To be able to build my schedule and how I wanna do, my goal is to like play an arena during the day and then sell out that same arena at night. Like playing basketball. That's My, that what I'm talking about. That's live. You gonna have to work that out with the coach. I don't know if she gonna be going for that one. She better Go Flau. You just dropped your project called Best of Both Worlds in July.


It is a nine song studio ep. What was your process? Have you, have you always wanted to do an album? Well, yeah, it's a, it's a ep, not really album, you know, I want to save the album title for when I do my big one. Okay. But yeah, I mean just putting together a body of work. You know what I'm saying? That's always been a goal of mine. And like, you know, having Lil Wayne on it was just like, I knew I needed that big stamp, that big co-sign, right? Like this girl, she dropped a project. Okay, it's cool. Like she go to LSU, that's a vibe. But like when you got Lil Wayne on it, it kinda hold some weight, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And so it was just important for me to put that out. And the title was important because it was just like, I really got the best of both worlds, you know? When did you realize that you could rap?


When I was on America's Got Talent, I was on America's Got Talent when I was about 14 and I got the golden buzzer and like Simon Cowell came to the back and he was like, you know, one day you could be a superstar. And I'm like, bro, I'm like, that's Simon Cowell. Like he don't even like singers for real. Like, so him, him telling like a young black girl that she can, like, he sees some type of superstar power in her that kind of just, you know, just gave me the confidence that I could do it. Because like right before America's Got Talent, I was on the rap game with Jermaine Dupree and I lost. And so I, that was like, when I lost that, I went into my room and I just wrote all day. Right? And then America got talent called and I was ready for the opportunity. And that got that, that validation that I kind of needed as a 14-year-old. Right. And ever since then, nobody could tell me nothing.


For sure. Who is, who are some, who are some of the artists as you continue to grow in your career, who are some of the artists, female artists or male that you would like to collab with? Man, I'm like, I wanna be like, I don't wanna just do rap. Like I have a RB project out. I don't know if y'all heard that. It's called For the Lovers. Y'all can go listen to that. It's dope. But I wanna work with like Adele, like I said, I wanna work with Rod Wave, I wanna work with Meg. It's a lot of people I wanna work with. Keani, SAA lot of different people in the industry, but people really love the craft. Like, that's who I wanna work with. Like, that's laugh. That's laugh. You've already won a national championship. So what would, what would mean more to you winning a Grammy in rap or winning A WNB?


A title? Mm Ooh that's a good one. I think. I think being, I've done that Being a being, being an Olympic gold medalist. Oh, You wanna be on, okay, 20 what? 2028. 28. 28, okay. Yeah. I think and don't, don't, don't, you know, the WNBA that was like the best players in the world to me. But I think like, you know, when I had, when I sat down on my podcast with Clea Copper, she was telling me like, that's elite. You know, playing the best players in the world and saying that you one of the best in the world. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like that's dope. But that Grammy is something that's, it's, it's special to me only because I got into music because of the man on my shirt, my dad.


So, you know, I always felt like music was our bond and you know, he was, he was murdered before I was born and I felt like, you know, his legacy got cut short and it was always like my job to continue the legacy and make sure people know his name. And so getting that Grammy would kind of just be like that, that way to just submit his legacy. I like it Off season. What is Flau jy working on? What is she doing to improve her basketball game? Yeah, for me this off season, I mean I've been working on it a lot, but like I keep getting better. Like it's crazy like, and like, you know, just, you know, the process of getting you seeing that leap you take. Yes. Like from my freshman to my sophomore year, I took a beautiful leap and you know, it was more so my confidence.


And then this year I just learned that it's more, it's like 90% mental and 10% physical. Right? And, but, but it's just been getting my cardio together, just getting my ball handling together and just being more consistent on my shooting. I think I've become a, a better, a smarter player just watching film. But for me it's like been my cardio just been working on that. 'cause last year I feel like I was kind of outta shape. Like, and I, like, I'm a freak athlete so my endurance just my, my energy carries me. But I still feel like fatigue. I don't wanna feel like that. Like, 'cause I play both sides of the ball and I want to be, you know, I wanna be de defensive player this year. Defensive player of the year to year as well this year. So I'm gonna have to be in immaculate shape to do both. Can I ask you this?


You won the national championship, you guys beat Iowa. Yeah. The next year you guys capable come back and you play them in the semifinals, right? And you face Kaitlyn Clark again. Was there a difference between her and the national championship game in which you guys won and the semi-final games in which you guys lost? No, she's the same player. I feel like a player like Kaitlyn, you can only contain her. It's not like, no, we finna make her score 10 points this game. Like that's not gonna happen. You know what I'm saying? But it's just like, I feel like our team the year before was just more equipped. Like, you know, I just deal with her. Yeah. And we had the more of a strategy. We had like a, you know, a better, like a fuller roster. We had a deeper bench. Like our bench won that championship game for us that first year.


You know what I'm saying? Wasn't even really the starter. So I think, you know, we needed more depth And, we didn't have that. But I, I feel like we, we gave it all we had. But this year, you know, we coming different, you know, I wish Clark was still here, but she's going dominating the league now. So, you know, this next year, you know, we're coming forward. For sure. If you think about what you're doing with rap, what you're doing with basketball outside of that, what do you like to do? Do you gotta have something that you enjoy that you would consider? I don't consider you rapping. I don't consider that a hobby. Yeah. That is something that you can do as a profession, right? So what, outside of that, what is your peace, your safe haven? My Little brothers, I have four of them for, yeah, I have four little brothers.


And just being a, a good big sister man, like, you know, like I know I'm a role model for a lot of kids, but like those babies in that house, they like, they look at me like I'm just like the best person in the world. Like, you know, like Queen Sheva for real. So like, just trying to be the best person, you know, that, you know. 'cause it's like, I feel like now kids are being raised on social media, you know what I'm saying? And it is true. It's like nothing you can really do about it. Kind of like all they doing is on the iPad. So just being that person that they can really look up to, you know what I'm saying? Like off the camera. Like, 'cause they really know me for real. So that's just important to me. And yeah, I just like to chill, do regular kids stuff most of the time. But I'm really deep into the community too. Like I got a lot of big stuff planned for the community. So you gave backpacks or something back in Savannah?


Back in your hometown. Oh my God. Yeah. Every year I try, I do like this six figure give back, right? And like all of my NIL partners, I'm like, I tell 'em, put in a budget. I need all of this. You know what I'm saying? I need, I need JBL, I need speakers, headphones for the kids. Puma, we gave away like a thousand shoes. Jazz sports. We gave away a thousand backpacks. Wow. That's live. Give it up. That's live. That's live. That's amazing. Yeah. And so we do that every year. This year we gave away thousands and thousands and thousands of stuff for kids. And they was sending me their pictures. It's so important for kids to go to school looking good. Like, you know what I'm saying? And having that confidence, like it means the world. And so I know that. And so just doing that for the community, just it, it, it, it just does something for me.


And also just, I just became an ambassador for the Kal Fund. Okay. And you know, I was just, they, they, they, my my my my grandma died from cancer. My cousin died from cancer and you know, I was just sitting down with them and they were just saying how cancer is three times more likely. It's some type of gene than black women that's gonna, it's three times more likely to affect black women. So I'm partnering with them and we're gonna send a a, a bus down to Savannah to give away like free mammograms for all women and things like that. So certain things in the community I just try to do. That's amazing. You Know, I'm, that's awesome. That's awesome. You see what's transpired with the WNBA? Yes. There are more eyes. The, the viewership is through the roof, the sponsorship, the advertising, the sales and you see what's going on.


How does that make you feel to see the, the, the transformation. Great players. Asia Wilson And, we got Stewy and you got Esco and you got all these and then obviously you get Caitlyn Clark and you get Angel Reese and you get Rekia Jackson and Cameron Brink who's injured. But that's what you about to go into him next year too. Yeah, No, I think it's beautiful and I think it is, it's even more beautiful how it's like trickling down like that last weekend I was coaching overtime select where it's like a bunch of high school girls, they get in this national media attention and it's capping because of what's going on in the WNBA and what we doing in college. And just giving them that experience. It's gonna be a time in a league where a girl is gonna go into a league and she's gonna have a million dollar deal.


Like that's gonna be crazy. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's awesome. Like, that's awesome. Like nobody would've thought of that. And it, it is not, probably not gonna be me, but it's gonna be that next generation. So I think it's just like about us inspiring and the other little girls that's coming. Like it's, it's beautiful to see. I'm excited to be a part of it for sure. But they're the best of the best for real. That's live. I like it. Short term goals, long term goals, Short term goals. I wanna lead my team to a national championship. Yeah, for sure. Short time girls before I graduate, I need one of my songs to at least go gold or platinum. So Yeah, when I say stream, I mean that go stream.


But no, yeah, just continue to build my music portfolio. I think it's just, you know, I gotta set the bar high, you know, I feel like I won a national championship and then I got a future with, you know, wheezy. So that was like my national championship in music. So now I just gotta keep building on that. But I definitely wanna win another national championship. It's no feeling like that. Like I did it my freshman year, right. So I didn't lead my team to a national championship. Although I did start all the games. I was freshman of the year, but I didn't lead it like, you know what I'm right. I want to, I want to actually lead my team and show that I could be that kind of player. Right. Other than yourself. What's on your playlist? Ooh, Adele.


Real bad. I love Adele. I don't know why. She's unbelievable. In concert You went to a concert? I did. I've seen her several times. You didn't have to do that. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. There's so many people. I don't know that Adele, I'm gonna just leave it that Ade. Can you leave it Ade? No. Ooh, I got a good one. Favorite female rapper right now. Who? The best female rapper right now. Who is the best female rapper right now? We know that. I really like Flau.


Millie. Okay. I like her swag. Like she got that swag. She's a pretty like chocolate girl. Like she's making waves. Yeah. Like I love that for sure. But I mean, I feel like the women putting on like gorilla's going crazy. They going Crazy. Listen, they, they all going crazy. That's Why we got mad. You got Nicky, you got sexy red, like Yep. I mean I love 'em all and it's like I love 'em 'cause they so different. Lotto. You Got lot of like, you got so many people like they going crazy. Alright, y'all here. Shields, Flau, jae Johnson.

You let me know if there's something or nothing. And it moved. That warrior has Warrior fans panicking. Steph Curry removed the Warriors from his bio on his Instagram account. His bio, which used to have the line guard from Guard for the Warriors, has now changed to Olympic gold Medalists fans immediately started naming the Lakers as potential suitors. Nah, something or nothing. I don't think it's anything. I think obviously he just won, he just won the Olympics.


He won a gold medal. So why not change your band of that? I mean, we are not in NBA season isn't here right now. Right. You know, someone like Steph is really not going anywhere. He is not leaving the Warriors. Right. So I know LeBron has been playing around on Instagram. Yeah. Tagging them. Tagging Curry with the, with the leg in Jersey on. Right. You know, isn't that illegal? No. Or players could play around like that. Nah, you can't tamper. Okay. Well, well I I don't know if that was real on Twitter or not. It, it was real, but Oh, it was real. Yeah. Yeah. So, but he gonna say he just Playing. He just playing. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, Curry until he signed with the Lakers, then I wasn't playing. Yeah. Curry ain't going that way. That's, that's nothing. That's nothing. Just, Yeah. I think LeBron, I think LeBron changed his, I think he had a, I think it was all of them sitting around.


Right? I think one, he had a, he changed it a couple of times. I think he had him, Steph and kd, I think he had the entire team sitting out there. Right. So I'm I'm with you on this one. I'm, I don't think it's a whole lot. Nothing. I, I just, I just don't even see it Doesn't even seem right. Right. I mean that would be like magic playing for someone else or bird playing for someone else. Now you think about how weird it was when you saw Jordan playing for the Wizard. Yeah, But it's, it does happen in sports. If you think about it, everyone, everyone at some point leaves. Hell, how weird was it to see Tom Brady with the Bucks? Yeah. Or how weird was it to see Peyton Manning not in the coach uniform and down in Denver? Well you see, you see that more in football. You see some of the all time grace. Right. You saw Emmett Smith play with the Cardinals. You saw Bruce Smith play with the, you saw Dion, so you seen Jerry Rice Lee.
