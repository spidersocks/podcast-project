An NFL executive described Kyle Pitts as one of the biggest disappointments I've ever scouted. He told Bob again, he also says Kyle Pitts is just going through the motions. It seems like he's almost disinterested based off the films, one of the biggest disappointments I've ever scouted. Some flashes, but rarely regularly involved in the offense. Seems to go through the motion. Almost disinterested, definitely a bust based on expectations and what they passed up broke on the scene. He was one of the, the, I think he was the second tight end in NFL history to, to go over 1000 yards receiving right in his rookie season. Mike Dicker was the first one.


Yeah, based on that. And I caught, he was great at Florida. At Florida. Guy could run, he could move like a receiver, but yeah, tremendous hands. Oh, he had, he had it all flies. Speed. Catch a great hands, catch the ball in traffic. High point the ball, great run after the game. The Injury, unc the knee injury, the A CLI think that that slowed it down a little bit. That's all. That's all, man. Listen, Kyle Pits is phenomenal and even now with a little limp and a little, a little injury, he's still a mismatched nightmare. I just think they don't know how to use him the right way where he is. You can't have someone that played listen on the line with his hand in the dirt.


He can, he can go, he can play in the slot, he can play a receiver, he can play, he can play all, he can do all these different things. And all of a sudden now he gets to Atlanta and you know, you have him playing a traditional tight end type role when there's so many other ways that you can use 'em offensively. You know, I mean, they just not using them to the best of his abilities. Now, I could be wrong, I just know that injury, that injury has affected him a lot. Now I will concede this Desmond Ritter, Tyler Heineke, hell, I don't know me, gro Kel Winslow ii.


Right? Travis Kelsey would, could put up numbers with those guys. So let's not, let's not pretend like he was with, you know, Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow, some of these other elite quarterbacks. He's not. But the one thing that you can do is that, like I said, I hadn't looked at it, but he said it did look like he's going through the mo right motion. Excuse me. It doesn't seem like he's giving max effort now. I get it. If you're probably, if you're frustrated Ocho, you're not getting, because you know, one game he gave a hundred and then hell he go Three games. He might get like Two or three cards calling the creativity and allowing team to dictate whether you can get the ball or not.


And I, I hate offenses that are run like that. It is, like I said, plus when he was with Arthur Smith, I thought that was the perfect situation. Yeah. Arthur Smith loves the tight end. And I, and I think I, I think like his, like I said, his rookie year, he was sensational. And we haven't, we haven't seen that since. I might have to get some, I might have to call and, and get some footage and some, some Tapes. I, I think take a look for myself. I think there is some truth to it. I I But going through the motions, I mean no, nobody's actually going through the motions because it's actually on film.


You not going through the motions. Maybe this exec, whoever this exec may be is finding the reason to hate, I hate the execs that don't reveal who they, who they are. Hey, Yeah, Bro, I can't, you see where he got s Shams he attached when he attached the So won Talk To him no more the agent's name to it. Stop. Bro. You can't do that. Right. Okay. That's why they tell you off the record you didn't hear from me. Right. Okay. Put it, put phrase it. Okay. Okay. Okay. However you wanna, but just make sure it doesn't come back to me.


It ain't that complicated. My sources. Yeah. Don't Worry about it. Well, these, these sources, it's 2020 and 2025. These sources need to stand 10 toes and let it be known. Forget the source it's coming from me. I'm the horse and I'm the mouth Bro. I wanna get my check right. You think, hold on. Just to appease a a a player or a fan base. You think I'm gonna give up a 10 million job just to appease y'all. You out your damn mind. You not gonna do that either. Crazy Hell no. No chance. They always come from somewhere.


It's Always, it's always come from inside the house. Huh? It's always coming from inside the house. Every time The lions revoked season tickets of a fan who had a pre-game verbal altercation with Matt LeFlore at four Fields last week. A TV camera caught the end of the heated exchange between LaFleur and Faha. Yik, you, Yousef, Yusuf Laur could be yelling at the fan, but said his actions were promote. I've never been a part of something like that. LeFlore said he was talking junk to our players, giving them the throat slash sign. You're trying to deescalate it and then gets in my face. And I thought it was pretty un sports. Like Yusef said, he was devastated by the move after being contacted by e via email. The biggest punch in the gut, man.


Just waking up and seeing that email and not being able to talk to somebody in person. It was a terrible feeling. I don't have a, I don't, I don't have a chance to give my side of the story. You, you can't do that, man. You can't do that. You, you got, you can't, you, you just can't do that. You can't listen. The NF L's not gonna go forward. The teams are not gonna go forward because you're a representation of them. So if you, if you, if you as a fan of said a team is chatting and talking trash to the opposing team's head coach, what do you think is gonna, what, what do you think is gonna happen? What do you, what, what do you think is gonna happen? You have to remain a fan. You have to remain in your position as a fan.


What I'm surprised, I'm surprised that Troy did. It's no different. It's no different than I playing in the NBA and you got fans, heckling players on the sideline. Just because you sit in court side, you better enjoy the game. There's no need disrespect the opposing, the opposing team's head coach. Now for what? I, you know what, it'd been interesting to see, to hear what was said. Now I don't ojo I don't think the the throat slashing gesture is enough. Like I said, I don't know. Right. He, he, did he say the magic? Did he say the magic word? Did he say the N word? Right? Did he, did he say, did he say some of the other stuff? Did he call somebody a monkey? Yeah. Did he, I mean, what, what were some of the words? Ocho And then, like I said, I don't know.


Now you're talking to somebody that's been in a similar situation. Everybody knows my story. It's well documented. I got into, I got in, you know, had into a, a, a verbal altercation with some of the Grizzlies players. Now, if the Lakers said, Shannon, you can't come back. I'm dead ass wrong. Right, right, right. The money that I paid for the tickets, I gotta eat that. I gotta eat that because my, my thing Ocho you know how I am, I can control Shannon's actions. Actions. I don't think he told the consequences that came from Shannon's actions. And I, and I, I, I get what he's saying. He is like, man, I ain't even get a chance to talk to nobody. I ain't get a chance to explain my side of the story.


It, it, I, I get, I was wrong. But you know, a right, maybe I'm a little bit more sympathetic and understanding because sometimes Ocho man, you look, look, I, I ain't gonna lie, hell, I forgot I was at the game And you were, you was hot. You were Hot. It, it, I ocho bro. It was like, I'm like, I'm thinking I'm on the corner. I'm at the barber shop. Yeah, yeah. And I'm going, I'm going back and forth. Oh, you like this guy? I like this guy's. Like, you know, we having a conversation about Kobe, LeBron or Kobe Jordan or Jordan. LeBron, LeBron, Kobe. That's how it was. I, I don't, I honestly, I don't remember anything until the security got me back and into the hallway and they asked, Hey, you okay?


And I'm, and I'm, and I, and I'm right, right, right. I'm like, why y'all keep asking me am I okay? What happened? Right. They like, oh, oh, you okay? And I'm looking at my, I'm looking at my man. He look, he looking at me like, I'm like, yeah, I'm okay. And then it, then it really dawned on me. But at that point in time, I was like, oh hell Lord have mercy. I said, I done lost my, I said, I know my sister gonna see this. My brother gonna see this, the kids gonna see this. I say, I know Fox's gonna see this. Yeah. Hell, everybody gonna See this. I mean, there was, there was no, there were no consequences behind that. Right? Nah, nah, me, my, there was the consequences, my image.


Right. Other than that, no, I didn't, I didn't suffer any monetary damage. But like I said, have the Lakers. If the, if the Lakers had told me yeah, that I was not allowed to come back Anymore, they wouldn't do, wouldn't Suck It up. Say that you, I mean listen, it's, it's, that happens. Emotions rides obviously. When, when it comes to players, when it comes to fans, obviously with you being a public figure and your passion for the game of basketball and the Lakers as well. They, they wouldn't, they wouldn't do that. Now, the situation with the fan and talking to a head coach like that is completely different. Completely different. Yeah. I don't, and the thing, and the thing was Ocho like the officials, because Zach, nah, I, I forget the official name.


And I had seen, I had, I had, I had seen him at a game before, but like I said, man, that's it. I was just, you know, it was just good old trash talking, Hey, you know, this and that. And then it just escalated to, you know. Yeah. I like, whoa, hold on now, hold on. Hey, I, hey, don't y'all put hands on the mo big fool you now? Yeah. Nah, nah, nah. Get Outta hand like that. But look, I, and I'm older. The problem that I'm most disappointed in, don't, Joe, my job as the adult in that situation. Right? Hey, hold on. Whoa, the temperature in the room. Whoa. Hold on now, hold on.


Sometimes, sometimes as an adult, you gotta raise the temperature because if somebody slap you on the Bible, they said, turn the other cheek. Are you gonna turn the other cheek? See, there, there we go. Go There. Ain't nobody slapping nobody. Yeah. But all the words. But in a situation like that, the words I could've just like, you know what bro, Hey, just sit down, enjoy the game, blah, blah, blah. But the thing was, When people tried to spin it, talking about, oh man, he about to fight, right? He about to crash out by LeBron. LeBron ain't had nothing to do with this. LeBron ain't had anything to do with this. Me, me and Brooks were having a very healthy conversation. We going back and forth.


I like that. I like that we going back and forth. He said what he said, I'm saying what he said. And then it got a little, it went, it went to a i I thought it went to a spot that it didn't need to go. Yeah. And then Ja came in and I'm like, oh, oh Yeah. Wait, that, that, that's his teammate, huh? Got with you. That's his teammate. So some Yes. And then his and then his dad and I, boy Lord. Now see, that's what really got me of all the things Ocho, I was focused on them. And if you notice immediately Ocho, I hear somebody say he won't do nothing, but I will man, please.

Wow. Diandre Campbell. Yeah. Told the team he's a linebacker. Ocho now he was placed, remember Drake Greenlaw? He got hurt. He got hurt was the starting linebacker. Yeah. Beside in the Silver Bowl. He just got activated. So I, I guess what that meant is that Deandre Campbell, well he didn't start, or his playing time was cut. This is what was said. Deandre Campbell told the 40, told the team he didn't want to play anymore and he left the game in the third quarter of tonight's game. Per Kyle Shanahan, TIUs Ward spoke about Campbell leaving a team middle of the game. Yeah, yeah. Do you Probably, Don, can I ask you something? Can I tell you something? Do you understand his frustration though?


Yes. Do you understand? What do you under No, I did. I don't, I don't agree with it. I don't agree with it. Listen, you as, as, as a teammate, as a player on a team, you gotta understand your role. You gotta understand why you are in the role and the position you're in. Ally got hurt because he got hurt. But then I'm thinking about it also being able to empathize with him. But damn, I've been putting all this work all this time. I've been playing all this time, and all of a sudden he comes back and I gotta take a back seat. Well, obviously you want, you wanna start from the get go, so Yeah. Hello. You got, you gotta remember that. But I think I, I'm, I'm seeing him right from his perspective. Well, damn, I'm been putting all this work, meetings, practice, playing, doing everything I can, and all of a sudden he come back from injury and now I'm on the what you got the, you lifting, you got, you got to understand your role.


Young bull. Yeah, that's, you got standing your role. Come on man, Bro. And, and that's, bro, first of all, had he not got hurt, you wouldn't even been there. Yeah. You gotta realize you got released from the Packers. Yeah. So they threw you, they threw you a lifeline. He was coming back. Okay. Right. Hey, I'm gonna, hey, I'm gonna play, play my role, whatever they need. Hey, I only signed a one year deal anyway. Right. Hey, my season about be Over the next four. Wait, well on the year deal, five Weeks. Hey. And he had the nerve to walk off, walk off the field. Yeah. Hey Unc, you got listen, you know. Yeah. Hold on for one. You got to be that boy to pull some like that off.


You ain't, I'm saying you now, you, you, you know what I mean? You got to be, you got be Fred Warner or somebody like that. Well, okay, we know you upset, you know, come on back. We'll work things out. Yes. Well if you in a one year deal, you, you acting like that. Exactly. But no, exactly. But No great player would ever do something Like that. So no great player would be in that position, would ever, something like that. But you have to understand. Correct. You, you, I think there's a situation Davis, the db, oh remember db? Yeah. And Buffalo. Hey, I heard the story. Monta had the hand like, man, I can't do this no more, man, I can't do this no more. Yeah.


Damn. Monta rest in peace, man. It's Yes, yes. But yeah, I, I've man, these guys do, I I, sir, I've never been a part of something like this in my 14 year career. I've, I can honestly say I've never seen someone that refuse It happened to go the game. Somebody else just did that not too long ago. Deontay Johnson, he refused to go to the game in, in the third quarter. Yeah. And now we have Yes. Yes. What's his Last name? Got suspended. Oh, A Did it and Tampa. Yeah. You remember AB Did and took his pants off it. Derrick Henry dropped the dreads for braids. Twitter said he was like, Omar on the wire.


Fans have said he lost. I mean All for See we gonna see if he lost Laurel. Come Sunday. We, we, we are we gonna see. I don't Yeah, I was just gonna say Samsa, we gonna, we gonna, we gonna find out. I highly doubt it because I don't think him running the ball and being, being as good as he is has anything to do with them. Dreads. It might be a good thing he might be lighter. Yeah. He ain't gotta worry about nobody tackling because you hey, because you know, guys tackle you because devil, somebody now if hanging Out Is a part of the Uniform, you got damn helmet. It's part of the uniform. You could pull it.


Yeah, it Can pull you Ation. I know that's painful for you. Running one way. If somebody pull your, Ooh Lord. Hey, hey, you jump on. Hey Ojo, you jump over on a fight. What you want to do, bro? Yeah, I grabbed your jersey. I was trying to grab your jersey, but I don't know how them guys, I mean some of that stuff Ocho they Yeah. That they hair covered his name. You know, most of the time I think that died. Fact, I Think the, the, it's a larger percentage of players with dreads that's covering their name, that play on the defensive side of the ball. Yes, it is. Yeah. Oh yeah. I like, I like it. Remember that, remember you only Picked up a phone or something?


They pulled his hair. Yo. I remember that. Yeah. Red Hood said Ocho ocho, you and Vic gotta retire from mad just because y'all am. Don't time, Time out y'all. Time out. Young bull. Listen for one. I'm the best player in Madden in the world. The problem is, is the fact that I haven't been able to play Madden the way I used to because I got 57, 11,000 goddamn jobs. So I haven't been able to be on Madden as much as I'd like to, which is why you saw me lose tonight to sketch. That's it. That's it, that's it. Well get your ass off There. That's it. I haven't had the time, I haven't had the adequate time to put the time in like I used to. I used to win the Madden bowls. I used to win the Madden bowls. That's how great I was. But the fact that the past five, six years, like I've been stacking job after job and I ain't really had time to focus on gaming the way I used to.


Okay, well stay off it because you've been stacking a after a rights, Just like you stacking your jobs, you stacked a now's what happens. And because of my job that, that, that is also it, it, it has also ruined my, my my romantic interests as well. You see, I've, I've, I I've had a singer. I prayed on stuff like this. I prayed on opportunities like this and, and just everything seems to be falling by the wayside because God has given me what I prayed for. We play a lot of two tight ends. Right. And I'm always, I'm always I'm why in 21 personnel two back one tight end two receivers. I'm always why anytime we go to 12 personnel, I'm always the tiger tight end.


So no matter who, if house came in right? And, and, and, and 12 personnel, I'm going to Tiger. If Charco Chamberlain came in, I'm going to, I'm going, I'm going to the, the tiger. I'm going to the, the fly, the fly tight end, which is what we call Tiger. So I remember looking at his side and I'm standing in the huddle and I see, I see, yes sir. Chaka Chamberlain coming into the ballgame. So I go, I'm, I'm standing in my spot. I'm stand in my spot. I'm, I'm right. I'm, I'm moving over. I'm going to the tiger position and the huddle. He's like, nah. He's like a, he like 84. You the, you the y Who told him to do that?


I'm like, huh? They they did, they sent, they sent the play that they sent the play in. So they call right two Jet y, the y stick look right. Which is the tight end. Break it in, have a two-way goal, you know. Hey, you can break it out. I mean the, the y the yeah, the, yeah. Right. The tiger. He can come across the, the guy's face or he can break it out in other words. Right. The y which is what I'm playing now. He window dressing. Hold On. This, on the, is this on the I was hot. Yeah. I I bet this I sleep. I bet this is on the back end of your carto. See, you see how they play you?


It Is, it is. No. Yeah. This is my, this is my, this is my, what year is this? This was my, this was 1999. 1999. I'll never, I'll never forget it. Ocho. And they, Right. I knew you were hot. Well, I knew You were hot. I played a game and I'm seing I told Ko who was offensive coordin at the time. 'cause he and I got a great relationship. I said, Cobe. Mm. Do they ever pinch here for Barry Bonds? Come on man. Do they ever pinch head for King Griffey Jr. I said, if y'all ever send somebody else in to do that bull job, hey listen, You, you, you already know what they're doing.


Huh? It go well, I tell, I tell you all this time, people in the chat listen to this real quick. Think about all the great receivers, think about all the great receivers, even from my era, right? It's one thing that they always do. They always say at some point, A player's losing a step or they getting slow. But you, but you never ever see the part where the opportunities decrease to make it look like there's something wrong with you. Or they work you out the offense. Right? Oh yeah. They, they always find a way to work you out the offense and put you in positions that they never used to before. It don't never really be nothing really wrong with you. Right. But they find a way to work you out. And it's always small things like what you just said. If you talk to Julio Jones, you Talk to a, the AJ Greens.


Yeah. You talk to the Andre Johnsons, the Randy Moss, even even the Jerry Rices, at some point, it always comes to a time if there's nothing wrong with you, they find ways to decrease your opportunities that make it seem as if there's something wrong with you to justify. Well, you know what, man? You're just not putting up the numbers. You're used to, you know, we think you need, you might need to take a pay cut. Yeah. And it, it's so funny how it's so funny how it works. Yeah. And so now a guy that Yeah. Ocho a guy that they thought was losing. I go to Baltimore, I lead the team and receive it. Yeah. That's The way it is. And get to a Super Bowl and then, and then come back and I finished second. Yeah. I finished second behind Rod both here and catches and Yard had eight turns down my final year.


Oh, 70. That's the yard. That's the, that's the dirty part of the business that people really don't understand or see. They don't, they never see that part. They just hear the media. Oh, he's lost his step. Oh, there's something wrong with him. Oh, he's not the same player he used to be. Well, hell, of course if I'm not getting the same opportunities I used to get when I was putting up with the goddamn numbers, of course something wrong with him. But I would've, I would've never, I would've never not gone into the game. Right. Right, right. 'cause I had built up too much credibility with my teammates and they had, they expect me to be the voice of reason. Even there've been times that I've like got on guys and I know things weren't going their way. I could see it. Hell everybody can see. But I say for me, I've always felt I needed to Right.


Remain, have a level of professionalism. Now Pro Yes sir. PRO and professional are two different things. Right. A professional is your job occupation. Right. A pro is how you handle situations. So I wanted to be a professional and a pro, right. Because I always wanted to handle things the right way. There was a time and a place I had the conversation with, cool, Hey. Right, right, bro, man, you go way. I said, cool man, you go way back, bro. You was my quarterback. Right. For two years, you helped me become the player that I became. You was the buffer that when me and Mike wasn't seeing eye to eye buttoning head. You was the guys like eight ball. Yeah. We gotta get a ball to 84.
