You know what a pump is. She don't wanna date nobody with that. And she, At her particular age, How she know he had one, because it's prep, you have to pump it to get I hear no more. He's controlling. He's possessive. He's a narcissist. You don't have time for that as of right now. Now. But getting into a relationship, the, actually Nicole, What's up y'all?


It's another episode of Humble Baddies. I'm Alexis Meyer. I'm Ashley Nicole. And I am Sharelle Rosado. And we are the, the humble, Okay. Our main topic for today is Wife Material versus Fun Girl debunking the stereotypes about how women are perceived in relationships, things a wife does versus the things girlfriends do. Okay. What y'all think about fats, ladies? Sheesh. My problem was I used to always do what a wife do before I was a wife. Mm. And that was a big issue because, I mean, I grew up in a household and I'm from the south and you know, it's Just in you.


It's just in me. Like I said, nurturing everything that my mom did with my husband. I thought, okay, you in a relationship. Y'all live together, cook, clean, clean, y'all shacking. We were shacking. So sha Yeah, I'm doing everything that a wife do, but I'm a girlfriend. Yeah. That's the issue. Yeah. And it's never too late to learn and change it up. So if you get into your next relationship, you just gonna be Who said I was getting into another relationship? So I'm not getting in a relationship. I don't wanna to get into relationship Ever. Like you're good on it. As of right now, I'm not getting into a relationship. But That's, that's what I'm saying. In the future, you might want to, That's what I'm talking about of right now. I know as of right now, but I'm a relationship in the future. Actually. Nicole Willer Alexis, I'm enjoying dating right now.


I dating is different from being in a relationship. I agree 100%. How Will you enter a relationship, being that you were married at once? Yes. At one, at one time. Do you feel like you will go into it in the same way that you did in your past relationship? Because I know that you guys were together at a young age. You had babies, y'all were traveling the world. Yes. Y'all were doing everything together. So I'm sure you were doing those wifely duties before you were actually a wife. Would you do it the same way? So, to answer your question first Okay. First, no. Okay. But right now, I feel like I am really cognitive of taking baby steps.


I, in the past of dating, because I've been dating really, I've been divorced for four years. So it's been dating differently. Okay. At beginning, I was just in that wife mode of catering to nurturing and just like, I feel like I was overdoing it. And and You don't think that you're doing it. Yeah, exactly. I, I didn't, I wasn't conscious of it. And so now it's like, now I'm more conscious of it. I'm more in a healed space, low key to where I'm acknowledging that and I'm like, you know what? You gotta earn a little bit more that's of Alexis because it's, it's very, this essence, and it is low key from dating that I learned more about my essence through talking to other men. Like just learning That.


But do you catch yourself sometimes, like doing those wife duties that you like, damn, I'm doing too much. I pull back. I do. I do. 100%. Like I feel like you gotta earn it and I'm the prize. That's how I feel. I'm, I, I always have the analogy of being like Princess Peach at the Super Mario in Luigi, the, the Mario Brothers video game. I'm the Princess Peach that's at the last round, the last stage. And you gotta come do, go through all these hoops and you know, waves to come get you. So do You expect for the man to do any husbandly type duties before he's the actual husband?


To me, husband, like duties would be like paying big bills and providing a lifestyle for me. Which A lot of women, Full provider. Exactly. Which a lot of women who are dating, and I would not put that pressure on him. Okay. At all. Because, you know, I, but I Feel like I have That this generation, they make it easy. Like the bar is low. You, especially the young athletes, they're paying the bills. They are they doing every, they doing everything tricking to the fullest. Do you call it tricking or do you call it taking care of, I Mean, I guess if you have, Or do you call it hush money? All of The above, I Think. But to me that's easy. That's the easy thing to do. It is, is to give the money. So The bar is low. So if they're giving the money though and they're doing, if, if that, if you think that that's a husband, like quality for somebody to do, do you feel like it's fair for you to hold back on those wifely duties?


But see, I feel like with this, that's a good question. This with women, we don't look at it like that. Yeah. The way men look at it, like, we're not, okay, if he's not doing this, I'm not gonna give him out. I'm not gonna do this or be like a wife. We are naturally submissive, so we're gonna do things and not even know it or not realize it. That we we're doing the things as a, what, what a wife does because, and our natural instinct is to care for and love. But I Feel and nurture. But I feel like a lot of women will feel like if a man is paying for everything that they feel like he's providing, so he's acting like a husband. So maybe I should do my wifely duties now. Oh no. It's, it's kind of hard because a man can pay for things.


I feel like, you know, like there are some men that just give money, right? They spend no time. They're gifting, they're just, they're just gifting. Like they're just, here's money, but there's no time provided. So how can I give you those type of duties when there's no time? It's just like, here's like money to go leave me alone so I can go deal with my other women. Yeah. No, I think there, I think that's a difference. Yeah. Like, I don't think that a woman would just give herself like a wife to a man who's just giving her money, Just being a truth. But I Know a lot of women, especially like If that's the motive, But like young women, when you are with a man who has it to give and to take care of you in a way, it, it does make you want to, to do those things.


Yeah. But it does, it's Enticing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And but it doesn't necessarily mean that he's like trying to be a husband and you should be doing those white things. And I think that's kind of where I had Phil had caught me or whatever, real young, but Bitch, that's why your ass still married still. Yeah. But he didn't wanna get married. What was his reason For not wanting to get married? Yeah, no. For eventually getting married. Well, what was his reason for not wanting to get married? Did he feel like he was too young? No, I think he just never had an example of it. And it just wasn't on his mind. Like, get married for what? You know what I mean? Like, it wasn't even in his realm of thought.


Like it just wasn't a thing. You know what I mean? Right. But he was doing things that in my mind were what a husband does. Like he is paying for everything. He was taking care of me. And when I, the husband when paying for everything, Phil's not the kind of like guy that's gonna go and splurge and buy me bags and dumb shit, you know? Right. He's not that guy, but he's definitely like, wrote some big checks for me. Like clear Bishop. He pays for you to get out the military. Yes, I know. That's right. So that's what I'm saying. So in my mind, you know, I felt like, oh, he's providing for me and he's let me do this, but he, he's, he's at home with me. He spends time with me 'cause we're at home, but he just like to be at home.


Like in, so in my mind I'm like, oh, he's Doing Hudson stuff. But the thing about it is, but you, you could think like that because a man, if a man don't wanna be with you and don't want to take it to that next level, they ain't gonna spend time with you. They're Not gonna do it. Yeah. They're not gonna do, they're not gonna do it. They're not gonna spend that much money on Yeah. I wasn't, I mean, I, I knew, I knew he liked me or whatever. Right. Like I knew that. But he, I was thinking, what I'm saying is all that shit he was doing in my dumb ass, young, naive mind, I was like, oh, he trying to be my husband. You know? And that wasn't the fucking case. Like, well, we, We are hopeless romantics. We are, we grew up with like, once upon a time, the, the prince comes and the princess, and then happily ever after.


Like, I, I'm falling back though because I feel like I like to be courted. Yeah. I like to be, I like to have romance and I feel like, you know, I, I give romance too, but I, I want that, I want someone to show the initiative. Like I have to do, going back to wifely things. I like to cook. I like to, that's one form of like my, my intimacy or love language. So I am ready to go like, go get groceries. Like, let's, let's stay home and let's cook a meal. Yeah. I'm like, no, you gotta earn that. Like, it takes time to get that kind of Alexis, you know, just that level of Alexis, that's, that's something I cherish. You know what I mean? Right. That I'm feeding you. And so I can't give that off the rip.


I don't want to that they have to earn that. Okay. So As an example, You just wait until you feel comfortable enough to give them that part Of your certain levels. 'cause I think that's even levels of that also intimacy. Yeah. There's levels of that too. Like how much are you giving to them? And like, like lowering the bar of, you know, being, you know, tied up or something. Like whatever the case may be. Like those, it's levels to all of that. Just like, there's levels to financial presence and things like that. It takes time. I just wanna build. And it's a, it's a balance between both parties. Like to, to receive, you have to give.


And that's both. And you'll know if that's the person, like, okay, I'm gonna take it to that next level. Yeah. I'm gonna take it to that next level. And a man though, like Phil probably knew like, okay, this is my girl he investing even know, he didn't wanna say it. He, he was investing. He's fine with you. He was investing, but he just didn't know at that moment. But I, I give my head off to y'all. Y'all don't Yeah. He invested in and you know, the returns have been you. Yeah. But I just say like, to younger women, you know what I mean? Like, we don't listen to like our parents when they're like, don't shack up. Like there's a reason for that, that that's so real. They don't want us to give all of that away. Great Point. Ash too early, you know? And, And our was as was just shacking away.


We was shacking up, we up shack up, sh up shaking Shack, sh shacking up Phil. And my dad had to have a whole conversation, like outside I was shaking. I still don't know what they said to this day, shacking. But I remember it like it was yesterday. Like, Phil came over to the house and my dad was like, let me talk to you outside, Period. And your daddy be serious too. And Whatever they, whatever Phil said was good because he must have said the right things because we was good. We, we kept on shacking. It was what it was. You know what I mean? But it's a reason why like our parents say, don't shack because you end up doing things for a man that doesn't deserve it yet. What do they, What do they say? Why buy the cow if the milk is free? Right. That's true.


That was, that was something, yeah. Yeah. But I was three and a half kids shacking up and then we finally got married. But, you know. Yeah, same. So I mean, shit, I Was married and what? Divorce? Married and then divorce. Yeah. I mean, I think we, we, we should have these conversations more about what it really feels like to just do too much for a man too early. Even if you are in love. I was madly in love with Phil. Yeah. But I was, I shouldn't have been doing what I was doing. I was Yeah, we, we definitely do. I was learning how to cook neck bones at one point, like calling my mama, mama how you cook, how you season these neck bones.


How you Oh yeah. You were showing out. Huh? I was showing out. You was showing out. I was to win him over. I mean, he did marry me, but it's like, god damn. Like I'm young. I'm 22 years old. Why the hell am doing, We were doing, we were doing a most four time Job. Active duty. Yeah. And still trying to do all this. And I don't have a ring on my damn finger. It's very, very wrong. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I, I I just think that it comes the time and the place for it. I think because of social media, we're seeing the romance, we're seeing the cars for the birthdays, we're seeing the big things, the roses. And it's just becoming very competitive. It's Very performative.


It is very performative. All of that. It's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's kind of altered it too. But just being single and dating, I feel like it's a competition because it's so many options. So everyone is doing their back flips and their cartwheels and they bringing out their best tricks. Yes. And they, they neck, you know? Yeah. I think, and I think that's, to go back to your question, Ashley, why I don't wanna get in a relationship. I have been in relationships my whole life. I haven't had a chance to see what Sherell wants. Like to learn me to know what, like to actually go out and date and date. It's okay to date. I think people have have the problem of dating as, oh, you gotta sleep. You don't have to sleep.


Learn who you are, learn what you like, change the type of men that you attract. Yes. Because we have a problem where we are attracting the wrong type of things. I agree. Right. So I need to learn what I really like and who I am. So that's, I love, love that for you. Answer. I don't see myself getting into a, a relationship right now. Like, I wanna, I want to learn me. I'm in a different era now. I congratulate you on that because you have to take time. You have to take time for yourself. We give so much. We have children, we have other people that depend on us for so much. You, we have to get back to ourselves. And I had that time. I had that Time. And the problem with me is no matter how much I say, you know, I'll change and you know, I don't wanna give the wife duties.


I'm gonna instantly fall because I'm a mother. Mother. I'm a nurturer. That's right. So I'm gonna instantly fall into, into that role of giving those wifely duties no matter how and attractive matter. It's, it's, but it's, it's just In your nature And Just who you are. Yeah. Yeah. Natural. So I just, I think it's smart of you to really take that time, find out what you want, who you want, because then it will be easy for you to let that guard down. Exactly. And to be who you really are and not have to hold back everything that you are that makes you so great. And whoever you end up with is gonna be able to appreciate it even more. That's true.


But date, the all SISs, date them all. It's gonna put that out there. Date them all. Okay. Yes. I'm living through y'all. Okay. It's so call me at the, like I'm gonna be texting y'all when y'all at the dates, you know, if It's a sexy like girl this is, but It's, the good thing is you can go home. I like it. 'cause I can go home to my bed. I can go home to my kids. Like I can go home. Yes. If I don't wanna deal with something, I'm like, I'm outta here. And guess I don't have to. No, You sleep peacefully at night. Yes. Snoring, slobbing out the mouth that All Of that. All of that. Yes. I love that Y'all. This is how me and Ashley is. Don't take it. Don't take it seriously.

But like, low key, his parents are still together. They met at like 1920 and then obviously her dad and I met at 19. But the thing about it is I'm like, do you think people get curious?


Like, damn, what if I was able to date a little bit more before I got into the serious Relationship Thinkable and not curious. Yeah. You, I think you just have to spice it up. A lot of people who've been in relationships a long time, if you are not sp like that's why I respect y'all relationship because it's not, y'all just don't check the box in y'all relationship.

Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's real.

And we ain't even gonna speak like that because there ain't nothing happening. It's okay. Yeah. No facts. Alright ladies, I have something new for the Humble Baddies. Ooh, what you got for what? Us It's called real red flags. Ooh, Red Flag. Real red flags. Oh Lord.


So tell us more. The thing about real red flags is I'm gonna give you guys scenarios, okay. And you tell me if it's a red flag, green flag, or you just haul ass. Okay. Oh, I mean, and I ain't even forget the flag. Forget the flag. I'm hauling ass. Okay. All right. Y'all ready? Yes. The first one is, he still text his ex happy birthday every year. Red flag call ass haul. Ass call ass call the fuck ass. Didn't even let, Let she finish it. He can't text his ex happy birthday. Why the Fuck is he texting his ex? Why did he still have her phone number? Why do you still know her birthday? Exactly. Why are you looking about That bitch it that bad?


Was it that bad? I Don't give a fuck if it was good as fuck. I don't care. Exactly. She an ex for a reason. Yeah, you ex for a reason. You'll be okay With your man texting his ex Happy Birthday. I'm not, I'm I'm not mad at it. I don't believe that Lex, I'm not mad at it. I don't need a text from my Expo. So your man is texting his ex every year specifically her Birthday. But what I know if I, if I know it was for what though. I mean, But you know that he, Why does it have to be so like cut off ties? Why does it have to be so it's not Cut off? I don't give a fuck. Y'all could Left that doesn't Left on good terms. But because she may think that there's some something still there, I think I'm just would be confident in it. What's the purpose though?


It Ain't about Cnce for what? It's about respect. I saying I don't, it, it doesn't bother me. So every year he makes sure he send her happy Birthday, for example. And he forget, he forget one year. See your as happy birthday. I would, I would hope, I would hope that, like my ex ex for example, I would hope that his lady would be like, make sure you show her some love. She, but I'm just saying When your birthday, Because I'm, When is your birthday? Lexi? February. I mean, you have kids, So kids coming up. I guess I get That. That's what I, that's what I, That's what I'm Thinking. But I think It's a way to go about it. Like if I had children with somebody and I wasn't with them anymore, I would just like give them, I would tell my son something hard. Yeah. Here to my, my kids.


Make sure you go. Yeah, I wouldn't do it personally. I would do it through them. Yeah. Because that's how we're connected. I get it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's just my opinion. But You know, I I I just don't believe you. I'm still home. I you just saying, saying you would do it just because you just saying it. I'm Not saying it just because it's just, I don't think y y'all know me. I'm not holding grudges and all that kind of shit. Like, It's just a text. You was just talking about the other day last time. Oh, he did not introduce me to his new girl. Yes, he Did not. I, I hold a, I should be held at a higher regard. 100%. Just like, like, just like, even if it's not me being texted happy birthday, it should be my kids sending a gift.


You know? He should be initiating that. I 100% think that. But your kids old enough to send their own gift to they mom. They are, But they can get a bigger budget from their father Blo. But I don't know. I'm just that A lot. I'm just saying, you know what I mean? I know. I encourage them. Like I encourage them to like do that. You Know? I don't know. I can't, I, that's just me. I don't Let's, I love you justice, but I don't agree with you on this one because I wish they would send they, you better. Let me find out. That's just me. Yeah. It's a long, I don't, I don't, I mean, what do you Your happy birthday text? Barely. Barely me. And it's like, This is not a happy birthday text. It's not sending, it's not sending But me and barely even remember dates.


Exactly. That's no, it ain't exactly the fact that they're going out their way to send their ex a happy birthday. That's a pro, that's a red flag for me. I'm just saying. Well, What if your birthday is tattooed on them? That's their problem. That's Constant reminder. You know what I'm saying? So What his birthday, what you trying to say? I'm just saying You won't forget Period. You know, I was just in the, you know what I mean? Just was in his life forever. So it's like, you know, February 27th. As long as he's saying you a happy birthday. That's my grandma's birthday. Y'all some little freaks too. We Are Your grandma was a freak. I I'm just saying my grandma. That's what you're saying. That's why my grandma married to my granddaddy for years. Okay.


Say that. Yes. Years. She had four girls. They still in the saint. God bless my grand, but my grandma, you know, don't bother me. Ola. May Allen laid it down. Okay. I believe Love. Okay, Allen. God bless. The dad was happy. A happy pastor. A happy pastor. Okay. You okay with it, Ash? I say it's I'm hollering ass Red flag. Oh, I'm hollering ass. I don't like that. Okay. He follows every Instagram model Still. This said, Y'all gonna be surprised. What? Because a lot of the older you Get the grandmamas Was great. Yes.


Yeah. They be busting it. They listen. Don't be surprised. They ask. Well, we Have to keep it going, don't we? Yeah. It don't stop it. Don't, it gets, I'm telling y'all, Guess what it gets what it I done heard, overheard Your grandmama was Doing it. Not my grandma, your mama, but my best friend. Her grandma had condoms in her drawer. And not only condoms. She had a dildo. Oh yes, she should. And she was 80 years old. Grandma said she popped 80. But you, you hear what's going on in those senior communities. They have all the STDs. Yeah, they do. They do. All of Them. They do. I do. I mean, what do you look Up?


Look up in the villages. Retire older. All they have retire. They have? Yes. What do you I mean, it's The truth. It's not funny, but it's the truth. I don't wanna Talk about this anymore. I'm just saying They be busting it wide open. Yeah. Oh my God. Okay. That's, I'm just, I hope I am too. They be having pumps and all. Oh My God. You know what a pump is. She don't wanna date nobody With that. And she, in her particular age, how She know you had one. Because it's prep. You have to pump it To get it. Wait, wait, wait. Oh God. I don't hear No more. Stop.


Please, Please. I'm just saying, how did we Get off on This tangent? When you asked when You get, you know, you Said your grandma Was freak. No, I did not. You asked that question. I just said, oh, that's my grandma's birthday. Pisces are, and then you And I. Oh, I am. Ashley started this conversation. Oh God. Okay. The second one. What? He follows every Instagram model. But you're nowhere on his page. Red Flag. Red flag at all. Red flag flag on the play. Red flag. Horrible red flag. I don't that haul ass get on that of there. That's horrible. Yeah. I mean, Horrible.


I wouldn't say I would haul ass, but it's definitely a red flag. I mean, it's, it's a red. So You would just tell him to switch it up or, or post more. Or I would find a way to say it real cute without telling him what to do. And if he don't catch a hint, then I'm hollering ass. No, you just gotta be like, baby, what's the point of following all these Instagram? Mom, I'm not gonna do that. 'cause I just, I want you to do what you want to do. I'm gonna let you know, like, ew, I don't really find that attractive. You know what I mean? And then I'm gonna see if you can catch a hint and then switch it up. But if you don't switch it up on your own, then like, I don't like telling men what to do. Like, right. You need, you should know. He should know. You should know. Yeah. I'm gonna give you a hint on how I feel about what I, what we talking about.


You know what I mean? But It's like, what if it's like, like in social media right now, now it's like, you know, you've heard of soft launch or like the hard launch, right? Yes. Yes. So like if you, we know people that have just like hard launch, like their booze. If he was following all these ladies and then, you know, now all of a sudden, you know, he's posted his lady, then it should, it should change 100%. But if not girl, that don't mean shit. Keeping it private. That's, Yeah, I don't really, that's not cool. I don't like That. I I mean, as long as you could follow who the fuck you wanna follow, of course. But if we're like in a for real relationship and you are choosing purposely not to tell me To post me, then that's problem. That's The whole ass. It's because anybody can see who you follow.


Why the fuck you follow them? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I feel you. Okay. This one is from a female perspective. She refuses to split the bills because she thinks relationship should be traditional. Where the man should pay all the bills. Orange, black. Mm. Almost. Right? That's tough because of the situa. Like, I'm traditional. I feel like a man should provide majority of the big bills. Will I be paying a couple if something pops off? Absolutely. But I feel like it's your dynamic at the beginning. Like if you're traditional and you wanna stand on that and stand on it. So to me it would be a red flag.


Yeah. I would say orange. It's not a red. 'cause financials are tricky. You know, it is tricky. Money changes, situation changes. So, you know, I feel like you never know, one day you might be down bad and you should be able to be there and pick your man up if need be. So just being like, I'm out. If he can't pay the bills, is that's real? That's kind of fucked up. Yeah. It depends on it's, it depends on the situation. Because I've been in my relationships, we like, of course the man took care of the majority, majority of the bills. Like the the big bills. Big bills. And I took care of the little bills. But if she don't wanna split nothing.


Nothing. Not even the little groceries in the house. Yeah. Yeah. That's a red flag for me. That's a red flag. Because what if you know, I'm that man and I'm with you and I can't depend on you. And now you wanna leave me when I'm down and out. Right. Because I can't hold the ground for like hold, hold the fork down for like a month or two. Yeah. That's why the men's is mad right now. 'cause they feel like the women is just out here. Taken, Taken, taking, taken, taken. That's true. Okay. Red. Red Flag. Red flag. Flags. Flags. You all let me know what you guys think.

First off, thank you for creating such an amazing podcast. You are welcome. It feels like the only place I turn to for advice right now. Here's what's been weighing on me. I've been seeing this guy for about eight months and at first everything seemed great, but lately he's become really possessive. Mm. He doesn't let me wear certain clothes, like anything tight or that shows off my body sound like Aquarius. And he asked me for my social media passwords multiple times to check. If I'm talking to guys, Call ass, call a, but Wait, that's not the game right now. Oh, go ahead.


Focus. It's starting to feel overwhelming, but I can't tell if this is just normal relationship stuff or it's, or if I'm overthinking Girl, what the man. You can't what? Hold On, hold on, hold on. I don't know how to handle this and I could really use your advice. Is this something I should be worried about or am I reading into it too much? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Thank you. What's her name? Cindy. Amy. Amy. Amy from Dallas. Amy Hall asks, hall asks, there's nothing to think about. There's nothing to consider. You just need to haul ass. He's given all the red flags. He's controlling, he's possessive. He's a narcissist. You don't have time for that. Damn. You have to let that go before it gets worse.


Because if he's starting off now like that, it's gonna get even worse. Haul ass. That's And don't look back. Burn rubber. Damn. What do you think, Ash? Yeah, I mean, she said it all. She really, you know, diagnosed the fuck outta him. Honestly. She Did. She let him have it. Did she? She did. But you know, I think her already having that feeling in her gut, that intuition, like you already know. You just looking for somebody to tell you what you already know. Like you already know. If it already feels off, it's off. It's not right for you. If it doesn't feel comfortable, girl run just it.


There's no point. Ask social media early Eight months in what? I just think he's got something going on. So that's becoming like, let me, let me see what she got going on. Just because I'm doing the most, It's controlling 100% And you know behind. Yeah. That's a lot of heavy energy. When you have controlling, there's more things behind you. It's a domino effect. Exactly. If you control, you do this. If you do this, you got a quick temper. If you got a quick temper, yes. And then If you get into that one thing, then it's gonna be something else next week that he's gonna want and control you. And She can't even be herself. So Amy, I Amy ass Amy. It's a no haul ass. Get the fuck on. Yeah. Yeah. Not, not good. Yeah.


Yes. Find another Dallas man. Yes. There's plenty of them out there. It is. It Is. Yeah. Girl, hope this helps. Yes. Hope we answered your question. Thank you for submitting. Thank you so much. Ashley, feel bad for you. You hear how she talking? Yeah, it's Not, it's not. Sorry. He says it's not looking good for you. It aint, it ain't. Let them go. Real red flag. That's it. We gonna pin it.
