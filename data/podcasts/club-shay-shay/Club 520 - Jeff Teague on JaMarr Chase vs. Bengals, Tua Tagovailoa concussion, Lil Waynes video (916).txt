Tell me who, who It shows as everybody get their body done. He should shout out to your doctor. Whoever sharpening you up. Who, what It look like. Do the legs match It? It does. It ain't bad. It just, I don't look like, I don't look at them like that so I really can't tell you bro.


I'm gonna keep it real Big. Small. Was they big and got small or they were small? They got big Yes to both answers. Yeah we DJ get in your phone bro. Go through your notes before this nigga gets in bro you Woody bro. Pause not me bro. No toy story. Pause. That's crazy. Hey but speaking of clauses Jamar Chase put that insurance clause out for his season. I think it's like 50 s for this year 'cause he basically said yeah fuck the Bengals like y'all playing with this contract. I ain't rocking with y'all. I wanted to ask you is that something that y'all even think about doing or you know players are doing in the NBA 'cause?


'cause I know NFL makes more sense because I know their contracts again be super flawed the way it should be happening. Y'all money be guaranteed differently but like anybody, like if you was in the contract years, is that something you would consider doing? Like if you're like damn I don't know how it's gonna play out but I might take some insurance out. I've heard people doing it but most people like franchise players, players with that caliber. They they do extensions. They don't even try to get to the market. They know what they worth. I really didn't try to get to the market too often. I did twice but if I had it, if I can go my way I would've took extensions. So I don't even wanna play like and that's why I think it's weird 'cause you know NBA shit, if you do decent and you got aspirations they gonna pay you.


Yeah NFL you could have the cold season ever and they still be penny pinch. They be like eh. But it ain't even his year to get paid though. Yeah he tried to do a year earlier. He say Yeah but I need to be the highest paid receiver in the league. Respect he not better than Justin Jefferson but yeah I was just about to say that. Hope he's not But he's right there. If he's not, I mean he's not one but he might be two or three or four depending upon how you feel about it. Nah, He up here in the top five for sure. I'll take Tyreek Hill over him. Justin Jefferson over him. That's two. Yeah that's what I said. I'm not taking CD lamb over him though. I like CD Lamb though. I think CD's top. I think CD rounds out that five. You gotta put Tay Adams still there too.


Sure about the Adams is still for sure generational talent but outside of that I don't think ain't too many other people I would take over Jamar Chase. Nah he top five. Yeah so Just pay that man. Yeah that's F NFL is just too hard bro. It's too hard. Just pay these niggas bro. But we was talking about like the contract shit, Deshaun, Washington, some shit came up that basically they said that they had kind of removed a clause or something happened to his contract where basically something could alter all that guaranteed money that they signed for him. And then that's why we kind see the new quote unquote allegations up against him now. And I'm like that's kind of convenient that they do that shit. Like we've seen this happen in the NFL before. Regardless of how people feel about the morality stuff for it. We see a lot of franchises pull shit on the back door that be getting 'em out of paying players and that shit's crazy.


If I sign the biggest contract FL hit you at that time, ain't no clauses gonna be out this I need all that shit. It's up now. You shouldn't signed me check, That's all. Yeah you, you took that risk so we both took a risk. Fuck it. Yeah give will some bro. I told you I was gonna leave the hose alone. You told me. Okay I'm gonna pay you. I lied. We you don't try to remix my contract now. It is what it Is. Yeah bro. This is who I am though. Just stop hating. It is already done. You can't get my bread back now. And he signed up with a fire year deal. Yes sir. Damn. Now this is, you got three years left on that huh? Yeah this is, yeah they over there pissed Mark keep going up.


They still mad. Don't matter. It's too late. Yeah lock in. They figured out bro. They got it. Just pay and be done bro. Y'all made a mistake just don't do it Again But you know the NFL don't play them games bro. I told you about NFL you lose, you go to a three game loose trick NL niggas will think you are trash no matter what you did bro. They try to get you up outta here if you ain't one of 'em top five Lakers bro. They will get you the fuck up outta here bro. Motherfuckers low key off Joe Burrow a little bit. That be Nah it it ain't low key. They talking they like Joe Burrow ain't took motherfuckers to the chip. Nah that type of shit Bengals been terrible forever. That's why I fuck with the NBA more than NFL bro. Get wicked in the NFL You can have a bad season in the NBA and niggas still respect you. You have a bad season in the L that niggas look at you like damn bro.


Like what's up? Fuck. But it's still early in the NFL, you know what I mean? Nah it's only week two. Yeah. Oh. Get what's on Cowboys the Saints beat the living shit out of us today. I didn't think it was gonna be an easy game but I also didn't expect to get smacked like that. Colt's get well soon too. What the fuck happened to them? Charlotte is fucking terrible. I'm tell I listen, I was on the bandwagon. I didn't ho the fuck off. Damn Charlotte. They, they had people in the stands. People don't even go to the game in Charlotte bro. The Panthers are awful bro. They nobody even go to the game bro. You can get a ticket for $10. Damn bro.


What they did to Bryce, Sean's career is not right bro. This is only his second year bro. And it's looking like my boy about to be on. He gonna have to be a coach soon bro because he is running for his life every single game bro. They have nothing that they put around him to help do anything. They got, they can't even get rid, the owner can't even sell the team. Well he probably could but they can't get, get rid of that nigga to make changes bro. They ain't a, that's probably one of the worst f houses in sports right now. Well they are terrible, horrible. Well nobody really cares though. What, what was the score that game you said? Nobody really cares. Nobody really cares about the Panthers bro. I mean they did with cameras there but 20 what, 26 score they yeah they fucking suck. Yeah they care. Well they been trash though. Like people like the coach.


It's like damn we had expectations for y'all. Like what the fuck is going on? What we need to do to get better. Niggas ain't really pressed on the Panthers bro. No they're they're booty butt juices but it's crazy because we lost the Panther. I mean other man the Packers is playing without Jordan Love and they beat the coats and that's what a lot of people like. All right. Yeah And the genius. I was kinda shocked. I ain't gonna lie. I thought the coaches was gonna win today. I ain't gonna lie. They have, I think this is gonna be the year that you see some organs like I know they got, you know what I'm saying Shane stocking in there. But I think niggas won Chris Ballard's head bro because they didn't address this secondary all summer and somebody got hurt and they're like so we already had a thin secondary and now we have no secondary.


Fuck it. I'm ready. Oh you, you ready now? Yeah, Ziaire done got you turned up Line line me up. I get cooked. Yeah Bro. That'll be all for bro.

I don't see Dion being in Colorado longer than two, four years. Can't get the year. He can't get no recruits Bro. All these niggas that's 25 bro. Colorado's a new 25 and under team bro.


Another 24. You see how weak they are. Niggas are old as still losing. He old and trash. Not trash bro. They just won bro. They protected trash. They protected Shado. Shado had four touchdowns I believe over 300 yards. They Just played. Travis Hunter had a interception. He had two tds a hundred yards on a few catches. They had a good game bro. Oh Travis Hunter is going to be a top five pick. We not, we never said Travis Hunter Wasn't. You keep knocking who they play bro. Like Well I've watched them play Nebraska. They Playing Who's on the schedule bro? They had the same schedule every year. They never changes. I watched, I watched them play Nebraska with had some changes bro. Some good football players. They ain't even have all American. They just had good football players.


Respect bro. And that shit got spooky. No You a highlight nigga bro. It's cool. I ain't a highlight nigga. I just watch, I watch both games. All right. And I drank my Hennessy and lied Two on, two on one. Man, Good win. I'm happy quarter. I think Travis Turner is a special player. He cool. Ro gonna be a, he gonna be one of the top quarterbacks taking the next draft too. Yeah, I think he's good too. I love the fact that that he had his offensive lineup there. I said I wasn't a leader when I was talking shit about it. Nah, I got him up with when we win now What? That was funny as fuck. Yeah And I fucked the fact he ain't shake O boy hand. No I fuck with that too but he like when y'all lose bro, throw it on your shoulders bro. Y'all, y'all lost put it on your back bro.


We lost bro. Don't Sportsmanship overrated. We lost because them niggas are Shoot Don't throw you but don't throw your team under the bus. Don't ever do that. Just like shit, we just gotta get better you feel me? I'll take that one on the chin. It's cool. Yeah He gotta do that. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I don't know if he could lead near But you can't do that in the nfl not get Yours. Dunno man yet. Nah, under, that's the biggest adjustment. If you a quarterback or a point guard going into a professional locker room, you gotta lead men. Mm. So that little shit he would've did like it is my jersey dirty whatever nigga well damn near punched him. Yep because you playing with my livelihood now. Exactly. And making me look bad like a hundred percent. Right. And that's when you said that damn Gino Smith was like that. Remember early on Gino Smith got got punched out and nobody fucked with him and it took him years to get back and now he going crazy again in in Seattle.


But like you said leader of man, they was not fucking with him at that point man. Yeah and you got a big name so when you go into the NFL, you got all this media behind you, all these endorsements and shit like that. So the buzz is on you. So if you god damn going that motherfucker and you play for the lion and be like shit is my jersey dirty da da da. They on your ass bro. You lost your team. Yeah You this nigga's livelihoods nigga. Yeah. So that's the only thing I don't, That's why like in college a nigga like that, I ain't gonna lie on our team at Way Forest that Wouldn't work bro. Motherfucker would've punched him on our team like nigga you playing with my league nigga I coulda made to the league nigga you I heard. And even though the film show you that you probably ain't gonna make to the league but still like nah you voicing it.


You voicing it. Like I probably When you don't have to. Yeah, yeah when you coulda just said we had a bad day. Yeah, Yeah I guess they going elsewhere that just because you can, it is funny but it is out of pocket. Yeah I was cracking up. James was on the OGs podcast and he was talking about y'all relationship. He was like, man when I first met him he started telling me about Indy. He's like, yeah man Indy ain't no hoe. I was cracking up. He said Indy ain, Indy ain't soft. He said it ain't sweet and Indy nah it's wild and the motherfucker out here man. But he said he could, he know what I'm saying? He said he fly, he can take John Jones hands up. Listen I ain't going, I, I don't know that's a motherfucker. John Jones is crazy. That's yeah that's a beast bro. But I don't doubt either one of them. I don't, James is like 265 pounds.


I don't know how much John Jones weigh. I don't 265 pounds And the way that motherfucker can move that's going. It's just a tough battle for anybody. But shit, I don't got nothing to say. I don't know. He Trained to kill too though. Yeah so, but that's a John Jones motherfucker who he do this every day. One The best ball time. Yeah. One of the greatest. So James, I don't you know, do your thing player. If there's anybody who I feel like could, could put their best force of effort, it'd be something definitely James. And the only reason I say that is 'cause that's what he really did. Like he trained his whole life to be a fighter. Right. He like, he even said on the podcast like I ain't trained a hoop. Like I wasn't no hooper, I was a fighter.


Like I just found, I just fell into this hoop shit. That's crazy. Like my whole thing was fighting like if Hoop didn't work I was gonna go fight. Like so I Don't know the fact that he's still passionate about that shit is crazy. And he, like I said, he's already, he's damn near professional bro. You been doing something that long. Like y'all niggas trying to have open gym bro. He's trying to get on the mat bro. Like Yeah I, I, you Know what I'm saying, he leaving gang or not leaving gangs but leaving school to try to go make some cheese to box bro. Shit's already in him like for real. So I don't know. It's just tough fighting a nigga like that though. At the same size though. John, John Jones is 6 4 2 48.


James is Six seven. John Jones is two 40. Yeah that's, that's tough. Damn James six, seven what? Two 40? He like two 60 but damn that's tough. Damn. Hey and listen shit, he too that's a whew. I don't know he White bro.

Hell No for sure. Also I heard my heart to see Lil Wayne really put that video out being upset. Saying, talking about I told you I nigga it was gonna gonna be mad Bro. I mean it is what it is now. We didn't need that. Yeah you could've been disappointed at home bro. We didn't need that Any other time. Niggas won't wait to speak. We speak on the real. Listen we have not niggas tell to Shut the fuck up. We have not asked Wayne to talk in a very long time. Just remember yo Raps when you show to the shows. This is all we've asked in the last five years. We have not asked for a speech from Lil. Wayne. I don't think I really wanna see Lil Wayne at the Super Bowl. I'm at it bro. I I wouldn't, of course I wouldn't have been mad at it but because I just know he not gonna play the shit we like, he gonna play the shit that the masses know so it's gonna be lollipop and fucking rock and roll shit.


He ain't about to play Bill Gates and shit like that. Yeah he not gonna play the the shit we want to hear the mob and also like that. Somebody brought up a valid point. I forgot who but credit to you bro. The Superbowl performance is a performance like them niggas be changing costumes, dancing, running for 20 minutes straight. Wayne is not about to do that shit bro. Hell no. He about to go up there and I mean know in there, I'm a young man, I've never been so bad Wayne concert. I'm sorry. I agree. Never, Never. I'm not saying he gonna have, I mean but you gotta think that's a different audience. A great concert to us is him going up there and spitting his hard shit with Drake. That shit I, well Lil Wayne, when he used to come out to clips bro, the nigga used to have a real stage bro.


It just wasn't him and the DJ For sure. Like, come on y'all now Y'all but he gotta have dance. But the Super Bowl. Yeah, the Super Bowl covers the entire field. They be having all that extra shit. I just don't see how that resonate with one. I hope, I hope It he got one of the best bands ever, bro. Like y'all niggas just wilding. I'm not saying he couldn't do it, I'm just saying like the shit I wanna hear, I, I think that he's being sad about it. I feel it. But you kind of doing too much. 'cause the Super Bowl is a Super Bowl. It's never really about like us like that. Yeah, but That's what I'm saying. Shit, we want to hear ain't gonna really, he can't play that shit. Well I Think he had Dr. Dre fucking doing the Super Bowl bro. But every song Dr. Dre play, we all know and he brought out all his artists too.


50 cent, the club, all that shit. Eminem, we, everybody, the masses know that shit like Lil Wayne, his biggest songs is like a milli lollipop. Then they start getting quiet. That's crazy bro. Y'all got, we talk about some y'all getting, y'all get, I'm just saying For the masses, Lil Wayne has a white fan base. When you go to these car Nigga Lil Wayne used to have festivals and shit bro. Yeah, But we talking, Talking About, talking about the people that watch the Super Bowl, people that go to the Super Bowl and people that watch it are older white Men. The people 20 years ago, nigga we're 37. Them people were 57. Them people, them white motherfuckers was listening to Lil Wayne in college nigga.


Nah. Before that and before that. Yeah bro. Nah, Wayne was like Wayne Don't have a black audience nigga he got a fucking white audience bro. When you go to a Wayne Showbox field with white people clips, white People go to concert. Clipse hold 20,000 nigga, majority of them people that was in Clips nigga was all white people bro. Lil Wayne is not no Lil. Wayne is not No fucking Peewee Long way. No fucking G. Not no Lil Dirk like We not, we know Lil Wayne is an icon. He wouldn't be considerate for the Super Bowl. But what we saying is his biggest songs like Wayne's biggest shit is Mix Tapes In the black community bro. Nigga all over.


Ah bro. That's the shit that we like bro. And what's funny is this exact conversation has been like the ongoing like vice versa stuff. Everybody is like, I respect Wayne enough 'cause he is a legend and he has the discography. But as like putting a set list for this particular event, yeah. Would be harder than normal for myself. I just don't f my only pushback with Wayne is all these other black people that have performed it wasn't never who's, what's the biggest artist from this city. Yeah. That's my only pushback. So I don't know why it's getting blown out of proportion. But it wouldn't hurt to have Lil Wayne though. Nah, if, if that's all I'm saying. If they announced Lil Wayne we would be excited for sure. Yeah. But Like the fact that Kendrick got it and everybody was like it should be Wayne. It's just like, all right now if I'm Kendrick, hey fuck y'all, this is my moment.


I respect to Wayne. I'll try to out. He the Hottest in the game right now though. But This my moment. I think like Wayne will have to come On. Kenrick bigger than Drake right now. I think Wayne would have to come on as a feature like bring Wayne out Ken. Like I don't think like, like Drake got more big bigger songs than like Wayne like that. The masses. No, like I obviously he got all those number one hits so you can play all his shit. Niggas will know it. Like Wayne, what's his number one hits? What's Wayne's number one hits? Wayne's biggest Hits gonna probably be a Millie Milly music. Lollipop Huston Music is a big charting song number two. Damn. Shout to, I mean I that's a classic in my book. I mean that's classic for that classic Me too. But I'm just saying I don't know if that's gonna resonate with Wayne got songs with a feature.


So like anybody Wayne could do a feature set to do the Super Bowl for the Super Bowl performance is only 15 minutes. Yeah, But I'm just saying like that nigga. But bro after Stone like my daddy Fireman bro y'all niggas just get, y'all get crazy Go DJ and he has one of the best bands in the fucking land. Y'all like Go DJ's not going, that's not, it's gonna, it's gonna hit for us but like I don't wanna hear the Super Bowl like be mad like after Usher. Come on bro. Nah, that's a Hard time. I love that Kendrick is doing the, what's the name, I'm not mad at it 'cause it's not about who, like I said, it's not about the biggest artist from that city. Bless you. But it, it is nothing wrong with Lil Wayne. That's all I'm saying. It's nothing wrong With him. It ain't, but I'm just thinking, I thinking About Super Bowl Bro.


It ain't, I'm just thinking about performances like yeah I just don't like the niggas with disrespecting Wayne. Like what about his, he don't have Make no Wayne's a legend. We not ever gonna go back about that legend. Nah definitely. But I'm just saying like Kendrick, all his songs are Motherfuckers Like we don't like a lot Black people don't listen to Kendrick. It's gonna be a disappointment if Kendrick don't do they not like us at the Super Bowl. You think he ain't, you think he's not getting on safe? Start what I'm saying though. Like nigga he's going, that's going to be the kaboom of the Explosive, You know what I'm saying? Like that's the, we're not gonna sit up here and act like Kendrick was always the number one nigga. Super super bro.


They gonna play that shit to the fucking, he cannot do that song at super bro. I wish he could super Oh they they not let him get they BET awards? Yeah he did it there. He is not doing that shit at the Super Bowl you want Bet he on play that shit. Wait all right. Yeah. Oh he's not doing all at Super. You want A bet? I bet 50 50. 50 50. He Playing that shit. Can I get that Please? I be, You gonna be Crazy nigga. What he gonna, he might come out to that And. we popo You think they about to let that nigga perform   at the biggest white stage if he knew he's the goat. That's the biggest song nigga. I'm telling you that's Yeah DJ Wild. I love to lose a hundred dollars. I love to be wrong about the situation but you see how they would DJ wild bro. They research the like they said don't, he gonna blank out whatever part he say Poppo, he ain't gonna say that part.


No, I I would say of all the people that would make it happen, I could see Colin Kaepernick coming out with, with Kendrick. Woo. He's trying to go to hell. They better not bring him out. I'm saying keep his ass away. I'm Saying I can see that happening. They not gonna, I don't wanna see Colin Kaepernick ever again. I can see that respect. I do but they not gonna let him Come. Yeah I do man. Why? Why? Why y'all wanna see Colin Kaepernick? I want to, I want to see him sit down and tell his real like I wanna see what type of person he is. He can't, Why He can't talk? He signs something that says he can't talk about that. So what he could actually give us as far as usefulness behind that is kind of obsolete now. So every time we see him he just, he took the money. Right? He definitely took the money.


Yeah. So every time I see him randomly pop up nigga we don't care no more. So What? That's crazy how some shit can go away by a dollar Bro. I would've signed that bitch too.

Travis Scott did not go harm nobody bro. He just had a concert. He Didn't go harm nobody but him not trying to stop the performance and you know that's kind of what blew it up.

TikTok Even got TikTok nigga.


But I'm saying you like one of them old heads to hear that song and you be like oh The only reason I heard the video yacht shit is because my nephew sent it right a minute ago though. That's what I'm saying. You're not really tapped in bro. But I know other like somebody Asked to say Hey Jeff, listen to this and you like oh, oh that one's cool. That's wild. What's my young nigga from Gary? Wow. You know bro see you ain't tapped in. I know Street nigga. Shit, he a young rapper from Gary. He actually kind of hard now. I forgot his name though. Wild. What's his name you so tapped in. He got a crazy name but he he he be rapping about some wild shit but he won Shout To the 2 1 9 NBA young boy type of, I kill everybody in this point.


I gotta ask my nigga Darrel, what was old boy from GA? He had me listed somebody from the G. That was cool Young nigga. But yeah matter of fact I ain't gonna promote him 'cause I don't promote violence so nevermind respect. He speaking of violence Now. He's an activist. Always been Put the guns down on ass. Always been that bro got we gotta help these youth man. Speaking of V Canelo got the dub shit shot a Canelo man they fucking fight somebody please Shit. Hey dude wasn't no ho though. Nah he Wasn't but damn But he, we gonna duck benavidez for the rest of our career. Fuck You can't have no fight party off that fight. Nah, hell no. I ain't no fight party.


That's a lot of people been saying shit we had a fight party, it's gonna be UFC. We gonna see some action. Niggas like this boxing party. Niggas been dancing too much. I don't even want, I don't wanna see his tank now. We ain't got nobody to fight. That's crazy. We can't fight lawn. Mow he he going through mental health problems. I would too if I was looking at Tank. Nobody want no hang niggas is done with him. Yeah this daddy trying bring you back but Nobody thinks Shakur gonna really fight. He going, he fighting but he ain't gonna fight. That's what they say. Damn that's a crazy we left a fight all gonna say we though we had wait for a new wave of of up and coming amateurs to like really get excited about boxing again 'cause everybody's at the point to where it's like it's all arms length.


Niggas ain't really trying to fight. Niggas don't wanna lose. You know Heiny should fight anybody now you already got the L like fuck it. Yep. Turn up now. But do it count though 'cause it got reversed. Yeah. Count nigga we watch you get whooped nigga. Nah I'm rolling. You got in the ring bro. Yeah, But they said he know I'm saying they sponge he cheated quote unquote so it don't count. He still, you know what I'm saying, Good motherfuckers over there. They don't give a fuck about that. His ass right it on the wall bro. Nigga seen it like That's crazy. How to the t You gotta be in boxing though Bro. It's like, it's like NCA bro. If you lose in college football, your season is fucked. Like you get a little bit of redemption. If you lose to a good team, you gotta be a really good powerhouse bro.


College football, you lose one game. Your season is fuck Bro. But do you think that shit really matters like in baseball for real? You Say what? Like steroid or any enhancement drugs? Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah bro Like, like niggas like Barry Bonds was already sluggers bro. Yeah but if you can recover faster than somebody bro that means a total Like so that's the, that's the biggest problem with it is the recovery or Yeah If I could performance we do it like lifting weights. If I could bench press every single day Yeah and you can only bench press twice a day. I mean twice a week I'm gonna get bigger, I'm gonna get stronger than you. They can recover so fast. So like they don't get tired, they muscles recover.


I'm thinking baseball is probably a little bit more even 'cause so many people had access to it and so many different things going to it. But in boxing like you said bro I'm bigger, it's faster, stronger than you because of this bro. You don't have a chance. Okay. I just wanted to 'cause I, to me I felt like Barry Bonds was always good at baseball. He was him taking that extra kicker which just like Now you already that good and now you about to add this so amount of power behind it. It's like what the fuck? And it was so od in baseball 'cause like you look at Mark McGuire before and after bro it's crazy. Niggas like a fucking wrestler but everybody diner did or everybody had equal access. So I ain't saying this right but I feel like if baseball's way more of a equal playing field 'cause they pick and choose niggas that they letting the hall of Fame off that shit and they pick and choose who they wanna bl mission and hold back.


Nah they all was doing stupid. I'm like damn was Ken Griffey the only clean nigga ever in the motherfucking major league baseball era? Nah, I mean it, it was, it was some but a lot of, a lot of stars was far more tainted than people wanted pocket criticism. I wouldn't be surprised not to know no shade that Ken gr. I'm sure he did something like we got a homeboy that played baseball. He was just like you can't compete if you don't take something, you gotta catch something before it's illegal. Yeah. He was like you can't compete. Like he was like I was trying not to do anything. He was like I made, I made it to the minors. I couldn't even get there. I just couldn't compete 'cause I tried to stay clean. Damn. That's why I said in baseball I can't even be mad at it bro. It's too, it's de intertwined with the game but you gonna be on some shit but boxing nigga you, you catch that motherfucking needle at a good time or you gonna beat this.

Man, listen, traveling would be crazy, but I'm so happy that we agreed upon staying in the Airbnb the last time we slid out. Especially for you here. You know what I'm saying? They had the whole kitchen ready for you. Yeah, traveling sometimes. And they book me at a hotel and I gotta get a ghost kitchen sometimes in the other cities that we travel to. So being able to have all my utensils, pots and pans, I greatly appreciate that. Made my job easier For sure, man. We had a lot more space than anticipated. Had the camera crew in there solidified. Ended up doing a little bit of extra work in there. Man. It was perfect. Out to Airbnb, how you feel about the T. The food was nasty, but Airbnb was great.
