Yeah, Lamar also said he doesn't view the matchup with the Chiefs as a revenge game. Any game I play and I feel like it's a revenge game, nah, because the stakes aren't the same. Yeah. Now, Now if we get back to the same situation, Ocho, you're damn right. Hey, now, even though revenge even It's a revenge game, I can't go back and take what you've already gotten, but I want my lick back. Oh, you your ass out. I want you to feel like how I felt last year. Yeah. Like you were going to the Super Bowl And, we were taking our ass home. So I wanna give you that feeling 'cause you hadn't had that feeling in quite a while, pat. Yeah. You know that. Yeah. A long, long time. And I want you to feel that Long time. So I want you, when you're driving away from the stadium and the fans waving, saying, don't worry about it.


We had a good season. That's what I want you hear. Hey. And I want you to play in the Pro Bowl 'cause I won't be playing in the Pro Bowl this year. I'm gonna be getting ready for the Super Bowl that Hey, that would be I thinking if I, if I'm a, if I, if I'm a a, a Lamar. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna get your ass back. Yeah. IIII don't, I slow down a little bit. You talking about the Ravens playing in the Super Bowl, you know Joe Burrow and the Bangals are gonna be ready for New Orleans, Man, Joe a b he, he, he got one. He got one one against The ball. I know. We, I know. I I know we won three. It's a new season, huh? It's a new season. It's a new season. And I know we have a lot of Ravens fans in the chat. I love you. No disrespect.


No I love you and I've always showed love and grace to all of you as fans, even when I was playing. But I'm telling you the A SC North runs through the 5 1 3 stop playing. And if anybody in the chat that's a Ravens fan, wanna put some money on it, put your money up. Let's bet you talking about Man shoot Jersey. Who they stop playing with me. You know what it is? The Patriots are entering a new era without Coach Belichick and their jerseys reflect that the Patriots captains will wear C on their jersey this season. Something Belichick never allowed. But new coach Jared may, Gerard, may, will, may said, I do think it's important to have that c on the jersey. That's one difference that I think's important.


It's a badge of honor. And I think when our guys do the right thing, they should be recognized for those things. It's something as small as having a captain's patch. I think it's important for those guys. Ocho you like that? It's dope. It's cool. But you know, Belichick wasn't with that Listen, one team, we all come out at the same time where we introduce one band, one sound. You know? I mean that's, that's, that was the way Belichick ran everything. You know, again, I use a, I use the, I use the analogy, I've never been to the Army, I've never been to the Navy. I don't know what it's like to be part of the Marines, but the way that team was ran was in a militant manner.


We all move as one. So there was no need for the, you know, the c on the chest. We knew who, we knew who the captain was. We knew who ran the show. He was number 12. Yeah. We knew who it was, you know, but I, I think it is, it is a cool thing. Rod Mayo getting back to, you know what, what a lot of other team do and having a captain and it No, it is dope. Yeah, It's dope. I like that because I'm not doing what coach, I'm not Coach Belichick. Coach Belichick. Yeah. Completely showed him not to have the seeds. I choose to have them. Right. Yeah. Coach Belichick father coached at the Naval Academy. I think his dad was in the Naval Academy. Yeah. And so you could understand why the militarism, the militaristic style in which he coached the discipline, the determination, the dedication.


You have to have that in the military. Or as Colonel Nathan Jessop said, men die. Yeah. When men don't follow orders, men die. Die. Yeah. There are consequences. And Coach Belichick did a great job of conveying that. His players did a great job of understanding that. And that's why there were very few times, you probably can count on one hand how many, how many times that you could say a Coach Belichick team beat themselves. Yeah. Very Seldom. They're not gonna get those stupid penalty. They're not gonna do seldom. You never see Coach Belichick players died with the ball trying to pun get, get the ball over the end zone. Either. No. Going out at the one. If we can't get it in four downs, we don't deserve to get the ball in the end zone. Right. Because the risk reward, you get it punched out, it goes out the back of the end zone.


Now not only do we not get points, they get the ball at the 20 going out the other way. So he did a great job of that. But I do like it. Lemme ask you a question, do you think Yes sir. Players care about having that sea on this shirt on the jersey? I, I think it's dope to understand and know how your peers feel about you, how your teammates feel about you, you know, being able to don that sea you on your shirt. I think, I think it's, it's cool. It is, it is really, it's a really dope honor to know that your peers and your players view you as that captain and, and the, and the leader of men when it's time to go to war on that field. I think I, I think it's dope.


Yeah. I mean, I'm, listen, I, when I, when I played, when wouldn't a guy, shit, I, I ain't care nothing about that captain. I, I couldn't be a captain because I was too busy goddamn there making jokes before, before the time to go play. But I, I, I I guess it's cool. Yeah. I guess it's cool. Yeah. I would love to have a jersey with Captain on that thing and you know, that wasn't a thing. Yeah. I think it came in like a couple, maybe a year or two after I left. Right. But it would've been an unbelievable honor of course to to know I was a three time captain at Savannah State. We didn't have, obviously we didn't have no CI don't even think what Dion put leader and then I think Trav got d which means dog on his.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I think it, I think it's an unbelievable honor and everybody that gets that Captain C on their jersey, they should, they should feel proud of themselves that the coaches and the players thought that No, to them that you're the captain of this team. We, we, we, we believe in. You believe and Yeah. I thought, I think it would be an unbelievable honor if that, if that would've happened. Oh, Joe, check this out. NC is reporting. The NFL could soon look to start the season with games on Labor Day. There'll reportedly be games scheduled Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. You like it.


I I shit as hell. I like it. You, you give me more football, that's better for me. No, you give me more money. That's better for me. Well the money gonna come or there ain't gonna be no games played. Yeah. So they adding the game on everybody. You just understand that that's an extra check. Yeah, that's an extra check. I think the thing is they doing that ocho, but are you gonna add an extra bi week? Because now if you add 18 game, the game is already the second Sunday in February. You add that extra. Everybody had, everybody had two buy On. Hey man, you playing, you playing. What's the, the holiday in, in February? President's Day? You playing game? Damn the 1st of March. Yeah.


Yeah. I mean, look, the NFL look, the NFL is king. And the only way that you can get money, more money out of these linear, linear networks, these streaming services is to give them what they want. Well, you gotta play, you gotta play ball. Yeah. And you Gotta play ball and the players are going to get a slice of the pot. Yeah. The players are gonna get a piece of the pot. So I, I listen, I I like it. I like, well they Already gonna have this, this Thanksgiving. Don't they got a game like leading up to Thanksgiving? They got games like Thursday, Friday. Yeah, we got a, I mean they got a Friday game this week. Coach yo. Yeah. Green Bay and, and, and, and Finley play Friday.


Yeah. I mean, And, we got a game Thursday, so Hey, that, that's, that's be, that's better for me. Yeah. Because I'm excited. I'm waiting for football season. Yeah. I've been waiting, you know how long I've been waiting for this? I've been waiting for this for a long time. Yeah. So that means you're probably gonna only have like two preseason games. Yeah. And then, you know, you have two preseasons of games now. Guys will get to come to camp probably a little later 'cause I don't think you'd have, you know, two preseason games, Ocho and then, 'cause after the third preseason game, you still got like two weeks. So that means you gonna have two pre games and have three weeks before you play. Probably bring the players in later, a week later, maybe even 10 days later, have the two games and then boom, we gonna get ready to go.


You know? So you might not be coming in Camp Ocho until damn near the end of July, the beginning of August. I I don't, I don't like not having enough preseason games for players that, are they not playing sixth, seventh round. When The last time you saw, when the last time you saw Patrick Mahomes played the preseason. Hold on. So you think, you think, you think two games is enough to evaluate players that are trying to make a team. They're not playing your starters aren't playing O Joe. That's what that's what I'm saying. I'm talking about the players getting that, that were drafted in lower rounds. Yeah. And, and free agents. Do you think two preseason games is enough film to be able to make a team? I guess they're doing a lot of eval.


OTA Right. They're doing a lot of eval, you know, the mandatory, the minis and the mandatory minis and you know, you're just gonna have to show a lot earlier. Okay. They're probably gonna in, you know, the practice squads. So you know, you a guy, maybe he's not ready to play right now. Right. But a year I think he'll be ready. You just hope somebody, he doesn't show somebody else enough that they signed him off your practice squad and put his ass on the active Roster. Come get waivers. Right. And put his ass on the, the active roster. But we know this is coming because I think they got like Thanksgiving. I think they got a, like a Tuesday game. Like Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.


Damn. That might be Christmas. That might be the Christmas schedule. Ash. But they got a, like, they got like, I think they play like every game every day except like Wednesday. Because we know, I mean they had the Black Friday, the Black Friday game. Friday game. Yep. Speaking of Black Friday, boy, I can't wait for themselves Man. That's, they in the sale. All they do is, all they do is mark it up the two weeks before and then mark it down to make you think you getting something with it. You don't shop on Black Friday at Target. So they got game Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, not Saturday. So Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday, Monday.


Okay. Woo. Black Friday, baby. Oh white. You heard Me? Unc what happened? You don't shop, you don't shop at on Black Friday? Man. I ain't been on the bra. No, I'm talking about, I'm, I'm saying, I'm saying for me, listen, target Black Friday at Target, the Hanes underwear, the, the tank tops, the white tees, the gold toe socks, you know about the gold toe socks. What you Know about that? Well I know, I know the prices, Man. Why you wearing gold toe socks for dress shoes? Those for dress shoes? No, no, no.


The cotton, cotton socks with the gold toe. It just, they just call, I just call 'em gold toe. 'cause the the tow is Gold. I Yes, that's what, but that's what the dress Are. But they slice in prices in half. What? No, that's you paying full price. You just think you paying in half, but Okay. No, I know the prices. I got the Target app. Huh? I got the Target app. I know the prices now don't do me like that. Yeah, No I don't. No Shelly, Shelly shops on Black, black Friday. I don't shop. But I don't mean, I mean she, it is not like she, I mean, occasionally she'll go and get it, but for the most part she'll just order it and Okay. Have it sent to then have it sent. I'll try it on. Okay. I like it. I don't, she'll come when she comes, she send it back. Nah, but going the store, like actually you, oh look, you, me to tell me like going to the store and actually try stuff on.


No, no, no. I don't do that. I don't do that. That's like 10, 15 years. Well, hold on. You don't, you don't just go to Target just to walk up and down the aisle? No, I go to Target if I go to Target if I'm low on something, but now Shelly just buys everything so she'll buy. Oh no. She'll buy like, like those big old Listerine. She'll buy like four of those. Yeah. She'll buy like 20 twos of toothpaste. She'll buy like, you know, plaques, like 15 things of plaques. And so once I get to like five, she'll buy like 10 shower gels. Yeah. So I don't really need to go. Yeah. I mean, but see I is, I don't think you understand like just there's a certain excitement. I don't know about you Chad, I don't under, I don't know about y'all, but there's a certain excitement I get.


I don't want to use the word like a adrenaline rush, but there's a certain excitement about just going in Target, just knowing you're going in there and you're going in there for one thing. And the challenge in being able to just purchase that one thing is such a great feeling to see if you can actually do it. I can't. And being able, just being able to walk up and down each aisle, like it's that like going to the Target brings me such joy. I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It's weird. I don't know if I'm the only one that has this weird fascination with this damn store, but like, it's awesome. It's like every time I walk in it's like I've never been there before. It's like I've never been there. I'd be happy, I'd be happy as hell. I I, I mean, one time I had a girlfriend send me to the store to get some hamburger patties.


She said all I, all you need is hamburger, patties and bun. You, I came back with $250 worth of grocery man. I done bought man, I done bought cornbread. I done bought everything. I done bought, I done bought filet, I done bought Rib eyes. Yeah. And I done bought everything. I apul shop. So that's why I don't really need, like, I'll go for one. I might go for one thing, man. I'm getting grapes, plums, Apple, all type of Stuff. I'm getting everything. So it's just best I'm coming back with, with granola chips. So it's like, I, I try to stay, I don't really do a whole lot of shopping. So that Shelly's job, Shelly, Shelly, Shelly get paid to do all that stuff.


So it can wait till she get here. If I get a, if I need something she'll do like, because I don't have, I don't have Lyft, I don't have Uber Eats. Yeah. I don't have those kind of apps on my phone. So I can't order it. So she'll order it. Right, right, Right. Or you know, like, like Uber, she, like my daughter used to say I had my daughter this weekend. You know, I'm trying her out. She interning right now. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Shelly gave her the card. So she was in charge of transportation, making sure everybody gets from point A to point B. And she did a great job. I said, baby, you did a great job. I said, but you know what Daddy expect now you like, y'all know daddy. I said, okay. Just so we know. Yeah. Just so we clear. Oh Joe, we briefly touched on the Brazil game last night where Darius Slay came out and said he doesn't want to play the game in Brazil.


He said, ah, they already told us not to leave the hotel. They tell us we can't do too much going on because the crime rate is crazy. I'm like NFL. Why y'all wanna send us somewhere where the crime rate is high? I told my family not to come down here because I'm not going to be nowhere to be found. I'm gonna be in my hotel chilling, minding my business, playing my game after a long nine and a half hour flight. So I don't have no intentions of doing anything. I'm gonna eat hotel food, I'm gonna be doing everything. But they said it's, it's going to be pretty crazy down here. I listen, I understand where you coming from. I understand where you coming from. The gangs in Brazil, they, they are kind of crazy knowing the NFL and the security and the measures that they're going to take.


I think the players are gonna be o be okay. Especially wherever, wherever they are staying. But what the NFL is trying to do is continue to go Blow the game Globally to grow the NFL brand globally. And a place that is dominated by the game of football, soccer, for that matter. I under, I understand what they're doing, trying to present American football over there in Brazil. I think, I think it's a great thing. It's a great thing for the game, but I don't want the players to get distracted or focus on the part of not wanting to go to Brazil. Not wanting to go to Brazil, but focus, focusing on the game in hand. I wanna go to Brazil. Yeah. Listen, I You wanna go for Thero?

Even swap, even trade, even swindle.


Go look it up. I know y'all think I'm crazy talking about Google it and see they got recipes for it too. Ocho, they got recipes for it. I ain't never heard of that. See I ain't heard of it until you told me about it. Google it. They gonna Google it. They ain't gonna believe it though. Google Dick and Honey Jordan Google it right now. Jordan say man. Oh when we, when we going back down south again? I wanna try it. I know I got one person that'll try it as, as where? Okay. Oh. Bleacher Report revealed their most underrated team, underrated players at their position.


Quarterback with Jerry running back. Chuba Hubbard, wide receiver Brandon Cook. Darius Slaton. Khalil Shaki. Tight end Cole commit Ocho. Do you agree with the team? I like that. I like that. Especially the Jerry Golf one severely underrated. Brandon Cooks is a good one. Darius Slaton is is nice. Nice Cole. Cole Ette gonna have a year. I like it. Cole is going, that Cole Ette is going to have a year. Very, very good.


Very, very good. Tight end. Let see Sha secure from Buffalo. I guess he gonna try to pick up some of the slack vacated by, by Stepan, by Dig. And Gabe, Gabe Davis. Gabe Davison in Jacksonville. He, they lost him Too. I know, I know. I said I said some of the slack to pick up some of the slack since, since those two are gone. Well listen, obviously Shakira showed them something, showed them something for the, for for them to be able to let both of them go. So he's up next. Him and Keon Coleman up next. Oh Joe, the Clipper saw big changes made this off season when PG Paul George elected to lead to the 76ers in free agency.


Paul George recently brought his father, Paul George Senior on podcast P, which is po, which is Paul George's podcast. Paul Paul George Senior did not hold back when talking about his son's departure. It was hurting. It was like, I felt that they stabbed us in the back because I thought Paul did a lot for the team as far as the fan base. The fans was there and he was there. I think he gave 110%. What he was asking, it wasn't a whole lot, but they saw something different. Ocho, I mean listen, you know, family, his son defending his son, He should Business the Clippers and what they see and how they value value are two different things.


Absolutely correct. You are absolutely correct. And that is exactly why whatever Paul, Paul George felt he was worth the Clippers didn't for whatever reason. Yeah. For Whatever reason it may be. It's tough when you think about what they gave up to get him. Yeah. They gave up Shea Gilda, they gave up all those draft high, those draft picks. They gave up those pop swap pigs. They gave up dollar. I mean they gave up a lot to get him. Yes sir. And as of right now that You think it's panned out, has it panned out?


You think you Oklahoma City. Yeah. It panned out for them. Right. That got damn shit Gil, that Shea gives gives us Alexander Good man. Damn. They gave him up. Goddamn damn. They gave him up. You look at all the pick the draft picks that they surrendered to get PJ and only went to the conference finals I think when they went once. But that's a lot because Hawaii couldn't, can't stay healthy. PG couldn't stay healthy. The best chance they had was in the bubble and they gagged the three more lead and Yeah, I know. 'cause PG was home. He wanted to come home when Andy traded him, he thought he was coming to the Lakers, but that didn't happen.


He goes to O kc. Right. He resigns stays in OKC and then situation with Russ wanted to leave, blah blah, blah. He ends up getting traded to LA so he's home. I think he's from Palmdale, so he's probably, you know, an hour away. So he is basically home. Yeah. Yeah. And, if you wanna stay home, you wanna stay home at that home. Pg, you gonna keep more of your money now, bro. Oh yeah. A-B-L-A-B taxing boy, Ocho probably the biggest thing Yes. On the internet tonight is what Nancy Lieberman said on Steven a's podcast about Sheryl. Swoopes. Let's take a listen to what Nancy, one of the great female women's players of all time. Let's take a listen to what she had to say That said, you know, Kaitlyn was, you know, 25 years old.


She was however old, 24 years old. She was a 50 year senior. Right. She was taking 40 shots a game. Her records were illegitimate. And I, I got off the treadmill and I called her as a friend and I said, you know, you can say whatever you want. You can have your own opinion about anybody, but you do have to get the statistics right. I mean, facts matter. And, if you just get ahead of this and just say, Hey, I made a mistake on my numbers, then this thing is over and everybody respects you for your opinion and you know, you might like Boston. I might like the Yankees, you know, it's okay to have difference of opinions. Well, she, she got upset with me on the phone and I was like, Cheryl, you know, I'm not doing anything to hurt you. I'm just sharing we're we're talking. And so our relationship, it, it pretty much, I is not happening at this point.


I tried to talk to her at the Final Four. She didn't wanna talk to me. My life's gonna be good or great with or without she soups in my life. I'd rather have her in it. Ooh, Ooh. Shoot. The fact that, you know what, there's one thing about women, one thing about women. They will sever a relationship quick behind anything, behind any disagreement that me and you, we can, we can agree to disagree. Yeah. And, we gonna Show them all, you know, And, we gonna be straight. But the fact that the relationship was severed because there was a difference in opinion Wasn't that strong to begin With despite the facts not being, despite the facts not being correct. Basically what, what, what Ms. Nancy was saying.


But I mean, that's, that's, that's unfortunate because there have been so many situations where this always happens when it comes to women. I hear these stories all the time, just in this case, the topic has to be Cheryl Swoop saying something about Caitlyn Clark. That's not factual Ocho And not wanting to take accountability as well, I'm assuming, huh? If The least thing can cause someone to distance themself the friendship was never legitimate or authentic anyway. There's no way. Right. Okay. Someone gets off their treadmill and call me and say, well Shannon, you misspoke about this. I do it all the time. Ocho you know, I have a lot of stuff.


So I might give someone, they scored this many touchdowns, no, they had that many, or they scored this, this many sacks. Or I might mispronounce someone or I might get a situation where the player is no longer on the team even. Right. And a lot of times it's like I will correct myself and say, guys, before we move on to the next subject, I misspoke such and such is no longer on that team is on that team. Right. He's here. Right. Or I misspoke. He had this many touchdowns, he played this many years so forth and so on. Yeah. I'm trying to correct it. Ocho if somebody tries to correct me and I sever a relationship or I'm no longer on speaking terms, we never have a friendship to begin with to Begin with. Right. There's no possible way.


And I don't, I don't get, see this, this is what I'm having a hard time with OCHO is because, and a lot of times what I've gotten, and I'm not gonna talk 'cause I've, I've talked to some of these great legendary WNBA players and they tell me, Shannon, don't forget about the old guard When magic and bird, they say magic and bird saved the NBA. They didn't say nothing about Wilt Kareem. They didn't say anything about Mr. Russell. Yes sir. They didn't say about Connie Hawkins. Elgin Baylor, Jerry West. I don't give her look.


Whatever you might think, never in the history. And there've been some great players came in with this kind of fanfare. Candace Parker was tremendous rookie of the year and MVP Anna Player of the Year. She's great. Maya Moore Stewart, all of these women were more accomplished college players than Kaitlyn Clark. Right. But there's a reason why you had a record watching the WNBA draft. There's a reason why the record attendance, there's a reason why Jersey sales and ticket sales are up instead of trying to be dismissive of the role that she's playing and try to say, well, y'all not talking about the, well come on When we talk about, when we talk about Luca and Yoki and this one that don't automatically go back and start.


Well you remember what Bill Russell did You remember what this one did that Don't do that guys. Come on women. I have, I have a question Bete there. Their, their stellar play in college, Andrew Reese and Caitlyn Clark. Do you also think that everything is magnified and intensified as far as their popularity, especially as far as the game is concerned because of social media? Yeah. Because they have a following. Yes. They come in with a following Yes. And Exposure and exposure from social media as well. Yeah. Okay. For sure. Yes. So the times a little different. Yeah. When Candace Parker and, and some of those young ladies were coming out, I think if social media was at its height back then, I think they would've gotten the same type of love because they were just as polarizing and good at the game of basketball as well.


So I think the timing for Kaitlyn Clark and Angel Reese is, is awesome during the social media era. Yes. But Cher two things can be true. Those women were great. They were, they were absolutely great. Phenomenal. Caitlyn Clark is a polarizing figure and people gravitate towards her. Right. That's, that, that is absolutely that, that, that, that happened. It's okay. Right. Kaitlyn Clark's success doesn't diminish what Shery swoops accomplished. It doesn't diminish what Maya Moore, what Candace Parker What Sheryl Swoopes what?


Lauren Jackson, what Stewie what Aja Wilson, whatever they have done before Kaitlyn Clark arrived. Kaitlyn Clark's arrival doesn't diminish anything that they've done. But the guy, but the game grow is growing and all these women, I'm glad that some of the women, I wish that a lot of the women could have been in and benefited from it because they don't make nearly, I mean, I think the highest salary you could make is a quarter of a million. Well, those women, the Cheryl Swoops and the Candace Parkers, they were never, I don't think they were ever in line to make that kind of money. Right. And it's only going up from here.


But that, I think the thing of Ocho, the best part about what we do is that it's called Nightcap. It's over your head. It's directly, it's to my, my right shoulder is to your directly over your head. We get to talk about what we want to talk about. Yes sir. ES pn, no control of this platform. We wanted to talk about the Olympics. We wanted to talk about track and field. We wanted to talk about what we want to talk about what other, what other podcasts, what other network talked about it Just because y'all say, oh, oh, y'all ESP don't tell me what to say. They don't tell me what to say on the, on, on, on our first tape. How they gonna tell me what to say on mine? This is mine. Right. That's why I created it Can't fire me from this.


We own this. Y'all can't get Yeah. Just because what happens is if you disagree with something, somebody says, oh, he bought, oh, he just talking. What, what I get, I don't get no checks. But see, this is what I don't get. You say something good about LeBron you bought, but they talk about Kobe and Jordan all the time. So how many pair of shoes did Kobe send you? Hmm. How many Jordan, how many pair of shoes Jordan get you? So how many checks you getting for saying that Jordan's the goat that Kobe's the goat. Oh, only LeBron is paying folks. Hmm. Now when I had K Angel Reese's jacket on when I spoke, well Angel Reese, when, when I tweeted, I tweeted like, congratulations Angel Reese by you Barbie getting selected.


Seventh of all right. Oh. Oh. Y'all ain't say, oh Angel Reese, Reese ain't the only one getting drafted. Now all of a sudden I'm like, huh. So guess what? I'm gonna keep talking. Oh, you don't never talk about Asia Wilson. Really, dude. Really? Yeah. They, They, it's people. It's people. It's people that watch clips and they don't watch the whole show. Thank you. No, that Go ahead. If you go Ahead Ocho if you wa if, if you watch the whole show, you would know that We talk about everybody, all the WNBA players that are playing well What We do.


That's it Everyone, we, we, everyone gets their praise. But a lot of times ocho this how it goes, there are a lot of guys in the NFL that play great Mahome Lamar. Most of the guys, it's the quarterbacks that gets the attention in the NBA. There are a lot of players that go play great. It's Steph, LeBron, Katie, and the big guns. It's not unique. Y'all make it seem like it's unique. There are a lot of founding fathers that built, because anytime something that's su that's, that's the, the NBA is 1947, if I'm not mistaken. So almost 80 years. Okay. Now you got the NFL over a hundred years old.


Sure. MLB 150. Damn near 150 years old. Yes. They're a founding, there are people that built this. But how is it her fault when she was born? How is it her fault that fans love her? There were other, have there been great players? Yes. Yes. There were great white players before Larry Bird. You just happened to be the best one before. Now, when it's all said and done, Nicole Yoic might have something to say about that. Oh yeah. Luca could have something to say about that, thinking about that, And That's okay.


That's okay. But I don't, I don't get this old, the old guard. The old guard. All I'm saying is this, people wasn't phonetic, it wasn't buzzing the WNBA and they, people didn't talk about it like they do. Instead of being upset about it, I'm gonna ride the wave. It might not even been my wave ocho, but hell, I'm out here on the surfboard, so hell, I'm gonna ride it to the shore. You gonna ride it? Anyway. But Nancy Lieberman, look, I love Sheryl Swoopes. I've met Sheryl Swoopes had conversation with a couple of times, always been great to me, but I don't get, I don't think Na Nancy said anything that's wrong, Cheryl, you just got you.


You know, your facts are off. She didn't shoot this many times. She wasn't this and she wasn't that. Okay. You get upset because you said something that wasn't factually correct and somebody corrects you. And now that's a ground that you're not, no longer, you're gonna cut off communication. Yeah. I mean, and also Miss Lip, miss, miss, miss, miss Nancy could be exaggerating a little bit because what she considers friends, you know, our people don't really consider as friends. Oh, sweetie, you are, you are an associate. You're, you're, you're you. May you, you know what I mean? Yeah. Sometimes it ain't really friends the way a, an individual thinks. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you got my phone number when I see you, I see you.


It's cool. But thinking like we actually friends like that, like, come on now. Yeah. But so I, I, I kind of, I, I, I understand. I Mean, but think about it. There's a lot of these, a lot of great players didn't get an opportunity to play in the WNBA and when they came, you gotta think about how old they were when they got there. They were already in their late twenties or early thirties. Right. It's not like these women now coming outta college at 21, 21 and 22. It was in their late twenties, early thirties. Right. Damn. Yeah, I get it. You know what it is, OCHO? Yeah. You won't let the elephant out the room. Nah, I don't do that. I don't do that. I don't do that. Leave the elephant in there.


You know what it is? Yeah. Leave. Yeah, leave the, leave the elephant in there. It's okay. Most of the people in the WNBA look like us, and they say why they don't get no praise. Why y'all wasn't talking about them. That's what it is. Let's be real. Let's be real with it now. Yes, sir. It'd been interesting to have social media. What would've been said about Larry Bird? Because the large, the larger percent of the NBA was paid black. Remember Isaiah? Isaiah said it. He caught Black, said If Larry Bird was black, he'd just be another player. Mm.


They thinking the same thing. Kaitlyn Clark was black. She'd just be another player. Y'all wouldn't be happy it up. Shannon, Shannon ain't got no money. Hey, Shannon. Ain't ain't signed Kaitlyn Clark to no marketing deal. He ain't getting with no shoe deal. Y'all get need to get mad to the advertisers and sponsors. Don't get mad at Shannon Pat, tell y'all what's going on. I keep it stack with your ocho. I see. I get it. They ain't, they ain't gonna like that one, bro.

Are you ready to have your bacon loving? Mind blown? Well, here it is. Oscar Meyer takes 12 hours to smoke some delicious thick cut bacon to perfection. Listen, most of the bacon out there is smoked for four to six hours, but Oscar Meyer doubles that time. Let me put that into perspective. You could drive from Detroit to Omaha and Oscar Meyer. Thick cut bacon. Still wouldn't be finished smoking. Check this out. You could go to bed. You can get a full night's sleep. Hell, you could wake up, shower, have breakfast, including some delicious Oscar Meyer bacon, and then drive to work, and that bacon would still be smoking.

So go out, buy some Oscar Mayer thick cut bacon now and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.

And definitely hope we're coming to a city near you. Alexio. Guys, how good was the bus? I feel like he doesn't get the recognition he deserves when he was talking about great running backs of all time.


Any good stories? I re I played against Bus when he was with the Rams. Yeah. I caught him when he was, when he was the Steelers, I think early in my career. I called, I called him early, early, early in his career. He got to name the bus for a reason. Oh yeah. He could run over, he could run by you. Yeah. You, you look at It as ordinary. You're like, man, that little ra fat ra ain't gonna do nothing. Okay. Like I said, I caught him with the Rams. Right. That's all I'm gonna say. I caught him with the Rams. He would like that. Oh, ke.


Nor would you. Hey Kera, you let me die, bro. Kera, you let me die. You let Ocho beat you. Kera. You gotta redeem yourself, bro. You gotta redeem yourself. That's all I'm Gonna say. I'm, listen, I'm a, I'm a spelling be champ for a reason, man. I can't find my goddamn hat though. I know that Real Probably threw that thing away. Kevin Norwood Jr. Said, who's the team not named the 49 ERs that have the chance in the NFC to get to the Super Bowl? Packers? Lions. Rams. Eagles.


Eagles, cow Eagles Cowboys. But I would say, I would say Green Bay first for me. Green Bay, the Lions for sure. Now we start getting Rams, Cowboys Eagles. But I like, I like, I like what Dan Campbell has been able to build. Even though I thought he was outta his damn mind when he first got that, that first press conference talking about he gonna be biting kneecaps and scratching claw kneecaps. Yeah. Listen, that's, and that's just, that's the same way they planned too. Yep. Biting kneecaps. Yeah.


Yeah. Everybody but the Cowboys. Damn. Huh. Nah. Look, it's gonna be very interesting to see. We gonna find out a lot. I think the Cowboys open up on the road against Cleveland. Right. Ooh, that and listen, and that's a good test too now. Yeah. That goddamn Cleveland defense ain't no goddamn slouch. That Cleveland Defense ain't no slouch. Oh no. You just wrote that in there. Ash. 84 85 in Georgia Show in Dallas. Unc, I'm a Dallas officer giving you a correct address to total wines North Central Expressway.


Will Travis Hunter win the Heisman and be a top five pick? Man, it's so, he gonna Be a, he gonna be a tight, I Think he be a top five pick. I I can tell you that. Yeah. The Heisman, the Heisman going to a quarterback man. Yeah, yeah. Might Shado might win that. The question is, Ocho, can they win enough games? That's not fair. I don't, I don't, I don't like that. Because you can continue to perform at a very high level and you should still be able to win the Heisman even if you losing games because, statistically, Because, because because those, those, those statue probably up, they need to impact wins. Yeah. Okay. I like it. Well, who else is out?


Who, who else out there should win the Heisman? Well, I mean, look, it is one, it's one game. Did you not see what Miller Moss did for the USC? Like you said quarterbacks, quarterbacks gonna have 40 touchdowns on Joe, think about, look at what James Daniels did last year. Look at what Caleb Williams did the year before. Who, what plan going gonna top that? Bryce Young, 45 touchdowns, four interceptions. Joe Burrow, 60 touchdowns, five interceptions. Really? Ocho Well, they had what he Damn there, 6,000 yards passing.


Remember who we were throwing to now? Yeah, but Still, but still. So how do you, so how do you top that? Yeah. When a quarterback rolls for 45, 50 touchdowns with five, six interceptions and they go nine and three, it's hard. I mean, it's gonna be hard for anybody other than now they mess around it. Let's just say for the sake of argument, they go eight and four. Yes, sir. And Trav has 11, 1200 yards receiving. He has 10 touchdowns, but on defense, he has, you know, four picks. Couple of four fumbles.


Now he comes into play. Now he comes into play. Yeah, I know when he going top five, I know that. Oh yeah, for sure. He, he legit. Hell shit. Maybe top goddamn three. Shit. JW Akron. How did you and your siblings get your nicknames and what was one of your worst rebellious moments as a kid when you grew up and when I grew up, there was no rebellious moments. Oh no.

You going to get nickname and they're gonna stick. And no matter, I mean, you could call somebody a nickname so much you forget their real name. Name. Yeah. Because me and Bucket be talking sometimes, but me and Burns. And they was like, man, such and such. I was like, who? What was what? I said, what do we call him in school? What was his nickname or what did we call him on the team? Yeah, because you, I, I done forgot. I done called so I done called him so many times. Hell, I done called Bucket for the last 30 years. I sometimes forget that his name is Darrell. Right. But yeah, I mean, if you from the size, you gonna get a nickname.
