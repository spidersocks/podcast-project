The Bengals have reportedly banned reporters from filming players crossing the street to the practice facility. This comes after fans. Were making fun of the team online yesterday. Pocho, did you see this? Why are professional athletes having to cross the street to get to practice? I mean, why are professional athletes having to ride bicycles to get to practice in training camp in Green Bay? I mean, what, what are we talking about here? I mean, most of the time OCHO people don't have to cross the street. You just go this, you know, It's not that, it's not that far of a walk. Huh? It ain't it ain't that bad. I took it. I took, I took, I normally people just walk out with the field and the practice field is right there. I mean, it's in the practice field. It's still right there.


It's not that far. No it ain't no it didn't. Don't show y'all right. Y'all right up under the bridge. You can go over the overpass. Hey, people in Cincinnati, y'all wanna watch the Brown, the Bengals practice Drive right over that. Park your car and look right over the overpass. There they go. It's not, it's not that bad. The walker's not that bad. I just asked you a question. Could they do that yes or no? What you mean? Could they do what The fans could they park their car on the, on the, the highway, the overpass and watch you guys practice? It's a yes or no. Yeah. They used to come watch me all the time. Okay. Because I was entertaining. That's not, that's not normal. No other team can you do that? Well, we have a bubble too now. That's when it's cold outside.


Y'all practice the main the majority of the time outside. Well, what's wrong with that? You still can't stop us. You could watch all you want. You still ain't gonna stop us on Sunday. Man, y'all was terrible for like a hundred years. Ocho. Who? The Bengals we Talking about Now. You could go up there and watch a good film practice all you want. You still not gonna Stop t Oh shit. Oh, I I bet they don't let nobody film practice E Even if you do, you're still not gonna stop our players. You not gonna stop t Higgins, you not gonna stop Jermaine Bur yes you can. You ain't gonna stop Joe Burrow mean what you talking about? No, if that was the case, why they stop filming? Why they won't let y'all film no more from the, from the situation like Coach Belichick did, used to do Spygate. Why they stop that? I don't know. I you do know. Oh, I, I don't know.


But you can, you can spy on me. I'ma steal, I'm gonna still route your ass up. There, there, there's a reason why they huddle. There's a reason why it doesn't matters Ocho. Right. There's a reason why. I mean, yeah, listen, it, it matters. It matters to some, to some that's gonna get it out the mud no matter what. Whether you know it or not, you finna get this work. I'm telling you what I'm getting ready to do and I'm gonna go out there and do it anyway. Now that's how I think now, unfortunately, to the masses and those that, you know, it matters much more too. They want an advantage as much as possible in not knowing what's going to happen.


I felt good. I felt good getting that off my chest. Yeah, Y'all, y'all was the man. I mean, back in the day, you're like, y'all was bad. Like, okay, I'm gonna send you to Cincinnati or I'm gonna send you to New England. I'm gonna send you to Indy. Like, oh man. Damn. Listen, wouldn't nobody have a problem coming to Cincinnati right now. I'm just telling what I play. I ain't playing right now, Ocho I'm just telling what we they used to, to say. Are You talking about back then? Are you, are you talking about the past? Yeah. Oh, well, I mean that, that's, that's long gone. It's, it's, listen, Mike Brown, the Black Burns, the family, duke Tobin, they have turned the culture in that city around that franchise. They turned it around and it all started, it all started with one quarterback.


It's amazing what a quarterback can do for you. For sure. His name, his name is Joe. His name is Joe Blonde Burrow. Well you see what, what you call 'em Peyton, they got a new stadium in Indy, Peyton Manning. We see what Tom Brady, he quadrupled the worth, the value of the Patriots. Oh, oh yeah. You see what Kansas City did with, with with my homeboy? Yeah. Oh yeah. Hey man, listen boy. Yeah. You damn right. You damn right. A quarterback could change your fortune. Yeah. Just like a great, you see what LeBron did in Cleveland? Yeah. You see what Steph did? And Steph did In in the bay. In in, in the Bay. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Crazy man. Absolutely. Shoot. See what OCHO did in Cincinnati.


My bad. My bad Nigga With Cincinnati Jamar Chase is reportedly tracking towards playing on Sunday against New England. Cincinnati continues negotiation with Chase side to get a contract extension done. He practiced today and yesterday with Cincinnati getting more sessions tomorrow. What do you think will happen here, Ocho? Will we see Jamar on the field on Sunday? Listen, this is, it's tough. It's tough on Jamar. It's tough on me as a fan of Jamar.


It's tough on me as a, a fan of the Bengals offense. It's tough on me as a fan of the, the Bengals in general because I understand the importance of Jamar and understand the importance of Jamar being a part of our offense for us to have consistent success and have a different outcome at the beginning, be beginning of the season. We normally, we normally start the season slow. You know, we always start out the gate, oh, and one, oh and two. And I think for us, I think we need to hit the ground running with a little different approach this year and probably, probably try to start the season fast and get, get a look, get a few wins under our belt as opposed to trying to dig ourselves out a hole.


I think it'd be imperative that a deal gets done for Chase, but I think he doesn't touch the field unless it is done. Because It would be foolish for him to play. Now Ocho he's in, he is a now, you know, back in the day, if you held out the team could, could forgive that, those, those fines. Right? The team can't forgive those now. Yeah. The rookie fi the rookie on on under the current CBA on your rookie contract. If the time that you do miss in season, they can you get you, you're for forgiven for those fines. If I'm not mistaken. I Don't think so. Ocho I don't think fines can be forgiven now. I think that was the new rule in the CBA. Nah. On, look it up, Ash. Can fines be forgiven? Unc, listen, listen, can I, can I say something real quick?


Yeah, go ahead. Jamar Chase right now is top three receiving the NFL unc. Justin Jefferson has gotten paid cd, lamb has gotten paid. AJ Brown, Devonte Smith, Jalen Waddle, Tyreek Hill, he is a tier one receiver and out of the tier one receivers, he's the only one that's gotten paid. So just listen to me real quick. Chad Rookie can, so yeah, he's, he's a rookie. Yeah. So listen to me. You want him to come back. Everybody's saying, oh, he has two years on his deal, okay, you want him to come back, he's playing as a top three player, but you wanna pay him on a rookie contract, but you want the production that he's going to provide you to be that of a tier one receiver.


Sure, for sure. No, no, No, no, no, no, no, no. That, that's not the way business works. That's not the way business works. Now I'm all about doing things in good faith because if you're paying someone as a top player, but they're not performing at a top level, what's the first thing they do to you, UNC? Oh, we already know it's one-sided. They gonna get your ass up outta there. They gonna get you up outta there. Or they gonna call you to the office and say, you know what? Your production is not what it once was. We need you to take a pay cut. Yeah. And, but here's the thing, Ojo in the process of taking that pay cut, now we going take your money. We gonna take 50, 60% of your money, but we still need you to make those plays. Like when we gave you the contract, Shit, child, please pay me Rookie Fines can't be forgiven.


Ojo. See, told I told you, I told you. But listen, I'm, I'm hoping, I'm hoping Unc they waited till the last minute with Joe Burrow. I'm hoping, I'm hoping for the sake of my sanity, for my sanity, I hope a deal gets done. If it doesn't get done, I believe, I believe in T Higgins. T Higgins. The problem Is, I I been, I've been, I've been saying this since day one. T Higgins is a number one receiver, which is why when he hits the market next year, he finna get a bag. But here's the thing though, Ocho, you need both of your number ones because it doesn't do you any good to just have one.


Yeah. But oh listen, we have great depth now. We have great death. We have great, Ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody Chase, I as great as t Higgins is, he ain't Chase. They're completely, they're two completely different type. He ain't chased. He can be different, but he ain't chased. Hold on. I don't like the way you talk about my, my dog now I unbelievable.

You saying T Higgins better than Cooper Cup. Hey, like we, we've been, we've been friend for 37 years. I don't want that friendship to end about you talking about T Higgins like that. Unc, I didn't say T Higg better, but he ain't better than Cooper Cup. Okay. They two completely different type of receivers. Tgg. Oh. Oh. All the guys are different type of receiver. Right.


So we don't get to use that type. Oh, that different type of receiver on, is he, does he play the receiver position, yes or no? Yeah, he good at it too boy. Okay. Okay. He good at it. Cooper Cup. Cooper Cup. Okay. You say Tyreek? Chase, Jefferson, cd aj Devonte St. Brown. Hey, ah, got Cooper, Aman Rob, he nice too, boy. Amman, Ross St. Brown. He nice.

You gonna understand that during this season, I, I'm not saying what he is not gonna be after the season. I'm saying right now. No, I'm saying what he is right now.

So we still got Waddle, we got Devonte Smith. So I, I think, I think somewhere like top 15. But I don't know if he cracking the top 10 ocho. I don't honestly. Hey, You know what, this is why I don't like numbers. I don't want, I don't like anything having to do with the number system and ranking players when they all good in their own. Right now you have a, you have the tier one. You got them tier one dudes that are special that can go to any team. Oh, I got what? Lemme finish. What about Mike Evans?

But we ain't gonna talk about it so we gonna move up Pro Football focus.


Nah, listen, I ain't, you know what, I like pro football focus so I ain't gonna say nothing bad about them. I ain't gonna say nothing bad about them, but everybody has a difference of where you go. Oh, where you going? I was just over here looking. Alright, go ahead. Hey anyway, anyway. Chad, listen that's a tough, that's a tough conversation obviously.

Now it's time for our new segment. Money Moves Sponsored by Draft Kings. Guess what we got Animation two. Hey, hey. In much in his much anticipated return charges, head coach Jim Harbaugh starts the seasons with high expectations. Harbaugh is Cole favorite at plus eight 50 to win NFL Coach of the Year at Draft King. That's tied with Chicago Barons head coach Matt Elu For the best odds to win the award coming off a national title at Michigan, odds makers are clearly buying the Jim Harbaugh. What Jim Harbaugh is selling. Ocho what's your expectations for the this season? I think the Chargers gonna look completely different than they did last year. I think they're going to look completely different than they did last year. My only issue and concerns are the weaponry that the quarterback has at his disposal. Quinn Johnson. I know you might see this. Well, I need you to show up and show out. Yeah. The inconsistencies that I've seen on film from training camp, you know, the drops. I mean all that. All that is fixable. I just need you brother to brother come out there and show out. They let Keenan Island walk, they let Mike Williams walk because you're next in line. You're next up the organization is telling you you are the man that's next in line to take over as the number one receiver. I need you to play like at week one. From that point on. That's it. But as far as, as far as Harbaugh's is concerned, everything he touched turns the goal when it comes from, from a coaching standpoint and the teams that he coaches, it turns the goal. So I expect the same thing to happen there. And I think they're gonna be fine. And normally it happens quick. Yeah, you look at San Diego, you look at when he went to Stanford, when he went to Michigan. Now he's back. I mean, even when the Chargers, you look at normally the first year, there's a drastic turnaround right away. Yeah. When John, when Jim Harbaugh takes over the program. And so I don't expect anything. He has a quarterback that can make every throw. He is a lot more athletic than you give him credit for. Now. It's gonna be interesting to see how they rather, you know, they lost Eckler. He went to the commanders. He was the guy that could do it. Everything. He could run the ball well, caught the ball extremely well out of the backfield round the goal line. He was a lot tougher runner than people gave him credit for. They got, they got some pe I I think the question is, they're defense. I'm disappointed in their defense. When you look at what they got defensively Superstars. They got Boster Durwin James, they broke his hand. So he's gonna be out. They got Durwin James. They got Khal Mack. Khalil Mack. They, you know, they got Asante Samuel Jr. Sammy Jr. They, they got talent at the Yin Yang. Oh yeah. Why y'all giving up plays like that? So I do think Harbaugh is gonna turn this team around. They're the look Kansas City's in that division we know right now, starting off its favorite. They're the favorite to win the division again. Yes. What, six, seven times. I mean, maybe eight time they won it. I think they wanted the last two years with, with Alex Smith. And you know, they won it every year since Patrick Holmes has been their starting quarterback. So, but do I, do I think the expectations, what do you think? Nine and seven? 10 and, no, excuse me, 10 and seven, nine and eight. What do, what, what, what do you think the record could be? I Think I like, I like 10 and seven more. I go go north in the direction to 10 at seven. Okay. Simply because they have a quarterback. Simply because they have a quarterback. And anytime you have a quarterback, you have a chance at winning, winning more than goddamn eight or seven games. So yeah. NFL week one, it is finally here.

I'm just telling you, if I was in Chad, Chad, Chad, am I am am I outta line here? I'm like, I mean, I'm trying to figure this out. So hold on. When did Harbaugh get the job? When did Harbaugh get the job at? At, at, at, at, said, at, at the Chargers. Because maybe it's me. Maybe it's, maybe it's me. Maybe it's me. Maybe it's me guys. Because, you know, sometimes I have a, I have a, sometimes I have a propensity. Right. He got Harbaugh got a job January 24th. When was Sherrone Moore named head coach at Michigan?


He was named head coach. January 26th. January 26th. February, March, April, may, June, July, August. Here we are. September. So we've had eight months. Okay. You know who else doesn't have a contract that is deserving for the work he's put in and going to put in Jamar? Chase? Jamar. Chase has a contract. Ocho not enough. He got two years left on the contract. He signed not enough. That's not comparable. It's not enough. No ocho But you, he he doesn't have a contract. He actually does have a contract. He has two years left on the contract that he signed on his rookie deal.


Sherrone Moore does not have a contract At all. At all. Period. Okay. That was no contract. Alright. That was, they trying to work out terms, they're trying to come to an agreement. Right. So the man was an intern. How many games did Harvard miss? Three, four. So he missed three games. So you, you you saw him intern. Yeah. He kept the ship afloat. He was your OC called the national championship game. You won that game. You name him head coach on January the 26th. And you didn't work out a deal in February, March, April, may, June, July, August. And here we are in September. Yeah, they would do that. They didn't know what they, they, they, they've never done that.


Right. You think something else is going on that we don't know about. I don't know what's going on, but I just know the other guy. I know, I know other coaches don't get, have to go through that. Right. Weren't Okay. I don't, I don't wanna make any speculations. Maybe it's me. Maybe it's, maybe, maybe, maybe it's me. Maybe it's me. Maybe it's me. Maybe I normally, Hey, who's that? Who's that? You know who the athletic director is at Michigan? Because we could always send him a little message. I just, I just thought someone starts a job. Right? You have the agreement. Okay. Here the thing. Oh, it is already, it is already in place. Yes. Who takes a job and like, okay, here we are.


I mean whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This ain't just any job now. So let, let's, let's, let's try this. Put yourself in Mr. Moore's shoes. Yeah. If, if you are in his shoes, are you not taking the missionary job? Because a contract has not been fulfilled yet. The contract ocho the contract is worked out before you take the job. That's why you take it. Okay. But this one hasn't been worked out. Are you gonna say No, I don't want to coach for Michigan because the contract hasn't been worked out. I'm just, I'm just, I just wanna see O Ocho I'm, I'm just asking, I'm just asking. OCHO Not Gonna take the job because the contract hasn't done yet. The contract would've been done. There's first of all, the contract's gonna be done before you take the job. Who takes the job with no contract?


ocho. So you're saying you wouldn't take it Ocho the contract would've been done before you sign. If I'm just, I'm hypothetically speaking, if you were in his shoes with the opportunity that is presenting itself to coach the Michigan Wolverines and it wasn't in place, would you take it or not? You would say not because No agent, agent would never let me take a job in which the contract not contract wasn't done. Oh, Joe. Okay. Okay. That'll be like, that'll be like you said, you know what? I'm gonna get married with no prenup worked out.


We gonna work on it at a later date and time. You doing that? Me? You talking to me? Yeah. But but see my situation when you when it comes to that using, I mean for better context, ReadUP Rel says, okay, oh Joe, we gonna get mad. We gonna work out the contract, we gonna work out the prenup. You like, okay rel we can work out the prenup at a later date and time. Whatever we gonna do, we gonna work out that at a later date and time. And here we are eight months in.


So y'all been dating three and a half, four years. And so now, because Sherrone, Moore has been there for a minute. Right. He's been the oc. Right. And so now eight, eight months until your marriage Yeah. Ain't nothing been signed. Ain't nothing been settled. Yeah. That, that, that's me doing that. 'cause I'm gonna make sure if she try to leave me, I'm going, I'm leaving with half. I ain't signing this shit. That's between But I'm saying, like I said Chad. Yeah, I I get what you're saying. I get what you're saying. It just, Hey listen, it, this ain't no no regular program. This ain't just no regular job. Makes it more egregious. That's the University of Michigan. That's, and that's why, you know what, you know what I think gonna happen? I think the fact that we're talking about it, I'm sure other people are talking about it as well.


When the numbers do come across, we gonna be like, oh, now we see why it took so long. Now gonna Take ain't get dabble money. He not Finn get How, how he not Finn to get, how he not Finn get No how Ocho let's bet ain't no first year coach about to get no 12 million. Stop. Let's bet. Oh Lord. Hell, I I bet, I bet he get. No, I bet he hit double digits though. I Bet, bet he don't Bet a hundred dollars. I bet you a hundred Bet a hundred. Okay. Bet a hundred dollars. Okay. Bet, bet. And that what, what College Michigan played already, right? They played last week. Yes. And they played again, I guarantee you have a contract in place and I guarantee it it is north.


It is, it is. It is north of 9 million before week three. Ocho first of all, you said it was gonna be double digit last I checked. Nine is not double digits, but okay, I get You four. I I said north, north of what is north of 9 million. You said North you said double digits. Okay. North of 9 million it's 10. But the fact of the matter is that this is a blue blood program. Like you said, it's not so it's not some small school. Right. Right. This is a preeminent program that probably spend a hundred million, 200 million have a two a hundred plus million dollar athletic budget. Right.


And you mean to tell me you've had this man working, recruiting and he doesn't have a contract. Yeah, you're right. You're right. I, I guess listen, I mean, I see it from your point of view. I also see it from another point of view with the opportunity that, that that presents itself at hand working for this historic prestigious university knowing they're going to take care of me at some point. They don't have me. How do I know that? Why haven't they taken care of me? Because What do you mean? How do you know that? Because this ain't, you ain't this ain't seven 11. This ain't h and m. This is, this is The Univers mission. They took care of him by Now and I know they finna cut that check.


Oh, Joe, Yes sir. You I understand. I totally understand what you mean though. I I totally do. I promise you I do. I don't know why it's going on. I don't know what they're waiting on. But I'm just saying if the opportunity presented itself, if I, if I was Mr. Moore with great understanding that it might not be done now, but I know they gonna make sure I'm eight Months. Shoot. You listen, you think eight months long you let ask you a question. You think eight months long, how long you think I made? How long Just not to put my personal business out there. You know, I I ma I made Rel wait nine months before she even could get something. But that's one thing. And you think that's long. But, but hold on. There's no Difference. She had to work for that.


But, But what if, what if, what if Rel had to pay you for sex and say, well Ocho, I a I'm will pay you at eight months. Exactly. You see how you looked at Yeah, exactly. You right, right now. Now, now, now when you put it like that from a context, because I don't, I don't, I don't lay down for free. You right by there. Yeah. That's my only thing though, Ocho I'm like, okay. Normally when you like, okay, you come in for a job interview. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well how much does the job pay? Okay. What are you, what are my expectations on the job? Yeah. What's the job hours? What's the whole, what's the work schedule? Overtime. Overtime? Is that okay? Do I get health benefits? Okay.


Do I get, you know, PTO Right? I'll come in with a job. I need CTO choice time off. You know what I'm saying? No job. Ain't no p time off. I like that. I choose to take off. Right. So all those things I'm working out. Okay, Mr. Sharp, you got the job. Okay, thank you. We oh, whoa. I got a job. How much did the job pay? I understand sometimes like medical it could take 30 to 60 days before you get medical. Right? I get that. But I ain't taking no damn eight months for me to get no paycheck. Yeah, you right. I don't, I listen, I don't, I don't, I'm not familiar with these type of situations being that I've never been in a position to be a coach or work at a university like Michigan.


So I don't know what's going on. I have no idea. Maybe if I was Paul Fe Baum, I'd have a better answer for you. But I don't know. I don't know. And I, but I do think he gonna get paid and it's gonna be north of 10 million. They not gonna, they not gonna play with him. Especially waiting this goddamn loan on north of 9 million. My bad. Hell. That's what Harbaugh was making. Nah, Harbaugh was making about 13, 14. Coach Saban was the highest paid. I think Kirby is the highest paid nine at 12. Who's the highest paid in a college coach? I think Kirby at 12 because I think DA will make like 10 11.


Oh, Kirby's at 13. What is the guy at Alabama? He got about 10, right? He got 10. Yeah. Alright. ocho. Yeah. Caleb Williams hasn't made his mark in the NFL just yet, but his college legacy is submitted forever. USC announced he's getting his number 13 retired in his two years of the program. He completed 599 passes, 8,170 yards, 72 touchdowns. It is a tradition for Southern C to retire the digits of all Heisman winners.


Yeah. Speaking of Heisman winners, my former colleague at Fox Reggae Bush who recently had his Heisman reinstated and returned is getting his number five enshrined as well. Congrats. Reggae well deserved as exciting of a running back as we've ever seen in college football. Oh yeah. The NCA did the right thing. They reinstated it, returned his trophy, and USC did the right thing. What they do for all their Heisman winners Yeah. Are their jerseys. Yeah. That's dope. That's, that's really live. But what happens if you continue to have so many Heisman winners when you run outta numbers? Hey, hey, you won't get that number.


You ain't getting five. You ain't getting 13. Yeah, 13. You ain't getting 11. Wait a minute. You not getting three, you not getting 33. You're not getting 32. Carson War three. Did Mike Gary win the Heisman Carson War three, right? Carson War three. Yeah. Carson win the Heisman Charles White number 12. You ain't getting that. You ain't getting 11. That's Matt liner. You ain't getting getting 32. That's Marcus 33 is is oj. Well shit, Daniel had no goddamn numbers left for, for the damn players to play in shit. Yeah. Huh. Hey, USC had a run. Hey, that was running back. You for real? Oh yeah, because they were oj they were Mike Garrett, they with Charles White.


They were Marcus Allen. I mean like in a 10 year span. Yeah. Just straight. They had 11 year span. They had four Heisman trophy winning running backs. And then you get Carson and then you got Matt liner, then you had Reggie, now you got Caleb. Yeah. That's dope. That's loud. Yeah, that's live. I just know one thing. They, they are running outta jersey. I think certain players, certain people will go there and want to continue on the tradition of wearing their number from high school and college. I mean, USC wouldn't be a choice to go, especially with some of those single digit numbers. Players. Players like To, you could, you could ask the university and the university will ask the players. Clemson retired. Steve Fuller had the number four.


Right? Deshaun wanted that. Deshaun asked Steve Fuller, he said, I would be honored for you to wear the jersey. Oh, that's Dope. That's dope that you can do that. Now that, now that's Dope. Pey Manning did the same thing when he got to Denver. Right? I think Frank Puka war number eight 18, they took it down. If somebody wanna wear that too at Savannah State, the answer is no. Damn you gonna tell him? No, No, No, no. That is a, that is a joint that is a joint between Savannah State and Shannon Sharpe. Okay. Okay. We both have to be in agreeance. Okay. But why would you, why would you even want that pressure?


I mean, if you, that boy, listen, a lot of players are, are picking single digit numbers and most of the time when I was growing up, if you were a single digit number, you Would Oh, you would like that You are him. So if anybody's trying to do it Now, when I, in today's game, and I see, especially in college, I see players with single digit numbers and you not him and you not showing up the way you should be with that single digit on. I'm like, what are we doing? Even before, oh, Joe, that number, number two, even before they officially retired it, coach Davis wouldn't even give it out. They didn't even order the jersey. Right. They wouldn't even order it. Mackey who was the equipment manager, say, you actually think somebody gonna be worthy.


They're wearing that jersey. He said, long as I'm here, I'll, there'll never be a number two. Right. I think the le the year after I left, somebody took a picture in it. It imagine like, how the hell you get that jersey? He ain't never. So there's only one picture with somebody in number two after, after 1989. Right? I went from 80, 89 after that outta circulation. And then when they retired it. Yeah. Oh no. That's it. No, IIII don't even, well, first of all, my son would've never, he don't, he didn't, he wouldn't, he wouldn't even wanna wear that number. He want his own number. He want his own identity. Right. And, and I understand that, but no, but it's, it, like I said, a lot of teams, like I said, Deshaun, when he went to Clemson, that number was retired.


Steve Fuller, that number was retired. Yeah. He asked him, he said yes. Peyton asked the Buka family. They said yes. Well, he gotta be Haw family. He said, no. Yeah. Is there, you gotta be somebody special coming, coming outta high school. Yeah. To, to wanna wear a single digit number, to wanna wear Caleb's number, to wanna wear Reggie Bush's number as a running back or maybe a receiver of some sort. Right. You gotta be really, really good coming out to be able to ask and get that permission from him. Because if you not, they'll probably say no Ocho check a look at this. Okay. A dad threw a fit saying this generation doesn't care about families. When a woman refused to switch seats with him on the plane, Ocho, let's watch the video.


Uhoh A woman who paid $40 an extra for her specific seat on a flight, had a dad try to guilt trip her into switching seats. So this woman named Riley says she always pays extra to have a specific seat on this flight. She'd upgraded to a window seat near the front of the plane while she was settling in. She saw a couple walk over with two kids that were between about the ages of five and 10 years old. She felt someone grab her shoulder and it was the dad in the family. He had learned that no one was sitting in the middle seat of the row behind Riley. That dad then demanded that ri moved to the middle seat in the row behind her so that the family could all sit together. But her real concern was that she didn't want to sit between two people, especially after she'd paid extra for the right not to because he had the audacity.


This made the dad even more upset. And he went on a rant about how this generation just doesn't care about families. Ri tuned him out and refused to move. Oh, I can see both. I can see both. I can see both parts. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Stay with me. Stay with me. Now I can see both parts about wanting to sit with your family. I under I understand that. I understand that now, depending on who you act, depending on how you ask the individual, especially a father that wanting to sit with his kids. I get it. I get that part that there's certain people that would move, even if there were certain people that would move just so someone could sit with their family. Because I've done it before. Huh? I've done it before. That's, that's why. But Lemme ask question both sides. Have you moved to a worst seat?


She got a window seat and gotta go sit between two people. Well, if you wanted to sit with your family so bad, book the ticket in advance. Yeah. And buy the role. Yeah. I I now that I don't like his approach, I don't, I don't like his approach to, to the way he asked. And I'm sure he probably didn't ask in a manner and would, he would've thought, you know what, let me move, even though I have to sit between two people because he's with his kids. Got I'm, I'm sure, I'm sure I'm, I'm sure it was probably rude, so Hold on. So you want me to be uncomfortable for the left of the flight so I can accommodate a family? Hey, you know, listen, some, some people with it, some people ain't.


I, I, I, I, I Kind of see both sides. Joe, check this Out. I kind of, I kind of see both sides though because I, I I've moved on a few flights for families before. But I tell you what, you float, you okay? A man sitting with his, a man sitting, his wife is in first class. Yes sir. He's in coach. He comes and he comes, you sitting by his wife at first class. He said, Ocho, this is my wife. You mind if I see her? I'm in 24 f He wanna sit with his family. Hold On. Are you tripping? You do realize I fly on spirit. I always sit that Do always fly. Ocho ocho stop because I booked some flights. Okay. So for me anyway. Yes. Anyway, anyway. I was saying That's that's, that's Different.


I was, no, nope. That's not what you saying. People want to sit with their family. I'm asking you a guy, his coach, right? You in first class, his wife is sitting next to you. Right. He says he wants to sit with his wife. Right. Right. You giving up your first class ticket to go back and coach? Yes or no? Yeah. I probably would. Man, stop it. I would. I I mean that, that's just, that's just me. I'm just saying, I I would, especially if he got a window seat, I don't care. I would you let the man sit with his wife. He shoulda have bought that seat. If he wanted to sit with his wife. Well, Ocho you, you bought Late. Chad, Chad, lemme ask you this.


How many people purchased a first class ticket? Gonna be willing to give that ticket up to go sit in coach so somebody in coach can come sit by a family member? Really? I mean, based on the scenario you just gave me sitting the next You wanna sit with his wife? Yeah, I probably would probably moved. I Well, best luck To you that, that just me. Once I got my earphones and I, and I got my phone and the wifi connected, I don't give a fuck where I'm sitting at. I'm not giving listen. Nor the ro the protocol, the normal rule of thumb, in order to get somebody to move, you need to give them a comparable seat or a better seat. You don't ask someone to move from a window or aisle to a middle seat.


Right. Right, right, right, Right. You don't ask someone to move first class to coach. Right. Now, I'm not saying, hey, if that's what they wanna do, but to say, yeah, hey, I know you paid. I know what y'all know what first class tickets cost. Oh, Hey, can you, I wanna sit next to my wife. Well, you should have bought the ticket. Ooh, but I bought this one and I ain't moving. Oh, that's rude, man. You see how you just said that? You see, you see how you just like, I'm gonna say it just like that. If you think I'm about to get my black ass up and I know what I pay for first class tickets. If you think I'm about to get my black ass up and give up my first class seat to go city and coach, bro, do you know how long it's been since I have missed a flight?


Because the flight, it's like, Mr. Sharp, we have no more first class, but we can get you on this flight and coach. I said, what time? The next flight leave says leaving in two hours. I said, I'll be right over here in the corner. I'll be right over at the corner. I'm not doing it. Oh man, I was y Bank bro. The first class tickets would be two and $3,000 from here to New York. And you think I'm about to give up that seat? I, because every time I get, I look, I want, I want, I want the aisle. Right. Because I look McKinney's bad. Right? Right. So I gotta go to the bathroom and I don't wanna be stepping on people. Right. I don't wanna put my ass in nobody's face and I don't wanna put my other private part in nobody's face.


Right. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm knocking juice down the water. They, they folding the table up. I don't wanna do that. So I just get my black ass up and go to the bathroom. 'cause I got a window seat. I don't do bulkhead. Right. Yeah. You, you ain't got no leg room. Nah, hell no. Yeah. But, and, and when, when I think about it, I, and, and I mean you, you know me personally and if you're in the chat, if you follow me throughout the years, just in general, you know how I am. You know, I've, I live a very, very simplistic lifestyle. I don't, I don't really, really care much about, especially, especially in this, in this scenario, in this case, you know, like I honestly, unc all bullshit aside knowing me, I would probably move just knowing me.


Especially on the, the scenario that you just gave me. Not the one we talked about originally on why we talking about the topic. It's about the wife and dude sitting in Coke. Listen, unc, when I'm on bought the Ticket, If I got, if I got wifi and my phone working, I got my headphones, I'm good. Nah, I'm good. Give me a gimme what I paid for this seat, right? I brought the seat to seat was 3000 break bread. Damn. Three th Go look up a first class flight on Delta from LA to, to New York. Look it up, Google it and see what it costs. It. It is high. It must've been a holiday. Go look it up and see what it costs.


So that's what he gonna have to come out his pocket with right there. And I still ain't moving. He knew when he got his ass on that fight. He wasn't sitting next to his wife. Yeah, he, they gonna try to guilt trip you. Hey, excuse me buddy. You know my wife is up there. Okay Ann, I'm gonna keep a company for you. What's her name? Betty. Hey Betty. How you doing Sam? Back there. Hey, I tell you what, how about this here, how about Betty? Get her ass up and go sit back there And let the person And let somebody sit next To me. Come, man. That's, that's a good One about That. That's a good, that's a good, that's a good scenario. That's a good scenario. And I Wish y would by Damn please.


That's a good scenario Now. No, I ain't doing it. Y'all know good and well y'all wasn't sitting and had a thing Ocho. They do good. Well they wasn't sitting together when they got their ass on the plane. Yeah, I mean listen, I may maybe they bought the tickets in a way where it wasn't as expensive. They they found a way to finagle the system. Yeah, they bought Tickets and did they gonna try to finagle me? Yeah. Ain't gonna happen. Yeah, that's probably what they did. So is I, I Want all my snacks because when they come around with the hot food, Betty go, she gonna be y he goes she gonna be getting my plate. Oh no I ordered a ravioli or the breakfast, whatever, whatever.

Alright. Hey guys, it's Matt Jones, drew Franklin from the Fade. This podcast, we got a great episode coming up. Picks in all the sports, football, basketball. We do 'em all. But here's a preview of this week's episode. We'll start with the Big 10. And I would like to start with this thought for you Drew. There are 18 teams in the Big 10. Okay? Do you think we can get an agreement but amongst these conferences to have the number next to their team conference be the number of teams in. Here's my suggestion. The Big 10 is allowed to be the big 18 and then the Big 12 just has to pick something else like Happy League.


One of 'em used a Roman numeral one used number 18, no Big 12 first of all. 'cause they're worse. They just have to pick something else. You know, I don't know God's plan. I don't care. I would love to watch the God's Plan championship. I don't care what it is, but I do not like that. Neither the Big 10 nor the 12 Big 12 have the correct number next their teams. That's confusing. Children would look at that and go, this is stupid. So I think they need to change it.

Love y'all Uncle Ocho all shout out to all night capitalists. Yes. That game was unbelievable. Like I said, if the regular season is anything like the first game. Yeah, it came, it was very suspenseful. Suspenseful came down to the final play of the game. I just read that, that Lamar said he thinks that was a touchdown. Lamar, that wasn't a touchdown bro. His feet was out, his foot was out of bounds. It was outta bound. I I get it. Yeah, you get that close.

It's gonna be perfect. 'cause I'm on the road, I'm on the road now to the end of the month. I'm on the road to the end of the month. So when I come back at the end of that road, like boys, the men I need to try, I need to try with 'em Sparks. Now You got the neighbors? Nah, nah, they can't. They nah ain't they ain't? Yeah okay. Nah, they ain't gonna be deal Man. They real, they the real deal Ocho they real, real.


They, they, we, we gonna See what the hype about now, boy. They, hey Boy they get butter from a dunk. They get butter from a dunk, you know. Hey. Yeah man, Zach in say Uncle Nocha, y'all keep it real. So let's talk about this Rashe Rice playing the game that called Baltimore non calls for Kansas City by the ref. The illegal timeout that the chief DC is it, it not obvious the fix we're in for Kansas City Fix. I didn't what fix Man. Oh God fix. Right. Nah man, I take the thing look Only, only thing I ain't like, I mean just I'm gonna get it, get it off.


I understand. I understand what he, what he talking about. There was no fix. There is no goddamn fix. Not what I didn't like at the beginning of the game. The refs making it about them. Now uncle, you, you gave me a better explanation on why you felt the tackles being set back a little bit further was an advantage for them. Okay, I understand that now. I thought, you know, being a little closer would would be better for them. But you with your explanation it lets me know that it wasn't. Yeah. Now that got, that irritated me a lot. A a lot. It really irritated me 'cause it felt like the rest were making the game about them. Now outside of that it was a good game. You know, just nitpicking at all the other stuff and timeouts and all this other stuff. Yeah, that's, that's but but go ahead and make your point.


Yeah. You know what we gonna come out with a a a a Nightcap starter pack, two sparks grip socks, chapstick. I like that. You know how that don't you Especially, hey especially them grip boy we, hey listen, if we get some Nightcap grip socks, boy that's gonna be funny. Woo Woo. That's gonna be funny. Wear em them grip socks where you understand. Chad, what y'all thinking? We came out with some Nightcap boxers. B bri Bri are boxers.


You were Bri I ain't got no, I ain't got no choice. Well We used to call, I don't know what they used to call 'em, but we used to call 'em jockey shorts. Well, Reese's, that's the same thing. Jockey shorts. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But I, I wear like, I wear like when I of boxes, I think I wear like compressions. I wear like compressions. That's what I'm talking about. When I think boxes, I think of like the plaid boxes we used to get back in the days from the, from the, from the gas station. Oh, the kind I got on right now. Yeah, them, them days over, man we used to, we used to wear a pair of shorts under your jeans to go to go to school. Yeah man. I had a, I had a used to play.


He, he used to play in fruit of the the Yeah, we gonna get that. We get that night count starter. Emmanuel a Abe wasn't feeling the officiating tonight. I felt there were too many illegal formation calls against the Ravens. Thank you. And too little against the Chiefs. Look, I I think normally the first game is really penalized. Yeah. Because the teams are trying to figure out what they can get away with. So now what we would do is like when I tackle it back up up, that means I had to back up because we didn't want it to look so obvious because see Ocho I like to crowd the bone.


Yeah. I'm trying to crowd it Much, But trying To back up as as much as you can. Yes. So I get it. I I think you look, you go back to the drawing board spec whatever the, whatever the offense, whatever the case may be, he says, okay, let's back, let's let's back it up a little bit. Hey, wide receivers tight end. Help us out. Maybe y'all don't crowd so much. So it doesn't become so obvious right. That the tackle is so far back. So you just, you just play with it because you look, I don't wanna get penalized, but I wanna see how far I can push the envelope because I'm trying to gain a competitive advantage because as a defensive player, what they try to do, they try to crowd the ball.


Yeah. So my job is to like, I'm gonna try to look, it doesn't do me no good to crowd the ball and get a catch when they're gonna call it back for illegal formation Every time. I would rather be a little step and slow off the ball and somebody catch it. And, we get the play to go as opposed to crowding it and then we get an illegal formation and it is coming back. Right. Illegal ship illegal. No, No. So Emo said, Hey unc, congratulations on everything you'll know you are doing my questions on the Ravens chief game tonight. Isaiah stopped in the end zone when Lamar threw It seems like miscommunication.


What do you think? Ah, 'cause he doesn't know. He doesn't know if the safety is coming. See, the safety was supposed to come, he stopped. He gotta keep going. But Zay doesn't know that. Zay doesn't know. Oh, he stopped. So let me stop. Yeah, no, he's trying to, I'm running free. I've never assumed that the guy stopped. Yeah. Yeah. So No, no he did Zay did the right thing. Lamar just look, they'll do a better job of communicating. But that's what happens. I mean, it, it is a game. It's full speed. He doesn't know the guy is, he's gonna sit down in the zone because he six stop. You see him, he stopped. He, he just stopped. Just stopped.


And I don't know why he stopped because the guy crossed his face. You gotta run through that. Yeah Man, that, But no, I don't think he, I I don't think he should have stopped Uhuh. Dre Max said if the chief defense legit. Yes. Yeah. They're very good still Nice. They're very good still nice. Even Everybody gonna be able to do like Lamar Now you, first of all, how many quarterbacks can go run, get 15, 16 carries and run for a buck 22? How many quarterbacks gonna be able to make the throw that he made the likely make the throw that he made to abatement up the sideline? They ain't very many quarterbacks. They make the hell. Yeah, they good. Very good.


It's tough to play a guy like Lamar Ocho obvious Ocho because the thing is, is that your instinct says go get the quarterback. Uhuh Don't do that. But if he run past him, he gonna jump out the window. Yeah. And you see even the second time Chris Jones, he bull the running back, but he went up the edge should have pulled straight through it because the last thing I wanna do is give Lamar, Lamar cre Yeah. Me on that last play. I'm gonna bless him because the last thing I want him to do is to buy time, Make him uncomfortable. I'm gonna make him make a, I'm gonna make him make a decision Instantaneous. Yeah. Make him uncomfortable. I gotta, yeah.


Yeah, Because you see what happens when you let him buy time, he gonna buy time. He gonna, somebody gonna run around them guy gonna keep running around and boom, almost had a chance to, you know, score a touchdown and get a two point conversion. But no, the chiefs defense are legit. Matthew Coughlin says Chief Aholic was using money he robbed to bet on games. I'm a KC fan and live in kc follow the news quite a bit. He was betting on the game. I guess he was traveling, probably traveling to the games also Ocho See, told you, I told you he wasn't spending no money on nothing crazy. It was gonna be something simple. Betting ain't simple Ocho I mean, you know what I mean? When other, when most people steal money from banks, they go do wild luxurious stuff like Yeah.


You know, you know what I'm trying to say? Yeah, You wouldn't, you wouldn't What would you have done with the money? If, if I, if I was, if I was a bank robber? Yeah, Shoot, I keep living the same life I'm living right now, but there will be signs. Yeah, but what the hell you robbing the Bates for? If you going to keep living the same lifestyle? I mean well I was making millions and millions of dollars and still living the same lifestyle. I never changed still to this point. Yeah. I mean, nah, you liberty, You're in Liberty City. Miami ain't Liberty City. You only live in Liberty City. No, I don't. I I ain't too far. Yeah, you far, you far.


That's a, that's a whole side of town. Yeah. Hey, you know what's funny when you think about it though, when you think about the word Liberty City, I think it's a whole different side of town. Everything is gentrified now, man. Yeah, for Sure. Every, everything is gentrified. Yeah. It ain't the same. They charge you arm and the leg to get that property. Boy, they probably bought them old houses over there for like three. They probably gave them people like three, $400,000. Yeah. And now them houses, they ain't gonna charge people two, $3 million for those same, those same houses. Yeah. It's different man. It's like that everywhere too. Kera Norwood Jr. Asked who will lead the league in rushing in 20 24, 20 25 season Ocho.


Who you got C Mac? You think so? Yeah. Yeah. Most definitely. Most definitely. I think because Derrick, Henry and Lamar are going to gonna be splitting. I I hate using this word saying splitting the carries, but I'm just saying it's just what, it's just the, the build of the offense. I think Cmac Cmac will have more opportunities and have Yeah. Cmac. I mean I would say say I I Sayquan would be a good choice as well. Take some of that pressure off. Jalen hurts. Yeah. Sayquan would be, and and Sequan is special man. I still don't understand how the damn giants let him go.


That's that, that, that was weird. What about, what's the guy in in Indy? Oh, Jonathan Taylor. Yeah. That's a good, that's a good choice. Well, hell, if that's the case then Brie Hall is a good choice too. Yeah. Good. Jonathan Taylor and Brie Hawker hit their head off the goal post from anywhere on the field. Right. But see I think the thing is is that you still have a young quarterback, so he's gonna probably get a lot, a little more carries than Brie haw. Ah, that's right. But, but I do but I do understand and I like the direction that you were heading in Yeah. To get The ball. Taylor Robert is that's a good one. Go ahead. No, I was just saying to get the ball outta Anthony Richards' hands. Kevin Roberts, hey Uncle Ocho, not all players have legacies.


What accomplishments are required to be considered a legacy player? Who are some of the fringe legacy players playing now? Is Ocho is Sterling much love. I that's, that's a you question. I mean it definitely helps if you won, if you are a good player on a championship team, they'll never forget you. Mm. They'll never forget your ocho Even though our offense wasn't that great and, and in Baltimore we won a Super Bowl, but we still gonna be special.


Especially the guys that they know. I mean obviously they're gonna make Joe Jo because Jr's in the Hall of Fame. He's one of the greatest left tackles and one of the greatest offensive lineman to ever play. But guys like myself and Jamal and Trent Cadre, Jermaine guys that they like recognize. But then you go to that defense and everybody on the defense is Yeah. Is over there. They they know everybody. They know everybody GOs and, and, and Sam and Rob and McQueary and Pete and Suge and, and and Jamie Su I mean Woody McAllister, they, they, I I mean when you deal with, it's kind of like the steel curtain.


You know everybody on the steel curtain, you know everybody on Legion of Boom. Yeah. You, you, you, you know it Ocho the greatest greatest show on turf, you know Warner, you know Oz, Isaac King and Tory Ho, Isaac Bruce and Reverend Knight. Yeah, Marshall. Yeah. It, I i I think it, it, it varies for, for for team to team player to player. But when you play well in a city that, that that breeds foot breathe. The live sleep football like I did in Denver Avalanche have won Stanley Cubs.


The Nuggets have not won. They say Bronco country for reason. Now it'd be tough in Boston because you got the Red Sox, you got the Bruins, you got the Celtics And the Patriots And, and all those won a lot before the Patriots started winning. Now the Patriots won the most recent, well obviously the Celtics just won the championship but so it is hard. You got to win. Hey, you ain't gonna just be no joke. No you got to win in Boston. You got to win in a lot.


That's why they love big Poppy Bird Brady. Yeah. Bobby or you gotta win Boston. You play just like New York, Yankees, giants. They had the Islanders, the Rangers. You gotta win. You win, you win. Willie e said I need Nightcap live and tablet so I can beat Ocho and fellow like I did as used to. I love you guys. Thanks for inspiring me. My generation dinner on me and my wife. Next time y'all in town appreciate it. Willie.


Willie got lucky boy. He did Easy air questions. Nah, don't do that Ocho. Nah, they was too easy man. You told me Guys, go ahead. Go ahead Ocho. What you gonna say? You Tried it? I think you tried. I forgot the word. You had me try and spell man against Willie man. Damn Man. Ocho the man won man. Beat your fair and square Ocho. I was hurting with the words man.
