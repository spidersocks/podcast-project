10:
Good morning. Happy Wednesday. It's five 20 In The Morning. Your favorite sports show. I'm your host. My name is DJ Wells. We got a packed house this morning. We got Bishop. We got Nacho. Five 20 Mook fellas. Good morning. How y'all doing? What's up my boy? What's happening? What up? Come on man. The play end. Set the tone last night. Before we go there man, let's talk about some updates around the sports world. Man. We've been paying close attention to this man, Tennessee quarterback. Yo Niko, enter the portal. It's looking like right now. It ain't looking as as, as as sweet as we thought it was gonna be. I know you had talked about stay where, You know what I said where the love is at and play for the love of the game. Yeah, it was reported he was trying to double up Right now it look like his value has decreased unfortunately.

10:
Man, I told y'all and I see it bro. It's crazy to see this unfold. I know. Not something we wanted to be right about but this this is a very interesting case to watch for sure. I ain't wasn't he supposed to get 2 million from them? Yeah, I ain't gonna get that. Yeah, they said that that now it is being reevaluated at 1 million. I'm who? Who counts as the reevaluation process. Oh the other teams that didn't want you

11:
Please learn from this kid.

10:
So you trying to go back to Tennessee? No, he's in the portal. I, I don't, I don't know if that's on the table at all but I know that You know UNC was one of the teams that was looking for him to go to. But they said we cool. Yeah. Damn.

11:
Please learn from this bro. This is something for the youth to learn from. You want

10:
4 million better be Tom Brady bro. His family done played himself. Yeah I heard it was his Pops was trying to kind of force the issue behind the, You know behind the scenes

11:
That to always

10:
Bread and he done played himself. I knew that was gonna happen though. You gotta understand these coaches stick together. They got a fraternity basically. You know they got a coach in what you wanna call it? You said a fraternity? Yeah, but they gonna look out for each other before they look out anything. Like they wanna win but they ain't gonna let you play them like because they like if we let you do this y'all gonna start Whiling. Yeah the all y'all gonna break loose.

11:
Yeah that yeah.

10:
I let the Tennessee quarterback lead in the middle while we doing preseason workouts. He leave and go get 4 million Miami quarterback's leaving. Yeah it's up. Yeah it is just gonna start a free for all. So they made an example outta him. That's sad 'cause he was a talented player but his career damn near over. He took that two s bro. He was

11:
Good. This was more than enough bro. He was

10:
Good bro.

11:
For real.

10:
Now he gonna be known as the player. Everybody, he gonna be the example for the rest of his life.

11:
That's what I'm saying. Yeah,

10:
Yeah. In college you grown bro. You gotta tell your dad, hey this is my life bro. Relax bro.

11:
Bro I got more paper than you bro. Chill out. It's two ams bro. The bigger man

10:
Kind of money bro. You don't know how to deal with this bro. Chill out. Yeah, you can't tell your pops I got more bread than you. That's crazy. I even though it's, I would've said bro you gotta chill about mama.

11:
My would've said that bro. I'm taking care of mama now. This is my house nigga you take the trash out

10:
Nigga ain't nigga this is my daddy house. Disrespectful

11:
Like that bro.

10:
Nah, the example for how you fumble the back like Maurice Clat was the example trying to leave school before you could. Yeah and his NFL career was non-existent. Now this dude gonna have the same thing. Not saying he can't bounce back. Yeah he a quality player so somebody gonna pick him up. Yeah but this is the way to lose the back is how you lose the back. Right. Yeah they get to set his market now for real. Yeah, reportedly he's in the do not contact phase in the portal and typically that means, You know what I'm saying, he got some teams he's probably lined up with but I would be very interested to see that final number. Obviously we wish him the best but man we don't want anybody to be an example of this but this is definitely an example of how the portal can get wicked For sure in the situation. Go

11:
Somewhere and kill. Hopefully you go somewhere and kill. He probably.

10:
Yeah obviously

11:
Big target on your back though. Yeah, yeah. You know what I mean?

10:
But now you going to another competition 'cause everybody had a starting quarterback and you was Tennessee starting court. You gonna have

11:
To overplay. Yeah

10:
You gonna have to come in and win a job again and shit. Everybody ain't going bro. You know what I mean? And some of them deals we as we've been seeing definitely have stipulations which is kind of crazy. You gonna start seeing those incentives getting heavier though. Like you said them coaches, they not trying to lose their job for people playing bro. Yeah, most definitely. Also moving on, we talked about David Griffin, the GM for the Cuss. Who's his job? He's replaced by Joe Dumars up. Boy Joe, keep a job. Come on man. Joe keep a bag. Dumars. I think his first order of service in that team, I think they brought him in to do what they, they were scared to do beforehand. Tommy Clean house right Zion? Yep. What's up? Where y'all wanna see him at? Where y'all think he Zion would be good at?

10:
Man I've seen a lot of, I've seen a lot of good scenarios. I saw one that Minnesota, I liked Minnesota. I like that. I don't like that. Oh I like a Zion. That's too much controversy off the court bro. Real Blues

11:
Brothers.

10:
You talking about Shaq and Kobe?

11:
The real new Shaq and Kobe Now that

10:
Sha Kobe for real. Oh in the court they gonna get it done. They gonna have a highlight tape boy. They gonna be dunking niggas.

11:
I'd rather go see him play with Ja before an

10:
Oh you see him in Memphis? Yeah that'll be fire too. For who though? You ain't trained Jaron Jackson for that? Nah

11:
Shit I it shouldn't me

10:
Y y'all shitting me Jaron Jackson play. Most definitely but I don't Z ain't gonna get to rebounds. Zion don't play. Yeah, Zion's six five bro. Yeah bro. This shit is almost over for Zion. Like three more years. I'm still 25 or eight bro. Yeah bro he is fat and short but we gotta see him play a whole season is 25 and eight is like he red shirt this year. Mo he red shirt every year bro.

11:
Jar Jackson average 22 and five bro.

10:
That's good. Gotta design plays.

11:
He's seven five. He

10:
The second option he done play

11:
12 6 5 and my numbers is better than yours.

10:
He the second option bro.

11:
I played, I'm gonna be the second option you he play my numbers. I'm gonna have numbers

10:
That probably 80% of the games this year y'all gonna say Most definitely. Yeah his availability is definitely his best thing too. Y'all know

11:
Triple J is is my guy but 24 7 5 on 56% sure

10:
That's the number one option. Swap he's number one option though. Swap seven rebounds ain't just jumping off the screen like

11:
Send send back regular

10:
Average seven rebound is regular bro. And You know why he only average seven because him and K cut him the same height. He's six five bro. Six five or six five however you wanna put it. Nah

11:
Bro.

10:
Okay so let's not that team any other teams I think Zion will go in and make a immediate impact for the better. Yeah I mean any team he go to it they going yeah for sure he moves the needle for that Zion for sure. As long as he healthy. I don't even know who he really can get traded to that. He really move the needle like that though. If the Hornet sunk hit no more pick it's time to portray for Zion. Nah, Lalo and Zion let's go. Ah yeah crash out.

11:
Yeah. Oh we making the playoffs. Getz

10:
Miami Super chat cruise line three 40 said Zion to Miami. Let the godfather, the NBA get him together, we need him. That would not work. I don't hate that bro. Boy you see the problem he had now with Ben you trying to leave him to Miami. He would hate every second of that bro. Right. It not even a problem with nah it don't work. He don't wanna be around Pat Riley bro. He's like this is too much bro. Hey I'm not even worried about Pat Riley, it's Miami. I'm worried about Zion. Nah nah bro you can't even do nothing in Miami. You can't eat bro. He would let bro eat cookies bro. Zion needs some cookies bro. Come on. Yeah

11:
Zion gonna crash out.

10:
He gonna crash out bro. Cruising my dog. He hey he you piped up gang. Hey man, shout to man you crew. Hey you, you five 20 family bro. You man gonna

11:
Start calling Ethnicity bro.

10:
Tap tap in every morning man.

11:
What's your bloodline? You

10:
Got one free question a week man. For sure man. But listen man played back. What's crazy last night we covered a hell of a game last night man. Warriors Grizzlies came down to the in man. 1 21, 1 26 Victory. Jimmy Butler play off Jimmy Return baby 38, 7 and six. Stefan crazy as well with 37 8 and four D Van Hooped out with 30 and six. Ja had 22 and Triple J had 18, six and four. Man, let's just start straight to it man. Jimmy Buter man we was wondering if he was gonna see you play off Jimmy. Yes, he's here. This was what we've been waiting

11:
He was gonna kill.

10:
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what was going on with the matchups yesterday but Zack Ededie guard and Jimmy Buter was absolutely disgusting. Let's just start there. But I was

11:
A best option bro. I told y'all it was dope on a team that could guard him. So Zach

10:
Knew what should he was the best option

11:
I guess they sucked. They in the N NBA A that coach shit. Zack

10:
Lock is 40 Taylor tickets would never what? Hell nah. I thought they should have put Triple J on him but yeah that was me. Anything other than Zack, I they can't move bro. The

11:
Thing Zack can't

10:
Move but thing about Zack Ed, he can't guard nobody because they play small ball and Draymond is a screen setter for Steph. Yeah. So he run up and set pick and roll Zack Ed gonna be back. Steph gonna be lagging. Threes up. Well take a page outta Steve Cur book. You can't play today bro. You can't guard nobody. Mm. And you not he had 17 rebounds but you're not scoring enough bro. Just take him out bro. Yeah he shot less than 50% yesterday missing layups bro. Yeah. Some easy shots that he normally takes care of yesterday missing dunks. Yeah I'm like yeah take him out bro. And it's crazy 'cause he had 14 to 17 yesterday. He had 17 rebounds but he missed a lot later. He should have had 22. Yeah four 11 for the field. I would've put him on bp. Mm I get 40 bro.

10:
Shoot. Yeah but you gonna have to, let's see, I get it

11:
Jimmy Hart, I mean Jimmy Hart and that Jimmy Butler damn missed like seven, eight free

10:
No wrestling. Now look at it. Talking about Jimmy Hart. Okay going study WrestleMania. We on the, so there's

11:
Been study tables table

10:
Always been studying Jimmy Hart. Okay

11:
WrestleMania this weekend we yeah Jimmy, Jimmy Butler

10:
Six Fritos. Miss is crazy.

11:
I'm telling y'all bro. I knew. I said damn man they don't have nobody to guard and when I picked them to win I said fuck I don't have nobody to guard this nigga bro. And he's capable of 30 25. He coulda got a triple double yesterday.

10:
Yeah, yeah man he was just breaking them down yesterday. Like you said Miss six throws, it's crazy. Steph on the 13th for 13th from the free throw line Flawless Dre Ma one for five, BP went one for seven and they still got that dub yesterday. That's what I'm saying. You coulda threw him on bp. Yeah you ain't never really seen him in these moments, You know what I mean? Yeah. Like it is a do or die situation. Yeah I mean I gotta see Yeah You know I gotta see, I think if Ja and get hurt at that moment it might have been a little different because they had momentum going. Yeah I definitely agree. Ja rolling his ankle was tough. That was tough at that second. Him coming back and still contributing though was was definitely impressive for sure. Like he had a hell of a game yesterday despite the injury 50% from the field. I mean he had 22, he did what he was supposed to do yesterday.

10:
I

11:
Was just happy to see him get up. That was it.

10:
Yeah. Yeah of course John Mar's a really talented basketball player. Facts, he's starting to hit jump shots a lot now bro. Yeah starting off the game hitting threes.

11:
Yeah. Memphis is damn near mid y'all. They

10:
They mid,

11:
They mid bro. They

10:
Kind of good. Desmond Bain is cold bro.

11:
I rock. I love

10:
Mr. Consistency for that team for sure. That's what VA deserves all the respect. Five eight from three yesterday and

11:
A bull bro.

10:
He held it down. You know who they need. They need Mike Malone.

11:
Yeah okay.

10:
They need Dylan Brooks too. They had Dylan Brooks. Yeah I told y'all when they didn't sign Dylan Brooks back, it was over for the Grizzlies.

11:
Yeah you said

10:
I like that they get Mike Malone, they need Dylan Brooks back your motherhood like that Trey back for Dylan Brooks. Damn. But they need him but they need Mike Malone. Mike Malone will empower them guys. Man. I know it's a long shot but, and I tried before who is the like a three or another win they could get to help elevate this team next year. Obviously K's a hell of a long shot but like we talked about Cam Johnson or something like that, like that. What else do they need? Because I mean they got their solid players but they just need something else. They need Cam Johnson, they need Dylan Brooks. Okay. Yeah KD would be like unbelievable but they not about to get him but it is just the nigga the Brooklyn Nets told Kim Johnson too to a high standard like they want a lot for him and I don't think King's ransom.

10:
Yeah I don't know if that's gonna work. Mm. Whatever they do they gotta keep bang. I don't care bro. He's cold bro. Gotta

11:
Keep bro. Yeah he

10:
Holds the shit down. Like you said, even though throughout injuries he's one of the most consistent players they've had. For sure They need that like battery and they, they need Dylan Brooks bro. He was just like they battery and they back, he guard the best player. He would've been guarding Steph or Jimmy or whoever it was last night and he just used to give 'em that battery like I don't think they realized how much they was gonna miss 'em and you see how Houston playing. Yeah. And it is like that's what they needed. It kind of sucks because they thought Market Smart was gonna be there for them but it just wasn't a good fit. Mm. But damn And like you said he took a lot of attention away from Ja. Yeah for sure. He, he took all the all the bad energy that came to him and he still contributed.

10:
He going to play hard defense and still get you 15. Yeah. Dang. Show him big games. He gone thrive in that villain row. Ja he could beat the villain but he don't thrive in that row. Like we love Ja being the life of the party. Yeah, yeah. You know Dancing the bomb shit brought him back again. But yeah that's what we like about Ja. He do a dunk and Eric put his hands on his head and run around. We like the exciting plays and the the Fuller life. Ja you don't like the evil Ja nah. Yeah he's a superstar deserves the support. He shouldn't have deal with the scrutiny for sure. Yeah but speaking about Jimmy Butler, what's more impressive? The fact that he took offensively as far as scoring or just his playmaking ability with Steph.

10:
I mean that's Jimmy naturally he playmaker but Jimmy when he starts scoring the ball and he played for real. He's scary. I I, I put up a question last night when we was doing playback, who was scary or playoff Jimmy or Playoff Kauai and we had some mixed reviews and everybody went with Kauai so easy because he won. You got to but Jimmy man when the playoffs come around bro, nah he looking like the best player in the league bro. Playoff Jimmy is a real thing. Come on bro. From the play end to the the finals. That's elite bro. That's a real thing bro. That's why everybody deal with this shit throughout the year because they like when that time come he gonna perform bro. Yeah it is worth it. Similar to Kawa, they like Hey bro take your PT all year round because I know a you healthy in the playoffs, we know what time it is.

10:
Yeah but Kauai turned that shit into a championship so you gotta say Kaw bro. Got after. Go ahead For sure man. Playback it was a ball with that po for sure. I want to ask y'all how y'all feel about this first round matchup now that is set against the Rockets Warriors. I, I think honestly I think the Rockets gonna win. Okay. I think a lot of people need to give the rockets more respect. I don't think that they're a fluky team. I'm not saying they the best, I'm not saying they won the hardest but they had a hell of a season that I don't think it's just all acting. Yeah it's going seven. I go, I'm gonna go with the, I'm gonna lean on the young guys going seven bro. If Jalen Green do he supposed to do they they could get them out there. I I, because I was watching Golden State yesterday bro.

10:
Steph and Jimmy gotta play like that every night pretty much. Yeah. Oh absolutely got nobody else. Yeah and that's tough. Absolutely bro. They gotta at four games every night bro. Yeah. Yeah they got nobody else so I know like nobody else. Now what's up with the Jonathan Minga dps? Y'all think he gonna get some run in the playoffs or they just not rocking with him right now? I think it depends on how it go. If they need some type of scoring they might try to find him some spot. So I told y'all that when it happened. Yeah. I've been a restricted free agent. This is kind of punishment for him. Huh Bro you want take the money all sign that extension bro. Now we gonna play you, we gonna lower your value. Keep lowering it. Keep lowering it because everybody asks him why is he not playing That's weak.

10:
What did he do? He doesn't fit the scheme and when they start putting narratives out like that you can't play in this system or this way or we can't use you can't. You know what I mean? They just start lowering your value. That's weak 'cause he should be playing bro. I'm all right bro. They got a few minutes for that man bro. Yeah gotta leave

11:
Because if I would've signed the deal I'd been playing all the minutes

10:
For sure.

11:
And I'm a productive player. I that's what I don't like about the league. But you ain't never bigger than a program so I get it. But that's a lot for you not to be playing me in our, we we're mid up but

10:
I see it as he not even trying to be bigger than a program. I just think that's what I'm worth bro. Why are y'all mad at me about that? If I'm not then I'm not.

11:
I mean that sound good Mo but you kind of over your bridges when you, when you talk. I think he said like I should be getting as much as Oh

10:
He been talking? Yeah

11:
Kawai or some shit like that.

10:
Oh he outta pocket for Yeah

11:
Play play ka play.

10:
Cool. So I ain't know he was talking.

11:
Nah, you go in there and say man I think I'm worth a little more. If we could figure it out cool. I Think you would win different. But when you say nigga, I'm like kawai fuck you mean nigga.

10:
Well then you tripping. I'ma be a max player. I'm about to show you. You not, you ain't gonna play like he don't and then they give you the opportunity and it don't go how it was playing I told you and then yeah it don't look like Kauai. Yeah

11:
Because you got that op and then you didn't get out there and kill Kill.

10:
Yeah see if you be quiet you'll be like Harrison Orange bro. You get checks. Yeah. Nothing but you just signed that extension. It was that Jalen because now Jalen Johnson extension is probably where everybody gonna be and they like damn my Jalen Johnson was dumb like a all star and we got, they got him for that. Yeah. You're nowhere near him at all. Yeah he should have signed it. Should signed that bro. My life away. He should signed it

11:
But I just think it would've went better if you wouldn't have like opened your mouth and said nothing. Like you kind of try to step on him a little bit with that quote.

10:
So, and Steve Kerr, he benched Jason Tatum, he don't give a damn about sitting you down. Yeah, yeah it is no conscious all bro this you good but that extension like everybody don't get that same benefit. I remember Jimmy Butler turned down the extension and got a max deal but he went out and killed like it was undeniable. Like yeah you gotta, now when you do that you have to keep but you gotta have a coach like Tom Thito like Tibs like no, Jimmy's gonna play 38 minutes a game because Tim ain't trying to prove no point. He wants to win win facts. That's it. Some people like hey they prove a point.

11:
Yeah don't make no lesson outta me.

10:
And then when they trade for a guy that's at your position. Yeah

11:
Come on bro. That's the right number. Don't bring it

10:
Ball. You know what's up. One of the best to ever play that

11:
Position. We don't bring in the best. Yeah low key, top three whatever at this position we going through this turmoil,

10:
We want him to play 42 minutes. We don't have your time for me brother. That that was the writing on the wall for me. I asked to be in the trade like oh y'all train for Jimmy put me in that trade. Yeah I'm trying to go to Miami Facts for sure. Alright man super sha ask a question, okay we'll move on from that. But listen, shout out to the Grizzlies. They came back yesterday outside of y'all getting hurt they was down 20, they fought back in their game. If they win and they end up playing the Thunder, they got a chance or is it, is it quiet? They won a few games, they gonna win a game or two. Okay. They won a few games. They gonna win too. In the play in they gonna beat whoever the Kings or the Mavericks. It doesn't matter. Most definitely but they, they gonna get a couple games. You know who I hate to see Win the play in the Mavericks.

10:

I don't wanna see them under under man team out there man. Yeah I'm not trying to see four games. Y'all playing in the Thunder bro.
