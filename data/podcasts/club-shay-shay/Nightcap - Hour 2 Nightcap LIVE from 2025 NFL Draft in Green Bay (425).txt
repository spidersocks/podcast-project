I really like this. I really like this pick for the Raiders. Yeah, a lot. His pick for the Raiders a Lot to, to me, for me it takes all the pressure off the quarterback because when all hell break loose, hand it off. Yeah. I'm you live to see another day. You live to see another down. And plus I want to keep, I want to, I wanna keep Patrick Mahome out the field. I think that's the, that's the best way to beat him. You see, you saw what the Eagles did, the eagles had the ball so much he couldn't get a rhythm. And then to have a running back like this, that can hit his head off the goal post from anywhere. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's nice. He's extremely look at that.


Oh, that's his high school. That's, that's his high school. High school. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. He could have made it for, You know, he, a lot of teams wanted to jump into the portal. He probably could have made him a couple of million, but he is like, You know what, I started here. I'm gonna finish stay here. Yeah. I wanna start when I finish. I like that. You can do that when you're special. You can do that when you're special. Don't matter where you go. It's what you do once you get there.

I like Warren Don't like They got the, if you talking about Conland, they got ah, I like Tyler Warren, but Tyler, that seven is, is a little high. Think that's too high. That's a little high for a tight end. No, he's good now. He, he's he's, you don't think he's BlackRock bro?


Yeah, he's Brock Bower's Good. You like that? Yeah. Ooh. Huh. You don't think so? Yeah, he nice. Man. Brock was, was from Brock's freshman year. Brock. Brock could have came out his freshman year. That good? Yeah. Did Jeff feed anyone who they take it? Yeah. I'm, I already am. I don't need the jacket.

More weapons. More weapons. You don't think Seven more weapons. You don't think seven is a law? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Huh? I can't hear you. Wait, who, who they picking? Are we? I I they're cheating. You want, you wanna bet I'm a member? Yeah. Yeah. All let, let's bet on the next pick on the next one. Oh, the Texas wide receiver. Is that, that's your dad. All right. Bet. Woo. I like that.


Ah, Maud bu OT Ot. Tap ot Missouri Nigeria. Huh? That's, that's dope. Well, 6 4 3 32. Golly, he massive. Ooh, they look at the Oh, oh, we can move. Get out, get out the club. Wait, get out the club.


Good foot work. Oh, good anchor. Well, he anchored down. Oh, he nice. The question is, how long do you, do you, do you, are you gonna move it? Hmm. That's really high for a right tackle. Yeah. Well obviously they, they, they see something based on, Ooh. Ooh, look at it. Pass that off. Be nice to be, to be that big. To be that big. To be that size. Yeah. He's very nimble. He has good footwork. Yeah. Woo. Get out the club. Well, he ain't a Hey, hey. He balling folk. Nice. He's balling folks. Ocho I like, I I I get it.


I get it. Ocho Yeah. You know they got a couple running backs. Yes. Take some pressure off of Justin Field. They got Brother Bri Brief Hall. They got Allen. I like it. Run it. I like Who's on the clock? Who's on the clock today? Ocho you guy wide receiver from Arizona. He nice. He nice. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. So I'm, I'm thinking about McMillan.


Who, what's Young Bull Football. You got Legett, you got Leg, you still got Thilan? Thi no, I think thi on, but, but I like, I I like them giving him weapons. Right. The more weapons you get quarterback, the Yes. Yes. Like That. Pick his in. Who we got? I said that first. No, I said McMillan first. You cheating. Y'all cheating. Okay. Next one. Next one. The next one. Who's on the clock? The, the Panthers. Saints. Ooh, Shado. Yeah.


Shado number nine. Let's bet. Look at Bet. No he didn't. Nah. Okay. Number 10. 10. Who you got? Who the running back. Right. Alright, let's bet, I bet you wrong. How much? 20 bucks. Si hat. All right. If you lose, you gotta gimme your pack jersey. I'm gonna wear it anyway. It seems like the Carolinas, Carolinas need, they need a receiver. They need weapons. Bryce Young needs weapons. Yeah, they need weapons.


I think it's gonna be McMillan. McMillan is, I think a, a, a smidge better. I I agree. He's really good. I agree. Big target. I, yeah, I, if I'm the Panthers, I'm going offensive here. I'm going, I'm I'm giving him a weapon. You know, the reports already gonna probably, they gonna take McMillan. Right. The wide receiver out of Arizona had an outstanding season in all American going into the season. He was rated as the best receiver in college football.


He didn't disappoint. I thought he played extremely well. He did. And the Panthers need weapons to surround Bryce Young with, to make him even better. That's why I, I liked it. If they take a receiver here and if it's McMillan, I don't have a problem with that. Not at all. It's, he's, he's a good receiver, obviously watching some of his rock running tool. A bigger target for Bryce Young. He's really good in short and intermediate routes. And he can go deep as well. The funny thing for him to be the size he is, he's very shifty. He, he's very shifty to be as big as he is. So, yeah, I'm excited for him. Especially for the Panthers and Bryce Young.


This for these commercials, Man. Yeah. Is the pick in, oh, the pick is in the pick is in. Oh, Joe. Yeah. Mexico. I like it. I coming to the set right now is the human joystick. The great returner. Kansas City Cheese. What? Returner Can't returner. I did return. Ah. It's gonna be, it's gonna be wherever you wanna be. Wherever you wanna be.


What's good, what's good, baby, baby, man? I'm in. Good man. Life is good, baby. Where's home? I'm finna mess you up with this one. New Jersey. Jersey, New Jersey. But that's what love will do to you. That's what love will do to you. So my wife, her people are from New York, long Island, so we decided to make life up there. Okay. Yeah, man, our family got, You know, the kids got family close. Exactly. Grandma got auntie around the corner. Yeah, man, I like that. I like that. Sure. So what you been doing for lately? Man? I've been doing a little bit of everything, man. I, I work with the league office with the legends coordinators here. Our guys transition. Right. I'm an ambassador with the Kansas City Chiefs. So I do a lot of grassroots marketing, community outreach with them.


And then my wife and I, we got a little company we run and then I do a lot of, You know, the typical stuff when you're done meet your sign-ins, You know the typical stuff. Right? Right. So I got my hands in a little bit of everything. Staying busy. The Panther, the Panthers picker in, I don't know how close you follow it. You look at Bryce Young, he got benched last year, but when he came back in, he played extremely well. Same. Like, he slowed down for him. He did a great job. I'm thinking they'd take a receiver here to give him a weapon to throw the ball. They need to give him an offensive lineman. It McMillan my receiver. You, you called it, you called it. That's dope. Hey, he's a, he's a good one too.


But You don't have time to get it. Get the ball to him Good. While, Hey, I bet they, I bet they gonna play. I quit Game baby. Yeah, game. Get it, get it in and out You go. Quick game. But I think the thing is on your, you also put 'em in a situation where now you got, You know, you got day two picks. Here's some offensive linemen. There you go. Yeah. You normally get some of your greatest offensive linemen on day two anyway. Yes. A lot of those first rounds be flaming out, don't they? True, true. Dante, what you think about the Chiefs this year? What, what your what, what's your, what if, if you were GM right now and you in the war room, what are you going to get this year to improve and help y'all? I mean, everybody know we gotta go get office line, old line, old line.


Right. That's simple. Go get that guy. I think it's Justin Simmons. Go get that office line. If he's still there at pick 31, definitely grab him. And then I think we, we also need to go get a defensive back. So I'm looking at offensive lineman. You gotta replace Justin Reed that just went to New Orleans. Right. Gotta replace him at the safety position and go get another guy. Tr McDuff is better in the slack. We tried to put him on the outside. Think you the outside. I don't like him on the outside. Right. The big receivers man. Right. You put the big receivers out there, they just back shoulder in throwing it up. Jump ball. Right. He's better suited in the slot and get you a big guy on the outside. You definitely, you definitely need some, some old lineman. Patrick did not have a whole lot of time this year.


It really, it really played itself out in the Super Bowl. It was terrible. It was like 2020 against Tampa Bay. Tampa Bay all over again. Boy, he nice. Yeah. Ocho, who's your favorite receiver coming out of in the draft this year? Coming down The draft this year? My f my favorite was Travis Hunter. I mean, even though he played both sides of the ball, he was excited. I like McMillan as well. But for me, Trav brings that excitement. One of those players that can put what's in the seats. And it is one of those moments like when, when you, before, before they hiked the ball and you on the field, I'm standing up 'cause I don't know what the hell can happen. He definitely, that's guy Travis Hunter and Man how crazy.


Full circle. This gotta get end up back in Florida all began. That's crazy. That's dope. I like this. I I I, excuse me. I love this pit for Carolina. You do. I love it. I do. I do. Because if, if you guys started making plays for Bryce Young when he came back in there Yeah, you're right. You're right. Plays that they didn't make before he got in there. Yeah. Yeah. Now granted, maybe the game slows down a little bit for him. He got better. But I think the guys around him got better as well. Man. Is McMillan one of those guys who's gonna come in year one and make an impact? Or is he gonna develop, he's Coming in right now. He should make an impact. Plays he should make an impact right away. I Don't know if he's gonna be Justin Jefferson or Jamar Chase. No, no, no, No. Well, he better be think eight, he better be think Eight.


This is is what you can't, this is what they can do. They can put him in positions, understanding his strengths and knowing his weaknesses and hide his weaknesses the best they can. And the more he put him in a position to make plays, You know what he's good at. You know what he's not. And that's, see that's what NFL coaches supposed to get paid to do. Right. But they don't always, but they don't do that. Well. They, they spend so much time trying to tell you what you can't do. Right. Put in a situation, would I do really good and then hide me from what I don't do? Is That that it's that simple. I mean it's That simple. It's some coaches they gonna coach. They know they gonna coach what they know. Yeah. A lot of coaches can't change. What do they do? They're like, hold on, this band's a damn good returner and all that space. Let's put him in the slot.


Give him a two-way go. When you go in, you can go out, you can go straight, you can stop. But that's what I'm telling you. My first year, those coaches, they only coach what they knew. Right. End the ball off. Right. It was a running game type team. They really didn't know how run your jet Sweets jet. They didn't even gimme just sweeps. It just had me returning kicks. Right. And then Al Saunders, who was the wide receivers coach for the greatest show on turf. Yes. Story hold ice screw. They brought that offense and then they know what to do with me. Right. Zakim type plays. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm telling you, I experienced ain't telling you what I think I'm telling you what I know. Right. Coaches can change your whole trajectory of your career. Yeah. But you think with the wrong one. And I tell guys all the time, it ain't how high you go, it's where you go.


Yes. Because you can go really high when somebody don't know what the hell they doing and you gonna be lost. And then people say you a bus. No, I'm not a bus. Right. They just don't know how to use me. Right. A hundred percent. You know, I'm a sports car and you got me hauling trash. I'm a sports car, not a dump truck. So you gotta you gotta understand what you have, how to use what you have, preach, what you call 'em. Hadn't drafted a quarterback. They're the only team that hadn't drafted the quarterback in the first round the last 50 years. Ca So, So we got, we got Shado going here. Gotta because think about, look at, look at this. 50 years Shado. They taking banks.


What purposes? Banks from Texas, Calvin Banks Receiving Off of the, off of the tackle. Well, Look, so they sticking with Derrick. Derrick, Derek Harr, basically. But he hurt. He's Hurt. So who, who? Spencer Rattler. Although You know the Cowboys pick at 12. They not gonna Do, but they, they, but they, Hey they did. You think so? Why not make a splash? What you gonna do with Dak Dak on the books for about 200 something million? One more year. One more year. Yeah, one more year.


Oh, that's a good one. Calvin B. Yeah. Jump the gate. Jump the gate. Kevin Banks. Wow. So what is Sha what is Shado? Go now. But it predicted this. They say 21 to the students. Ooh, banks bro. I don't think nobody saw this. No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody. No. I mean they was talking about Shado, they was talking about Jackson Dart. I don't think anybody saw this. And then you have to address the quarterback situation in New Orleans and you haven't done that yet.


And I thought Shado would've been a perfect fit with Kel Moore. I didn't too. Normally the offensive rookie coaches, they like to his themselves to a rookie quarterback. And we're gonna roll together. Yep. He don't have bad habits. I can teach him. Ooh. Ooh. Let's see. Let's see what he look like. Ojo. Nice base. Nice quiet. Second. Second level hands inside. I like that. He nice. I like that. Let's see what type of punch you got. Okay. Oh, good Wash. I wanna see the punch. I gotta see some pass road.


There it is. It is. Oh, nice step up. Face was a little wide. Oh no, you can't get that edge. No. Can't. Some guys too good. They been that edge O Joe. No, they be gone. You can't get that edge Joe like that. I'm, huh? Oh, number 11. Number 10. Okay, number 10 to where? Chicago. Chicago. I like that. I like that. They gonna be good this year.


Woo. Let it out. Let it out. You got Cole. You got Cole Commit. Yeah. You have Tyler Warren, you have Roman Dunay. You got DJ Moore. You got a running back. They they upgraded the offensive line. Yeah, The suck. The Wait Warren, they over Warren Suck the Man. I know. The Bears still Suck. Bear Still Bear Still.

Oh, they're doing the they're doing the pick. Yeah. What is the schedule? Oh, they talking about the scheduled release. Okay. They're not gonna release it tonight. That would be dope. Hope my chief playing Brazil week one. I hope they opened up in Brazil. Who? I think the Chief's Chargers in Brazil. Yeah. That's a, that's a good one. Stand away from two teams that don't work every home game. Four, five a lot. I go to a lot of them. They got me heavily involved. It's not the right tight end. I like, I like, I like, I love the tight end from Penn State.


You think so? No, the Penn State tight. It reminds me of grunt. He's, he's that big, big real. Yeah. Who you got? Number one all the time. Grunt else over grump. I like that. You know what? But if, if you took, if you took Grump, I Think you over the top. Look, I know you played with Tony, but man, them boys special.


Hey they, especially Kelsey. Kelsey was more like a wire receiver. You know what I'm saying? He, he twitchy. Tony just had them hands. Yeah. But he, he looked like he was running though. He, he told me I ain't catching the crowd. I say, because I wasn't in the crowd. You could not run nobody. You always gonna be in the crowd. I was ahead of the crowd. Think this corner I could. They lost to Dus Ward. Big is in, let's see Here.


It's good. I I I'm dressed perfect. Hey, where's the goddamn snow? Oh man, The snow. You guys? Yeah. Steve McMichael, hall of Famer on that, that bear. The 85 Bears team. Bongo played on That. He played on that team. Yep. Oh, we got Who's taking who?


We got Come on commission. Come give A speech. Yeah. Hum. Hol Loveland, Michigan. Woo. Tight end. Yeah. Michigan. I like Warren. I like Warren from Penn State. I better too. Great hands. Great run after the catch. Normally the Penn State tight, the one thing they can do is block.


Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I'm trying to see the main highlights, man. Oh, here we go. Tyler, er Oh, we take a tight end with the number 10 overall. Yeah, man, I look, I, I'm not surprised that he went in the first round. I'm surprised that he went in front of Warren. That part for me. I think I thought Warren, the games that I watched him high point the ball.


Tremendous. Right after the catch cam block lied him up in the slot. Yeah. Oh. They, here we go. Let's see what he, what he, let's see what, oh, they got it. Oh. Run the wheel wide on him. I like this nice high point. Okay. Okay. Nice. High point. Okay. That we, I wanna say some run blocking. So he's more of an f tight end. He's more of a tiger tight end. He block a little bit. Oh, nice release. He, he Too light. Oh, he not blocking enough.


Not at that side. He more of a Travis Kel. There you go. Exactly. Mr. Sharp. He more, yeah, he more, he he's more of a f. Yeah. Yeah. You put him in motion. Make him the weak side. The tiger tight end. You make him the weak side. I'm not putting him in the point of a tag. Yeah. You don't ask him to block too many times. Well they they already got cold permit it Though. Cold. I know. I guess they want to go to double tight set two tights too. Tighty. I mean, two tights and two wide outs. One running back. I like it. I like it. I like to pick I I like Tyler Warren a little better. That's it. That's all Im Saying. I, he can do a little bit more than what I just saw.


I'm not surprised that he went in the first round. Right. I'm surprised that he went over Tyler Warren. Yeah, for sure. I believe that. Yes. Alright. Linebacker. Linebacker. That's the linebacker right? Number three. Oh, 13. Okay. He Nice. Oh yeah. Look, the one thing Georgia over the last four or five years has put out as some linebackers, linebackers, Linebackers the line. Yep. Every time. And they, they, they, they missing a long time.


He got that from Nick. If you go look at no one, look at Nick. What Nick put out. Yeah. From D-Line. The linebackers. Yeah. He, yeah. Yeah. He edge rusher. But what's the, what's the, the edge from Philly last year as I like it. You gotta, you gotta look now in the league because everybody playing so much space.


These guys, these guys are undersized now at the edge. 'cause you gotta bend the edge. You gotta do what? Because you play in so much space. Exactly. It's not like when we played, man. No, no, no, no. At all. And the, the two 50 days. Look, look, look in the Super Bowl and the run the ball Like 10 times. I think that would've helped Patrick in that offensive line for sure. Just hand It off. Yeah, Look, the thing is, is that when they played cover two, they played, every snap was cover two except one. You gotta run somebody outta cover two. You can't throw 'em outta a hundred percent you, because they got a light box. But because they knew Kansas City would get impatient and Kansas City hadn't shown the propensity to run the football all year. You played right in the Philly's hand.


And now when they got the lead on you, they know you, they know you gonna get impatient. And I was, I I I was shocked. Andy Reed normally gets in his back and, and can make some adjustments. I was surprised by the lack of adjustments he made. But think about this, even with adjustments, there's nothing you could do for just to that type of defense that's coming at you. That kind of way. There's not even with the Quick Game, they were still in the backfield. If you, let's say if you were gonna make adjustments, You know what they getting to him too quick. We gotta get away from Play Action. We gotta get away from Five Step Drop. He couldn't even do three step drop. I think they go Williams. That's why you gotta run the ball. Yeah, I think they go Williams. You got Will Johnson. I think they go Williams Edge.


Didn't they release Leonard Floyd? Is Leonard Floyd still in? He still in San France. Ash. Ash. You hear me? Leonard Floyd Got a, Is the the bathroom too much water? Too much water. Go ahead. Go ahead. I think they're gonna take, they need a cornerback for DiUS Ward left. He's in, he's in Indy now. I like, I think they take a corner 49. Oh no, no, no. The 49 ERs need a corner. But they might go edge. They like the Georgia kids. Georgia Ward is outta there. Yeah, he's an Indian now. Right, right. That's right.


But the guy that's been rising up the draft board is that Edge from, from Georgia number 13 Williams. And You know, pair him with Bosa and Linda Floyd because they gotta get back to Look. Roberts is back as a defensive coordinator. He is back over there. That's my guy. He love, he, he loves to attack the, I thought Cornerback thought with the Green Bay staff. He left the Green Bay staff. No, no, no. He, he went to Green Bay when he left the Jets. Yeah, but no, he went to DC at Look at there. Yeah. What's your door? There is only one place for him to go Pittsburgh. Everybody else got quarterbacks locked in.


I like that for him though. You get those two receivers that they got in Pittsburgh. You got Mike tumbling. You got that running, the running back defense. Jaylen Warner's the running back now. Yep. You know, not the little guy. San Francisco. And I don't know if Jaylen Warren can be a every down fact. No, no, no, no, no. He's at the, he's at the, the charger not G. Yep. What? Yeah, they got the next pick. Right? They do. Oh that man. So what we do with D, if you text your door, what do you do with that Dak? You go play. Don't worry about, don't worry about who behind you.


You just do what you supposed to do. And you can keep on, you can keep him on the bench. You can keep him, you can keep him behind you. I like, but I like, I don't like him in that. They take it. They taking a defensive player. I know the 49 ERs taking a defensive player. You like Will Johnson. I like the edge. Yeah. There we go. 4 49.


Who they got? Who they took? They took, no, they took Williams. The edge. The edge from Georgia. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Look, it's hard. It's hard to go wrong taking somebody in that front center from UGA Kirby done. Who, who needs a quarterback? The ERs don't need a quarterback. They got party and they just paid him. Oh. They need quarter. They do. Where they say, well you ain't gotta hold up long. Woo. Cowboys on the clock.


Cowboys select Shado Sanders. No, Man. The old lineman. Oh yeah. I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised. They need O line. Zach Martin left Booker, they take Alabama's tackle what you need to be able to run the football or you need to be able to protect Dak. That's a good pick.


That's a good pick. Now what we need is for Jerry to make a splash and trade for Tyreek Hill Booker, Alabama. He was what the, he was the third ra. He was the, he was the second rated tackle behind, behind Campbell. Ooh, that's nice. Really nice. At the point of attack. Gimme that. Oh, he's sudden. He'll strike you now. Yeah. Good hands. What? Good Hands. That's what I saw. Hey, good hands. Look at Mr. Bianchi black on Blackhawk.


Oh baby Su Huh? That's dope. They're taking Booker. Who Is it? No, They not taking the linebacker. I bet you they take one. Who? God. You remember Sree got hurt and they were small at the linebacker position too. They were real small. Mikel Williams. It cowboys pickers in. We're about to find out. Ur. No. Is everybody like linebacker from Alabama?


He'll take a kicker. They got the best kick in football or one of them guard. That's who they taking cotton. Who they taking? Is it the Bama Guard, Alabama. Tyler Booker. Tyler Booker. Okay. Booker. You see that's A good one. Pair him with Tyler Smith.


Tyler Smith. They'll probably kick Tyler Smith back out the left tackle. That'd be a good move. And then put him at guard to replace Zach. Yep. That's dope. Alabama gonna have some draft pick Now what thing Alabama gonna do now? Alabama gonna have some. Alabama gonna Georgia, You know. Yeah, man, that that SEC Big boy in shape too. Check him back. Yeah, because think about it. Will Campbell Yep. Went four. The Missouri ot. I don't know the Missouri Who?


The Missouri O. He went like seven. Here he is. I Like Georgia guy. You gonna pick him? So 12. So, so four. The top 12 picks from the SEC offensive linemen. Two offensive. Two Offensive linemen. Yeah. So we got three offensive linemen and a, and a and a edge rusher. Where the offense going? Joe? What you guys need? You, You, I mean, oh my goodness. A little bit of everything. Defense. Well, you trying, you're trying to move Jalen Ramsey? Yes. Well, if you move Jalen Ramsey, you could probably gonna need somebody to replace him.


Ooh. Do you take Wil whip Howard? I'm trying to think. I I'm Trying to under where Miami, where do you think Miami should go? Corner? That's what I'm saying. Yeah. You like the corner from Michigan. It's nice. I I don't understand why they trying to move Ramsey Stripes tag. That's what I was thinking. But the production is still there. Is it you, you played a lot of money for tour. You paid a lot of money for Tyreek. You paid a lot of money for Waddle. Waddle. Waddle. So the odd man out is your best cover man.


Yeah, man. Tyler. What, what are dolphins? What are dolphins taking? Dolphins. What do dolphins need? Corner linebacker, dolphins. What are the dolphins taking? They on the clock. Everything. Unfortunately you can't, can't get one of everything. You get one or something. Come on Miami. Don't mess. Don't mess up. Don't mess up. What? We gotta keep it up there for the time being after the show. We can give you that. Okay. Okay.


Let me give him one. Huh? One behind me, huh? Nah, no, we don't wanna start that. Nah, we don't wanna start that. I'm like, now I'm interested. What, where are the dolphins going? Ocho? I have no idea. What do, Well, You know they don't need a wide receiver. No, we gotta go defense. We gotta go defense. They don't need a receiver. Obviously. You know, they don't need a quarterback. They could go offensive line. Yeah. Keep Tua upright. You never know. You gotta replace Jaylen Ramsey being at He on the train block of Him, him, him being on the trade block. So I'm curious, will Howard was probably the, he was the, he's the highest Grady Corner. Yes sir.


From Michigan? Well, no, look, he's the second highest Grady corner. He was first Trav was the highest Grady corner. Okay. So I would not be surprised if, if this the offense take a corner here. 'cause I agree with you. I think they need defense or no lineman. Yeah, you got running back with a chan. You good there? You said most, most Is going now. Hold On. What about Tyler Warren? That tight end. Oh. Ooh, that Will Johnson. Okay. That's a good one. That's Jalen Mill right there. Will Johnson.


It's not on there yet. Cowboys get Cowboys got their, got replaced. Zack Martin. You had Zack Martin a staple a long, long time. What? He's in the Johnny Manzell draft 2016. Yeah. When a lot of people thought they were gonna take Johnny Manzell to take Zach Martin. Yeah. And they get a seven, eight time first team all Pro Seven, eight time Pro Bowl player. Unbelievable career. But as much as they ran the ball, he was in a lot of collisions. A lot of 'em. Who that? Zach Martin. You know he retired? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you get somebody to replace him, you bump Tyler Smith probably back out to left tackle.


Okay. You keep tearing Steel that Right. Tackle. You run the football a little more. You got Javonte Williams. Now you got somebody to protect Dak. Keep him upright. Hopefully you can, can stay healthy. You know. And I know They not gonna win Until Jerry Jones Is up outta there. Well, he ain't going nowhere. Well, well they, well it don't matter who they, he go to. It don't matter who they No time, no time soon. It don't matter. But lemme ask you this. What if they make a trade? Because I told, I told Ocho, I said, what if they make a trade and they trade for Tyreek? I love Tyreek. But is Tyreek still at Difference Maker? Is he still at Difference Maker? Absolutely. He's still at difference Maker. We cannot forget just because one season when two was out and the number suffered. Ain't nothing wrong with it.


He still, he still that guy. Absolutely. Absolutely. I love the cheetah, but I don't know if that's the move that Dallas needs. I don't, I don't know. Don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think that's the move for the right price. What's the asking price? Just take over the contract. It's the trade, right? Yeah. You just take But what, what, what compensation are we giving? We giving up a third round or we giving up a fourth round, third round Tyree's by the third round. Third round Right now. What you giving up? Yeah. I ain't giving up nothing. No hell it. No way. Third round, third round. Pick a beat. What we talking about? You not giving up a second round for the be still the most dynamic receiver that because he had one off season.

Pick The problem is the, the, the guys that's on the clock right now don't need quarterbacks. No. So if you didn't go with to Cleveland, The Giants, well that's what he was saying. If he doesn't go nine, nobody else needs a quarterback until 21. But do The Steelers taken a hundred percent? Yes. I believe they do. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Yeah. Antonio Gates. And Antonio Gates was a basketball player. Graham, Jimmy Graham was a basketball player. So we know the success that these guys have coming in, but okay, now it's, You know, let's go. We need more production at that position.

No. Stopping people Stopping people was just like my, my, You know who, Who they Oh, I like this Player.


Oh, Joe, what you would've did if you had Joe Barrow as your quarterback. Same thing I did with Carson. Carson was a beast. A Beast. Have some fun. Gotta think. We, they, they passed the ball like crazy today, bro. Like crazy. That's different. Think doing our Era. It's coming back. When you play Rudy Johnson. Remember Rudy from Auburn? What I remember Rudy. Yeah. Old Rudy. Then we had Cric Benson when I first got there, it was Corey. Corey Dill was there For Corey Di That's who I was there. Yeah. And I was, I was a rookie.

Likewise man. Good to to see your boys. Hey, he ready? Okay. You getting micd up? Look at this. So there's your best players. Yeah. They got Jaylen Walker, will Johnson, Memorial Hampton and Josh Simmons. You think they take Josh Simmons, the ot. Hey. Coming, coming to the stage to join us now. NFL Hall of Famer missed one snap in his whole career.


Slim Jill joke to Come on. Whatever you want to say that bro. Joe, you look good baby. You guys looking good, man. But let me ask, you played, how much did you play at when you played? About three 20. Three 20. What? Yeah. You played a concerted effort. You say once I'm done with football, I'm going down to what number two 50. When I was 18, I was two 50. And I said that's where I want to get to when I retire. So how long did it take you to get 70 pounds off? Six months. So what did you do? You changed your diet extra fast?


Yeah, so I stopped eating all carbs. Okay. I really got into swimming. Okay. Because swimming's really hard. Oh yeah. Especially your big owned big Yeah. Big guy. I was fighting drowning the whole time. Pretty hard. It is. So when you exert yourself like that, I I was just conscious of what I ate, but Right. Also, I had to eat a lot. Yeah. To be able to be three 20. Right. Right. Because you're not, so, in other words, you're really not a natural, you a big guy, but not a a an only big guy. Big by normal humanity standards. Yeah. Right, right, right. By NFL lineman standards. I was small. I had to eat myself into that body. Right. How how hard is it for you to stay at this size based on the, the structure of that? It's not too bad.


The only time it's really challenging is if I close my eyes and still think I'm a lineman when I pull myself up to the kitchen table and I got like five plates. Right. Yeah. But, but I just gotta make sure that's like once a month. You know, you just gotta make sure it's not every day. Okay. Your team, the Cleveland Browns, they trade back, pick up an extra, pick up a extra cup of draft pick. Yeah. Or even a first round of next year. Yep. You like to move. So From a mathematical standpoint, You know, you look at the, the draft charts and like the trade charts. Right. It was a really good trade for the Yes. But you lost out on track Travis Hunter. Hunter, that hurts. Yeah. Because You know, he's such a locker room guy. He's a culture guy. He loves the game. You hope you'd be there for 15 years and be that leader in that locker test you need.


Right. And shit, he could play two positions. Yes. He can play receiver two for price every one. Two for the price. One you can't pay him two contracts. Right. Everybody needs more receivers. Everybody needs more corners. Yes. I would've liked him, but I still think I like the guy that got to be able to pair with Miles Gareth. Yeah. The pick of end for, for the, the Falcons look like they going with the edge you got from Georgia. John Walker. Yeah. Linebacker. You did say linebacker. I thought they would look, I, we thought they were go defense. I thought they were gonna go Will Johnson or a linebacker, hometown kid played at University of Georgia, Salisbury, North Carolina.


Write on, write it on. I like that suit. What do we think about that drip That I it Hey, it looking good. The guys getting dressing. Dressing is a thing. Now it is. When I came to me, Hey guys, come in with sweats. You know, see that it wasn't guys coming in with ess bags Goyard trip out. I, I didn't wanna be thinking about that at all when we traveled. Yeah. The same red polo and khaki pants. Every time. Every time. Didn't have to think about it. Didn't wanna worry about it. No. You saved a lot of money doing it. Saved a lot of money. Yeah. Alright. The Taylors didn't like me very much. You like this pick you like this Pick for the Falcon Joe. I think it's good. You know, adding edge pressure. A guy that's flexible that you can do a lot of things, You know, as a defensive quarter.


You like those guys that you can fit all over the place. Yeah. Right. You build little packages for him to be able to get after the quarterback drop into coverage. If you want him to be able to get into some of those zone drops. And obviously he's a dude. Oh yeah. The one thing about Georgia, if you look at them, they gonna have some edge rushers, linebackers and D tackles. Oh yeah. They gonna have those. Did they? Yeah. Kirby took a page outta Nick Saban before because You know in Alabama Absolutely. He had DT edge linebacker. Yeah. You gotta win up front. You gotta have a solid front seven. Look at, look at his close. Look at that speed right there. They must have a good strength coach because all them dudes are huge. Fast, strong. Arthur, look at that. He got held, they like, they like to linebacker six foot 6 1 2 30, 2 45 as high as they go.


Yeah. Able to go sideline side. Yeah. Yeah. Man, they go hunting. Those guys go hunting. Oh yeah. He knows it. He's plumped hometown guy gets to stay home. Yeah. Aid He's from North Carolina. But think about it. Athens is less than an hour away. So he brought same house. It's money. How far is it from Georgia to Atlanta? Athens is about from, from, well, from from from where he practices probably 30 minutes, 40 minutes. You ain't gotta do nothing. Right. Because they work, they practice up in flowery branch. Right.


Beautiful. I like this pick. I like this pick. You know you got a quarterback, they got good receivers, they got, they got Kyle pissy tight. Kyle need to bounce back. Yeah. He had that great rookie season. Joe. He needs to bounce back. He needs to put some seasons together now. Yeah. I I think for him he needs just consistency of the quarterback play. Right, right. You know what it's like if you got a different quarterback in there, it just takes some time to be able to build that rapport There. There have been a few, there have been a few receivers that have been able to manage the, the, the quarterback carousel beha before a Titan. Like Yeah. For a Titan like, like pitch. He needs the consistency at that position. Getting hurt as well. Messing up ACL. Yeah. It doesn't help you. Right. What do you think about the Cardinals? Where did Cardinals go? What did the Cardinals need?


Oh, that's a good question. Who, who is it? He like Will Johnson. I see quarterback from Michigan. We'll see, I don't know. I think that'd be a pretty good pick once you start getting into the middle rounds. If you're not targeting a quarterback, you take the best available. Take the best a you don't try to pick a guy based on what you need. You just pick football players. Right, right, right. That's where it gets hard at. I know. You know what happens, you end up picking, okay, I pick the best available player. Is it Murphy still there and some guy like comes behind him and he's a a seven time all pro. I have you had, if I have known that I was taking it. Well they're standing up. Pig is in there we go.


They're not wasting any time. Ask what we looking like with a pig Will Johnson. He said here, what's your name? Amir says Will Johnson. I told, I told, I told him that first Amir is Radus. I told him that first Joe Cheating. All right. You're cheating. Okay. As what we hearing. Here's the thing. We were talking to Dante. I said look and everybody was saying this. Yeah. If your door doesn't go to, doesn't go to New Orleans at nine, nobody else until they get to 21 needs a quarterback. Yeah. So you could see a precipitous fall.


But I tell people all the time, Joe, it is not how high you go. It's where you go. Where you go is more important than going high. And I say, look, I know it's your dream or I want to go number one, I wanna go this, but you go to the wrong situation. Yeah. I'm gonna be in trouble. Well the other thing is, You know if in your mind you're like, I wanna make the most money, I wanna be the drafted highest. It's a such a small amount of difference at this part of the draft. And plus as a quarterback, you make your money on your second deal anyway. So Yes. Go to the best situation. Even if it's in the second round. Right. Where they can build a around everybody. Your money's in your second contract. Yeah. So it's not how much money, how it's how long you make money. Yeah. You know, you can make money for four years Or you can make money for 14 years. You know what?


Wow. I'm gonna bring some out. I'll bring it out. Wow. In my bang det. I, I got, I got my own beef deep tackle from old, I raised my own cattle. I brought some sticks for you guys. Don't worry. It's coming out later. All Appreciate it. I got a hint for you. I know it's your style too, don't worry. Oh, but pick, I'll send you some free stuff. Appreciate That. Not taking what you call them. A dach old miss.
