That's, I mean, there's no other way around it. The Packers defeat the Seahawks. 30 13, the Seahawks four game winning streak came to an end. Green Bay had 369 total yards.


Seattle had 208 total yards. Yeah, Russian Yards was one 40 for the Packers, 80 for the Seahawks passing staff. Jordan Love was 20 of 27, 229 yards, two touchdowns, zero interceptions. Gino was 15 or 19 for 1 49, no touchdowns. One pick he got Nick and Sam Howell came in and filled him for him. Don't know the severity of the injury. Looked like it was an ankle injury, a lower leg injury. So we'll wait for the evaluation before we can give you a conclusive on what transpired with Gino. So hopefully he's, he missed the remaining of this game and it was nothing serious and he'll be able to come back and play next week. Ocho, when you watch the Green Bay Packers, I think because The Lions were playing so well that people kinda overlook Green Bay and Minnesota.


If I'm not mistaken, I think Minnesota is like 11 two. Yes sir. With a chance to go to 11, 12 and two tomorrow. People kind of overlooked Green Bay. But Green Bay is a, because remember I think it was who that Minnesota had to take a last second of field goal, if I'm not mistaken, beat, beat up kick the last second field goal maybe, maybe it was Detroit. Maybe it was Detroit, that, that kicked that last second field goal in Detroit in, excuse me, in Minnesota to beat him. But Green Bay got a good team. They could run the football with Josh Jacobs. Jordan Love 20 of 27 tonight, 229 yards, two touchdowns defenses. Very good. Really good. And Jaire hadn't played, I know if was Jir in No, Zaire didn't even play.


You know, they had a comic Team. Yeah, he'd been Nick for a while. Coing was in there, But they're, they're good team. What, what do you like about what you saw from Green Bay and what you've seen thus far? Yeah, from the Listen from the package, Jordan Love has been phenomenal all season. And the funny thing about Jordan Love being phenomenal all season is this game against the Seahawks. They didn't even have to throw the ball and Josh Jacobs in that front line dominated the game from start to finish. I'm not sure what the Seahawks were doing defensively, but for some reason they kept standing that two shell all night long and they continued to give the ball to Josh Jacobs over and over. And we getting four a pop, seven a pop, eight a pop, and they refuse to come up. They, they refuse to come out of it, that two shell until late in the third quarter when it was goddamn too late now at that point.


Right? And they started gaining a little ground when the momentum shifted, you know, in the Seahawks favor a little bit obviously. But, but by that time it was too late. It honestly, you know, just to be honest with you, it was a shitty game. It was a boring game. It was a boring game. Gino didn't, didn't, didn't play fairly well. Once Sam Howe came into the game, you know how the offensive it was over, you know, the offensive book, the offensive playbook changes tremendously. You know, there's only so much he can do. He throws the interception. I mean, he got sacked twice, maybe three times, something like that. Listen, it was, it was a good, it was a good look for the packers, the fact that they were able to play one dimensional football running the ball the entire of the night. Romeo Dobbs had three catches, two of 'em for touchdowns outside of that, you know, it wasn't a huge day in the air, but on the ground, Josh Jacob did his thing.


Well, that's what you need to have happen. A team goes, jumps into that two shell. You need to have you running game, be able to run 'em out of it. You should not allow someone to try to stop your running game with, with a light box. Yeah. Which is a seven man box. They must drop that eighth guy down and now you play, now you throw, you know, you pitch and catch outside with the single, single high safety in the hole. But I thought, I thought, I thought Green Bay did what they needed to do. I mean, you see the numbers 20 of 27, so the ball really was never in harm's way. Yeah. And that should have been higher because he missed some throws. He had Romeo Dobbs or over out Christian Watson threw it behind him on the deep Ball. He came, Hey, he, he under threw every ball tonight and got passed the appearances.


He under threw Romeo Dobbs and ended up getting a field goal. He throws it out there. He has swollen beat down. That's, that's a touchdown. So he could have easily been 23 of 27. Yeah. Easy. Instead of 20 instead of 2027. But look, we're nitpicking here, Ocho and I think sometimes we have to nitpick for the simple fact is that when you get to the playoffs, every possession matters. Every play matters. And a a a under throw here or, or misfire, there could be the difference in winning and losing a ball game. And so those are the things that you wanna, like, you wanna try to clean up heading into the playoffs because Green Bay's gonna be in the playoffs. I think three teams outta that con that divisions gonna be in the playoffs. Detroit, Minnesota, and Green Bay.


That's three teams. So that means only one other team is gonna make it. Only one other wild card team gonna make it ocho because you got your four division winners. Detroit, or, or, or, or what? Minnesota. 'cause now they're tied, both have two lawsuits. NFC East looks like the Eagle's gonna win that division. NFC South Tampa is in control of that division. Now. We'll see what Atlanta does tomorrow night. And then the NFC West, now the NFC West is still wide open because you have Seattle, you have Arizona, you have the Rams right there Nipping tub. So could two teams outta that division get in? Absolutely. Absolutely. Two teams could get in out of that division.


But Dallas is lurking. We'll talk about the Cowboys a little later today. They played maybe their best ball game of the year defensively they got after Jordan Love picked him a couple of times. Cooper Rush did a great job of throwing the ball and Doel did a great job of running the football. But I thought the Packers looked good. They did what they needed to do. You go on the road, Ocho, that's a long way to fly. Oh yeah. At night. And now you go, you know, and so you, you a night game the 12th man. But give Green Bay credit, because they came out ready to play. They jumped on him early 14, nothing made 'em one dimensional. So now you gotta throw the football in. Once Gino got Nick, I think most people kind of knew that Sam Howell was not gonna come in and move the needle and he wasn't gonna be able to do anything that was gonna get Seattle back in the game.


Had a a, a nice run, a 24 yard touchdown run. But it was, I don't think he, he didn't put fear in anybody tonight. So congratulations to the Green Bay Packers. They moved to 10 and four with a 30 to 13 win over the Seattle Seahawks. Seahawks are now eight and six. And if I'm not mistaken, they still lead the NFC West with the Cardinals right there along with the Rams ocho what a game it was. And, and Motor City. Yeah, Josh Allen and the Buffalo builds go on the road and beat a team that had won 11 straight games in Jerry go the Detroit Lions 48 to 42. The team, the highest scoring game this year. The team combined for 90 points. 1,080 total yards, 12 total touchdowns.


Josh Allen was sensational. Again, 430 total yards, four touchdowns, two in the air, two on the ground. Jerry Goff was equally as impressive, but not nearly enough. He had 507 total yards and five touchdowns. No interceptions. Remember ocho, it's funny how the NFL worked. You remember that game? He had five interceptions and they won. He had five touchdowns, no turnovers, and they lose. That's just the way it goes. Buffalo raced out to a 14. Nothing leave on Josh on two touchdown, two Josh Allen and TD runs and they never looked back. Buffalo. They good Ocho. Yeah. The only, the only thing that I question is Dan Campbell calling an onside kick with 12 minutes left in the ball game.


You're having a hard time stopping them. I'm not giving them a short field. The last thing I'm gonna do is give them a short feel. Ojo, right? You give 'em the short and you had the momentum. Now you give 'em a short field and now they go up, they go up at about another score and you're, you're fight fighting an uphill battle. But 48 to 42, I had some concerns about Detroit and that defense. And it's starting to show its head a little bit Ocho Now look, Josh Allen's not an easy guy. Say no, he's not an easy guy. Getting to him is the easy part. Getting his big ass on the ground know top parts. Like he's like a more athletic Ben Rothberg. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely is.


But this was a very, if you wanted points here, it was 48 42. And remember they lost the game last week. 44, 42. So they scored, they, they scored 90 points in the last two weeks. Good, good. Love, bad, bad Ocho. We gave up 86 though. Yeah, most definitely. Most definitely. Listen From a fan perspective, they enjoyed this game. If you're a Buffalo fan, if you're a Lions fan, this is a game that you look forward to having. Even if you won to lose an end, maybe not so, but the fact that, you know, you can put up these kind of points against good teams says, now we need to work on the other half.


You got damn defense. Yeah, 44. Like, oh, they put up 90 some point what? 80 80 something Together. They gave up the, you talking about you talking about Buffalo? Buffalo scored 42 last week, right? They scored 42 this week. They gave up 44 last week to the Rams. They gave up 42. Now, both times they were on the road. Now, I mean, you know, you on the road and say that, but you're gonna have to play a little better because it doesn't look like, unless something happens with Kansas City, it's gonna be tough for you to, to overtake them because you two games, they're two games clear of you. Hey, if the, if for some reason I just had this feeling, it's the, it's the bill's year. It's the bill's year.


Josh Allen definitely is playing very, very well, very well. And if he happens to see the Chiefs again in the playoffs, at some point, at any point, I think this is the year that they finally beat them. Josh, Josh Allen's playing out of this world. He's playing out of his mind again, I i, early in the season, obviously I had Lamar Jackson as my MVP, but as, as of the past, what, maybe three, three, maybe four weeks, Josh put that cape on, man. He was Clark Clinton at the beginning of the season. Now he's Superman. He's playing just like Superman and what they're doing offensively with no superstars, huh? We, we did. There are no bonafide superstars over there in Buffalo. You know, you have very good, adequate role players that are doing their job very, very well.


They run the football really well. 34 rushes 197 yards, 14 rushes 105, two touchdowns for James Cook. 11 carries for 66 yards, two touchdown for Josh Allen. And I, I think that's the thing that when the voters look at and say, hold on, he lost Deon Diggs, who was a Pro Bowl player. He lost Gabe Davis, who was a very si who was a very good receiver. You look at what they lost defense, both of their safety. Tra tra DiUS whites, excuse me, DiUS White. And he's doing this. Yeah, the only difference I see with Josh Allen this year in the pre in the previous years, he not turning Over. No, That's, that's the biggest difference.


He's been this, y'all, y'all guys, he's been averaging putting up 350 and 400 yards of total offense. But he gets himself into trouble when he turns the ball over all, when they're going into score and he throws an interception in the end zone and is a touchback, he fumbles in the red zone when they're going to get points. That is the biggest difference in what I see with this team. Plus those guys aren't in there now. They scored 48 points. And if I'm looking at this, if my, my, my thing shows me correctly, shows I don't see Cooper with a target. Amari Cooper didn't get a target and they dropped 48.


Now, if somebody else didn't get a target last year, we know what's gonna be transpiring. So now he's the unquestioned leader of the entirety of a team is peace. Look at the way he's playing ocho. He doesn't force he look now he did force what he's rolling out a BS ocho and he throw back to the middle of the field and he almost got it picked. I say, John, why, why, why, why He go, he, he, he gonna be him a little bit every, every so often. He go, you gonna be him? He's, and so they, they, the look your defense is gonna, if you, if you get the Buffalo Bills, your defense best, best be on their best behavior because that's not an anomaly.


Now, I'm not saying 48, but if you go back and look at it, they've got, what, eight straight games of at least 30? Yeah. They're probably averaging 30 a game. I think it's them. I think they're Nip and Tuck right there with Baltimore. But they might have overtaken Baltimore. Well, the highest scoring team in the NFL, are they won? Are they two? Because I know Baltimore, Detroit and them, they were right, right there. But I think after these last two games, I think Buffalo's overtaking them. But d hey boy, you gonna have your hands full because this team offensively. Yeah. And they got, they got like, oh, oh. So it's just like, oh, you got secure doing this thing that he's so hard to get on.


I mean, Josh is just so hard to get on the ground and then you gotta worry about his leg because now Ocho I can't really rush like I want to because if I, if I run past him, he gonna jump out the window. If I don't keep, if I, if I let him get outside of the pocket, he can throw on the move and he still can go get me a first down. Even if it's 30 15. So it's so hard to defend him. You just hope that he makes some mistakes, he gets anxious and he starts and he turns the ball over. But if he's calm, like he's been playing like the last three to four weeks, boy, you got your hands full. Listen, You, you gotta you gotta be, you gotta be disciplined on defense. If, if anything, especially with knowing that he's a dual threat, you gotta tell your D ends, Hey, bring your ass up field and keep contained And level off.


Yeah. And keep, contain and level your ass off. Now if you have to have a spy, you know, because he's the dual threat quarterback, you, you gotta have a spy. Tell your, you got to keep your discipline, keep your disciplined. If, if he, if he runs, just make sure you bring him down. You gotta make the tackle, especially in man to man because everybody back is turned. Everybody back is turned. And you as our last savior

These tools are shaping the way safe and personalized skill building is delivered. And for that T-Mobile, congratulates, Easterseals, Southern California for their unconventional thinking And like deep the end when you, when you get like, okay, you see where he is, he's, he's back there in the pocket. He's about seven to eight yards. Once you get that point, now you gotta level off. Don't you run your ass by and trying, trying to, oh, I'm no, no, no, no, don't do that because all he's gonna do is step out the, he's gonna step out the window on you. Bye. And like you said, when you got your back turned, now good luck with that.


But he is, he's a big, he, he's playing extremely well. The guys are making plays for him. Coleman came back today, had a big catch. Kincaid is finally back. He's making catches. Shakira is his safety blanket. James Cook, you know, catching outta the backfield that look this, this, they're really good. Yeah, they're really good football team. They're plague extremely well right now. Is there a team in the a c that has the possible weapons that what Detroit has or the Rams have? Because I haven't seen it consistently. No, we know the Ravens Have those kind of weapons.


Uhuh no. Yeah, lions of lions are first and points scored, scored second in total offense. Bill's a second in point, scored eighth in total offense. That's crazy. They keep playing like this and they gonna be first in total, they gonna be first in point score. Yeah, they gonna be first in point scored, but they have a, they have a team that's, that's, that's really good. Like I said, I didn't agree with Dan Campbell with 12 minutes left in the game, Ojo kicking on Sidekick Kick. Yeah, I don't agree with that. Listen Dan, that I don't agree with, with that. That's been, that's been Dan. He, he's always been who he is. Listen, he has some big cahors and he wears them. Matter of fact, he walks down, he walks on the sideline with a wheelbarrow with his nuts in the wheelbarrow.


And that's how he coaches, that's how he plays. He goes forward on, forward down. He goes for you. He does on sidekicks. And his players believe in him. He believes in his players. And I think that's why he makes some of the calls that he makes that most, most players, I mean most players and analysts and punters like yourself just wouldn't dis wouldn't, you just wouldn't agree with based on the situation, Joe Brady not calling the shots. The bills are fing on all cylinders. Ken Dorsey, if I'm not not mistaken, he's calling the plays in, in, in in Cleveland now, isn't he? Isn't he in Cleveland? But IIII feel bad for him because Jamis is a turnover machine. Ocho check this out. The lions and the Chiefs are 25 and one against the rest of the league.


They're ing two against the bills. The lions never led. The chief's biggest league was won and they trailed the entire second house. Yeah. Hey one, one Team that look like they're headed to, once The bill wait, once the bills jumped out on, once the bills jumped out, boy, it's an uphill battle from there. Yes. It's an uphill battle from there tonight. Once the package jumped out on, on the Seahawks, it's uphill battle, you know, put yourself behind the eight ball. It makes it that much more difficult to beat a good team. This is a good team with a great offense. It's difficult. Yeah, you, you're right Ocho. I I think the thing is for me, the question I wanted to ask you is that do you believe of the team that look Buffalo, Baltimore, Kansas City, there are certain team Pittsburgh, there are certain teams that we, we we have a good indication that they're gonna make the playoffs, right?


Are the bills the scariest team? You know what? I think so. I, I think, I think so. Now when we when you say are the bills the scariest team, are you speaking a f, C or, or NFC? I'll let you combine 'em all. If you had to say, if you had to, if you had to put, if you had to put some amount of amount of money that mattered to you, who would you put your money on right Now? You know what? Yeah, I'd probably put it on, I'd probably put it on the bills, you know, and, and and, and that's because of the quarterback situation. Now I also look at the lions as being very scary as well. But golf doesn't scare me. Golf doesn't scare me.


The players around him scare me. Montgomery scares me. Gibbs, Jameson Williams, you know Aman Ross, St. Brown? Yeah. They scare me. But something about that goddamn Josh Allen and his supporting cast fits him so well in what they do. Man, that shit is scary. So if I had any amount of money going into the playoffs and had to bet on somebody to win a game, it'd be them goddamn bills. Especially right now with the way they playing. Yeah. And the thing with Detroit is that Ocho, if you look, they have 15 rushes for 46 yards. They threw the ball 59 times. You see with how unbalanced they are. Yeah. When they win games, they're very balanced team.


They don't get that lopsided. I mean that's a, that's a, they threw the ball that, that's a 25 that basically it's 15, so it's four, that's 25. So 60 what, 75% of the time. But you know why They were behind eight ball once you fought behind like that in the beginning of the game, you down 14. Okay, boom. Nine. I'm panicking. I gotta find ways to get back into, into the game. And what's the one way to get back to the game very fast? Oh, you gotta let that bitch rip. Yeah, but what happens when you go three and out or you don't and you don't convert. Now you let that high powered off Back on The field. Back on the Field and defense already tired. Yep.


But the bills look really good. Josh all look, he must have watched Lamar said, man, look here. Lamar did what he did against the Giants. Five touchdowns. No interceptions. But he said, hold up, let me leave something. Lemme put something on y'all mind. I know y'all saw that, but I wanna put something on your mind right quick. Ocho the defense injuries are finally catching up. Think about it. Aiden Hutchinson is out. Alen McNeil, Carlton Davis, Alex, Derek Barnes, Martin Dorsey, rake straw, Jr. Mosley, Ocho at some point in time. Think about those are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.


That's 10 guys. Okay, let's just say for the sake of argument, all of them aren't starters. Let's just say for the sake of argument, you try to play 18 guys. Well, 10 of them, 10 of them been injured. Hutchinson is a starter. David is a starter. Mcne. Yeah, Alex is, he's a starter. Those guys are starters. Hey, so we, we talk, we talk about winning, we talk about playoff football, we talk about getting to the Super Bowl. People think it's all about playing good. The most important thing is health. The most important thing is health in your roster. Seeing how many people on the back end of the season going into the headed into the playoffs are healthy. Everybody gonna be hurt, everybody gonna be hurt. We about healthy and able to actually play the game.


So this, this, this is tough for them. And we'll see if they're able, they're able to overcome some of the injuries that they do have at key positions. I hope Car, I hope Carlton is okay. Some of the mid-level players are, are hurt right now. Obviously Aiden Hutchinson. Aiden Hutchinson is out. And it is gonna be tough. It's gonna, it's gonna be tough and you could say next man up, but the next man is the next man for a reason. So sometimes telling the next man to step up ain't really given what it should be given, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Sometimes Ocho the next man is the man that was after the next man that was up. So he was the next, next man. He was the man that was next to the man.


So that, that, that's your problem right there. Tyron Johnson said Lions players were putting fingers were they not supposed to be on the onside kicks strong. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, bring that to me again. Now Tyron Johnson said Lions players were putting their fingers where they're not supposed to be on the onside kick from. Okay. Okay. I I would, I would, I would, I would I need a little bit more context to that. You know, You don't need no context. What, what, what, what, what you putting your finger in on the own side? Where you putting it Poking somebody in the eye?


Nah, nah, you ain't poking nobody in the eye. Yeah, that's a new one for me, UNC. Man, I ain't, I ain't never been on the own side. Yeah, yeah. You know what going on? You know what going on? That power, they trying to get that ball. Ain't nobody pok. No. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, they be digging in the aisle, but not that one. Hey, one thing about it, boy, they do anything under that power boy, they don't play. Yeah. They get that ball. Oh Yeah, I gotta have that. I mean, if you a one-eyed baby, that's I they talking about, but I don't think they, I'm just saying, don't joke if you, Hey, hey boy, they don't play.


Nah. Hey, I need, I I I need the ball. I'm do anything. Hey man, they'll grab anything. Hey, hey guys, be scream. Hey man, ref, he got my private. That ain't what they, they don't say private like, man, well let go the ball then ref, Ref can't see that. Ref can't see that. He's like, Hey, if you let go the ball, they gonna let go. That, Hey, we need the ball. That's the most valuable thing right now. We, hey, you don't know who it is, but Ocho, the Eagles beat the Steelers in the Battle of Pennsylvania 27 13 after three consecutive weeks of being held over 180 yards.


Jalen Hurst was 25 or 32, 2 90 with a pair of touchdowns. Brown and Smith both went over a hundred yards marking the fourth time they achieved the feet setting a new record for the most such games by duo in Eagles history, Hertz. The approach was a little different this week. The grass will be greener where you water it, where you decided to water the past game. And that's the kind of fruits that you saw by label like that. Yeah. Yeah. The grass is green on the other side, the other side, if you water it, if you fertilize it, if you tend To it Right, right, right. You, you always got to you. It is all about upkeep. Sometimes it, sometimes it don't matter where you go, you know, as long as you got some grass over there, it's all about the details.


You know, being sharp, paying attention. Know everybody ain't really got the discipline though, huh? Very few got the discipline to take care of the grass. You know, where it's green, you hear me? Yeah. But anyway, but that goddamn game was good though. I could tell, I can tell you that the game was good and it didn't take a turn for the worst for the Steelers until Na j Harris Na j Harris fumbled That ball. Yeah. When, when you fumble that ball, you know, it was, it was, it was a little haywire. But what the Eagles did after that, on both sides of the ball was impress offensively. Yeah. The Eagles game Offensively and defensively, they looked Good. It would've been interesting to see Ocho had he knocked fumble that ball.


But you gotta realize they got their points now because TJ Watt punched the ball out of Jalen Hurtz. So, I mean, if, if you, if we being honest about it, I mean, you think about it, Russell Wilson was 14 or 22 for 128 yards. They ran the ball 17 times for 56 yards. So they had less than 200 yards. As a matter of fact, to be quite honest with you, they had less than 190 yards of total offense. Excuse me. You're not gonna win very many games with 190 yards of total offense unless your defense takes the ball away five, six times, a couple scooping scores, pick sixes other than that and you sack the opposing quarterback 5, 6, 8, 9 times.


But to get no sacks and to get what he had one turnover. Well, Cooper Deja fumbled on the punt. That's how they really got the touchdown Deja fumbled on that punt. But other than that, they really didn't move the ball offensively. Ojo, this was probably the most, this was their worst offensive Performance. Performance we've seen Ru Was inserted back into the starting lineup. This was a, the Eagles, the Eagles dominated this. They, they got after. Listen, it's, I I it's the fact, it's, it's okay. I think, I think it's okay. And it's good that Russ guy had had a game like this. It had a game like this and it, and they didn't just play against anybody. They played against the Eagles, the eagle team that has won what? Ten nine. 10, 10.


Yeah. They wrote 10 road I if I'm Not mistaken. So to see him have a game like this is, is understandable. And it, I wanna say it's okay. I wanna, I wanna say it's okay. Boom. We back to the drawing board. What do we need to do better going forward from here? Because when we do play good teams like the Eagles at some point that we'll we'll probably have to face at some point, maybe in the playoffs or a team that's in the a FC that we might have to face in the playoffs. What do we need to do better? How do we execute our offense? Because I saw so many goddamn three and outs, three and outs, three and outs from the goddamn Steelers where they couldn't, they could never get the themselves into a rhythm all offensively couldn't run the ball. No. That guy, man, that goddamn Jalen Carter.


I told you they got him playing that D-line with Williams and Carter and Davis with sweat. Oh, they playing. Hey. And they got them two them, them two guys in the middle, Zack, Ron and Nicole d Them boy playing some balls by Good ball, Man. So listen, there was a collapse. They had a collapse last year. They were 10 and one and they collapsed the remainder of the season. That ain't happening this year. Not with the way that defense playing. Nah, absolutely not. But they were, they were a situation on the sideline. I think Arianna was trying to talk to Jalen Carter, the D-line coach.


I've never seen a team that has such prosperity, but damn they argue by every, they constantly into it, they Dysfunctional. I'm like, damn, I would really hate to see if they were lose. Okay, so Ocho, if we 12 and two we're 11 and two we're 10 and two and we're arguing and we're bickering on the sideline, what the hell would it be if we fixing six? Right. Right, right, right. Or we fixing six. What? But you know what it i, it, it could be a sign, it could be a testament. It could also be, it could be a good thing. It could, it could be a good thing. You, you, you never know what it is. Obviously I can't say what it is, especially from the outside looking in. You know, players are passionate, coaches are passionate, wanting everybody to be on the same page, not celebrating too early.


Being that the game was was was somewhat close, could, could have been an issue as well. But it, it's, it's a good thing unc to see that the coaches care to see that the players care and that everybody's on one accord with the same understanding, with the same end goal in mind. Let's, let's, let's keep that focus on, on, on what we here for and why we doing what we be doing. Right. Them Georgia, boy, they got like four guys starting. They got the Kobe Dean, they got Jordan, David, Carter Carter, they got Davis, they got Nolan Smith Jr. I mean, they got a lot of guys that's starting that, that's from the University of Georgia. The Bulldogs, them dogs.


But they're playing really, really well. Now. I, I saw Washington driving slay outta the back. I I I've never seen a guy get blocked that long that far. I Hey, that's where Ocho that's where you just dropped. And I know Sway didn't want to get dropped because he didn't wanna be, oh, I got pancake. He knows they're gonna show it on sports center, but bro, when the man drive you 30 yards out of the back of the end zone, put your, put your back up against the wall that's gonna get showed too. I mean it just still gonna show, you know it, but hey, I mean he likes six eight, like two 70, so it wasn't nothing Snake could do. Hey, listen, I I think obviously just speaking on that play in general, I think it's unfair when they change the rules when guards and tackles pull on sweeps, you know, or misdirection plays.


Yeah. Now that the corners and safeties are at a disadvantage. Oh, you can't cut Them, huh? You can't cut no more. You can't create a pile. No, no. You know, So I I I think it's almost, it's it's almost unfair. And I mean the dbs and, and, and safeties are at a disadvantage. Huh. You know, give, go ahead. Giving up a hundred, almost 150 pounds. The Yeah, but you, but you and you, you hurt somebody and see that if you try and see, here's the thing, they say you are you trying to make it safe because you know, guys, a guys don't want the knee shots or so, right guys, a my knees mask, I'm my knees, they don't really let you cut. And the interior line like used to when you and I was at more that. Yeah. And so they say, look, we're gonna, we're gonna protect. We gonna, we're gonna try to protect everybody.


Obviously heavy emphasis on the quarterback, but I grew, I I like that rule. 'cause man, them guys going out there and them guys just trying to take, and even on the runback ocho, they won't let you, the quarterbacks used to try to take the blockers out. Right. They won't let him do That anymore. And so that's always been a rule on the, on the, on the kick team. You can't block, you can't block below the weight, but the Eagles look good. Yeah. The Eagles look good. And I said this about three weeks ago, I'm not so sure if Detroit and the Eagles play, I'm not so sure I wouldn't take the Eagles. I'm almost certain I would take the Eagles. Oh, Detroit I would. Yeah. Hey, hey. Because the Eagles, the Eagles have something that very few teams in the NFC has.


They front seven can go get home. Yeah. Listen that front Seven. And we know golf is not mobile. That's not, now that's Jo Josh Allen that you try to get to him and get his ass on the ground. You can get to Jerry golf. But, but, but also remember now they, you still gotta deal with that. You still gotta deal with that running game. You still gotta deal with the running game. Yeah. And if, and if things are balanced is there's a, there's a good dose of running, there's a good dose of pass. Listen, Detroit can be very dangerous despite what they look, despite that loss today, they ain't no slouch. No they're not. But you know, Philly, they love to play True shell. They believe they can, they can stop you run with their front seven. And I don't see any reason why, I haven't seen anything to make me, to make me feel that they can't because those big boys up front that D-line is, is is vicious.


Yeah. They go, they, they get out there. Right. And they did a great job on the Steelers today. The Eagles look really, really good. 27, 13 winners over over the Pittsburgh Steelers who fought attendances for but still lead the a FC side. A FC, excuse me, north. Yeah, we talked about that. The team was leading by 14 in the fourth quarter. We to see coaches yelling at each other. Yeah. But hey, if I'm, if I'm, if I'm a team, I'm doing everything I can to try to get a lead on the Eagles. Right. Because you know, they gonna, they, they, they they start foing fighting up fighting and bickering the Yeah, that's what I gotta, I got, I gotta see it.


That's what I wanna see. That's all I wanna see. Ocho I wanna see if, if, if calmer heads will prevail, but then I want to get a lead and then see, you know, I, Hey I'm I hey I'ma, what I'm gonna do to AJ Brown, I'm gonna double him early. Yeah. I'm gonna frustrated. You see, you see the kind of day he had today though? Huh? You see what happened? Yeah. Yeah. I I, man, I knew that was coming. I knew that was coming anytime. I mean, listen, it, it is just, it just the, the, the way the NFL works, just the way it works in general. You know, you have a day where it's bad like that. You say some things and then the pass the game today look, look, look like they ain't miss a beat The thing.


Oh. Oh. But like you said, Ocho Steelers do a great job of stopping the run. Run Exactly. With the passing game. The passing game Better do something today. Yeah. Or you gonna get beat. Yeah. Ab absolutely. I absolutely knew this would be what happened today because they're so good. Listen, they top five, you know, in d in defense, the Steelers especially against the run. So I knew they were gonna have to put the ball in the guy damn May that had some type of success. A and you know, and they were playing this game without George Picken. But I'm gonna tell, I'm gonna tell George Porter Junior, this brother, they're not gonna call that push off when he opens you up outside and then he clubs you. They're not gonna call that. So you can tell the official he doing this all he want to. They're not gonna call it, first of all, it's within five yards of the line of scrimmage.


So bro, you have to get, hey, you gonna have to get in the weight room because you a little light right now. You gonna have to, Hey, you gonna have to get, hey, you gonna have to be able to clamp up because these guys, hey, these big receivers like a AJ Brown, they gonna play through contact. Yeah. Every time, every time They gonna play, they gonna play through contact before Gb. It's all about understanding your personnel, understand what you can and can do against certain receivers. There's some receivers, you know, they physical, you could either get physical with 'em or use what you have to your advantage that they don't. Your quickness being quick being twitchy, you know, and just shadow 'em. Just shout 'em, don't you don't. Got you. You gotta understand your opponents.


You gotta play everybody different, you know, and what works best for you. Yeah. You can't. Yeah. Okay. Russell Wilson offense need George Pickers to get back after scoring 27 points in the first game without picket, the Steelers offense scored just 13 manager 163 total yards. Lost a time of possession by nearly 20 minutes. The 163 yards was the fewest in a game since week two of 2010. So now almost 14 years. Almost 14 years since they, shit, excuse me, that's 15 years since they had that. Fewer yards. But the Eagles are really good defensively.


They dominated the game, dominated time of possession. So when you see a team dominate time of possession, you're not able to run the football. I don't think anybody is surprised by that number

OCHO. Patrick Mahomes ankle sprain overshadowed the Chiefs win versus the Browns Mahomes left the game with an ankle injury with less than eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, which was later determined to be sprained ankle back. Carson Wentz came into the ball game to finish for the chief Andy Reed head coach. Andy Reed said it's a little sore. It's literally day to day. He probably could've come, could've come back in, but he wanted, he wanted to go back in, but there was no need for that. Mahomes will have more tests on the ankle on Monday, if I'm not mistaken. Ocho, they play Saturday at home against the Houston Texans and then follow that up on Wednesday, right against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Yeah, Ocho, I just don't, I just, they talk about three p.


They just gotta hope that Mahomes can finish healthy if you watch this game. Right. He running for his life every place. Oh yeah. Most Definitely. Most definitely. Most. Let not only is he running for his life, listen, the offense line play. No disrespect to the players offensive line play there has been bad all season. Huh? That ain't nothing new. Yes, it's been, it's been bad all year. It's been abysmal all year. And there's nothing that, there's nothing that they can do. Mahomes can't complain. I mean, there's, I mean, who you gonna complain to? You got, you got to play through it and just hope at some point, you know, you, you have the right schemes, you have the right, the right game plans and what you can do. But still, it, it is not, it's not working. It's not working. They, they Ain't place. They try to stay as balanced as they possibly can. You Know what I think, I think what I think they should do, I think Mahome should relax on Saturday.


Relax the Houston game. Who's the backup? Who's the backup again? Carson Wi. Oh, see, let yeah, let Carson wins has enough, enough cache, you know, and he, he, he knows how to win and manage a game. I would let Carson wins, take over the Saturday against the Texans and let Mahomes come back on Wednesday. What you think, Mike? I mean, I'm, I'm just, I mean that's, that's just, that's just how I feel. It's gonna be interesting to see Buffalo. I think Buffalo has an easy schedule, easier of the schedule.


If you say that they got the, they got the Patriots twice, they got the Eagles, excuse me, the Patriots twice. They got the Jets and then who, who else do they have? I know they got the Patriots twice. The Jets. Is that it? The Bills Patriots twice the Jets. That's it. That's it. It, so they got the Patriots. Think about they got the Patriots twice and the Jets. Oh, that's, oh, that's not fair. That's not fair. But you know, it's funny, that could be a trap game, but anytime you play a divisional opponent Ain't trap.


You don't think so? Have you seen the Patriots play? Have you seen the Patriots play? Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Okay. Ain't no trap. Hey Listen, hey, They better hope. They better hope. They better hope Buffalo get trapped in Buffalo. That's the only trap you chance you gotta win, is they get trapped and they can't Get out you no games like that, man. Teams always surprise each other. You know why the Patriots come out there and do something crazy for four quarters and stumble up on a win. It happened all the time. I don't know why it happened like that, but it just happens all the time. Especially with a team that's been dominating the way Buffalo is. And Kansas. Kansas City, Houston at home. Pittsburgh on the road.


Denver on the road and Denver's playing really, really well. Denver had 'em on the ropes last time. If you don't remember. They ended up, they blocking the field, Block the kick at the end of the game. Block the kick. Yeah. Football guys get on on, on the chief side all season long, man. Yeah, and here's the thing, because Buffalo beat Chiefs head to head. If they finish with the same record Buffalo gets home field throughout. That ain't really somewhere I would wanna play a half home field advantage anyway. Honestly, For me, this Buffalo looks different. Yeah, because even last year, Josh still turned the ball over a lot and he put the ball in harm's way.


Yeah, a lot. He hasn't done that this year. Now remains to be seen come. Playoff time, pressure ramps up, expectation ramps up. Especially if he continues to play like this. Ocho I think it's a two horse race between he and Lamar Jackson for the MVP. Pittsburgh did a job that kind of hurt saquon's, excuse me, MVP chances. So I think it's a two horse race between Lamar and, and, and, and, and Josh Allen. Josh is playing extremely, extremely well. What I think he has what he has 12, 10, 12 Russian touchdowns. Yeah, he has another 25 passing touchdowns. Lamar is playing out of his mind though.


Lamar had five touchdowns today, so he's probably what, 33 and three? I Missed that. That's the one game I couldn't see. Man. He was ball, he was ball. He was on, I was on the plane. Yeah, he had five. He had, he he, he had about 290 yards passing five touchdowns. So I think it's out of those two, but Josh just keeps doing it. So many, I mean it is every week. I mean, we saw what he did last week. He's the first guy since 1954 to throw for three touchdowns, rush for three touchdowns. He backed that up with two touchdowns, another two touchdown rushing, another two touchdown passes passing. And he's kind of been doing that the entire season.


And so it's gonna be very, very interesting. I really think it's a two horse race. I don't think anybody else is in the conversation currently. Right. That's just me personally. Now somebody might say, well what about this guy? What about that guy? I think it's a two horse race now. And I don't see anybody knocking Josh Allen off the Eagle, the, the Patriots. I don't see it now. Like you said, they could ri rise up and, and play unbelievable. Still lose but suppress some of Josh's numbers. But if he done, I I I just don't see the eagle. I just don't see excuse. But I keep saying Eagles, the Patriots, I just don't see without him turning the ball over. I just don't see how they score.


Have enough offense to score. Damn Man. You, you right, you right, you bro, you, you right about that man. God, Lee, man, it just, it, oh, it's something about them games late in the season. I'm telling you, especially when it comes to divisional games. It it get, it, it tricky it get it, get it get real tricky. Even, even listen, Buffalo is playing really, really well and I, I don't know what it is. It just, it happens. You I see it, we see it every year late in the season. Kansas City Ocho, they just don't have any explosive plays. Everything is nickel and dime. I mean, you look at Patrick Mahomes, he's 10 of 11 because everything is a shallow frost.


Everything is a, is a is a smoke screen, everything is a spot route. There's nothing that they're pushing the ball down the field. But hold On, this is what it was last year too. It was nickel and diamond the year before that. It was nickel and diamond. You gotta think the explosive plays. The last time they, the Chiefs had those explosive plays that we're used to seeing, well hell was when Tyreek was there. That was what, 3, 4, 4, 4 years ago. They, they, but they could occasionally get down the field battle every, every, Every, every so often. No, But that was 50 50 the offensive. Yeah, true. But O ocho, the offensive line is worse now than it was last year. I don't think. Think about it. They kicked Joe Tunney from left guard out the left tackle.


That's how bad it's gotten. And so now he's playing out a position. Kudos to him because look, my first game at left tackle and I gotta go against Miles Garrett, what the hell is this all about? Yeah, the offensive line is worse. And the defense look clearly, clearly. I don't know. God must have been busy when Jamis was, when Jamis Winston prayed about the, you know, turning, turning the ball over. But he did it again today. Three interceptions or Joe three. He had what? He had four And what fumble against the Broncos. He had turned the ball over about three times last week.


He turned the ball over three times. And you know, the thing that look, I understand, but when you say that's not who I am, turn the ball over is exactly right. Right, right, Right, right, right. That's been your mo you turn the ball over your, your sophomore year at Florida State. You came into the league turning the ball over. He's only had one season in which he hasn't turned the ball over double digit as far as interceptions. We didn't even count the phone with Ocho. We're just talking about picks. But when I look at it, when I just look at the Chiefs ocho I mean, it's just like every play Mahomes is running for his life. He's trying to throw jump passes. He's, he's getting pulled down, he's throwing the ball, he's scrambling, he's running for his life. It's just, I I just don't see how they, I just don't, you look, I understand last year.


Last year. It ain't got nothing to do with this year. I just don't see if, if, if he were to win the Super Bowl with that offensive line, you might have to call him to go because we've never seen anything Like Right, with with the offensive line That bad, That offensive line that bad. Yes. Oh man, I, I I and, and one of the things that makes the, that makes the chief so great is their ability to adapt, to adjust and make the necessary changes, you know, in season. You know, that, that they need to make. So this will be a, a testament to, to how great their coaching, their coaching is.


You know, 'cause this is when it counts on, In today's game, one of chief's, one of the chief's biggest issues were the inability to ma man manufacture takeaways. 12 and one record the Chiefs had not produ had produced just 10 turnovers, which was tied for third fewest in the league today. The Chiefs became the third team in the last 15 seasons to log six plus takeaways, plus five plus five sacks in the game. At least five sacks in the game. The chief six takeaways were the most in the game since Kansas City. Week three took the ball away from the Jets eight times in 2016. Damn. Oh, Joe, the Cowboys beat the Panthers 30 to 14 coming off the deflating loss to the Bengals on Monday.


The Cowboys responded on a short week with the exception of one play. Bryce Young, the defense s mother Bryce Young, the offense was efficient and a reconfigured offensive line. And Cooper Rush had his first three touchdown game of his career at six and eight. The Cowboys still have a chance to make the playoffs, even if it's faint. They have a milk chance. That's crazy. 2% with another loss. It goes down the ski. Hold on. So even with a six and eight record, the Cowboys still have an opportunity to have a chance to make the goddamn playoffs. Yeah. Nine and eight. They're gonna have to get to, somehow they gotta get to nine and eight. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. And then hope some and then hope somebody in the West Fosters, right?


Oh, so oh, they got, oh, Because you're getting three teams, first of all, you're getting three teams. First of all, you're getting three teams outta the n of the NFC. The NFC North. Right? Because those teams already have 10 wins. So you got two teams that are 12, got 11 and two attending four and a 12 and two. So you already got three teams above 10. So those three teams are going to the playoffs automatically. Now the NFC South is gonna get a team in the NFC. The NFC West could potentially get two teams in, because what you call 'em eight and six. Seattle's eight and six. What's, what's ar what's Arizona?


Seven. Seven. They're seven and seven. Okay. They, they, they 500. What's what's the Rams? Okay, see, what's, what's the Rams? You got two teams already at eight and six. Damn. So they gotta win out and then hope something tragically hap something happens to one of the, the Rams or the Seahawks. It ain't, it ain't gonna happen. Could you imagine the Cowboys make it though? Can you imagine the Cowboys make it to the playoffs And get their eyes beat out? Get their eyes beat out. Oh. Oh, we gonna find out because guess what? They got the bucks on Sunday night.


The Bucks are really good. Baker's playing really well. Wait, They got the hold on. The Cowboys got the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Next Sunday night In Jerry's world. Yep. Man, they, you see the, you see the Bucks hung up 40 today, right? I sure saw that Mike Evans was back. Mike Evans, Mike say, I ain't tried to, I ain't tried to let my father Yard Street go just Yet. And I, I wonder how many yards he got to go before he hit it. He got, he got three games left. Right. I know he need, I need, he need a 400 something. Well he needs probably that 300 something now two 50. Dang. Oh he, yeah, he, he could probably, he he could make it. He can make it. Yeah, but here's the thing. The big, the game might come down.


What's, what's the Commander's record? They're eight and six or they're nine six. Nine Five. They're nine and five. Okay. So they win another game. What you call 'em can't catch 'em. Right? So there goes your wild card right there. Right? They're done. All Washington has to do is win one game that gives them the 10 wins. The Cowboys can't get the 10 wins. The best they can do is get the nine right there it goes right there. Washington wins one more game. Washington has, they have the Cowboys, they at Dallas, I think they got the Eagles again. And then the Giants, Eagles, Falcons, Cowboys, Falcon.


All they gotta do is get to what, Hey, get to 10 and you're in. So Basically you think So you Think the Cowboys Gonna make, oh Joe, that's like, you like the bowl, right? Hey, all they gotta do is strike out. Yeah. And I lock you out. Ain't nothing you could do. So basically what you're saying is the Cowboys probably gonna make the playoffs. No, they're not. You don't believe them at all? Nope. No. What, what percentage? Percentage. All wa if Washington gets one more win, they get to 10. The Cowboys can't get to 10 wins. Okay. Alright. The Cowboys okay. CD Lamb about eight catches he had eight. Huh? Okay.


Detroit's 12 and two Eagles. 12 and two. Right Now if the playoffs were to start today, number one C would be Detroit. Number two would be the Eagles. Number three would be the bucks. Number four would be the Rams. The number one wild card would be Minnesota at 11 and two. Greened 10 and four, the commanders at 8, 9, 9, 5. Seattle at eight and six. Arizona at seven and seven. Falcons at six and 7 49 ERs at six and eight. The Cowboys at six and eight. So they're 12. Okay, Got It. Dang. Only 16 teams. So CD Lamb played really played great today.


He had eight catches, 405 yards in a touchdown in the first half securing his fourth straight 1000 yard season. He finished with nine catches, four buck, 16. Rico Doll had also had an outstanding game. 25 carries a buck 49, his best game as a pro. The Cowboys ran the ball 40 times, 211 yards. When you can run it, you see how you do Whatever you wanna do. Game to take off O jump and the, but the defense was outstanding. Goldson a sack, Michael Parsons, two Sacks, a tackle for loss. Lewis a sack tackle for loss. Lawson sack tackle for loss.


Six, it had six sacks, seven tackle for losses, and they picked off Bryce Young twice. Well, if you do that, good chance you gonna win the game. Yeah, yeah. Listen, Dallas, I they they were playing the Panthers and the Panthers. The Panthers have been playing really good football. The past Played real well. Yep. Bryce Young has been playing really, really good football. You know, the past three or four weeks they've been competing. They might have been losing, but they've been doing something we haven't seen them do all yet. They've been competing in, been in games all the way up until the last minute. The Cowboys defense today, obviously a a ton of They came to play, huh?


No came they came to play. They came to play. They came to play. They definitely came to play. They had a ton of, ton of, ton of penalties, a handful of turnovers. And hell, they, they still had a a, a good showing. They still had a good showing it. It was, it was, it was, it was good. It was good. So Cowboys tried to hold on, say, Hey, let's play this thing out. That game last week really hurt 'em a lot. That game against the hurt. What, What you mean hurt him? What you thought. I hope you don't think they was gonna beat us, man. Well, if y'all played, if, if y'all, if they'd had any quarterback other than Will Levis today, y'all would've lost.
