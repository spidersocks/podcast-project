I wish I would've got the ball handed to me when I first came in the league. I would've shot that bitch 20 times a game and that would've just became a normal me. That would've been the norm for me. Yeah I should've stayed in Indiana. I got shoot that bitch when I was here. I was gonna ask you what's Coach let you kind of get your shit out the morning. Nate McMillan Nate didn't give a fuck. How the fuck with Nate and Coach Bud used to let me, you know on the fourth quarter he'd be like Jeff go beat Jeff. Like throughout the game I had to pass the ball but Nate McMillan was like just fine pg long as PG gets touches fuck everybody else.

I like Miles and that's funny that you said that 'cause a lot of guards always came back and fucked with day after Champ. They was like, he was straightforward about how he he talked and stuff. They just like, but also shit on offense I gotta do what the fuck I wanted to because I he you lead the show, all you gotta do is try to play defense. When I said try except all the fuck I did. I was not a defender. I never said I was but

Obviously you leaving the Pacers, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. How did you get to Minnesota then? So I wanted to go to the, I wanted to stay with the Pacers. Right. So the Pacers was on a flight, Prichard, he was on a flight, whatever. And he was like, all right, we gonna call you when we land. Tibs called me early that morning before free agency really got going. He called me and was like, yo, we gonna offer you, it was a three year 63 or something like that.

1 (53m 11s):
And I was like, oh, all right I ain't going there. So Utah called me too. Utah was gonna trade somebody or something was like, yo, you can go to Utah. Like these, like my options was Sacramento, Utah or Timber or the Pacers. Yeah. I'm like, it's some badass options man. Damn this is tough options right here. So I'm like, I'm gonna fuck with Indiana. So my agent like Indiana, man they going, they going low ball you. These dudes is talking 21, 20 2 million a year. Indiana talking like 16, 17. I was like, well I'm at home, I'll be fine. Yeah. Like I don't need much 17 million at home. Great.
