So that's kind of what teams are doing now. Even when we was on, even though we go overseas international game, we'd have joint practice. We, you know, go against the 49 ERs nine on seven. You know, we do one-on-ones do all that stuff. It's not the, you know, one-on-one is different because, you know, we seeing these guys, guys have never seen us before. So it's, you know, hey, so it's all geared up and you wanna make them look bad. They try to make you look back. 'cause you know, they watching ocho they seeing their wide receivers go against our dbs. We watching our DBS go against them, you know, go against them. So I'm definitely trying to cook. Yeah, most definitely. I look down there. Oh, oh damn it got, I got good. Oh, I about to tell somebody ass up. Oh, I ain't lying.


I, I'm about tell somebody ass up Kubota get this because you know, I'm, I'm doing both. I'm playing wide receiver and I'm getting a tight end. Really wasn't no fun for me 'cause they couldn't guard no tight end position. So I spent most of my rep side wide. But you're not getting that working game-like situations. Right. Nothing prepares you for the game. Block The game. It's, it's, it's so funny. I don't think people understand that as much as you practice, no matter how much you practice, when you get into the game, it's completely different. It's completely, you'll be tired. It's completely different. You could run two play 1, 2, 2, 3 plays. You run all day in practice. You get in the game, you run two, three plays, you exhausted.


It's something wrong To the sideline. I'm going I-I-I-I-I never understood it and I I still don't understand it to this day. Why? I I don't know if it's the adrenaline, the, the, the pressure of actually it being live. I, I I just don't know what it is. Yeah. That because I don't know how you do it, but don't you, when I, when I ran around, I didn't breathe. No. Because you know, I'm like Right, right, right, right, right, right. Damn. And I listen, I, once I, Because all that come back, you ain't, I mean, you like, because think about when you run, you not breathing. Yeah. Oh, you sure? You sure not.


You sure not Talking about breathe son. No. Hell, I wish I could breathe and In a, in a game, you know, I was so nervous before kickoff. I had butterflies in my stomach. Even, even when, even when I went in the huddle, you know, first, first series of the game until I touched the ball. Not until I touched the ball did I relax. It gave me a sense of calm, touching the ball gave me a sense of calm and confidence like I never had before. Which, which is weird. I done did all that talking throughout the week with the media and I'm nervous as hell inside because I ain't had no choice but to back it up. Oh yeah. Well you gotta be, I mean, you, you, you gonna be nervous, so.


Absolutely. I mean, I, I think when you stop getting nervous, it's probably time, It's time to go. Yeah. Yeah. Because I don't care how comfortable I was and how good I became. I still got nervous. I still got anxious. Like, whew, man. But like you said, once I caught that first one, once I get that, you know, you know, we thud up, You good. I'm like, okay. Yeah, yeah. And now I know what, I know what type of game it's gonna be. Oh, they, oh, they biting today. Ocho. Oh, they biting today. Oh yeah, they biting. Okay. I got me a fish over here. I just gotta make sure I get even to the boat. I can't let him off the hook. I'm like, Hey come. Hey John. I got a fish over here now.


Come on on, let him get away. But man, they, those Miami, they kept it rolling Ocho they beat your fa Hold On now. Come on now. This don't that don't count that, that, that don't count. That don't count. Listen, my my fam u we got 700,000 to come play this game. Now what we did, what we, okay, what we did do is we counted up that little 700,000. Now we gonna take, we going to hold, we gonna listen to me now we gonna take a little break and And, we going to give Alabama state Alabama a and m. We gonna give Alabama Alabama a and m. We gonna give 'em what they looking for week after next. So what did to us, what did to us. That's okay. That's okay. We gonna be all right.


We gonna study. We gonna study. We gonna watch this tape. And, we gonna add the 24 hour rule to it. It's out the window. It's out the window and on, on to the next. We appreciate that. Appreciate that money though, HBCUs, sir. When these big power five schools ask you to come, don't y'all take less than a million dollars and y'all make them pay for y'all Travel Northern Illinois got 1.4 million to travel to North South Bend, Indiana. How far is that trip? How far is northern Illinois from South Bend? They be paying these schools and no Cho by the time I play, by the time I play for travel.


And they guess what? They always require you to bring the band. Oh you know, the band ain't even go, the band ain't go. The band Ain't go. Nah, the band ain't go and it's right down the street. They normally, they normally require you to bring the band. Matter Of fact, you know what, maybe it was only 700,000 because Tallahassee is right down the street. There ain't nothing but a hip. And the Scott, Nah, I need a, I need a meal. I need a meal. I lease a meal. They got it. Oh Yeah, yeah, of course, of course They Got it. Private institution. They they got it big time. They got it. I ain't, I ain't coming less than a meal. Less than a meal. And you gonna play the, and you gonna play for my travel because hell Joe, by the time, if I bring, if I bring all them players I charter flight, that's 200,000.


Yeah. Yeah. So now I guess how much, how much did I get? I go to the hotel Ocho put everybody out, put put them up for a night. That's another 50,000. You probably, you probably walk away with four and some change. Yeah. Nah, I need to walk away. I'll be to walk. I need to walk away with 700 to a million. I'm paying. Guess what? 'cause I'm paying for the whole, the whole damn near the athletic. But budget gonna come outta that. Dang. Because that's what you do, don't you? That's what you're doing. Right. You trying to su you trying to supplement your athletic program with that ass whipping that you know you gonna take.


So that's what I'm telling. That's what I'm telling. 'cause I remember, I think Savannah State, they played Miami. I think they played Oklahoma State got beat like 84 or nothing or something for like, yeah, like 400,000. I said, oh hell nah. 84 points. 84. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good fam u We good? We good. Our state beats our Kirk France returned from his one game suspension to much fanfare and also 50 50 cents. Many men, they wish the Hawkeys working with the coach back jumping out to a 19 seven lead Midway through the third quarter.


But the cyclones found a way late. Mojo thanks to a 75 yard TD pass from Rocko Beck to Jalen Noel. And then a 54 yard game-winning field goal with just six seconds to go after losing six straight into series. Iowa State has now won two of the past three meetings in a, in Iowa. Yeah. They play in I Ames, Ohio State plays in Ames. Iowa City is where Iowa plays. Listen, why, why would, you know what? I'm confused. This is only week two. Why is Iowa and Iowa State playing this early? Shouldn't this be like a game for the last game of the season? Yeah. Oh, you talking like, like you Rival Michigan, Ohio State.


Yeah. That's Not their rival. Yeah. Yeah. IIII guess I could be wrong. I could be wrong. Maybe that's not their main rival. Yeah. Oh, our Iowa State. Absolutely. It'd be like Georgia, Georgia Tech, Clemson, South Carolina. Just I'm curious, why would you be playing Florida, Florida State? Why would you be playing in week two as opposed to saving? Don't Start me to lying. That's weird. Don't start me to lying though, Joe. But all I know is what you call them. Got that Iowa, our Iowa State feel good. They went to, went to their, their rival and and won a ball game after being down in 19 seven.


Yeah. Penn State avoids an upset against Bowling Green, winning 34 27. Bowling Green took a 24 20 lead well into the third quarter before Penn State finally found its footing. Two Kennedy, two key interceptions in the fourth quarter. Stop Bowling Green. What'd you think? Ojo? I I thought, I thought Penn State was in trouble. Yeah, Listen, I I I thought they were too. Connor, Connor Basel, I think I'm, I hope I'm saying his name right. Bowling Green Quarterback. He had a decent game. He had a decent game. If you take those interceptions away, I think Penn State loses that game. You take those two in two intercepts away. I think Penn State probably loses this game.


And as, as good as Penn State is, or let me say, as good as Penn State was, they didn't look up to par today. Because when you think, when you think about a team like Penn State, you expect them to blow bowling green out the water. You expect them to blow, blow, blow, blow 'em out the water. And that's, that's again, I think it's because it's so early in the season, but that, that's really no excuse. They play down to the competition. Hell yes. It's early in everybody's season. Ain't like you done play. I only played you done played eight games and I played two. Hell, everybody only played two games.


Oklahoma State Cowboys wrangle up the hogs and double overtime 39 31 and Stillwater the Razorback look poised to actually won the road game. But the Cowboys reeled up 21 straight points to open the second half and finish off the comfort behind win with Ollie Gordon. I second touchdown in overtime. How many overtime did they have? Yeah, I I didn't get two. They were double overtime. I didn't get to see, I didn't get to see this game Because I think after the second overtime you have to go for two point. Nah, you start going it is two, you just start going for two point. It start the two point conversion then right at you. I think that's how it goes after the second overtime. Ocho you go, you just two point conversion from That point on.


Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So it ain't no you, you know, you just get one shot at the two point conversion. You get it. Okay. The other team, they get a shot at it if they missed you win. Okay. Because it used to be, you know, you kept going because that, what was that? LSU and Texas a and m had like seven, eight old times. Jordan Love is expected to miss multiple weeks after suffering what is believed to be a sprained mcl. Damn. During last night's season, opening laws to the Eagles in South Sao Paulo love will undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis. The Packer's hope is somewhere between three to four week injury sources, say typically MCLs do not require surgery. The Packer's home opener is a weak from Sunday against the Indianapolis code.


Malik Willis, who's acquired by the Packers and a trade from the Titans last week, took the final two snaps and in completion of a sack, the other quarterback under contract on the Packers roster is Sean Clifford last year's backup, who was released last month in the final cuts, but resigned to the practice squad. Damn man. That sucks. That, that, that's, that's, that actually sucks for Jordan Love. It does, man. Let me see. I mean, six weeks at best four with technology, with technology today I'm saying three. I'm saying he, I'm, You know, everybody heals differently. Ocho you know, everybody heals D's the an estimated time.


Could He possibly come back and have a brace on it? He could possibly get back, you know, that three weeks that's pushing it. All things being equal, I probably, what's their record? Oh, okay. That would determine if there's Three or four. Right. Right, right, right. That's a good one. I'm, I'm glad you said that. That's a good point. Good point. So, man, I, I agree with you Ocho I mean, promising future guy played really well last year. First year starting over 30 touchdowns like 10 or 11 interceptions played really good, played himself into a great contract, looked like the, he's the quarterback of the future.


The one thing we know about the, the Packers is that you look at, since 92, they've only had three starting quarterbacks. That's it. Very, very fortunate. Now imagine if other teams very, very fortunate. Imagine if other franchises were that fortunate Guys are good, great, durable, because that's the thing is durability. To be able to take that kind of punishment. And then obviously it's still a physical game. Now let, let's not take that, I'm not gonna say it's not a physical game, but they've taken a lot of the physicality out of it. The way you can punish the quarterback. You see what they do, they, how they modified the kickoff rules.


So a lot of the physicality is trying to get legislated outta the ball game. And I understand, I I don't want people to think, I don't understand why, you know, billion dollar lawsuits tend to your appetite for, for, for jacked up and knockout blows. It kind of dissipates a little bit. Ocho Yeah. But I hope Jordan Love a speedy recovery man. 'cause the pack is gonna need him. Yeah, Most definitely. Jordan, love. I know you're gonna see this. I I got something for you. I got a home remedy here. You right on up real quick. Boy. Shoot. Make it two weeks. The Eagles, Jalen Carter revealed that he's been receiving very hateful dms following his tackle that led to Jordan Love to get an injury.


Ocho Yeah. What do you wanna say to the Packer Fans? Packer fans. Let's, let's be classy baby. Let's be classy. You know, it's football. Let's be classy. It's, it's, they tackle, you Don't tackle in football, right? Don't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, listen, you, you as, as players, we also can't allow that stuff to get to us. Can't let it get to us. Especially, you know, listen, you do that to somebody's franchise quarterback. Oh, you gonna get some, you gonna get some backlash. Oh, you gonna get some hate. And sometimes some of the words they gonna use are gonna be words that, that you don't like. You know, you gonna think they the R word. You, you, you know how they, you know how they gonna do you.


Yeah. Sticks and stones. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words don't fuck 'em. The brown game doesn't start until tomorrow. But as of the morning, the fans are already tailgating. Is this the dog pound? Is the dog pound the most hardcore fans in the league? Most Hardcore. The bills might themselves about that. Yeah. The bills. The bills. Bills would Probably be the most hardcore. Hell, they, they, they might, they might been been tailgating all this week. Yeah, for sure. For sure.

Are you ready to have your baking loving? Mind blown? Well, here it is. Oscar Meyer takes 12 hours to smoke some delicious thick cut bacon to perfection. Listen, most of the bacon out there is smoked for four to six hours. But Oscar Meyer doubles that time. Let me put that in a perspective. You could drive from Detroit to Omaha and Oscar Meyer. Thick cut bacon. Still wouldn't be finished smoking. Check this out. You could go to bed, you can get a full night's sleep. Hell you could wake up shower, have breakfast, including some delicious Oscar Meyer bacon and then drive to work and that bacon would still be smoking. My point is that Oscar Meyer takes the best cuts and smokes them over real hard wood chips for a really long time until it tastes really good. So go out, buy some Oscar Meyer thick cut bacon now and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.


So who you think has the most hardcore fans? Hardcore? Probably Buffalo Bill Mafia. They don't play. And they generous. Yeah. Oh, anytime. Anytime. Another team. Yeah.

Yeah, I played in Buffalo once Eric Moles was there, Eric Moles and Ish Price was there. And the second time I played there, I forgot who I think might have been Stevie Johnson.


Stevie Johnson might have been there if I'm not mistaken. And I played Did y'all go to B Did y'all go, did y'all go to Toronto? No. No. I, no, no. I ain't, I ain't go, I ain't go nowhere. When, when I went on the road and I grabbed my food, I do my little dinner and I, I'm, I'm right back at the hotel ready for team meeting. Yeah. I don't, yeah, I ain't never do that. I ain't go nowhere. I, That that's what you learn. Like, nah, I can't do this. Right, Right. What's what's in Toronto? It's nice now. Hold on. I, I played with, I remember I played with the aos now one year in Montreal, I went to Toronto and I That Ain't Toronto, that's another side.


No, but we went to Toronto. Huh? We went to play Toronto. Okay. And still I Well, you should know what's up there. I know. No, I did the same thing. We got in, went to the hotel, got me some McDonald's, went right back in. Ain't do nothing. Now I, I, I hear stuff about Toronto. I mean, I, I mean, but I mean, you know, you know better than me. I see, I see the look you gave me. So I'm, I'm assuming so is Toronto like Houston? Is that what you're trying to tell me? No. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Ocho, you don't do that. Now you, you saying something very near to tomorrow. I gotta a, I gotta pray Lord that I'm asking for forgiveness. You don't, I'm just saying I Oh, so don't you bring up don't bitches. She still, So I, I just saw the, I saw the look you gave me, you gave me the look and you tilted down your glasses to let me know.


Like, all Right. Oh, Toronto. Toronto Night. Toronto. Mm. Toronto Knight man. Toronto Knight. So are we talking, are, are we talking equivalent to Houston? That's what I'm trying to say. No. Okay. No. Okay. I'm, I'm just checking. No, nah, I'm just checking. Hey. But I tell you what I, Hey, back in the back in the early nineties, prince used to have a couple of clubs, glam Slam and I think First Avenue. Wait, prince Prince. Prince, prince. And he was in there and they were in there. They were in there. Okay. Was in there. You was in there.


I'm positive you was in there. You know, I had to. Right, right. I, I've done, I've asked the Lord to forgive me. Hey, I couldn't, I, I couldn't imagine partying with Prince. I know that's a time there, bro. I wasn't partying with it. But he was in there and you know, Hey Don. Sure. There'd been some times I had hit that Jim, Jimmy Swaggart. Right. Father, I sinned. Right. You I had to ask him for forgiveness. Oh, Minnesota, Minnesota kept as, as a, as a, well as a, one of the great secrets, Minnesota, Don't sleep on it. Unc Minnesota like that.


Like you said though, y'all i'ma change man. Right. I'm with you. I'm with you when you're right. But boy, that happens. Six foot. Mm Like Jessica Rabbit. Come on, man. You know, I was the Elma PI was out on the trail, you know what I'm saying? Don't you? That Wally. Wha Hello. We got, we got lock back in. We got a lock back in. Lock back in. Okay. Lock back. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Brandon Cooks had a lot to get off his chest about the Dak haters ocho, let's take a listen to what he had to say. I mean, it's, it's w it's, it's unbelievable.


I mean, the guy shows up every year, year in year out, putting up numbers, leading his team. He can't do it all by himself. Right. He, you know, a lot of those great quarterbacks that I've been with, Tom and Drew, they don't get me wrong, they won all the games, won a lot of Super Bowls, but they had a lot of help around him as well. Right. And so us players around him also gotta step up. And so when we hear that disrespect, you know, I take that personally and ask his teammates, we should take that personally because at the end of the day, somebody gotta be able to help him get over that hump so we can go win one. I like that. I like B Cooks. I like what he had To say. You gotta to take your quarterback. But it's, it's one key thing that he did say Dak Prescott can't do it by himself.


He need his teammates to help him. And most of the time what's been an issue when they get to the playoffs, it seemed like sometimes some people disappear. It seemed like some people disappear when it come playoff time. I think. I think Go ahead. Go ahead. Richard fault. Go ahead. Listen, I was just gonna say like, better play from the quarterback position in the playoffs where it matters more, where the pressures on. Again, you understand times like that. This is a game of moments. And when those moments arise, you got to come to the party. You got to come to the party with a keg of beer, But Dak gonna have to play better.


Yes sir. In the playoffs, we can't look at the number. We just see people just wanna look at Daks numbers. You go look at Dak numbers against Green Bay, they might be pretty good, but he got those numbers when they were down 28. When they down 21, when they down 17. I need to see those numbers in a nip tuck ballgame. I wanna see those numbers. When they played San Fran, remember when they was Green Bay and Green Bay had 'em down, they were down 21 3 and they fought that, that rally. I mean, hold on. I'm like, come on now. I get it. See, a lot of times people just wanna look at numbers, man, look how many touchdowns he had. Look how many. But when they become, because Ocho, we've seen guys, guys, excuse me, in the game, have 150 yards receiving.


They done lost the game by 21. What the hell is 150 yard receiver you lose by 21. So that tells me you got a lot of them yards in up. They paying off, they getting, hey, they said, hey, nothing cheap, nothing garbage, garbage time. They gonna let you catch the stuff, keep your butt in bound and, and keep the clock moving. Ah, hell no. Give a guy that got 80 yards And, we win the ball game as opposed to a guy that got 150 And, we lose by 14, we lose by 21 because I know how those yards came about. So all yards aren't created equal. Now if a guy, you know, it's a nip tuck ball game, mocho, and you got 200, you got 1 75. Okay? But all of a sudden you done lost by 21 and you out here talking about, man, I, man, I went off man, please.


But I like where Brandon comes today. Yeah. Oh, de definitely. I like that he supported his quarterback. Yes, the guy look at quarterback, but the playoffs is about the quarterback. O Always, it Really is. Now it, especially when it comes to wins and Super Bowls. Now, if they like you, the, the, the, the, the, the men and women that vote, oh, he won this and he won that, they'll say, well, he didn't really have a good quarterback. And so look at his numbers if he'd had this. But if they don't, then they use that right against you. Well, super Bowl, that's really a team, it's a team sport. When they don't like you, they don't wanna get you in.


It's an individual sport. Whoa. Okay. I'm just, I'm just saying, I'm just, just keep it the same. We all play the same. He played with a level on offense and had a level on defense. Let's just keep it the same. But I do love what Brandon Cooks had to say. Stefan dig spoke about it, adjusting to life after Buffalo, woo Buffalo, Houston, let's take a listen to what he had to say. Damn Houston, just keep coming up. I always believe in I where I'm supposed to be, where I'm supposed to be there. My seat are right here. This is where I'm at. And I, you know, I have like saying like, I don't wanna talk bad about my old girlfriend and make my new girlfriend feel good. You know what I'm saying? Like that was a, that was a good fit too with some great people over there who being here, this is where I'm right now.


This is where God place me. And it's amazing people here. You know what I'm saying? As far as like it being a good fit, you know, this is where I'm at. You know what I'm saying? This is where I'm placed. There is some great people here. I can't, I can't say there's a lot of southern house mentality here, even on this team, even around the building. I'm just happy to be where I am Saying all the right things. What I like that quote. I'm not gonna, I'm not, I, I'm not gonna talk about, not gonna talk bad about my old girlfriend. Make my new girlfriend feel good. Y'all's a good, that's a good, that's a good one right there. That's a good one. But I'm not sure what type of adjusting you gotta do going from Buffalo to Houston. It's going to adjust itself. You ain't even gotta do nothing. Hey, cold weather, you ain't outside no more.


You think about it, you indoors. You indoors, you got eight games at home. You indoors Indy, you in Jacksonville, Tennessee now, you might get rain in both places. Yeah, maybe you get Jacksonville early. Probably not gonna get in the rain. I mean, you could get some rain be, but yeah, I, I, I play much better than the hot than I did the Cold. Yeah. I like, I like the cold and I play much better in the dry than I get the wet. That's just me. You different. I like playing in the cold better. Mm. Hell no. It's cold out there. Oh, my dog's stiff. No, but I like, but I like, I like what he had to say. I like you, like I ain't got nothing bad to say about them. I'm here. I'm happy to be here.


This is where I'm supposed to be. God doesn't make any mistakes. I, I enjoy my time in, in Buffalo, but now is my time here in Houston and my job is, was to try to help them win as much as they possibly can and hopefully we can get over, get over to Hump and get a Super Bowl. So I I I like, I like what he, what he, what he had to, I like what he had to say. That's very, that's very professional. And That's what, that's what you like a lot to hear from your captain. Yeah. Yep. I'm excited. It's football. It's, you know, it's football Tomorrow Ocho, we have some breaking news. Angel Reese is out for the year with a season ending injury.


She announced on her social media. What a year I never could have imagined last bucket of my rookie season would be a three. But maybe God's saying give them a taste of what, what they'll be seeing more of in year two LOL through it all. I've show, I've showed that I belong in this league even though no one else believed. I'm not so sure about that. You're the seventh pick in the draft angel. I have ever wanted to come dumb and make an impact. I can confidently say I have done and will strive to keep doing. So I'm filled with emotions right now and I have a seasoned ending injury. But I'm filled with much gratitude for what's next. Although this is God's timing, not mine, I'm finally able to give myself a physical and mental break.


God gives his hardest battles, strongest soldiers to his strongest soldiers. So you'll see me being the biggest cheerleader on the sideline and unrivaled and unrivaled league. See you soon. Ta-da. What, what was the, what was the injury? Do you know? She didn't disclose A risk is she's reporting it. They're reporting It's a risk. Oh, she probably needs surgery, huh? Probably. Yeah. It had to Bely gotta be dislocated. Especially if a season ending Oh, that, ooh, that's, that's About to throw some ligaments or something. That's Messed up. That's messed up. Yeah. I mean she played, she was, she played well. I I but I I, Andrew, you you was the seventh speaker of the draft.


It's hard for believe that nobody believed that. Well you, You know what? I think she need to blow more. So talk about just the haters there. There's always been people chirping regardless to even when she was at, at LSU, even though she was drafted seventh. And even, even still, even still, you know, people still chirping about anything. They can find anything. They can find anything they can talk about. They letting it rip. They letting it rip. Hold on. My phone just died. Let me, let me get my charger. Yeah, I think she played well. I mean average 13 points, 13 rebounds, double doubles. I think she got 20 plus double doubles. Had a couple of games where she had 20 back to back.


Didn't have a 19 rebound game, didn't have to throw through another 20 rebound game in there. She was phenomenal. I always thought her game would translate, which is ability to rebound the basketball consistently because she wants the ball more than the opponent does, more than anybody else on the court does. That's why she's able to lead the league. She has the highest average for a rebounding in the season. She had the most rebounds in a season. She's been phenomenal. I'm not, I'm not surprised, but when you have a great skillset, it normally would translate. And her skillset is the ability to go get the basketball. Dennis Robin had it. Charles Barkley had it.


Both of those guys were, Charles was really undid. He's the shortest guy to ever lead the NBA in rebounding. Dennis Rodman wasn't, he was six eight, but he wasn't six seven. But he wasn't overly muscular wasn't overly big, but his desire to get His want. Yeah, man. Yeah. So I'm happy that she came in and did, I'm sure she proved a lot of people wrong that thought that, you know, but if you look at what she did at LSU, what she had, I think she said the SEC record with the most consecutive double doubles. And that's a conference that Asia Wilson played in. That's a conference that Sylvia Fowls played in a, a conference that Simone Augustus played in Aaliyah Boston.


So it's not like it's, you know, Candace Parker played in that, well who else played in that? Sonia Roundtree from Georgia. What's ENSs? Tamika CHUs played in that, in that in the SEC. So there have been some big name players to play in there. And for her to have the most consecutive double doubles, I think she had the most double doubles in SEC history. I think that speaks volumes to the type of player that she is. So I'm, I, I'm happy, I'm happy for Angel that she was able to have an outstanding season. Sorry that it got cut short, but like she said, I know she'll be in the gym in that lab getting ready when she's able, when she's able to work out that wrist heals up and she'll be back.


I wouldn't be surprised if she averaged 14, 15 rebounds next year. God's opportunity wants to win. She wants to win a championship. But I think now what she's projecting, what they wanna do is to make sure they're positioned themselves to be on that Olympic team in 2028. I think that true that's True position. They, they that's they they gonna be there. They gonna be there. 'cause they not, they not going to digress. They gonna continue to prove y to year. So I look forward to seeing them in LA and Ms. Clark, Now it's time Ocho for our last segment of the night. It's time for q and a. Hey, we got NFL football tomorrow.

Ocho I see, man. 25. You've been even more influenced spec, especially in game old Superstar Showdown. Can you tell us how that came about? I mean, I think just being a part of Madden in general, as far as the position I'm in now, now that I'm done playing, it's the fact that I've always been a huge gamer. I've always been a huge gamer and in love and had a love and passion for the game itself. The people at EA know that they understood my love and passion for the game and, and wanting to be a gamer.


Not much, not so much a content creator, but just be a part of EA in general. So the position that I do hold at EA and being able to be integrated into the game in some way, in some format is, is has always been a, a dream of mine. And obviously, you know, I do the ratings, the ea ratings for the players, you know, during, in, in season. And they did the opportunity presented itself and you know, they, they, they, they came and knocking and I answered the door and it's, it's, listen, one of the best, one of the best jobs, one of the best gigs. And and I'm thankful to, to still be able to, to not be playing but still be a part of the game in some sense, even if it is Madden.


Yeah. Yeah. I think you're perfect for the job. I can't think of anybody more perfect for, for video game. You I Appreciate that. I appreciate that. Huh? I appreciate that. Yes sir. Yeah. You ah, can't see this. Hey, Unc Ocho, can y'all wish my daughter harmony? AKA harm dog? Happy birthday. She'll be 12 tomorrow. I want to take the clip and surprise her with it. Thank you so much.

What's y'all top three HBCUs. Mine's fam Bethune and JSU of all time. Well, of all time you talking? Gotta be. It's gotta be Grambling, it's gotta be Southern, it's gotta be fam Okay, Maybe Jackson.


It's close. Okay, but Grambling Grambling where you, when you talk about this like top All time Grambling To put down the two other players, players in the N NFL Robinson. Yeah. Yeah. I, I think in Red Southern is another one that have a bunch of guys that go to the NFL. I think for me in context, when you talk about HBCUs, for those that don't know that are in the chat, that are watching, I don't think they understand my love for, for music, my love for the band, my love for always wanting to be a drum major. Obviously I played, I played the saxophone, I played the piano growing up, always wanted to be a go to fam u and be a part of their band, but I couldn't. So when I, when, when the question that's being asked, I always do it from a a band perspective.


My top three HBCUs obviously fan u's number one, obviously. And if, if I had to, if I had had to choose two after that from a band perspective, I'm going probably Jackson State and Southern or Southern and Jackson State. You know what? And Honorable mention is Alcorn. Wait, oh wait, they told me how to say it, right? Alcorn Alcorn, Alcorn State and it just, the band and just dog. I, dude, I could talk about that all day.
