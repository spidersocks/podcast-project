A newly Yeah. They do that all the time. They do that all the time. It's called a buddy system. Buddy system. Yeah. So I had dinner with Antonio Pierce and some, some other folks. Some other folks. And I talked to Antonio and I asked him like, listen, I have 38 jobs right now and I'm looking to diversify my portfolio. Right. Build my resume and will help me get other jobs based on what I'm doing. So being a part of your staff would only further help me get where I'm trying to go. And he said, no problem. So I tweeted out a picture with me and Antonio Pierce and I said, I'm finally outta position as a, as a coach with the Raiders.


Right. And he tweeted right behind me and said, I can't wait to have you coaching up 17. And that's Devonte Adams. So because he retweeted it and basically made it true. I'm a coach now. We haven't talked logistics and money and all that, but we Yeah. Talk. I mean, yeah we can. How do you take a job and not understand finance? They might pay you a dollar a day. Listen, that dollar is gonna be worth it. Opportunity. Long as I get my foot in the door. Like today I was on first take. I ain't worried about no money. Well I was, once I get my foot in the door, I'm Good. How about this? I was worried about you saying something crazy. 'cause like you said you had your foot in the door. Yeah. I was gonna shut the door on your foot if you said something. No, No, no, no, no. I ain't gonna do that. I ain't gonna listen. It is one thing about it, like you consider me your little brother.


If you gimme an opportunity, I'm not gonna embarrass you. Nah, I don't. I think the only reason you, you wasn't trying to, it wasn't me. I was worried about it was Rel. Right. If Rel was there, you wasn't gonna embarrass Re Yeah, that too. See Rel ain't there. 'cause see like sometimes when Rel in the bed sleeping. Yeah. You and I be talking about still Rel or nobody. Yeah. Oh my bad. My bad. Yeah. Don't say she hear somewhere. Where, where re at? Where at? She live somewhere? Yeah. There she go. Where she at? I just play. I just play at ref. She ain't even got no seat in the front. So check this out, Ocho. Yeah. You said you were so confident. Yes sir. That the chiefs are gonna win this game. Absolutely. You said if they don't win. Right, you give up eating McDonald's for one year, that's easy.


You a divorce rail. That's true. And give up sex for the rest of the year. I got a hand. You got a hand? What? How many what you got? How many cars you got? Huh? Play spades. No, I ain't playing spades. I'm just saying I got a hand. I don't believe you giving up any of that. First of all, I think actually I think the hardest thing for you to give up right, would be McDonald's. I can do it. You can't. I can do it. You cannot. And look, there's something I have is called discipline. Discipline And that's the B the best trait. The best asset I do have. So if I had to give up McDonald's, listen for one, the chief's not losing. Let's, let's start there. Right? I know, I seen, I've seen the script. Ash put it in the poll. How many people believe Ocho could give up McDonald's for one year?


Put it in the poll. We gonna put a poll. Okay. Forget McDonald's. What about sex? I believe you'll have a better chance of giving up sex than McDonald's. That's How I know you don't know me. Ra You addicted to both of them? No, No. Watch this. I I made her wait two years before she even got none. I I promise I made her wait two years. That's my point. Right. You ever waited two years before you ate McDonald's? No, But Exactly. But I but we, it was three things. It was three different things. No, You gotta give up Hold long. You said you'll give up eating McDonald's And I give up sex And give up sex for the refuge. And I, That's three things. Right. But I've done all three before.


Not in the same year. Actually it was, Man, you ain't gone three days without eat McDonald's, Man. I'm telling you. What the long you've ever gone without McDonald's? For real? No, for play. Like for real? I I I tried to be Muslim once, so I was, I was, I was Muslim. I was reading the Quran For about they have fish filet at McDonald's. I know. No french fries. No, no, no, no. I couldn't Milkshakes, I couldn't, I had to, I had to change my diet because I was Muslim. I for like six Months. Muslims eat fish. Not that kind of fish. What You mean with that kind of fish? No, Muslims eat salmon. They eat fish. That ain't what Farrakhan told me.


I'm I'm telling you I did it for six months but I couldn't take it. I couldn't take it no more. So hold on. You couldn't take that. But you gonna take giving a McDonald's for a whole year. You couldn't take that. This is, you couldn't do that for a year. But you gonna give six. Don't Understand. The Chiefs are not losing. And the fact that you even betting against Pastor Mahomes is asinine. You Better give Patrick Mahomes against the Ravens. Remember? No, that's 'cause I believe in Lamar and that's 'cause his home team, you know Lamar from down the street in Pompano. So I'm like, you know, I'm, I'm a roof of home team but I had a, my heart was with Lamar. Logically I was with the chief. Well you should have said that. You should have said my heart is with Lamar. I Didn't wanna say that. I wanted to say it how I said it.


And you were wrong at times. And you gonna be wrong with this. Oh, let's bet. Put your money where your mouth please. Ra. What do you think he could give up Mac? Do you think you give up McDonald's? Thank You. Ah, damn. Re you in trouble then Coby? I'm telling you I could do it. I could do It. I don't believe it. Ocho. I'm just saying. I don't Believe it. You didn't believe I could go on first take I didn't. And do what I did. You already had to build on first. Take Ocho. That was 10 years ago. But you were on first take. Nah, I'm on that now though. Oh Lord. I'm on that now. I'm my foot in the door. That's all I needed. Yes. That's how it happened. Because we love Tom Brady.


What's up, bro? Man? Nah, nah, nah. Have a seat. I didn't. Nah, nah, nah. Have a seat. Have a seat. What I do, I was Just saying what's up. So, okay, we ask everybody. I mean we kind of 50 50 chiefs, 49 ERs. Who you like for the Super Bowl? I, I, I, you know what man, you know, everybody always asks me who my favorite team is and I, I've done a lot of halftime shows, so it kind of, whoever paying me for the week. But I mean, at this juncture, man, I, you know, I hate to base it off of my relationships, but I do know, I do know Taylor Swift personally. So I gotta, I gotta kind of, you go With the Chiefs, I gotta, I, you know, I, I don't want to but it, it, you know, all that money in them boxes up there just, you wanna stick around the checks, you know what I mean?


Yeah. I just don't wanna weigh my own or outweigh my chances, but Right. You know, Hey man, good luck to everybody. But at the same time, only one of them done paid me so far. Are you performing or are you in towns for the Super Bowl? Well, I, I'll start my residency tonight at Zoo. Right there, right next door. So I was just coming to say, what's up? I, I still ain't took a shower today, so I'm gonna go ahead and, and do that. I wanna ask you this, lemme ask you this. I've heard you sing and I've heard you sing songs and you didn't have autotune. What made you decide to use autotune when your voice is as good as anything we have.


Because if I would've came out singing, I would've just sounded like everybody else. No, you don't sound like everybody was, It would've just been another voice. Right. You know what I mean? Right. So there's nothing special about it. Like there's people in this crowd that can sing, that can out sing me right now. Do they not? I'm sure there it is. Not in Duke Cinco. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, yeah. You heard that, that new Toby and Toby and Cinco. Why that thing crazy? Nah, but nah, I mean, I would've just been another voice, you know what I mean? Right. Especially, you know, In the rap game, Dark skin dreads wasn't a lot of space for me. You know what I mean? When I came out, had to be light skinned, low haircut, it was a lot going on. I had to be able to dance. I was fat. It was a lot going on. It was had a lot going against me.


Wasn't really working out for me. But no, I I I made it through because there was something different about my voice. You know what I mean? Right. So I, I needed something to break through the fog. I heard the other day you talking about how you wrote a lot of songs or you've been writing songs for country musicians and the credits was kind of getting you in trouble because you was getting some blow back and you was like, man f that just gut me the check. Don't put my name in the cri. Yeah. Nah, it, it wasn't really blow back. It was just like, I don't know what we can say on the show. You good. You good. We rated it r The comments on there was just like, was it the n word? It was a lot of n word. It was a lot of it. It was a bunch. That was primarily the, the word that I saw a lot. Anytime somebody said I had anything to do with this song, they was like, what's this nigga doing on this dog?


Why have you got anything Who do to him? I thought you were a patriot. It was just a lot of that. It was just, it was a But did the check clear? Oh The check always cleared and it cleared own time. That's the crazy thing. Country music. It's very punctual, very punctual checks. You deal with some of these, some of these darker companies, they give you 90 days. Nigga contract says 90 days. We gonna send it in 91. Do you remember when you was growing up and they ask you, they post date, the check? Oh, absolutely. No. Hands up. I put a Friday on there. Don't take your answer. The bank go Thursday. You can just not cash this for me real quick. I'm gonna come back on Tuesday.


I'm gonna let you know. If you can cash it then, but probably don't do it then if it's Wednesday, I'm gonna just cut you another check. I'm gonna come to pay another one because I'm gonna move banks. You see Bank of America? They, they messing me up. See what I'm saying? So I'm gonna move to Chase and I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come right to a Chase one. If that don't work, I'm gonna go then I'm gonna need you to go to Western Union and with Dixie and then we can probably just make it work from there. Yeah. It don't work. It's just too many steps. Too many steps. What you wanna say Ocho? I wanna have a sing off. I wanna have a sing off. I gotta sing tonight. Ing off. I got a You you coming to a residency? Wait, I could, matter of fact, let me perform with you. Come on up there. No, I'm serious. You Have the shortes, you have the shortest residency in Vegas.

What, what was the biggest shift? Because you're talking about a team that was the most penalized offense. Their offensive line wasn't very good. The had, Patrick Mahomes probably got sacked more than he had gotten sacked at any point in time. And then you see the 180 that happened in the playoffs. What would you think was the cause of that? Yeah. Well at times, man, I think, you know, sometimes as coaches it's easy to get caught up in last year and our identity, right? Last year's identity. You know what I mean? As a offensive play caller, right? And so I imagine like New left tackle, new right? Tackle, Tackle. It's it's chemistry, right? Because playing with Pat Mahomes, I had to learn to have an understanding for the feel of the game. I had to understand that he's taking this deep drop because of the way that he sees coverage, right?


Nine 90 Oh oh Joe, oh shit. Bottom. You got other, other One? There's some champagne somewhere. I appreciate y'all.


Yeah Man, thank you so much. Oh my. Oh my goodness guys, you don't even really know how much this means to us. When Ocho and I put this thing together, when I called Doug, he was his agent.

Me and Jamie Horowitz, Jamie's rolling right here somewhere. And And, we met, we met with Doug in, in Ocho. I said, Ocho, I got this idea. He said, I don't even wanna hear no more about it. I'm with you. Huh? Yeah, I said, I said, let me tell you the idea. He said, no, we good. And so this thing has taken off and been better than we ever, ever imagined. And it's because of you.

What y'all wanna talk about? Hey, hey, What's up? What Man did y'all see this, this Drake video going viral when he was playing with his, he was playing with his meat hot stuff like that. How stuff like that get out? I ain't, they trying to show out. See that? And to be honest, to be honest, Drake was showing up. Yeah. Now he was doing it for the light-skinned fellas. Hey, that shit, so that, that, I guess they been lying all time. I don't, I don't know. You see that's what the one thing y'all, y'all dark dudes think that us, y'all light-skinned ain't got nothing to throw.


We throw we can throw too. Y'all ain't I all y'all dark. Think y'all, y'all got, we got some shit too. Hold on man. What that y'all talking? I don't even know. Understand the context. What you talking About? You ain't seen Drake? Drake got a video circulating? Yeah, he put the baby arm out. He, oh man, bro. He dropped. He dropped. I don't know how, but I don't know how, how stuff like that get out. I don't know. Like, I don't know how it get out. He got, maybe he got album, maybe he got an album coming out. Maybe he got no, no, no. If if it, I think it is strategic. But how does it get out? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Accidentally. Yes, because he sending it to a girl. But you And she dropped it. It's sex pics, sexting. Oh, okay. I I, I watch y'all show. I ain't gonna lie. I watch nightcap.

I'm saying that, but that's, that's like revenge porn. You can't do that.


You can get sued. That's probably what, maybe that's why it's strategic. Because if, if you know who did it, you know who you send stuff to and it gets out, then you can sue 'em. But hold on. What I look like suing somebody that got that, that got got $400, what you going to sue 'em for? Right. Su take, Take that little bit. They got, they gotta Learn.
