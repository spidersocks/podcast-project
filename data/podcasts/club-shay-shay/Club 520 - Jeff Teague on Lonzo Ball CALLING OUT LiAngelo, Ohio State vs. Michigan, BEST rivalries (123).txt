Hi everyone, it's Amy Robach. As you know, I've been an open book when it comes to my breast cancer journey. And in a time when so many of our lives are touched by breast cancer in one way or another I'm gonna be sharing my story as well as others, including former Baywatch star, Nicole Egger. As a powerful reminder of the importance of early detection and support, I felt like nobody can do anything for you. This is you and your body. And I very much felt isolated, alone. And then when I decided to start talking about it, the entire community just put their arms around me and reached out to me. People I don't even know, I I, I speak to all the time now, I haven't even met in person yet. Just lifting me up and letting me know I was gonna be okay and telling me their story and really making me feel surrounded and hugged It made all the difference. Listen to the full conversation on Amy and TJ on the iHeartRadio app, apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

That boy dropped. Hey I seen the thing today. Oh me speaking on this topic. I seen the thing today. So Acon a big boy was having an interview right? Acom was talking about having four wives. A big boy was like nigga I can only survive one wife like yeah she be taking my knees And he was like well it's because you ain't African.


We got different attributes. My, the African BC's crazy four the real last he four wives. He's like my wife take all my needs like you int Africa. Nigga that shit had me in tears bro. Four wives I couldn't do it. Bart that's couldn't do it. I ain't got enough in me. But Acco gave Africa power. He can do whatever he want to bro. I'm just saying four wives is vicious bro. That's a lot of women to be dealing with at once bro. That's at least two arguments a day. God damn somebody gonna be unhappy. It probably a smooth combination though.


It probably ain't no arguing. Yeah. And then there's lineages out there so you, you get you learning. 'cause Africa that's what they do out there a lot And you acon like yeah bro you got that kind of bread probably like relax like what you arguing about if if it's that easy bro. Don don't think money always solved the issues with women though because once they feel like they in there with you they they gonna give you some lip. But yeah I think about it. Not saying them girls don't love acon but like a lot of girls issues is like is if stuff is the house taken care of, this taken care of. If you doing all that, what's really the issue? Mm. Because now if he got four wives obviously you know he mess with other girls.


Well yeah but you can't really argue about that. That's would be the biggest arguments with financial and true. But sometimes girls the one of the wives could be jealous 'cause the other one of 'em got a better shot than the other one. Oh well the wives Power Inc. Is crazy.

He probably married one for the shot one because they a hustler one because they a good mom or something. Whatever. Oh yeah. I forgot about the good moms. That nigga he got. I didn't know he had kids. I don know he got kids. Shout to the moms. I decided to know he had kids. I don dunno if he got kids.

But it's like for sure niggas ain't really that ain't they favorite celebrity or Oh hell no. No. Jesus. She's definitely not the top five. Right. Niggas all got aspirations. That's what I'm saying bro. Motherfucker like that. Lizzo had to tell you off the Yeah, but all the reality is Lizzo might be your speed in no offense to Lizzo. She, she probably got a bunch of niggas in her dm. Nah, hell yeah. I works. She got her way. I know she do. And she, you know Lizzo swaggy. But I just, she ain't the first choice bro. Speaking of her, y'all see the string? She was on the wrist but y'all see that? Oh yeah, with she took a shot.

It's just, it's just between them ears. Boy, boy. Yeah. I ain't mad at that. Between ears. Figure it out. I I like the music.


Yeah. You just figure it out. I don't want no smoke. I just, I like the music so this is all like, this is all for y'all be here birthday, we going crazy. We don't, I I will never see these people but the cops not Stream was fired. Man we might, that's probably one of the dopest things I've seen man. For him to have them like this, the type of love and like him having like Kevin hard juicy on there. That shit's fire as hell man. That was the funniest one. Yeah, that was historic man. I like K shit when Kai came on there. Yeah, Kyrie being on there was funny. He was really teaching them how to hoop. That shit was funny as hell. Yeah. Talking about Snake in the pick and roll and show like this nigga. They do not know what you talking about but respect he locked it. For real. For real. Yeah. That's hard though bro. He got all the people to pull up. That's crazy. It is like going on his stream.


Is that like that's the S club? That's the No. Did that make you lit? Like him bringing you on me you lit or he making you lit? I don't know if he really making, he making you, he making a lit motherfucker stay even more relevant. Yeah. He's introducing you to a new audience. You probably couldn't get by yourself because the young kids, this is why I love Kai too. 'cause he tapped in with the youth. Youth and then like motherfuckers like Usher and Chris Brown, all them like the kids don't give a fuck about them. Them is Y fans. Playboy Cardi fans like so I think he brings them like DJ said into that world and turns you up bro. He's actively building something that has a value that most of those people who have been famous and celebrities for a long time can't access by themselves.


Yeah. So basically he playing with a billion dollars. Yeah, for sure. It's a big play. He turned down Kas. I could probably be a billionaire. Yeah. Oh for sure. You see the deal he turned down. Yeah. Yeah. Or 60, right? Yeah. Yeah. He could probably be a billionaire. Well think about it like this. He has 728,000 subscribers that pay literally pay that pay. Yeah. Hell of an asterisk. Yeah because you can have it but that pay consistently every marketing, anytime it's a album coming out. Anytime they want somebody in your face bro, they're going get him a kassana, get her on Kassana. Yeah. This is monthly purchase too. This ain't no just year. That's and the Breakfast Club is Monument.


And I'm not trying to diminish what they did 'cause they were the go-to for our community. He's the go-to for everybody at this point. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. The university like effect that he has is different. So what's the difference between him and speed though? I show speed, speed more speed, more global and more like more fraud should say. Like he's not like does he, I always see him with people but I never like I see Kai, he kind of like interview him and kind of like spend a date with him or whatever. Yeah. Kai's not really a troll. Like Oh speed vitro at a high level bro. Hell yeah. Troll. Yeah he disrespectful but he tapped into that soccer world early that yeah that shit different.


That nigga went to India though bro. And had 10,000 people beating on the hotel door though. Dang. And he was just looking outside like oh they know I'm here now. Yeah, that's hard. People should definitely check out his, he said he was a millionaire at 16. Yeah, that's a fact bro. He said I didn't know what to buy. He used to do like crazy ass and I just know 'cause my nephew used to be in that world but he used to nigga just randomly fuck himself up and go to the hospital and stream from the hospital bro. Man go crazy. Yeah. I don't know like injure itself I don dunno if I'm doing all that, that's mouthing him right? Yeah. That CA little too much. But I just like the fact that they like they're making monumental stuff. Like you look at this episode with Shannon Sharp like bro, nobody else is doing this and they taking this to a totally different level and they own they own stuff.


That's the dope shit about it. You know what's funny? Like he gave no fuck about his interview. Nah. Like I'm like yo. Yeah, like he don't give a damn because and realistic he's probably bigger than him. He is. Oh nah, he is weird but he's like the, he's bigger than Kyle though right? Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Kai's just big like in the nigga. Ooh, I I I wonder if that's the case now. He is though bro. Kai. Yeah. I guess I more that the case now I'm talking about like known though, like yeah known wise kids rock with Exactly. The kids rock with speed more like heavy, heavy and fair. Consume the most content we can watch Kai. 'cause it's like damn Kevin Hart on Kyle, let me at least Drew let me give at least a try for sure. Speed. Don't give a fuck about us bro. Nah, he, this is nigga 18 and under no features.


We crashing out like because Kyle used to do a lot of shit dolo, but then he just like, damn, I might as well just, you know, bring these old niggas in because Kyle only did it. He said it too because Joe button was hating on him. Hmm. So he like, you know all y'all niggas hating on the streamers and all this shit. Lemme bring out niggas into my world and now shit because I don't see Chris Brown and Kevin Hart and 'em streaming like him bro. They just, they ain't gonna do that shit. Nah, but Kyle having Nicki Minaj is crazy bro. He, because I was like, I was obsessed with Nicki Minaj. I was too. She was like high school. One of my favorite music was I used to be in that motherfucker like she's so bad. I remember back when I was single, somebody bought me a shirt her, she was like, this is all you ever talk about.

Well I couldn't put the face build a bitch in Lenox. I couldn't find a face to. That's what I wanted to go. Oh Nick. Nick was raw until I, this is when I kind of took a step back when I was with, damn, what's my boy name? K, y and m We was at Bloomington. Hmm. We went to that concert and I just, the leg to booty ratio threw me off bro. Yeah. I liked her. It got a little od It did bro. I stopped liking her in like 2012.


Yeah. Yeah. I kind of fell back. It's like damn I thought you was, but she was just so pretty though that per that first Pink Friday, I was like in the titties. Yeah. You know what's crazy? Like Ana is getting to the point of like Will Smith fresh prince of cameos a women. Like, he's he's, oh yeah, he's that list. Because I didn't know that little girl Tyler was lit like that. Yeah, Tila is tila, whatever her name is she lit? Yeah. She, he had another little crash out. They used to play volleyball. That rap though? Light skin. Oh my god. She was thick. Damn. I can't think of the name. Her, she rap. Oh my god. If I said her name, y'all know who she was. She said volleyball player. That raps. She used to play volleyball back in the day, but then she turned into a rapper.


She a little light skinned girl. She had like a one head. That's a, that's a tough, yeah. Say fucking transition from volleyball to rapper. Yeah. She she's known though, get that money. She was thinking that she got real skinny Ice spice. Ice Spice. Yeah. She played volleyball. Yeah, played volleyball. She too skinny. Now that motherfucker said she looked like they hate her.

Hi everyone, it's Amy Robach. As you know, I've been an open book when it comes to my breast cancer journey and in a time when so many of our lives are touched by breast cancer in one way or another, I'm gonna be sharing my story as well as others, including former Baywatch star Nicole Egar. As a powerful reminder of the importance of early detection and support, I felt like nobody can do anything for you. This is you and your body and I very much felt isolated, alone. And then when I decided to start talking about it, the entire community just put their arms around me and reached out to me. People I don't even know, I I, I speak to all the time now. I haven't even met in person yet. Just lifting me up and letting me know I was gonna be okay and telling me their story and really making me feel surrounded and hugged it made all the difference.

Nah family you was in top hundred categories so we ain't gonna go that far. We'd be cool rights like random stuff. It ain't ain they asking hundred people.


I wanna know what hundred people they be asking because that'd be some bullshit too. When they said the best rapper of all time, they had some wild names on that list. Boy was Eminem number one was nah I think Snoop, Snoop Dogg was number one. Snoop Dogg El Cool J Yeah. Yeah. Did they ask did Y see what Yeah sidebar. Yeah. How do y'all most I like agree with him though. I can't disagree about what he said. He the goat like he the greatest rapper all time. Like he the most influential rapper. He like everything he said one day they gonna give him as far as because he's really the most influential. But if you think about it he the archetype of of what it is and the business aspect behind it then most definitely, he's not saying he's the best, which we all agree he damn sure ain't.


But I can't. But if you think about it, he the first rapper to sign to Def Jam. He the first rapper to go like global really? And to have like marketing brands behind him. Like even with FUBU and shit. Yeah that nigga had tv. That TV show was fire bro. He had movies early on. Ell cool J was a fucking star. His exact words were he is the most important rapper that ever existed. He broke a lot of grounds, a lot of people to get money. He get revenues. I'm not mad at it think I think he's again he's not the best. By no means let's mean that very clear. Yeah. I don't think he's saying he's the best lyricist. I don't think he's saying he makes the the best hits. I think from a business and growing aspect we wouldn't have like a Drake and nah he, I'm not mad. I'm not mad at that. He the most important rapper. I'm gonna still probably, I'm gonna put some people up there with him.


I'm gonna put Snoop Ice Cube Dre up there with him. You think so? For So I think he kind made it. He came before them though. Snoop, he made it Snoop. Snoop is more famous than LL Cool Dre I'm saying. But he made it okay for Snoop to be Snoop like he came out way before Snoop. Oh if he on some Pioneer shit then Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said he the most important. Oh okay. If if he say he the blueprint he ain't got no beef Real me. Yeah he definitely the blueprint I'll give the bull. And the thing about LL people don't understand is that everything he was rapping around was real shit. Like he wasn't no fake made up. He was a real nigga from the hood. Like yeah he was really outside during that time when they was really doing that type of shit. Like for that nigga to have that show and shit, that show was fire bro. And then even being in the movie, the movies was elite bro.


He made niggas want to get in shape too. I ain't gonna lie. Ain't that nigga in the, he still on TV every day. What's that shit? NCIS some shit. Yeah I'm trying to turn that shit off. Fuck I always on nci him and the other. What's the old light-skinned nigga Tia too People don't talk about bro. Yeah Icet Ice got on back for a long time.

Yeah that nigga Haw Hogan put that nigga headlock, nigga fell out, hit his head. He sued wwe. Why? Why, why so on that wheel for? Because he used to be a talk show host and he was like trying to say wrestling was fake and he was like put me in a headlock and Har Hogan put that nigga in a real headlock.

Har Hogan was strong as fuck. I swear bro. God damn. Look at he, he passed out. Why the color in the video start fading? Shit got wicked. He just dropped it and he hit the back of his head. Head bleeding. Hmm.


Damn. And they just cut to the next shot. Hey rest the crazy as hell bro. Yeah that's whoa. Yeah Hawk Hogan don't like niggas but he got the my favorite tweet of all time that I need a couple mud brother bro. Hilarious bro. Every time I see it he disrespectful. Yeah. Fuck Ho I wanted to ask you, since we talked about the the Lonzo conversation, how was you and Moog relationship like Undertold story? I know y'all both, you know what I'm saying? Y'all be humble about y'all shit. But y'all was both in the league at the same time. Which is the craziest that like that's accomplishment. Like how was your relationship been? It's always been big brother, little brother. I always knew he had a gift.


We knew Marcus was going to the NBA when he was in seventh grade, like eighth grade. So my whole thing was just like, not for him to get satisfied with going to the league, but it's hard to be in the position I was in. I had to work like, you know, I was coming from the bottom trying to get get there when it's already kind of handed to you. I I couldn't put myself in his shoes 'cause not to say he didn't have to work hard. Like obviously he had to work hard but it's different when you always the guy. Yeah. So when you never, when somebody always coming after you, it's a little different. And I grew up always having to go chase Eric Gordon and Derrick Rose and all them. He was them. So when he got to the league it was different.


He didn't know how to chase. He never had to chase. Yeah. I knew how to chase so I knew not playing coming off the bench and stuff. So he went through a different road in the NBA. It was a hard adjustment for him. I mean but he got to a goal. He got, he made it for sure. But it definitely was a different adjustment because he never been in that scenario. Like going to a team and not playing. Yeah I had been there before. He ain't never been there. It's hard adapt than at the highest level. Yeah. Yeah. So especially when you're supposed to be evaluated. Yeah. When you ain't never had that challenge to like have to go through that adversity a little bit. Mm. And then to do it while you making money, that's a tough, like that's tough.


Like I'm making millions of dollars. I'm about to go through this adversity I never been through. It's kind of tough to handle it. Yeah. And then we got two different perspectives. I'm like get in the gym nigga fight like this. You gotta do this, you gotta do this. And he like nigga you had to do that. Like you was sad nigga. I wasn't sad. You know what I mean? Yeah. Essentially like I'm like yo you gonna have to work, stay after the gym, you gotta do this. He like, yeah, yeah but like I'm good nigga you was sad like I'm gonna be all right alright. And then when it didn't happen like that, you know what I mean? And then as he got older he was like damn, you know he started feeling what I was saying, he started working, he went overseas, did his thing. But he just understood that and was like damn, might have been a little too late.


That's a jello effect though. Yeah. He just ain't figured it out yet. He's still like, I'm like you telling Lonzo and Lalo fuck y'all nigga. I know what I'm doing. It's crazy because like even with Lonzo, the fact that Lonzo ball's playing basketball again, like I'm happy to see it as a Lonzo fan but bro he went through a crazy injury process where he could have never hooped again. Real for real. We talk about it like even with the Victor o Depo situation, regardless what happened with the contracts, but that injury ultimately Denver ended his career. So for him to bounce back and he like tell you hey bro I'm fighting this at this. Look where your situation bro. You gotta listen to your bro. I think Lonzo and them are starting to do podcasts and stuff. 'cause I think not to wish bad on anybody, not to be hating or nothing. But I think it's like he can feel it like yeah, yeah it's probably gonna be over for me soon because he gonna, he good enough to probably play a couple more years, you know, get some minimum deals or whatever.


Nobody gonna pay him just 'cause his injury history. Like they're gonna be so scared. But he probably gonna play a couple more years. But I see him starting to build his self outside of basketball. Oh yeah for sure. And it's, it is a cool thing to see but like I was like damn I see why they did the podcast. Yeah. They could feel it because they on there talking business too like so I'm like yeah he's tapping into a different avenue. Yeah. Of setting himself up. Yeah. Just in case. Come on bro. He is daddy's son. Y'all seen LaVar bro. One of the best marketers of all time if you like him or not bro. He did a lot of things in sports that people could never do. Yeah. Whether I be bullshit or accidental. It still work. Yeah he got his kids all set up bro. You can't hate on that facts. He just did it a crazy way that people just didn't bro.


But I'm like shit you love your kids that much. It is. Fuck everybody else kids bro. How he violated Jeffrey Jordan? I like bro your kids are weak bro. And he said your daddy weak too. I play your daddy 1 0 1 killed the, I'm like I had to ask my that bro you gotta turn your shit up bro. Hey I know the last dance was all about MJ career but I wanted him to ask him that question but like hey you a wh ball ball said about you. He probably started laughing. You see how he did Gary Peyton? Nah that nigga was rolling when he seen GP highlight. I ain't never seen Mike laugh at hard. G was like yeah I was flustered nigga. He like ah that's cute. He was so disrespectful Mike funny as hell. Hey another another. You know what I'm saying son that went crazy.


The live not went crazy but who's had a solid career making out nothing. Gary Payton's son. Yeah, yeah. Yeah bro. Got it out the month for sure. Nah, nah he got that GP three. Yeah he definitely having a good career. But you know who son really making a name for himself right now? Scottie Pippen Jones. I was just about to say clip he is, he can really play. I liked him at Vanderbilt. Everybody always said he was a little bit too small but he could score the ball. He did everything at Vanderbilt and he competed defensively and that's now it's starting to show in the NBA. It's dope. What he have 30 in Chicago. Come on bro. About to get paid when it's time. If he keep it up he gonna, he gonna get paid bro. Yeah he gonna be, he's solid bro. That's a steal. Yeah he, he probably that's a steal. He top, he top three backup point guards in the NBA right now.


Yeah easily to check. And like you said that jaw effect bro. The way that team plays bro with Jas around bro it's different bro. That was a great organization for him to go to. Facts. Yeah give people chances bro because he, if he went somewhere else they probably would've got spooky 'cause he probably wouldn't have got that opportunity Like LA he was in LA and didn't get that and some something they coulda used which is crazy the player they need but it's crazy damn crazy how shit work out like that. Yeah shout out. Shout out to Lil Brody, the real shift leader Brody brother have Skype people on his team on his own. Y'all crazy as hell so wrong with y'all.


Hey them niggas is crazy. The NBA is wicked man we gotta go to a Lakers game. Hey man I I bet man Lakers fans has been brutal 'cause Hood Shino bro is getting a tough break out here. They was like man he scored 34 points his whole career. They was like West side Connect got 37 career high hit this nigga off my squad. I'm like bro he ain't even got a chance to even hoop yet man. I knew who this is Wicked bro. So that's a prom example of somebody that shouldn't have went to the league. He was okay at Indiana. He had moments, he was great. I'm not, I shouldn't even say you should have went to the league 'cause who am I to tell you not to turn down? Yeah guarantee millions of dollars. Right. But as far as a basketball player, he just wasn't ready.


Like it's okay. I remember Chris Paul saying this to me like it's cool to go to the league but when you not ready you not gonna play and you gonna be out the league. Yeah I use it as reversed. I'm like oh this nigga don't think I'm good enough. I'm gonna show this nigga kind of thing. But he was right like going to the league and you not ready just to get there and then be out. It is worse than like staying in college and you might go later in the draft or whatever. Yeah but now you got something to fall back on like he just wasn't ready. Yeah now he did one year of school about to be out the league gonna go overseas, do whatever, hopefully get another opportunity where? Somewhere else in the league. But 'cause he, he actually capable player but it's just like damn at 21 it's tough.


It's the real world. Yeah. You know what I mean like crazy. Gotta make sure your mentality is there too. Yeah but you, you'll fall into a sunken place bro. On everything That's facts like 21. You gotta hit the real world. That's crazy. And like you said it is their biggest audition. For real. For real. And that and you in a situation to where you got one of the biggest sports organizations, they all dissatisfied which is they probably calling you ass and tell you terrible. You know LeBron effect don't always help everybody. Yeah. So he got a heel to climb bro. Like I couldn't imagine. Well I have been there, I told you I broke out in house but to get like be in my rookie deal being 2021, however old he is. He right. What? 20. And they telling you you're we're not picking up your option.


Yeah. So make sure you about to be a free agent, you gotta go get it out the mud and really try to figure I've been messed up at 20 you bro because all you know is Ball. I'm like Steph Curry 37, come on bro. Yeah I'm 20, I'm about to be out the league. What I supposed to do? Oh you know it's ball. You can't go coach at 20. Hell nah, hell nah And shit you gotta go overseas and kill because everybody act like just going overseas is easy though. There are people who are overseas who are amazing at basketball. Yeah. Really. Really? And you not gonna go take their job and going overseas at 21 is not, that wasn't the thought process. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like I I don't know if you really prepared for that. That's a huge, huge culture shock let alone going into the league.


Yeah motherfucker go to Zimbabwe, it's ugly boy. You get four wi though. He go, he hoop really gonna be. That's why jf I get it now. Yeah for a while. J Cole Wild Nigga. Hey man, Friday night Lights on DSPs man I had to spin it. Oh man I had to spin it off. The strength bro been playing. I've been playing it all since Friday. That shit is hard though.

The Friday Night Lights, I'm like okay. So I just asked and it just, that shit went crazy. I like Friday night lights better 'cause Detroit to me is a album. Friday night is a album. It was, it was the first album. But I just feel like I don't know bro. Detroit is more the interludes, the I don't know. I just felt Detroit more I. Don't think Detroit got something better than too deep for the intro I had to run. Detroit is an elite project. It is bro. Because it's better than all his other albums.
