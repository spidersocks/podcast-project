Everything is 20% off now ocho, let's get right into it. USC Oh yeah, goes on. Well, Nutri site game. Open it up College weekend. USC Beats LSU. This might be Lincoln Riley's biggest win. There was a lot. You know he's under the gun ocho. Yeah, he was. He was. Especially after last year he was. Yeah. Lincoln Riley has his, has a big win for USC.


It comes in the opener, his third opener, the Trojan's head coach. The game is on a neutral field, but maybe these Trojans are better suited. I like the new edition of Deton Lin. He's the son of my former teammate, Anthony Lin, who's the head coach of the, the charger. That one point in time he's with the 49 ERs last year. And if I'm not mistaken, he might be the OC for the commander. So that's his son and they did an outstanding job the of winning this ball game. Give the the quarterback. Both quarterbacks played well. Miller Moss came in. We saw when Caleb Williams sought out the ball game Ojo, he came in, set a SC record through six touchdowns was named Bolt.


MVP. Yeah, same thing with NUS Meyer because both guys had to wait their turn. Both guys get transferred. It guy Caleb Williams transferred in. Jalen Daniels transferred in, they win Heisman Trophy. So each guy waited their turn. We saw foreshadow what Miller Moss was probably capable of doing in the, in the bowl last year. Right. Where he tossed six touchdowns and he won the bowl. MVP. Yes sir. But what did you like about what you saw Ocho, you saw USC had some terrible losses last year. Yeah, but they get off on a great, on a good foot this year. Well, listen, before the season started, I think both, both coaches were under the gun. I think both coaches were under the gun for the third time in week one of the season.


Brian Kelly has started. Oh, and one to start the season. Obviously last year defense was an issue with Lincoln Riley and USC. Then there were questions coming into this previous season, the quarterbacks two Heisman quarterbacks are gone. Jay Daniels is gone. K Williams is gone. How are the quarterback gonna gonna step up? Obviously we saw Miller Moss last year in the bowl game. Step up when K Williams decided not to play. So you kind of got a small sample size of what to expect. And you saw tonight on the other side of the ball, Garrett Neumeyer played really well. He played really well. Both defenses played really well. We saw a different uc, USC defense as opposed to what we saw last year. Yeah.


Very promising. I think maybe also playing a nutri site made it a look, made it kind of even keel for both teams where one crowd wasn't able to dominate the game and affect the game when either team was on offense. I think LSU, they look good. What I would've liked them to see them do is the way they started the game out getting Kyron lacy the ball. Yeah. Like he was him. I mean he he kind of disappeared the rest of the game. He did. Oh yeah, he Disappeared the rest of the game. You start the game on fire going straight down the field, moving him around. I mean there, there were a couple, couple of penalties where there was, there was some motion, some some motion difficulties. You know, two people moving at the same time.


Yeah. But if he's your best player, you get him the ball, you feature him. Yeah, but listen, either way it was a good game. I I really enjoyed it from both teams. Both teams have two very, very good quarterbacks. I saw at the end of the game, Garrett Meyer, you know, hanging his head looked like he wanted to cry. There's, there's really nothing to cry about, son. Yeah. Nothing to cry about. You. You played one hell of a goddamn game. They need to do a better job of pushing the ball down the field. But that was a heck of a play. I forget his name. Number 10. He had two, one-hand catchers. That second one was really huge. You ate and then He get Target. You saw the one in the middle of The field. Yeah. And then they, and then Ocho, they got him a got it with a targeting. But that was all on the corner because the first of all, you playing cover two, you got, first of all, you funnel the wide receiver in.


If you look, if I'm not mistaken, Ocho Yeah. I don't think they have a offset back. So now there's immediate threat. So now I'm gonna funnel the wide receiver in, but I'm gonna sit back, I'm gonna see, write him all the way out. Yes. Because Write him all the way out. I gotta help my safety because if I let him free release, they're gonna do exactly what they did. He didn't put his hands on him and they hit him with a hold shot. Yes sir. Now your safety is in a bind and he targets him. So now you get half the distance to the goal on top of a 20 yard completion. If he had done what he was supposed to do, funnel him inside, sink back because there's no immediate threat to the flat. Now that's a much, a much more difficult throw to complete.


Yeah, but give Miller Moss credit, give the receiver credit. That is a hell of a throwing catch because you know, as a wide receiver ocho, you know that safety coming. Oh, we coming off that ash now. Oh he, you coming off that Ash And he coming with bad intention. Miller Moss knows Ocho, I gotta get this ball up and I gotta get it down down. Yes sir. Or that's a medicine ball. In other words, the guy gonna come back there, he gonna open the back door to an ambulance and put your ass in it. So that's the medicine that you go, the medicine that you gonna be received. That's the medicine you going to get. But that, that's a lesson. I'm sure, you know, a lot of times it's not like they haven't rehearsed that O ocho sir.


They know in a situation like that. Okay guys, we are playing cover two funnel the guy in, there's no immediate threat. There's no offset back. You just sink. Because I don't don't want him to get that ball up and down in the hole. Right. But that was a great throw. That was a great catch. Great concentration. Give the guy credit. But sc played well and this is why I think Kyron Hudson is his name. That's what we wanted to see from sc. We look, they score 40 and 50 points, but they give it up 45 and 55 points. Yeah. Defense was the issue. So defense was the issue and they, they, they played very, very good defense tonight.


One game, let's see, they're in the big, hey, they're in the Big 10 now, ocho So it's Ball Game now. And you know Ohio State, you know Michigan, you know they can run, they can run mic. Michigan can run the ball. You know, they're gonna try to run the ball. Right. Ohio State has those athletes, they're gonna spread you out. They're gonna throw it. They got an outstanding wide receiver. When does Ohio State not had an outstanding wide receiver? Right. Or why received hers for that matter. But it's gonna be interesting. But you, I I did like what I saw from sc, they did a great job. Miller MAs seems to be the real deal. Played against an SEC. We know what the EC represents. But give to e sc credit, there's a lot of pressure on Lincoln Riley.


He has to get it done. He has to get it done. And listen, listen, With the pressure being on Lincoln Riley, what they showed tonight is a great measuring stick for where they want go. This is what you can build off of. You can build off of this, you can compete against any goddamn body. If he had that kind of offensive production and that type of defensive production that you had tonight, I don't care who you line up across from. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of, You, you play. Like if you play like you played tonight, you gonna be all right unless you're playing Georgia. The thing was though, yo, look, they gave up 421 total yards, but they didn't give up any really big plays. No big plays. So that was the thing. My, they may nuts my check down low, you know.


Hmm. High percentage throws, but they weren't big throws. Right. And so long a, I believe if I don't give you the big play and you have the nickel and dime your way down the field, I believe you, you'll make what they did make a mistake before you get the ball in the end zone. Yes sir. So that's the thing. Most defense is like, hey, as long as we don't give up the chunk plays. Right. I like our chances. If they want to go 15 plays, you are not gonna consistently go 15, 17 plays and get the ball in the end zone. You gonna make a mistake, we gonna get our hands up, we gonna pull one out, something's gonna go wrong. And so that's what a defense is to pride them tell themselves, look guys, as long as we don't give up the big plays, we're gonna be just fine. Make them go the long way.


Make them go 12, 15, 17 plays. It's the one two plays. It's the Tyreek plays that kill you. Yeah. Every time. So sc does it, they win 27 20 over LSU 23 SC number 20, number 20th rank LSU, LSU loses like you mentioned ocho Brian Kelly, the, the, the first games of the season been tough on it. Hey, Hey listen, three years in a row, he starting the season off Oh and one. Yep. He, he, he not getting off on the good foot now. Well look, now you got Oklahoma in that division. Now you got Texas in that division.


You still got Alabama to deal with. You got Georgia, you got Ole Ms. Lane Ke you got Tennessee now. Hey, there ain't no dodging, ain't No off week. Ain't no off. Ain't no hell No. Ain't no off weeks. Nah. You, hey, hey, hey, give us old Vanderbilt. You know we could always got some homecoming game. We got Vanderbilt. Right. Right. They ain't, they gonna be, they gonna be your doctors and your lawyers and your account. They ain't gonna be a whole lot of them ain't gonna be playing on Sunday. So let's get them for homecoming. Will we play Vanderbilt? Mom, you gotta come down here. We got homecoming the first week of September. Yeah, Because you, you put them on the schedule because you gotta put a team on the schedule Ocho, you know you can beat, you got all the alumni coming back and you don't wanna catch no L on no home.


You, you, you can't embarrass yourself. You can't embarrass yourself. Yeah. But again, SC wins 27 20 over LSU Arizona wide. Arizona wide receiver. Woo Ro McMillan Ro McMillan McMill you your name I think Ro Roa Roa Roro Terro. That sounds about right. ROA Illa kicked off his highly anticipated junior season with a record setting night. Nasty. The preseason all American and projected first round pick, nasty set a new school record, 304 receiving yards, four touchdowns on 10 catches in the wild, nasty, excuse me, 61 39 victory over New Mexico.


The 6 5 210 pound wide receiver, Del delivered the first 300 yard performance by a college receiver since Jackson Smith and Jig 3 47 in the Rose Bowl against Utah. Only five other FBS receivers have ever topped 300 yards over the past decade. That's it. That's the mythical number for a wide receiver. Right. It used to be 200 Ocho, not 200 a you gotta get three, you gotta get 3 billion. It Ain't, yeah, it ain't, it ain't nothing. Listen, I think Flipper Anderson in the NFL still holds the record. 3 39 most receiver yards in the game, you know, with 3 39. Yeah. Like you said, a collegiate receiver obviously sometimes, you know, to me, I like to put an asterisk by it.


It's a, it's an amazing feat. It's an amazing feat to do. But I would like to see it done against the elite competition, the better competition. You, you, you, you, you get where I'm going. You, you get where I'm going with this, What you call 'em Hit four oh seven, what's the dude from LA Tech? He hit, he hit, he went to Pittsburgh. Troy? Yeah, he hit 4 0 7. Would that against me competition? Yeah, Yeah, yeah. But like I I, I like it though. Especially what it does is when you put up numbers like that Right. And it raises eyebrows, it raises eyebrows to South Scouts. Absolutely. It raises eyebrows to the NFL, the, the NFL scouts, the gm, the owners.


Well he doing this. But then I I sometimes to look at the competition you're playing against, it is like, ah, we lead against so and so, so after a performance like this, now the pressure's on you to continue be, to be consistent and not put up 300 yard game from this point on. You talking about going first round, squeezing into the, the top 10 pick. Yeah. Being consistent and getting game after game after game. Putting up unbelievable numbers and your stock just rises. Yeah. Your stock just rise. So, young bull, young bull from Arizona. Yeah. He got the opportunity to do something special is to continue being consistent from this point on putting up huge games. Not games, not months of games like this.


But regardless to the competition, you go out there and handle your goddamn business. Well the thing was Ocho, he was already on the radar because he's a preseason all American. Oh yeah. Six five three two hundred and ten pounds. If I'm not mistaken. Ocho I think it was Troy Edwards and I think he did that number on the Nebraska. I think he had 407 yards receiving. Yeah. He ended up going, he ended up getting into the first round. I think the Steeler selected him the 405 yards. He had 405 receiving yards Ocho Woo. What year was this? 98. Because he went in the first round in 99. The Steeler selected, if I'm not mistaken, the Steelers selected him over Jevon Curse.


Whoa. Can you imagine Jevon cur in that three four defense with the Steelers? Boy, hey, you know, he, he would fit perfect too, if you think about it. As opposed to going, as opposed to going to Tennessee. He would've fit perfect Right in that Right, right in that goddamn defense Before he got hurt. People don't realize how good freak was Man, sh Man before he hurt that ankle. Yeah Man. We go down, you go down to a Delphi Coliseum. And, we about Freak. Oh, oh, Joe that big that he started doing it right here on Joe. Yeah.


Hey, hey. That long ass, that long ass wingspan. Dang hell man. Man, listen, I thought, hey, I, I saw, I saw it firsthand. Yeah man. But, and I think Megatron had 3 29 against the Cowboys one year. Yeah. There been a couple of 300 yards. Jimmy Smith hit us up for 2 96 in 2000. He had like 15 catches. Two, six and three touchdowns. Hey, that was Dwayne Stalk. That was, I think that was these stalks and some McCal That hey, he Told everybody up that day. Mark, Hey Mark Brunell and Jimmy was abusing y'all at that Point. Yeah. He, he, he, he to everybody. He tore everybody up that day. Oh yeah, he Did.


Yeah. I remember that game. Alright. Ojo Coach Fry has faced increased media scrutiny lately, but Nick Saban had his back yesterday while on college game day. Looked at the best HBCU game from week one Save and chose to highlight the time what time had done for HBCUs. Well the H-B-C-D-U to me was a conference that gets overlooked a little bit. I think they played some really good football and there's a lot of big game. No one realized the impact Dion had on the Swac. They got huge TV contract, which has now enabled them to upgrade their facilities, their program as well. Provide better opportunities for their players to develop people and students and have better careers as football players.


What you think Ojo, I mean, is is is a dope thing? It is a great thing. I think. I don't think people, I think people do understand, especially those that are part of the, part of the culture, part of the HBCU culture. Alumni, former players, obviously people but like us understand the effect that Dionne had being at Jackson State and, and some of the things that they would be able to, they they were able to reap as far as from a benefit concerned. And I think they are overlooked. I think they are overlooked. Overlooked. But it's one of the one thing that I always say, and I've always said it and I tell a lot of players that it really doesn't matter where you go to school.


If you make, if you make enough noise, if you really him, if you really him or really who you supposed to be or really who you think you are, it doesn't matter where you go. It's what you do. Once you get there, it will find you. That's it. They will find you if you put it on film, they're gonna find you. If you're really that good then you should stand out on film. When you stand out on film, it's easy to find you. But if you blending like everybody else and you just a number, then that's that. That's the difference. Well, you gonna Have to stand out Now. You think it's something that you're not, You're gonna have to stand out for. The simple fact scouts are not coming scouting these schools. Like they go Michigan, Alabama, Georgia, and so forth and so. Right. So you're gonna have to stand out.


You got to. And so when you're at that, you are gonna have to be a shark and a pawn or, or or whale as we say Moby Dick. You need to be Moby Dick. Yeah. And you need to be playing amongst Minnows. And so when you do that, now all of a sudden you had no tension. You had no choice but to see Jerry Rice, you had no choice but to see Walter Peyton. You had no choice but to see Steve McNair or Shannon Sharpe or Michael Strahan. We left you no choice. You had no choice. Yeah. But to come down and say, well hold on. I gotta see what's causing all this RTUs. Yeah. I heard about these guys, but I need to see it for myself. Yeah. I I tell people all the time, like you guys and those names you just named, it's not about what they were playing, it's about what they were doing where they were at.


Once that film was rolling, once you turn that film on, it's 11, it's 11 players on the field. Yep. It's easy. It's easy to catch the eye of a scout. It's easy to catch the eye of a GM if you really, who you think you are on that field. Yep. It's just the, the product is gonna sell itself. Right. Sell. You ain't gotta do nothing else. I always hear dude talk about, man, I want to go to man, I want to go to Florida State, man, I want go to Florida, I wanna go to Alabama. But if you can't get it done at the little school you at, if you not shouting at the little school you at what you gonna do when you get to the big, the big stage, it's gonna Be tough. Yeah, for sure. It's gonna be tough.


You remember Shaquille Leonard went to South Carolina State. They had that game. They played Clemson National televised game. He has 23 tackles. Yeah. Hold on. 23 tackles. Who is this? He playing Clemson. He at South Carolina State and he all over the field. Who, Who was this? Yeah, That's like them Small. Listen them small schools. This is anybody that might be in the chat watching when the small schools, when you, when when, when the big PWI schools, you know how they do the schedule? Yeah. And they have, you know they have the HBCU small example. If you go to fa MU right now and you know y'all got the Miami hurricanes coming up with all the hype, with all the hoopla.

I think they won the NIA championship. Okay.


We got Georgia Southern. Those are two games. Okay. Georgia Southern Good. They were good back then too. They had won the division, won double a championship like three, four times. Yeah. They were still doing that same, so They, they were like, they were like, they were the equivalent of what North Dakota State is. They were like the North Dakota state. Okay, Okay, okay, Okay, okay. That's what they were. So I was like okay, these are two games. We go to Elon, they in Burlington, North Carolina Sim for 2 21 2 touches. Yeah. Lemme Get that. Go to Georgia. I get nine two in a touchdown. Okay. Yeah. Nah, come. Hey now the bowl game. East, west Shrine game. Mr. Sharp. We, we love for you to play in the, the bowl game.


They invited you. Yeah. They had no choice. They aint got no, you ain't got no choice. You got to come see me. All I need to know. Oh, he the best. We, my sophomore year we played Central Florida. Yes sir. And they got a wide receiver. Everybody talking about it. If I'm not mistaken, he ended up getting drafted in the third round. And I remember Coach Davis, I was like Coach Davis like, hey, they got a good receiver down there. There gonna be some scouts down there. Yes Sir. Okay. There be scout down there like NFL. Like NFL because I ain't, we didn't really have no whole lot of scouts. We didn't have a whole lot of people that as I got, you know, people that were, they were looking at. I was like okay, I'm a sophomore, I'm a true sophomore.


All I know they wasn't talking about him after the game. They was talking about that number two A a bill. Who was that? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. All I need. Can They come to see you happen? No they're not. It can happen. That's it. And that's how you have to approach it, don't you? Yeah. I never thought, I never looked at myself as inferior. I don't give a damn why you went to school. That ain't got nothing to do with me. Right. You might have got better coaching, more coaches because you know, you got a, a safety coach, you got a corner coach, you got outside linebacker inside linebacker. Right. A DN coach. You got all those coaches running back. Hell out. We had one coach. He coaching everything. He officer coordinator running back coach, but wide receiver coach he all that.


But guess what? When I get them hell and shoulder pass. Oh yeah. Okay. We gonna see now And, we gonna see Hey, hey I, this them game them games that are so important. Unc. I I I know I just, I hate hearing the young, I hate to hearing the young bulls say, you know, I wanna go to the big schools and all that. Sometimes you don't, you're not afforded the same opportunities as everybody else. Nah. Again, I'm, I will say it to you man. It's not where you go. It's what you do once you get there. Yeah. They will find you. They if you played under underneath the motherfucking rock. I'm telling you the GM and Scouts will find you. Yeah. If you put it on film, they gonna find you when you're playing against the big schools.


Show out. I mean this. Yeah, you got, you show out. It's the only example I can think of right now. 'cause I know the schedule by hard fam U Boy. If you're Rattler in this chat, I'm telling you, when you play against the hurricanes after what they just did the, the goddamn Florida last week and you wanna be on the radar. Yeah. From April y'all might be the, y'all might beat us, but I'm gonna beat y'all. Sh y'all might be the, Hey guess what Ocho, once I got in the start of line up, I kept lie PWI tied ends on the bench. Yes sir. Could none of them come beat me out for that job? Yeah. Damn. That's crazy. Yeah. I ain't getting this up. It's not for you.

Or when they kicked that thing off when they beat Nebraska and, and and what in the national championship game? They ain't look back. They ain't look back. You know, they had that run and then the nineties kind of, you know, little lean and then who they came back in 2000, 2000.


Boy. Nasty. Nasty. They should have kept Larry Coker, but, oh well, Larry, Oh Joe, great news. Yeah. The 49 ERs announced. Rookie wide receiver Ricky Parasol was released from the hospital today. Yay. We also got an update from his mom, Aaron, who said the bullet entered his chest and exited out his back without hitting any vital organs. She added that he's extremely lucky. The San Francisco police Department confirmed that Piol was shot through the chest in a robbery attempt over Rolex. He was headed to signing an event, excuse me, a Gary, mark, Gary and Market. There was a struggle for the gun.


Both Ricky and the suspect were shot. Damn. That's scary man. Man, do you know how that's Scary? You know, and I was, I was reading some of the comments too. You know, some people, you know. Yeah. Like I, I I don't listen, I I'm reading some of the comments. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking I would like to know where y'all are from, what environment you grew up in to have a better understanding of how fickle life is. Yeah. You think That environment think it's a cartoon. You, you think it's a cartoon. You think it's a video game? I'm just, I I have a different type of understanding based on the surroundings and the circumstance I come from. Yeah. So I understand people that move like that. I already know what their intentions are.


'cause it's a liar will steal a someone that's steal will kill. Yeah. Ain't no do overs, huh? Yeah, ain't no Duke. Oh lemme take my glasses off. There are no do-overs. This ain't no video game. This ain't call of duty. You don't get a second chance at this shit if you, if you die young Bull Ricky is lucky, bro. Extremely. You lucky. And I see some people, oh, if I had my stuff on who? I ain't finna give my stuff up to nobody. What? I ain't put myself in that situation. You know Ocho you gotta move a certain way. I'm from Atlanta but I ain't going downtown iced out. Right, right. Why am I gonna invite that and I get it.


It's my stuff and I should be able to wear what I wanna wear, how I wanna wear it. But nah, it ain't like that because you got those guys out there. Hey, look here man, that dude's 17. He really to throw, he willing, he, he was willing at 17 to throw it all the way. All the way. He had nothing to lose. People that are willing to rob and still have nothing to lose. Somebody that has nothing to lose will do away with your life. Nope. And not think twice about it. No. And you that young and you carrying that fire, that stick on you man. You don't care nothing about no life. You already think your life effed up. That's why you doing it. You ain't think, you don't think that you got anything ahead of you to live for.


You don't care nothing about mama. You don't care nothing about grandma. You don't care nothing about nothing At all. So at all, when you dealing with somebody that the worst thing you can do is to have a person that don't believe they have hope. Mm. Because if he don't believe he has hope, what does he have to lose? You see if a person, and I, and I said this before, Ocho, if a person is living in hell, he don't care about going back. Oof. So you dealing with somebody that got no hope. I got no way out. Right. If I ain't got no way out, I don't give a damn about taking you out. Yeah. At all. I just did. And I'm gonna deal with the consequences.


I'm gonna deal with the consequences. It's, it's sad that, that, that that people feel that they don't have a way out. I don't believe, you know, they, you're never too old to, to be in a situation where that's your moment and things change around completely. Oh yeah. I mean you look at some of the guys that became billionaires and how old they were. They were in their thirties. They were in their forties. Somehow we feel that if you ain't successful, if you ain't making 175,000, $200,000 by the age of 22, you'll fail your life. Man. Y'all need to stop this. Y'all have set somehow society has set such, set such unrealistic expectations. Yeah. On what is success or successful.


Right. And people have bought it. Man, my life. Man. What? Man, what am I doing wrong bro? How are you 27? Man? Man, I'm trying, I'm trying to hit a lick like you bro. In 27 A lick, Bro. You, you, you probably just got outta school. You probably been outta school three years. Yeah. And so you expect to step right in and start making millions. There's situations like that. But those are anomalies guys. Yeah. Yeah. And the funny thing, social media, it enhances everything. It magnifies everything. Yes. It gives the false sense of reality that life is really like that. That ain't real life. No it ain't. There's there's 1% that's really living like that bullshit you see on Instagrams.


Yes. 1% and those that ain't living it, that's pretending to do it and doing it the fast way. It's temporary. Yeah. It don't last long. It come and every play ain't gonna always hit. No it's not. You gonna take some Ls. Slow motion. Slow motion. Better than no motion at all. Yeah. You ain't got to be stunting all the time. As long as you continuously moving forward. It might be slow, but long as you ain't stagnant, you good. Keep stacking them. Yeah. Keep stacking 'em. Even if they might be small when it's small, small still stack up just like big. Yeah. You ain't got to be out there. I mean, sometimes you gotta get it how you live.


Sometimes you gotta eat, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. I understand that. Like I come from that. I ain't do that, but I come from that so I understand. Right. But come on, come on man. And I just, I didn't, I didn't like some of the comments. The people trying to be all tough. Oh man, I'm gonna wear my shit. Somebody try to come rob me and I, I do this, I'll do that. Man, stop man. Man, them boys will knock your head off your shoulder. Stop playing man. Man look. You talking about Them. Talk About what you going do. Oh boy. Look here man. Them Joey hit you.

Even on that side of, of, of the ball obviously. Even though we didn't, we didn't play that side. But, but still, no, there was a reason behind something happening. There was a reason behind it.

Ocho Marquis Brown, one of the chief's biggest off season edition will not play Thursday night season. Open against the Ravens coach Andy Reese said Hollywood won't be back this week, but we'll see how it goes. But the kid is amazing. I mean, yeah, he's progressing and has been incredible, but I wouldn't predict him being there this week. Brown dislocated his shoulder against the chiefs first offensive player of the preseason. The chiefs will still have Xavier worthy, their first round pick. Rashe Weiss Rice, the leading receiver, and they resigned. Juju Smith Schuster. He was there. I remember he won the Sue Bolo Cho, then he got that big contract from the cheese, but seemingly couldn't find, he couldn't stay healthy. Couldn't find his niche there.


Cho. Who you like, who you like, who you like in this game? I mean, listen, chiefs obviously chiefs, obviously I'm, I'm kind of sad, I'm kind of sad. Goddamn Hollywood Brown won't be able to play. I think he has a grade one AC sprain. I mean, they say separated shoulder, but if you watch the play, you know, and I hate when people dive on you when they tackle you and they drive you into the Ground, drive you dirt. Yep. And yeah, I hate it. He probably got a grade one, grade two acpr. So I'm, I'm sure he'll be back next week. But I mean, chiefs, chiefs, I'm, I'm curious, I'm curious to see what they're gonna look like offensively. I'm curious to see how things open up for Travis Kel because you had that speed and worthy and you know it's gonna be, you know, it's gonna be funny.


Even though he's the fastest recorded combine, draft runner defensive coordinators are gonna say and be very egotistical. Well, you gonna have to show me, you still a rookie. You gonna to prove yourself. You gonna nobody, you, You, you gonna have to, you gonna have to show me that we have to adjust our defense because of your speed. Matter of fact, you know what? We got corners. We feel and get up there and press you. You gonna have to show us. Hell, you could be goddamn man to man upfront. You gonna have to show me. So I'm curious to see what that offense is gonna look like. Obviously they still have Rashe Rice, some other pieces. Travis Kel gonna do what Travis Kel does.


So I'm, I'm curious to, I'm curious to see what they look like this year. And I think they're, they're going to do what they, what they need to do to win. And They still got that boy back there. Oh yeah. One five. Listen, I I I ain't even have to mention him because, because You don't already know. He gonna do what he do. Do what he do every time. Yeah, I Agree. The moment is ne the moment is never too big for 15 boy. Yeah. They're probably gonna try to run the football. They got Derrick, the Ravens have Derrick Henry. Now play action should be, we're gonna see, because the chief defense last year, that kind of, that's really what won them. Hey, spas was on fire. Boy man. CJ Think CJ think the personnel, the personnel that Spas had allowed him to do some of the things he did, he did.


Losing luxurious sne. Yeah. Ken McDuffy filling the same role and do the same things that Steve Dug did. Well To allow Spag To be as aggressive as he wants to. McDuffy was the number one, McDuffy was the first team all pro. Yeah, but he ain't listen. No, But see what it was though is that you had two of them. Right. So now we could, because you know, spags like to heat you up. Yeah. I Could heat you up. 'cause I got two guys that I believe that can hold their own. Yeah. Now are you gonna be, that's, that's, you know, a lot of times when you got CJ Kaus Yeah. They, they got some pressure and remember one of their past rushers, he Torre ACL against the Ravens in the championship game.


He didn't play in the Super Bowl. Oh. Number 91. Number 90. I forgot his name. I forgot his name. Yeah, yeah. So I know you're talking about Yeah, you showed did. It's Gonna be interesting to see if he's back. They bring some pieces back. But defensively we, it is gonna be interesting to see. I'm anxious to see how the Ravens, how they use Derrick Henry play action off of it. You know, Zay Flowers take that next step. Bateman Bateman. Yeah. Yeah. You get Andrew Andrews, you got likely. I wonder how they gonna do that. I just thought about that. They got like, likely had a hell of a season last year when an, when Mark Andrews went down absolutely mean obviously Andrew, Andrew Andrews is that dude, I just can't see them having likely on the bench like that.


Nah, you run a double lot of double tight end. You probably, hey, you run two tight ends, right? Two, two wide receivers in in a back. Mm. Yeah. I mean, hey, let's just go play Bully ball. Yeah. But again, it, it is still, it's still a, it's still a pass Happy league. It's still a pass Happy league. What happened to the Ravens go down 14. What happened? They go down 14. You can't sit back there and say, oh, we gonna run the ball and have 14, 15 play drives. Right. And you gotta put that motherfucking air. Right. Well that's what you try to do. I don't, I don't wanna see that. I don't wanna see that happen. I don't wanna see them week one go into a hole trying to establish the run. That's what they try. That's what you try to do to the Ravens. You try to put them behind the eight ball.


Yeah. Try to take Lamar's legs out of it and not let him dictate. You want to dictate. It's a lot easier said than done. Yeah. It's, but he's proven he's gotten incrementally better year after year of throwing the football. That's, Yeah. So it's a lot more than it was in the beginning ocho. Right. But still, I, I like You still are, you're more fearful. I guarantee you as any defensive coordinator, they're still more fearful of his legs than his arm. Oh yeah. Most definitely. But I, I like how he's evolved though over the years. Obviously we always talk about, oh, he's a runner, he's a runner, he's a runner, he's a runner. This, yes, he's a runner, but the past two years, especially last year when he had chances to run instead of run, he'll sit there and pat it.


He'll sit in the pocket and be patient. He'll want to throw before he runs as opposed to running when read number one's not there. I done, see, I done seen two or three times I done seen God, Lamar Jackson get back there, get the ball and go through his progression. 1, 2, 3. Okay, that ain't open. Let me go back to one. Okay. One still ain there. Okay, now I'm gonna run as opposed to I'm locking in on one person, you know, year one, a year two. Right. If that one person ain't there and I feel pressure, man, I'm peace sign. I'm getting up outta here. Yeah, he's definitely evolved. He's definitely gotten better. So it's gonna be interesting. This what they need. They got a big, a big bat. Ke Mitchell, he tore the, he was playing really well.


Yeah. Hey, That he cut boy fast as hell. You know, his brother played with, I mean his dad played with me in Cincinnati. Yeah. Mitch, he played with me. He was with me and Okay. He ran that Mitch, he ran the, that block field go back in the divisional round against the Titans. Yeah, Anthony. Okay. The athletic released, recently released a polled agent. Recently Polled agent. Okay. Okay. The athletic recently polled agents on the best run franchises and the most unstable franchises. The best run franchises we're gonna do the top five. Eagles got five votes along with the 49 ERs. The chiefs got four votes, the Packers got three votes.


Vikings, Steelers, Ravens, dolphins each got two. Okay. When they said anonymous age of praise, the 49 ERs, you have to fit within their culture. They allow players and employees to be themselves and they win. Even while getting staff poached by every team every year, the way they treat people, they don't skimp on expenses. Highly professional eagles every year. Free agents wants to go there, they reward their players. gm, Harry Roseman mailed the draft. What an organized group with football in front off visits every year. They're at the top of their game. Most unstable. Okay. Let's do, do you agree with that list Ocho?


The, the the stable list? Yes. Well, absolutely. Absolutely. And, and based on the stable list outside the Vikings, you look at the teams, either teams that are winning consistently, obviously Miami, I'm looking at Miami. Miami is revamped, remind me, Miami's revamped, you know, Mike McDaniels tours in there, the supporting cast that they do have, they've been winning as of late Chiefs Green Bay, obviously Eagles, Howie Rose. How is the fucking, I don't know what, I don't know what they doing over there. Obviously the 49 ERs, they have a, a tradition of winning Steelers tradition of winning. So this, this is, it's, it's kind of self-explanatory when you, when you look at it and, and you can see why Now we go to the most unstable franchises.


Number one Panthers, number two, Raiders and Tide Jets, Jags, Cowboys, and Cardinals with three votes each. Damn. My Broncos made the list. That ain't good. And the Commanders got one though. But for the Cowboys to be on the list with the Jets, Jags and Cardinals, that ain't good. Yeah, I mean, listen, the Cowboys, I like what it says there. Cowboys, I don't think they wanna win above all. So that, that's on Jerry Jones because winning stars all the way from the top. Look at all the other teams. The Hunts, God damnit, Who that you talking about?


Family run businesses. Yeah, fan, yeah. Team that You look at Win Look the Steelers, the Steelers, the Rooney, the Steelers, The Rooney. They've been at it for since 1933. Listen, It starts from the top. Yep. It starts from the top. The Cowboys. I don't think Jerry wants to win. Above all, he wants to turn, make profits and headlines. I think the game has passed him by, wherever that quote came from, speaks volumes. Wherever that quote came from, it needs to be in Jerry's world on the goddamn big screen so he can see it. He needs to see it because that's exactly how he runs the business. Which is why he's on the list of the most, one of the most unstable franchises, despite the success that they have in the regular season.


And I feel bad for the coaches, I feel bad for the staff, I feel bad for everyone else that's walking on eggshells that can't tell Jerry, you need to take a back seat. You need to sit down. You need to stop talking. You need to get him in front of the camera. Allow your players to play. Allow your coaches to coach. Let Mike McCarthy do what he wants to do. Take the leash off of him. Take the rans off the reigns off of him. Let him. But if I did, if I did that ocho, he gonna get the credit. Didn't I tell you want the credit? I told you. Oh, so you heard me in the press conference say I want the credit. That's the problem. That's the problem. I mean the other team o other teams that are on this list, this, the Broncos haven't been good since Manny left. True. The Jets, they've been in disarray since God.


Joe Namath, the Cardinals. Hell, the Cardinals in me. Good. And goddamn Kurt Warner, the Raiders. Ah, Okay. This is what they said about the path Panther Ocho organizational sta stability come from the owner and the front office need more time than David Tepper, who's the owner gives a strong quarterback, can keep a team viable regardless of the front office. But what's the plan? The Raiders, the owner Mark David frequently make significant changes. He put Josh McDaniels and Dave Ziglar in charge and fired them after two seasons. Now the Raiders have an inexperienced coach and Antonio Pierce, a re-Air General manager and Tom Esco organization stocks at the top.


And Davis doesn't provide stability. Cowboys, I don't think they want to win. Above all, Jerry wants to turn profits and make headlines. The game. I think the game is passed. And by It has, it has. We already know. We already know owner's bottom line is always making a dollar. Yeah. That's the business that we're in. It's, it's the, the, the business of making money. We know that. But you don't have to be front and center about it. You don't have to just throw it in our face. That's what it's all about. You know, man, put your, put your snake in cowboy. Put your snake, your snake skin cowboy boots on your snake skin belt. Get your cowboy hat. Take a back seat.


Take a back seat. No, I guarantee you, I guarantee you the year Jerry says, you know what, I'm gonna try something different for a change. I'm gonna try something different for a change. I'm gonna sit back, I'm gonna relax, I'm gonna let the team run itself. I'm gonna let the product and the star on the helmet. I'm gonna let it sell itself. You know, remember Blue Magic? Yeah. Remember you saw American gangster did Blue Magic. Yeah. Denzel ain't have to do nothing to Blue Magic. Blue Magic sold itself. That's the Cowboys. I don't think Jerry understand that. Jerry don't understand that. You don't have to do nothing, man. There's a reason you worth 9 billion. I'm not sure how much I'm, I'm not sure how, how many more billions than than the rest of the teams.


He ain't gotta do nothing, Man. Well, he's the most, he's, he's the most, he's the most his franchise. He owns the most valuable franchise in pro sports. More more than the Yankees. More than a PSG. No more than real Madrid. Madrid. More than FC Barcelona. You name a sports franchise. Yeah. And the cowboys are worth more than them. What does that tell you? What does that tell you? But nah, Ocho you Don't listen. You don't need, you don't need to be in front and center like Pop I Do. That was the problem. I somebody that's gonna get the credit. Nah, nah Did tell that. How many ways I gotta tell you.


Listen, sometimes we get in the way of ourselves doing things we don't need to do. Pablo Escobar had no, no reason to run for political office. Jerry Jones has no reason to be in front of the goddamn camera all the damn time. You ain't played one snap. You ain't played one down. No disrespect. And that was a horrible analogy, but I'm sure Chad understand where I'm coming from About Jerry. Yeah. I mean this is a horrible analogy. But, but, But the, the thing is though, I couldn't, I couldn't think of nothing else to say. But here's the thing. What Jerry, there's a reason why if you look at him, he has success with Jimmy. Jimmy got the credit.


What about me? I own the team. Even though Jimmy, even though Jimmy is the coach, he's coaching it. He can't do anything without me. So I want some of the credit. They Where's the money going? Jimmy? Jimmy, where's The money going? Because Remember Who cares? Where's the money? Who's getting the money? When he brought the team, what was the first thing that he did? Ocho the first thing he did when he bought the team, He, he fired so and so. What's name He fired? Tom Landry. Yeah, the mythical. He ain't gonna be bigger than Tom. So even if I bring a new coach in, I'm gonna be bigger than him because now Jimmy start winning. Oh Yeah.


How about them cowboys? They ain't got no camera on him. They got, they carry on Jimmy. They got Emmy, they got the guys messing up Jimmy's hair. Jimmy's talking. You think, you think Jerry Jones gonna address the team before they hit the field? Yeah. You think he gonna trade draw to the team? Before Jim, before Jimmy. Jimmy having that Jimmy old school myself, damn sure ain't having it. So now like, you know what, let me go get these other coaches where I can do whatever I want. I can emasculate them. I can cut the legs out because if I got a problem player got a problem with a coach, guess what? He gonna talk to Jerry. Right. Well once that happens, it's over.


Because once a child, what do kids do once they know they can circumvent one parent? Once I know I can circumvent my coach Right Now I got, I can play, I can play kids or play one, one parent against the other, won't they? Oh, Joe, Mike saying don't go ahead. What you wanna say? Nah, Nah, I was just, I said damn, because I used to, I used to do that with my grandma and my granddaddy. Nah, whenever they said no. Oh, I, I only listen. Grandma say no, I'm going straight to my granddaddy.


He was, he gonna say Yeah, Because you know what gonna happen. You going ask granddaddy do you Barney I done, I told them boys no. Oh Lord Mercy. Why? You had to tell why? Oh, them was some good days man. None. It wasn't no good day. You got a tore up hand. You mean to tell me your your granite done told you no and y'all come back. You coming to me, you trying to get me in trouble. I ain't even, I don't even want to go now. Yeah, I'm sorry as, but see they pushed me up 'cause I was the youngest so he wasn't gonna be as harsh.
