You guys, Pamela Anderson attended the Golden Globe Awards Without makeup. I saw that. Y'all Seen that? I saw that. She's been doing, doing that. Been doing. Yeah. Yeah. That's her thing. So it, it definitely sparked the conversation in the beauty world. Like, is this the new trend? I feel like it was something great because we're so used to just throwing on so much makeup and we think that is what defines us as a woman.


That is the beauty. But it's not, I mean, I'm, I'm a prime example of it. I feel like I'm only cute when I throw on the makeup. Really? Do you feel like? And cover up the freckles. You Only cute F so Beautiful. Sometimes I feel like that. I feel like, dang, I look ugly. I need to go put on some makeup. But that's just, that's the mindset we have put out in the world. So big shout out to Pamela Anderson for, for doing that and, and reminding women that it's okay to be seen and show the world that you have natural beauty. That you're beautiful. So, And to age gracefully. And that age is okay. And looking your age is okay. Absolutely. That's, yeah. Especially like in Hollywood, you know, like, I'm sure she's probably, she's like a unicorn.


Like they're not doing that. Right. Everybody's trying to figure out like the fountain of youth really. That's like absolutely. What doctor do I go to? What procedure do I need? What Right. Makeup artist. What hair? Right. Extension. Like everything that you need to make yourself look like something. And she's really, you know, sending out a different message. And I love that. I think that's amazing. Alicia Keys. She does the whole no make up thing Too. Yeah. No lashes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She, That, that's who really got me in, like, introduced me to that really that balls, you know what I mean? The balls, the confidence of like, you know what, I don't need this. I can go out there. My voice is what everyone wants to hear. I wanna not wear makeup.


I'm like being a tomboy. I'm really just getting into the makeup low key. My daughters are the ones that are very much girly, very much into like, showing me what to do. And so like for them to be put on a pedestal, meaning like celebrities to always be glammed up, always be ready, be on. Yeah. I think it's admirable for, you know, Pamela Anderson who was like a sex symbol, you know, with Baywatch to be like, you know what, I'm just gonna bear it all. This is who I really am. Yeah. And without all of this, this is who I am as Pamela Anderson. So we, we, we shout out to her being a humble batty like that, you know, I'ma I'm gonna take it back because last week before my best friend came, Ashley.


Ashley, you can testify to this Uhoh. Last week I was looking like a mo rat. I was looking sick. A mora a mora Ashley. Tell the truth. I mean, I wouldn't have said Mo Mo, I was just said, you know, The la I needed the lashes. The lashes. They did. Yeah. They Needed it. Donate. They were a little Sparse. They were a little sparse. Ashley was, No, we was at the house getting our lashes done at like one o'clock in the morning. Yeah. That's how Ashley you pulled out the massage Was I was like, yeah, no. I was like, yeah. Yeah. Set the table up. I set Feel The emergency Emergency. Yeah. Get the lashes. Yeah. Gigi lives three and a half hours away from us. Yeah. And we was like, we can't keep on going.


I was shout out to Gigi. Ashley was fine. No, I needed them too. Bitch, You, but but you were, I was looking horrible. I was, it was like I was here. She did Us good. All I know is we needed that. Shout Out to Gigi. Shout Out to Gigi in these beautiful lashes. Shout out to Gigg. Thank You. But don't y'all feel like you, like, once your lashes are On, I feel like a new person. You feel better. Right? New person. Listen, the was popping, the skin was glowing. I'm like, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I got my eyebrows done. Yeah, I see that. You know, they got 'em touched up. They shout to my best friend. So that's Like your, your go-to is like the brow. If the brow and the lash is on it, then I'm Good. And a little lip gloss A little. So my thing is like, I'm cool with the whole glam thing, but you just gotta make sure like you're taking care of what's under it.


So like, I'm cool with the glam, like wear your makeup full glam, but make sure you take care of your skin. You know what I mean? I'm cool with the wigs and the weaves and the extensions. But make sure you're taking care of like your natural hair under it. You know what what I mean? That's right. Like I think, you know, you just, there has to be a balance for everything. And I think that's, you know, that's the balance. Like if you're gonna spend all that money on the hair, also spend the money on the hair care. Yes. You know what I mean? I agree with that though. My question to you guys, back to Pamela Anderson. Yes. Her going on the red carpet without makeup, would y'all attend a big award ceremony on No, that's not. I'm about that life.


I would actually, you're, you are beautiful, natural. Yeah, I can Do that at home. But if I'm gonna a big event, no bitch. I wanna have like all the glam, all the makeup, the big ass dress, the heels, like everything. Bitch, I'm finna come to motherfucking shy bitch. Yes. You wanna show up And show up. Yes. I'm gonna give it, give it all I'm give leave. I'm So you have given it for 10 years straight. You gave, gave, gave on the red carpet. Would you ever do a day, a day a time walking the red carpet with no makeup? Yeah, I probably would. Yeah. If I was, if I was already done all the red carpets and I've done all the events and Yeah.


Yeah. I could see myself doing that. Yeah. I would. There there's a time where I was just like, it was, it is a chore for me. Like, I feel like, ah, I gotta get my makeup done. Ah, I'd rather, because y'all know me, I'll show up with nothing on and just be fine with it. Yeah. Going back to what you said, Ashley, taking care of your skin. Right. It's a priority for me. You know, making sure my skin stays, Your skin be looking like a baby. But butter Lickable, you know what I'm saying? Ooh. I might have to Look at them legs. But it's, I like, I was, I I have to make sure when I get my makeup done, I have to take off my makeup. Yes. At night. You know, it's just, I feel like I'm a little claustrophobic sometimes, but Can you believe some people I'm getting used to it, sleep With makeup and they for two to three days.


Yeah. No, I can't do that. They do. Some people I'm guilty of it. It's like they wanna save their eye makeup. I'm guilty of it. So they'll like sleep in it. Girl, They'll sleep in your makeup. Girl. I, I'm guilty of it. I got, I like, get home late and just girl. No, look up the lashes on The no. Kill a case. I can't, I can't. I know. Clean my face. It's horrible. What I'm saying is some people will keep that same face on Saturday, Friday night. No, that's just nasty. If they're end Saturday night and sometimes Sunday night, That's just nasty. That's nasty. A three Time layer. That's just hygiene, I think at that point. Yeah. And laziness. That's nasty. That's different. But I mean, I, I'm, I mean, I don't like go about my everyday life and like glam, like makeup.


Like I'm very much, you know, no makeup. Like I dress like a boy most of the time, like at home. You know what I mean? So I think, you Know, I like, I like both sides of it. I like, I agree. I honestly don't like wearing makeup. I feel, I feel like it's too much on my face. And I feel like makeup adds like five to 10 years on me. Mm. I love seeing makeup. Like Ages you a Little bit. Like Ages. Not a little, it ages. Well That's what you feel. You feel like it Ages you. Yes, it does. Because people be like, dang, you look in your, you look like you in your fifties, bitch, I'm only 37. Like, no. Well, but bring it down a notch. But when I'm, when I don't have makeup, it's like, oh, you look like you're in your late twenties.


Yeah. It's 'cause of your freckles. They're very youthful. I love that. That's great. Yes. That they Are, they're I do. Yeah. It Is. I ain't got no damn freckles. So I'm gonna be putting on this makeup for whatever I Got to be. You don't need it, boo. You don't need it. I remember this one time at, actually, speaking of major carpets, it was during the Met Gala. I was so nervous because they, everything has to be approved PR prior from your hair, your makeup to what you're wearing, what your guest is wearing. Everything for What, what is this For the Met Gala. Oh yeah. That happens in May. And So you, they almost wanna test run of what you're coming out with to make sure you're on theme to make sure you're on top of it.


So like that pressure is on another level and then you turn around. Yeah. And you see all these cameras and you see all of these, you know, everyone's doing these live interviews, So you wanna be on point. And then at the same time you turn around and like, you know, everyone is on, everybody is like, you know, like performing and showing up and being honest. So I feel like it's like low key makeup can be like a mask to like almost cover blemishes, like, you know, internal and physical blemishes. But at the same time it's like people can, they're kind of hiding behind that, you know what I mean? Of this glam of the big hair, the big lashes, the makeup.


And really, who are you underneath That? I think it's art though. I think, I don't think it covers up. I think for majority it's art. It just enhance the beauty. It's, it's, it's a show. Like you don't Yes. It's a show. When you enhance, especially for Matt Gala, you're enhancing the beauty. You, you're being extra. So Absolutely. Very much extra. See, to see your pictures from when you went to the Met Gala girl. Show us the picture. We gotta pull Them. We we gonna judge send us the pictures. We gonna have, we gonna see if, if Thank you Lex. I hope met. You did as well, girl. You showed up and showed out. Have you Have to, we let you have to, we gonna let you know.


We gonna let you, we Have to. Well, y'all, speaking of Pamela Anderson and her being such a hot girl, I have some other hot girl headline news. Okay. Okay. Hot girl. Headline news. So let's talk about Simone Biles. Mm. She's been in the headlines lately. She's contemplating going back to the, the Olympics in 2028. Let me read what she said exactly. She said, I'm at a point in my career where I'm humble enough to know when to be done. And she said that it would be greedy for her to return to the, to the Olympics in 2028 because there's almost nothing left for her to do. Ooh.


I think that's, you know, first of all, obviously very humble of her because that is humble. She is like one of the most, well she is the most decorated gymnast and she's a ban history. She is a band. Yeah. A badass motherfucker. Got y'all standing Over here, y'all. She totally Is. She is the bamp right now. You know, she is. She really Is. She's an amazing woman. And to know, you know, that she's accomplished so much and she realizes that, you know, I've done what I needed to do. Yes. And I think, you know, it's great that she can take that self-reflection and, you know, give somebody else an opportunity to shine.


Absolutely. She doesn't feel like she can get any higher in this, in this space. So maybe it's time for her to move on into a different space. And I, I feel like she's also focusing on herself, her mental health. Yes. Like taking care of herself. Because when you devote so much time to be at the top, to be the goat of your sport, you don't, you're not taking time out for yourself internally. Your, your mindset and everything because you're so focusing on. And also it probably Absolutely, probably so much pressure too. It Is. Yes. You Know, like, what if you don't perform like you did four years ago? What if, you know. Absolutely. And you know, the world is, these people are crazy. They're, they're micromanaging every little thing that she does. You Can't having nuance one mess up. Absolutely.


And I got see her out supporting her. Man. She's going to the game. She can be a wife. She's a, She's a wa A waag. I love it. She showing up. She's showing up for her. Man. That's beautiful. So what do you guys think about that? I feel like, you know, in our lives there are times where we have to take a step back on and self reflect and, you know, make decisions where we feel like, you know, we need to move on to another space. Like we've done everything we could do in this realm. I know like Sherell, you and like the real estate industry, you opened up your brokerage, but now you're onto like developing. Is that, is that, would you say a time where you felt like you needed to move on in a different space? In that p in that sp specific topic?


I would say it was more of growth. But I have a prime example where I felt like I needed to pull back. And I went to my leadership. I was a E seven. I had soldiers. I said my mind is all fucked up. I just did two tours to Afghanistan. Yeah. I'm hurt, I'm injured if I'm not right, I can't train my soldiers to be right. Facts. It's time for me to step back because I don't want to lead them down the wrong path. They're looking up to me. So at that point, when I went to my doctor, when I was talking to my therapist, I told them I ha I can't do this anymore. Yeah. It's not right. I'm failing my soldiers if I continue to stay in and just stay in for the time. And the paycheck Is like very mature of you. Very like intuitive of you.


Absolutely. You know, to be able to like really just look within and realize how you, you can affect other people it and know that it's a, it's time for you to move to a different space. Yeah. Because you go through so much and you'll know your mindset is not the same. You don't have the same drive as you had. This was for me, I didn't have the same drive as I had before and I had to reevaluate myself. I was like, I'm only failing my soldiers if I continue to stay for a paycheck. Right, Right. Smart. And you not, you can be your best self. Exactly. Way to pivot. For sure. Thank you. Absolutely. Okay, so Lex, what about you? Like how do you know when it's time for you to like move forward?


Well sometimes it's really outta your hands. Low key. Mine was outta my hands to shift my, really, my family dynamics during my divorce for example. Okay. Outta my hands. Meaning like now I had to learn how to budget differently. I had to learn how to really run my household differently. I had to learn what it is that, what it is for me to thrive and to really have a source of income and really just depend on Alexis and get my mental health together. Really just really focus on getting back to who I am in self. So sometimes you just don't have a choice. Sometimes you have no, you have no choice.


Yeah. And so it was like, you know what, now I have to pick it up. I need to figure this out. I need to put my big girl panties on and say, you know what, okay, now it's time for me to like catapult into where I need to be into my essence. You know what I'm saying? 'cause we naturally go into the state of survivor mode. That's It. So it's like while you're in survivor mode, you still fucked up. Yes. Mentally. Yes. And you don't even know it because you're fighting for everything else and everyone else. Yes. At a point you gonna break down. So you have to pull back and say I gotta take care of myself. Yes. And that was my main priority. I felt like I was almost just like numb, you know what I mean? Kind of just kind of going through the motions of things and just letting things go.


But then it turned into like being proactive. Yeah. And really much like harnessing, it's Like phases to it. It is phases. Yeah. It is phases. And I learned to give myself grace. I really learned how to be patient, you know what I mean? And not have this instant gratification of now, now, now long-term goals. Make sure in short term too. But at the same time it really just put a adjustment on me of where it is that I need to be and how I can be the most productive. Alexis. Yeah. And you did that Shit. Thank you. You did a Good job. You proud of You yourself. And I'm feel like I'm still going too. Yeah, of course. You know of it's constant. It is. It's constant work. It's constant reevaluation and recalibrating and yeah.


Figuring things out. That's life. Life is just a constant evolution and growth and Yeah. But you did That shit. Thank you. What about you Ashley? Yes. Lose shit. I mean, I think for me there was a big shift, I would say when Phil retired because, you know, we were doing life a certain way that I was in control of everything. You know, I was in control of home and how we did things, how I raised our son, you know, what he ate, what he drank when he went to bed, what he did, what he wore, everything. You know what I mean? And then, you know, there's a lot of talk about when the guys retire and it's a lot about him and not so much about, you know, the woman, the wife or girlfriend, whoever at home.


And so I was prepared for him, but I wasn't prepared for like, the adjustment that I needed to make. Right. And so for me, I think I was in a space of, you know, just thinking I had everything in control and I knew that you Had a system going. I had a system going and I felt like if I wanted my marriage to survive the retirement, which you know, everybody knows that's right. Statistic that, you know, once they retire, your marriage goes down the drain. You know, I knew that I had to make a shift. And so for me it was, it was that it was shifting, you know, the way I think about things, the way I make decisions, the way I just do my everyday things.


So, so it wasn't something that I, like you said, I was basically forced to do to do that. But Yeah. But you did very well. And look at you doing I'm still doing it. Child, every day, Every Day. You killing, getting on each other's nerves. He's on my side. I applaud you and Phil. I do. We spoke about this. When was that? The other day We were talking about like everything. Yes. How we going? We gonna redo the wedding and everything. Oh yes. Yes they are. Y'all compliment each other. So it's like y'all brothers and sisters, y'all get along something. We family, We for real family black lives. Yeah. No for real. Love It. It's beautiful to be on that wave. It's true, authentic love.

Okay. Number two. Your friend posts the worst photos of you on their feed. Mm. Didn't ask. I don't like that. Didn't warn you. I don't like that. And didn't, definitely didn't choose you. Choose your good angles. What's the move block? Unfollow or mute? I mute that bitch. It would never happen to me because first I, oh, I say no to pictures anyway. And if one of my friends who I call a friend post, they know not to post no picture of me. And I'm looking crazy. So if your ass ever do that, one of my close friends, The haters be Hating. I'm gonna block your ass. They Really do. They really do. You gotta, I feel like you gotta like, give everybody the airbrush or you gotta give everybody a light tap or something.


You know? It's the equal opportunity. All my friends, We look out for each other like we ain't finna post no picture looking crazy. Yeah. No, I, I don't have to worry about that. It's like the approval. You're like, yeah, do you approve this? Is this cool with Y'all? Do y'all be reposting pictures though? Like if it's a ugly picture and they posted it and you know they didn't mean no harm, but it's just a ugly ass picture. No, but I ain't gonna be posting picture. But I tell People quick if I ain't looking right or I don't wanna take no Picture, take the shit down. No, I'm not taking a picture. So you won't have it to even post. You'll be like, this is not an option. No, no ma'am. They may think I'm crazy stink, whatever. No, I'm not taking a picture. I'm not in the mood taking picture. So it's a blocker Unfollow or a mute. I mute. I'll mute somebody real quick. It like you look at me wrong bitch.


I'm a mute your ass. Damn. For real. But mu muting is good for your mental Yeah, I think it is. I meet people all the time, Every day. I don't even know how to mute people. I'll show you. Yeah, well I we'll show you how to mute. Will it let them know that it's mental? Muted Them? I don't know. I don't know if it, if it do, but it don't matter. I don't Think it does. But I'm Quick to block people now. Different. I don't block nobody. I want the, I want them to see, I want them to see It be fake pages though. It ain't the real people. I Don't give a damn. I'm quick. I don't give a damn. I want them To see everything and they come back around with a whole new page. The Real says she be blocking the bots. I sure do. I Don't care. I want them to see everything. I just don't wanna see them. I'm Like, But when they're desperate they gonna go create a whole nother page.


I don't give a damn. Exactly. That's the, so it's pointless to block them then. People Have time. Do they Do? You might as well just let them look from na dumb ass fake page. The first one.
