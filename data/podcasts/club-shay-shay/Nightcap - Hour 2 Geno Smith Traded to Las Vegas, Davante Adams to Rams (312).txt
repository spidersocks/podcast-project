Well the Raiders have traded for Gino Smith reuniting him with Pete Carroll, the Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas gave up a 2025 third round pick 92 over offer Smith. The deal ends his six year stint in Seattle where he revived his career and became a two-time pro selection. Smith has one year left on his contract at $31 million. The Raiders are taking on all $31 million of that. It's, it is a surp. It's surprising that the Seahawks are blowing this thing all up. Ocho considering they were ten seven last year, gone. DK gone. Tyler Lockett gone. What's going on Ocho?

7:
Hey listen, I, what if I knew the answer, I'd tell you, You know, I don't understand what they're doing, especially based off what they did last year. They, they win 10 and seven, but I'm assuming front office GM ownership, they have a feeling that they can find better production elsewhere. But I don't understand how you have to have, you have to have a veteran presence for one. You got to have su a a superstar. I know obviously it's a team game. It's not like basketball where you have a Luca And You know you have a LeBron ain. But, but one you need a quarterback. You not getting nothing done without that. So the only person left right now in Jackson Smith. JS I'm gonna just say JSN 'cause I I stayed

2:
Jackson Smith and Jig book.

7:
Yeah, yeah. I I stayed butchering a young bull name. And so you got JSNI know he's sitting there like that fresh Prince meme with fresh with Will Smith just sitting in the middle of the house and the house is empty. Yeah, that's it.

2:
Who, who, who, who gonna throw me the ball?

7:
Man. Listen. And that's the most important part. Especially if you're serious about winning. If you're serious about winning, especially coming off a 10 to seven season. So listen, hands my roll.

2:
Well this was a, this was a methodical process. This happened in 2013.

7:
Wait to who?

2:
When Seattle didn't give that ball to beast mode. Oh that into Seattle because they started dismantling ocho piece by piece. Cam leaves, cha leaves, Bennett leaves every piece. Shem leaves, Earl leaves. Earl leaves. Yeah. Boom. There's no more legion of boom.

7:
That

2:
Was now those receivers, they start to, what was the one that what? 89, what's his name? B Doug Bald Baldwin.

7:
Doug Baldwin. Oh we have some nice,

2:
He starts the leak lot. Boom boom. And you see Ocho systematically beast mold gone, Russ gone piece by piece.

7:
It's the nature. Here we are. It's the nature of the Venice. It's a slow leak And you never notice it until all the water's gone. Yep. And that's exactly what they hit. Now all the water is gone And you got one dude standing up. Well this is what y'all left.

2:
Oh. And and remember they ended up letting her be wags go. Malcolm Smith gone. Yeah,

7:
They did let Bobby go down to the commanders. Yeah. That's crazy.

2:
So that was, that was the beginning of the end. I used to have a podcast. A podcast called Mild and Off. And I'll never forget it. Ojo. I said it that that was a Sunday. I went up, I said, they'll never be the same. I said, it's over. Never gonna be the same. You were right. They're not gonna believe. They're not gonna believe. They're not gonna believe they're not gonna trust Pete anymore. And Pete and them had a tendency, they threw the ball down near on 100% of the time. In that situation where three receivers on the field, they didn't break tendency.

7:
They

2:
Had to break tendency. Yeah. Sometimes you have to scout yourself. I mean we would always, after every so often we take time to scout ourself. Ocho in this formation. We're 80% of this. We've gotta break tendencies. Right. In this formation. We're 90% of this in this formation. We throw the ball a hundred percent of the time. We gotta run it. Some guys you got to, sometimes you have to scout yourself And you don't want to have to do it after something catastrophic has happened.

7:
Yeah,

2:
Probably. They go back and look at it man, that three receiver said woman man, we throw the ball And you run that. The moment, the moment that slot receiver is pressed, you got a audible.

7:
Yeah. I mean li listen

2:
Because, because because he's not gonna be able to push up field to make the corner the outside guy bubble. He has to make him bubble. If he don't make him bubble ocho, he has a straight line and he gonna beat your guy to the ball

7:
Every time.

2:
Every once you saw, 'cause normally you see because when you get a formation like that, one guy needs to be off and one guy needs to be pressed to make sure you don't get picked.

7:
Right.

2:
That's why if you notice a lot of times they're like, Hey, one of us got a press, one of us play off so we don't get picked. Well if you go back and look, Butler was off. Brandon Browner was in the slot. Yeah.

7:
He pressed. Yep. I would've came off of that so fast. And understanding. What was Brandon Browner? Strength being right up. Being right up. Oh

2:
Yeah. Oh Joe, first of all, you already in the tight a line. Where are you gonna go? Right. Run into the tackle. He knows that you gotta push up.

7:
Yep.

2:
Because how many times you think he saw that when he was in Seattle?

7:
Come on now.

2:
So now Slot has press. He doesn't get off. Butler

7:
Right there

2:
Doesn't have to bubble. Everything went well. 'cause Ocho more times than not, he don't, the guys ain't catching that ball. Ocho. That's point blank. Think about it. Think about how close that was because they're only one. So as, let's just say and Russell take a three step drop. So that's only six yards and Russell is firing the ball. He's coming this way and the ball's coming that way and he catches it. He catches it.

7:
Yeah. That's crazy.

2:
It is. But Seattle, I hope y'all guys know what y'all doing. 'cause that division, I don't think, I think it, it all gonna be contingent on what happens with a Purdy. I'm sure they're gonna try to get him done. The Rams look good. They got Devonte now they got Puka, they got Kyron Williams Stafford is back. They got a defense. Defense is really, really good.

7:
Hey You know how difficult it is to go from, well Cooper cut, Cooper cut hasn't been released and hasn't been traded yet. What happen if they keep cut but they can't with that cap number right, with that number? Huh? You know how hard take pay cut? You know how hard it is to go from one route runner to another that just that just as good if not better in bringing Davante Adams Rams in in the right type of system. Man, it's finna be beautiful over there.

2:
Davante Adams Rams is headed to Southern Southern California. Ain't a two year deal worth 46 million. 23 million. He got 26 million guaranteed. Adam was a rising in LA as the Ram prepared to part ways from former Triple Crown winner Cooper Cup Ocho You like this move?

7:
Absolutely. The funny, the funny thing I talked, I talked about it earlier in the show. You lose a Cooper Cup, one of the best route runners of all time, a triple crown, not too far removed from that Triple crown I might add. Then you get KU comes outta nowhere, they put him in the positions in which they used to put Cooper Cup in and he's just that good. He's good. You can play on the outside. He can play on the outside big fast. I mean he's not blazing fast, but he's right fast enough. And then, okay, now you're losing a cup And you are able to go get Davante Adams Rams. Have we seen Davante Adams Rams before? I'm not, not the one with New York jet. Not that one. Not the one with Las Vegas Raiders where they didn't use him the right way. But one, we still get it done because I saw flashes of brilliance and what we're used to seeing from Davante Adams Rams when he was at Green Bay.

7:
Man, he gonna be, he might have a little resurgence. That's what I like to call it. You got your money. So there there, there's no reason for them not to use you offensively put you in the same positions that they put Cooper Cup. You can run the same exact routes, you can get open. You don't need help. One of the few receivers in the NFLI don't need veh scheme me open, tell me what you want me to do and lemme show you. Watch me go do it. He's surgical with them feet in there. Oh

2:
Yeah, for sure.

7:
Oh he,

2:
If I, I like this matchup and he has a guy that can get in the football, he can put, he can put the, he can put the football in places that's gonna give you a chance to run because that's the difference is that a lot of guys can hit you. But can you hit me with the ability to run then I don't have to break my Stride pattern. Yeah. You look at what the way Joe throws Chase. Chase catch the ball. He just, just take off.

7:
He can do so much when he got the ball in his hands. Yeah. Anytime you can throw a receiver, a five yard out, a slant a hitch and there's a chance that they might go hit the head off the goal post. Yep. Man, stop plan.

2:
Yeah. And you look at, like I said, we've talked about Deceivers, You know you got McDuffy in Kansas City, he coming up in a couple years old Joe.

7:
Yeah.

2:
Got stingy. They're gonna have to see Stingy. Yeah. So we, I I don't know if Sauce has done anything. I maybe they go go probably have to do something with Sauce here shortly.

7:
Yeah.

2:
But I, I like to move. I I like Tay going to the ra, the the Rams.

7:
Yeah, I do. I like it a lot. Especially, especially the offense. The offense is not gonna miss a beat. Oh,

2:
Joe Warren Sap, our boy spoke about the unanimous NFL coaching coach talking about Shadu. Let's take a listen what SAP had to say

9:
And then we talking about a quarterback coach who's not a decision maker. Wants to make that call about our quarterback gt. Yeah dog. I've been working for the last 48 hours to get his name. If I get his name, oh buddy, we gonna do a deep dive into his life. He, he gonna wish he never did. If you're not a decision maker, shut up. And if he doesn't understand what it is to be the baby of a family like that come, he has all Bucky and, and Shiloh's strengths and his sister and none of their weaknesses. He's the day walker. I'm working.

7:
I'll tell G you cut it for you

2:
And you ain't gonna find no more loyal guy to sap. Thank you baby. I've been knowing SAP for a minute And anytime you call and answer the same, I answer the phone the same way. What the hell you want Sap Man, I told, I told, I told such and such that you was gonna say that way. I said yeah, I'm always gonna say that, but he's right. I mean look it it, and it's always happened at some point in time or you there gonna be somebody, I don't like the way he tied his shoes. I don't like the way he didn't hustle on this plate. I mean that's the whole job of the combine. The combine. Chad, stay with me for just a second. The combine job isn't to build you up, it's to break you down.

2:
It's to tell you about all your flaws and why you shouldn't go where you go. You not fast enough. He's not big enough. The point of attack, he gets lost in he, You know, his transition isn't good. He's not good with his eyes. He is not good with his hands. Oh, his arms are too short. You know what I'm saying? Ojo, he don't play with a low center of gravity. They telling you all the things. The guy tell me what he can do. Dammit. Yeah, because I gotta take somebody out here. So what can they do? You telling me everything that he can do I need something. Tell me what he can do and then we can go from there.

7:
Yeah. And listen, the the combine is a trip. I I I know it's about, You know, your measurables, your intangibles and all those things. How fast, how far you can jump, how how far you can, You know, do all these things To me, unc, the, the, the, the, the combine really doesn't matter. I think that's why some people choose not to do it and they wait till they do their pro day because what can you do when you turn on the film? That's what I wanna see. If I was the scout, if I was the gm, if I was the owner, let me see your film. I don't care what you could do in shorts because the game of football at the highest level kids done played in the shorts and a t-shirt. It's just not, it's just not now. You know, watching, when you're watching you run and do drills. Yeah, that's all cute, You know, that's cool.

7:
But in instruction environment, yeah. Something to play in and be in productive. You ain't running them drills like that Uhuh at, at all. Tell your sis tell sissy. Hold on, hold on, on tell Sissy to cut, cut you some watermelon.

Tell till I said now tell them now 'cause daddy's working. Okay. And if they say, but

2:
That's the thing though, OCHO Huh? But but, but that's the thing. I mean, I promise you Chad, I know y'all don't wanna believe this, but the greater the athlete, the more arrogant and the more confident that that individual is. He believe it's, it don't stay. He believe he can walk on water. He believes he can park the Red Sea. He believes he can. He he can heal the sick. That's the mentality that you have to have. Do you understand?

7:
They don't. They

2:
Don't. So you think a lot, a lot of times when it comes down to, to players, to individuals, the talent is not that much different. It's the mindset in which they display that talent. Yeah,

7:
It is. I don't think people understand that. Now. I think this is where people get confused too. Huh? When you think about players that are elite, the first thing they'll say, well, Tom Brady wasn't cut cocky. Tom Brady wasn't arrogant. May I? That's that's why on the outside, on the outside looking, I wish people actually knew them. Not the max that they put on when it's time to talk in front of their camera. I about knew them. You feel me? Man, there's a reason why they're so great. There's a reason.

2:
Believe what, when people talk about Michael Jordan, what they say that Joe compete in everything he don't like to lose. Yeah. The great players bubby. Brita beat John Elwell on his pool table. John sold the pool table. That's what Graves do, man. I'm telling you aren't Joe. Hey John sold the pool table, huh? Yep. Yeah. I mean that, that's what Tom said, right?

2:
Hey, y'all, y'all remember when, what was it? The play gate and they had some messages and they leaked Tom messages. What'd he say? I'm playing the best football in my life. Hey p on his last legs, he about to be done. Right? I said, what you think Kobe thought? You thought Kobe. Kobe thought he was like the rest of the guys in the NBA. Yeah. You think LeBron James actually think he's like the rest of the guys? You think Jordan Magic Bird? Do you think the entrepreneurs, the actors. So you think Denzel think he's just like any other actor? Is that what you think? Viola Davis think Meryl Stre. They just like anybody else, stop it.

2:
Stop it. You think Dr. Neil tro You think James Andrews Anderson. You think they just, they they think they're just like any other orthopedic Really? Is that what y'all think? Y'all don't think that, y'all don't think that it's a mindset

7:
And you got to have it to be successful.

2:
Yes.

7:
Got to have it.

2:
And that's what I when people, people, what's the I I I don't know. I don't know what they, I i I just know 'em how they treat me. And most time athletes treat other athletes well. I mean, hey, a a such and such man, my mom is here. Can you, can you meet my mom? Can you meet my dad? Can you meet my, okay, sure. But you gotta have that, you gotta have a belief that I'm a bad mofo.

7:
Got to.

2:
I believe I'm the baddest. That's the mindset. You have to have to be great. The greater you are, the bigger your ego, the greater you are, regardless of what you do. Let it be sports. Let it be entertainment. The greater you are, the bigger the ego. Yeah.

7:
Every time.

2:
So with that being said, and look, I I what? So what do want, what what do want the man to say? He don't believe he is good. He don't believe he can turn a franchise around. I mean, I, I'm trying, I I help me understand little Joe. What is he supposed to say, right? That I don't believe? Yes. I went to, I went to the HBCU turned that program around. Look at it. We are on, we are 80 SPN we are on E-S-P-N-I, if I'm not mistaken. I think they might've had college game day down there one day. Yep. Okay. I go to Colorado. Remember what Colorado was before we got there. Turn

7:
Him around.

2:
Turn that around. So why should I believe I can't have that same level of impact or influence on an NFL team?

7:
You got to have that kind of confidence. You got to,

2:
Who goes into something thinking man, I might fail. Well that what's gonna happen? You already done put that bull drive in your head.

7:
Well, most of the time, You know, a lot of people want you to be humble that it makes 'em uncomfortable.

2:
No, because you have fears that don't mean that's I fear what you fear just because you afraid to be successful. Right? You afraid to follow your dreams. You try to poopoo on mine. You try to, oh, oh, you think you better? No, you was good but you didn't think you were good enough. I think I'm good enough. I don't need to be better. I just need to be good enough. Now what? Now you mad at me because I'm living out my dream? Yep. I followed my passion. You didn't follow yours. You let somebody talk, you trick you outta your spot, man. You can't do that. You can't go there. You can't be this.

2:
And you believed them.

7:
It happens all the time.

2:
I listened to the one when people told me, Shannon, I couldn't go to college. And if you go to college, you can't go to the NFL. If you NFL, you just gonna be a guy. I listened to the one person that when everybody's told me what I couldn't do, I listened to the one person that told me what I could do. Me.

7:
Because

2:
At the end of the day, what you telling me? So what impact are you gonna have? Are you gonna catch passes? Are you gonna block, are you gonna run these routes? Are you going to get in front of this camera five times a week for Nightcap first take and come up? Are you gonna be able to do all this? No, you're not. So why would I, why, why the f am I listening to you man? Please. As a matter of fact, now that I think about it, you watching me? Why the hell would I listen to you? You watching those that can do those that can't talk about those that can't?

7:
Mm.

2:
I wish

7:
You I liked that one. I like that one.

2:
I ain't tell you nothing I couldn't do, did it? Mm. But I'm not finna let you tell me just because you didn't do, just because you didn't follow your dreams, you didn't follow what you wanted to do. And somebody talked you out of that. Why would I ever listen to you? Do you understand where I came from? Even if I don't, oh Joe, if I don't accomplish anything else in my life, I am a huge success by any stretch of the imagination. That's if I don't accomplish anything else. If my, if something unforeseen, God said, well Shannon, my faithful servant, come on home.

2:
Can't nobody tell Shannon Sharp he wasn't a success. Can't nobody tell my family? No. Can't nobody tell my kids my loved ones. Anybody can't nobody tell Shannon Sharp wasn't a success. Right? Because they saw where she came from and they saw where he ended up. See, a lot of times people measure success by what you did. You measure success by overcoming what you thought you couldn't do. So all, every time, hey, it got hard. It was cold. That's all right. My grandma used to always tell no matter what happened and it was got bad at time, my grandma say, boy it take all that to make a man.

2:
Hmm. Marty, Mary Porter said, we raised men. Don't make no excuses. I don't make no excuse. I get it done. Get the job done, or I'm gonna do the best I'm gonna give you every, if I couldn't, if I didn't get it done, You know Shannon put everything he could into it. He just didn't get it done. But I agree with sap. I don't know why, but I, and I, but I told Timem this, I said time it ain't, it's about you. See they couldn't find flaws with you. So they take it out on your son. You know what I'm saying? Don't your yeah guy, guys that were older than me, they couldn't bully my brother.

2:
So they tried to bully me. I ain't no easy win. You ain't trying to get no rep off me, my brother. Hey, you couldn't bully him that you gonna try to bully his brother that's three years younger. I pick up something and bust hell at you.

7:
Hey,

2:
It is what it is. Whatcha talking about, man, you don Ont fight fair. What? It's a fight. Dumb, dumb. A fight is not, I don't know. Last time I, have you ever seen a street fight that was sanctioned if they got a governing body for street bikes?

7:
Nope. Hey, You know,

2:
A brick, a chair,

7:
Anything first, whatever can get your hands on them. And the funny thing about it, You know, prime has your do prime got your door already ready for this. Yes.

2:
You've been dealing with it whole life. Haven't

7:
Been deal with it his whole life because the who his father is. So I'm, I'm sure he is right. Yeah, I know it doesn't bother him. He he, he gonna be all right though. He gonna be all right. And I hope he does exactly what he said he gonna do and stands on business by the comments that he made.

2:
Oh, not joining us fresh off a big, big contract. I'm gonna be, let me, let me hold or something. Lemme, lemme take pay back and what have OA did I pronounce that right?

9:
Oa.

2:
Oa. Yes. Oa.

9:
Yep. It's good to be here. Thank you guys for having me.

2:
No, thank you for that. Congratulations on the deal. You seemingly really came into your own this year doing a great job of attacking the run, put collapse in the pocket, getting to the quarterback. What was different this year than in years past?

9:
I think just more experience, You know what I mean? Just, just getting more reps and then more opportunity. This the most that I've ever played, the most that I've ever gotten. The roster passer. So I feel like just having more looks at it, more chances at it is just always gonna allow me to be better. You feel me? Because it copycat league, you're getting the same blocks over and over. So the game starts to slow down a little bit. I can like start to play the game within a game a little bit more.

2:
Well, considering that you went up against, for the last three years, you went up against one of the greater guards in NFL history and Zack Martin. So a lot. I can imagine what those one oh ones and that 9 0 7 and that team setting was like Yeah because it kind of prepared you And you had to feel, man, if I can get off a block against Zack Martin, none of you other guys got a chance. If I can beat him on a one-on-one pass rush, you guys don't have a chance. Is that what you were thinking

9:
Bro? Literally, I mean, like, You know, on Sunday I know that the best guys that I went against all week, he just right there to my left. Yeah. The way, so I don't really have to worry about anybody else. Like I know that, and people ask me like, who's the best guy that you've ever gone against? I'm like, that's a, I go against him every day. So Zach is a legend. So yeah, I got so much respect for him. He is definitely, definitely helped me sharpen all of my tools since I've been in the league.

7:
Listen, what, what factors influence your decision to commit to the Cowboys long term?

9:
You know, I definitely love my team. Okay. Yeah. You feel me? The routine and, and being in Dallas and everything that I have set up out here is conducive to the what I got going on. Right. That's part of the reason why I'm in this position to be able to get more money anyways, so

7:
For sure.

9:
So I think that's just as valuable as more money, You know? And I feel like with that being the case or, and, and trying to like chase more for the sake of more like, You know what I mean? Because it's like you can always just try and get a little bit more just like try and, and, and get like every dollar that you possibly, right. Like, You know what I mean? I, I just, I, it was a very good deal bro. Like, and, and I was happy with it. Like it was life changing money. Like

7:
Most definitely, most definitely.

9:
I got to like moms is good forever. Yeah.

2:
Right. And you in Texas, no state taxes. Yeah. So the money that you might've gotten, let's just say for the sake of argument, you got an extra $10 million over the life of the contract somewhere else, you gonna save that in state taxes by not having state taxes there. So for me, I'm looking at your O osa is that, what can I, what can I do with 80 million that I need to be able to do with 90 million?

9:
That's what I'm saying that like, yeah. Wasn't open or close any doors, bro. Like once you're already in the realm of life changing generational wealth, like right. It like, You know what I mean? It doesn't really move the needle for how, for how I'm gonna be living my life or what I can't do. So I know I'm smart enough, I got good people around me that are gonna be able to help me make more money on, on that off the field. Just I'm, you feel me? We're set.

7:
Yeah. Hey listen, when, when you, when you get a, when you get a contract of this magnitude, right? You already had personal goals before you got it, you have team goals as a whole. Now that you've gotten the contract, have your personal goals changed? Not at all. Are they still the same?

9:
I mean still chasing greatness, brother, still things? Yeah, like I haven't reached the level that I feel like I'm capable of yet in terms of my play, in terms of, of being at the very top of the league and, and, and reaching that pinnacle. So, and Super Bowl, obviously like team wise, like we haven't, we haven't touched any of those. So there's, that's still all out there to play for like now that the money is out of the way, it is just all the things that you love about football and the competitive aspect of it and just trying to be great. Now

2:
What happened?

7:
Oh,

2:
I was gonna ask what, what happened this year

9:
Lot, Bro. Like, I mean between injuries, like having, having new d coordinator, those growing pains at the beginning. Just, just a lot of things happened bro, throughout the course of the season. A lot of things that nobody could really control. I feel like the things that we could control as far as like attitude and approach and just, and just still competing to the very end. I feel like we, we did what we needed to do there and that's promising just the mentality of the team. So I feel like that's something that we could build off of for sure.

2:
But you guys seem to struggle against the run the last three to four years. Osa you guys have struggled against the run. Why is it so difficult? And I understand you guys wanna play an attacking style defense when you had dq, he wants to attack, play, go to the get to the quarterback, you play that attacking style, that 43 get to the quarterback. Same thing with Zim. Why, why do you think it's been so difficult for you guys to stop the run?

9:
That's a tough one. There's a lot that goes into it, You know what I mean? Like, I feel like just being able to do just as good at the run later in the game as like as we are in the beginning of the game. 'cause I feel like we don't start out just, You know what I mean? Like, but against the run, I feel like obviously we've had games where we started slow, but I feel like for the most part, like we do a very good job at the beginning of the game, stopping the run. It's just those later runs, like they break them eventually. So I feel like right, just getting those down and, and just locking in even more just to be able to, to, to do a better job of stopping the run a little bit later in the game.

7:
Hey, when, when you think about it, listen, I'm as a, as a football enthusiast like myself. I like the Cowboys, I like the players on the Cowboys. I like the Cowboys fans. Now I don't like the way things are running Dallas. I'm not gonna say anything bad about your own or anything. But I would like to ask you Jerry Jones last year said he was gonna be all in. Is there anything that you would like to see ownership do to improve the team to give you guys a better chance at not only competing in the NFC but competing for Lombardi Trophy? Any additions you'd like?

9:
I know an old lineman for sure.

7:
Okay.

9:
Just, we just lost, lost Zach Martin. So definitely gonna need to pick up a old line. 'cause You know, that's a big part of our, our team and I feel like you gotta build from the front back, right? Obviously more det tackles is really me and Mozzie as of now. So getting a little bit more depth behind us and, and adding to the d-line room, like I said, building from the front back. Right. That's gonna be, that's gonna be very important. I feel like that's just, if you're, if you're trying to win football games, it's, you gotta focus on that line, right?

2:
You got your money and now it's Micah. You see Dak restructured his contract CD Lamb restructured his, gave him all nearly $40 million, about $37 million in, in cap relief. So they got some money to play with. Yeah. Micah just saw what Max Crosby got. Mm. The most money for a non quarterback in NFL history. I think Mike over there. Barbecue, chicken, pizza, hamburger. Oh yeah, tenders.

9:
He deserved it, bro. Like, I, I didn't say that first because I just felt like that was so obvious. It goes without saying bro. Yeah,

7:
Most, most definitely.

2:
We

9:
Got to bring Micah back, You know what I mean? Nothing he's going anywhere but get that deal done. So let, let, that's just like a no brainer bro. It's goes without saying gotta get, gotta get 11, right? Yeah.

7:
And they, we can't, we can't wait until the end of training camp before week one starts to get it done either.

9:
Nah, I think that's just, that's probably priority number one to be honest. Yeah.

2:
Yeah. Can I ask you a question? O oa, when, when Jerry is constantly in the headlines, he's saying things he like, do you like, come on J you get come on Jerry, stall us out man. Let, let, let him just play with all the distractions and that you, that you're creating

7:
Now. UNC can't answer that.

9:
I don't view it as a distraction, bro.

2:
Okay. You know

9:
What I mean? Like what, what he says doesn't affect what we do out there on the field. Like I'm the one out there on the field, bro. Like why? That's not even something that I really think about or let it distract me bro. 'cause I know I'm in the driver's seat when I'm on the field. So are the other 10 guys out there with me? So are the 11 guys on offense, right? In control of the situation. But

2:
You do how to, you do realize now when he says this team is as talented as those 90 Super Bowls team And you guys go out there and stank it up now. Either he's either he's misguided or you guys are not nearly as talented as he thinks now. It's, it is only one or two choices. Oie

9:
You Sorry, right now, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, but I wouldn't even say it's a, it's an issue with talent. I'm just like, sometimes the execution is just what obviously in the games that we didn't win, execution just wasn't where it needed to be. I don't think it's a question of talent at all.

7:
No, I don't think so.

2:
So what are, what are the, what is, what is, you mentioned team, team success, obviously you want to get to an NFC championship game, you want to get to the Super Bowl, potentially win that, but individual Pro Bowl all pro, what's next? What would you like to have when it's all said and done? When we come back, we have a conversation and we sit down with you. Let's just say for the sake of argument, 10 years from now and you're hanging your cleats up, what do you want to be on your resume?

9:
That's exactly what you just said, bro. Pro Bowl all pro, these are the things that I look at and that's exactly what I mean when I say there's still a lot out there for me to play for and a lot of things that I haven't accomplished yet.

2:
Ojo,

7:
You've gotten paid. I'm thinking about the time of my goals that I set once I'd gotten paid, right. All pro. Obviously at some point I would've loved to reach a Super Bowl. I wasn't able to do that.

2:
You did go to the football?

7:
No, I'm talking about when I was in Cincinnati.

9:
Oh, that ain't happening. Yeah,

7:
Yeah, yeah. Come on. That's don't be disrespectful. Don't talk about my bengals, don't talk about my Bengals. From a team, from a team standpoint, obviously speaking defensively, what, what do you think you guys need to do better to start the season off right? To get that identity back? You guys, to get back into, and I don't wanna say contention is not the right word, back into the good graces of just being a good defense in general, being that it's been bad. I I don't, I mean, no disrespect being that it's, it hasn't been up to par. I'll say it like that. What do you guys need to do?

9:
We gotta shut people down bro.

7:
Right? Just, just to, just to run. Just to run. That's it. That's, that's just the

9:
Rundown. Like we can, if we force people to throw the ball, You know what I mean? Like we, we can, we can pass rush with the best of them bro. So definitely getting that run stop is, and, and forcing them into those tho situations which they don't want to be in. Which has always been something that was obvious since I've been a rookie is like that's the last thing that teams want to do when they're coming to play The Cowboys this right? Don't want to throw the ball. So we gotta force him to throw the ball and, and play our game. You know,

2:
Cowboys defensive lineman, OSA a Diggy Zoa recently signed big lucrative contract. He has his money now, now he really gets to focus and become the player that he dreamed he could become. Oh yeah. A pro bowler an all pro and hopefully get the team to the Super Bowl. Ossa, thank you for joining us. Congratulations on the contract. Stay healthy. You sir. And we are, we'll check in with you down the road.

9:
Yes sir. Thank you. Alright,

13:
A 15,

2:
Oh Joe, we got some breaking news tonight. Whoa. Whoa. What

7:
Happened? It just happened right next. Now

2:
The charges, the charges have released five time Pro bowler Joey Bosa releasing Bosa saved the cow, saved the charges. $25.36 million against the cap. Wait, do you think you pick him up? Big question.

7:
If Joey Bosa is gone, then this is gonna be the per perfect opportunity. Now he can't command that much money, right? He just got released. Trey Henderson's is due a huge deal. I'm not sure if the Bengals are gonna be able to pay him. What about Joey Bosa coming to Cincinnati? What do you think? Huh? Yeah,

2:
But he still gonna want, he gonna want big, he gonna still want big money O time.

7:
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute now. Joy Book. Listen, you can't be commanding that kind of money when you haven't been performing the way you should. They just released you for a reason.

2:
Yeah. Stay with me. Injured. He, I mean he's been, he's been nicked a lie.

7:
He's been nicked, he's been injured. So you can't come in there. Talk about Oh I want, I want the bag. I'm talking about the bag bag. You've already, he's already, he's already gotten the bag bag.

2:
No, he he not gonna command Max Crosby money. No, but he gonna want, he gonna want big money. He's gonna want big money. O Joe. We give know the 20 million.

7:
Listen, we gonna give him a little something. We, we ain't gonna do him dirty. We gonna give him a little something. We need to upgrade our defense. This is the perfect time to do so. Now Trey Hendrickson is going to be able to command much more than what Joy Boal would get. So I understand that. I I just Huh?

2:
He's gonna want that Max Crosby money.

7:
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's why I say I'm, I'm not sure we will be able to retain Brother, brother Henderson, You know, allow him to, to, to to be blessed, You know, elsewhere, You know, bring Mac Crosby in. I mean bring Max Crosby in. Bring Joey Bos in and and see what we could do. What you think. No,

2:
Hold on. Look, the charges are trying to kill a cap space. Right. The thing is this is $25 million for a guy that's over the last several years. OCHO has been Nick, he spent more time off the field than on the field. Yes sir. That's a lot of money. If, if, if, if, if Joey BSO was playing, You know, 15, 16 games a season. Right. We still giving you that production when they gave him that big money. Right. 25. I mean $25 million cap here for a guy that's giving you 1213 sack is, is gravy. Yes sir. But it's because of the injuries and You know, I'm looking at 'em.

2:
I mean they're gonna probably, they're probably gonna go out and try to, Khalil Mack is interesting what they're gonna do with Mac.

7:
Yeah,

2:
Because Oh wait, he's gonna probably want to get extended.

7:
Yeah, they can't get rid of everybody now.

2:
You probably, huh?

7:
They can't get rid of everybody now.

2:
No, no, no,

7:
No, no, no, no. You got two Premier End. You got two Premier ends now. You let one go now you can't let the other one go.

2:
You got, well you got Durbin James. That's making a lot of money on the back end. Yeah, you got Khalil that's making good money. But he's gonna probably want to get extended

7:
Again.

2:
No, I mean you gotta realize what Joe, he that contract that it's, he got what, one year left on his contract. Ash. What's up Khalil Max situation? I think he, I think he gotta have like one year ocho.

7:
Okay. Dang.

2:
But You know no ocho coaches players, nobody wants to go into that last year deal. Yeah, that's a lame duck.

7:
Wanna Yeah. Yeah,

2:
Because bro, what if you do? You believe me, me or you don't? It's really there. I mean especially 'cause I've been in this league, I've been defensive player of the year. Y'all, y'all know what I do. You believe in me,

7:
Right? Oh, you don't? Yeah,

2:
And I, if I'm not mistaken, I think Mac Mac went to the Pro Bowl last year. So he is like, clearly the coaches and the players and the fans think I'm still playing at elite level. Yeah, he's a free agent. Yeah. Oh,

7:
He free.

2:
Yeah. So they,

7:
Man listen, I, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna call. I'm Mac Mack. Come on to Cincinnati too. Oh boy. Hey listen, I don't like what's going on man. Tyler Lockett, You know Tyler Lockett probably gonna that funny bro. Tyler Lockett probably gonna end up going out there with Pete Carroll.

2:
Yeah, they're the good chance they Yep. They they drafted him.

7:
Yep. They familiar with each other. They know each other. Pete

2:
Drafted him.

7:
Yep. Davante Adams Rams now. Jerry Jones. Jerry Jones. I know you gonna see this 'cause somebody gonna send it to you. Now DK Maff has been, has been granted permission to seek a trade. Jerry Jones, if you really all in, if you want the fan,

2:
He oh, north of 30 million. He wants 30. He wants in that 30 million range, you're not finna have two receivers making 30 million and a and a quarterback making that kind of money. And you got to sign Micah.

7:
Can I,

2:
Where the money coming from? Ocho can

7:
I, can I ask you a question? Yeah. You hear what you just said, right? Yes. You heard everything you just said. So I know I have a lot of fans that are from Cincinnati in this chat. And based on what you just said, why do we still believe we'll be able to keep a $30 million receiver, a $40 million receiver and a $50 million quarterback based off what you been say

2:
And a $30 million defensive end? That I don't know.

7:
Yeah, it's tough. I it is. I I wouldn't wanna be a gm. I wouldn't wanna be an owner because I'm gonna act like the Yankees. I'm spinning everything. Whatever penalty, whatever. Listen, whatever penalty I give from being over the calf, I'll take it because I'm signing everybody.

2:
Tyler Lockett was released by the Seahawks today and DK Metcalf requested a trade. The request came today after series of conversation over the past two weeks. DK prefer the contender. Yeah. DK is in the last year of his contract. DKC where the receiver market is heading. Hey bro, what y'all got for me?

7:
I told y'all ain't got

2:
Nothing for me. I no money. Yeah. Okay. Can I get traded? I

7:
Told you what he needed to do. Huh? You said

2:
'cause hey I see what y'all did with Tyler Lockett.

7:
I told you what they need to do. Jerry Jones need to be all in unc. They gotta be able to compete with the rest of the NFC, unc, Devonte Smith, AJ Brown, Deebo Samuels. Terry McLaurin. Terry Mcla. They on me. Brown. CD Lamb by

2:
Yourself Zach Ertz

7:
Make a splash. Jerry make a splash. Show the fans of Dallas that you're serious. Davante Adams Rams is available. If you don't wanna pay North 30 for dk, bring somebody in there. Take some of the pressure off of Dak, take some of the pressure off a cd. Show 'em you're serious. You know what? I'm gonna show my team. I'm gonna show the players here that I'm serious about winning and I'm gonna do something that's outta character. I'm gonna go pay for some upgrades to the offense.

2:
If I don't think anything is wrong with my house, why would I upgrade it?

7:
Listen, Davante Adams Rams is right there. Jerry Davante. Adams Rams is right there.

2:
I the what part about, I don't think anything is wrong with my house, so I don't need to have it.

7:
It's something wrong. It's something wrong with it. 'cause it's been leaking for 30 years. It's something wrong with it.

2:
That's what I got pots and pan for. I catch the wa. Rainwater ain't very nothing. Ocho the Texans plan on letting Stefan Diggs test pre agency and Davante Adams Rams was cut by the Jets. Dang Cheetah tweeted about re the recent receiver movement around the NFL, right? Everyone trying to get out. Why do you think there's so much movement with receivers currently? Ocho

7:
I mean, I mean, you think of the, you think of the receivers that are moving. Most of them are, are the veterans. Those that are, You know, up in age a little bit, trying to get out of the back end of those contracts. They, they obviously, You know, they're not gonna allow you to hit the back end of the contracts. Calf hits obviously DK wanting to be paid. They're like, nah, we not doing that. Which is why they allowed him to, to seek a trade. Davante Adams Rams money. There's no way that just were paying the remaining of whatever the next year's, You know, salary was, lemme see Stefon digs coming off of, coming off of injury. He was only on the one year to begin with ACL.

7:
Yeah. On ACL. So hopefully he, he gets the opportunity to, to get back healthy and, and, and, and find somewhere where he can contribute. And tho, tho those are the reasons

2:
And Brandon Ike, the 49 ERs are, are, is being reported. Yeah. That they're willing to listen to trade for Brandon iu. So he's another receiver that might be on the move.

7:
And you have to understand why they're doing that. Brandon IU actually also coming off. What kind of injury on, if I'm not mistaken.

2:
Okay, what happened O Joe, what

7:
Kind of injuries? IU coming off of ACL is good. ACL. Yeah. See, You know, You know how they treat you acl, especially at a receiver, at a skilled position, You know how they treat you. If you're coming off Achilles or ACL, you, they feel you're not gonna be the same.
