You got this Nike suit in there now. That's curtains we were talking about the other day. Like the old Marshall's place when you used to go and get jerseys and stuff, you had to really expect the motherfuckers 'cause they would have a misprint. I remember my nigga had a a Charlotte hors jersey bro.


And the the eve was out of it. It was crazy. Yeah, nah, Eve was out of pocket for buying that. Yo fat out used to have Mr Shit at Marshalls too. You really had to check. Ah bro. The shit, I aint, y'all had horrible experiences because that that's where all the shit should be. Little off a little deflect but a motherfucker missing the whole letter on the Swazi and you missing motherfucking fat Albert arm on your motherfucker. Jake the place that shit don't want. That shit get fucked up. Yeah but you getting that kind of crazy defective gear is crazy bro. It's supposed to be like lil mouth. The stitching be fucked up like oh nah. You know what I'm saying? Girl, we was always in that mo but you had to check because sometimes they all had the champion jerseys with the those shit in the front and then the back be empty. You'd be like, all right now you just grabbed this motherfucker blonde and your mom just grabbed you something on the low.


You might have to come home and take that shit back. Yeah we weren't doing that bad. I I shopped at Marshall a couple times. Fuck it. I just went to Rs though. I go all the way fake. Yeah. Oh fuck it. I just went nobody was gonna say shit. Yeah that was the crazy time. Those were the Times Booie was wearing fake Jordans. Nobody care. Damn bro. Back then a lot of niggas was wearing fake Jordans. And it's funny now speaking of shoes, when you see like, like they have like some suede bread elevens is coming out the windows next month. I was like niggas saw them in the gas station in oh six and y'all was nothing. Now y'all want 'em. I do not want no suede 11. Look Allway all suede bro. Damn they fucking the shoe up the breeze. Yeah bro. Damn bro. What we got to talk about But look at this nigga, he trying to get over the camera.


I can't turn mic up today. Freaky Mike. Fuck you like y'all. He ain't wanna get back on camera until you see LeBron in the documentary. He is like nah I gotta one up. LeBron did you get on camera for D Rose since you put on the outfit form yesterday. That nigga did wore that nigga wore designer shoes for D Rose. Bro never seen that nigga. The crazy part D Roses came here fresh off the motherfuck Bear's victory. The crazy part you put up the motherfucker, you dressed like you was going to D Andreas. Matter of fact I ain't never seen you have you even had pants in Vegas nigga? Right. Nigga I had on sweatpants. I don't know it was green blue jeans bro.


Then you couldn't get in the club in Vegas because they didn't have no pair. How else? Designer shoes. Wow. The first part is I wore three different pair of designer shoes. The last three episodes. Mind y'all, this nigga's feet is fucked up right now. He only got one shoe I one I wore one. He only got one shoe. And Mike, Chris his shoes, he gotta get a whole new wardrobe to this. I can you tell him stop wearing your kicks bro. Sit this months out bro. What do y'all want me to wear those bro? Wear the Dunkaroos bro. Only when it rain the Blazers motherfuckers ass. Damn. I hate Blazers bro. The high Tide ones bro. Yeah, Clyde Hooped the deal bro.


Yeah I, I fuck with the SB Blazers a little bit fat. I had a little bit more sweat but other Blazers they was cool but I was like I couldn't do it after, I don't like the Offwhite Blazers and shit. Offwhite Ones ain't the OFFWHITE ones. Oh my fault. 69.99 at the outlet for sure. They just got the fat Nike sign on them. Oh motherfucker shout out to the outlet. Yeah. Hey but speaking of that, the Netflix documentary, you know what I'm saying? The unscripted title with the NBA players. You know what I'm saying? You got Brian, you got Tatum, you got AE Saboni. I think that shit is fire. I think that is the next step that we're getting into broadcasting. We gonna get some of these unscripted unedited broadcast of basketball 'cause we really want to hear the shit y'all be talking when y'all play basketball. For real, for real. Yeah that was, that's more exclusive than I ever seen before.


Like hear them cussing like that and talking like that. That was hard. I mean I don't think you gonna get too much of that shit though. I don't think that's gonna happen. Nah it's 'cause it's too many people got brands and shit that they wanna protect. Yeah and I wish it, this happened like a little bit before like maybe about 10 years ago. 'cause like when you had the kgs the the people who was really talking crazy, I wanted to hear that shit 'cause them niggas was very disrespectful. Yeah it is too friendly now you gonna hear more conversations about like what you doing after this man, your kid's good man you ain't gonna really hear too much talking crazy. Probably Anthony Edwards probably. Yeah probably s gonna turn up. Oh for sure He's this, he's about to really show why he's a star. You know shout out to LeBron and Jason Taylor now but I think they should have had like Ja Morant Lalo ball and you want the Patreon version?


Yeah and El Edwards Jordan pool like the real star five Jordan pool. Yeah bro we really wanna see the fry shit bro. If we just keeping it real bro. We all, we experienced pause LeBron for 22 years bro. Yeah we get it bro. And you be on Instagram heavy, you know what I mean Like so we get it. LeBron ain't about to get on there clowning bro. So who would be your top five you wanna watch on that series? I told you and okay Ae Ja Morant, Lalo Ball Jordan Pool. Let me throw a random in there. Fuck it. Put my, what's my nigga from Orlando? They'll be killing Paolo. Paolo put that hair on there.


Need a hard worker on there. Somebody to break somebody bouncing out somebody that killed somebody who trying to around win. Hey I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go with players who didn't play this area 'cause I if I pick now I'm just picking the Charlotte Hornets one through five. That's all I need. This follow the Hornets all day. I fuck with them young niggas. Nah hold on bro. Replace Ben Curl sub for Miles. Bridges my faults. Right fo you right I outta pocket. I'm gonna go under a, I'm just go random players from the past that we wish we could've had on there. I would've loved to see KG because KG was always talking crazy. Running around JR R Smith definitely would've been another one.


Prime Washington Gilbert definitely keep the cameras on him at all times. I'm trying to think of somebody else who was cold but they was like super fr Charles Oakley somebody who was always around some bull like we need players like that. I wanna see what they was on out fuck what they was was doing on the court. What Y niggas was on after work was rock about. They probably couldn't show that it's on next bro. We need the patriarch clip like you said. 'cause if they follow the Hornets it's gonna be way more off the court than basketball. Yeah I got a six man off the bench too. My nigga Dick Young need that Swaggy P Juan need Daz Russell story. The real. Yeah how to see I'm gonna just, I'm gonna just do all over the place. I don't got retired or I do ke and retire. I got Alan Iversson. I would've love to see AI for sure.


See what he was doing. I would've liked to see Kg like you said probably it'd been cool to watch D Rose to see like how he was living. Like see what he was doing. Hell yeah I ain't gonna lie, I was always a fan of like Jason Williams and them. I would have to put like oh for sure. Yeah I had to put like Jason Williams crazy even though you a white dude act black but you still get that different side. Like damn was he really wilding or he was. Yeah that's true bro. Then I'll probably go with like yeah I'm mean or something just to go overseas 'cause I'm trying to make my show work.


Oh okay. So all the Chinese people watch too. They trying to bread up. Yeah I'm trying. I'm trying to rack up. Yeah I'm going straight to BETL. Cut tee. There you go Teague. Yeah I'm going trying to win it. Win the after irons Got that trying to win. Hey man this shit popped up recently again but I'm so laughing that James Har ball service in the club put Darryl Mor as a liar. That shit is still fucking hilarious to me. Bro got too bro. I'm making all that chicken. Fuck hell we got running up forever. He played in my face man that nigga crazy but it's funny 'cause EJ come here, you know what I'm saying? Like all the Darryl Mor people, they keep getting paid man. They keep, you know what I'm saying? They keep his sas, he like die.


I mean like Doc he like tips. He keep his people so for him to be the person that fall out with him is funny as hell man. Nah for real because they was sticking his Steve for a long time period. Facts, y'all got the Clippers being shit ball. I think the Clippers gonna be all right man. I think James Har gonna have a solid year. He had a solid year last year. I think James Har gonna have a really solid year. Obviously if Kawhi is healthy enough to play shit, that's how far they go. But I think they got the right role players around to have a competent team for sure. Yeah I think Bones gonna have to step up this year. Yeah, give us some, give us some extra energy. Finally. Probably gonna get that the minutes like he was getting on the Nuggets. I hope he hope he do well this year For sure. I mean I don't know how good they gonna be though. But see my problem is, I think the worst thing that happened was him getting, you know what I'm saying?


Kevin Porter Jr. 'cause they kind of do the same shit but he does it. Kevin Porter Jr. Better he does it better. Yeah I think that's going, that's going to really be his, he he gonna have to, you know what I'm saying? Really compete in that situation. I yeah RP to my man PJ Get Well song with pj. I talked to my dog yesterday. Yeah we on that with Gil bro. Yeah we got you. We got you. He got my nigga fucked up Gil. You outta pocket. You outta pocket. Gil. Gil said that he would rather have ta the real ta. Nah fuck outta here instead. Nah the real TA is Tony Allen. We'll never do that. God damnit. Nah that nah you always give niggas nicknames. He can't be the real ta. Nah it's his full name. The, I took Kao what's his middle name?


Brian Leroy not doing my nigga PJ like that. Who got crazy allies? Tony Allen orthodontic This, this the Battle of the Real TAs. Tony Allen is a legend bro. Yeah T TA got his jersey retired. Yeah don't sleep Grind City. Yeah we need you on the show. Nasty. But yeah back to this PJ shit Gilbert drew out of pocket bro. For sure bro. One nigga put in too much work. He damn near close to 18, 19 years in his league man. He done earned his stripes for sure. We ain't gonna put him in the same category bro as ta bro. Nothing. He said TJ what's up? He said he in the locker room fucking it up bro. That's, I don't know. Go somewhere where they want you though? Go where you celebrate now where you tolerated.


I'm still kind of surprised though. Like I'm like damn you should be chilling. I thought he'd be chilling by now but I guess he still wanna compete at a high level or play or whatever but shit. But it was like a year, 18, 19. I thought he would be like, but I told you y'all niggas and niggas get old, they still be willing to play. That's that Vince Carter shit. Yeah, yeah that's different. Yeah. I'm like damn I would've been smooth. I think he making like 10, 12 million year I would've been over there chilling LA. Yeah you kind of, it's kind of laid out for you. Yeah I would been tripping. I would've just been chilling but I get it. But you right. Just the comparison. I I'm asleep bro. Yeah you probably seen them taxes though.


He probably lie to get the fuck outta here. Yeah dude that's the crazy part is he do that money somebody gotta take their bread. Yeah he probably lie. I need to get to taxes. Shit. Shit. When you at this point in your career, I feel like you wanna win. So shit, I don't know where You can go for real right now. Who could use a PJ Tucker? That's a great question. You know what? I think it's back to the, the basis of this conversation. Is PJ about to come in and play or do you want him as a mentor in the locker room to accept the culture or the energy? 'cause if he wants to play, I think a lot of people won't be scared. 'cause like you said, they don't want vest in away gonna take minutes from young people. So nah, who really need him is a tough conversation. I would like to see Orlando, he need to get a buyout and I think he need to go to Phoenix. Mm.


He get a buyout or whatever. 'cause I mean Phoenix ain't got no room to trade for him. Yeah they kept, they got no money. Yeah but if he get a buyout and they can wave somebody he signed for the minimum. Yeah. He'll get to play over there. Speaking of Phoenix, I watched a little bit of preseason. They moving the ball a little bit differently bro. I knew that was gonna happen. Yeah. Which which a guy. Yeah I knew that make a difference if that shit only gonna last for so long because of who it's a preseason. Niggas don't care about stats right now. Once somebody aging 25, another nigga average at 14. Man that shit gonna get spooky again bro. Yeah, I see Brad be already sought off the press run. He talking about 2017 Wizards coulda did something with them Cavs teams.


I'm like my boy I fuck with you. But you're outta pocket 2017. What year? I don't remember them teams, they were solid. They was, that wizard team was real good. But I don't, did they flood the Cavs? I do not remember but I don't think they wanted that smoke. I'm saying they had the opportunity. I'm sure. Yeah. I gonna say I forgot how that shit messed. But was LeBron in la? Nah, in 17 couldn't have been fuck me. He was then why he say that he could do something with that. Yeah, 17 he was in, he was in Cleveland again. They ain't playing. I don't remember. I remember they had some match but I don't, I don't know why he, he feel like they matched up the best but I don't remember that serious.


I'm just, I'm period though. I'm sleep too. Yeah, I'm just asleep period. I hope the sons have a great year. I think they gonna have a great year though, but bro Right. Shit. Hopefully niggas can put their egos to the side but if not it's gonna be another wicked season for 'em. It's gonna be K's last year in Phoenix. That's what it's looking like. I, I don't see it man. I don't see it. I don't see it. They all go individually. I don't know if they gonna get along together to compete in the west. For real, for real. I had a full year to figure it out though. Yeah. Yeah. What we gonna do? Y'all like we gonna rock out or start figuring out, start forcing the hand with the trays and shit but who don't have another full year of that? Who gonna figure it out though? Like is Brad Bill just gonna take the role like Yeah I'm just, I'm just average 15, 16.


You think he there yet? No sir. To do 15 and 16 and we winning. I think Brad if anybody, I think he's more willing to sacrifice. I mean he really ain't got no choice. Yeah but I'm saying though like so far it's like making it a problem in the locker room. I think he's your least you know ego type of motherfucker on the team. De Booker need that nigga. Y'all niggas came here. Fuck y'all franchise. Yeah I'll be here. I'll be here passed all y'all don't sure figured out bro. But nigga this's my shit up Brad. I man out respect but I think that the tough part about it is Brag got a kill.


If they even would think about moving Hill, he would have to come out the gates going crazy for somebody to take his contract right now. Even though it ain't super crazy, it's still a max deal. He it's crazy. Yeah I was gonna say it is Cap is rising but it's still a hell of a deal that people gotta really want you to take. He need to just like embrace for that team being like the sixth man he might start but like I'm gonna come get my six man role kind of Yeah up me out early so I can go crazy in the second quarter. You know what I mean? Type shit. But I could see that if they mix the line up how they supposed to bro, I think they'll work out bro. They, they load it to me. They load it because if anybody who could probably make that work, I think Buzz person who could probably make that work for sure. Mm.


You said Fi hey get well soon. So I don't have no expectations for them niggas. I know that all three of of them could hoop, other people could hoop on that team. They just don't look like a well put together team to me or a team that wanna be together. I think Bud do better with less. Mm. Where he really gotta coach a team up when he got the most, the more all the stars. I ain't dang ain't really his alley. I think his alley is more. I got less. Nah y'all gotta kind of listen to me. Y'all gotta embrace what I'm going through and what I'm doing and how I feel about shit. Once you got like a bunch of great players who already got, they set set ways they do how they do it, they got 12 different coaches they play for. They got they own philosophies to come in with your own philosophy and if a nigga play get it on work like we seen with LeBron, oh I'm already tired of this shit.


Yeah You know I I man shout out to D him man get well soon but you know what I mean like so magic KD some shit not he gonna be like hey man yeah I've been doing this shit for 18. This shit whack Bud need to be in Orlando or something. Yeah he need one of them kind of groups, some starter groups where niggas still gotta buy in. Yeah. Yeah I think Orlando gonna make some noise in the east. I was just watching a little bit of, obviously it's preseason but like even KCP talking he was like the first team I've really been on to like niggas like embrace locking up niggas embrace playing defense and I'm like they already solid with him and that team they going they gonna be a tough out for a lot of people. Yeah I mean them niggas like that 'cause they young and trying to get into Yeah they can't to it. They trying to solidify themselves.


Yeah so that's why you got a U basketball in Orlando though. They full court press type nigga. For real bro. Niggas trying to really figure it out like that ain't the same as that Denver Nuggets team. My niggas kind of like we just here to hoop bro. And we already got a check and everybody got paid. We cooling now that's a, I think Orlando is gonna have a good year though. I think Paolo Ben Curl going. He probably fuck around average like 28 to 30 this year. Damn. He gonna give, I, I think he's he's gonna get this shit off this year. But he also got people on the scene too that, you know what I'm saying? Oh yeah, niggas get bucket because Frans gotta pay too and it's up. He got Max didn't he? Yeah he, he got out that Max deal. It's up. They just paid Wendell Carter so Yeah they, they Young pieces is getting paid. I get Wendell. That's dope.


Yeah they locking shit in. Yeah, that's hard. It look like something and that's smart. He shout to Orlando man. Might need to give me a s Sweezy look at Window Dub Jonathan Isaac again too. They sure did. I don't understand that one but he got some of the weakest shoes I've ever seen in my life. Damn. He got a Sig bought his signature shoe bro. He got a signature shoe.

'cause they're gonna be like we are in, we're in like the most beautiful people place.


Why am I watching to see if camera rising place Or not? Yeah, they have camera rising exhaustion too. Yeah, they're, they're tired of it. They want other things to rise, so, oh, there it is there.

Yeah, that because he wouldn't sign a deal or sacrificed her. So they smoked him. Yeah, that she, she got chill on that. Yeah, that I I I don't like to hear shit like that 'cause it's just like we know that that could be some bullshit but also you lost somebody so we can't even say nothing about that. But that's just some bad energy to put in the air dog. Yeah that's just crazy. Like even as far as, as much as they wi out 'cause she be going crazy.


Yeah. Poor management. What we got Appreciate. Damn did somebody die? They sick of all the science. Somebody literally died. Oh yeah bro. Poor management is crazy. She gonna go in on y'all bro.

Oh we made it Just wait after this interview we dropped off Move bro.


No, before the, before the fireworks go off. I be watching that they earth, earth show like when they be doing it. It is entertaining though. It is bro. It kind of be having some truth too. I think a lot of that shit that she be speaking is the truth. On my mama. I don't think she's all the way fucked up. I think she saw a lot of that shit. I I think that she definitely saw some shit that people ain't supposed to know about. But also there's definitely an entertainment factor behind that because she be wilding bro. And we a great storyteller. If you, if you say some of that stuff and it is true, niggas is pulling up bro. Niggas is just not letting that. But nobody ever pull up on her. You can't bro, you can't dj it ain't that sweet bro.


You playing with fire bro. Nobody ever pull up on her. Nobody ever pull her card. Nothing. Because half the people probably like the people in intake information. It's like oh no she just crazy. Thank you are serious. But you gotta think she said all that shit about Diddy and then when that shit started coming out, everybody like that's why she got so much at traction though. Yeah everybody like bro she been on this wave for years but she ain't just, you know and then like during our Columbus interview I be like niggas ain't crazy bro. 'cause he said all that shit too. Told y'all that's why I ain't say nothing about her because I, I damn near believe her because I ain't gonna lie. I damn near he said don't pick us up. I ain't picking no so I just damn near believe some of the shit she could saying you be the affidavit.


I just be believing some of the shit. She say like it don't sound too crazy no more after seeing shit like Columbus short. Shut the tone bro. I'm God. But that's so funny 'cause we don't add the shit on this show but Colo Colombo said some wild shit. We was just, y'all need to go back and wash. That shit real. We can't publish that. Yeah we took all the shit out. He said yeah. Oh we sure yeah the I'm not sucking no did I said what? Yeah nigga said I ain't sucking no dick said damn. I said what? Cut that, cut it nigga just like no we don't need this in our episode. That nigga asked me to get on all fours. I said he's a monster wanted you to go crazy.


He really wanted you to get on stumping yard nigga. He wanted Michael Urban at the Miami. Nigga say he called at night when my wife was there. What my wife was saying and my wife questioned me. Right. Pull up to the telly. That's crazy. Wow. It did but he what he said about, well I don't wanna repeat it because we said it enough but I shout out to Colombo nigga. Yeah, yeah. So Patrik, where we going? Orlando Brown, Colombo, Jaguar W White Colombo Third. Yeah third. Yes. Orlando one. That's my cousin Jaguar White two Jaguar White Gene up there too though.


Gene, gene, he starting to track his statements though. I was watching the other day. He was, I don't say he did that much motherfucker on your ass fucker as man that retracing his neighbor.

That's the problem about the internet seeing you at that Whole Foods nigga said fuck that niggas have too much fun. That camera realize they gotta go in real life. Yeah. Now my thing is with Gene though, you got all these stories bro and you know shout out to your legacy or whatever but a lot of this shit bro, I just don't think they will allow you to be there if you didn't sacrifice nothing bro. So they can have some SMU on you just Oh so he's saying his bun was on the line?


Yeah Man, come on bro. You from Respect so Genius. Hey what? Put that little podcast he gonna be on playing next week. I'm just saying bro. He was probably playing with Gene shit like a tambourine in church bro. So shit Gene was, gene was on demon time bro. Yeah. Yes man it grew up different bro. Nah he did but I'm just saying bro like just chill bro. Raise your grandkids and your kids bro. Don't get into this bro. Yeah man ain't no money in this bro. Your safety is way more important than that bro. But no, the fucked up part is, it is money in that. If you seen these lad interviews and stuff, they be getting, I mean bro they probably seen about some money they wouldn't see that's why we seen KPD get on there and damn bring, get hisself jammed up.


Yeah, shout to them boys. Yeah, all money ain't good money man with that. That's crazy y'all. I agree. Putting your shit on the line for that. Your safety bro for a Vlad interview. I don't disagree bro. Diddy and them ain't playing bro. Them niggas is real life gangsters bro. You done put all this sweat on me bro. Talk about my horror Hons bro. Ain't no way bro. Yeah bro. I like that because y see Cam say I need a whore. My wife need to be a whore. I didn't see that. Yes. He said I don't want my wife to be a hoe. A hoe is different but a whore. She got to be a whore. I said Mace is over there rolling. What's making so much fun, like making it so much funnier bro.


Please tell the people what's different between a hoe and a hoe. Well shout to King Word maybe and I dunno, you know shouts a killer but I think a hoe is just safe. A hoe is a has been or used to be a hoe is like oh she retired. Yeah like a retired stripper that just found God a hoe is like, what's the girl who just turned into a full muzzle act like she did some time in jail came outta Mother Brittany ring. That's a hoe, A whore. Pinky. No matter if she DJ size or by size up forever.


Oh hey not retired dad at all. She was on my top line two weeks ago and the nigga so quotes tweeted her and put petrol you in a sonics uniform. Man nigga. Nigga sent me her in a magic uniform. That's crazy. You got there bro. I got her in a magic uniform. Well they trying to say man said she just doing it for the love of the game.


Oh man. Fucking 36 in Jersey. Damn. Oh man. The ice packs take me out. Oh the ice pack is crazy bro. It's hard to sell. Club five 20 You can put your advertisement right after this spot. It is hard. Woo. Man, that is funny as hell man. We're back to basketball. Hey man. Some of the, the young rookies been going crazy.


Pax just played the hawks last night, you know what I'm saying? Gotta see on Zachary live again. We saw him when he was in Vegas, you know what I'm saying? But he gonna be all right. Yeah, he was timid in Vegas at the summer league. I feel like now they probably been boosting his, you know what I mean? What do you call it? Fuck. What word am I looking for? His confidence. Confidence. There we go. Okay. I like, I like how they playing him by ball with Trey. I like the way Yeah they, I like, I like that combination. That's You can start off. Yeah. Pause. That was crazy. No they're in Atlanta. My bad cheer man. Shout to smile. Don't go there. You wanna send to a Atlanta?


I said no bro you don't. What's the boy named Victor? Be on him? Yeah. No. What's the boy that you Zachary? Oh, oh damn. See young Zach? Nah he gonna be all though. I watched the game. He he nice though. Oh he gonna be solid Reid. She Reid she about to have a lot of expectations live up to, they're putting the gasoline. I love his name but he is a solid player. I think he gonna be real solid for rockets. They gonna be the team that I think they gonna have to figure out how to get rid of some of their young assets 'cause it ain't gonna be enough space for everybody because Ken Whitmore got a, he, he is a star bro. He cold. He a star. He's cold. I knew he was a star in college. He, I scouted him one time. I was like man he just don't fit Villanova.


He ain't a Villanova dude. He a star. He's cold man he cold. It was crazy to see. I think Talu said it. He compare him and Jaylen Green to like Vincent Tmac and I was like that's interesting. And if it was somebody else I'd be like, you cap him but because it's tlu I'm gonna respect that way more. Nah, them too. They too freak athletes bro. Like they both can shoot it both can score it both athletic and shit. So it ain't a back of person. They just way shorter. Yeah, I was gonna say. Yeah but they about to get rid of somebody because Young Thompson's gonna get playing. Tom, he's he, they got too many wings that have to like demand him or playing spots. I know you gonna get Shepherd probably to push out Fair Van Fleet but everybody else that that wing over for business.


Mm. Yeah it's gonna be interesting. They gonna be a good team with fun team to watch. Super fun. They appreciate it. It was fun to watch. Hell yeah, they would though. They would for sure. Alex r did really well. I still, it is DC like you said, we gotta see what Jordan Pool gonna do. I think them getting a new coach, they like, damn Jordan Pool is cold. Like let's get him back to playing basketball the way he wants to free Kyle Coman. He just over there, you know what I'm saying? Purgatory just chilling. But yeah, these, these young rookies, I think there's gonna be a lot of expectations on people this year for sure. I mean we just went through a couple of 'em, but I think I don't think it's gonna be too much high expectations. I think people, I think people looked at this class like it was a down class, so I don't think the expectations would be that high, but I think they gonna surprise a lot of people though. Yeah. I mean from a general public for sure.


But you know in them, in them offices and them teams, you our first round pick nigga. You got you. You gotta, yeah. But they kind of know like nobody really expect much out of the first round picking a rookie now, you know what I mean? 'cause everybody's so young. Everybody get drafted at 19. So the year before you probably drafted a 19-year-old. Yeah, like hopefully his second year he can become a little better than he was. Like the teams are so young now that your fourth year player be 21 and it's like we still got hope for this guy. Like it ain't really that bad no more. Like who was the Rockets? Who was that? That big center? What Jab singing?


ung. Oh s, I forgot name. I think this is your four for him? Yeah. Like he still young as shit oh three if I'm correct. But he like, but either way he like super young. Yeah. So they still, even though he took a, he had a good year last year but like he still gotta take another step to being a star For sure. So the expectations on the younger dudes won't be that bad. That's real. Yeah. Even with Jabari. Yeah. Like Jabari still gotta get better. It is definitely, definitely way different than when you was coming into a league bro. Yeah. Light years. Oh for sure. For sure. Niggas had to get shit together. Yeah they said they got a little time and like you said y'all was coming into sophomores and juniors. I mean you had one of the dones but majority was sophomore and junior coming into that situation.


A little bit more mature. They expect your game to be more refined and how y'all played too. But the league was older too when bro went to the league. Yeah. Niggas had vets. Nigga had really a 40-year-old nigga to Yeah, give him some game. You look at Orlando, we was talking about how good they are. Shout out to Gary Harris. Five 20 alumni. He a vet on that team and Gary is low thirties. The absolute most you him and Kcp. What they both like 31, 32. It's crazy. 30 30. That's crazy. Damn KCP 30 Gary Thirty's what I'm saying bro. He was talking, we used do a year and a half ago he was 29-year-old vet on the, in the locker room. That shit nigga used have like Kevin Willis and Theo nigga Joe Smith. Ma Nigga had Eric dpi, Eric Damn Period.


Damn Kcb 31. See what I'm saying? They the vets on the team at 31 so you got a little more time. I mean but they just keep drafting and drafting and drafting so your spot can get taken easily. But y'all still all like 20 years old so for sure. Another words y'all watch a little bit of, I had to watch Antonio. I'm locked in Safaree Ka gonna be all right. Ucon. We was talking about him. He gonna be all right. He who? Yeah, he gonna be all right. That's all coaching though. This is from coming from like Yukon. He just, he fit the Spurs bro. Like if You can get coached by Buddy from Yukon, You can play anywhere. Yeah because that nigga hard as hell on players and the way he was cussing people out on videos.


Who over there? Hurley. Hurley. He was talking greasy to them. I fuck with it. Yeah I do too. But Buddy gonna be straight anyway 'cause he can take coaching so it don't even matter. So like if a CP yelling at him, pop yelling at him, whoever it is he able to take coaching so he gonna be all right. Yeah. Damn Hurley boy. He, he be wilding. He trying to tap into that Bob Knight. Nah he, he restoring the feeling for sure. He definitely baby Bob Knight. And what's crazy is he got the hardware to prove it. Now he got two national chef chips. He aint tell him shit bro. Not a fucking thing I'm proving. Yeah that's why I know that that Laker shit was all smoke mirrors because ain't no way I just built this hell of a situation. You want me to go into this bullshit? Hell bro. What y'all think J j's expectations are though JJ? Ah I think gonna be tough for him or they going to take it easy on him?


I think he gonna have it a lot easier than Darmouth for a couple obvious reasons but I think he gonna have a little bit of a pass this year. Okay. But I think they're gonna be better this year too so I don't think he gonna get much scrutiny unless he just terrible at endgame adjustments. I think that he he'll have a decent year. I don't think they care. I swear the Lakers just waiting for like LeBron to leave. Damn. Nah I ain't saying like LeBron ain't the goal like he ain't good but they just know like they got a cap with LeBron like it's only so good we can be because you can't trade bro ad your second best player and it's like what we gonna do? You can't get nobody damn that's true bro.


I ain't thinking about it like that. And they don't have as many assets to move around to make it make sense without that young players getting moved in that situation too. Your your best asset is bro, he's 40 years old, can't trade bro. And that's best thing is ad nobody wanna trade for ad he kind of older you injury prone people. I ain't taking that chance. Then the next one is Austin Reeves and he the fan favorite after that it's brony so that's crazy true. Here go we just waiting for bro y'all really just like hopefully we had some good years. Hopefully Bron can work his magic and we make a run at it but yeah I think he wait for Bryce. You think Brian tried to wait for Bryce?


If he play with Bryce it'll have to be in Vegas like play with him and then Oh his son? Yeah when he owns the team in Vegas. That's you think Bryce on the NBAI don't that quick or is gonna be tough now Bryce makes to the NB this shit. That's what I'm saying. If Bryce Bryon one know that's gonna be, I mean granted if he takes a a crazy leap for sure respect but I think, I think he gonna be cool but I do too but if he, if he make it like smooth I'm might have to do what Jimmy Butler did have to go to the lab to come to the laugh for sure. Hey that's another team people sleeping on Miami gonna be all right this year. I know we talk about this here year but Miami gonna be all right this year man.


What they pick up? I think them just having another year of being healthy all together 'cause you had a lot of injuries last year. I like Terry Rose with that team. I do like the they draft pick they got from Indiana Khalil Ware. He nice a big man him. Yeah I like him. Bam. Obviously he gonna do what he do but I think Jimmy gonna kill this shit 'cause I think he trying to, you know what I'm saying? Jimmy, Jimmy gonna kill it's the contract to Yeah you know what it is up Tom. He gonna go crazy. Yeah. Who is they starting Fort Row? Jimmy, Tyler Hero probably Bam probably and Ham probably. Yeah they smooth. Yeah they smooth. Yeah they can. They can compete with anybody. Yeah. Yeah they smooth but the last couple years they've been having, I mean with the injury shit like they've been at like even when they was at HC that went all the way up, you know what I'm saying?


Through all the way through the playoffs. It's just that they been having those injuries during the regular season. I think they said that Pat Riley and Jimmy kind of clashed that Jimmy Good fuck about a regular season like I'm about to come and do what I'm supposed to do when it matters like I done did this enough like you young niggas come figure that shit out. I hope Tyler Hero killed this year. That's one of my favorite players in the league. Really? You know Tyler Hero? I like Tyler Hero. I seen him when he was working out for the Pacers and I was like damn we didn't draft him. That's tough. Yeah I didn't draft a lot of motherfuckers. I'm excited for my game to be back rolling. Who was I? You see the hat? Oh today you fucking with, you fucking with the Celtics? Yeah I seen a AE disrespected my dog on national TV on Netflix. So you know what we back. Damn. What'd he say?


He ain't the best fucking player. They saying he the best player Fuck outta here. Yeah we back. Yeah the chimps are here. He said that about Jason Taylor? Yeah last year then the boo, you know what's crazy that press conference after he said that bro they talked to Jason Tatum so crazy last year. Like they like, he's like if Jason Tatum's the best player you can't win. I'm like god damn. Like how old is Jason Tatum again? 26, 27 Bro. Just because you have success early does not mean somebody sad. It just means they were just good early. Like I don't under, I hate that comparison so much. Nah, Jason Taylor got it turned up. They already divide like fuck what Anthony ever said this, this whole USA run he just had this summer. It should be enough ammo though.

He ain't no realer. Hey if my nigga pull out the Puma dress shoes, that's crazy. They definitely on the way. Nah man. I hope not. For real. All bullshit aside, I hope the pressure do have a good year. That's good for the city when they up hundred percent I think. I think they'll be so I think we a 50 win team for sure this year. How? How the coach doing Coach you know what I'm saying? Get well soon. Get well soon. Boy y'all niggas is crazy. They doing okay bro. They doing okay. What's their record? They two and three right now Ain't bad. Nah not really. They you know what I'm saying. AR was out so that I mean shit it is hard to win games without your friends and they had a lot of people missing the last game.


It's still almost one on a comeback victory. I ain't, I seen f Flaco was balling one time. Nah was Joe f Flaco went crazy fourth quarter but the coach is dealing with crazy injuries on defense and offense so I mean it's still early in the season. A lot of people ain't doing too well right now anyway. Unless you're the chiefs. It's just how it goes. 'cause Pat Mahomes don't lose Yeah much no matter who gets injured. No matter who believes they just whoop ass and continue to do so. I think the Ravens are really going to fuck people up later in the season because Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson is cheat and I think they finally got it figured out 'cause that comeback game because Cincinnati was insane. Yeah Devonte Adams, I don't know where he about to go. Hopefully not the Jets because that's a nasty place to be.


Aaron Rogers nigga fired a coach bro. They they getting they defense corner it bro. He shouldn't have got fired bro. Their defense was actually like solid. For real. It was. Yeah like that's crazy. He wasn't the problem at all. NFL spooky bro. And Aaron Rodgers pushing him like that bro. On the side line. It's crazy. A hey to sit down man it's over bro. Shout to aro man.

He had one of the worst situations ever I've ever seen in sport for him to get hurt day one in New York and then for him to get this coach fired like I ain't gonna say it's just him but I'm sure it's a lot of it bro. It was the points where he couldn't even come on Pat McAfee show no more. Aaron Rogers bro is a real menace and niggas don't speak on it more. I think it's something to do with that Packer's whole situation because George Love the only quarterback there. That's, that's cool. 'cause when Brett far came out that he had Parkinson's, niggas was like we don't give a fuck you stole money from people. Fuck you. Dang they was on that with him bro.
