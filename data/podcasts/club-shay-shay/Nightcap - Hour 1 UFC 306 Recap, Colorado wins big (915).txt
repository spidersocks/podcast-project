Ocho I was at UFC 3 0 6 tonight at the Sphere. It is unbelievable. It was incredible. How, how Was it, how was the sphere? It's nice. I can let, lemme lemme like this here. Yeah, It's great Ocho but the venue should not be the attraction. The event should be okay. It's so much going on. It's so beautiful. And the theatrics of it is that it overshadows whatever's going on in there. Ah, okay. And you know, and I get why Dana did it. 'cause when I sat down and interviewed him about two and a half months ago, he said they were gonna to have this as a, at the tribute to, to the Mexican heritage. I think it's Mexican independence.


What was, what is it? It's, but it was a Mexican theme. They had a movie in between every fight. So it, it was great ojo, but it just like, it just overwhelms the event. So you find yourself looking at the, the, the, the big video jumbotrons. And it's like you're watching a TV in your living room, even though they're like 200 inches long wide. Right, right. The lights, they got drones flying. It looks like birds are up in there. It is just anybody that's been there know exactly what I'm talking about. And obviously they're trying to have more events scheduled there, but it just overwhelms the event.


The venue does. How how many, how many, how many people you think the, the the the spear hold, What is it? Like 15, 20,000? Yeah, 18 and a half thousand 18. You know what, now that I sit here and think about it, it it, it's, it's such a nice event. Obviously I haven't been there. I'm not sure how much it cost to get in, but it's probably a PA pretty penny. Yeah. Like think about this in the future. Like, stay with me now. Nightcap in Vegas And the spear. Yeah. Yeah. That would be something unbelievable. Yes. Yes it would. Now that, Okay, well let's speak that into existence then.


Okay. Get Chad. I'm, I'm, I'm speak into e I'm gonna manifest Nightcap, unc and Ocho the sphere. Ah. Have I have, I have this ocho have this on there on the ball because you know, it glowed in life. You know what I'm talking about. Oh, I like it. I like I'm gonna manifest that. I mean, you put it, you could leave it up there a day. It costs you half a million for a day. We we got it. We got it. We do. Should be. Yeah. Right. We do. But it was incredible. Ocho Bwe chance, Rob this diva Shelia defeated Sugar Shane. Sugar Sean O'Malley by unanimous decision. Yeah. Ocho he just out wrestled him. Yeah.


O'Malley's gonna have to be careful. He has dynamite in his hands. But he kind of reminds you a lot of Conor McGregor. He has no, once he got on the ground he can't get up. Yeah. Yeah. Both of 'em. McGregor also had that problem. He was a great striker. Yes. He was a very, very good striker. But he wasn't really good on the ground. Nope. And when Con went down on the ground, he wasn't good at that. Really getting up outta stuff. Nope. And but how do you say his name, his first name? Mor. Mor Rob. What he was able to do, he was, he was able to tire able to tire him out the best. She, and he kept, he kept him off rhythm so he couldn't get any clean shots. 'cause he continuously bounced really the whole, the whole goddamn fight and pick and chose his spots and when to take him down. Yeah.


He's like the Energizer bunny. He just all, he just, he don't give you a whole lot of chance. And Yes sir, you're gonna have to fill up, you're gonna have to fill up early and you have to get on your bicycle because you know, you, you know, he's trying to measure him, trying to land those shots. And every time he take him down, he shoot takes him down and now he spend time and he pounding him, tying him up, tying him out. And that's the thing. O'Malley's gonna have to be really careful. I like him. He has, you know, he has dynamite in his hands. But Ocho you cannot be one. You don't need to be great at any good at at any one thing in UFC. You need to be good at a lot of things. Yes sir. And the people that are good at a lot of things.


Your John Jones, your George St. Pierre, it's guys like that have mighty miles, Demetrius Johnson. It's guys that have range that are able to survive and be multiple, what's the guy's name? The Brazilian, I forget his name. Anderson Silver. Anderson Silver. Yeah. You need to be good at a lot of different things. You need to be able to strike, you need to be able to take that wrestle. You need to be able to block wrestling. You need to be able to fight from the ground. You need to be able to get up and, and, and, and, and Sean is like, he can strike. He wants to stand and exchange with you. Well that's not your, why would I do that? Wait, that opponent.


Listen, you have to, you have to be able to adjust the opponents. Every, every opponent's style is gonna be different. Now, Mirage's style wasn't really in favor of Sean O'Malley. And based on what he likes to do. Yes. You know, he, he kept him on the move the entire fight. Yes. Had him guessing because he was, he was coming in and out, in and out. He wouldn't be still. Yes. He wasn't, he wasn't, he wasn't sitting in target. He wasn't gonna sit there and exchange with you. No, No Shit. So then you gotta, you gotta think about also you gotta be careful with rushing in. He can, he can take you down. You can get, you can get clipped. There's so many different things. So many different things and so many factors that go into fighting. It's, I mean it is a chess match in there. It was a one-sided fight. I was hoping it was Both fights.


Both, both, both. Championship fights. Valentina ship. She won easily. Yeah. O over Grasso. I mean, I mean basically she wrestled her. She kept, oh hey, hey, every time that's the thing, you keep you on your toe. You like, oh yeah, yeah, shoot, boom on the ground. Now I spend the next two to three minutes tying you out, getting punches in all this. But it was really a lopsided fight. I mean I I I'm very pleased with the, with the show that Dana put put on. Yeah. I'm not so he, so I'm not so sure he's pleased with the performance he's got. Because I mean, know people want to see knockouts. If you go to the UFC, you expect to see somebody get a a a clip.


You expect to see somebody get submitted, somebody get choked out something. And every and, and, and, and it seems like everything went to the, went to the cards. Now Diego Lopez and Brian Ortega, there was, I mean, or Lopez was throwing haymakers. I thought, I don't, I still don't know how Ortega survived. Yeah. I don't know Ocho 'cause he was hurt early in the fight. I thought he was out and he was able to survive that. But yeah, I I I thought, I definitely thought it would be a more interesting fight with O O'Malley. With O'Malley and Rab. But it wasn't because like you said, he kept in guessing. You heard, you heard, you heard the boo you heard the boos, right?


Yeah. You heard the boos. Yeah, I heard The boo. Because that's not what the people wanted to see. No, the people wanted to see actual fighting. But obviously when you get in there in the octagon, you gotta be strategic as a championship fight. So he had to do what he had to do to win the fight and listen it, it wasn't, it, it wasn't a fan favorite obviously it wouldn't be because Rob wouldn't sit there and exchange. Oh, why Would he? Yeah. Yeah. You gotta be tactical. Yeah. And that's what he did. I know you got heavy artillery. I got a knife and a slingshot and you want me to get and you want No, I'm gonna pick you off. I'm gonna wait and take my shot. I'm gonna take, I'm gonna wait until I get an opening and I'm gonna shoot my shot. Tie your ass up, put you on the ground because you gonna have to exert more energy to get me up off you than I do have to exert energy to stay on top of you.


And so that's all he did. The same thing with Connor. And I'm not saying he's Conor McGregor, but he reminds his fighting style. He has great power. Especially on his left. He can hit put you down with either hand. But once they get, once they got put on their backs. Yeah. Tough And. if you think about it, everybody that beat Connor, think about what they do. They drug him out the deep water. Get him on the ground, ground Him. What the, even on the boxing match, what did Floyd do? Drag him out the deep water. Even at his, at his age. Drag him out to the deep. Push him down. Yeah. And o' Manley's gonna have to get better at that. It's the look Rhonda Rousey, what she did for the female, for the women's in the ww in the UFC.


But she was too one dimensional. Yeah. If she couldn't arm bar you, she couldn't beat you. She couldn't leg lock you. She couldn't beat you. And once Har Holmes kicked upside the head, now all of a sudden Ocho that brain is is is slashed, slashed against the skull. It's easier. And then what Amanda Nunez says, I'm, we had Amanda Nunez. That fight was in New York. No it wasn't. We was in New York because that's when Connor fought Aldo, Jose Aldo. And she came on the set and she says, I'm gonna punish her. She says, I'm going to punish her. She's sitting. Right. I mean, I'm sitting here and she's sitting right there and I'm talking to her and you can see the look in her eyes.


And I remember telling Skip when, when the break came and she left. I said, she gonna knock, she gonna knock Rhonda out. Yeah. You could see how laser focused she was. And I think the fight was like a month away or something. You were locked in. Huh? She was locked in. And I knew a little bit about her, but the Linus came to be played with. She got dynamite in her hands. She's relentless. She can do it all. But that's what you need to be good at. Looking at these fighters that have really, that had staying power. You, you don't have to be great. You need to be good at a lot of different things. You gotta be able to wrestle. You gotta be able to strike. You could be able to sit, submit somebody, but you gotta be able to get up if you can't get up.


Because eventually somebody gonna get you, somebody gonna put your ass on your back, They gonna get you down. They Gonna, eventually, they'll And then what do you, then what happens? What is your defense then? But, but the, the, the event Dana did, Dana, you did an unbelievable job. Boy. The theatrics and the theme, the Mexican, the heritage and the way they had it going, Ocho it was, it was an unbelievable event. I just don't, IIII don't think Dana got what he wanted as far as, you know, submissions, knockouts, things of that nature. Lopez and Ortega had the best fight of the night for me.


There was another fight earlier in the game earlier. The black guy, I forget, I forget it was, I thought he had the dude hurt, he had him, I mean, dude tried to kick him. He got him and boom, caught him right on the button, head hit. I was like, oh, he got him. Dude got up. He fought through that. Ended up winning in three rounds. I, I, I think, I don't think it was a 30 27 considering that I, I would've gave him a ten eight considering that he com completely dominated the first round. I don't, I don't think it was, I don't think it was a 27. I think he had maybe a a maybe if you wanna say he lost, but not by the scores that they had it. But it was a good, it was a good, it was a good situation.


I, I'm glad I got an opportunity. I don't know if I'll go back to the sphere because the events that they've been having there, I don't know if that's kind of, you know, like the Eagles and YouTube. That's kind of not my thing. Now would I go see Beyonce there? Yeah. 'cause you gonna put on a show. Yeah. So it's a, it's a venue and a show within a show. I, I, I think probably two people that could, could, could put on a show there. You're probably looking at Beyonce and you're looking at Taylor Swift. Those are the only that come to my mind. Absolutely. For that venue ocho for that venue. Right. Right. To be Able to, to be, to be able to fill that venue up Because it ain't gonna be cheap. Oh. If you think those tickets are SoFi or wherever Beyonce and Taylor Swift go, you think those tickets are high.


Right. Boy, you talking about Empire State Building, Now listen, you have to understand something now you talk about Beyonce and Taylor Swift being able to fill up the spear. Now, I don't think for one minute, if we have enough promotion ahead of time, we can't fill that thing up to 19,000. Now don't don't do that. We might, we might, we might be a year. We might be a year away. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We, we ain't no year away. 'cause listen, I can get, I can get 10,000 from Cincinnati to come out to support. And you can get, you can get 10,000 from Denver or Baltimore to come and support For I get by get by, get by the, get about the, about a thousand to come from the A TL for sure. Oh Yeah.


Oh yeah, yeah, For sure. Oh yeah. They, they definitely coming. It's, it's the, listen, my grandma always told me, man, the tongue is a powerful thing. So some of the things that you speak most of the time it, you, you, you could speak things into existence. Yeah, yeah. That's a possibly a possibility in a year. Yeah. I mean, look, I mean there, there'll probably be some other people that could probably like Adele, I mean Yeah, ADE voice. I mean, but you gotta see Adele voice. She needs to be in a, in a venue where you can appreciate it. Yeah. Like I'm talking about. Appreciate it man. Yeah. The sound bounce with a sound bounce off the ceiling and it come right back to you. So you, you get a better understanding on, on on the purity.


Yes. And, And the effortless effortlessness that she can sing with And Yeah. That and her voice, because she's a storyteller. She gonna sit down, you know, she's gonna sit on the steps and she gonna tell your story. Yeah. Where she was in her life, what she was doing. When this song came to her, she started writing it down Ocho. But man, you gotta hear that woman's voice, that woman. Yeah. I've, hold on. I've never heard Whitney in person. I've never heard Mariah in person. What? I can only imagine. Never heard Aretha there. There've been some great singers. O Joe, don't get me wrong, but Lemme give one to you. Lemme give one to you ain't said yet. Now. Yeah.


One of the most soulful can sing any genre of music and to me has one of the top voices in the world. Ade is nice. You ever heard Kiki Wyatt singing in person? I have not heard Kiki Wyatt. She got, she got, she got, she got, she got Laurens on her. Ask the chat. Now I let the, I'll let the chat tell you. Chad, she got chance. Kiki, Wyatt, man, come on now. She can take you to church. She can give you r and b. She can give you rhythm and blues. She can give you pop. Right. Hey, listen, that woman now, when it comes to singing and And, we talk about range, you Know, Hey. Oh. So you know who else would be good in there? I don't know if you've ever seen him.


Bruno Mars. Oh man, listen, Bruno Mars is one of the, one of the better performers of our generation now. He, he doesn't get the credit he deserves. He is one of the better performers. Listen, when you talk about stage presence, he can do it. And being able to command the crowd, command the crowd. He can sing, he can dance, he can play instruments. Yeah. He good? Yeah. Oh yeah, he good. I've seen, I've seen him a couple of times. I've seen him a couple of times and, and, and, and, and and perform. And he's, he's unbelievable. Yeah. Be nice. Be Really nice. But Dana, thank you for the ticket. Jordan and I went to the, went there tonight and we had a good time.

There was not having a good weekend after that game. Yeah. Matt had the Cox on that official pick. And I think the Cox a lot. The only problem is I think my three college losses were the three games I was most confident in. Yeah. Iowa was Was the two you mentioned. And then Iowa and those were the only three I lost period.

I thought you'd go be in Chicago. I was in Chicago yesterday. I'm back in Miami. How you gonna be? So you, so you gonna come back here just for a fight? Listen, I, I went, I went, I went, I went to my homeboy wedding. My homeboy Ryan. Yeah, he got married. I came, I left last night. So what I could have done, if there was an invite or formal invite, you know, for me, I could have left and, and caught a flight out to Vegas just to be able to enjoy the spirit with you so I could actually have a better understanding on your explanation of, of how great it was all and how the student itself took away from the acts of event itself.


But I, I didn't get an invite. I'll tell What That's what, okay, I'll tell you. Hold on. The next fight, the three Oh, fight three. Oh, what is it? CPA, Milch and John Jones is gonna be a Madison Square Garden, Right? I I think I might, I I might, it there's a chance. Honestly, I, it was a surprise for the Chad. It was a, a surprise for you. There's a chance I might be on that 3 0 7 card. I'm, I'm just, I'm just throwing that out there now. So, So Yeah. But like I said, if the like fights here now, if you, if you know, I can, you know, like I said, I know Dana, Dana, like Dana's been, because when the UFC used to be with Fox, he would always come on.


Yeah. I would ban him search and such. You know, we had a big old bet he ended up buying me like an expensive bottle of, of liquor because I had him that Floyd was going win. He had Connor obviously. And so, but yeah, if you, if you coming out here and you wanna go to a UFC fight, just let me know. But then, but then that forces us to be late. And I know you be ready to go to bed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. See, see the reason I was able to stay up tonight and, and, and, and be able to give my all you can tell by my energy took A nap. You took a nap today. Y'all took a nap. I took a nap today. So if we wanna stay on until five o'clock, you know, here on no, five o'clock Eastern. I'm, I'm okay. Yeah.

All right. All right. Just checking. You know I'm good. Oh, Joe Colorado goes on the road beat instate rival Colorado State, the Buffalo's 28, the Rams nine, Travis Hunter and Shado Sanders lead Colorado to ate win over CSU Travis Hunter caught two of Shado four touchdown passes, also had an interception and a pass breakup. Remember last year Travis suffered a lacerated liver, a late hit by Henry Blackburn.


Trav caught a touchdown against Blackburn. Today, Shado was 36 or 49. Three ten four touchdowns, zero ints offensive, offensive line did an unbelievable job. If you didn't know better, they were guarding the, the vault at a bank. You know how they'd be standing in front of the vault? Yeah. That's how they stood today. The Buffalo was wearing their new all white uniforms and the defense came up big. They came to play. This is what we're talking about, forcing four turnovers today. And they dominate CSUI guess what, yeah, I guess them Instagram followers, they can play some football too. CS u Yeah. 28, 29 Buffaloes over the Rams Ocho What did you like about what you saw today?


I enjoyed the offensive play from the offensive line. That's what I enjoyed. What they didn't have last week, Shado getting himself hit running for his life. I think the lineman must have been upset about that. They got, they got whatever they needed to get outta their system and came in this game, had a clean pocket for the majority of the game and was able to, to deliver the ball that got damn Travis Hunter. Unc. Well, he's some special Oh yeah, he yeah, he got steel. That Boy, right, that boy, something special. Not only was he dominant on the offensive side of the ball, had a pass breakup, had an interception read the, he ran the dig route. Fuck the fuck.


Yeah, he, he undercut, he jetted he undercut that. He ran the whole route. So listen, they looked very good to, to bottom and all three phases of the game. Offense, defense and I, I'm, I'm excited, I'm excited for them to take this momentum going into next week and continue to, and continue to build off this win. I'm, I'm, I'm happy for Prime man. I'm happy for him. I'm be, I'm most happy for the offense and defensive line. They had six sacks. Hill Green had two, Hayes had two and a half green. The second had a, had a half a sack. That's what that, you know, Bentley had a sack and you know, when they brought specialist in sap, SAP specialist was getting to the quarterback QB killer.


And it's not for lack of coaching. 'cause I know they're being very well coached. Sack is telling me, you know, getting em how to play on edges because you're not playing down the middle of a demand. You're not gonna co constantly bull rush the guy and get to the quarterback. It's gonna take you too long and all you're gonna do is make yourself tired. So he's getting them playing on edges. I thought they did a very good job. I, I'm surety probably told him like, we gotta do a better job against the run 31 for a buck 31, which is four yards of care. You can live with that. But it really, the, the run really didn't hurt him. Ocho I, I thought Colorado came out there with a purpose. They seemed very, very focused. And talking to time, he's like, look, we good enough. The guys just didn't play well.


They just didn't play well. Hey. He said, you know, I shoot you straight. If it, if it was anything else, they just didn't play. Well, they can do it because I see them do it. I see. I watch him in practice. And so, but, and he said he expected that he expected them to dominate CSU today. They dominated CSU today. They did. And so he, that's what he told me when he called me the other day, he said he expected him to dominate because he was gonna jump on, he was gonna jump on with us Wednesday or Thursday. He said, but I wanna make sure he say, he said, man, you know, you know how they would be on me. So, oh yeah, I gotta make sure I stay locked in. He said, but I, I'll circle back, I'll circle back with y'all. I I get what you, I said, Hey, handle your biz because I you are right because you come on with us and things don't go your way on Saturday.


They gonna say the reason why you lost the game is that you came on night camp like, like we had some influence over. So I said, bro, I totally get it. You ain't gotta explain anything to me. But I appreciate, I appreciate your support and, and even, even even thinking about coming on. So congratulations time and the cu Buffaloes as they roll 28 9 over the Colorado State Rams. They defeat their in-state rival for the seventh straight time. Go ahead Ojo. Who they got, who they play next? Who Colorado got next? Who do they got next?


Baylor in. Baylor or they play in, in, in cu. Oh, they got Baylor at, at the cu That's the win game for Mojo. Huh? That's, that's the win game. Ain't like, ain't like Baylor got RG three. Hell Hold on Baylor, throw the ball all over the pace now. That's okay. So guess what? You throw it, you open your quarterback to get hit in the back of his head. Yeah, You right. You right back that. Yeah, right back that. So Baylor, Baylor probably bay ain't got no gangsters like that no more. I mean they, they gonna throw the ball at me. Look, when you throw the ball, you gonna have, look, you gonna be able to get a receiver if you throw the ball a lot, you gonna be able to get a, get the receiver because what receivers wanna do, Ocho catch the ball. You wanna catch the ball and you'll, you'll get your quarterback because the quarterback's don't wanna throw the ball.


So I'm not saying you gonna get a, a five star quarterback, but you'll get you a good decent three, three and a half, four star guy to go there that want to throw the ball, get an opportunity to play and you'll get some guys that can catch it. 'cause they want to catch they got, I'm sure they got some athletes. I, I haven't given a whole, I haven't really studied them, but I'll take a look at 'em this week. 'cause I, I'm pretty sure that we gonna be, we're gonna talk about 'em next week. So I'll give them, give 'em a look and look at some of their guys and see where they were and and, and the returning guys that they had and what they did last year and some of the guys that came coming outta high school and see what they were they 3, 4, 5 stars. So yeah. We'll, we'll we'll see what's going on. Georgia survives a scare number one Georgia on the road in Kentucky.


They won the game. 1312. Mark Stoops had a chance. Ocho fourth down. Yeah, the number one team in the country down won with three minutes. He punted, he pun the football And hoping his defense will be able to hold Georgia Far down. If it ain't fourth and 25, I'm going for it. Anything left going for it? Listen, it's something like that. You gotta, you gotta pull the Dan Campbell, you gotta pull the Dan Campbell and let your players know. Listen, I'm going for this against the number one team in the country. Yes. Why? 'cause I believe in y'all. Yes. I believe in y'all pun it on fourth and one when you up one against the number one team in the country.


That's basically telling your players, you know what, I don't think y'all can get it done. Exactly. I don't think y'all can get it done. So I'm, I'm gonna take the safe route and just hope and cross my fingers that my defense does what they need to do on the following drive. Yeah. That, that, that makes, that makes no sense to me Ocho at all. And then you got the ball back with nine seconds. What the hell you gonna gonna do with that? Hope you'll get a flutie. You, you, you wanna get that in, They're go For it. You get that in the video game. Lemme ask you a question Ocho Here's the thing though. If you got that much confidence in your defense that they're gonna hold them, go for it right there and have confidence in your defense that you're gonna hold them. I as well.


I mean because that's what you said. We gonna punt the ball, try to pin you down and then we gonna use our time out. Okay. If you got that confidence, go forward on fourth down. Believe in your defensive, don hold them and give you the ball back. It ain't that complicated. Sometimes they make it a lot more complicated than what it needs to be if you believe. Yeah. Yeah. So I I get it. I get by the Kentucky fans. Well Bo boy we got the number one team in the country, a team that's only lost one game. What? Lost one game in the last three years. One back Toback national championship and Blue Florida State out last year, 65 to seven And. we got 'em on the road, we got 'em dead to right and you point the ball Over.


Overthinking, overthinking not being aggressive, Man. But that's a no-brainer right there, Ocho. Yeah, Because look what you had the ball at. It's a no-brainer for you. It's a no-brainer for some of the people in the chat. Now, for the coach whose ass is tight in a situation like that, not wanting to make a mistake and hoping that his defense can do what they need to do. If you pin them back and force 'em to have to drive the field, maybe they might be able to stop it. But here's The thing, Ocho Yeah. If you believe your defense is going to stop him, why not go four on fourth down? Because, because that's what they're saying. They say, look, if we go four on fourth down, we believe our defense can stop you.


Right. If I got, if, if I got you, if I'm going in and I go four on fourth down and I don't set for the field goal, you, I'm telling you our defense is gonna stop you, punch the ball And, we still gonna have the ball in, in, in your territory. So in that situation, okay, defense, I got trust in you. I I I, first of all, I don't believe we're gonna need you because I believe my offense is gonna be able to get this first down. But just for the, if we don't, I kind of know y'all, I know y'all gonna get it back. I know y'all gonna get us a three and not get this ball back. Boom, here we go. Get it right back down the field. All we need is a field goal to win. But I don't know why the hell he put that ball down down one against the number one team in the country.


It's only lost one game in three years and back to back national champions. It don't make no sense. And They lo hold on, think about how many, four and five star recruits. I mean if they got 85 players, they dressed out 85 players, 75 of them four and five stars. Yeah, They probably got two walkon to make it look nice. But ain't no, ain't no one star. Right? Three it's four. It's four and five. Yeah. I don't, I don't, I don't even think coach would understand what that would do for the team, for the morale to be able to come off and pull off upset like that. Hell Yeah. Not only pull off upset but actually go for it man. You know what that would do for them Young Bulls man on that team, man.


Yeah, Well no I don't know 'cause he didn't go for it so we'll never know. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Well Billy Nappi was booed as uf University of Florida flaws to the Aggies, Florida lost to Texas a and m in its first time starting Marcel Reed by two touchdowns after the gate of quarterbacks tossed three picks. Florida looked an up on both sides of the ball and Overmatched for the second time this season in the swamp. First one against Miami. Miami beat the brakes off him. And guess what that put the pressure on Billy Napier? This one could result in Napier getting, I mean, I don't know what's going on. If the with the, what is that North? Well, mid, that's in the mid that's in the west north, North northern Florida.


Yeah, with Gainesville in Tallahassee. I listen, I told you, I told you the best team in northern Florida is fam UFMU fam U Football is the best team in northern Florida. They better than Tallah. I mean they better than Florida State. Yeah, they better than I mean that, that's just what it is. And you know what, I think it's, if I'm not mistaken, Daniel Robinson, I think Daniel Robinson is a quarterback for, for FAMU. Matter of fact he could probably come and play at FSU and at Florida and do a better job than what they have there right now. That's how good he's, if I might, I might have his name wrong. If I do, I apologize. But man, young bull, young Bull's nice man. Young bulls nice. I think you Aint nice Florida and Florida State. Yeah.


Yeah. So, so wrong. I'm not sure what's wrong. I'm not sure what's wrong, but I think unless until they get a quarterback, which I thought Florida State had, or which I thought FSU had, I mean FSU, which I thought Florida had, it shouldn't be that difficult. Quarterbacks should be lining up wanting to play these Preti Preti, prestigious pwi. I I talking about PWIs. Wait, that is a pwi Yeah. Predominantly white institutions. Yeah, it's, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. It's only a small percentage of us that makes up their Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean they have Predominantly white institutions. Yes. That's what PWI I means. Okay. Yeah. What you thought of me? Me? Yeah. You thought I what you gonna say?


dwi? I, I I don't, I don't, I don't. You know what? I don't even know what it meant. I, I'm gonna be honest to you, I'm gonna be HBCUs historically. Black College of University, What that means, Pwi predominantly white institutions. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I appreciate that History lesson though.

Oh, check this out. Napier is now 10 and six at Florida Field, giving him more losses in the swamp in two plus season than Steve Spurrier, who was 68 and five at Home Urban Mile, who was 35 5 at home had in their entire successful stints in Gainesville. If Florida were to fire Napier Napier's buyout would be roughly $26 million. Well he finna get that buyout anyway. He finna get that buyout. Yeah. How long you thinking about that? How, how long you think they gonna let this gone? Oh, ain't let this go. Ain gonna let, listen the fans, the administration is not gonna let it go on too long. Somebody from high up, matter of fact, the goddamn boosters, Hell, they Have a lot of leverage.


Oh yeah, yeah. The boosters fixing to get him up outta there. Yeah, they finna get him, man. How much they bought a a, a Jimbo for damn near 80 million at Texas. They, they don't play, they don't play. Texas bought out Charlie Strong for damn near 30 million. Yeah. Oh they can. Hey, hey. They got them guy to cut them, write them checks Quick in a hurry until they get the results they want. Yeah. I'm not sure who, I'm not sure the coach is who will stand in or be the, what's, what's the correct terminology for the coach? Interim interim that stands Interim Interim, huh? Interim. Yeah, interim. I don't know who's gonna be the interim head coach, but for some reason when the interim steps in, sometimes, sometimes you get the results you want.


Sometimes you don't. If you don't get 'em with the interim coach that that's lets you know how bad your team is. Yeah. How bad your team really is. You know what they always say, coaches get players fired now, But guess what? Players Get coaches fired. Excuse me, I'm saying it backwards, But guess what Ocho Huh? All them players that's on that University of Florida team. Yeah. Billy Napier bought 'em there. Hmm. So if they not good enough that that's his fault, he'd recruit them. Yeah. How you think they got there? You know, I, I'm, I'm they probably good though. Them boys probably good. I can't tell right now. Well they not playing good. Yeah. The results not showing up. No.


Damn. Oh, Mr. Napier, man, I, James Richard Smith used to tell all the time the special teams coach, he be running the film. He stopped the film. He say, son, that effort right there, that's good enough to get you cut and me fired. And that's a lose lose Every time. Man. Yo, yo man, look, I wish you, I wish I could have by myself phone recording in a meeting room so you could hear like, people can actually hear like what the coaches actually be saying and you're like, Yep. They don't wanna hear that. They don't wanna hear that because they gonna, they gonna look at coaches differently. They would, they would, They gonna look at coaches differently. But they don't talk like that.


Now, I don't know if they, man I've been, I you've been gone a decade. I've been gone two decades, so I don't know how they talk. But back then probably not. Yeah, Yeah. You can't say, you cannot say, because somebody gonna tell on the coaches ain't gonna get fired because you can't talk. Boy, y'all know, y'all know how it was. If you played football, you remember when you were younger how the coaches would talk and what they would say and say all kind of things that's deemed inappropriate, insensitive. Now given, you know, our, our situation And, we understand that and we're good. Change is good. Change is good. But I'm just saying back then there was no filter and coaches said things.


You knew exactly what he, what he, what he meant. Yeah, But man, who we Yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's a bad situation. No Joe. That's Florida. Florida. Oh. If this thing gonna turn around in a hurry, Florida State and Florida. Oh, this coaches gone. Oh. You think they gonna, they they gonna fire Florida State head coach too? Hell Yeah. He ocho Do you know what he did? They had a, they had a game schedule. They moved the game so they could play that team in 2029. They paid Memphis 1.2 million to come. They paid basically 1.8 million to get their ass kicked. Yeah. Yeah.


He owning three. That's two games he's lost at home. That's tough. Now That's tough. Oh we, oh, Memphis is a, is a team obviously you putting your schedule so you can be Yes. So you can beat You pay. Oh Joe, anytime you pay somebody that kind of money, like that's you paying somebody money, you like, oh yeah, we got them. It's just like homecoming. If you on somebody's homecoming, they put you there for a reason. Why the hell you think you're the homecoming? They got all these alumni coming in, the kids, I mean, some students gonna come to the game, they ain't never came to the game. All the tailgating that's going on, they got you on there for a reason. It's unfortunate, but you know, It's so, oh yeah, they about to get him up outta there.


My grandfather used to say, boy, you can get, you got two choices, get good or get going. That's the only two choices you got. I don't And if you look at Florida, if you look at Florida schedule, if you look at Florida State schedule, I don't think it gets any easier for them. Hell nah. I don't think it gets any easier. So you could look at They still got Georgia. Yeah. You could look at them going er, er I don't, maybe not the whole season unless they squeeze out a game and do something. Surprisingly, somebody could, could have a a zero, a donut at the end of the season. They say Mike Novell's bond of 65 million. I don't know. That might what, that might keep him. But that might have to keep him, that might have to keep him another year. Because if you buy somebody ocho, you buy somebody, somebody out, bring somebody else in.


You have to pay them 50 million. Both Of 'em. Yeah. You got, you guys double Up. Hell yeah. 65. 65 I Mike Nobel. How much, what? Damn, how much is he making? Oh, I think he got a new deal after he was like, he was about to go with, they thought he was gonna go to the, the college football playoff last year. So they was undefeated. So he got that d he got that deal. That's Right. That's right. So that's how he got it. Yeah. He had a squad though last year, but he had a squad last year. Yeah. Damn. Arch Manning accounted for five touchdowns and the Longhorns 56 7 win over UTSA, university of Texas San Antonio OCHO filling in for an injured starter.


Cute Quinn ERs betting favorite to win the Heisman Trophy entering in this weekend. Left Saturday this game with a strain. Oblique did not return. Manning threw a touchdown on his first place from scrimmage hitting Deandre Moore for a 19 yard scoring strike to lead 21. Nothing. Then he showed off something. His uncles, Eli Peyton never had speed. He, he raced for 67 yard touchdown. The longest touchdown by Texas quarterback. Since Vince Young Mangan counted for two touchdowns on his first three plays from scrimmage. Who, What'd you think? O Joe? You like what you saw? Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Shit. Arch's gonna be nice. Now Art's gonna be nice to the fact that he has a dynamic that neither, neither Peyton nor Eli had, you know, being a dual threat. He got that from his grandpa. He, because Archie could run. Archie could run. No, no. He could really run. Yeah. Oh, so it miss them. Yeah. Skip generation sometimes. Skips a generation. Yeah. Yeah. Because sometimes you'll have twins, like you might have grandparents that are twins. Right. Or, you know, uncle and aunt or uncle and aunts. And then it'll skip a generation. So their kids, they won't have any twins, but the kids keep, will have the, the twin. And so probably it probably still, it definitely ain't no problem. It did because Eli Payton Day, I love Peyton. I don't, I've been around Eli a little bit, but I know Payton pretty well because he used to go back a lot to Denver.


He still resides in Denver. They can't run. They slow. Okay. Ain't no, you know, try to be okay, you know. No, they slow as hell. Yeah. Barry, when you talk about your typical prototype style quarterback Yes. That, That's them. But You know what? They do have pocket presence. Yes. And footwork, pocket presence and footwork. And they have a feel for the game. Yes. And they know when something coming, they, they have a good feel for the game. Peyton is like Tom Cruise in Minority Report. He up there on that board. Yep. Yep. His ability to process information, his ability. I saw this thing, I think it was, was, was Tom Brady that Joker kept every playbook.


Oh yeah. You saw it all. Yes. Yeah. That's crazy. They did the same thing. So, because a lot of times defensive coordinators, they're gonna become head coaches and guess what? That style, so yeah, you was over here and, and, and let's just say you was in the New England, right. You became, and you know, okay, this is the style he likes to run or you, you know, so Yeah, I get it. I get it. I threw my, I threw my playbook right back in the middle of that bin after the, you know what I'm saying? Because you had to bring out, you know, you bring your playbook to the stadium Mo yo, so yeah, you looking at it right before you know, and you go out there on the field like, okay, make sure everything okay, this okay.


Right. I I'm, I'm hot on this right here. Okay. They need to bring X, Y, and Z, blah blah, blah, so forth. Hey, before we go, before we go out on choke, put it into what? Put it in that bin. Yeah. Hey, get a new one. Same thing with the your playbook and training camp. Before you leave training camp last day, throw it in the bin. We good. And you know, back then, you know Mike, hell, you ain't getting them checks. That playbook ain't in there. You don't get that check. Oh, you have this damn thing. I didn't need my money. Damn. Damn. Have that playbook. Yeah, but he played extremely well. Or Joe, I don't know how long Quinn s are gonna, is going to be out.


But Arch did what he was supposed to do. A five star recruit, highly recruited, highly sought after probably anywhere in the country. He went there because of sarc. Sarc does a great job of developing quarterbacks. You look at the quarterbacks that he developed at USC, you look at the quarterbacks he developed at the University of Alabama goes without saying. Right. You know, Tua m Jones, Bryce Young was, I think Bryce Young might have had a a, a year up on the of him, even though he didn't start because he came after Mac Jones. You look at what he did, I think Carson Palmer was at that, that lineage.


Matt Ard. Matt Bark. Matt Barkley. So if you look at, and he developed quarterback, well, you know how the managers are thinking. They're not just thinking co collegiately, they're thinking next level. Who's gonna be the best guy to develop Arch and to make sure that when he comes, when it comes time for the draft, he's ready. He's developed and ready to play quarterback. And they felt Sark gave them that best opportunity. And Sark resume speak for itself. Hey Sark. What's up man? Great job. Lemme try to think, do I want, Hey, send me a, a Texas jersey.


Nah, I take a helmet. Texas. Yeah. Mm. I don't nothing back. That's all I know. Congratulations Arch. Good job. University of Texas 56 7 win over University of Texas, San Antonio. The Memphis Tigers kept Florida State semial winner OCHO FSU Bass even got even worse. 20 to 12 victory in front of a exa exasperated crowd. The results snapped a nine game wheeler streak in the series for Memphis, which last defeated Florida State in 1976. Hmm. That probably was a Bobby Bow, probably first year Wait in 76?


Yeah. I think Bobby Bow got there probably like 74. 75. It 76 might've been his first year. 76, 86, 9 6. Listen. Yeah, he was there in like late seventies. I'm hoping About get to Coach Biden, get to Florida State because He Florida state quarterback, he was, confidence is shot right now. dj, I DJ something, right? Yeah. I think his confidence is shot. It shot real bad. It shot real bad. Ojo. Where about about in Florida State? 76. Yeah, You did. Okay. You Yeah, but Florida State ain't got them dogs that you used to have Now.


Oh no. You gotta think back then. Everyone stayed in the state of Florida. You had three, you had three choices. Florida State or Florida. Yep. You didn't wanna go, you didn't wanna go anywhere else Because you think about what they had man, they had Sammy Smith. They had th they had Leroy Butler, man. They had a boy, they had a Florida state used to have Odell, Odell Hill, Rell, Buckle Re Yeah, They had some boys now, But all, all of them. Yeah. All but all, all the Florida schools used to. They used to be loaded. They used to be loaded. Unbelievable. And then, you know, guys started leaving.


They started going to Alabama and Ohio State, and they started leaving to Georgia and they started leaving. You know Why, you know, under that table now? Yeah. They weren't, they weren't just leaving just to be leaving. They was, they was NIL been going on for years. Oh, That, that that's what they call it. Yeah. It just wasn't called NIL. Yeah, they called briefcase. It just so happens you go to school and every and every four and five star, like the same type of car. Everybody got a, got a charger or a challenger. So it don't nobody like Don, nobody like no Ford. Yeah. Or those, or those Chevrolets. So everybody's just like dodge, everybody just like him. Me Crazy how that work.


Yeah. But boy, Florida State. Florida State, Ooh, woo. They gotta do something. They gotta do something. They gotta do something fast. They schedule don't get no easy either. Nope. After starting the season, off rank number 10, the co in the country, Florida State became the first team in the AP poll history to start within the top 10 and lose three consecutive games to unranked teams to begin the year. And if I'm not mistaken, the poll era started in 1936. Ash, gotta look at it. She make me sick. I just wanna give I didn't Chad. I just want y'all to know Ash make me sick. Okay. Could I say that? Ash make me sick. The Seminoles became, also became the third team since 1988 to open the season with a record of oh and three.


Follow the top 10 rank Why you got your all folded ash. What, what? So what, what, what you mean? Right? Oh, the poll era started in 1936. Oh, you was right. You was right. Yeah. You had, you was on point. Yeah. I knew something. I knew something when she folded. Her arms don't show. She's sitting over there like this. Here You, you, you know, you, you be knowing. You be knowing your stuff. Now you telling yourself, I gee that The Volume,
