Wow. No one does that better, baby. Thanks. Do it again. Say all that again, baby. Hello. Welcome to another episode of Shehe. I am your whole shadow shop. Come on now. Put them damn cars down and read all that again. Oh brother, thank you. Thank you. We stop by. I want to toast you for your amazing, amazing career. Thank you. Not only in front of the camera, but behind the camera and your standup career. Monique, thanks for stopping by today. Thank you for having me Brother Shea. Thank you. Better drink some water after That one. Okay. Who? Yes indeed. Lemme just say this before we start.


Yeah. This right here? Yeah. I'm gonna talk right to the sisters. One sip and get you right there. Now I'm back to you, Shay. I'm back to you, baby. That's enough for me, baby. But oh sisters, if you're trying to make up with your man, if you're trying to get pregnant, this right here, Shannon Sharp, one sip. Take care. All your woes, baby. That thing right there. Okay. Monique, when you hear everything that I read on the card, what goes through your mind when you hear that? What goes through my mind when I hear you read that? I'm humbled by that. I'm grateful for that.


I've been allowed to share a gift. 'cause that's what it is. But when you start reading that, there's a part that says who is he talking about? And there's another part that says, I'm grateful that I was able to put that work in to achieve those things. But all with humility. You said you want, we were talking off camera, you said, I want to get something, there's something I wanna share with you. Yes. And I need to get it off my chest early Because that's why I'm looking at you now. Like you going into that. Because I told you we could not talk till I dealt with you. Listen, okay. So let me say this to you. The day I watched Skip Bais, okay. Lose himself with you. And that's what he did. He lost himself.


And when I watched Skip Bais say to you, put them goddamn glasses back on, boy. Now I know he didn't say goddamn and boy, but that's what everybody heard. And I was waiting for you to snatch his ass across that table, baby and give it to him. I was like, Shannon, this is the perfect time. I don't condone violence, right? I don't say be violent, but that day I was in my feelings for two days. Me and my grandbaby could not watch you for two days. And my husband had to say, mama, let's talk about this. Look at Shannon Shaw. He retired in 2004, but he could still get on that field and run touchdowns, tackles everything. Had he snatched, skipped ballis across that table, he would've died in Shannon's arms that day.


Right? So Brother Shehe handled that. Right? Now we can talk. Okay? I just had to get that off of me because I know everybody around the world heard what I heard know. He didn't say them words, but we heard it in his mind. And we was looking for you to say space and opportunity. Skip space an opportunity. Come on. That's, that's that be more coming outta you. Y You know what? That's the, your Aunt Mary coming outta me. That's your Aunt Mary coming outta me, baby. I got a aunt named Maryelle. Monique, you and her are a spitting image. I remember the very first time I saw you and my sister and I, we were talking and my sister looked at me and I looked at her. I said, she's a spiting image of my Aunt Mary.


And you are, you are. Hopefully we gonna put pictures up when we, when we run this. So you are from Baltimore? Yes. And I read everything that I read. When you were growing up in Baltimore, what did a young Monique wanna be? Just what I'm doing right now, baby. You Dreamed of this. Just when I tell you Shannon from a little girl, I always wanted to be famous. Okay? Because I saw the Jackson five. Okay. And I saw people screaming for them and hollering and I'm like, dammit, I want 'em to scream and holler for me. But I couldn't sing. Right? But I knew somewhere I was gonna be famous, right? So I prayed to the universe, just let me be famous. I didn't understand what all came with that as a little girl, right?


You just see the lights, the glamor, the glitz, and you fall in love with that. So that little girl fell in love with the lights, the glamor and the gl, the glitz. That little girl fell in love with a woman named Oprah Winfrey. Oh, on a local talk show in Baltimore called People are talking. And when I looked at that woman, Shannon, I saw me, I saw a big woman with a big head, big shoulders, and big feet. And I said, if that woman can do that, so can I. So that's what that little girl was thinking about from Baltimore. Are You the type of person that if you see someone do something one time, that means it can't be done again? Because you saw Oprah do do it.


You said, well Oprah do it. Why can't Monique do it? I think Oprah, when I saw her do it as a little girl, was a push. However, had I not seen Oprah, my dreams would've still been my dreams. Okay. But when you see somebody that's inside of that space, because how many big black women are on TV even now? Correct? So back then you didn't see any big black woman on TV that was doing it. So I think had I not seen her, I would've still wanted to do it. But seeing her letting me say, okay, it's possible. It's right there. Right? What was Monique like as a little girl? What you seeing right now? Baby Ain't nothing. So you always, I just got, listen, let me tell you something.


A lot of people in this industry don't like me, right? Yeah. They didn't like me as a little girl, Shannon. I'm so used to this shit. People didn't like me. 'cause I was gonna tell it. I'm going to tell, I'm going to tell on you. So what you said right now is the same thing you getting, they tried to fight my ass in the 12th grade, Shannon, and they surrounded me, right? A group of them. Okay. Wanted to fight on me. Why? Because I told the truth. What you tell? I told, I told Andre that that was not LA's baby because that's, that's what la That ain't your place. Let me tell, wait a minute. Oh, sugar, you gonna calm yourself down. Okay? Do you see Shannon losing herself for this? You better back that up Shannon.


Lemme tell you something. Okay? Okay. I'm a person for, right, right, right. And if you tell me something and you say, Monique, I've done something to somebody, but don't say nothing Shannon, I'm gonna need you to fix that. Because if you don't fix it, I'm gonna have to tell that because it's wrong. So when she tells me this is not his baby, but I'm gonna tell him it's his baby, I can't let you do that. That's not right. Wow. So what I stand for is, right, and, and I think where we run into a problem in our community, in our group, we get so caught in, well that's not your place, but you see wrong happening, right? So when you see wrong happening, what you do, do you just stand back and say, that ain't my business.


Or do you look and say, well I knew that wasn't his baby. Now the baby 21 years old and he trying to find his father. What you gonna do? I'm asking you what you gonna do. Well, honestly, Monique, if somebody say, well she, I'm gonna tell you something and I'm gonna tell you this in confidentiality and I don't want to go any further than me. You and this table. Yes. It stays with me, him and the table. Well, let me say this because I'm gonna go back and forth with your hands, okay? I would say, before you tell me did you hurt somebody, Okay? Yes. Before you tell me, is this something that would make me question your character? Before you tell me, you gotta be clear about what you get ready to tell me. Because if you're getting ready to tell me something and I know that you've done something wrong, I know that you are wrong and I not say anything.


That's why people are allowed to keep harming people for years to come see Harvey Weinstein. Yes. Well, there's a lot of people that knew what was happening, But they felt it wasn't their place. It wasn't their, it wasn't them place. Right. Until it becomes you. So I think the moment we get into a space, and I was in the 11th grade at the time, right? Okay. But when we get into a space where we say, listen, if I know you're doing wrong and I take a position that's not my place, eventually you will succumb to what you support. What was your relationship with the young lady that told you this in confidentiality? When you, I'm Not gonna focus in on, I was in 11th grade, now I'm 56.


But when she told me, I told her I'm going to tell, see I'm that. I'm going to tell him what you said. So we clear. I'm going to tell him what you said because that's not right. Oh My goodness. Mo See, I think that's the problem that we're dealing with right now, Shannon. Okay. When we know something is wrong, everything Kat Williams sat here and said, right. We all know it to be the truth. However, we get so caught up in, well I ain't gonna say nothing. Right. Well, can you believe he said it or can you Or it's the messenger. It is the messenger baby. We get so caught up in the messenger that we'll overlook the message.


People have a hard time hearing a five foot, five giant. Tell the truth. People have a hard time with a black woman over 200 pounds. Tell the truth. Because people that look like us, we should just be grateful we got invited to the party. Right? Right. We should just be grateful that someone paid us attention. I've dealt with that my whole life. I've dealt with that. So when you get to a space where you say, listen, I wanna be free, I wanna be free. I don't wanna walk around intimidated, scared, fearful. What might happen, what they gonna ha, what's what they gonna say, what they going to do.


If it's your story and it's the truth, tell it. Because what you can do is be in a position to prevent it happening to someone else over and over and over again. So if I go back to the 11th grade with that sister who's no longer with us race, rest her with that sister, I would do that again. Because if you tell me something and we know it's wrong, but you're gonna pin that on somebody else. Is that right? No, it's not. Right. And what would your Aunt Mary do? Babe Bo? I swear Bo, You're not answering my question. What would your Aunt Mary do?


Well she gonna tell it. 'cause you gonna tell anything anyway. So yeah, they probably know not to tell her. But that's Why you love Aunt Mary because Aunt Mary kept it in check. Yeah. Even though you didn't wanna tell her. Right. She was gonna tell that baby, you know that's not your daddy. Right? We not gonna play like that. You love Aunt Murray. I do. The uniqueness of your name, MO hyphen. Most of the time Monique is a singular. It's not M Oen. What was that like? Because people say, oh, you're trying to be different. You're trying to be bougie, you know? Good. Well you spell your name Monique, like everybody else spell Monique. Yes, I do. That's my stage name. When I'm out on stage. My name is M-O-N-I-Q-U-E.


When I'm on stage, it's M mo, the little hyphen and IQUE. That's just entertainment. Did you not, did you ever think about changing it to the hyphen? No. On stage is one person off stage is somebody different. And sometimes we get the two mixed up right on stage am an entertainer right off stage. I'm a wife, I'm a mommy, I'm a friend, I'm a sister, I'm these different people. But I keep that stage on the stage. How much of stage is actually Monique? That's good. She say that's good. All of the stage is Monique. But there are certain things Monique's gonna say on stage that she wouldn't say off the stage.


Okay. There are certain things on that stage, you know, there have been people that said, oh, she cussed so much. Oh, I'm a performer, right? I'm an entertainer and I'm on stage. But no one will ever find an interview of me doing what I do on stage in an interview like I'm having with you. It's two different things. Right? What type of student was Monique? I read that you were in, I don't know if this is the correct way, but you were in a, the class that the Slower one. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, Yes. Yeah. You, you had a couple. Say It baby. Now I want You to say it. You want me to Spell It out? How about this here? Hey, you got two lamps, you got two recesses.


Okay. Okay. You stayed in the same class. Okay. But I did not wear a helmet. Okay. Okay. Now since you wanna go there, I did not have to wear that helmet baby. Yes. So mon, As, as I sit here with you today, you didn't all of a sudden become this advanced. Why were you in that class? I'm not gonna play with you, Shannon. Okay. Some of them damn words. Kat was used and I was like, what? I said, oh, he's socking it to him. You know, I never connected with school. Oh, okay. Because I always felt like it wasn't adding up. So when you're trying to teach me about the Boston Tea Party, but people that look like me is at the bottom of the boat.


I can't connect it with you saying I never connected to, because I always felt like something was off. What? When they were teaching me about history, we were always the the savages and we were always the bad people. And then you saw these white people be all the heroes. And as a little girl, I said, something's not adding up. So I don't look at that as a bad thing. I just didn't connect with it. It made no sense to me. So you never had a problem with the learning. But there, the disconnect was what, what they was teaching and what you actually saw. You are like, what you teaching me is not what I actually see. You know what, Shannon? It's a combination. Okay. It was a combination. Okay. I wasn't grasping it and I didn't believe it.


So it's a combination. And when you have a child that is full of energy right? And is sitting in a classroom Yeah. That is closed in all day long and you're trying to tell me all that I'm not, it just did not add up to me. It just did not make sense to me. So there's no shame to it when people say, was you in the so class? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, we color it. So when you, Hey Baby, we color, but don't overlook what you don't think is the pack it's supposed to be. Right. See, again, we come back to the messenger. Nobody thought that I would be, and, and, and I'll go to my family. Like nobody thought.


Not the fat one. She's not gonna be the one, not her. So I've been, I've been used to people doubting and counting me out. And for me as that little girl, it's like one day, one day, one day. And that one day is right here. Even your family. So how, how was your family? How was your, your your brothers and sisters? Because I mean, look, we joined, I mean, I got bro, I got a brother and sister and you know, we joke with each other and, and I could imagine if, if the situation were, if one of us was in those class, oh we going, we gonna get them jokes off Mo. I'm just, it is what it is. No one paid enough attention. Really. Like no one paid enough attention because though we lived in a household together, we were very individual.


So no one even paid attention to what was really going on to include my parents. And that's not a victim story. That's not, oh, what was me? It's just what it was. So it wasn't like, oh, you dummy, the jokes were always fat. They were always fat jokes. Well, okay. So I'm so used to that. But It was, are you the only one in your family this time? Baby. The only one that sneaks snacks. I'm the only one that'll sneak them Damn snacks Shannon. And I'm the only one. Yes. So how would, so what, so what would you say your relationship then and now was with your family? Well, my relationship now with my family, they're my biological family and I wish them well.


Ah, What, here's the thing. I watched you do an, I think it was like a little clip and they were talking about interracial dating. Yes. And you said, why would somebody stay where they're miserable? Right. That applies everywhere, Shannon. Oh, okay. It just doesn't apply to that. Especially in our community, we've been taught take care of your family. Make sure, well there are some families that deserve it and there are some families that you have to say, listen, I'm so glad we had this time together and that's it. Yeah. That's where I am with mine. I wish all of them the best, but that's what it is. Yeah. So even as I sit here with you now, with all that's going on in Hollywood and all of the, the, the stuff I had to go through, I've already been through it with people that you call your family.


And I have to say, you know what, that has to just wash off when I know what I'm standing in and what I'm standing on. You are absolutely right. Monique, my grandmother used to always tell us, she say son, teeth and tongue may fall out, but family never should. And she stood on that no matter what transpired in the family, no matter what, how bad someone had treated you, you should never fall out. But hearing you say that, that's different because just because we're blood, that doesn't mean we're fa we're family through blood. But sometimes it's somebody on the outside that's not blood. That's actually closer family. Yes. Than the actual biological. We've been taught to say trauma is okay. We've been taught to say, you mistreated me, you abused me, you violated me, you disrespected me, you belittled me.


But I'm supposed to look at you at Thanksgiving and say, how you doing unc? That's what we've been taught. You swallow that pain. That's why people have such a problem with Kat Williams. People have a problem with people that says, I'm going to tell the truth. I'm going to tell the truth. And that causes a ruckus. And you would say, why are people upset with the truth? Mm. When you hear Steve Harvey say, there are repercussions when you tell the truth. Well, remember when we were children, what would your grandmother tell you? Tell the truth. Tell the truth. Because if not, there will be what? Repercussions.


Right. Well now it's got turned around. When you tell the truth, there'll be repercussions. So what's the opposite of that? Should I tell a lie and get a reward? So that's how we are rolling right now. That's how we are dealing with one another right now. So when it comes to family and people saying, oh Monique, how could you listen? I wanna live the rest of this journey that I have in peace. I wanna be with my family, in love with my man, he in love with me. We watch our babies grow and develop their own families. I don't need anything in the midst of that because you family that I should accept that trauma. I should accept you not taking accountability for what you've done, what you've said.


And we just washed a slate. That's why we are in the position we are now as a community, as a black community, as a community in entertainment. Everybody's been so afraid to say, look what they did to me. Look what they said. And it's like, oh well listen. Now we don't wanna ruffle no feathers. Feathers. Especially if the messenger doesn't fit the, what people should think the messenger is supposed to look like. Right? And we keep repeating history. Shannon, Is it a situation, Monique, where people look and say, well you made it thus far. Well it couldn't have been that bad because if it had been as bad as you said is, Monique, how would you have ever gotten out of B?


More? How would, would you have ever gotten into Hollywood? How would you ever have a talk show? How would you ever be on a sitcom? So how is it that bad Monique? And you end up like this. You know when you first got in the NFL? Yes ma'am. Your eyes were like this. Yes. And it was, oh, I made it. I'm here. Right? And then after you start getting in it and you started seeing things and you started feeling things and you start, now your eyes start getting a little closer because now you are understanding what the business is. Right? So when you first walk through the door, you are walking through the door saying, come on baby. Oh, this is all I've ever prayed for. And when my baby Cat Williams sat here and said, no one's ever gone out to LA and got a sitcom like that.


I was in LA for three months. And here comes a show called The Parkers. And there we go From there. It it, it took off from there. So I think that when people say if it was so bad, you mature, you begin to understand what you're dealing with, right? You begin to understand what you're in the midst of. And once you understand it is when you can speak on it. Right? But before you really know what you're looking at, how do you speak on that? Right? Because when you first walk in the door of Hollywood, you have everybody telling you, oh my goodness, you're gonna be amazing.


Oh my goodness, this is gonna be incredible. Well that's all you know. That is all you know. Yes. But you're so happy to be here. Yes. And you like, okay, When you, when I listen to your story, you say dirt poor. Yes. Bathroom outside. Yes it was. We had to make it work however we can make it work. Correct. And then you get that first big check. Yes. And you think the people that gave it to you was awesome because they gave it to you. And it's more money than you've ever seen before. Until you find out this ain't the right money, this ain't the right amount. Wait a minute. If they got this, why am I getting this?


Then you start putting the pieces together and you start saying it's not right. And I'm going to speak about it. See, when I saw Taraji broken on those platforms, it was painful to watch. However, Taraji and I had a conversation over a decade ago. Yes. And my trailer when I was doing the Monique show. And she said, you know, you gotta keep on getting it until your turn come. And I said to Raji, most of us die before our turn comes. We gotta ask for it right now. Now I understand that because there was a time I felt the same way.


Exactly. Because that's what I was told. Right. You just keep going and we'll get 'em the next time. We'll get 'em the next time. We'll get 'em the next time and the next time never comes. And then you see our sister broken sitting on those platforms. Now when I said it, when I said it, Why didn't it get detraction when you said it? That when she said it. Now all of a sudden everybody's coming and I and I don't have a problem. I'm glad. Yes. But if you said this a decade ago and I remember you saying it over a decade ago, why didn't they get the traction? Why didn't they get the support? Why wasn't it propped up when Monique said it? I think there's a few reasons why.


Number one, it was the messenger. I should just be grateful I got invited to the party. You were big fat black woman. How dare you be the one. And then on top of that you are saying names. You are saying Oprah's name out loud. You're saying Tyler's name out loud. You're saying Lee's name out loud. You're saying Lionsgate out loud. That's not what we do. We say they. We say the people, we say the studio, we say the producers. How dare you actually say our heroes names. You're very specific. These are our heroes. How could you say their names out loud? Because they're the ones that did it. And if I don't say it out loud.


Now you say a woman that is swallowing that pain that is so stressed out. Then you see our sister Taraji b Henson sit on that platform. And I love that baby 'cause she's a beautiful spirit. But to see her that broken, what our community was saying was, we have a hard time. Some of us, we have a hard time seeing a strong black woman with her back straight and a chin up and a strong black man standing by her side. We have a hard time accepting that

But we can accept seeing a black woman broken Now it's really serious 'cause she's falling apart. Our community had a hard time with those two things. And when I would hear people say, why is her husband there? Why is he there is a sad day when we're questioning why a black man would stand with his black woman. So when you hear black women saying, we are the most undervalued, disrespected, underserved, mistreated, violated, exploited, we get all of that. Then you see a black man standing with his black woman saying, not on my watch.


And you hear some black men saying Why? Why her husband gotta be there. We are in a sad state of affairs when we begin to question black love and black unity. So they didn't wanna hear me. Some of them because of what I look like, because I spoke about their heroes and because they saw that man standing right there strong. Did they question the validity? The, because we had never seen this before. Not so, not so public, not so present. Yes. Did they question you and his relationship?


Me and my husband, Yes. When you say question, what do You mean? What it's like? Because they did, but I wanna understand what you, Because Okay. Did they think that was your husband or what was he your manager be? Because he's been everything. Yes. He's your lover. He's your manager name. He the confidant name him. He's he's your, he's the father. Come On name him. Whatever it it. He's all encompassing. Yes. He's a toolbox with all the tools that Monique needs. All of them. And so when I, I heard people saying that, why is he there? Why does he have to be in every interview? Why does he have to be in the background? Why can't Monique do that? Why not? Why not?


Why not? And that's when you see, and these are my sisters. But when you see Taraji, when you see Viola, when you see our sisters speaking out, you never see their representation sitting right there with them. You never see them saying, listen, we gotta fight together. Right. My husband is also my manager, which is my representation. Right. But again, we've been so beat down that some of us have a problem with this black man saying, I'm standing right here strong. Right. And I will not flinch and I will not budge. What a sad state of affairs we are now in where you have people that look like you and I that would question why this man is standing there.


That for the life of me Is disheartening. When we heard Brother Malcolm say we've been run amuck, we've been hoodwinked, we are now doing it to ourselves. We are now doing it to ourselves. So when you say, Monique, it was different because we had never seen that before. You said their names. Let me say this. I'm not the first one, right? I'm not the first one. But we get washed away in history so easily that we start thinking, oh this the first one, this is the first one. Her name is Claudette Covin. And she's not the first one, but she was before Rosa Parks.


But because Claudette Covin did not fit the picture that they thought she should look like she was skinned and she had coarse hair. And because the, the organization, I believe it was the NAACP did not think she would be accepted by the white people. They had to get somebody that they said the white people could accept. We keep repeating the same thing because what I said is no different than what anyone else is saying. No, not At all. Right? It was the messenger and it was the way that I'm not putting my head down. I'm not shedding one tear. I'm not going to say I don't wanna say they name 'cause I might get in trouble.


I'm gonna say all of it, right? Because when you really think about that little girl coming behind you, what I don't ever want that baby to see is me broken. I don't want her to see me falling apart. And I understand it. I understand how it can happen, Shannon, when you may not have a foundation at home, right? When you may not have that man at home or that woman at home, whomever that support person saying, you're not crazy, right? I got you. Come on, we're gonna go do this. We're gonna get through this. So for us, if we start taking things for what they are and get out of our emotions, we will be so far along. Do you believe punishment?


Punishment is not only meant for the perpetrator, but it's also to deter others from said acts. You said, Do you believe the punishment that was bestowed upon Monique was not only to punish you, you saw it, but to deter others from saying what you said? Well, Shannon, see, he and, and, and I'm gonna answer that, but sometimes we act like we don't know our history. See, back in the day when they had us in chains, they would beat one real good. Right? But in front of the others, In front of the others. And they let everybody know what you don't want is that type of ass whooping, right? So what they said was, we are gonna beat Monique really good. We are gonna sit her down.


And, and, and I made it public financially. My family took a hit, Shannon. And when I tell you we took a hit, right? We took a hit. So when you see our sister go through that, you see her go through and we act like our eyes didn't see what it saw when we watched that promotion happen with the color purple, right? We wanted to act like we didn't see how Oprah Winfrey treated Taraji. In my humble opinion, when you saw her walk up, you saw that there was tension. You saw that there was something happening, right? And then when you see Taraji write her a love letter, it's like, listen, we gotta stand tall and stand strong on what we know you, we know you were mistreated, we know it wasn't right.


We know it was unfair. And then you turn around and say, oh, but Lady O handled it. I have a problem with that. I have a problem with that because that allows Lady O to keep on doing what she's doing. And we in a position of, I don't wanna say nothing 'cause we saw how Monique got whooped. Now again, that's just my humble opinion, right? But I don't know what else to, I don't know how else to frame that. It's like, listen, you better fix that. 'cause you saw what they did to her. You saw how they treated her. Is it a situation? Do you believe it's a situation that Oprah might have faced something similar that maybe wasn't as public as you? And, and, and she's looking at it. Well, if I face that went through it and came out on the other side and look at me, it should be okay.


Because sometimes we get that with parents. You know, I struggle. You say my kids should have to struggle sometimes. Also. Do you think that might be something going on with her or you just like she there's a disconnect. There's A disconnect. Okay, there's a disconnect and there's been a, a disconnect for years. There's a disconnect. And I think what happens is we place people on these pedestals and we say, oh no, you can't do no wrong. We don't even wanna hear it. Right? And when you hear cats say, you know what they do? They don't say anything and they act like it didn't happen. I'm gonna keep talking until you take accountability, right? Until you say, uncle, I've done this.


That's why it was so important. From Oprah Winfrey to Tyler Perry, Lee Daniels. Now Lee Daniels was the only one I had to deal with. Did you see Lee Daniels apologize? He walked out on that stage, he weren on stage. Not only did he apologize on stage, that man apologized to our children. That man apologized to our children and said, I need to apologize for what I put y'all through. He's the only one I had to deal with. However, it became a problem with Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry that I wouldn't do something and work for free. Now when you say, well maybe Oprah feels like she came through it, why can't you?


Right? Well there's a story with Oprah Winfrey when she was on the show. People are talking, Richard Cher was making $55,000. She was making $22,000. These are her words, it was her co-host. She said I had to leave because they wasn't paying me fairly. Now you say black woman who did nothing wrong and you are in the midst of this situation because she called me. Tyler Perry called me Lionsgate called when you were on the phone with my husband. You said, I agree with Monique, I agree with the position she's taking. But, but when it came time to say it out loud, Oprah Winfrey went totally silent.


Now to Tyler Perry's credit, Tyler Perry called us up, right? And he said, I can see the pain in you and I can hear it. And I wanna let you know that I I I would never do nothing to hurt you. But the conversation kept going on only for Tyler Perry to admit he did start a rumor that I was difficult to work with. He lied only for Tyler Perry to admit I was wrong. And when my movie Boo come out, I'm gonna say that right Now, here's where, when you did that interview with Kat, I could respect how you do it because Kat said you let them people lie in your face and your response was, Kat, I don't know if they're lying or not, right?


Because I can only take 'em at their word. At their word, right? Yes. Well, we sent you the audio of Tyler Perry. I don't want you to take me at my word. I want you to hear his words. And what did you hear that man saying? What did you hear that man saying? He said it. What did he say? Is that is mon. You know, you're not supposed to be recording people. No, no, no, no. Let me back up. Okay. Everything we did was legal. And here's where black woman really gets the kick in the ass. Had I not recorded Tyler Perry, then it would've been my word Word against his.


Against his. And then on top of that it would've been, he's so powerful we can't even pay no attention to that. Right? Well now I have him on audio, which is legal to do where we live, Right, Georgia. Okay, we have him on audio. And do you know what some people then said, why would you record him? Just like you sat there and said, you know what's illegal to But did you hear what the man said? I did. I violated you. Yeah, I mistreated you. Yeah. Do you know Shannon? That's cost my family tens of millions of dollars. Yeah. Over a lie and a rumor Is he going, is he gonna make a, he's gonna compensate you for that. I want you to look in your camera. Yes.


And I want you to talk to Tyler Perry because you heard what that man said. So ask him, will he compensate my family for that? Tyler, will you come on club she Shea and let's have a conversation about the fair compensation for what transpired between you and Monique. You can sit right here and she's sitting right here and you and I can have a conversation And we'll do you one better and gimme five on that baby. We'll do you one better. Shay my husband and I'll sit right next to him. See, with this whole situation and some of the people that Kat talked about, ironically I have this issues with those same people. There were people that reached out to Tyler Perry on my behalf.


Okay? And I was grateful for that. Okay? There was Al Sharpton, the Reverend Al Sharpton civil rights leader. Yeah. I sent him that audio. He listened to it. He said, baby, what that man did to you was wrong and you're like my daughter and we're gonna have to get him to fix that. Right? We didn't hear from Al Sharpton for six months. The next time we saw Al Sharpton, he was on a podium talking about we don't need to fly commercial 'cause we can fly Tyler Perry's private jet. I said that's why maybe I'm not hearing back from him. Okay. Then we had our beautiful sister Stephanie Mills. Yes. Okay. Who is she?


Don't play. Yes. Right. I told her what happened. Sent her the audio. Now I don't know if she listened to that audio or not, but however she called Tyler Perry. She said, Monique, Tyler Perry does not wanna revisit this. Okay, fine. Right? While we're on the phone, Tyler Perry calls her back and says, I will meet with Monique, but not with her husband. And you ready for this? Yeah. And then Monique has to apologize publicly to say Oprah, I had nothing to do with messing up her career. But that'd be a lie. I look in the goddamn camera. I thought you, I thought that was a stage the way you Look in the camera. Yes.


Because you heard it. Yes. Right? Yes. So when you have, when you hear what this man is saying, so I said, Stephanie, tell Tyler Perry never will I meet with him without my husband. And I owe no apology. So I'm not gonna give one that goes away. Kevin Hart. Now you know when Kat Williams said gatekeepers. Yes. Kevin Hart, I do his podcast. Yes. And I want y'all to re-listen to the podcast so you can hear it for yourself. When he first comes on. He says, you're like my mother. You're like my aunt. You're like my sister. Okay. Then we do the podcast, we speak about the Tyler Perry situation, Oprah Winfrey.


He said, I don't really know Oprah, but I'm gonna reach out to Tyler. I appreciate that Kevin kept his word. He reached out to Tyler Perry. Kevin Hart called me back about maybe a week or so later. He said, Mo, I talked to Tyler. He said, he don't wanna revisit it. He said, but I tell you what, let's move past that Mo let's just move past that and let's just do great things. So whatever you, That's what Kevin Said. I want you to hear me Kevin Hart. Let's move past that mode. Let's do some great things together. Don't even worry about it. Whatever y'all wanna do, I will partner with you, our executive produce with you. You just let me know what you wanna do. Now let me say that before we go any further, because I wanna make sure I give Kevin Hart his proper credit.


When my family was up against the wall, Kevin Hart wrote us a check and said, here you go. We are forever grateful for that. When we were able to give it back, we said, brother, we appreciate you with some interest on top. 'cause I don't ever want nobody to think Phil let gave me and my husband. So I wanna make sure I put that out there that that brother really helped us out when we needed to be helped out. Then when he came back with, I got you. I didn't ask Kevin Hart to do anything. He said, our executive producer, I'll partner with you. I said, good shit, Kevin. 'cause we are in the deal with Ender Mall and we're trying to get our talk show back, Mo, whatever it is. I got you. Now Kevin Hart is one of the biggest entertainers right now in the world. Correct? Right.


And was then we got off the phone with Kevin Hart. We called Inam Mall immediately and said, Kevin Hart said whatever we wanna do, he got us, he's gonna partner, executive use. They was like, oh, this is incredible. Because when you put Kevin Hart name on it, you already know what it is. Correct. Two weeks go by, we get a call from Inal. Inal says, we just got a call from Kevin Hart's manager Dave Becky and Dave. Becky said, Kevin doesn't want anything to do with Monique. So whatever she told y'all, he doesn't wanna do anything with her. Nothing. You know, he doesn't want any, any kind of relationship with Monique. So what changed between the two weeks and when, and, and plus he gave you a check, you gave the money back then said he would partner with you, executive produce whatever you need Mo a we got you.


So what transpired or what do you think transpired between then that two, that two week period? Well, soon as we got off the phone and they told us what Kevin, manager, David, Becky said, I called Kevin Hart immediately. I said, Hey baby, we just got off the phone with End Al. And they said Dave, Becky called them up and said, you don't want anything to do with me. He said, Mo, that's, that's a miscommunication I can tell you right now. I said, wait a minute, are you okay though with this white man calling them up, getting in between our relationship at something you said? He said, Mo, I'm, that's a miscommunication and we gonna talk Tuesday. Don't worry about it. I'm I'm telling you right now, it's a miscommunication. That was two years ago. If you talk to him, I talk to him.


I've never talked back to Kevin Hart again. So that's what we are faced with. When you allow somebody to come in between a relationship with a woman that you said, I'm like your mother. You said, I'm like these things. I didn't ask you for that. So everything that that baby was saying sitting here, everything he was saying was on the up and up. Because when you hear people say, get DGA out your heart, oh man, no one's saying he's lying. No one ever said I was lying. It's so easy to discount and devalue because of what we look like. Right. However, when it comes to Tyler Perry, I will not allow you to discount or devalue because that is your voice on that audio.


Remember on good times when Penny's mother was whooping up on her? Yep. And then, and she had recorded it. That's you on tape. So how does it go from you saying you're gonna give me an apology to now I owe you an apology, but What do you owe an apology for? What, what, what could I possibly owe you an apology for when you've admitted? See when Lee Daniel says to me, because Cookie from the, the show empire, I was offered that role. Now Taraji to it up baby. Right? It Listen here. However I was offered that. Then Felita called me back and say, baby girl, they said, you're too difficult to work with.


But you here on the audio that a man told David Ward I was difficult to work with. Do you see how that cost my family? Yes. And with no accountability because oh, it's the great Tyler Perry. No, you've gotta be accountable for that Oprah Winfrey. You've gotta be accountable for the things you've done with my family. You've gotta be accountable for that. Is there any relationship between you and Tyler and you and Oprah currently? No. No, but I thought there was an apology. I I read what there that I thought I read somewhere that Oprah had issued you an apology and Tyler had issued an apology. That's not correct. No. No.


The only person that's given you an apology you saw it Is Lee Daniels. That's the only person. So we are in a place where we are too afraid to call them for what it is. We're too afraid to say if it looked like a duck and it quack like a duck. What is it Shannon? It's a duck. Right? So again, you see the struggle of the black woman as I'm sitting here talking to you and you say, Mova, why would you record 'em? But you heard the man violate me. The first thing wasn't, I can't believe that Kat did that to you. It's why would you do it? And we understand it, right? Because we've been conditioned that way.


Because when you're, you had to get somehow because when you're telling people these are lies, yes. Nobody is believing Monique. So now even though you have him record his voice and that's him and he's saying he made it up. Now it is no longer, oh man, I can't believe he lied on Mo Mo why'd you record it? So now they put the on back on you. Where's the win? How do we win? How does a black woman win? When you say, here he is right here. And I look to the community and say, how long do we allow us to keep being exploited, used, up, taken advantage of?


And because we think somebody can give us a opportunity, we just say, sh I'm not gonna say nothing. If we keep operating like that, Shannon, you gonna have a whole lot of us sitting right here in this same seat, almost telling the same story. Why do you think Tyler is afraid to meet with you and your husband? Why does it need to be you 1 0 1 when he meet with other representatives and, and, and, and the client, their client? What, what is it about you that he feels it needs to be just you and he? Does he think your husband is some kind of negative influence on you? He thinks the husband is saying things that, that Monique probably wouldn't say if I just had had an opportunity to talk to her one-on-one.


What do you think that is? Let me say this. Excuse People. Better be glad my husband is by my side. Because there are people in Hollywood that know wherever you act up is where I show up. People know in Hollywood, baby Shannon and I don't say it with a badge of honor, it's just what it is. Well, I've had to say who you think you talking to and we're sitting there with the president of the studio or the co My patience level is not gonna allow. I've been molested. I've been violated. So the moment I see you trying to do it, we gonna have to address it. My husband is nothing but a gentleman. And you know why people have a problem with my husband? 'cause he right to it. There's no we gonna dance around the bush.


He's right to it. Right? And people like Tyler Perry, people like Oprah Winfrey, they look at my husband and say, how dare you be so direct? Right? How dare you not put your eyes down when you're talking to me? How dare you do that? My husband is also my manager. Why would he wanna exclude my management? It's like, Tyler, you should want my husband to be there. You you, you may want him to be sitting right there so that way we can have a conversation that everyone can be heard. But I appreciate you Shannon, because most people are too afraid that's heard the tape. They're too afraid to say no, I heard it. And this is what he said.


I appreciate ts Madison because TS Madison was the first one to say No, I heard what he said. So when folks were trying to jump on her, she knocked down for the black woman. Listen baby, y'all don't even understand the fights that sister be having when ain't nobody watching for the black woman, right? So I appreciate you looking in that camera. Right? Well, I mean, look, sometimes there are some, some black people, some not all, some that my grandfather used to say, Mo, is that if you're not careful, you'll become the very thing you despise the most in a person. Now what do we despise most about Trump supporters president, ex-President Trump is that no matter what he says, no matter what he does, they give him an out.


There's some people in our community, no matter what powerful black people say or do in our community, we'll give him an out and we Can't. And we become the very thing we despise the most. Yes. What we despise most about President Trump's ex-President Trump supporters is that no matter what he does or says, it's okay. Yes. We can't do that. We can't. You can't, we can't. If somebody's wrong, like you said, Mo, if somebody's wrong, we have to be man or warm enough to say they're wrong. Regardless of what comes along with that. They don't know. They don't understand what them saying. I'm sorry, will mean for them. See, when I, I read the Other day, 'cause that's not for you. And I'm sorry.


It's not for the person that you offended. It's for you. Because currently you are in hostage your feelings because you have to live with that knowing. You've gotta live with that, what you've done. So when you see a woman say, me turning 70, I'm so happy because I've never heard anyone Stop it. Stop it. 'cause there's a black woman that has been calling your name for over a decade that you seem to wanna make. Go away. And I know I'm not the only one. Would you want, would you sit If Oprah called Mo today, would you sit down and have a conversation with her? Let me tell you what I'll do. If Oprah called me today, Shannon Sharp, we will sit down and have a conversation with Oprah Winfrey. We will sit down and have a conversation with Tyler Perry.


We will sit down and have a conversation with the presidents of Lionsgate. We will sit down and have a conversation with anyone that is brave. I'm gonna say brave enough to sit down and have a conversation. But what happens is, within seconds, within seconds, if Tyler Perry was to sit right here, you would say, man, I heard you. What you trying to tell me about this system? Within seconds, Oprah Winfrey would know that. People would say, hold up. See, when I speak about Oprah Winfrey, and let me be clear, I I love that sister. 'cause she's our sister. She just gotta come back across the street. We got the light on. When I speak about Oprah Winfrey, I speak about that woman because she's spoken about me.


And when you begin to speak about me privately, I'm gonna speak about you publicly. You've been unfair, you've been unjust. And you watched a black woman be thrown under the bus and you've said nothing. And here's what's interesting as well. My husband was saying to me After I won the Oscar award, right? And she had the people come, you know, to talk to the Oscar winners. And I go on the stage and I talk to the Oscar winners. Well, when we go to a commercial, the people in the audience, and I say this humbly, as my husband was telling me, he said, mama, they wasn't screaming Oprah.


They was screaming. Monique. Right? Right. So much so I had to say, y'all gonna shut that shit up. Now we getting ready to go back on the ad, we having fun. Right? Right. He said, but I watched Oprah, he said, and I watched her almost turning her seat like they screaming her name. Now some people will say, oh, Monique, you are you reaching? Well, let me tell you what then happens. The movie, the Butler, that movie was offered to me. Lee Daniels came out and said, I did offer Monique the Butler. But as he said to me, he said, Mo, at the time I didn't have no power and I didn't have no money. So when Oprah says she wanted it, so who played the lead role in the butler?


Oprah Winfrey. Lee Daniels was getting ready to do a biopic on Richard Pryor. And he offered me the grandmother who then calls Lee Daniels and says, I wanna be the grandmother. So as you're looking at me, is the same way I'm looking at that sister and I'm saying, why don't we sit down and have a conversation? 'cause the way things could look, it may not be that way, but just the way things look, Oprah, just the way you would have my family on your show, Oprah. One might say, Mo Well, I mean if the role, if they're looking for a black Big, go ahead, say it Big Shannon.


It's careful what his words, he won't say fat black woman. If the role looking for a fat black woman, Mo was like, But I keep my podcast Mo, y'all ain't fitting to cancel me. This why we love your uncle Shay Shea. Because we want you to say a fat black woman. Now me and Oprah fit the damn description. Shea Fat black. Don't we fit it? Y You do. But I'll be right back in the bed. I'll be your neighbor up there where you live at. Listen here, listen here, listen here. So so are you lying? No. Now I'm not gonna have your big ass sitting here in the Hall of Fame and you scared to say shit. Okay? And I wanna excuse myself, any of the babies that might be watching this. 'cause I wasn't gonna say no spicy things, but Shea get me wrong.


Now, come on. Shaq. One might say, or people might say, well, Mo I mean the roll calls for a a heavyset black woman. You, Oprah, y'all fit the roles. Yes. How do we know that she wasn't offered the role at Long? And, and people think that she's better, more, more qualified than you. It don't work like that. Shannon, you can't offer me once you say I want you. Right. That's what it is. Okay. Okay. But I don't have the money to fund a production. Right. I don't have the connections to go to the studio and say, listen, I wanna do this movie. She does. Right? So when Lee says, Hey baby, she got the money.


Go get it. You get it. But someone would just say, how is that working out like that? How's that happening like that? How is it that things that was offered to Monique, you seem to be playing now. I I told Oprah about that. See everything we're saying to you right now. You had, you was having a conversation with her. Listen here, I don't play the behind the back. I don't play the I'ma share with Sha There's one thing I will share with you that I've not shared with anybody. Okay? But I don't play the behind the back and all of that. I say, listen, let me try to get to you first now if you avoid me, okay? Okay. But I tried to be respectful. I tried to call you first when she had my family on her show. I tried to call you first.


I tried to talk to you privately, but then you became the great, the great mighty Oprah Winfrey and you were too busy to talk. Well, now I'm gonna talk about it. This woman has overstepped with me. So in so many ways that somebody would say, if we wasn't Monique and Oprah Winfrey in the entertainment business, and we was Monique and Oprah Winfrey that worked at Costco. I see you in the break room. I see you at your cash register because she's overstepped. Wow. So I don't know, Monique, and this might be the, the term crossing of the Rubicon.


We might be going too far. I can't, I don't How do you, if you feel that way? Because clearly if you feel this way, yes. Now I, I get why you feel this way? I don't know. Like I said, I don't know the, I don't, I I'm taking you at your word now. Not, not, not, not the Tyler, because I I've listened to the audio. Yes. I'm not talking about that. I'm just talking about Oprah. Yes. I'm just taking you at your word. Yes. If you feel this way, is it possible she feels the exact same way about you? How could she, how could she, what have I taken from Oprah? When did I have Oprah's mother and father on my show? When did I have anybody come and speak about Oprah Winfrey on the Monique show?


That's never happened. So how could she feel that way? Would you have done that? Had her family on? Yeah. Let me tell you how we operate. When we had the Monique show, there was a comedian on there and he was trying to joke Tia's wife, tiny. My husband walked out in the middle of his set. He said, cut. He said, brother, we don't do that here. We uplift our folks. We don't play that. So no, I would not have done that When Oprah Winfrey had my family, and, and, and I'll I'll tell y'all. And I'm looking over. I'm looking around baby because there are people here. Yes. Okay. And I don't wanna be rude to the people at she Shea's club. You got other people in the club.


Right? When Oprah Winfrey called me up and she said, I got a call from your brother and this is after I'm won the Oscar ward. Right. And your brother wants to come on the show and he wants to apologize to you for molesting you. And he wants to tell other people how to wa look out for predator. Right. I said, Oprah, I said, I don't want anything to do with that cat. I said, but, and then she said, well, if you want me to scratch the show, I will scratch it. I said, SIS, don't scratch it because he could be a different person and I don't want to get in the way if that cat is a different person. I just don't want no parts of it.


Right. Okay. When I hung up that phone, Shannon, I was like, I appreciate that sister. Like, she didn't have to call me. She didn't, she didn't have to call me and say, I'm gonna have your brother. Right. I start seeing commercials with my mother and my father and my other brother who used to be my manager who knew the fear that I had with the brother that was up on stage. Right? Correct. We never talked about my mother being there. She never told you that. You know how you feel about your grandparents. Yes. Absolutely. You know the honor and how you speak about them. Imagine you then seeing your granddaddy and your grand on a show and they're talking about somebody that violated you and that woman didn't tell you that they were gonna be there.


How would you feel? I would feel like you feel like you felt betrayed. That is exactly how I felt and how I feel. And it's not, oh, I'm in a No, I understand it. But you betrayed me sister. And I'm not the only one because At the time when she called you, she said it was just your Brother. Just my brother. And when my mother was on that show, do you know what I had to deal with Shannon? What's that? I would be in the store and I would have elderly women coming up to me and they would say, your mama ain't shit. Wow. Now they wasn't lying, Shannon. Okay.


They wasn't lying, baby. Sometime you gotta let the truth be the goddamn truth. Sometime you gotta just go with it. But still it's my mother's, your mom. And I'm in here and I, I'm, because when she wa I'm having to defend something. And I got that often with them telling me what my mother wasn't because you did not tell me. Had Oprah Winfrey said, I'm gonna have your mama. I have said, shut that shit down, scratch down. I don't need nobody seeing my mama be greedy. I don't need the world. See, shut it down. Now there's a white woman named Barbara Walters. They called her first and she said, Monique, I told your family I can't do that to you.


I wouldn't do that to you. You just won that award. Like, yeah, why would I do that? Yeah. This, I mean, you are here. Why would I bring something that I know that you don't want to talk about? You've lived it. Why do I need to replay it again? Ask her. You camera right there. But I, I was, I was trying To get I know baby, but ask her, see, this is where it get juicy, right? Yeah. Because you, you, you're, you're saying the right things, but you're asking me questions that I can't answer. Right. I can't answer why Oprah Winfrey did what Oprah Winfrey did. Yeah. Only Oprah Winfrey can answer for her actions. Yes. So again, stop being scared. No, I, I knew that again, I knew that back in baby.


I knew that would get Uncle Shea. But even, even this show, I have a producer and I give him a lot of leeway. But I've had people reach out and say, well, a family member says something and I'm gonna come on your show and refute it. That ain't what we do here. Right. It's like it ain't gonna happen. It's almost, you don't cross that barrier. We don't do, we don't do the family thing. Now You don't do the family thing. And I'm, I'm gonna bring this up. I wasn't going to do it, but damnit, this is this seat tell You wanna have another this Seat make you go truth. Tell it. No. Tell the damn truth. Goddamnit tell the truth because family is sacred.


It's supposed to be. And we don't cross the line with family. And people begin to get comfortable to jump on the Monique bandwagon of Monique doing things wrong. And she doing this and she doing that. And there's a brother named DL Hughley. Yep. And until he take accountability, I won't let it go. What? Because what would you get ready to say? I Was gonna say, what did DL do? Lemme Tell you baby. That voice went up, didn't it? DL Is friend, he like, that's my friend. No, I, I I've met DL on several occasions. I don't know DL like that.


Okay. Do I, do I know DL say like I know an earthquake. No. Do I know since I've interviewed Kat had several conversations with him. Do I know DL on that level? No. Right. See, when we say family is sacred, right? Family is sacred and we know that you don't cross the line when it comes to family. Correct? Right. I do DLS radio show. Yes. DL Hughley is not there. His team is there. And Shannon, we having a great time. I mean baby, we having a great time. We going forward, back and forth. When we get to the end of the show, they say, Monique, you wanna play a game? Well I wanna play. I said, sure Sugar, let's play a game.


And it's a game called Would you Rather? Oh, okay. Now Mo, you already, you should have said, I'm too old for This game. Wait a minute. We're having fun baby. Right? We having a good time, Shannon. Okay. Okay. We, I mean it's the sister dad. It's two other guys. We're having a great time. It's a beautiful black unity cookout. Okay? We're having a good time. Okay. Would you say your wife was your family? Is that considered family? Yeah. So your husband is considered family, right? Absolutely. Okay, so here we go. They said, Monique, we wanna play a game of would you rather let's go. Would you rather your husband sleep with Lee Daniels with a condom or Corinne Steffans Without one.


Really? Monique, Now as y'all are watching right now, haven't heard this During y'all going, they doing the same thing in the studio. They going, okay, that is exactly what happened. Now I said to the team, how does that uplift our community? I said, sister and her name is Jasmine. How could you ask another sister that? Well, we just planned. I said, tell me the joke in that because I don't know what you're insinuating then you are involving people that have nothing to do with nothing. Like what are y'all doing? So I said, I'm gonna call my brother dl. I'm going to call my brother.


I call DL Hubley on the phone. I say, Hey baby. Yeah. Huh? That's how he responds. Yeah. Did He know it was you? Yes. He, because they called him to tell him, no Monique's gonna be calling Right. Like this. It was getting crazy. Right? I'm like, just lemme get on the phone with my brother. Right? Yeah. Hey dl. Yeah. I said, listen, I just got off the phone with your team and they wanted to play this game. Would you rather? And it was like stupid, like asking me about my husband and Lee Daniels and Kain Stefans and his exact words. Well that's how we do it. I said, dl, how does that uplift our community?


And again, I don't know what y'all trying to insinuate, but brother, what you doing? Like I said, that's just how we do it. So it is what it is now. It got so ugly that my attorney had to send a cease and desist so it never aired. So we have like when Kat Williams talk and people truth tellers talk. We have receipts to everything we're saying. That's how that whole thing got started. Okay? It's family. My husband is my family. Yeah. Now you babies that are really good with this internet. Through the years I've watched DL speak ill of me through the years. I never knew me. I never knew DL Hughley had a problem with me.


But when Cassie all a group, he forgot to put DL Hugeley in the group. Through the years I was bitter. I was dangerous with what I was doing. Saying that it was inequality. My husband didn't know what he was doing. This went on through the years I was unloved all of these things. And I said to myself, I'ma see you. I'ma see you. I didn't go on nobody's show. I didn't say nothing to nobody. But I knew the time would come that I would see him. We were scheduled to do a show in Los Angeles. I was the headliner of that show. His name was on it. Then his name came off. I didn't question it, but I knew I'm gonna see him.


Right? Eventually. Okay, now we have a show in Detroit. Contractually I was the headliner. DL Hughley posted a memo. Now, when you signed your deal for the Ravens, did you sign a contract or memorandum? I signed a contract. You see how you say that? Like anybody that knows good business, you sign country. The memo was saying, this is what I would like. Right? But the contract is saying this is what it is. What? It's okay. Yes. He put out a memo to our community. And that touched me a little different because I was saying, why would you lie to our babies? Because now they're thinking if they send somebody a memo, that's what they're supposed to get.


Okay? I was contractually signed to go as the headliner, right? I mean, you go Last D Hugeley didn't come into the building until nine 30. Now contractually, I said I have to be on stage by nine 30 because if the show starts at eight, I refuse to keep an audience waiting. Right? That is disrespectful to the audience. Correct? When I went out on that stage, Shannon, I made sure everything I said, he heard me. 'cause now you're here and I'm gonna say it to you. And I said some things on that stage that I said he was cowardly. And some folks said, how could you say that? How could you do that? And then I posted some things to say, this is what I meant.


See you came after my husband. And when you had a chance to fix it, when you had a chance to say, Mo, my bad. You know, we don't even get down like that. Right? You told me it is what it is. And until he's brave enough and courageous enough to say, this is what really happened, y'all, y'all have never known me to be no shit starter. Folks ain't never known me to go over and kick a sandwich out of somebody's hand. That's hungry. But what people do know is if you kick me, damn, if I ain't gonna kick you back, right? Because that's fair play. Right? So there was one left out the pack. And when you have people that continually don't take accountability, that's why you see us in the state of affairs we're in.


Yeah.

I'm a firm believer mo, That everybody don't play the same. And someone once told me, what is joke to you is death to someone else. What is joke? That's why we don't play with people's families. No. When we had the Monique show the radio show, listen, you can't come on here and speak ill of no one because we don't play like that because we know how this business works. Right? So when you allow that to happen, what do you think is gonna come back your way? What do you think? And DL Higley, please no, brother, we still love you. Just take accountability for it and we move forward. I remember reading something about the, about the situation in Detroit. I didn't know the, the depth of the magnitude of it.


I, I remember reading something about a memo about, I guess it's an addendum that was added on. But the contract is the contract. The contract is the contract. And what happens is because of the messenger, it was easy to pile on. It was easy to pile on. And then when you have our, some of our black folk that go sit in front of a white man and speak ill of their people, I'm like, y'all, what are we doing? What are we doing right? What are we doing? What, what are we coming to that we gonna sit in front of this white man, I can't even say his name. I refuse. Everybody know who he is. We sit in front of him and we just let this man say any and everything about us.


And then we go right in with him. That now see that to me is dangerous. And y'all babies as good with this little computer. Don't take my word. You can just go through the years of this cat just running his mouth and it's like, stop doing that. Because what are we saying to the babies coming behind us? We are gonna continue this, but I wanna get into where you're from. The DMV. Yeah. Do you realize like Chappelle Martin, Tommy Davison, earthquake yourself, what's in the soil in the DMV that got you guys? I mean, you've done television stand up. All these guys have done television and stand up and are great at it.


When you look at like, Chappelle Chappelle walked away, like walked away from and said, nah, I'm gonna do my own thing 'cause I'm not gonna let you guys hold me. Oscar. Yes, but Martin still does television. Tommy Davidson doesn't do as much television. Quake is not in television, but he has, you know, has his, all his gigs going on. When you look at the success that a Chappelle Martin earthquake is habit and you says, hold on. And none of them guys were no Oscar and none of them guys did what I did in, in on the movie set. And they're having the commercial sense that there's a have a i that should be Mo If I was a white woman, do you know what my name would be? Wealthy Melissa McCarthy.


Oh My goodness. If I was a white woman, my name would be Melissa McCarthy. Same track record, Five years sitcom and syndication. Same track record. The opportunities are not the same. So when you have, and as you read all of those things off, when you say, wait a minute, Mo, none of them have this, none of them have that. We get judged by a different stick. We get judged by a different stick. And then when I had people judging me, I'm like, you judging me by your yardstick? You've not done what I've done. And I say that humbly, you've not had the accomplishments that I had. Right? When I hear brother DL Hubley say, well that Netflix special, I just accepted anything, whatever they gave me, these are not my words, they're his. Right. Well that's how you do business.


I'm not mad at you accepting anything. Right. Why are you mad at me saying I won't accept anything? Right. That's the difference. It's like people were judging me. I was hearing people Shannon. Okay. I didn't know we had so many tender people in our group. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know we had so many tender love. I didn't know we had so many tender people and I, I wouldn't wanna be on the front line with these tender people where it's like, oh, I can't believe you said that. I can't. But it's what I said the truth. It's what I said the truth. No, I didn't put no sugar on it. Right. It was shit. Right. And I didn't try to make it taste good. We gotta stop running away from what is real.


And we run into fantasy and that's how come we keep staying where we sit. Mo before you became Monique that everybody has seen over the last two, three decades, what were some of the jobs that you had that you was like, man, this ain't for me. I, I knew this is just a holdover. This is just a bridge. Every job I had, baby, it was special. Was it every job I had? Baby you were the best at it. Let me tell you something. I worked in the drive-through in Popeye's. I worked in the drive-through in Popeye's and that was my microphone. Every time somebody came to that window, I was on stage. Welcome to Popeye's. My name is Monique. What would you like today? And they would say, Hey Monique, I'm Shannon. Hey Shannon. How you doing baby? What's your order?


And you gimme me your order. And then I say, would you like a hot apple pie with that Shannon? You say, you know what Monique, I sure would come on around here baby. Let see You. The over sold Listen here Popeyes. Where my damn money? Because I was a seller baby. I you one of the two piece I gave you four. Hmm. You wasn't gonna lose no weight coming through my damn window, Shannon. That's why I ain't lost no damn weight. What I sold, I ate. If you got two pieces, I ate two of them. Welcome to Popeye's. Hi baby. Come on now. So that was, that was your microphone. That was, that was the beginning of Monique because you was owning. Did you know that's what you were doing?


What I knew I was doing was walking in my dream. The microphone said it's possible when I stood in my bathroom mirror and I wrapped the towel around me and it didn't go all the way. I wasn't devastated. Okay. I dunno if they just didn't have enough money to buy me a whole damn towel. But, but I would still stay in there and that was my gown. Right. And I would pick up that brush and I would say I would like to thank, so I've always seen it. You did. You always know that you were, you all, was Oscar always in the back of your mind? Did you always, Oscar Was never in my mind. You just wanted to be in tv. You wanted to be in show business. What, what aspect did you wanna do?


I wanted to be famous. I loved what it looked like with people being famous. I didn't know to say I wanna be wealthy with the Fame. Right. I didn't know to be specific to ask for it, but I wanted to be famous. Who did you know that looked like Monique? That was famous Oprah Winfrey. So do you see how far this relationship goes? That's who I knew. That looked like me. See, I didn't, when people always ask me about the Oscar. Right. But no one ever asked me about the image award. No one ever said to me, what did it feel like when they called your name for the NAACP image award?


And they were people that looked like me. Right. Because we put so much weight on that award that we, it's such an honor and it's an honor for any award. Right. Not just that one, but as a little girl, I never watched the Oscars because nobody looked like me. Running was winning. So I was like, this is not for me all. But when I watched the image award, baby, those people look like me. Right. The BET awards, those people look like me. So I was honored the first time they called my name for image award. When I tell you Shannon, that night baby, when they called this little fat girl name from Baltimore. And the winner goes to the award, goes to Monique. Well listen here, I got so good with 'em calling my name.


And this is what had to humble me. You will get humbled baby when you just think they get ready to call your name. I had won it like three years in a row. This the fourth year. Oh, ain ain. Yeah. Aint got my name again. Lemme situate myself and my chair. Do I look good? So here come the category. Okay. Hey baby. The best actress in the sitcom, they named me Tisha Campbell and I cannot remember the other sisters. Right. I know they getting ready to say and the award goes to Monique. So I got to, 'cause I'm a big girl, you gotta scoot up. Yeah, yeah. So you can be ready to push up. Right. Right. So I scoot up, get my gown together and the winner is Tisha Campbell.


I said, all right girl, go on And get that. That humbled my ass and sat right back down. But I I, it, it was never the Oscar for me baby. Right. It was never the Oscar for me. So how did standup happen? Standup happened on a dare. My brother came home one day and said he went down to the comedy club. Okay. To do open mic night. And he did so bad. He said they was boo me, but I was six beers in. So I thought the booze was was applause. So my boy had to say, man, no bro, this is stinking. Right. Right. So we cleaning out the pool and he says, I said, if I was there, I would've said, and that was 30 minutes of what I would've said.


Then he said, I dare you to go down next Wednesday and do open mic night. It was a club called Burkes in Baltimore. I went down that next Wednesday, Shannon and I got a standing ovation. And from that moment to this moment, were You hooked? I was. I was. It is nothing like, and I'm sure you can appreciate it, understand when you walk out on that football field and you walk and you smell it and you walking into it and you, that little boy in you says, I'm here, I'm still there. That little girl in me is still saying, I'm here, but I'm a grown woman. Right. And I'm saying now that I'm here, you got to pay for it fairly.


If not, I'm good. I just have to walk away. How much, how different is that, Monique? Not just in age. Yes, but how different is that Monique? To the witness sitting right here on this couch. Oh, she grew up, That one was naive. Were you ever naive? Yes. Yes. Yes. When you first come to Hollywood, Shannon and I got a show called the Parkers after I was in Hollywood. Less than 90 days. Wow. 90 days. And you have agents and you have managers and you have attorneys.


Right. And they're telling you all the good things. And anybody, everybody always said to me, you wanna get the syndication. Yes. You wanna get the syndication. Once you get the syndication, you work 'cause you wanna work. Right, right. So syndication is what, five years, a hundred episodes. Syn syndication is a hundred episodes. Okay. Right. So that's all I knew. I didn't know to ask to be an executive producer of my own image. Oh. And nobody told me. I didn't know to ask for that. I didn't know to ask for after the third year of being on a successful sitcom that you could say I now need a bonus. I didn't know to even negotiate that.


And no one told me to negotiate that. They're Definitely not gonna tell you. All They kept saying is when you get the syndication. When you get the syndication. When you get the syndication. Well three years in the Parkers was in syndication. Now no one told me that. You learn it once you open your eyes. Because now I'm going around the country doing promos. The Parkers is coming on at four o'clock and your city, the parks will be on at two 30 in Sacramento. Y'all make sure y'all watch the park as it's coming on. I'm not knowing I'm promoting the show in syndication. No one told me that. All we are doing is saying if we get to five years, we got to five years, 110 episodes.


Me and a beautiful young lady named Count Spawn, who was my baby to this day, we had the Laverne Shirley Law. Yeah. Right. Supposed to be equal. Yeah. Once we got to the five years, our attorney. My attorney. Yeah. And the ages that, oh, the Parkers made money, y'all gonna get paid from the Parkers. It's made money. Okay. Years go by. By 2004, the Parkers, we went off the air in 2004. Right. In five years by 2009 the Parkers had made $800 million. You like Oh yeah. Yeah. Stay With me. Money. Money. Hey, come on.


Hey. Yeah, Yeah. Okay. Because we waiting, get this money Coming, we get a call, we gotta do an audit, you know, and everything. Okay. And that was in 2009 that it made 800 million. Okay. We're now in 2024 and they're trying to convince counts Bond and I, that that show made no money. No, no. They're trying to convince us that a show that cost 65, roughly $65 million to make in our last year of shooting the Parkers count as Bond.


And I made $55,000 a piece. That's it. How much were you making an episode? $55,000 in episodes. Okay. So how many episodes did you shoot That last year? Of five years? That last year we shot 22 episodes. Okay. We made $55,000 a piece at the end of a top rated. Si Hold on, hold on, hold on. Time my time out. Are you saying you made 55,000 for 22 episodes or are you saying you made 55,000 per episode? Because I wanna make sure I'm hearing you correct. Lemme make sure you hear me correctly. We did 22 episodes. Yes. We were paid $55,000 per episode. Okay. For 22 shows.


Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's on a hit show. Right. That is unheard of. Yeah. Because we are two black women. I I don't know to fight for it. Right. Countless as young, countless as a baby. Right. In this business. So I don't know to say that We should be making a hundred thousand, 150, 200,000 an episode. Episode. So now today y'all wanna convince us that that show made no money. That show was made over $2 billion. And I'm, I'm guesstimating and you wanna convince us that our percentage, we made no money. We can't allow that to happen. Right. That's why we're fighting.


That's why we're saying No. No guys, we can't sit on our hands like that. Right. You know how many of us, when you watch Good Times, when you watch The Jeffersons, when you watch Sanford and Son whose family is benefiting from our images? 'cause it damn sure ain't ours. Wow. You see why I fight the way I fight? Yeah. Because if it does not make sense, you have to explain it. And I'll go back to Tyler Perry. You know why Tyler Perry don't wanna talk to my husband? 'cause he can't talk around him. My husband don't care nothing about that man's money. We don't care nothing about your title. We care about your character brother. We care about your integrity And what you gonna pay and what, what you, what you going to pay, How you gonna make it Right.


How you gonna make it Right. Because if I am your Aunt Mary and I really belong to you as I really belong to you right now, Shannon, I am your sister and you heard something that was wrong. Yes. How, how can Tyler Perry make it right? Mo give you a job, give you a, your sit, give you a sitcom, say Mo Okay. You know what Mo sitcom, you gonna be the executive producer. I'm gonna be a co-executive producer. You going to do the sitcom If somebody cost you Shannon Sharp millions of dollars. Yes. Do you wanna be compensated for what they cost you for a lie and a rumor? Yeah. So at that time I was making roughly between two and $3 million a year. Right. I sat in net for over 12.


For over a decade. Like 12 years. Right. You do the math over a lie that he admitted that he told not something I'm making up. You admitted that brother. How do you make that Right? You got, I'm sure you got lawyers. Have you had a conversation? Well, What happens is when you take somebody at they word time, time time. We don't need to go to no lawyers. Tyler, you know what you did. Right. Just make it right. Right. And if he doesn't make it right, what will our community do? What will our community say? Because today it's me. Tomorrow is you then what? Yeah, we've got to hold him accountable.


What did what what, what, what Kat say we got. You gotta tell Tyler Perry, come on now. You Gotta do it Shannon. You gotta tell Him. You gotta tell him. Mo obviously when you doing, when you do standup, you go to a lot of different cities, a lot of different clubs. Yes. It's a lot of different promoters. Has everybody always been on the up and up with Monique or did you try Sometimes people try to take advantage. You are female, you black, you heavy, You not gonna say that. Like Mr. From Color Purple You black, you you not gonna do that shit. But, you know, people try to take, people would, would try to take advantage of anyone but seemingly like us Bitch team, were willing to take more advantage of us.


I've Had to tell the promoters, call the police. 'cause either they're gonna come get you or me. They tried to hold up on the money, Call the police because, and this was, this was like $75. Can you Ima 75? Like, you know where we come from? Yeah. If somebody gets you for $25, that's a problem. Yeah, for sure. Imagine 25 million. Yeah. We've seen people lose they life for $25. For sure. Imagine somebody getting you for millions. How you supposed to feel? Would you let it go? Nah, hell no. Right. So when people say, Mo just let it go.


Yeah. But but it bec it's easy for people to say, let it go when they haven't lost anything. Come On baby. It's easy to say. Come on. But when you've lost, how do you, it's kinda like, it's kinda like, you know, Hey, someone should just get over it. You should, you can't tell somebody how to grieve how long to grieve because you're not the one that's hurting. They didn't do it to you. They didn't do it to you. They did. It was done. And, and I will say this right now on your show. I still love y'all. We still love y'all. You love more. They make it make it right. My husband. Okay, say that again because I But you Love y'all more.


Y'all make it right? Yes Indeed. Okay. I'll fix him a poundcake. My my husband would always say, mama, we ain't calling nobody out. We calling them up. And if we continue to call us up on our doings that are not right, we get better as a people. Like we get better. Do you know why things were able to happen? Like they happened on the color purple, Right? Oh, you talking about the rebate? You talking about what I'm Talking about the seventh one. The one that just came out. Right. Right. And at the seventh edition It is like the musical with Fantasia and, and and Taraji. Right, right, right, Right, right, right. That, that one with all our beautiful sisters. Yes. You know why they're able to treat us like they treat us.


How are you handpicked and you audition? No. If you handpicked, you don't audition. I want you to say that again Shannon. Because people don't understand how deep this goes. When I watch my sister say it was an honor to be handpicked. Right. Then why ever would you audition? Yeah. And the moment, in my opinion, the moment she auditioned, they knew we got 'em. We can treat 'em any kinda way we wanna treat 'em. We can do 'em any kinda way. But Why would you want to? Why? Just because you can. That doesn't mean you should, But they did.


But they did. How do you handpick me and then mistreat me. Yes. And then I gotta send a letter to you about the mistreatment that you gave me. That's why they're able to get away with it. That's why when I do interviews oftentimes or these conversations, people are too afraid to even address it. 'cause they don't wanna be caught up. Like, oh, I don't, I don't know. I I I When you say, wait a minute, no, that's the truth. Right? I heard it. And I don't want my character to be on the line as I'm being a person sitting there asking people about their lies. Right.

When did Mo get a first big break in, in, in in comedy? Mm. We Apollo Theater and the sister that stay out front that had the Jerry Curl. If she liked you, everybody liked you. Right. If she did not like you, nobody liked you. And when I saw that woman stand to her feet, baby. Good. I was good. There was so many moments. Were You nervous to go on Apollo? Because you know, if you everybody know about Apollo, You nervous every time. You still get nervous to Go out there every time baby. And not the nervous when you're scared. It's just that like, ooh, I get to do it again.


Yeah. Like when you go out to the field, it's like, ooh, it's that. I I still get that. Yeah. Wow. That's, I mean, to hear you speak and to see like how passionate you are. A very, very passionate person about everything. I love us. I love us. Like when I say I love my people, I love my people. Shannon. I love us. I love everybody. Right. But my people, I love us. So when I speak on things, it's not to drop shade, mess or t I'm too damn grown for that. Right? I'm 56 and a grandmother who got time for that.


But I say it because will it make us better? Right. Will it make us come to the table and say, you know what, what, what do we really leave for the babies that's coming behind us? That means something to me when I talk about them Damn bonnets. Let me tell you something. Yeah. You, they said you, you said, Hey, come on. Can we, like, when we come out the house, can we not have the bond its own? Can we not have the pajamas on? Can we not have the house shoes going in the hotel, The whole damn Halloween costume. That's a Halloween costume that you wear on Halloween. And I am passionate about that because what is the representation that we're giving to the little girls that's walking behind you? What is the representation that we're giving to our black men that's walking beside us?


What is the reputation that we're giving? And when they would say to me, oh Monique, you don't know what they going through. We always been going through something. Yes, we was going through something when we got off the damn boat. We've been going through something true. But once you lose the pride and the dignity of what you, of what you feel like you look like, then we've lost. So I wasn't backing down on that. It's like, no y'all, we owe ourselves right. That we owe ourselves that. How hard is it for you to love some in the community when you know they don't love you back?


That's a good one, Shannon. Okay. That's a good one. 'cause sometime I be in the bathroom having conversations with the ones that don't love me back. But I still love them because I just know they're misinformed. We've been conditioned in such a way in our community to eat each other up and spit each other out. We've been conditioned. Well I don't like her now I love my people. But why, Why do I Love my people? No, no. I'm saying a lot of times you, for me mo Mo is that I don't take someone's word about to. 'cause you can only judge a person through personal experience. Yes. You don't know our audio guy.


I don't. But but to say, oh Mo, I don't like him. And then for you say, well I don't like him either. 'cause Shana didn't like him. You have no personal experience with him. So why would you, why would you dislike it? People want us to dislike somebody because they've had a, a negative experience with that said person. And We buy into it. We buy into it because this one don't like her. And then you say, why don't you like him? Let me, this is one thing my husband said to me one time. He said, mama, there's not a person on the face of this earth that I dislike. I may dislike what they do, but I don't dislike the person. And it took me a minute to understand that. 'cause I'm like, I don't like they ass.


I don't like what they did. I don't like they ass. I don't like their mama. I don't like none of them. But he said, no, there are things you've done that I dislike, but I don't dislike you. Right. And once we can get past that, then we even grow to be better. Right. So what you are seeing right now, Shannon is Mrs. Sidney Hicks that my husband has set me down and had conversations with me and really taught me how to be a lady. 'cause people in this business know if you sideways baby, you beat that boy over the head with that tray in the cafeteria. Right. I will cuss your ass out in ways that they wish I beat him with a tray.


And he had to say, mama, they won't hear you. Right. They don't hear you once you go there. So he's had to teach me how to really be a queen. Right. Really know my worth, really understand my value. And I'm grateful for that. And I used to say to my husband, I wish I could put you in a bottle and shake you up And let black women take a sip to know what it's like to truly be loved by a black man. That is a king. When I tell you Shannon, it's a love that is unexplainable and unimaginable. That's why I can't be broken.


And I say that humbly, I can't be broken 'cause I got a king at home. I got a king right there that when all this shit went crazy, that man took me by my hands and said, don't you know we good. And I believed him. And right now to this day, I believe him. And when you have that type of strength, it's hard to bend over. You can't. Right. You said that when you were at your lowest, he lifted you to your highest. You better know your homework baby. I'm proud of you. We got toso on that one. You better know your damn homework.


I said that when I was at my lowest, he loved me like I was at my best and I was mentally ill. Because you are in this business, everybody thinks you are the hero. Consideration can be thrown out the window. Patience can be thrown out the window because when you get home, you believe that I'm the breadwinner. And what I say is what goes. And this is what it is. And then this is my third marriage. Throw my first because this is the first time I've known my place as a black man's wife. Mm.


And there's a place, and we get so caught up in that word. What you mean your play? What you mean without him saying it? His actions showed me that he was the leader of that household. Without him saying it, I knew I was dealing with a king. And he doesn't have to constantly remind you of it. He, he never, He's never, when we first got together, I sat at the head that table comfortably. There was never a conversation about it till one day I knew I was in the wrong place. Wow. And I moved to the side of the table and he sat at the head.


We never had a conversation about it. It just happened because it was supposed to. So when people question my husband and why is he there? You would hope you would have one like that. I remember our beautiful sister, Tiffany Haddish did an interview with GQ Magazine. And this, in my humble opinion, is where we keep throwing each other under the bus. You are doing an interview with GQ Magazine and I, I'm assuming the journalist was a white person. And the conversation turned to Monique and she said, well, I don't do business like Monique do business. And I'm glad I don't have that husband of hers.


But she don't know your husband. And when I saw that, it's like Tiffany, if you had a husband like mine, you may not have two DUIs. Mm. If you had a husband like mine, you may not be caught up in what looks like you could have been grooming a child. And I say all of that with no judgment, but when you speak about having a husband like mine, you open up the door and I'm saying to you, if you had one like mine, you may not sit in these positions that you can't explain the next day. Right. Or it's a hard way to go. So once again, Which she don't even have a husband, let alone like yours.


Well, well damnit now you said it. I sipped on that, Shannon. That was a sip. That required a sip. You mo Moisha. How did, how did that come about? Moisha? Yeah. You had an audition for Moisha, Right? No sir. Hold On. No sir. You Didn't get on Moisha. I did I say this not to be, but I never auditioned. What? I've never auditioned. They've called I, I, I think I, I, I thought I was auditioning for a Burger King commercial, but what it really was, was the agency I was with at the time.


Right. Just trying to blow smoke. Right. You know, making me think I'm doing something right. But to audition, when I first came to Hollywood, I told this guy named, I believe his name is Mark Re. And I told AJ Johnson and I told a sister named Kim Kimberly Brooks. I said, I'm not auditioning. And they was like, okay. Oh, like your fat ass, you not auditioning. Okay. Fat ass. We'll see that's what they did. They laughed. But I meant that. I'm like, what you see is what you get. I am not going to, especially now. Especially now, why ever would I audition when I've got the highest award that you can get in this business called acting?


And why would I do that? Right. Because once I do that, I devalue me. If you can't look at my work and say that's what we want, then no thank you. Right. Like they'll call, they, they'll send emails and they'll say, what's Monique? Availability? None of your business. I don't know you. So you just gonna send an email and wanna know what's my Availability? I'm offer only, I am offer only. So again, we gotta be careful what we say yes to. What Sidney Poitier say. It's not how many times you say yes, it's how many times you say no. And the moment our baby auditioned, they got set up for no trailers. They got set up for no food.


They got set up for no drivers, because now in their mind, they think you're desperate. Right. So when Oprah does the one-on-one with Taraji and she begins to run down her credits, the great Taraji p Henson, then why ever would you allow the audition to happen? Why ever would you allow that? Why wouldn't you talk, go to that studio and say She doesn't have to. She doesn't have to. I handpick them. So either our sister's not as powerful as we believe she is. Right. Or either there's not the concern that she tries to make it look like it is, But you turn a couple of appearance on Moesha into the Parkers. This is how the Parkers happened. Normally you shoot a pilot, Correct?


Right? Yes. And the pilot, they decide whether or not they're gonna do the show from the pilot, right? Yes. Okay. Count as Vaughn and I, when I go to a meeting with a guy named Larry Little at Big Ticket Television. And at the time, my agent was a woman named Susie unga. They're trying to sell a talk show. Yes. We have a meeting. He says, listen, I don't need her to do a talk show, but if she can act, she has her own show. My agent said, of course she can act. Well, she didn't know if I can act or not, but I said, damnit, of course I can act. They will count as V to that meeting. That was at one o'clock. By that evening, they were negotiating the deal for the Parkers, the way they introduced the character, because they always talked about Kim's mother on Moesha. Right? They, they introduced Nikki Parker in an episode of Moesha, which was the pilot spinoff, right.


To the Parkers. There was never an audition. There was never any of that. So now all of a sudden you got your own sitcom. Shut Up. Come on. Now You go home and you're like, from be more Marilyn from what I went through to this. Yes. Are you looking around like, damnit, I made, I I knew this, I knew this thing was going to happen. Yes, yes, yes. And you know how, you know something as a child? Like, did you know you were gonna play professional? Yeah, Absolutely.


I knew it, Shannon. I knew it. Like I knew as a child, and I say this humbly, I knew the world would know my name. Like I knew that. Right? So once you in it, you be just like, I still can be in a supermarket and somebody say, Monique, is that you and I still can tear up because I'm like, I'm here. Right. I remember when I got my first parking lot at the parks, I didn't know I had a parking space. And they were send out emails to say, if you're here for the Parks Park outside the gate.


That's how naive I was. When you asked me was I naive? So I would park outside the gate. You, I, even though I'm one of the stars of a show baby. They said, if you with the park, 'cause there's no 1 0 1, there's no Hollywood 1 0 1, there's no introduction. They just say, go. And you supposed to get it. Yeah. So I would walk across the parking lot all the way over to the set to the stage till the brother named William Tripp was in a golf cart one day. He said, Mo, what you doing? I said, going to the set. He said, why you walking across the parking lot? I said, oh. Because they said, if you with the Parkers, you gotta park outside the gate. That brothers laughed, but it was a brotherly land.


He said, come here baby. Let me show you something. And I got on that golf cart and he drove me to my parking space that had my name on it. That was a moment for me. Like, I'm pulling up to a studio and that's my name. That's the little fat black girl from Baltimore, Maryland who was in the slow, slow class. That's the low fat black girl from Baltimore, Maryland who didn't have a lot of friends. A lot of people didn't wanna deal with me. But that's my name on that parking space. Now, do you see why I fight? Like I fight? Because it's all possible. But what happens is we then lose ourself in the possibility of what we're getting. And now we are too afraid to lose it.


So all the principles, all the morals, all your values, they don't go away. You just push 'em to the side. 'cause you know what it's like not to have gas money. So I'll just, you know, I I I just go ahead and do that a little bit. Right. My soul won't let me do that. Why did you want to become famous? You asked me earlier, did I know that I was gonna play in the NFL? And I told you yes, because I would've, I wanted to play in the NFL because it was gonna get my grandmother and my family into a situation they probably would've never enjoyed without it. Come on. That was my driving force. That was all I thought about Mo, given your family situation and what transpired, why did Mo want to be famous so bad?


I'm a little fat black girl, baby. And ask another fat black girl. We fight for that attention. Because you wasn't the one picked on the playground to play kickball. Right. You wasn't the one picked for the spelling bee. You wasn't the one picked for this. You wasn't the one picked for that. So I was like, one day, one day, one day, one day. I'm sure you growing up you had your challenges. Yes. You were dark skinned man. Yeah. There was a time you stuttered. Yeah. I wasn't always popping more. Now that you brought it up, let's talk about it. Shea. Shea, yeah. It was the elder talk about, talk about it. Your hair. Your hair was Curly, your skin was black. Yeah. Man. Okay. Yeah.


Now you brought it up. I wasn't always popping. You know what that is? Yeah. So now to be that, now to be that. Yeah. Now you gotta be careful because you remember the time when she told you, no, I don't wanna go out on a date with old black Shannon. Yeah. You know, You Lemme Talk to her right now. Let me talk to your ass. That wouldn't go out with Black Shannon. Now you wish you would've went out with black Shannon that stuttered. Okay. You wish you would've went out with black stuttering? Shannon Sharp's ass. Now look at him. He got the, she she show. I've been her ass up, Chuck. I've been there, I've been there, I've been there. So we understand it, you know? Right. You understand that drive, you understand that thing in you that says, I won't let nobody stop me.


Now my drive wasn't that I wanted to get my family out of poverty because I've always grown up in a middle class environment. So it wasn't that we were dirt poor, you know, we ain't have no whole lot. But I didn't look at it as we were in power. Right. Right. For me, I just wanted to, I wanted the world to know me. And then once I had a son, right. I was very young when I had my first son. I didn't want him to have to go to a college because that was all that my parents could afford. I wanted him to be able to do whatever he wanted to do. And there was a sacrifice in that.


Right. Because when you're trying to go get it, you missing this right here. Oh, You miss a lot. The Nurturing. Yes. You miss all of that. Yes. So, you know, all of that had to be dealt with. Right. So now with this group, with my second set of children, I'm a different mother than I was then. So my whole thing is even right now, we wanna make sure that when we leave here, our babies are good. Right. And their babies are good. And then Tyler Perry not told that lie. We will be on our way to that. And I know people saying why she keep going back to that. I'm gonna keep going back to that shit. Shannon sharp till he takes accountability for Right.


You said your first son. Yes. That you're trying to get it, but it robbed you of a lot of things of a mother son relationship. It did. And so you made sure not to make the mistake this time around. What's your relationship like? Is he re resentful of that? We we're still very much separated. Okay. And, and, and it's a, it's a, it's a, it's one of those things where you have to pray to the universe and say, let Tom do the healing. And that's it. Right. That's it. Let time do that healing. It may heal it in time and it may not.


Right. And that's something that we as parents have to say, listen. Right. I've done what I could do. I've taken accountability for it. Now it's up to you. Right. That's like when somebody's saying, Shannon, I wanna apologize to you. Now it's up to you Whether or not to Accept whether or not to. But once I give it to you, I've done my part. And don't apologize like no punk, I'm just sorry for everything. Uhuh, Uhuh, Uhuh that Get your ass out of it. No. Break it down. Let's go bit by bit so that way we know you understand the offense that you've done Right now. I'm not saying because I've had to do that.


Right. When I tell you I was so outta line and outta order when I first got with my husband. So out of order and out of line, and this been my best friend since 10th grade since we were 14 years old, he came to the other, other weddings. Okay. What? It was like my brother, this man, he was like my brother. He went out hustling you for a minute. Mo You know, he wasn't, that's why so beautiful. Because we really, we were like, we, we had a place together. He would see my boyfriend, I see his girlfriend, you know, then he might, he Didn't feel some type of way. This was my brother. This was literally my brother.


And then if it wasn't my boyfriend, it might be another little fella. Yeah. But you know, he was like my bro. Right. We were brother and sister. Right. So the way it happened, yes. It was so pure. I tell me. That's what I wanna know. Now, you, he came to, you say he came to wedding. You saw him have girlfriends. I don't know if he was married or not before you No. Never been married. You How, how did I gotta know this? I, because Hallmark need to do a story on this. Hey girl, we got time. We got time. We good on time? Absolutely. I want you to say that again. And I don't want Hallmark, but, okay. Okay. Okay. Because this story, this story is spicy and I don't know if Hallmark can handle the spice of the story.


So we've always been like brother and sister. Right. He was the one I would call after a show when I was staying at a motel. And I'd be like, yo, they got me in this motel and niggas outside and everything. I'm scared. He'd be like, but one day, one day you gonna be on the inside. This is the same guy that we was going to the, like our little farmer's market in Baltimore. And I had a comedy club called Monique's Right. In Baltimore. And the girl had on a Monique t-shirt and he says, one day they know you only in Baltimore, but one day they gonna know you all around the world. That's the same guy that when we step off of a plane in London together, and a guy says, my wife knows I fancy you.


And we go, we went back to that moment coming out of that store in Baltimore where one day they'll know you all over the world. Hmm. So he's always been, he always made life right for me. But it was my brother. Right. And I remember one night when I thought Gerald Lavert was my boyfriend. And let me be clear, I thought he was my boyfriend. I was never his girlfriend. Right, right. But in my mind, you know, we, we'll take it somewhere, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm I'm in my feelings. Yeah. 'cause I like this little teddy bear. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But the teddy bear didn't like, It wasn't reciprocated. Okay. Oh right. Not the way I wanted it to be.


Correct. Right. So I called up my best friend, and I'm saying I'm mad. He said, all right. He said, listen, it's all good when you come home, you know, let's just hang out. Right. And when I went home, I was doing the BET awards. Right. And I had a big party At my house. Yeah. And the next day I was supposed to go to Essence for the film, for the Essence Festival. So that night at the house, my house, the outside is packed. Ain't nobody throw a Hollywood party. Shannon shop like Monique threw a Hollywood you thought of, I had every race, every nationality, every everything you thought could be at a party. And everybody was just having a great time.


A great time. Right. So he's at the party and he's very reserved, you know, very reserved cat. So I grab his hand and say, come on, let's go dancing. And we got on and dance. We have a great time after that, I'm like, all right, I gotta start packing to get ready to go to the Essence Festival. So we go upstairs and I take my shower. It's nothing for him to see me naked because we, we were roommates. Right. You know? Yeah. So nothing. So he says, when you come back from Essence, I wanna talk with you. So I said, okay. So he went to kiss me on my cheek, but the kiss was half lip. It was like, here.


Yeah. Okay. Okay. See oh, see, sleep with it. You see it with it. It was right there. It was right there. Right now I tried to turn the whole mouth, but it came right there. Right. Because I felt something different. I felt. And I was like, and then after it happened, we both almost had a feeling of like, we just, we did something wrong like this. Like that's my, so we didn't address it. Right. I came back from Essence Festival. What you wanna talk about? I went to his place. Okay. He fixed dinner. Oh, okay. He fixed dinner and read this amazing poem that he wrote. That was almost 19 years ago. Oh. Oh. We've never been apart since then.


Wow. We've never been apart since then. And I am more in love with that man today than I was when we first got married. Because I didn't really know what I was getting. I knew I was getting somebody I could trust because I just needed somebody that's, you need that. I could just, right. Like my brother stole from me. My, like, I'm just, I just needed somebody that I could just trust and I didn't wanna keep on having randoms. Right. Because that gets old after a while. Yes. You know what I'm saying? You're just trying to fill the void. And men go through that as well as women, you just get tired of. Yeah. So I knew I could trust him, but I didn't know he was the king that he was.


Shannon. I didn't know that. I didn't know that I would be raised. And there are women that have a problem with me saying that. And I will not back down from it. I did not know that that man would take me from a 15-year-old mentality. Even though I'm a star. I'm famous. I got a few dollars in my bank account, but still had that little girl mentality. You can't correct me. You can't say nothing to me. You can't check me. You can't do none of that. Still had that way, that man was able to shut all of that down and grow me up. So I got a great one. I won't even say a good one. I got a great one. You got a great one. Yeah.


You got a A lover, a best friend. Yes. A manager. A husband. Yes. A confidant. Yes. Yes, yes. A Protector. Yeah. You are saying it.

And it seems like people have a hard time getting it, but that's exactly who Sidney Hicks is. He's all of those things. When the Queen of Comedy, when was that a because of some more Adele gis. Ms. Lord tell me about the queen of comedy was we hear about, we hear about the, the, the kings of comedy all the time and it was great. Yeah. You, I was not an original queen of comedy and when I came on Right, I was so honored to be in the presence of three of the greatest female comedians to ever do it. And when I tell you hands down, them sisters are incredible because they've paved ways for people.


And when we got together, Shannon, It was nonstop history making because we were selling out in ways that were unheard of. Right, right. And I can remember our first show, 'cause I was not initially the headliner. Right. Of the queens of comedy. Some more was. Right. And I remember our first show, and this is why I appreciate her, because she knows a great show. Like you have some comedians that feel like you can't follow me. I tore a stage down and it's over. And you can't. You can't. You can't. And and I felt that way one time in my life and that was with DL Hugeley. Right. But you have you she was the headliner of the show and we were in Atlanta and it was one of those shows where the basket for me was this big.


Like I don't care what I said, it was just right. Some more is one of the funniest Yes. It's just our energy are different. I'm liable to run across the stage. Just the energy is different. Right. And that night the energy was just different. It was not that she was less funny, just the energy was different. And this is why I loved that sister. She walked off the stage that night after she closed the show, she walked by me and she said, you had line from now on. And she kept walking. We never discussed it. We never discussed it. It takes for me, it takes a person saying, we want a great show.


Right. We just want a great show. Correct. And that's what that was. Ms. Laura taught me how to warm up food on a damn iron with a towel. She said, bitch, I've been to prison, we don't have no microwave and we gonna eat these buffalo wings. Flip that iron over and wrap that Reynolds wrap up and cover it with that towel baby. Them buffalo wings was so damn good. We just, but did we get treated fairly hell to the No. No we did not. There were times on that Queens of comedy tour that I had to, even on that tour, I had to say some things because it wasn't fair. And the way we were being treated, it was not fair.


There were times when money wasn't right. And I remember the first date for the Queens of comedy and I got a call from my agent and she says to me, no more c and d promoters. You are in the big leagues now. Hmm. Walter Latham wants to, wants you to be a part of the Queen of Comedy. Okay. No, I'm No problem. Thank you. No problem. Because he's the executive producer of the Kings of comedy. Correct. Right. It's Gonna be a Blast. But yeah, The first check I got, let me sip before I tell you. Hell, I'm not meant to take me a sip too.


My banker called me up and said, Monique, this check is no good. I said, excuse me, The money jump funny Sip again. Dammit. I might need a little something strong. Hold on. Dammit. Shannon, the money's no good. I said, what you say? She said, Monique, this check is no good. So I immediately got on the phone with my agent and I said, lemme tell you something about c and d promoters my money always good. Now I need you to get Walter Lathan on the phone. Walter Lathan, from here on out, I will only accept cash from you moving forward. You have two hours to get the money into my account.


If not, take me off of the Queensland Comedy Tour. Did he make it right? He made it right. You saw me on the tour, didn't you? Yeah. And then one night, this is why people could say that's a problem. If I tell you I'm going to pay you $50,000 and 25 cents, what are you expecting? 50,000, 25 cents. So one night they tried to give me what was not all of it. I need all of it. I don't care if it's a little bit, it's mine. Right. Until you get it, my throat hurts.


So they had to call. I get sick on 'em. Shannon, are you You? I feel, oh the weather. Well I performed that night because they had to go get my money. Right. Then they started selling shows off. So what that means is now you got different promoters coming in. We are women. We are women. Okay. Some more had an assistant and I had an assistant and both of our assistants were not the kind of men that was gonna fight. Right. Okay. They might scratch it. Right. But they weren't gonna ball their fist up and do no ging. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So we are in a position now where we're trying to defend ourself. 'cause now you walking up, you walking up you I'm a promoter.


I'm a promoter. I'm a promoter. Take pictures with my family. Take pic. And we had no idea this was happening. Right. One night we are on the kings and queens. Right. And oh how Bernie Mac is missed. Oh, how he's missed. Because he was a real one. Right. Okay. All the kings of comedy had limos separate. Steve had one. Bernie had one said had one, one do had D had one, all of them. Then another limousine pull up and they say, this is for the queens of comedy. I said, I will not. I will not. You better pull up four separate limousines. You're gonna treat us the same way you treated them. We helped sell out 44,000 people.


That wasn't just the kings, it was the kings and and the queens. So you will treat us accordingly. Right. All the kings got Rolex watches when it was over. What y'all get? I'm still waiting for mine. That's the treatment. So when people say, why won't y'all do the Queen again? It was a moment in time and it was a beautiful moment in time and something should be left where they were. Wow. This is what I want to get to. I want you to get to it. A lot of this happened with the movie Precious.


That's the movie that made Monique a star. Amongst star. She shined the brightest because you played that role. Nobody else could have did that role just as Mo Thank you Baby. Nobody. You played it. And I remember walking out the movie and I called my sister. I said, she gonna win the Academy Award for that role. I said, it's almost like she was born in to play that role. Now, now tell correct me if I'm wrong, okay. Okay. You shoot a movie. Yes. The movie rap, you might have to come back and do some voiceover. Some some. Here's some touch up work here or there. Yes.


That's already scripted into the contract. Now the promotion aspect of the contract. What were you contracted to do? Because that seems to be where the, the conflict seems to come in. Yes. Come Because you was like, okay, what? So tell the people that's gonna watch this and listen to this. What was Monique contractually obligated to do as far as the promotional aspect of Precious? I was contractually obligated to promote the movie Precious under Lee Daniels Productions. Okay. I promoted Precious under Lee Daniels productions.


I did Oprah, I did magazines, I did TV shows. I did all of promotions. I was contractually obligated to do. Okay. That was it. That Was it. I'm done with it. Done. Okay, done. Now Precious is going to can, right at the time I have the Monique Show. I am on the Spread the Love tour. I have toddler babies and I'm also a wife. Okay. Monique, the Monique show is like down for maybe a couple days a week or so. Right. I got some days off on the tour. I'm gonna relax with my family. Right. Because once they sold the movie Right.


You didn't sell me Right. Whoopi Goldberg. See, Whoopi Goldberg said I could have schooled you and told you what was expected when I didn't promote and go overseas. And you know how you just looked up and looked away. Yeah. Whoopi Goldberg. What you were saying to me, I could have schooled you and told you you going in in that house and let them have their way with you. Right. And I'll be here when you come back. So after I'm done with my promotions, Lionsgate reaches out to my husband. Initially they think they're talking to my attorney. Right. And they say we want Monique to come to can to, she promoted so well in the United States.


We want her to go international and promote the movie and du cans. Okay. I tell my husband, please let them know I respectfully decline. I appreciate it, but I respectfully decline. I'm gonna spend some time at home. Right. Lionsgate calls back, we really would like for Monique to come to Cannes promote this movie. Please let them know I respectfully decline. I'm gonna spend time with my family. Lionsgate calls back and says, what is it gonna take for us to get Monique to come to Cannes? We'll give her another week in France. We'll upgrade her room. My husband said, is there a dollar amount attached to what you're asking for?


Oh we, we will never pay anyone to promote a film. Never. He said, we understand and we are never gonna work for free. You're asking her to do something that she's not obligated to do. Correct. Well what is this the attorney? He said actually I'm her manager and I and her husband. Now we can put it on the husband's being difficult. Right. Right. Okay. So I don't owe anybody anything. That's why I was never sued. Now we go to the hoodie awards. Tyler Perry is there. Okay. Tyler Perry calls me in his room. Now when I go into Tyler Perry's room, his staff is in there. Now you ready to holler laughing? Yes. Okay. I take my security in there with me 'cause I always wanna have somebody with me.


Right, right. Tyler Perry does this and the people scattered. They all left out the room. I said, look at this shit right here. You saw me And they all scattered. That wasn't The lights, that's for the people. You know, light clap, lights on, Lights off. 'cause they got their asses up outta, okay, okay, okay. Okay. So at the time my security looked at me, I said, you don't work for Tyler Perry. You could Touche. So Tyler Perry says to me, listen Monique, we really need you to, you know, promote this film because if you get nominated for the Oscar, your next movie's gonna be three to $5 million.


If you win it, your next movie is six to $8 million. I said, Tyler Perry, who you talking to? I'm a black woman. Wouldn't they gonna pay that kind of money? No, I'm telling you that's what it is. And, and, and if you just go and promote it, I said, listen brother, you can pay me to promote it. 'cause at the time now, him and Oprah producers on the film. Right. I said, you can pay me to do it. I don't care where the check come from, but y'all decided to pay me to money. I didn't need the money. He said, I'm not in the habit of giving out money for free. I said, and I'm not in the habit of working for free. But you gave TD Jakes a check for a million dollars. But that's another story. And I'm back. So when he then says that, it's like, listen, we both mutually agree you don't give out free money.


I don't work for Free Service. We hugged Shannon when we were done talking, we hugged. Do you hear me? Yes. We hugged like brother and sister. Like it's cool. He understand. Right. Okay. Okay. Oprah Winfrey calls my husband, I want y'all to take your time 'cause I'm getting ready to go. Yeah, you, that's your camera right there. Yeah. 'cause the people at home, they sitting there like, Monique, what happened? Bitch, I'm great. Tate. She calls my husband. Okay. My husband explains to her what's going on? She says, there have been times I've had to draw the line in the sand. So my husband said, well what is different between you and Monique? You've gotta draw the line.


And you're saying, when you know they're asking you for too much. She says, you're absolutely right. And I understand your position. You are right in the position you're taking. So when you are looking at me saying, well what happened? I'm telling you what happened. But okay, she's saying that privately. But did she voice that publicly? Did you hear her say it? I did. Did you hear her say it? Jt Did you hear her say it Zach? No. Did you hear her say it? Zach? Regina? Did you hear her? Tommy? No one seemed to hear that publicly. She said that privately. Now when she said that, see everything we're saying to you, it can be proven.


She had him on speaker phone. And that when she was talking to him in that room was a man named Reggie Wells who just passed who used to be Oprah Winfrey's makeup artist. Who he had a conversation with me and my husband. Now for you babies, that's good. With the little internet, we had a, a show on called Monique and Sidney finding a way to be unoffended, finding a way to be Unoffended. Reggie Wells is on that show. Speaking about Oprah Winfrey. Reggie Wells said, Monique, I was there that day. He said, and when y'all got off the phone, he looked, I looked at her and said, why don't you just pay this woman the money? She deserves it. And she looked at him and said, I won't be paying her nothing. And he said, that's not right.


And you know it's not right. Now that man shared that on that show. So I'm not saying nothing that hasn't been shared. So you have people that will say things in private but won't do it publicly. I'm the person that I will say it in private and I'm going to say it publicly 'cause that's the only way we make it. Right. But you don't need somebody to talk good to your face. You need somebody to talk good behind your back. So if you telling me, if you telling me what a great person I am in my face, but you telling me I'm dog poop behind my back. What good is that Mo? What does that make? Those kind of people, Shannon? That's What does it make those kind of people That's Cowardly. That's that is cowardly.


See here's what's this, when we have our juggernauts, Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steve Harvey, the Kevin Hart, these are our juggernauts of our community. These are the people that our babies say when I grow up, I wanna be that. Yes, I wanna be like that. So we have to call those people to the met and say, listen, what are you teaching our babies? You are feeding poison because you're showing them your private jet. I'm gonna show you my mansion. I'm gonna show you my fancy cars. But my character is shot and I'm bankrupt. I got a lot of money in my bank. It's more zeros than some of them can then we can imagine. But their character, they are bankrupt.


Those are bankrupt people. So everybody that Kat sat right here and told you about, I can't wait to see your next interviews with those people. They ain't coming all now. Mo Invite them. I have. They're not gonna do it. Well look, I've already done Steve. I have a relationship with Steve. He Do him again. Do him again. And I'm gonna say this, I'm trying to get Oprah and and Tyler though Baby we got 'em. Y'all come on. Stop playing. They ain't coming on more fakes, do you? You know how, and I don't wanna put you on a spot, but I'm gonna say it because I appreciate you as a black man and what you're doing.


Thank You. If you are my friend and someone says to me, Monique Shannon shot wrong, me And you my friend. Yeah, I'm gonna call my friend. You gonna come to me and I'm gonna say, Hey is what they saying? True. And if you get to hemming and hawing, I'm gonna tell you till you fix it, you and I can't talk. Because if you'll do them that way, you do that, it'll be a matter of time before you do it to me. So if Steve Harvey is your friend, you call your friend up and you ask him is what our sister saying? Right man. Because if it is, we can't do that to her. If that's our sister. See it took a transgender Named TS Madison.


It was a guy named Jamaica Carter. We, Jamaica Carter and I mutual friend Jamaica Carter and I, friends ts Madison was a mutual friend. So Jamaica called me and said, would you mind doing Ts Madison's show? I go do TS Madison's show. When I tell TS Madison when the camera cuts, I said, listen, your friend is wrong. She said, Monique Lee Dames is my friend. I said, then you need to call your friend and tell him to fix this shit. She said, I will within a couple of days. Who did I get a call from? Lee Lee Daniels. See that's a friend. That's a true friend that's saying I love you so much that I wanna make sure that's not on your heart or your conscience. Let's fix it. Let's make it right. So when people ask Lee, now when we did the deliverance together, how was it to work with Monique?


What it was as if we had never parted ways because he fixed it. He owned it and he took accountability for it. I can't now keep you to the cross 'cause you've owned it. Right. I've had to be forgiven. Right. So I appreciate that, that someone had grace and mercy with me. So I'm gonna have that with other people when they take accountability for what they've done. How much did you make for the role Mary and PR Impression? I was paid $50,000. That's it. That's it. And I never complained because that's what I signed up for. It was an independent film. Right, right. So when my friend called me and I'm gonna quote him, he said, bitch, this one right here, right here. He said, this shit is crazy.


By the time I got to page 10, I called him back. I said, what the hell is this Lee? He said, bitch, I know. He said it's sick. After my husband and I read that script, he said, mama, if you play this with no judgment, when he say action, don't judge the character. Just become it. This is an award-winning. Yes. This is award-winning. So with all of that being said, I never complained about the $50,000 I did everything I was supposed to do. No nothing. It is when they started asking me to become a slave, it is when Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey started asking me to work for free.


It is when they started doing the bidding for whomever the gatekeeper was at the time. To say we can get her. Remember the scene in Sparkle? You ever seen Sparkle with Irene Carroll? Yeah. And Philip Mike Thomas. Yeah. Remember when they was in the car? 'cause the Jew man was trying to get him to sign over that contract and he kept shaking his head like, you will not get me to turn my back on this woman. Right. That's what this is. We ain't turning our back. My husband ain't turning this back. He ain't signing up for something he know ain't Right. Right. And people have a problem with that. And we gotta keep speaking on it, Shannon, because the next one's coming for real. I would hate for you to have to sit another sister in this chair and she tell you the same story.


So considering you won the Oscar, normally when you win the Oscar, not saying you gonna win another or get Oscar worthy scripts, but there's normally a a run where you and you know, two, three films now, Monique, that 50,000 is 500 or a million or 2 million. You feel, feel that you were blackballed from that point and Monique did not make the money. What she should have been compensated for future roles. Let's tie it all back in. Okay. Okay. You have a man that says I lied on you. Yes. I put a rumor out there on you.


Yeah. And I said I was gonna apologize. But then you have another man that comes back when I'm offered Empire and says, Mo, they said you difficult to work with, you gonna be a problem. Where would they get that from? What? Somebody that's as powerful as as Tyler. Okay. So now I'm scratched from that. Yeah. Right Now when it comes to movies, I'm a difficult person to work with. Ain't nobody ever had a problem with me. They Never said Did they say, did anybody say that prior to Precious? Yes. No, not prior to Precious. Right. I've never had a problem with nobody. I long as I was saying, yes, you good. The moment you start challenging, we got a problem. What about the Parker?


What about Moisha? Had anybody said anything prior about Monique's character prior to pre her not wanting to do international press, what she wasn't contractually obligated to do? Never prior to that nobody said anything. Never. The only person that could say anything as a, that is a producer, is a guy named Will Packer. I did a movie called Almost Christmas When Will Packer sat down with my husband and I, Shannon, every other word out his mouth was queen. You our queen and the queen and the queen and the queen. And we just want you to do a cameo and here's what we going to pay you. My husband said, will, that does not cover Monique doing promotions that covers none of that brother.


Right. This is just for the cameo. Okay. Right. Yeah. The director was David Tower. My husband and David Tower were college roommates. They, they were crossed the hall from one another. Right in the script. I was that quick. 'cause it's a cameo. You right. Okay. Yeah. So 99% of the things you heard aunt may say it was Monique it was me Ad Libby A. Yeah. Okay. 'cause it's a cameo. Right. When we had a meeting with Will Pack or Wil Packer says, if you do this for me, I'll give you a three picture deal. And they sit calm. Now we have all of this in writing. It's all In writing. What were you, what were you, what were you, what were you needing to do? A press? You going to need to do press for it?


You gonna need to promote it Or just, just do the cameo. Just do the cameo. That is what was agreed upon. We were gonna do a cameo for the amount of money that he said they were gonna pay. No problem. Well, what they did was they kept spreading it out. They kept spreading this character out. We want you on this scene and that scene in this scene. But There ain't no cameo. Cameo is a, Okay. Okay. David Tower is our fa is our friend. We don't wanna make this bad for David Tower. So we said, okay, no problem. Now let's talk about the treatment. While we're on that set of almost Christmas, there were a few things that was happening that I took issue with. Will Packer is a producer. He came on that set and tried to give us a direction while the director was standing right there.


I said, will Packer, I will not allow you to do that. You would never do that to Steven Spielberg. You would never do that to a white director. You as a producer gonna just walk in and give a direction. So I will not take direction from you. If you have something you wanna give to me, you give it to the director and you have the director to give it to me, you are disrespectful to him. Now, I had a meeting in David Bert's trailer with Will Packer, David Talbert and the first ad, because they were being disrespectful to this black man. Mm. And I was not gonna allow that to happen. Okay. I had a conversation with the first ad and I pulled him outside. I said, listen brother, when it's your turn, I won't let nobody do it to you. But what I'm not gonna do is standby and watch you give a direction.


After the director give us a direction. It confuses the cast and it's disrespectful. And to that black man's credit, his eyes filled up with water. And he said, I appreciate you for having this conversation with me. Okay, so we'll pack. And I now at odds because I'm seeing how this brother's acting. I'm in my trailer, my assistant at the time, her name was Robin, right? Robin is in her fifties. She's in in my trailer with her shoes off. She's on the computer Wool Packer's friend, or I'm not sure what title to give her. Okay? She comes into the trailer. Now, in this trailer it is me, my hairstylist, makeup artist, and my assistant, this young lady who we are all old enough to be her mother, she comes and looks at my assistant and says, what's your shoes doing off You in your trailer?


Why do you care? I said, excuse me, you are outta order. You don't come in here questioning nobody in my trailer, as a matter of fact. And her energy was not that up. I'm playing. It was what you, I said, as a matter of fact, I need you to go get Will. 'cause I'm not even gonna have this conversation with you. I'm gonna talk to your boss. When Will Packer comes into that trailer for us to talk? Do you know what that man says to me? And my hairstylist and my makeup artist and my assistant, I am the head nigga in charge. Everything stops with me. I said, well, I wanna let you know this will, you're going to hear that you're the head nigga in charge for me.


As many times as I can tell people, that's what you said. I said, and furthermore, you need to check your assistant because this is my space. We weren't in your trailer with our shoes off. We're in my space with our shoes off. But why would he come? Why would he come to you with that type of energy? What, what led? What led him to say that when all you ask his assistant to do was to go get him? Because she's questioning why people in your trailer have The truth. That's a good one. Because what I said to him was, who do we need to talk to? This young lady can't be up in here like that. And that's when he became the head nigga in charge. Oh. And then I said, who are you the head nigga in charge of, we have Danny Glover on this set.


We have a legend and the icon. Are you the head nigga in charge of him? Are you the head nigga in charge of Kimberly Elise? Are you the head nigga in charge of Gabrielle Union? Are you the head nigga in charge of JB Smooth? Who are you the head nigga in charge of? So he tried to laugh it and joke it. I said, Uhuh, I don't play that way, brother. I said, the food is bad. Like what we doing here? The food was slop. So when they say they didn't have any food, the food we had, nobody ever ate that food because it was just like, you can feed them anything. Now here's where it gets even better. Remember how Taraji said the trailers were infested? Yes. Our trailers blew up. Wow. They blew up.


Now what I, whenever this airs, I'm gonna post the trailers blowing up so the people can see. Right. But they blew up. And if any of us were in those trailers, we would have been gone. Right. The trailers blew up. Now when I was smelling the gas, we went to the brothers that was hooking up the trailers and we said, Hey, we smell gas. They said, Mo, we let him know, talking about the head nigga in charge, we let him know. He just said Okay. And walked away. I said, he what? He just said. Okay. And walked away. The trailers blew up. Did Wil Packer reach out to anybody? I can't say. He didn't reach out to me and say, Hey, is everything okay?


Did you lose anything in the, in the, is everything good? The only thing they wanted to know from me was, where was Aunt May's wigs? Huh? Where are those wigs? Nobody asked. Not the studio. Not Will Packer. Not nobody. Wow. Said, are you good? Did you lose anything? Right. I said the wigs blew up in the explosion. Right. So to understand what we have to deal with and to understand, most people are too afraid to say it out loud that we are being mistreated.


This is, this is, this is not. Right. Right. So if that means y'all won't wanna play with me, I don't wanna play with you either. Let's be clear. I don't wanna play with somebody that don't care if I've blown up. What if we were in those trailers? What do y'all say to my family? What do you say? So with Precious, I owed no one anything. Right. With almost Christmas, I owed you nothing. However, I did it because we had a relationship with a brother named David Tower. Right. And we didn't wanna send him through no drama, no nothing. So we went along with it. Other than that, Shannon Sharp, there is no one that can say, that will sit in my face or my husband's face and say, we had a bad experience with you.


I read that you said you read you, this is a chapter of forgiveness. That's your thing. A chapter of Forgiveness. I didn't say that. That's what the God Hollywood reporter said. Okay. Don't put words in my mouth, did you? That's not what I said. That's what his ass said. What did you say? Okay. Okay. That's what he said. Listen, What would it take Mo Mo? What would it take for Mo? Need to forgive Oprah and Tyler Perry. Be accountable. Be accountable. And for Tyler Perry, you Want Tyler Perry to say what he said on that tape? You want him to say that publicly And he cost my family millions. And you want to be compensated.


Yes. I wanna be very clear about that. If someone cost you millions, do you want that back? Absolutely. So I'm no different than you. Right. Especially when I've done nothing wrong. Right. Especially when you've admitted that you've lied. Okay. Especially when you've admitted that you started a rumor. Yes. You need to compensate me and my family for Oprah. For Oprah Winfrey. You owe me an apology. See Shannon, Oprah and I had a private conversation about our mothers. This the part people don't know. Right. I shared with that woman what me and my mother were going through. Now my mother's no longer here. Right. Right. And I shared with Oprah Winfrey what we were going through and how I felt.


And I was, you know, you, you trying to balance it off because it's your mother can steal your mom. And I shared that with you. And I shared with her my family and what the dynamic was. And you don't tell me you going have my goding parents. I was getting ready to say, God baby, it was right there. But you don't tell me. You can have my mother and my father on your show. And you think that that's just okay. And the way you try to apologize in front of a group of women, if you think I've done anything wrong. No, no, no, no, no, No. You're gonna stop that. Right. I am very proud of what you've accomplished in your life. We respect everybody. Right. But we over respect no one. And Oprah Winfrey walks around like, I can't be checked.


I I won't admit to that I'm wrong. I'm, I'm a firm believer. Mo no one is beyond repro. No one at all. So when you keep saying what is it? I'm gonna keep answering you the same exact way. Right. So if you talk to your camera, I'm gonna talk to my camera and see how they split the screen. And we gonna invite 'em at the same time you talk to 'em first. Okay. Tyler, Oprah. I would greatly appreciate it if you two guys would come on club Shehe. We'll sit down, we'll have a conversation. This is not an interview. This is not hard hitting. I want you to tell your truth. Ms. Oprah. Tyler, tell your truth. And we can get to the bottom of this because hey, we got an icon here sitting on this couch and she's hurting Oprah and Tyler. I wanna say I appreciate my brother Shannon Shaw for saying what he just said.


And I wanna clear something up. I'm not hurt personally. I'm hurt for our community. I'm hurt that y'all would allow yourselves to sit in something that you know that you've done wrong and not say anything that helps us. Not so Brother Shehe have said, y'all come on, on the sofa. Oprah, this liquor is good. Okay? And I understand you like cranberry and vodka. Okay? Roosevelt Cartwright told me your drink that you like and you know, he told me some other things with the drink that you like. Come on, on Uncle Shaha. Let's have a conversation. Ain't well you took yours all the way down and I cannot, okay. Okay. I cannot, I cannot do that. You, Yeah. You already did a good, you Good job. Thank you Sugar. Appreciate it. Now when we get ready to wrap up, I'm gonna give you an exclusive on something that don't nobody know.


Woo. Okay. Don't nobody know this. And I, it's gonna be something. It's gonna be Something. It's gonna be something I want to get. Look, I, I know it's traumatic and if you don't want to have to relive it, you don't have to. What you went through with your brother. Yes. When you going through that, how is that impacting you during that time? Because I think you're seven to 13. You better do your damn homework. Shannon Shaw And the impact that has had on you and your relationship with men. Oh, Shannon trying to be a journalist.


Nah, Nah. Shannon, Throw this. Dammit. You see? You trying to come up Bubble. Just get off my brother. What impact? Wow. Remember when you said, and I don't know if you said this, so I don't wanna quote her 'cause I could be wrong. Okay? But someone said, Shannon Sharp, don't mess with black women. And Before you go any further, can I say this Please? My grandmother told me something when I was a little boy. She said, boy, never chased a lie. Come On baby. Come on, come on.


Why? And you never said that, right? I've never said that. Okay. So that's why I said I got black kids. That's what I said. I said them babies black. Black. Yes. They not confusing. Yes. We ain't trying to see if she Latin or Dominican. They black. Black. They mama got black. Black. Everybody that shared and messed with was black. Black. Right. Black. Black. Okay. So they, there's this thing with us that you can't tell us nothing. And oftentimes when a black woman's been traumatized, she's guarded. Now you take a black woman that's been traumatized and now she got a little bit of money and you take black men, some of them that is impressed with the money.


So I can say to you what I want to, not being totally disrespectful, but you know who running this. Yeah. You know how we do this. I've always had an aggressive personality. Yes. I have always jumped with, if I think you trying to violate, so to say, what did that do to me? It, it made me like this. And it made me say, I'll get you before you can get me. Because I know what it's like to not be in control of what you're taking from me. Right. I know what it's like to be in a position where there's nothing I can do.


Right. So when it came to men, baby, listen. I had my, my share. Okay. I'm not saying I was no whore, But I was close. Hey, come on now, Shannon. Get back to me now. Get back to me. Call me later. Call me later. Call me later, baby. Come Lord. Because you a football player with a lot of money. When you go into a city and you was in your prime. Yeah, you had your pick. It's no different for a woman. When I went into a city, everybody wanted to be Professor Ogilvy. Hey. And I would pick him. You okay? You look like you could be. But see, here's the thing. Now Mo, all of a sudden you being this fat black woman, it ain't a problem.


You gotta remember, I remember you said it One, well, lemme say this, it wasn't never a problem with me being a fat black woman. 'cause real black men, they like 'em in all states and size. It's all complex. It's these new negroes that get into, she gotta be this way. She gotta be that way. But real black men, if you can beg a poundcake naked, What y'all talking about? Whatcha talking about? But what what, what it did though was, and this is why I feel the way I feel about my husband, okay? I remember him saying to me one night, because when we first got together, I was, I was a handful Shannon. And that's when I was really sick in the way that I thought, right?


And he said, check this out. You've used your brother molesting you as a crutch for your bad behavior. Oh, he said, and I won't allow that. He said, when you was a little girl, there was nothing you can do about it. But now, as a grown woman, every choice and decision you make, it is yours. And I will not allow you to keep on saying because of my brother. Because at what point do you take accountability for you baby? That grew me up. And that night that grew my ass up that night so fast because I wanted, I wanted to hear what my psych, my psychiatrist was saying to me. I understand. My husband was like, check this out, check this out. You are in control of you. Every choice and decision you make, every one you lay down with, that was your choice.


You've never come back to me and said You were raped as a grown woman. You've never said that. So stop holding onto that crutch. Stop holding onto that victim. 'cause this happened to me. I, I, I'm, I'm mad for days. And I come up out of that. And when I went to the psychiatrist, right? Everything my husband said to me, the psychiatrist said to me, but he said, I needed you to go to somebody that had no dog in the fight. 'cause I didn't want you to think I was judging you. I didn't want you to think that because I know the history. I'm pointing my finger. So when I would go to that psychiatrist, Dr. Cassandra Lonzo, she's incredible.


Y'all wanna know about red bottom shoes? Lemme tell you somebody that's gonna get your mind right? Dr. Cassandra Lonzo, this woman was incredible. But every time I would go to session, everything she said, my husband had already told me. So me and men, I had to come to grips with that. I had to come to grips with being an insecure fat girl. And I had to come to grips with my sister telling me, ain't no man gonna ever really want you 'cause you fat. I had to come to grips with my father was like, listen, I'm here, but I'm really not. I had to come to grips with those things. So my way of coming to grips with those things was now I'm a boss. I'm independent and I'm empowered. Don't you know I run this? See, I too went to the Oprah Winfrey University of Empowerment.


And you don't need a man to make it. Right. I signed up, right. And I was at the top of the class till I realized I was going to bed it empty. I was going to bed it with nothing but stuff. I did not wanna be the poor little rich girl who have everything but nothing at all. Don't that sound familiar? I did not wanna be that Shannon. So even for the men, even for the men that I was with, right? You Were with them. I wasn't, no. Okay. Talk to me Shannon, let that liquor use you. That was just, I wasn't with them. That was just a body for the lonely Liquor. Makes shit sound good, won't it?


Liquor will make you not sound like a whore. It was just a body for the lonely. Let me tell you what my husband told me, right? Because I was in tears. I'm like, I'm, I'm, you know, I I I was, I was a whore. I was crying. I was, 'cause 'cause when you come to grips with it, when you realize how many, when you realize what you've done and you got to come to grips with it. And now I'm sitting in front of the greatest person I've ever met. And I gotta say, I have been with this many and my husband looked at me and said, mama, you ain't no whore. You just have friendly pussy. Didn't he make it right? That's all I shit was Friendly pussy. So for you whores out there, you Aint what?


It's friendly pussy. Right? That's what he told me. Shit. He made it. Right. So did you ever have a good relationship with your father? Yes. When I was a little girl. Little When I was a little girl, my father could do no wrong. When I was a little girl, baby, my father would put me in that car and he would go to the cut race store and he get his liquor and he go over Mr. Johnny House. Now I'm a little girl, right? Right. He go over Mr. Johnny House and him and Mr. Johnny go in the back and I could smell the reefer, but I didn't know it was reefer. Right? Right. And they smoke and they had that little drink. They come back out. I was attached to him. Me and my father started having a problem when what he was saying to me wasn't making sense, What did He say? And now I'm about 13.


Okay. He was just, he was, he was a bullshitter. Right. But he was a good sounding bullshitter. Right? Like, and so as a kid you'd be like, my father know everything. But once I started growing up and I started seeing the treatment that he gave my mother, mm. Never physically abusive, but mentally. Mentally they abused one another. I won't just put it on. But once I started questioning him on just some of his decisions and choices, right? I became the bad person. And I went to my grandmother one time. Mimi. Yeah. I talk about her. And You have a very close relationship with your grandmother, right? As Did I and my father, this was one incident that sent me to my grandmother.


B bent over crying. I was trying to get a Ford Festiva, right? It was 4G, right? Okay. It was about $2. But I didn't have the $2. Right. And I needed a co-signer, right? Yeah. So I asked my father, please co-sign for me to get this for, and I'm gonna quote him. He said, N you won't fuck up my credit. And I'm like, well, what have I ever done to make you think I would fuck up your credit? I, I pay my rent on time. I'm responsible. I go to work. No. The next week, not only did he co-sign for my sister, he just signed for my sister. Like he put the call in his name. In his name, right.


I go to my grandmother and I'm like, Mimi, why would he do that? Like she said, Nikki, every parent knows their weakest link and every parent knows the one that's gonna be okay. She said, you're gonna be okay. At that point, I wiped my tears and I'm glad he didn't co-sign. I'm glad I had to bust my ass to get it. I'm glad I had to figure it out. I'm glad he didn't just come and rescue it. I had to figure it out. So that's why right now, when I sit here and you go through dec a decade of being blackballed or whatever, you're difficult and all that, it allowed me to keep standing. It allowed me not to.


It allowed me not to go sit on a couch with Oprah Winfrey and say, I'm sorry for nothing I've ever done to you. Right? That's what those lessons taught me. Stand in it and stand strong unapologetically. You speak a lot during this interview. You spoke a lot about curses and the trauma. How do we break that generational trauma, that curse that is in our community, What we've said from the beginning. And that's truth. It's just the truth. We get so comfortable based off of lies that the lies become the truth. I think if we just started dealing with the truth, Address it. Address it. Even when it doesn't put you in a good light, it eventually does put you in a good light.


Because then people start talking about your honor and your character. Right? And your integrity. If I've wronged you, please tell me. Right? Please tell me and then show me where I've wronged you. If you can say, Monique, this is what you did right here, then I owe you an apology. But if our community dealt in truth, how much further would we be? That's it. That's how, that's how I think we make it better, right? We deal in the absolute truth. But sometimes, you know, it's kinda like what I, I tell people, I would explain to someone when I said, just imagine you went to the doctor and Lord forbid this happened, you have cancer, but we're not gonna treat it. It's gonna go away.


No doctor would tell you that you have something going on. We're not gonna talk about it. It'll just go away. That's what they bank on. That's what they bank on. And too many of our black women have gone to their graves. They've left here in despair. They've left here broken hearted, broken, broke down. And we got a chance to see it en live and in person with our beautiful sister, Taraji Henson. Right. What gave you the courage? Your Netflix, they offered you one thing. You found out they had gave someone 10 times that no 20 times that come On 26, 26 times that.


And you're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We, I'm not trying to do that. We're not gonna do that. We're gonna do fair. That's what we do. Yes. I mean we, you speak about diversity and you talk about doing the right thing. Okay? This is an opportunity for you to put that instead of be a lip service. Okay? Put pen to paper. Let's make it right. I didn't know any other way. I didn't know any other way. See, when I heard Wanda Sykes say I support you, I just went somewhere else. I don't know how to do that. Right. Especially when it's wrong. If we keep just going somewhere else, we'll keep getting mistreated. Right? But when you hear Amy Schumer, and this was not something I found out. They publicly said it. Right. It was, it was pride. Right? We paid Amy Schumer, 11 million.


She came back and said, I'm not a legend or icon, but I should get at least two more million. And they gave her 13 million. Well, when Netflix says to me, you are a legend. You are an icon. When Robbie Paul says that, well, why is my legend an icon different right? Than these people legend an icon. That's all. And when I say we were able to come to the table and we were able to make it make sense and we were able to do the special and we appreciated them saying, listen, how can we work this out Now, you know what happens with that? People were having call-ins when I said This is not right. I was donkey the other day, remember that? I was Donkey of the day.


The breakfast nubs called me the donkey of the day. That's what they said. And they had a whole calling about how I was dokey of the day. But you didn't do the same thing when you found out we settled. Now all of a sudden, don't nobody know what a settlement is. I mean, well we don't even really, it was really, really quick. We just wanna throw it away. So with that Netflix special, it was just, it was just like, no guys, I gotta, I gotta stand up because if not that little girl coming behind me for real Right. That has that resume. I wanna let her know you can fight baby. Right. You just don't have to say, okay, you can stand. Would you be willing to do another Netflix, Netflix special?


Yeah. I had a great time. I had a great time. I had a great time. Now for me, specials are specials. Right. It's something special. Right. So, you know, we'll see. Right. You know, I I, I I I wanted to ask people that, that I hear our community call. You know the community called me unc. Yes. And they call you auntie. Yes. Do you wear that with a badge? Courage like I do. I wear it. That was such an honor for you babies to put auntie on my name. Do y'all know how that made me feel? And I'm not the auntie that's gonna tell you the shit that you want to hear. I'm the auntie that's gonna tell you what you need to hear.


So for the things that I have said about our community and our babies and our sisters, I cannot back down because y'all gave me the title. I didn't ask for it. But when they gave it to me, Shannon, that was the universe saying, you now sit in that seat. Yep. You are now responsible. Yes. That's why I must speak out and I must speak gladly and I must say it to the top of my lungs. 'cause God damn, if Fannie Lou Hamer didn't do it for me. Right. God damn. If Earth couldn't do it for me, God damn if Moms maybe didn't do it for me, the ones that came before us and as a woman still alive named Sylvia Tremor Morrison. That woman got paid in a Coca-Cola. That woman got paid in a Coca-Cola at her next gig and $5.


She was the first black woman to write for Saturday Night Live. But they have a listed as a production assistant and she's still alive. That's why I speak the way I speak because I will not let them wash her out of history as if she never existed. Wow. Dating what, what advice if somebody, if, if a group of women were in here, it is like Aunt, come on honey. They talk to us. How this dating thing because this, it is, it Mo is different now than when you, when you and I were, it's different baby. I'm grateful I'm not 56 and trying. But you trying to say what you trying to say. I'm looking right at you.


I thought you looking. I ain't backing down. You better take your old ass and get somebody to love you Damn mo. Now I'm looking right at y. Tell y'all what Shannon need. Let me leave my life. Lemme tell you what my baby need. He need him old fat down. Who can bake good cakes? Make some smother Turkey wings. Who going rub his feet at the nighttime? Okay. And going to have a sip of his cognac to make him feel better by hisself when he come home at night. That's what Shannon need. You don't need no 26-year-old girl. You don't need no 36-year-old girl. I don't. This is your auntie talking to you. Take your old ass and get your old bitch out there that can love your old, you trying to hang out with these young bitches and you, you can't do it Shannon. You just can't do it. When they want you to go for the fourth round, you looking at her like, bitch listen, I need, you want some money to go to Starbucks.


Yeah. 'cause I can't go no further. But if you get your older girl, when you get to that fourth round, she gonna say Hold on, hold on. Lemme go get you some eggs and cheese and some toast with apple butter. 'cause that's gonna get you energy back up. I'm talking right to you. Shit. So he was doing, I was gonna be scared to Yes, I'm talking and I know old gal, she'll be good to you. Her name is Ella. Dora. Now when you know somebody named Ella Dova? Yeah. Yeah. She's old school now. Ms. Eldora told me to tell you. She say I think he like red velvet. Oh, I do, I Do. I say Ms. Eldora, if he do like that, she say you let him know I got something for him. Yeah, I let And she don't have no teeth. Come on, pick your glass up and clack. Clack. Come on now.


These young, young gals will bite you. Okay? Yeah. Okay. I got guess I gotta come on home. Come On home Shannon and y'all stop putting lies out about my brother because I was in my feelings when y'all said he didn't date black women. Y'all stop that shit. You stop now. He might throw a white one in there every now and and it's okay sometime there. You know we ain't into everything. Yeah. We don't do everything. So sometime Uncle Shehe need a space of light. Yeah, there you go. He need To go across the street. But he always gonna come back. That's why we said, are you open Tyler, come on home, come on home, come on home. Come on home.


Sierra says, a lot of women talk about Sierra's prayer, but when a God sends a good man, they don't want them. Is that true? I cannot speak for them. I can only speak for me. 'cause when the universe sent mine to me, baby, You was ready. You was ready When he sent that man to me. Even this morning, I thanked the universe for that man right there before I came on air. Ch I was talking to him. I know he said, mama, you heard me talk? I said, I did. I said, Hey daddy. Yeah, yeah I did. Because we've not been trained, we've not been conditioned to understand you. We've been trained to fight against you. Right. We've been trained to go against you. We've watched our mamas, our grandmamas, our aunties speak ill of a black man.


So now when a black man comes and they good, you waiting for the bad because Grandmama told you black man wasn't shit. Mama told you black wasn't, wasn't shit. Your auntie said black man ain't shit. So all you have in your mind is black man ain't shitting. So when you get that beautiful black man, he's now got to say to you, erase everything. They torture. Right. 'cause I'm here or You, then you treat him like that. And then he goes, and then you talking about, now You mad 'cause he didn't want you. The white girl, Shannon. Now y'all start treating Shannon good. Okay. Start treating him good now Shannon, I got to catch my plane. Okay. This is the last one. Unless you wanna send me back on your jet. I wish I had one more. I wish I had one, but I'm gonna get you out here on this one. See what Y'all Did. Y'all, you heard what Shaq saying? Shaq said what he say? They asked Shaq, should a man open up to a woman?


Shaq said, no. He says, because if you do, they're gonna use it against you. He said, because if I break, if I'm crying about something, they gonna say the first time they get mad, they gonna, they see you crying because your daddy said what he said to you. How do you take advice from a man who has no woman? And I love Shaq, but how do you take advice from my brother that has no one? Okay. If you have that person in your life and you say, listen, I'm dealing, I'm going through, who else do you talk to at nighttime in your pillow talk? Who else do you share your life with? Who are you sharing with, with your life, with Shaq? Do you tell another man about your situation and does he make you feel better? Like who do you share your life with?


So I don't agree with that at all. And I love my brother, but I don't agree with that. I think that makes the vision. 'cause if I gotta call my girl and I talk to my husband, right? When I heard Oprah say, and these are her words, not mine. She said, when I be stressed out and I be going through it after the show, I will come home and Gail could calm me down and put me to sleep. What you say? Well, sta okay, Then you said it On, said I'm Nope, nope. Oh, I'm gonna get Oprah on here. I'm gonna get Oprah on the show. But those Are her words. So IIII believe that partnership is partnership all the way around. When I leave this earth, there's nothing. My husband will not know about me and the other way around. Did you know after your first two marriages you gonna get married again?


Yes. Because my first two marriages were just marriages of my first marriage was you just couldn't have the, the, the milk without buying the cow. Right. That was the first marriage. Right. And we were boxers. Okay. And we were Friday night fights. Okay. Okay. We were fri it wasn't domestic violence. We was Friday night fights. Right. Okay. I took a L sometime, but sometime I didn't. Right. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. The second one was, I couldn't afford to pay my rent. Right. And I didn't wanna have a boyfriend. Right. So that's why I said, this is the first time I've really been married. Right. Tell me the story that you wanted to share that nobody else knows that you was going share with us. Y'all ready for this? I'm ready for this. I want you to move in.


That man that was sitting right here on this couch. His name is Kat Williams. Yes. Kat Williams and I have a relationship with are fraternal twins. That's all. That's It. That's it. That is my twin, my spiritual, fraternal, non biological brother. We are twins, baby. Yes, we are. That was it. And that was all. Thank you. Don't nobody know that, but you, Kat Williams don't even know the shit. Yeah. That's what make it so beautiful. So Kat, I'm I'm, I'm gonna call him.
