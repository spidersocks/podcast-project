Can you hear me? Fuck yeah. Thank you guys for joining us. Thank you guys for joining us. Welcome to Nightcap NFL Draft 2025. I am your favorite on Shannon short draft class 1990 pick 1 92 Bronco Ring of Fame 2009 Pro Football Hall of Fame 2011. My partner and co-host draft class 2001 Bingos Ring of Fame honoree 2024. No, 3 23 22 2.


No, you went in our first year together. Okay, 23 2 23. Yeah. This is Chad Ochocinco Johnson. Thank You guys together. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Can you hear me? Yeah. Be before. Before I start, I need you to repeat after me. Okay. I said repeat after me. Repeat after me. Hello. Hello. I I fucking love you. Fucking love you. Let's go The Tennessee. Look. This is the worst kept secret of America guys. When they canceled all the other pre-draft workouts and said after they worked that Camp Ward, they, Travis, thank you, but no thank you Ur.


Thank you, but no thank you. Yeah, all those other guys, I think they've settled on their guy. When you become this set on your guy, you have him targeted. You've been watching him for a long period of time, you want this guy to come in and start. This is not, well, let's see. Wait till the last minute. Let's look at it. Couple of other guys on your, this is the guy they targeted, right? This is the guy they want. They believe this is the guy that's gonna be their Steve McNair. Get them back and play off contention year after year. Get them to a Super Bowl. What is it that you like so much about Cam Ward? I like what Cam was able to do for the hurricane. He's able to have back to resurgence where they were a top team that usually often look very good seeing him as a trend talent or a generational talent.


Or he got there. I like him. He's been able to do so. I'm not sure what's gonna happen once he gets there. Obviously he's their answer and he's supposed to be the answer for the next 10 years. Similar to what Jayden Daniels did for the Commanders. I'm excited. You know what I like most about Cam Ward adversity? Yes. He just didn't go to one university. He started out at, at at MAC camp. He goes to, he goes all over the place and then he settles into the University of Miami. You want guys that have had adversity in their life. You want guys that have gone through things Yes. Struggle because it's going to be a struggle. Yes. At some point in time you're gonna face adversity as a quarterback or even a player in the NFL and having gone through that adversity, he knows what it's like to fall on hard times, pick himself up and start back down there again.


I I I have a question for you. Yes. If Cam Ward does, does go number one, is he a date, one starter or is a quarterback competition with Will Levison and Cam? Well, they'll say it's a quarterback competition. But Cam Ward, because they singled him out so long ago, Ojo, they didn't bring anybody else in. They knew they wanted a quarterback and they knew in order for you to win in this league, you got to have a quarterback. Right. The reason, think about it. Why isn't a quarterback competition we're picking number one of all because the quarterback that's on the roster wasn't any good or it wasn't very good. Let's be real with it. Right. Right. 'cause if he was that good, they would be picking this high. Yes. The pure fact that they're picking this high and they're taking a quarterback tells you they want to transition and go to Cam war. Now what happened if the titans pull a wool of our eyes?


They have everybody thinking they taking Cam war first and they pull a wool and do something else with the first pick of the draft. I Don't, I don't believe they're gonna do anything different on Joe. Lemme tell you why they, it seem like they've been set on this pick for such a long time. Yeah. And when you're picking this high and you're gonna guarantee this guy somewhere between 40 and 45 million. Yes sir. His contract is gonna be fully guaranteed. I would've liked to thought that if you wanted, was thinking about going somewhere else. You bring somebody else in, talk to him, get a feel for him. They could. They could. Right. But I don't believe that's the case. I believe Cam Ward is their guy. This is the funny thing about it. If you have the number one pick, you really don't have to talk to anybody else. 'cause you already know who you're taking regardless.


Correct. You don't know what their plans are. Especially in the war room. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes You know how they play. You never know. It's a chance to chess match. So I'm curious, I'm excited if Cam Ward does go to Tennessee, I wish him nothing but the best at number two. Where would y'all like to see who, who, who going number two? Tra Tramp. Yeah. Travis Hunter. Abdul Carter. Yeah. I think it's, I think it's a two horse race for number two. I think it's Travis Hunter and Abdul Carter. Obviously Travis is a two-way player. Yes. He can give you offense. He can give you defense. Abdul Carter is an edge rusher 12 sacks this past season buys a lot of people. Michael Parson, Lamar Arrington or that great linebacker lineage that comes out of Penn State University.


It's gonna be very, very interesting to see. The third is where it starts to get interesting. Yeah. I, You know why? I think the first two picks, I think they're kind of, I'm not gonna say etched in stone, but the guy's carving, I think he's already out the seat. Well, Actually I don't think number three might be different based on who goes Number two. If Trav or a, if they go, if they go defense, you go with a two-way player. I say Travis Hunter goes number two. Yes. Then it's, it's a, it's a toss up. That's what I think. Number three, can it be Abdul Carter? Do the Giants lead another defense in? They already have Thibo Go, go, go with KV Von Thibo though. Yes. What about Shado? Because Go, they still don't have a quarterback Goes with Lawrence. The big he tackle. But here's the thing, Ocho, you really need somebody to compete in that division, right At the quarterback position.


Okay. They got Russ. Yeah. Is that enough to hold it? It's Only one year. I know They got Jamis, but that's only one year. Jayden Daniels Jalen Hertz. Yes. Dak Prescott. If you go back and look at what happened at the Raiders, right? You got Pat Mahomes, you got Bo Nicks, you got J you got, You know, Justin, her, you Justin. Yeah. And now you got Gino Smith. Right. You see the Raiders really needed, they knew they needed a quarterback because you got as a quarterback, heavy division. Right. The new the NFC East is a quarterback heavy division. Now the question is, do you wanna match fire with fire or do you want somebody to go extinguish that fire? Mm.


That's the question. Listen, A defensive player can only impact the game so much. You see what the, what do, what do Philly have defense? Oh A com. A co a Collectively though. As, as a whole. As a whole. You hear Chirps Washington try and play for go up? No, they're and play for TJ Watt. Woo. Okay. That'd be, that'd be nice. So I think I, I think it starts to get interesting at three, once we get to three and Okay. It's gonna really start to get interesting. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The top 10 is gonna be a listen to the Adam Schefter. I, I think somebody else said it. More teams are interested in moving down. Yeah. And moving up. I I think we don't have, we don't have a really exciting draft class outside of maybe the top three.


Yeah. There aren't too many players that really, that are really are trapped. What he saying? Okay. You got them, Clark. Oh, Okay. Go back, Go pack, go, go. He going number one. That's the fake travel when you going number one. Sure. And I can, he like, man, I woo, I'm nervous. But they've done a great job of holding it in Ocho. Yeah. Because you don't wanna rob him of that excitement. Right. You a let him have that moment.


Let him a, let him call a man. It's me. I'm just calling. Hey back. What you doing? What you have for lunch? What you have for breakfast today? You see Travis Hunter in the Pink Man? Is is that pink Confucius? That, That, that's, that's pink. Okay. That's pink. Pink Or Pink. I'm excited for Trav. I'm excited for Trav. Especially wherever he goes. I'm hoping the organization knows that he would love to play both, both sides of the ball. Right. I hope they grant him that grace being that's what he was able to do at Colorado. I'm excited for him. I don't know where he goes. I would like, You know what I would like, what I would like for Jerry Jones to make a splash by not talking to the media, but moving up the draft and going to get Travis Hunter at number two. I like that. Oh boy. You gotta give up so much. I think the cowboy That you might as well.


You might as well. I mean, I just, hypothetically speaking, I think it would be dope. Jerry says he has something brewing on the trade market. That's what Jerry said. Jerry says he got two, two big fish in the fryer right now. This might be it If I'm Jerry, I go try to get Tyre. Oh, that's, that's another good one. That's a good one. I like that. I like that Tyreek Tyreek and cd Tyreek and CD tip Tyreek outside CD in the slot. You got Javonte Williams at running back. He came over from the Broncos. I think they're gonna probably, they need to do something in offensive line. Zack Martin retired. The offensive line wasn't very good last year. Right. They were beat up. Terrence Steele is there.


They got the Smith kid. Yeah, but they need, they need some quality that got hit a little bit too much. Yeah. And the running game was non-existent. I don't know if they weren't very good at the running game. Right. Or they didn't put an emphasis enough on the running game. But they definitely need to improve the running game in the offensive line. Yes, sir. What you thinking? So you think they pull a switcher rule on us? I might think so. I just, I don't know. I, I don't know why I could feel it. What do y'all think? Who do you think is gonna be the first pick? Cam? Travis. You think? Travis? You think Cam? Who you got? Who You got no more?


Who you got going number one? Travis. You think so? You wanna make a bet? Let's bet 20 bucks. Let's bet 20 bucks. Me and you. I ain't gonna pay you, but let's bet. No, he don't pay. Don't bet him. Don't bet him he don't pay. He been on me think 200 for six months. Oh, come on now it's time. Hey, what? We don't normally be late. We normally, I'm, I'm on the Clark. There's three minutes. Well, I Didn't hear the commissioner. The commissioner normally comes to the podium. Welcome to the 2025 NFL draft. Right? Welcome The clock. How long the clock open? I think it's 10 minutes. Isn't it Okay. As you in my ear.


How long, what that Wanna make a bet? I You Going in cam? He's going camp. When you got Cam, look at commission on the bike. I got, Hey, look at commission on the bike. He tripping. That's the green. That's the Green Bay training camp tradition. Hold on. You got, I got Travis Hunter going first. Let's bet. Friendly ba friendly ba. Alright, Lord. Heber Commence. Probably hadn't rode a bike. Hadn't rode a bike in 20 years. 30. 40. Beg you. 40. And I got little Wayne on the bike with s Uggs. Yeah. Okay. Little Wayne on a bike with Uggs.


Ah, let's go. Come on Lou. We got, come on. What we got? Come on. Commence. Got on sneakers. That's a, that's gone. Aj No. Matthews Jr. Clay Matthews Jr. They look the same. He dug, they still booing the commission. You, man, You know that after all these years? Yes. Actually, actually they, the owners, but he had to go out there in front of them.


Remember how we talked about Nico Harrison? That's right. That's right. Father on the song for that. Yeah, most definitely. Hey, are you nervous to lose that 20? All right. Matter of fact, you don't even have to pay me after this. We, you gotta treat me to dinner. Can I? No, I wanna go to Tanner's. Okay. Alright. Bet. Can you hear, can you hear Commissioner talking? No, I can't either. No, I, I was wondering why can't we, I thought we was gonna be able to hear, Oh, we turn the TV off so we can hear.


I mean, I like to watch the games and sound, but I want to hear the pinks in real time. Say you Raven Special. Let him. Yes. No, he's a Broncos. He's a Broncos. Raven. No, no, both. Hey, you a Raven fan. Hey, why are you here? Come On, man. Oh, you a Raven fan too. Listen, You know what? I still love you, but everybody likes have flaws. That's one of yours. It's cool. Hey Ho. Hold on. Who's better? The Ravens of the Bengals, right?


Oh, now You wanna make a bet this year? Bet $20. Yes. Yes, yes. We down you in my ear. Not, not too loud. Not too loud.


That's a good one. That's a good one. I don't know if the president actually said that, but that was pretty good. He, So, so as commissioner announced that the Titans on the clock. Here we go. Here we go. Come on Raj. He can speed this up. If you just go ahead and announce the pick. Yes. Yeah. More.


Let's go. Three Titans are on the clock. Do we have any Titans fans here? Oh, you by yourself Titan fans. No, that says Vikings. Hey, Warren Moon. Warren Moon said that if Cam gift goes to the Titans, he will take the number one out of retirement and will allow him to wear it. That's dope. That's live. So here it is. Yeah. Quarterback, two defensive players. I don't know, I just have a feeling they, they gonna pull a fast one.


You think so? Also, I I can, I have a feeling. I, I don't know why, why? Lemme ask you this. Why would you take Trav when you ain't got nobody to get the ball? You don't think they'd get will ever another year? They've only, he really hasn't had a really, an actual chance. I think they would, but he keeps making the same mistakes. Right? That's that's what e that's what e bug coaches. Right? See? Okay. Wow.


Okay. All right. Yeah. Huh. All right. Listen to Adam chapter talk. He says that the Tennessee Titans was sold on Cam War, right? The giant, the Giants said we can we'll switch spots with you at three and give you next year's number four and other draft picks. So that solidifies Cam going one? Yeah. It looks like I lost the bet, sir. Hey, he on. Look at it. He got the phone up to his zero. So allow him to have that moment. Right?


I know I make, Oh, you want me to sign it? Huh? Wait, you want me to sign that one or the one I give you? Hey, you got got $2. You got $2. Somebody gotta have, Oh, Shelly, I'm betting money. I ain't even got, I'm getting your money now. Hold on. Wow. Yeah, you gotta do a better job. Wow. Woo.


Mel Kiper seems to be sold more on Shado than Cam Ward, but I don't, it's too late now. The Hayes in the barn. Cam's going number one overall, how you betting my money? He betting my money. This yours? Yeah, that's mine. I owe you $5,220. Nah, with 15% tab on it. You owe me more than that.


The forties and Free Agents podcast with Daniel, Jeremiah and Greg Rosenthal has prepared you for the 2025 NFL draft. We've Told you what last year's playoff teams need to return to the postseason And how teams with new coaches should approach the draft. So As draft season comes to a close, we've got you covered before your favorite team goes on the clock. We'll break it all down. Once all 257 picks have been made, Listen to the forties and free agents podcast on the iHeartRadio app, apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts.


Boy Mel is really sold on Shado. I think the one thing of watching him Ocho Huh? He gotta do a better job of getting the ball out. He takes, he takes a lot of sacks. All the, a lot of times the quarterback gets sacks. People automatically think it's the offensive line. Right. Sometimes you gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to hold him. Sometimes. Don't get your team in second and long, third long. Right. Sometimes don't take your team out of field goal range. Right. Get the ball out. It's okay to live, to see another day, but be smart. Yes. You know, if you're in field goal range, don't take a sack. Yeah. Throw it out. Throw it out a bound. Right. If you, You know, you second and short, don't meet third long. Just don't do anything stupid. He does a great job of protecting the ball, but sometimes I think he's too conscious, too long. You, you, you gotta have some risk in order to be successful in the league.


I think, I think he gonna be okay. I don't like what the media and the pundits have done to him. Yeah. Yeah. They beat him up. Yeah. They, They're beating him up really bad based on him being confident. That's one of the few things that you do need to play at the highest level is you gotta have belief. You gotta be confident in your skills and what you're able to do. Yes. Coming out and saying if you want a franchise changing quarterback, you come and get me. There's nothing wrong with that. Right. There's nothing wrong with that at all. What was he supposed to say? If you wanna franchise, change your quarterback. Don't come get me. Don't draft me. Right. If you wanna win your division, you wanna go to the playoffs, don't take me. Right. Of course. That's what he's supposed to say. I do like Cam, he do have great escap ability. He does. Look, I think we all can agree that Cam is a better athlete than Shadur. Yeah. But that doesn't mean Shado can't play in the NFL.


Right. Peyton Manny wasn't the greatest athlete. I'm not saying Shado is gonna be that. I'm not saying he's gonna be Tom Brady, drew Breeze Rivers, but there's room for guys that are not athletic, as athletic as say Lamar Jackson or a who, the guy in Buffalo. Josh Child. Right. Just because they're supremely athletic. Yes. That doesn't mean a guy that's not as athletic can't get the job done. Right. But then there are other attributes. The fact that he's not as athletic. There are other things to his game that he much better at. He's his precision. Yes. His accuracy, his ability to process very fast outside of holding the ball too long. Sometimes waiting on things to develop. Sometimes it's what a quarterback, what you can't see with a quarterback that makes him great.


Right. Because you look at Tom Brady, he didn't have anything. No big arm. He could not, he did, couldn't run very fast. He didn't have the the muscular body. But what he had here. Yeah. What he had here. Yeah. Replaced everything Else. Replaced everything else. And so sometimes it's the intangibles as opposed to the tangibles. Right. How much time on the clock We got pick is the pick is in Picks in, picks in. Well, we're about to find out. Picks in got, I Want my 20 bucks. Travis Hunter. No.


Yeah. I, I, look, I didn't see anybody else put the phone up to the Arrow Joe. I didn't see T Tram put the phone up to his ear. Yeah. I didn't see Abdul Carter to put the phone up to his ear. Wait, that might, that might have been a trick though. That might have been a trick. Man. Who playing on the phone? Here? He come Now what? The Tennessee Titan select from the University of Miami.


Okay. Okay. You're right. You're right. Good pick. I damn it. Yeah. Guys, I don't think there was much a surprise here. When they turned down all the visits and workouts, they zeroed in on that guy, Joe. Oh, Joe. It's, You know what it's like. Yes. It's like, You know the kinda car you want. Right. Why do you gonna go test drive and waste them people Time test driving something that You know you are, you're not Gonna buy you. Right. You right about it. You got your mind made up. Yeah. Whether it's a, a Ferrari, a Lambo, a G Wagon, or a colory, whatever the case may be. Right. When you have your mind set, don't go waste them.


People time about, let me test drive this. Let me test drive that. Yeah. Oh, we got a trailer or Joe, Wait, what are we, what are we? LeBron, Jayden, the Cowboys. I guarantee you Jacksonville. No, they going to get, They going to get, they're going to tryout. They're gonna get trap. Wait, Travis, what if they shock you and they get asked Abdul Carter? No, No, no. Anthony Genty. Yeah. Gen No. No. Ooh. Ah. I don't know O Joe. Hold on. You going, you going to get a, a running back? Okay. Listen, I just heard about Jacksonville. I just heard about Jacksonville always wanting to ask from They I heard about Fixed. Right.


See, Wow. Wow. Hey, I thought we'd get interested at once we got past three, three. Oh, the draft started at two. Yeah. That changes up everything now though. It does changes Up everything. Lemme tell you where it changes up at. Who goes to, that's what changes right now, if they take Genty, Wait, they, they got, they got ETN. Right. That's what I'm saying. That's why I think it makes sense for me to take Travis Hunter. Right. Because you can play him on offense and defense. Now you get a package together. Right. Hey, he plays as many snaps as he can handle on defense.


And you got a nice little package for him on offense. I, I like it if Travis Hunter is the pick. Right. I think if J Z's the pick also, I look at, I look at Philly, I look at what Sequan was able to do for the Philadelphia Eagles and I see Aston jy in that same light, being able to run the ball, being able to be a three down back. He can pass the tech and catch the ball out the backfield. He can do some of those things. I'm not sure. I don't know what they're gonna do with the number two pick Travis Hunter. It, it is nice. But I, I would've much preferred him somewhere else in the bigger market. New York. I would've loved him in New York. And obviously in Cleveland, opposite side of Denzel Ward. And obviously doing some stuff on offense With of officer to Judy. Yeah.


But I mean, where do y'all think Jackson? Where is Jacksonville going with the number two pick now? I think Carter, Travis Hunter. I think Travis too. Where's he going? Number two. Pick Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis Travis. I think so. Too old Joe. This it, it makes, it makes sense because how were you gonna get him? Yeah. Gotta go up. Got Got there too. He wasn't gonna be there. Nope. Wasn't gonna be there. Nope. Nope. Because then there's a possibility. Shoot, somebody shoot up past three and taken. Yeah. Two, two. The make a train with the Giants to take it. I think it's gonna be Travis Hunter.


I'm not surp. I'm not surprised. I'm surprised. Like I said, I won't be surprised if it's Travis Hunter. Right. I'm gonna be shocked if it's Ashton Genty Ain't, ain't no, ain't no telling. Ain't no telling. I mean, number two to Oto a running back back. Yeah. Qua running. He went five. He went two. Two. He did. He went behind Baker Mayfield. That's right. So why you think he wouldn't be the one to go to? He j I'm not saying whole thing. I mean, he's not as special. I'm not saying he. Yeah. Okay. Okay. People are telling us it's gonna be Travis Hunter. I like, I like it. I like It. We got, we got a spy in the green room.


Travis Hunter has been on the phone with Travis Hunter, DUV, Duvall County. They get, they get the second Oh oh, Joe. Huh? The Browns get the fifth overall pick the 20 20, 25 second and fourth round picks and next year's number one. That's, that's nice. That's a hall, that's a, that's nice Joe, To move up three spots. Yeah. Look at what they gave up to move up three spots. If you thought the, the Cowboy was gonna move up 10 spots, then they had to give up at T Stadium. That's dope. Travis Hunter, Duval County, Ocho.


That's almost as big a deal as what the 49 ERs gave up to get Trey, Trey, Lance. Yeah. That is Trey Lance went from here. That didn't work out so well. No, I'm, Hey. But look, Travis is proven. Travis did it at Jackson State and they said, yeah, but if you were at a bigger school, you couldn't do that. He goes to a Power four and he did it on both sides of the ball at a very high level. He was the Heisman Trophy winner. He was the Nikko Award winner. He was the Gersky Award winner. So there's no question about the ability, the question the people have is, can he play at the level he played at in college on both sides of the ball? Yeah. I, I Think you can, like we already talked about, I prefer the see him at Receiver or a db.


Maybe them have some, have some packages to form Right. At Receiver as a db. One thing about it, I know all games are gonna sell out. Yeah, I know. It's gonna have the number one sale in Jersey this year. Yeah. Yeah. Val County got you a good one. They got you a good one in Jacksonville. I Like it. I like this pick. That's Dope. I like this pick. I I I'm really liking this pick to the Jags. Jags knew the guy that they wanted Ojo. Yes sir. They knew the guy that they wanted. Okay. We're gonna have to give up a King's ran and to get 'em. Got to. And sometimes when you want a house in that subdivision, in that cul-de-sac. Yeah. They got great, great schools in that, in that district. Yes. Everything is in close proximity. You gotta pay a little bit of, you have to pay a little extra.


It's all about location. And you Have no problem playing extra for that nice location because You know what you get long term. Yes. You know what you get long term. So you gotta thank resale. I'm gonna be able to recoup my money and Travis Hunter easily. People are gonna look, he's from Georgia. This is a short ride from Atlanta to Jacksonville. I like, I like this pick now. They gave up a lot to get him. Mocho. It was worth it. They gave up a lot to get him worth it. Oh, I, oh, absolutely worth it. Ash, how much time we got? Pick his head coach, commissioner's walking back to the, is that, Can you He, he was at San Francisco two years ago.


What's his name? The DDD lineman. Oh, I don't, I don't know D lineman Well as well. Who's that? What's his name? He was at Francisco Dead. Okay. Ball. Lil Du Ball actually gonna lose his mind. Oh Yeah. Absolutely.


Wow. I don't think anybody saw this pick coming though, Joe. I don't think anybody saw this trade. Not the trade, but pick Yes. I knew he was going to. Yes. He had to be going to. Yes. I just didn't know anybody would jump up to go get him like this Promise Trav. Yeah, Travis Hunter. Oh, that's live.


That's live Wide receiver. Defensive back. And he got his dad in attendance. His dad was able to get permission Ocho to come see his son. There you go. Tram. Show up. Show out. That's loud. That's Great. The thing is ojo what these young men, hopefully your journey starts all over again. Yeah, most definitely. There was a journey to get to this point. Now your journey starts all over again. Because your journey wasn't just to get here. Yeah. It was to thrive Here. Yeah. Most definitely. Listen, as a youngster, I remember, I remember those days obviously I wasn't able to go to the draft, but just getting drafted and just thinking about all the obstacles I had to, I had to go to the draft, the military.


I, I was getting ready to head, I was getting ready to head down to the Air Force. Yeah. Recruiting center. Hey, this is dope. This is great for Travis. It's great for, and a tryout, the Jaguars organization. That's a, that's the dope feeling. I, Hey, do All, Hey, there been skilled guys coming. That came. Them skilled guys can't lift commissioner up. Like them old line Uhuh. This is unbelievable. This is unbelievable right here.


Sorry. Yeah. I like it. I like it. I don't We got the, we got the Giants at three. Yeah. It's gonna be Carter, you think so? Yeah. Pair with Thito. Paired with Lawrence. But then what, what's your, what's your answer long term at the quarterback position? If you do go with Thibo Though. Well, they say they got ru they believe Russ can sustain them for a year. They got Jamis. So the thing is, they, they want be able to attack Jalen Hurt. Right. They wanna be able to attack Jane Daniels. Right. They wanna be able to attack Dak Prescott. So with that in mind, look, you got two edge rushers and you got one of the Premier D tackles. Right. And all the football collapsing the pocket on the inside.


I like to pick, I like to pick because if I'm taking a quarterback at 3 0 2, I got to loving, I gotta 11. Yeah, you, But look, also in that division, you gotta have a quarterback to be able to score some points. You go defense. Let's say you do go at Abdul Carter here. Yeah. Okay. You, you're able to stop all the, all the, the teams that are able to score at will in your division. Right. But how you gonna put up points? Well, how you gonna put up Points? They say they got Malik neighbors. They believe Russ can get him the ball. They believe they can probably get a, they can get a, who knows. They, they could trade back in and get one of these receivers. But they, I think they believe ocho, they can get a great pick in the second round. Do you believe they can, do you believe they can get a day two pick a a day two wide receiver?


That's quality A Absolutely. There's some jams. There's some jams that aren't out there that aren't talked about enough that might be able to come out based on the system that they do run. Correct? Yeah. The first two picks. I'm not, I'm not surprised at all. No, I mean, you get the, you get the premier, you get the premier cornerback draft, you get a top three receiver in the draft draft, you get the best athlete in the draft draft. Yeah. Most definitely. I'm not, I'm not surprised at all.


Oh, Trav, look at it. They got two ball Florida. Oh, in the cap. That, that, that's dope. That like, that Giants pick in Giant Picker in Giants pickers in our spot. What we got in the green room saying going to be Abdul, What we got, who we got, who you got at number three? Abdul Carter. Abdul Carter. Abdul Carter. They going to attack. They Attack. I say maybe, maybe Shado, I don't know. No, I think the thing is they want, they want attack the quarterback. Right. They wanna attack the quarterback. Get two edge rushes. Because think about what, what the Philly, what the Philly got, they got Jalen Sy inside.


Yeah. And they got them Edge rushes on the edge. Yeah. Now they, they lost. They lost, You know what, who is it? Sweat Was the sweat. Yeah. And they had the, I forgot young dude. Young Bull. Yeah. Three. Which number he ended up with? He went to New England. Okay. But they still, but they still, they still got see Deon Sand. The last players with eight plus starts on offense and defense. And that was what, 95? Yeah, that was long. 9, 6 96. Long, long, Long time ago. Yeah. Very long. But you have to understand though, Ocho that was, that was time.


Seventh or eighth season. Right. That wasn't this rookie season. Defenses are a little bit more complex. Offenses are a little bit more complex. Right. But he, he told you before you He Oh, they're gonna allow no Jacksonville is going, going to allow it. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. They're gonna allow it. Yeah. The pick is in Pick is in Giants Shado Sanders. And You wanna make a bet how much you got to lose The man hugging his mom and dad on the TV up there? Oh, for real? Yeah. Hey, you cheating? You looking at the tv? Yeah, I told you.


I spy. I spy. There you go. Okay. Abdul Carter. Yeah. Even, even Pops got on chain. Look at Park Lane. There you go, pops. Oh, that's live. Abdul Carter to the Giants. Look, he, he a unanimous All American. Yeah. The one thing that the guy a for the most part, you look at LA Bar guys that wear that number 11, 11 special. Yeah. It is special. Special. They special. Abdul Carter is special.


He can, he, he can transfer speed to power. He can bend the edge. Yeah. He, Hey, I got, I got no problem with this pick and on that turf. He's gonna be dynamic. He's gonna be electric. I mean, I, I, I like it. But still, I'm, I'm thinking about in order to compete in that, especially in that division, you need somebody at the quarterback. There's nothing wrong with Russ. Right there. No disrespect to Ross and no disrespect to Jamis as well, but to compete in that division, you need a transcending talent. Someone has set you ahead of schedule by a decade. Okay. I don't see, I like Shado. I don't understand. I don't know what the scouts seeing. I don't know the GMs are looking at, but I've seen, I've saw him through that Jackson State.


Yeah. Come. Got it. Come What you got? Hey. Special Handshake. Yeah. They had a special handshake. Oh, they practiced that. Yeah, they did. Absolutely. They practiced that. I think everybody's happy with the first three picks. O Joe. I think every fan base is really happy with those picks. Can you Can't Go wrong. You can't for the first five. You really can't go wrong At four. I think the Patriots at four, everybody had them pegged in to take offensive lineman. The big offensive lineman on LSU. Yeah. Will Campbell. Yeah. Our spies tell us that. Will Campbell is on the phone with somebody. I don't think, I don't think it's as Ooh, his, his accountant.


But that is, that's a, that's a great pick, man. That's a great pick. Look at this. The great time at, hey. Ooh. That's how you do it. You unload. Look at this. Hey, run it back. You better step up. You better step up. Oh, let get that Great tip. Dropping coverage. He doing everything but this. Look at this. Be spying. Spy spy py. Look At this. Look at this. Closing speed. Gimme that. Yeah, But this is where he excels at right here, ocho. Yeah. Look at this. Look at this side. From one side of the field to the other side of the field. A TFL tackle for loss. But look at this.


Look at this deal. Boot. That's Barfield special, bro. Where you going? Did low and rip. Yeah. Yeah. He's special. He can be in He nice. That's a good pick. Now I, I I can't, I can't complain. I can't complain. I, I like it Ocho because everybody else in that division, with the exception of the Cowboys, have an outstanding defense. At least they were last year. We saw what Philly did it. Look, we don't know what's gonna happen with the, the commanders. It's, You know, it's being reported that they're in the running with Patt j Watt, his bur Steelers might wanna move, try to move up. Right. But I like this pig for them. I do. I agree with you. Now, don't get me wrong, I agree with you with the quarterback situation.


But for them to go defensive player instead of a quarterback tells me I'm not sold on Shado. Right. I'm not sold on Jackson Dart. And when you take up a guy that you gotta be sold on Joe. Yeah. Matter of fact, yeah. Like when you pay, when you pay a million plus for a home, you better be sold. Yeah. Everything should be ready for you to move in and just set up shop. Yeah. That's it. And he's, he's that type of player. He's a plug and play. There's no question. Day one, he started day one. Day one. Yeah. Day one. He started


The forties. And Free Agents podcast with Daniel, Jeremiah and Greg Rosenthal has prepared you for the 2025 NFL draft. We've told you what last year's playoff teams need to return to the postseason And how teams with new coaches should approach the draft. So as draft season comes to a close, we've got you covered before your favorite team goes on the clock. We'll break it all down. Once all 257 picks have been made, Listen to the forties and Free Agents podcast on the iHeartRadio app, apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.


Oh, the package. Tj, I think, I think a, I think a lot of teams won. Tj You're talking about one of two or three best rushers in the, in the NFL. But the New England Patriot are on the clock. Night four now. They went, they, they, they made a splash. They spent a lot of money in the off season field. Yeah. They spent a lot of money. Yeah. They got their quarterback, they got their head coach. Yes. I like Gonzales at Corner. They went and got a D Tackle played premium. Yeah. They brought step in. Yep. They brought Stef. Right. Stefan Digs is in. I'm not, we gotta protect our quarterback. We got, Hey, if you got a bunch of money, somebody gotta go provide security over.


Yes sir. I think, I think it's gonna be the offensive tackle from a, from A-L-S-U-L-S-U will. How, how, how, what, what's Will Campbell? Will Campbell and the only, the only knock Playing about him having short arms. I don't, I think that Really has nothing to do with it. Being able to play the, did his, did his arm shrink when he was in, after he got outta college? Yeah. He kept pancaking everybody. Exactly. That's what I don't understand. A guy performed very well in college and then you find fault with him. Yeah. Like, oh, he got short arms. Oh his feet. Right. But he did something so to make you even consider him. Right. You know what that is? I think Ocho I think a lot of times they like, they try to find what's wrong with you as opposed to what's Right.


Right. What? Yeah, but I get it. Hey, I gotta kick the tires. I gotta do a, I gotta do a full inspection of what's going on with you. Right. Because I'm investing a lot of money in you. These, these first three, four players, five players. Yeah. They getting fully guaranteed contracts don't you? Fully, fully. So Will Campbell. Yeah. I don't, I don't think anybody's surprised with that, considering the moves that they made in the off season. Huh. Stephan Diggs and Wide receiver, they got, went to a, got a big defensive tackle from the Eagles, paid a premium for him. They got Gonzalez at corner. I'm not surprised. Right. Let's protect a quarterback. Let's protect.


I like it. Yeah. I don't now I think the four, the four, the top four picks. I think the only order, I don't, I don't think there's really any surprise. I thought Cam would go, number one, if Cleveland has stayed at two, I believe they're gonna take your door. The Giants was always gonna take Abdul Carter. Yes sir. If he was available. Right As we started getting closer to the draft, we started ta hearing about Will Campbell to the Patriot. Right now with the fifth pick. Because Jacksonville traded with Cleveland. Right. Where does Cleveland go now? Well, Nick ch Nick Chubb is not there.


Right? Right. Nick Chubb is gone. What about, what about Shado? I like it. Ah, I like it. Ah. Now it's a toss up though. Can it be Shado? Can you find, can you go to, you go to the running back position. Ashton five is just a high for a running back. But I look, I get the resurgence right. Because you saw what Sanon did. You saw what Derrick Henry did. Right. You saw what Josh Jacobs did. You saw, You know, you saw Jamir Gibbs. Yeah. Joe Mixon. There are a lot of guys that have success. Yes. And the running back all of a sudden now is in both Yes. Certain running backs. And isn't the type of running back that you don't wanna pass up that you can take at the fifth pick because he can do so much for you. Yeah. The second most rushed yards in college history.


Yes. 26 over 2,600 yards. Finish about 25, 28, 27 yards behind what Barry did. Right. It's a little high for me, but if you believe he's the guy, you take it. Yeah. You take it. I like it. But I think we're all in the grid. Is that Will Will Campbell is gonna be the fourth pick of the draft from New England Commission. Walking to the commission. Walking to the podium. Now speed the TV up. Well, this was on the delay. That was, it was Will Campbell. Will Campbell. Okay. That's Will Will Campbell.


Genti Ur How You know. Hey, I, what did that say to the Greenwood? What we got do? We got? Hey Mason Graham. Huh? Oh, the Dacker from Michigan. Be nice. Be nice. Okay. We got a guest coming. We got a guest joining us out here in about five minutes. The human joystick. Dante Hall, the great returner from Kansas City Punt and kick returner. Tremendous slot receiver. 6 5 3 19. His arms are short.


You can see that. But look at it. Let's see. But look how he plays. Great ball kick Step. Great. Ah. Ah. Doesn't overextend. Ooh. Okay. Wow. I like that. Okay, kick. Let's see, let's see what he got on Joe. Let Oh, pass it off. Oh, I like that. You going. I like that. Drop your look at him. Sit down. Good. Anchor down. Look at him. Sit down on this. Oh no. Oh my goodness. I love it. Okay, let's see. Let's see how he snapped this off. O Joe. Woo. Oh, up. Oh yes. Look, that's I love. Oh yeah. Look at him. Cline.


He nice. Look at this. I like his base. Powerful hands in. But they complaining about his arms being Too short. Strong. He's strong. Hey, look at that. You see how he's strong with that outside hand? Yes sir. Because he knows I can't let you swim back inside. If you run around this block, you're not gonna be able to get that. 'cause it's an inside run. He's strong with this. Look at this. Get his feet inside. Keep driving. Oh, oh Pancake. Hey, that's a full stack of pancakes right there. And I like the soup. I like that. I like, hey, I like the green with the chalk. Sprite. Clean. There you go. Will. There you go. Clean. I like the cash. Look. Hey, I like the sneakers.


He won me over. I like this. I like, I like this. I guess everybody getting away from lifting the commissioner up. They was, had a great run. It's coming. You think it's coming back? It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. Will Campbell. I see you got the Pepsi on. I like his pickle, Joe. It's a good one. Look, you got Drake May. Drake May is your money. You need something to protect your money. You need security. You Gotta protect your money. You gotta protect your Every time. So I like, I like this pick. Yep. Look at Braves.


Look, I think the Patriots look, we might not agree that the coach didn't have enough time. Right. But look, Vrabel was not gonna be available next year. No. So you had to make a move. Gotta make a move. And plus, hey male guy, he got four more years on that contract. Hey, I ain't, I ain't looking for a job. Good. Yeah. That's, that's gonna make very interesting for the AFC East to see if the, the Patriots can get back to competing at a high level the way they used to. Now I don't, I don't, I'm not sure how far Off they are from competing or competing against the Bills.


Bills. Yeah. Well this is the start. Yeah. You gotta crawl. Listen, you gotta crawl before you walk. How much better in year two, what Drake may be than year one? Because Josh Shell is MVP. Yeah. So we know he's clear with the crop. Yeah. He's top. He's, he's tier one. Okay. Tua, can he stay healthy? Yes. That's, that is probably the most important question. Can Tua stay healthy? And then the Jets. The Jets got Justin Fields. Wait, the pick is in already. Brown's pick is in what we got Howard, big boy D Tiger from Michigan.


Michigan. Yeah. I'm not, I'm, I thought Shado might sneak in here at five Right now it's about to get interested. Hold on the Raiders at six, right? Yeah. Okay. So, so I was right. I was righted. I like, I, You know, love, I really like this pick because You know they got some, they got, they got good running backs.


Not great in New England. Right. They got good. But I think the main thing is you want protection for Drake May, that's the guy. Right. You gotta protect him and allow him to throw the ball down to feed. Yeah. Because if you can, especially in today's game, which is pass oriented, everything's about throwing the ball. Yes. You gotta be able to protect him. You gotta be able to protect. I like the Stefan digs. I like that. At our signing. We'll see how close right he is week one. Got it. It might, he still, You know, they might put him on the puck and he has to work. The pick is in, right? Yeah. What we got, what we got on Joe? Nathan Graham. Yeah. They going, they going Big boy, big boy from Michigan.


Wow. He a hell of a player man. He, he's good. He's good. Really good. Well, pairing him with Miles. Garrett being a instructor up in the middle, being able to stop obviously. And d Disrupt obviously some of those teams in a FC. Yep. And, and then the Ravens. Yeah. I think Bengals. Yeah. I like the fact that Miles gar can get to the quarterback. But I like the fact that I got a big guy inside to start getting Henry up the middle. That's, that's a good one. 6 3, 2, 9, 5. He, he plays with great pad leverage.


Yeah. I mean he has tremendous. Look at, oh, arm Over move. Wait, move Man. Hey, he, he twitchy now. Yeah. Look at this. He plays with Great Pad Liberty. Look at this press. Oh, oh. Snatch swim. I got you. Let me get that. Hey, You see that? Hey. Oh Joe, you see that? Yeah. That Forward. That was nice. That was nice. Oh, get on the edge. Get the sound tackle for a loss. Woo. Okay. He, he Different now. He's in the Threet now He's in that co. Oh, snatch bull. Yeah. Snatch bull again. A little bit. Come look at this bull. Ooh.


Straight bull power. I, he, they show three different cutups. YI seen three different moves, fool. That Bull. I see the snatch rip and I see the straight bull. He got, He he, he got, now he got a nice little bag on him. Now he does. He got a nice little bag on him. And to see the thing is why I like defensive tackles like this because they're closer to the quarterback than the Edge Russian. Yeah. So he, Hey, he's two yards away from the quarterback. Right. Quarterback's gotta be the guards gotta be really special to deal with him. Yeah. Because he gotta Aren. Donna had a bag like that. He, he is not Aren Donald. No, no, he, he. But I'm just saying I saw three snaps. I saw three Cutups at yo and I saw three different moves. Mm. But also what we saw, obviously in college, he was one-on-one most of the time.


Yes. Most of the time With him being that boy. He gonna get some one. Gonna get double team down. Hold On. You gonna double him or you gonna double miles? Gary, That's, that's, that's a good one. That's a good one. Genty to the Raiders. How You know I got a little, it got a little, we got a little birdie in the, the green room. It's Mason Graham. He got what you call the man he got I like him. I like this pick Joe. Yeah. A lot. I like his pick. I mean watch watching him on that cut on those Cutups.


When you watch film, you always wanna stand out. Yes, yes. And when you watch film and see these pics that are going high, you understand why they went high. Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't think any anybody's surprised this pick about now once we get past Genty. Right. Because there've been a lot of talk over the last say three to four days. Right. About Genty going to the Raiders. Yeah. So him going to the Raiders. I don't think that's gonna shock a whole lot of people. Brady wants to protect Gino wide receiver. Who? Who, who? Look they got Rock Bowers. They got one, two or three Best Tighties in all the football.


Right. But you need somebody on the outside on Joe to take some pressure off it. I Like, like I like Brother McMillan from from Arizona State. He ain't gonna be there when you, 'cause you got only one pick you going, if you take Genty, you're not gonna be able to get McMillan. I don't think he's sliding outta the first round. Nah, He nice. Big target. How much time we got on the clock Ash? We got five minutes still. Look, I don't, I think it's gonna be Genty. I heard a lot. I mean over the last, the last four or five days, there's been a lot of talk about Genty. They got a quarterback. They extended Gino. I like Brock by in the tight end position. They need a running back. They saw, they lost Josh Jacobs.


He came here and they decided the type of saw, the type of season that he had. I think it's gonna be a running back. Yeah. And look, it's a copycat league. Look up. Basically all the teams that had an outstanding running back. Right. They win the playoffs Did good Will Aston. It's live. Every team. Also, think about it, your top, your top four, five running back. Right? Saquon won the Super Bowl. Derrick Henry in the playoffs. Right. Joe Mixon in the playoffs. Playoffs. Josh Jacobs in the playoffs. Right? Jamir Gibbs in the playoffs. Copy Camp League. Hey, let's go get a running back. Yeah. And also when I think about it, what the Raiders are doing also, I don't see any premier receivers on their team.


No. The what can we do? How can we help G, how can we help Gino Smith give you a running back like this? It takes him the pressure off of you for the lack of production that we're gonna get on the outside. I like It. I like this pick. But boy A, they gotta get some receivers now. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if there's any receivers left on the, on the fridge of market Oto, but maybe I'm going heavy. Yeah. Second, third round. I'm going receiver. You gotta get some in there for Gino to throw to it. You got, I agree. Woo. You can run with power. Got great speech, tremendous balance.


Nice stiff arm, great vision. Run through contact. I like it. I like his style though Joe. He standing straight up. And the funny thing, some people, some people, some people were talking about, You know, the level of competition that he plays against, it's not high, but when it came time to play in some of the big schools he Played against and he went for almost 200 on over. Did the same. Did the same thing regardless to the competition he played against. Yeah. I think the thing is Ocho look, he's gonna have better teammates around him. Oh yeah. Oh definitely. Than what he had at Boise State.


And that's not the discount Boise State. But You know Brock Bowers is better than the tight end that he had. The wire, the, the quarterback. Gino is better than the quarterback he had. Right. So he has better players around him. I think he'll do a lot better. But obviously the defense he's going against is gonna be a lot better than the defense. A lot faster. I like it. I like this. Pick. Very good. Pick Who's on the clock at seven as you gonna clock? Jets. Oh, jets. Wait, They already got Justin Fields. We got Justin Fields. I only got it for two years. What you taking if you the Jets. What you taking Got Gary Wilson. Gary. Gary Wilson.


Oh my goodness. Is there a tight end? You got Tyler Warren rated that high. He does this. Oh, for tightness from state. He nice. That'd be a, that That'd Be a nice addition. You like Tyler Warren? I do like him. I don't know. I don't know if the jets like him at six. That's too high, huh? Yeah, I think somewhere. I think somewhere in the teens, right? Huh? Who? Who we got? Who? Who's going? Seven. No, seventh. I mean, Jeff's got the seventh pick. What? Genty.


GenY got great balance. He got better speed than you think. Don't Joe? Yeah, he about the same height as Emmett. I Think you might be a little faster than Emmett. You think so? Emmett? Yeah, but Emmett had tremendous balance. Look at Emmett Emmett. You can put the ball in one head. That's fast. You can go, bro. Yeah,
