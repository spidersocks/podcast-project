Thank you guys that came out on the tour and purchased merch. And. we thank you guys that go to the site and purchase merch. We greatly appreciate that. Your support Ocho the game that, huh? It it was football. Listen, it wasn't a whole lot. It was, it left a lot to be desired. The Cowboys beat division rival Giants 20 to 15. The, the Cowboys improved the two and two while the Giants fall to one and three again, the Cowboys win 20 to 15, Dak 22 or 27, 2 21, 2 touchdowns, zero interceptions. They ran the ball. They had 80 yards on. 23 carries. So there's nothing to write home about ocho. Let's not get over excited. The giants, Daniel Jones was 29 or 42 81.


He had interception at the end of the ball game. Didn't really matter. Yeah. They had 24 temps for 26 yards. Or Joe. Hey, but don't you, when I look at this game, yeah, there are like three throws that if, if that's other, another quarterback, the giants probably win this game. Oh, the one that he had neighbors, neighbors ran a tremendous route, had digs beat and he was behind hook. Yeah. And he hung the ball up. They knock it down. He had Slaton on the gold ball on the right. Yes. Against the, against the Under. And, and Ocho you remember they had a d they had a end. And, and, and people were like, well, he should have caught the ball. But I'm not getting into it with people that never caught the ball for a living.


Right. So you and I about to have a conversation. Yes, sir. Like when I put my foot in the dirt and I'm driving directly back to the quarterback. Right. I'm expecting the ball to be here. Yeah. Or if it's low, I can get my body on top of It and scooping. Yeah. If he throws it outside of my body, if it's high, I'm expecting the ball to be right between my numbers or my eyes. I can catch it like this. If it's high and outside, I can do that. When he throws it lowering outside, now I got to, I got to die for it. Yeah. Yeah. If the ball doesn't hit my hand, it's probably gonna hit here. And if it hits any part of this, it's gone. It's gone. It's, it's gonna get away from you every time. And that's what I'm trying to explain. Yes. And if he gets pressure, I could understand if Daniel Jones had pressure.


Right. But he had no pressure on that. He has to step and deliver the ball is two or three throws in this game that got away from him. Yeah. That's the difference. Because they're not good enough right now, Ocho to overcome those types of mistakes. Those kind of miscues, if you like, you know, you Kansas City, you one of these better teams. You could overcome something like that. But as you go along and you play better teams, even then you won't, you won't be able to overcome it. But people don't understand. People think well hit his hands, bro, stop it. Is it, stop it. It's just not, I know y'all done heard and everybody said, if it hit your hands, you should catch it. Well, if you didn't catch balls for a living, and a lot of people that talk about it didn't catch balls for a living Balls.


Okay, stop. Stop. Yeah. Hey, listen, it's, it's a very difficult catch for those of, for those of you that, that don't know to have an errand throw like that when you're trying to drive back to, to the quarterback and he throws it Yes. Away from where you're going to and you have to adjust your body. It's, it's a very, very difficult catch. Listen, there are some because It's lowering outside ocho Yeah. And There now, now there are some receivers who can probably make it, that are natural pass catches of the ball. Natural pass catchers can probably adjust and make that catch. But for most, most of the receiver in the league, it's a very, very difficult catch. Again, unc like you said, you're not gonna win games like this. If, I think if the Cowboys, the Cowboys didn't look that good tonight. I think they look, they played decent.


And if it was any other team outside of the Giants, they get beat five, five of the field goals. At least two of those, or maybe three of those might've been touchdowns and the game would've been different. Yeah, I agree. The game would've, the game would've been different and another team would've won. But the giants, listen, Daniel Jones has to make some of those, some of those throws. The one in Malik neighbors should have been six. The one that Slaton should have easily been six easy if he hadn't underthrown it. Those, those, those were layups. And. if you, if we can get, You can't miss 'em. If We can get some consistency at the quarterback position in New York with the weapons he got, they will be fine.


But right now, you know, the, the the, the quarterback is costing him a little bit. They get, getting him value. They Cost him a lot of bit. Would you say He cost him a lot of bit? Yeah. Because Ocho the thing is they're not good enough to overcome that. Yeah. See, the thing is, when you, when you are challenged offensively, you have to, I've been in a situation, I played on the 2000 Ravens. Yeah. We were challenged offensively. But what we did when we got you in the right defense, yeah. We had, you were in the wrong defense. We had the right play call. We punished you. We had to because we couldn't miss throws. Right. Because we weren't that good to, oh, we weren't the ni we weren't the, the the the 98 Minnesota where they had Chris card and Randy Moss and all those guys.


We weren't the Patriots. And, and and what, what was that? Oh seven. Yeah. We weren't the Broncos in 2013. We weren't that. Right. So you have to understand who and what you are and when the opportunity presents itself, I just remember like, look, anytime somebody made a mistake, we had to make them pay. Right. And if we made a mistake, Brian used to always look, if we make a mistake, let's just make sure we hold onto the ball. If somebody will block quarterback and you get hit flush, just hold onto the ball. Right. Running back. If somebody, if, if somebody gets whiffs, just make sure you hold onto the ball. Now, on the flip side, Ocho, we catch you in the wrong defense. And, we got the right play call. Right. We've gotta hit our head on the goal ball every time because I, because we're not gonna get that many opportunities and we're not gonna go out there and score 30 points in a game.


It's gonna be a nip tuck ball game. We make one or two plays. Right. And we're gonna turn it over to our defense. That is the way the giants are, the giants are not good enough offensively they can't run the ball well enough. Yeah. Their quarterback is not consistent enough. Isn't enough. Malik Rs is, is is gonna look fantastic. Yeah. I like Wonell Robinson slate. Slaton is what he is. So, but I, I think, I think he's he's good enough, but the quarterback position is not. Yeah. I You can't miss those throws. They're too routine. They're too routine Yeah. For you to miss and you're not good enough to overcome them. Yeah. And and also the rest need to get out the way.


Huh. That, that first half Bo was more Oh, that Wasn't no face mask. They caught face masks on the wrong damn guy. Man, listen, they had, they, they threw more yellow flags. Boy, more yellow flags than Big Bird guy, fellas. You hear me? The rest were all in the way of the game in the first half. I didn't, I didn't know what in the world was going on. But other than that, listen, it was, it was, it was a snoozefest. No disrespect And. if you look at the Cowboys schedule, I think the Cowboy's next three games, like they're gonna have to play better than they did tonight. I know they won the game. Oh yeah. It feels good to be at 500 going into week four. That is, that's, that's, that's a good thing. It's a positive thing, you know, to be above 500 or at 500 for that matter.


But it's not gonna get any easier. It's not gonna get any easier. No, no. I I just think the thing is, is that when you, when you are in a situation like the giant ocho when you're challenged defensively Yeah. I I don't think their defense are world beaters, but they'll play, they play well enough. You know, I I I love Thibo, I love Lawrence. Brian Burn Brian Think those solid players, the secondary Boy ain't gotta get a Dory back. A Dory, a Dory, a Dory's hurt right now. And they got some other pieces that that, that are out right now, as far as the secondary is concerned, once they get them boys back, I think they solid, you know, they, they not the best deepest in the, in in the league, but they can play some goddamn good ball.


Especially with that front. You know, they got up there with Dexter, Lawrence and, and Brian Burns and, and Yeah. Yeah. Burns. Yeah. They can's the quarterback, you got two edge rushers. Lawrence can collapse the pocket from the inside. They, they, they, they, they're decent. I think their, their front four is the strength of their defense. Yeah. I think that's, that's where they're gonna, you know, make their hay. That's where they're gonna, that's where they're gonna be like, okay guys, we we've got to win up front in order for us to have a chance at the set, you know, the, the linebacker according the back end. Right. But we have to do what we need to do upfront. But at the end of the day, your quarterback can't miss their throws. Don't, Joe. Yeah. He just can't. I'm sorry. And guys, I don't, I don't, you know, I I'm not trying to, you know, it was 2015 and maybe y'all take Constellation in that and see the thing is with me is that Ocho, when I look at a game, I don't watch the sound.


Right. I'm not looking at, they score a cuts down. Yay. I'm looking at why you scored. Right. Okay. The ball is incomplete. I'm looking at why it's incomplete. I'm looking at a situation that's a coverage. I'm like, bro, what, what? Why in that coverage, You know, It's funny. You have to understand. Well, like, and people got mad at me. I was like, bro, I understand that's court. Well if aj, but that wasn't aj. Right. You know, that's not aj. That first of all, Devonte is 60 pounds less than aj. Right. So even if AJ collides if Yeah. It's gonna be incomplete. Right. That's not, Devonte game is not physicality. Right. It's finesse. You have to understand that. And in that situation, that down and distance, that area of the field is about physicality.


Right. Because you're asking him to cross his face or collided. Because the one thing you don't want happen at the best thing Yeah. Is that you score touchdown. The second best thing is incomplete. The absolute worst thing is what Ocho an interception ception and they got the absolute, there were three things that could have happened. Yeah. And they got the absolute worst. Worst. So when I look at the situation I'm looking at, I'm telling you, if Daniel Jones make two throws a night, the Giants win this game. Yeah. Oh yeah. That we that won the neighbors or that won the slave that won that won the Slaton should have put the nail in the coffin that won the slaton should have put the nail in the coffin. You talking about winning bad at the line. Not only he beat back buddy. He And Denny gave a little nudge. Jojo, Hey, Denny gave a little nudge.


He got a little more separation. And He gonna look at film. Daniel Jones will look at film. The receiver's gonna look at film and they gonna be upset. They gonna, the coach is gonna be upset. 'cause they know that's the game. Yeah. They could have won. Yeah. If, if not only listen, we, we score five field goals. All right. That'd get you beat. But the fact that you missed the throws as well, on top of only scoring five, getting, getting five field goals, they ain't gonna win you no games. No it's not. Oh Joe, it's not like you barely in the red zone you way down there. Down there. Yeah. You way, I mean you in the five, you at the five yard line. And look, they, they had a great play called the over, what's the name? Over over Sean made a great play.


They had a play to Ronell Robinson. They, they, they, they put him in motion and they swung him outta the back field and he has to come from his inside linebacker spot. Right. And he has to make a play on a wide receiver tip your hat to him. He made an unbelievable play because son, look, you gonna have one-on-one. That's the guy you gotta beat. You either run his ass over or you gotta make him miss. Right. Those are your only two options. But you can't let him tackle you in the open field. That's what they say. I'm, I'm, I'm telling you what they're telling him. Having been in situations like that, having been in offensive meeting room and saying, look, that's the guy. You got two choices. Right. You run his ass over or you make him miss, those are your only two options because if you do one of those two things, the ball's in the end zone.


Other than that, we gotta kick a field goal. Yeah. And what did they do? They kicked the field goal. Give OSHA credit. He made an unbelievable play. Unbelievable. But you've got to, you've got, especially because the Cowboy, if the Cowboys that set up for two field goals, you right there with him. Mocho. But they kick, they got touchdowns. Yeah. So now you got, think about it, you got four field goals. They got two touchdowns and they're in front by two points. That's it. That's, that's then They kick a tack on another field goal. Now you need a touchdown to take the lead lead because the field goal won't help you. And that's the, and that's what I'm telling you because you have to look at the game and like, well damn, we kick we kicking the field goals. They, hey, they got two touchdowns and they get, they got us.


They, They, they, they got us right now. But in that situation, man, Daniel Jones just, he has to make those. He just has to Yeah. Ocho he has to, Well listen in Order for the job to have any level of Success. If not, both of them make one of them. If not both of those throws make one of 'em. 'cause one of those throws both are touchdowns, but just make one of 'em. And the game is completely different. Completely Different. Yeah. I agree. I agree. I agree. That's, and but that's the, that's the difference in the ball game because you look, like we said, there are a couple of plays here or there. It is not the totality of the game. Right? Yeah. You could look at it and say, okay, it's 60 minutes in the ball game. Right. But when you go back and break it down like we have for decade, you go back and you're like, okay, this might have been the playwright here that could have broke the game up for us.


That could have swung the momentum in our favor. And who knows what happens after that. But we got to make those plays. Especially if you are as challenged offensively as they are. Right. And the giants are challenged offensively. They don't have anybody that put fear in your heart in the run game. 24 carries 26 yards. Yeah. That's not striking. Fear in nobody's heart. Neighbors is, is, is is is legit. He legit Wonell Robinson you can win with. Yeah. Slaton, he's okay. Yeah. He's here to miss. I mean, he, he can light you up for a big day and then some days not so much. Right. But I, they leave a lot to be desired offensively. And when you leave a lot to be desired offensively, when your opportunity presents himself ocho you might, Hey, it's like a situation where a guy, you might only be in the room with this, this good looking woman one time.


Yeah. At some point in time you gotta find your way to make your way over in her vicinity and you, and get her attention. And you better make the most of your opportunity. You better, you Never know. Make the Most up your of your opportunity. Exactly. Because you, and don't wait too long. Because while you over, should I, and next thing you know, somebody else Don walked in there, he up, they're talking to him. That's right. And now you're like, damn, I done blew my opportunity. Yes. Yes. And so that's how you have to approach it. If you're, if you're the Giants, right. The opportunities are not gonna be there often. But when they do present themselves, you make sure you in position and you make that play. Yeah. So the Cowboys move to two and two, they get 10 days off.


Now they play again. They don't play again until the following Sunday, if I'm not mistaken. Who they got 20 to 15. They win over. The Giants go to two and two, both of their wins on the road, both of their losses at home. The Giants fall to one and three and they're oh and two at home. Wait, what's, what's the Cowboys got next? I mean, they got three hard games in a row, don't they? Who they, who they got at? They got the Steelers. Woo. Who they got after that boy guy. A Guyton got guy. Well, Guyton on Steelers left Tackle Lions. Niners. Oh shit. Falcons. Oh My God.


Well that's five in a row. And then the Texans, Well that's, Hey, that's the six game gauntlet right there. That's the, that is the six game gauntlet We're gonna find. I remember when, when out we with the Broncos, Mike would always tell us, win, lose or draw, looking at the schedule. And, we took it one at a time. Said, we gonna find out a lot about ourselves over the next several weeks. We broke, I mean, a lot of times Ocho, we didn't, Mike would have the board blacked out. So the only thing you could see right, was the next opponent. He said it's a 16 round fight. Right. We gonna take one round at a time. Right? Yes sir.


So I mean, obviously, you know, you can look at the paper, you see the schedule or something like that. But on the board, when you walked in, the only thing you saw was the opponent you were about to face. Face, yeah. He didn't want you looking down the road. The most important game on our schedule is happening Sunday. Yeah. It's happening Monday night. And it keep you focused, he said, but we're gonna find out a lot about ourselves. Yeah. Oh, but listen, cowboy, I like, I like fighting a lot about myself. Yeah. I like fighting. I am. Whatever I say I am. If I wasn't, why would I say I am? Mm. Come on now, Now what I want. Hey, I, I needed to, I needed to know. I thought I was pretty good. But the point, the team that we playing, they got a Pro Bowl all pro safety.


Right? They got Pro Bowl all Pro Corner. They got Pro Bowl all pro linebackers. Yeah. Okay, Shannon, you talk about you the best. Hell Yeah. Not to show me. And when I leave this game, they gonna say I'm the best too. I'm the best foot. I'm the best tight end and I'm the best inch talker for sure.

I talked with the best of, I didn't wear a mouthpiece for a reason. I didn't either. People like, man, you don't wear no mouthpiece. No man, I ain't got time. I done put my pan in the dirt. I done slapped the door on his back. I done slapped him on his ass about good job. And you think I'm about to reach in my mouth and pull my mouthpiece out? I wish I might. And plus I didn't wanna take time to put hold on. No, I just wanna be talking on cue. Shut the it a on site, whatever, whoever. Every time. Hey, shut up.


I wasn't even talking to you, but since you ran your mouth, I'm talking to your, you know what, now get It too. Oh man. Oh, for sure. It some good days. Boy. Good days. Ocho, I don't know if you saw this, but Jerry said Tuesday is very unfair to, he said it is very fair to blame the Cowboys struggles on him. That's very fair. It is well known. No decision is ultimately made here. What? I either have accu or proved it. That's very fair. Whatever it is here, that's the way it is. Jerry, you not interrupting our normally scheduled programming to tell us that we know that. Yeah. You made that abundantly clear.


And I've been saying that. I've been saying that for the longest. I thought Jerry would've got the message by now. I mean obviously the he go ignore it. You said he was gonna ignore it. Jerry let the players play. Jerry let the coaches coach the team itself because of the star on his helmet. It gets enough attention as it is. There's enough pressure on the players already. There's enough, there's enough pressure on the coaches already. 'cause they can't even make the goddamn decisions they need to make to win the goddamn to win the goddamn game. They need to win because right, you looking over everybody's shoulder, take a back seat, kick your feet up, man. P matter of fact, go watch the game on your yacht. Oh, Joe, tell Jerry, go watch the game on your yacht. Let them boys do what they need to do. Man. No, but but, but he can't.


But see what Jerry fail to realize. The cowboys are the sun. Does the sun need to burn any hotter for it to be brighter? It's Already hard. It's brighter. Yeah. Jerry, you don't have to sell it. It's already sold. Listen, listen. Hey, That the way, keep his name because if you talk Go ahead. Go ahead. Don't you. The Dallas Cowboys is blue magic for Chad. If you start American gangster, the Dallas Cowboys and Blue Magic, you ain't got to do nothing to it. You ain't gotta do nothing to it. Just sell it as it is. It's gonna sell itself. Come on Jerry. Somebody might get a little bit more credit because you think about it, if you look at the nineties, what did they talk about?


They talked about Jimmy. Yeah. And the triplets. Yeah. Nobody mentioned, nobody mentioned Jerry. Even though, even though once Jimmy left, he was yaking. Yeah. It was the triplets. It was Troy, Emmett and Michael. Right. When Jimmy was there. It was Jimmy. How about them cowboys? Right. Jerry despised that because he saw Al when you played the Raiders, it's always been Al Davis. Right? It's always been about al It's kinda like, and, and the Yankees before Mr. Steinbrenner passed, all those great players. Yeah. Once he purchased it from CBS, I think in 73 for like $7 million.


It's all, it was about George Jerry learned how to be an owner from Al Davis. It was always about Al. And that's what Jerry wants. He wants that attention. Yeah. Most owners, Mr. Craft, you look at the Rooneys back, they, we good back here. Eddie de Barlow though, for the 49 ERs before his sister. Now Jed York and them had, the York family has it right? They in the back Clark Hunt Clark. Yeah. Before his dad. Before his dad. Mr. La rest his soul. Lamar, I played the chief when his dad owned the team.


I mean, you didn't, even if you don't, if you didn't know. Right. It's something when the owner is the centerpiece of your franchise, there's something to be said for that. Yeah, Yeah. Most definitely. Most definitely. Hey, listen, I don't, I don't think they will see success until things change. And I'm sure Jerry's not gonna step down because he's always, he's already made the comment that who can run the team better than he can. But obviously he might be the issue because they haven't been back to the Super Bowl, what, the last 25, 27 years. I'm not sure what the number may be, but it's one thing about him. He's a great salesman. That's why the Oh yeah. The fans and the city, everyone continues to buy in because he gonna sell you.


He gonna sell you dream that Man. He gonna say you, they kill it. Jerry, they kill Jerry to chat. They said, Jerry be taking that. It's a game of inches. Literally, man, y'all get outta the chat. Come on man. Hey, that's a good one. Hey, that's A good one. Yeah. But, but that's, but you're right. You, you, you're right, Ocho. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Right. This is what, you know, this is what Jerry wants. Jerry's like, anytime you're talking about the Cowboys, be it good, bad. Oh, doesn't matter. You're talking Yeah. Long as you're talking, that's maybe that's the, that's the damn problem. But hey, Like, like I said, I, I played with Mr. B, Mr BA, I mean, before, like early on Ocho, he'd be on the sideline.


He had his fur miss fur coat on his mink or whatever the case may be. Boom. In the sideline, Mr. Mode stood in the back. The only time, the only time Mr. Mode. I was there two years. Now I don't know what he was like before I got there. And I don't know what he was like after I left. Right. The only time in the locker room, Mr. Mode spoke after we won the Super Bowl, he broke down and started crying. Mm. He said, I'll never forget what y'all did for me today. He said, I'm proud of you. He said, I'm very proud of you now. He said, I'll never forget what you did today. That's the only time Mr. BI don't recall Mr. B talking in the locker room. And I was there, we went back to back Super Bowl.


I don't remember Mr. B talking in the, in, in the locker room. Right. But I, I guess go ask the Cowboys. Can they remember a time Jerry not talking in the locker room Run center? Yeah. When Jimmy was there. Why you think Parcells left? Yeah. Be listen that, listen. Bill Parcells and a lot of people, I see a lot of people talk about Bill Belichick taking a job in Dallas like you talk about. I don't, I it, it wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. You know, bill Belichick is no different than Bill Parcells. Like all that, all that talking, the two, the one number one thing, being a part of the Patriot Way is some, one of the things that Bill Belichick des despite this, and you cannot do, you cannot talk to the media.


You can't, you giving don't tell say nothing short and sweet to the point. Don't talk, don't give don't give a team any bullish board material. And you think Bill be Belichick is going to the Cowboys to have Jerry front and center every goddamn time. What ab Absolutely not. Oh, Joe, what other owner in the NFL what other owner in any sport has a, a radio show? Oh 1 0 1 0 5 1 0 3 0.5. Something like that. Yeah. Hey man, listen. Yeah, Him, Jerry, that's my point. He gotta he gotta be heard, man. That's, that's it. He gotta be heard. It's because here's the thing. Let's just say for the, let's just say for the sake of argument, right?


Coach Belichick says, well, I don't really need to be the general manager. Okay, we can see that. But he says, Jerry, these are the type players. I'm, you do know if Coach Belichick comes in there and he makes changes, right? That's an indictment on Jerry, because Jerry believes the players that he had are exquisite ain't enough. Coach Belichick comes in and says, I need this type of player. Right? Oh, now what? Now what? Yeah. Now we got a problem before, before sport even started, the show didn't even start yet. They, the the credit. Listen, not, not the credits. What you call it, what you call it, what? Come on. Before the, before the movie. Come on.


Oh, the preview. Oh yeah, The preview, the preview's on. They ain't even getting, they sit in the previews and they already buttoning heads Ocho. But here's the thing. If Coach Belichick comes in and the Cowboys get to and win the Super Bowl, who gonna get the credit? Oh, you know, bill. Oh, you know, we talking about Bill winning this eighth or The one thing that Jerry did despised. That's why he ran Jimmy off. What other coach, you know, will run a coach off after back to back Super Bowls, considering they hadn't won one since the seventies. So they hadn't won one in damn this 20 years. And the coach that comes in, they give you back to back and you got a 25-year-old Troy Aman, 25-year-old, a 24-year-old Emmett Smith.


You got a 26-year-old Michael Urban. So you got those in guys in the absolute crime. And he say, now the guy that got this, nah, you gotta go Ego boy, ego pride, you know, and listen, your pride fall first before everything else do. I think the greatest thing that's ever happened was what we saw in New And. we might not see it again because Mr. Kraft set his ego aside and for the longest time, Tom and Coach Belichick set their egos aside. Right? Right. And then somebody started listening to the noise and said, who deserves more credit?


And then all of a sudden somebody, Tom did not wanna leave New England. No. Tom wanted to be a one helmet guy. He wanted to be that. He deserved that. Yeah. I mean, some people deserved that opportunity. Like Coach Smith, North Carolina. He deserved to stay there as long as he didn't get involved in a, a scandal. Right. He deserved to be there. Coach K at Kentucky Coach Summit at Tennessee. But you know, there are certain coaches, coach Bryan, Nick sat certain coaches, you know, because they've, they've been exemplary on the field. Right. And in the community, they get to finish on their terms. Tom Brady has been everything.


The player he's, he was supposed to play. And this is the one time that Mr. K Crossbo had to put his foot down and say, Billy, that's what he calls Coach Belichick. Billy. Yeah. I ain't gonna do it. I ain't gonna do it. Damn. I'm not, I'm not. Because he said Tommy was like a son to him. Yeah. The value in that franchise was because of one two. Yeah. He gave his mom a Super Bowl ring. Family members don't normally get Super Bowl rings.


I gave my brother my Super Bowl ring because it meant more for me for him to have it right. Than it ever would to me. Hmm. I laugh. So, but no, Tom was supposed to be there for perpetuity. Right. Tom supposed to, Hey roll. Hey, if he got a motorized scooter, a cane or walker. Right. But not, he's supposed to have been there. And for whatever reasons Coach Belichick thought it was over. And well, it started way before then. Don't Joe, it started way before then when Jimmy G Yeah. Was There. Yeah. Yeah. And they, and the guy wrote that article, Seth Wickersham and somebody else, mark Fatal Ada or somebody else wrote an article right.


About the power struggle that was starting to happen. And Mr. Kraft put his foot down and say, you will trade Jimmy G he basically gave Jimmy G away to the 49 ERs. He adores Kyle Shanahan, he has the utmost respect for Kyle's father, Mike Shanahan. So he is like as a, basically an f you to Mr. Craft. Well, I'm gonna give him away. I mean, listen, I mean he was, he was gonna be next in line. He was gonna be next in line. And I as, as, as the franchise quarterback, I don't want the person who is next in line my successor to be looking over my shoulder. Because at any point when I'm not playing well or as good as I should be based on what people are used to seeing.


Now y'all calling for Jimmy G to be the starter man, y'all gotta get him up outta here. But even though he gotta Give him up outta here. What, what I've, what I've relayed and through my experience in being around great players, right? Great players as they start to get a, as they start to age, they only get compared to them younger self. Who could you compare Tom to? Who did you compare Peyton to? You compare them to them younger self. Right. And so that's what the great players, that's, that's their honor. You comparing me, you compare comparing a 35, 30 6-year-old right. To a 24, 20 5-year-old.


And although Tom, Tom, I mean it is not like he had three games in a row to man threw for 150 yards. But considering what he, because Edelman has started to be involved in a little bit, few too many car wrecks. Right. It has started to affect him. Right. Gro has started to get nicked a little bit more frequently and has started to impact him. And so the weapons that he once had were plenty. But the collisions had started to add up. Right. So that started to impact him. Well, coach Belichick thought it was Brady. He didn't look around at the surroundings to see, man, if I get, you know, maybe upgrade something.


Right. Because Brady had taken pay cuts for damn near for 20 years. Yeah. So what the hell you, you, you put hiding the money under your pillow. So where, where was all, where, where were you spending the money? And he had started, he had started to reach and reach. 'cause a lot of times when you become Greg Ocho, you start to take unnecessary risks. Yeah. He had had such success. He got Gronk, he got Aaron Hernandez in the third round. He got Gronk in the second round. Who was the first round pick, but he had the back injury. Yeah. Hernandez was the first round pick. But he had the off the field issues, he dropped to the third. You get Edelman in in the seventh round, you get Amandola and Fred. And so you get Wes weer, you know, people don't really know. And so he, but, and you know he, he had some good picks early on, especially defenseman.


Oh yeah. But his wide receivers, the wide receivers he was picking was terrible. Bo terrible, but well Damn, It was fun. 20 years. I mean, look, who wouldn't take 20 years? Six Super Bowls, nine Super Bowl appearances. Ojo. Yeah. Every, everybody would Hell yet it would, Everybody would. But you know how hard it is to win six Super Bowls. Hell, I know how hard it's to win one. You, you talking about one. Yeah. You know how hard it's to win one, let alone to go to nine and win six. You can't even do, it's difficult to do that in the video game.


Mad, let alone in real life. That lets you know how great and how much of an icon god damn bill is. Yeah. Ocho, before we move on, Ocho and Ra guys have officially made up. Hold on. They've kissed and made up and so die. And they look at you. Nah, we, we ain't, we ain't. I mean look, we, we all right, we all right. But listen, I eased up. You know how you, when you driving right? And you step on the brake. Yeah. So I stepped on the brake a little bit. IE I'm easing off of it. I ain't ease off it all the way. 'cause if you ease off it all the way, they gonna think shit. Sweet. Shit ain't sweet. Shit ain't sweet. And I'm, I'm, I'm being serious for those for, you know, I'm, I mean yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm handling this as mature as I can, as mature as I possibly can.


So She Right. Well I'm, I'm ha I'm proud of you bro. Yeah, yeah. I, I'm proud of you. I appreciate that. She right there behind you can't see her. Oh, She to be asleep Baby. Yeah, she, she knocked out back there. Listen, she back there snoring like a rhino. You can't hear. Hey, Re re say I go, re say I'm traveling. Re say I travel. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, I, she came, she came with me, you know, came to support me at, at the inside the NFL Wednesday. So, you know, we left, we left there and drove on down to New York. So we, you know, we in New York, I see people in the chat making fun of me talking about, but what you in a storage unit with no lights? Somebody say what?


You back in the closet, but you in the storage unit? No, my hotel, I got the lights off. 'cause you know my little, my little, my little baby hippo, my little baby baby back there. No storm. But she Sleeping. Yeah, She's sleeping. But other than that man, I just, man, we, we good man. We can take, take things slow. What I need to do, I need to start over with her. 'cause we in year five, right And, we Yeah. Done got a little comfortable. I think she done got a little comfortable. She done got a little complacent. I think I got a little complacent. And it ain't the same like it was in the beginning. I need to record. I I I need to, I need to find ways to, to fall in love again. You know, and yeah. Find ways to redate, you know, all that, all that good stuff, man.


You know, just add a little little pepper and spice of this shit. 'cause we, you know, we, we done got everything became routine. Yeah. You get settled. I mean natural. Yeah. I, I'm just being honest. We, we, we, we Had a good, good talk. Is she working? You working? Yeah. We, we had a good talk, man. Driving from Phil. Driving from Philly to here or we had That's it. That's what's Up. Yeah. About time she took, you know, something that most women don't. She took accountability. I was like, okay, I'm, I'm proud of you. That's Yeah. 'cause you ain't did that in five years. I like that. I like that. Yeah. I like that. I'm a Dog. I'm a dog. Own it. Yeah. Yeah. Mess up. Clean it up. Yeah. Yeah. But the greatest apology is change behavior.


Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It is. It is. It is. But listen, I, I listen. I like, I like when I hear that phrase right there, the greatest apology is change behavior. Now there's only so much we can do as humans because you are who you are, especially at our big age. You know, and at times if you have to change too much of who you are to piece someone else, then you lose a sense of yourself. Right. And that's one thing I can't do. I can't lose a sense of self and what makes me me now, the issues and problems that we do have are, are not magnified that much because they're small, they're Fixable. Yeah. They're, they're fixable problems. But what I need to do is I need to find a way to minimize those small problems. Because small problems continue to build and build and build and build and build big, build become, and they become big problems.


Right. But that's why you jump on them. That's why. But here's the thing, Ocho, as long as you approach her in a way Right, that's not confrontational. Yeah. You're like, babe, I wanna talk to you about something and no, you know, it's not an issue, but I don't want it to become an issue. So, and then you, you, you, you approach it like that. You don't approach her in a confrontational manner. No, you don't. Cause you like you, you wrong. And I'm right in this situation. You talk to her, like I said, I I, I just know rel through you. But I think, I think, you know, she, she's probably, because the one thing I do know Ocho, she, she, she, she loves you. She wanted you. Yeah. She wanted you. She wanted you. Yeah. And it's one, it's one thing, it's a one thing when a woman wants a man.


Yeah. There's not a whole lot that woman won't do for that man. Yeah. And vice versa. And vice versa. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I, I don't think I'm breaking, I don't inter I'm not breaking news, but when a woman really wants a man and she put herself out there like, yeah, I want you. Yeah. Let it be known. Let the record clearly state that rail won't owe You. And you gotta, that's not how she told me. She said, she said, I want you, but I don't need you. So like, it was like, it was, she kind of hit me with a, like a backhanded compliment at the same time. Like, well, damn, you ain't go ahead in there. Just say you want me. You ain't had to tell me you ain't need me. We know, we know we, we know you good. But I think we, we on the right path.


We, we, we doing good. We doing good. But I, I like, and I, some, somebody tweeted me the other day, why you always posting when y'all beefing? But listen, I post, when we happy, I post, when we smiling, I post, when we sleeping, I post, when we wake up in the morning, I post every goddamn thing. I'm not living shit privately because I ain't got nothing of goddamn hide. Like, some of these people that think they, they wanna be so secretive and like, who the fuck is y'all? I ain't no motherfucking Alister. I'm going through the same shit y'all go through in the chat. I'm going through the same shit. You go through What? I mean, we all go through the same thing hiding for what we got. I go through the same argument y'all go through.


We had the same fights y'all have, man. Yeah. I think the, like I said, it's okay, but as, as somebody that's gone to therapy for a number of years and many of times is that the therapist always say, Shannon, yeah. Are you arguing to be right or are you arguing for Right? Ooh. She say there are totally different things they both end with. Right. But let, what are you arguing for? Right? And you have to be able to communicate with your partner, Both in a language they can understand. Right. If you speak in Mandarin Chinese and she's speaking Spanish, or she's speaking Portuguese, there's, there's no communication there.


And you've got to have communicated. See, when you have uncommunicated expectations Mm. You have expectations for re rel has expectations for you, but they aren't communicated. Right. See, this is where the problem starts to arrive because there's uncommunicated. Well, I thought Ocho was gonna take me this. Right? Well, she ain't tell me. So how am I supposed to know? Mm. See, sometimes we get to the thing. Well, you should just know. No baby, just tell me what you mean. I can't read your mind there. Just tell me what you want. Right. And I'm gonna do, I'm, I'm gonna try to do what I can to make sure that happens. 'cause I wanna make you happy. Because at the end of the day, a man, when he's looking for a, I'm talking about a real, a woman is not a educational, ocho is not a body is not a beauty is not the sex.


Can you bring him peace? Mm. What All those things. All those things, the finest, beautiful, I mean, hanging from the chandel, the ceiling fan. Yes sir. And he can turn it on high, but if you don't give that man peace, eventually he gonna leave. But you know what? Also, in turn, one of the things I learned, especially about myself now, like, I like what you're talking about, but I'm gonna take accountability on my end. So I got to bring o' hell, real peace, my god damn self. Yes. I got, I got, I gotta bring up peace. So normally if I'm bringing her peace, then once I, once I crossed that threshold in that door that I call my safe place or my safe haven, whatever it may be, then I do get peace.


Yes. Now, if I'm acting a goddamn donkey and I'm expecting her, I'm expecting her to bring me peace when I'm acting a fool. Oh nah, it don't, it don't, it don't work that way. Nah. Oh, it don't work that way. Yeah.

Hey, they, they call it that like doxins like swat, right? Swat like, I think they do it the game at time when they streaming. Yeah. That that, that's real dangerous. That's real. Yeah. Real thing. You can't play like that. I mean, but you know, kids, kids especially at that age, they don't know no damn better. They know better. I mean, I mean they know Better in that situation.


They don't understand, They don't understand the Constitution. We did pranks. We knocked people mailbox down. Right. We toilet paper people. Cars and stuff like that. Egg. Egg the car. Egg the house Egg. Yes. We're not gonna put someone in harm's way where police might go in their guns, drones and somebody get hurt. Yeah. I mean, I understand pranks 'cause hey, been a apart. Hey, I've done 'em, done them lock people in their room. You a rubbing alcohol on there and set it on fire. You won't come out And, we gonna burn you out. You know what I'm saying? We, I we did all that. Yeah. But come on now. You know the police going to come, come on now. And then you talking about you thought it was fun. Really.


Listen, they, they learning all that from you on, on tube, you YouTube. Yeah, yeah. All that stuff like that. Kids just be careful. Just be careful. I mean, you put somebody in harm's way, it's different. Now the jokes, like I said, I mean, 'cause here's the thing, Ocho and people document everything. Yeah. Like I said, we knock people's mailbox down. Oh, hold on. What about, but I'm saying about what about N ni? NI, you know what? Knocking? Huh? Nick? Nick and, and Lee And, and running. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh, knock, knock. Yeah. Somebody, somebody let you have it. Yeah. It's in knocking. I can, I'm trying, I'm trying not to say the word, but I'm, there might be another Yeah.


Another word for it. But Yeah, somebody let you have it people because they, because Ocho, everybody don't play the same. No. Yeah. Yeah. You Right. That's why you have to, that's how you have to be careful who you play with. Yeah. Everybody doesn't play the same. Everybody. Because, and I tell people what is joke to you is deaf to somebody else. Boy, boy, listen. You keep on. Oh, that bad. That's a joke. He, he, okay. Two people need to be laughing for it to be a joke. Yeah. Because what you think is funny, if somebody ha handle your ass, now all of a sudden you're like, man, it wasn't that serious. Clearly he thought it was what? Yeah. She thought it was. And you can't tell nobody how to relax.


You don't. Right. You get to control actions. You don't get to control. Consequences. Consequences. Yeah. Because that would be so unfair. I mean, think about Ocho. You get to be, you get to do something to someone and then you get to control the consequences of the actions that you did. Right. How fair is that? Yeah. I commit a crime and you say, you know what? I think I should do probably like three, four days in jail. Huh? I did something and then No, no, no. It doesn't work like that. Right. So just be kids, kids, be careful, be mindful. Actions have consequences. And then, oh, oh, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.


It doesn't matter. Intent only matters to the defendant because a lot of times, murder, manslaughter, invol negligent homicide. Yeah. Intent only matters to the defendant. The victim is just as dead. So whether you meant to do it or you intended to do it, the outcome is the same. The Same. Yeah. So key is just be careful, be mindful of stuff like that. That's all I'm asking. I understand your kids, but at, at a certain point in time, you know right from wrong. Yeah. Ding dong ditch. That's what I was trying to say. I wa yeah, I, I, I was, I wanted to say nigga knocking, but I was trying not to say the N word, but Yeah, yeah, yeah. We used to prank call.


You call, you call convenience Store, do prank calls. Hey, excuse me. Do you have Prince AB in the can? We sure do. Well, you better let him out before you suffocate. You know what I'm saying? We just, But you know, back then Ocho, see you. Everybody was on the line. So you could just like, like if, if you was my neighbor, right? And you got on the line, I could pick the phone up and hear you talking to re I would ask you, man, Ocho, how much longer you gonna be on the phone? 'cause I need to use, right. I'm expecting to call at such and such time. Because if somebody was on the line, it would ring busy. So you couldn't get a call. As long as somebody come, everybody had was on that line until everybody got individual lines. Right.


So I was like, I can pick up the phone and such. The neighbor down the, down the road they be talking. I was like, and excuse me, Ms. Dwindle, how much longer are you gonna be on the phone? My granddaddy expected a call. Okay. Okay, son. I tell, tell Bar or hello and they would get off the phone. Yeah. But, but Ocho yeah. While the dolphins wait for Tua to recover from his concussion, the team is unlikely to trade for a quarterback who might be able to feel the starter per ESPN, Jeremy Fowler, the Dolphins making the trade. Doesn't seem like at this likely, at this point, despite Tua being out for at least three more games while low injury reserve one source told Fowler that Miami is not much into at this time when talking about a potential trade Ocho, do you like the decision of the Dolphins not to look for a trade or trade partner or a viable option while Tua is on the injury reserve?


Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I, I don't think they need to. I, I like the, I like the pickup with Tyler Huntley. I like it. I think he, he's efficient at the quarterback position. I'm, listen, he's somewhat, he's not Lamar Jackson not even close to Lamar Jackson, but he's something like that. Obviously he's the dude threat quarterback. He can throw it, he can wing it now because we've seen him play, we, we've seen him play in place from Lamar Jackson when he was with the Ravens. He can run it, he can throw it. And I think because the tools that he does have and the supporting cast is so good around him, I think he can win the Dolphins maybe two to three or maybe three of the four games until two.


It has You think so? Come back. I, I, I'm serious. I, I I really believe so. I really, who I Really believe So asked who's the next dolphins, the next three opponents. I guarantee you I'm right too. I guarantee you the next two, the next three games they win two or three. And it's gonna be because the Tyler, it's gonna be, 'cause the Tyler Hunts left Titans and his arm Patriots Coach Win win. Okay. Now that Colton game might be a little, that coach game might be a little different, but that Titans game. But you Know Patriots, the Patriots do play pretty good defense now. Yeah. They they play pretty good. They, they, they do play pretty good defense. But I'm telling you, the Dolphins gonna beat, they gonna beat the Patriots.


They definitely be the tightest. 'cause Will lts going to going to give them the game? Oh, He gonna, he gonna give, he gonna Give you six. He gonna give you the game. But I, I like Tyler. I, I like Tyler Hunt. I think they gonna be all right till, till the goddamn two will come back. Okay. Tickets for the Dolphins Ocho Where, where tickets for the Dolphins Titans game on Monday night are just $33 and continue to fall. Wait, wait. Whoa. $33. Where they playing at? Not at, not in Miami. They, they're playing. What they playing? They gotta Be playing. It's in Miami. Not for no $33. 33.


Oh. You might wanna, you, you might wanna fact check that 33. Oh, you talking about nosebleed? Hey, for 150 you can sit in the suite. Boy, if, if, if listen, if a sweet ticket's $150, I'm going to the game. Well get ready. Go ahead. Wait, that's the, they play this Sunday, right? They play Monday night. Right? Is it Monday night or Sunday? They play Monday night. Okay. I'm, I'm going to the game. I'm gonna go to the game. I'm gonna go to the game and leave at halftime. So I'm not late. Yeah. I mean, I mean, look here. Hey, I tell you what you do. Yeah. Just go to, Hey, just drive to Miami, go to the gas station, leave your windows down and go in there and get your, a bag of chips and a soda.


When you come back, there'll be four tickets on your dash. That's all you gotta do. Gotta you go in there and get you a bag of chips and a soda. Leave your windows down. And when you come back, there'll be four tickets on your dash. Hey, now that's that. Now that was a good one. That was a good one. But we talk about the dolphin thing. We talk, we talk about, Man, you We how F are Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They are. They are. They are. They are. They are. But listen, we still got waddle. We still got re we still got H chain.


We still got moster. Hey, lift, we get, we get a little low, low, low competence at the quarterback position. We gonna be all right. We gonna be all right. Yeah. Ocho, y'all did hold on. Y'all dealing with that storm. Everybody that's on the East coast that's being impacted by Helen and any Helen, hurricane Helen. Yeah. Yeah. Helena, little, little Norton, Florida, Helene, Florida, like up there in Tallahassee. Stay safe. Jacksonville Stay safe. And when they tell you guys you need to evacuate, make sure you evacuate. People don't, I mean, you know, responders don't have an opportunity to come back and get nobody. Yeah. So if they tell you, I get it. You wanna be tough, we gonna ride it out. We rolled out Andrew And, we rolled out this one and that one. Come on. Yeah.


Let's just, let's just, let's, let's be smart. Let's be prudent. Life is more valuable than any possessions. Right. And let's just be smart. But us at Nightcap, we're praying Yeah. For everybody's safety. And so hopefully no one gets severely impacted by this storm. And so Ocho Yeah. The big homie Bengal's. Legend Willie Anderson is racing Joes defense. He's telling Tims in sports, anyone blaming Cincinnati early season woes on quarterback, it's flat out wrong. That's ridiculous, bro. Like, these are games be, they're in these games because of him. It's just totally ridiculous. I mean, I saw some comments that Chris Canty made.


Yeah. After Joe Burrow had a, a, a good game. Now I, now we have started slow. He did give away, give away a fumble, I think a fumble that might've that Kansas City. Yeah. Kansas City game that might've, might've cost us game, right? Yeah. Other than that, there, there, there, there've been a, a few mistakes, a few errors, a little bit, a little bit of inconsistency and, and, and slow play to start the, start the season. But one thing about Joe Burrow, he always picks up as the season goes, he always gets the rhythm, the chemistry with himself, the offense and the receiving core. It gets going as the, as, as the, as the weeks go on, as we saw against the commanders.


Even though it, you know, they lost, he he had a good game. Right. And did Jayden Daniels. But I, I think, I think he gonna be all right. I think he gonna be all right to understand what Willie's saying. Obviously it is to say that Jbo is playing bad and they're losing because of him is No, No, no, no, no, no, no. But Ocho but here's the thing, the thing that I want to give, look, we not have to debate Tom Brady is what he's been able to accomplish. Right. But I think some of, one of the greatest thing, one of his greatest attributes that he could understand very early in the ball game, what was needed of him. Right. You see, they see the difference is Washington went three or three in the red zone. Yeah. The bingos went two or four. Two Or four. Yeah. See that's the difference in your ball game.


Remember, field goal gets your beat scoring touchdown. See, you can't set up fulfill goals when the other team is getting touchdown. Yeah. So that's it. Because this is what we've always done. I remember Peyton Manning would outplay Tom Brady, stat wise, Tom Brady would win because he would get the ball into the end zone in the red zone. Everybody blamed Brady. Everybody blamed Peyton. Right. Even though Peyton had the superior stats. So at the end of the day, or the, because did Dak play bad Sunday against the Ravens? Do you see Dak, did they see Daks number?


But At the end of the day, you gotta get the ball into the end zone because you see your defense. If our defense could just give us one stop, right. That can alter it. But if that's all I need, but if they don't, I can't kick field goals because now I'm allowing too much separation to get in between us. Because the likelihood if we can't stop 'em and we're neck and neck. Right. What's the chance we gonna stop him with? Yo, we get down 13, we get down 15 and you see what happened. They tried to make it a ball game. And what did Jay Daniels do? He came right back on the field. Hold my beer. That's what he told him. Hold my beer.


So, But did you see that goddamn throw with The Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. With the, with the free runner coming. Yeah. And he sat there in that pocket and led that man and Dropped he special. He, he, he is impressive. I was, I was very impressed for a young man to go on the road. But Ocho you gotta remember now. Yeah. He had 55. College starts 55. That's a lot of starts. That's a lot of starts Ocho he what the moment wasn't too big. Yeah. The lights weren't too bright and the crowd didn't get too loud. I mean, shit. Hell playing the LSU You should just that transition into the NFL should be like, be right.


You should be right at home. The Volume.
