It's about the money. Sometimes it be that, but it a lot of times New devils. New devils man. You gotta understand this. It's real. As you get real deep, a lot of things change. When you build an infrastructure, it's gonna be people that's gonna be like, man Shane, I need you to do. I can't do that right now. I I I'm building my stuff. Right.

I say, man, everybody, every profile I go on or ig making six figure. That's a Lie. It's deep. I'm Thinking more like 90% making six figure. It's gotta be. Wow. It's deep. It's deep. Or Somebody lying. I be either the the economist or No, the problem is people don't know how to prioritize. What people would do is they'd be spending outside of they means, and then they want somebody else to take care of their responsibility. That's the, that's the game we living in. People would do anything for a picture man to take that picture and post it up. Yes. Why you go real fake, three, four, $500 just to rent a car to like the flaw or go spend a thousand dollars to get on a private jet.


No. Goodwill. You know why they do that? Wallo? Yeah. You spend all that money. Well, you coulda just jumped in it and got a, got a nice ticket for $900. The first class man, them private jets to me. 'cause that little area, the little ac That's mine. Excuse me. The, the, the pot, the flight is here. I want some cranberries juice Now that you come into some money. So you, you're comfortable. You're beyond comfortable. Yeah. What is the first thing when you got some money, you're like, dang, what's the first thing you bought? I was in my, you know what's crazy? I didn't even realize it because it was so unreal. I was driving in my, my test. My Prius. Prius. Yep. You know about that. That's my baby driving in that thing.


And I was driving from Atlantic City to Baltimore and in a Prius. Yeah. How long it take you a day? No, bro, bro. Ho one thing about the Prius, one of the best cars in the world. A Prius 57 miles per gallon. I know. Unbelievable. It one of the, one of the smoothest cars I drive, I used to tip. That's how I came up. Me and Gil used to be in a Prius running back and forth to New York bar, all that stuff. Yeah. But it, it go 10 miles per hour. It's that. No, it don't. That's a lot. Prius is one of the best cars that I ever had in my life. I'm talking about it smooth. It's, it's straight to the point. You know what I mean? It was, it was just great. Prius holler at me. But, but what I'm saying is I'm driving the, the, the DocuSign come across where the adrenal sign it.


I'm just driving. I forgot about it, man. And then it was like, me and the Gil was in Atlanta. That's when I first caught Covid. Right. I caught the Covid. I ain't know what it was. I was just in Atlanta. I was sweating in the bed all night. I woke up and I, I don't know what I had just check my account to see Sean. I fell out the bed. I was like, damn. The first thing I thought about, I ain't gonna hold you. I said, I gotta go some money up. Lemme go buy some shit. Right. No, I was hitting people off. Grandma, mama was hitting people off and stuff like that. But it was like, I ain't even know what to do with it man. 'cause I'm like, damn. And people come and luckily a couple months later, I called one of my advisors, John Miranda, shout out to World Wild West, man.


Plug me up with John. Man. Shout out to Uncle West too, man. I called him. I said, listen, what's up with taxes, man? How did that go? He said, come to my office while I went to his office. He said, I'm gonna get anything. He called me like a couple days later, I almost crashed my car. I said, you mean to tell me that I gotta give somebody named Sam all this money? I don't even know them. What I, I I was, I was so mad at John. I'm sorry, John. I was mad. He knew I was mad. 'cause anytime he called me at, I used to be like, what? Every time I seen this number, I got scared because I'm like, I'm like, I gotta get these people all this money. He said, you gotta take it now. We gotta, we gonna take it now, put it up, make sure we, and we gonna pay early.


That's how You know you get real money when you gotta pay quarterly. Oh yeah. Yeah. So I'm like, I'm in the car. I'm just holding my heart and everything. I'm just laying there. Like I had a heart attack. I ain't know. I was like George Jefferson, because I'm like all this money, So you know, but you be Fred Sample, I'm coming doing your we Fred and all that. So, so then it was like, man, you buy shit, man. You buy shit. You do your thing. Then it's like, you bought everything out. You did everything. You got a watch, you got all this stuff. It just, it don't mean that, it don't, it like, I don't even, I ain't even gonna front, I don't even look at the money no more like that. I'm more excited about just getting a deal and just negotiating shit. That's what get me just to see that I done it right. And to show that I really, everything that I educated myself on this working.


But I don't really care about money like that. What's the date of life like now? Dating is, dating can be real easy and it could be real hard because you a meal ticket out this joint and a lot of people is looking at you like that. But that's, that's always been easy for me. You know what I'm saying? But I ain't date when I was broke. Why not? Man, I remember one time Gil called me, right? I'm in the crib. Right. And tody his wife, they, they laughing. I ain't know she, I ain't know he was on speaker phone. So he said, damn, what you doing man? I'm ready to go on the date real quick, man. He said, damn, where you going? Right here. I'm on this computer man going on the date, man. I got a little, little x and XX. Right. I'm, I'm talking. She like, what? Why are you, so when I first came home, I used to shake the dice a lot.


You know what I mean? Jerk shake my dice because it was like, man, you need money to date and all that shit. Yeah. And, and he was like, man, you, I said, no, bro, I ain't got time to be sending nobody's face when I gotta get my life together. See, I'm one of them boys. That's extremists.

First of all, congratulations on being on the New York Times bestseller list memoir.


Armed with good Intentions. What made you decide to write a book? You know, everybody feel as though when you get there in life or you, you, you have a moment where as though success come, everybody say, oh man, you just perfect your life better than mine. My life ain't better than yours. The only thing I wanted to show in the book was that all with good intentions is filled with a bunch of losses. A loss, loss, loss, loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. That's the average life. But I think a lot of times people don't understand the only thing different between me and you is I ain't stopped. That's it. I just ain't stopped. Even in the darkest moments, I say I gotta get back up. I gotta figure it out. When I'm sitting in the cell, I'm like, when I get out, I gotta do better.


You know what I mean? And that was my whole thing. Like I didn't, I, one of the main reasons I didn't stop, I wanted to get outta jail and show my grandma that I could do right before she leave this earth. 'cause she always see me do wrong. And she always believed in me. She always said, you going get it. You gonna figure it out, you gonna figure. And she, you know, her whole thing was like, you can't do wrong. Right. You need to start doing. Right. Right. Wow. And so later on in life, it catch you because all she would tell me was that nanny would tell me lowest people. She would tell me, boy, I came to Philadelphia with two kids and $10. I got my house in 1963. I worked every day. I couldn't even afford.


She said I couldn't afford a refrigerator, but I got my other stuff. So Father Washington from the church he signed. So I gave me a refrigerator. I worked every day. I never, I never took a day off. And by 1978 I owned my house. Like you come from some, you come from some great humble beginning. You come from, you come from a good this jeans of mines. And I always seen a grind, you know, to the day, even though I take care of things. But it's like she, she said, baby, she didn't tell me from jail. Ain't ain't nothing ever get cut off in this house. Wow. You know better. You know? Right. But everything that she's telling me, she's outnumbered with the street culture. So I, I'm, I'm, you know, nanny tell, look, boy, you she seen me, boy, you could do better. And I remember I used to lie to her when I was in prison.


I used to tell her all the time. She used to be like, listen, I ain't gonna be here when you get back baby. 'cause I, I would never tell her how much time I was doing. I would tell her I'm coming home every year. And she'd be like, I ain't gonna be here when you get back baby. And I'd like nanny, I'm gonna be there. I'm be like, nanny, I'll be there. I'll be there next year. Next year. She said, you told me next year, three years ago. Because I'm sitting here thinking, I'm sitting here thinking that nanny wasn't, nanny wasn't as swift as she is. But I learned later she was swift. But I just wanted to get out and show her that I could do good in life before she expired, before she leave. 'cause everything she told me, she was right about it. And I wanted her to know that she 90 years old now. Wow. Yeah. When You're writing this memoir, did you have any idea that it would end up on the New York Times bestselling List?


I never had a doubt. I never had a doubt. And the reason I never had a doubt was because you don't have a lot of transparency in things. Hmm. And this days you have somebody write a, have a book out or whatever. But it don't be the raw of them. It don't be, it don't be coming from a aspect of I'm gonna just tell the truth about what I got going on. Whether, Whether you like it or not. Because everything is perfect. My life ain't perfect. Right. Your life ain't perfect. Life ain't perfect. Correct. So I was like, you know, I always felt that in at, it wasn't just about the book. The work that come after the book come out is to go into all the shout out to all, all listen, shout out to all the black bookstores out there.


It was a man, let me tell you something, Shannon, when I tell you they had my back. Mm. You know, whether it was Baldwin and CO in New Orleans, whether it was uncle, uncle, uncle Bobby's in Philadelphia, Malik books in la, mahogany books in DC The list goes on and on. Kendricks and down in, down in Houston. I think we forgot about that. A lot of times we forget about reading, but it's a lot of strong black bookstores out there that really helped us. So I wanna shout out to them. Support your local black bookstores. 'cause they supported me in a major way. Right. You mentioned earlier it says a lot of our life is lost. Lost. And only in the song all we do is win, win, win. Is that true?


Only in a Song. Yeah. That's fake. Yeah. But you have to And so is that what you wanted your story to? That's, do you think that's why your story resonates because of what you've gone through? And a lot of other people have gone through similar things. Maybe they didn't go to prison, but they suffered a lot of losses, but somehow found a way to turn it around and get some wins. And I Yeah. Is that, and it's the connection of that. Everything, everything. Like, you might even see the, the small, the upbringing of the losses. But since I came on from prison, I showed you 37 years old. Every 37-year-old man getting outta prison. In my grandma, middle ri I'd make videos outta nanny, a nanny middle room. Mm. You know what I'm saying? So it was like, and the only reason I could, I could make parole to nanny middle room, rest in peace to my Aunt Ruby. That was my baby.


She, she had a heart attack. She died in that room. Mm. So I was able to make parole there. And, and I, and I showed you my videos. I, I wasn't perfect. I showed you living in nanny house. I showed you running down the streets. I showed you on the subway, the bus. You seen me just, most of it wasn't all perfect, but it was me. There've been a lot of rapper at the Gone Serve time. Why do you think that's such a common thing in the rap industry? In our community, rap has always been an expression of the environment. It been a, a lot of times rap was a escape for us. Okay. Growing up, you know, it changed a lot growing up. It was a, you know, personal expression. It was a documenting of the environment that we come from. A lot of people was, were storytellers of what they seen.


We didn't, we, we didn't really do this. You know, NAS never did what he's taught. He, but he talked about a lot of people didn't do this. As you could see, ice Cube was smart. Dre was smart. These dudes were smart. But they just talked about, I think in, in rap it became a challenging sport. A violent challenge in sport. To the point of where's dope if I say something, oh yeah, you really, that I'm a challenge. I'm gonna see if you really a kid, I'm gonna see, oh man, we gotta die about this shit. So that's what came about. And I think a lot of times there's a lot of aggression that come with it. And sometimes we speak our own, we speak our own fate. Mm. And it, and you know, and some people talk about dying. Like, it's cool. Like, on the aspect of like, when I die, you know, make sure you, So you know, power In the tongue.


Yeah. It's power in the tongue. And we gotta live out the rap sometime.

Do you feel like rap glorifies prison? You know what's crazy? It don't glorify prison. I'm not gonna say it all the way because it definitely, it definitely could teach you how to get to prison. It's definitely a directory. You know what I mean? It's definitely a directory. It's a map. Huh? It's a how to guy. It's a, it's a map. Right. But it don't glorify it because most people that rap about it never been to prison. Mm. These dudes never been to prison. Oh. So it's like, I ain't gonna say glor, but it's de it definitely direct you to a cell. But why don't you think that guys have learned? Because you've seen guys that have gone there learn from their mistakes and not try to go back. But you see these young guys, as you mentioned, they try to be like, and they talk about things they don't know anything about.


And they feel like they need to do something in order to get that for real. That cache like, I'm really about this life. You know what it is? I believe that when you young, you was young. I was young. You don't believe nothing that anybody older tell you. 'cause you think they disconnected from the reality of life as it is now. Not knowing it was once a reality of life that they was living in themselves when they was younger. Right. So they're just trying to shear, you know, if you tell me, man, it's don't, don't go down that block. It's a, it is a hole right there in the ground. Like, man, I can get around that hole. So it's, it's hard sometimes when you are young. 'cause we did the same thing. Yes. We just didn't do it to the level of maybe violence or stupidity that some people do it today.


But I just think it's hard for people to hear it and they think it's not going to be me. Yeah. Why you did 20, but og they ain't gonna be me. I'm smarter than that. What you going to do? Right. You know what I mean? So until they get there, and then I'm, now I'm talking to 'em on the phone. 'cause they uncle called me, yo called Wallo. Man, you was right. Oh. Oh. So it took you to get 30 years for you to be right. You, you, you, you, you still, you still got it right. You still, you still gotta spark. Why you, Why you couldn't learn from Wallo experience? Why did you have to go experience it for yourself? He already did it. He already told you the, the path that you was traveling down where it was gonna land you. But you didn't wanna hear that. And, and you gotta think about this.


The street game is a game. It's a game. Okay. If you play Monopoly, how many people go in? Probably one. If, if you, if you become an athlete of a game, how many of y'all really gonna go to the NFL? How many of y'all really gonna go to the NBA? How many of y'all do you know how many people play basketball in America? And how many people is in the league? It's not a lot. Right? How many people is in football? It's not a lot. How many people? So you gotta think about this. It's a game that The majority of the people lose. And the reality is like, I always tell people, this is me from me being in prison. You show me 10 dudes in a gang, or you show me 10 dudes that's from a corner. You show me 10 dudes, I'm gonna show you. Seven dudes is going to tell on them anyway. So the mask don't mean nothing.


None of this, all this stuff is ka everything that we thought it was is cat because we live in a world where everybody is. So they choosing them first. Do you think little Bobby is going to go to jail when they ready to get him 15, 20, whatever. And he never been to jail before. You think he leaving Keisha with that nice little sexy, beautiful body, right? You think he leaving her and his mom gonna come in that interrogation room? Bobby, you better tell what they done. We see it all the time. But we think my homies ain't going tell on that. That ain't gonna be me. Your homies gonna tell on you. They gonna to tell. Do you think like what, what about, you know, used to have this show? I think it was called Scared Straight. Yeah. Something That was my show.


You know what I'm saying? It's like, okay, we gonna take you because we see where you guys are headed. You, I mean, a lot of you guys are in alternative schools or you in juvie. And so we gonna show you where you're headed. This is the, this is the, the recipe that you're cooking up right now is gonna lead to this perfect dish right here. So we gonna give you an opportunity to see where you don't want to be. Do you think they think it's cool to be in prison? You said a lot of these guys that rap about it ain't never been There. No. You know what's crazy? I'm not even gonna hold you and it and, and, and I'm gonna just talk about me growing up. Me growing up, I seen some vicious, do you remember Blood and Blood Out? You remember the penitentiary movie? I seen some vicious movies. I seen it on on the TVs and all that stuff. But I thought I was smart enough. I don't think a lot of people think they gonna make it there.


Right. So until you make it there and you like me, I get there and I'm like, I get to prison. And I, you know, when that, when that big gate closed behind me and I'm on that bus, I'm praying to every guy that I could think of, like, please help me. Please, please don't let these people take me. They don't take my innocence please. Right, right. I'm scared to death because, you know, I see, you know, when I walk through the hallway first after they tell me as I get outta the shower, dude, tell him, wash it up the shower like a minute. Get up outta there, wash them balls, get that crabs and lights up off you Get up, throw your stuff off. You get your little box of lady say in case of emergency where you want your body sent. I'm like, what type of shit? I didn't, Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought I just happened to do some time. I ain't y no die. I'm a juvenile that just committed a dope crime.


And they certify me as a dope. Whoa. Why we gotta die? Like, what's going on? Why, why I gotta die. Please don't let, like could you call my mom and let me get out? Right. She peeped my, she peeped the fear in my eyes. And she said she reworded the word no baby. Like in case of a she said baby to me too. She let, she, she's peeped that I'm really a kick. She like, in case of anything happened, who you want us to call? Like emerging health. And then I grabbed that box. I went in that hallway. Greatest full prison. I seen the biggest black man I ever seen in he'll make you look like a midget. He was so big. It was like he was lifting weights in places. I didn't know you could lift weights. He was so big coming out the joint with a tank top on. And when I seen him, it's like he coming, I'm, I looked down at the ground, I'm like, oh my God, he going to get me.


Yeah. Because I'm not, I'm not one of these dudes out here that's talking like, I thought my ass was on the line when I went to prison. I was scared. Right. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not telling you. Like, I was tough. All that tough shit that I threw, I knew and I thought I was on the street. That shit went out the way when I got to the penitentiary because I'm like, somebody gonna get, I always thought that somebody was gonna get me. And then now you start, you realize that you not doing days, you doing years, you doing decades. Ooh it get real. Ooh. Ooh. That shit get real. But Is it, is it the allure that got you into it? Was it the allure of fast money, quick money? Was it a lifestyle that you wanted to have that you weren't willing to go say, work a, a a, a fast food job or, and work your way up?


What was it about that life that attracted Wallo To it? Because when I grew up, I realized quick that America respected successful criminal. Mm. So when I'm sitting on the steps, Shannon and I see Mike pull up with the binge, the gold chain on the music blasting. And when he come up to get the most beautiful, he pulling up in this binge to get the most beautifulest girl in the neighborhood. She's the most beautifulest girl in the neighborhood. When he pull up. I noticed that. I ain't just noticing, I ain't watching him. I'm watching Ms. Jackson, Ms. Brown, Ms. Green, you know what they saying to him? Hey baby.


I'm like, oh shit. And then as the girl get in the car, they all speaking to, Hey ma'am. But when I see Mr. Mr Mr. James come home from work and he walking down the street, he's a plumber. He all dirty. Don't nobody speak to him. Mr. Brown. Ms. Jackson, miss, they don't speak to him. This in the eighties, this Showtime baby I'm talking about. This is, I'm talking about, I didn't see Mr. James name on the marquee. I seen the dude with the Benz's name on the marquee. The lights is shining. I'm talking about, this is prime time baby. He got the chain on the pinky ring, the Rolex watch on the music blasting ice team Hot roller coming outta the Benzs. This shit is movie shit. I'm like, I got to be him. He's a superhero. Not Mr. James. Yeah. They speak to him. They look down on me. They Look down on Mr. James.


Mr. James. He's a hardworking man in the ghettos of America. Black man. I said, I gotta be him. I got to be him. You went Viral when you broke into tears telling Lil Durk not to retaliate in King Barnes death. You know, you, you, you know, it was so emotional because Dirk, he said, I need you to come here. Right. He said, we could do it in Miami, whatever, but I need you to come here. 'cause I need you to talk to these. That's what he told me. He said, I need you to talk to 'em while I need you to talk to 'em. I said, all right. I got 'em. And when I get there, I, I didn't know it was gonna be that many. It was like a hundred of 'em. We in the basement in Chicago, it's a hundred of them and them niggas, they ready to ride.


Yeah. No. They just was there for, you know. Okay. They Wanted to hear what you wanted To say. No, they wasn't, it wasn't even that. They didn't even know why they was there. Dirk was like, we gonna do it in the hood. Okay, I want you to holler at them. Boom, boom, boom. So I'm like, I got you. When I got there, I'm like, he like, man listen, I need you to holler at him. It just so happened that when I'm talking to him, I understand. 'cause I'm talking to a couple of 'em on the side. And I understand that nothing is more important than the ghetto than revenge. Revenge is king. Yes. Closest thing to God. Because the black man is willing to die about his ego. The ego killed more black men than any other disease. Any nothing killed black men more than the ego. That ego of you hit me, Shannon. People saw that. I can't let you go. You gotta die about this shit.


Mm. And my mama raised me. So I grew up soft. I ain't had no structure of no father there. So I'm just emotional when I, so when I'm in there, I'm telling them I had to, it was, it was emotional for me. 'cause I'm letting him know I the, the man that killed my brother, I forgave him. Am I a coward? Am I a punk? What? I don't know what that shit mean. But I knew that forgiving him mean that I was willing to live for my brother in a environment where we celebrate dying for somebody. I said, no, I'm going to live for my brother, my grandma, my brother, kids my mama. I'm going to live for them. Because don't nobody talk about that. But I know that I'm gonna just be straight up. I know that I'm not built to die right now because I know it's more things that I gotta do.


And I know I got a responsibility. That was my older brother. You think what I'm saying? Right. So it's like I gotta step up. I gotta be a man. So I gotta think as a man would think not as a street would think that would die about his ego and leave his babies, leave his mama, you know, tear down the community about the ego. My ego wasn't built like that. I wasn't that strong to have that type of ego. I wasn't cut like that.

You Mentioned that you had to forgive your brother's killer. How long did it take you? Because they say forgiveness is not for the person that wronged an individual. The forgiveness is for the person that's been wronged. Maymay came to see me. So my niece, she come to see me the week after that Dad get killed. This, the first time I meet this little, little, I'm talking about she was like five, four or five. She was like probably four or five. But she was like 50 mm. So when she came in in, she run around the visiting room, she jumped on my lap. She said, oh, will you come home? You not, you not leaving, you not coming back, is you?


I'm like, no, I'm not coming back. She said, I need you to take me here. She telling me all this stuff. And my nephew there too. I'm just talking to him and I'm like, damn this somebody finally counting on me. Mm. Somebody looking to me in the way. I never had nobody look to me. You see what I'm saying? In that way, my little brother, I was always in the penitentiary, so my little brother jal, we really didn't have the time. So I'm like, damn, this little person looking to me like that. She putting a lot of power and a lot of energy on me. And so I already had it in my mind because I'm gonna just tell you, I'm gonna just tell you something Shannon. I'm not built like that to go kill no black man. I'm not built like that.


I'm not designed like that. I'm not tough like that. I'm not ruthless like that. I'm not heartless like that. That's just not me. I I and my worst is fear in the history of life. I don't give a fuck how I die. I don't care what happened. But if a black man killed me, you going hear my scream until life and for everybody. You going hear my pain. You gonna hear you going, you going to my tears is gonna flood the ghettos of America. I don't care about nothing else but don't let me go out like that. Mm. So I said to myself, I ain't built like that to to be the why want you there. Because I don't know. Listen, I don't know what happened that night, why it happened.


Only thing I know is my brother got shot. He ran into my grandma house, he opened the door, He died of the arms. I ain't built like that to see nobody else crawl like that. I ain't built like that. I ain't got like that Shannon. I'm just now I ain't designed like that just because you're hurting Annie. I don't wanna hurt your grandma for what? If I hurt your grandma, I wouldn't. Shit gonna stop. It's a continuous cycle. You said that by not retaliating, it gave you the freedom to spend time with your family. Whew.


When I got outta jail, right. I ain't have a lot, but I had everything because I remember something back in the day in the ghetto, we ain't had nothing but we had each other. So we had everything. Everything. So I'm like, damn she, I told her I was gonna take it to these places that I ain't even know. I ain't even know. I ain't even know I had to, I ain't even know I had to take it to him. Right. Because I ain't know these places. I just was telling her I'm in jail. She's like, you gonna take me here? Yeah, I know that. I'm just listening to her on the phone. I got you. I'm gonna take you there. So when I get there, I'm like, you ain't telling me this shit costs all this money. You know, you know I'm want a bunch. I ain't know. We, I, it said five below. I go in there and spend $50. God damn. Yeah.


They said five below. I'm thinking I'm gonna get a bunch of stuff from $5. Right. So she got me in there. Mom, don't be buying all of 'em. I got to, I gotta, I just wanted to show up, not just financially, I wanna show up mentally emotional. I wanted to show up for them and that was my whole thing. So it was like bang. That was all it was about was living for them and, and and being able to see them, them to see me, for me to be an example to my niece and nephew and them. And even for my grandma. Like, boy, you, you could do something with yourself. 'cause I wanted to prove nanny. Right. She always said you special. But I'm like, special. What you mean? Why I'm, why would I be special? I'm thinking she crazy telling me I'm special. I live in the ghetto.


I didn't know you could be special coming from the ghetto. Dirk said this mofo really dropped in tears for this issue. Do you feel like you heard what you were saying? Do you feel like the guy, not only did they listen, because a lot of times people listen to respond, but did they listen to understand what you were saying? I hollered at a lot of 'em afterwards. Some of 'em would call me. It's not about them listening, it's about conditioning. It's about environmental. You can listen to everything that I say, but a lot of time as I'm still growing, I don't have the resources to remove you from the danger that you are up against every day. A lot of things, these young brothers they do here, they smart.


A lot of 'em are smart. But environmental, their environment don't allow them to grow because I can't move outta this environment right here. And I know them dudes down them block, they want to kill me and gotta protect myself. I want to kill. So it is deep. We tell these kids a lot of things. We, and, and all we do is criticize young black male every way possible. We criticize 'em as much as possible, but we don't, we don't bring no resources. You know, I mean, people make money off of just criticizing us and talking down on not just us, it's black people. But they don't, they don't got no, okay, you criticizing us, you got all these, these gigantic platforms. What we doing is cool Shannon. But it's, they got huge media platforms where they, they just want to tear the people down in the black community, but they ain't coming up with no solution and they ain't bringing no funding.


So I could tell these young brothers this, that, and the third, but they still gotta take care of they baby. And I gotta figure out the only way that they know. And in order to really take somebody to another level, you gotta have time, energy, and resources to deprogram 'em So you can reprogram 'em. The programmer was hit the, the, the, the, the dehumanization of black people by black people was strong. This is some shit that we done. It started from when the little boy is young and he playing on the swing and he fall, he start crying, boy, be tough. Don't cry. We are taught to ignore and bury our emotions and our feelings and our vulnerability. That's not cool. That's not tough. So all that, all that stuff right there is a real big programming that took place by us alone.


So how do we come up outta that? It's gonna be deep. It's gonna take a lot. How does one outgrow the environmental aspects, the constraints in which he or she is brought up in, if they're not removed from that environment, because the fish is only gonna get so big if the tank is not conducive for it to grow. A tree is only gonna get so big if their environment is not conducive. So if you just put a, if you put a tree in a tub, it's only gonna be get as big as the tub allow. Now if you take that tree out of a tub and let it grow in a a 50 acre field, it can grow. It can flourish. How difficult is it to reprogram? You said reprogram so I can program in the right aspect. How difficult is it to do that In the history of our community, the people that was able to do that?


It was multiple, it was multiple. It was, it was a few, a few. Educational relocation is the greatest thing that happened to college. See a lot of people talk, oh, you don't need college. Oh, we understand that. You might come out have bills, but college expose you to other cultures. See the, the, the hood lack exposure to the world. And a lot of times you don't, you don't never think about everybody that left every, mostly everybody that left. You never really see 'em come back. 'cause they see, they meet other towns they go to, they get relationships with people and it's just, and they go, they go and they see the world. They're the ones that come back most of the time. Them, people that go and get the education, they're the strongholds of the family.


They're the ones that the family count on. Call your uncle, Call your aunt. She down there, she's a doctor, she's a lawyer. She the, we gotta start educating ourself, making sure the kids is educated, putting books in their hand over tablets. We gotta start there because I'm not gonna say we had to point no return, but some people's just stuck and they using that as a badge of amm. Sometimes in our hood, ignorance is a badge of honor is a cool thing. Nobody want to, you know, we can't say that about 'cause anytime black people say things about black people, they ain't supposed to say that out loud or whatever. I don't know how that shit can, Yeah, But sometimes it's a badge of honor. Oh, I'm this. Think about it. We, we put on a pedestal, the criminals American way.


The American way. At the end of the day, we love the successful criminal. We love Tony Soprano, we love Scarface, we love Michael Coone. This is proof. The ju the judge, the lawyer, the district attorney, the presidents, all them people. They love the movies. That's, they, they going. So the programming is deep. How difficult is it to really break a cycle when You know, you see a father that goes to jail, he had brothers that go to jail, and now you see a kid that all the thing that he knows is disruption, corruption. How difficult is That, Walter? I'm, I'm a, I'm a product of generational incarceration.


My stepfather hip, he was in Dallas Penitentiary in the eighties. Me and him were cellmates in Dallas Penitentiary by 1998. By 2005, me and my brother Steve were cellmates in Dallas Penitentiary. And there was a picture of me, it's inside of the book me hip and Steve on a visit when I was a kid. And I want, we all wound up being in that same prison. Wow.

It is a cycle because prison is, prison is a, you gotta think about this, this, there's the ghettos of America build communities. And when I say the ghettos of America build communities, this is what happened. As we do so much crime in the inner cities of America. There are small towns in America, middle of Pennsylvania, middle of Ohio, middle of California, where oh, population is up. Then one day you just see this landfill, you see some construction workers come and then a truck. These, these 18 wheelers come, bunch of them. And they start putting these new prisons together like Legos.


Then the gas station, they build a gas station. Then the Walmart park up, then the hotel pop up. We building communities. And I'm gonna tell you a story, deep one. It was this guard named Steve. I used to go back and forth with him on the tier because he just, I used to always speak up because he would go in people's cells when they in the yard and do checking and you ain't supposed to be nobody. I used to say little stuff. So we used to battle one day he set me down, I go to the, to the bubble to get some legal mail. 'cause when you get the legal mail, you gotta sign for it. And he said something strong to me. I never forgot this. He said, come here peoples, that's my last name.


I said, what man? What you want man? I'm just signing for my mail. He said, look, he opened up his shirt in, in between his shirt and his vest. 'cause he had a stab proof vest. He pulled out the envelope. The envelope was folded. He opened the envelope. It was a picture. He put the picture down, says I'm signing for my what's name. And he opened my legal mail. I stopped when before I leave, I stopped. He said, you in the homies man. You in the homies being sarcastic using the word homie. You in the homies took care of you thanks to you in the homies. I'm like, I looked at the picture. It was his son standing in front of a big house with a pickup truck and a big boat there. Said you and the homies got me that usually I have a verbal little verbal spar with, but he, he stuck me that day.


I couldn't, I was wounded. So I just walked back to the cell and sat on the bed and I said, damn. And me, none of the homies never bought our mom no house. We never sent our kids to college. But you know how many kids, you know, how many homes and kids is going to college. That me and the homies is taking me and the homies doing that. But it ain't going to our community. We sending, we we taking care of families. We taking care of generational. Because in prisons you have with nepotism, you got the warden, the warden brother is the security captain. His other brother is the lieutenant. His sister is the head of the medical.


The other cousin is the head of the gymnasium. The other cousin is the activity director. The other cousin is the head of the workforce. And you walk inside of prison, you see 15 family members that go home every day and 15 family members that don't. That's the prison system in America. So it it, it, it it is deep, right? It's, it is deep and it's gonna take a lot to break that. Why is it that a lot of times that you see rappers and they rap about that and they've made money millions and they still go back to that culture. Why can't they let that go? Why can't they escape that one?


Because in the ghetto, everything is about ego. You gotta prove to the dudes the ops or the whoever they is. Everybody wanna prove to the people that they are doing better than that. They still real. Mm you mean you real, you just bought your mom a house. That's real enough. But it, it gotta be, it got, you know, people wanna prove that I ain't no chump. I ain't no church. Listen, lemme tell you something man. You just wrapped some songs, right? I'm talking about you went in the studio, rap some songs. You got that publishing money, you got the, you know, a bunch of money spec. It depends on how your deal structure, you got all that tour money. You got 10, 15 million in a bank. I think it's about time to start being a pussy man.


I think it's about time to start being a pussy. I'm just being real because, you know, I'm not the one designed and I'm not built like that to tell you some bullshit Shannon Right. To say be tough. No. Everybody else telling you to be tough. I'm not gonna tell you that. I think because all the rich people, I don't think they, they trying to worry about what somebody's saying about 'em. No. From a neighborhood that's still trying to figure out life. So I think it's cool to be not be that tough no more. Man. Master P said something last night on our live show. He said sometimes man, people be trying to get, trying to get you to trick off your position. Like you in a great position and they get you. Oh No, no. A lot of people foul out. They, they, they they get you to crash out. Yeah. Because You said you told them say, look, you gonna finesse yourselves outta this position your family life.


You got your family in a great situation and you gonna let somebody finess you out this. But, But, but what did I tell you early in the interview? The ego is the number one killer of black man. It's the number one finesser out of the position. Like Shannon. How many people say some crazy stuff about you? Just imagine if you just, you know, if you, if you, if you just reacted to everything, a lot of times it don't even be, a lot of times it don't even be that people don't like you. It be that people can't get around you and utilize your resources and utilize you. It don't, a lot of people, you see 'em, you might see somebody say something on the joint and I know you got a ma memory. You be like, they'll see you Shannon. What's up? You be like, why you say that stuff about me man? No man. I was just, no man.


A lot of people just be wanting to hug Shannon. They just be wanting some love. They just be wanting to get embraced and they don't know how to go about that. You utilize the proper channels to say, damn Shannon, I'm trying to do something with you man at the time. Right at the time. Right. Can I get on your show Right or whatever it may be. People don't know how to do that. You know what, you recently sat down with Kodak back and you had a conversation with him about his drug use. Well lemme ask you a question. How do you determine who? I mean if they reach out, you willing to sit down and talk to anybody? Chop it up, have convo with anybody that reaches out. How do you go about who you sit down and talk to and impart wisdom on? Oh no. You could feel that shit. You could feel it because when you doing it you can just feel it. You can feel and you know, I still know what's going on.


You moving around, you know what's going on. And everybody with these artists is sad. Most of they, most of they teams and management's and pussies, they got a bunch of yes man around them. Mm. A person's not, they care more about getting a check off of them than this person living. These people don't be giving a about these young bloods 'cause they don't come from it. So they don't understand it. Now the ones that don't come from it and they're afraid of it, cool. But if you come from it, it's your duty to put the check in on them. Like, come on man.

But You know, you just feel the energy of what to tell. You know How, So you, you, you talk, you kind of touched on this, a circle of friends and I'm a firm believer that you have people in your corner that tell you what you need to know, not what you want to hear. Now you said something very interesting because see if I tell you what you need to know, you gonna stop the bus Wallo and ask me to get off bro. I need that reflective shine.

It went number two in comedy, on podcasts, on Apple and number four in all categories in like seven hours. I said, we got something baby. We got something. And we just, we just, we just started knocking. I said, 'cause this is what I'm gonna do. I I'm going to go, I'm gonna get a deck created and I'm gonna take all our social media and this is the business of podcasts. I'm gonna take our social media following. 'cause he had a a million, I had a half a million. I said, I'm gonna take our social media following. I'm gonna put that on the deck and I'm gonna tell sponsors, people that wanna be sponsors.


I'm gonna tell 'em this. If you sponsor on this show, every time we put a clip up on, on our page, because a million dollars worth a game, that's gonna be a million dollars worth of game page on Gilly and Wallo page. We are gonna tag sponsored by Shannon Sharp Show whatever, whoever you is. He said, alright, do your thing. I I said, all I got you. One of the first places I went was to a funeral home.

So a minute, this how I was selling it, I was selling minutes by, you get on each show, you get a minute worth of advertisement, your logo gonna pop up, your number gonna pop up. Everything gonna pop up and I'm gonna run it down. So she said, all right, cool.


Pay me the money. I said, all right, let me go. I went and done the ad. By the time I got to the second a read, 'cause we only do four shows a month, one a week. By the time I got to the second a she called me Wallo stop. I said, what's up? She said, I ain't got enough work. I'm getting too many bodies baby. I'm getting too many bodies. Because the episode, come on this episode, A million dollars worth a game is brought to you by Boy's Funeral Home. One thing about life, you're gonna die one day and when you die, you wanna be laying in the casket looking like you living even though you dead. You wanna be looking like you going to get up outta the casket. You wanna be looking like, wow, I wanna look like that. Even by the living while you laying in the ca I'm breaking it down. She was like, it was that next thing Springfield Hyundai, I go to them bang.

I wasn't going off of CPMs and all that other stuff you doing. I'm creating my own industry and business. You gotta, you gotta know your value. When you bring value to value it increase your value. I knew that we was valuable. I knew people, I knew people wanted, I knew they wanted brand visibility 'cause we was cultural. Right. But I also, I'm also a good partner of wheres though I wanted to be mutually beneficial. We doing business. I need to make sure you getting take care of forget what you giving me. Right. I I'm not going to feel right if I know damn Shannon gave us all this money man. And we didn't do what do field obligation.

We had them did we negotiating with them, we negotiating with bars Still it was, and it it, it turned us up. And we, but at the same time, I'm already getting the money from our own sponsorship. I'm already doing it. I'm getting a bunch of money. We doing it, we killing it. I'm doing all the, all the brand deals, all that stuff. We was killing it. Normally people say don't do anything with family, but you and Gil seem to work. What, how did you know that it was gonna work and you guys go 50 50 on everything?

I could check him and it's done right there. He could check me and it's done right there. 'cause if we wrong, we wrong. If we right, we right. We don't, and then we not in competition with each other. Like, I'm So you gotta understand this. You gotta understand this. I'm so excited for him right now in this moment because simply because the Eagles is winning. And this dude, when I say he loved the Eagles. Oh yeah man, Listen, when I say he loved the Eagles, he told me, he said, 'cause we was on a bustle with the Boy Scout.


He said, I went and had sex with my wife for a year. If the Eagles could win the Super Bowl, They gotta win by 10 Super Bowl. But that's what he said. So I be so happy that listen, Eagles is my team now. You know what I mean? Right. I don't really, you know, I bounce around. People know I got different teams a year.

I usually bounce around, especially in the playoffs. Oh, they got dropped out in New Jersey. I pulled my jersey out. You right. I, you know what I mean? I don't even know where my jersey's at. But I'm gonna just say that like, we so excited for each other. We always championing each other when we win. That's different bro.


You don't see that. Everybody want to compete with each other. When we supposed to eat with each other. Mm. We just not doing that shit. We ain't built like that. We just not built like that. Wow. What made you guys sign with Bar Stoop? Because talked to Point Noy and he's like, Hey, yeah, we signed the book. We didn't really know. 'cause I mean, culturally and fan base wise, I mean that's not where they, that's not where we are. And, and their culture and their fan base is kind of not where we are. But it's a, it's a match that works. You know? You know why? Because we was going back and forth with Spotify. They was cool. Spotify wanted to boxes in because Spotify, they take you off of YouTube and say you over here now the visuals, you can't put the whole show.


It was like that. I'm like, no. What about our people? Everybody ain't got no money for no subscription for that. Right. Bars too was like, not only we gonna give you the paper, not only do we don't wanna own your ip, but we gonna make sure y'all still stay over there so y'all can do what y'all do. What they y'all want to do. Right. Dave. And when we signed Dave and Erica Nardini was so real when they met up with us, it was like they didn't play. They asked us for a number.

'cause I'm at the table. They said we just 36 month, you know, distribution deal. You know the whole thing said how much I'm thinking I'm popping my shit. I said, 3 million. Cool. She said, all right. Ah, man, you, you, you, hey You know you done screwed up. You know you screwed up. The minute you said 3D said, I didn't even get the 3 million out because I'm like, damn, now I'm sitting there.
