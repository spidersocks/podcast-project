The Volume. Good morning, happy Wednesday. It's five 20 in the Morning. Your favorite sports show here to keep you up to date and everything in the sports world, especially basketball. I'm your host, my name is dj. Will joined this morning by my two brothers to my left. I got Bishop Pinterest to my right, my brother Teague Fellas. Good morning. How y'all living saying Brother? Well I'm feeling good man. We on a championship run again. We yeah. Fit or dear. Oh we got, you know we got clarify the we up here, you know we back's a lot different teams. We back another episode of oh God of the Bucks doing something worthwhile. Turn up. Hey man, championship game yesterday. NBA cup bucks.


Got the D yesterday. 97 to 81 normally. You know what I'm saying By tee rules, you scored less than a hundred. You sad but, but if you score less than hey 90, you real sad. That's a hell of a 81 points in the championship game. Nasty work man. Lou do. He didn't give us nothing yesterday. Shout out to my boy though. We back at it tonight man. That's a good dub for the bucks. I was scared today man. Ain't gonna lie but y Honest with 19 rebounds. It's crazy. Listen man, hell of a game yesterday. First half was very, very competitive. Third quarter. That's where, you know, I'm saying things took a little turn. Let's start, let's start off like you said with the Bucks man we talked about this could change their season and they look like a really good contender right now man.


You know it's crazy. What makes the Bucks actually a really good team is when they played defense and last night they guarded like I watched Giannis, that was the most locked in I seen like Giannis since the championship run. Mm. He was guarding, blocking shots, gear and rebounds and it kind of trickled down through the whole team. I seen Brooke Lopez. Yeah they changed their coverages again. They started sending doubles at SGA every time he came off the pick and roll Brooke was up, Giannis was up. The defender's like, what's it Trent Jr. Yeah, Garrett TR Jr. Had a really big game yesterday. Yeah. He was playing hard on defense to and Prince all those guys was competing and you could see it holding the 81 points.


Yeah, thats so unlikely with a OKC team who really can score the ball. Explosive team for sure. Like you talk about they held them to low, low, low even some of the other rotation players for the bucks like a Joe Green. Yeah. You know people look at him as a liability but he rotated well they play amazing defensive player. He actually a decent defender. Like he competes defensive. Yeah they trying to pick on him but he ain't, he ain't saying nah he ain't going, he ain't going. Also noted without Chris Middleton. Yeah. And I, I think they play well. So like Andre Jackson I think he competed on a defensive end at a high, high level and I think they gonna have to go forward with that lineup. Like Chris Middleton obviously at the two but Andre Jackson at the three 'cause I think he's a primary defender. I know they like Tor and Prince 'cause he could shoot but the athleticism and the way he guard y'all gonna need him.


Yeah. Especially when you go against Boston. Yeah y'all yeah especially need him. I I think he defends way better than to and Prince but I think to and Prince obviously shoots 10 times better. Yeah because they, they treating him like self-check. I think that's the the counteract with him. They treating him like they used Thibo Ceal lotion for a second. Like you gonna have to shoot that. Yeah. But if he learned how to play in a dunker 'cause obviously Brooke Lopez shoot all threes so he gives you another person that stretches the floor but if he learned how to play in a dunker and get some cuts and dunks like that and he did that last night, he ended up cutting and getting a couple layups. I think that's a new player that they can unlock for sure. Listen man we talked about Damien Lilly, you've been saying all the song people slept on him, especially when he was doing the season early. We talked about the bucks they done turned it around but Dame killed all season.


Yeah And he had 23 yesterday but the way he got to that 20 like in the moments he did bro. Like the way that him anda set they turns picking apart the defense bro is special. Dame is still very, very lead bro. Ah nah he tied five point guard in the league. We Ain't never even slept on that. It is just, we always just confused on how they was gonna be compatible with each other on the court. Yeah. So hopefully it look like they catching a stride or they figuring it out. It's good to see them embracing each other too though. So Yeah. I at least they like each other when I look at that duo I can start seeing that like Dam figured it out like all right I'm gonna let Giannis be Giannis but when Giannis is out the game I'm, I'm gonna turn it up but when he in the game I'm gonna play off him. And I seen that last night he was giving ball to Giannis.


Giannis will make his move. Giannis was doing a great job of kicking it out too. He wasn't like over forcing the issue. Yeah. Like sometimes that he do and they just had a great game yesterday. Yeah I was gonna say that's the one thing I liked that I saw from both of them. Dame has been doing it well just showcase more because he's in Milwaukee with it but anytime there's a double they're accepting the double and making that pass and it ain't even like a hesitant Ah it's like nah I'm making the right reads. Yeah and the confidence in the players even obviously they ain't gonna make every shot but like you said like the AJ Greens even with the Andre J like they're shooting that ball confidently. Yeah. Trent Jr made some big shots. Like you said he ran off a smooth 10. He Yeah I think they found a recipe to be a good team but they just gotta continue to guard. I don't know if that was just 'cause the odds was on him, it was a big game or whatever.


They felt like locking up. Yeah they felt like locking up I 14,000 facts. If they continue to guard like that shit we gonna see them in the Eastern conference finals for sure. Man listen this is the team that we thought they could be now on the flip side for OKC young team is just the moment too big for them but they just run across the team that was just better than them. Nah, they gonna struggle. Like if you can make it a tough night for SGA Jalen my favorite player. Jalen Williams got a show if he could actually be the guy like and last night was one of those moments they needed him to step up and have one of them nights and yeah bro. Yeah and he couldn't and and not for lack of trying 'cause he was definitely getting him f the shot.


Oh He was trying but it was just one of those games that they couldn't find it. But I don't think OKC will ever shoot that bad from the three. Hell No bro. Historically bad. Yeah they, they shot the ball very, very bad. I don't know if it was Milwaukee Defense or them just missing shots. I'm gonna go with them missing shots 'cause throughout the whole game it was still a close game until they just couldn't buy a bucket For you to shoot 15% from the three and still be within the range of winning you. Yeah I don't think they'll ever shoot that bad. Yeah and Lou Dot I'm gonna kick your ass man. Lou dot I mean hey Lou dot J had a bad night too though. He did. Hey Lou dot hit Brooke Lopez with a dumb move yesterday.


I know that's my guy man. That's my guy. I didn't know that was Off his rocker yesterday. It is cool. Nah, I ain't fucked up Paul Life for you. I Ain't mad at that. That win. That's good. Like I said, I feel like the bucks needed that win more than, you know what I mean? KC they did So 514,000 for the winner. Everybody get that. Bust that down. What's that in half? That's love man. Some Good chicken. Shout Out to the young rookies on the end of the bench. Them two-way players who got a little bit of that action. Ah man I wish, I wish I was playing Hell 2000 on a two Way. Alright we here right now, y'all end the bench, you know what I'm saying? You got a spirit if you're on a 2 5 14 what got way more than you made Like that's your life just changed really? Yeah and that's not the only money member.


'cause you know to each round a Vance they got a little bit of chicken too so they probably caught about 700 close near that. Nah, you just changed your life for real. That's What's up. What's the first thing y'all buying if I'm on a two-way nothing, Two-way. I'm chilling. He said stacking up shit. Shit quiet. I probably, I probably got a I 10 in for something though. I probably got like five. I got a I 10, I got, I'm on a two way that mean like I Got a I 10 I'm str, I ain't saying struggling but I'm, Yeah because we be sounding crazy sometimes when we start talking about struggling but when you in the NBA That is a struggle And you as a nigga up there making 300 million you, you struggling on that team. It Ain't, it is just the fact that like you gotta like say have this money for the rest of your life or try to.


Yeah. Yeah. So okay. Not it's your job forever now. Like say you for fear, I'm like I'm hoop, I'm playing do I I 32 million deal. Yeah You offered y'all rookie extension good money I got paid. Yeah. Rookie extension for fear. They picked up your good 30 ball. Nah, I'm about to go buy Rolex in a car. Mm. I about 30 ball Rolex in the car. You gonna have some little Chances Mike. What's that watch you want a day? Eight. Okay. What's the ankle bracelet you want? What's the, what's the A Rolex ankle bracelet. You want a car? Yeah you want a cart? Ankle Bura with a charm on it. A charm.


Come get me With a lock it February and June with a key unlock this. Okay. The bus, bus down ankles, crack, ankle Prison break. Cuban for his ankle. We all save it for the podcast but y'all crazy. That is Wow. So NBA cup second year y'all, y'all fuck with it. I love it man. Any changes Y'all think y'all need to be made. A lot of people are critical of the different floors. I mean I ain't mad at it. I like the swag it up. Yeah I like it. Who said they was playing the hell? Steve Kerr. Yeah the Rockets rocket. So that was funny.


He outta pocket. Only thing I don't like is like the celebration. I appreciate what Milwaukee did. They didn't celebrate like they didn't do the champagne and all that shit. They was just like Yeah no champagne sharp. But Dame was holding that motherfucker like this is him. Yeah Bro. I mean shit they won. Yeah I feel him but I mean like popping champagne like he about to win the Chip. Nah, I don't pop no champagne. Nah, Milwaukee has the history of not celebrate apparently. Yeah. Facts. So it, it was very fitting. That's Character. Very fitting. I seen the Michelob in there. I was like damn what you supposed to throw a beer in the air? Damn had Michelob, That's Kareem. I'm doing what you want. Trip Underneath some squares. Right. Make sip.


That's still, that's why I'm like man I be giving some of them old niggas hell but for y'all to hoop on cigarettes and beer bro. Illegal bro. Go get 20. Y'all was hard. I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna bro you just can't do that today bro. We Just smoke a cigarette halftime bro and come out and get 25 and 10 bro. You cold bro. Yeah, gotta respect the leg Cho Moses Malone man That's crazy. All right, outlook of both of these teams. Where do we see the bucks? You know what I'm saying? Just take this momentum for what they got here. Top two, Top two. Nah top at least top three in the east. Hopefully they can springboard and start you know, being a team that we thought they were for sure. Okay. See anything to be alarming about or nah nah, We shot 15% from the three was crazy. Five for 32 from the three is insane. We'll never do that again.


Well soon dot Yeah and not for nothing they are still missing shit. Like we said, you know that's a Educated part of the team as well. That got us get Do I imagine there's it game is a little bit different that No excuses and they and they no excuses said you know they missed about a lot of shots but shit that defense was probably frustrating them niggas bro. Yeah they probably had a mental part too. They definitely was guarding but yeah. Yeah FGA was definitely locked up boy. They they, they, they put him a lot of different memes last night. They be waiting for people to lose man. They get wicked out here. Facts. Have y'all seen the All-star format change? Not a fan. God damn. What's new now Y'all already playing? God damnit what's the game you at? The free throw line wind the kids up Knockout That shit.

Like make this shit competitive bro. The East versus west. Yeah bro They do east versus west and give 'em how much money they got like that 514,000. Yeah I think people will play for a meal every everybody win a meal and they have the money. Oh that's not even the question. They have the money Like man turn this shit back into a real game. I think though because Each player get with a hundred thousand when you win. I can't remember something like that. I spent that in a club that night.

This is John Miko from three and out with John Deloff. Picture this, you're in the garage, your favorite room in the house and you're tuning up your engine with parts you found on eBay. Every piece is just locking perfectly into place. You step back to admire your work hands covered in grease and because you're committed to driving that thing further than the odometer can even handle you start thinking to yourself, you know what, I could probably use some new brakes, some shocks and struts. This baby deserves a new air filter. So you head right back to eBay, you can find any part you need. It's unreal from wipers and headlights to cold air, intakes, exhaust systems, and even that turbo you've had on your mind. eBay is that stock garage of your dreams and you've got eBay guaranteed fit because eBay knows DIY. Fixes can be major and mods are also intense. So you need to know those parts are guaranteed to fit every time before you dive in wrench first and in the off chance you order a part and it doesn't fit, send it back. Simple as that.

And that's exactly why you start with eBay minor fix or complete overhaul. You want to get your ride back on the road and you've got eBay guaranteed fit. So eBay created my garage where all you had to do is add your ride's info to get exact parts that fit. When you see that green check, you're a click away from that part clicking perfectly into place. So now that you know all that, imagine standing at that open garage door looking at the car you love. More than anything knowing that anything is possible. Whether it's keeping it on the road forever or turning it into something that's never been on the road before. Because with eBay your garage just got a whole lot bigger.

That boy got that Bitly outside allegations. Y'all Gonna be shooting at the wrong nigga. Y'all gonna be shooting at somebody's lawyer. Y messed up. Don't listen to that Nigga boy.


That nigga shooting kid. I mean y'all crazy. Hensley and Hensley the real Jr. All y'all crazy man. Listen man, some trade dudes, you know what I'm saying? A little bit of rumor. I heard the nuggets talking about they trying to make a move some of the targets that have been cleared. Oh they ain't call me about that one. Oh nigga you ain't tapped in. They called me. Mm Okay. Rich Respect Lord. But I told you about that Cam Johnson. Man I must been asleep. You definitely said Cam Johnson is they're heavily favorite. It's Zach being, you said that as well. Some other targets. Jordan Clarkson and Jordan Poole of these four gentlemen right here. Who you think is the best fit for that team? Cam. Cam will be the best fit. The most likely fit would probably be Zach Levine.


The Bull's been ready to get off. Zach Levine for a while now. I think he could really help that team. Now he gotta, I think he has to come in and know that obviously you not numar Uno on this team. Maybe not two either. But if he can come in and just do what he do best and fit in with the team bro. Zach V can really help that team because they need another scoring threat as well. Man. They do bro. And he can shoot the basketball they need a def a wing defender. Yeah, They don't have nobody play the defense. That's a fact Bro. I mean, I mean Ag G do Aaron Gordon played defense. That's what he hangs his hat on. Sure. But when they had Caldwell Pope, that's what he locked up. They what he do? Yeah they need a wing sniper defender.


It's Cam Johnson. Okay. He can guard, he can cut off the ball, he can shoot. That's what they really need. That's only pick for them. Yeah, that's what they need. Zach Levine's the pretty pick Listen for shit for shit show. I want JP there. Why? I mean he could play obviously he good enough to play with other superstars and stuff like that. We seen what he did. He was with Steph and all them so obviously he can go there and play serious basketball so it might not be a bad pick. Yeah I just want Jordan Pool to get out there and kill Yolk or him and Russell Westbrook kill second unit together on some bullshit. That'd be fire. I could see that. Honestly. I mean he got more, more than enough talent to do it for sure. But who would you give up to get one of these? Would you move in?


PJD get Cam Johnson. You got to tell you Have no short In a heartbeat. Gotta make that move. Yeah I would do it in a heartbeat. You have some, would you throw a pick with that to make it happen? Nope. I think they even, I think oh buddy make more money than Cam Johnson. MPJ. He do, he on a max deal. Mm He do. If y'all want a pick y'all can have him though. We trying to get, we trying to get Cam, I think we tired of MPJ And you might be able to absorb another contract with that or make another space another move. You might, yeah, you might be able to get Cam and like shit. You might be able to get Cam Thomas too. Shit. He on a rookie deal. Yeah, I don't know what Brooklyn on. I mean obviously they ain't trying to really pay nobody right now. Yeah he on a rookie deal. He he can score off the bench shit.


They get both of them. That's crazy. That's the yeah, that's, that's different. Now you got the shooter you need for your first unit and you got a bonafide score off the bench too. Yeah that, that puts them back in title contention for me. For sure. They might be able to pull it off NPJ and the shit. Who else they got over there? They don't like. Yeah I know they like that dude. Peyton Pey Watson. Yeah. All he ain't going nowhere. Nah, he nah ain't going. Him or LeBron ain't going nowhere. Yeah, I don't know nobody else. If they got this young, they all, they might be trying to get off the light-skinned fella or they signed that four years. 32 with him. Got the fro. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, maybe.
