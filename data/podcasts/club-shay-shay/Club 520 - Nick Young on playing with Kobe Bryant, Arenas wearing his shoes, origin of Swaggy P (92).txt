That's showtime for you. Yeah. Hell yeah. Just describe that feeling to just go play in the Drew with that being home and everything. Drew. Yeah. Used to be cracking. Like I remember like I get to the champ, me and DeMar get to the championship game, then we end up having to play James and James Harden versus pg. Like they stack their teams. Like this shit was cracking. Like you have all the LA in in one spot and it just, everybody there to line outside. It was crazy. It was fun man. I didn't win. I didn't win my first one till I've been to like five championships and lost all of them till about one. Yeah. I went to James And. don, stop playing.


Stop playing. Got you nigga James and PG is come on man. Didn't you? It was tough. Yeah, I saying the playoff roster just looked a little different than Rick. Yeah, little different than Rick. Yeah, for sure. So, but nah, it, it is been cracking but I don't, I ain't been up there in a minute, you know, so though everybody getting older so it is going to be, it's gonna take from the young LA guys to go there and play against like turn it up to turn it back up. But yeah. Yeah. So can anybody just play in there like that's been in the league? Like say if you got a raw squad and I might be the number three player in the NBA, can I just come run with you or is it like it's politics? It depends if he wants you. You know some people come and get embarrassed.


You gotta freaking, they need to ruin like two people. NBA careers. Denzel Valentine. Valentine. Yeah. Everybody. So. Damn.
