I don't know if you saw him dressed before the game, but he came dressed to play football. He came, he came dressed. Oh, he was the one that came. Which one came Like Frank Lucas? That was, that was Jaylen. Okay. Okay. That was him. Okay. He came like Frank Lucas. Hey, he look like he looked like one of the Detroit Detroit players. Now You remember when Frank Lucas went to the Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, probably Madison. That's the exact same, exact same coat and hat. And, and he got his ass bus because they like, hold on. Yeah. Who is that? Yeah. With that outfit sitting that close to the ring. And that's exactly how he got caught up because they didn't have, they had no clue who he was until you decided to step out and be flamboyant. And that, I mean, 'cause think about what that cost, that's probably a hundred.


That was probably like 50 50, 70 5,000 easy back in the seventies. Easy. So imagine, do you know how That's probably about three 400? But that would, that was chinchilla now. Yes. You know how much chin chili is today in today's market? I'd have been chili. 'cause I definitely wouldn't have had that coat on. I'd just been chill. Chili. Oh no, don't forget the hat now. The hat was, yeah. Remember back in the day? Yes. When my, my grandma, I'm talking about my grandma. When my grandma used to go to her go to church. Oh yeah. Oh, oh, oh. The old my grandma. Them hats. Yeah. Them deacons, them deacon asses. Boy, ain't nobody wanting to see my grandma hat game boy. Nobody wants to see my grandma hat game boy. She had all type of, she had all type of shit White. We put my black Red, she had a dress in a hat for every dress.


And he and a clutch played with, she want want to, Hey, We put my grandma on the ground with a hat on For real. Oh yeah. She, she told my sister she wanted to be in her hat. Right. That's live. She, she had a, she had her hat, her sunglasses. Yeah. Her everything. Yes, yes, yes, sir. Yeah. See, my my You never go see. Yeah, I, I don't remember. And like I said, I've never, I've never seen my grandmother go to church without a hat. Yeah. Never. Yeah. And if she forgot it, you gonna turn around and go get it. Yeah. Mary Port, go have that hat on. Them old ladies. Them old ladies. That was a thing. The old ladies wore hat back then, man. But they, you know, deacon Ess or the sister of the church, Hey, you know who had the Best Hat collection?


The pastor wife? Yes. Whoever. The Absolutely wife. Oh, she, she came stepping every Sunday Deacon ass. My grandmother was mother of the church, so, you know, they had to get up there. They had to get up there and they had to, they had to step. Yeah. But yeah, so I I was what I, I saw it on my feed Ocho. Yeah. Or my Igb. You didn't realize who it was. I, I ain't paid no attention. I just, you know, I just scrolled through and I was like, damn, dude got on that Frank Lucas get up because it looked Exactly. If I didn't know better, he wouldn't have said a let me get to Frank Lu. Who? Frank Lucas. Right. Showed him a picture. Can you get me a coat? And a hat looked just like this. Yeah. And That's exactly, and I think Like's funny when they tweeted when the Bears, when the Bears social media account tweeted it, I retweeted it back with a picture of Frank Lucas in the original picture.


Yes. Standing with everybody, with his wife and everything, with a comparison to, I'm like, well, ain't that about to be Yes, that's the exact ensemble. Yeah. And that thing long too. Yeah. That thing was clean. Oh, That thing. Long OCHO Michael Bick seems to be the next NFL player, former NFL player ready to make the jump into coaching. He's in discussion with both Norfolk State and Sacramento State to take over their head football coach. The biggest potential issue with Vic is that he has no head coaching experience or coaching experience at all, at any level. No college, no pro, no high school coaching of the two jobs. Norfolk would give Vic the most time to find his sea legs, but like, but likely lacks the resources to build a true perennial contender.


Sacramento State, on the other hand, has a proven history of reach success and the resources to surround Vic with experienced coaches who can help him learn the ropes faster, but also have significant more to lose. I Like the opportunity that presented Itself poorly, Especially the Norfolk job, despite not having the resources. You know, that is where Vic is from. I think from a recruiting standpoint, players, young players wanting to go play, play for Vic, despite him had not having the experience. I'm sure he would have, you know, a a staff people around him that that would be able to guide him into, to finding the right ways to go about doing his job even though he had no experience, experience in it. There was one point you and I, I didn't have experience in Dayton, so how did I, how did I learn?


I had to get my feet wet. I had to go out there and date. You know, how do you learn to coach? You go out there and you do just that, you know, and you get better at the craft and studying and in and a heeding to it. And finding ways and studying others and understanding, talking conversations. Listen, you played in the NFL for years. You can make phone calls. You have the resources, you know, coaches, the head coaches you've played for that you can confide in that can help you and that journey if you decide to embark upon just that. I think both opportunities are awesome for Vic. If it's something that he loves to do in order to coach, you gotta have a passion for that.


You gotta really have a passion and love for that. For one, uprooting your family, yo. For sure. Invite Vic. I there with me in Miami, you know, and having to commute to the west coast, you know, to be on Fox all the time, you know? Yeah. Maybe now he can find some love and some and some consistency in being in one place, you know, instead of having to travel back and forth. And if that love and that passion for coaching is there, I'm all for it. Yeah. And I love it. I love the opportunity for him because Michael Vick loves some goddamn football. He loves it, you know, and the knowledge that he has to pass on to the younger generation that can still relate to him. Yeah. Love because he's not that far removed from the game is dope.


It's really, it's really dope. Yeah. That, Hey, listen, listen me, me and you on the same page. It ain't about me having the patience. It's the fact that my body is still willing and able. And if you put me in any environment when it comes time to competing or challenging each other in anything competitive, my dumb ass gonna be in the way. I'm gonna be in the way. Oh, your mind is Able, even if my body ain't able, who do You think your mind is able Ain out there trying to show him how to do it? My dumb. Yeah. Hey, yeah. You show him How to do it all in the way. Hey, this is what you do. You can't, you can't. This is what I, I can't coach at any level.


I just can't. 'cause I'm gonna be in the way because the problem is, is I think I can still do it. My mind is telling me what to do. My mind knows what to do. Now. I'm not sure if my body's going to register or my mind is telling me to do what I used to do back in oh five and oh six and oh seven. Hey, I feel like I can, and as far as I'm concerned, I can still do it and I still look the same. Hell I think I can still play today. Amon Rob St. Brown brought pro suits for the entire Lion receivers room. Ooh. Ocho What's the best gift you've gave you've ever gave or gift you've received in the locker room? Hey, that's a good one right there. Unc. I ain't, I ain't really read.


Never, never really received no gifts like that. Unc, especially, you know, during our time ain tenure, we didn't have enough, we didn't win enough UNC where gifts were really needed. You know, we, we didn't win enough, you know, during my time outside of one season. And I think if, if, if we won enough, then gifts would've been passed out for, for for certain positions. You know, I was able to reach this milestone because of y'all, because of this specific group or me giving Carson something nice because, you know, we were able to, Carson didn't buy the offensive line because normally the offensive linemen always Gets Oh, quarterback always. Especially like, well that 2005, that 2005 season, I can't remember what Carson bought, but I'm sure he bought that offensive line something 'cause Oh, but that, our offensive was unbelievable that year.


I don't know what the hell was happening that year, but if, if there was something, you know, I can't remember obviously because it's been too long, but I remember Carson buying something to fall the offensive lineman for what they, for what they had been doing. You know that, that, that season that we, we we, we on fire offensively I, my F 93, I was first team all pro. I was named starter of the, I was a start and tied in for the A FC and I had a $10,000 if I made the Pro Bowl bonus. Right? Right. And I went and bought the offensive lineman. I bought 'em all Rolexes stainless steel Rolexes. Whoa. Wait, hold on now.


Yep. Wait, how much was the Rolex? The price point of The It was like 20, it was like 25. It was like, it was stainless steel, like 2,500. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. I was getting ready to say, 'cause you got me thinking about Rolexes today and, and I'm, I'm thinking about, damn, that's 60, 60,000 a Ash over here talking about. And she ain't never had a watch on a day of her life. Not an Apple watch, not a Mickey Mouse type. Where you watch at, I still, I've noticed, I've known, I've known this woman nine years. I've never seen Ash with a watch on, Hey Ash, what time is it? This is what she does. 9 39.


Look at her, look at her phone. You have a Phone. Yeah. That's why, I mean, most people, a lot of people tell time. I don't really, I don't think I, I, because I'm always have a watch on. Yeah. So unless I'm working out. Yeah. But I, I don't really ever look at, look at my phone to get the time. I just look, looked out at my wrist. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But That, that, but that's, I I mean I've never, I'm trying to think, did I do anything else? Nah, nah, that was it. And I was like, damn, that little 10,000 would've came ahead. Yeah. It go, it would go

The Bengals ocho, you guys still have a milks chance? 2%. This is how the Bengals get into the playoffs. The Bengals need to win out. Need the col to lose one of their next three games. They need the Dolphins to lose one of their next games. Lose out the Bron bros gotta lose out. They need the Broncos to Lose out. Okay. Can you do me a favor? Can you tell me the Broncos next three games. Now do they need to lose every game? Yeah. Yeah. I I, I I know what it mean, but I just, I just don't like the Broncos are playing so well. Offensive Game Lose. That's what Lose Me League. I don't see them losing out Now some of the other, other They play y'all.


They got, they play y'all. They got, they got, they play third, They play Goodall The season with the Chiefs. That's for one. I'm gonna tell you right now, when, when the Bango play the Broncos, we finna beat y'all ass. And when we go on the show that night, I don't wanna hear you say foot or ball at all. I'm, I'm telling you right now, I'm telling Who y'all, who y'all got Who they Got time. If I'm not mistaken. I think y'all got the rate. Do y'all? No, y'all replace, y'all got the stealers. Do y'all stealers Again? Who close off with? Y'all got the Steelers, the Broncos. Broncos. Oh yeah, we, there's the, Hey, you talking about a 2% chance Y'all got round, Get 2%.


There's a whole Broco Steelers, there's a whole milk chance that we go to the playoffs and we squeeze in a little wild card spot. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. I believe, I believe in my bangals. I believe in us. 'cause they're number nine. I believe in us because of Uno and God t Higgins. Now our issue, which has always been especially this goddamn season, is our defense. They happen to be our Achilles heel this year. I'm not sure why. I'm not sure why. I don't know what's going on. But if we happen to get into the playoffs, I don't know what we gonna do defensively. I know what the hell we gonna do offensively. I know a one in five gonna give us, I know what Chase Brown gonna give us. I know one thing. We gotta score 50. We gotta score 50.


We, we, it makes the other team score 45. That's, that's it. All I know. We gonna go ahead and see what we gonna put y'all at. Y So If y'all beat the charges that mean me out completely and no other circumstances Done kaput. Nah. Dang y'all. But see, those are the scenario. Y'all, y'all need all of those scenarios. You know what, I, I don't, I don't. I honestly, I don't. Just, just the thought of it like, it, it, it could be another episode of me being emotional on camera again. And that's something I don't think I can take being I can, I like it.


Hey, hell dog. Oh hell, I like it. Like Matt Ocho. Patrick Mahomes ankle sprain overshadowed the Chief's win versus the Browns Mahomes left the game with an ankle injury less than eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, which was later determined to be a sprained ankle backup. Carson Wind came into the ball game to finish for the chief. Andy Reed had coach. Andy Reed said it's a little sore. It's literally day to day. He probably could have come, could have come back in. But he wanted, he wanted to go back in, but there was no need for that. Right. Mahomes will have more tests on the ankle on Monday, if I'm not mistaken. Ocho, they play Saturday at home against the Houston Texans and then follow that up on Wednesday against the Pittsburgh Steelers.


Ocho I just thought, I just, they talk about three Pete. Right. They just gotta hope that Mahomes can finish healthy. Oh yeah. Most definitely. If you watch this game Mo Only running For his life play. Listen, the offensive line play. No disrespect to the players offensive line play there has been bad all season. Huh? That ain't nothing new. It's been, it's been bad all year. It's been abysmal all year and there's nothing that is nothing that they can do. Mahomes can't complain. I mean, there's, I mean, who you gonna complain to? You got, you got to play through it and just hope at some point, you know, you, you have the right schemes, you have the right, the right game plans and what you can do. But still, it's, it is not, it's not working. It's not working. That, that, that ain't they, they, you know what I think do and They try to, to Stay as Valid as they possibly can.


I think Mahome should relax on Saturday. Relax the Houston game. Who's the backup? Who's the backup again? Carson win. Oh, see, let yeah, let Carson wins has enough, enough cache, you know, and he, he, he knows how to win and manage a game. I would let the Carson wins take over this Saturday against the Texans and let Mahomes come back on Wednesday. What you think? I mean, I'm, I'm just, I mean that's, that's just, that's just how I feel. It is gonna be interesting to see Buffalo.


I think Buffalo has an easy schedule, a easier of the schedule. If you say that they got the pa, they got the Patriots twice, they got the Eagles, excuse me, the Patriots twice. They got the Jets and the who, who else do they have? I know they got the Patriots twice. The Jets. Is that it? The Bills Patriots twice the Jets. It, That's it. That's it. Oh that's not fair. So they got the Patriot. That's not fair. They got a Patriots twice in the Jets. That's Not fair. But you know, it's funny, that could be a trap game boy.


Anytime you play a divisional opponent. What that You don't think so? Yeah. Yeah. Ain no trapping. Yeah. Have you seen the Patriot play? Have you seen the Patriot play? Hey listen, hey. Okay. Ain't no trapping. Right. They better, they better hope. They better hope Buffalo get trapped in Buffalo. That's the only, no Like that man change. You gotta each other. They can't get out. Why the Patriots come out there and do something crazy for four quarters and stumble up on the win? It happened all the time. I don't know why it happened like that, but it just happens all the time. Right. Especially with a team that's been dominating the way Buffalo is.


And Kansas in Kansas City. Houston at home. Pittsburgh on the road, Denver on the road and Denver's playing really, really well. Yeah, Denver had the road last time. You don't remember they ended up blocking the field. The guys been on, on, on the chief side all season long. Yeah. Yeah. And here's the thing. Yeah, because Buffalo beat chief's head to head. If they finish with the same record Buffalo Gets out. That ain't out. Ain't really reason why I, I would wanna play a half home field advantage anyway. Honestly. Yeah. For me this buffalo looks different because even last year Josh still turned the ball over a lot.


Yeah. And he put the ball in harm's way a lot. He hasn't done that this year. Now remains to be seen come playoff time, pressure ramps up, expectations ramps up. Especially if he continues to play like this. Ocho Yeah, I think it's a two horse race between he and Lamar Jackson for the MVP. Pittsburgh did a job that kind of hurt Saquon's, right. Excuse me. MVP chances. So I think it's a two horse race between Lamar and, and and, and, and Josh Allen. Josh is playing extremely, extremely well. What I think he has what he has 12, 10, 12 Russian touchdowns. He has another 25 passing touchdowns.


Lamar is playing out of his mind though. Yeah. Lamar had five touchdowns today. I missed that. So he's probably what, 33 and three? He was ball, He was ball, he was balling Unc I was on a plane. Yeah, he was 30. He was, yeah, he had five. He had he damn he had about 290 yards passing five touchdowns. So I think it's out of those two. But Josh just keeps doing it. So many, I mean it is every week. I mean we saw what he did last week. He's the first guy since 1954 to throw for three touchdowns, rush for three touchdowns. He backed that up with two touchdowns, another two touchdown rushing, another two touchdown passes passing. And he's kind of been doing that the entire season and so it's gonna be very, very interesting.


I really think it's a two horse race. I don't think anybody else is in the conversation currently. That's just me personally. Now somebody might say, well what about this guy? What about that guy? I think it's a two horse race now. And I don't see anybody knocking Josh Allen, aov, the Eagle, the, the Patriots. I don't see it now. Like you said, they could ri rise up and and play Unbelievable. Still lose but suppress some of Josh's numbers. But if he doesn't, I I I just don't see the eagle. I don't see excuse. I keep saying Eagle, the Patriots. I just don't see without him turning the ball over. Dang. I just don't see how they score. Have enough offense to score Ocho You right, you right, you, you right about that man.


God, Lee man, it just, it gonna get something about them games late in the season. I'm telling you, especially when it comes to divisional games. It it get, it, it tricky it get it get get real tricky. Even, even listen, Buffalo is playing really, really well. I'm, and I, I don't know what it is. It just, it happens. You see, I see it. They are, we see it every year late in the season. Brock Purdy reportedly seeking a contract. Whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa. He don't at the top of the Million dollars a year At all. But go ahead. All I know is I ain't getting him nowhere near no 50 million.


I'll give you one of them more. 35, 40 million. What you think he gonna say? What you think he gonna say to that? No. Okay. Play on, play on the guess what? What? We'll put you on a, what you call it for two years. Oh, He gonna bet on himself like Kirk cousin then? Yes. Okay. Let him bet every, you always hear the story of everybody Bett. Oh Come. They don't where They lose. What about them snake out stories? There's a reason why those windows don't open in Vegas. You notice that ocho you in, you in the casino. Don't none of them rooms open. Those windows don't open, do they? You, you, you ever ask yourself talk, talk, talk.


Why these rooms don't open? I wanna give some fresh air Talky talk. You ain't finna take the easy way out. Hey, you know what? They might be, They might, they might have no choice but to pay purdy because listen, you don't wanna pay him what he worth or what the market says. He should be paid. Where else you going with at the quarterback position? You have no one to replace him. You don't have no choice. I'm not paying him no $50 million. Listen, They had a choice not to pay Daniel Jones You choice. Right. Got a choice. Okay. What, what did, what did they pay? What did Tampa, what did Tampa play? Baker Mayfield. Ah, 40. Okay. Okay. I 33. What you were going with? I three years, hundred me, Sandy. He have A-A-A-A-A Baker Mayfield type contract.


Okay. Okay. Okay. That yeah. That's feasible. That's feasible. I'm not sure. Sure. He, he would even complain about that. He would. I'm not giving him no 50 million. That ain't happening. I don't Know. That quarterback position is very, very, very, very important. And sometimes if you want it bad enough, you will overpay for it. 49 ERs will not release. Devon. Dre Campbell 49 ERs are pursuing a max suspension. So Campbell doesn't get paid since he is a vested player. If they were to release him, he still gets the remainder on his contract. So if they suspend him, they get to withhold that. Now that's something they're gonna have to run by the league for the amount of time that they can suspend him.


I'm thinking they're gonna say conduct detrimental. You see how they see how they Detrimental. You see how I I Yeah, I would too. You think I'm, hold on. So you want them to, you want them to release it thing And he and he still Paid one thing about it. Boy, I, I wish I might They wanna hit you where hurt. They wanna hit you and take what they think you value most. That money. Yeah. Yeah. Ocho. Yeah. Drake. Greenlaw got Nick right. He's the backup. Right. So what did he do? Right? Right. He was where it hurt. We needed a body. He wouldn't go in the game. That's I Fair's fair. Even swap ain't no swim. That's why I you hit me with it hurt. I hit you where it hurt.


We both hurt. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care if we both blind. I I I did he, did he come out and apologize or anything? Did he say anything? Did he talk to the team or, Man, I wanna hear what he gotta say. 'cause everybody talking about, well you don't know what that man was going through. So I just wanna know, was he going through it before the game or did it happen during the game because he, if he was going through something before the game, take your ass to Kyle Shanahan. Right. Go to a, a, a Lynch. John Lynch who's the general manager, said, man, look that man, right. I I got a lot on my mind tonight. I got, you know, my family, blah, blah, blah, X, y, and z. He got mad because they activated Drake Greenlaw and he went from a start back up deal.


That's why he got mad. Stop. We gotta stop, we gotta stop making excuses. We try to, we try to excuse everything that a person does Who try to make that excuse You dunno what he was going through. Oh wait, hold on. If you in the middle of a Football game, you Don't, nothing else matter what's going on on the outside. Thank you. Because in between them lines, that's your outlet. That's your sink to peace. That's your job. What? Right. So it, so it just happened. So whatever he had going on, Ocho it just reared his ugly head when he put the pads on.


And at the third quarter when Dre Greenlaw got hurt, so it didn't happen. It didn't happen before the game. It not on the way to the stadium. He get a call, Hey, something's going on with the fam, blah, blah, blah. He didn't, it didn't happen. Once he got got to the stadium and an hour before the kickoff it happened, it just so happened he started going through something the moment they needed him to step in the game for Dre Greenlaw. Right. That's when he, that's when you don't know Shannon what he was going Through. Whatever I'm going through, whatever I'm going through in life, I know once I walk in that stadium and I walk in that locker room, whatever I'm going through in life, it stays on the outside until the, until the game is over.


Once you make that decision, Ocho, once you make that decision that you show up, yeah, you gotta show out. You can't Ocho. Now if, like I said, if he has this going on before ocho it just so happened. It's funny. Don't you find it funny, Ocho whatever he started going through, it happened the moment Dre Greenlaw went down needed. I like how you put that. That was nice. Ah. Now I wonder had he been going, if Dre Greenlaw is inactive, I wonder if he's still going through that same thing. Not at all. So I the 49 ERs, well spin them are well within their right.


And that's the whole thing, Ocho, I ain't got no problem if you got, if you working regular nine to five Right. You just cannot show up while I was going through something. Call your supervisor, call your boss, let somebody know, man. I mean, OCHO hit me up. Hey, Ocho is not gonna be able to make it today. He called me, he said he didn't have your number, but he wanted me to let you know that he had something going on at home. He had a personal issue that he gotta deal with. He's sorry he wasn't able to tell you. You just not gonna show up on the damn job, man. F that job, bro. There's a common dec there's a common courtesy, right, that you, and I'm not saying people don't have things, but you mean to tell me you don't have the common courtesy, the common decency.


Right. Decency to just call and say, Hey, I'm not gonna be able to come in today. That's Crazy work. Boy, that's crazy work Man. I, I I just don't, I just don't get guy.

OCHO what a game it was in in Motor City, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills go on the road and beat a team that had won 11 straight games in Jerry. Go the Detroit Lions 48 to 42. The team, the highest scoring game this year. The team combined for 90 points. 1,080 total yards, 12 total touchdowns. Josh Allen was sensational. Again, 430 total yards. Four touchdowns. Yeah. Two in the air, two on the ground. Jerry Goff was equally as impressive, but not nearly enough. He had 507 total yards and five touchdowns. No interceptions. Remember ocho? Yeah. It's funny how the NFL worked. You remember that game? He had five interceptions and they won.


He had five touchdowns, no turnovers and they lose. That's just the way it goes. Buffalo raced out to a 14. Nothing lead on Josh on two. Touchdown, two. Josh Allen and TD runs and they never looked back. Yeah, Buffalo, they good. Ocho The only, the only thing that I question is Dan Campbell calling an onside kick with 12 minutes up in the ball game. You're having a hard time stopping them. I'm not giving them a short field. Right. The last thing I'm gonna do is give them a short field ojo. They give 'em the short and you had the momentum. Now you give them a short field and now they go up, they go up by another score and you, you're fight fighting an uphill battle.


But 48 to 42, I had some concerns about Detroit. Yeah. And that defense and it's starting to shore its head a little bit. Ocho. No, now look, no Josh shadows not an easy guy sack. Yeah, he's not an easy guy. He knew what he liked getting to it. He's like a more athletic, getting his big ass on the ground is the tough part. Yeah, absolutely is. But listen, this was a very, if you wanted points, ta here it, it was 48 42. And remember they lost the game last week. 44, 42. So they score out, they, they scored 90 points right in the last two weeks. Good, good. Love that. Yeah. Yeah. Most definitely bad, most Definitely. O Joe, we gave up 86 From a fan perspective.


They enjoyed this game. If you're a Buffalo fan, if you're a Lions fan, this is a game that you look forward to having. Even if you won the losing an end, maybe not so, but the fact that, you know, you can put up these kind of points against good teams says now we need to work on the other half. You got damn defense 40.0, they put up 90 some point what? 80, 87 together. Right? They gave you talking about, you talking about Buffalo. Buffalo scored 42 last week. They scored 42 this week. They gave up 44 last week to the Rams. They gave up 42. Now, both times they were on the road. Now, I mean, you know, you on the road and say, but you're gonna have to play a little better because it doesn't look like, unless something happens with Kansas City, it's gonna be tough for you to overtake them because your two games, there's two games clear Hey of you.


If for some reason I just had this feeling, it's the, it's the bill's year. It's the bill's year. Josh Allen is playing very, very well. Very well. And if he happens, definitely no good The Chiefs again in the playoffs, at some point, at any point, I think this is the year that they finally beat them. Josh, Josh Allen's playing out of this world. He's playing out of his mind again, i i, early in the season, obviously I had Lamar Jackson as my MVP, but as, as of the past, what, maybe three, three, maybe four weeks. Yeah. Josh put that cape on, man. He was Clark Clinton at the beginning of the season. Yeah, nice. Superman. He's playing just like Superman and what they're doing offensively with no superstars that we, we did.


There are no bonafide superstars over there in Buffalo. You know, you have very good, adequate role players that are doing their jobs. Nope. Very, very well. Yeah. They run to football really well. 34 rushes 197 yards, 14 rushes 105, two touchdowns for James Cook. 11 carries for 66 yards, two touchdowns for Josh Allen and I, I think that's the thing that when the voters look at and hold on, he lost Deon Diggs, who was a Pro Bowl player. Yeah. He lost Gabe Davis, who was a very si he was a very good receiver. You look at what they lost defense, both of their safety. DiUS, DiUS White, excuse me, DiUS White.


Yeah. And he's doing this. The only difference I see with Josh Allen this year, no, in the pre in the previous years, he not turning it over. That's, that's the biggest difference. He's been this y'all guys, he's been averaging putting up 350 and 400 yards of total off offense all over. Yeah. But he gets himself into trouble when he turns the ball over when they're going into score and he throws an interception in the end zone and it's a touchback, he fumbles in the red zone when they're going to get points. That is the biggest difference in which I see with this team. Plus those guys aren't in his ear now. They scored 48 points.


And if I'm looking at this, if my, my, my thing shows me correctly, I don't see Cooper with a target. Amari Cooper didn't get a target and they dropped 48. Now, if somebody else didn't get a target last year, we know what's gonna be transpiring. So now he's the unquestioned leader of the entirety of the team. His peace. Look at the way he's playing Ocho. He doesn't force he look now he did force what? Yeah, he's rolling out a Miles OCHO and he throw back to the middle of the field and he almost got pick up. Say Josh, why he Go, he, he, he gonna beat him a little bit.


Why? Every, every often he go he gonna beat him. Yeah, he is. And so they, they, the look your defense is gonna, if you, if you get the Buffalo Bills, your defense best, best be on their best behavior because that's not an anomaly. Now, I'm not saying 48, but if you go back and look at it, they've got what a straight games of at least 30. Right? They're probably averaging 30 a game. I think it's, I think they're Nip and Chuck right there with Baltimore. But they might have overtaken Baltimore.


Well, the highest scoring team in the NFL or they won or they two. Because I know Baltimore, Detroit and them, they were right, right there. But I think after these last two games, I think Buffalo's overtaken them. But hey, boy, you gonna have your hands full because this team offensively and they got, they got like ocho, it's just like, oh, you got secure doing his thing that he's so hard to get on. I mean, Josh is just so hard to get on the ground and then you gotta worry about his legs because now O Joe, I can't really rush like I want to. Yeah. Because if I, if I run past him, he gonna jump out the window. If I don't keep, if I, if I let him get outside of the pocket, he can throw on the move and he still can go get me a first down, even if it's third and 15.


So it's so hard to defend him. You just hope that he makes some mistakes, he gets anxious and he starts and he turns the ball over. But if he's calm, like he's been playing like the last 30 Gotta be four. You gotta be disciplined on defense. You Got your hands defense. If anything, especially with knowing that he's a dude threat, you gotta take your D ends and he bring your ass up field and keep contained and Yeah. And keep, contain and level your ass off. Now if you have to have a spy, you know, because he's the dude threat quarterback. You, you gotta have a spy. Tell your sty, you got to keep your discipline, keep your disciplined. Hey, if, if he, if he runs, just make sure you bring him down. You gotta make the tackle, especially in man to man because everybody back is turned. Everybody back is, is turned and you is our last savior.


Yep. And like d the end, when you, when you get like, okay, you see where he is? He's he's back there in the pocket. Yeah. He's about seven to eight yards. Once you get that point, now you gotta level off, don't you run your ass by and try to try to Oh, I, I'm, no, no, no, no, don't do that. Bye. Bye-bye. Because all he's gonna do is step out the, he gonna step out the window on you. Yeah. And like you said, when you got your back turned now good luck with that. But he is, he's a big, he, he's playing extremely well. The guys are making plays for him. Coleman came back today, had a big catch. Kincaid is finally back. He's making catches. Shakira is his safety blanket.


James Cook, you know, catching outta the backfield. Yeah. That look, this, this, they're really good. They're a really good football team. They're playing extremely well. Right now. Is their team in the a c that has the possible weapons that what Detroit has or No, the Rams have, because I haven't seen it. Not those Co not those kind of weapons. We know the Ravens give, give or take. Yeah. Lines of Lions of First and Points scored second and total offense builds are second in point, scored eighth in total offense. They keep playing like this and they're gonna be first in to, they gonna be first in point score.


They gonna be first in point scored, but they have a, they have a team. That's, that's, that's really good. Like I said, I didn't agree with Dan Campbell with 12 minutes left in the game. O Joe kick on Black, Kick that. That's Ben. That's, yeah, I agree with that. He's always been who he is. I don't agree with that. Listen, he has some big kaons and he wears them. Matter of fact, he walks down, he walks on the sideline with a wheelbarrow with his nuts in the wheelbarrow. And that's how he coaches, that's how he plays. He goes for it on four down. He goes for you. He does on sidekicks. And his players believe in him. He believes in his players. And I think that's why he makes some of the calls that he makes that most, most players, I mean most players and analysts and punters like yourself just wouldn't, this wouldn't you just wouldn't agree with based on the situation, The Volume
