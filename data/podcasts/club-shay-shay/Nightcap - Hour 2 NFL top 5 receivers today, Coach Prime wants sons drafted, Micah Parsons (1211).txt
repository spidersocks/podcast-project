Gene Michael said, Hey Uncle Ocho, can you guys give me your top five receivers in order in the game today? Order? Man, we we need to think about that bro. Right now you have to say Chase Jefferson. Hey, he don't get, Hey, people wanna discount him. I like pka Nku. I'm put ppu at my top. Yeah, I'll put P at my damn top. Damn, put he I'm in raw, raw Tyreek. No.


Or is it because he's having a down? Yeah, He been, he been, he kind of been nicked this year. Well, I think what hurt him? Yeah. Is that two been Out two. Two. But you know what? Yeah, just because he's still Tyreek I put him in there. Yeah, Who you Got? Yeah, that's tough. I mean, listen, my one A, my one a one B is, is Chase and Jefferson, God damn. Aj, AJ Brown, Tyreek, cd, lamb.


Now there there's some other players that you know are on the fringe that belong in that conversation as well. Yeah. Amman, Ahman, raw Amman, Ross. Yeah. Who else, who else am I missing? I think Pickens Pickens is in that tier one as Yeah, pick. He coming. He coming. He's coming. He definitely coming. Yeah, he's one as well. Let's see. NFC, let's go. NFC South. Mike Evan's been hurt this year, but we can't. He been out a lot, Man. Listen, he he's missed it. Consistent, man.


Yeah. Well you know what Ocho with the exception of, with the exception of Chase and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and Jeff. It's been a quiet yip of receivers, man. Them the only two that's consistently week in and week out. Now they had the Jetta had that streak where the defense that we ain't giving you nothing. We gonna double, we gonna triple you. We gonna let Hawkinson, we gonna let Addison, we gonna let everybody else, we gonna double your ass. We, we gonna stop you No matter what. Yeah. But other than that, it's kind of been a down year for, except for those two guys. Coach Prime tells Antonio Pierce. Yeah. He wants to Raiders to draft the door. And Shiloh, if the season ended today, the Raiders would have the number two pick times.


Thanks. The Raiders will be a good spot for its son and an event in Las Vegas. Time to Pierce. You are truly the best. Now I need you to do the right, do one thing. I need you to draft those samples boys. I hold I I like it though. I I like it. I like it, but I don't remember. It's very important. The situations you go to, your supporting cast is very important that you have the tools around you at your disposal. You have the, huh? He got Brock Bowers, He got Brock Brock's the real deal. Mike Brock, Bowers, top three, top four, along with, is it McBride? Did I say that right? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. He might be top three or four and I ain't talking about three or Four again.


You you mean Unc and I ain't talking. We're talking about the N nfl Now we, we need, we need more than Bowers. We need one more dog. Oh, for sure. For sure. They, they, they got some, yeah, they they got some good receivers, not great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They got good, they got good quick beat guys. Just one I'm talking about we like, I'm part of the damn Raiders. They just need one. They just, they they just need one and he he's gonna be fine. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. I mean look, I think it'll be, look, it's gonna be very interesting to see how this thing shapes out. Jacksonville has two wins. I think the Giants have two wins. I think the Raiders have two wins and at some point in time they're like Right.


You don't ever wanna show your fan base that you don't really care about winning. I mean Right. Because we, you know, we want to, you know, we want try to win, but we really try to lose Now Jacksonville, y'all ain't going look, see y'all can't. Right. I don't know what y'all gonna do. 'cause you got Trevor and he just got paid. I don't think Trevor going nowhere anytime soon. Exactly. You got the Giants in need of a quarterback desperately the Raiders need a quarterback desperately. Hell, there are several teams. Maybe somebody moves up to get, if you fall in love with somebody during the draft process, you put 'em on the board and you evaluate them. You study their tape and you list like this guy is is is franchise altering.


Right? That's, But it's gonna be, it's gonna be very, very interesting to see this thing how it shapes out Ocho. But I do think Shado is gonna be a very high pick. He's, he's made himself some money. He got coach, he got a, a coach that his offensive coordinator this year was an OC in the NFL. So he's pro ready. His dad is a coach. You know, you like, you like, you like players, especially in the quarterback position that dad was a coach. So he understands it, he understands what it takes to be the mechanisms of everything that comes around.


Yeah. Comes along with being an NFL quarterback. You're the CEO. Yes sir. Gotta be buttoned up with your Things. Yeah. Gotta say all, gotta say all the right things. Do all the right things. It's, it's more than just playing the position everybody to man who cares? It's Different. It's different bro. Stop it. Stop it. It's just like if you're a CEO, you Tim Cook can't just do out there doing willing any stuff. Even though Apple Apple products are doing good, flying off the shelf, it doesn't work like that. There's a decorum, you know, you gotta be very de mule. Well, hold on. Whoa. Hold on. Hold.


You gotta be very what? Gotta very Dee what You in that situation? That's a word. You at some point. So I'm r Deir. D-E-M-O-D-O-R-D-U-M-U. Oh Deir. Okay. Okay. Deir. Oh, you gotta, you gotta talk like you French de. Okay, okay, okay. I like that. What it mean, what I had told for breakfast this morning.


I'm, I'm Finn use, I'm finna use that. I'm It re it's Reserved. It's my, When I, when I met her, I was very jam. I don't think re gonna say you was the Buick who re probably say, you the damn fool. Wish she met you. You the damn fool. Two years in and you a d fool now and Michael Parson to the list of cowboys voicing voices clamoring for the return of Mike McCarthy. I think it would be like a fair shot with everyone back, players, coaches, because the injury kinda struck of what this season could really be. The injuries have been terrible and you know, it really sucks in terms of coaching.


Man, Mike, damn you just said nevermind. Coach Mike to me and his relationship has always been really good. He always took real good care of me and I just don't know how the, the business side is going to go. You know, Jerry has his own mindset about who he wants to coach. This is his team. I'm kind of like just a pawn in this business. Hold on. I thought a couple of weeks ago you said, Hey, nevermind. No Joe Players coming out in defensive, their coach, their head coach, despite some of the things that he said in the past, having to retract it and change their tool. Now in support of Mike McCarthy, regardless of what any of the players say in Jerry's mind, his mind is probably already made up.


Probably already made up. You know, he's gonna allow, he gonna allow Mike McCarthy to finish out the season. You know, and, and Dak came out and said it as well, I wish I had some power when it comes to the decision making. He, you don't, everybody knows that, but you don't. That's what anybody comes out and says, you know? Yeah. It's, it's good, it's good, good pr good media relations, but knowing Jerry, based on this season, regardless of the injuries or not, he clean the house. He's cleaning the house. If you understand the business in general, if you understand the cache and how that specific individual runs his ship, he's clean the house.


No matter what any player says, You ocho it's kinda like when yeah, a player know he's gone. The coaches know he gone the player, what the coach say. Yeah. Yeah. I would love to have him back. He's been great. He's a great player. We love, they're not gonna say, nah, we want him gone. And just like players, it's, it's, it's a rare, I don't, I don't know if I I've ever heard of I, yeah, I would him gone. I don't like him. He's not a great coach. He's not a great at situations. He doesn't make any endgame adjustments. He doesn't make, you know, quarter to quarter adjustment, halftime adjustments. I've never heard a player say that. So all this is just coaches bill for me and, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's pr great PR spin.


Yeah. And, and they might sincerely want him back, but I don't know what's, What would their and players, players always say everything that's politically correct in that setting. Nobody there, there are very few, there are very few players that have ever been in the FL that actually voice their opinion or saying what the fans are thinking or saying what we know is going on in the locker room and actually came out and said it. There's only maybe may, maybe one, right? I can think of my dog. TTT let it be known whatever issues might be going on that the fans can see from the outside in. But as a player, you know, you're not supposed to say t gonna let you know the things that are going on inside.


Tell you about the elephant in the room. Oh, he, he, he's gonna let it be known. Why are we losing? Because the coaches saw stand up the plate. Adorable. Hey, hey, you heard, you heard a a a a Chase Chase man, don't ask me no questions About getting the ball. Ask Coach Paul Have I don't call plays. Yeah, right. Yeah. He said, I don't call plays. Y'all asking me stuff now. Y'all always tell me, Hey, let the coaches coach you just play. Now all of a sudden you ask me, what can I get open on? Oh, I'm play. Hey, I love it. Job grab Duc.


George Pickens doesn't know him. Or at least that's what the Steelers wide receiver says. Days away from the rematch with the Cleveland Browns Steelers. Week 12 lost to the Browns was punctuated by a scuffle between Pickens and Newsom. During The game ending Hail Mary attempt ask if he would talk to Newsom before the Sundays game. Pickens was dismissive. I don't even know who that is. The steel. His third year receiver said Friday. Pickens also doubled down on his post-game assertion that he did not think the Browns are good. A good team. I just go by the record, bro. After the game, Newsome called Pickens a fake tough guy. And Friday he responded to pick his latest comments and dressed. Yeah, he was going to handle the trash talk.


Feel rematch. I'm all about Team Newsom said, obviously he's the guy who cares more about himself and you can see that in the penalties he causes. For me, my job is to try to do whatever I can to help my team win. There's never going to be no one-on-one battle for me. I like it. Fife five five. I do too. Let's Go. I need to see. Listen, we lost Mike Evans and Marshawn Latimore. We lost that. We lost Josh Norman and Odell Beckham. We lost that. I You want that? So you want that. You want Come back, huh? A team player. I know, I understand it. You know, team, you know, comradery, hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.


Man, I need this George Piggins. I need this. Keep it within the game. Keep it within the confinement game. Give me a, give me a show. It is hard though. Ocho Give me, I, I'm, I sw for God. I'm finna gimme some popcorn. I'm better kick my feet up and watch y'all go at it Sunday. Give me a show. I beg you, Hey, play hard. Don't get penalty. Don't 15, Don't that. You know, get in, get it. Hey listen, get in each other. Face trash. You know, with Pickens, when you catch a ball, you know, you hit that thing they be doing there. You know, if Greg Newsome, you make a play, you get up and you know, you do the sword.


Do the, do the like strap y'all. I beg of y'all man. I don't even hear none of that politically correct bullshit about it. Know I'm a team player, gimme a show. I pay, you know how much I pay for NFL Sunday ticket. But you better gimme something Dak defended. Mike McCarthy said, I wholeheartedly believe in him. Dak thinks McCarthy deserves another contract. He also said he would help McCarthy. McCarthy if it, if he had more influence on the team's development. But McCarthy said he's confused by Dak comments. According to Clarence Hill, the Cowboys, cowboys, coach McCartney said he had the most input he's ever had as head coach.


Oh lord, that mercy coach compared to Green Bay. He is not sure what Dak meant by needing him influence on his terms. We know Mike McCarthy does not have had No power. Thank you. No pool. He's a head coach and title only For those that understand the game of football. For those who know about when it comes to being the coach of the Dallas Cowboys organization. But that's ster helmet. There's one person that runs the show and it's not the head coach. Yeah. And it's always, always been that way. You have no pull. You know exactly what D meant by the words that he said. Yes. And I'm not, I'm taking Dak what he said with a grain of salt because guess what he said he wanted Scott Lenahan. He said he wanted to kill Kelly Moore.


He said he wanted Jason Garrett. He said he wanted this one and he wanted that one. Yeah. So what's he supposed to say? Nah, I want Mike, I want another head coach. I want another play caller. Of course he's gonna say all the right things because if you go back and check his track, track record ocho, he said the exact same thing about every offensive coordinator, about every head coach that he's had. Yeah. I mean, you have to, you have to. He has to be pc. He's a quarterback. He's the face of the franchise no matter what. So he asked us if they all the right things. It's not like he gonna come out and go against, you know, his his head coach. I mean, come on Mike. No, no, No it shouldn't. But I'm saying for him to say, Mike, lemme ask you a question. Do you have any say on the final 53?


Do you have any say in free agency? Do you have any say in the draft? So if that, if that's the case. So I'm just trying to figure out what do you mean you have some say. Wait, didn't he say he had more say, more control and more say than we, than he had in Green Bay? Yeah, I disagree. Maybe, maybe Ocho maybe at the end, maybe at the end. He didn't have the same amount of say. But it's hard for me to believe throughout his entire tenure that he had more say in Dallas, that he had in Green Bay. You know what that get right. Huh? Child. That's what, that's what that get, you know, damn. Well Stop saying. Well see now by saying that, you know, you take some of the owners off Jerry.


So we can't blame Jerry fully. So Jerry can say, oh see, he went out there and said that he had some say. Let's get his ass up outta here because we losing

Coach Belichick interviewed for C'S University of North Carolina head coach in vacancy. He reportedly blew them away in the interview. I mean, I don't know why y'all surprised by that. Coach Belichick seemed genuinely interested, interested in the job. Excuse me. At the age of 72, coach Belichick has no prior pre college experience. Ocho, do you like Coach Belichick going back? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I want, at some point I would love for Coach Belichick to get the most wins as a head coach in the NFL in the past. Shoot. Look and I can't get that done going to North Carolina.


I think going to college, it's, it's not a bad thing, but there's a disadvantage due to the competition level being the, the, the playing field being even because of NILI don't think Bill needs to get into that realm in that area where you're not really getting the players you need to to have a winning season or actually to be, be able to compete at a high level. I would prefer Bill to stay with us at inside the NFL until the right job comes to his How, how, how do I say it? And to the right. To the right. NFL job comes, you know, the right one where he can continue to to, to win and strive to get into reaching that goal of being the most, the most winning coach NFL head coach ever.


I think Coach Joe, coach Belichick, it had to be a huge crush to his ego. You're talking about a guy that won six Super Bowl and he ain't get none of the jobs. There was six or seven jobs that were available and he got none of them. Yeah, but the the, He Got none of them can ask the question though. Think about this. Yes. Of those six or seven jobs that are available, which one would've been the best fit that can, where he can continue his random dominance? No, he ain got no quarterback. I mean, you, you got a quarterback but you ain't got Tom Brady. But at this point, Ocho, lemme ask you a question. You are the, you are the best receiver in football. That's me. That's me. You, you, you, you got, you got all the records. You done had six straight hundred seasons.


You'd have had six straight seasons, at least 13 on the yard. Six straight seasons of 10 touchdowns. Okay? They move on and you can't find one job. Hey, can I tell you something? Yeah. It's become a young man's game. Not only has this become me young man's game, it's become a young coach's game as well. But Bill speak for itself. It speaks volumes. It's all about Bill being able Right. Adapt to today, today's players to today's era change. Can he change some of the things that he did during the old days? Some of the old ways and try to try to revamp.


Like, you know, when I tell you you got these, sometimes you got evolve, you, you, you can't, you can't, you can't do the things you did back in the day and think it's gonna work in today's era. You know, the players, I, I don't, I don't think they respond. Young Kids don't give a damn about no resume ocho I know these kids don't care nothing about no resume. My kids don't. I'm just saying the organizations might, might, if he goes in and let and ensures that he can adapt to the kids in today's era, that's all I'm saying. I could be wrong. I I, Yeah. But yeah, he can he adapt. It's hard ocho when you've been in your, it's hard when you've done something one way and had ultimate success doing it that way.


Now all of a sudden, I you mean to tell me to do a 180? Yeah. Ocho that's hard. And the kids today Ocho there's not the same level of respect for coaching and authority that it once was what you and I grew up with and the way we see it gradually, gradually dissipating where the coach's authority and the coach's voice is not as powerful as it once was. Now it is in some locker room. But I remember 10, five years ago, yeah, 10, five years ago, coach Belichick walked into a locker room with the, with that resume. Now everybody's the first thing they gonna call into question.


He ain't wanna know what I go, he ain't wanna know without Tom Brady. Yeah. Yeah. Well I just, I just been What about, you Know what I, I see especially with the young players that, that looked up to, looked up to him as a co-coaching and respect what he's done. I think he could walk into a locker room and it'd be instant respect even from the young, even from the young guns Despite his struggles. Aaron Rodgers says he has nothing to prove over the final five game inferring that his career accomplishment should supersede see, told you should supersede his performance down the stretch. He said it would be ridiculous to make a player with his resume audition for next season Ocho This is why we love professional sports because what must you do every week?


Ocho? Update your resume. Update your resume. So I wanna ask Aaron Rogers. Aaron Rogers, what has those four MVPs done for the Giant Jet this year? That's what you do every time you step on the field on Cho I'm playing for my job. Yeah, But you, you, you, you already know what they gonna do though. You, you you already, you No, you already know what they gonna do. You know how difficult it is to find a quarterback. You know how long they just been looking for a quarterback? Even, even Yeah, I know they still looking even though Aaron Rogers is playing back.


It's the possibility. It's the thought, it's the hope that he's gonna play like the Aaron Rogers the bowl and even, even if he shows glimpse of flashes of the old Aaron Rogers, maybe for the just organization, maybe that's just enough to give them hope that things may change. Maybe. So if, if, if there's an opportunity or a chance for him to come back next year, guess where he is gonna be because of who he is and because of the exact same thing he said because of his resume, he gonna get a chance just because it's him. I, I I, I don't know. Like I said, I don't know Woody Johnson like a lot of other people, they seem to see that he and, and and the owner of the Jets, Woody Johnson is kind of like, they don't see eye to eye.


There's reports that he wanted to bench Aaron Rogers at some point in time this year, coaches fought back at it. Yeah. Fought back against that. If they want me to stay fantastic. If it takes these five games, maybe they don't know what I bring to the table. Nothing this year. But that being said, I love to play really freaking well these last five games. Yeah. Oh it's Ocho you see that's what I'm saying. He thinks that the normal rules for an NFL player. Yeah. Joe Montana, he didn't finish in, he didn't finish in San Francisco. M Ms. Smith, Bruce Smith, Jerry Rice, some of the historic great players.


There are a lot of one top 100 players that did not finish their career with the team that drafted them. But somehow Aaron think he should be exempt because of his resume. Can I, can I tell you something in that chat? Y'all listen to me. Yeah. Because his name is Aaron Rogers because of what he's done in the past, he's gonna get that grace simply because he is a quarterback. Even though some might not like it, we might not like it in just the honest truth. I believe there's a greater chance he plays elsewhere than with the chance.


Nah, I don't see it. Well you know the Devonte's gone after this. He's only, he is on he is on one year, huh? Yeah. You know, you might be right, you might, you might be right 'cause most of the pieces are gonna be gone. You Right. But where would, where would that be? I don't know. I mean they talking about everybody keeps hoping to get the old Aaron Rogers. You just getting the old Aaron Rogers. Hey, that, that, I mean, I'm not breaking news. Take that aside. I look if that man has, if he had another name on the back of that jersey, ain't no way y'all say that man deserves to get, get a, the money that he's making deserves another opportunity.


Absolutely. Or he earned forget Deserve because he feels he deserves because of his resume, not based on what he's done. Everybody else must feel I get this opportunity. I've earned the opportunity to play here Ocho to play another season to get another game. He feel he's deserving based on what he's done, not what he's doing. Yeah. And you know the funny thing, you know how he can say it because he knows he's gonna get that opportunity. He knows he's gonna get that chance based on what he's done. Any other position? Tackles, guards, defensives ends centers, D tackles, quarterback safeties will never be extended. That grace, there's always a special, there's always, oh no, there's always a special for a quarterback, especially one that is done with Aaron Rods has done in the past.


Even today, even as bad as it is, he will get that grace because of what he's done in the past. A lot of former players have chimed in on the al sheer of z al sheer hit on Trevor Lawrence. Bill Romanowski, my teammate said the hit one's dirty, but I loved it. Sounds like Romo Joe Thomas says the NFL needs to ban weaponized quarterback slides. Tom Brady suggested the NFL needs to change the rules to penalize late slides. Tom Brady says something very interesting. He said, they're putting it on us on the defense. Tom Brady is the wrong messenger because Tom, they had a rule changed. Does he not know the Brady rule was instituted to protect him?


He's I get it, I get what he's saying, but he's the wrong messenger. Right, right, right. Because a lot of these rules that they was put in place to protect the quarterback he benefited from. It's kind like what we see with a lot of Hispanics when they talk about yeah, deport, deport, deport when they got over here. We see, we know how they got over here. See, it's easy to say that expo facto, well, I'm here now. I don't give a close it. Don't let nobody else over. Tom Brady said, well hell, I ain't gotta take no hits. Punish the quarterback. Really bro. Really? Yeah. I mean, I Really, and IIII get everything that they said Ocho the late slide Patrick Mahomes from that seeming like he go to slide and then he wiggle and finagle.


No, that's wrong. Hunt punish it because all my listen to all my ette brown, he said that Caleb Williams had a habit of pretending like he's gonna go out of bounds and, and, and you try and they showed the clip. Dan Campbell say if he do, if he does this, y'all punish his ass. And that's exactly what happened. That's why they didn't throw a flag because he warned the officials. He said he had a habit of doing this instead of Just, We gonna put, we gonna put hell on his hand. See, I might not get, stop him from doing it, but I'll break his ass with the habit. My grandma say, I might not stop you, but I'll break you the habit.


That's all I'm saying. Tom is the wrong messenger. When he benefited one of, he was one of the most beneficiaries of the rule change who protect the quarterback o choke. So how is he gonna say this now? I I I think he's saying it because of, of the way the quarterbacks are taking advantage of the rule. The quarterback. He took advantage of it. Yeah. I mean, you know, he came, he can't scramble. He can't run, he couldn't run. Now they, they took, he took advantage of it in the pocket. The Owner at that point, it, it is on the defensive player to understand Why you putting on, hold on. He said the owner shouldn't be on the defensive player to protect the offensive player. That's what he said.


So why is it on the owners when his ass is in the pocket? Yeah, that's a good one. But I'm, I'm, I'm I I'm trying to get, I'm, I'm Trying. Okay, well I want you to give to Put, I'm trying to get better context for those that are running quarterbacks that are dual threats that choose to take advantage of this situation and they know, well, you know what? I can fake it. I can act like I'm gonna go out bounds and I'm gonna take it up the field or I'm gonna take it up the sideline. So Shazer, I understand. I I understand that was a lay slide. That was a late slide by the, I'm getting ready to say Jerry Golf. That was a late slide by Trevor know you, you, you got, you gotta protect yourself as well because that Wasn't a late slide Ocho you do realize how tall Trevor Clark is. That was late on six six. That was late.


No Ocho ocho it wasn't a late slide, but when you six foot five, you make it seem like he Kyle fur. Damn. That's a lot of man to get down into a sliding position. Hey, That's How many, how many times you see Aaron? How many times you see Aaron Judge steal a bates? Do you know how hard it is for him to get his ass down and slide unless they ain't got nobody in that position Like they got a ship on or something. Yeah, I mean they didn't, But that's, that's what, but here's the thing, it's just like a quarterback when they fake spike it and then throw the ball. What about that Ocho? Should you be allowed to do that? I ain't seen that since Marino against the Jeff.


That Dude, they still do It. I Quarterbacks afraid now. I ain't seen it in a minute. No, I think, I think, I think only a handful of quarterbacks have done have done that Right. Since da since Danny. But, and they put and the Jags to finish up Ojo the Jags place travel arms on Injury reserve yesterday likely ending his season. I think he's gonna have surgery, but he was dealing with something before. Okay, before this le Okay, ac he's had a, he had shoulder issues before that ocho. But all I'm saying is this, I, I understand what Tom is saying, but as a quarterback that's benefited from it. You can't say Ocho, you can't save, change the tax code when you benefited from the old tax load and you've made millions and billions
