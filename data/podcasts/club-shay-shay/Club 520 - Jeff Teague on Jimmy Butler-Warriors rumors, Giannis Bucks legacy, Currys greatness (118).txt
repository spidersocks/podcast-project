Carl Tale

6 (29m 14s):
Name

8 (29m 14s):
Dad. Yeah,

6 (29m 16s):
We go to work with those guys.

8 (29m 18s):
Oh my God man,

6 (29m 20s):
Something's wrong with y'all. Let's get off that basketball. Did y'all see that PG almost went to the Warriors this summer? No I didn't see that. They almost made that deal happen. They wanted more first round Pixie to do it. But it was basically around Minga, Budzinski, stuff like that. And the reason why it didn't happen was 'cause of the picks. And then we'll see Paul George being pretty much like the third option in Philly. Do we think it's about that time we kind of look at Paul George differently or do we gotta kind of wait it out? 'cause I mean yo well Paul George for 33, 34. Yeah he on his last, yeah he obviously on his last deal, max deal. But like he, yo now I say that as because the wars obviously got success early in the season, they're probably looking to make that next big piece because you're gonna probably wanna put somebody next to Steph to end that.

6 (30m 6s):
Or it's not him. It's not him. I mean, oh not him. But who do you think is somebody that could potentially do that? Or do they have to move on from Steph? Because I feel like they gotta get a name in there in the next year. By the least. You can't move on from Steph. Never. You gotta keep ridiculous. Steph has to retire a lawyer. I'm rolling. He changed the owners. All them. No, I ain't gonna say changed their life. But that franchise, he changed that whole, yeah that was a losing franchise all the time. They never would win it until Steph got there. Who do we want to play with Steph? I mean it consists, people say Giannis of course that's the easy way. I mean that's, I could see Jimmy Buter going to help. I don't know if that pushed him over. I see Jimmy B going there. Excuse. I mean his time in Miami probably up.

6 (30m 46s):
Miami's not that good this year. They got the worst third quarter team in the league. Probably Jimmy Giannis. That's a hell of a long, that's a, that's a stretch. 'cause Gianni's going to go down as a buck. I think he gonna retire a buck. Mm.

8 (31m 1s):
You think so?

6 (31m 1s):
Yeah. Why not? Like you won a championship and Yeah, you wanna play for championships every year. But it is unlikely like let's be realistic to win a championship. You gotta have everything go right. Yeah. Like the championship that he won, even though I was a part of it, everything played in our favor. People got hurt, everything went right for us to win that. Like we was healthy. Other teams weren't everything gotta go right to win the championship. So be the best player ever of that franchise. Set all the records, get your jersey, retire, do all that and be a long life buck. Why not Jimmy

8 (31m 41s):
B and Pat Rally not getting along? So I think he, I

6 (31m 44s):
Mean Jimmy won't get paid so, but Jimmy been to two or three teams, you know what I mean? So I love Jimmy to death but he ain't no staple in Miami. Yeah, that's true. De Wade a staple in Miami, you know what I mean? No that's true. So he can move around and it ain't gonna really shake nothing. And that's crazy because what the accomplishment that Jimmy has had in Miami, if he's in other franchises we might possibly be talking about a statue or other things like that. The teams that haven't been there 'cause he got the team to a promise that they didn't win. But a lot of franchises in those situations they would honor somebody crazy like that. But he's in Miami where they've won championships and they don't care. Yeah, I mean he was only did it for a couple of years. I mean what he been at four or five years?

8 (32m 21s):
Yeah. He been there since Covid about yeah, four years.

6 (32m 24s):
Yeah they gotta, you gotta win a championship in Miami when LeBron come there. Well LeBron gotta get a statue too because I No, no shade to D Wade. D Wade deserves a statue. LeBron deserved one too. LeBron gets a statue needs to be played for. Yeah, straight up pretty much. Yeah. Like LeBron made Miami heat the heats like D Wade, he is the, the guy for the heat for sure.

8 (32m 46s):
I, I get it. And

6 (32m 48s):
Not to cut you off but I seen him on the OGs podcast. He talked about he was possibly leaving that team going Chicago for the strip off that alone. LeBron kept D Wade in Miami Facts. But sorry I didn't mean to cut you off. No that's a, that's a fact. So he gotta get a sta LeBron really needed a statue for the league. Like some teams retired Michael Jordan Jersey like Miami, his jerseys retired and they rafters like LeBron need that too.

8 (33m 11s):
Yeah, I see him retiring. Yeah. Yeah give him a retire his jersey. But I think he deserved one in LA

6 (33m 19s):
Bro. Oh. I ain't gonna say he deserved one. Yeah he got a chip bro. Statue. He got a chip bro. I ain't gonna say he deserve a statue because do Shaq got a statue.

8 (33m 25s):
All, all those people that won

6 (33m 27s):
Laq. I believe Shaq had a statue in LA If I'm break, I know Magic got one.

8 (33m 31s):
I don't know. But Shaq

6 (33m 32s):
Got a statue in LA

8 (33m 33s):
For sure. Magic got one.

6 (33m 34s):
I know Magic and Kobe got it. I don't know where it's at but Playboy,

8 (33m 38s):
Mitch. Oh it's there. Yes. This all,

6 (33m 40s):
I believe Shaq got one.

8 (33m 42s):
Bro

6 (33m 43s):
Can definitely go. He got a ring. I mean they won three though.

8 (33m 45s):
Yeah bro, that's different bro.

6 (33m 47s):
Three and five bro. But bro, I I, I agree. I'm not going off accomplishments because if you basing it, of course it ain't gonna be fair because they only got one. They got multiple. But I'm bro and I got a ring here. Yeah I think bro got one. He need one in Cleveland and one in Miami. I ain't gonna say LA

8 (34m 3s):
Like he is not a, if he gets one in LA great. You know what I'm saying? I, you know if he get one cool. I'm not mad at it but I'm saying if they don't put one, I don't think that's bad at them.

6 (34m 11s):
Nah put one bro. But Jersey should be retired

8 (34m 13s):
Because does Kareem got one?

6 (34m 16s):
Kareem ain't got a statue do he?

8 (34m 17s):
I would hope so bro.

6 (34m 19s):
If Kareem might have a statue. That's insane. Yeah, Kareem better have a statue. Yeah.

8 (34m 22s):
Where are they? I been to the staple center. Where the hell in

6 (34m 24s):
Milwaukee or there? Yes, Kareem got yeah, yeah they got, oh

8 (34m 27s):
I was about to say where they, does he have

6 (34m 29s):
One in Milwaukee? I'm sorry, I didn't mean

8 (34m 32s):
From the building. You know Mike can't talk fast.

6 (34m 34s):
Mike. I would wonder if he had one in Milwaukee, Mike.

8 (34m 37s):
I shouldn't

6 (34m 38s):
Say that. Not in Milwaukee where you went to. So Giannis would be the greatest Milwaukee book of all time. Oh for sure He won a championship even though Oscar Robinson and Kareem did their thing. Giannis gonna set all the break, all the records. He been there the longest. He didn't, if he stayed there he didn't leave. Yeah, he the greatest Milwaukee book already anyway. And I only ask that question because I obviously the media, they're playing into the narratives. You know the Bucks have are struggling still right up Chris Middleton. But they're like all right, if he keep pushing coaches outta here and Chris Middleton don't get back 'cause it just reported that he's gonna have a little bit length. He ain't back playing 5 1 5 yet. If they're not good in the next couple weeks, you got Dame already frustrated who's still killing. Giannis is already vocally saying like, Hey if this shit don't get right, I'm out.

6 (35m 18s):
Is the pressure on? Like is he gonna really like what else can he do besides get somebody in the organization fired? 'cause he already got a coach. Who else he gonna push for to get this

8 (35m 25s):
Play bro? All this trying to get people fired. Hoop. Yeah like Brother Hoop

6 (35m 28s):
Bro. Yeah, like I say at this point it's like all right bro, if you gonna bounce, you gonna bounce. Right. But that ain't even been his style. That never was his style. Like he always just hooped. He just hooped. Yeah like to start pulling strings and stuff. Always be who you are bro. You not even one of them type of people to be like, hey get this dude outta here. I don't like him. If you wanna win, you wanna win, just tell him, hey we ain't got enough firepower to win. Let's trade somebody. Yeah let's trade for some more guys. Like it ain't like you ain't got a All star top 75 point guard. You got that U Top 75?

8 (36m 1s):
Yeah.

6 (36m 1s):
Alright. Tell 'em look it ain't working. You might have to ship out Bobby Porters Brooke or whoever. You, we need something else. It ain't Yeah, yeah. Trying to leave to go play with somebody else. The grass ain't always greener then you kind of dumb yourself down a little bit. Like you gonna go to Golden State to play with Step, it's gonna be great. Nah, but that's step shit like

8 (36m 21s):
Yeah that's definitely not yours. You already built something in a small market

6 (36m 25s):
Too. You man, come on bro. You the man. Yeah you gonna be love forever. You leave, you gonna break they heart like LeBron did but LeBron different. LeBron had a different like LeBron in the movies all yeah, it was different.

8 (36m 36s):
Yeah that is different.

6 (36m 38s):
And also he went back and made it right too. Yeah. So that's, that's really the

8 (36m 41s):
Different one. Oh honestly he ain't coming back. Most

6 (36m 43s):
Definitely. I mean he already made it right. He won one for him so it's all right. That's all you could ask for them situations. Milwaukee

8 (36m 48s):
Has no statues place.

6 (36m 50s):
Oh they gonna change that If Honest say had one, him and TA gonna have a statue.

8 (36m 55s):
His

6 (36m 55s):
Statue gonna be filthy. Whose statue gonna be better Ta or Doy? Wade

8 (36m 59s):
Probably TA's probably better artist in Milwaukee. All niggas in jail they draw real good out there.

6 (37m 9s):
The work release program is not making tenacious

8 (37m 12s):

6 (38m 7s):

6 (38m 13s):
The Thug concert. The first concert back in't in Atlanta though won't it won't be in Atlanta. That would be in Metro Atlanta? No, it will not gonna be in Savannah. Oh he can't go? Yeah it, it can be in North Dakota.

6 (38m 25s):
Suwanee so gonna be

6 (38m 30s):
Outta Georgia. Insane. But Meech can have a party when he get all the way free. He gonna have a party in Atlanta. It is gonna be,

8 (38m 36s):
Yeah because he ain't been from nowhere. That's gonna be monumental

6 (38m 40s):

6 (38m 58s):
Yeah, Miami while on tour for sure.

8 (39m 0s):
Yeah bro. I'm just thinking like he really like Thug Got the, the Booie, the Gucci he bigger than them when they got out.

6 (39m 8s):
Nah, he not bigger than Booie. When Booy got out, Booie beat Young Thug. Nah, hey Booy beat Crazy Death Booy was on death row. He beat Death Row and Cancer at the same time.

8 (39m 19s):
Bro. Y'all can have all that when

6 (39m 20s):
Booy got out

8 (39m 21s):
Bro. This thug getting out of beating this bro. Are y'all crazy?

6 (39m 26s):
I think what it means for Atlanta is a really

8 (39m 28s):
Way bigger artist. First.

6 (39m 29s):
I'm not saying I'm saying but when Booie came home it was different bro. Boys was really hype

8 (39m 36s):
Bro. No they was.

6 (39m 37s):
No, no for sure Free Thug. I'm glad Thug came home but

8 (39m 40s):
I'm telling you that that effect the thug is more influential than Booie fashion and music bro.

6 (39m 51s):
Yeah, but

8 (39m 53s):
Booey was big for us.

6 (39m 54s):
Booey was on death row. It just hit different

8 (39m 56s):
Like well yeah the charges is is different. But I feel like the way they was talking at first about Thug is the same effect bro. Like he thug is stadium worthy right now.

6 (40m 5s):
Oh yeah. Facts. Facts.

8 (40m 7s):
Boo Wasn't stadium worthy,

6 (40m 8s):
Booie won Stadium worthy. It was a little bit later in his career when that happened. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Booey was on stadium worthy when he Yeah

8 (40m 13s):
Bro,

6 (40m 14s):
Before he left he was streets. But I'm just saying like his effect when he like, I think it hit everybody different 'cause we just knew he was gone. Yeah like I was like he like thug. We all like Man Thug can beat that. We ain't think Booy was beating at like, I thought Thug was like, I thought Booie was gonna die. Like when they say he was, they put them charges on my brother like damn he over he dying, he gonna die in jail. And he went away for a minute too. He was comfortable. Five six.

8 (40m 42s):
Yeah I think, I think Poche gonna have a boosty effect when he get out for that generation Fat Thug getting

6 (40m 49s):
Out bro. All outta pocket. You know what's crazy

8 (40m 51s):
Bro? Nah, PO Shay got the, that's his generation and his, he the Booie them Shay, Matt, bro Shay, Matt's price going up when Shae get out bro. That's

6 (41m 1s):
A fact bro. Bro. Right. Everybody
