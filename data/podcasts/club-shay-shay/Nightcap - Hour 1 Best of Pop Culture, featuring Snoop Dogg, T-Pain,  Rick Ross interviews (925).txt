I think I heard that you working with Dr. Dre, you got some music coming Out? Yeah. Yeah. That Gonna drop? It's gonna be this year, next early next Year. Early next year. Me, Snoop, me, Snoop and Dre. This nigga Chad Fool. Yeah, early. I, I I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I, I I took, I took a, I took a little nap, a little cat nap. I'm back now. Back. No, I'm going to see Dre tomorrow to go finish it up. It's called Missionary. It's a, it's a, it's a record we've been working on for a while. It's 30 years in the making. It's the first time me and him did a whole record together since doggy style. And I feel like we both on our, on our a game right now, we both are like really peaking. Like he's proud of me, I'm proud of him.


And, we challenging each other. One thing about me and him, it ain't always like, you know, happy, happy, happy. It's like we challenge each other and that's what brings us the best right of us, is that I'm willing to go sit down and be challenged as hot as I am. As big as I am, I put that to the back seat and say, fuck that. I wanna go sit with Dre and let him do all the shit he do as if I was a rookie. So that way I can fine tune my shit and not be cocky and conceited, but be a student again. When you, when you go work with Dre, obviously he's at the top of the pecking order when it comes to producer. That's, that's, that's that does what he does. And you go in there and you are who you are.


How do you find that balance between him pushing you and you like, ho hey, hold up now, you know I'm the DOWG, right? Well, the, the balance is when I'm with him, if you watch our whole careers together, he's always been in the driver's seat. I've never Okay, been in the driver's seat. If you watch all of the videos and all of the depictions of me and him, he was always, I started off in the back seat and DOC was in the passenger seat, then I moved to the passenger seat, correct. And then I was able to adjust the music, then I was able to roll the windows down. I was able to put some girls in the back seat. You know what I'm saying? So, But I never was able to grab the steering wheel to drive because I would crash. He's a better driver at this than I am.


I'm better being in the passenger seat. Wow. Making sure that, you know, I'm doing the shit that I do. I know my ro and I, I know that he's the quarterback and I know that I have to run my routes. And I know that sometimes I may not get the ball or we may not pass, but I don't give a fuck. I'm a block hard. I'm gonna do all the shit I gotta do. So when he do finally told me to, But we gonna score that Down. When finally told me that motherfucker, I'm wide open and I got the coldest end on dance. You niggas have ever seen Snoop, we gonna get you outta here on this one. There's a lot been said. Obviously when the Super Bowl came to LA Dr. Dre, you 50 was up there, you brought I am you had Mary J Now the Super Bowl goes to lose New Orleans and the Native son, Lil Wayne.


And that goes to one of your colleagues, you know, K Doc Kendrick Lamar had an unbelievable summer, but he had, he does unbelievable music. I think he's one of Dre's protege. Wh where are you on that? How do I mean, o obviously, you know, you being in LA you can't have, you can't have performers in LA during the halftime show and DOWG ain't up there. Where, where are you on at at on this situation though, Snoop? Well, I don't really have no opinion, but what I do wanna say is that just remember where the NFL was 15 years ago when it comes to hip hop. How many hip hop artists was able to grace that stage 15 years ago? So I understand both sides of the coin and I understand how people feel.


I have no answer, no opinion, because I had the opportunity to get up there via Dr. Dre. I didn't do any Snoop Dogg songs. I was up there helping Dr. Dre and it became a great moment for all of us. So anytime anybody can get on that Super Bowl stage, remember this, it's a 12, 13 minute performance and you're not getting paid. So it's more or less you have to spend money to upgrade your show to make it master appealing for the audience that's home watch. So at the same time, little Wayne is the goat of New Orleans rap. Remember I was at No Limit Records for three years and I watched his whole career come to life and then watched them become the biggest, I watched him get bigger than me.


You feel what I'm saying? And I was gigantic at the time. Yeah. And I loved seeing his growth. And me and Wayne is family to this day. Me and Kendrick is family to this day. And me and Jay-Z and me and Roger Ell. So I don't know who is the decision maker. All I know is that I'll be home watching the Super Bowl and when the halftime show come on, I'll be watching that as well. Okay? Nah, you need to be in New Orleans. 'cause we gonna be on tour. Nightcap is gonna have a tour Thursday night. So we need you to be one of the guests on the platform. You Gotta have some crawfish and some gumbo. That's the only way you gonna get me there. We we'll have, we'll have whatever you, whatever you want. Want you want Coffee, gumbo. We got that Shade by La Porcher over there. We got whatever you need. Hey, hey, we got, we got the bl Hey, we got somebody that already got, we got a roll in the back.

And there's a song that Sauce Walker has man that speaks to me. It speaks to me. It's not an environment or, or circumstance that I come from. But listen to the, the, the, the, the pain in his voice when he talk, it's a song called Peace Treaties.


Okay. I know you probably, you probably ain't gonna listen to a chat if y'all know about the song by Sauce Walker called Peace Treaties. I've been listening to the same song on repeat. It's not even that long. Ain't but two minutes long. It just what he's saying, like, I could, I could, I could feel the pain in his voice when he rapping. It's called Peace Treaties. If I don't, if anybody know Sauce Walker, tell him I said, man, bro, I salute you. If you wanna get in the booth together, I'll let you. Boy. Yeah, I, we left off of 50. Get Rich. Do trying.

Yeah. There's so many ways we could have gone based on, on our preference. Hell, I could have, I could have went crucial conflict. I mean, I bought, I mean, I, I mean, looking at ours, we kinda like old school. We ain't really got no, yeah. We ain't really got nobody to do on here. Right, right. We got all them old. We got all them old dogs, man. So I went with all eyes on me. The chronic a t Aliens, G Jay-Z Blueprint, Snoop Dogg, doggy style. DMX Auto mention was DMX and Eminem. Yeah. Ocho went life after death Lo life after death. Nas Illmatic thought you was going with God son. Reasonable doubt. Jay-Z.


Little, little way he got call to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Juvenile Auto mention he went Dove C and sugar Free. Yeah. Man. Ocho you dirty man. Alright. Ocho Ah, What's your take Ocho? I have a question. I got a question. Huh? I love Wayne. That's my dog, man. Yep. You know, been in the studio with him back in the day. No name and a few Songs. What studio, apartment, Studio. Nice to be in the studio. Okay. I'm Just making good Clarification. I understand where he is coming from. Super Bowl being held in your hometown.


What better place for you to represent for your people and the fans? And, and I, I thought to myself, how many years has the Super Bowl been in New Orleans? Man, it done been in New Orleans more than any damn place. Right. So I'm, I'm, I'm curious. They had it in 2012. It was there in 90 when the Packers, when the Packers beat the Patriots. It was there when the Rams lost to the, the Patriots. It was, it was there when, when the lights went out and the Ravens beat the 49 ERs. It's, it was there in 77 when the Cowboys beat the Broncos.


That's four times off the top of my head. I think it's been there about, okay, so, and So, I'm, I'm only, I'm only asking how You laughing ask you talking about Ask, talking about, tell me. I'll say 1210. It's been there 10 times. Okay. I'll say I I'm only asking, obviously this is not the first time that it's been in New Orleans. No, no, no. It's been there 10 times. Yeah. Okay. Of course. But Lou, Wayne has never been hired or asked to perform. Right. What, what makes a difference this year?


I'm, I'm just curious. So maybe you can answer better. Maybe the track had answered better means. I think because of what happened LA when it was in, in in LA and the ran and, and when it was in LA they got Dre, they had Snoop and they paid homage to, you know, and so I, I'm sure Wayne was thinking like, damn Usher because he was a, he was, was had a residency or Smokey. I don't know if you, I don't know if you got a chance to see Usher, but that Yeah. Yeah. I, I went, I went real, I went real. He That, oh man, he did it. So Weezy like, well, damn, hold on LA they got the hip hop, you know, they got the, you know, boom, boom, Dre, they had 50, right?


They had M they had DO double G and Mary J Okay. Vegas Usher. I mean, what they gonna bring tr Wayne Newnan out there? You know, they're like, nah. So Wayne was like, okay, hey, you know, we the F baby in, you know, new Orleans. It didn't happen. Damn. I get his frustration. I I I'm like you OI Do too. I can see both sides because we've never, it's never been like, think about it, when it was in Atlanta, they had Maroon five. Think about what all the, think about it. You had temp, you had Luter, you had Future, you had two chains.


Two chains. You had, what's the other, the group Andre 3000 Big boy Outcast. Yeah, Yeah. Big boy then Outcast. No, They loaded. You got Baby Face, you got Jermaine Dupree, you had Usher in, you had bro. Yeah. In the eight. They have, think about it, they have Maroon five. Yeah. Hey, hold on. Maroon five got some hits. Now I'm not saying that, I'm not saying they, I'm not saying they don't, but you would think in Atlanta you like, damn, you ain't gonna play, you ain't gonna play no homage to what all they what they got. Right. So I get, so I like, I get it. But you know, look, I, I mean I, I don't, I don't know.


I can, I, I can understand his frustration, but it's not like, okay, such and such is from listen, we know Beyonce can't do it every year. And Taylor Swift, listen and Taylor Swift, that's who they want. Let's be all the way What? Right. They want Taylor. But Taylor's like, I'm big up. I don't need that. I mean, none of, I mean, Beyonce didn't need it, but Beyonce did. 'em did them a courtesy. Yeah, She did a, excuse me. She did a courtesy. Because you don't get paid for it and you come out your pocket. Yeah. Yeah. Remember, remember what I said? I mean, everyone's up in arms. Even though Lil Wayne came out and spoke about it.


Yeah. It still has to do a set. He has to do a set. I'm not sure if they have music together, but Lil Wayne might make a surprise that that was one of the first things I said. He might make a surprise. You, you nev You never know. You never know what Kendrick Kendrick may do. I'm, I'm, I'm not sure they talking about, oh, we don't want Taylor, you don't, but the N-F-L-N-F-L do. Oh yeah. I don't think they understand. They do what she does for the, the eye, the eye visibility. The exposure they want, they want that different, different crowd of eyes. Oh, What, what was that number when she came out and, and kind of like her support for Kamala. How many people signed up to vote?


It was crazy. I saw that. Like 800,000 people registered within 24 hours. Yeah. Right. Okay, man, y'all better stop. Look, y'all might not like y'all might not like her, but she's an earthquake. 400,000. Yeah. She's an earthquake. Like I said, Beyonce can't perform every year. Beyonce said I'm good. As a matter of fact, Beyonce was at 50 with, with it. Coldplay. I think she did. I think she did a set with Coldplay at Super Bowl 50. I was there. I know she was in New Orleans. 'cause I was there. Like, and I, I've been, I've been to a couple of 'em. You know, obviously I was with, with CBS in Miami when Prince did it playing Purple Rain and it starts to rain.


Woohoo. It started raining. Yeah. Yes. And to see, man, that little man can sing that little man Lord not only sing, perform, He's a performer. That's what he is. He's a performer. A performer. Hold on. And then can play every goddamn instrument, Piano, the guitar. Oh, he, All of them. Real deal. Oh man. Prince is Prince. He amazing, man. When he, when he had that group, you know, look, I understand the new power generation, but when he, when when he was with Wendy and Lisa, the Andre Simone.


What you know about that man? Come on now, man. Y'all up man. Hey, hey Prince. Prince might be the only one to be able to wear heels and get all, all of Them. Platform to get all the women. Yeah. Cat suit, Help Herm get all the women cat suit, get all the women. Hey boy. Woo Boy. Boy. Nothing. Ain't nothing like old good old cats. Who they there with? Yo? Oh yeah. Oh boy. Listen, boy, listen. Damn.


Yeah, Michael, Michael was in, Michael was in 93, I think when Michael performed at the Super Bowl. I think Michael was in Pasadena. Isn't that where he performed at? Because that was like the first Super Bowl I went to. I was a baby. It was 93. I I, I didn't go to the game, but that was the first, the NFL invited me and I had stuff I did. Yeah, I get it. I mean, I, you know, like I said, I, I, I think me, I'm kind of empathetic because I know Wayne, I know him personally and Yeah. But it's tough. Like you wanna perform in front of your, you know, in, in your city.


And like I said, I hope, I hope that Kendrick will at least bring him out. Let him do a couple of songs That'd Be live.

Hey guys, this is Matt Jones. Drew Franklin from the Fade. This podcast, we got a great episode coming up. Picks in all the sports, football, basketball. We do 'em all. But here's a preview of this week's episode. I made the biggest mistake that you can make in gambling, which is don't tie all your bets to one, no matter how good you feel. And I was locked in on the Apple Cup. I was like, Washington's gonna be Washington State. And then they're gonna take that flag that they take to game day and they're gonna drape it over them as they walk off the field. And then they lost. And I, I, I hit almost all of my other bets, but that one caused me to lose nearly all of them.


That was one of my big picks of the week. You know, apple a day keeps the doctor way what you're trying to do with the Apple Cup. That's right. It did not work for either of us because I had Washington minus six, I think. Yeah, I had 'em in teasers, parlay beavers. I had 'em in everything. And I had 'em in the Ks R of Parlay. That was my pick You, you everything. And they just completely poop.

You'll let you have it With the bet way. Listen now with the best of 'em there. Absolutely. This is a great opening ceremony. But I I I've been very, very fortunate though, Joe, that I've seen a lot of it. And I go back to 1984 when it was in, when it was in la the last time it was in LA and you come to and, and, and 96 when Muhammad Ali lit the cauldron.


Yeah. Nothing Barcelona. When the guy, the archer, if I'm not mistaken, he fired the arrow and it lit the cauldron and It went, went right into, yeah, that was dope. 2008 Beijing is the greatest opening ceremony I had ever seen. 2008. 2008 in Beijing. Right. Why you say that? The, the way they, the, the pageantry, those drums, what they had, they, and if I'm not mistaken, they say it had been rehearsing this for over a year and it was how many people that they had to have to get this thing coordinated. And everybody was beating on rhythm. Everybody was moving on. Rhythm. Chad, to be interesting to see what you guys think, what do you think was the greatest opening ceremony for me?


It was 2008 Beijing. Now I don't go back past 84, obviously, you know, in 80 it was boycotted because it was held in Moscow because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 76. It was in Montreal. 72, it was in Munich. So I don't go, I was born in 68 when it was in Mexico City. So I don't go back that far. I go back to 84, so that's about 30 years. Mm. For my, in my 30 years, Beijing was the greatest opening ceremony. And she, and if look at OCHO now, she on the piano, stop playing with him. Daga, you ain't got no out Like this.

I met Snoop back in nine, in 93 at Deon Set Prime had a celebrity basketball game when he was with the F then. Yeah. And I met Snoop, man that joker man. He's been the same from 93 until 2024.

I I, you know what man, do you know, everybody always asks me who my favorite team is and I, I've done a lot of halftime shows, so it's kind of whoever paying me for the week.


But I mean, at this juncture, man, I, you know, I hate to base it off of my relationships, but I do know, I do know Taylors who personally. So I gotta, I gotta kind of, you go with the Chiefs, I gotta, you know, I don't want to, but it, it, you know, all that money in them boxes up there just, you wanna stick around the checks, you know what I mean? Yeah. I just don't wanna weigh my own, outweigh my chances, but Right. You know, Hey man, good luck to everybody. But at the same time, only one of them done paid me so far. What happened? I'm gonna ask you this. There've been a lot of fans upset. They say they show Taylor too much and not focus on what's going on the field.


What do you think about that? Are they showing Taylor too much? I think they show celebrities the same amount. I think they show Jack Nicholson a lot. They used to, I think they show Spike Lee a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anybody that show up, I think they show Lil Wayne a lot. I think, you know. But you know, it's a, it's a white lady so, you know, everybody goes gonna get noticed. A little, little easier. Are you, are you doing, are you performing or are you in towns for the Super Bowl? Well, I, I'll start my residency tonight at Zoo. Right there, right next door. So I was just coming to say, what's up? I, I still ain't took a shower today, so I'm gonna go ahead and do that.


I wanna ask you this, lemme ask you this. I've heard you sing and I've heard you sing songs and you didn't have autotune. What made you decide to use autotune when your voice is as good as anything we have. Because if I would've came out singing, I would've just sounded like everybody else. No, you don't sound like everybody else. It would've just been another voice. Right. You know what I mean? Right. So there's nothing special about it. Like there's people in this crowd that can sing, that can out sing me right now. No they not. I'm sure there is Not in Duke Cinco. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, yeah. You heard that, that new Toby and to Toby and Cinco. Boy, that thing that ain crazy. Nah, nah but nah, I mean, I would've just been another voice, you know what I mean? Especially, you know, In the rap game, Dark skin dreads wasn't a lot of space for me.


You know what I mean? When I came out had be light-skinned, low haircut, it was a lot going on. I had to be able to dance. I was fat. It was a lot going on. It was had a lot going against me. Wasn't really working out for me. Right. But no, I I I made it through because there was something different about my voice. You know what I mean? Right. So I, I needed something to break through the fog. I heard the other day you talking about how you wrote a lot of songs or you've been writing songs for country musicians and the credits was kind of getting you in trouble because you was getting some blow back and you was like, man f that just cut me to check. Don't put my name in credit. Yeah. Nah. It, it wasn't really blow back. It was just like, I don't know what we can say on the show. You Good, you're good, you good. We rated it r the The comments on there was just like, was it the N word?


It was a lot of n word. It was a lot of it. It was a bunch. That was primarily the, the word that I saw a lot. Anytime somebody said I had anything to do with this song, they was like, what's this nigga doing on this dog? Why have you got anything we do with him? I thought you were a patriot. It was just a lot of that. It was just, it was a But did the check clear? Oh the check always clear and it cleared own time. That's the crazy thing. Country music. It's very punctual. Very punctual checks. You deal with some of these, some of these darker companies. Yes. Give you 90 days nigga days. The contract says it's 90 days. We're gonna send it in 91.


Babe, Do you remember when you was growing up and they ask you, they post date the check? No. Absolutely not. Don't pass up. Pass This. I put a Friday on it. Don't take your answer to the bank. Go Thursday. You can just not cash this for me real quick. I'm gonna come back on Tuesday. I'm gonna let you know if you can cash it then, but probably don't do it then if it's Wednesday, I'm gonna just cut you another check. I'm gonna come to pay another one because I'm gonna move banks. You see Bank of America, they, they messing me up. See what I'm saying? So I'm gonna move to Chase and I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come right to a Chase one. If that don't work, I'm gonna go there. I'm gonna need you to go to Western Union and with Dixie and then we can probably just make it work from there. Yeah. It don't work. It's just too many steps. Too many steps. What you wanna say Ocho?

You know damn, damn For the Damn What's happening. What's happening, what's happening, what's happening, What they do. Watch. Shit. Let me hold something right. Shit. You know, let me hold. So Boy, You can't. Yes, I'm proud of y'all man. Y'all make some noise for these two right here, man. Boy, we appreciate you stopping by. Know you got a busy schedule. I follow you. I see what you got going on business man.


It's always business and for you to take time out. The Grace Ocho and I much respect. It's too easy. Tell us about the book. You got a book called The Perfect Day to Boss Up. What made you write a book in the title? It was only right. Every day is a perfect opportunity to go to that next level. Straight up and down perfect day to write a book. Another collaboration New York Time bestseller with my brother Neil Belkin. You know what I mean? And it was just about taking it to that next level and make it clear as possible for that next generation of entrepreneurs. Just so they know. Yo it, this is realistic, extremely realistic.


I had you on the podcast, you were one of my first guests on Club Shehe and you was telling the story how you was always a hustler that you would aid for a little extra money. You was washing cars, but for a little extra money. Hey, I'm gonna rearrange your cassettes. I'm gonna put them things in there in alphabetical orders, all this, I'm gonna do all this stuff. You always had the entrepreneur skill. You always had the ability to, to foresight to see like, you know what, the homies gonna like this. That's what it's all about. Take it to that next level. Whatever you got going on, whoever your business partners saw, surprise them. Take 'em to that next level. You see, I got my brand up here, I want to try yours as well.


But that's what it's all about. I got my homie Jeremy Slippery soap, he in here tonight. So it's just all about always sharing that platform with my team. And that's what we do. We all see the progress. We all grow. You look back a decade later, God damn, Let's dope. Listen. You gotta think. Well, we go, well we go way back bro. We go way back. Way back. So I'm trying to think, when I think about artists today, how important do you think it is for them to build their brand the way you have outside of the music industry? But the thing is, you had the success to be able to do it through music, which made the transition that much easier, right?


So how do you answer that question? It's one thing about building the brand, but you gotta be good at the first part. That is your profession, Right? Right. What we all gotta accept and be realistic about it. It's like going to the league. Everybody won't make it to the Hall of Fame. You being an artist, everybody may not know how to go out and really become that product or sell products. It's a lot of huge artists that could sell records. But the young kids don't want to dress like 'em. So they can't sell clothes, they can't sell shoes. Nigga won't even wear they socks. You know what I'm saying? So everybody can't do everything.


But what you do want to make clear is the opportunities that are out there. So if you are a young athlete, you know what I mean? It's the NIL the game changing right now. But it's all about making sure you understand you are a business, you the CEO of your life and every day you wake up, you run it just like you would want to run your business Though. How I'm, how do you stay motivated, bro? After all these years? You got everything. Everything. And I follow you on Instagrams. You constantly thought, constantly, always doing something new. What motivates you after you've accomplished so much?


I'm gonna keep it real. It ain't, it ain't about a dollar sign. It ain't about a dollar sign. Even though I feel like Rose deserve whatever it is he want. And ain't nothing wrong with you feeling like that. 'cause you gotta go get it though. You understand? You know? Yeah. You gotta go get it. I'm a huge dreamer. I dream of things that I never, you know, never fathom. But guess what? It's so much more to go, whoever. Imagine in your mid forties or wherever you at, you under dig. Damn. We really just, we really just beginning the paper, really just coming, the experience really just kicking in. Now it's time to apply all that and let's go to that next level.


So I'm, I'm really, I'm still motivated. I really am. Obviously when you get to this level, there was some failures, there was some non successes. That's why I chose just a, a non-success at the time. Not many though. How did like you getting knocked down, getting back up and says, okay, this didn't work, but the next thing's gonna work Because I, I know how to accept certain things. I said this on my story this morning. Just because you may not have achieved or accomplish what you set out to accomplish, it doesn't necessarily mean you failed. You know what I mean? Sometimes you just gotta redirect shit, reapply certain things and then the shit could pop off for you.


So you going to take Ls in the game. Anybody who think they gonna go shoot straight to the mountaintop and not take no losses, you got it fucked up. 'cause that's going to happen. And believe it or not, we talking realistically in life, our biggest challenges have yet to come. So you better have your mind. Right. You dig, Man Ross, y'all had this, y'all had This summer going crazy. Yeah, we did. What? What? I thought all y'all was like, cool. I'm gonna be honest on some rap shit. It was no conspiracies. Rose name was said, rose, I'm gonna jump off the porch.


That's what I did When they call Rose coming. Yeah, yeah. You, you, you I'm gonna jump off the porch and I'm gonna have some fun. And that's what I did. I had some fun, you know, I just feel like it's a lot of dope shit being made, you know what I mean? We'll see where it go as far as I ain't talking. No, no, no, no, no, no, no controversy type shit. I'm just talking music. Right. You know what I mean? There's some dope shit being made, you know what I mean? We know the era I came up in. We know the ones who inspired me always get 'em. They flowers and there's some youngsters that's really hustling right now.


I want to see 'em take it to that next level though. Because being successful making music is one thing, but really marketing yourself and making yourself a fucking iconic worldwide, global giant. Making yourself a resource because that's what a lot of these youngsters have potential to do. That's what I want to see them do. Do you always have that ambition to like, yes, music is my entry, but I'm go, I see, I see myself as more than a musician. I see myself as an entrepreneur. I see myself as owning businesses outside of the music. Because Ross, everybody knows you as, as Rose. Right? But your biggest entities ain't got nothing to do with music Facts.


That's without a doubt. Yeah. Shout out to that lemon pepper man. Shout out. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? But, but I always had a certain level of ambition I did. Even when I couldn't dress good. I knew once my paper was right, I'm gonna be fly. I'm gonna be a fly fat nigga watching. You know what I'm saying? That was just always in me. Right. And so, and, and that's just, that's how it gotta go. You know what I'm saying? Every day I wake up, let's, man, let's apply this shit. Let's apply this shit. You know what I mean? You want to be a boss. Make sure you the best boss there is. Have some understanding. Make sure you communicating every week. Let's reiterate what the priorities are.


You can't give nobody no room to, to, nah, nah, nah, let's stay focused. This how we gotta do it. And that's what it is. So I knew once I had the opportunity, soon as they let me in the motherfucking door, I'm gonna go crazy. How do you determine who you respond to and who you don't? Because obviously me, I'm in this space now and you get people taking pot shots at you. Right? But how does raw stay like, okay, I'll respond to this, I'm gonna let that stuff go. How, how do you determine what you gonna, Is it, is it something to gain for you? Okay, Somebody wake up and hate on Shea. Shea hate on Ocho. I mean, let's sit back. Okay, Let's sit back because not responding is a response when you a boss.


Mm. Ah. You heard he said don't You? Yeah, because I ain't responding bro. I ain't responding to real shit. You know what I'm saying? Motherfucker might wake you up early in the morning to text you some bullshit. Hey man, man, get on that goddamn story and don't even drag. Hey, that is a response. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, yo, to get a response from me, it has to be something really for me to gain. If you just a mark who woke up and want to say the biggest boss name 'cause you like my sneakers or something, homie, that's, Hey man, calm down nigga. See you soon. Know what I'm saying? Tell us about Bumble.


Yeah. Bumble rum. Bumble rum. This is the fastest moving bumble in the game. Make sure y'all check this out man. What made you decide to get into the spirit game? Really it was just me being in the club. It only makes sense if I'm in the club every night or if I'm in the club three, four times a week, it only makes sense. I'm enjoying myself from having something to drink. And I find myself in New York City one night I got a big record, DJ Clue turned me on to Luke Aire. I woke up the next morning and say, what was that in that black bottle? I need some more of that. And that was just the beginning of me really. I met Brett Barish and really just, I just started repping.


Everywhere I went, I wanted it with me. And that was just the beginning of the relationship. Of all the songs you've made, you collab with some of the greatest artists of our generation. Do you have a favorite song that you, that you've created? I can tell you my favorite, my favorite verse. What's your favorite verse? Devil? The blue dress de my favorite song is Amsterdam, but I wanna hear from horses. Yeah, Those are timeless. Those are timeless. Yeah. I'm gonna Favorite tell you the reason, the reason why for me it's so hard to choose a favorite verse or a favorite record is because at certain times I'm in certain vibes.


I may wake up one morning and I'm turned all the way up and I want to hear John. Or it might be something that's just speed and running through my mind. Or it might be one of those mornings I wake up and it's, you know, damn, it's a santorini grease type of vibe. You know what I mean? So it, it's just, it depends on what the vibe is. You know? It's like getting dressed some days you want your shit, you know what I mean? Some days it's another vibe. I I, I interviewed Khaled and I talked to Khaled and he said when he was coming up with this, this, this song that you Wayne Hove and I forget who else was on it, I think who else was on it?


Friday? Yeah. He said he didn't let anybody else hear anybody else voice. So you just, you did your thing. Did his thing. Ho did his thing. Facts. When you jump on a beat, Ross, do you hear a beat? Okay. Obviously they let you play the, they let you hear it. As you are listening are you formulate like, I'm gonna go here, I'm gonna go there. Boom. Soon as soon as soon as I hear it, I already know what I what needs to be done. I'm a, now it's just how am I going to do it and execute it? Present it Because you know who own it. You know, Ross, I didn't you Oh, that's right. You didn't know. I didn't know. But if, you know, let's, let's say that you somebody after you do a feature, right?


And so you know who's gonna be on it. Like, okay, they tell you, okay Ross, we got you, we got X, we got Z. You know you gotta go hard because they going hard 'cause boss on It. Right, right, right. They going they hardest. Yeah. Yeah. So it, it, it, it most definitely when you hear whoever the collaborator is or if they already on the record, it most definitely a affects how you approach certain vibes. You know what I mean? But when I like when Callie sent the record, don't tell nobody. It's cool. I I did my verse. He may have had it back in the next hour. What? Yeah. Yeah. That's how we worked. Yeah, that's how you work Bobby. You Yeah.


Hey, you know you heard me? You ain't know me and me, me. No. We got a song. I like to hear him both. That's a fat A no. I Heard. No, that's a fat. We got a song. He really came to the studio, pulled up to the studio and he really laid down this boss. That's real Boss. You should have charged him 10,000 an hour to keep him at your studio. Now when it drop and you want, when it drop And, we go quadruple platinum. Don't be trying old I believed in you. Nah, don't. Nah, don't. Yeah, yeah. I'm like that on the mic, man. Nah, still look, everybody know you do great work.


My favorite song from you have and always will be Every day I'm hustling. Ooh Man, that, that means so Much. That's my anthem. It means so much. Still to this day, to me, I come out on the stage wherever I'm at. I just left overseas halfway across the world that every day I'm hustling. Come on that touch and resonate with all the real, it don't matter where you from, what color you are, you gotta go get it. 'cause these streets in life, this shit don't care nothing about you. Mm. Yeah. You grew up and you obviously you have close to people. And I think the hardest thing is, is that when you have someone that's been around you when you weren't rose, when you wasn't a boss, how do you determine who gets to remains in Rosa's life if they're not adding anything to Rosa's life?


With me? It ain't always about what you adding to me. You know what I mean? Because everybody may not necessarily bring nothing to the table. But were you genuine when it wasn't nothing on the table? Were you there when it wasn't nothing on the table? You know what I mean? Yeah. So everybody may not bring nothing to the table, but that's not how we going to judge your value. We going to, we going to judge that on the, the the genuine love. 'cause they could be a motherfucker that really care about you more than anybody and ain't got shit to give you. You don't cut them off for nothing.


With everything that you've done, with everything that you've accomplished. What could possibly be next that you haven't touched already? What's next? I Got a long list motherfucker. You know what I'm saying? And, and, and I'm just keeping it real. The list. It is long and it's gonna stay long. Let's, let's stay motivated, let's stay busy, let's keep moving, let's keep hustling. You ain't gonna win all the time. But let's keep going because like I say, rose, I jumped out here. I didn't sign to no huge, you know, I ain't have no big team of producers that no, we did this shit one record at a time, one album at a time, one play at a time.


And. we done ran laps around motherfuckers. That's what's up. Straight up Music. When is Rose going back in the studio? When can we expect the next album? I'm back in the studio right now. And you going to have a new album from the boss in December, baby? Yeah. Yeah. We be hell, we've been in the studio bitch. Fuck y'all. We Know I here Is there, is there anybody that you wanna tell us that's on the album or you wanna keep that low key for the time being OO Joe? Man, I'ma, i'ma i'ma give it all to you at the end of the year, you know what I mean? Yeah. I'm most definitely, we cooking up, you know what I'm saying? Shout out to my homies out in Houston, big Tony Sauce Walker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We just did a couple records in the last few days, so I'm just, I'm working with all the rooms.


Anything else I ran outta questions Rose bro, for you to be at before for you to come back here. You just got back overseas and when we reached out to you, you says, I'm not gonna be able to make the Miami show, but I definitely catch you guys in Houston, bro, that means the world to us because you didn't have to do it.

Give him a round applause That just goes to show you the love that this man has. And you know, I talk to him and I, I don't bother, I don't bother much.
