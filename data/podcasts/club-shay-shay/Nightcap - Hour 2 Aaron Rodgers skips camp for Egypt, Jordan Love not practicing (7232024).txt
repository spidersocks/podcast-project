Oh man, OCHO Aaron Rogers blames deceiving language on unexcused. Jeff Amster Rogers downplayed the talk over his decision to take a personal trip to Egypt and Miss Jeff's mandatory minicamps Rogers said now it's not a mini cap. They can arbitrarily put the mandatory tag or whatever week the OTAs that they want. Hey, what's wrong? Hey, what's wrong with young Bull man? What's wrong with Aaron? Man? Oh, and listen, Aaron, you the quarterback baby. Voluntary, mandatory. Listen, voluntary, mandatory. New team, new players. You got to be there baby. You are the leader. You are the face. That team goes as you go.

(3m 38s):
So you got to be there. That's the owners of being the quarterback. That's the owners of being the leader. That's the onus of being the captain. That's why they brought you there. That's why they, that's why they pay you the big dollars. Mandatory, voluntary, got damn no camp. You should still be there. Oh, Joe, you can't make no excuses about that, man. Everybody knows. Come on now. The last mini camp of the, of, of the off season is mandatory. I don't know now if they, because it used to be the LA you had a three day mandatory minicamps. Yeah, back, back when I played my last year. Ocho you practice in the morning. Yeah. You got lunch. You had like another 30 minutes. You had like an hour and a half you back on the field.

(4m 19s):
Right. You did that two days. That's four practices. You got off the third day. Half the day you out. Yeah. The last practice has always been mandatory. Yeah. You The one that said Ash, can you pull up what he said about we gotta keep this, this, this talk out the building. And. we gotta be, it's gotta be about winning. Not sometime all he said that. He's the one that said winning is not a sometime thing is an all the time Thing. All the time. Yeah. Yeah. Now all of a sudden you take off because you don't care. This ain't about Oh, a personal trip to Egypt. Man, listen. I hope, I hope, I hope they start off good.

(5m 4s):
I hope that offensively they start off good. They start off hot. I want Garrett Wilson, who to me can be in the top five receivers in the league. And in order for him to do so, that ball needs to fa be facilitated to him from number eight. They have a good offense. Brie Hall. Brie Hall are gonna take some of that pressure off of Aaron Rogers. Yeah. Gary Wilson Going, Gary Wilson Lazar and the rest of that supporting cast over there. The receivers, they're going to make Aaron Rods job easy. I just need him to focus and lock in. I need him to focus and lock in because the Jets organization deserves this.

(5m 44s):
The Jets fans deserve this. They deserve it. When, when Aaron Rodgers on point, when Aaron Rodgers is locked in and playing his best football, he can change the direction and the dynamic of that Jets organization. Hell, the goddamn af ces for that matter, they got the chance, they got a chance to goddamn win it because the defense is phenomenal. Yes. Phenomenal. One thing is missing. This is what Aaron said. Anything in this building that we're doing individually or collectively that has nothing to do with real winning needs to be assessed, needs to be assessed.

(6m 26s):
If you want to be a winning organization and put yourself in position to win championships and be competitive, everything you do matters. All this b has that has nothing to do with winning needs to get out of the building. So tell me, what going to Egypt, how does that help y'all win games? Hey, Aaron. Aaron. Oh, I'm just reading what he said. Yeah. This is what Aaron Rogers said. Now see, when you said, well, Aaron, you said this and then you took off. It was a mandatory minicamps. It's hard for me to believe that they all of a sudden said this was voluntary. And then once he takes off, the Egypt says it's mandatory.

(7m 6s):
I believe now we can go back and look it up. Right. And I guarantee you the last mini camp was mandatory from the time they set the off-season schedule. But somehow she think he slick. But you know what? You can't be slick to a can of oil. That's me. So he tries to You have to. You have. So here's the thing. He likes to parse words. He likes to play semantics. A word game. You, you, you gotta look at the language in the CBA. He. It would've, it would've, it would, it would've rubbed me the wrong way. He and I would've butt heads. I knew it. Yeah. No questions about it. Yeah, Because I ain't about, I'm bro.

(7m 48s):
That's the one thing I said about seven. It was never, he was never in front of the team. He would never put himself in front of the team. Right. Hold on bro. I gotta be here too. Yeah. So now everybody, everybody gotta be there. Well, Aaron got four Super Bowl. What? Okay, do y'all, did y'all remember the, the last, y'all remember San Francisco last two years? San Francisco? How that work out? Yeah. What the four MVPs get? It got him be by Jimmy G. Yeah. Jimmy G Well, well hopefully, you know, his, his antics and the taking off and the Egypt and you know, the, the Dark room and the I, whatever it is that, that Aaron does some of the things that he said in the past.

(8m 36s):
You know what can cure all that. Win a championship. That, that too. But just, just winning consistently, turning that franchise around, putting it together week by week, game by game. All this will go away and nobody will be talking about it. Jordan Love will not practice that training camp until he receives a contract extension with the Packers Love camp informed the Packers that decision. Gut Camp says the deal could get done in the coming days, but you never know. Said big deals. Take time. I feel we're close. I don't blame it. I'm holding in. I ain't a Okay. He holding now.

(9m 16s):
He holding in now. Yeah, I'm been holding in. He holding in. Listen, That's 50,000 a day. Hey. Yeah. He's, he's a phenomenal a he's a franchise quarterback. Absolutely. And one thing they, that teams or organizations don't play about and they won't make you. Wait. That's a player that has the skillset set that you don't play with. You pay that you pay, you pay, you pay that and it's gonna get done. It's gonna get done. I, I, I hope, you know, I hope they don't wait too long. Now. I, I hope They don't wait. Oh no, no, no. They gotta wait though Don look here. Maybe, maybe towards the end of the first week of camp, but, you know, once they get past two 80 and start getting back In the rhythm two I, Joe Burrow.

(9m 57s):
Hey, I, I need Joe Burrow. I need, I need that. I need that kind of money. Right. Right above or right below. What, what, what you Think above?

Melissa Jefferson would take it off. She'll take it out. Right. T Terry gonna run second leg. TT Gabby gonna run the curb and third leg and she gonna bring that thing to Sha. Carried. Oh yeah.

Ain't nobody, I Still don't believe she mess With Sid. Ain't nobody messing with Sid. That there. Yeah, I believe, I believe Sid, I just look, if I was her, I would win this gold medal here for two goals. Win the world championship next year. Right. And I would gear up for the 28th. I try to win the 400 because there's only been, look, the goal is she wants to run, I believe with some, with training. She can go, there've only been two women ever to go sub 48.

(42m 33s):
Right. Marina Co. In 85, she went 47 60. Nobody has ever, even, nobody's come close. OCHO and the, the great French Ma Marie Re, she won the hundred and the 200 in 96. People don't realize that. Right. But she did what she did what Michael Johnson did. Valerie Briscoe was the first one that did it. She did it in the 88 1, the four and two. And then she won. And then she won again. I think she won again in 2000. In, where was it? In 2000? Athens. I think it was in Athens. Hmm. Sydney. Sydney. Sydney, Australia. Yeah, Sydney Athens were oh four Sydney.

(43m 13s):
Because Kathy Freeman wasn't the 400. The Aborigines, I believe I man Ocho. Do you understand sub 48 4 there in the history? There've been two. Yeah. Two women. Oh yeah. Listen, if anybody can pull it off one From the Czech and Marina code from the, with the Germans. But we know, look, the program that they were on, let, I'm not gonna even, I don't even wanna get into that. Right. I don't wanna get into that. Right. She's never tested positive. There's nothing come out. She has the world record. It's one of the longest standing world record. Record. Right.

(43m 53s):
But I was watching ocho, do you know this, in 68 when the men set the world record, Lee Evans, Sr. I think Freeman, Larry Jones, I forget the other name, Vincent In what they said. Record The 400 meters. The four, the four by four. Right. Do you realize if you take out every American team, so you take out all the American teams, since that would still be the world record to this day, no other country has run faster than those four men did in 1968. Well that's how dominant we've been at this.

(44m 37s):
It's the four by four, four By one, four by four, four by four. Four By four. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. The Jamaicans got the, got the four. Got the four. But they were four by one, I think 36 80. They got the world record in the four by one. Right, right, right. We've got the world record. We've got everywhere. We got, I think with that 93, I think it might've been 93 when Michael Johnson, Andrew Bowman led off. Butch Reynolds ran third leg. Michael Johnson ran anchor leg, obviously. Yeah. And what's the guy name? He USC. He won the gold medal in 92. Oh, He ran second. He ran second leg. He ran second leg. And if I'm not mistaken, Andrew Ballman was the slowest one.

(45m 17s):
And he ran 44 5 in the lead off. Woo. Michael Johnson ran 42 9. Well, Mike, well moving boy. What's the dude name? Look at what's the, he's the coach. He's the men's coach at A USC right now. He wasn't the gold medal in 92 as a teenager. Or tw, what's his name? Mm. I can't think of dude that Quincy Watts. Quincy Watts. Okay. Quincy Watts ran second leg. Butch Reynolds, who was the world record holder at the time, ran third leg.

(45m 59s):
Michael Johnson ran ankle Leg. Okay. They ran, if I'm not mistaken, they ran 2 54, 29. Woo. Woo. But boy, we're moving. What, Bro, a do you under think about it now, the slowest leg was 44 5. Andrew Bowman and a lead off. Michael Johnson ran 42 9, if I'm not mistaken. I think Quincy ran like 43 6. And Butch ran 43 4. So that's what you're gonna have to run to, to, to to, to break that record. Everybody got, everybody gotta be on point.

(46m 39s):
Everybody. Do you know how hard it is to run? Because, because you staggered all the way around. You don't get no running started. So you stagger, Hey, that, that 400 ain't no joke. Boy, I love that. That's my, That's a, that's a grown. I Love that race. That's a grown man's race. Boy, I Love, Hey, I, I love the 400 and we've always dominant, we've always had dominant 400 meters from Michael to Butch to the UCLA. Used to have a dominant mid studio. Steve Lewis. I think Lewis won in 80, in 84. But we, we used to dominate.

(47m 19s):
We, we, we done fell back a little bit. Whatchu call? Need to get his stuff together, man. Michael, norm need to get the, get his stuff together. Hall ran 43 80. But the, I think the guy from London, great Britain, I think he just ran 43 74 to take over the world lead. But you know, Hey, we got the young bull. Quincy. Who? Quincy. Quincy. Quincy Wilson, right? Quincy Wilson. Yeah. He in the relay pool. He's, I would be surprised if he ran on the mixed relay. Right. Because you know you have two men, two women in the mixed relay. Yeah. Yeah. Quincy. So I wouldn't be surprised if he ran, if he ran one of those legs. Yeah. Quincy. Nice. Nice play y'all. Jamaicans.

I love the four oh meter men and women. Hey, it's a grown man raised there, boy. Yeah. But I like, I mean, I like, because here's the thing, Ocho, everything has turned into a sprint.

(1h 4m 53s):
The 400 meters is a sprint. Right. The 800 is a sprint. The 1500 is a Engel Brison. All those guys, Webb, all those guys in church.

You want me to, you want me to give you questions that you already know the answers to? That's not, I don't know. I mean, I have, have to, I mean, I would have to go, I would have to, you know, plug the computer in. I try not to plug The computer. No, because you just, you, you rambling off name because you already know who's won those events and who's Participating in those events. Well, I think thing for me, I mean, what, when you, like, when you follow the, I mean, that's the thing. I mean, even in, I was in college in, in 88 when they were in SEO and watched Flo Joe and Ben Johnson jumped out there and ran that 9, 7, 6.

(1h 6m 17s):
And he was out of his, you know, out of his mind with Yeah, he would move. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, as long as I can remember the, the first Olympics, I could really remember, probably like 84. 'cause they boycotted 87 6 was in Montreal. I don't remember Munich don't remember. 68 in Mexico City. Don't remember. You know, don't, I don't, don't remember. But from the time I can remember, 84 in la, which assembled the greatest boxing, you go back and look at the Olympians. I think there were 12 events. I think we won like 10, 10 gold of silver and a bronze. Yeah.

(1h 6m 57s):
We won 10 gold medals. Sweet Pea, Whitaker, mark Breland. I mean, we had Henry Tillman and oh man, we were loaded. Yeah. I mean, that's the greatest. I don't care what anybody tell you, whatever they say, nobody has ever assembled a boxing team. Not 76 with the SPX Brothers and Sugar Ray and Howard Davis. No. Yeah. Not sold with Roy Jones and No, no, no, no. The eight. Go back and look at the 80 14. Yeah. And see how many gold medals they won. And then go look at what they did once they became professional.

(1h 7m 37s):
It's not even close. Not even close. Hey, Lainey Rays back. Hey guys, so glad you are back. We all missed you so much. I have Laney, My 84 merch. My question is, which artist would be your choice? The headline, the next Super Bowl show? Well, you gotta have Lil Wayne. I mean, it's, first of all, Wayne New Orleans. It, it makes sense. And you gotta have, honestly, the old show. How do you, if you in New Orleans, how do you have it? I don't know. You can have it without Marcellus or Harry. Harry Connick Jr. They gotta play some role. Wait, Harry Connick Jr. From New Orleans. Yeah.

(1h 8m 17s):
Well, Harry Conig, listen, I done seen Harry Connick Jr. In concert, man. I done seen Michael bla in Concert. Man. If there's anybody, if they would do, would do a rendition or have someone play Frank Sinatra and a docu a docuseries. It would have to be one of those two phenomenal, phenomenal artists. Yeah. I never knew Harry Conner Jr. Was from New Orleans. Yeah. I mean, but He's smooth. He's smooth, man. Yeah. Marcellus, I think Winton Marcellus is also, you know what, the Neville Brothers, the Aaron Neville, he's from New, he's from Louisiana. Oh, I ain't know that. Yes.

(1h 8m 58s):
Okay. Obviously, obviously you got, you know, you got Master Peter No Limit Soldiers. Yeah. You got the five. Oh, you know, you got 5 0 4, you got the Hot Boy Hot. But you gotta have, you gotta have We Baby up there? Yeah. Yeah. Lil Wayne. You got to Lou Wayne would be nice. You got to, I mean, are there any women? I mean, I don't know any women, I don't know any female rappers from, are there any female rappers? Chad, can y'all tell me? Yeah. John Batis. I can't think of any female rappers off the top of my head that are from there. I mean, I, I would assume me That's, that's super throwback though. Yeah. I mean, cash Money, no Limit.

(1h 9m 40s):
I don't know how you mix Mar Marcellus and Harry Iconic Jr. There, but I think you got to Aaron Neville like This. Yeah. Mia. And they said Mia X is from Yep. Oh, Mia X. Okay. I I was gonna say Mia, I, I didn't even, I didn't wanna go too far back. I didn't think people would, people would even even know. But then you have to be appealing to the fan base that's there at the Super Bowl as well. Yeah. I, I think the thing is Ocho like, when you think, I think the thing that, that, that really helped, I don't know if Usher would've gotten it had he not had a residence out here.

(1h 10m 21s):
Yeah. 'cause Usher's from Usher's from Atlanta. Atlanta, yeah. And when you had the Super Bowl in la and you see what they did, as had Dr. Dre put that thing on, he had Snoop Dogg 50, even though 50, you know, it was like they had m they brought Mary J Yeah. That thing was lit. Yeah, It was lit. Lit. So I just think you, you have to have Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne have to be something. I don't care if you don't come out there and sing, but two songs. Lil Wayne got to be a part of this somehow. He got to be, I mean, you could make a case. He's the greatest rapper ever. Yeah. He's, he's up there. And many, many people, many people argue, Man. Did you see that thing they had on Family Fuel?

(1h 11m 2s):
Nah, Man, they ain't talking about who was the greatest rapper. Lil Wayne ain't make it. J Cole didn't make it. Kendra Lamar didn't make it. Snoop Dogg was number one. Snoop Dogg, I think I just, Who, who are the, who are the contestants? Just regular families? They, Yeah. Oh, Okay. I think they, they asked the talk. They asked 100 white people the greatest rapper. All They, They didn't have no, they, they didn't have no, they ain't have no Black verse. They ain't say Jay-Z Jay-Z was up there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Eminem, Jay-Z Snoop Dogg was one. Tupac, Eminem, Dr.

(1h 11m 43s):
Dre Ll Cool. J Biggie 50 cent. Jay-Z. Okay. Pty. How you not gonna have Lil Wayne? They, they, they don't know no better, man. I, I, man, I'd have been, I'd like, oh, I'd have said, I'd have said Wayne. 'cause I have got the X two. I'd have said, I'd have said Rock him. I'd put LL up there. I'd have put Snoop in there for sure. Nas, Tupac. No. Yeah. Nas. Yeah. So many different ways you can go. Somebody gonna get left off. Yeah, because you only got, you only got five. You only got five picks, Right? No, they put 10.

(1h 12m 23s):
Oh, it is 10. Yeah. Okay. Okay. They put, they put what you call it up there. MM was in there. M okay. Eminem. But he deserved to be Daddy does. Yeah. I mean, I can't, I love 50, but I can't put 50 before Nas. That's, that's what I, I'm, I'm not here to argue. I'm not here to argue. 2D Listen, two different sounds. Wayne completely off. Yeah.

No, I know what y'all want me to talk about, don't you? What y'all want me to talk about.

(1h 23m 27s):
Then one more question. Oh, Ocho welcome back. I felt I lost my two best friends these six weeks. At any event, would you rather, would, would either of you in track and Field Olympics? Or would would y'all ever make it to South Carolina? I got too big. I was a, I was a three time state trap in the triple jump. But bro, I, I, I wanted to be big. So I started lifting weight because I, I grew out, I grew outta the triple jump. I held a record for like 35 years in the state of Georgia class. Say, won the best performance trophy.

(1h 24m 9s):
All the best. I was all that. But that ain't what I won. I wanted to play football. I wanted to be big. I wanted muscles. So what, what you see what's in the chat? What what'd it say About Skip? Oh Guys, I honestly, I I, I actually, I said I wasn't really gonna, 'cause I don't really know. I don't know the ins and out. I don't know really what happened once I left Fox and FS one. I just wiped that from my, I still have friends over there.

(1h 24m 54s):
It was a great seven years. I mean, the friends that I have, you know, autumn and Tracy and Wardrobe, Brett Jumpsuit, they're still there. Cindy Makeup, who's head of the makeup department. I miss, you know, going into going in there talking to Edo Scent, who's my girl is security. Derek, who loves the Cowboys. I missed Joshua with him. And then when I got into the actual studio, and Bonnie Lou, who was audio, she was always my audio person. Karen was a stage manager. Craig stage manager, Johnny. But Johnny went to a lot of the big events.

(1h 25m 35s):
So he wasn't there as much as Karen and, and, and Craig were Melissa and what's the other guy? Name? And, and props. What? Jeremy? Melissa and Jeremy. I miss it. Look guys, like I said, I, I don't really know what happened to Skip. Skip gave me an opportunity. I've been very forthcoming about that. I'm not in the position I'm in if Skip doesn't give me the opportunity. But when people say, look, that's what happened when preparation meets opportunity. I was prepared when the opportunity presented itself. And I took full advantage of that. So I'll be forever grateful for Skip gave me the opportunity.

(1h 26m 22s):
I didn't, I won't skip to win. I want to skip to succeed. Yeah. And undisputed. And just because I'm not there, that doesn't mean I don't want him to succeed. I just realized that he and I couldn't succeed at the same table. But I want him to succeed. I want, I want me to succeed. I want Steven and I to succeed. I'm not jealousy anybody. I've never been jealous of anybody. That's not how I operate. I appreciate Fox giving me the opportunity. I appreciate Skip going to bat for me and giving the opportunity. But things happen.

(1h 27m 4s):
So I don't know what Skip's gonna do. I wish him the best, but I don't make the call. ESPN. And you know, Stephen a said what he said, look, at the end of the day, ESPN is gonna make a call. Shannon, don't call no shots at Stephen. A I mean at firsthand I don't. And there's this notion that, oh, the Shannon and Stephen a is call in tension. I'm like, what kind of tension? The only person, the only people that's ever heard my voice on the phone. Bi Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, Jimmy Pataro, basically number two. Him and Burke Magnus and Dave Roberts.

(1h 27m 47s):
I've been to New York five times in the studio. Ash has been with me every time Jordan has been with me. Every time I walk in there, I nod, I speak, I get my clothes out the closet, go into the green, go into our room. I get dressed, I go to the show. I do the show. I go home. They came to, they came to, how many times did they come to La Ash? Two, three. Yeah. A lot of times, most of the time when I'm doing the show, oh, I'm doing it just like this. I'm in the box. Oh yeah. So I'm trying to figure out, oh, the time I don't, I've never been on a call. I've never been on a call. When they're discussing topics, Shannon Sharpe has never been on a call.

(1h 28m 29s):
So I'm just trying to figure out how I'm causing confusion when I'm never there. Nope. I want the, the producer, Jordan, to tell you, I get, I come sit in my chair five minutes before I get my earpiece in. I do it with my child. Check. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, testing, testing, test. We good? Okay. I go through my routine. A a a I do the show. Take me a piece off, take my ear. That's my earpiece. I'm gone. So I'm trying to figure out where is this coming from, considering I don't talk to anybody but Ashton, Jordan, Stephen, a Molly and I carry on a little conversation here and there, but I don't talk to the producers.

(1h 29m 11s):
I don't talk to anybody. They've never heard my voice on the phone. I guarantee you find a producer that's ever heard my voice on the phone that's ever talked to me on the phone. Find a producer, find someone that says, man, you know what? I had a conversation for Shannon Sharpe for five minutes while I've been at first take find one person, not Stephen. A not Molly. I talk on the set. I take my clothes off. I hang on, back up. We out, I on the look. I don't know what y'all got against Stephen. A and I don't know why y'all trying to lump me in there. I ain't got no problem. Stephen a's been great to me. Me too. But I just, I, and I'm hearing this Shannon, Sharpe and Stephen a is causing rumblings.

(1h 29m 54s):
What? Rumblings. I'm in the box. I go into a room, look into the camera. Look down the barrel. That's it. I don't look, I ain't gonna say state your source. 'cause I understand how how journalism works. You never reveal your source because you're never going get anything. But I'm just trying to figure out how Shannon and Steven a is causing confusion when Shannon a doesn't choose a topic. Shannon, they've never heard my voice on the other end of a phone. Bob Iger, Jimmy Pitaro, Burt Magnus, Dave Roberts. That's it.

(1h 30m 37s):
That's it. So they just try to keep some bull job going. Ocho Always, Y'all can't stop what God has set in motion. I can't even stop it. And I'm the one that control it. Yeah. And I'm a I'm gonna be there too this year. If you think I'm not gonna be on first take shoot. Yeah. I'm gonna be on first take too. Maybe one, one day out the week. Maybe two days. I don't know. I'm checking my schedule. Steven a I know Stevie. They was on, he was on the day, wasn't it? Oh man. I be, Hey. I be, I get the cardio in. I be getting the work out here, Ocho.

(1h 31m 17s):
Boy, when your boy hitting this thing, woo. Hey. All right. You'll see. Wait till you see September. Now I'm, look, I'm not, not even September, August 22nd. I'm look like, Oh yeah, I'm like a whole different person. When you see me, you be like, God damn boy you was right. I, yeah. Little discipline go a long way. They just, they just, yeah. I, I see bro. But just don't lie. I mean they just, I, you know what it is, Ocho because I'm a very private person. Right. I'm very private. Yeah. They gotta make up something. Huh? They, that's what they do. Yeah. Oh. I was like, bro, really? Is it that serious?

(1h 31m 59s):
All, All I do is work. Like I said, even though I wasn't doing Nightcap. Right. Cocho. But somebody had to shoot Megan Good. Somebody had to shoot Megan Thee stallion. Somebody had to shoot Deonte Adams. Right. Somebody had to shoot those people. I think I might have had three days where I did absolutely nothing. Three Mm And man, you need to take a break. I said, guys, did you think I worked this hard to get in this position? Right. To take time off now. Yeah. But I wish skipped the best.

(1h 32m 44s):
I had seven amazing years. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm not gonna let six months ruin a great relationship. That's not me. I wish him the best. I'm not the opportunity that he presented to me. I'm forever grateful. I'm forever grateful Stephen a the opportunity that he gave me. And to be able to sit down and talk to Bob Iger and it says, I want you a part of this. To sit down and talk to Jimmy Pitaro and to talk to Burke Magnus and to talk to Dave Roberts to hear them say we want you.

(1h 33m 30s):
'cause at the end of the day, that's all anybody ever want is to be wanted. Any relationship to be wanted. So that's where I'm almost at. I'll see you guys. I'm trying to think, oh, I don't know when I'm coming back. I ain't in no rush. I've enjoyed my new tired, you know, getting in shape, you know, doing what I do. But we back, I mean, we back what?
