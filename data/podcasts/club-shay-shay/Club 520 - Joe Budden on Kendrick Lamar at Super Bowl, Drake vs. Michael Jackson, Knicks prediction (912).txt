Yeah, don't CVS the sick niggas don't even because they messing that CVS they just know saying keep pushing. Yeah. I don't spend a lot of time in like these red states so it's always like a culture shock when I come out. It's always funny 'cause I tell people if you come to Indiana, there's a couple different places in Indiana that's like some nigga shit. Like here, here Fort Wayne 2 1 9, the region that's black, everything else Indiana White. You see some black people in Indianapolis. You drive 30, 40 minutes southeast or north. You will not the white people out here still. Like they look shocked like shit. One of y'all out here, white people out here.


They know I had that shit at all. Hey you're outta here. No, they on that. Yeah. No I can see. Don't get outta Uber black. Whoa, wait a minute. What team you play for nigga? I have a job bro. We'll be here. My, you had a question for Joe? Yeah man. I know you had brought us up on the pod on your shit. We appreciate the love. I just wanted to know how you really felt about his take with the Michael, Jackson and Drake. What kind of shit this nigga on? I'm just saying we got Joe here. Joe was, you know what I mean? Nah, remind me the take. Oh well he said Drake sing better than I didn't never say he say, I said they sound they similar. Oh no he he went for it. He went for it that day. I said they was similar artists and what? And what I appreciate is that and shout to de po showing love.


Y'all always show love for us. We appreciate that so much. We big fans of the show. And you was just like, wait, I thought y'all was really trying to like go viral off that until his man said that we really wasn't. No that was, that was him. Oh yeah I when I said like this ain't for no script type shit. I meant that for real. Like we had no clue that tape was coming. First of all the game. Lemme explain myself. I ain't like he spoke about me. When the Drake shit came up before Real talk you might beed out. Yeah, I'm not. Let's talk about it. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a super Drake fan. I'm not a super please. I woody down Woody nigga said he sat down and was like, no certain people can't talk to Drake.


Shit. We here we here. So that's why you here. No that's not why I love y'all. It just so happened. Let's start, let's start with the first part. I said they about equal before Mike went white. I said so. So Mike was black. He could sing better than Drake. I was like when he got older, shit wasn't sounding that good. Cool. And Dre, that nigga was ready to fire on me. Yeah. Said fuck him. He's dumb as fuck. I was like damn nigga. I was just my fuck but cool I fucked up. Yeah, you took the music world by storm with that one. Yeah, I fucked up My bad. I watched that shit was like yep they cooking, they cooking.


This shit sounds stupid as hell but it's gonna work. The reason it started was not turned on. He iso the reason it started, it was the two biggest artists bro. That's all I was saying. Oh man. They was the two biggest artists. That's all I was saying. He said that piece more. Walk outta that one. All right I'm gonna leave that alone 'cause I don't even feel like doing that shit over. I know. What's the thing, if you say like a wild take and then you let it die down like a couple months it come back up. The whirlwind starts back up. But you did say that shit. Yeah him bro. It is him. I just wanted to know how, how my nigga felt about it. You feel me? Brought it up. Was the second part though What? I said people can't speak on Drake. Yeah. Like they can't now they can't because they Oh.


Oh see tomorrow boy shout to the trenches. Naomi Z Sled throw Tim Sled throw. But speaking of Drake and Kendrick, Kendrick doing the Super Bowl. Yes. How you feel about that? Yo, Hey this a petty fuck with y'all. Look I intro the topic. Get Super Bowl how you feel, shit. Yeah man. Oh shit. What up Joe? I was at, I was at the, I ain't even have time to really process it. Really because I what I was at the game earlier.


Okay. The internet was all doing the internet thing. I was, I was at the game so I ain't really, it's not shocking. It's not shocking Daddy doing it. They trying to he and Drake man it ain't a surprise. Who would you prefer if you was the one giving the, you know what I mean the order, who would you have performing in New Orleans? That's a trap. Kendrick, whoever's in charge of booking the talent at that level, I'm sure they have their reasons for it. We gonna get this nigga don't worry about it. That's way above my pay grade. So I'm certain there's a reason that they went with Kendrick but yeah man you don't think Lil Wayne should have been part of it?


I back revenge. Who's the say that he won't be? Oh that'd be crazy. Who's to say that he won't be. That's gonna be crazy. It has to happen. I know when they did, they did Essence Fest out there. It was supposed to be the Hot Boy reunion and that didn't pan out. But that guy Fe Weezy Fest I believe. Oh okay. Yeah I believe they do the set on Weezy Fest. Right. I think anytime Wayne is performing in New Orleans it's an event. Yeah. I don't know if the football people ever cared about people performing in their hometown. Yeah I don't think I've ever seen that. Yeah, that's interesting. That's a good take. No, no, no. That's a good from here nigga move and it's gonna be more people from outta town than New Orleans who attend that event for sure.


Yeah. Yeah for sure. That's funny. They not gonna mark the ticket prices in a way that the New Orleans people could come and support. Actually they gonna mark 'em up so you can't get in. Oh yeah. We know how that set up. We just had all star here that was not priced for people in Indianapolis to be in New Orleans Fall Star. Oh yeah. All Star was out here. I tried to tell my girl that shit wasn't flying but man I, we all big fans to the pod man. Well y'all ain't say how y'all felt about Kendrick doing the Super Bowl. Don't try to Nigga R opinion don't matter. Nah you can do it. They don't want my music, don't my music takes, music takes, I want no music. He's done. I'm not mad at done. No, but I'm not mad at Kendrick doing it. I just feel like for real and like you said, people from the city probably don't give a fuck.


But I just think like Lil Wayne deserves that eventually in our lifetime we grew up you a little bit older than us but we grew up on Wayne so it'd be cool for us to see Lil Wayne Grace the stage for one time. Like for the Super Bowl bro. Yeah, that's all. Wait, I can't wait to go on my part. I'm gonna talk so much shit about this topic. I can't give it to y'all. No, no, no. So I'm letting people Yeah it'd be great to see Wayne and that's true, that's, I know me. They had some what they have on Twitter saying that Wayne, he didn't have 15 minutes worth of his. That's what I didn't like. No that's Cap. When nigga said that Wayne can do a a Super Bowl iy, y'all very fucking disrespectful. He could do all features and it would be crazy if he felt like it. Yeah, that's what I was saying.


Like don't don't go to the music side of it because that's No, it's more business behind the Super Bowl stuff that any you of us ever know for sure he could do a set for sure. Yeah. It's not get crazy, it's not get carried away for sure man. We gotta talk about it man. Obviously you know what I'm saying. We big fans of the pod to see y'all progression. You know what I'm saying? To where you at now, what's one thing you would say to yourself maybe a couple years back that you didn't expect to encounter with this business venture? In a way things are changing 'cause you're a pioneer when it comes to this particular industry. A lot of people don't know some of the stuff that you'd be talking about and I could say a year in we all had firsthand have understood some of your gripes and understandings about situations. What's some things you made didn't think you learned but you just like I'm better for it now.


Maybe something I didn't think I would learn. Podcasts, break up friendships and happy homes. I never really paid that one too much. Mine. What else? Again, back to the Oh I didn't overt racism in podcast redlining the redlining of podcasts. I mean and that topic is coming up a lot now 'cause you're seeing all of the white people get like a hundred, 200 million. Yeah. So Kelsey family. Yeah, black, black, black podcasters mad. But yeah I would say that redlining and podcasts. And podcasts breaking up happy homes and friendships. Yeah. Damn. It's tough out there.


Very interesting. And it's funny you say that 'cause you're a big sportsman obviously. So like the way, how do you, from a consumer standpoint, what you do to see the sports podcast now become came? Yeah. Y'all fucked. Fuck the game up. Sports niggas came in. I hate y'all. I hate the sports niggas. Wow. And I'm being facetious. Of course I love every single one of the sports podcasts that are rocking. But I just feel like the sports dudes had a cheat code. Like the sports dudes would get to sit down and eh, lemme tell you what happened after game five. Like you don't know about. It was like all nigga, I'm glued to this. That's, that's cheating. Hey man, lemme tell you what I taking to Tim Dunkin after the free throw line. I was like nah you motherfucker.


It's cheating but it works. Yeah it works. I'm happy for all you niggas. Yeah but y got similar styles though on rap though. Like we wanna know the behind the scenes stories about like if you had beef with somebody or this battle, this rap battle, whatever, it's different because in sports there is tangible shit to look at. Yeah. And rap. Everybody thinks we Michael Jackson so everybody is sensitive. Yeah. Everybody has a overblown sense of self so you can't really say too much and then it's clicked up. Yeah And then it's clicked up. You say something about one nigga he tied to the five niggas you might need to speak to.


It is a mess versus sports where we watching the game? Lemme just tell you something that happened in the game. It's just the game. Yeah, right. It's no emotions. That's the fact. Unless you on some fucking Shaq to Rudy Gobert type shit, you're just going crazy with it. Yeah. And he hates, hates him. For sure. He hates him. I want Shaq to, Shaq is Big Jersey. Shaq is big jerk. I I don't, I liked what Rudy said to him the other day I did yo dog. I know what you're doing. I'm just baffled because I don't feel like you have to do that. Like, and if I never saw Shaq with Dwight Howard, then maybe I feel different. Shaq is to he to the man to be just every chance he gets shit on when he is.


Yeah. Shaq planted off the money though. That's his only gripe with the shit. Like why you getting paid 200 million and you ain't putting up half the numbers that I did. But see that's hate though. That's hate, that's nah it is. But I'm just saying like that's, that's all. That's just like a tell us about is the money like him with the Mac Krissy shit he obviously wasn't hate again people being stupid but just a comparison bro. The game grow evolves. What do you want to do? You want everybody to make the same money you made forever? Nah. Like that means your sacrifice with for no reason because nobody gained from it. Yeah. And everybody know the game though. Shit. You get drafted at the right time. You get paid at the right time. Which is how it go. Yeah everybody go. Shaq just the old head though.


He just the old head like, but he, it's funny 'cause he texted but you don't got knew that though. Yeah you Shaq nigga still supposed to be embracing, you still make way more money than Rudy Goldberg. Nah. And that's what I don't think he, he's not fucked up. He ain't meth head. As Joe was saying, he wear the White Castle but he's still good. He just like damn it's other players that's better than him. He feels like why the fuck does Rudy get this 2 25 or whatever he got paid over this player and he's way better than this nigga. Or why is, why is Rudy Goldberg and Yoki on the same pay grade? Nah, I get it. Yeah I understand. But I'm the same get six, 700 million. You don't feel like those thoughts just gotta live in your house. You gotta tell your kids Oh you give a fuck.


If I was making, if I was a billionaire like Shaq about to be bro, I wouldn't give a fuck. I'd be like good job Rudy man keep working. Yeah, but I'm saying Shaq probably just like, I don't know why, why? Why did Shaq go in the booth and dis Damien Lulu again? I don't even remember what that was about because hold on I got you Joe. 'cause he said Dam Willard Dame Lil basically was like I'm the best rapper ever from the NBA. Well now that one I'm not mad at this one then. Alright. Yeah, yeah, yeah he is. I mean Shaq did go platinum but he can't stop the rain bro. They done got one. I know a lot of niggas wasn't Platinum got one. A lot of niggas wasn't platinum back in day bro. That's different times though. Yeah, still because they just released it on streaming and it slaps and it still slaps. Dame Little can really rap though. He just, he can, he don't got a Biggie feature though.


Shap man. Well clearly he got Wayne and Dame Lab's album is hard. It is, it is. He got, that's what I'm saying bro can really flow. But I'm like Shaq you kind of a cheat code bro. You like the most popular motherfucker ever bro. He made that song that they made steal. Yeah like Shaq rap with the fu Fens. I know that don't mean nothing now but back in 92, 93 that was a big fucking deal. Yeah like to be able to keep up with those dudes. So yeah I think Rap Shaq just rap 'cause he could like Man I always wanted to rap. Fuck it. I'm gonna go get Biggie bro. He rich, he did everything. That nigga was a cop. Yeah, but I'm saying why Sha Dame Littler really I feel like got a passion for it. Not Dis and Shaq but I think Dame Littler like understands the crowd.


Sha Shaq rap better than Kobe. Yeah. Yeah. Oh you messy just asking. But you super messy as far from that. But people forget. I really like think Kobe was rapping. I they knew rapping. I hope they never research. Kobe. Kobe, Kobe, Ronald Artes. Now Ronald Artess had to slap on 2K, Steve Francis like delete Ronald Artes didn't matter 'cause wasn't nobody gonna say nothing to him anyway. Hey you did our po we was in here. Like he said pause. We thought he was about to break this door. Nah, I see I because I treat y'all like humans bro. Like Ryan, you out of pocket. He said he went up in a nigga ass. I'm like Ryan, we get you beat the sleeves off a motherfucker. But we nothing chill out bro.


Nigga y'all, you doing too much gun tuck. Oh the gun is near now man Peace. Nah, he did our, that wasn't wrong. We told him, I said bro I don't know if he can help you This these two niggas lemme tell you how Yeah he hell my niggas don't really fuck with me. I say pause these niggas silent. Usually they laugh at these niggas. Just say a word. I ride about 2 65. I'm 2 0 5 my best. Damn shit I can't get to my car parking lot a little bit away. You tone it down. Yeah Car.


The other one. That's funny. Shout to me The world peace. All the last names. I forgot 'em. But respect Joe. We know you a Knicks fan man. What y'all, what y'all gonna do? I see y'all had a nice little off season Danny Dimes. I know you don't gonna talk about them but I know your least. You feel happy about your Knicks Daddy Fucking daddy Doms. Come on you going viral for that draft is one of the funniest things of all time. That was nuts. That was, that was kind of nuts. That clip still goes like every year I see it when somebody do something stupid and rest in peace to dude. 'cause that's really why I was Haskins. Yeah, Haskins.


Oh yeah. Yeah. Rest in peace to Haskins. That's really why I was jumping up and down. Haskins is right there. But you know the Knicks though. We rocking, this is the first year I bought season tickets. Okay. Okay. First year I did it. Enough is enough now. I'm I'm convinced you locked in. I'm riding. I like it. I don't even think I've been alive to see us after the lockout final. I ain't even see us try to compete. We've never put a team on the floor to be like, alright we doing it now. That's never happened since. Oh the Melo team though. Itlo stop Jr now stop.


What? Stop it. They won 50 something games. Stop it. I know they did And. we was one Roy Hibbard block away from maybe going to the Eastern Eastern Conference final. But that was, that was never going to work actually. And which mellow team you talking about? Which one? I'm talking about when Mike Wilson was the coach. Yeah, Mike Wilson. When they had the vets, when they had Jason Wallace, Steve Novak and all of 'em. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Won 50 something. That team I thought could do something. No that was a good team bro. That team I thought could do something. Yeah that was first team all retirement home. But look what they Yeah, you stopped. What they believing a long time ago? Huh? You stopped believing a long time ago in the Knicks. God damn Joe. No, I'm a real Knick fan. So I've been there, I've listen, I remember jumping up and down for the Derrick Harper trade, like I've just been there long enough.


Yeah. So I ain't about to get along hard works. He sitting there Harper and Dolan was never trying to listen New Yorker lose, lose, lose and be sold out. Yeah. Jerry Jones. Yeah. Exactly. So this year, this year, I'm excited to see what's going on. I hope they pay Julius Randall. You think they need to keep Jew? Yes. My niggas Joe. Yeah. I don't You think they don't? I don't think they need to keep him. Why? Yes, y'all need, I just think y'all can get some type of value back from him. 'cause y'all play so much better. Y'all gonna play so much freer without him. He's a a ball stopper. Ball stopper. You about to say. Yeah, he do need it. And y'all don't want Jalen Brunson to revert back to like chilling and watching somebody play. Y'all need him to kill.


Like you saw what happened with Jalen Brunson. Without Julius though. You need somebody else. You about to tell me that's Bridget. But you need somebody else that's gonna put the ball on the floor and get you a bucket. Yeah. But you see And what value you gonna get back for him? That's a good question. That's a great question. Every time all NBA players, if you not, if you don't got a lot of value on the market, that should tell you something. No you no. That's Cap. What? That's cap. If you put your house on the market right now and it's a really nice house, you gonna put it on there for a certain amount. Somebody's gonna come look it. They can afford it. Yeah. I you go out there and you put a nice house on the market right now that's worth 5 million. Somebody come offer you 1.5. What's that saying? That house really say is not a nice house saying he ain that.


I'm not saying he's not a good player. Caught he three point cleaning up. I'm not saying took 3.5 million off that house. What I'm saying, I'm not saying he ain't a good player but what he do a lot of people don't value. He's a he bro. Right. I ain't we Right. He's 23 and 10. Yeah but the way he get it. Yeah like the way he get his 20 we have real basketball bro. It's a rough way to get 23. Yeah. When people get 23 a lot because you getting your 23 and 10 and you in the way and you stopping 10, you stopping the team from you see how much me and him never agree on shit bro. But this, you see how Jay Brunson flourished as soon as he was gone. Yeah. All of a sudden he became a star. He the face of the New York damn near.


See I think that Brunson was gonna flourish with him there I think. I think together they played well. I was real mad when Julius went down with that show. I like Julius, we the real JR. So he's the real, I gotta stop saying that JR R Smith's the real job but respect. No, but I just don't think, I think the ball in JB hand all the time like it was. Yeah. That's what made the Knicks good. Even if y'all are right, which I don't think y'all are, Julius is my man. Salute. Love you nigga. But it wouldn't be this season. Even if you're all right. It wouldn't be the song. He gotta, he gotta at least play. You gotta see what that looks like. You got, you gotta give it a chance. But I'm just saying train dead line though. So who you play then?


So you got, y'all seen Demon Chance to come alive right? Bench? Hell no. He got, he gotta get benched. What y'all talking me? He's coming. This nigga is Michael Jordan on the Hornets and he's coming off the bench? No, no. Tell me who you starting at please? JB one. jb You starting Josh Hart. Josh Hart has come off the bench If Drew's. Josh Hart coming off the bench too. He got to bro. What team do y'all have? I don't know what y'all nigga's even talking about right now. So who you starting, starting? Richie is starting at two. Okay. No. Oh. Mikhail Bridge at the two. At the two. Starting at the two. Who had the three? Hell no, Joshua og. I mean you still got OG OG at the three? Julius at the four Jules Mitch.

Y'all gotta, y'all got a lot of cold role players but when they get sp, the Pacers are playing. You gotta be joking. I like Tyrese. We good money Don't even he do stand up. Yeah, he do stand up. He joking. I like OG at the four bro. Like after the three he can play the three bro. I like he can. I like Mikel Bridges. But you have to start even Chin. Who bro? Yeah, he's, he the best shooter.

Everybody else who would like relies heavily upon guests. You see them like scramble for stuff. So it's dope to see, all right, I know y'all gonna make this content no matter what.

Fuck I, first of all, I fuck with all of them. And secondly, I tell every podcaster as they start, you gotta just want to do it. Like you gotta have a will to want to do it.


It's gonna be 10 billion reasons why you'll wanna stop doing it and days where you wake up and the only thing that keep you there is your will to do it. And them boys have it. They have it, they did it. They showcase it time and time again. I've seen them straight from the game, catch a flight. I've seen them just get it done and I'm super happy for 'em. I can't wait to go over there and fuck with them tomorrow. They the only niggas that could have got me outta here. I talking about some of Colts game nigga. I don't give a fuck about that folks.

So I gotta be in my living room watching like I, I'm a 49 ERs fan, so allegedly all the way.


My bad. I mean, I fuck with Z though. I fuck with Z so I fuck with the coach now. Yeah, I'm a, I'm a fan. I'm a fan of the coach. You, you a coach fan now? Oh yeah. I believe Blue. You see I got my shit on my day. Oh you shit nigga. That's Jeff Gordon. Yeah, that's the jacket. That's jacket. I fuck with the, Jeff was at the game now. He was definitely at the, at the February parade. Oh girl, I'm out. So bro, shout to Jeff Gordon. That was a good game though. Shout out to the coach. Nah, I want to ask you though, how you feel about the space that rap is in right now. Hip hop. Oh, I wouldn't know. I'm just R Yout tapped in. I'm r and beat out. I don't know what none of the rap niggas are doing.


What space is in, y'all tell me. I like it but they don't, what'd you like about it? They don't really like, I like how it's evolving for real. Like it ain't really no, I don't know. I just feel it's more versatile rappers now. It's not really stuck on y'all. Y'all used to look at, you know, lyrics. You used to go in on motherfuckers who really couldn't rap. For real. Thanks. Yeah, he was one of them. Them type niggas. But I like, I like how you know the space is evolving, like the melodic shit. I like that shit. I like, I like keeping an eye out for the business and watching how music is consumed and what's happening with the labels.


What's happening at the streaming services. I guess that's what I'm trying to say today. I don't really care what the rappers are doing musically. I care about how financially and and the business. Mm. Yeah like I think a lot of, I think there are, I think we're in a, the middle of a shift, not just in rap but in podcasting, in fucking the car dealerships I think mad different places with this election shit going on is gonna see a shift stock, all of 'em. So rap is just one of them and they got some things to figure out. Shit is fucked up. There's hundreds of layoffs, labels disintegrating right before our very eyes and maybe 2% of niggas.


Travis Scott just sold 500,000 and he sold 20,000 like that allegedly. He never, never sold no fuck 500,000. Man. I don't know why they keep trying to fool people with this nonsense. Yeah, it's just a bunch of smoke and mirrors now. So it's tough. It's tough. And then it's then I think it's probably a shame we in, we about to be in 2025. I think it's a shame that there is no rapper that just has like a grip on pause on what's going on for the next five years. Like remember when Lil Baby was on his run? It was like oh he about to take over for the next 10 years. It was like he got quiet slow. Yeah, it gets quiet kind of fast. It does. It gets quiet fast for rappers today. And I think that's a shame.


Life expectancy for rappers is a year and a half career expectancy. I mean that's, that's crazy. But they on average but I think Rod Wave got a long time in this shit. That's you named one nigga you said nobody. That's hey, that's a Rod Wave disciple right there on the average. I give you that. And if NBA young boy won't on all that shit, he'll still be popping. Well to this day that's the thing. Niggas is on a whole bunch of shit. So that counts. Oh that counts that that counts. Yeah. If, if you got a gift and it's being Ed because of some other shit, then that's, we gotta call Spade of Spade. Nah. Yeah but I was there for that one too Young boys about to take over 'em. Okay, let's watching Like who, where is the class that's running away with it?


So we are 2030. We know what we rocking with. I mean I don't know if he gonna be rocking from 2030 but Future got a, he got a good hold on the game. He don't really miss like we have a goat debate like our goat like yeah my goal is future for sure. His goal is future like he think but when I think about it, I'm like right now he probably like the best at we just to do a versus with somebody. I feel like not too many people can compete with future. Like he just don't really don't miss to me. I agree but future for me, me is like a legacy act now. Yeah. So I don't really look at him as, he ain't take it from the money from nobody else. His money gonna be for him. Yeah, he's his is his, he got it already. Yeah.


Set, set in stone in 2030. I don't even know if Future feel like doing doing none of this shit. Well he'll be that nigga be 50 bro. 50. Well that don't, that don't stop nothing now.

Yeah that's, that's, that's that's future slide. That's not everyone else.

Kendrick's song gonna be here. Nigga's not listening. Sexy Red 10 years from now what as great as she's, it gonna be even worse. It is gonna be somebody else. Yeah. Gonna be hurt. What's the one Get it Sexy. Say that one. What they dropping that back. That ass up. For sure that shit's gonna stop. I like that Psych. I ain't mad at that. You told him to stop talking about me Here you're here but to the camera?


No here. See the where the crowd react when she played that we went to her concert bro and she was better in her concert and her set than the closing act of that night. Yeah whoever that was. We ain't gonna say no names but it was Money Bag. Right. She shut, she shut that bitch down, whoever that was. I mean, damn. Who was it that's ain't that allegedly Money Back? I don't know. Moneybag. Moneybag. Oh Moneybag. Yeah she shut the, she shut the stadium down. What arena? I mean Barefoot. Shut it down bro. She was barefoot. Barefoot and she was pregnant and here in Indianapolis. It it was white families with their kids on their shoulders thinking that shit singing this shit. Yeah. People that even celebrate February differently if I'm Moneybag.


Yo, I don't know if I'm, I don't know if I'm letting Sexy Red open up. He didn't know. I'll be honest with you. I don't know if I'm doing that. I wouldn't have did it. That's a problem. She was, she wasn't even the sex, she was literally the opening act. How long ago was it? This was last Year. Last Year. Last training camp. I'm not doing that. That shit was Rock Last training camp. No, we, we woke up, I was there. I was like man people nigga we was walking on the floor like on the stage. I could touch the stage. Last year Sexy Red was sexy. Right. That song had just kind of dropped. Yeah, it had just came out. Whatever her first song was kind of dropping. She was catching crazy strides. She wasn't all the way but she was writing a cra. But after seeing that I was like oh this makes sense. I went to a Sweet 16. My, my step kid Sweet 16 last year October.


This was, that's actually when Drake dis Me child. The Drizzy man bro, at that moment though T no but at the Sweet 16 nothing but Sexy Red and all of them kids singing every word in unison. I'm sitting there like holy shit. So yeah, I could see that being a problem. So you don't think that's gonna be back that ass up for them? I do not. What She, she's a big artist bro. I don't see her dying off. I don't think she gonna die. But I just said five minutes. She ain't gonna die out like Meek Mills. He gonna keep having that round with that intro.


Anytime that drop, that's still going be, but niggas are saying they're getting tired of that. Yeah bro. But when it drop, it still. I'm not, I it on though. When it's on, it's on. Yeah. Say whatever. You might not put it on anymore on, but whenever I, I never seen people even doubt it. That's why I'm saying even to see the doubt or the hesitation towards it. Now it's like, come on y'all. Nah, when that drop it don't matter. You rap that shit. So I think it's a few songs out here. I see what y'all talking about totality. Yeah. But I don't know if it was songs back when you was rapping. Well you still rap but I'm saying no I don't. No, I was gonna say no the fuck I do now. I mean you probably be in the shi spinning the rap bro. You probably's. I don't write a rap. I don't think of sometimes I think of something.


Yeah, I know you do bro. Jokes cut the cat. When Y said, when Y said that he got out Rap you. I know you was just like, nigga, I got a verse right now. What was the Like nigga I got lie. The shit Yachty wrote for Drake is hard. I dunno if you, I dunno if you tapped in or not. I dunno. You heard some of that shit. He wrote, Hey that jumbo tribe boy that shit hit different. Shout out to Yachty. Shout out to Yachty. I joke crazy. This nigga dropped. He'll set you right on up. They Trying to get with that Mike Jackson shit man.


Oh man. Hey we had a crazy couple weeks. The Mike Jackson and then the D Wade. Oh my God. Don't, I'm not saying nothing about D Wade, bro. Oh the D Wade hard thing. No, no nigga Mike. No not doing that one. Who said it Teague? I just said nevermind. I'm not even saying it bro. Hey somebody tell me edit it out. I said James Harden was better than D White. Well I had him higher on the shooting guard list. Boy they killed me. Everybody might had e ESPN took the tape, went crazy. Oh man. Oh man, man. Yeah they took it. No, they ran with it. They had a whole little series. Now we was first take a block. Since we talking about basketball. I do one ask shooting guard in the world, man. Who? D Wade my brother.


Yeah. I had said he was four. He's a third. Guess I ain't mad at you for that. Yeah, I'll take D Wade to three. I almost thought that was like a fact. I didn't think that was something that could even be argued. I just said the way when I played James Harden, I played D Wade, I played James Harden when I played James Harden. Like everybody focused on James Harden. Like when you played D Wade, you knew he was cold. Like no disrespect, you knew he was the goat like one of the goats. But you just didn't like wasn't the same energy when you played the Houston Rockets with James Horton bro. You had to do everything to stop him. Like don't switch trap him. I don't know. We we had all type of defensive plans y'all doing like this. Not y'all, but like some of the newer age players that's doing this revisionist history thing where championships matter.


None. They don't. I mean, but you gotta see who we ran up this. I know, I hear I'm, I'm hearing this more and more today because it's Listen Joe, I mean go on game me up. We just talk about pure skill and he was played against these niggas bro. So you take the championships don't matter. It is who we game planted for. Niggas ain't game planning for Clint Capella and Patrick Beverly. You know what I mean? He played when D Wade had Brian and Bosch and he's just basically talking about the focal point. And for him to still have those statistics versus everybody in the NBA was a little bit harder.


Oh he was averaging 36 in the whole, he was fo and led the league and assist. But you tell why you telling me about D Wade on the Les? Because that ring before. Well yeah. Why you skipping a whole career? He's, but he's just speaking of his time playing. I'll give you, I give you an example but he didn't play oh five D Wade, I give you an example. No D Wade was a problem. I'm not saying that but D Wade best year. No, no. He was, I I ain't no hater. I I always tell everybody the truth. Nah, I think it was cold. But his best year, he averaged 30. He led the league in scoring at 30 James Horton Best year. He averaged 36 and led the league in assist and led the league in assist. Like what are we doing? N 18 was winning. Okay. He never got 50.


He never got made the playoffs. See and this be my problem with Hoopers sometimes and D Wayne Wade missed the playoffs with them, his team. Let's talk about, let's, let's talk hoops for a little bit. Okay, let, let's talk hoop hate you niggas. Let's talk. Y'all know that. Cool. What happens on the court is on the court, but in the boardroom somewhere there's a plan. It's just like a music. There's a plan that says we want to increase scoring. Yeah of course we want to increase the three point shot. Of course we want to do X. So the leagues that you're talking about are two different leagues. But you gotta think a lot. You want to increase it but motherfuckers gotta do it D Wade and shoot threes. So he was gonna be the same player that he is. Like even I don't think but but pre Steph, nobody looked at threes like that.


No they didn't. But my whole point when they did, James Hart was able to adapt and became one of the best at it. Yeah, I'm saying D Wade was still in the league when the threes adjusted and he still was shooting mids. You remember when they lost to the Dallas, they was shooting all mid Rangers. They was going under the screen. Him and LeBron was missing. We was in the league at that time. Steph was shooting hella threes. James Harden was doing his shit. We you don't think that's, you don't think that's tougher? That's tougher when you know a dude is not gonna shoot that shot and he'd still do what he want. Nah, I think it's tough from when I know you got the capabilities of making that shot. 'cause now I'm at your Mercy Inc. And then James stopped looking like James once they stopped paying him refs with them whistles.


I ain't, it was a whole that what's not looking like James What, James 35 and you still average his 20, you know moved it. Oh no, no that shit, that shit. Yeah. Yeah. No that shit was unbelievable. You can't knock him for finessing leave. I Joe, I didn't knock him. Dway used to do the punk fake. Right. He get you in the air. Yeah man. Paul Pierce punk fake get you to the free throw line. He still pump faking way. I give it to hard no d. Yeah he definitely still punk. Harden did all that shit straight from the strip club. Like hard. Hard. We gonna speak on that. I'm saying beat. I beat where the next game at. I'll be there. Yeah. Yeah. Like he was doing it like that. He applied to Vegas and he did it with a body suit on too. Did the fat show with the fastest I'm worked?


Hey that's one of got outta there. That's one of the fart negotiation tactics I've ever seen in my life. That nigga went full norbit and got paid. I want to ask you though, who's the greatest nick ever? Ooh. Who is the greatest And then I want your favorite Nick ever. Nick? Yep. Who's your greatest and your favorite? Greatest. Well greatest speaks to winning. Yeah, go crazy. So you probably gotta go fucking Clyde. Clyde. You probably gotta go Clyde. Well Clyde Fra is probably the greatest Nick of all time. Stay relevant still with them crazy ass suits. Nigga be on commentating the game. He's perplexing flexing shit nigga. Fitz crazy. The Blackberry greatest.


Yeah. Who your favorite Nick? Oh man, I got a lot of favorite. Nicks give us two. Pablo Poni, I fuck with Pablo. He coached me in Minnesota. That was my guy. I like he spoke about him before. That's crazy. That's not my favorite but I like him a lot. Yeah, that's, I was real, Pablo was cool as 39-year-old rookie. Yeah, I remember bro talking me hill stories about him. Yeah, Pablo was nice. Pop came from the trenches too. Yeah, pop he cool as fuck. I wasn't expecting that one. That's a good one. Who? Nah, I was just talking shit. He's not my favorite but But you a Dicky. I probably appreciate bro. Fuck That's crazy.


I pop with Pablo but Aunt Mason, fucking LJ four point play. Fuck like that nickname Sprewell after you choke. What's his name? Yeah. Oh. He like, oh nigga. Yeah. I like the niggas that are fuck niggas. You ever go to the game when Jeremy Lin was there? No shit. You should have went. That shit was crazy. We played him when he was on that run. They beat us too. That shit was, I never, I've been to the garden a hundred times. That was the craziest I ever seen the garden bro. It used to be, it was like 70 cameras everywhere. Whole floor shit was a zoo bro. I never seen nothing like that. You was guarding Jeremy Lynn? Yeah.


What did he do? I never thought that. Think he probably had like 20. I never thought that was sustainable. Long time. Oh. I knew it wasn't gonna work that long. He wasn't. He new. He brought the, when Melo came back he, he had the nerve to be, it's my team was some shit. Nigga passed the ball. It's open before the money side. It was kinda like, come on dude, I'm, this is my team bro. I don't want nobody that went to Stanford thinking it. Their team he went to he to Harvard. Harvard. Sam worse. That's worse. He had, he had y'all lit though. He did. Had a dicks lip until fellow came back and said alright we back to Ello. Didn't even really turn his knob off though. Like that. For real. That's crazy. Oh Paul was like that crazy. That was crazy. Yeah, I that crazy. Turn his knob off Joe.


Chill out. That was crazy. He cut it. Well cut the water off. Y'all niggas are outta Joe. You too damn old. I know, I know. First of all, you right, you right. But Lynn 70 didn't really stop. Mellow was kind of, and Melo my favorite player ever. But he was kind of hating on Li Insanity bro. He wasn't hating. Should've let him rock his year out bro. It went back to order. Order was the story bro. He wasn't hating but that was for Charles had to, had to punch Kobe in the face. Ba boo. Don't do that. Don't do that. He did though. He did. No, you can't even say that. He like, nigga I can't comment on Kobe. He a Charles Oakley fan. I can't comment on Kobe. I fuck with Oak. Yeah. Charles Oakley choking out the ushers is still one of my favorite means of all time, bro.


I don't like Dolan kicking him out. That was crazy. Charles Oakley coaching in the big three is funny as hell. That's wild. That guy see the play. He wrote up one day, bro. I hope one day they show they threw me on the play. He wrote up. It's the funniest shit ever. Him and Gary Peyton, I don't know who works between two niggas. Gary Peyton being a coaching big three is still one of my favorite things on Irv. Them niggas is living out. Like, will you watch your son hoop? They, them niggas sad ass nigga. Get that from your mama's side. Nigga GP asked that nigga, why are you sad? Asking the nigga why he saying it crazy? He doesn't wanna be sad but he can't fix it. Niggas who professionally bro. He is.
