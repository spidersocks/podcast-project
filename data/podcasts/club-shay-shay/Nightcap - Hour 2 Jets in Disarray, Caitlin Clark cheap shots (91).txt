Ocho, the New York guest locker room might have a problem with Aaron Rogers. Whether it's going on darkness retreat, going on trips, self-medication, or taking controversial political rants. Rogers has shown to be more player gold minded than helping his team win. Remember OCHO when he played for the Packers, he said that he enjoys winning Super Bowl MVP winning league MVP more than competing for a Super Bowl. On the Jets TikTok post two weeks ago where players were asked, what is the most overrated things Roger said, training camp. This attitude certainly caught the attention of his teammates. An agent for one of the players has raised awareness of Roger's bad mentality in the locker room with Rogers in the middle.


There are the completely, there's this, there is complete disarray over there. Look at how they've handled. Aaron Rogers has, one player had more power than him. He skipped mini camp and they have been able to convert into a team player. The vibe inside the building is terrible while other players are looking to buy in and get the team to the postseason. Rogers has shown once again, he doesn't care. I mean, god damn. Hey, you know what? On every team, whether, whether you like it or not in chat, I I'm I'm just telling you it's the way it is on all 32 teams.


There are certain players that are treated differently than everybody else. Yeah. If you treat 'em all fair, you don't treat 'em all the same. We get it. You don't treat everybody the same. Now at times, you know, there are certain players that really don't take advantage of that situation and having special treatment. I think Aaron Rogers is one of those who takes advantage of that special treatment because of who he is and the understanding that they do need him because of what he has accomplished through, through this league being a Super Bowl champion for that matter. And the situation that they're in. Dire need of a quarterback. I think he goes over overboard a little bit with, with taking advantage of the fact that they need him so much. But what you gonna do to me? I miss training camp.


Whatcha gonna do to me Miss Mini camp? Mandatory mini Camp. My my bad mandatory mini camera. Well, what you gonna do to me? I had other obligations at that time. I think he's one that feels he doesn't need it because he is been playing so goddamn long. But again, to me, team leader, new team, new quarterback, you missed a season last year. I'm thinking about continuity. Building chemistry with your players, with your teammates, and getting them to understand that you are the leader with you being a leader and the quarterback. You have to lead by example and lead by example is actually being there and showing up when it matters most. Even though it is mandatory mini camp. Because what's going to happen in those games when it matters most, you're gonna want those players around you showing up when it matters most.


Listen, Aaron Rogers has been playing this game for a very long time. He has, he knows how to play it at a very, very high level and he's damn good at it. He is he damn good at it. So the least for him I think is a little bit longer than most. A lot longer. Little bit longer than most. 'cause you ain't getting quarterbacks like that just falling off the goddamn tree. I've always felt that Aaron Rogers felt he was beyond reproach. Aaron Rogers felt because he's so accomplished low. Unless you were Tom Brady as coach, or if you was underneath Peyton Mannings, you couldn't talk to him. Mm. And he had this holier than thou attitude. And what happens if you feel that way in the beginning when you've accomplished nothing and then you start to accomplish everything?


How you gonna be ojo if I gave you my ass to kiss and I ain't got a pot to pee in and when to open it up and throw it out. Throw throw. Lemme get some money. Yeah. Lemme get some power now. I'll show you my character. I'll show you who I'm, Yeah. That's all he is doing. Aaron Rogers has not changed. This is who Aaron Rogers always been. Yeah. Y'all think money changed him? Y'all thought MVPs changed him? No. This is who you are. You are who you are at your core. A person that's benevolent, magnanimous, philanthropic. They didn't just get that way when they had got money. That's always in them. They've always been that way.


Who you are. It ain't on you. It's in you. Yeah. And all money does is magnify Amplify It. Your true cult amplified. That's it. Yeah. That's what it does. It makes you more of what you already are. If you a jerk before you got money, you become an asshole once you get it. Listen, before I had money, I was cheap. When I got money, I became a cheap bitch. When I got little up more money, I became a cheap motherfucker. But long as that cheap word come first, that's all that matter ain't matter. It don't, it don't matter how much I get.


I'm gonna stay the same. And I'm not changing. I've, I've always been benevolent. I've always given I got something. Yeah. Me and my brother would always like that. He got 10 do he got $10, he would go work, he'd come home, he might make $10. He'd gimme two 50. He'd gimme something. I got money. He got money. My sister got money. Yeah. I've always been that way. I've always been that way. I've always been generous with my friends. That's, that's, that's just who I'm, everybody ain't like that. I've always tried to be a, if, if you notice, like a lot of times when I gave speech that I was dressing team or my former teammates, I always end with this.


I hope you enjoy playing with me as much as I enjoyed playing with you. I always end with that because I had a ball. I tried to be the best teammate I possibly could. Did I push people? Absolutely. Because I, I was there to win. I wasn't there to be your friend. I was there to win. Now if we became friendly or we became friends, I, as a byproduct of that, I welcomed that with open arms. That's cool. But Shannon, Sharpe went to Savannah State to win. He went to Denver to win. He went to Baltimore to win. And in the process, I made some great friends, lifelong friends, but all I cared about was winning. That was it. That's what I was there for. And but look, he is who he is.


He's as good a of the football that we've ever had in the NFL. There's no question about his talent. And when we're not debating bad, you can't watch. Yeah. That's not what the debate is. But I just believe that there are things that he's done that's not conducive. There's no way you have that kind of talent and you've only been to one Super Bowl with the teams that you've had around you. What? That's not an accident, don't you? Yeah. I hope he has a good season. There's one thing. EE every, everything, everything going on, you know, the, the retreats, the missing camps and the things that he says, you know, politically, that that rubbed people the wrong way.


One thing can erase and cure all that Winning. That's winning Ocho CBS four's ranked the top 10 quarterbacks with the most approved entering the season. Number 10. Tour number nine. Trevor Lawrence, number eight. Daniel Jones, number seven, Sam Donald. Number six will Levis. Number five. Anthony Richardson. Number four. Bryce Young. Number three. Russell Wilson, number two, Aaron Rogers on roll. Whoa, whoa. Number one. Whoa, whoa. Deshaun Watson. Okay, I li you know what? I like the list. I don't like the numerical order of the list. Who you got where you, where you, where you rearrange it now?


Now number one, the Sean is, okay, now I'm gonna agree with that simply because of the contract situation and the amount of money that, that he was paid. And I'm sure he's going to get back to Deshaun. We're used to seeing This is definitely a proven year for him. Won't Joe? Yeah, this is, yeah. This, this is a prove year for him. I think Aaron Rogers at number two is, is is good love It is rich. Really good. Especially him for after, after coming off of injury season him at number two is good. And the, I think Russell, Russell at three is good.


And I, I wanna put the three veterans, I wanna put the three veterans first as opposed to all the young bulls that we have that we have left. Sam Darn obviously Adam, Sam, nothing Prove, I get it. He in Minnesota. You, He, I was gonna say he had nothing to prove because JJ JJ McCarthy's gonna be the starter for the Minnesota No JJs out for the season. That's why they got Sam. I know. I said now that's why I said I'm saying moving forward. That's why he really had nothing to prove. But again, this would be, this would be good tape for Sam Darwin to put, to put up in case he gets picked up somewhere else. Now you've already had three stops. Maybe you can do something with a fresh start at a new place and put film out that says, you know what, maybe he's gotten better because he has a another full season under his belt again.


You got Justin Jefferson. This is Four stop At the helm too. This is fourth stop ocho. He was at the Jets. He's at Carolina's. San Fran, not Minnesota Nines. Yeah. I would put Daniel Jones. I would put Daniel Jones. Yeah. Not, definitely not Bryce Young. He, he should be way at the Top. You got Bryce Young in front of Daniel Jones. Yeah, Daniel Jones. Well, damn. Will Levi only played, he only had one season. Yeah, I, this here, this a bully. Anthony Richardson is coming off of. I I don't, I don't like this list. I don't like this list. Now the only thing that I can agree on is the first three Deshaun, Aaron Russell.


Yes. This is, this for, for Russell Wilson. This is the make it or break year. This is the make it or break year for Russell Wilson. Yeah. Yeah. I, my, my problem is OCHO is that a lot of times you look at the guys, look at the contract, Deshaun got, look at what Russell was paid and Daniel Jones, they gave Daniel Jones money and they ended up losing sight Saquon because of it. Yeah. And he was, he had, he had basically an eight game stretch and parlayed that until $40 million a year. Yeah. So he has a So you go ahead. So you got Daniel Jones as your number four? Yeah, I put Him. Yeah, For sure.


And NFL quarterbacks can prove. Yeah. Now Trevor, Lawrence and Tua, excuse me, they just got these big contracts. Yeah. So Let's see. Obviously they, they, you have something to prove. You have to prove that I'm deserving because I didn't pay you for what you did. I play, I'm paying you for what I believe you can do moving forward. Can do. Yeah. So I would have them at five and six, Trevor on to at five and six and then, yeah. I'm not putting The guy, young boys that just gotta lead up there. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. Yep. So Deshaun, Aaron, Russell, Wilson, Trevor Lawrence and Tour. And then after that, I mean it's based on who you wanna put up there.


I probably have Sam, Donna with 10. Since the Browns guaranteed Wass $230 billion contra, this is what they gotten barely 12 games. Healthy and available 59% completion rate. Nearly as many turnovers, 11 as touchdown throws. 14. Yeah. That's why he should, that's why he's number one on the list. Yeah. I saw him, I saw him at the Super Bowl, stayed his healthy, said look good. I mean, he had surgery, said look good. I want him to do well because I, I I think people, because Ocho, because of what transpired off the field in Houston, I think people forgot just how great he was and, and the trajectory that he was on.


And because of what transpired people, obviously it's just natural people gonna look at you a different way and he hasn't. I mean he, he got suspended and he didn't play well and then he wasn't played well and he got injured again. And so this is this's make or break ocho. Yeah. I'm not saying make or break because the contract's still guaranteed. I'm just saying as far as how we perceive him and what we expect of him. Because at some point in time, Joe, you know, we can't keep saying, well man, you know, he missed a year because he did. Yeah. Remember his last year in Houston, he didn't play the next year he was suspended what, 10, 11 games. So he only played five the following year after Battle Joe.


He got hurt early. He Got hurt. He got hurt. Yeah. So you know who else can go on that list too? Who, I think this might also be a make or breaking season. Maybe, maybe not Kyle Murray. Okay. I can see that. I can see that. K Kyle, Murray. I just think the thing is Ocho, that contract and the way it was written, I think it made people look at him differently because nobody, we had never seen a contract written like that that we ask a guy to do away from away. Let that sink in. Ocho we need you to study X amount away from the facility. Yeah.


So we had never seen a contract written like that. Right, right, right. And I don't know how you think, how you think these, these insiders work. You thought that agent you thought that was gonna be able to sneak by and nobody with the Adam Sheers or the Jay Glazer or all these insiders Right. Wasn't gonna get a Mike Flores and all these guys. They weren't get ahold of that ocho Yeah. A contract written on That. I like, Hey listen, it made me, it made me mad. It made me mad the fact that they even had to put that in there for one. Because if he is a gamer, right, you have to think about this Kyler Murray didn't just start gaming. He didn't just start gaming. He's been good at his craft all his life.


Once you get to the NFL, you understand what it took to get there. You understand the work and the time that it takes and it is needed to be able to compete at the highest level and be a good quarterback. I think he understood that. And the fact that they even had to put it in there because it's, it's a hobby of his that he enjoys doing in his off time. It has to be some type of off time. Lemme ask your question. Something You do outside of the game of football, is It interfering to give your, is it interfering with what you do, what we are paying you to do? Clearly they believed it was OCHO or they wouldn't have put it in there If your weight is an issue. You ever had a weight clause in your contract? Yeah, I did. I did. I did.


I did because I Never had a in my contract either. Why? 'cause I was, I was too big. I was two 30 and they, they say I was too big. I had to come on down. That's why, think about it. They never put a call. Okay Shannon, if you do off season workouts, we're gonna pay you half a million dollars because they knew I like workout. They're not gonna put things in contract in your contract. They, they don't necessarily. So that tells me something was going. You do realize ocho, they can see how much film you watch. Yeah, yeah. They can tell when you watch it, how much you watch, how long you watch for. I think, I think they caught on to that. I didn't think, I don't think the players realize that at first.


Oh. 'cause you know, you watch, you watch it on the iPad and they keep track of everything. Yeah. That starts up, yeah.

He could, he could've been one of those quarterbacks that be out partying, turning up, having a good time out on the weekends, doing everything, doing everything else but hell gaming. That's where they draw the line. We gotta put some in the contract. No game. We can't have him gaming like this. They're asking him to watch film away from the stadium OCHO Stadium. Right. Think about that. Ocho, they don't game. But what about, can you, can you watch film as much as you gain? How much you making? How much you making? How much, how much they paying you? Are you ninja? Are you booger? Are you cast or not? I'm just trying to figure out what what I mean what's going on. I mean, you asking us to pay you $250 million?


Think about hey, and you know what's funny? You see how you just said that? See how they put that thing in Kyle Murray contract about him gaming. Now look at, look at the landscape. Look at the lay of the land now you got players with podcasts. Yeah. Away from the stadium. Now you got players like my dog sauce playing Call of Duty, Jamar, chase playing God, DTA, you know, but these dudes are making big bucks but still able to be able to balance. Okay, when it's time to work, I'm ready to work and I get a job done. But when I'm home quarterback, huh? Different. You know that. Oh, Okay. My bad.


Oh, Ocho, you know it's a whole different animal playing that position. Yeah. Different ball game. You right, you're right. I mean, You know that you, once you leave, you know, you know how it be. Yeah. You, you are already in there seven in the morning. Once you get five o'clock and you done for the day. But you, you wanna clock out. And when you clock out, you wanna clock Out. Lemme ask your question. You think Peyton Manning clocked out? You think Tom Brady clocked out? You think Patrick Mahomes clocked out? Oh yeah. Mahome be on the game too now. I ain't saying he don't be on the game. I ain't saying you couldn't be on the game. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I I know what you mean though.


I I know you How much time you on the game. Okay, that's a good one. See when you, that's a one when you left the huddle, you didn't care what the, if the, if the line ripped the Liz, you didn't care if they dual or Molly, you don't care nothing about that. Right. That guy dang gonna quarterback better know. He better know if they gonna rip or Liz or they gonna molly that. Right. He better know. Okay. Where am I hot at? You. Hey, you outside the number, you not hot. That's the slot receiver responsibility. Oh. That's the back responsibility. There's so much on his plate. So much. Man, look here, bro. O man, this money, I ain't, I didn't even think about, man, what you gonna do when you, man, I ain't thinking about retiring.


I'm thinking about this. I'm thinking I'm trying to be the best football player I can be right now. Man, I ain't thinking about that, bro. Like I said, I just have a, I had a a a different mentality and I'll make no apologies. Hey, you be who you are, but bro, Ocho, I ain't gonna lie to you Ocho it'd been hard for me to play in today's game because I'm not so You think so? I don't think, I don't think guys are serious about winning Shit. Boy. I'd be out here cutting the fool. I ain't, I ain't, I ain't wasting my time. I got my time is important bro. I, I put too much. I put too much, I put too much into it. Ocho all this, all this, all this foolishness and that dilly-dally, bro.


I'm trying to win. I wanna win. Would've been good though. These guys don't want elcho. The money has gotten so great. I don't believe guys want to win. I don't believe it's a burning desire and passion because they let too much bull jive go. You see your teammate bull jiving and you cool with it? Hell no. I ain't gonna never be, I was never cool with it. Right. Especially if you a guy. Look, if you one of these guys that ain't gonna play. Hey, but guys, if you playing, if I'm counting on you and you horse jiving around. Yeah. All I'm gonna say, when they ask me, here's what I'm gonna do, I ain't gonna say nothing.


Yeah, you, you would, you would working in today's game on you too. Goddamn damn serious bro. I wanna win Ocho. Do you know? Do You do I know you wanna win. You could win, but you ain't gotta be, you too serious like you supposed to be running for election or some shit. You can't, you can't be playing today's game. I couldn't ocho and I know that about me. I know that about me. Ocho I do, I do. I know that about me. Right. Because winning. Right. That's all I cared about. That's all. The only thing I cared about was winning. Listen, You could still, you could still enjoy yourself unc you could still enjoy yourself. Let your head out and, and, and, and, and have fun and win at the same time. I enjoyed winning. I enjoyed preparing to win. And I was miserable when I lost. I was miserable to be around when I lost.


A lot of times my girlfriend would go home when I lost. Okay, babe, I know you don't want to be bothered tonight. I'm sorry. I'll see you tomorrow. God damn. Huh? I put too much time in OCHO because you know why? The more time you invest in something the more it hurts. Right. That's why people, you see people when they invested a lot in a relationship, 10, 15 years. And it hurts. I'm sending flowers, I'm writing, I'm not saying me, but I'm saying they're sending flowers. They're writing, they're buying gifts because they don't want it to end because they're invested. And then you see people, they gone like, I ain't like I wouldn't with that person because they didn't give a damn from the beginning.


They weren't investing. When you invest in something, it hurts. I don't care what it is. When you put time in it, when you, you, you, you, you, you invested. Man, please. Ooh nah, e everything ain't for everybody. Everything not for everybody. On your Bronco's offensive lineman, Mike Glitchy was asked about Bo Nicks being named starting quarterback Bo come in and been authentically himself. And I think that's all you can ask for him. He doesn't have to be somebody that he is not just because he's a superstar quarterback of an NFL franchise. What you take from that ocho?


Man? I don't know. I don't know what motherfucking lenchi talking about. I only, I I don't like the sub. What? You dunno what he talking about. I, yeah, I'm listen what? He doesn't have to be somebody that he is not just because he's a superstar quarterback of an NFL. Dude, you told me you didn't know what he was talking about. What was the Point? I, what is the point of saying all that? You ain't have? So you do Know what he's talking about. You had to say all that. So you do know what he was talking about? Yeah, but listen, so whatcha talking about though? Hold on. I dunno. You on I but you just said Sublimity It sound it. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it sounds like. It Okay. Was subliminal. So a subliminal message is a message that you understand, but he gave it to you Sublimity.


So what is he saying? He Ain't put, he ain't, he ain't put no name on. Okay. No, no, no. So so you can't use subliminal be because you dunno what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah. I dunno what you're talking about. But I don't like, I don't like what he said. I got it. I, I don't like, I don't like the way he said what he said. 'cause the person, what did he say? The person he talked, but listen, he said he trying, he he acting like my dog. Russell Wilson wasn't being mother. You said you didn't know what he was talking about. I'm, I'm putting words in the guy Context. You said you couldn't say that because you didn't mention no name. Officer Lyman, Mike McGlinchy, Russell Wilson been Russell Wilson since day one. Russell Wilson been Russell Wilson a god-fearing man since he was at Wisconsin.


So he's always been this way. He's always carried himself the same way. So I'm, I'm confused. When he was in Seattle, he carried himself the same Way. And what and what was the pro, what was the problem the Seahawks teammates had with him? You do know, know, I, you Do know. I I What was said o you've heard, you've heard Marshawn Lynch, you've heard others don't do that. O don't do that. What they said you gotta you gotta remind me what They said we gonna say then we ain't gonna go back it. So you dunno. But you know what was said. So while you keep saying he was himself, they had the same thing to say about it in Seattle that they said about him in Denver. So you're absolutely right. He was himself. Oh, but how many people believed that was who he was?


Well obviously you can only listen. I, I like, I like that. I like where you went right there. I like where you went there. So if you only show one, one side of yourself. Right. I've only seen one side of him. No, but I've only seen one side of No, From what I heard and from the players that I talked to, what he was, sir, when he got there and what he became Yes, sir. Was two different people. Ah, now see, I wouldn't have around there for that. See, I, I wasn't have around there for that. I was, I was, I was with Russell Wilson at Bible study. That's Russell Wilson. I, I don't know what he was at bible study. I don't know what it was. School. I don't know what it was. Right. I'm just saying Right. What was relayed to me that people that played there Right.


Were people that played with him in Denver and people that was close. I don't need to get look everybody. Right. I know. But that's, that's, that's, that's the beauty of life. That's the beauty of life. At some point at time, as we grow, as we mature, we evolve. Sometimes we evolve for the better. Sometimes we evolve for the worse. Some people aren't going to be okay with your growth and they might speak on that in a negative tone, in a positive tone sometime who you are. You know what? I don't like the way he is. There's nothing you can do about that because you're changing your growth and your, your your willingness to evolve.


Mike rub other people the wrong way. But it's about what you wanna do Bad. Mike Zimmerman is backing down insult your way. First begin, began his FL career. The former, his head coach reflected on his firing. But rather than sharing some lessons, learned that from his mistakes, he seemed to blame his players. They asked me if I wanted to address the team. I said, hell no. They got me fired. Zimmer who admitted he hold grudges, says he's now watched one Minnesota game since bad ze by this damn by. They'll say, they asked me if I wanted to address the team. I said, no, hell no. They got me fired.


Hey, listen, you know, there is a saying, there is a saying in the NFL and coaches notice behind closed doors, players can get you hired. Players can get you fired for sure. Players can get you paid. Players can get you paid too. Not yo know. So I understand where Zim is coming from, but normally you don't hear that coming from a coach. If you know Zi, you do Normally you won't say, Hey, hey. Yeah, hey boy Zim coach. You know, Zi was the defensive of coordinator in Cincinnati. And I, I I know, I know, I know how he is. But that, that's funny. That's funny to hear. You know, coming from coach being truthful, being authentically himself and really not biting his tongue or changing, you know, what he wanted to say.


Hell, this motherfucker got me fired. I love it. And standing on business about that, I love Accountability. Ocho you know, I'm big on accountability and it's easy, a lot of time to blame the coaches, but at some point in time the players gotta go play. Yeah, they got, they got to. There's only so much coaching you can do. Yeah. There's only so much coaching you could do. There are only so many X's and Os that you, It better be them damns and some You Gotta damn them Xs and oss and Joes gym. Hey, age. Because you draw that up now. Yeah. Anytime you draw X and nose on the blackboard, they don't move. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's up to the players to go out there and execute it.


Coach asked me all the time, well, hey, 84, why you do that? I said, because when you drew it up on the board that that ex didn't move. I got on the field, he was moving all over the damn place. So I think I had to adjust. Yeah. Yeah. Outta his hell no, hell no. They got me fine. But them funny man, Man, the Eagles are ending a new era without Jason. Kelsey. Not only was Kelsey the primary leader in the locker room, but also someone who had handled duties on the offense. In fact, he handled some things. Jaylen Hearst didn't have to, but that all changes this year. Herst said the eagerness to learn was halted due to Kelsey's expertise.


So, you know, a lot of times, you know, you, we saw a couple of times Kelsey and Hertz disagreeing. Kelsey wanted the protection to go one way. Hertz started, should go another way. Now, you know, Kelsey being who he was, being the leader, being in the locker room, being a very, a senior guy. Yeah. I felt he needed to fall back, but no longer. We had a great player, Jason Kel, who took a lot of responsibility as a result of that. I was told not to worry about a lot of things. And so my eagerness to learn over the years kind of was halted. But now times are different. Ocho what do you expect from her? Hurts. I I like it.


I like it. I I like it. I like the fact that he wants to know. But you know, it's a lot, it's a lot to learn when it comes to the center position. The center position is the goddamn go that holds that line Together. He gotta be, It all goes, it all goes and starts with the, the, with the, with the center position. So now the fact that Herst will also know the calls that are made A lot of, he's gonna be making, because we, they, they turned it. That was Kelsey. You remember what he said? Right? He said, Hey, don't you, But they turned it over to her, Her that was Kelsey. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Let Jason handle it. So he's ripping Liz. He's making it through, okay, we gonna, Molly, we gonna do it. Or how, how, you know, how what, what are we gonna, what are we gonna do here?


Yeah. Now he's the senior guy. They got a new center. He says, it's on my shoulder. Yeah. And I'm eager Yeah. To learn. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure he is gonna be fine. Listen, his, his plate has become just that much more full now you have to take on a much bigger load. You already, you already have enough to worry about as a quarterback when you come to the line of scrimmage. Yes. Obviously, you know, pointing out the mic, watching the safety point at the safety, being able to understand the hot reads, knowing what's going on. So he has a lot to learn and a lot on his plate. But I think, I think hers is gonna be fine. Yeah. It comes with the territory of playing the quarterback acquisition. It just does, that's why it commands the kind of money it does as well.


'cause you have so much to worry about. But I I, I think it's gonna be fine. Especially the game of football hadn't changed. He'd been playing the game of football for a very long time. Defenses haven't changed. It's just a lot of 'em. You have to know, a lot of 'em, you have to learn about. Well, I, I think, I think her, I think it'd be, it'd Be okay if you go back and look at some of the NFL films. You saw one of the arguments that Peyton and Jeff Saturday got into it about, about who's gonna call it. Yeah. And, and Peyton was like, Hey, yeah, shut the bleep up. I go, I'm gonna call it. I I got it. You know, they going back and forth because a lot of times with a guy like Peyton, you're like, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got this. Because if you missed this call, I get hit in the back of my head. If I get hit in the back of my head and I'll make a call, I can live with that.


If I get hit in the back of my head, you make a call, I'm gonna put my foot in your ass. You as, yeah. So I'm not surprised by this. Jaylen Hertz lost six of his last seven starts after starting 29 and four in his previous 33, including the playoffs. Hertz still has an important and a very good, no good, great supporting cast. AJ Brown, Devonte Smith, and now Sequan Barkley. And they just traded for Johan Dawson. Johan, yes. Go Boy. Ocho check this out. They Got a night. They got a nice three headed monster over there. Another day. Another non basketball player on Kaitlyn Clark. The Sky have committed more than their share hard files on Kaitlyn Clark.


Diamond de Shields got into the action on Friday. She filed Clark twice in a span of 40 seconds in the fourth quarter of the fevers 189 81 victory. And later knocking her down. The play was ruled flagrant. One. The Shields given Clark two free throws. Clark made both free throws reached a career high. 31 points Oh for the game. Oh, 30 points. 12 assists also hold on with the first game and also the record for the first 30 point 12 assist game in WNBA history Ocho 17% of the Wwn NBA's flagrant files this season have been committed against Kaitlyn Clark. Hey Ocho, 17% of the WNBA flagrant files have been committed against Clark.


The Chicago Sky. Were responsible for 80% of the flagrant files committed against Clark. But you know what Ocho it's the great white height. There's nothing Shannon. You just wanna support that white girl. She busted y'all ass Hey. there was some women, I ain't gonna call y'all name. Y'all had a lot to say. Y'all even tag me. I why y'all tagging me? Somebody say something to y'all. Y'all tag me. Who that? Who that? I ain't call a name. I ain't gonna get into it. I, I, I ain't, I I ain't petty like that, but Right. Hey ladies, when people say things to you, God, I I don't think you should be what they say, call you all kind of names.


I don't believe nobody should be called outta the names. But I don't know why. When somebody address y'all, y'all feel y'all need to tag me. They're, they're addressing y'all. If they want to address me. Right. They would address me. Y'all keep me out of this. Y'all keep me out of this. Y'all said what y'all said, but I'm just trying to figure why y'all lump me in the No, no. They talking to y'all. They talking to me. Y'all try to make me What? You don't. If you like Kaitlyn Clark, you gotta hate Angel And. if you hate, if you love Angel, you can't say anything good about Kaitlyn Clark. Y'all can't tell me what the f to say. I'm gonna say what I wanna say. Yeah.


Now back to my originally scheduled programming. Kayla Clark doing a thing on the Mocho. Ha ha ha Ha. Yeah, she had, she had, she had that cutting up. Now she had that cutting up. Listen, you notice how the season, as the season has gone on, how she gotten a little bit more Comfortable. I thought they the women that you got a little bit More battle. What about these women that followed that car? I thought they would know that. I thought they would know. The way they talk about it, one of them coach Right, they cover the game. They got podcasts and they cover all these sports. Right now, all of a sudden I stand No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ooh, she sharp on both sides. Cutting ass left or right. Yeah.


Yeah. She, she playing good ball though. Good. She playing good basketball. Is that what you saying? She playing? Yeah. I hate to see if she was playing right. Yeah, she can, she playing, she playing, she playing good basketball. Listen, like all hands, hands hat off to Kaitlyn Clark. She playing some damn good basketball. She, But she's a good player. Ocho and if, if, if, if you set aside the fact that, look, people giving her credit and I get it situation and hey, well what about all these old heads that didn't, bro, what about all the old head that never got the love and admiration that Michael Jordan got when he came into league? Right.


That happens as time goes on. Guess what? 20 years from now somebody's going to get credit that LeBron James didn't get. It happens. Don't be resentful of it. Embrace it. Right. I get it. But I'm just trying to figure out how 17% of the flagrant five ocho, if unnecessary roughness happened to one player of 70 17% of the time. That's not an anomaly. That's not an outlier. Yeah, that's not, that ain't, that ain't no coincidence, huh? No. Too many things that a coincidence is not a coincidence.


Right. Ocho, if you get five speeding tickets of the year, they ain't picking on you. You just drive fast. That's what that is. That's what that is. That's what that is.

He didn't eat anything. Did he? Did John eat anything? Just had water. He got some water Sat down, got made up. He had a hard out time. So that lets me know that, okay.


When they tell me you got a hard out time, I gotta make sure I'm tight. Try to ask the questions that I think the viewing and listening audience want to hear John Cena. And so, but he was great. He, he was really great, really engaged, complimented say, man, you really do a great job. I I I've watched your show.

That means a lot for, for CJ and his team and myself, the kind of work that we go in and prep to make sure, we try to make the guests feel as comfortably as we possibly can. We try to have hair and makeup if they need it. A lot of times they bring their own hair and makeup people. We try to have food there for 'em to eat water.

You want orange juice, you want apple juice, pineapple juice, grapefruit juice. You want sparkling, you want steel, you want what type of products you want. Is there anything that, you know, we try to have that there for Mocho. But he was, he was great. And all the guests, all the guests for me, I haven't had a bad guest.

I let them do what they need to do. Hey, they be ready to go. But John, John was unbelievable. He was, he was, he was unbelievable guest.

As a matter of fact, that was my last, that was 89. They ended up winning national championship that year. They, they started, you know, Ocho they wasn't gonna let us come down there and beat him. But I hit him up. Ocho Yeah, I hit him up. I, this is how you know somebody hit you up. Their head coach used to be the Georgia Bulldogs defensive coordinator er Russell. Right. And the year they won the national championship, he was the defensive coordinator. When they, they won. He was the head coach at Georgia Southern. I did such a phenomenal job at the end of the game, walked to the middle of the field, he gave me a victory.

I I, yeah, he was so great. I'm not sure why he was just at the time, I think he wasn't the only one doing it. He just might have been the one that gotten caught.

Cam played. How long, how long did Cam play? I'm not, IM not sure. Think Cam played a decade. That ain't no, that ain't no short career.

I think Jerry was the only one that had that many catches in a, in a seven year span also, Jerry was the one that had, oh, cam played eight years. Hell yeah. Cam style physical, it was, was really not conducive for playing the long term. I mean that, that, that collision. Yeah. Long. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

He went to four Pro Bowls. No, all pros. I be, I think three Pro Bowls gets you on the ballot. I think Ocho don't quote me on this Ocho, but I think Right, right. I know Nabe had some years where he was, he was unbelievable with the Raiders, but then he went to Philly. Yeah. And then everything that he did to the Raiders, he damned near erased when he was in Philly because he got cooked. He got cooked. Air Knight 26, air Knight 26 at OCHO.
