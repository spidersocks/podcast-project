I don't know who came up with the name Beanie, but this is what we call a Scully, but okay, Ash, actually a little, a little late.


We also have Coozies and we have bugs. Ocho was not home to receive his Scully, so I have mine. I mean, I could, I could send you this one. You get it tomorrow. Oh my bad. So, so quantities are limited. So please make sure you get yours.

It's February the sixth in New Orleans. Be there. You don't wanna miss this one.


The Rams got four field goals and a drain and a downpour, but that was enough to beat the 49 ERs, 12 to six and a very, very sloppy game. A very boring game. Matthew Stafford was 16 of twenty seven, a hundred and sixty yards. I think he had like 23 yards at the half. Kyron Williams continues his great play. 29 carries 106. And it was him that ran, basically ran out the clock late in the ball game. That led to a field goal with limited time on the clock. That really put this game away. Pka Nku continues his outstanding play after coming back from injury. He had seven catches for 90, for 97 yards. He had a longer of 51. He only had eight targets. But I think the story of the night was Cooper Kub who had three targets and no catches.


I can't remember the last time Cooper Kpp played a game Ocho and did not have a catch. Brock Purdy was 14 to thirty one, a hundred forty two yards in a very, very, very bad interception. The 49 ERs could not muster anything as far as running the football. They did a very poor job of protecting Brock Purdy. Brock Purdy was spreading the ball all over the field, but he did have an opportunity to get a touchdown and Deebo dropped it. He had split the scenes and he had his mind on probably scoring a touchdown and he just flat out dropped it. Don't you? There's no other way around it. And that's why you don't complain about when you don't catch it. Because I, I've seen the chance and I'll go line and I see what everybody's saying now. You see how yourself, you make yourself look foolish when you start complaining and then you drop a touchdown.


But watching this game, Ocho, I think for all intents and purposes, this probably ends the 49 er season there with three games to go. I don't see them doing enough. I don't think Seattle, the Rams or the Cardinals do enough damage to themselves in order to have the 49 ERs and the 49 ERs would have to win out. And I don't see that happening. So I think for all intents and purposes, they don't even have a milk chance, which is 2% to get into the playoffs. But when you look at this game, what did you like about what you saw from the Rams? I Mean, listen, what I saw for the Rams obviously being resilient, being able to get, being able to move the ball just a little bit.


The the first half, the first half was abysmal. It was both boring. Hugh said, obviously, I think if it was the weather was a little bit better, we would've saw the Rams look like we're used to seeing them. Look, now that they have Cooper Cup and Pook Na cool, healthy, it would've been a much, much better game. Obviously I don't like the fact that Cooper Cup wasn't able to get a, get a catch at tonight. It it's, it's hard and it is hard to fathom that. Obviously put Naco has, and now Cooper Cup seems to have passed the torch on, on the P Cup. I mean they, they still, they still won the game. The, like you gotta be careful about Deebo.


When you, when you complain about Deebo getting that ball, the game is different. Yeah, the game is completely different. The 49 ERs game, he had two drops. Hell, he tackled his own teammate. He had two carry, I mean, for what, what a Russian total of three yards, 1.5 yards of carry. He had 16 yards receiving and a false star penalty. So de devo this, this is a lesson for him. You gotta be careful, man. You gotta be careful what you wish for. 'cause the football guards will always put you in a position to make a play. To make a play. And this is the difference in being good and being great. You know, if you complain about the ball and the, the opportunities when they come, even if they, even if they come few.


And so often you gotta make those plays. You got make those plays. And other than that, listen O Joe Thanksgiving, they go on a run, huh? Wanna run ocho start your, Yeah, Log off and see if we can get a better connection because right now you're cutting out like every other word and people really can't hear what you wanna say. So if you could just restart your computer and see if we can get a better connection. Okay. Yeah. And see, I mean, maybe you can call down and see if they have a premium wifi that you can get onto, because I'm sure they have a conference center down there somewhere that they, that, that, that businesses come and they use.


So let's see what we can get done. Sorry about that guys. Look, things happen. We don't always be in a situation where we're at home and we have great internet service and everything is wired accordingly. We have the greatest, the, the hot fiber optics and high speed internet out of the yin yang. But sometimes you're at the mercy of situations and I've been there before where we're not, we don't always have the ideal situations, but hopefully we can get this thing, we can get it rectified because we really want to make sure we give you guys the best show we possibly can. And I think that's the only way, only possible if we can get OCHO on a better internet provider, a better service that he can, that he's not on the lag that he is on and he's not cutting out every other word.


So just bear with us. We're sorry, sorry about that guys, but we appreciate your patience. But as Ocho was saying, and the thing is with Deebo, he has to understand, it's, it's funny how the, the, the football guards will humble you. Now he's complaining and he put up a tweet and then he took the tweet down and now here it is for all the world to see. This is your opportunity. Now look what you did. I mean, if it wasn't raining, we have saw you wet the bed, but your cold's wet. So we don't really know. But you did, you did all that talking. Oh, I want the ball. Ain't nothing wrong with Debo, bro. You're not the same. I mean, even they showed the Cutups, bro, you had no separation even on the balls that he didn't get.


Guys, did y'all see any separation? How was, how was Purdy gonna drop the balls in there? There was no separation. It's just, so I, I just, I I just don't get these guys, these guys start reading the comments and, oh, Deebo, you should do this and you should go somewhere else. And you start getting high on your own supply and you start feeling yourself. And then when you get an opportunity, the 49 ERs put you in a situation where you can make plays. You come up small. Now I want you to go on there and say, Hey, just like you had a, had the nerve to go out there and tweet and say, ain't nothing wrong with Deebo. I want you to say, Hey guys, I let let the team down tonight. I had an opportunity to make a play and I didn't had a false start. So, hey, that's what you have to do.


But it's tough. It, it, it, it is really tough playing in these conditions. But hell, the Rams playing in this condition. Pka Naco had eight targets. He had seven catches. So you expect Kettle had four, had four recessions, 61 yards. He had a long of 33 on seven targets. Jwan Jennings had nine targets, two catches. I don't know what party he was throwing on that last interception. And I was looking at it and I was like, Kyle is just running this football. 'cause he really doesn't wanna put this ball in harm's way. He wanna put it on the foot of his kicker to maybe tie this ball game up. And, and the worst case scenario, for a best case scenario, get a field goal and maybe get a quick three and out and get the ball with a chance to win the game.


But Purdy threw this ball. I don't know where he was throwing it because Jennings had no separation. The guy, the corner was over the top of it. But that's, that's neither the here nor there. But give the Rams, they're playing, they're going in the right direction at the right time. The 49 ERs is too many injuries, too many inconsistent, too much, too much inconsistent play. Big guys being outta the lineup, T Dub was outta the lineup. Again, we can understand why Bosa missed some time because he was Nick. They just got Greenlaw back. I think it's ne how you huff nager. He just got back after a long season.


But it was just a season where expectations weren't met. This is the 49 ERs, the team that was in the Super Bowl last year, they bring a lot of the key pieces back, but it didn't work out for 'em this year. And so that's why I keep telling teams all the time, just because you went somewhere last year, that doesn't mean you're gonna go that same place this year. You have to start all back over again and it's not easy. So I think you have a, a healthy level of respect for what you saw the Patriots do year in and year out. What you see Kansas City do year in and year out here, they are trying to go for A-A-A-A-A three P as far as Super Bowls. They've been in the a FC championship game every year since Patrick Mahomes has been the starter.


They've gone to four Super Bowls and a six year span. Yeah, six, seven years. Seven years, excuse me. So it's gonna be, it's gonna be very, very interesting. But guys, we really appreciate you guys bearing with us. We know it's never easy. It's frustrating, y'all know, it's frustrating for me. But you know, every night that I go to bed and pray for patience, he hadn't given it to me, but he showed put me in some situations that required. So, so that's how, that's how, that's how that's man, y'all know this thing called a Scully a beanie.


My definition of a beanie, it doesn't have a lip. It's just a, a, a thin hat that you pull down and that's it. This is a Scully. Definitely a Scully. Yeah, it's a Scully. I don't even know why I let Ash name it. Anyway, that's on me. I the one that F up, Huh? Nah, nah, nah, nah. But I don't know, maybe, maybe the definition of changed over the years. I know when I was a kid it was called a Scully, what we had to wear when we was waiting outside for the bus to come pick us up or we went somewhere and it was cold.


You know, my grandma said, boy, get that Scully. But I guess somehow over, over the years it's been, it's been changed. I mean, I don't know where Beanie came from. Beanie Weenies, I don't know. LY 61. Y'all young, y'all don't know no better. I do. I I think it's, I think it's what you call 'em. I think it's it's age approach. I think age according to where you are. I think someone around my age, probably 40 and above, they probably look at it and say it's a Scully under that 39 and under. They probably look at it and say SA beanie.


We, I'd never heard of the term beanie when I was growing up. So, but I, I think y'all have to admit it's cool though. You know, you boy rock it. I can't remember last time I had one on my damn head. I probably hadn't had one of these on my head since I played Played. Yeah, right, exactly. See, I thought that's what I, I enjoyed like, you know, a beanie. It doesn't have this space right here. It just fits snug down on your head. It covers the entire head. But hey, it is what it is. Hopefully you guys like him and that's where we are with that.

Jalen Hurst and AJ Brown addressed the speculation surrounding their relationship. Both said it isn't fractured despite teammate Brandon Graham suggesting otherwise. AJ BG was just being bg. He's emotional in that case. He just misspoke me and Jalen are fine. Her said BG spoke out of place and he knows that yes, Everything is not for public consumption. Let's just say for the sake of argument is true. How did BG help the situation? 'cause at the end of the day, whatever's going on in the locker room, your job is to try to diffuse it and to try to help it. This did not diffuse it. This did not help it.


And I expected them to say what they said and I don't have any reason to doubt 'em. But let's just say for the sake of argument, and that's what we do here. We try to play both. See both sides of the argument. How, what BG said. How did that help this situation? I don't see that it did. I don't see the good that came from it. Everything that he said, be it true or not, could have been said behind closed doors in a private meeting room with both of those guys, whatever the situation was, between Hertz and and and, and, and, and, and, and Brown aj, AJ could have said what he said. His frustrations. Obviously when you, when you're the number one receiver and you don't get the targets and you don't get the catches in the yard that you're probably thinking you should or you're accustomed to, you become frustrated.


The problem, the only thing I would say to AJ is that you have to be careful because you're winning. You won nine straight games, nine or 10 straight ball games. And then when you complain it, see, it comes off as you're being selfish. Now, I don't believe AJ is selfish. I believe he's a guy that's highly competitive and wants to win and, and understands that if order in order for us to get to where we need to be and where we want to go, the passing game is gonna have to greatly improve. I believe it. I don't believe you're gonna be, I don't believe that you're gonna beat Detroit. I don't believe you'll beat Minnesota. I don't believe you'll beat Green Bay. I don't even know if you'll beat Tampa when you only, your quarterback only throws the ball.


Now if you run the air outta the ball for 2 50, 300 yards, yes that can overcome the lack of passing, but the likelihood of teams are gonna just gonna let Saquon run. Wow. I just don't see that happen. And so when you got two quality receivers, Garnet I think just got Nick last week and so I don't know if and when he's coming back, but your two big guns gonna have to go off at some point in time and they're gonna have to be consistent with that. But I, I like what AJ and, and, and, and Jalen, I like the United front Look, BG was out of, out, out, out of tar. He spoke out of pocket. He shouldn't have said what he said.


What? And like he said, whatever issue that BG had, just like he said, hurts. And, and, and AJ could have got into a room, you could have did the same thing. So hopefully if if they, they got it, they got it worked out, everything is, is, is, is gonna be good moving forward. And so I think that's the thing. And it is tough. You guys are very, very competitive and highly emotional men in that locker room. And they realize they don't want what happened last year to happen this year. Got off to the great start, lose a bunch of games at the end and then there were one and done. And when you got guys that care a lot, this is what you get.


Now, I'm not surprised that it's like this because you got a lot of guys that put a lot into it. You have to make a lot of sacrifices in order to be a great football team. And guys have to sacrifice. Sometimes you have to sacrifice numbers in order to be the team that you wanna be. Everybody look, it would be great if everybody could get their numbers and we still be successful, but sports doesn't work like that. They really don't. But I'm glad to see, and hopefully we come out here and we'll find out over the next couple of games. They got Pittsburgh this week at home. They got the Cowboys, they got a few games, some tough games down the stretch. And what you're gonna need in order to win these games, you're gonna have to have a united front. You're gonna have to have one, the team that's on one accord.


And if you get that, you have an opportunity to do something special. But it's gonna be very interesting to see how this thing plays out. Pittsburgh is a very good test for them because we know what Pittsburgh represent. They have an outstanding defense. They do a great job of limiting the run. They wanna make you one dimensional as do most teams. And if they can make you one dimensional, now they can come hunt your quarterback. It's gonna be very interesting to see if that defensive line could continue to hunt like they've been hunting. We see Jalen Carter, we see Williams, we see Davis Sweat has been doing a great job of getting out the quarterback. Kobe Dean is having an up outstanding season. LeBron is playing really well, that secondary is getting better and better.


You see big play slay starting to make his plays on one side. Michael on the other side are those two safeties, Blankenship. So it's gonna be very, very, it. This gonna be very interesting to see how this thing plays out this week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but I really, really hope that this thing is beha behind the Eagles and they come out there and play with a sense of urgency and they go ahead and take care of what they need to take care of. You got it. Back up. You up up and functional. Can you Hear me? Yes. Hey man. Man, fuck man. Fuck this shit man. Hey.


No, I'm real. Can you see me? Yeah, I can see you with that with that big yellow bird ass. A a t-shirt. Oh, Okay. Okay. We good? We good? We good? We good? We good. Hey, hey, you gotta help, you gotta help me out something real quick. When I, when I'm on the road like this and I get, and I get the hotels where the internet provider is not good, how do I counter that? What can I carry with me to counter them having bad wifi at a hotel? So you just asking to have a premium service because a lot of times they have conference rooms right? And then you might have to let ask them to let you use the conference room because you need, because of what you're trying to get done. Right. Ask them, do they have a high, if they have an upgraded internet service Okay. That you, that's not typical for regular rooms.


A lot of people don't wanna put an extra 20, $30 for internet service. Okay. So I just But that's what you're gonna have. Yes. Right? I just called down, I'm at the grand, I don't wanna be disrespectful to, to the hotel, but I'm the hotel I'm at. I called down, asked the lady, do you have a premium service that I, I can, you know, I can get. She said, no, we don't have that and we'll send an engineer up there. She called back two seconds later, oh, no engineer is here. We can go to our business room downstairs on the fifth floor. I'm like, ma'am, our show has already started. I don't have time to to pack all my stuff and go downstairs. But here from now on. Hey listen, it's not, it's not my fault, but I got my, I got my phone. They my Yeah, but just Ask if they have a premium upgrade internet service that you can use. If not, ask them Can you go use the conference Center?


Okay. So I'm, I'm gonna just, you know what, I'm gonna just use the conference center from now when I'm on the road. I ain't got time for this shit. Yeah, but I'm, I'm ready. I'm ready. What, where was that, where was that? We was discussing the Jalen Hurst and AJ Brown. Let me go back. Oh, surrounding the relationship. Right. Both said the relationship isn't fractured despite what teammate Brandon Grahams is suggesting otherwise, AJ bg, which is Brandon Graham Yeah. Was just being bg. He's emotional. And in that case, he just misspoke. Me and Jalen are fine hurt said BG spoke out of place and he knows that. Yeah, most Definitely. Most definitely. Anytime they have somebody on the outside speaking on a situation that they know nothing about, even though you are teammates, you for one, as a receiver on as a tight end, you understand AJ B Brown's frustrations, watching the film.


Absolutely. Watching the film and watching some of the plays in which his frustrations stem from. You understand where you're coming from, but there's a way to do things. There's, there's a way to do things. Everything should have been kept in house and stayed in internally. And the conversation should have been, should have been had between AJ Brown and god damn Jalen Hurts. Boom. All they had to do. Hey listen, after practice come in here. Let, let's break down some of this films, some of the plays where you could just hit me, you know, based on anticipation. If a guy is off, you gimme a shot on the right side of the field. When he had that shot, when it was one-on-one and the safety at the snap of the ball, the safety went to the middle of the field. You gotta gimme those shots and those d balls you have to trust in me. There's a reason why they paid me what I did.


There's a reason why I'm the number one receiver. You got to trust me in these situations. I got you nine times outta 10. AJ Brown make those plays on the throws where he was hesitant and didn't let it go. It seemed like when Jalen, when Jalen Hurts plays quarterback off, he waits for the player to be open before he lets the ball go instead of it's too late. His anticip his anticipatory skills aren't where they should be. They, they just aren't, you got the, you got the Church of Receivers, man, you, you gotta trust him. Got And he, he hadn't been doing that. And I understand AJ Brown's frustration, but the way he went about doing it, it wasn't the right way. I agree. I agree with everything you just said. And just like BG said that AJ should have pulled Jalen to the side Right.


And, and had a private conversation. Yes sir. He should have done likewise with Jaylen Hurs and, and aj. Yes sir. Yes sir. You ask somebody to do something and you can't ask more than you are willing to give. Right. Right. You can't ask them to do, have a private conversation while you go have a public conversation about the private conversation they told to Have. Yeah. And see this, this is the funny thing. This is where it all, this is where it stems from being very media savvy, being media savvy and understanding the space that you're in and understanding the power that your voice has based on the situation. 'cause all you did was just made it worse. All you Exactly. You just made it worse. So if they did ask you the question or a podcast or whether, whether it be the media or whatnot, you, you, you spin it, you spin it, you say something positive to deflect the situation that's going on.


You don't add goddamn fuel to the goddamn fire. You are absolutely right. But I think the thing is, is that Ocho at this point in time, you know the situation. You look, you're in Philly. Yeah. You've been in Philly, if I'm not mistaken, you're the longest tenured eagle. Right. So you know the least thing that is said Oh yeah. About the eagle that coming from that locker room is gonna be magnified always. Now I don't need you to give it a megaphone and amplify even More. Even more. Yeah. Understand that if that's, that's media 1 0 1. Every, every turtles. I I understood. Right. Everything is not meant for public consumption.


No, sir. And even e even though the media dis oh, they want honesty. Okay, I'm gonna give you my honesty. Right. But I'm not gonna give you the honesty that's going to, that's gonna tear the fabric of the locker room. Right. Because then what, what's your role in helping put it back together? You trying to sell a story, you trying to get people to read your article Right. Click on it, like it, whatever the case may be. I'm trying to keep the team together in order for us to get to where we need to be. Right. And me telling, telling secrets or dirt what's in the locker room doesn't help that. Nah. At all. At all. I think they gonna be all right though. Matter of fact, this week, this week I listen as well as Quan has been playing all season long.


They not finna run the ball the way they think. They've been running the ball all season long against that Steelers defense. Right. The Steelers defense against the goddamn run. They top five in the NFL. So this is the week where AJ Brown and Devonte Smith are gonna have to show up. And Jalen Hearst ain't gonna have no choice but to get that ball outta his hand. He ain't gonna have no choice. And they, they gonna have all the chances they need. I think it was two years ago, two years ago, 2022. I think AJ Brown's best game against his dealer. He had, maybe he had three touchdowns. I I forgot how many catch for like 165 or a hundred, 156 yards. Something like that. So they gonna have to get back to that. Go back and watch that film. See what you did in did in that specific game against the Steelers.


And you gotta repeat it. You gotta repeat it this Sunday. Yeah. I I, look, I understand the Steelers are great against the run. Yeah. But don't think y'all gonna scare me out of running this football. Right. Right. We do got Sequan and he, and he's running the air outta the football. So whatever y'all think y'all gonna do. Oh, they, we number four against the rush. I don't give a damn your number 1000 against the Russian. Right. Plus 1000. We're gonna attempt to run the football. Yeah. Because we're not gonna let you make us one dimensional early. Now it might get to a point where we have to throw the football. Right. But I tell you what, we gonna still sprinkle some runs in there. Yeah. Because we not gonna just let TJ Watt and he bring in High Smith just pin their damn ears back and come get the quarterback. That's not going to happen. Right. Even though you have my lotto on one side.


You got Lane Johnson. You got Dick Dickerson. I get it. I get it. You got beton at the, I get all of that. But if you just pin the, if you just allowed the Steelers that front seven led by tj. Yeah. And even Cam Hayward can come get your quarterback. Now he's really good against the run. But if you just let these guys just like, okay. Oh, they're not gonna even chip the run the ball. Yeah. Or they gonna get your quarterback game. See, this, this, this is the frustrating part. This is the frustrating part. They are so good against the run. They can't allow, how, how do I say it? They can't allow the goddamn Steelers to dictate what they wanna do offensively because it's gonna be a lot of two yard games, a tackle for loss. It's gonna be a three yard game at some point it's going to break.


But the Steelers are so disciplined and they not doing nothing special based on who they playing. They gonna line up. They're not gonna do nothing exotic and they just going to play because they have the personnel to get it done. And that's how they play. They, that's how they play the all season. If you're going to have success against Steelers, you're gonna have to put the ball in the air. You gonna have to. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's just hard to have success do being one dimensional Yeah. In an NFA game dish at, at this, there used to be a time that you could just run the football ocho Oh yeah. Or you could just throw the football. Right. But those games are just, those days are just few and far between you. And I'm not saying you need to have 200 yards rushing and 300 yards passing. Right. I'm not saying you need to have 150 yard rushing, but you do need to give the defense something other to think about other than hunting your quarterback.


Right. Right, right, Right. The lions revoke season tickets of a fan who had a pre-game verbal altercation with Matt LeFlore at Ford Fields last week, A TV camera caught the end of the heated exchange between LaFleur and Fahad. Ya, Yusef Yusef Lale could be yelling at the fan, but said his actions were provoked. I've never been a part of something like that. LaFleur said he was talking junk to our players, giving them the throat slash sign. You're trying to deescalate it and then gets in my face. And I thought it was pretty unsupport blanket. Yusef said he was devastated by the move after being contacted by e via email. The biggest punch in the gut, man. Just waking up and seeing that email and not being able to talk to somebody in person.


It was a terrible feeling. I don't have a, I don't, I don't have a chance to give my side of the story or anything. You, you, you can't do that, man. You can't do that. You, you got, you can't, you, you just can't do that. You can't listen, man, the NF L's not gonna go forward. The team's not gonna go forward. You because you're a representation of them. So if you're, if you, if you as a fan of, say a team is chatting and talking trash to the opposing team's head coach, what do you think is going, what, what do you think is gonna happen? What do you, what what do you think is gonna happen? You have to remain a fan. You have to remain in your position as a fan.


I'm surprised, I'm surprised Detroit did this what I Am Well, it's no different. It's no different than playing in the NBA and you got fans, heckling players on the sideline just because you sit in court side. Yeah. You better enjoy the game. There's no need to disrespect the opposing, the polling teams head coach. For What? I you know what, it'd been interesting to see, to hear what was said. Right now I don't Oh, Joe, I don't think the the throat slashing gesture is enough. Like I said, I don't know. He, he, did he say the ma did he say the magic word? Right. Did he say the N word? Oh, did he, did he say, did he say some of the other stuff? Right. Did he call somebody a monkey? Did he, I mean, what, what were some of the words? Ocho? Yeah.


And then like I said, I don't know. Now you're talking to somebody that's been in a similar situation. Everybody knows my story. It's well documented. I got in, I got in, you know, had into a, a, a, a verbal altercation with some of the Grizzlies players. Yeah. Now, if the Lakers said, Shannon, you can't come back, I'm dead ass wrong. Hey, the money that I paid for the tickets. Right. I gotta eat that. Right. Right. I gotta eat that because my, my thing ocho you know how I am, I control Shannon's action. Right. I don't get to control the consequences that came from Shannon's action. Right, right. If the Lakers said, and I, and I, I get what he said, he is like, man, I ain't even get a chance to talk to nobody.


I ain't get a chance to explain my side of the story. It it, I I get, I was wrong. But, you know, a maybe I'm a little bit more sympathetic and understanding. Right. Because sometimes Ocho man, you look, look, I, I ain't gonna lie. Hell, I forgot I was at the game. I ain't lying. It it, I, and You look, and you was hot. You were hot, Bro. It was like, I'm like, I'm thinking I'm on the corner. I'm at the barbershop and I'm going, I'm going back and forth. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you like this guy? I like this guy. He's like, you know, we having a conversation about Kobe and LeBron or Kobe Jordan, the Jordan, LeBron, LeBron, Kobe. Right. That's how it was. I, I don't, I honestly, I don't remember anything until the security got me back and into the hallway and they asked, Hey, oh, you okay?


And I'm, and I'm, and I, as I'm, I'm like, why y'all keep asking me am I okay? Right. Right. What happened? They like, oh, oh, you okay. Right. And I'm looking at, I'm looking at my man. He look, he looking at me like, at me. I'm like, yeah, I'm okay. And then it, then it really dawned on me. But at that point in time, I was like, oh, hell Lord have mercy. I said, I done lost my, I said, I know my sister gonna see this. My brother gonna see this, the kids gonna see this. Yeah. I say, I know Fox's gonna see this. Hell, everybody gonna see this. Yeah. But hey, I mean you, there was, there was no, there was no consequences behind that. Right. Nah. Okay, okay. Okay.


Me, my there was a consequence about my, my my image. Oh. I mean, Other than that, no, I didn't, I didn't suffer any monetary damage. Right. But like I said, if the Lakers, if the, if the Lakers had told me that I was not allowed to come back anymore, yeah. I'd have just had to suck it up and say I they, they wouldn't, they wouldn't, they wouldn't do that to you. They wouldn't do do that to you. I mean, listen, it's, it is, that happens. Emotions rides obviously. When, when it comes to players, when it comes to fans, obviously with you being a public figure and your passion for the game of basketball and the Lakers as well. They, they wouldn't, they wouldn't do that. Now, the situation with the fan and talking to a head coach like that is completely different. Completely different. Yeah. And the thing, and the thing was Ocho like the officials, because Zach Right?


No, I, I forget the official name. And I had seen, I had, I, I had seen him at a game before, but like I said, I mean, I, I was just, you know, it was just good old trash talking. That's it. Hey, you know, this and that. Yeah. And then it just escalated to you know, it and sit. I was like, whoa, hold on now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, hey, don't y'all let, don't let the big sweater fool you now. Yeah. Yeah. Put them hands on the mark. Nah, nah, nah. I ain't wanna put them. I I ain't want to get outta hand like that. Right, Right, right, right. Hey, hey, listen, Me, hey, look, I'm, and I'm older. The, the problem that I'm most disappointed in ocho my job as the adult in that situation, right.


With the Lord, the temperature in the room. Right. Hey, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now, hold on. Now, Sometimes, sometimes as an adult, you gotta raise the temperature because if somebody slap you in the Bible, they say, turn the other cheek, are you gonna turn the other cheek? Nah, no. No. Ain't nobody slapping nobody. But see, there, there we go. There, there, there we go. But all the words, but in a situation like that, yeah. The words right. I could've just like, you know what, bro, Hey, just sit down, enjoy the game. Yeah. Blah, blah, blah. But the thing was, when people tried to spin it talking about, oh man, he about to fight, he about to crash out by LeBron. LeBron ain't had nothing to do with this. Right. LeBron didn't had anything to do with this.


Me, me and Brooks were having a very healthy conversation. We going back and forth. We was going back and forth. He said what? He said, I'm saying what he said, I like that. I like that. And then they got a little, I like that it went to a, i, I thought it went to a spot that it didn't need to go. And then John came in, I'm like, oh, bro. Yeah. He said he got nothing to do with you. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, that, that, that's his teammate. Huh? That's his teammate, yeah. And then his, and then his dad and I, boy, Lord. Now see, that's what really got me of all the things Ocho, I was focused on them. And if you notice immediately Ocho, I hear somebody say he won't do nothing, but I will man. Please man.

Will I ever wear the blue sweater again? No, I retired. I I it wouldn't do it justice. That's, that's what, as a matter of fact, Greg Lian, I don't know how you say it. Greg Lauren. Ralph Lauren. But Greg Lian. But he a, I mean, he said he got, he was in London at the time and he said he got so many emails, he got so many calls about your sweater and like, what about the sweater? That's sweater. That's an old sweater. We don't make that sweater anymore. Yeah, they did. They put it back in production and made some more. Yeah. See, see, see, see the, see the kind of impact you have the price, see the kind of impact you have. You got impact fashion.


I didn't want that kind of impact. Nah, sometimes. Huh? Huh? Nobody? No. Listen, everybody remembers the villain. Nobody remembers a good person. The villain lives on forever. So sometimes you have to embrace the consequences that comes in certain situations. It's okay. Next time I'm a I'm gonna be with you court side next time. No. Yeah. You I, I, nah, nah, I just sit down. I just sit down. Hey, I acknowledge blah, blah, blah. But for the most part, the the opposing team, they all, I mean all of 'em, they come get, they come. Oh yeah. They gonna Show Zach Levi and all those guys. The, the Deebo Dero. Yeah. When I come to the game, they, man, how you doing So forth.


The song. Yeah. Everybody like it inside to see me. It was just, I don't know. Look, the grizzlies don't really care for the Lakers. The Lakers don't care for the Grizzlies. Right. The Grizzlies fans don't care for the Lakers. Laker fans doesn't care for the Grizzlies. Laker fans Damn sure don't like the grizzly. So I get that. I didn't get it at the time. I get it now. Right. I totally understand. I got, I got a question. Is the Grizzlies hatred for the Lakers and the Lakers hatred for the Grizzlies, is it almost equivalent to that of the Saints and the Falcons are nowhere close? Yeah. Well, it, it, it just recently started. Yeah. It just re you realize the Falcons and the Saints been in the same division for a long, long time.


It used to be the NFC West. Right. So the Falcons, the Saints, the Rams, all of them in the same, the 49 ERs were all in the same division. Right. So, and plus the close proximity Right. Of New Orleans to Atlanta. Right. So you got a lot of fans driving down to New Orleans. You got a lot of fans driving up from New Orleans to Atlanta. Right. So the hatred is, I'm talking you talking about Baltimore, Pittsburgh, yeah. Saints, Falcons. Yeah. Right there. You talk about, you talking about Green Bay, Chicago? Yeah. Oh, that's bad. It just, that's bad. That's bad. Listen, I didn't listen, I didn't even understand the, the situation when it came to the Saints and Falcons until hell, till I was damn retired.


And they going, they, they going back and forth on Twitter. I'm like, listen, we can, we can have a kumbaya, a kumbaya moment. Imagine how dope it would be if Saints and Falcons fans got together, sat together the games and enjoyed together. That ain't gonna happen. Well, you ain't gotta tell me. Oh, you ain't gotta tell me. I I know now. I know. Now they Play, I I'm in Atlanta, I'm in the barbershop. Yeah. And it's a if Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, I understand that. It's, it's good nature. But like I said, I, I was able to go back and I had a conversation and I'm cool. I mean, I a as a matter of fact, I've gone back to several games and saw the, the Grizzlies play. Mm. I think Jaw's phenomenal.


Yeah. I mean, to watch him play and to see how he can elevate and contour his body and to do things that he does Yeah. Is just listen is second to none. There, There are very few basketball players. Listen, people, people buy tickets to go watch the game. Yeah. John's one of the few players in the NBA where you buy tickets and he puts, he puts fans in the seats and they strictly coming just to watch him. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. It's, it, it was, it was great. Now it's time for, okay. While Deandre Campbell told the team, he's a linebacker Ocho. Yeah. Now he was placed, remember Dre Greenlaw was the starting linebacker beside a, He hurt, he got hurt In the Super Bowl.


Yeah. He just got activated. Yeah. So I guess what that meant is that Deandre Campbell, either he didn't start or his playing time was cut. Well, obviously this is what was said. Devon, Dre Campbell told the 40, told the team he didn't want to play anymore and he left the game in the third quarter of tonight's game Per Kyle Shanahan, DiUS Ward spoke about Campbell leaving a team, middle of the game. He's probably gonna get cut. Yeah. Yeah. Do, do you, can I ask you something? Can I tell you something? Yes. Do you understand his frustration though? Do you understand? What do you under No, I didn't. I don't, I don't agree with it. I don't agree with it. Listen, you as, as, as a teammate, as a player on the team, you gotta understand your role.


You gotta understand why you are in the role, in the position you're in. Yes. 'cause he got hurt. Because he got hurt. But then I'm thinking about it also being able to empathize with him. Well, damn, I've been putting in all this work all this time. I've been playing all this time, and all of a sudden he comes back and I gotta take a back seat. Well, obviously yeah. What you want start from the get go. So, hello. You got, you gotta remember that. But I think I, I'm, I'm seeing him from his perspective. Well, damn, I've been putting all this work, meetings, practice, playing, doing everything I can, and all of a sudden he comes back from injury and now I'm on the what? Yeah. You got your, you got, you got to understand your role. Young bull. You gotta standing your role. Come on, man, Bro. And, and that's brought, first of all, had he not got hurt, you wouldn't even been there.


It, you gotta realize you got released from the Packers. Yeah. Ugh. So they threw you, they threw you a lifeline. He was coming back. Yeah. Okay. Hey, I'm gonna, Hey, I'm gonna play, play my role. Right. Whatever they need. Hey, I only signed a one year deal anyway. Right. Hey, my season about to be over in the next four or five weeks. Right. Oh, hey Wait. Whoa, whoa. He on the year deal. Yeah. And he had the nerve to walk off, walk off the field. Yeah. Hey, UNC, you got, listen, you know, hold on for one. You got be that boy to pull some shit like that off. You ain't, I'm saying now, now you, you, you know what I mean? You got be, you gotta be spread warn off or somebody like that. Well, yes. Okay. We know you upset, you know, come on back.


We'll work things out. Well if you on a one year deal and you, you acting like that, But No, but no great player would ever do something like that. Exactly. You got too much pride To understand. Also, no great player would be in that position where they would have to do something like that. Correct. But you have to understand, You, you, I think there's a situation, Davis, Davis, the db, remember the DB had quit at halftime in Buffalo. Oh, oh, Oh, vta. Yeah. Vta. Yeah. I heard the story. VTA had the half like, man, I can't do this no more, man, I can't do this no more Cante, rest in peace, man. Yes, yes. But yeah, I, I've ne man, these guys do. I I I've never been a part of something like this in my 14 year career.


Yes, sir. I've, I can honestly say I've never seen someone that refused to go into the game. Yeah. It, it happened. Somebody else just did that not too long ago. Deontay Johnson, he refused to go to the game Yes. In the third quarter. Yes. And got suspended. Yeah. And now we have, what's his last name? Oh, AB did it You remember AB did it at the Jet Tampa and took Yeah. Yeah. He, he cleared it. He cleared it. But I came close You I did what? Wait, lemme get comfortable. Tell me the story. Let me sit up. What happened? We play a lot of two tight ends. Yes, sir. And I'm always, I'm always, I'm y in 21 personnel.


Right. Two backs, one tight end, two receivers. I'm always y Yeah. Anytime we go to 12 personnel, I'm always a tiger tight end. Right. Right. So no matter who, if how came in and, and, and, and 12 personnel, I'm going to Tiger. Right. If Charco Chamberlain came in, I'm going to, I'm going, I'm going to the, the tiger. I'm going to the, the fly, the fly tide end, which is what we call tiger. Right. So I remember looking inside and I'm standing in the huddle and I see, I see Choco Chamberlain coming into the ballgame. Yes, sir. So I go, I'm, I'm stand in my spot. I'm stand in my spot. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm moving over.


I'm going to the target position right in the huddle. He's like, nah. He's like, he like 84, you the, you the Y I'm like, huh. Who told him to do that? They, they did. They sent the, they sent the play that they sent the play in. So they call two Jet Yook y stick. Right. Lookie, which is the tight end has a two-way go. Right. You know, and you can break it out. Break it in the y the Yeah. The, yeah. The tiger. He can come across the, the guy's face. Right. Or he can break it out. Right. In other words, the y which is what I'm playing now.


Right. He window dressing. I was hot. Hold On this, on the, I played, is this on the Yeah. I, I bet this, I bet this is on the back end of your carto. It Is, It is. See you see how they play you, You see No. Yeah. This is my, this is my, this is my, what year is this? This was my, this was 1999. 1999. I'll never, I'll never forget it, don't you? And they, I played a game. Now I'm seing. Right? I Know you were hot. Well, I know you were hot. I told Cool who was offensive coordin at the time. 'cause he and I got a great relationship.


I said, cool. Do they ever pinch head for Barry Bond? Mm. Do they ever pinch head for King Griffey Jr. Come on, man. I said, if y'all ever send somebody else in to do that bull, it ain't gonna go. Well. Yeah. And listen, you, you, you already know what they're doing. I tell, I tell you all this time, people in the chat listen to this real quick. Think about all the great receivers. Think about all the great receivers, even from my era, right? It's one thing that they always do. They always say, at some point, A player's losing a step or they getting slow. But you, but you never ever see the part where the opportunities decrease to make it like there's something wrong with you or they work you out the offense. They, they always find a way to work you out the offense and put you in positions that they never used to before.


Right. It don't never really be nothing really wrong with you, but they find a way to work you out. And it's always small things like what you just said. Yeah. If you talk to Julio Jones, you Talk to a, the AJ Greens, you talk to the Andre Johnsons, the Randy Moss, even even the Jerry Reitzes, at some point, it always comes to a time if there's nothing wrong with you, they find ways to decrease your opportunities to make it seem as if there's something wrong with you to justify. Well, you know what, man, you just not putting up the numbers. You're used to, you know, we think you need, you might need to take a pay cut. Yeah. And so it's so funny how, it's so funny how works Guy Yeah. Ocho a guy that they thought was losing. I go to Baltimore. Yeah. I lead the team in receiving and help him get to a Super Bowl.


Yeah. Yeah. That's the way it is. It Did. And then come back and I finished second, I finished second behind Rod both year. Yeah. And, and catches and yards. Had eight touchdowns my final year. Over 70, over 700 yards. Yeah. And that, that, that's the dirty, that's the, that's the dirty part of the business that people really don't understand or see. They don't, they never see that part. They just hear the media. Oh, he's lost a step. Oh, there's something wrong with him. Oh, he's not the same player he used to be. Well, hell, of course, if I'm not getting the same opportunities I used to get when I was putting up with the goddamn numbers, of course. But I've, I would've never, I would've never not gone into the game because I had built up too much credibility with my teammates.


Right, right, right, right. And they had, they expect me to be the voice of reason. Even there've been times that I've like got on guys and I know things weren't going their way. I could see it. Hell, everybody can see me. But I say for me, I've always felt I needed to remain, have a level of professionalism. Right now, pro PRO and professional are two different things. Yes, sir. A professional is your job occupation. Right. A pro is how you handle situations. Right. So I wanted to be a professional and a pro because I always wanted to handle things the right way. Right. There's a time and a place, I had the conversation with ko, Hey bro, me, you go way.


I said, cool man, you go way back, bro. Right. You was my quarterback for two years. You helped me. Right. Become the player that I became. You was the buffer that when me and Mike wasn't seeing eye to eye butting head. You was the guy like, Hey boss, we gotta get a ball to 84. Yeah. Come on now. Yeah. Gimme that. Let me, let me, let me have my dignity now. Yeah. Gimme that grace. You gotta gimme that grace. But you understand Absolutely know what you Absolutely. You know what you gotta understand though, Kubiak, even in that situation, you know his hands is tied now. Oh yeah. I do. I Do. You know, that's come, that's coming from a higher, a higher power Now that, that, that's way that works. Me and Mike used me and Mike used to butt heads. Yeah. And, and the thing was is that Mike thought money would motivate me, but when he realized it wasn't money that I was playing for, come on.


Now I, my situation, and this is why I can empathize with Tom, because the thing that I wanted from Mike was what Tom wanted from Bill. Right. Just the level of appreciation. A little Respect. But what I for, for what I've been able to do for you for a very long time, that's It. Money, wasn't it? I money wasn't it Ocho I never got Ocho. I ain't even get no million dollar signing bonus. Right. And I was cool with that 'cause I know what I was capable of doing. Right. And I just, I used to tell him, I said, Mike, you can't find a tight, there's not a tight end that's currently playing that can do what I do. I don't care if he's an all pro. First of all, he not gonna be an all pro as long as I'm in the league. Come on. Now How you gonna do that?


I know you listen, I done grab a pen and paper 'cause I know you about to gimme something. Good. So I'm, I'm just saying I'm, I'm well, how, I'm just trying to figure out how you figure there's gonna be a tight end. First of all, the Pro Bowl and the a FC goes through me. Mm. Come on man. Now they might be some guy, because you already know at the start of the year, from 90, from 93 to 90, from 92 to 99. Yeah. When it came to the Pro Bowl, man, I sure hope I can get that back up spot. Who, what? It wasn't me two going to the a c Yeah. And me and Ben had it on lock. Yeah. Now, if you was nice to me and call me. Right. I would pull out and let you go. Okay. Okay. Okay.


I would le I would pull outta the Pro Bowl. 'cause you know, somebody goes to like, oh, what you pulling outta? But I would do that. Right. Tell me what, because it's gonna look good on your resume. Yes sir. You got a contract coming up. Hey, pro Bowl look Good. Yeah. Yeah. You try to get whatever the case may be. Right. But nah, Ocho check this out. Ocho Yeah. Campbell signed a one year $5 million contract. The 49 ERs gave him 3,350,000 signing bonus with 4.56 of the 5 million. Guarantee You, you, you, you can't do that. You can't do that. You can't allow emotions to get in the way of your job.


But one, it's for one, it's about being, being self-aware and understanding the position that you're in. Understanding how you, understanding how you got in a position that you're in. So how do you think other teams gonna look at that? That's what I'm saying. So he gonna Retire other team. Well, how do you think other Teams, is he about to retire? Is he about to retire? Oh, choke. No, because this is what Kyle Shanahan said after the game. Yeah. This ain't no speculation. Because I was wondering, I was wondering, Kyle rip Campbell after the nine Rs lost, that's somebody who doesn't wanna play the game. Plain and simple. 'cause I was looking because Greenlaw seemed like he got Nick and he asked outta the game. I said, well, damn, where's Campbell?


Mm. But it didn't Oh, so it didn't dawn on Me Yeah. During the game. Right. It didn't, it didn't. Because I'm looking forward because I think Okay, green law's in Okay, Greenlaw comes out. I'm thinking, okay, Campbell's back in. Right. Well, but do you wanna retire? But do you, the one thing in pro sports that you cannot do Yeah. Above all else is quit. Yeah. You cannot be labor to quit on ocho. Yeah. You know that Everybody knows that. Do not quit. Yeah. That's the worst. That's the worst. That's the worst. That is it. Yeah. Once that label and then, then obviously, and not only quitting, but quitting on the team like the 49 ERs.


So if you gonna quit on a team like that, despite their struggles this season, hey unc, they gonna look at you funny in the light. So in other words, you front running. So now they go a little adversity. They struggling as a team. You don't get your way, you not playing and you going to quit. Well, you know what, you went, I Don't, I don't want it. I wish I could talk to him or you know, what you went through to get to this point. Do you know what you went through? Do you know how many people wish they was in your position to have an opportunity to even be playing in the NFL? Come on man. Don't forget how you got here. Don't lose sight of that. Don't lose sight of that. I hope he, I know he don't, he don't see hope. Don't lose sight of that.


I hope he took care of his money. He, I mean, ugh. Hey. But that's tough, right? Oh, Joe, that's, and that's what I tell guys. That's, that's tough. Listen, if if you do the right thing, yeah. You could steal another, you could steal a year or two. Yeah. You could steal a year or two Ocho. Yeah. Yeah. Don't mess. Don't mess that up, bro. 'cause all at the end of the day, all you got is your name Ocho? Yeah. Now, I promise you, this guy's been the pro bowl. He's been the all pro. Now this gonna follow him. Yeah. This going Ocho and Mark Anthony's oration about Julius Caesar. He say the good that the good get buried is the bad that gets left behind.


That's what people remember. Hold on. Bring that to when, When Mark, when, when Mark Anthony was giving his oration about Julius Caar. Yeah. He said, friends, roaming country will limit your ear. He says, I come to pray, come to praise it. Yes sir. Not bury him, but he said, nah. He said the good goes in the ground with you. Yes sir. It's the bad. This gonna follow this man. Yeah, It did. Definitely is. It definitely is. I just don't, I I don't, I don't Grow. That's, you allow you, when that's when you allow emotions. Emotions. You allow emotions and pride and ego to get in the way. Ocho Yes sir. When emotions are high, what is, what is logic? Low, Very low.


Extremely. Extremely. I I think we know what's gonna happen is, is he going to get an opportunity to allow those emotions to come down? Allow that anger to come down and reflect on what am I doing? All the things I've been through to even get to this point. And then here I am throwing it away because I'm upset because I'm angry. And I hope, I hope, you know, I, I don't wish for nobody to lose their job. I hope, I hope he can. He can go and he can talk to shit. He can talk to Shanahan. I'm, I'm not sure if he going to, if he's gonna extend him that grace, not that understanding because you quit. You can't quit. You just can't. Because the first thing they gonna say is, oh, you don't wanna play? Okay. Okay. We gonna give you, we gonna give you walking placements.


Let's see if you get another opportunity. Especially with that, with that tag of being a quitter tagged against you

Ojo in 2021. He was first, first team all pro in 2022. He was number 49 in the top 100. Mm mm I just don't, I it's just like I and, and people get upset at me 'cause I'm talking about Shannon. You answer you bro. I just wanna win. Yeah. That's it. What are we doing this for? Yeah, the money's going to come. You gonna make money? Yeah. But in the process, I don't care how much man losing gifts owe. I've done both and I'd rather win than lose. Yes sir. Give me making money. 'cause you make money Who doesn't make money?


Right? But that losing What you ain't gotta Tell me. You're like, bro, what the hell am I doing this for? Right. I done, I done got up and denied myself and been away from my family. Lift all these heavy weights to all eat all this food, doing all the right things. Cold tub, stretching, mess, massage, Pilates, yoga. Well, what? Yeah. Hey, listen. Think about all that. Think about all that you just said. Right? And I played 11, 11, 12 years. How many winning seasons you think I had in that 12 year span? Well, unfortunately you played for the Bengals. So You listen, you, you ain't had the, oh, hey, there was two. It was two too. It was two. But I never, ever, I never listen and I know it, it is funny, but I never ever allowed the winning situation to fault and effect determine Your play.


Oh No, unc. Oh no Unc we was horrible. But I guarantee you. Well, if you pay $80 for a ticket, you finna get $80 worth of entertainment. Whether we playing home way, I don't care what our record is. I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm showing show I As you should because losing everyone, they don't pay. They don't pay you based on whether you win or lose. Oh no. You get a salary regardless. Yeah. So that man, gimme an honest day salary. I'm gonna give his ass a honest day award And he gonna get it every time. Because not only am I every, every single time, not only am I playing for that organization, not only that, I'm, I'm playing for that name on the back of that jersey.


Hell yeah. I ain't Finn embarrass myself and everybody else I represent outside of that uniform. It ain't happening. Mm. It ain't happening. You, you abs You are absolutely right. And there, there's something to be said that when you play for an organization, but look at your name. Look at, look, you only had two winning seasons, but your royalty in Cincinnati because of the way you conducted yourself, the way you played the game. Yeah. You go back, I can go back to Denver now. I don't get a chance to go back. I can go back to Baltimore. I don't get a chance to go back much. Right. Hell, I'm working. You know that man, you need to come bro. Y'all do realize I gotta work, right? Yeah. Now, if it's a special event, you know, special occasions and stuff, I'll, I'll, I'll definitely try to get back.


Like one of, one of my teammates or something that, that I played with got an opportunity to go into the, the pro football, excuse me, got the hall of Fame ring or something like that. I always try to get back, but it's just hard now because just like my focus was on football at the time that I played. Right. My focus now is on Nightcap. Right. And I gotta make sure that I'm, I'm prepared and to do the thing. And it's just hard. I mean, I, I remember going back and, and trying to watch the game and I really wasn't no fun because I'm up in, in Mr. Bowling's box and I ain't watching the game on the field. Hell, I'm watching all the other games 'cause I gotta talk about them Right. Tomorrow on undisputed. So I've gotta do my due diligence because it's not fair.


Right. It's not fair to skip. It's not fair to f offense. One that I bring my aunts on the show and I'm over there just, just freelancing. Right. Because I haven't watched the game. Nah, I won't, nah that's not what they paid me for. So in that situation, but hopefully Devon Campbell who figured this out. But that's not a good, that's, that's not a good look. Yeah. Devon Dre. Devon Dre Campbell is his name. If being Kyle Shanahan said this is what he told reporters after the game. Dandre Campbell told the team. In other words, he told Kyle he didn't want to play anymore and he left the game in the third quarter of tonight's game. Mm.


Per head coach Kyle Shanahan, tra TIUs Ward said he spoke to dandre Campbell leaving the team in the middle of the game. He probably is gonna get cut. You probably you, you're probably Kyle Rip Campbell after the nighters loss saying that's somebody who doesn't want to play the game is playing and simple damn kiddo was not happy either. If you are on the roster, you suit up, you expect to play. Yeah. I think anyone in this building that has asked to go in the get go win would say a hundred percent of everybody will die getting off their, getting off their field football field.


Excuse me. Things go on in the football field and his decision wasn't for this organization, not even on the team. And that's on him. And I'm not happy about it. I hope I'm never around anyone who does that. Again, the one thing if you listen, if you are professional at that, look Ocho I hadn't had a whole lot of jobs now I've had a whole lot of, I had some jobs that I wanted to quit. Right. Working from the backfield, clipping onions, picking up pecan loading watermelon belly. Right. Hell, I wanted to quit those jobs. Yeah. You don't think I wanted to quit? Yeah. Or Mary party wasn't Finn to have that. No sir. Right. You cannot quit as a professional athlete.


That is the worst thing you of ocho. I'm trying to think, can you think of something worse that you could do as a teammate right. To your team That's counting because I'm counting everybody. I'm counting on everybody. Ocho I put, I put my playing career, I'm putting everything in your hands. I'm asking you to do the same thing. Yes sir. And then I man what? Well man, what Ocho man. Ocho man Ocho say he done shit Me. Wow. Don't even use nah, don't use me as no example. Use somebody else's name. Nah, I'm a a Where he at man. He walking out the field. Now I gotta come down. Ocho is sharp as boy. I on the sideline. I don't know what happened man.


Get your hands back in here. Hey Listen, The first thing that would jog through my mind if I even thought about quitting is the obstacles and the hurdles that I had to go through to even get to this point. I went through hell to even make it to the league. Yes. And you think the fact that I, I finally made it. Think about how, think about that feeling when that name went across that ticker or when you got that phone call from your organization. Think about that feeling you had with the tears flowing in your family. Everybody crying and celebrating and you finally make it and you reach the childhood dream the pinnacle of it. I wanted to always be an NFL player. I finally make it because of a situation.


I'm gonna walk away from it because I can't play because I'm not starting no more. 'cause they want me to come off the bench. Hell no. All the work I done put in everything it took for me to get to this point. You think I'm finna quit man, nigga, please. Oh mother, I mean child please. Oh Ocho, think about how many times from when you started Mm. To where you ended up. Things didn't go your way and you didn't quit. No, Definitely didn't. Because Now you at that point you like Man F this. Mm. Oh well yeah.


Alright, Ocho, now it's time for money moves presented by Draft Kings. The Carolina Pan. Oh yeah. The Carolina Panthers are favorite to win a football game for the first time in exactly two years on Sunday. Their favorite for the first time in 33 games. And their favorite versus the Cowboy. Yeah. They enter week 15 to Against the Cowboy as a narrower three point home Favorite making it the first time since week 15 of 2022. Yeah. That they are actually the betting favorite to win a game. Rightfully so. They should be. They should be for everybody in the chat. If you watched the Panthers play defensively and offensively the past three weeks, PA wait maybe, maybe four weeks in the team that they played, it's come down to the goddamn nail in the coffin. Damn near to the end. Bryce Young. I don't know what you've been eating for breakfast. I don't know what you've been eating for lunch. I don't know what you've been eating for dinner, but boy you playing some hell of a football. Now you look like the Bryce Young we're used to seeing from Alabama. Now you look like the Bryce Young that they picked number one. You playing good football, great football. And the reason why they're scoring the point to just scoring everything starts at the quarterback position. Yep. Everything starts at a quarterback position and you doing everything right that you should be doing to give your team the best chance to win. Which is why you guys are the favorite because of your play. Yeah. I mean, wow. Two years. Yeah. Long time Coming. And you the favorite long time Comic. Long time. And you know what the funny thing about it is? What's that? This is the good thing. This is might be the start of something special, but not just the Panthers, Panthers fans, but the Panther organization. But for the team in general. Because all you gotta do now based on what you have going on, even though you're losing the games, you're competing. Huh? Yes. You're competing. Yes. People are Barely beating you. So you finna stack it, stack 'em one at a time, one at a time. Take this momentum that you finishing the season with, carry that bitch on. In the next year you gonna have off season off off season acquisitions. You gonna have a draft draft and that team is gonna continue to get better. You're gonna get pieces in there and before you know it, everything gonna change before you know it. And it all starts, it all starts, it all starts with a quarterback. And the quarterback is playing the way he should be playing. Which is the good thing for the pants in that organization.


A leg. Don't you let, hey, don't you come outta this game talking about my bad. Hey, I I know my dog. My dog. I know my dog been on that jug machine. Heavy though. Heavy Though. Hey, you don't talk about, you done had a coon for Thanksgiving, so you should be straight. Coon Bake would tell you probably had ba probably you don had it cut up in some bell pepper. Yeah, yeah. Onion. Yeah. Probably had a nice old sweet potatoes. You used to have some sweet potatoes or you don't know nothing about that. Yeah. But anyway. And see, you know, back in the day we had a fireplace too. Ocho Yeah. So we take sweet potatoes Right. And put 'em right down there in the, in the front of the fireplace. Yeah. With a hot coat. Put them cold on them. Yes sir. There it is. I Know about sweet potato. I know about sweet potato fry. Yeah, but You cook them in the stove.


We cooked out of the fireplace. Put them hot coals on them. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Put Some butter in that thing. What? It Still, I mean it still tastes the same though. X coming leg, leg, leg. He coming on Nightcap. When tonight for Real, man. Get get, get that Play on your Oh, not tonight. Not tonight In in the future. Oh man. This next week when they beat the Cowboys on Sunday. Ah, there we go. Matter of fact, you know what I, I, I can see it right now. I'm not saying I'm Cleo, he gonna score twice. I damn sure hope so. He gonna, he listen, he gonna score twice.


So this Sunday he coming on this Sunday After they beat the cowboy. Yeah. He gonna score twice. Watch. I bet you guarantee you. Yeah. But I, I, I'm happy for Bryce Young. Yeah, Most definitely. They're playing, they're playing much better offensive defense that, that get out there defensively. They were very close to ball game, very close to beating Kansas City. Very close to beating Philly. Yeah. And early in the year, they would tho those were games they would've lost by 30 blowouts. It would've been blowout. Blowout. They've lost those games by 30. You know who I'm happy. But This is something that can build on them. Show, You know what I'm happy for, what I'm happy for, for Coach Canis, I'm happy. I'm happy for him because the way they were playing, he was gonna get fired.


Yeah. If you look at, if you look at David TE's track record and his impatience when it comes to coaching and thinking that he can continue to bring people in and there's, there's never any continuity as far as the head coach being able to gel with his team and giving coaches a chance to win and build a team and build a winning team. I'm glad they turned things around for the head coach. 'cause now that person is off his back. Look Dave Teper. Look what I'm doing now. You see, we on the right track. Give me, give me a little bit more lease. Gimme a little bit more lease and I'm gonna get it together. The Volume
