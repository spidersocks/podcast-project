Hey, who doesn't love bacon? And did you know Oscar Meyer smokes their delicious bacon for 12 hours over real hardwood? That's a really long time to perfect a smoky flavor and even longer than it takes to go on a long road trip from Chicago to Pittsburgh. Stop for food along the way and still get there while the bacon is smoking. The point is Oscar Meyer takes the best cuts and smokes them over real hardwood chips. There's no wrong way to enjoy it. So buy some Oscar Meyer thick cut bacon.

Are you ready to have your bacon love in mind? Blown well. Here it is. Oscar Meyer takes 12 hours to smoke some delicious thick cut bacon. Most other bacon out there is smoked for four to six hours. But Oscar Meyer doubles that time. Let's put that into perspective. You could drive from Detroit to Omaha and Oscar Meyer. Thick cut bacon wouldn't be finished smoking. You could spend the morning and all afternoon watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy in full. You could even go to bed, get a full night's sleep, wake up shower, have breakfast including some delicious Oscar Meyer bacon and then drive to work and to think that the bacon would still be smoking. The point is all of these take at least half a day to complete and Oscar Meyer takes the best cuts and smokes them over real hardwood chips for a really long time until it tastes really good. So buy some Oscar Meyer thick. Cut bacon now and enjoy.

Now it's time for me to bring in my special guest when I Ming a special guest. I'm talking about a a former NFL football player and was damn good at what he did. Who you talking? Shit I'm talking about me and lemme bring my family in right quick. Smell me. Come on. What's up with my boy? Come on, come on. What's good How you bro? Don't be so hard on the Cowboys. I gotta be dog. Don't be so hard on the cowboy. I lost 35 on them bro. Bro. Dak played really good though. You got like who played really good? Who Dak played good bro. You must eyes pat bro.


Did you watch the game? Hell yeah I watched it with in my eyes I had, he was 27 with 39. He had three. Oh and still lost isn't it that folk that the goddamn safety can't goddamn get out his fucking stance. Get your ass back. Let's talk about it Pac Man. Let's talk about that Cowboys game for a second. Have you ever been on a defensive team? And I know you have that could not stop the run. Let's talk about it. I think that they was really out there gaps this week. Shout out to Mike Zimmer. Mike Zimmer is one of the best defensive coordinators there, there is in in in the, in the National Football league. I can't tell he just got there and sometimes it take a little time to get shit going but I truly think and this ain't no bias shit or none of that, that they got the keys to the puzzle.


The linebacker crew suck ass right now. That's the problem they got. That's the linebackers are all out they fucking gaps like get your ass in the A gap. It's an over front. And I heard people say oh well they outnumbered to the right motherfucker. They're not only reason they outnumber 'cause the linebacker's not bumping his ass over. And that's, that's my my point with them. But I truly think the Cowboys going to end up being a really good team come down the stretch. It's a lot of things they they getting used to. What about the Run gang? The Run gang is shitty. I agree with you with that.


Me personally I was Star Zeke. You would star Zeke. I was Star Zeke. You know why nobody want to tackle his big head ass. Nobody. You talking all that shit. If you go back and look in that field man they is smashing the coach son. He is like a who? He a Yeah he 110 pounds five, ten five three I mean to say so I don't know Zeke ain't, well maybe Zeke ain't soil enough in practice that he's that guy he don't need to practice talking about practice bro.


I've been sitting here waiting on you for 45 minutes. I ain't seen you practice Not one motherfucking time. Hey practice, practice is a strip bro. Zeke need to, Zeke need to do more man. Zeke need to get his ass in shape. That's it. So that's probably why he ain't star. This ass ain't in shape. I'm saying starting but like those type of, that was a physical ass game bro. That was a physical fucking game. And like this is me personally, like with the running backs that the Cowboys have, if we gonna start off making our motherfucking stance and standing on what we standing on, you gotta come down here punching heads.


You can't come out with this old finesse ass motherfucking offense but oh yeah we just gonna run motherfucking 37 and 30 motherfuck eight that don't work with the Cowboys. Not gonna work never work and cd lamb draw a couple big ball. Yeah And did not make a lot of separation like he should be doing. When we just talking a couple more a couple goddamn months ago about who should get paid this and that. That's just my my opinion. In in, in your opinion, who was the league of the Cowboys? If I had to choose a leader that I knew who the fuck else can you say he had three.


That is the guy that's gonna rap every he three running for his deal fucking life bro. And ain't even got running game. He the one calling the plays. He the one checking in and out plays. That's what it sound like. Yeah. He got in and out as as far as the box heavy or not. But he ain't calling all the goddamn plays bro. At the end packed at the end of the day, coordinator get paid to call the plays. Correct. Now if the box is heavy, boom I'm looking at the box. Ah safety high look like it coming down. But I can't really tell if he coming down.


Alright. I get decision to hand it off or call the pass. Yeah that's what that got. He ain't, he ain't, he ain't Tom Brady. We know he ain't goddamn Tom Brady. He ain't the one back there saying check he ain't pay me check, check, check. No, no, no he ain't no he ain't Rogers no we going shirt on the go. He on the linebacker. He ain't doing that. He doing if it's enough in the box, no let's pass the ball if it is enough in the box, throw the ball. Yeah. Now the cowboy defense played like shit this week everybody knew it.


Correct. And it was really basically the, they didn't stop the run but even with not stopping the run the deep balls that they gave away, it didn't even matter if they were running or passing. Shit. You gotta be top heavy. You can't even keep eight in the box motherfucking going for a bums over a back back man. Yeah. Every two segments. So like I think me personally, I think it's probably one of the worst game to have because I know Mike Zimmer. Mike Zimmer is, I'm telling you, if you don't listen to shit else, I'll tell you Mike Zimmer is a good fucking coach. Oh I know you're definitely a good coach. I know that for sure.


Good coach. And I just believe in, I believe in, I believe what I believe in his system. They just didn't play good this week. Moody had a good read for the Falcons and Kirk cousin finally fucking sat in the pocket and threw the ball. Like last week I her her cousin was still on ir. I'm like Jesus Christ. And then this week he go 24 24. Yeah. Yeah. 41 yards like that. Going to Ice Box tomorrow too. Get ice out. Yeah. Yeah. So like this week was, it was an interesting week. My boy beat John Ross. He, he just a dog bro.


He had 1 22 and like his numbers didn't show up in the restroom even though he had like 97 yards, 14 carriers. But he didn't show up like what he actually did. And, and entire game Falcons play good this week and the defense but don't let the Eagles get off the hook bro. Big play slay a quarterback. We gotta talk about it. Big play. Slay. Yeah. Let's talk about, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna say big play slay TRASHH. You, you big in the league. Eight, nine years. Yeah. Tough week this week. Let's talk about it though Pat. You know that's one thing about me. I ain't gonna sugarcoat. I know you, you us to watch this shit.


Facts so tell but the, he got killed this, he got caught looking in at Kirk. Kirk froze and it happens sometimes as a corner. I know that. That's what I'm saying. I know that happens And I like him. He he's a good corner no doubt he did. He was probably looking in the backfield because Kirk cousin was not the same person he was this week. Last week. Correct. And I ain't gonna give him no pass slate. I slate. I don't wanna see that shit next week. Yeah he already know. He he, he rock with me so he already know. Hey that's family. You know that. Yeah. Yeah but he had a long, he had a long, he had a long day today.


So that's family. So that's your family right Man, that's my family. Text him right now. All caps TRASHH should I call him? Hey everybody got about Colin Murray what you feeling? How you feeling about Kaari TRASHH this week? We gotta step that shit up. How you feeling about Kyle Murray bro, he Marvin Harrison Jr. I think the relationship will get there. This week was way better than the first week. He missed him to win the game last last week. I like Colin Murray because he can extend the play. I do not think he had enough fucking tools and weapons around him to be successful.


I'm talking about offense, defense, special team coaching, all that shit right now he really don't have that many weapons. I'm saying you got couple weapons. It ain't elite like what Joe Burrow got. It ain't elite like Hearst got it ain't Elite like Kurt got it ain't Elite like Mahomes got like it's a lot of good teams in NFL Even even Justin Fields, Pittsburgh got a lot of fucking elite players to. I'm glad you all spoke on that Justin Fields and Russell situation. Yeah like Russell Wilson was never just fill never he be took me to peanut up butter and jelly sandwiches man.


Hey, hey bro, that shit over with. I love Russ as a person. That's my boy. Him his girl. We family. But like you ain't putting who you putting Russ back in the game if they go three and no this week, not if they go three and no but hey but but I, I know I'm gonna get killed for this. It ain't like Phil's balling though. He gets, they turn the ball over. He just, we made last week bro. Even though it was going back this road 73 yard pass. Get the hell outta I got 73 yard. What you watching man? How many yard you must be Justin Fields got you smoking.


Why you watching the game that this ain't trying but how many Fields's got right now? Two games. How many It don't matter. I guarantee you Mike tumbling to take Fagg as Ben Berger back right now. Man. Mike Tum happy is a motherfucker Justin. Yeah because he, yeah he's because he two he happy against a motherfucker and I don't even root for Pittsburgh but like I gotta call the facts where the facts is. Justin Field a good ass quarterback and guess what? No I'm not saying that White tumbling saved his career and Justin Field career. Russell Wilson will never play down in Pittsburgh unless Justin field get hurt period point black.


Okay. But the defense playing great in in in Pittsburgh. Right. You know why? What happened when they played Stop. You know why they might not be scoring a lot of points but guess what go look at the goddamn plays that the defense playing. They ain't playing 70 plays like they was playing last year. I give you that one quarterback that we had from high school. At least we getting down there and running the clock. Yeah we playing 60 plays a game. Oh we can. That's manageable. And they got one of the best head coaches in the fucking national football league. He had a lot, lot of shitty players and shitty teams that made him really fucking good And I ain't boosting a bag about fucking Pittsburgh. I don't even fucking like this thing.


Don't like nothing about the Old street, the organization, none of that shit. But I do get respect with respect dude. For sure. Mike Toman is a fucking genius bro. Yo they won't last shit with nobody. They gonna win games this year for sure. They gonna win games. They gonna be really good switching girls. Caleb Williams with the barrels. Trouble. Trouble Bernie Mac. Trouble. Trouble, trouble. Hot garbage. Trouble. If you a defensive, if you a defensive team or you a defensive coordinator, how are you approaching playing Kayla Williams?


Each and every week. Are you throwing everything at him the kids? Hell yeah. Hell yeah as you can see preseason he was fucking unbelievable And I even thought, I'm like damn seen that throw how you get out the pocket? Boom boom that look good. Pamm, pamm, PAMM And. we playing one coverage in preseason bro. Man to man we gonna figure out who can guard everybody. So preseasons are pretty easy now that you see the season going on and everybody just disguising and making shit look like all these different coverages. It take a little time. Take a little time And not saying this but Patriot's head coach like Bill Belichick, bill Belichick said that he was gonna have the hardest time when he went through the draft and shit And officer was like damn well I can't tell he had a good preseason and he's struggling right now and he got a lot of weapons, A lot of weapons.


I didn't know DJ Moore was like that Pat. Yeah. Yeah they got a lot of weapons so like, and they got a decent line like he missing a lot of throws and it's, it's a little slow to him right now. He'll, he'll catch up to it but right now he's saying ghosts out there because he don't know which coverages what because that disguising bro like everybody good in college, everybody ain't good in the NFL and you can see so I'm glad you said that. Heisman pick bro. The Heisman pick number one a rock. See they just bitched his ass down in Carolina. Yeah right Young for Andy.


Goddamn Don who was the third round pick? I ain't shot do still in the league fa bro you don't even gonna get me started about that. I'm just saying like and I hate going this route but a motherfucker like Andy Dalton could come in and play and Cam Newton tuna fish ass can't even get, can't even get a call. You can't tell me right now. Cam Newton ain't better than Andy Dalton but maybe Andy Dalton is a better teammate is what they'll use. Probably will say or you know someone they somebody can, well you know what they gonna say, they gonna say where from us as we don't we we wanna be Alpha Meghan, we don't know how to play the backup.


Yeah. You know and I speak for myself for sure. I ain't, I I can't be a backup. I'm sorry I tried to do that shit and didn't really pay me too many and all this halfway through the season I'm like bro I'm outta here bro. And that's just me because I'm shit Cam was the first pick overall shout out to West Lakehouse school. Westley High School cam my dog. I went to West Lakehouse school. Guess what? I was the first defensive player picked overall. So like if a motherfucker tell you like oh yeah and it is easy to just go that's a lot. Andy Dalton is used to being a backup bro. He was a motherfucking second, third round pick.


This motherfucker won the first name off the board. So it is easier for him to doubt to be all, all right I'm gonna go help this kid and get better. You know why you used to being in the back of the line. Me personally, I can't do it. And this is me personally and I love the game of football. I would sit right here and talk shit and critique before I got a babysit is if if that's a a better way of putting it. And if I know that like I could really get the job done like Cam was still good like the years that Cam fucking played bad, he was hurt and it's a lot Andy Don it is not what Cam knew was, I don't even think Andy Don ever wanna fucking play on me.


Cam New wouldn't always at Super Bowl for sure. So I don't even think, I don't even think you can fucking compare the two of those like any Dons not would never be brung up in the conversation with fucking Cam Newton as far as a quarterback now backup. Yeah 'cause fucking Cam has never been a fucking backup. But as far as the starting quarterback or any kind of quarterback in college, high school, Peewee whatever the, whatever you wanna name you would never mention Cam new name an Andy do name in the same conversation as far as caliber of players and never Cam's a a plus caliber player.


Amy Don is definitely a C player. Y'all hit that like button. Yeah. Subscribe right now. So right now you know when you played in the NFL what quarterback in today's game right now that you probably would hate going up against, what is it about Mahomes in your opinion makes him special? He's, he's the modern day Aaron Rogers and he got Andy Reed with him. Andy Reed is what make Patrick Mahomes special bro. Like he can make all the throws and all that shit. That's cool. But Andy Reed is a fucking musician when it comes to dealing up like 90% of these plays bro.


They wide ass open And then you see every now and then, you know he get out the pocket, make a left-handed throw, boom boom boom jazz it up. But like look at the play calling, look at the play calling. 90% of the offenses in the NFL is behind is made behind Andy Reed and Shanahan like 90% of everything that everybody is running right now. Oh man. Got so much spunk in the offense. It is. It's ridiculous bro. It's ridiculous. That's crazy.


That's crazy Pac Man.


But let's talk about this new show. You got my brother, let's talk about it. What's the name of it man? Oh yeah, the Pacman Jones Show man shout out to my sponsor. Be online Ag. I'm on every Tuesdays and Fridays we talk. Sports culture, bullshit, hot topics, everything going on. I got an album dropping. Let's talk about first week of October. Yeah, just working bro and giving back, you know what I mean? My like much is expected, much is given. I've been truly blessed through everything I've been through and like I'm enjoying my kids. All my kids are superstars. Dope, dope, dope. That's what we doing the for but enjoy talking shit though. But like the show. Yeah the Pacman Jones show gotta have you on there too brother. Y'all have you? No. You know I'm gonna pull up for show y have you on there?


The Ravens down oh two right now man. Ravens. What, what, what, what? What's going on up there with Lamar Jackson right now? They ain't smoking at Pacman. They gotta get high there bro. They done lost all they mojo. You ain't never seen Tucker kick the ball like this. Tucker is the best kicker probably ever. Maybe second best ever. Yeah to ever play the game. He don't miss bro. He's been missing a little bit. Lamar look a little bit like he ain't, ain't Lamar Flowers is the only thing that really look like what the Ravens should be looking like right now. They got Harry what's what's going on?


They don't dunno how to use them yet. They, they haven't figured out how to use this big ass yet. Like you think about week one he should get on the ball like every time going down there. He got a ball one time. I know one one second half yesterday he only got the ball. What, six what? One time yesterday? Second the second. I think he got it like two times second half. But like still like bro he gotta get the ball like he ain't one of them them backs. He ain't no now and then back like you gotta change the office and like I, what I don't understand is it'll open up everything for the Ravens then boom, let his big ass gone.


Let this locomotive go then they gonna have to pack, pack the box. Guess what? Fire one-on-one on the crossing route. Boom. Play action let Lamar use his feet. But right now they, it is just like all right we gonna just put our trust in Lamar hands and throw the ball. That is the worst idea. Yeah. Yeah it definitely the worst idea. We found that out last year bro. And I not saying then, but that is not a good idea at all. When you sing a situation like that down in Miami Dolphin with the quarterback tour, right? How you feel about that man? Third concussion in two years. Like I'm all for for the players.


Like I've been through that though like I had and I don't really think it's concussion between me and you bro. I think it's something with the spot. When I was in Dallas I got hit by fucking, what was it that hit me? Mar Harris for the Patriots. I say for Patriot, for Pittsburgh, Jane Harris, Jane on top of my head. And it's the same video. If you go back and check this I, I'll probably send you the video. Same thing happened. Boom. On the top of my head. Boom. My arms go like this. I paralyzed for like eight minutes. Dang. Boom. I came back and played in that game though, dropped the pick 'cause I was just a little wobbly.


End up going to the doctor, send out, set out the rest of the season in Dallas. That was the reason why I really left Dallas because people didn't know my neck was messed up. Damn. So when I went to the doctor's then they was like, oh yeah, yeah just go ahead sit out here and you probably should retire. Like what? They're like nobody come back from this injury. So I leave there, I go to Atlanta, I'm just chilling, I'm still working out and shit. But I ain't really thinking about football but I'm thinking about football. After that I never got anything checked on me. I ended up getting a call from the banks. They're like, Hey we want you to come up there right now. It was right after they lost the playoff game. Coach Lewis called. I said all right, boom.


I come, I come up and work out. It was zero below. Boom. I'm like, bro, where? Where's the endo at? They ain't have no endo. I was like, oh hell no. So I went out there and worked out for like five minutes but I act like my hand screen bro. I ain't doing this shit bro. It is. Y'all done shoveled off half of the goddamn field. Yeah, it's full of snow. Anyway, I make a long story short, I I didn't do the workout. Came back, played with the Bangas, had the same injury bro. Playing against the Falcon. I had just score the touchdown right after touchdown cover two boom. Same thing had this time. I'm paralyzed for like three minutes. Like oh this one really scary.


I'm like boy I gotta, I gotta get something done. But my point saying is if you look at that video when a person have a concussion that mean I got hit in my head, boom, I'm out. Every time you have a concussion, there's no way that your body parts are going limp. You can go and watch any concussion on all the videos that you wanna watch. Every time you have concussion, there's no way that your body parts go limps every time. If the dude that mean you have some kind of spinal, spinal cord injury and like I think that Miami Dolphins that did a horrible job of diagnosing what the fuck is going on because I'm willing to bet my money that he's gonna have some kind of surgery.


They probably won't announce it to Wednesday. Or he might try to go through it because you can. It's up to the player to say all right I do it. If I don't like you ultimately get the last decision. Like all right, I still wanna go and play and they can't do nothing about that. So do I think you need next surgery? Yeah. Do I think he'd go back and play? I think he come back and play. I don't think he said he was gonna come back and play. Not a good decision but yeah. And you know why he come back and play. 'cause everybody think this is the year from Miami. This is close as they've been since Jesus Christ.


The last time Miami been good since doing Yeah, Marengo. Yeah. It's a long time ago. Long, long freaking time ago man. But let's lemme you in the cannabis business ain't you big man, let's talk about that man. What, what's what, what's what? It's like getting over in that world bro. Because you, you from the sports world now you over into the cannabis world. Like what it's like getting into, you know I got my own strand too, but for the vi that's watching might want to you know, be get they entrepreneurship on man. What's something kind of the perks about being in the cannabis business? Brian, what has cannabis done to help you? Well I deal with bipolar stress.


I got, I deal with a lot of mental things. So I used to take a lot of meds so I got off the meds and then I got got on the smoke. But like not only the smoke, I do a lot of things to deal with my mental Yeah But like the cannabis industry is not easy as everybody think it is. But if you can get with a good team shot at the burning shot at the cookies. If you can get with a good team shot at King City Garden Hill in Ohio. We all Legal hill in Ohio too. If you can get with a good team and figure out the right structure, I think it's good. And to all the cannabis users really dive into like what you smoking.


'cause some things like create appetite, some, some things make you paranoid, some things may give you a little anxiety. Like these different bugs are are different and differents are different. But like I I I'm all for like, especially when it comes to the mental health part. Like I truly believe this is better than taking so, and all the other chemical pills that they give us and athletes, shit we can prescribe Hydrocodone, Percocet, all this shit by the second And. we can't even smoke two joints.


Like now we're getting, now we getting to the time that we can smoke and shit. Which is, which is way better. But like I just don't understand like if you can gimme a script of 80 Percocets, why the fuck you can't gimme a ounce Weed? Weed? Yeah. I'm just saying my thoughts but yeah. Yeah. Y'all gotta go and get that pack out the pack. It's everywhere. Look, I I'll go and get that Pacman Jones smoke man. Yeah bro. We gotta have a smoke out next time. We, we, we was just with each other. We can do that. Yeah we should did that.


We do that of we had a good time that weekend. Hey man that was, I had a ball down there. They talking about Freeport Street bowl was bro, Freeport was nice man to see everybody come together like that bro wasn't no fights, wasn't no drama. Just lot little yeah lot of holes. Lot of holes.

are You ready to have your bacon love in mind? Blown well. Here it is. Oscar Meyer takes 12 hours to smoke some delicious thick cut bacon. Most other bacon out there is smoked for four to six hours. But Oscar Meyer doubles that time. Let's put that into perspective. You could drive from Detroit to Omaha and Oscar Meyer. Thick cut bacon wouldn't be finished smoking. You could spend the morning and all afternoon watching the Lord of the Ring's trilogy in full. You could even go to bed, get a full night's sleep, wake up shower, have breakfast, including some delicious Oscar Meyer bacon and then drive to work and to think that the bacon would still be smoking. The point is all of these take at least half a day to complete. And Oscar Meyer takes the best cuts and smokes them over real hardwood chips for a really long time until it tastes really good. So buy some Oscar Meyer thick. Cut bacon now and enjoy.

Lot going on Pat. Yeah, I know you wanna vouch. I I gotta go do I research as a person I fell out on. I ain't really fall out with him. I just didn't like the way he did Chad As far as on the live shit, you know. Oh yeah, you wanna work for esp? Well I did my research about espn boom boom. Like that's just me personally. Like you don't, you don't do that. 'cause first of all, it's hard for us to even get into anything right now. And like now it's our time and the first time we get something, once a motherfucker go viral and get all these numbers now it's like, all right, I'm gonna shit on you. Even, even though I don't give a fucking people late already two times we don't discuss that shit on camera.


Our business is our business. You don't put that shit out no matter how many likes and subscribes and all that shit. Especially when you dry snitch. But like you can't do that. And that's the only reason why I really been on this ass like these last, well not literally week, week or two. Hold hold on, pause. Not on his ass but been talking about him is is like right like treat, treat the motherfucker how you want treated me and I expect shit talking to the fullest. But as far as just bashing the motherfucker to bash him because of Fame or whatever, you can set the clip back.


I ain't with that shit. Ain't with and like right now on Be online you could bet on was it Michelle, Michael, Isha? Keisha I'm talking about I I I I'm gonna say Michelle. Well that's because you biased. I gotta be, you don't have to be, I gotta be biased man. Why? Because I have never felt that vibe and I know how the internet can be. Alright. That's your thing. I know I I'm a internet era. I know this me, you know I'm on the internet. No but you know you, you are a star. You know sports.


Nah, I'm a street star first. Well we know that too but I'm saying everybody else got can't say don't all these fake sex stories is fraud. All this shit was a setup. Okay. Let say if it was a set, I'm not saying if it was setup, I don't know. But what I'm saying here, I'm going, I'm saying it was a Michelle all you going with it Michelle, that don't mean it. It was a he or she. I don't know. I know you just saying that's why I'm gonna give him bigger figure could die.


Alright, we'll go with it Michelle. We just don't know the last name of Michelle. Michelle Tucker. It definitely wasn't Obama. That's the damn show. Speaking of that man, I was telling people man, you know man you a fool for gold. How you feeling about this Super Bowl incident man with Kendrick Lamar? Rightfully so. I I do not agree with that. Definitely think I thought it should if been all cash money, not just Lil, I think it should have head headline Cash, money records featuring the headline of of everybody.


Like everybody up on the cash money and Bur Baby and Stunner, I mean Stunner and the big dog. Like it should have slim Maggie Fresh. That's what I meant. Slim and Baby and like the whole c everybody up under there. Like I don't agree with, we just seen Kendra Lamar, he was just at the last Super Bowl. You forgot. See that's how, that's the problem. People already forgot that he was at the last fucking Super Bowl. And personally how many songs do we know of Kendra Lamar compared to Le one And I'm, I'm into the news and I watch everything but I know, I know for sure that because I'm with the young era, like I'm, I'm out here with the young kids.


They mo they know more know more Wayne songs than Ken Lamar. Oh for sure. Hell yeah. Like I don't get it. NFL dropped the ball. Actually I was trying to figure out who decision this was. I'm thinking it was Jay-Z He definitely, his decision there ain't no thinking it was, if it was his decision he definitely dropped the ball for all fam fans and consumers this year. And now it's like all right, well you just gotta least perform. No, no don't perform Wayne don't do it. Don't do it.


So you wanna see, I mean you wanna see Master PI wanted to see all them, everybody from New Orleans. Damn right. I wanted to see Master PI wanted to see Boosty too. He could have been the last one on there but I thought this shit New Orleans got enough. Fred Bain coulda had all of them. Kevin Gates. I don't get that. All of them even under the underground with the bands and shit. I, that's what I wanna see when I go to New Orleans. I don't wanna see Ken Lamar New Orleans. He like, he, I can't, we can't go down Burger Street with the band and shit playing Ken La Martin. That's my business. I think right now the reason why Kendrick is is where he at right now.


And that's what Jay-Z want. That's what the NFL want. They gonna ride with that. They not like us. They, that's all they gonna play the whole night. Man listen they not like us. That's cool. Angela Lamar is not like your damn little. I agree. We come on man. Come on man. I get it. I'm with you but JayZ huh? And you know I don't agree. I don't either but you know all that fanatic shit, all that fanatic shit, I like fanatics and everything but some of that shit is is is commercial and which I know the football is different than commercial Peer point black.


The NFL is the best game in the world bro. Best game. Most definitely the best game in the world bro. Fuck us through this right quick. Like on Mondays after Sunday, what do y'all do Mondays? Nothing. Hell yeah. So normally after a, a routine week, so if, if you play, you play on Sunday and you don't have a game on like till next Sunday, you go in there at like 10 o'clock in the morning cold tub breakfast team meeting at bro at like 12 o'clock after team meeting breakdown. If you win they give game balls. If you lose, you get bitch can ssed at then you goes to team defense and offensive team meetings.


You in there, you break down the whole field and depending on when there's a loss, if you win normally you outta there after that meet. If you lose you can go to position meetings, you gonna go over like what plays that we could have played better and different things that we can come up for the week and then you outta there and then Tuesdays you off. Like for instance for the Bengals this week they play Monday night. So they went in and watched film early this morning off for like from 10 and don't come back till Wednesday at two o'clock 'cause they play Monday. So yeah, the NFL schedule is is is pretty time worth I would say like people ask me like why you don't want to coach?


Why bro, I've been spending my whole fucking life in the, from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day except two days for two for 18 years. I played, well like I should say, let's just say 20 years, 25 years from college to the time I retired and then want me to go back in there and coach. Nah, I told Dion, nah I, I'll pass on now one. How you feel about all the screw they coach me getting man. Well like he know what he signed up for. I think he does a great job of leading in bro. And he's been like a big mentor in my life and but me truth and I'm not saying this and I, he probably going to text me.


He look like by me saying it's live on the show. I think going to Florida State after this show Florida State fucking suck. Then I lost three games to nobody. Memphis, Boston College. And I forget what they just lost to. But that was a job that I think he wanted before he took the Colorado job. I think he got what, $25 million left on his Colorado deal. He moving, he losing two of the biggest people in the program. I don't know if I should be saying this but I think, I dunno, I don't know. We might be going down south to the next game we go to. But that would be home for him though.


That would be home for St. Pete. I just left St. Pete shout to my people in St. Pete. Yeah. A show guy there. Guess the other day man. It was man man love down there in St. Pete. Man shout out to my Hey there love in St. Pete man. A lot of love I ain't know across head over the clear water. Please believe me. Mm Man. Bad spot ain't a bad spot at all. At all. Hey oh man. Anything else man? You need more shouts. Anything you want, you wanna let the people know man, whether oh man do real Pacman Jones on all music platform.


I got a lot of stuff that's dropping on my birthday. September 30th, the Pacman Jones show also

I'm gonna give you two 50 free bet play and I'm probably having throw in a hundred ca a hundred free span of casino right now on Be Online Ag. You smell me Okay, smell You on that.


But hey Pat, check this out man. Lot of people be sending me messages and stuff. It's part the show while I do the, I asked you a question, you gimme hell no. Alright. You know I'm gonna ask you something. You can say hell no or this and that. So do Pacman Jones still shoot Ds in the hood? Hell no. Hell no. Hell fuck do Pacman do Pacman Jones still splurge money. Yeah, still be surging bro. You still be helping everybody bro. I ain't gonna say everybody. No I don't do that. Everybody shit like, but I got a, a group of probably four people that's been very pivotal into what I'm doing.


You get what I'm saying? So not them, not the one, not them. You know I'm talking about the stragglers. What stragglers? I'm talking, I always knew you would make it fam, but I ain't never supported nothing but always saying that man. All my partners getting paper like splurge is like they splurging on me. I splurge on them. All right. It might be my week when we going to the mall this week, but next week might be his week. So like I think I got a good group of guys around me. Shout out the rock, shout out the fire. Like we take care of each other. Like it ain't no nah that splurge it way it been over with bro.


Like and you, you'll figure that like people will figure it out like it's the time and place everything. But like everybody gotta work. Anybody could be anything right now bro. Facts. Facts. 20 a a hundred thousand dollars being a TRASHH man I'm talking about that's a hundred K. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like you could be anything you wanna be but like you gotta, you gotta put in the work. So if you talking about like just some hats, some, some, some, some shit around me that like just to be around. Nah, we don't do that. Nah, hell nah. I my you seen me, you seen how I move like ain't no way that I would be moving the way I'm moving if I was moving like that.


Like like everybody around me is doing something like either getting me some money or helping we helping each other get some money. Get some money. For sure. Yeah, no cap just part of the show. What we do TRASHH other day so far since Sunday games and today's game, who would you get TRASHH Sugar, TRASHH, sugar Day to Carolina, TRASHH, snake, TRASHH, Dega, Carolina Grasshoppers. They're no longer the Panthers just bitch the star quarterback.


I hate that too but man, he, he ain't seeing the field Pat. He ain't seeing the motherfucking field. He listen him bro. He listen him. He ain't like they say, they say he ain't got no offensive line down there. Man. My engineer right here is Kenny real quick. This boy right here is about a hundred. And how much you would one 50. That's what Bryce went, imagine von Miller hitting him every time bro. Ooh yeah. Like bro that that and really he's not that elusive in the pocket to extend the play.


Like them little hits that that look like. Oh yeah he just got hit. That shit hurt. That hurt like that hurt, that hurt. Somebody say Trevor Lawrence ain't too far. I didn't agree with what Trevor Lawrence got paid but Carol really is paying like a, playing like a, a monster right now and he got a lot of tools around him and that division is not as, what's the word I use Physical as a FC North.


So like Tennessee is okay, the Texas are really good. The coach or Nixon for sure Anthony Richardson. Man that's my guy man they going, they gonna have to figure it out. They got to figure it out down there. Figure out some protection for him. Yeah. Shit. Think about throw the ball getting But as a head coach bro, as a head coach you gotta coach is good bro. Head coach is good. That's why the Eagles, that's why the Eagles are a subpar team right now because he's not there. But like he got tools but he don't really got all of the tools.


Like he don't just look at the team, look at the line, receivers receiver, then just go to the defensive line and then the back end and then when you look at, all right, so how many guys you got Elite in the back end? They only got one as far as linemen, they got really one and a half. As far as defensive line, offensive line is pretty decent. I would go two or three over there running the back game. All right. But everything else is subpar And with the Texas shit, Texas got everything right now. Joe Mixon was the best thing that the goddamn Texas could have ever got. Yeah it's gonna be, he beat the Texas in that division.


I yeah, I think the Texas gonna win that division. I think the Chief's going to win their division. Agree. I think somehow Pittsburgh gonna win that division. Man. Don't say that shit on here bro. I'm about to get up. I'm about to. Pittsburgh gonna be gonna be, have a bug of record than the Ravens dog with Justin Fields. The fuck I hang up off here. Look Justin with Justin Fields up man.
