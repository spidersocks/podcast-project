Ronnie Coleman, Ronnie, how you doing man? I good hanging in As usual, Man. It's been a while, bro. We go back a Long way because I remember when you came back in the, in the late nineties, used to come back to Rope who used to train me Rope Manny.


Yep. Guest poses at his as his shows every year. So we've come, you, you've come a long way. We I've come a long way, bro. I got my own cognac. This is my cognac shaped by La Portier. Oh, Cool. And I want to toast your career. The most unbelievable thank bro. Professional body building career ever. Thank you. Absolutely, bro. Growing up, you're from Louisiana? Yep. Yep. Born and Raised. Born and raised in Louisiana. So growing up, obviously you worked, you probably worked on a farm or farm like labor. Yes, sir. I sure did. Chopping that cotton. Okay. So what did Ronnie Coleman wanna be when he was a kid? I wanted to be a professional football player. Okay. Yeah. And I played high school, junior high college.


Didn't make it to the pros. Right. So you grow up, so you played all sports, you played football, you played basketball or you just mainly played football? I mainly played football. I didn't play basketball. I did a little track also, but football was my thing. Right, Okay. So you go to, so you went to Grambling? Yep. GSU played For the legendary coach Rob Eddie Robinson. Well, what was that experience like? Man, it was a lot of fun. I mean, we had the greatest time of all, had the greatest coach of all time, and Eddie, Rob And. we, we lived the joyous fun life. And it, it was real hectic on the road because every, every, everybody was trying to get Coach Rob.


Especially when he broke that record. Correct. But it was the, probably the greatest time of my life. Right. Greatest experience of my life for sure. I, I al I, I often wanna go back to those days, but you know how that is. But that was the greatest time of my life by far. So you, you mentioned like growing up you wanted to play professional football, you got a college scholarship to go GSU, but I heard you, you injured your neck. Was that probably the main reason why you didn't make it or was it ability? Well, I had a lot of injuries, but I, first of all, I didn't, I didn't go on scholarship. I walked on, Walked On. Yeah.


And, and tried out and then made the team. But I initially, I hurt my back real bad. Okay. Real bad. It started probably when I was like a sophomore. Okay. I went to the chiropractor, went to the bunch of doctors. Nobody could find out anything wrong, but the chiropractor said, you know, I can help you get it back to normal where you could be, you know, function real good. And he did. And I went to him probably about every single day for about four, five months. And then I backed off and, and started going like twice a week.


But finally I got it back to where I could function real good. And it wasn't no big problem. I in injured my neck well one day in practice, but it wasn't, it wasn't nothing serious. Nothing. Not to make the tackle Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Making the tackle. It did keep me out for about two days of practice, but I, you know, that, that was about it for, for the most part, A lot of people think, you know, the lifting, the weights is what injured my back, but it was actually playing football my sophomore year. And those injuries, they follow you throughout life. I mean, it, it never went away.


And when I got here in Dallas, I, I picked up a chiropractor once again and it would be time that I had to go like every day for a while. And then in 96 I did injure her, the disc getting ready for the Arnold Classic. Correct. Kept me out for about two weeks. But I went to the chiropractor. That's when I got into massage therapy also. And, and that helped me out a lot. But I still was able to do the Arnold Classic in that was in March. It was always in March. And I got it back to where I, I couldn't squat real heavy and deadlift real heavy.


In 2001, I deadlifted about 800 for a couple reps. And in oh three I squatted 800 for a couple reps. So I was pretty, I got, I got it pretty much back to normal use around that time. Do You think about what could have been, had you not had those injuries? Like could you believe you could have squatted excess of 900 or a thousand pounds deadlift, maybe 900 or a thousand pounds. Have those thoughts ever gone through your mind? Like, man, if I'd have never had these injuries, I only imagine just how strong I could have Been. Yep. My, every single day, I still regret not dead lifting that 800 more than two reps, because at the time I knew I had already deadlifted it anyway, but squad it, I was like, if I could only just get two reps like I did on deadlift, I'll be set.


Right. But I got to it and those two reps were a lot lighter than you, than I thought. And I was like, man, I could have did it at least four more reps. Wow. With that 800, it was just that light. So, so I'm like, I'm not going to temp fate again. I'm getting ready for the Miss Olympia, I don't wanna blow out another disc. Correct. So I like, I, I know what I'll do. I'll just load up the leg press and try to make up for it. So we went to the leg press, I loaded it up with 2300 pounds. Right. And then nine. Well, you couldn't put Any more weight on It. Ronnie couldn't put no more weight on it. That's why, I mean, when I say we loaded it up Yeah.


Y'all about to have every 45 that was in the gym. Yeah, exactly. Y'all had it on the Pretty much. But Brian keep quite a few of those laying around. But I did do that for nine reps and sort of made up for it. But you know. Right. It ain't eight, it ain't 800, it ain't 800 on the squat. Correct. But You were a power, you also were a power. You, you started out as a Power lifter. Yeah. I started power lifting in high school. Okay. And. we would go from state to state doing power lifting meets. And I, I did Okay. Nothing spectacular. I did that for like two years and then our power lifting team kind of folded. So I did like my sophomore year, my junior year, and like I said, I did pretty good when I came out to Dallas, I entered some more, like, it wasn't a full power lifting me, it was something like a deadlift me.


Okay. And I did a lot of those in which I deadlifted probably like seven 50, but the, the highest I got. But nothing But what weight class you were in two twenties. What weight class were you in? The two 20, I Started out in 180 1. 180 1 what? Yeah. In high school, remember? Yeah. And then I went to 1 98. Okay. And I, I didn't, I think my senior year I weighed 180 5. Okay. And in high school. Right. I didn't get to the 200 until I got to college. Until you got to college. Okay. Yeah. I, I think I went all the way up to like 2 25, somewhere in there playing middle linebacker. Right. So were you, did you lift a lot in college? I mean, what, what was your weight program like in college?


We didn't have one. We didn't have one. Y'all didn't have one? No. Nonexistent if you want to lift weight, they had a small weight room about the size of this room here. Okay. That you, you go, if you, if you got up at like six in the morning, they keep it over from six to seven for one hour. Okay. But it was volunteering. Right. But as far as mandated or required weight training, none at all. Was weightlifting always one of your passions? Oh yeah. Yeah. It, it, my passion started that when I was about 12 years old. Okay. When I was about 10, 11.


Everywhere I went, people always ask me if I worked out, if I worked out. And I'm like, no, no, no. Well, I finally got tired of saying no. I'm like, I wanna say Yeah. You know? Right. So I, I picked up, I had my mom buy me a 110 pound waist set from Walmart and I started working out in the backyard, you know? And the plastic one. Huh? The plastic one. Yeah. You know those? I do. And right around 12, you know, I kind of fell in love with it and it just took off from there and know, like I said, I joined the polishing team, like in, I think, I think I was 14 when we started that powerlifting team.


So that was like a couple years later. Right. And that's when I really got into it. Right. But I got that passion from early age, you know, lifting in my backyard with my friends. We all had mostly curl stuff. You know, we just curl and, and, and do some overhead presses, but nothing serious. Right. You know, just having fun and, and that's where my passion came from. Lifting in, in the backyard. And now all of a sudden you can start to see your body start to transform. You start to see, you get muscle definition, you start to get peaks on the biceps. Yep. And now, And now all of a sudden you like, okay, Yeah, this is looking good.


You were Hooked from that point on. You were hooked. I was hooked from that point on. Yep. You were talking, we were talking the early off offset that you had some odd jobs, I think you said in college, which once you got to college, you started, you was delivering pizzas or something. Was that college or when you got here In Dallas? Yeah, that was in Dallas. But in, in college I had some odd jobs too. What'd you Do in college? Worked for police department. Okay. In college. Yeah, in college it was called a work study. That's how you pay for tuition. Okay. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Instead of the Pell grade, you got a work study you had to go see. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I, I got Pell Grant, but they didn't pay the full, the full tuition. So I had to do work study. Okay. So I did the police department and all we did was just wrote tickets, parking tickets, come on car.


We did like transfer to the bank, you know, help the citizen drop their money off. And that was about it. Then when that work study ran out the next year I got on at the journalism department doing writing. Okay. Sports writing. Okay. And I had a lot of fun with that. So I was a pretty good writer at the time. And then when the sports editor left, they promoted me to sports editor. And that was a real, real hard job. 'cause we had to put the newspaper together. Correct. So you had to measure out everything, measure out your ads and all that.


But I never really cut on. But, you know, my instructor, she mostly helped me out with that a lot. But I did all the editing, you know, all the stories that came in, and it was a, it was another great experience for me. So you go to college, you going to, you graduate, I think you graduated cum laude. Yep. Instead of Thank you Loudy. I ain't gonna lie about I was major in eligibility. I stay eligible, So Yeah. Yeah. I, I was pretty, pretty studious when I was going to school. I studied every single night. I was in accounting, so. Right. I had to study hall. Absolutely. And, and, and I wanted to be the first one in my family to, to get a college degree.


Okay. So that motivated me real hard to do everything in my power to get that degree. Okay. And when I got it, it was the greatest feeling ever, you know. But I kinda regret not staying in college a little while longer because like I said, it was the greatest time of my life. Yeah. Be college. College was great. It was the greatest time of my life, you know? It absolutely is. Okay. So now you realize like, you know what, this NFL thing might not work out. When did you transfer? What did you want? When you got a college, you got a degree. It's in accounting. Yeah. I don't know if you ever put that degree to work because you came to Dallas and you started, became a police officer and the rest is kind of going There.


Well, actually I came to Dallas and I tried to get a job in accounting. Okay. I went on a lot of interviews and most of the time they were like, well, we need somebody with experience. And I'm like, well, you gimme a job and I'll get you some nce. How am I gonna get it when you won't give an opportunity? Exactly. So I did that for almost two years. Wow. But at the same time, I had a car note that I had to pay. So I had got a car on this college program. You could buy a car and your first car note wasn't due to three months later. Wow. So I went out and bought this car, brand new 1987 Sunbird gt.


And my first payment was coming up and I'm like, oh man, I ain't got, I got no money. I need to get a job. I need to get a job real bad. So I took the first thing that came along and the first thing that came along was Domino's Pizza. So you a pizza, you a delivery Driver. I'm a delivery driver slash assistant manager. So I made pizzas and delivered them. And at the end of the night, I, you know, collected all the money and counted and took it to the bank and all that kinda stuff. Right. I did that for two long years. And when I didn't make enough money doing that, I got made a side job delivering newspapers.


Okay. So I, here I am with a college degree, graduating in a county, in a county graduated, and I'm delivering pieces and throwing newspapers, and I couldn't wait to get outta Domino's Pizza. Right. So I'm like, you know what? This thing with the accountant is not working out. So every time, every week I got the newspaper, there was always a classified ad. And now for a hiring police officer, no experience needed. So I'm like, oh man, you know, police department, you know, I can use my mental ability as well as my physical ability.


Right. You know, always got some bad crooks out there trying to start some trouble. So that's what I did. I applied for the police department after two years working at Domino's. And Arlington hired me in March of 1989. March 20th, 1989 was my first day. And at the time I was living in Irving. And when I graduated the academy I moved to Arlington. Okay. And I've been here ever since, Delivering pieces. Did you deliver more than you ate or you ate more than you delivered? I ate way more than I believe. If you'd been an Uber driver, you'd got a terrible grade.


Yeah, Yeah, exactly. You'd Be already would've been off. But I ate pizza every single day, sometimes twice a day. And, And now, do you like pizza now? I finally, no, not anymore. I finally got tired of eating pizza about, about a year and and a half into it. So there was a Burger King next door. And I'm like, I bet they tired eating burgers. I called Burger King. Hey, y'all tired of eating burgers? They like, yeah, I like, y'all wanna trade pizza for burger? Yeah. I finally got tired of eating burgers. So there was a Kentucky fried chicken, chicken next door to them. So I called them with the same, you know, proposition.


Yep, yep. And they was like, yep. So I'm eating fried chicken, but you know, it was like two or three others in there, you know, and I was trading out taco b taco tacos for chicken. I traded out everything for PE for pizza, and it worked out, you know. But after my last year of working with Dominoes, I think the only time I ate pizza after that was when I won the Olympia. And the reason why, because I love cheese and the first thing that came to my mind that had cheese on it was pizza. So I would eat Domino's. Well, I eat dominoes. I I, I probably hadn't eaten Domino's since I worked there.


So I called Pizza Hut, ate pizza right after the show. And, and I wanted more cheese after that. So I went to McDonald's and got a cheeseburger. Wow. So, Okay. So now you move to Arlington. You are a police officer. Yep. Are you power, are you, are you power lifting still? Nope. You are giving up power lifting? I gave and transitioned to bodybuilding. Yep. No, no, no, no. I would work out maybe, maybe once or twice a week. Okay. You know, while I was on the, in the academy. In the academy. Well, when I graduated and my first day on the job on the guy came to me, we, we were, we were on a call together. He was like, man, where you work out at?


You pretty big. I'm like, I work out at the station. He's like, oh, there ain't no weight there for you. And I'm like, you right the size of this room. No, I ain't, ain't no weight. Now. He like, what? Why don't you come to Metroflex gym? So the next day I go to Metroflex gym and the owner Brian dos said, man, you pretty big, you know, I had 22 inch arms, so I was pretty big. So You always, you always cut up bro up like that. Exactly. All my whole life. Pretty much. So everywhere I went, you know, I was the biggest and the strongest guy in the room. And actually even in college, high school, everywhere, you know. So when I went to Metroflex, Brian saw that and he's like, man, you, you got a pretty good physique there, you ought to take up bodybuilding.


I'm like, no dude, I, I can't do bodybuilding. I just got this job, the police department. And I heard those guys have to take steroids and I definitely can't die because I'm a Kentucky fried chicken, burger King eating guy, you know? And diet in ain't ain't for me. Yeah, exactly. It is not for me. Well, that, that went on for about, what, three, four days. That fourth day, Bryan finally said, I tell you what, I give you a free membership to the gym if you compete in this show coming up about three, four months. He's like, I teach you how to train as a bodybuilder. I teach you how to die. I teach you how to pole. I'm like, dude, you should have led with that free thing.


Because at the time, you know, I was struggling paying my bills and any, anything free sounded good to me. Sounded real good to me. So I'm like, yeah, I'll do it for a free membership. Right. So Brian taught me how to poll diet, you know, trained as a bodybuilder. And, and my first show was Mr. Texas. That show was April 7th, 1990. I went in, won first and overall Wow. My second show, same thing. The next week, April 14th, 1990, I went in, won first. And overall, and that continued for about a couple months, you know, and then I qualified for the national, my first year in nationals.


I got third. And it wasn't, you know, you got, you gotta get first place in order to turn pro. Correct. So I didn't turn pro that year. The next year I would go back to the Nationals and I get fourth. Damn. Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm going backwards. Same thing. I said, damn. But if you could pass the drug test, you could qualify for the universe team. And the universe. They take five guys one from each weight class and you go compete in the Mr. Universe in Catalyst, Poland. Well, the first three guys couldn't pass drug test.


Matter of fact, there were 44 guys in my class. I was the only one who showed up to take drug test. Of course I passed because I was drug free back then. And I go to the universe in Catalyst Poland, and two o'clock in the morning they waking me up, take a drug test. I'm like, man, well let's come from, I already took a drug test. Right. Well, when we got there, they brought everybody in a room, a big room. It was a gymnasium actually. And they made everybody strip down and get on the scale from everybody stripp down and getting on that scale. They picked all the guys that they thought were on steroids, of course, me being the big Yeah.


Big guy out there and ripped up. They showed me two o'clock in the morning to take a drug test. Of course, you know, I passed it and one my weight class and that qualified me to turn pro. Wow. Yep. And I also qualified for Mr. Olympia from winning. You know,

I, I never even thought about bodybuilding because one from nobody bodybuilding. Correct. I didn't even know what bodybuilding was about.


When Brian told me I could win Mr. Olympia, I'm like, what's that? He's like that, that, that's the biggest. He saw That kind, Ronnie, you go into the gym, he sees that much potential in you that you can be The, my first day, first day from day one. From day one, he, he told me that. And You all natural. All natural. So remember I had 22 inch arms without, so yeah. I still look pretty good. So I remember, 'cause I remember the photo. You had the box fade, The autopsy And, and you had the police uniform on. Yep. Yeah. So what year did you take that photo? That was 97. Nine Seven.


Yeah. Yeah. Nine seven. So you, you qualified for the Olympia, but you won to come to Pro Show. Didn't you win the Canadian Pro Show? My first pro show was Canada. Yeah. In Toronto. I won my first show in 1995. Right. And I went and won my second pro show Canada again, 1996. And the whole time, you know, I'm trying my best to get to the Olympia and I got to Olympia by qualifying and winning those pro shows. Yes. My first Olympia 1992, I didn't get a call out. I stood there on stage and had, you know, the best seat in the house.


They totally overlooked me. Right. They overlooked me so bad. They ain't call called me for no, no comparison. 1993, I didn't even qualify for the Olympic because I didn't place it in the top three in any pro show I did. I got like six, seven, somewhere down there. 1994, I finally qualified for the Mr. Olympia in 1994, still drug free. And I go in and I do Mr. Olympia and I get 15th place. Damn. So I'm moving up. Things are getting good for me. 1996, I qualified for winning the the Canada Cup.


I go in and I get 11 plays. Okay. So I'm steady moving up bho, solely bho, 1997. I'm qualified by winning the Canada Cup again. They they do, they love me in Canada. They love me and I love them. So I, that year, you know, I kind of fall back and Shannon, I, 1997 was a hard year for me. My first short year I go in Iron Man, I never did these spring, these fall shows before. And I get third place. Okay. And the guy who beat me was the guy about this tall, weighed about 190 pounds soaking wet.


And here I am, 200 and almost 40 pounds. And he beat me and I'm like, wait a minute, this ain't supposed to happen. Right. I, how can a guy that shortened and that, you know, that small, that small beat me, you know, I'm five 11, all of, I'm like, say almost 240 pounds. And the next week was the Arnold Classic. Okay. I go into Arnold Classic and Lee Priest beat me again. I I'm going by the call out, you know? Yeah. And I look, I get back to my room. I look at my girlfriend, Vicky Gates. She was a probability at the time. I just Bumped in tour.


She worked with Kirk Franklin on the Tour. Yeah. Yeah. I just saw in Callie couple months ago. And I like, Vicki, you know what, I don't need this bodybuilding thing. I got a job with the police department with benefits and everything. I like, this is my last show. And she looked at me and she said, boy, shut up. And I thought to myself, you know what, I can't quit bodybuilding because if I quit bodybuilding, I lose my free membership to the gym. All you were thinking about Was a free membership. Free membership to the gym. Because like I said, I worked hard for that free membership. I wasn't about to give it up.


Well, actually I ended up beating the priests. Okay. So I felt pretty good. Then I went to the Arnold, I mean, went to the Olympia and the year before 96 I placed seventh, but they moved me up to sixth I think because NASA failed a drug test. They was drug testing us back then. Right, right. For diuretics. So in 1997, I'm like, man, if I could just make the top five, I'll be all good. Well, I got 11th, I mean, I got ninth and I'm like, oh man, I already did this pity party thing, so that ain't gonna work.


Right. I ain't gonna quit. So I, I continue on and 1998 comes around and I qualified Mr. Olympia again and went into Canada. So you just keep going back to Canada. I keep going back to Canada every year because I, I know I got a real good chance of winning. I don't want it like four years in a row. I'm like, okay, I gotta go back to Canada again. So, Not to cut you off, Ronnie. So you're saying I got 15 place. I've got an 11th place. I've got ninth place, I've got seventh place in the Olympia and I'm totally drug free. Well, in 1995, flex Wheeler was winning.


All the shows he went to, actually it was 1994, he was winning. He won the Arnold Classic. Yep. He was on the tour. He, he was winning all the shows on the tour. And I remember when I was in college, I was always the smartest guy in my class and accounting. And, but if I wasn't the smartest, I would go study with the smartest guy to, you know, increase, increase my grade. Okay. So I'm like, I'm gonna take that same philosophy with, with with Flex. So I went to Flex Room, it was real kind, kind of late that night. And I'm like, flex man, I'm, I'm tired of getting my butt whooped in all these shows. And I hear you guys, you know, taking the juice, you know, I had to say something.


And he's like, yeah man, if you want to get up there with the big dog, you gotta do what the big dog do. Okay. So I'm like, well, what do you do? Well, flex named out a whole bunch of, you know, steroids, drugs that they take. And he said, I I got a buddy that can get everything for you. So I'm like, okay. So my first time ever having anything to do with drugs was 19 95, 19 95. And that's when I won my first pro show Canada Cup. Canada, yeah. Canada C And I'm like, okay, I guess Flexible was on, He was on to something, Huh?


Yeah. So after that I'm like, you know what? I'm tired of getting my butt. I'm, I'm, I'm just kind do what these guys do. Right. But we ran into a little problem along the way and DEA came in and, you know, they was like, what are you guys doing? What are you taking? So I'm like, well this is pretty much what I'm doing. He is like, well we gonna have to confiscate, confiscate that and you know, and take everything from you. I'm like, okay. So I went out and I, they had these clinics that you can go to and get, you know, steroids legally.


Right. Only thing you had to take these blood, blood work. Blood. Yeah. You had to get The blood done. Yeah. So I went to one of those clinics and started doing everything legally. But I had to, you know, take these blood tests and everything came out pretty much normal. So I, I was okay. So I was all right, now, you know, I could do everything legally. I ain't gotta worry about, you know, getting in trouble from doing what I was doing and from, from, from that point on. My career just took off in 1998 when I went to the Olympia of Flex was the successor. Yeah. Everybody said Flex was gonna win Because Right.


Because there was a stretch there. Lee had took it over. Lee had won eight straight Lee retired. No, No, no. It was Dor Dorian Yates. Yeah. Come in six straight. Oh, that's 14 years. Yeah. They've only had two guys to win the O. Yeah. Lee Haney, he retires after eight. Dorian Yates exactly wins six. He retires now. Flex is the natural. Everybody's like, Hey, It is all Flex is Flex Sure lose. Okay. And I, I wasn't nowhere in there because I hadn't got, ain't nowhere in the top five. Right. So it was Flex, nasa, Sean, Kevin. So in the 98 Olympia, they, that's who they, it was calling down and I'm like, oh man, here we go again.


You know, I got ninth the year before and I'm like, if I could only make the top five man, I'll be happy and satisfied because I'm really just doing this for, you know, free membership to the gym. I ain't, I ain't really thinking about winning Olympia. And that never even occurred to me. Right. Because I said, where I'm from, nobody did bodybuilding. We didn't know anything about it. Correct. Brian taught me everything I knew about bodybuilding. Well, the only thing was Flex was winning all the shows and, you know, they were, had those guys, you know, picked to win your, be the successor.


Well, flex called me on the phone one day and like, man, who you working with? I'm like, dude, I'm, I'm doing my own thing. He's like, oh man, I got this guy Chad Nichols. He, he, he could, you know, make a, yeah. He can dial you in and make a difference in, in your physique. So I called Chad. Chad didn't call me back. So I called Flex again. I flex this guy's not calling me back, man. You told me to call the guy and he was gonna help me out and he ain't calling me back. He's like, no, just keep calling. He'll call you back. So I called him again. Well, this time he called me back, you know, and I hook up with him. He changed everything I was doing. He changed my diet.


You know, I went from eating five meals a day to eating six meals a day. Okay. I went from 10 ounces to 12 ounces of protein with each meal to 16 ounces. You eating a pound of protein, a meal. I eating a pound of protein, a meal fucked up. And I'm trying everything in my power to stuff this food and it ain't working. So I'm like, man, he, he said, I gotta, I gotta eat this food to get big. So I just kept eating and eating. My body finally adjusted to it. I was finally able to, it took me about three, four months Wow.


For my body to adjust a hundred grams of protein with each meal. Ooh. We talking about a hundred grams of chicken, steak, Turkey, you know, that's all. Were you eating fish back then? No, I didn't eat fish. Okay. Chad didn't have me on fish. And I didn't really too much care for fish either. Okay. Because I eat the fish and I'd be hungry. I sure hope you had a lot of fiber in your system. Boy, you gonna be back. He, he put, he had me on all kind of fiber supplements and I was going to the bathroom after eat meal. He had five times a day. Hundred grams of protein. Yep. And, and another thing was I couldn't need five meals.


You know, with, I've worked full-time, police department. I'm working, working out. Every day I'm doing cardio. That's another thing Chad did. He increased my cardio from one hour a day to two hours a day. And I'm like, oh man, you really doing a number on me here. Right. And you know, I I I made it work. Right. And I, you know, I, like I said, I was finally able to eat that ate, eat those hundred grams of, of protein. The only thing was I couldn't get the six meals in. So Chad was like, well, you need to eat this food. You wanna get big. She said, try waking up in the middle of the night, eating me and going back to bed.


So that's what I did. I went to bed every night about four o'clock, and I would wake up four o'clock In the afternoon. No, no. Four o four O'clock in the morning. Because you working the police? Yeah, I'm working police above me. Okay. So I would get up at seven, eat a meal. Right. Go back to bed at eight. Okay. A whole hour. Well, it worked out pretty good. And they caught on and I was able to do a hour in the morning on, on the treadmill. I had right by my bed. You know, I get out bed, jump right on the treadmill. Was it fast cardio? Yep. Fast cardio. Okay. So I did that.


And then when I finished that, I would eat my first meal, go to the gym. I got there about 1230, almost one. I only worked out an hour. Okay. Each day. One hour maybe, maybe hour. 15. 15, 15 minutes at the most. Okay. I would get home about two 15, somewhere in there. I would get, take a shower, get dressed, go to work. I had to be there at three. Okay. I got there at three. And I would eat my next meal at three and get a 45 minute lunch break. So I'd eat my next meal at that lunch break. And I got off at 11 o'clock every night. So I would come home, eat another meal, take a shower and everything, and sit around, do some email, and I would eat my last meal, which was a protein shake.


I just, just drank a hundred gram protein. And I'd go to bed, like I said, around about four o'clock. And that was my whole day. Right. And that was, that was my camp. You know, I didn't go no strip clubs. I didn't go out to no clubs. I didn't go. You ain't have no time. I ain't had no time. There you go. But come to find out, flex told me, man, I went to the strip club every day. When I got out, I, my workout, they had already told me I was gonna win the Olympia. I'm like, what? You did what? And he's like, yeah, yeah. I guess what I did. I'm like, dude, I didn't go to no strip club. I didn't go nowhere.


Right. You know, with job, work, the gym back home. So Basically you're eating around, you're eating, you're eating like every three hours, every two and a half hours. Exactly. Every three hours. I'm eating a meal. Every Three hours you're eating a meal. Yep. And it's working out pretty good.

The thing going according to playing. And so 1998 Olympia roll round, everybody saying flex going in. You know, and And, we get the show. They calling out Flex nasa, Kevin, Sean. I'm like, oh man, here we go again. All I want to do is make the top five and I'll be okay. Well, somewhere along the line they started calling me out. Okay. I'm like, okay, thanks. Looking up. I might have a chance to make this top five. Right. Well, I, I can remember like it was yesterday. I'm like, you know, they, we standing there all six of us on stage and I'm like, you know, I, I don't wanna be called six.


I mean, I'm like, God, please don't let me be called six. They called out six place and it wasn't me. And I'm like, thank you Jesus. And I'm like, okay. I got fil you know, I, I've accomplished my dream. Did what I always wanted to do. Make the top five fifth place call. It wasn't me. I'm like, wait a minute now. Oh, something going on here. Fourth place call. It wasn't me. I'm like, oh man. Every time it came time for a name to be called, I'm expecting to hear my name all the way up to me and Flex standing on stage. You and Fl standing on Flex. I remember like yesterday And I knew in my heart that I was gonna get second place.


'cause they already said Flex was gonna win. Right. So I'm thinking the whole time they, they gonna call flex name for first. And I can remember like yesterday, they called our flex name for a second and I'm like, and called me out for first. I'm like, oh man, they done made a mistake. And I'm like, wait a minute. No. They wouldn't make mistake that big. And that I hit the floor. Yep. And I was out pretty much out cold. I fainted just, just like that. Wow. And only thing I remember was Vicky coming on stage and helping me get off, off that floor.


And I didn't know, I, I didn't know I what had happened. I didn't know I was down on the floor that long until I watched this tape. Flex came over and said something to me. Chris came over and said something to me. I don't, I ain't Heard you don't remember none of That. I don't remember none of that. And when I got up, I'm like, oh man, I don't, I don't want the Olympia. This is the best thing that ever happened to me in my life. I never in a million years thought I win in Olympia. I never even dreamed of winning the Olympia because I didn't think it was Possible. But Ronnie, as you're prepping for the show, like you said, okay, we know Dorian retired. Yeah. Boom. Okay. Flex, great symmetry.


Those round belly muscles. Yep. Everything. When you look at the sand down statue, that's Flex Wheel. It seems like it's flex. It seemed like Flex Wheeler. And so how's your prep? Are you looking at yourself every th every couple of weeks? Are you looking like, well damn, I'm getting a little bigger. I'm getting a little leaner. As big as I am. As lean as I am. Because you always gonna be the bigger man on stage. Yeah. Basically the only guy during that time that could challenge you for size was Nassar. Nassar. Exactly. He was the only one everybody else was gonna have to beat you with. With lines. Exactly. Peak Conditioning. Exactly. 'cause when it came to size, nobody could touch you. Nope. Nobody had that. So, But you had to be looking at yourself like, well, okay, you start to see the Christmas tree start to come in. You start to see the la when you do the rear LA Everything was coming in.


Everything coming. Yep. Yes. Everything was coming in. Only thing was, I was working with Chad Nichols and the night before the show, he had me eat so many carbs. I mean, I was eating a thousand milligrams of carbs a day. A day. So you got your carb up. Yeah. And he started that like on, on Wednesday or Thursday, I forget whatever the day was. And I was stuffing myself with food. And I felt pretty good. Right. You know, because when I was prepping for the contest, I could only eat a hundred and twenty five, a hundred fifty, grab a car, gram the carb a day.


A day. And that's like two meals. Three, three at the most. And when he put me on those thousand, man, I felt like I was in heaven. Right. I mean, it was the greatest feeling ever. Thousand milligrams of carb every single day. By the time I got to Friday, I was so stuffed, I was so full, I lost my conditioning. I'm like, oh man, I done messed up again. Oh. Rule my chance to make the top five in everything. So I'm like, call Chad. Like Chad man. I done messed up man. The biggest mistake, mistake ever. He like, I like all my conditioning is gone.


Gone. He's like, man, don't worry about that. I I got you. Right. So he come by the room, give me something kind of powder, put some water in and drink that. Okay. I like, okay man, I'm must stay up all night going to the bathroom. I woke up the next morning. I'm so nervous, I ain't looking at a mirror. I don't even see myself. And every time I got close to a mirror, I would look away. I remember backstage, I'm like, I don't wanna see how I look. 'cause I know I looked pretty bad after seeing myself last night. So I avoided all mirrors that whole entire morning.


The whole entire day. Actually, I didn't know how I looked until the pictures came out in the magazine. Wow. Yeah. Back then we didn't have camera phone. No, you didn't have camera phone. But Ronnie, you know, being backstage and I've been backstage and, and seeing you guys at the Olympia and the Arnold and, and, and, but guys know like, damn Man, Ronnie looked good. You see how big and full Ronnie look man, you see Na sir. You See. So were there not whispers going on Because I didn't hear anything. I was so, you know, focused on me and, and trying to make the top five that, I mean, when Joe Wheeler even came back there, he never said anything to me.


He's like, man, I I need you on my team. He's like, I can get you guest hosts all around the world. All you gotta do is join my team. I'm like, you want me on your team? Like, dang yo, I'm look pretty good. Like, yeah, you look real good. I'm like, yeah, whatever. This guy is just, he Just gassing you up up. He's just gassing me up. He ain't really serious about that. Come to, to find out he was serious about it. And I still didn't get it. I still didn't know how good I looked. 'cause I avoided every mirror that I came by. So like I said, when they called me for first, I lost it. I mean, I was in complete shock.


Other than working with Chad, he changing your diet. Everything I was doing Did you, your weight, your weight scheme, the sets you that you did back then, there was no such thing as time. Un attention. It seems to be the the the way to go now. Yep. That you bring the rate down. It's a three, three tempo down hole. Three tempo up. Ronnie, you lifting weights. But I notice when I look at your physique back then, and I look at the guys now, they don't seem as grainy. You used a lot of barbell. You wasn't a whole, you wasn't a machine guy. I wasn't A machine guy. You did black bench, you did heavy dumbbells. You did shoulder press. Exactly. You did t-bar. You did barbell roll. Yep. You did Iron, iron. Everything was pretty much free weight.


Yes. Yes. And I didn't, I probably did maybe one or two machines. Right. And everything was heavy. Yes. Yes. But even, even even the, like the last couple of weeks when guys are normally tapering off as far as weight, you was still lifting because it, I think you were probably like a month out when you squatted 800 a deadlift. No, I was a month out when I deadlifted at 800. Right. But when I squatted it, I was, I was probably like three months out, three months out. But I was, I was, I was a whole lot heavier too. Right. So that, that's why that 800 was so light to me. I was full of carbs. I wasn't dieting. Right. And it was super light.


I mean, I couldn't believe how light it was. So you win that Olympia in 98, you gotta be on top of the world. You're like, man, is it everything that you thought it would be If you, well it can't be because you didn't even visit yourself winning it. No, exactly. So You win that, you get back to your room and you order that Pizza Hut and you and Vicki talking. What's going through your mind, Ronnie? I'm, I'm, I'm still in shock. I, I still can't believe I won. It still hadn't hit me yet. But, you know, I'm, I'm so overjoyed. I, I'm, I'm like in another world pretty much. 'cause I can't believe I just won the Miss Olympia, the biggest bodybuilding contest in the world.


Something that I, like I said, see, I didn't even dream of it. I never even thought I had a chance, but I put in the work. You know how Yeah. Discipline us football players are. You gotta Be. And I stuck to my routine. I never, ever cheated on my diet. Nah. I didn't go out. I let him party. I didn't do anything but work on my body and, and went to work every day. That was all I did. And that happened every single contest, you know, I'm always going, you know how we are we always going to challenge ourselves? Yes. Yeah. To be the best. Right. You know, even though we are not the best, we going to challenge ourself to be the best.


And like I said, I had so much passion for it, it was the easiest thing in the world for me to go to the gym each and every single day. And then I fell in love with working for the police department also. So I had two things that I looked forward to doing each and every single day, going to the gym and going to work. I mean, I loved work working for the police department. It was so much fun. And it gave me a chance to escape being a bodybuilder. Right. You know, when I'm at work, I'm just Ronnie Coleman police officer, not Ronnie, Coleman the bodybuilding. And that's all I I'm thinking about because people are there trying to kill you.


Yeah. So I I I'm thinking about, you know, making it home my life. Yeah. I'm thinking about making it home each and every single night, but at the same time, I'm enjoying what I'm doing. I'm loving what I'm doing because every single day it was something different. It was never the same day, every single day. And that's what I look for, forward to doing something different every single day. And I had so much passion for working for the police department, I would do it for free. And in actuality, that's what happened in 2001 when they told me I could no longer work for the police department. Why you couldn't work for 'em? Because I was taking off too much.


I would take off for like three months for the Olympia every show I would do, I would take about almost maybe two months to a month sometimes. But the regular struggle show, there wasn't that much time. I didn't Yeah. But Ronnie, You weren't really doing but one show, I can only recall you do it maybe a handful of times. You did two shows of the season. You did the Arnold oh one, which, and you did the, then you did the oh in oh one. But for the most part, you didn't do for one show. One show every year. But you know, that one show was the most important thing for sure in the world to me. And I also did the European tour after. Yeah, you did The two. Yeah. Every, every single year. So Miss Olympia and then the tour.


And on the tour we had like sometimes seven shows. Right. And I would do seven shows in 11 days. And you know, that's a grind. It is. I mean, because traveling, You gonna hold water As hard when hard you fly Overseas and You on that compression. I remember, I remember this one show, this one tour. I, I was doing everything in my power to get rid of water. No matter what I did, it wouldn't come off. I'm getting fifth place, sixth place, everybody's beating me and Kevin is winning every show. So I'm like, man, how he winning all these shows and how he keep his conditioning.


So I pulled a flex weed on him. I went by his room like it was almost midnight when I got there in his room. He was still up. I'm like, man, what are you doing to win all these shows? How you keeping your conditioning? He goes over to his coffee maker, pull out his coffee maker, pulled me a cup of coffee, and then he pulled out a bottle of vodka and pour that in the coffee. I'm like, what the hell you gonna do with that? He's like, here you go. I'm like, dude, I don't drink no vodka, man. I, I can do the coffee but not the vodka. He's like, you wanted to know what I was doing?


This is what I'm doing. And, we in these shows. I'm like, okay, You can try anything. They Gave you old Conco like, okay, everything okay. I drank that coffee all, man, this ain't too bad. Gimme another cup. But you up peeing all night though. I'm up peeing all night again and I go to the show the next day and man, I win. I beat Kevin in nine. This was in 1997. So that was a pretty big deal for me. Yeah. I never in my life beat Kevin my whole time. Kevin won the 91 Men's National. That's where he turned pro at. Right. And he got second in the Olympia the next year.


So I'm thinking, Hey, you know, things looking out for me. I I, I got, got a chance to do something in this sport now. Right. So I put that all behind me and I never did that coffee and vodka thing again. Right. Plus I hooked up with Chad. He had some better than that. Right. He had some kind of powder. He would pour it in and he put it in the glass and put some water in it. Drink this. I'm like, okay. And it would have me go to the bathroom for like two hours straight every 20 minutes. Yeah. Dropping all his water and it worked pretty good. And, But, but don't you worry about Ronnie when you, when you, when you do that or flattening out because a lot of times water what's in the muscle, it gives you that full look and sometimes you could flatten out.


You, I've seen guys exactly look so good the day before the show and then get on the show. I'm like, bro, what did you do? That's why I was eating a thousand milligrams of carbs every single day. So I wouldn't flatten out and I never did them. Carbs really did a number on me. Did the trick Because it's A balance. Was going something because You cut your water. Yep. And now you've put the carbs in to pull the water that, to put the mus the water back into the mussel. Exactly. And we, it's like a science project. Really. It is. Yep. And another kick, I ain't never told nobody. It, we, we would use insulin to make it go faster.


Insulin would push it in the muscle real quick, real fast. Right. Well, you know, if you tried it without it, it, it wouldn't work as good. Right. And all of that. It worked to a TI know I was, I was big on stage, I was ripped, I was full. Yes. You know, and that's how I beat those guys. Wow. So I'm, I'm trying to figure out, okay, so what was your rep and set scheme? Yep. He had me doing like 20 reps, you know, to start out my first with that heavy ass weight. No, no, no, no. This is a warm up. Okay. I gonna say, but you do ass weight and I'm, I'm pyramiding up every ever since.


So I, I would start out at like 1, 1 35 on the bench, 20 reps put another plate on there, 15 reps. Okay. Put another plate on there, like 12, 12 reps. And my, my last weight would know with another plate would be 10 reps. So you five. Yeah. Nothing under 10. And And, if you watch me work out, I'm never locking out. No. And the reason for that is I'm trying to keep the tension on the muscles the whole time. And then when you lock out, you hurt your joints, you get a lot of joint pain. Right. And I stayed as far away from that as possible.


Okay. And people thought I was doing half reps. I'm like, no, I ain't doing no half rep. I'm doing a full rep on the muscle. Right. I ain't using my joints at all. And I never had any joint problems. Even to this day, I'm still doing 20 reps with everything. This concludes the first half of my conversation.
