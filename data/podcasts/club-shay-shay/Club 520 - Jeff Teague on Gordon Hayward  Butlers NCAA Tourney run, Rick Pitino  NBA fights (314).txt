It's a white, yeah the white has the bottle. That's literally all it is bro. With the clears. Oh bro, I'm asleep bro.

Craziest. The craziest thing I've been a part of when it came to NBA fights, my dog, Marvin Williams man love him to death. He was having a rough game and it was some back and forth confrontation between him and Sean Williams. They was arguing back and forth. Sean Williams had played for the Pacers at that time.

2:
He was playing for the Knicks I believe. Memphis legend. Yeah. And they was arguing back and forth. They ain't really fight but to know Marvin is like he got a quick switch like he can get mad quick and they was just talking shit going back and forth. And I think Sean Williams kind of pushed him. Marvin chased him down and swung on him. Damn. Yep. Damn. Oh god. Marvin Williams. You probably can find it one. It's on there. It's on the internet. I'm for sure. But he chasing him down and swung on him. And I just remember Marvin got suspended for a game or two or something and he was just like to, you gotta know Marvin. He like it ain't worth it. Aint none of this shit worth, I ain't even hit him. It ain't worth it. Like he was pissed.

2:
Yeah but he, I ain't never seen, I was like damn Marvin boy you went crazy. That's crazy. I always wanted to know what type of person he was because I was a big USA fan. Unbelievable dude.

I ain't gonna say too far but like hockey, the niggas a squabbling. You know they get straight to it. They getting it in the hockey NFL. Yeah. Here and there. But it'd be crazy in the league if they like, if they really let people kind of get to it to an extent. I know that would never happen ever, ever again. But if people get squabbles in EBA that'd be crazy. It's hard to fight a nigga at pass though. Helmets all that. You gotta do a lot of unclothing pause to to get active. For real. Yeah. You ain't about to do all that. Yeah and hockey, they just throw them helmets off. It's up. Yeah they got a lot. I got pad and shit on too though.

This is for entertainment though bro. Man I man nah, Florida is a different place and I seen my homie, I seen a nigga out. I don't know why this nigga popped up on my algorithm but that nigga put his foot on a shorty head was like I aint ever nothing. Put your foot on her neck. He good at I'm cool bro. That's, I wish you could asked this question while they were here earlier. I don't like that. I I don't like that is too much. Like I don't like the chains. I don't like none of that. That's weird. Yeah, I, I'm simple. I can see if you did that at your crib or like but walking around in public would but that's out.

2:
I'm cool. I'm just a simple nigga. I don't want all the extra, I was just asking the question. Well respect to though. Do whatever make y'all happy. Fuck yeah, love who you wanna love. However you wanna love them as long as there's consent for sure. And use Role Sparks if you need help. Yeah, for sure. Listen, shout nobody has Rose Sparks. What the fuck they got going on? Hey. Less. But shout to Rose Sparks except in use that promo code one time for the one time March Madness in March man Big 10 tournament. All the conference tournaments taking place this week. I wanna ask you this tee, obviously he was in school for two years. What was it like your freshman year like going into March and what was it like your sophomore year going to March?

2:
Because obviously different scenarios. Damn, I can't even really remember my freshman year. My freshman year. I think we, I think both years we lost first round of a CC tournaments. Damn. Yeah but I think we was like hoping to make the NCAA tournament. Okay. And we was sitting there waiting for our name to be called. I think we was like a bubble team. We ended up getting, we didn't get called and then we turned down the NIT or I don't even think we made the NITI don't. I think we didn't get called for NIT either. Damn. And we was like CBI or some other tournament and we turned it down. But I mean I ain't, wasn't really tripping. It was my freshman year I was ready to go home. Mm. Like shit we ain't make the tournament. Fuck. I was ready to go home. Yeah.

2:
And my second year obviously we were like, we knew we was making a tournament. I think we, we ended up being a five seed but we lost in the first round of the conference tournament against Maryland and they zoned us and we couldn't shoot. Basically I could but the rest of us couldn't. They zoned us. Who's on Maryland that year? Grievous Vasquez. A bunch of niggas. I ain't know. I remember Grievous GV got back. It was just grievous. That's the only one I knew. I just remember this one play bro. He was just saying somebody on my team, I ain't going to do him like that. Yeah But he like went under the free throw line was like shoot the ball, shoot it, shoot it.

2:
And Buddy didn't shoot it. Damn GV was on that type of song. Oh yeah he talked a bunch of shit. Yeah he was that nigga. Yeah he talked. I know he was car just didn't know he was vocal like that. Well he talked a bunch of shit man. Because we had beat him in a year. That's when I had dunked on buddy. I had dunked on the dude. I went baseline and dunked on this dude too. And we had beat 'em at Maryland when we got 'em in the a c tournament. They was prepared. They out. They really out coached us. We ain't, we ain't even practice against zone like Yeah we ain't had, I don't even remember we had zone offense. I dunno. But we did. I don't remember. That's funny that you can bring up a zone not to switch off the topic but I been seeing a lot more in the NBA people been going on and that shit really been working.

2:
It ain't nothing but a matchup man. You can still run all your man to man shit against it. That's the problem. When people see zone lose they fucking mind they lose they mind like oh shit they in a zone. Well shit you still gotta play an area. All you gotta do is move people to that area and they gonna match up with 'em And you can still run everything you wanna run. They just switching. Yeah. They just really man to man I fuck with the zone defense. Especially if you got a big team. Yeah that see the beautiful thing about a zone in college, it's a shot clock. NBA is a shot clock. Yeah. I mean NBA people shoot too good so you can get shout out to zone too easy. But in college you can find a team that really ain't got jumpers like that and it's a shot clock. And you got a long team like Syracuse had with Mellow on them.

2:
Yes sir. You got six eight on this wing. Six nine. Seven foot in the middle shit zone was love. Yeah. And in high school too where people can't really shoot like that. You could pack the paint if you get like a five, six point league zones is I hate the zone in college. I understand why it works. It's a a great strategy. Especially like you said per personnel. I like teams that play zone. If you press, if you press it play zone, then I'll fuck with that.

Hi, I'm Matt. And I'm Leah. And we're from the Grownup Stuff Podcast. And just in time for tax season. On this week's episode we're chatting with CPA Lisa Green Lewis about how small businesses can tackle their taxes using TurboTax business. A Forbes study mentioned that a whopping 93% of small businesses overpay their taxes and 17% of Gen Zers believed that you could write off any expense as a business expense. So can't blame them. It's really important to do your taxes right. Listen to Grownup Stuff on the iHeartRadio app, apple Podcast or wherever you get your favorite podcasts.

11:
Mm.

2:
I don't know. It just, it just depends. It, I was always a one through one type of zone nigga. I like that. I like one through one. I'm, I like pressing. I grew up in a i I played on ghetto AAU teams I guess you would say AU teams. So press So we used to press the whole time. Yeah, that's what I'm used to. But kids don't press no more. It is rare You see a team who just press the whole game. Nah, you don't really come across that too much. So kids not even trained to press like that. Like you gotta be in kids don't even wanna, you gotta be in unbelievable shape. Yeah, you gotta in definitely you gotta elite. Like even when Louisville used to press all the time. Yes sir. They was in crazy shape.

2:
You don't really see that no more. 'cause kids don't train like that no more. Hmm. And coaches can't coach like that 'cause people would be like, man, like I even said it when Louisville was like that. Like man you got them running around like crackheads. Yeah sir. It was like I have like, I remember Arkansas used to do it. It was 40 minutes of hell Yeah. They would press you the whole game. No run. But you can't do that no more. Kids be looking at you like man I ain't about to do that. Like, You know what I mean? That's too, it's too much hard work. If you had them type of kids though, would you run it though? I mean we got it or no we, because we pressed with our last game and we Yeah. You know we a press. I'm talking about where you just full out all game. Fuck it. We gonna, we on that today. Oh that's, that's me.

2:
I like to score. If you press, you make the game fast with possessions And you get more possessions and I'm trying to score 70, 80 points. I hate a game that's in the forties. I mean it's boring. That's why that's the worst. That's why I hate that we don't got no shot clock in Indiana high school basketball. They have to update that bro because they have to use shot clock. All our games be sectional championship 40 to 42. Like god damn like dribble three minutes off the clock. That shot clock come. I think niggas gonna start getting blown out too. Yeah. You'll start seeing the cream rise to the top. For real bro. That's, that's when you can really see who can play basketball. 'cause you gotta be able to create your own shot. You gotta be able to make other people better.

2:
Like if I can hold the ball for three minutes. Mm and just wait till your defense get tired and I get a chance to lay it in. Yeah. And we all clap. Yeah man. That's why we ain't got no, it is hard for kids from Indiana to transition to great basketball players in college. It take 'em a year or two. 'cause we always play in these systems where we hold the ball for a minute 30. But then you see the teams that has successful players after their first year and go look at their high school team, they scored 70 points. Like Eric Gordon, team North Central. They wasn't holding the ball. Nah, he was getting 35, 40. No, Mitchell would never, Lawrence North, they wasn't holding the ball. They trying to score when I, when I was at Pike we wasn't holding the ball. We scoring 78 points a game. Yeah.

2:
We trying to score the ball And you see them teams have success. And then not to shout out no other teams but people who hold the, You know, players more conservative when they kids go to college. Shock factor. They like damn I don't know how to create a shot. I never had to it dude slowed down, You know what I mean? I ran, we ran three minutes out the clock and did the back door. Back door. You're like, well yeah those days be gone though. Yeah. But then they don't understand why. I don't know. I'm ranting now 'cause I'm really shitty. They don't understand shit. That shit, that shit make me mad because it's like man change with the times. But anyway, now you see kids start leaving them schools and going to prep schools 'cause they like it don't translate bro.

2:
Yeah, that's true. You know what I mean? Like nah that's true. And then they like, why are the kids leaving? 'cause fuck it, we don't got a shot clock. That's literally the biggest thing though. Yeah. Like why this, why did he go to here? He don't got a shot clock. I mean you get to learn how to play basketball here And you get to learn how to, You know, strategize and like time, You know time game management and all that shit. But it is different when you got a 35 second shot clock And you trying to manage a game and now seven on the clock And you gotta go make a play. You ain't never had to do that. Yeah. And then they try to hide on tradition behind it and be like, oh well this is how it's historically played and this that man fuck all that. The game is grown bro. You handicapping the kids slowkey as well. Yeah, I remember when they ain't have, they ain't have a three point line.

2:
Game grew bro. You editor three point line. Nah. Trying to grow with the times bro. That's true because it'll be hard for a kid to go to a school to hold the ball, to go to somewhere like Kentucky and play you. They gonna be like, what the fuck are you doing man? He gonna be dribbling around and motherfucker three point stand. Yeah. They gonna be like, it's six, six seconds left. Make a play. Motherfucker gonna be looking around, get niggas. Okay. Gonna be holding up one. Run it again. Start it over like for sure. Fuck outta here. That is crazy. I'll look at that clip bro. Off the jump tip bro. They held him off for three minutes. That is crazy bro. Aw bro. Look in our game and I ain't trying to talk about our school. I'm just saying in the game I was part of.

2:
Yeah. I'm not talking about, I watched the clock say three 30, they turned the ball over at 1 0 3. Crazy. And that two minutes hurt you. This is how bad it's at two 40. I start telling people I think we might need to start fouling. Imagine that in a game. You gotta start fouling at two 40. Put people on the free line. Two just to get possessions time bro. You gotta start fouling. That's crazy bro. Yeah. Shout out to the kids though man. And then not to even I ain't sighting. I ain't sighting nobody. I'm just rambling. I'm just having a talk but, and I, I ain't the greatest coach. I'm learning. I'm trying to get better.

2:
But that don't make you a, like you don't have to. It's no pressure. If I can get a team that's good enough, I can hold, I got enough players that can dribble and make good passes. I can hold the ball and win the game. Yeah. I don't have to out coach. You don't have to out strategize you. I can literally get up six points and hold the fucking ball and just tell my guys penetrate and kick. Yeah. And I got five players that can dribble pass. I can win every game. Yeah. For people who don't know, it is only eight minutes a quarter. Yeah. So for those of you kind disconnected, if I could beat you by two every quarter, like when we get to that fourth. Yeah. That's crazy. It just not, I dunno.

2:
Scoring 10 points according in the basketball game is wicked. Yeah. That's what we really be on. It don't need to be 10 shot attempts. That's the crazier part bro. We're just watching six. I'm not talking, I'm not talking about nobody in particular. I'm not hating, but I'm saying we had 13 points at the half. Fuck no. No, I'm just saying what I'm saying. We had 13 points at the half and it was a close game. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. And that's just not realistic basketball to trans, You know what I mean? Just help the kids Indiana. Let's just change with the times bro. That's all I'm saying. Give us on Indiana, we on the way for sure. We still produce great hoopers here. You know what time it is for sure. Yeah we do.

2:
We got hoopers. I mean they cold. It's a bunch of good players but just, just help them become great players. Nah, hell yeah. Most I agree. Be him. I mean over, we here on March mad, you know what I'm saying? You a big college guy man. What's your favorite part of March? Mad. Your favorite part of March? Kicking in the 12 seeds. Beating the five seeds. That particular match took the hole. I hate this nigga. No, listen. Listen. Oh my momma bro. You was in college. One good year bro. He's out. Like I I, this is my journey forever, bro. 12 five C big upsets bro. I was always, everybody who got jobs and shit.

2:
I know y'all probably do this at work. We do the brackets and every year, like the 12 fives, that was a big, big matchup that determined a lot of people's brackets at my job. You know what I mean? It's not funny. Mike, you fucked up my brackets. I was a 12 five. Yeah. In 2000. I was 12 five. I 12 five. Yeah. So that C Cleveland State whacked my whole, You know, of the so funny bru still to this day. Fuck Rick Patino hate. Don't know my uncle like that. Nah, I'm saying it 'cause I don't care because he said that shit and I was so offended. 'cause I, I wanted to play them so bad. He was like, I don't think like, he was so arrogant with it. Like I don't think Wake Forest makes it out the first round. It's a 12 five matchup.

2:
And you, you be, you watch Cleveland State gonna win that game. And I'm like, oh, he's scared because we gonna beat they ass when we play 'em in Indiana. Yeah. Like I'm gonna give, I'm gonna get 50 on them. Like they going to play man to man, press me all that shit. I'm gonna kill y'all. Yeah. Who the fuck y'all guards? I don't remember who they guarded. They had to do nothing for number 34. I knew he was gonna guard me. Soso was there wasn't he? Yeah, he wasn't gonna guard me. He, it was number 34 was gonna guard me. Respect. I don't know who they two guard was, but he was gonna get cooked. I just remember his number was like 34. I was like, yeah, I'm gonna cook that nigga like I had them circled. Yeah. Terrance Earl, all them. Earl. We ain't worried about them. James and Fruit got them. Nah. Facts that I was like ish social shout to Earl and them though.

2:
No, they're my dogs. I, yeah. I'll fuck with E five like a motherfucker. That's my, that's my man. But I was like, nah, I ain't worried about that. I was like, whoever 34 is he gonna have a long night? I forgot the nigga name. I just remember I had circled him. I skipped everybody. I knew we was gonna be Arizona. I was waiting for Louisville because we got up for big games like that. Like Arizona. We was gonna get up for Louisville. We was gonna get up for, we was good with them. And it's fucking Cleveland State. Yeah. You jumped a gun. We did. I, that's my fault. These niggas got thunder clap next round. I was so mad. But nah, for real. I did Louisville loss too. That's the favorite part. Yeah. Outside of that bullshit. 1212 fives and then like I'm more of a fan of the Elite eight than the Final four.

2:
It'd be fire games in the Elite eight. Yeah. Can y'all go to that Louisville roster in 2000? What was that? 8, 8, 9. Yeah. Eight, nine. You right. Those elite gang. Elite eight games be crazy. It said no It man. You said 34 guard. 34. Yeah. I promise it was a 34. Just say they names bro. 33 was Andre McGee and Jerry Smith is 34. Jerry. Jerry, that's who it was. It is. I was gonna fuck Jerry Smith for pause, but like what I'm saying. Yeah. He was about to get buckets put on his head. I swear to God. I remember. I was like, that's the nigga that's gonna try to guard me. I'm gonna kill him now. Jerry Smith could hoop though. Yeah. But he was gonna get killed. I, I had him marked already. Jerry Smith could hoop.

2:

He had, he didn't have a chance. He was too little. When I seen Patty Mills, he was gonna get killed. I had Don, his name was Cole Pepper. He went to utep. He was Mark. Yep. I remember he was nice as fuck. Yeah he was. But you're getting killed. You already marked. And I was like, all right, if we play James Harden, I had James Hart marked. I was like Arizona State. I know he ain't gonna guard me but I have to do more than he do. And then we played Baylor and I had this dude named Curtis Re's Mark like I'm gonna kill you. Boom. Every they front court was nice. Yeah. But I had people Mark like he was marked.

2:
Ty Lawson was Mark. Yeah, Nolan Smith was Mark. I'm like big foot. Yeah. I was like, y'all getting shout to y y'all getting killed. I know y'all subbing in y'all. I'm killing y'all. Like y'all. Mark Tyrese Rice, shout to him. Tyree Rice. He said his, so his son fucked with me so I fucked. But Tyrese Rice was called. But he was hell yeah. But he was, he was he the game. Tyree Rice was a walking do. Oh God. He was light work. But I, my life I definitely had, he was circled on my list my sophomore year. Nah, that's respected though. 'cause you only niggas up. Only only one that I had circled that killed me that had a good game was Jack McClin. Yeah, I, but I didn't really have him circle like that. 'cause we beat Miami my freshman year so I didn't think he was that good.

2:
But I knew he was good. But he, he gave us like 35 and he hit a three in one and tap Pat Riley hand on the Runback. I said damn. He hard. He going to the league. Nah, that's hard. You know when you a kid you like, oh yeah. Oh, pat Riley just shook his hand. He going to the league. He hit a three and ran down the sideline and people know him for the fly ship and all. He was a bucket bro. He was a bucket. He got drafted. Yeah. I used to love seeing those Michigan State teams walk niggas down too. Zo was a hell of a coach. I would've loved to play Michigan. Coach of the Year. I used to niggas down bro. I only played, I played two big 10 teams. You've played against Draymond? I played two Big 10 teams college.

2:
You played IU didn't college? I played IU and I played Iowa. Where'd you play IU at Wake Forest. Okay. They was so ass boy. Yeah. Shout out to my dog Dumas. He was playing, he was starting two guard hoe. Yeah, he was starting. Yeah. That was they times. They was trash. Yeah, they was. They wasn't it We played Iowa my freshman year. They had j Kelly from here, shout Jay Kelly and they had white handles. Shout out to my guy that runs the, he run the Hornets right now. His name Jeff Peterson. That's my guy. He was starting point guard for No. Yeah. J Kelly. Boy that's a, that's a name right there. One of the best handles I ever seen in my life, bro. Handle six five. Amazing. Amazing white guard for sure. Yeah.

2:
Handles for sure. Like yeah that when Josh Mc Roberts passed that torch, it was in good hands bro. Yeah, he did his thing. Qua him. Stu Doug, my dog Danny. That was nice. Yeah, we used to beat there. Shout out to, but nah, I love March Manis bro. That's the, we beat the shit out of them. They was at, they was at Karma with Roberts left. Woo. Yeah, it was different. 30 piece. It was ugly. Yeah, they, they was, it was a special program. That was another Hold your ball. But we got a league nigga for show over here. Yeah they was, they definitely know the ball. Josh had a quadruple double against us. Yeah. On us sir. At Pinton. For sure bro. And that's why I, it's a bullshit.

2:
We be going in on our state. We, we support Indiana at the highest level we love. But, but I promise this is the only state where you have the best player in the country and they still pass Mr Basketball off to somewhere else. Yeah. Right. Other states. I remember Omari Bailey, shout out to him. That nigga won Mr. California junior and senior year. Bro, that doesn't happen in Indiana, bro. Oh no. Josh mc, robs was the number one player in the class of 2005, bro. And did not win. Mr. Bass going to Duke just because he chose could've Notre Dame number three in the draft facts just because he chose Duke over Notre Dame IU and Purdue. They gave it to Sky Walker. Luke? Yeah. They gave it to what, what was his name?

2:
Luke Zeller. Zeller Duke Zeller. Yeah. They robbed five 20 MOOC too. Yeah, they gave it to Cody. Number one point guard in the country, selected number two player in the nation. Cody Zeller, Cody Zeller, the other brothers. What? And they came up. Nah. Yeah they did On me. On me. Even though Cody Zeller was good though. Yeah, Luke was too. But when Luke hit that game winner was playing. Yeah bro. That was whooping The world don't know that. You know what I mean? We know that. Yeah. Like bro, they ain't play nobody and ain't hating Shout out to Luke. Good job bro. But y'all didn't play us solo because if I was Josh, I would, I wouldn't have grabbed the Indiana All Star Jersey song. He didn't, he didn't go. He didn't play? Nah. Oh okay.

2:
Because I don't remember after that I was done with too. He inspired me not to play. I was done with it too Josh. I, I wasn't gonna play. My dad hit me with that where, You know, father or son, we one of the first to ever do it. I said nigga, like they don't even like me. I'm like, they don't even like me. LaVar and Laso never can do that. They was me and shit. Damn. For real? Yeah, because You know I pick Wake Forest over Indiana. What's old boy? We, he coached for my boys at Center Grove now. Zach Han? Yeah. He said he got at you. That nigga ain't get at me. He was just starting before because he was, yeah, let's say, let's be honest.

2:
Oh talk your shit. He was going to Butler and he was white. Yeah, it, I ain't gonna tell my source. Shout to, You know, shout out to my family but over ran Center Grove. They, You know what I'm saying? Man, Zach had a story about t Zack had a burner in high school. He did, but in college it's quiet. When we had practice. Oh okay. They put all the guys that wasn't going to like Purdue had Purdue and IU had they little shit. Somo. Yeah, I was on the Purdue team. So it's me, Jwan, Scott, Ewan, I'm on that side. It is like Zach, Han, Matt, Howard, Eric, they all on this side.

2:
Oh, okay. We played Mike Bazookas. He was going like to DePaul. He was over. Yeah, Ben, I think maybe Ben Box on the town, I can't remember. But we ended up in Box. We playing them. Come on bro. I'm just, You know what I mean, I was too athletic fast. Like it is not even a thing bro. I'm just telling you that's the man. I'm just saying he, he could shoot but like in that environment, yeah, it's different. You can't do that bro. I was footing on shows bro. Yeah, I remember Coach James, he came to me, he was like, man, you are talented. I'll never forget that came to me. You are, you are so talented. I'm like, thanks. He was like, I I I did not know. I'm like yeah, I'm better than them.

2:
It's the truth. I'm better than him. Yeah. Nah, straight up I imed in the country. They're not on podcast shit. Like you guessing like no. My God man, I coulda with the Butler before you like no. Okay. Yeah. My, my boys play on this squad so I say respect, but I could've with the Butler before him. So, You know, respect Rash mad. We get on ball talk shit. I, I wanna get, I wanna get back outside and play. You know we get on ball and talk here. Yeah bro. Nah, but Zach, Zach was good when we was young though. When we was like eighth grade. He was, he was super nice.

2:
Shout out to Zach. Man. That's crazy. We went to go, we talked about girls fucking what the kids in the rule to clocks. That's the, that's the beauty of five 20. The real shock clocks. That's the beauty of five 20. We'd be all over the place but it's fun before we got here. We gotta talk about that, that final four with Butler me And you. That's what we was already locked in by that time. And then he come back here with Butler. He about to be like you never made to the final four. Oh damn. I remember we linked up to watching that game that to send Butler to the final four and then everybody like next week we was like, we're going to Houston on the road trip. Yeah bro. I remember that game. We, we watched the game.

2:
Everybody went to party at Butler went to my house, we watched the game in my house. Then we went to to Butler to celebrate. Yeah we got on that road, they beat Florida. I'm like damn my guy's really doing it. That was good to see like a small and that's like that school was in my neighborhood too. So that was big for the city for sure. The fact the niggas drove from Indianapolis to Houston was crazy. Yeah bro. That was fried. Man. Shout out to my guys to hop on that trip with me. But we had a good time. The fact that they ran it back to back though was even more impressive though. Crazy. Like Gordon Hayward like once he really, we was just talking about Chet putting that weight on him. Yeah. Once G Hay put that weight on him for sure he turned into a different player. For real bro. Yeah, he was good. He was legit. Unguardable. Yeah, that second year campus bro.

2:
Gordon Haywood looked like Triple H like it was, it was like, I was like oh that's what a pro looked like. Like it was crazy. Nah, Gordon came back looking like, like he was supposed to be outta there. Yeah. Yeah. But I saw that's a testament as to like why that tournament is so important And you killing because that made him a lottery pick facts like legit bro. So that's why I be telling you gotta really lock in on that college level. 'cause like Ja ran CJ McCullum. That shit is a real thing. For real bro. Yeah. You changed your life doing that. Yeah. Yeah. That's the dope part about looking at last year like DJ Burns like became a household name off that shit. Like that's what the dope part about. Marches the best team to always win, but you get that one team to just get some favorable matchups and win a couple. It changed everybody life.

2:
Yeah. It, it is really good for somebody that's like on the bubble though. Like you might could be a first round pick, you might be a second round opinion. You go perform. Yeah. Your name go. I remember Johnny Flynn. Yeah. Like before he was already like a gonna be a first rounder. But you remember that conference tournament? They went like six overtimes against Louisville. Yeah. I'll never forget my pops called me, I'm laying in the room. He like, are you watching this game? I wasn't, I'm like, yeah. He like, he just took your spot. I'm like, what? So I turned it on and they like overtime three.

2:
I'm like yeah all right. He, he nice. You know what I, I'm like he cool, he cool. I'm like I played him in high school. He cool. He like nah, nah, nah, nah. He putting on a show right now that just took him to top 10. And I'm like all Ari pops. I holler at you hung up. That nigga was gone after that guy. Nah, that nigga me was out of that one. I wanna say Johnny Flynn got drafted number four. He went five five to Minnesota right? Yeah, yeah, yeah bro. Like he, he was gone after that game. My and my pops called. He was like he he gone. Yeah. Like you gotta have a moment but y'all lose to Maryland. I'm like all right man.

2:
Yeah but you, you did a lot of damage though. Yeah But in the moments that count like you throughout the year you gonna have games like yeah everybody care about the regular season Scouts go see you. But when all of it's on the line. Yeah. Everybody watching every scout is in the building. Yeah, that's true. Every team got a scout at them games. Yeah. And you put on a show. It's like this kid he can perform when the lights is bright. Nah, for sure. But what again? But what helped you too though was like yo moment against UNC too. Yeah. Yeah. It was a big light game moment bro. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? No, I mean that game got me drafted to the Hawks. Yeah. Like we was cooking between me and Tony Douglas and shout out to Larry Drew when they was in the draft room.

2:
He like, who should we take? He like, oh what he did to Carolina. You gotta take him. And that's why I got to Atlanta. That's, but that's the gift of you going and playing in the A CC because you got opportunities even if you got lost to Cleveland State, whatever. But you still played against Yeah five All Americans top tier a motherfucker at Lehigh. They play against Colgate and shit like that. Yeah. You win your conference tournament you have to kill against Syracuse if you up against them like Yeah but if you average 25 at Colgate, you can get drafted. Most definitely. Just look at all of 'em. Davidson, Murray State, ah, Lehigh, all these schools like the talent.

2:
But you need a moment in a tournament though bro. Nah, think about, that's tough. Courtney Lee think about G Hill. True. Yeah true. Those are two notable pieces from the city. A hundred percent they made it. But you just gotta, it's harder. It is harder. Yeah. I'm not saying it's not harder, it's, it's harder but you just gotta kill. 'cause you get moments like Ja Marin played Alabama at the beginning of the year and put on a crazy fucking show. Yeah. Yeah. So people know like oh talent is there. Like you get moments to play against certain teams And you just gotta have on moments when you at a smaller school and then you just gotta kill where you at. You gotta average 23, 24. Yeah.

2:
Like I like shout to my guy Young Ryan to Conwell. Yeah Conwell. I think he made 13 all Big East this year or something like that. Shout to him. But when he was at Indiana State and it was a smaller team and he had moments on tv. Nah, true. Yeah he did. It looked crazier like and he played good this year at Xavier. It's a bigger school but it looked crazier. You know, You know it look like Yeah that's the optics is different. That's what I'm, I'm saying. So you killing, you averaging 20 or whatever you averaging during your conference play, then you get a chance to play a good team. Your confidence already high And you go for 28.

2:
It's like oh shit. He might be, he might be league ready but if you playing in the Big East And you play Georgetown, you play Anova, you playing whatever schools are, I don't even know who was good in the Big East but you playing him all the time And you only getting 13, 14. Kind of just yeah. Blended in. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It don't, it don't look the same, You know what I mean? Most definitely man. We will be tapped into March mad for sure.
