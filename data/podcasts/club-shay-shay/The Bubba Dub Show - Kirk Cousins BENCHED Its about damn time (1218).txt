I ain't got to shoot, I ain't got to hit you. I can get your ass removed from that where you was you threatening me nigga. You threatening a police officer. You would rather go out there and fight that damn canine dog than to put your hands on Bubba.


Do because you're gonna jail nigga. Do you hear me? Fuck Roger. Roger What? He at jail? He coming up for parole in my six months but he ain't gonna be able to see it 'cause I'm going right down there and testify. I mean talk again shit. I know some people stopped taking ass whooping in ninth grade. I ain't never stopped taking no ass whooping. But I'm still him. I'm still him. A lot of people wouldn't take no more ass whooping and they ain't him. So I'm gonna keep taking these ass whoopings. Each and every day a life starts to curve ball each and every day.


Every day I wake up I thank the heavenly follow above for waking me up. 'cause you could have called me home even though I might have a headache or a stomach ache or whatever it is. I'm gonna make a good day out this shit. I'm no longer letting people ruin my day. I'm no longer letting people with bad energy ruin the moment for me. I'm not doing that no damn more either You on the right side or you on the wrong side. I'm gonna be on the right side. Wrong side. I don't belong over God. I don't talk to it. I don't let it touch me. I don't let it get nowhere near me anymore. So if anybody out there is watching this show and got bad feelings and bad tint towards me, you take it up with God, baby, I'm here because of God.


Baby. You here because of God, baby. Don't let 'em say, let 'em say what they want to say. They talked about God. They talked about Jesus, but it didn't stop nothing. We all here for a reason no matter what He lives. We all here for a reason and why I'm on this earth. I'm on love. I'm on love man. No hate. No hate over here. Thank y'all for watching The Bubba Dub Show. I appreciate the dub. My supervisor ain't hit me back. Put that back up there. Dub my supervisor. What? Put it back up to my fam playing. Was talking about something. Dub my supervisor ain't hit me back since I called out Friday. What that mean? Five.


That's what it means. Five. Better stop calling out man. He better get back to work. Peace blessing him out. The Volume
