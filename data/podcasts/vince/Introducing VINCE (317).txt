Hey, Bonino Army. VINCE Collinase is here, host of VINCE, and if you're listening to this, it's probably because you have been following Dan Bonino, my good friend, and now the deputy director of the FBI. Dan has entrusted me with this very important job of talking to you, and as a result, we will be launching the new show right here on this page tomorrow, March 17th, and I cannot wait to see you there. 10 o'clock in the morning, we'll start on Rumble, and then it will be available as a podcast, as always, all around the planet. We'll be talking about the news in a way you haven't heard before with incredible guests sitting down for in-depth interviews. The very first one, my very good friend, Tucker Carlson, will join us for a very long and interesting in-depth interview. I hope to see all of you there. Again, rumble.com/ VINCE, we're live at 10:00 AM Eastern and of course, on demand at any time. After that, the big show is almost a year, and I'll talk to you then.
