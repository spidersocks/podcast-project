But I don't know how else to describe what happened last night. Donald Trump says United States is gonna take over Gaza, which would, when he said it, I'm sitting up there in the chair in my office watching it and it was one of those, the ex-Air thing. So Eileen, I almost fell off the chair. I'm like, did he just say that it would only be the biggest public policy pronouncement about Middle East foreign policy?

Alright fellas, ring that bell. Very nice hands. I know there's so many hands, everybody's doing so many different things here. So we, we we'll move, by the way, a new studio opening soon, which is awesome. You gotta see it. It looks freaking amazing. Just putting the final finishing touches. Hoping to get you guys in there. So last night, like many of you, I'm sitting at my, my, my office. I'm watching Fox News. Benjamin Netanyahu, prime Minister of Israel, of course is giving a press conference with Donald Trump in the White House. And Donald Trump, rather matter of factly drops the biggest public policy foreign policy announcement in modern US history about Israel.

0:
He says, you know, let me just, let's some what he said. I mean this happened. Play the cut if you would.

2:
We'll take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site. Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings. Level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different. Just can't go back. If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.

0:
Ladies and gentlemen, Q, automatic media, liberal progressive meltdown. People were losing their minds. Nobody knew what to do. Folks in the chat, how many of you were watching it live and responded How I did? He said that so matter of factly and there was, if you're gonna make a major foreign policy announcement, typically what they do in the past is they tee it up, you know, tune in at eight, whatever, big announcement. Nobody said anything. This thing was delayed for I think an hour and 37 minutes or something like that. And now I think, you know why? Here's what I think happened. He's sitting there in the Oval Office with Netanyahu.

0:
He's obviously telling Netanyahu he's gonna say this and Netanyahu's gotta be looking at him like, what you gonna say that Now he are you right Ge? Like he probably laughed the first time. I'm like, no, really? Like is this real Q Media meltdown? Immediately everyone lost their minds folks. Joy Reed didn't even know what to say. They were on M-S-N-B-C. Like, is this real? Do we react? Are we being played? Listen to me. Okay, I'm gonna help everyone out here. I can't say this enough to media people who constantly misinterpret and overreact this guy, this is the largest MAGA show out there, period.

0:
We're always ahead of it. We always drop Ws because we don't overreact. And we know Donald Trump's debating and negotiating strategy. What is it? He does this all the time, folks. He drops a bomb maximalist position. In other words, one to a hundred. He drops 99.6. He's actually thinking 55.7. But he understands that even though he's thinking 55.7, that if he drops freaking 99.6 and he gets 75.2, he's about 20 points ahead of where he was at 55.6 about.

0:
You get it? He does this all the time. 25% tariffs on Canada. Okay, we're gonna shut the fender off, okay? We delight him. He does it all the time. How many times are you guys gonna get played? Holy shit. Watching the media overreact is freaking hilarious every time. What do you think he's doing? You think he's gonna drop the hundred first Airborne into Gaza tomorrow? I'm sorry man. It's just comical watching these people after now four years and two weeks of Trump, the 2016 term and two weeks so far that this, he does this over and over and you guy and he Dr.

0:
And he always drops Ws to Abraham Accords. And people think it, they just keep falling for it. I'm sorry I didn't finish my thought before. I've been so excited about today's show because I just, I feel like if people would just watch this show, they would stop overreacting and have a better lick their finger feel for politics where the wind is blowing. My gosh, did you guys respond like I did last night? I was telling the boys this morning when I came in, I hear this thing and it was like he said it so matter of factly, I had to like rewind the thing. And I'm like, did he just say what I think he said that the us gonna take over Gaza.

0:
And I think the media was so surprised if you guys missed it. The first question wasn't even about this major foreign policy statement prescription he put out. The first question was totally unrelated. And then Kelly O'Donnell from NBC, who's no friend of ours by the way, but I think was the first one who got it, basically grabs the mic and is like, did you say we're gonna take over Gaza? Like she was the first one, I think who caught it folks? He stakes out a maximalist position. Here's what's going on in Donald Trump's head. And I want you to think about this in context of the Abraham Accords.

0:
We don't cover a ton of foreign policy on this show. This is important. 'cause it's not just about foreign policy, it's about you are, this is going to happen for four years. The Trump people I know have assured me and other people that the pace of change is not slowing down. This isn't a two week thing, this is a four year thing. So you better get used to it. And if you're not watching this show and you're gonna overreact to every single thing, your freaking blood pressure is gonna be through the roof and your pulse rate is gonna be 122 at rest. Everybody chill. Not you out there. You guys are awesome. You get it to the crazies.

0:
I saw Jonah Goldberger on Twitter. Things are getting dumber. No, you are getting dumber because you keep getting played. Here's what's going on. Think about it in context of the Abraham Accords. You know what, can you guys pull this? I'm sorry, I don't. I'm s Michael. Look this up. John Carey. There's a clip of him saying that there will be no solution to the, to the, the peace in the Arab world without fixing the Palestinian problem. Do you have to understand with the Abraham Accords, Donald Trump, who does listen to me, everyone clearly, everyone put the horse blinkers on right now. Donald Trump does not give a shit about how you did things in the past.

0:
Let me say that again. He doesn't give a shit. All he cares about is fixing problems. When the Abraham Accords came around, where we had the, the Bahrain deal and the other deals over there, you know, fly with the air traffic and everything, they were, they were great deals. Everyone told him, do not bother. You will never get any kind of a peace or cooperation deal. However you wanna frame it with Middle Eastern countries until you solve the Palestinian problem. Everybody said that up. If we can find the John Kerry thing, I'll play. But folks, it wasn't just Lurch John Kerry, everybody said that.

0:
Gee, did everybody not say that you don't fix the Palestinian problem. Don't bother Donald Trump's like, why? I'm just gonna cut a deal and I'm not, I don't buy any of that shit. And you know what he did? And everybody thought he was crazy. Hold Joe, keep hold that. Hold that thought. You can't do that. You're never gonna cut a deal. Abraham Accords ain't gonna happen. Fix the Palestinian problem. No, that's gonna, we'll fix that later. I'm doing this first. What did Dale, what else did they tell him? Remember when he moved the embassy to Jerusalem? What did they say? World War three, it's gonna be over. Arab world will never accept it.

0:
The whole place will get nuked. Did that happen? No, it didn't. Did it send me the send me the World War III articles you have that happened in the mid, oh, they didn't happen. It didn't happen. World War III didn't break out until Trump left office and October 7th happened when he wasn't in office. Everything, these foreign policy experts, this is important, man, listen to this. You dumb ass media morons ons everything. The foreign policy intelligentsia has told Donald Trump about the Middle East has turned out to be bullshit.

0:
How does this apply to yesterday? Did everybody freaking out gonna occupy the Gaza, the Middle East, get

3:
Jail chill.

0:
Donald Trump is looking at Gaza, this little strip of land, tiny little strip of land, and Donald Trump this waterfront beautiful property that was, by the way, only handed over not that long ago to the Palestinian. So anyone telling you, oh my gosh, the Palestinian's been there forever, is full of shit. What was it? 2005. They handed it over 2005, not 1905. So let's not pretend this is some generational thing, okay? That's just the hard facts. You don't have to believe it. I don't care. It's your reality. Donald Trump's been told, Hey man, the foreign policy intelligence, he said, you gotta let the Palestinians and the Israelis work this thing out.

0:
Eventually they'll figure it out. And Donald Trump's like, but they haven't. But they haven't. The Israelis gave the land back to the Palestinians who then used the land to bomb Israel. Whatever side you're on, you know where I stand on this. I've been very clear about my position about who the good guy and bad guy is in this fight. Wherever you stand. Can we both agree that's true? Did it happen or did it not? End of story in the chat. I don't, I don't, I don't care how you feel. Just can we agree on the facts, Israel, whatever they gave them back the land, did it happen? Okay. Yes. Thank you. What happened?

0:
Attacks were then launched into Israel. Whatever position you have that happened Trump's like clearly no one's fixing it. So here's what he said. He probably walked into Netanyahu, probably totally blindsided him and said, Hey, I'm I, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm really language alert. I'm sorry, I'm really, but it's important here. 'cause he, this is probably the language used, so I don't mean this for effect. I can almost guarantee you he walked in there, in there and said something to this effect and probably use the language shoot. He said, guys, you guys fucked this place up. I'm gonna unfuck this right now. I'm coming in there, the the with the big stick and I'm gonna fix this place if I gotta develop the damn thing myself.

0:
If you guys don't unscrew it, I'm telling you that's what happened. Believe you can believe it or you can laugh. I've been right about everything. You media people are always wrong here. You doubt me. Here's political playbook. I mean, these are like outright communists over a politico this morning. They talked to some off the record guy, the official argued. It's in the interest of other Arab powers like Saudi Arabia to find a solution to the conflict. Binos, right? Again, Thank you. And that Trump throwing his ideas out there might inspire others to counter as the source said himself. We'll see, somebody gets it. Whoever Politico spoke to, shockingly, even a blind squirrel gets a n is one Hundred percent correct.

0:
He's telling the Saudis, he's telling UAE. He's telling the Kuwaiti's, the Jordanians. He's telling everyone in the region, you guys have not un this problem in a hundred years. Fix it. Or I'm coming in there to Do it. A couple other thoughts here. Trump is tired of the perma war, okay? The permanent war status of the Middle East. Israel, Palestinians, Israel, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Israel, Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Israel, the Golan.

0:
He's tired of it. He is the commander in chief of the most powerful military force in the cosmos. He's tired of it. He's telling them, UNF, this situation, or I'm telling you we're gonna go and take it. He doesn't want the perma war anymore. So for those of you out there saying, and by the way, I don't blindly defend anyone, and I hope you understand that President Trump and I have a lot of agreements on a lot of issues. That's why I support him. We don't agree on everything. But don't tell me this guy's a war monger. He's doing the exact opposite.

0:
He's tired of this situation. Perma war's over. He's saying, number two, fix it or I will. Third, he is trying to refocus the hama, demon savages who just continuously go to the table and renegotiate on terror. We'll release a hostage. Ah, we change our mind. It'll be tomorrow. Oh, it'll be the next day. Oh, we're gonna hold a few more now. He's like, okay, I'll tell you what, you guys attacked on October 7th and you thought you were gonna establish like some new Hamas level caliphate in the area and Israel was gonna be wiped out and abandoned.

0:
Trump's like he's telling both sides. You guys better work this out because Hamas now you will have nothing. You will have absolutely nothing. I will take everything from you. He is telling these Hamas clowns, you better get out. We gave you a shot, you effed it up, it's time to go or you will have nothing. We will take everything from you. He is also trying to refocus the Arab world. He has repeatedly asked the Arab world, who claimed to be for the Palestinians, why won't you take the Palestinians in?

0:
Remember from, what is it, 48 to 67, who controlled the West Bank, that area? Judea and Samaria. The Jordanians. Why didn't they create a Palestinian state? Has anybody asked that question? Anyone? Jordan, no. We don't wanna take in Palestinians. You, you're the ones advocating for the go. Take them in Egypt's the same way Egypt closing Philadelphia. No, no, no, don't come here. Well, you gotta really take care of the Palestinians, so take them in. You got a whole shit ton of land. Oh, we don't want to. Trump says you don't want to. I'm emptying the place out.

0:
We're gonna clean it out. Clean up the ordinance we're gonna get. By the way, I, he didn't, there's no, I don't want any taxpayer dollars paying for this. There's got, this has to be a regional thing. All you people say you wanna help the Palestinians. Here's my opening offer. I'm clearing everybody out of there. You are all gonna put in billions of dollars. You are gonna rebuild the place and then you can move the Palestinians and others back in. There you go. Here's your, what's your counter offer? Do you not see what's going on? He's sick of a Perma war man. Stop falling for every single Maximalist position. By the way, I'm gonna get to this in a second.

0:
Gotta take a quick break. As you can tell, I came in today, fired up for this show for obvious reasons. Something came out yesterday with the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency. Almost the entire workforce was offered a buyout. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not so sure these two stories are unrelated. I'll show you what I mean in a minute. Really speculating a bit to be fair. But we haven't been wrong about anything. Not lately, not in a long time.

All right, back to the show man. I'm sorry, what's that? Got John. Oh, you got the John Kerry thing? Okay, I'm, I'm not sure if you're gonna hear this anywhere else. You may. I'm pretty sure we're gonna be first on this, but let me play, you know, let me do this. Lemme play John Kerry first. There is a story that broke yesterday about CIA officials and employees being offered buyouts like a lot of them. And of course the media freaked out again, what's Trump trying to do? This is crazy. Why would we getting to CIA, why would be looking to get rid of some of these old school people? I mean, they've been right about everything. Winky, Winky, Nona. I wanna play this John Kerry clip and I'll explain why I think these stories are related.

0:
Here is John Kerry speaking, by the way, for old school swampy Republicans too, who always said this, you will not do anything in the Middle East until you solve the Palestinian problem. Trump said, eh, I'll try anyway, check this out. I can tell

4:
You that reaffirmed, even in the last week, as I have talked to leaders of the Arab community, there will be no advance and separate piece with the Arab world without the Palestinian process and Palestinian peace. Everybody needs to understand that. That is a hard reality.

0:
Where is he? He is at the Brookings Institute where a lot of the people involved in the Russia collusion hoax worked. You starting to put two and two together folks, I'm gonna say something here that may be mildly controversial, but we don't really care. Do he? Having the 2020 election stolen from us was a horrible thing. But I think Donald Trump has turned that into a huge w How? No, I'm dead serious. I am as serious as a freaking stroke right now. 2016 was a warmup. I think the Trump team themselves would admit to you, they were blindsided by the deep state reaction.

0:
I really would. They came in Trump's 20. He did a lot. The first term was great. The tax cuts Supreme Court justices, the Abraham Accords. We got a ton done regulatory reform. No doubt, no zero doubt about that. We got it done in spite of a massive deep state reaction. Follow me here. But it was unquestionably a warmup. They figured out after that four years exactly the levers of power and how to manipulate them in the right way. And they understood where the pushback was gonna come. They knew where the little holes in the chain mail were in the armor, right? 2020 stolen. They do all of this stuff that gins up public support against the Democrats, stoke inflation and open border.

0:
What could have been an apocalyptic moment for the United States where we may not have survived? Donald Trump comes back, rescues the country in an electoral route. Every single swing state takes back the Senate. Really the the control of the Supreme Court takes back the wins the house. Donald Trump comes in with a vengeance, with an FAFO attitude and says now whatever, every single hole in the armor, in the little chain mail we saw in the front, we are gonna exploit now. And now he is on a war path. How does this relate to this story? He is tired of the intelligence community lying about the collusion hoax about the Hunter Biden laptop, about there's never gonna be a solution to the Middle East.

0:
Mr. President just sit down and shut up like every other Republican and Democrat. So you know what he said? If you guys can't provide freaking intelligence, then get the hell outta here and I'll Do it myself. You wanna see what happened? Play the clip from Jesse Waters show last night. I this, these stories are one Hundred percent related. You guys, he's saying to a lot of these and to not every single one of 'em, but to some intelligence folks out there who go, you guys have f this thing up. I've given you a shot. It's Trump time. Now watch this.

5:
CIA has reportedly just offered a buyout to its entire workforce. Everyone in the agencies telling employees late today they can quit their jobs and receive about eight months of pay and benefits. It's a part of Trump's push to downsize the federal government

0:
Folks. The stories are, I'm absolutely certain the stories are related. He, when I, you know, obviously again we use humor a lot and sarcasm to keep the show entertaining. But this is not an entertainment show. It's, I hopefully it's educational entertainment, okay? He's not kidding around. The FAFO presidency is one Hundred percent a real thing. He has turned the 2020 thievery into the biggest W of all time and we're only two weeks in. And I have been assured by people in the know that this is not gonna stop. You have four years. So I'm asking you this as I kind of get, 'cause there's a, I got a ton of other stuff to get to U-S-A-I-D, what's happening at the border?

0:
The the winning is just, I, I'm serious. The winning is so overwhelming. These guys are telling you we're not even, you don't wanna see where we are in the show. Where are we in the show guys? Elements? We're not into the first element. This stuff was added this morning. Look, that's my actual, I don't know if you can see that. I had to add all this stuff at the top. The first line of the show we haven't even gotten to yet. I'm dead serious. They know I can't even cover all the winning. He is not kidding around. So I'm just asking you this. Do not, oh that hurt my knee. Oh gosh, I like moved at the wrong angle. I'm just asking you this. Please don't overreact to every single thing I know that I know I'm, I know that doesn't apply to you but to people who are new here, you know the political normie crowd out there who hasn't been following this like we have forever.

0:
This is how Trump negotiates. He drops a PR maximalist bomb at a hundred. He's expecting a 50 but he knows if he drops a hundred that fifty's the floor and he may get 75. He does it all the time. He's not invading Gaza tomorrow. I promise you on my reputation, he is not dropping that a marine unit, unit expeditionary unit in de Gaza tomorrow. He's waiting for a counter offer and if he doesn't then we'll have to reset the argument.

0:
Everybody cool My explanation, sorry I'm following the chat because the chat is absolutely on fire today. I knew, I know I gotta get to the spot, but I'm telling you man, I'm watching this presser last night. I had no idea by the way, you know Donald Trump doesn't call me and tell me what he's gonna talk about it. I had no idea. I'm telling you, I almost fell off the chair. I'm not being silly or hyperbolic about it. I almost fell off the chair. I was like, I gotta catch myself. I'm like, did he just say that? Alright, quick break and the W's are coming in left and right.

0:
I haven't even gotten to my immigration story yet. This sheet is a mess. I can barely read it right like a doctor. I wish I don like one.

Okay, back to the show. So folks, the Ws are coming in left and right. The winning is so much and so voluminous that the left doesn't know how to respond. You know, self praise stinks, but I don't really care at this point. I told you after the election in November when we won every single swing state that the next day that they were gonna do the rock and sock and robots, okay is you got the Trump face on. It's still not broken by the way. I told you that was gonna happen. If you talk to people on the inside of the Trump orbit, they said this is it. We learned from the first term we are not going to stop. We are gonna hit them with everything all at once.

0:
And they don't know how to respond. And that's why you see this chaos on the left and you're seeing all these Ws. Bill Eugen Fox, look at this tweet a this guy covers immigration really well. Again, the lowest number of recorded illegal crossings he's ever seen. Folks, it's only been two weeks, 446 across the southern border. 4 46 he notes. That's unheard of. There were 11,000 plus in one day during Biden in December of 2023, Biden's final week of office. Remember where they were bragging about the border 'cause they were flying. Everyone in was still 12 to 1400 a day. Moja notes basically, we haven't even passed any legislation yet.

0:
This was all done by executive action that I'd like to note. Joe Biden said what he couldn't do 'cause he's full of crap folks. The deportation flights have begun to gimo as well. You come here, you break the law, you become a hardcore criminal and in the country illegally, you are not gonna find your ass here. You're gonna find your ass over in Guantanamo Bay. You don't like it. There's an easy way to not be in Guantanamo Bay. Don't enter the United States illegally. You doubt me. Here it is from the administration themselves. Check this out.

Is not messing around. And he's no longer going to allow America to be a dumping ground for illegal criminals from nations all over this world. And so El Salvador has not just agreed to, to the repatriation of their own citizens, but also illegal criminals from other nations who will then be sent to their prisons. Venezuela as well has agreed to repatriation flights. And Columbia also agreed to cooperate with the repatriation of illegal Columbian nationals that we have found in the interior of our country. And I can also confirm that today, the first flight from the United States to Guantanamo Bay with illegal migrants are underway.

Now, before I get to my next video here, Tom Holman, which is great governor Phil Murphy, liberal communists from New Jersey. Thought he was gonna play around, eh, I think we're harboring it illegal. Tom Holman's. Like really? We're gonna come check that out. All of a sudden, Phil Murphy, governor of New Jersey's changing his mind. Before I get to that, I wanna get big picture again. Pull yourself out. Bird's eye view here. Tie this back to the Trump negotiating strategy I opened up With in the beginning of the show. Trump's negotiating strategy, which has been led to a series of wins we have not seen in a two week period, I think ever is based on him dropping the maximalist position from the start.

0:
You don't wanna unscrew the Middle East, we're coming in, we'll fix it for you. Okay? How does that tie to this? Because the thing about Trump's debating strategy and negotiating, negotiating strategy, excuse me, is a maximalist position only works. Follow me here is if sometimes you mean it because they don't know if he, if you're always bluffing, no one's ever gonna do anything correct. So when Trump takes a maximalist position and gets no results from say Democrats, sometimes you gotta follow through. How does that relate to this story?

0:
When Trump originally brought up the Gimo idea, I'm telling you there are people on the left like, ah, take 'em. You know, seriously. But not literally. He's not gonna actually send people to Gitmo. Oh no, he's, they're going, no, it's, it's happening. Do you get what I'm saying? The reason his Maximalist positions work is because the Arab world, Mexico, Canada, they're like, wait, is he really gonna do that? If it's not believable, nobody would respond. So be cautious too about going, oh, oh, he's bluffing, he's not bluffing. He's taking a maximalist position that if he doesn't get results, you may see and it'll be a different show.

0:
Here's another one folks. Cutesy time is over. I don't know how many times I gotta say this. This guy is not messing around. You are gonna get your ass kicked if you are an Antit Trumper for the next four years. If you don't understand, he's not kidding. He's the president. You have one way to get rid of him impeachment and you don't have the numbers. I'll get to that story tomorrow. By the way, it's already in the works by the left of course. Like I said, here's Tom Holman. Our borders are who's been a gift to this country. What a patriot. Talking about the New Jersey governor saying eh, you know what? We're harboring an illegal or something like that. And holman's like really folks, they're not kidding.

0:
Check this out.

7:
Let me read a headline to you. Chicago leaders encourage residents to exercise their rights in resisting Trump's deportation policies. The governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, basically admitted that he knew somebody that wa didn't have full documentation that he was hiding over his garage.

8:
But there's someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to. And we said, you know what? Let's have her live at our house above our garage and, and good luck to the feds coming in to, to try to get her

7:
Your comment on all of that.

9:
I think the government's pretty foolish saying what he said. 'cause I gotten out of it. Won't let it go. We'll look into it. And if he's knowingly, knowingly harboring, concealing and illegal alien, that's a violation of Title eight. United States Code 1324, I will seek prosecution or the secretary will seek prosecution.

0:
Folks cutesy time is freaking over. He's not kidding. I don't know what the governor thinks he's doing. The, when you are the governor of a major state, you are not immune from federal law. The Democrats just made a huge argument about Donald Trump should be locked up for actual official acts. Governor Murphy appeared to just admit to committing a crime completely outside his job scope on a public interview. That's how stupid they are. But again, the Maximus position, 'cause Homan and Donald Trump are obviously working.

0:
If you just committed a crime, they're gonna investigate. If you think he's kidding, good luck. I dunno how many times you guys are gonna get burned by this folks, there is big money for the left in illegal immigration. I've already told you how they use the demographics of illegal immigration. 'cause they talk about it all the time. Just putting a search engine Democrats, demographic destiny, you'll see a thousand soundbites. They use illegal immigration to keep their moat voting power and their populations high in blue states so they can keep their members of Congress and maintain electoral college power. But there's another reason they love illegal immigration too. And the other one is there's huge money in it for left wing NGOs that then go out and gin up support for Democrats as they're taking money from the government for illegal immigration.

0:
Do you see this clip? These numbers are staggering. There are big, big dollars to be made if you support an open border. You wanna know why people love illegal immigration? Follow the money bro. Watch this. Well, I'd

10:
Like to ask Mr. Carroll and anybody else who would like to answer this. Can you name some of these NGOs that have specifically taken these hundreds of millions of dollars and not used it to protect these children?

11:
Catholic Charities, Lutheran Family Services, Jewish Family Services. I had spoke to a gentleman that works in DH s. He actually sends the electronic fund transfers and I asked him, sir, tell me who you, who do you send? Who? Who are you responsible for and how much is the largest check you cut? He said, I'm over Jewish Family Services and I cut a check for $600 million. And I said, is that for like three years? And he told me, JJ, get in the game. That's two or three months and it's renewable. That's one NGO. And I say, well, Catholic Charities is bigger than Jewish Family Services. Yes, they get the same. They get the same or more.

0:
I don't care what your religion is if you're breaking the law, I, I'm a Christian. I I would never support a group that said Christians for illegal immigration. Folks, there's big money in this. And to the opponents of Donald Trump. He is not kidding. There is a reason he's got Doge in there. There's a reason he's got Elon in there. Cutesy time has absolutely come to an end. Pete Hegseth secretary, Pete Hegseth was down at the border Secretary of Defense as well. They have now effectively moved military assets to the border because they are telling you and they're warning you the freaking borders close. Bro, you think we're kidding? You're going to find yourself in a prison or in Guantanamo Bay.

0:
Do not test us. Here was Pete Hanks said, this is quick, but the secretary was down there at the border, was talking to a bunch of our military officials here. And this is what we need. This is why the recruiting numbers just two weeks in have spiked to highs we haven't seen in 15 years for our military. Thank you to all the wonderful patriots who have signed up. We love you. Here's Secretary Hazen. We are war fighters. That's what we do. It's not a freaking social justice experiment. Our military watch this,

12:
It's real basic. It's real straightforward. We are war fighters. We train to be legal, we train to prepare for and fight orders of our nation requires us to do so. Full stop. End of sentence

0:
Folks. Have you ever seen such a transformation like this between the border, between the military, between Elon and Doge and the gutting of government agencies that have worked against our interest for years? Have you ever seen anything like this? I'm telling you, it reminds me that movie Seven, remember, remember when they're trying to find a serial killer, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and he whispers in his ear, have you ever seen anything like this? Folks, I knew Donald Trump was coming into office to shake things up. So do many of you. You know, I knew the rock and sock was coming, but I gotta tell you honestly, I this is far surpassed my expectations.

0:
He's not kidding around. And he's hit them with so many different fronts. They don't know what to do. Now, yesterday I said it's his most important fight. Yet this fight with U-S-A-I-D and I'm sticking to that U-S-A-I-D, not USA, don't fall for the scam. It is not an aid organization. It is a deep state slush fund screwing over America. The left has chosen this fight, at least for yesterday until the Gaza thing happened last night. They have chosen this fight to meltdown over because they realize if they don't have the deep state funding a censorship operation. And by the way, Chris from Rumble, Chris Pavlovsky, the CEO of Rumble, he tweeted out this morning, so let me get this straight U-S-A-I-D.

0:
Did you see the story that broke this morning? U-S-A-I-D was funding left wing media outlets in the United States to the tune of millions of dollars that then went on and attacked Elon Musk and Rumble. Chris tweeted that out. And then Elon wrote like agreed like look at this. Do you understand your tax dollars are being used to censor you? That's why the left is freaking out. They have to censor you or else left is stupidity will be exposed as you expose it. You are the media now. So the meltdown continues. It was a deep state slush fund, U-A-I-U-S-A-I-D and it was a jobs program. Now you're starting to realize, is this starting to make sense to you?

0:
Folks in the chat, man, pay attention. This is really important. Okay? Do you understand? Everything I've told you is now kind of coming to fruition here. Everything the left does is fake. Their media model is fake funded by your taxpayer dollars and bs. Their elections fake their base, fake their media audience fake their issues, fake everything the left stands for is fake. Trump is exposed all of it in two weeks. That's why you see this last night.

0:
Joy re at the end of this claim later on that this is a coup, this battle against U-S-A-I-D. She of course is the gold medal winner in our dopey media talking head Olympics. This expect these meltdowns to continue as they realize they can't censor us, at least with our own money anymore. Watch this.

13:
We begin tonight with a full on crisis in our democracy as federal workers are literally locked out of their offices while operatives working for a private citizen essentially take over our government, their tactics in their tactics include turning off our federal websites, deleting government funded research that you, the taxpayer paid for to impose speech codes, bullying news organizations by demanding interview transcripts, enter implementing an FBI purge locking federal workers out of their computers and even turning them away at their offices while giving themselves without congressional or any other authorization, full access to the personal data of tens of millions of Americans.

0:
The personal data of tens of you mean like the OPM hack that happened under Obama or the hack of our infrastructure system under Biden. So you've got an American citizen, by the way, subject to the same rules everyone else are doing nothing illegal going in and looking at payment systems that have paid off terrorists. Everyone else and Joy Reed's freaking out about it. Why? Because when the money dries up, so does the censorship and then idiots like Joy Reed, if they can't censor, you are forced to defend their own stupidity. That's why they're freaking out. Have you ever seen anything like this? I know you haven't 'cause I'm 50, so I'm gonna guess 50 years old that about half my audience is above and below my age.

0:
I have never, ever in my 50 years in this planet seen anything like the last two weeks ever. I don't know how I'm gonna recover from this show after four years. I'm gonna have to start blood pressure medication. Here's A-U-S-A-I-D employee. This is an A BC segment talking about how Elon and his and his crew of the mini brainiacs came in to look at the U-S-A-I-D system and all of a sudden they started putting away the pride flags and all of a sudden it's a workplace. It's not an activist zone. You wanna put all that stuff up, fine. You have these beliefs, fine.

0:
Put 'em up in your own house. It's a constitutional republic. Notice how that's the first thing they focus on in their government jobs. By the way, check this out. It was late

14:
Last week that the Doge team showed up at U-S-A-I-D offices in Washington and demanded access U-S-A-I-D employee. Christina Dry described the scene. Doge

15:
Was in the building. We started, we took down our pride flags. We took down, I took out any books I felt would be incriminating. No one was talking. We heard they started taking transcripts automatically of all of our Google meets. We, they unplugged the news in the little kitchen galleys. It didn't feel good. And then Saturday, all of the websites went down and then I lost complete access to my computer.

0:
Notice the sense of entitlement with these employees as if that this job is somehow their own personal business, not a taxpayer funded enterprise has been working against us. Interest, ladies and gentlemen, U-S-A-I-D is a huge deal. It is the biggest fight right now. That's why always measure the effectiveness of what you're doing by your opponent's response. They are freaking out at about a level eight and a half outta 10 because when the money trained to all these left-wing organizations dries up, then they stop gin up voter support, they stopped knocking on doors for Democrats. If you're like, oh, it's only $40 billion their budget.

0:
You have any idea folks? The Donald Trump presidential campaign was about a billion dollars. Can you imagine what $40 billion will do? It's a huge deal. This is a great clip. It's a little long, but I wanna let it play out. It's about a minute 30. It's worth your time. This is Glenn Greenwald and the great Mike Bens, who is our deep state specialist. I want you to listen to the question and it Bens his answer about U-S-A-I-D, how U-S-A-I-D. Everything they do is never what they say they do if they say it's a water project. It's really some anti-democracy project and how they have this sense of entitlement like, Hey, just give us the money and shut up. That's why they're so offended about what's going on right now.

0:
Watch this, whether

16:
You like it or not, Donald Trump has deputized Elon Musk to have this agency that's designed to eliminate waste as the White House sees it, wasteful spending, unnecessary spending. And so when the people that are part of this effort that Donald Trump has created after he won the election, went to usaid, and it's happened in other agencies too, you see almost this physical resistance, like how dare you come into our realm? You have, you don't run us, you're just the elected part of the government where this agency that exists independent of you, where does this mentality come from? That they have this right to pursue their own agenda independent of any elected officials or elected parts of the government.

17:
Well, there, the, the entire agency exists as a carefully constructed lie. And just like James Clapper and you know, John Brennan and Leon Panetta, these are, these are the holders of the great American, you know, closet of skeletons of state secrets. And you don't just hand that over to a random taxi cab driver because 51% of the population elected him because he does funny TikTok dances. What I think what I'm trying to say here is, is if you remember the recalcitrant around sharing, sharing intelligence with President Trump, both in his 2016 presidential run and then again in the, in the lead up to the 2024 election.

17:
I think what's happening at USAID is, is essentially an echo of that, which is that USAID is supposed to be untouchable. I mean virtually there's no USAID project on God's green Earth that is honest.

0:
That is probably the most critical piece of information you can have. The U-S-A-I-D effort is not genuine. They're not out there trying to help people. They're trying to enact a bunch of anti-democratic and prop up a bunch of NGO left wingers who are gonna help Democrats stay in power. That's it. That's why you saw an insurrection yesterday up outside of U-S-A-I-D. You did? Yeah. Did you miss this? By the Democrat's own definition of an insurrection invading buildings walking through open doors. This was an actual insurrection. This happened yesterday. This is why they're freaking out. Watch this. This is about 15 seconds. Check this out. As you

18:
Probably saw, Elon Musk and his crew put a gag order on a ID employees. They disconnected them from email, which is putting lives at risk around the world. So we are here to enter the building and so we can hear firsthand from whoever is here at a ID or at least witness firsthand what is happening with this Elon Musk attempted takeover, which will not stand. We will prevail. Let's go. Thank you.

0:
And then they go and walk in the building. I thought walking in the building was a freaking insurrection, but like the Chewbacca guy or something, folks, they're freaking out because the gravy train man is over. The Heritage Foundation put this tweet up and they're so right about U-S-A-I-D, which is the deep state piggy bank. Number one, the deep state's, not a thing. Now they're like, okay, it's kind of a thing, but it's not that significant. Remember Margaret Brennan, it's only 1% of spending. Now number three, okay, the deep state is significant, but it's a great thing. We gotta defend it. Now we're at number four. If you're opposed to the deep state, then you are the problem citing dopey ass bill Crystal, the deep state is far preferable to the Trump state.

This

20:
Is no happening,

0:
But it's great. That's Michael Anton. The deep state's. Not happening, but it's great that it is. Let's defend it. I gotta show you this. I can't leave. I can't leave without showing you this. Everybody stand by. Don't even dare go anywhere. Everybody needs to see this. I'm sorry. That sounded kind of like a toolbox thing to say, don't go anywhere. This is absolute peak. Donald Trump, did you see this? Y or it just goes to show you how a guy who is just this high level negotiator, probably one of the most skilled politicians of our time, based on pure results, man, pure results, won three elections in a row, right? But he can also be funny and endearing at the same time.

0:
I know you may have seen this. This is the presser yesterday. Woman gets up to ask a question. It was about Afghan women. I had a hard time understanding too. She had a very thick accent, but Donald Trump had to let her down a little bit. Easy. This is fantastic. Check this out.

2:
I have a little hard time understanding you. Where are you from? That again? Oh, actually, it's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. The only problem is, I can't understand the word you're saying, but, but I just say this, good luck. Live in peace. Go ahead, please. Thank you.

0:
Did you guys see that as it happened? This is just Pete Donald Trump, man. It's just, it's just who he is. No one plays the room like a puppeteer. Like this guy. Nobody, nobody. He drops this major foreign policy bombshell totally out of the blue, stokes out a maximalist position. The whole world responds and what, eight, 10 minutes later he is, got everyone laughing. Hey, I'm sorry, I can't understand. It's a beautiful voice, but live in peace. That's, it's just peak. Donald Trump. Hey, Thank you so much for tuning in folks. We had a great day at Rumble.
