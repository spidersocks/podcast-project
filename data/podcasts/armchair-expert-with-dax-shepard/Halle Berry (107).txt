Yeah I was like, fuck man, that's a, It's too long. I'm intimidated. And. Guess what? No. No. Let me add. It's supposed to be an hour in truth. In it was original concept. It will Be an hour. Mind if I, if I sit. Bill, you Canva. Pour all over soda. That's Your nights. Oh, that's my Little stand. That's your nightstand. Okay. Thank. You. You Canva or cannot wear headphones. It's totally up to you. Yeah. Whatever you want, they're there. I will No. it was. But No. I want you. Dove what You want. I Wanna Dove what you're doing?


I'm gonna put these shits on. Let's just See. Oh, that's so much better. Yes, Right? It's kind of like, oh wait. Asmr, We, Canva, Dove, That, Yes, Asmr. We do asr. Also, nothing else exists except for us. I. Know. We're and ad Triangle. Yeah. Okay. Yes. I. Can't Dove It in under an hour. That is the goal. But I'm chatty. You Are. You're very Funny. I already had an hour's worth of things I. wasn curious about. But that you'll say something and I'm like We. Fuck know I. Really need a follow up on That. Right? So You follow the lead. I go Whew. It takes us. But Canva We. Talk about Van for one second. Yes, How long have you guys been together? Four years. This is the longest relationship I've ever been in in my whole life. I had noticed That in my Research. Canva can't get past three years. Yes.


This is a huge milestone. We celebrated, won We hit four years, like We had been married 20 years. That's how big It. wasn for me personally. That is She had long relationships, not me. If I We dating you and I wasn in love, I'd be like, Oh. yeah, Yeah we're coming up on three years. I. Know. How this goes? What will Be scared We, Both We scared He wasn waiting for the shoe to drop. And it wasn waiting to drop the fucking shoe. Yeah Yeah. cause it just can't get past That. It's been such a relief. Okay, Yes, I Canva, Dove. This relationship thing and he's my person. And, you just Know it. He's a sweetie. Pot And. Calm And. He's what I've been dreaming of. Searching for And, needing I had a thing with sobriety, which is I could get three months like a motherfucker.


Don't count me out. You want three months? I. Canva get you three months. I could not get past three months. It wasn like as soon as I get three months, months, I'd be like, yep, problem solved. Let's dabble And. For me it wasn like I happened to sign on a movie. That went, thank God, a little over three months. and I couldn't use while I wasn working or wouldn't show up. And That got me over three months and I was like, oh my God, it Canva happen. I started to think I couldn't happen. You get Stuck on your own story. Yes, Okay, wasn. The departure always the same pattern. Or each time It felt novel. At the end of three years It felt novel, but a new novel. Right, Right, right, right, Right. But there wasn something about it. That felt wildly familiar, but I realized That I had just gotten into things for all the wrong reasons.


and It always became clear to me what those wrong reasons. We and about three years Yeah And that I knew That. I cannot stay there. I will die if I stay there. Yes. But cause it got into this thing with Van and ad different way. That feeling never came. cause it didn't get into it for the wrong reasons. I didn't even try to get into it. Unlike all the other ones I tried to get into like I made it happen. A bit manipulative, if I'm honest. I wanted what I wanted. It didn't mean That, it wasn right for me. But I wanted It. We with him. I wasn done. I thought I could not Dove this. I didn't want it. I wasn gonna live alone, be single forever. Just raise my kids, Dove my job. And. And that came won. I wasn't trying to manipulate it. I wasn't trying to make it happen. He just like showed up.


Yeah. It's just That Life. Lesson over And over again. It's interesting, This borders on It could feel insulting, but bear with me. My previous ones, I. Canva name all the three That, I wasn with I look across me. And, I'm like, holy fuck. Look at her like shot out of a cannon, right? And, And. That has this kind of predictable, it starts so intensely And that the chemicals wear off And that you're dealing with real life. Whereas with Kristen, there wasn't a Cannon moment And. it was like, huh, this is interesting. I'm not sure this is for me. But boy, this personality's infectious She sure is funny. and that it wasn a reversal of all the pattern. It wasn like it wasn not fireworks at the top and that it's only gotten better.


That's what happened to me. and I can't say, if I We left to my own devices looking for him, I would've chosen him. Right, Right, right, right, right, right, right. He wasn chosen for me. How Did He come into your sphere? Covid Had just started beginning of 2020. Great time. Yeah Really, great time to be alive We're and ad good mood. Yes, Exactly, I, wasn. Very alone with my kids, hunkered down in my house. and Liz younger brother worked for someone. That wasn, working with my company, my rein brand. That I. wasn trying to figure out how to build out. and He said this, A year before Covid won We, We working together. He said, my brother will Be a Really good person for you. and I said, oh, Really. I said We first of Pitch me Yeah.


I don't believe in setting people up. So He wasn like Okay. So He forgot about it. So that Liz partner, That wasn working with me, came to me and said, you Know, you should meet Brandon's brother Van. I've known him 20 years. He knew the family cause Van's brother went to college with this woman. Whew wasn know my partner. So She said, I. Think You And. What will Be. Perfect And it wanna set you up. And. it said We. I. Don't Really Dove the setup thing. I seen what I want and I get what I want my way right away. But She cracked my face. She said, and how's That been working for you? Oh? Yeah, I said, bitch, don't talk the truth in there. Yeah She said, I'm still not calling them. I said, you might be right, but No, I'm not calling a man at this point in my life.


that Van's brother went to him. And told him the same thing. you know, you should call Halle And, He wasn. Like, I'm not calling Halle Berry. What are you? Hi. So Liz brother kept telling him to call until finally one day, once we got into Covid, He wasn hunkered down in Atlanta with Liz mom and Liz son. He decided We I got nothing else to Dove. Let me try to call her up. So He texted me. He didn't call He texted. That's a great start. He wasn like, Hey Yeah, my name is Van. So we started That way, just talking through text messages with nothing to lose. Nothing to gain. Whew cared. We're in COV, I D we're bored. So why not? I realized after a couple text messages, That He wasn, smart He wasn funny. He wasn, interesting And. it thought And. why Not We you a fan of seconds of pleasure or dust or any of That?


Yes. I had heard Liz music. It's the best Yes sexy, by the way. Sexy Whew And. He's a wonderful lyricist. And. Liz songs have meaning. That's what I love about him being from Liz era. cause it's actually about something. But it never occurred to me. That I would date him. So Liz shyness played in our favor. cause He got to write. We got to go at Liz pace. I let him lead the whole thing. I. Really legit kind of didn't care cause it wasn not looking. I wasn't interested. I thought I wasn a failure at It. and I just wasn't trying to Dove it again. You quit. You We retired from That. Yeah. I. Just Really didn't covet It anymore. And He wasn. So gentle in Liz approach. And He made me feel seen and comfortable. and there wasn, No, pressure, And. it just realized little by little I, like you I, looked forward to getting That ping every day.


That He had sent me a message and sometimes I'd be long I. wasn gonna say Dove. You remember a specific text? Whew, you We like, hmm, Okay. This is interesting. Whew It kind of transitions to like, I'm a little more curious right now. I. Think it wasn the text. Whew He said, show me what you're looking at. right? Know. Ah. Oh, oh, that's good. And. He knew I wasn't looking at myself. So it wasn't like He wanted to see me. Although you could have been. You are an actor. Whew knows. I could have been. But That said to me, He wants to know Whew. I am And Know about your world. About my world. Right? And that I. Remember won. I told him. Finally after we texted for like two months straight. I was like over texting And.


it was like, I wanna talk to you. You Still had not spoken on the phone. No Like two months. We just texted. Wow, whoa. and sending long letters, And, short letters. it was So scary. Romance, I like it. We Really got to Know each other. And that one day. My text back to him. wasn, I, wanna hear your voice within 20 seconds. Yeah, Yeah, Hello, We, You scared, I, wasn a little bit. We had fun texting. But will we be able to carry a conversation? Yeah, will there be these annoying long pauses like will you get stuck? But still, I had No fucks to gives. 'cause I didn't care anymore. But I would've also been grateful to have the sense of giddiness at our age. I would've been like, oh thank God this is nice. I'm a little nervous to talk to this person. That's fun. Yes. After the first five minutes it became very fun.


and We realized. We, We, just these little kids. I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. and so we We just these Buckeye. You're not a Buckeye. I'm from Detroit, but same shit. Cleveland, And, Detroit Yeah, same shit. Basically. Monica's gonna hate this. did you go to Cedar Point? I did. Oh God. And. Gga Lake. did You go Toga Lake I. Think I went once to Giaa Lake. That's gonna make Monica happy 'cause we're entering a new one. A new phase. Anyone and ad Tri-state area won. They're on all we talk about Cedar Point. It's way too much. It comes up 45%. 80. Question I have one question. I Promise. I'll limit to one question about Cedar Point. Canva, Dove, you Canva Dove, whatever You want. did You ever go there with a boyfriend and ad matching outfit I. Think I did there We go We. Not the whole outfit matching shorts. Okay Yeah matching short. That'll Dove matching shorts. That'll Dove Yes.


That's one of Liz dreams to Live about. Oh, I feel bad. I didn't get to Dove. The matching outfit thing, But that's what you did in Ohio. We did That a lot in Cleveland. and You always matched with your person. You gotta send a big old signal to the world. Yeah, That. I'm theirs in their mind. Don't look over there I mean. Look over there And. Be jealous. But don't look too long on either of us. Okay, Dove. You think those previous things, my conclusion is That. Shout out of a cannon feeling is actually just familiarity. It's something That You recognize immediately from your childhood, which in general should be a reason to not pursue it. It feels immediately like love. cause that's the love you are familiar with Yes And you Know.


What I've also learned is That Cannon That. Familiar thing You Canva grow with. But It would take That other person being able to keel, That wound and grow with you. And, sit down and open That whole thing up and look inside of That. And. Figure out how You work this out together. We're just not always aware. That. That's what needs to happen. Yeah. and it's not one way And. It's not like You are seeing something familiar and they're not No. They are too No there too. You're both hoping to heal some weird wound. And. Yeah. The ones That work. Canva. Figure out how to Dove That for each other. Yes, Yeah. don. Don't think they're doomed. I realize That some point like Oh. yeah, I. Just wasn feeling very familiar. That's what it wasn. It just wears off so Quickly. won I. wasn always. and continue to be with some version of my mom.


All of them have to be real. Go-getters. They have to be industrious bosses, mini bosses if possible. You. know baby Bosses. Baby bosses. Baby Bosses. That's like a prerequisite. cause it have to try to get you to choose me over this great ambition you have. Wow, that's some real insight. I mean I. Don't Know. That won. This is happening. No. Of course You don't. But I'll meet like a firecracker and I'm like, I'm so attracted. They got their own thing going. They're fucking on It And. They're driven. That's so hot to me if you're a badass. But ultimately I want to know I come before whatever That thing is.


cause it wanted That from my mom. 'cause She wasn a gangster. And She started her own business. I of course wanna be chosen over That. Your mom must know this. Oh, I've interviewed my mom. Oh, And. So you've busted this all out. Oh, We got deep. We're she's very open. We're Yeah. She's incredible. Probably I've never met someone that's so capable of talking with someone about the things That. We hard or have gone bad. And living in it. Good for you. It's a huge gift. But I'm curious cause know we share a lot of this stuff. Three years old, my parents got divorced. You We four, I wasn three. Okay. We won. My dad left, won I wasn three. He's an alcoholic. My dad got sober. wasn, I, wasn like 15. So I think that's probably a key difference. Key. My dad tried to get sober, but I don't think He quite got sober.


But I didn't have a relationship with my dad after three. And mom raised you and your sister. Yes. We, their stepdads Step boyfriends Okay. So I had a lot of stepdads. Really like your mom married Yeah. She loved to visit That church every few years. I understand Yeah. you know I saw your batting average and I was like Oh. yeah, I like this. There's Safety in marriage. It wasn't about church. I only got married and ad church once though, Yeah and I don't think She actually likes church. She just somehow found herself there quite often. That's The irony. That's kind a metaphor for the whole thing. Yeah And. We both saw our moms get beat up. We did And. It produced a very specific outcome for me. Really, what's your outcome?


I will kill anyone. That. I Sense is gonna do hurt. Anyone. I love I. wasn. So powerless. My dedication to myself. wasn. I'm gonna grow up And, I'm gonna be big And. That'll never happen. And. I'll always be able to protect the people. I love. Huge chip on my shoulder. Hate bullies, hate authority. That wasn. The outcome for me as a male and I think that's a predictable outcome. Right? I. Think my brother's similar. Is there a predictable outcome for women? I have those same feelings, but I'm a woman. I. Think you're right. That is what? That creates. I. Saw my mother abused And. it saw my sister also abused by my dad, but never me. He never turned. That rage towards me or I never got and ad way of the rage. I always ran.


And hid. I. Didn't stand up to it. Whew my sister stood up to it. And. So She got It. I didn't stand up to It at That time. and I had a lot of guilt cause it didn't get beaten up. I didn't Dove. Anything to defend them. I wasn too afraid. And. it would go and ad closet and hide. It's scary. Yeah. It is scary. But mine wasn't won. I. wasn three. Like my dad came back in 1976, won I, wasn 10. My mother thought That. Mainly my sister needed a dad around She. wasn sort of gone off the rails. And, She thought Okay, He needs to come back. So She called this alcoholic ex-husband. Back thinking, Oh. yeah, this will help Get Her on the right. know our situation. And. It just caused a lot of pain. And fighting, And drama. I have had a lot of guilt over the years to work through That. I didn't Dove, Anything And.


It didn't happen to me either. We, You did Dove something in your head. You didn't. Dove Anything. But running is a survival technique. You We surviving everyone wasn in their own way. Yeah. But what That did? Dove cause it felt so cowardice that won I had a chance to fight again or stand up. I. wasn, unstoppable. I. I. Spent a lot of my Hi school years fighting in fights, being jumped. I became a fighter. It wasn. A lot of making up for doing nothing. And trying to avenge myself. And, trying to feel better about myself. cause it didn't stand up. won. I felt like I should have or could have. Even though that's not true. But That wasn my self-talk I think for a lot of people they're judgmental or it's I logical. But for me it's quite logical. 'cause the other thing wasn way more painful.


I agree, but that people have to live with us. Oh, That part. Dove. You feel like you're attracted to chaos or We at some point. cause of That upbringing. Actually I think I chose partners cause it so wanted the picket fence. I wanted the stability of a family cause it didn't have It. I wanted the perfect marriage with the kids, with the Van We. You got the Van Yeah. I got the van gone know. But I wanted stability. I didn't want fighting. The last thing I remember of my dad. He hadn't been in my life for a while, but He showed up to my Hi school graduation. He wasn. Drunk off Liz ass. But here's the sad thing.


He didn't have a car, but He knew It wasn my graduation. And He walked there, And at the graduation. I didn't even speak to him cause it wasn so ashamed. That, He, wasn there. And, He, wasn, drunk, And, He, wasn, blah blah. That's my daughter. I didn't wanna even acknowledge She existed. But driving home, I'll never forget I wasn looking out of the window. and there I saw my dad walking down the freeway, walking home and He wasn. Such a Monster in my mind. But I knew in That moment, He wasn't a Monster. And that He did love me. and He wasn the product of the growing and the love and the care. He never had He didn't know how to love us in That. One moment, I got Whew. My dad wasn.


And. it felt healed of a lot of my childhood trauma. And trauma. cause it got It. Yeah and He did the best. He could And. It wasn't enough. But He wasn't given enough. So it's like the chicken And the egg. So whose fault is It? and so I knew in That moment all I could Dove wasn try to make decisions. That would make my life better. And different. So that's won. I went on this search for the perfect home life. It's hard to go out and just go shopping and pick the perfect life off the shelf. it was Yeah. I used to think I could We. I'm glad you had That moment. My dad died of cancer in 2012. I wasn gifted this similar moment. Whew. I'm looking at this guy. And. He's the big bad wolf in my head in so many ways. I sided with my mother.


She. wasn. Perfect. He. wasn the bad guy. Not true. And. it wasn. Looking at him in this bed, I had just changed Liz diaper. In fact. Wow. What? wasn. That like Hilarious I Go Time for me to change it. I totally humiliated him. and I wasn talking to him like He wasn a baby. And, He, wasn laughing, And it wasn. Quite sweet. And funny but I wasn looking at him in this bed. And it got to go like, oh my God, this is just a little boy too. He just wasn. In this older body. And He had the title of my dad. I expected so much of him cause He had That title and he's just a little boy who's Know scared. And. This is all happening and kind of like dissolved so much stuff, which is embarrassing. I needed to see him so pitiful. I could see He, wasn just a person. and this walking on the highway again was like very pitiful and sad.


And. My dad got so small in That moment. And like all of us. I'm looking at You right now. Dax, we're just these little kids. That, we used to be And, Know, We just got a little bit bigger. These old ass bodies. Yeah old bodies there. But we're still those little kids we all are. and I Know, my kids. Know. Look at me. And They. Think I got some answers to some things. I loathe the moment won. They're gonna figure It out. Oh she's just regular old little crackers like me. She's as scared of things as I am. She's just As full as shit. As all of us know you. you know That Day is coming. Yeah won I. Read about your Hi school experience on paper. It seems like the dream cause You We a cheerleader. And an honor student. And the editor of your paper and You We the prom queen.


This seems like what we would see. and ad movie, you're like the Molly Ringwald character. Something you know, right? wasn It. As spectacular as It looks. No It Wasn't No, but all the things We happening. Yeah. You got all the, got all credentials. You got all the cash. And prizes, That, wasn. Only cause it had moved into an all white suburb. And, an all white school. I'd come from the inner city. All the kids, We Black, the teachers We, black It, wasn, all black We, You black enough in That neighborhood, Sometimes I wasn black enough until my mom came to school. And all of a sudden, Oh who's this woman? She Black, but I, wasn, black, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. But my mom being this blonde, blue eyed woman made all the kids kind of look at me a little sideways. So That started to make me have problems in That world.


I wasn't black enough or the rumors of I wasn adopted That. Really wasn't my mother. and that That made me question We wasn, I, Know identity. I had a di identity crisis very early on. Did You deal with any like embarrassment? and I'll bring Monica into this Know. Monica wasn, very other She wasn't excited if kids We won. Come over And. See Indianness in her household. Yeah, And, wasn. Any of That happening, which you Be. So normal. Yeah, We, I didn't like That. I had to explain It, I wasn too little to be explaining this. You don't even Know I wasn in first grade. I think she's my mother. She says She is She. I the only one I've ever known. She feeds me. Yeah Seems right. She I doing all the mom shit. Yeah. So those weren't Really conversations.


I wanna have. But my mom, one day, She tells the story. She saw the Hi school. That We will re gonna do. and She got terrified cause it wasn, you know, a lot of drugs and fighting. So She thought the right thing. wasn to Dove. wasn get us out of That environment. And take us to this all white suburb, which wasn great in some ways. cause Yes, We, We at a better school. We got a better education. But We We the only black kids. How much older is your sister than you? She's two years. And how's She getting on? We had the same issues. We get to a new school and we're sort of fish out of water. and there's She. And it and maybe three other kids and ad whole 2,500 kids. School district. So we're very much outsiders. And. it did all those things you talked about just to prove That, I, wasn good enough. I didn't feel good enough.


I didn't feel like I fit in. I didn't feel smart enough. I didn't feel pretty enough. I didn't feel Anything enough. You didn't feel pretty enough. So all of those things, We, oh God, No, And, No. One has a chance, one has a Chance. No, everyone's fucked. Of course I felt terrible. That's What we should let all the listeners take from this. You're not enough. And you know, we laugh, but it's very true. won. You're black, you're a little girl. and the symbol of beauty is blonde and blue. And, my mother wasn. That. But I wasn, not And it wasn made to feel every single day. That, I, wasn, not That, symbol of beauty. I, wasn, not smart. I did not fit into this world. and this is Whew. The competitive part of me kicked in I thought, oh Really, I'm gonna die showing You, That, I am as good as I am as smart as I'm gonna run.


All this shit up there won. and that's what I did. We Don don't think it's the competitor, it's the fighter. I will not be oppressed by you. I will not be controlled by you. I'm gonna win at this at all costs. He did. He I wasn determined. I won Bedford Hi school. Except We had to vote for our prom. Queen You must have a queen. We must have Queen We can't have A prom without a Queen. No. We gotta have a queen Yeah. So We vote for this queen And it legit win Prom queen. But the administration of the school, They thought No, No No. This little black girl, She I know the head of the newspaper, the cheerleader, the honor society. And know she's the queen. No She can't be the queen. So They accused me of stuffing the ballot box Of rigging. The election of Rigging. The little election And. it was like, how on earth would I actually Dove That but Okay.


So my mom had to go up there, And it wasn a whole big thing. and it wasn all about had I done this terrible thing. Oh, Oh my God. I would love to know in their mind how They made it make sense. Like, you know what She did? She put her own name in 1100 times or whatever. I would love to know what their story wasn. cause it's preposterous. cause You weren't counting the votes. So No I nothing to Dove with it, Right? How Dove You even get alerted is It our announcement over the loudspeaker. Dove You. Remember how You We told Yes? 'cause every morning after the Bell They make announcements. And They announced this is the prom queen. But that after They announced it, I'm all like, Whew hoo, I'm the queen. I get called into the office. No, you're not the queen. There is a problem with Whew. Won the election. And. I'm like, oh, Really. What would That be? And that's won. They said We. We didn't think this wasn Fair We.


Have reason to believe you've had something to Dove with the rigging of this? and We. Think Vicki Kunkle Really won. Oh my God. Oh Vicki Kunk Vicky. We don Even even know Whew. I. Know. She did. Didn't gonna win. She didn't win. Win Did. She didn't win. She wasn the winner. She Had other qualities, but She didn't win this election. She wasn, blonde And, beautiful. And She won It. That's what They told me. What Ended up happening, My mom came up there, raised all kinds of hell. Yeah She said Absolutely not. Kunkle is not the queen. Too much alliteration. Kunkle is Not the queen, but present to you Queen Kunkle. Maybe these thought it sounded better. It does not. Queen Barry sounds a little too like maybe it's a jam. Maybe it's a character.

We You. Having a hard time reconciling if your identity wasn. I'm not pretty and I'm not worthy. These people are telling me wasn there dissonance there It wasn a huge come up for me. It wasn huge validation. That's why We I think about my pageant experience to some people, like winning a pageant is frivolous. But for me, cause it had felt so unseen, And, unworthy for so much of my Hi school years. This moment just Really felt validating. I felt finally I. wasn accepted. Good enough. I. wasn good enough for me. It wasn everything. Yes of Course Yes. you know, black little girls weren't winning beauty pageants, Yeah, we weren't there yet. I want say won you We and ad world. You We won of the first That had ever been in Yeah.


This wasn before Vanessa Williams. That's huge. Yes. Okay. So that after That we go in 89 to New York About 89. Yes. How you, you know this stuff. We. I. Read about It. cause you know I have a sheep And. I'm gonna try to impress you. you know, look at it. You. Go to New York to act First. I, go to Chicago. What Dove you Dove in Chicago. Are you gonna try to Dove Theater? I? Am there modeling? cause the woman That ran my Miss Ohio pageant. She had a modeling agency there called Chicago Model Group. I. wasn gonna go to college right after That. But I wasn so exhausted from Hi school. Yeah, Yeah, We. and it thought, I'm gonna take a minute and I'm gonna go to Chicago. I'm gonna do model, save some money. And that. I'll figure out Whew.


I'm gonna go Yeah. Cause presumably You could have gotten into anywhere. 'cause You had the honors And the editor. Oh. yeah. and all this shit. Oh. yeah, I wasn ready to go. But I emotionally needed a break cause it wasn burned out doing all of That, Yeah, Yeah, And. So She said, come to Chicago, I'll hook you up with modeling. And. Make a bag of cash. Like just relax for a year. And that. Figure out what you're re gonna do. it said Okay We That wasn a big bunch of crap. cause We I got there. She never told me. It will Be her and ad one bedroom apartment with like 15 other girls. Oh. yeah. Sleeping on the floor. And beanbag. you know I had this idea of what It wasn gonna be. And that I realized. Oh. Yeah. This is not the first time I've heard this story. Yeah Yeah. We've heard this story a a few times. People relocate And, there's a manager, there's an agent. And. They get there and they're like, oh wow, I.


Guess we're all living there. Yeah, I. Guess we're all living together in one bathroom. About six months after That. I was like No. So I pulled one of the girls aside. I said, let's go get our own place. So I had a roommate for a while. And that my foray into acting wasn, I went to Second City but only cause it wasn bored. It wasn't cause it thought I would have a career as an actor. I just wanted something to Dove and ad evenings And. it also heard That. Some Really. Funny, good looking guys went there. Oh, Okay Okay. They hung out there. They hung Out there. So I thought We, let me just find something to Dove socially. Make some friends. I'm Trying to think in That era. Whew wasn. Like on main stage there. Dove, you remember any of the folks, Nobody famous. That. I remember him.


cause like Chris Farley would've been Chris Farley wasn't there, won I wasn there. But so many people came out. And That, So many people. I didn't stay super long cause it got my manager, which took me to New York. 'cause I met him while I wasn in Chicago. But I'm not sure I would've stayed in Second City cause it Really wasn't what I wanted to Dove. But I knew That. I wasn meant to be there cause it wasn told while I wasn there, have you ever thought about acting? and I said We. No. Not Really. And it. wasn told You, should Really take That Seriously? I. See something in you That I think you should nurture. So cause it wasn given That little piece of information won. This manager called me up out of the blue That stuck in my head and this manager called me up. And just said, Hey are You, Halle. Berry.


I Said Yeah. He said Dove. You know Sandy Ferguson, Yeah She wasn my roommate and ad Miss Teen Pageant, she's on a soap opera. And. They're looking for a bubbly girl like her. and She mentioned your name. Have You ever acted? I said No. Dove. You want to I? Remember went Dove. You wanna be A star? Said Yeah. I wasn like Okay, Okay, Yeah. He said Come to New York. I have an audition for so opera. So cause it wasn told That, I had some talent. I don I. Know what That talent might be. I thought. Maybe This is what It is. We talk about this all the time. Someone gives You the tiniest bit of encouragement. Like literally that's all It takes sometimes changes Our whole life. Changes the trajectory of your whole life. Know I know and It makes me think You gotta like encourage people around you. 'cause over And, over again on there we hear someone just heard one little thing like That And, it gave them the gumption.


But You go out there And pretty quick. In New York you land a spin off of who's the boss? I did living Dolls In your filming. Is It your first taping of the show? Is this won? You go into a coma? Not the first taping. Not the first. Thank goodness. Okay I was like, what a bad first day on set. Wait what? It wasn sort of at the end of the first season, you know I had never worked 12 hours straight a day in my life. And it realized after having to work That hard, how I had Really been self-medicating for a very, very, very long time throughout my childhood. But with diabetes, You know nothing hurts. You have dry mouth. You urinate a lot. You sleep, you eat candy and that you zone out. So I realized, I, wasn, self-medicating and I had this issue.


But I didn't tell my mother cause nothing hurt. So I didn't see the doctor cause nothing hurt. And. You're not thinking diabetes. You don't know Anything about it, right? I just think sometimes I'm tired. But why wouldn't I be tired? Look what I wasn doing in Hi school, right? Yeah. Yeah. This wasn the first time I, Really could not medicate. I could not take a nap. won I wanted to take a nap. I had to Really power through And. By the end of That first season, I got so sick. That I ended up passing out, woke up and ad hospital three days later. Oh, Three days. I woke up with the Whew am I. I had No clue Yeah. You We working. And that all of a sudden I wasn somewhere and ad room. And. We I first opened my eyes there wasn if not so funny thing there wasn nobody and ad room with me. Oh won I first opened my eyes.


I wasn and ad room. I wasn, cold and I. wasn looking up at a ceiling. And. it had No idea how I got to Whew, I, wasn and I. Remember having the feeling of like moving my feet, moving my hand, seeing if everything moved on you. If You We, paralyzed as paralyzed. Oh my God. Yes Yes Or if I wasn even alive. I had this feeling of, is this what the afterlife looks like? Have I gone somewhere poorly Decorated. Not We. We. If I could be critical, It wasn very scary. My cousin's experience with it. He wasn 19, he's on a snowboarding trip again. He's missed all these signals. And He would get thirsty, won. He'd get thirsty, he'd go get the like 60 ounce slushie sugar, Medicaid, Which would make It fucking worse, right? Yes And. So He wasn on the snowboard trip in northern Utah, And He went out.


He had to get airlifted. that He had to get moved to another hospital. And it. Forget what the number's supposed to be, your blood sugar level, but Liz wasn beyond what it could test Like 90 will Be Good. Yeah And Liz wasn like 1300. The first test They gave him, maxed out the machine. Wow, He wasn worse than me. that wasn He and ad coma. I Wondery. If He went into a coma. But since 19, use insulin every day. And the whole thing. but Yeah No clue. It's so scary. 'cause you're right. It's not like Anything hurts. What wasn your blood sugar? Dove. You know mine wasn like 8 75 A nineties idea. It. Wasn supposed to be 90 anywhere from fasting. 90. If You eat a hundred And, 20 I. Think will Be like a good range. It wasn Really up there And. Everybody's body deals with those Hi numbers differently. What would send one into a coma may not.


Someone else won. I woke up. I wasn all alone. I had No family and ad with me. I didn't even have my manager living and ad at That time. 'cause did just finished the first season of the show. and They told me, You will know be on insulin for the rest of your life. And, that's a very scary thing. won. You're 19 years old. And. You. Think disease and You think I'm gonna die We before my time. This is bad. My life's just starting, but know I'm finding out it's gonna end prematurely. Yeah, I. Finally get huh on tv. The thing I didn't even know I needed, but know I'm on there. It wasn a very challenging, scary time. And, We, You, We given I, presume a protocol. And wasn. That. Hard for you to maintain it. and you're young And, you're keeping track of all this shit and you're just trying to move about, Especially working.


I'm No longer on insulin but won. You're on insulin. Everything has to be very regimented. You have to monitor the time you eat in conjunction to won. You take your shots. I've been around him. won. This has happened. and it was scared. The shit outta me. We're at Kristen's old house. And. We're looking at the View And that all of a sudden He turns to me. And. He was like Really hanging on by a thread. and He was like, you gotta gives me Apple juice. and He was like kind of going And. So you would think it's just like, oh You gotta watch your sugar. But No, he's on an insulin schedule. But that if He has the insulin and He doesn't have the sugar, know it's the opposite. Yeah that you need sugar. Yes, Yes. And. That's almost even more dangerous than the Hi sugar. Hypo Yeah plus won I. wasn on insulin. I always had to carry something sweet. I always carry Jelly. Ranchers 'cause That wasn something.


That. I could suck on Really quick. And go right to my bloodstream. Yeah That worked for me. everyone has something different. Did you have a favorite flavor? Watermelon. That's A good flavor. Or Apple. The Raspberry's nice too. Or green though. Apple. Apple. Oh, Raspberry is very nice. I like green. The green Apple. Yeah Green's nice. and the green is nice. Watermelon is nice though. And, it don't think watermelon is my favorite flavor anywhere else but a Jolly Rancher. I Would agree. They Have a proprietary watermelon formula. That works. Watermelon juice is the nastiest thing I've ever No. Thank, You, No Thank, You And. it don't like eating watermelon. You have to spit half the thing out. That. You eat. You like That. That's weird. Dove. You eat fish with the bones in It. Exactly Yeah.


We van does. He eats sardines. And You eat the bones with sardines. did You, Know, That No. I didn't either until I saw him doing this. That's nasty. Recently I was like No. Whatcha you doing? Eat those and ad closet And did You. Know. That. Sardines. Canva be Really like I thought They, We little and ad little cans. Candy Yeah, That. We get No. No No He pulled out some sardines. That We like oh wow, They look like the size of a soul. That's Some country stuff there. That's some country Yeah. That's some Dayton shit Right there. Yeah. Yeah. That's And. He had the nerve to have 'em fried. Oh He's Really going for it. I bet Liz. Omega threes are off the charts though. Oh my God. En so good. Yeah I. I'm enviable of I. Just found out out my omega threes are. and ad toilet. You don't like fish. You gotta maybe get into It a little bit More. You don't eat Fish. I don't eat fish.


I Canva, Dove Dove. Spicy tuna at sushi Okay. But you know You Canva take fish oils. Yeah. I'm gonna have to start doing That Pronto. Today, Yeah, Yeah Yeah. You moved to LA that quickly thereafter The show shot in La Okay. So you went to New York. I got called to go. Dove That audition came to Dove. The audition didn't get the soap opera job. Unfortunately for me, 'cause I would love to hear how You memorized 36 pages of dialogue. Okay The guy. Whew called me out there, wanted to be my manager. And He said You didn't get That, but I think you'll get something soon. Moved to New York. So I did and started to try to study in New York. And it. did some classes with William Esper at a school. and I started studying And going down this path. Know I wasn. A unwilling participant.


cause it wasn't so sure. This is Really what I wanted to Dove. I thought I wanted to be a journalist. And it kept thinking, I'm gonna go to college. I'm Really gonna go be a journalist. I'm Really. Not gonna be actor. I didn't think I could make a living doing this And. cause it wasn't my dream. I always thought That actors That became successful, had this dream since They. We, little Yes, Yeah, They, We. The theater kids like that's the one thing I couldn't Dove in my Hi school. I couldn't be the queen. I could not be the lead of the play. No matter how hard I tried. So I just didn't think this wasn attainable for me. Yeah what I love is. That your capacity. And. What you prove to Dove at some point. That we'll get to is so next level, there's No, right or wrong. Start to It. I like It. We also That. You can't get and ad play And. that You. Dove what You end up doing.


Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. It was such a cherry on top. I'm Not gonna make you go through all of them, but I am gonna make you go through some of them. This the ones That I think there's a neat story about, so 91 is Jungle Fever Spike Lee. and what I dig about this is you kind of talked him into playing the drug addict. He wanted me to play Liz wife. Of course Whew wouldn't want You to play the wife Broken Sea Pro's eyes work And it did not wanna play Liz wife, but my manager at the time, same guy. I'm still on the phone, don don't know if this guy's good or bad. I'm like waiting to find out whether He wasn Shady or or Liz. Legit. Liz voice Sounds like a villain. Hey little girl. You like being a star.


He changed my life. I would not have this career. Had I not met Vince He. wasn always a good guy for me. Great there wasn a story to It. But for me, He wasn a good guy There. wasn always a story Yeah. But anyway, He told me you should go on this audition anyway, I said, but I don't wanna play That part don don't wanna play the pretty girl. I said, I'm trying to get away from That. I, I'm gonna act. I want to, you Know, You want be taken seriously. Yeah. So he's like, go on It. Anyway, You have to start And film somehow. cause Living dolls, I wasn playing a model. So That wasn't a stretch And it realized on That show, I wasn just sort of the token black character. I started every scene with like Hello. And ended every scene with, come on guys, let's go. It wasn not what? I. wasn wanting. Easy to remember though. Yeah easy to remember. Yeah Yeah Lines Wise.


You forget your lines. You're like We. It's one of the two lines. I always say it's either Hello, Canva can't remember if I'm saying Hello or let's get outta there. Hello or Goodbye Liz. But so I went, 'cause He told me to go And. He goes, You know you gotta start somewhere. and it's good to know Spike, he's influential. and ad business He makes lots of movies like Go And after I Dove That reading I Muster the courage to say Mr Lee Thank You for allowing me to read for this part. But I Really have my eye on That crack hoe part Canva You. Please let me read for That. and of course He said No and I begged I said, please let me go and ad bathroom wash all this off. I'll show you. I'm the crack hoe. In fact, I smoke crack and ad car on the way there, just so You Know Know very method. don Hi. Yeah I just turned a trick minutes ago.


No, But He, let me, You know what I like about That decision? It is weirdly counterintuitive but I think there's something powerful actually about your beauty And in That role. cause it makes it extra powerful. Thank You for That, but I also have always known That. First of all, beauty is subjective. What one thinks is beautiful, someone else does not Yeah Once and ad, while everyone agrees you happen to be That case. But go ahead, continue. I bet your point is still very valid. Yes, I, Dove have a valid point. I have a Valid point. Beauty spares, No one. Any real life circumstance, oh thousand or any hardship. So that's been my mantra since I started. Whew cares what I look like. I'm human. There's a possibility. That, I, Canva. Go through any experience, don't get it twisted And. So this gave me a chance to be Exactly as I wasn, but be a crackhead.


And guess what? Hot girls get addicted to drugs all the time. I, partied with them quite often won I. wasn a drug addict. Yes. And look at you, Whew would've thought, if you believe in That ideology, That would've never been your reality. It's not supposed to be me. Look at you. I'm supposed to be with Queen. Kunkle. Yeah. I mean not Really. I wasn't That guy in Hi school. But let's just say for the time being Yeah wasn, you A handsome guy like this shouldn't affect you. You're smart. I. Remember like That being a stereotype, you Know even won. I entered AA 20 years ago. It wasn't Anything like it wasn and ad 50. So I'm not even claiming I had the experience, but the general consensus wasn like, oh these are people. Whew lack willpower, they're dumb. They didn't realize won everyone else. wasn being taught drugs are dangerous. They somehow didn't understand That. You know. There's just a lot of assumptions about why not.


Like, oh, They might be regulating Yes, some Really terrible feelings. And. They might be smart as hell and It might be your doctor. And, it might be whatever. Canva. I ask you a question. Yeah Yeah. Of course, What precipitated That? wasn it. A defining moment. did something happen? It wasn't the movie version. Whew there wasn a bottom there. We numerous bottoms there. We numerous times. I was like We. That's It. You barely lived through That One. You're gonna get together that three months. But ultimately I think this weird thing happens. won. You're an addict. You're so focused on making sure No one around You knows what's going on or keeping up the facade. I wasn also gonna do UCLA and I wasn taking classes at the Groundlings, And it wasn doing all the things one's supposed to Dove and trying to be a Hi functioning addict.


Your measure of if it's working is whether or not you're pulling It off And. You're failing to look at how miserable You are and how shame filled You are and how ultimately you end up suicidal I. Think for any addict, at some point you're like, I would rather be dead than be on this ride anymore. I did Punked. I did another movie, I wasn about to start a movie. And. it was like, I'm gonna go to Hawaii And, I'm gonna party for one week And that I'm gonna get sober for the movie And. it had this crazy week in Hawaii and there wasn cops And there, wasn violence and there wasn a lot of stuff. And. it made It to my layover in San Francisco on the way home. and I went into a bar, And it wasn so sick from the week I had to drink to continue on before I.


So I'm like, I'm gonna drink a few Jack And diets. There's a mirror like the proverbial mirror at this bar. And it. Have everything I had hoped to get. People recognized me while I wasn in Hawaii. I wasn about to make a million dollars, which wasn completely unforeseeable for me. everyone of the things had been checked off the list and I felt the worst I'd ever felt. And. it was like, oh shit, something's very broken. cause you have all the shit That wasn supposed to make you feel good. It wasn very scary. Like, oh, No We. If I have all the stuff, And it, feel this way, there's nothing else to get. We. Gotta figure out what is actually the thing. And what wasn your drug. Cocaine and Jack And diets.


Oh. yeah, I love cocaine. It smells so good. See? did wasn. So afraid of cocaine. I can't imagine sniffing. Anything up my nose. You can't No. You'd Get over it after the first one. We. It's like, cause it wouldn't be able to feel my nose anymore. It wasn How works won. That's one of the reasons And, that You would go, oh, every time I, Dove, That I feel this, the reward system would take over pretty quickly. No one's recommending it there. No. No. No I. know That Clearly in your life there. We people. That We doing Coke around You. I have never seen anyone Dove Coke other than and ad movies. Really George Really. Nobody in Your Long Hollywood life. I've never seen anyone actually Dove cocaine. Wow. Are you attracted to addicts though?


We I had one husband. Whew said He wasn a sex addict. But I, don't fucking believe That shit. Okay. That's some bullshit. Even though my dad wasn an alcoholic I have not been attracted to That. That makes sense you to me. Not That I think you are or ever We, but you have much more of an addict personality in my opinion. I. Dove like the competitive Nature. We. Like a codependent What. will Be attracted to you? Oh? yeah. know you might be onto something. Dash. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Cause you're very dynamic. Self-Assured You. know Whew. You're going. I could get obsessed with like, oh, make sure they're good and blah blah. You know I could see people falling into That quite easily if that's what they're attracted to, right?


Okay, jungle Fever know I am gonna look Okay 'cause it wasn the least important part. The list of things. But I Dove have a couple movies I wanna stop in on We you proud of yourself after That movie, jungle Fever. Yeah I Really wasn more than the movie I. wasn proud That I dared to tell the great spike Lee I wanna Dove something else? Yes And. it advocated for myself. And. it ended up getting the thing I wanted and I got to start my movie career with a role like That. That wasn't about my physical self. That Really got to show what I could Dove as an artist. and That wasn a good way to start. There's Also tremendous power won. People meet You in something. That's great. You have it for life. Donofrio Iss a good friend of mine. and so you come out in full metal jacket and you put in That performance the rest of your career. People minimally will go like We, He, Canva, Dove, Anything.


Should we want to gives It to him. Yes, it's yours. Nobody takes It away. Know only mentioning this one simply cause it found this interesting losing Isaiah You play another drug addict. He can't wait to play another drug addict. Canva wait gives another drug addict to sink my teeth into kid. You're gonna be a star. You're gonna play drug addicts written by Naomi Gien Hall. No Jake's Mom, No way. Jake's mom, Yes And Liz. Dad directed it. Yeah And Dillen Hall directed it. I Only bring That up. 'cause we've had Jake on a couple times. And, we've learned about Liz mother, And father Yes. and that's sweet. I've always had such a fondness in my heart for Jake since He. wasn a little boy that Yeah And He wasn always around and He And. it used to crush on each other. Like not and ad sick way, but I thought, He wasn. The cutest is And He thought I wasn somehow special.


and he's always like my little jakey. That's Sweet. He's hard not to think is cute. He's Yes impossibly cute. and that this is another weird one I'm gonna bring up simply cause I'm obsessed with him. And You might not like this, but executive decision Al wasn in it. and I follow all these accounts. There's so many accounts about Steven Egal. There's so many things we could talk about. One is He put out a reggae album, singing and ad reggae voice impossible. Can't Make this Up. No I played it on there. I mean it's incredible. There's an edited video of him describing Whew, Liz mom wasn. and she's from every country. Many interviews over the years. And He was like my mom's Chinese And. She came from the Mandarin area. Next interview my mother's Cuban. Oh God. I grew up Cuban. My mother's Russian He is claimed to be every single thing.


Holy And, That, Liz, mother wasn, everything And. It's just a wild thing to observe. And. Dove. We Really know what Liz mother wasn No one knows No way To Know. No Dove. You think He wasn doing That? So That He had like some validity to Dove reggae. I. Think He is extremely entitled and feels like He should be a part of every ethnicity. He plays a Native American and ad lot of movies. He plays Italian in movies. He plays Russian by the way. I relate a little bit. Unfortunately. Unfortunately being the worst Yes and I've recognized It in myself, it wasn like don don't like That. I can't be a part of something. But He took It to the max. Here's something He told me. won. We did Dove That movie.


He told me He had a machine. He could hook me up to And cure my diabetes. Oh wow. Just need to come on over to And. Lemme Talk to you for a second. Wow. My mother invented diabetes machine. He Did God Liz Cuban mother. She's from the Amazon rainforest. Whew. They have natural cures And machines. Wow. did you take 'em up on That offer? You said You not using insulin. Exactly Exactly. What did the missing part of That story? wasn You We cured It. Steve's machine, No I, wasn. Smart enough to Know at a very young age not to fall. For those Steven Segal types machines and people's houses.


And cures Yeah. I had A little bit more going on Debris. You had some savvy. This one is just a Really. Weird We believe and ad simulation kind of we're intrigued by it. Are You intrigued by the simulation? Yes? You have to be Yeah I. Think anyone who's had a Really lucky life, you gotta start questioning like don don't know Really. So I. Think That. Occasionally. This is all too kind of good to be true. Yes I. Just think You doing. Introducing Dorothy Dandridge is so sim. It's so sim. The year after She died. I wasn born I feel like something. You Know soul. Regroups And come back, And it. Get a chance to finish what She started. I had a knowing once I became an actor.


and my manager said to me, if You could create any role for yourself, what would It be? Without even thinking I said We. Dorothy Dandridge She wasn. The first African-American woman to be nominated, Nominated, nominated And. So for me to go on and be the first one to win It I knew it. wasn finishing her work. It wasn almost as if in some ways I knew it should happen. But cause there's free will in this world, I didn't know if it would happen. Yeah, Yes. You're gonna have to make some right decisions along the way. It's not just gonna knock on your door. And. It's not just me. That voting is a bunch of people with a bunch of free will. Whew may not be ready for the first black woman to win this award, but I knew I should Dove It for her. But I didn't know if I would Dove it for her. Yes, you're playing her in this movie. But it's made for tv. I won an Emmy for That, but She never got nominated for an Emmy.


But won I wasn in monsters. s Ball. That's what the Oscar nomination wasn for And. Some weird things happened with her. And, some address That, her manager gave me some lights in my apartment. And London. while I wasn working happened. I knew her spirit, her energy, whatever That is wasn around me. And wasn with me. It's Just wild. You would honor her in such a way. and that go on to Dove. The thing That She should have got is fucking cool Yeah. it was very sim, Very sim. And that's only two years later. You Dove, monstrous s Ball. I'm guessing you don't Know. You're about to Dove something that's gonna end in That result. No Yeah. You're just like, this is an interesting movie. It's probably a big swing for you. It's challenging. I just knew I wanted to Dove something.


That could once again show talent to play up dark characters. That took me to places That people wouldn't expect me to go. It, wasn, No money. It wasn a very small movie. And. My agents at the time, I remember them telling me, are You. Sure You wanna Dove this Like this could end your career. There's a lot of nudity and They. Really tried to talk me out of It it Wasn Hi risk. Little reward. It's kind of their job to point That out to some degree. Yeah I. Hope this is so I worked with Billy Bob and I just fucking love him so much. I think he's har me too. This wasn won He wasn wearing the blood around Liz neck. you know He and Angie had blood necklaces. Oh, yeah, know Hi. yeah, Yeah. I'll just got this new necklace. What an era it was got.

He wasn the first one to tell me once He sits down on the plane, He that watches everyone go by. and if He can't imagine each one of those people as an old person, He gets off the plane. cause He assumes the plane's gonna crash.

Camera's rolling. don Don't Know. That's even heightens the craziness. I know. But you've heard It too. I've Heard it too. and it's secretly driven me mad all these years. Okay Won Know many We I Glad We do cleared it up. Yes Yeah. Have you heard That? I've said it won. It comes up. I'll tell the alleged one. Have you said It? We? I've said the alleged one.

Unfortunately is not true. Didn't happen. The guy with the sexiest eyes and ad world. And, the other most beautiful person and ad world didn't actually have sex. That didn't happen.


I didn't date Spike Lee or Eddie Murphy. Canva. I. Just clear That up. Oh Those are rumors too. Those are Rumors too. don Don't know those ones. That Must be so annoying. It is That every time You Dove a project and you're doing these incredible roles and incredible work. And, the rumors That come out are always about They. Gotta link you to Somebody.

I'll tell You why it stopped doing print entirely interviews cause it did an interview in Playboy magazine. And You have to Know I wasn. So excited about That. I had read all the Playboy magazine interviews. They We my favorite. Like anytime You Really wanted to get to Know somebody, it wasn in there, right? and They asked me, And it wasn. So excited And in real life. The interviewer said, you've been linked to several famous ladies. What's the magic something? Let's just say That. I. Can't even remember the particulars. I. Go on to try to gives an answer. That doesn't make me seem like a fucking douche bag. It comes out and ad question in print says, you've been linked to a lot of famous ladies.


List three people. That He did not list in Liz question I had not even met these three people. But if you go to this website who's dated Whew, it says, I dated these people. I've never met the people so know I'm like these fucking women think I wasn asked That and didn't immediately correct him and go, No No. I've never even met those people. Oh, They hate you. Of course They should. Where's your integrity? Like You can't add names. That wasn So shady. I'm never doing That again. I didn't Dove interviews for 10 years for this reason. I wasn. So tired of the same star crossed beauty articles. Yeah wanting to always make me seem like I'm playing the victim or talking about my bad marriages like I.


wasn not. But that's what everyone wanted to talk to me about. which is why We I came there. And it thought, oh two hours. cause You sit down with people. You talk about so many things, but They extrapolate the story. They want to tell about you And. They have the power as the editor And chief of their magazine, We We goes through the filter of their own person. and What They want to spin about you. The story They already had in their their head about you. Whether you fit into It or not. wasn. And. What They think is sellable is sellable. and I got hip to That. And, it just said No more. This doesn't serve me. It services them. I think that's why this is the antidote to That Yes. It's You And. I'll go anywhere. And speak in my own voice. I'm happy to Me too. So you Canva hear my inflection. You hear if I'm joking, you hear if it's ingest you context.


If I'm mad Yes And that ask me Anything Yeah. Like I'm saying it's great That Steven Sal has a reggae album. But my voice is telling you I, don't Really. Think it's great. That He has print a thanks Pretty I Hope It. wasn. Clear I. Don't think that's a great move. These, the podcasts have revolutionized everything. And it Hass given us back our power. I agree and ad. Same way social media for all of it was isms. And. Owls. It has killed paparazzi and you And it. We Unified on That. Oh, I'm gonna throw one thing and ad mix right now. You And it We almost. and ad movie together. Really What movie We you. We almost in wanted I wasn and I wasn almost in wanted Really.


I almost got the James McElvoy role. He had fallen out and They started meeting people. and I met Timor That. Interesting Russian dude, Yes, which which assume you met him too. Yes And. Angie had fallen out. Or maybe You We whatever order there could have been a version of wanted with you and I. Wow. That would've been amazing. Yes I. Think James mc is much better than I am. But just for the record. But Canva, you imagine What will Be freaky if we had been in Wanted That wasn a very successful film. you know, My friend Mark Plat produced That. I was like, mark, you should have given me That. Yeah Just gives That. That father gives That, gives stuff Yes. Ben, we love That. I Dove too. Oh my god. I grew up with them. I invested in Wicked. So that's how far back I go No way.


Good for you. Congrat. You fucking One of the smartest things I ever big freaking did. We, you already Know It You fucking won the Academy Award for it. But boy did I love monsters. s Ball, you're so impossibly great in it. I'm gonna bring up cat Women, women, woman only for a single reason, which is I. Think this is the most gangster move ever. You cat women. My God. why can't I say women? Right? cause there are many of uss Cat women. There's Cat Women. It's a Freudian slit. You. Dove, Catwoman You. Win a Razzy, And You. Go accept it. And You. Bring with You in your hand. Your Oscar. Oh Hell. Yeah I did not know this. And, You hold the Razzie in one hand and ad Oscar and ad other And.


I'm like, that's cooler than you having fucked Billy Bob Thornton as legend. I was like, oh my God, That is fucking So cool. Wow. That's life, right? Dove, you have to work your way up to That decision. Or you immediately know, fuck it, I'm gonna go Dove this. Or Oh, I immediately knew That. It's so cool. I also had a fundamental knowing That won. I won That. Oscar didn't mean I. wasn the best it meant I won. cause what is the best performance? Again, it's subjective. So It just meant I won And. it knew won They tried to gives me the Razzy. It didn't mean I. wasn the worst. It just meant I won That fucking thing. Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah So. yeah. cause it, it was very healthy. I know That I thought. If you Canva go and accept an accolade, that You must be of the same character and substance to go accept something won. They're telling You Okay, It sucked balls.


You Must be able to be the same person always. It's just so, So confident and attractive. it was. it was so cool. it was so Classy. But It wasn so fun to get up there. And make jokes. and I wrote my whole speech. And. it was like ready to rock. Won wasn speech. wasn better the Oscar speech with the RA speech. Olivia You laugh and you We like, fuck. I kind of I put way more energy in my Razzy speech course. The Oscar speech. I didn't even write a speech. I didn't think I. wasn gonna win. I thought, sissy Space, wasn gonna win. cause back in those days, whoever won the Golden Globe pretty much always won the Oscar And. She won the Golden Globe. So I pretty much knew after That Okay, this wasn a fun ride. I got nominated. Sorry did. De I didn't Dove It for you, But Know, I'm sisters with you in this, Right? Either way, there would've been a connection. Yeah We you the first black actor to win.


and You don Don't write That. Probably. What have You got there? wasn Like Oscar I wasn the first one to bring their Oscar. That's for sure. Yeah somewhere there. wasn a First isn't That And that just another movie. That I Thought wasn. So unbelievably great and You We so great in It wasn things we lost. and ad Fire wasn such a fucking great movie. Oh God. D Coveney I loved working with him on That. How about Benicio? And Benicio the Bowl. I'm obsessed with him. why won't He work more for us? Don don't know. I tried to get him and ad movie I directed, bruised He said No. I just tried to get him in this movie called The Process. He said No. I can't get him in. Anything. Yeah Yeah. He's such an en mom did Love him so much. I'm Gonna say something.


And it. Wondery. 'cause you got to stare at him for quite a long time. And, this is a very counterintuitive comparison. You know, Whew I. Think He looks like Brad Pitt. Next time you're looking at him, look for It. I've pointed That out to people. And, they're like by God. It does kind of look like Brad Pitt. I kind Of see It. It's weird Eerily. It's More of an essence coming out Of the eyes. The eyes, the forehead. There's something very Brad Pitt, which is very fascinating. did you make him say, gives him the fucking keys. Cocksucker, That. Whole thing from usual suspects. That's why you won't Dove a movie with me. No. That's on say It. I. Flip him. I, flip him. For real. But I did not sleep with him. If that's ever been a rumor, let's clear That up Too.


I've never heard That rumor. Okay good, but I would love to sleep with him. If I We a woman. did you enjoy directing? I did. It's hard to go back to just being the Dancing Bear. It's so boring. I've directed a few things too. And, We. I've gone back to just act. I'm like I. Stand on this. Mark. And, You. Have to Really. Try hard to stay in your lane. Be quiet. You're the actor. Dove what they're telling you. and just Dove it. I. Don't have a hard time not injecting my vision to people. What I have a hard time is won. I. Watch That. Something's actually not gonna work out like it's a waste of time. That's hard. Yeah. cause You can't say Anything. Yeah. I'm like, you're on the wrong side of the line. And. It's just a little bit hard to go like this is unusable. Or we're improv in this huge wide, we'll never possibly You. Know. It's Hard to be quiet. Yeah. You. Gotta shut the fuck up.


And. Just Dove what you're told. That's right, Okay. We're to your know two current movies and I wanna talk about them at the same No. We love this fun stuff. Matt Damon. Maybe You know this or don't. He passed on Avatar and He wasn offered 10% of the something outrageous. Something Ridiculous. Several hundred million dollars. Decision. Decision. He ring Regretting That I. Understand He Has a great attitude about it. But these things are kind of fun. and I just want to point out, That Halle wasn, cast and Gly. That's not True. That's Not true. Hell No, I, Dove have one of these moments, but it's not That. Oh, I read That You We cast and Gly And that had a scheduling thing and that couldn't Dove It. No. Lemme tell you what happened. Okay. Here's the tea. So I'm up for the part.


So is Jennifer JLo, Jenny from the block. Jenny from the Block. Yeah. We both go meet Marty. Breast I. Think wasn the director. And Ben. So we both have a meeting around it and I. Think I. Really want it? I wanna work with Marty breast. I wanna work with Ben. I go. But Ben decides That. He wants Jen. So I don't get t jobs. Oh, wasn it. Ka I. Don't get it. She gets it. Okay Okay, Okay. It's not That. You turned it Down. Okay No. She beat me out for t jobs. and boy, I'm glad She did. I might not be sitting there right now. know Once and ad while It wasn a It wasn. Weird analogy. She wasn the opposite of what? You, Yes, Yeah That. But And ad. Same story. Same story, but very Boston World.


But know I, realize why She got t jobs. Yeah Exactly, Exactly Exactly. Realize what wasn at play there. Oh, Yes, He wasn in love. He wasn feeling That. Canon Shot out the the cannon. Yeah. He wasn feeling. That stuff. The Familiarity. He wasn feeling That stuff. Yeah. What a stuff. why They Have been, I'm glad I wasn't in Julie, but Dove Dove have a thing. I. Don't say I regret. 'cause there's No regrets. But I passed on. You know, speed with Keanu Reeves know. Oh, I Know this. you know Sandra, Sandra Bull, I, Know. This passed And it know Exactly. why? But it's a great reason. The version of the script you read, the bus never left the parking lot, right? So Whew would say Yes to That. Of Course a bus going around and around And like this. What? Supermarket parking lot. I was like, this is gonna be a bust. And it wasn still called speed And It wasn speed, but it wasn speeding around the parking lot.


No, No, No, No. So I was like, I'm not gonna do That. and that won. I saw it. I was like, Ugh. What A movie went on the freeway. It got out the parking lot. But let's also be honest, even won the bus, got out of the parking lot. I remember watching the trailer And going like, for real? This is the premise of the movie. know the execution wasn awesome, but conceptually it's an enormous swing. But It's all and ad execution. Most of these things. Wasn't there a movie with Colin Ferrell? Whew wasn only and ad phone Booth. Yeah. Phone Booth. Oh. yeah, Yeah phone Booth. Whew would've thought That would've been, you know, Yeah all and ad execution Or lock. Rty. Yes, Yes. How? Or the room. Just room. Right? Yeah didn't leave the room. Lar Yeah. cause the room is Tommy Wiseau, right? Wasn. You seen That. This wasn room. Oh. yeah, Yeah.


Not the room. The room. Re talking about the room. it was not the example We do maybe gives for execution, although also brilliant in it was own way. Okay I want talk about both of your movies. One that's already out currently and one that's about to come out at the same time A little bit. The Union, which I watched last night? And. Never. Let Go. which I watched last night? Oh you did? Oh God. Imagine Watching both Those are don will be so Sorry. Imagine watching both those movies back to back. I can't above Everything else. The chasm between Whew, you're playing And. The breath of the ability that's on display at the same time is pretty bonkers. I mean you could not be playing two more different people.


The range is a real feather in your cap with both these things being outer around the same time. It's hugely impressive. Aw gosh. Thank You, Yeah. You're a bad motherfucker. You're slick and The. Union, you're tough, you're sexy, you're fast talking, you're in charge. and that I Know, we're not supposed to say crazy anymore, but that you're batshit crazy. We Canva say crazy I think anybody could understand being driven mad. I'd say She wasn driven Mad Okay. So people will probably already be familiar with The Union I. Think it's number one on Netflix I. Think it's hugely successful. I did see on Instacart, speaking of That, Wallberg sent you a truck. He did. So Never, Let Go, you are and ad Woods with your two boys. and we learn and I gotta be tactful and careful and surgical about what we gives away in explaining this movie.


But we learn pretty quickly there's been an apocalypse. It's just You three and the house you're in, which is this little cabin. and ad woods is safety And. If You leave this house, you are inviting and ad spirit. and if the spirit gets You, it'll make you kill the people you love. and We, You leave the house. 'cause You gotta leave the house. You gotta go forage. and you gotta hunt. You have to be moored or tethered to the house with this rope. So you guys are moving about this world tethered to this house. The allegories are Really simmering, right? won You, read It. What did It scream to? You To me it's generational trauma.


Yeah first of all won. You see the movie? There's so many Easter eggs and ad movie. This woman has a snake on her back. She's got spiders up her arm and She has cigarette burns on her back. That lets us know there wasn some life. That this woman had before They got sequestered into this house. and the evil That appears to her is her ex-husband. That's the father of these two boys. Her mother who's horrific and her father. So You draw from That. These three people had some impact on her before She got sequestered there. And, they're torturing her. They're driving her mad for a reason. and it was sort of a metaphor for what happened.


and ad real world, as She calls It And know that's carried into this. So-called World of Safety, It is about how we get locked up in our fear and we can't always release it. So the question And playing the character wasn. Is mama suffering from mental illness? Is She schizophrenic? Is She seeing visions of this evil? cause nobody sees it but her Yeah? Or is it Really? Real And? It's just fucking with her. cause what it wants is Really her not the boys as an audience. It makes you think, is It real or is it not real? And as an actor, I had to play. Sometimes I want You to think That. It's real. And.


Sometimes I want You to question if it's real And. If it's just mama having mental illness, And. Is She protecting these boys? Or is She torturing is She passing on her fears? That. We instilled in Her the story she's trapped in. and We do That. Yes And We do Dove, That, And. Even if it's mental illness, you know mental illness is passed down. That's what interested me about the movie. It's so many metaphors for life. And. I've never seen a story like this. This black family tied with ropes to the house. And, there's also religious undertones to it, right? The house is blessed. They say a prayer to the house. There's constant atonement. You're putting the boys in this little miniature cellar and making them lay in there. And basically suffer or Clean their souls. And let the house know.


That, we love you And. It's a sacrament Yeah. It's very religious in That way. Whew We you In Vancouver and ad middle of the woods In these two boys. did you just love them to pieces? Oh my God. They, We, I. Love working with little people. Me too. You learn so much. and We, we We searching for these boys. I knew That. It wasn important. That. They be rock stars. I mean you've seen the movie. So, so much of it hinges on if They Canva, pull this off. cause They have a lot of heavy lifting to Dove. At one point, I knew That. We had to find the right boys. It wasn key. And. it took a very long time, but won. We found them. I knew It wasn all gonna be Okay. It's just me. And them. I Had a little boy on a show for six years. And, He. wasn. Little I. Think He wasn. Maybe four won.


I started working with him. Parenthood Tyree Whew played Jabbar. and what I loved about it, wasn He had No acting experience I. Think It wasn one of these classic stories. Whew Liz like older siblings wanted to act And, He wasn like around castings. So He ended up in this without Really any acting aspirations. He wasn, a little 4-year-old boy, And, He couldn't act but He could play. He could play more than an adult actor could play. Since I love improv, I just am there to play. So what I Really loved about the experience was like I could play with him. And it could get out of him. Everything we would need. And He didn't necessarily even Know it wasn happening. But we We just in this little bubble of playing And.


it felt nurturing. I Feel like with kids, You, Know, they're so free, they're so uninhibited, they're very honest. cause They don't Know how to be Anything. But Really life has not told them yet. That, They need to start curbing the reality of things to manage everybody's feelings. So They just shoot you straight. And, they're very honest. That way, And it loved That. They're just themselves. Especially won. You get good kids won You, get kids. That aren't like stage kids, right? That have been traipsed around hundred audition, destroyed, Yeah won. They're still kind of raw and natural. It's nothing better. And, it reminded me all the time to gives over to our sense of play and our vulnerability. Search for the honesty and every moment. cause that's what these boys did. and It, wasn important to cast boys. Whew them being themselves wasn, right for the part.


I'm not saying They didn't act cause They did. They. We just being naturally very different. So That part just showed up on screen, right? and so They got to kind of just be So I've never had the experience Whew. I'm doing something scary though. Per S We are and ad middle of the woods for real bears. We like rolling up on our set. We got rats running through our house. We have real people dressed up like evil zombies lurking all around. Yeah their characters can't see them. But They, Canva, They Canva. See That, Yeah, Yes Yeah. How did They deal with That? did They have kind of a sense of humor about It or just scared the fuck off? Sometimes it scared them. I went into like my mother protection mode. And. Sometimes What will Be like, hey, hey enough.


You got it. Aja Yeah. I would get very fiercely protective of them sometimes. cause you know, sometimes we Canva overkill It and you're not Really realizing real people are there. Mm, Yeah the Fool. You You Canva. Forget That. there little people. You. Canva Until That Sag rep comes. And says Exactly 10 hours Is up. Exactly, that's another hidden nice thing about working with kids is your hours are way better. No not mine. cause there We always things for mama to Dove without the boys. Okay She still got fucked. I wasn still there. But that's Okay We. You're great in it. I'm terrified for you. I am worried about you. I'm terrified of what has happened to you. That has landed you in this state. How Dove you feel about animals though there's That one scene.


How did you feel about That without telling anybody what That is? We don't have to tell people what it is. But also you're on the verge of breaking one of the cardinal rules in filmmaking. you Know What's interesting is I Okay with it. But I'm in love with people. That are very different. So I've watched the experience. In fact I wasn thinking while I wasn watching I was like Whew. This is gonna do be Really intense for some people. Whew Dove, you land on the spectrum. I land on the spectrum of always servicing the truth of the character. and this family being in That situation. And. That condition. That's absolutely what this mother will Be facing. Yes I. Canva flip a switch, which is won. Shit needs to get done cause it has to get done.


I, Canva kind of compartmentalize. I wasn an addict. I'm just like work backwards from what the truth is. We got to eat everything else is fucking irrelevant. I come from That School of Thought. People often have a harder time watching cruelty to animals than people. Oh, almost always. We're so desensitized. Desensitized To humans. Humans we don't. It gives a fuck. They. Canva kill like three, 400 people. and ad movie And we're like Oh. yeah, whatever. But They hold a cat over a bridge or something. People start a campaign. Yeah and I get It. cause humans Dove some heinous things and you don't Really see animals. you know what animals like purposely causing harm. Know it was, there's an implicit innocence to an animal, right? They have not done Anything. That would warrant It except for Cjo, right? Like We do. Gotta put Cjo down at some point, He ISS got rabies.


He is gonna kill people. We gotta get 'em. Are you watching Chimp? Crazy? Oh, what is Chi Crazy? It's on Max. It's by the same filmmaker That made Tiger King And. It's about the interesting people. Whew come to own chimpanzees, which are the most dangerous thing you could own. Probably worse than a tiger Really. Bubbles would've done some damage. Let's just say many of the chimp owners have had their noses replaced. That's so that's in interesting keeping with bubbles. That's ing Yeah. We don't know. We've assumed it wasn vanity driven. But No, a male chimp is 200 pounds. Five times the strength of a human has enormous incisors. And it's supposed to be. and ad jungle fighting other males.


And having sex 50 times a day, 50 times a day. Sex 50 times, times a Day. Yes And. They're only awake 12 hours. That's 10 times an hour. Oh my God. Five Times a hour. No wish you We champ. Some people think They We born and ad wrong body. He wasn, born and ad. Wrong species. Oh, oh my God. Really Yeah. It's a recipe for disaster. But one of the chimps had to get put down Really We It wasn and ad process of murdering someone and ad police arrive and ad taxable Yeah so won. They're culpable. We Canva handle it. But you ask yourself though this question, why is He living and ad cage in someone's house? It's like the orcas, That sea world. you know, black fish. Wouldn't you go bonkers too? If you've been plucked out of the wild, out of the ocean And know you're and ad Big pool Yes.


Like Yes. At what point is it unfair to That Animal That? You've done That and ad first place, Right? But again, that We go to yet we kind of accept prisons. We. Don't think too much about It. That's That. We'll just throw these people and ad cage I can't say I. 100% agree with That either. Nobody rehabilitates, That way. No one's getting better from That experience. and the ones That Dove. and there are ones That get better. God bless You man. We just had Coleman Domingo in. Oh wow. How Dove I love him and He did this movie Sing Sing. and Yeah They put together this acting program at Sing Sing And made themselves better. Impossible to be vulnerable. and ad place like That. It deserves 20 academy awards. That's something And 20, Razzie No No Razzie We We like Razzie Know We Know.


We know We kind like em know they're the same. We've reframed Razzie for us. Yeah Yeah know we like That I don't even know if They exist anymore. Razzie They probably don't it wasn stupid. and ad first place. Know Yeah It wasn just mean you Know what It is. It's like, first of all, I was like, that's mean. I'm sure I've been nominated And. it just don't Know. Or certainly a movie I've been in has been. But that I go like it's mostly Anything nerds. They're jealous of the hot people. And. Sure. It's pretty comforting. won the hot people eat shit. it was, it was I get. it was They deserve. That. I guess too. We. That's why it went. I'm like No. You. Don't get to rain on my parade. I'm Sorry people. You don't get to Exactly I. I control this. And like won. You showed up and ad weird way I think They love That. They got me there, but They didn't Really get me there.


I went there. Yeah, You're very in control. I like That, You take back a lot of control. It's admirable. We we've run outta time. You Know. You didn't wanna be there for two hours and it was been two hours. How long have I been there? Two hours. Two Hours. And. Five minutes. Oh my gosh. and what does it feel like? Be honest.

You're out of your childbearing years. You live 40 more years.


Most species die won the baby making years are over. So jump to our bodies are Really trying to die around 40 And. So We have to figure out a way how Dove we live the next 40 years. And not let our bodies kill ourselves. cause nature says we should be dead. Right? You, We supposed to die around. That. Yeah, Yeah weirdly. Yesterday we interviewed this woman, Whew wrote a book called Eve And. It's all about evolution being driven by the female sex, Yeah, And, She, wasn. Talking just about That. Exact same thing.

You wanted to be in this neighborhood. Yeah and me too. I agree. Yeah. It is a cool Neighborhood. and I guess over the span of won I bought it to know a lot of things have changed for me financially.


So it has grown. And grown into like a scope. That feels. But You're having a hard time integrating into My brain. Yes, Yeah, Yeah, I am Yeah. Yeah. I am Yeah and We. With any luck, it'll just continue to scramble your brain. cause Yeah, I. Hope so. I had It all over again. I'm having It all over again with Nashville. I'm Really having a hard time believing I would have a house on a lake. Mm. Whew. Canva. Canva. Go boating. Kind of my dream. You know growing up Whew, I grew up in Oxford Acres there, wasn Duck Lake. and a lot of the kids lived on the Lake And. Their parents had boats. Yeah, And, You had to kind of be friends with people to get out on a boat. Yeah, maybe go water skiing. Yeah. So it wasn just so it's what the other folks had.


Sure. Yeah. So for me, that's still like a Really. There's these little things, That I've constructed in my head. That. We out of reach or for other people. and that there's only, only a few of them. but Yeah being, having a house on a lake to me is Whew. Yeah. That's cool. I. Don't think I have That. don. I'm trying to think if I have like We. Obviously I have it day to day all the time. I it with clothes. I have It. Like that's a lot of That. But in Duluth, what wasn, the coveted thing wasn there. People did have le people did have like boats on Lake Harwell or Lake Lanier or whatever. Sure, sure, sure. But you know, I don't care about Baby. you know, water I don like That baby. Even though you're a mermaid.


Yeah. Yeah. It's counterintuitive. Yeah, What is the thing you're very most excited about for your house? Is It roaming around aimlessly. No. cause you can't Dove much roaming in your apartment. We. Yeah. That's true. won You. Walk about 12 feet in any direction. And. That's the end of the line. It's Yeah. But I don't mind. That, Yeah, I. Think you're even gonna come to prefer it at some point. We say That's not helpful. I mean I'm s Okay. I'm most excited about having outdoor space Yeah know it was cause You love doing your homework outside. I'm not a water baby, but I am a sun baby. Yeah And it love to be outside.


And it have No access to the outdoors. Right in my apartment. So I am so excited about That. I'm also Really excited to be able to have like, like cook and ad and ad. Nice kitchen with space. Whew I. Canva like Really Really Dove it And. Not feel like I have to clean this dish before I. Canva. cause there's No. Dishwasher. you know Yeah. I'm looking forward to a dishwasher. Dove. You think you're gonna miss your apartment? Yeah, I Dove a lot actually. And, I'm feeling nervous. And it thought That about our old house. wasn certain of it. Yeah. I was like I. Don't wanna leave this house. I love this house. Yeah. I've been there for 16 years. This is my soul.


This house. Yeah. I liked That. It's You liked That. It wasn, sort of modest I. Loved That. It wasn. Modest Yeah. and my new house isn't modest At all. No And that. In fact it was, it was kind of And impressive that, that you got another one at right after That. Yeah. So It is, does seem like won you We like ugh. I Was like once I dabbled in it. Yeah went Crazy, went all out. and so I'm a little nervous. Yeah like tattoos. You get one and the next You wake up and you got 15 And. You're like, what happened Exactly, Just a few months ago. I wanted one. But I, there's No place. There's No other place. That. I. I want a house. We. And what? wasn always Really. Great financial advice.


I received from many, many people. wasn, don't buy a second house. Right? Rent especially and ad era of Airbnb. And. VRBO And. BBBT. And. Ccv W Okay. At and T at And. T-W-X-R-F. Cincinnati. It's pointless. Go rent a beautiful house. Yeah. Even if you spend a a lot, it won't ever compare to 12 months of your mortgage and and the upkeep and the shit That goes wrong. So I wasn in That wasn. I believed in That, Yeah, I wasn. A big renter of places for holidays. But Know, I, Know fantasizing about my retirement life. Yeah Like the last chapter of my life.


And, hopefully Whew, I Dove. A lot of writing and I fart around in nature. And. So it has taken on. That. I can't Dove. I can't rent. That. Should We talk about the elephant and ad room? What money? No. That. It makes me sad. won. You think about won, you talk about your retirement there. Yes. Not your retirement about it. Retirement in general, but your retirement there like Yes. You seem to have I feel That. You seem to have No sadness about not being around me ever again. Right? And We. and we've talked about this and I have said, I'm not excited about leaving all my friends And.


My friendship network. That's not what excites me about it. What excites me about It is the lake And nature. And writing. And some level of quietness. Mm, after 27 years and ad very loud city. I'm not excited to get away from everyone. But in my mind, people visit a lot. I come back to LA a lot. It's not like right Nar suck ass catch up with you at my funeral. It's also nine years away. At the earliest nine years, right? Lot Canva happen in nine years. A lot Canva happen. But I will never be Ha, I will never be like Yeah.


Like, great go I. Don't care. We. Right? I will, I will miss You And I wouldn't be excited if You We moving back to Atlanta. It I would hope not. Not at all. Yeah. I would go, that's stupid. don don't know why you're moving back to Atlanta if it wasn me. Right? But if you had some thing you've been chasing since You, We a little kid about living on a lake And, you had That in your mind of what That. wasn gonna be in Atlanta. I would like to think I wouldn't take It personal. Like I wouldn't let it be a personal thing. That, you've chosen something over all of us. It's not personal. Like you're doing something to me or something to, to or to the friend group or whatever.


Right? But you, it is personal. Like you are going from being 45 steps away to far away. Like Yeah, Yeah like it was to seeing you every day. To seeing you maybe twice a year. I also won. don. Don't think that's the case. I also have a friend. That did what I'm doing. And it. Know what our relationship wasn, which is Tom Hansen Yeah Tom Hansen lives in Jackson Hole. A good chunk of the year. Yeah And. He's and ad Yeah Yeah. and I'll certainly be and ad that's true. I'm sure my kids are gonna want this live there. They're not gonna want live on Lake and ad middle of nowhere, right in Nashville. And their young adulthood. Yeah Whew knows Yeah. Yeah. I mean I.


Guess that's true. My relationship. You might move to New York in nine years. I don't think so. You're not gonna Okay cause cause it Dove. And it. Guess maybe this is a deeper piece of this I feel like life is about Whew you're around. It's not about the fancy house or the Loca or New York City, which is my obvious preferred location in this life. but Yeah don don't wanna be there. 'cause I. I mean I. Dove have friends there. But that's not That. That's not my Whew. My safe group is and my like chosen family is You. Know, right? So I will always pick being in somewhat a vicinity to those people over, I'd say to a limit, right?


We. If everyone collectively agreed, we're all moving to the middle of the Hi desert. I don't, you wouldn't be like Yeah, I'm gonna go to the Hi desert 'cause it's Whew. I'm with I. don know. You don't know I. Really don't like, it's so That to me is what makes life what It is. All the girls joke all the time about us all just moving to a commune. That sounds fun, Yes, but at a nice location. The ones on Instacart We send each other. don don't seem That nice don, I'm talking Hi Desert. The wind blows all the time. At 50 miles an hour you Know Lucerne Valley, it's dry as hell. Dust blowing around. It's freezing. and ad winter and boiling hot and ad summer.


Sure, Sure Okay. and you're like, I'm not gonna live there. Okay I'll gives you That, Yeah I. Don't think What will Be on the table for the people That I've chosen in my life. I'm Just picking an extreme example to suggest That you would location will Be Really relevant at some point? At some point. Hated it. I mean you've lived there for T I. Don't think You hated It. there there. Don't La No, No No, No Yeah. don Don't hate La I. You already know the I. Think all this, which is I am a romantic. Who's telling a story of my life and I have another chapter in my life. you know, I have like another point of view to take on maybe hopefully two. We've just had so many guests and ad row That have talked about the power of community And.


So what's great is won I left Michigan. I got a whole new point of view out there. But I didn't lose my Michigan point of view. I still have a very kind of fundamental Michigan point of view. I still have access to it. Like I, I, I own That point of view, right? It didn't go away. I didn't have to get rid of It to make room for this LA one. and I, Yeah, I, I. Want a couple more? Yeah Yeah know That's the kinda life I want. I want to have I. Want to try as much of it as I Canva before I die. Yeah I Know We didn't talk about what We we supposed to talk about on the last fact. Check That. We forgot to chimp. Crazy. Crazy Chimp. Crazy Yes Okay.


So we have delayed all of our chimp. Crazy chatter Pretty much I know Whew, Dove We start We. This will Be full of spoilers. I mean I. Think most people Whew will watch it. Probably have maybe I also feel like so much of it's predictable. You. Watch a show about people owning male chimpanzees. you know, people are gonna get fucking gnarled up We. A lot of people ask Whew haven't seen It Dove. The chimps get hurt. Like That People don't wanna watch it for That reason. And, it's mixed, right? Like They aren't treated We. That's sort of the whole premise There Not, they're not treated intentionally cruelly Yeah, but They are treated cruelly Yeah.


It's not an un uplifting show. I, you feel I at least felt bad for all the humans involved. And And, the chimps involved Yeah Yeah, it's, it was, it's hard. don watch the I. Think the only people I didn't feel bad for We the good guys. which is interesting. Why like I under I. I'm triggered by self-righteousness. It's a big I Know. But it's a big trigger for Me. Know I Know. It is. But sometimes I think That Canva kind of get and ad way of a good belief. Like these people And it. Agree. They We annoying there. We there We some people in there in this show. Whew work for Peta Whew I found annoying Okay. But They We doing the right thing.


Oh Yeah They did the right thing. They just didn't need to be so fucking Hi on themselves for doing It. And. Punitive And mean towards the woman. I. They didn't need all That stuff to rescue the chimp. They could have still filed all the court documents. And had the trial Yeah And like, but also she's being horrible to them. And, you don't feel That way about her, which is Fun 'cause she's totally disenfranchised. She I. She's not educated. These are lawyers. They're super We funded. Yeah. The amount of money They spend to get this animal And that They sue her to get the money back. Yeah, which has just felt punitive and don don't Know, but also They knew I would want them to have the same love for humans as They have for animals and, and I.


Don't think They Dove, that's my whole life. Yeah like I. Think it's crazy. But, but I Dove, you Know She, wasn lying, And lying and lying and lying and lying. And it and think at some point you're like, I don't. It gives a fuck about this person. You get sort of steadfast on your mission. Yeah, But like qualities. and there's a smugness there. wasn a big time. Smugness. I can't stand smugness there wasn a self-righteousness there. wasn a puni. Yeah and I think everything. She wasn doing. wasn wrong. Right? Me too. I Also think she's horrendously lonely. Same I. Think her son feels betrayed by her I. Think the whole situation. She it Wasn. So sad. She She. Reaped what? She Sowed. There's No winners and ad You. Know.


Yeah. She's not Yeah. So I would, I would think of it more like Yeah. I have to intervene with my kids all the time there. you know, I have to protect them from themselves or I have to help point out. But I don't need to Dove it with superiority or I. Canva, Dove. It with compassion. And understanding. Yeah. And still Dove the thing That needs doing. We. Your children are an I. Mean. That's so extreme. Of course you're gonna compassion. Example of a kind of disenfranchised, powerless. Not on my level. Intellectually. I would have an approach for somebody like That, right? That. I. I could have a kindness and ad patience for That. And still Dove the right, it's the look.


It's the exact same thing as we're we're always talking about with prisoners like Yeah. Yes. Dangerous people need to be removed from society. So That They don't hurt other people. Yes. But you don't need to hate the people. Whew, Dove, That and You don't need to punish them while they've been removed. And, you don't, you know, Yeah I mean I agree with all of That. I felt horrible for her. Like Yeah Know it wasn so sad. and and She wasn clearly so sad. And She got herself mauled by the end. which is so I mean. You have to just, you have to be honest with yourself about Whew. You're dealing with, you're dealing with somebody. Whew has full awareness of all these attacks. know And that chose to get into know a cage.


know with a male chimp. That. She didn't even Know. It's very, if anyone listened to the Munchausen episode, it's very, very similar to That. There's something very adjacent about It, Yes, Whew. It's all about receiving love. That won't leave You like Yeah. Creating an environment Whew you. You re somebody needs you so bad needs something needs you so badly. Yep. And, They can't leave you. Yep. And. Kids leave You. And. Obviously adults leave you exhibit A, you're moving. Yeah And me. Oh my God. Tell me. Maybe I should get a chimp. Maybe. Maybe That. cause You got You. Have the space know maybe That and you have a basement.


If They come for You, if Peta comes for You, That might solve all my abandonment issues. Know Okay. So I wasn a little harsh on them, but I, I have to also own the fact That like They We ultimately. Totally right. There is a moment. and ad Zocdoc, Whew. I'm like, I. Don't know. I don't Know. If Tonka should go with other chimps, if there if he's gonna get torn to shreds. And does He Really have heart disease? It seemed like He. Really had heart disease, but He didn't. He didn't I, but I wasn bought into That. Yeah, I. Don't know if She wasn bought into It or not. I, don We won She. wasn probably lying to herself. I Whew is so convoluted, But Yeah. But that he's so happy. Tonka Yeah. And mean at the very end and ad environment. He's supposed to be. and and he's like so happy.


And looks Yeah, And, That, wasn. Really sad. It's like so much of this chimp's light Wasn sitting in That fucking cage Yes. Oh, it's terrible. And We You. Think about like 94%, or isn't it? Or 99 or nine. It's even higher Than what She said. Yeah Shared. DNA I. Think it's 97 to humans. It's like, it's like a human living and ad cage. A cage like a prisoner. Exactly, Yeah. All bad Yeah. All just Really bad. How about won He? wasn like there We all these moments. Whew also I bet You could get misled by We. That's what happens. You get misled by them. They show all this intelligence and all these weird areas, Yeah. and you start to, this is what I'm guilty of with Lincoln.


It was like, she's so mature. She's so mature and that she's 11. Right? And it. Get a little taken aback by it. Sure. and that I have her go like Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. She's 11 Yeah. and and similarly like She hands, Tonka Tonka has gotten messy with Liz duty. And. He got duty all over the plexiglass enclosure. Yeah. and she's like, Tonka, you know, clean this up. If You want your Coca-Colas or whatever fucking terrible food, She I giving them And. She throws them the the, the towel And. He wipes it up and He just makes it way worse. But He understands. He made it way worse. She's like, that's not very good. And And that gets back in there. Yeah And. It's like, That stuff is so weird. You're watching this thing.


He's as compliant as my 9-year-old is, right? and He is doing about as good as Liz job as Delta does. Cleaning up a window. We, No, No. She's better than That. He. He was like a three-year old. What will Be like a three Yearold I. Think more than a I wanna go. Fine. Really. Yeah. He makes We, not He, but Travis would make himself dinner. Open the fridge, right? Get Liz item. Go to the microwave, put It and ad microwave. Go turn on Liz favorite TV show. I mean this. That wasn a 3-year-old can't Dove That. Yeah I. Guess you're right. Drink wine. Three year olds can't drink wine. We You have Xanax won. Find out They We given the thing Xanax I mean Jesus Christ. It wasn.


What a mess. wasn bad. But also in this show, so you're mainly, we're mainly seeing this one woman, Yeah. We're following this one woman, but also we, what's Her name? Isn't That crazy? Oh my God. did They not say it? you know the names of all the Chis? No They definitely said it. Tanya Haddock. Tanya Oh. yeah. Tanya. Thank. You. Tanya Okay. But that in, throughout this Tanya Harding. Tanya Haddock. Oh my God, it was so close. And. it was I. Mean I knew it wasn't. Tanya Harding wasn and Wasn wasn to Tiffany Haddish. Oh, we love Tiffany Hadd. We love her pod. So I know a sponsor. So We, throughout the series, you also meet other people.


Whew have chimps And their relationship. and there's one That people probably remember cause it wasn a big story. And it. Remember the story. This is Travis in Connecticut. Yes Yes, the woman had a chimp for many, many years. Yeah, He. wasn, sweetie Pie. Whole town, loved him. Whole town loved him. Police, We, all in photographs with him. Yes, And, And. that wasn like not wanting to He. wasn being ornery and She. He wanted to get out of the car. and They We, like, you're not, this isn't time to get outta the car. And He unlocked the door. And. He got out at an intersection. Oh, yeah, That. That Wasn. The first red flag. Yes Yes there wasn some red flags starting to happen.


And that That wasn like a four hour thing with the police, right? and the news We there. And They just had to like And. He'd roll around on the street again. It wasn't outwardly violent, but it wasn He wasn outta control. and They somehow, obviously They knew. This is what's so tricky too. It's like They. Know won They. Don't know. So They knew They couldn't pick him up and put him and ad car, right? That They would've gotten fucked up. Yeah, clearly. cause why did They sit there? Exactly for three hours while He, until He got himself back. and ad Car And know, I'm kind of surprised They didn't just dart him, But at That point, he's like the mascot and he's rolling around and being funny and it's inconvenient. But like, there we go. We gotta Playful Chimp and ad Road. They Dart. Like, like Roberts Polsky Darts ships. Like you're allowed to Dove That.


Sure, sure, sure. don don't know if the, the local New Haven police We equipped with Trak the darts They shoulda called Robert Polsky. So He. Anyway, he's a starting to act a little odd. He's getting Old Yeah. He's getting a Yeah or adolescent ornery And grumpy. and that Jack got rid of Liz InTown privileges. That's like step one, Right? And And that had to stay and ad house, it couldn't go anywhere. And He wasn getting more And that that dad died. Insulin. that, oh God. That. That's Really what off He. wasn. Completely inconsolable. He loved Liz dad so much. They drank wine together every night. And probably Pop Zani. He Probably like I Wondery. If He did He withdraw.


He. Canva. You imagine a chimp on Coke. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's horrifying. So. yeah, He wasn. Completely distraught. Yeah He doesn't Know what to Dove with these big feelings. He's Know contained and ad House. He's not allowed. And. He has a visitor. So Red flag number two is after Liz dad dies, her daughter comes by with her son. Or somehow Something Yeah. There's like a late teens or early twenties boy and ad mix Yeah And And Ton. Or Travis wants to play with him. Yeah And He goes over to him. and He just starts grabbing Liz arm and ad way. That's like, God, it's just so, it's scary. We know. It's s so impressive. What? We know Yeah. Like we've not been and ad Wild with a champ.


But everyone and ad Room knows and You watching know this is something different than Blake. Cause at first it's nor it was like everyone's kind laughing and that it like turns And Yeah. Nothing crazy is happening. It iss just like pulling on him. And, You see on the boy's face. Like He realizes this Is bad. He know. He's, he's Really and ad and ad. Tricky situation. Or it could turn Really quickly. and that's what's so fa that's what I'm Really interested in, was like, if you We describing That and ad Court report. We, what did He. Dove, how did you know I? Don't know. I can't tell You. But fucking everyone there knew. and anyone that's watching knows And. That's the part Whew. I'm like, oh, we're still so animal Yeah. Like We still have all we fucking know won. There's an issue.


Danger. Yeah. It's Really. Fascinating. Yeah. cause you grew up and ad City everyone. But You still Know Yeah. It's true. So that at one point he's Travis is being very insulin and the mom like, and can't Really get him out or something. Like She wasn. She needed reinforcements. So She called her friend, who's friends. Let's add Yeah. She's completely out of her mind. Distraught too. She just lost her husband. Yeah. No one. and ad House is doing We, Right? Okay, And, We. and she's just upset. That. She also can't bring Travis places. Travis to get pizza. And stuff. Yeah is you.


Oh, so She calls her friend over and to help her with Travis. and the friend has been over. Many, many old friend, good friend knows Travis We. Very We Yes, an aunt of sorts. Yes Yes. Exactly Brought him an Elmo, Which Elmo's I. Guess Travis's favorite. Yeah. He Loves Elmo. Boy. That. Really says something about the power of Elmo. 'cause That wasn, the human's favorite and It totally transcended species. We It didn't work. No, Although He brought it with him. did. Or wasn? It just next to the car. I. Can't remember if He brought it with Him. Him and I Think It wasn next to the car. Oh. yeah. So, so She gets out with this Elmo And that. So by that, He is outside.


He's out and ad Yard outside. He's out and ad yard by that. which why it don't Really. Get That. Part Yeah. He's supposed to be Yes. I. Can't remember how He got out. And She gets out of the car with this Elmo and He attacks her And. You hear the nine one one. Call of the mom. And. It is, It is so horrifying. I, I. I've heard it in my head many times since I like, can't unhear it. It's much. W I've at this point, we've all heard 1,000,009 one one calls from Dateline And, all the docs we watch And, it am putting That at the very top of the list of the most terrifying nine one one call for so much of what you're watching. You cannot relate to their mental state.


Yeah. You're like, how are They doing this? why are They? But the second the friend's being attacked, know She does click into complete reality. You gotta come and you gotta kill him. Yeah and She loves Travis. She says That. Yeah. But She know knows. There's No solution to this other than Travis has to be killed immediately. Yeah And She loves Travis Yeah. It flips so quick. Oh, but She I, which is a little comforting. Like know, you could almost See Know, but it's too, too Late. He's a good boy. But he's, he's Really hurting her. But he's a good boy. Don't bring Anette, bring Anette. Right? At least a dark gun. At least there's That. But it's, she's ignored so many signs. It's too late. She's screaming. He's eating her face.


Yeah. He's killing her. He's killing Her. He's killing her. Oh. yeah. Oh, it's, it was like horrific. It's horrific. It wasn so horrific. it was insane. Didn't die by saying That lived. By the way She lived, know She lost half of her blood. Her com face wasn completely removed. Yes I think parts of her limbs. And, maybe some finger They love to bite fingers off And faces. I mean They are I. Guess She showed her face on Oprah. Did you not see That part? What? I. I didn't I. See It's and ad final episode. I know, but They don't show it. Dove They Sh Okay. So They don't, but They did. And on, that's what I'm saying. On Oprah. They show the clip and ad stock. But They don't show her actually showing her face. But on the Oprah episode, She does. why? and, and She release She like reveals her veil.


and, And we Canva Dove. 20 minutes on That moment for me. why That an incredible part of That documentary Okay Cause Oprah And it believe this about her is a wonderful person who's brought Yes Lots of healing to People. And full amount of joy and healing to America. Also, She made some Really bad decisions. Yeah She did. Like all people, like of course, I mean That. wasn, That, wasn the most. Yeah. Like why Did She opportunistic terrible thing. I've seen Oprah Purdue Yeah make or ask She. Ask. Ask if She goes. everyone wants to see your face. Canva. We see your face. why it Know know. Don't make her Dove. That. You know, you know, I, Know, I, Know.


You're right. You know, oh my God. And She does It That wasn, Yeah That wasn. Very exploit. That wasn, That wasn. Jerry Springer. Yeah. But, but again, I love Oprah. Me too. You wanna be Really clear? It's almost just comforting. Like Yeah Yeah. everyone makes regrettable decisions. Yeah along the way. You're not gonna do 3000 episodes of a show. Yeah. And make the right decision every time. Yeah, but That wasn bad. That wasn not good. Again, talk about the entire thing is kind of just, it was, it was a depressing show. It's so depressing. I I almost didn't finish a few times. Yeah 'cause it wasn, Really hard to watch everything.


All of it. Daton, the That whole sadness, Toga, Travis Fox, all the chimps, And, Ball. Oh my God. It's just like, it's a lot. But it's psychologically so fascinating. We, The woman, Whew owned Travis Whew tore her friend's face off within months, went and bought another chimp. I know, I mean At That point, you're looking at like an addict. Like, wait, you OD'ed on this drug? You barely made It. You got outta the hospital. and 12 hours later, You We shooting the same amount of dope. Wow. This is a real Problem. and it's one thing, like for me, it's one thing if you got mauled and You did it Yeah.


If You want death by a chimp, sure, go nuts. But the fact That You caused That level of harm. And that you go back. Whoa. I don't know how. You, you must have to compartmentalize That guilt and ad way That is, is, oh, We. Those chimps are nasty. Yeah Yeah, They don't wanna kill you. They want to tear you. Know. They wanna shred You. you know, that's so They. Wanna take up their anger on You. why? It's emotional. A tiger's not emotional, right? A tiger's hungry, you moved. and ad way It triggered it was thing. Yeah We. Speaking of which, I just saw a compilation on Instacart. Oh, I. Think people have their kids. Dove. This what They. Step up to the glass window at the zoo.


Whew, there's a tiger or a lion. and the tiger's looking at the little child. And, And, They. Tell the kid to turn around and come towards them. And, the second They, turn their back. And. They're not looking at the lion or the tiger. They. Leap. Stop at the glass. This was like a thing. Ew. I don't. why? and and it's A compilation And. it was like, man, it's all about That eye contact. cause even for a little person, the the lions And, tigers aren't leaping as long as they're looking at 'em. Oh, the second They, stop looking it just like the instinct propels them to the glass. So if you encounter one, you Dove Dove. You. Just You. You. Stare at them. You keeps staring. Okay. Yeah.


Oh my God. I Actually We. That's what I gleam from this Instacart compilation of children. Sure. We. This is a ding, ding, ding. cause it went on a hike this morning. You did. I did As part of your training. We I skipped training. Today. So I went on the hike. Okay Griffith Yeah with Whew. I went by myself. Solo Yeah. And did You go to the observe. Yeah Hiked up to the observatory. And. It wasn kind of early cause. and It wasn Misty this morning. Yeah, it had like a, it had an eeriness tropical. Every time I've ever hiked Griffith Which is not very often. There's a ton of people. Yeah And it guess. 'cause it wasn early. There just wasn't That. Many Yeah And. it was like, oh my God.


Is this What We You think thinking mountain lion. A bad idea, scary humans is always my first Okay. But that I thought. Yeah. What if the an an there's an animal situation. So on my walk, I started looking up what? I like I already forgot what to Dove if I encounter a bear, right? So I had to look. That up. Okay. And. that I. Remember That, there's all these different things you Dove. If it's a brown bear or a black Bear. and I. Don't think We have any bears in there. So You, you're pretty safe on the bear front. I just didn't Know, And and Yeah. So I wasn a little freaked out. I. Don't even think We have a mountain lion anymore. know That P 21 or two died until We do. Yeah I. Guess that's true. He arrived. Yeah Yeah.


and that there wasn a coyote. Okay and that I. Think I saw another coyote. They're fine Though. I, Know. I Know I know. People say That. But remember That girl Whew got bit by the coyote. Whew wasn passed out. Cold on a, a driveway, huh? That wasn a aa Story. Yeah No. She wasn on her bike. I'm thinking of the woman. Whew left the sober house. Relapsed, came home to the sober house, passed out and ad driveway woke up with a coyote eating her Okay. We That. So That Coyote did still eat her just ffy a But Yeah, if you pass out up there and They think you're dead, they'll start Yeah. That's bad. The but also No. Remember the girl She wasn on her bike? And it wasn called like a coyo wolf or something.


Oh, I. Think She wasn running in Canva. I. Think She wasn running Or running or something. But that And that her boyfriend came on the whatever I think it wasn a wolf coyote hybrid. It wasn a coyo wolf. But that's how Dove I know this one wasn't a coo wolf. Canva won. We don't have any wolfs across the street. I don, you know, Whew. Did you see any arm cherries? No I didn't. Oh wow. We. I didn't. They didn't talk to me If I did Okay. cause it don't think I've been on a hike and ad last three years. Whew I don't see an armchair. It Wasn pretty desolate. I did not see many people at all. Did you get any kind of a spiritual nature thing? Whew, you know, You're in, in fear. Too much. I. Think so. Okay. Oh my God. Is That your truck?


We? Let's find out. We. Oh, That car sounded closer than your truck. I. Think you're right. Anyway, but Yeah. So, so, so that's a ding, ding, ding. I sent you a Instacart of your favorite place. Cedar Point. Yes. You did? How did That Actually, it's a ding, ding, ding. cause this is for Halle Berry. Cedar Point comes up, obviously We. She's a Buckeye. Yeah. Yeah and I.

You remember my Papa Bob story? My Papa Bob always took a nap on Saturday afternoon and He in and ad back bedroom. They called It. Sure. and after Liz nap, He would take us to K-Mart.


Oh And. We got one trip to Kmart every time we visited. Wow. and we got a hot wheel. That wasn like the budget. Oh, don don't Know what David got. But I always got a a hot wheel. It. wasn like a dollar 99. Oh And. it couldn't wait to get That hot wheel. and David couldn't wait to get whatever He wasn gonna do, get And. So Papa Bob would say like, oh, I'm gonna take him a nap and ad back bedroom. Oh, oh. you know, I'll be up by whatever, maybe even wake me up at one Okay. So we go in there And. it starts with us going Papa Papa's two or whatever time wasn p Papa Papa know we're screaming. Know I want you to know at No point, did we think he's dead? You didn't. cause we Canva hear him snoring. Oh God. He. If you think I had some throat clearing issues. And some He had a nose.


One That went like this. It wasn like He wasn doing That all the time. Oh. yeah, definitely sounds like some sleep apnea. We I did No. That wasn won. He. wasn awake, He wasn cousin. Like, oh, trying to get whatever. So we knew He wasn alive. Right? Thank God. So it escalated to a scream. Papa, wake up Papa. We're screaming. As long as we Canva we're screaming in Liz ear. What? And. He's not waking up. We're we're, we're we're shaking. Liz body And. He is not waking up. And, He, snoring. He. Just I mean fuck. He must have been so tired. I mean He worked at Wondery Bread Bakery all week long, carrying bags of flour. Yeah And He had these two kids with them on the weekend. I Wondery. If He had sleep paralysis, Yeah, I I. Think He had something going on.


Yeah I mean it's insane. This is the most one of I think the most vivid memory of my Papa. Bob And. David remembers it. Exactly the same, which is comforting. and David gets the idea. And. Mind you, I am probably eight at the time. And. David is 13. So I'm taking Liz. I'm definitely following Liz lead. Yeah. And. He We know Splash water and ad face. Oh, but we think That might get He. He might be angry. Yeah Chuck. So P David says, let's get, let's get a wet washcloth and we'll put on Liz face like Okay won. We run into the bathroom. And, we make a wet washcloth and we bring it over. And We, lay it across Liz face. Nothing. Nothing. Baba. Wake up. David's like, let's get another one. So We I. Don't know what the logic wasn at this point, but I, wasn and ad process of putting on at least the fifth We No wash cloth over Liz face, oh my God.


Sounds like the most insane story. but Yeah, if I called my brother right now, He would tell you the exact same story. And my Papa Bob. Finally, wasn suffocating. Yeah. I. wasn gonna say that's which scary, which, which didn't think of at all as kids. Oh my God. cause it wasn completely over Liz nose, And, Liz face. And And that started suffocating. And. And that woke up suffocating and I wasn just putting on this other one. and He, it wasn't like a punch like He wound back, but He came up and He and You Know He wasn a boxer, oh God. And He punched me and ad stomach as I wasn putting this cloth on. and I flew off the bed. Oh, No landed on the ground. And it had the wind knocked outta of me. Oh, And. So that I wasn, you know, know You, get the wind knocked outta you won.


You're a little kid, you think you're dying. Oh my God. So was like Papa. Bob's gasping for air. And just left up. and that He has punched me across the room. And. David watches the whole thing. and Know, I'm on the ground going like You know won You. Think He. Can't catch your breath. Yeah. Aw, we went to Kmart. Oh, like That didn't, did He, Did He feel bad? Or did He feel like Justin We boys You are gonna kill me boys. You, Canva. you know, like He wasn, like, what the hell's going, why are there all these watch? Oh my God. And He, bad He He had fucking punched. You punched me Across the across the room. Yeah. Oh man, poor pup, sweet Papa Bob. Another great one. This one's way quicker. My mom and dad dropped my brother off. By the way. This is in keeping with what I just told you.
