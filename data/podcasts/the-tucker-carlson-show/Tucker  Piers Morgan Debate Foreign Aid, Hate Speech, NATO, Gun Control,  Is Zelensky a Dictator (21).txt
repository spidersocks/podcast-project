0 (1s):
Beer, Morgan. Thank you. Sorry. Telling off colored jokes off

1 (4s):
Camera.

0 (5s):
Thank you so much. No, my pleasure. We're in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We are, I'm not even gonna ask you how you wind up here, but I'm glad to see you. Well,

1 (13s):
We're both here for the same reason. Actually.

0 (16s):
We've both gone into the oil business. Yes. I never, yeah. So I want to ask you, I wanna start just on a very hostile note. Mm. Okay. 'cause I feel like that's a good way. Good to frame. Good, good.

1 (26s):
Let's, let's start. How we, me to continue?

0 (29s):
Zelensky is a hero. How could you say that?

1 (52s):
I don't agree with you about him. All, all Ukraine I went to, I went to interview him in, in Kyiv, And he is an extraordinary story. Obviously, this comedian who becomes president, having played a,

0 (1m 3s):
The piano comedian

1 (1m 4s):
Who was The president in a, in a comedy show. Right. And I've seen what you said about it. I mean, what's interesting to me on a bigger picture about Ukraine, Russia, your views, a lot of conservative views in America is that 30 years ago, there would've been no element of resistance from the conservative side about taking on a Russian dictator who'd invaded a European country. I know it's a lot more complicated. I know the history, but a lot of very smart people on, a lot of people you've interviewed. And you know, I do learn a lot each time I talk to about all the history. Obviously my brother was a British Army colonel. My sister married a British Army colonel. They've all engaged in conflicts around, around the world. And so it, it's complicated. There's no doubt that on the Russian side, they believe they were provoked into doing this.

1 (1m 46s):
I know that you have sympathy with that view. There's also no doubt from the Ukrainian side that they believe since the nineties they've been this sovereign democratic country, albeit not perfect, you think deeply flawed. I think they've been imperfect trying to improve. And Zelensky has actually, I think, been a force for good, not bad. But ultimately what's happened now is that you have a situation. Whereas Donald Trump told me recently, you know, they, it's just the mowing fields now where you have thousands of young men being killed often on a daily basis, both sides. And no one's winning this war, it seems to me. And if anyone is gonna win it, it's likely to be Russia, not Ukraine.

1 (2m 29s):
And then what happens? And that concerns me enormously. If the West allows Putin to just take the land he's taken, what guarantee do we have? He won't try and take the rest of Ukraine. He took Crimea, he's back for more. I think he wants the whole of Ukraine. I think he won't stop there if he's allowed to get it. I think he's a pretty ruthless, evil Russian dictator. I, how

0 (2m 51s):
Are we defining Just to, to find the terms. Yeah. So we can follow the same. Yeah. What's a dictator?

1 (2m 57s):
A dictator to me is somebody, well, I would start by saying you have no respect for democratic norms election, a free and fair election.

0 (3m 8s):
So like, an unelected leader would be a dictator. Well,

1 (3m 10s):
You wouldn't argue that Putin, for example, has free and fair elections.

0 (3m 14s):
No, I I I've never, I'm not that interested actually. Are you not in, not really. It's not my country. I'm interested in my leaders, whether, you know, they have the consent of, of their people. I, it's not of great interest to me. Whether of, I, I I do think Putin's like way more popular than, you know, Joe Biden to his people. Yes. More popular than Russia, than Biden was ever popular. I wouldn't

1 (3m 36s):
Dispute that. But why, why are you so against Zelensky?

0 (3m 39s):
No, I'm just trying to understand when you, you dismiss Putin as a dictator, which totally fair, I guess, but I'm just trying to understand what you mean by dictator. So the first criterion for dictatorship is that you're not elected. And what else? 'cause Zelensky iss obviously not elected either. Yeah.

1 (3m 55s):
I your,

0 (3m 56s):
So I'm just trying to kind of figure out what you're talking about. Well,

1 (3m 58s):
Your, well your comparison with Zelensky and Putin over the last two years, I found baffling because you seem to think there's some moral equivalence between the two. And Zelensky hasn't illegally invaded a another country. Do you not have a problem with what? Well,

0 (4m 12s):
Hold on, I just wanna know what a dictator is. I just wanna know. I mean, I met, you know, maybe he's a better guy than Putin or whatever. And you could say some things about one or not the other, but like, if we're just gonna define dictator, the first feature of a dictator is he's not elected. So Zelensky is not elected. He's also, well, he's banned a religious denomination. He's murdered his political opponents. He has banned a language group. Those all seem like fe features of dictatorship to me. Now he has the support of the British intelligence agencies. That doesn't mean he is not a dictator, though. That sounds like a dictator. I mean, if, if I gave you a piece of paper and I'm like, he's some qualities of a European leader, you would say, well, that guy, that's not legitimate.

0 (4m 53s):
That guy's a dictator. I can't support that. But his name's Zelensky, And he was once a comedian And he does my show. So he's not a dictator. I think it's a dictator.

1 (5m 1s):
Well, I, I would argue that if you look at the history of Ukraine since the nineties, since it became a want of a better phrase, democratic country, as they would say, well, I mean by the same criteria you support Putin being popular in his country, I think just under 90% of Ukrainians voted for it. You, you wouldn't dispute that.

0 (5m 21s):
Well, first of all, the country had a coup sponsored by the United States government, the CIA a in 2014. So everything that happened subsequent to that, I don't think we could call part of the Democratic process. But Gi Zelensky personally is not elected. He's not an elected leader. He rules by force. There's no election that gives him legitimacy. So that's not a defense of Putin. It's merely an attack on the idea that Putin's the only dictator in this contest. Do you think, how is Zelinsky not a

1 (5m 51s):
Dictator, do you think? Putin's a dictator,

0 (5m 53s):
I guess. Yeah. Hmm. I mean, I guess, I mean, I, if I stand up outside the Kremlin and say down with Vladimir Putin, I listen, I'm probably in trouble. I certainly, that's why I don't live in Russia.

1 (6m 1s):
Right? I I certainly think that Ukraine has had a lot of corruption. No, no.

0 (6m 4s):
But, but Zelensky legitimate. How is he legitimate if he's not elected? Well, how could you support an unelected leader?

1 (6m 8s):
Well, he is The president of the country.

0 (6m 10s):
Well, he calls himself that. But there's no election that made him president. He blew past the election and said, oh, there's a war. I can't, we can't have an election. We're gonna change the constitution. So how is that a legitimate leader? How could you support something like that? That seems, I don't know, like a dictatorship.

1 (6m 23s):
Well, I would categorize my support for him as supporting him against an illegal invasion by Russia.

0 (6m 28s):
So this is, this is like why we support Stalin against Hitler. Because,

1 (6m 31s):
Well, in a way we had debate

0 (6m 32s):
Bad of Stamon speak good. But no, Stalin's also a dictator. So like, how about we just don't support dictators if we're against supporting dictators? Or You can take my position, which is, I don't want a dictatorship in my own country because I live in a free country. But we're gonna have relations with the country that helps us most up to a certain limit. We're not gonna like be allies with Stalin. 'cause that's too evil. We're not, you know, Winston Churchill or, you know, FDR or something. We, we are not gonna go that far. But in general, we will deal with countries that help us. But when we start having moral conversations about other countries, then we have to stick by our own standards. And by your standard, you're supporting a dictator. No, I'm, I wonder how You can do that. Pi Morgan,

1 (7m 6s):
I'm not saying they're morally pure in Ukraine. I'm not saying they're not riddled with, but how is you not a dictator? No, no. Here's my point to you. My defense of them blood

0 (7m 13s):
Thirsty dictator,

1 (7m 13s):
My blood thirsty dictator, my defense of them is based on the illegal invasion by Russia. You and I can argue about whether Russia was goaded and provoked into doing that. I do not think anything justifies what they actually did. Okay. That,

0 (7m 26s):
That's a, that's a totally fair position. I mean, I guess I disagree, sort of, but I don't think what you're saying is crazy at all. But the point I was, how is that more illegal than running a country without an election and banning a religious denomination? I don't understand that. So yeah, put, you could certainly say Putin did a lot of bad things. I would readily agree to that from the extent, to the extent I understand it. But we're supporting my government and your government particularly, or supporting this dictator in Ukraine, who's oppressing Christians, who is banning people's native language and books in their native language. He's a book burner. And like, that's totally cool. 'cause we hate Putin. That's not totally cool, is it?

1 (8m 2s):
So would you just let Putin take Ukraine? I would

0 (8m 4s):
Say, let's have an election in Ukraine and let the Ukrainian people elect their own leader and get rid of the midget dictator who now oppresses them Zelensky. And I would definitely not support a guy who's not elected as a Democratic figure. Because by definition he's not, by definition, I don't care who his enemies are. He's not worth calling a beacon of democracy if he doesn't even have an why not have an election in Ukraine today? 'cause we've got a war, we had elections in our country during the Second World War. So did you, like, why, why not hold him to democratic

1 (8m 37s):
Standards? I've got no problem with saying he should have an election. What

0 (8m 39s):
About banning a Christian denomination? Yeah. I

1 (8m 41s):
Don't agree with any of those things. Well,

0 (8m 43s):
How could we ever support that?

1 (8m 44s):
Because ultimately it's, we're paying for that. Because ultimately we have to make a calculation about whether we're happy with Russia invading what is a sovereign European democratic country in the same, well,

0 (8m 54s):
It was not a sovereign country. It was controlled by the United States. Well, that we installed their government in a coup in 2014. But they have, it's a very puppet of the United States in Great Britain. But they are, they're not sovereign at all. Do

1 (9m 3s):
You think they're a democracy?

0 (9m 4s):
Well, they're leaders not elected. So by definition, they're not a democracy. It may be a great place to vacation or they've got, you know, we're getting a lot of money from, you know, defense deals or they've got pretty women. Lots of great things you could say about the Ukrainians. They're actually great people from what I can tell. I know a bunch of them. They're awesome. But they're definitely not a democracy.

1 (9m 20s):
Should Putin just take the land?

0 (9m 22s):
No.

1 (9m 23s):
So what happens?

0 (9m 24s):
I don't know. We should stop paying for the slaughter of the entire Ukrainian population. 'cause

1 (9m 28s):
You know, I mean, either he's allowed to take it or he isn't either. We now say, yes, you take. Why is

0 (9m 33s):
It up to us? I don't understand. We're not,

1 (9m 35s):
Well, who else can stop it? Well, I don't

0 (9m 37s):
Know. I mean, when, you know, Congo invades its neighbors, like it's not axiomatic that we should be involved in. Well,

1 (9m 44s):
When dam invaded Kuwait, why did America go and support that? Did you,

0 (9m 48s):
'cause there's

1 (9m 48s):
Oil here. Did you support that?

0 (9m 50s):
Well, I was in college and drunk.

1 (9m 52s):
Did you basically agree with it?

0 (9m 53s):
Yeah. I mean, I had a lot of dumb ideas.

1 (9m 55s):
Storming, storming war. I thought

0 (9m 56s):
It was okay to drink beer in the morning.

1 (9m 58s):
Do you think, looking back at it was, was it right to do what America did with the allies? British were there too.

0 (10m 3s):
I don't know

1 (10m 4s):
A spell from Kii. It wasn't a NATO country.

0 (10m 8s):
Well, that was, I mean, that's the kind of war that in theory I would support you say we have, you know, energy interest in this region and we wanna keep it stable. When you start getting theoretical, like we're preserving democracy by supporting dictators with,

1 (10m 21s):
We say energy from, from Ukraine, though this is an energy component to that.

0 (10m 24s):
Maybe. I, I don't see that.

1 (10m 25s):
I'm just trying, what I'm thinking is that the,

0 (10m 27s):
I don't like is the moral overlay because it's fatuous and fraudulent. Mm. He's not, this is not a democratic country. He is a dictator. We've supported many dictators who've supported Mobutu in Zaire, which no longer exists because he was a bork against the Soviets we thought. Right. And a million others.

1 (10m 41s):
No, but you've already said that you would support the expulsion of Sudan from Q eight.

0 (10m 46s):
I don't know that I would

1 (10m 47s):
Led by America. Well, you just said you did, right? So, well,

0 (10m 50s):
No, I said I was drunk in college. I haven't really thought I said, but theoretically You can make the case energy. 'cause they had the United States. We need cheap energy. Sure. We're gonna go to war to preserve sheep energy. You know, that's not a crazy thing to say. Okay, maybe I could support that.

1 (10m 60s):
Right. So what's the difference I thought within that and what's happened with Russia and Ukraine? Well, because we need Ukraine's energy.

0 (11m 5s):
Justification has,

1 (11m 6s):
We need Ukraine's wheat. I think we're, we do, we don't, 25% of the world's wheat comes outta Ukraine.

0 (11m 11s):
We're actually not I, I'm aware. Which is why you probably don't want to kill all of its farmers and sell all of its farmland, which is what we've allowed to happen. Zelensky we'll

1 (11m 19s):
Kill the Russians are,

0 (11m 21s):
Well, no, this war wouldn't exist if it weren't for the money in arms that we're sending to Ukraine. It would've been over in one day. It never would've started if we hadn't said, when

1 (11m 28s):
You say over, what do you mean what would've happened?

0 (11m 31s):
I don't think, I think it's very clear, and I don't know that anyone would disagree with this, that Russia would not have invaded Eastern Ukraine. If the Biden administration hadn't sent Kamala Harris to the Munich Security Conference in February of 2022 to say, Zelensky on camera, we're gonna make you a NATO country. Meaning we're gonna put American NATO arms on the Russian border. Like you would not allow Chinese. Well, your country probably would, but you shouldn't allow Chinese missiles in Scotland peering over Hadrian's wall aimed at London. You'd be like, no, it's our, you know, you can't do that on our border. And the Russians like, no, you can't do that on our border. And we're like, shut up. You're Russian. You have no right to determine what happens on your border.

0 (12m 11s):
Piss off.

1 (12m 13s):
But if, but if the,

0 (12m 15s):
That actually

1 (12m 15s):
Happened. But my point is, if the defense of expelling Saddam Hussein from QA was that we have energy interest in that country.

0 (12m 23s):
Well, no one ever said that. And

1 (12m 24s):
We should kick him out. But that's obviously what we all knew. And it was done very quickly in competently by General Norman short scarf. And it was great, great military operation. But the but surely the principle in ideology is not different. And what's interesting is, every I, every, well, every Republican, every Republican back, yeah, they're

0 (12m 40s):
Idiots. Hang on. They support the Ukraine.

1 (12m 43s):
No, I mean every Republican in 91 would've supported that conflict.

0 (12m 47s):
Well, whether or not

1 (12m 49s):
Now

0 (12m 49s):
S Republican members of the Senate support something is, IM

1 (12m 51s):
Supportive.

0 (12m 52s):
It, I can promise you every

1 (12m 53s):
Republican voter I think would've supported it. Whereas what's interesting

0 (12m 55s):
35 years ago, I'm just saying,

1 (12m 57s):
So what's changed is a lot of Republican supporters now conservatives in America are against supporting Ukraine anymore. And I'm curious about that change in what has been, what, 35 years there's been a real sea change. And it may be because Americans are understandably war weary. They're fed up with spending a lot of money on foreign wars, foreign conflicts. There's a good argument. America hasn't really won a foreign war since World War ii. You know, you look at from Vietnam onwards, endless quagmires, endless problems, Iraq, Afghanistan and so on and so on. And I look at what's happened in Ukraine, and I'm just looking at it pragmatically, do we just let a Russian, do we let Russia let at the moment by Vladimir Putin, who are we categorize as a dictator?

1 (13m 43s):
Do we let him just take what he wants? Even if he uses it and dresses it all ups? I'm doing this because I fear about NATO encroachment, which may well be, may well be his reasoning may well be his reasoning. Okay. But many people think it's not his reasoning. Okay. And they, many people think,

0 (13m 58s):
I'm just

1 (13m 58s):
Saying like, they think, why

0 (13m 59s):
Would you want to put us missiles on Russia's border? I don't understand.

1 (14m 3s):
'cause it's so obviously

0 (14m 4s):
Unacceptable for any sovereign nation to

1 (14m 6s):
Tolerate that. Here's the other part of the argument. He

0 (14m 8s):
Has nuclear weapons. Why would we want that?

1 (14m 9s):
But a lot of PE confused people. But we have nuclear weapons too. A lot of the argument You guys

0 (14m 13s):
Have nuclear weapons, huh?

1 (14m 15s):
We do Nuclear, yes. We have nuclear weapons.

0 (14m 18s):
Why?

1 (14m 19s):
Why nuclear deter

0 (14m 21s):
Great Britain has nuclear weapons. Yes,

1 (14m 23s):
We do.

0 (14m 24s):
Do you think that's a good idea?

1 (14m 25s):
Yes. Absolutely. You know why

0 (14m 27s):
You're freaking me out? If,

1 (14m 28s):
If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, they wouldn't have been invaded. You. Can we agree on that? We told them to give up. Their nuclear deterrent wouldn't

0 (14m 36s):
Have been invaded. We told if the West hadn't said, we're going to use you as a staging ground for intimidating Russia. Like, why would we wanna do that? Why not just allow, what we've done is pushed Russia into the Chinese public. And

1 (14m 47s):
Many people would say, how does that help us? Many people in that region say, actually what's happened to Ukraine is precisely why they should have been in NATO. Because if they had been in NATO, ping wouldn't have invaded them. Okay. And also they say, people say that also say, if we hadn't collectively basically bullied Ukraine into giving up their nuclear deterrent, he wouldn't have done it either. 'cause they would've had a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. This is super

0 (15m 9s):
Crazy. Is it crazy? Yes, it is

1 (15m 11s):
Crazier than your theories.

0 (15m 13s):
Well, actually, I, I don't, I don't, I don't think, I mean, I have a million theories, but these are not among them. It's not a theory to say that Russia moved into Eastern Ukraine because the United States wouldn't give up on pushing for Ukraine and mission into NATO when NATO did not want Ukraine. But

1 (15m 29s):
There's also

0 (15m 30s):
The criteria for admission.

1 (15m 31s):
So, but I think you're only giving half a picture. I'm not, I'm not oblivious to that. But I would add this component to it, which is also not surely beyond the realms of fantasy. The Vladimir Putin knows that a lot of that part of eastern Ukraine that still speak Russian, he has resented the breakup of the Soviet Union famously. And that actually he wanted to take back land that he believes banning people should, should belong to Russia in their language, should belong to Russia.

0 (15m 55s):
Okay.

Liberty Safe (15m 56s):
In general, possessions are overrated. But there are some things you really would not want stolen. And to me, family shotguns, including a whole bunch of 'em I got from my father, are at the top of that list. So I keep my dad's shotguns in a Liberty safe. 'cause it's safe and it's also really attractive. Liberty safe just created something really cool. It's a limited edition safe that commemorates the inauguration of Donald Trump, America's 47th president.

It's the special 47 edition. It features a one of a kind artwork that pays homage to The President. It's very, very cool. Not all safes are created equal. There are plenty out there.

1 (17m 25s):
Okay. Do you accept that? I, I

0 (17m 26s):
Think it's true of, look, I'm not an expert. I've interviewed Putin. Mm. You know, I've been there a couple of times. I don't speak Russian. So I hope I don't get over my skis and pretend to know things that I don't. But what's very obvious is they have an interest and have for over 300 years in controlling Crimea Crimea, where their fleet is based. They had a referendum in Crimea that people, Crimea are Russian and wanna remain part of the Russian Federation. So he didn't take Crimea. It's Russian. It's filled with Russians. They had a referendum that nobody disputes. People should be allowed to choose their own government. That's the basic preceptive democracy.

1 (18m 2s):
He did take Crimea. Okay.

0 (18m 3s):
Should people be allowed to choose their own government? Yes. Okay. So the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to align with the Russian government. So that's illegitimate. Why?

1 (18m 14s):
When did they do that?

0 (18m 18s):
Right after the coup in 15, I think. Right?

1 (18m 20s):
So after they'd been invaded. Why do you think, why do, well, why do you think, why do you think so many Russians vote for Putin in Russia?

0 (18m 27s):
I don't think it was invaded. Russia has controlled Crimea for 300 years.

1 (18m 31s):
Yeah, but it wasn't, I mean it is, they are Russians voting there. It wasn't, it wasn't Russia's. And in the same way that that, that you say with the people of Crimea voted overwhelming and favor. Of course they did. They would've been killed if they hadn't. Same way as in Russia

0 (18m 43s):
In a secret ballot. Well,

1 (18m 44s):
Same way Russia.

0 (18m 44s):
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. So you're saying that the election was conducted under duress and people's votes were known to the Russian government? No, I don't think that's true. I'm saying think

1 (18m 53s):
It was a secret power. I'm saying it's exactly the same way that people in Russia vote for Putin. You think it's an overwhelming show of support for him? A lot of it is driven by fear. Oh, okay. That

0 (19m 1s):
May or may not be true. I don't know. But the only measure, the only thing that's true, only the only measure we have of popular consent is an election. And when conducted by secret ballot, if we think it's not being, it's not the 2020 election. It's like kind of a legitimate election. That's what we go with. And I'm ju is there, have you ever met anybody who believes that if a free and fair referendum were held once again in Ukraine, that Ukraine would vote the Ukraine? I mean, rather than CR Crimean would vote to align with Zelensky, the Zelensky government in kipp? I don't think so. It was 97%. Look, I'm just saying self-determination is the core idea in democracy. They don't have it in Ukraine because they haven't had an election.

0 (19m 42s):
They ignore the election because it's run by a dictator called Zelensky. If you wanted to say he's a dictator, that's fine. You support a dictator. The US your government has supported many dictators. So is mine. That's kind of a fact of life. There are very few democratically elected leaders. Sometimes even our leaders aren't really democratically elected as you know. I just don't like the moral bullshit that attaches to all of this. That's fair enough. Where we tell the population we're on the side of democracy. And he's Winston

1 (20m 6s):
Churchill. I don't claim, I don't claim his mother Teresa against hit. No, but you

0 (20m 9s):
Have though. You've like, he's a marvelous person.

1 (20m 12s):
I like him. I'm allowed to, aren't I?

0 (20m 14s):
I guess you like dictators. I've never said a Putin. He's a marvelous person. 'cause like, he's a little dictator for me. I, I think he's really smart. I admire what he's done to Russia. But I'm not gonna sniff his jock. 'cause he's kind of a dictator. But you're like, oh, I love that Zelensky. He's so

1 (20m 30s):
Great. I do like him.

0 (20m 31s):
How can you like a man who's a dictator?

1 (20m 34s):
I don't think he's a dictator. In

0 (20m 35s):
What sense? He's not elected. He rules by force. He rules with guns. He kills his opponents. He's assassinated a ton of people. Including, you know, I, I know someone he tried to assassinate. In fact, how is that we're supporting? Do you feel a little guilty for supporting

1 (20m 52s):
Someone like that? No, I don't really. No. In fact, I think we should try and do more to help him win.

0 (20m 57s):
How rich do you think he's gotten from this

1 (20m 59s):
War? I have no idea.

0 (20m 60s):
Does it bother you that he's gotten rich?

1 (21m 1s):
He's not as rich as Vadi and Putin?

0 (21m 4s):
Well, I mean, if all comparisons are to Putin, then all bets are off. Right?

1 (21m 7s):
Putin is, Putin is financially raped and pilled his country for maybe,

0 (21m 11s):
I don't know, maybe I don't as an accountant.

1 (21m 13s):
Okay, let's see. He has, he's got a personal net worth of a hundred billion rubles,

0 (21m 18s):
Whatever. It's, I guess how we would know that. But great. He does. He's evil. We'll, we'll just, we'll just stick with that. But the question is, why would you support personally a dictator who's gotten rich on a war in his country who bans a Christian denomination and who murders his political?

1 (21m 33s):
Well he literally only been the leader. Does that

0 (21m 35s):
Bother you at all?

1 (21m 36s):
Well, he beli with his country for two years.

0 (21m 38s):
He

1 (21m 39s):
Didn't get, he's done a lot of

0 (21m 40s):
Oppression in two

1 (21m 41s):
Years. He didn't get rich on corruption in two years.

0 (21m 43s):
But can I ask you, when you talked to his,

1 (21m 45s):
Peter has been doing this for 30

0 (21m 46s):
Years. Say, why don't you have an election? Why don't you stop murdering your political opponents? Why don't you let people practice their Christian denomination? Why don't you let Russian speakers speak Russian and read Russian books? That's what non dictators did. Did

1 (21m 57s):
You say any of that to Peter? Of course not. Why not?

0 (21m 60s):
Because I'm not his friend. Hmm. I don't have the relationship with Putin that you have with Zelensky. I didn't tweet after my interview. You're a very handsome man. I love you. I

1 (22m 7s):
Love you. I didn't call him a very handsome man. I think you did. I don't think he's a very handsome man. Actually,

0 (22m 12s):
Hot Hot is maybe what you said.

1 (22m 14s):
I don't think I called him hot. Okay.

0 (22m 15s):
Well you said I really admire you and I think, but you

1 (22m 16s):
Asking me to ask all the questions. Zelensky, you didn't ask Putin. 'cause he's

0 (22m 19s):
A personal friend of yours. I'm not friends with Putin. I'm just a guy who showed

1 (22m 22s):
Up personal friends with Zelensky. I admire his, I

0 (22m 25s):
Read your Twitter feed.

1 (22m 26s):
I admire him. I

0 (22m 27s):
You can't fool me, Peter.

1 (22m 28s):
You can't miscategorize me. I don't, I'm not a friend of his. I've only met him once. But I do admire his fortitude as a leader. I love the fact he stayed in Kyiv when the Russians went in. He could have fled. Many would've done that position. Everyone thought the Russians would win in a few days. Yeah, they didn't. I agree. I do admire the fortitude that he showed as a lead, a leader. Those characteristics I like doesn't mean he's, I

0 (22m 48s):
Think you called him a magnificent leader. In fact, I'm pretty sure

1 (22m 50s):
Because I think he has been.

0 (22m 51s):
Okay. So I'm just asking since I, I didn't call Putin a magnificent leader at all,

1 (22m 57s):
But nor did you ask him any of the questions that you want me to ask. No.

0 (22m 59s):
That I didn't feel like I, I didn't wanna do what everybody does, which is, you're so

1 (23m 3s):
Glad

0 (23m 3s):
Bad flat Ander Putin meaning I'm so good. I'm gonna give you a moral extra. I'm like, whatever. It's your country country's actually doing great. I was super impressed by Moscow. I recommend it to everybody just 'cause it's beautiful and orderly, which I like. I'm not moving there. They don't have freedom of speech, which is a prerequisite for me. But I didn't feel like that was my job. I just wanna hear what the guy says. We're fighting a war against him and no one's heard him speak.

1 (23m 24s):
Why do you believe him?

0 (23m 26s):
I don't know that I do.

1 (23m 27s):
Do you know? I mean, you believe his reasoning.

0 (23m 28s):
I believe something. You

1 (23m 29s):
Believe the reasoning for the war. You're fully all in on the Russian. Well,

0 (23m 32s):
There's kind of no question about that.

1 (23m 34s):
You all the

0 (23m 34s):
Questions about that. I don't really think so. I don't think any informed person, I mean, the Bill Burns the head.

1 (23m 39s):
Only 10% of people in Eastern Ukraine actually want Russia to take them over.

0 (23m 44s):
Okay. I don't, I don't know how we know that. But I, I believe that. But it

1 (23m 46s):
Doesn't. Well, it's a poll. Same poll. You, you know, you, you credit me about Crimea Point is,

0 (23m 50s):
Well that was a poll. It was an election. The, the

1 (23m 51s):
Vast, which

0 (23m 51s):
Are critical to democracy. Okay. I don't dunno if you knew that, but the vast, when you're a man Cent

1 (23m 55s):
Leader, should an election is a poll. They're called polls.

0 (23m 58s):
An election is a poll. A poll is not an election. Right. So there are different criteria for polls.

1 (24m 2s):
Well, a poll can be an election. Yes.

0 (24m 5s):
Now we're getting metaphysical. But I would just say, I would just say if you believe in democracy, you believe in elections. If you have a leader who's not elected, he's not a democratic leader, he's a dictator. Which is okay, that's fine. It's a foreign country. I wouldn't call any dictator. Magnificent. Just 'cause it seems a little, how could

1 (24m 20s):
Zelensky have an election in the middle of a war out of interest?

0 (24m 23s):
I don't know. How did, how did Franklin Roosevelt do that in the middle of Second World War? How, how did he do that?

1 (24m 28s):
Because no one had invaded America.

0 (24m 31s):
Okay. Well, but

1 (24m 33s):
How about the, so the people could actually vote.

0 (24m 35s):
Well,

1 (24m 35s):
There are people, you've got half of half of Ukraine. There

0 (24m 37s):
Are people making billions of dollars.

1 (24m 38s):
Half of Ukraine is business in

0 (24m 39s):
Kiev today. How about the non occupied parts of the country? Just make a good faith effort to have an election. But he doesn't want to because I, I think he's pretty darn unpopular because he is a lackey of Western powers who sold his country out. And Ukrainians know perfectly well that he's getting rich. And so is the entire leadership. I was in portable France two weeks ago, which is probably the richest town in Europe. It's a ski town in France near Geneva. And everybody at the Airme store was Ukrainian using my money to buy a hundred thousand dollars handbags. Nobody seems to care about that. I care, because that's not freedom fighting. That's grifting. That's theft. And everybody in Europe knows that. And you know that too. Go to Romania. All their, you know, high-end car dealerships are sold out because Ukrainians have bought the cars.

1 (25m 22s):
So, to be clear, when like, what the hell is this? So when, okay, well, so when Putin invaded Ukraine, you'd have given him what he wants. Take whatever you want.

0 (25m 30s):
Well, as I've, as I've said, and I really mean it from my heart. I mean, I have no kind of, I'm not getting rich from this. So I'm saying what I sincerely believe. Sure. Which is pushing Ukraine to join NATO. When NATO doesn't want Ukraine. There's no strategic reason. No actual reason to have Ukraine, NATO, or to have NATO at all. We shouldn't have NATO at all.

1 (25m 49s):
Oh, that's preposterous.

0 (25m 51s):
What's the point of NATO to

1 (25m 53s):
Keep Keefe, keep the Soviets

0 (25m 54s):
Vedic Western Europe. Oh, well it's been 35 years since they existed as

1 (25m 57s):
To keep peace.

0 (25m 59s):
How's that worked to keep peace. We now have the bloodiest war in 80 years in the middle of Europe because of NATO. So how's this peacekeeping

1 (26m 8s):
Activity? Or you could argue as many people do that actually the reason is because Ukraine wasn't in NATO. Had it been, Putin wouldn't have invaded.

0 (26m 16s):
That's a super cra This is like an addiction. And I've been through addiction, so I'm not judging at all. But it's like, I feel really shitty. I've gotta have a glass of vodka to feel better.

1 (26m 25s):
Are you mocking my mental health? I'm

0 (26m 27s):
No. Yes. But I'm also saying that I've lived this so I know what it feels like. It's the thing that is killing you. It's truly killing you. Whether it's NATO or vodka, you become convinced is saving you. So you wake up, hung over and you're like, oh, I feel so bad. Gimme a screwdriver. And if a a screwdriver, you feel better. And you don't realize that you're starting the cycle again. Would

1 (26m 47s):
Putin have invaded Ukraine if it had been a member of NATO? No, he wouldn't have done, because then America would been obliged his

0 (26m 53s):
Spot. He would never, here's what I know for a fact. Putin said this for 20 years. Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. They will not accept that anymore. That we would accept Chinese missiles in Tijuana. Or you would accept Sri Lankan missiles in Glasgow. You're just not gonna accept

1 (27m 12s):
That NATO, NATO is, is a defensive organization. How was it defensive? 'cause it just never acted proactively, aggressively.

0 (27m 18s):
Where were you when the Yugoslavia war was going on And they were bombing the shit out of Christians in Yugoslavia. Do You remember that? Yes. That was

1 (27m 24s):
Pretty offensive. NATO has always operated in a defensive capacity. How would really Yes,

0 (27m 29s):
That's how they created Kosovo defensively. It

1 (27m 32s):
Was defensive. Oh it was? Yes, it was, it was the

0 (27m 34s):
Aggressor there.

1 (27m 36s):
Oh, you know, my, my brother-in-law was literally there a minute. Just

0 (27m 40s):
Admit what you're saying is insane.

1 (27m 42s):
It's not insane. They, NATO has never actually acted unilaterally. Okay. So Soviet didn't collapse, has never attacked anybody without being attacked. It's always been defensive

0 (27m 51s):
When, okay, who in Yugoslavia attacked NATO?

1 (27m 55s):
Look,

0 (27m 56s):
Just note, here's the point where you just submit to defeat, bow your head and be like, I'm fe You know what? I bab for superior knowledge. I totally got this wrong. I can't believe I had such a silly idea. I'm

1 (28m 5s):
Sure. Well, you think nice good guys in Yugoslavia.

0 (28m 7s):
I'm not saying they're nice, good guys. You're saying that was not a defensive action. That was an offensive action. Bill Clinton's like, I don't like what you're doing. I'm gonna use NATO to kill you. And he did. And then created Kosovo is NATO base because

1 (28m 16s):
They were absolute genocidal mania.

0 (28m 18s):
Well, they may have been naughty. I'm not defending their, but

1 (28m 20s):
That's what they were being defended against.

0 (28m 22s):
Who are we defending?

1 (28m 23s):
The yugoslavians that were being pillaged and raped and murdered by other

0 (28m 27s):
Yugoslavians.

1 (28m 28s):
Yes. Okay.

0 (28m 32s):
This is getting intense. But

1 (28m 33s):
NATO is a defensive organization. Well, You

0 (28m 35s):
Can say it all you want, just like You can say Zelensky iss a a beacon of democracy when he's not elected and he's banning parts of Christianity, but he's a dictator.

1 (28m 43s):
So just to be

0 (28m 43s):
Clear, just to be honest about what things are, just to be

1 (28m 45s):
Clear, you would've let Putin take what he wants. 'cause what's the alternative when he invaded Ukraine? So

0 (28m 51s):
I try and deal, especially as I get older, in the world of reality and achievable goals. And here's the reality. Russia is a nuclear armed power. It's the largest country on earth by landmass. It's also the remnants of a global empire. So they have a sense of themselves as a global player. And they are because of energy and resources in general. Uranium, I mean, they have a lot of resources the world needs. So they're a real country. They're not Afghanistan. You can't just tell them what to do. Get in line bitch. They're not gonna accept that. Okay. So they have said since the fall of Soviet Union, you cannot have NATO on our border because it's a critical national interest of ours. So unless you wanna risk nuclear war, which we are now doing, you can't move NATO to their border whether you want to or not.

0 (29m 36s):
That's just a fact. And if you do, you're gonna get a war. We've known that since the fall of the Soviet Union. And we promised not to do it. And we tried to bring, he, he asked to be in NATO in 2000. He asked George W. Bush to be NATO. Nobody contest that this evil dictator who wants to invade Lichtenstein asked to be in NATO. Mm. Why wouldn't we let him in NATO? Why did Condi rice say, well, we can't be in NATO. Why do we have morons like Condi rice in our US government? I don't

1 (29m 60s):
Know. So when he invaded though, what would you let him do?

0 (30m 6s):
We're in,

1 (30m 6s):
We're in a hall of mirrors. Now. I look, not really. Okay. We're in a very clear moral, we are, we moral moment in history where Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine. It is a European country and

0 (30m 16s):
We side with the,

1 (30m 17s):
It has

0 (30m 17s):
Independent. We fund his from Russia,

1 (30m 19s):
Mid

0 (30m 19s):
19 assassinate People. You know? Yeah. But

1 (30m 21s):
What, what do you do? Do you let him take

0 (30m 21s):
It? There's nothing moral about this. Look in the real world, we do things we can achieve. And if we can't achieve something, we don't try and do it because millions will die as we're

1 (30m 30s):
Watching. So what do you, what do you let him do then?

0 (30m 32s):
Well, you start with a realistic understanding of the limits of your power, which is all adults have to do. My neighbors may offend me. I want them to turn down the music. I can't just go over there and shoot them. I just can't. It's, it's against the law. And I'll pay a penalty if I do that. So I have to negotiate with them. Will you please turn down the music? Shut up. No, please do it. If they won't, I maybe threaten them like I live in the material real world. Right?

1 (30m 55s):
But once, but once actually, he's invaded. What do you do? Then? You

0 (30m 59s):
Have to decide like, is it worth it? Right? Is it worth it?

1 (31m 1s):
So that's interesting to

0 (31m 1s):
Me. A million Ukrainians are gonna die. Their farmland's gonna be sold to BlackRock. The Ukrainian nation will cease to exist. They'll flood it with third worlders.

1 (31m 8s):
What do you do? They're gonna do. So what do, what do you do?

0 (31m 10s):
What would I do? Yes. I would say, like if I took over the government in January of 2022 and we're on the verge of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, I would say, guys, it's not worth trying to impose something that this country will never accept. Because if we try to do that, we'll get a

1 (31m 26s):
War. So do you let, let Putin take Ukraine? You

0 (31m 28s):
Don't let anybody do anything you ally

1 (31m 31s):
Do. You either do or you don't. You

0 (31m 32s):
Want to do, because you're gambling with the other people's lives. By the way, if a million Brits had died, you might have a different perspective. But it's very easy to be like, oh, more Ukrainians should die for the cause of

1 (31m 42s):
Democracy. Lemme assure you, is not elected. Let assure you, if Russia invaded Britain, that would not be the view of British people. Our view would be to fight to the last man and woman to kick him out. But my question really isn't, do you really think so? My, my question is not,

0 (31m 54s):
I just got invaded over the last 40 years and did nothing. So I don't think so. I don't think you would do that. I think you'd be like, we can't fight back because we have nuclear weapons, but no real military. So we'd like to negotiate just like all conquered nations do. Right. But they negotiate on the basis of reality. What can I actually,

1 (32m 8s):
But respectfully, you are not answering my question, which You don't have to 'cause you're interviewing me in this bit. But the question is, once Putin invaded, do you let him take the whole country? What do you do?

0 (32m 17s):
If I were in charge, then yes. If I had come in, if I came in in January of 2022, I would say to the State Department, I would say to the NATO leadership, I would say, oh,

1 (32m 26s):
I'm talking about February, end of February. Okay. So early

0 (32m 28s):
At that point I'm cleaning up a mask caused by the previous administration.

1 (32m 31s):
Yes. So assume it's happened. So

0 (32m 32s):
Let's say I'm Donald Trump, who's actually coming in. Right? So in that exact

1 (32m 34s):
Circumstance, right? And he is now wrestling with this very problem.

0 (32m 36s):
He certainly is. And it's, it, it's because

1 (32m 38s):
He, he doesn't wanna get put in the win. And that's my point to you. Do you actually want him to win?

0 (32m 44s):
Well, well, I mean, if your lo star is whether other people win, you will lose. Right? Okay. That's a shitty way to go through life. But what do you, if I'm trying to prevent you a win? No, I'm trying to win. I'm trying to win for my wife, my children. I get it. My neighborhood, my country. But

1 (32m 58s):
Once he's invaded, I don't care with you winner. But once he's invaded, what do you do?

0 (33m 1s):
Well, your victory has nothing to do with anything. What I care about is my victory. But

1 (33m 5s):
You are in this as much as we are.

0 (33m 6s):
No, no, no. I care about my country and whether we win what's good for us. 'cause I'm in charge. My country is theoretical in charge of nothing. Is

1 (33m 12s):
It good for America that put him wins? This whole

0 (33m 14s):
Thing has been a disaster for we're gonna lose the US dollar over this. Okay. Because we followed the advice of people like Boris Johnson, who have no skin in the game whatsoever. But they get to feel like a moral charge. Be like we're on the side of democracy. Okay. It's, it's so infuriating to make it, I'm sorry to be so mean to the Brit s fine. It's our fault too.

1 (33m 34s):
We can take it. In

0 (33m 35s):
Fact, we started this, but you guys went along like little p and knees. You shouldn't have done that.

1 (33m 39s):
But why are you not answering my question?

0 (33m 41s):
What would I do if I were Trump right

1 (33m 42s):
Now? Well, no, no. Once he invaded Putin, what do you let him take? I

0 (33m 45s):
Call Putin. Let him take, I would say

1 (33m 47s):
At that point,

0 (33m 48s):
Let him take, to what extent can you clean it up? You, you call Putin and you say, all right, this happened. First thing we're gonna do is recognize it's not in our interest, your interest, the world's interest to have NATO missiles on your border. We don't want that. There's no reason to want that. 'cause we don't wanna drive you into the arms of China. You are really part of Europe and you should be part of the west because the west is Christian world. That has a lot in common. And what if he says

1 (34m 12s):
Culturally,

0 (34m 13s):
If religiously, linguistically historically, and we want to be a block against the rising east.

1 (34m 18s):
And he says, you know, obviously, And he says, actually, I want Ukraine.

0 (34m 23s):
If you're the leader of the United States, your number one goal is to keep Russia the world's largest land mass with some of the world's deepest energy reserves from all lying with China, which has too many people, not enough land, and not enough energy. So if they get together, they create a block that is bigger than you economically and militarily. So you cannot let that happen. That's number one goal. You cannot let that happen. And that retard in charge of our country just allowed that to happen. 'cause he hates the United States is an acted against its interest consistently from day 1, 20 20 to January 20th, 2025 when he left. Thank God. So that's the goal. Do not allow to the extent You can control it, do not allow Russia to align meaningfully with China. They have much more uncommon with us.

0 (35m 4s):
They're part of Europe. You guys, don don't wanna admit

1 (35m 7s):
I don't be pedantic, but we you're not being

0 (35m 8s):
Pedantic.

1 (35m 9s):
What do you let Putin take?

0 (35m 11s):
I don't care what I care about. You don't care. I care. But what I care about is the balance of power in the world. And if the west finds itself in a place where it's got a much smaller collective economy and a much less powerful collective military than the East, then we're in serious trouble. Mm. Serious. There's no balance in the world. The Chinese are in charge of everything. And so you can't let

1 (35m 35s):
That happen. But if you roll over and you let Putin take what he wants, roll

0 (35m 39s):
Over. It's all this like dick measuring contest That's

1 (35m 41s):
So dumb. Lemme just, lemme just respond. Roll over. Lemme just respond. If you roll over and you let him take what he wants in Ukraine, why should China not go and take what they want in Taiwan, for example, they would detect, well,

0 (35m 50s):
They are gonna take what they want in Taiwan.

1 (35m 51s):
Yeah. I I'm not sure they will, I'm especially with Trump as president part of China. I don't think they will.

0 (35m 56s):
Okay. Why do, why do we get to dictate what China does with Taiwan? Like there's fears

1 (36m 0s):
Of influence. You'd be happy for them to take back Taiwan. Of course.

0 (36m 2s):
I'm not happy. I'm not happy with any conflict ever. I hate violence. I'm a Christian. I'm just saying that great countries have spheres of influence. So Saudi Arabia, where we are now, everyone's like, oh, the Saudis are in, you know, interfering in Yemen. Well, Yemen's right there, it's in their world. Like they have an absolute interest in making sure that like nothing crazy goes on in Yemen. We have the same interest in Mexico and in Canada, and we have some crazy cross-dressing Prime minister in Canada. So we kick 'em out because they're on our border. That's what great powers do. That's what they've always done, is what they always will do. So it's totally fair for us to recognize that the countries around Russia, no, we shouldn't be invading or torturing them or oppressing them, of course. But that's their sphere. And big picture, holy smokes.

0 (36m 44s):
You do not want the two largest powers in the world, apart from the United States to get together and align against us. Why do you,

1 (36m 51s):
We've done that. Why do you support Israel against Hama, for example? Why do you support America giving them billions of dollars?

0 (36m 58s):
Well, I don't,

1 (36m 59s):
You don't support Israel being supported by America.

0 (37m 1s):
Why I I support Israel in the sense that I I really like Israel. I brought my family on vacation. Israel, do

1 (37m 6s):
You agree with America supplying them with a lot of arms

0 (37m 9s):
To the extent that it, that it helps the United States. I'm for it. Of course. I I think what we need is,

1 (37m 15s):
So you do believe in America interfering in countries a long way away. It just depends which country.

0 (37m 21s):
No, I

1 (37m 22s):
I your your principle. It doesn't really apply in Israel. My principle,

0 (37m 25s):
I'll articulate it for the third time, just to be totally clear. I believe that the United States, like every country should to the extent that it can act on behalf of its own people and their perceived interests. We can debate what those interests are. But

1 (37m 36s):
That doesn't apply in Israel.

0 (37m 38s):
I don't know what you mean.

1 (37m 39s):
America's supporting Israel because it's an ally.

0 (37m 43s):
I don't even know what those words mean. I'm just saying my principles. Well,

1 (37m 46s):
They they're ally, right? I mean they, they both,

0 (37m 47s):
You know what that means to be an ally? I mean, we have no, it

1 (37m 49s):
Means that when Israel wants to attack in Gaza and attack her Mass America will help it because it's, it ally. That's not what

0 (37m 55s):
I mean, that's not what it means to be.

1 (37m 56s):
It gives billions of dollars worth of,

0 (37m 57s):
It's, it means to be an ally. Okay. Well,

1 (37m 59s):
Fundamentally it does. I have

0 (38m 0s):
No greater allies than my own children. When they come to me and say, I want to do this, I assess whether it's good for them or not. If I don't think it is, I don't support it. Right? Because they're my true allies, they're my children.

1 (38m 8s):
But why would you support America getting involved in Israel?

0 (38m 10s):
So just because as a country that's your allies says, I wanna do this, does not mean axially you support it. Maybe it's not good for you or me. So

1 (38m 15s):
Do you support America supporting Israel to the tune of billions of dollars? It

0 (38m 19s):
Depends. If You can make, it depends.

1 (38m 20s):
Well, what's, what's in America's interest? Having, it

0 (38m 23s):
Depends in all cases, it's not just about Israel.

1 (38m 25s):
But do you support what's happening then in the support in the attacks in Gaza, for example? Because I don't see the difference between that and what's happening in Ukraine. This is a long way away from America. There's no direct involvement with America, will it? There's no, there's no mainland involvement with America. And yet you think it's right that America supports Israel. We'll put words in your mouth, but you don't think it's right. America. I don't

0 (38m 46s):
Think those are the words that came

1 (38m 47s):
Outta my mouth. You don't think it's right. America supports Ukraine. I have a simple

0 (38m 49s):
Solution. When Russia invade, I have a simple solution. Let me explain what I think and then that way we'll, we'll get back. Am I wrong? We'll get right to what I think. Am I wrong? I I actually tuned out midway through. I'm not exactly sure what

1 (38m 58s):
You said. You can't tune out when I'm right. Did

0 (38m 59s):
I did. I did.

1 (38m 60s):
Just because I'm right. You can can't tune out.

0 (39m 2s):
I didn't follow

1 (39m 2s):
Conversation. You can't tune out when I'm right.

0 (39m 4s):
No. Be it was more lecture about what I think and then I'm like, wait, I know what I think. I think I'm world's expert on what I was suggest. I think I'm the uncontested premier of my own head.

1 (39m 13s):
That is

0 (39m 13s):
True. So I'm going to unload its contents on you right now. Right?

1 (39m 17s):
Explain, tell you what, what is America's national interest in Israel?

0 (39m 22s):
I'll define the parameters as well. 'cause I'm happier with that.

1 (39m 26s):
I would say,

0 (39m 28s):
I would say I support the right of all sovereign nations to act within what they believe is their own interest. Like we don't always know our own interest and our personal lives. Were between nations. Like we think it's good for us, but it may not be the vodka in the morning analogy. Not good actually. But I thought it was now I know it's not. But to the extent that we think we know, I think countries should act on behalf of their own citizens. That's, that's the basic idea in democracy. Okay. And there's certainly a ca you could make a case that whatever we're giving to Israel this year in the form of direct aid, military assistance, loan guarantees, however we're doing it, is good for the United States. I think you just have to make that case.

1 (40m 5s):
Why is it good for the United States?

0 (40m 7s):
Well, you could make that case, but why is it I'm not convinced.

1 (40m 9s):
What is the case?

0 (40m 11s):
Well, I don't know. You'd have to be an advocate for it. You are a vociferous advocate for it. So why don't you tell me

1 (40m 16s):
For what?

0 (40m 17s):
For USA to Israel in the current conflict.

1 (40m 20s):
Actually I'm, I'm, I haven't expected a view about that at all. I'm just curious about your, the difference in your, you're

0 (40m 25s):
Not an Israel hater, are you? Why do you hate

1 (40m 26s):
So not at all. Not at all. Why do you, why

0 (40m 28s):
Are you attacking Israel?

1 (40m 30s):
I'd like to, I don't

0 (40m 31s):
Know why. Like what, what problem do you have with Israel? Pi I

1 (40m 33s):
Have no problem with Israel. Prince

0 (40m 34s):
Are like this. They secretly hit Israel, if you know

1 (40m 35s):
That. I have no problem with Israel whatsoever.

0 (40m 36s):
Feels like you do. Is Netanyahu a dictator?

1 (40m 39s):
Actually, I don't like Netanyahu. I think you should. I So you hate Israel. I think you should go. No, but that's why Let me just ask you one more time. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. Whoa, whoa. Hang

0 (40m 47s):
On. Now we're getting into, I'm not comfortable with this.

1 (40m 49s):
Here's my question. I don't,

0 (40m 50s):
Should I be platform to you? That's my question. You just said you don't like Netanya. I'm

1 (40m 54s):
Trying to work out who's, whose brand suffers more when we platform each other. But let me ask you this. Let me ask you

0 (40m 58s):
This. Sorry, I'm gonna need a second. One

1 (40m 58s):
More time just quiet quietly for the people at the back. You don't like America getting involved in helping Ukraine against Russia because there's no national interest for America in doing that in your eyes.

0 (41m 10s):
Well, there's a negative national interest. A

1 (41m 12s):
A profound one. So

0 (41m 13s):
That's, so I get that we're losing the US dollar as the world's reserve of currency because of this war. Okay.

1 (41m 16s):
Alright. So fine.

0 (41m 17s):
There's no greater national.

1 (41m 17s):
So that's your, your position is America first. That there's no interest for America shouldn't be doing it. Every country should. It's a problem between the problem between Ukraine and Russia. Okay, that's fine. A lot of people have that view. I respect it. What I can't understand is the difference in your logic and principle about supporting Israel in its war with Hermas, which is many thousands of miles away from America. Have I There's no, there's no direct

0 (41m 42s):
I if I've been a great advocate for the war, the war does. I don't, I I missed that part of the conversation.

1 (41m 45s):
Well, you support America supporting Israel. You don't support America supporting Ukraine. No, no, no. I

0 (41m 50s):
Don't support America supporting any nation on the planet to its own detriment. Every element of our foreign policy should serve the United States. Okay. That's the point of our government is to serve the people who live there called citizens. That's what democracy is. There's no other reason. So if I'm in charge of a country and I decide actually I should do this because people who pay me want me to do it, or I'm making money to do it, then I'm by definition illegitimate. That's not democracy. That is a species of oligarchy or whatever. You could assign a name to it. That's not democracy. So I just believe in our system and our, our leaders should act on behalf of their own people or what they think is the, their own people's interests. And I would apply that to Israel to apply it to Ukraine. I think there have certainly been times where we have benefited from our alliance with Israel.

0 (42m 35s):
You know, it's an alliance. Just like we have alliance with

1 (42m 37s):
They're ies then.

0 (42m 38s):
I don't know what ally means.

1 (42m 39s):
It's short for alliance.

3 (42m 42s):
Yeah, you're right. It is. Yes. It's so funny. I never knew that. Got you. You got me. You've literally just, when it comes to etymology, you are the unchallenged king.

1 (42m 51s):
Boom.

3 (42m 53s):
You're blowing my mind. Pierce

1 (42m 54s):
Morgan, my English linguistic below. I

0 (42m 56s):
Was about to say, you guys invented

1 (42m 57s):
The language. You know it's, you know what it is our language. You lot fucked it up. But we actually, I totally, it's our language as a

0 (43m 3s):
PG Woodhouse fan. I totally agree.

1 (43m 4s):
It's a root, not a route. It's Iran, not Ira, not Iran. And it's a hurricane, not a hurricane.

0 (43m 10s):
Hurricane is embarrassing. These

1 (43m 12s):
Are all our artwork. No, no that's not true. We gave them to, You don't have hurricanes, you changed them. We have hurricanes.

0 (43m 16s):
You don't have hurricanes or

1 (43m 17s):
Pecans. We had one in 87 and knocked down all the trees in my house. You had a hurricane?

0 (43m 20s):
Yes.

1 (43m 20s):
87. I think it's a

0 (43m 22s):
Typhoon when it

1 (43m 22s):
Happened. Famously the BBC weatherman at the time announced on the BBC main news on the night. There were people ringing in saying Is there gonna be a hurricane in the uk?

3 (43m 32s):
And no knew what.

1 (43m 33s):
And lemme tell you, there is not. Four hours later every tree in south of England fell down. So are you serious? Yes, but we called it a hurricane is my point. Yeah, well

0 (43m 42s):
You don't have enough experience as someone who spends a lot of time in Florida. It's a hurricane. It's also a cocktail of all the New Year's resolutions you're likely to put off.

Would you kill Putin if you could?

1 (45m 2s):
Would I? Not personally, no. But

0 (45m 4s):
Do you think it should be the policy of the UK government, the US government under, because it, it is now the policy to kill Putin?

1 (45m 10s):
No. I would prefer the people of Russia to vote him out, but I also feel the same way about Netanyahu and the people in Israel. So

0 (45m 18s):
You're not calling for the assassination of Netanyahu? No. Or Putin? No. No. Do you think that if Putin were to leave, either by force or choice, that Russia would have a more pro Western leader afterwards?

1 (45m 30s):
Not necessarily. No. Okay. Not highly unlikely.

0 (45m 34s):
Highly unlikely. I think that's a fair assessment then. Why would you want, since there's no evidence that the majority of Russians don't want Putin, there's overwhelming evidence that they do want Putin. So he appears to be the choice of his own country, which he may not like or whatever, but it seems true. And he's the most pro western leader we're likely to get in our lifetimes. Then why are we against Putin? Exactly.

1 (45m 57s):
Because I don't believe him in the way that you seem to I

0 (45m 60s):
Don't believe, I don't believe anybody

1 (46m 1s):
That he has very well intentioned, perfectly reasonable, not understandable reason why he had to illegally invade a democratic country illegal and take a third of its people and take a third of his land of people when, and you think that's fine? And I'm saying I

0 (46m 14s):
Think it's hilarious when you make reference to what's legal in the middle of a war. What's illegal when your country in mind blew up Nord stream and destroyed the Western European economy. So you're talking, is

1 (46m 22s):
That legal? You're talking to the editor of the paper that opposed the illegal invasion of Iraq. You supported that. Well, I

0 (46m 29s):
I you did supported the invasion of Iraq and that was

1 (46m 31s):
Illegal too.

0 (46m 31s):
And I apologized for 22 years, but I wanted to

1 (46m 34s):
You said that was illegal.

0 (46m 36s):
I don't even know what that means.

1 (46m 37s):
Breaking the law. What

0 (46m 38s):
Law

1 (46m 38s):
Against international law. What?

0 (46m 40s):
Who makes international law?

1 (46m 42s):
Well, the international community.

0 (46m 43s):
Oh, international community. What do they mean? Do

1 (46m 45s):
You don't think there's anything like You don you don't believe in international law? I dunno what that means.

0 (46m 48s):
Who is the international community? You don't, you don't. Is Iran in the international

1 (46m 50s):
Community? So you take any invasion of a, of a sovereign Democrat? Not at all can be legal.

0 (46m 54s):
I don't know even know what you mean by legal. I, I it's wrong.

1 (46m 57s):
Lawful

0 (46m 58s):
What law are there? International policemen? Who are they? Whatcha are you even talking about?

1 (47m 3s):
Well, You don You don you, you don't think they're international laws?

0 (47m 6s):
No, I think they're moral laws and that's what I care about. Certain things are wrong regardless of what the leadership of

1 (47m 11s):
You don't believe that you believe. There are actual laws don't,

0 (47m 13s):
Not international laws. There are no international laws. Really? Are there international policemen? You don't believe

1 (47m 17s):
In international courts. You don't believe in the Yes. They're all international court. Really? So,

0 (47m 20s):
So who, who's punished in

1 (47m 21s):
International court? And there, by the way, other

0 (47m 22s):
Than milovich,

1 (47m 23s):
Do you believe in who's punished? Do you believe in the Geneva Convention or not?

0 (47m 26s):
I believe in the idea is behind the Geneva Convention. Absolutely. But it's universally disregarded. Mm. Including by your country, which I think is bio weapons by the way. You should get on that. Find out. Those are prohibited. But I think you guys have them. You're in violation. If

1 (47m 40s):
That turns out to be true, I would be violently opposed to that. But you know

0 (47m 43s):
That. It is true.

1 (47m 43s):
I actually,

0 (47m 45s):
I think you should find out.

1 (47m 46s):
I'll look into

0 (47m 47s):
It. I mean, there are biolabs in Ukraine. Mm. What are Biolabs doing in Ukraine, do you think? Are you comfortable with that?

1 (47m 52s):
No, it wouldn't be if they're there.

0 (47m 54s):
But you said Zelensky was a, a fabulous leader. Why would he have Biolabs?

1 (47m 58s):
I like him personally.

0 (48m 1s):
The dictator with bio weapons. I'm, I'm not into it. I'm sorry. I'm just, I guess that it would be, it's against international law. So I'm opposed No, look, I'm just saying international law is a theoretical concept and it's literally theoretical. 'cause it's not enforceable. And we know that 'cause it's not enforced. So what matters is what's the interest of your country and what's right and wrong. And I'm a Christian, so that's like pretty clear for me. All this shit is wrong. It's completely wrong. It's wrong to send cluster bombs to Ukraine, which you supported. I'm totally opposed to that cluster bombs to kill more kids. Like why that's wrong. I don't care if international law says it's wrong. That's

1 (48m 32s):
Was it wrong for was for, was it wrong for America to use atomic bombs and what?

0 (48m 35s):
Absolutely. Really? I don't to use nuclear weapons. Yeah.

1 (48m 38s):
Yes. So in the war, of course to save many hundreds of thousands of more people dying. I, that's what happened.

0 (48m 45s):
I don't, you know, this is, is

1 (48m 47s):
It not morally

0 (48m 48s):
Refer to in the business as a theoretical

1 (48m 52s):
Assertion? Not really. Everyone is, well,

0 (48m 54s):
It's literally theoretical. Yes. Whether

1 (48m 55s):
You agree or don't agree with the use of nuclear weapons, nobody disputes. The fact that it brought an end to a war, which had it been allowed to carry on for another six months to a year would've carried many. Why Nagasaki killed many more people.

0 (49m 4s):
Why, why drop it on Japan's Christian population? Is there some reason Hiroshima wasn't enough? No. 'cause they wanted to test a different variety of atomic weapon. So like I'm against that. I'm against killing civilians. I'm against firebombing cities, I'm against bio weapons. I'm against chemical weapons

1 (49m 19s):
Or weapons. You support,

0 (49m 21s):
I guess conventional weapons. You know, I'm

1 (49m 24s):
Well how big a bomb do you support?

0 (49m 26s):
Look, if you're intentionally killing civilians, isn't

1 (49m 28s):
It a question of just of scale? I mean, to

0 (49m 30s):
Some extent it's,

1 (49m 30s):
Yeah, if you believe in a big bomb and it kills 500 people, but you don't agree with one that kills a thousand, what's the difference ideologically?

0 (49m 37s):
It depends who they are. I mean, I think You can say, I mean there are,

1 (49m 41s):
So after Pearl Harbor, after Pearl Harbor, you think it was wrong with the Japanese refusing to surrender, vowing to kill as many people as they possibly could. Of course not that America decided to use, its two most powerful weapons to bring an end to the war. I think there's a, well that's one way to put it. That's, I would say it's more morally justified what America did than what the British did, for example, in carpet bombing. Dressed. Dressed,

0 (50m 1s):
Actually,

1 (50m 1s):
Yeah. I think there was more justification because they were trying to bring an end to the war as quickly as they could to avoid potentially millions more people die. I,

0 (50m 10s):
You know, it's no defensive Imperial Japan or Pearl Harbor or Franklin Roosevelt for allowing Pearl Harbor, which he did. It's not a defense of any of that to say if you're intentionally killing civilians, you probably shouldn't beat your chest and brag about it. You know, maybe You can make the case. I agree with that. Maybe you make the case that we had to do it or whatever. But you should. Yeah, I agree. You should weep. And that's evil. And you should just say it's evil. And I know it's like really threatening to, is it evil though Ben Shapiro to say that or whatever. But is it evil to kill civilians on purpose? Yeah, it is. I think it is really? Kids and children. Well, how is it not actually in

1 (50m 42s):
A war?

0 (50m 43s):
We can call it whatever you want. How is it right to kill women and children?

1 (50m 47s):
I didn't say. Well, because I think there is a moral right behind you if you are literally

0 (50m 50s):
To kill women and children.

1 (50m 51s):
If there's a, if there's a world war that threatens the entire, oh, you want, if it threatens the entire world, yes.

0 (50m 56s):
Some people killed your kids like your 8-year-old. Well

1 (50m 58s):
This is your own children

0 (50m 59s):
Justifiable.

1 (50m 60s):
Well, because actually you have to, well, by your criteria it's disgusting. Okay. It's nothing's So no war is morally justified.

0 (51m 8s):
I mean, I think it's pretty hard to justify. I mean, yeah, I'm

1 (51m 10s):
Sure any war,

0 (51m 10s):
You know, a pure defensive action. Sure. But I all I'm saying, look, it's all ugly. It's all hard to stomach. I've actually seen some of it up close. Super ugly. You can

1 (51m 20s):
Say that. You can say you hates it. Lemme, may, may I say the fact you, you people with it being moral justified,

0 (51m 24s):
Say to intentionally kill non-combatants women and children. I think we can say that's wrong. In fact, I thought that was the thing we were fighting against and censorship and dictatorship people ruling without being elected, people using force to get their will. Like I thought that was the whole thing we were fighting against. So how about we don't become that? And I'm just saying all kinds of decisions are made under duress. I have made decisions under duress foolishly that I'm ashamed of including supporting the Iraq war. But why are we defending it? I just don't understand that. And we're defending it, of course, because we're still doing it. And a lot of people are getting rich and a lot of people find meaning in their otherwise barren lives rather than like raising decent children and having a productive life. Making something they exist to destroy.

0 (52m 6s):
I just think that's evil.

1 (52m 6s):
And that you think no military action is morally justifiable, though.

0 (52m 10s):
I didn't

1 (52m 10s):
Say that. Are you implying that?

0 (52m 11s):
I'm not implying it. I never imply anything. I just say things.

1 (52m 14s):
It's a death of any

0 (52m 15s):
Peoples for girls. I'm just telling you what I think. If

1 (52m 17s):
You kill, yeah, if you kill any innocent people, civilians in a war, you think it's all morally lacking in justification. Because I would argue against that.

0 (52m 27s):
Right? You, you're arguing against the construct that you created in order to argue against Oh really? I'm being well I'm being super straightforward. If you're in intense,

1 (52m 33s):
Is it any form of, of warfare that's morally justified? Go on, I'm being finished.

0 (52m 38s):
I'm saying when you intentionally kill women and children when you wage war through fear by murdering the civilian population, I don't think that's a good thing. And I don't think you should be defending it. And I don't know why it's such a threat to say that out loud. If you're firebombing someone city, as we did Tokyo, as you guys did Dresden and a lot of other cities, by the way, in both of those countries, if you're dropping atomic weapons in the middle of town on a Catholic church, I don't know why you have to look back 80 years later and be like, that was a great thing. It wasn't a great thing. It was a shameful thing. And we should be better than that because we're not savages,

1 (53m 11s):
I don't think because we're Christians. But I agree with you. I don't agree with it. Okay. Apparently you don't. I don't You said right.

0 (53m 15s):
I don't in the camera. It's okay to kill an 8-year-old. I don't because it's war. What? It's not okay to kill

1 (53m 19s):
Eight year. I didn't, I didn't say anything is okay. What I said is morally justified. Because when you have an enemy that is prepared to put 6 million Jews into gas chambers and murder 6 million more people, they are prepared to do anything and you have to stop them. And then any response you give to me is morally justified.

0 (53m 38s):
Any response?

1 (53m 39s):
Well, pretty much if you're, if you're taking the war to them to try and end the war, but You don't wanna be and trying to defeat a nihilistic group like the Nazis. Yes. It's morally a a

0 (53m 47s):
Nihilistic group says the guy who's defending the murder of eight year olds, they're

1 (53m 50s):
Nihilistic. I'm not defending the murder of any eight

0 (53m 52s):
Year olds. What she's doing is expressing a species of nihilism. The whole point is, we are better than you because we have limits. There's some things wrong. I'm not gonna rape your wife. I'm not. How

1 (53m 59s):
Do you, how do you stop,

0 (53m 59s):
Hold on. Lemme, lemme finish. Okay. I am not going to behave like an animal. Mm, you are. That's why we're at war. You bombed preemptively. My Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor, we weren't even at war. Why'd you do that? That's outrageous. We're gonna punish for you doing it. I get it. Mm. But we're not like,

1 (54m 15s):
You not punished, defend,

0 (54m 17s):
Of course not defending. There was no threat of invasion. If you're the United States, I mean you live in a tiny island nation. I think there was a, a

1 (54m 23s):
Real Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. That is a form of invasion, isn't it?

0 (54m 28s):
It was not an invasion. It was an attack

1 (54m 30s):
On, it's a mass attack on,

0 (54m 31s):
I'm not defending Pearl Harbor. I don't think Roosevelt should have let it happen, which he did. But

1 (54m 35s):
It, once it happened, what do you do? You

0 (54m 36s):
You attack them back. Get it?

1 (54m 38s):
I'm not so you, you agree?

0 (54m 39s):
Okay, but hold on. There are finer distinctions here.

1 (54m 41s):
Really? You attack them back. Lemme finish my fucking sentence. Was it, was it morally defensible? Stop to attack them back. Stop. Stop. Okay.

0 (54m 48s):
Yes. It was morally defensible to attack them back.

1 (54m 50s):
Thank you. Thank you. You agree with me, but it depends what attack. You agree with me? You didn't qualify this. Qualify both sides. It's like crazy. You're like, you didn't qualify it and you say

0 (55m 1s):
It's okay to molest children. Why

1 (55m 3s):
Do you say that? You're like, I didn't

0 (55m 4s):
Say that. No. Okay. No, you just said it's okay to molest children Now. Why would you be in favor of trauma?

1 (55m 8s):
Nobody. You talked about molesting children. That's what you, you just said it was morally justified for America dialogue. It's like hilarious America. You said America attacking after Paul.

0 (55m 18s):
I people on, they're like, they end the interview and they're like, what just happened?

1 (55m 22s):
I see you'll be saying that. He just told me when

0 (55m 24s):
I leave and then he attacked me for believing it. It's so hilarious. I love that. It's like a species masturbation. Like you don't need another person present. Listen,

1 (55m 32s):
Don't not masturbation. I'm not trying. It's making love to someone. It's making love to someone you love.

0 (55m 38s):
Okay. Lemme just say you don't ever wanna wind up in a place where you're defending the killing of children. You just don't. Now you go into

1 (55m 45s):
Any kind of, that wasn't what I was doing. I was saying there's moral justice. Well, it's very much

0 (55m 48s):
What you're doing. No, no. Said You said it was morally justified to kill children.

1 (55m 50s):
I said morally just, it's not No, no. Morally justified to drop bombs, which end a war. Yes, I do believe that. Can I ask

0 (55m 57s):
You, just since we're still on Hir Nagasaki, hard to say you make the case for Nagasaki, but whatever, why not? If you have this fantastic new weapon and you want to prevent, somehow you're required to invade Japan. Like I don't know why we'd be required to invade Japan, by the way. Like, no one ever answers that question. They just

1 (56m 15s):
Attacked you.

0 (56m 16s):
No, they attacked us four years earlier and we've now beaten them and driven them outta the Philippines and Malaysia and all this stuff. We're, we've won. Why do we have to invade mainland Japan? No one ever answers that question. We just kind of have to 'cause we have to. Okay. I'm not second guessing the military leadership of the Second World War, but I am second guessing this. Why wouldn't you bomb just military installations? Why drop these bombs in the middle of a city when you know that overwhelmingly the incinerated people will be civilians. Like, why would you do that? I would not do that. I would say, I have the bomb. Okay, we're gonna drop it on, you know, critical military infrastructure, arms, manufacturing plants on, you know,

1 (56m 51s):
A fleet.

0 (56m 53s):
Why would you

1 (56m 53s):
Drop it on? 'cause when the enemy is not making that calculation, you have to stop them.

0 (56m 57s):
Stop them from what? Not being invaded.

1 (56m 60s):
Stop them from killing your civilians, killing your people.

0 (57m 3s):
Japan at, in, in the summer of 1945, was in no position to kill any American civilians. Period. So I think they floored a couple fire bombs over Oregon three years before. But the point is, look, I don't want to, I understand. You know, people do their best under pressure. They make mistakes. I've made a million of them. I'm not judging even Harry Truman, who I do think was kind of a pig, but whatever. I'm not even judging. I I maybe would've done the same thing. I'm just saying 80 years later. Why would, why defend that? Like, what's

1 (57m 32s):
The point? I think it was morally justified to kill

0 (57m 34s):
200,000 civilians. Yeah. So then we wouldn't have to invade, which we didn't have to anyway.

1 (57m 39s):
To save potentially millions of lives being killed. Yes.

0 (57m 42s):
Of our invaders, of their country. Of,

1 (57m 44s):
Of both sides. To bring an end to the war. How

0 (57m 46s):
About just not invade them.

1 (57m 47s):
They wouldn't surrender. You've gotta bring the war to an end. But they

0 (57m 50s):
Had lost Why do you, but why do you have to invade? 'cause they,

1 (57m 52s):
They refuse to surrender.

0 (57m 54s):
Okay. But we'd kick them out of all of their colonies. We've driven them back to their islands.

1 (57m 58s):
You don't dispute dropping those bombs ended the war. Do you?

0 (58m 1s):
Well, I, I am disputing it. That's what I'm doing right now.

1 (58m 4s):
You did it. End the war. Oh.

0 (58m 5s):
Disputing that it ended the war. Sure,

1 (58m 7s):
Of course. So it the means and effect. Correct.

0 (58m 10s):
I'm also not disputing that bringing down the twin towers change the United States, like if you commit enough killing, you will change people's behavior, including getting them to surrender. I'm just, my only question is, is it worth it? And what are you becoming when you participate in it? Yeah, but I think, I think that's a meaningful question that nobody addresses. Like yes, but you'll, who am I? But you, I'm a decent person. I am. I I'm an imperfect person. This is how Americans I think should think of themselves and mostly do. But I'm also a representative of an enlightened country product, of an enlightened civilization called Western civilization. And there are certain things I will not do, even if they benefit me. I'm not doing that. 'cause I'm not that guy. I don't kill children. I don't rape women. I don't send women into battle to defend me, which I guess we now do.

0 (58m 51s):
That's wrong.

1 (58m 53s):
So you, you would condemn what Israel's done in Gaza, for example. I

0 (58m 57s):
Don't, I don't wanna be involved in that.

1 (58m 58s):
I mean, nearly 20,000 children said to have died.

0 (59m 1s):
I, I don't

1 (59m 2s):
You condemn it.

0 (59m 2s):
Think that that is a,

1 (59m 6s):
I don't are your criteria condemning it? Don't. Is it morally justified?

0 (59m 9s):
That is a calculation that Israel has to make. I don't want to be have anything to do with that. You have no

1 (59m 14s):
Is the no, no view, no view.

0 (59m 18s):
It's hard to take a lecture from someone who just admitted that he hates Israel in every fiber of his body.

1 (59m 23s):
I never said that.

0 (59m 24s):
You said that. You said that

1 (59m 25s):
Camera. Now you're distracting. No, no.

0 (59m 26s):
I'm not distracting. Yes.

1 (59m 27s):
You're you're the one who said that you're not distracting.

0 (59m 29s):
You said, I hate Benjamin Netanyahu.

1 (59m 31s):
No, I didn't. I said, I don't think you should be leader anymore. You hate

0 (59m 33s):
Him. You should be leader. Irrational hatred that, you know, I don't know where it comes from. I can't account for what's in your soul. I don't have an x-ray into what's deep inside you. But all you said was,

1 (59m 43s):
I hate this. I have no problem saying that. I think Israel's response has gone way too far. Way too many civilians have been killed. I I, what I'm surprised about is that you having lectured me right about the deaths of eight year olds, I have said you don't wanna morally condemn what Israel's done in does. I wanted, I'm curious as to why, but I wanted Are you criteria?

0 (59m 59s):
Yeah. My criteria apply solely. And this is a thread of consistency throughout my arguments here and everywhere for the last 20 years. They have to, with the behavior of the United States, which is my country, and it's been my family's country for hundreds of years. I pay my full taxes. I feel very vested. I'm a shareholder in my country. So its behavior matters greatly to me. I'm implicated in its behavior. And I don't want the United States to participate in things that are counter to its interests or counter to the values of Western civilization. Right. That's really simple. So other countries do all kinds of abominable things, including cannibalism. Hmm. A lot actually. And human sacrifice a lot actually. And, you know, okay, they're not my country.

0 (1h 0m 41s):
So I don't want the United States involved in anything that's morally indefensible or counter to its own interests.

1 (1h 0m 47s):
Period. So Israel's dropping American bombs on Gaza, killing lots of children in order to You think of, I'll tell you what I think, hang on, You Don. Don't tell me what I think. You think the, you think the killing is, I think, I think you think, you think the killing of civilians tell you what is morally in defensive. Lemme,

0 (1h 1m 1s):
Let me tell you what I think.

1 (1h 1m 2s):
So, American bombs are being used to kill a lot of children and women in Gaza. I

0 (1h 1m 6s):
Hate that.

1 (1h 1m 7s):
Is it morally? Let me tell you what is it morally in defensive? I'm not gonna, now You don't wanna say

0 (1h 1m 12s):
I'm in the process of telling you, go on

1 (1h 1m 15s):
Then.

0 (1h 1m 15s):
Stand back. Let the flower bloom. Okay. Stop tending the garden pierce. I hate the fact that civilians are killed with American weapons. I hate it. I hate it in Ukraine. I hate it in Gaza. I hate it in the occupied territories, as do I, whatever we're calling him these days. I think in the specific case of Israel, we have been closely aligned with the Israeli government, you know, since the 1950s we're actually instrumental in the creation of Israel. So since the late forties. And I think that there are times when our interests have aligned And there are times the transfer of military technology to China being one of them, where those interests diverge.

0 (1h 1m 56s):
I would very much appreciate an environment in the United States where Americans could speak openly about what their money is doing in a bunch of different foreign countries, including that one. And I think that we should reassess all our relationships, all our alliances with our allies on the basis of whether or not it's good for the United States on a bunch of different levels economically. Whether it's good for our internal politics, whether it's good for, you know, our power abroad, et cetera, et cetera. And yes, more than, you know, I I really think that we need a much more honest conversation about our relationship with Israel. And I feel, if I can just say one thing and brag, I feel like I'm one of the only people in the United States who's not emotional on the topic.

0 (1h 2m 38s):
Everyone's so emotional about it. They hate Israel. They love Israel. It's like, I'm American. Okay. I I like Israel. I don't love any country other than my own. And I think we should have a rational conversation about this. And at this point, as you well know, we don't. Mm. So that's my actual position. Yeah.

1 (1h 2m 54s):
Look for what it's worth, my position is Israel had a fundamental duty, not just a right, but a duty to defend its people after October the seventh, given the horrendous scale of that attack. And my only question I kept asking repeatedly from about the first couple of weeks onwards, was, what is a proportionate response? Look what is morally justified.

0 (1h 3m 13s):
In general, your relationships with na, with your neighbors are your problem In my home, my neighbors, I own my house. I can't leave

1 (1h 3m 22s):
Easily. But it's also an American problem. 'cause American military is being used. No, but

0 (1h 3m 26s):
You make calculations about your behavior based on what You can achieve, based on what you think your interests are. And that's true at the homeowner level. And it's true at the nation level. So you deal with your neighbors and that's your problem. Mm. And if you're in a fight with your neighbors, it's up to you to resolve it. It's not my problem. It, I I do not have to resolve your disputes with your neighbors. Mm. And that is true of Ukraine and it's true of Israel. I'm sorry. I wish you well, I may have, you know, obviously I like Israel 'cause I like going there. I I know Israelis and I really like them.

1 (1h 3m 54s):
I like Israel.

0 (1h 3m 55s):
Oh, it's The best. I mean to visit. It's The best.

1 (1h 3m 57s):
I like Israeli people. They're very I do too. I, I like Palestinian people too that I've met.

0 (1h 4m 1s):
I do too. And there are a lot of Christians. The one thing that, I'll just be honest since you're pushing me on this that makes me a little bit emotional, is there are a lot of Christians, Christian Arabs. And having traveled a lot, I can say, just as a matter of personal preference, I really like them. I've never met a Christian Arab that I didn't like. Actually, I think they're really amazing people. And a lot of them have been killed or mistreated with American money and weapons. And I think it's disgusting. And I think it's especially disgusting that Christian leaders in the United States have said nothing. 'cause they're bullied and bought off. And I think they, they should feel shame 'cause they've dodged their duty, which is to speak up on behalf of their brothers in Christ. And they haven't. And they, they're Christians of Gaza who were killed. And there are a ton in the West Bank, you know, the Pope. And by the way, that's the cradle of Christianity. The

1 (1h 4m 40s):
Pope apparently

0 (1h 4m 41s):
Called Where's the church of the nativity? Part of the Pope

1 (1h 4m 42s):
In Bethlehem. You know, that's what the Pope calls a church in. He's

0 (1h 4m 45s):
Absurd. I can't, yeah.

1 (1h 4m 46s):
But he called, he actually calls a church a Catholic church in Gaza Every night to see how they're doing Every night, apparently. Of course. Yeah.

0 (1h 4m 52s):
That's the pope, the pope thing. I'm not getting involved. I'm not a Catholic. Sorry. You're gonna have to deal with 'em. It's your Pope, not mine.

Eight Sleep (1h 4m 59s):
So we were at a meeting here at TCN the other day, and I looked around the room and every other person had a kind of ruddy vitality, sort of pink cheeks, alertness, bright eyes, full mental acuity, and a cheerfulness you could almost smell. And I asked, why does everyone look so good? And part of the answer, of course, is they like what we do for a living. It's really interesting. We think it's important. But another reason everyone looks so good is because they'd all had a great night sleep. I'm not making this up. Almost everybody here uses a new sleep technology from a company called Eight Sleep. They sent it to us and everyone here loves it. It's called the pod. It's a high tech mattress cover effectively that you add to your existing bed. You don't need a new bed or anything like that. You just throw this over what you have. What it does is adjust the temperature of your bed warmer or cooler, depending on what you want. And it maintains an ideal sleeping environment all night long. So I didn't know this, but as you progress through different phases of sleep, your body's needs change. And Eight Sleep automatically keeps things exactly where they should be in the sweet spot through the entire night. It's been proven to increase the quality of your sleep, the amount you sleep Every night. It improves your recovery time from physical exertion. And it may even improve your cognitive performance. Enhance, enhance your overall health. It seems to be doing that in our office. So it learns and adapts to your sleep patterns over time and automatically adjusts temperatures throughout the night through each phase of sleep. And it does this independently for each sleeper on either side of the bed. That's pretty cool. So You can sleep well and feel much better and be more effective the next morning as we are here. Try it for yourself. Go to Eight Sleep dot com slash Tucker, use the Promo code Tucker to get an extra 350 bucks off the Pod, four Ultra. You can try it with zero obligation for a month. And if You don't like it, just send it back again. That's Eight Sleep dot com slash Tucker. Better sleep today and look great in your morning meetings as our guys do.

0 (1h 7m 19s):
But no, but in general, I, I'm speaking about the United States Protestants in the United States. That's the world that I'm from that I understand they have an obligation to stand up, stand for for their brother Christians around the world. And they don't in this specific case because they're intimidated. And I think that's really shameful. And I think they should feel shame for it. It's not a political question. It's not, do you hate Israel? It's like, I I I don't hate Israel. Anybody who murders Christians, defenseless Christians, the religion of peace, the actual religion of peace, I'm opposed to that. And we should just say that that's not controversial. It should not be controversial. And it just shows how totally afraid and lacking self-confidence Christians are to just say like, I'm sorry, I'm not like attacking me, but I'm opposed to that.

0 (1h 8m 2s):
You can't use my money to kill Christians. Blow up a church. No. Or to storm the Church of the Nativity. That's my religion. No, you don't get a dollar if you do that. And by the way, we're not giving you any money until you promise to treat Christians as equals as, you know what I mean? That's, that's how I personally feel. And I think all Christians should feel that way. It's not attacking anybody. It's just a baseline demand of like dignity and respect. And they don't get it.

1 (1h 8m 27s):
I mean, fundamentally

0 (1h 8m 28s):
That makes me emotional. Yeah.

1 (1h 8m 29s):
Look, fundamentally, I, we're not a million miles apart and we both, neither of us like war. Nobody who likes war should ever be.

0 (1h 8m 36s):
Well, one of us likes dictators.

1 (1h 8m 38s):
No, you do. Yeah, you do.

0 (1h 8m 41s):
I didn't tweet out. I love you Vladimir Putin. You

1 (1h 8m 43s):
Didn't need to. You look great. Yoga. You said it your, you said it in your eyes. Great.

0 (1h 8m 47s):
But I didn't say it on Twitter.

1 (1h 8m 49s):
You should have, you know what? You should have been on Twitter. You just seen. Everyone thought you did. Oh,

0 (1h 8m 53s):
I didn't. I don't give a shit when people think. But I didn't tweet vitamin Putin. You're

1 (1h 8m 57s):
Fabulous. You're fabulous. You didn't need to. I need to, didn't need to body language. Set it for you. Need

0 (1h 9m 3s):
No start humping his leg in the, in the interview. No. Anyway. No, I just, I'm against dictatorship and I I don't wanna send money to dictators. Does it bother you that your tax dollars go to a dictator?

1 (1h 9m 14s):
No. 'cause I don't, I don't see Zel landscape as a dictator in the way that you do.

0 (1h 9m 18s):
If your prime minister decided not to have another election,

1 (1h 9m 21s):
Those kid literal all been leader for what? Two years? Two years? I think he'd been in charge. Putin. What is, what's he into nearly 30 years now?

0 (1h 9m 30s):
I think Putin has been in 24.

1 (1h 9m 33s):
24.

0 (1h 9m 35s):
I'm not defending Putin. I'm just saying like all dictatorship is bad. Like a little dollop of dictatorship is as bad as a mouthful of dictatorship. I'm just against dictatorship. I'm for democracy in inspiring, passionate, determined, and resolute. That's what you called zelensky.

1 (1h 9m 54s):
Oh, I thought he was one to me.

0 (1h 9m 56s):
No, you were

1 (1h 9m 57s):
All at the same. I thought that was your, I thought that was your out for me

0 (1h 9m 59s):
Inspiring.

1 (1h 10m 0s):
I was about to say Thank you Peter.

0 (1h 10m 2s):
Determined and resolute and very handsome. Now that's implied. I

1 (1h 10m 4s):
Would agree with all of those things I said about you would. Yes, he would. I think the courage, the moral courage he showed on the night that the Russians invaded when people thought they would sweep through IV and almost certainly kill him. The fact he immediately went on social media and with people around him and said, I'm not leaving, I'm staying here for you. That's moral courage of the kind we saw with Trump when he stood there and got back up and went fight, fight, fight. When he assassin. I'm surpris surprised You don't admire

0 (1h 10m 28s):
That. His politic opponents or when he steals usaid or he allows his generals to sell half the missiles they get from the United States to the Mexican drug cartels and Iran and everyone else in the black market. Is that inspiring? Well

1 (1h 10m 40s):
You are making passionate. A lot of allegations against him. Him. Those are facts. Okay. You say they're facts, but other people dispute them. They're facts.

0 (1h 10m 46s):
Who disputes that they're selling weapons in Ukraine on the black market? I don't think anyone disputes that.

1 (1h 10m 51s):
I'm sure that's happening.

0 (1h 10m 52s):
Oh, it's happening. Yeah. Who disputes that? Zelensky Hass murdered his political opponents. No one has he

1 (1h 10m 58s):
You think he personally has ordered the murders?

0 (1h 11m 1s):
Well, he's in charge of the country. He's the Tator. Do you think he has He's the dictator. He

1 (1h 11m 4s):
Just said he did.

0 (1h 11m 6s):
Well, I mean, in the same sense that we would say

1 (1h 11m 8s):
You wouldn't dispute that Vladimir Putin does that re relentlessly that imprisons and torches and kills?

0 (1h 11m 14s):
Oh yeah. No, I think there's, there's a long, there's a long history of that in the region. Poisoning your enemies. Putin's done that. I, it seems clear to me. I'm not sending him money. I'm not calling imp passionate, determined, resolute and handsome.

1 (1h 11m 26s):
But you haven't actually, you hate this.

0 (1h 11m 27s):
I love this.

1 (1h 11m 28s):
This is good. I don't hate I know. 'cause I keep asking the same question and for some reason you don't wanna answer it.

0 (1h 11m 32s):
Yeah, no, I mean, I mean, what would you I would, I've answered all questions. Let me ask you a really easy question. Now that you have been like me fired from your like cushy mainstream media gig. How much happy are are you and why? And looking back at the television networks and newspaper, how many newspapers did you work for?

1 (1h 11m 55s):
I ran two of the big ones in the uk. Yeah,

0 (1h 11m 56s):
Right. But over your whole career, how many did you work for?

1 (1h 11m 58s):
I worked for three. Four. Four actually. Okay.

0 (1h 12m 0s):
Right. So you've been at every stage of British media. Looking back, how do you feel about them?

1 (1h 12m 5s):
I think I had the, The best of it really. I certainly think in newspaper terms. It was before the internet had really taken hold. And so you were the, the receptacle for news for People. You know, there weren't many television networks. You didn't really have cable television when I was running the papers. So papers are much more influence and much more power because they were bringing the news to people. Yeah. People woke up in the morning And they would read their paper to find out what had happened. That doesn't happen anymore. People already know what's happened. There are millions of news networks all over cable news. There's millions of internet sites. You can get the news. Everyone knows what's going on. So the sort of, the the point and relevance and power and influence of newspapers has dissipated. They can still break big stories and have big influence.

1 (1h 12m 48s):
And if I was running one again, a, I'd be completely digital by now. I'd just abandon print papers altogether. But the economic model is very difficult if you do that. You don't make as much from the digital side as you do from print. So they've gotta weigh that up and somehow get through it. But I would invest heavily in investigative longer term journalism because that's how You can now bring news to people they don't already know. Well

0 (1h 13m 9s):
Sure. But I meant all true. Totally true, but honest is quick. Nice explain. But I'm, I'm really asking about the honesty level. Yeah. Yeah. So now you have a gig where You can say whatever you want, you're your own boss. You can make a, a real living. I have no idea how you're doing, but given your numbers are huge. So I I bet you you're probably making more than you made before. We're in that range anyway, so it's all great. But the greatest part is You can say exactly what you want. How would you compare that to your

1 (1h 13m 35s):
Previous case? I would say the difference is you, you, we can't get canceled. Right. Right. Who's gonna cancel us each ourselves. So we have a complete freedom. And as a sort of liberation from the restrictions inevitably come with working for big companies. Big companies in the media have really struggled, I think, to move with the way young people now get their information. They don't really understand the big legacy media companies that young people do not watch linear television. Oh, they don't read print newspapers. They've,

0 (1h 14m 6s):
What they've really struggled with is, is to stop lying. Right. They can't stop lying. They're like compulsive liars.

1 (1h 14m 10s):
And they And they have controlled the way news is terminated. Yeah. The thing about you and me and other people that do this, whether you're on the left or the right, there's no control. Right. We, we don't get control by anybody. We're only answerable to ourselves and what we wanna do, I think I'm like you in the sense of we've, we're not politically aligned in many ways, but we'd love talking to each other, love debating, love arguing, love asking questions, love learning. Like

0 (1h 14m 33s):
I think we are politically aligned. I think

1 (1h 14m 35s):
We are in many ways you

0 (1h 14m 36s):
Do own guns. I know that you do secretly. I know that you do. And I know that you think this all you crazy thing is insane.

1 (1h 14m 42s):
Let me tell you. Well, I don't, but let me tell you. I know that

0 (1h 14m 44s):
You do. I can see it in your eyes.

1 (1h 14m 46s):
Like

0 (1h 14m 46s):
I can, how do I get outta

1 (1h 14m 47s):
This? There's a lot of mil, a lot of military in my family who know how to use guns better than me.

0 (1h 14m 51s):
I know. But not all use of guns is equal. Right. Some is counterproductive.

1 (1h 14m 57s):
You know, the thing about guns, I'll just say this for your audience. It will all be looking at me and thinking I'm the two a gun grabber. The reality is it's complete cultural difference in my country. Everybody used to have a gun. Everybody used to in the old days. Now very few people have guns. There are incredibly tight restrictions. And the consequence of that is we have almost zero gun crime. The

0 (1h 15m 19s):
Was your country, is London safe

1 (1h 15m 20s):
Now? No, no. I'm about to come to that. The the problem we have is with knights. Right. So I'm not saying for a moment you get rid of all the guns. Nobody gets killed. Of course they do. We have a knife crime problem epidemic in our country. No,

0 (1h 15m 31s):
You have a people problem. You have the kind of people who stab each other. Well and you didn't use to have that.

1 (1h 15m 36s):
Well we did. We did. No

0 (1h 15m 38s):
You didn't. We did. I mean it's measurable. How many people got stabbed in London in 1970 or shot compared to now. Sure. But there are, it's a massive increase. 'cause the people, the attitudes of the people, the actions of the people are totally different. You've got different people and different behaviors and like, you can't admit that because I'm not sure why. No,

1 (1h 15m 54s):
No. Because actually there are lots of white English people who stab. I'm not who stab each other. Oh, I know, right?

0 (1h 15m 59s):
Oh, I

1 (1h 15m 59s):
Know. So it's not just about No, no, but the influx of migrants, if that's what you're saying.

0 (1h 16m 3s):
I'm, I'm not saying that. Okay. I'm saying that I, I do think immigration has changed your country for the much, much worse.

1 (1h 16m 8s):
Well, it's certainly changed the country

0 (1h 16m 10s):
Much worse. That's my opinion. But it's not just immigrants who are behaving badly at all. There are a lot of native born indigenous Brits who are behaving badly. That is totally true. And there are a lot of immigrants in your country who are kind of superior actually, for being totally honest. Who were impress. Really impressive. Yeah. I'm not making a blanket statement. I'm just saying that the behavior has changed of the people who live there. Right. You can't be trusted with guns now 'cause you're outta control.

1 (1h 16m 33s):
Not about that. I just know we have very tight gun laws and no gun violence. The interest, well, very little. My question for you, but

0 (1h 16m 38s):
Do you own a gun secretly?

1 (1h 16m 40s):
I do not. No.

0 (1h 16m 41s):
No. Do you want to, you

1 (1h 16m 42s):
Know why I get five years in prison if I got caught with it.

0 (1h 16m 45s):
So you're afraid of,

1 (1h 16m 45s):
You're

0 (1h 16m 46s):
Afraid of your government, which doesn't trust you 'cause it's dictatorship obvious. No.

1 (1h 16m 49s):
Let me ask you a question about guns since you raised it, because I'm curious, generally curious. You have, it said there are over 400 million guns in circulation in America. Hope

0 (1h 16m 56s):
So.

1 (1h 16m 57s):
And it, it's apparently a million new guns get sold every month. So that number exponentially rises the number of mass shootings in America is also rising. Do you think anything should be done about that? That if I had my, my time again talking about this with Americans, I would never have been so censorious. I would never have been talking about Gun Control. I think the word control alienates Americans. But what I would've said was, how do you make it safer? How do you stop so many people getting shot? What do you do about it?

0 (1h 17m 26s):
Well, you ban SSRIs immediately. Immediately. You ban SSRIs, you ban whole categories. The

1 (1h 17m 32s):
Medication of psycho. Yeah, I absolutely

0 (1h 17m 35s):
Like immediately. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the truth is that, you know, drugs and alcohol drive a lot of our social ills. A lot of them. And when people are sober and I would say, you know, if you're on Xanax or Prozac or whatever, you're not sober. Right,

1 (1h 17m 52s):
Right. I

0 (1h 17m 53s):
Agree. But certainly alcohol and meth and you know, most of our social problems are either caused or exacerbated by the drugs that people take. That's just a fact. And mass shootings are definitely in that category. So look, as you found out your, your knife crime has just exponentially jumped recently. Yeah. Yeah. And that's not because there are more knives. People use them at dinner Every night and have for hundreds of years and not since the Roman times. They've used knives and not stabbed each other. It's because people are behaving differently. Yeah, that's true. Like why is that? Yeah, that's true. I must say all the Gun Control people who wanna send all the guns to Ukraine so they can go kill other eastern Europeans. It's like, it's sort of weird. Mm. Do you think it's weird?

1 (1h 18m 34s):
No. What I think is weird about the question I asked you is simply that if I was an American, there's a lot of

0 (1h 18m 38s):
Gun crime in Ukraine. Are you adding to that?

1 (1h 18m 40s):
Well, it's a war, it's a different thing.

0 (1h 18m 41s):
It's gun crime. I call it gun crime. You think people getting killed with guns.

1 (1h 18m 44s):
You think Ukraine defending itself as a crime?

0 (1h 18m 47s):
I think there are a lot of people getting killed with guns. And I think it's really sad. And we should disarm Ukraine really well. Sure. People getting killed with guns, they shouldn't have. They should be strict controls on guns in Ukraine. Automatic weapons. You guys are sending automatic weapons to Ukraine to kill other human beings. I just think that, I'm just not comfortable with that morally. Mm.

1 (1h 19m 6s):
I see. I see what you're doing. You're

0 (1h 19m 7s):
Doing the British chere cat thing with me?

1 (1h 19m 11s):
No, because I think it's a fatuous argument, but it's fine.

0 (1h 19m 15s):
You're

1 (1h 19m 15s):
Avoiding asking fatuous meaning brilliant. You're avoiding asking my, answering my question. Which

0 (1h 19m 19s):
Is why do we have so many guns? Because we're free.

1 (1h 19m 21s):
No, no. Didn't ask that. Because we're,

0 (1h 19m 22s):
No one can tell us. We can't

1 (1h 19m 23s):
Defend ourselves. Didn't say that. We all used to have guns too. Now we

0 (1h 19m 25s):
Don't. And then you guys, after the second World War, which was like a liberation war and you won, you lost all your freedom and now you can't even express your political opinions. So they put you in jail. So like, how did you win? How did you win you that what victory looks like? You lose all your rights, your economy gets destroyed.

1 (1h 19m 41s):
Try what? We won. Try by bankers won all of a sudden won. Oh, I won. We won. Because I'm not conducting this interview in German, which I wouldn't be. So it's a linguistic

0 (1h 19m 47s):
Thing.

1 (1h 19m 48s):
I'd rather not speak German and and be goosestepping around my yard in England. Yes. Goose stepping. Yeah.

0 (1h 19m 53s):
But you are goosestepping people arrested for praying.

1 (1h 19m 55s):
We literally won our freedom from people. Where's your

0 (1h 19m 58s):
Freedom? Where's your freedom? You can get

1 (1h 19m 60s):
Arrested. I'm as, I'm as free as you could possibly want a human being debate.

0 (1h 20m 2s):
You can't defend yourself. You can't control who comes into your country and you can't criticize government policies or you get arrested. Mm. So how are you free? You're a slave, aren't you? No,

1 (1h 20m 12s):
We really, how free are you? We have cultural problems in our country.

0 (1h 20m 16s):
Could you go on Facebook right now and say, I don't want any more immigrants in my country. They're making it worse.

1 (1h 20m 20s):
You could say that. What you couldn't say because a lot of these stories I have to say in America have been spun completely disingenuously. There's one case, for example, I see everyone trying to send me as an example of Britain's gone mad. Elon Musk has done it as a guy who got seven years in prison. Actually what he was doing, this guy was, he was orchestrating and directing rioting on hotels containing asylum seekers. Because he had a incorrect belief that someone who had stabbed three young girls to death and stabbed loads of others in a horrific attack was an illegal asylum seeker. Maybe

0 (1h 20m 56s):
He doesn't want asylum seekers in this country. Fine, fine. I mean,

1 (1h 20m 58s):
Is that okay? Fine. It's not okay to have no asylum seekers. It is not okay to allow too many people to come in. Why is it not

0 (1h 21m 4s):
Okay

1 (1h 21m 4s):
To have asylum? It's not okay to have a broken asylum system as we have.

0 (1h 21m 6s):
Why have any asylum seekers?

1 (1h 21m 8s):
Because I believe you should as a, as a good country. Why? Because we're a caring, compassionate country. And by the way, Britain, for all your knocking of Britain, how

0 (1h 21m 14s):
Is that carrying compassionate? Your native population is in massive decline. Britain. How is that compassionate Britain to your people? Britain

1 (1h 21m 19s):
Actually is one of the most tolerant multicultural countries in the world to this day.

0 (1h 21m 24s):
Then why do you have so many stabbings?

1 (1h 21m 26s):
We have a problem with stabbings. But you know what, how many people get killed by stabbings a year in Britain? Compared What's evidence

0 (1h 21m 31s):
To that? You have a problem nearly. We're very compassionate. We do have a lot of stabbings. Fine.

1 (1h 21m 35s):
But by your criteria, they're just defending themselves. Haven't they got a right to bear arms?

0 (1h 21m 39s):
Okay,

1 (1h 21m 40s):
Well hang

0 (1h 21m 40s):
On. Have they won? Hang on. Really? Any stabbing? Hang on. Couple years ago now you've got a ton of stabbings, but everything's totally fine. And if you complain about it, you're going to jail.

1 (1h 21m 47s):
Do the British people have a right to bear arms Tucker?

0 (1h 21m 51s):
All free people have a right to defend themselves. Bear arms. Of course. Yeah. How do you,

1 (1h 21m 54s):
So they can carry knives. So why are you annoyed about the knife crime?

0 (1h 22m 1s):
I'm against all crime on, look, here's my just saying. Here's my only point. I'm

1 (1h 22m 4s):
Sure they use a Tucker Carson argument. Well, the other guy's got a knife. I better carry one

0 (1h 22m 7s):
In the United States, which is governed by a system we inherited with great gratitude from you, from the English A person has a right. Which is we believe God-given it's inherent, we're born with it. 'cause we're not slaves. We're free people to say what he thinks is true. Period. Yeah. Period. Yeah. And government has to not only not infringe on that Right. But protect it. It exists to protect that. Right. Your system is a little different. We took it a little farther and enshrined that in our bill of rights, which unfortunately you don't have. I bet you wish you did. But from an American perspective, the idea that you would ever punish someone for talking. Mm.

1 (1h 22m 40s):
And that wasn't why they, that guy was punished. But

0 (1h 22m 43s):
That may be right. I I not, I would not contest that

1 (1h 22m 45s):
It is rightly inci.

0 (1h 22m 47s):
Right. But you were not contest that there are hundreds of people who've gone to jail in the last five years in the UK for expressing opinions. That is a fact.

1 (1h 22m 52s):
It depends what you'd think that opinion is. Most of them have been directing violence or inciting violence. That's different. Expressing an opinion. I

0 (1h 22m 59s):
Don't think that's right. Pierce. That is, that is I don't think they were charged with that.

1 (1h 23m 2s):
That is right. Okay. And also, look, look at the case of Tommy Robinson. Tommy Robinson. Most Americans I speak to think he's in jail as some kind of political prisoner like Nelson Mandela for having views about a, about

0 (1h 23m 14s):
Or Julian Assange. Yeah.

1 (1h 23m 15s):
But that's not why Tommy Robinson's in jail. 'cause he defamed a young Syria refugee Defamed. Yeah. He lied about him. Oh, okay. Well he did, but he was then No, the guy eventually.

0 (1h 23m 24s):
How many of your leaders are gonna jail for lying?

1 (1h 23m 26s):
What?

0 (1h 23m 27s):
How many of your leaders have gone to jail for lying? They lie constantly. Every time they speak

1 (1h 23m 30s):
They lie. Not enough. Not enough.

0 (1h 23m 32s):
I right around zero actually.

1 (1h 23m 33s):
Yeah. But that doesn't get, but they

0 (1h 23m 34s):
Throw powerless people in jail for saying things they don't like. But

1 (1h 23m 38s):
You also have a defamation law in the United States. People have gone to jail for breaking that law happened. So you're not so pure yourself. You know, criminal. Yes. You, yes You do criminal defamation. You do.

0 (1h 23m 47s):
I'm go and check it.

1 (1h 23m 48s):
I've got go and check it. Okay.

0 (1h 23m 50s):
There's a lawyer thing right there. But he is occupied.

1 (1h 23m 51s):
And you've had, you've had people go to prison in America for defamation, for libeling people, for saying things that you don't like. It's happened.

0 (1h 24m 1s):
Yeah. I'm, I'm just pausing because I don't know if that's true. It's true. I think I would be opposed to that.

1 (1h 24m 5s):
It's true.

0 (1h 24m 6s):
Do people go to jail in the United States for defamation? Yep. Oh, they face civil judgment. They face civil

1 (1h 24m 11s):
Judgment. People have gone to jail.

0 (1h 24m 12s):
You're making this up out of nothing. No,

1 (1h 24m 13s):
No. Go and check it. Oh,

0 (1h 24m 14s):
Lemme check with an actual American people have You're American, right? Is my college roommate

1 (1h 24m 19s):
Born? You can.

0 (1h 24m 20s):
Oh, he was more than You can. But this is my college man who's an attorney. I

1 (1h 24m 23s):
Had this

0 (1h 24m 23s):
Debate That's a civil offense. Correct.

1 (1h 24m 24s):
I had all this debate on Twitter recently. People are, I think there's a

0 (1h 24m 28s):
Criminal defamation.

1 (1h 24m 28s):
There is crime where go and check it in certain states. Thank you.

0 (1h 24m 33s):
Has anyone gone to jail for

1 (1h 24m 34s):
That? Thank you. I've

0 (1h 24m 34s):
Never heard of that.

1 (1h 24m 35s):
Sorry. The British guy is now telling Americans about their own law. I I'm pleased obviously, but

0 (1h 24m 42s):
I I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna dismiss that as a Hey the fifth I've never No, no, no. Not take the fifth. But the point is, you should never allow anybody in your country to go to jail for having unpopular opinions. Would you? It depends

1 (1h 24m 55s):
If they're inciting violence. That's the criteria. What

0 (1h 24m 57s):
Does that even mean?

1 (1h 24m 58s):
I do think, by the way, for what it's worth, that some people have been put in jail for saying stuff on Facebook because they shouldn't have been in jail. I agree with that.

0 (1h 25m 6s):
The criminal prosecution service CPS shared a video in x warning people about using social media and it stated this, and I'm quoting, I can't do the English accent, but this is what they say. Try think before you post exclamation point content that incites violence or hatred. Right. Isn't just harmful. It can be illegal. Paging George Orwell. The CPS takes online violence seriously and will prosecute when the legal test is met. Remind those close to you to share responsibility or face the consequences. That's just like North Korea at that point. You're inciting hatred

1 (1h 25m 38s):
If you're inciting violence against people. No,

0 (1h 25m 40s):
No. Or hatred.

1 (1h 25m 41s):
Right. But the violence you'd agree with

0 (1h 25m 42s):
Inciting violence. Yes. I dunno what that

1 (1h 25m 44s):
Means. It means you literally direct people to go and attack an asylum. See, go tell.

0 (1h 25m 48s):
No, that's directing violence, inciting violence. Well

1 (1h 25m 50s):
That's the same thing.

0 (1h 25m 51s):
No, it's not the same. It's not the same. So if I say pi, I want you to

1 (1h 25m 56s):
Go, go and beat up Alex. Right. That's inciting and directing violence. The same thing. But then I

0 (1h 26m 1s):
I could, you could say same thing and your, it's not the same. Your government is. What's the difference? Hold on, I'll tell you what the difference is. Your government is saying that some opinions are so inflammatory that they inspire people to commit acts of violence. Yes. Okay. That is a definition that def justifies censorship.

1 (1h 26m 20s):
If you want my honest opinion, some of the ones who've gone to prison should not be in prison. How

0 (1h 26m 24s):
About inciting hatred?

1 (1h 26m 26s):
Well, it depends what you are in to do. What does that even,

0 (1h 26m 28s):
How do you measure hatred?

1 (1h 26m 29s):
It? I

0 (1h 26m 31s):
Do You have a hatred meter?

1 (1h 26m 33s):
Me

0 (1h 26m 33s):
Does. Does UK government, I mean you're defending it, so No,

1 (1h 26m 36s):
No, I'm not defending, I'm, I'm literally telling you I'm not defending that. I'm saying there are people who've been put in prison. Why

0 (1h 26m 40s):
Don't you overthrew your government? It's a ter tyrannical government.

1 (1h 26m 43s):
I will always support people's right to have hateful views. That's fine. I don't agree with the government or not, but

0 (1h 26m 48s):
It's a crime.

1 (1h 26m 48s):
I don't agree with that. Right. But it depends what they're

0 (1h 26m 51s):
But what are you doing to overthrow the tyranny that misleads

1 (1h 26m 53s):
You if they're, if the excitement of hatred makes people go and act, commit acts of violence and you intended to, that should be a crime. You shouldn't incite people to go and commit acts of violence.

0 (1h 27m 4s):
But if I say something that the government doesn't like, and this is of course, it's all self-preservation here. They're not, no one is ever penalized for attacking. If the, if you get up and you say, I hate vitamin Putin in all Russians, you're not gonna go to jail in the UK for that. 'cause that's the official policy of your government.

1 (1h 27m 20s):
You wouldn't go to prison in the uk No, no, no. But you wouldn't. They

0 (1h 27m 23s):
Can lynch Russians and you, they'd be like,

1 (1h 27m 25s):
Well you have a right to say that. But you asked me earlier if you said you hate immigrants, you wouldn't go to prison for that. If you said that they're all over there in that hotel, go and throw fire bombs at it. That should be a crime shouldn't it?

0 (1h 27m 36s):
Yeah. If you're telling people, if you're telling people to document,

1 (1h 27m 38s):
That's what most of these cases involve. No,

0 (1h 27m 39s):
Go ahead and check them. That's not, that's not what it said. Actually

1 (1h 27m 41s):
That's not true. No. The cases you are talking about are people who have been

0 (1h 27m 44s):
In prison can't that incites hatred isn't just harmful. It can be illegal.

1 (1h 27m 49s):
So my criteria, okay,

0 (1h 27m 51s):
But I'm talking about your government and I'm asking why I'm

1 (1h 27m 53s):
Told you I don't agree with that. You

0 (1h 27m 54s):
Well that's dictatorship from what I can tell. I

1 (1h 27m 56s):
Don't. Yes. How

0 (1h 27m 57s):
Is it not dictatorship? The government is saying things that we hate are illegal. Put

1 (1h 28m 1s):
You in prison. I'm half agreeing with you. Yeah. Good.

0 (1h 28m 3s):
Right. So what are you doing to change it? So you've got a prime minister now on,

1 (1h 28m 7s):
On on my show regularly saying I think it's wrong,

0 (1h 28m 9s):
But at a certain point, don't people have a right to do what the American colonists did? And that's to throw off tyranny because their rights are inherent. They're given by God because they're human beings.

1 (1h 28m 19s):
So you want 'em to be violent?

0 (1h 28m 20s):
Of course not. I'm totally opposed to violence. You're the one who was justifying firebombing.

1 (1h 28m 24s):
What's the example? Just gave, wasn't it conducted with violence? Of course not.

0 (1h 28m 28s):
But you should be single-minded in getting a government that permits people to live like human beings, not like slaves. Right.

1 (1h 28m 39s):
I don't think anyone should be able to use on social media. They shouldn't be using rhetoric, which is inciting violence. Period. Hate. I'd think this idea of what is hate is a much more complex thing. I don't feel comfortable with somebody who believes in free speech and people saying hateful things and being put in prison. It's wrong. Yeah. It

0 (1h 28m 57s):
Should be happening. Well, inciting violence is an absurd standard because, and this, they tried to take me out many times with this. Some wacko will go shoot innocence. Right. And be like, he watched this show, or Right. He had the same opinions as you. It's like, I couldn't be more against violence. I'm mad at my government because it funds violence around the world. Yeah.

1 (1h 29m 13s):
Yeah.

0 (1h 29m 14s):
So inciting violence is just a way to get your critics to shut up. You can continue to loot their country and wreck

1 (1h 29m 18s):
It. But if I say to people here, can you come and stab Tucker? Of

0 (1h 29m 21s):
Course. Right. Okay. But that's right. That's not inciting. That's like directing. It's like being a

1 (1h 29m 26s):
Criminal master. I think you'll find, look, I may be wrong, but I'm rarely, I think you are. I'm rarely wrong in, in linguistic matters. I think you'll find the definition of inciting and directing is not dissimilar.

0 (1h 29m 36s):
You know, as well as I, and I don't know why you would defend it, that your government is stifling criticism of itself, of its own illegitimate leadership using law enforcement.

1 (1h 29m 47s):
I think in relation to hate crime, yes. They've overreached on that in, in relation to using social media. But they

0 (1h 29m 54s):
Flooded your country. We had

1 (1h 29m 56s):
Riots last time,

0 (1h 29m 57s):
Uck. And that's very unpopular with the native population. Yeah. Always has been. Yeah. Always has been. And the government for 40 years has told them an increasing volume to shut up and stop complaining. And now it's putting 'em in jail for complaining about it. That's, that's

1 (1h 30m 9s):
The truth. That it's not as simplistic as that.

0 (1h 30m 11s):
Of course. It's not as simplistic as that. Of course not. I agree. I'm o over generalizing.

1 (1h 30m 17s):
By the way. You wouldn't have a country without a flood of i It's hasnt really, without a flood of immigrants, America wouldn't exist.

0 (1h 30m 22s):
But you're not America. You have a native population.

1 (1h 30m 23s):
No, but we, it's

0 (1h 30m 24s):
Been there since the beginning of time.

1 (1h 30m 25s):
Why would you object to the concept of a flood of immigrants? You literally got built on it. Well,

0 (1h 30m 28s):
Look what happened to your country. Hmm. Everything. Your country. Well, but my country is by its nature different, built

1 (1h 30m 35s):
On the premise of immigrants.

0 (1h 30m 37s):
You're a monarchy run by the head of your

1 (1h 30m 39s):
Church. There's a monarchy here.

0 (1h 30m 41s):
Right. And they're living as they should, which is consistent with their values. And your country isn't. So that's all

1 (1h 30m 47s):
I'm saying. I, I think our monarchy, well, I think the kings of Fineman

0 (1h 30m 52s):
Really

1 (1h 30m 53s):
Vi King. Yes.

0 (1h 30m 55s):
Hmm. What has he done to preserve England?

1 (1h 30m 59s):
Preserve England? Yeah. What do you mean?

0 (1h 31m 1s):
Well, I don't know. I mean it Well,

1 (1h 31m 3s):
He is a Christian. He should like it. He's the head of the, what is he? He's the head of the Church of England. You should.

0 (1h 31m 6s):
Yeah, he does. Yeah. How's, how's church attendance?

1 (1h 31m 10s):
He goes quite regularly.

0 (1h 31m 12s):
That's all a joke. Dude, you had a Christian country, now you don't. So

1 (1h 31m 16s):
Well, we have a far, that's not a win. That's a failure. We have a far less Christian country. I agree. Yeah. I'm sad about that as a Christian. So,

0 (1h 31m 22s):
Can I ask you, Kiir Starer seems like the most unpopular now that Trudeau's gone. The most unpopular leader in the West.

1 (1h 31m 32s):
He's certainly gone from a winning with a big majority last summer to being incredibly unpopular very quickly.

0 (1h 31m 39s):
Can he, hang on. You got four more years of this ish. Is that right? Yeah.

1 (1h 31m 43s):
I mean, yeah. I would say that there's a reasonable chance he will contest at the next election in four years time. It depends really how the next year goes. I mean, I've never seen anyone lose such political capital so quickly. Yes. And he did it because he came in and decided that the strategy he would do is to say, the Tories were so awful that the country's now in a terrible state so bad that we're gonna have to do all these punitive taxes and we're gonna have to whack the pensioners and we're gonna have to whack the farmers and punish all these groups of people. And everyone was like, wow, you've waited 14 years in opposition and this is what you

0 (1h 32m 20s):
Do. What do the farmers do wrong? I never understood that

1 (1h 32m 22s):
They make our food. I mean, it's ridiculous. Most of them live literally

0 (1h 32m 26s):
'cause British food's not good. Is that, was that

1 (1h 32m 27s):
The problem? Most of them lose money farmers and the idea, he created the impression that a lot of pensioners can afford it. A lot of farmers can afford it. Actually, most of them can't. Most of 'em can't. How

0 (1h 32m 36s):
Would you target farm? I mean, it's just

1 (1h 32m 37s):
Inexplicable,

0 (1h 32m 38s):
But it's happened throughout Europe and the United States Yeah. Attacking farmers. And it seems like part of a bigger should

1 (1h 32m 44s):
Reward farmers. Farmers are the lifeblood of any civilized country. But I guess I'm

0 (1h 32m 49s):
Saying is right. But if you're looking big picture, if you're opposed to famine and you're for human flourishing and people, then you'd want to do whatever you could to have enough

1 (1h 32m 59s):
Food. Yes, I

0 (1h 32m 60s):
Agree. And if country by country, by country, Germany, great Britain, Denmark, Holland, they're all attacking farmers. The United States, maybe there's a bigger anti-human agenda at work. Does it, do you, do

1 (1h 33m 12s):
You see that? I just think there's a, it's a pretty dumb political agenda that's been pursued so far. It's not

0 (1h 33m 16s):
Just dumb. It's like weird. Yeah. Of all the groups you'd attack white farmers

1 (1h 33m 19s):
Makes no sense. And

0 (1h 33m 21s):
It does make sense though, doesn't

1 (1h 33m 22s):
It? Why?

0 (1h 33m 23s):
Well, clearly there's an effort to reduce the human population. If you're, if all these countries think

1 (1h 33m 29s):
You must to starve the Brits and kill us.

0 (1h 33m 32s):
Well, I don't know. I, I don't, you know, you can't assess the motives of individuals. They're unknowable.

1 (1h 33m 36s):
People are trying to starve the British people.

0 (1h 33m 38s):
Okay. I I, I don't know him. I don't know what he's trying to do. Go on Z. No, no, no, no, no. You, no, you come on. Look around the world government after government, after government around the world is endorsing policies that they know will reduce birth rates. Is attacking agriculture. Hmm. And is allowing, I don't know, drugs and food that kill people and make them less healthy. So if you add that all up, you don't have to know their motives. You just look at the effects and you're like, the effect is to kill people. What is going on here? Crap. Do you ever wonder that

1 (1h 34m 14s):
Crap governance by a series?

0 (1h 34m 16s):
But it's consistent around, it's like every country's like, you know, we should tell people kill themselves. How would you ever come

1 (1h 34m 22s):
Up with that at a time when we need more people? Not less.

0 (1h 34m 25s):
Yeah. What do you think that is

1 (1h 34m 28s):
Bad governing? I mean especially,

0 (1h 34m 30s):
But why is it the same in every country?

1 (1h 34m 31s):
Well, just think the food thing in particular. Look how fat everyone's getting. Right? Right. I mean, fat, lazy, sedentary. And you're like, that can't be good for anyone. No. But

0 (1h 34m 41s):
Why is it happening?

1 (1h 34m 43s):
Bad, bad politicians. But

0 (1h 34m 45s):
Why is every politician in every western country coming to the same set of policies whose effect is fewer children, more unhealthy, dead people? Like what? I mean, you don't have to be conspiracy nut to just say, I'm looking at just the numbers from this. Yeah. That is how many kids per family dropping.

1 (1h 35m 2s):
That is the consequence of all the political actions that have been taken. I agree. I don't think it's a mad global conspiracy in the way you might be infer. Well, I don't, I don't, I don't know. I don't know. I'm just, yeah, but I don't listen, I know where you're coming from on this. I don't believe they're actually smart enough to do that from the politicians. Then

0 (1h 35m 19s):
Why are they all doing it?

1 (1h 35m 21s):
All of them? I think because they're not very competent And they, and they're not very good and they're lazy and they're going along.

0 (1h 35m 26s):
Lot of averages would suggest that like, I don't know, the governments of Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, pick another. Mexico would adopt the opposite policies. Like, we're gonna pay you to have more kids. Not one of 'em.

1 (1h 35m 38s):
Here's what I agree with you about. It's wrong and it's got to change. We need more people, not less. We need better food, not crap food. We need to reduce the size of our human beings whilst increasing populations. Otherwise the planet's gonna kill itself. Gonna basically self implode and die out. As Elon Muskie's warning, he's right.

0 (1h 35m 59s):
I agree with that. I'm gonna end on this.

1 (1h 36m 1s):
Have we have, we ended on agreement. I

0 (1h 36m 3s):
Just wanna know, you're, since you're I think good at predictions, how do you think the war Ukraine will end?

1 (1h 36m 10s):
I think it will end. I do think Donald Trump will get a deal. I do think in the end that Russia will probably keep most of the land they've taken. I personally wish that wasn't the case, but I think that's how this gets ended. And I hope that Ukraine get enough guarantees that the rest of their country won't get taken down the line. We saw Crimea go, we've seen the East go pretty much. And I suspect Vladimir Putin, I believe we'll try and take the rest of it. I may be wrong. I hope I'm wrong. I hope it gets a deal gets done soon. Because too many people are dying. I heard the other day that a hundred thousand people on that battlefield died in six weeks on both sides, collectively. I mean, this is a horrendous, this has been the stuff you saw at the som, right?

1 (1h 36m 53s):
I mean, it's like, I totally

0 (1h 36m 54s):
Agree, but do you think it's kind of, I, I strongly agree with you and I have for two and a half years, but why is it only now that we're getting sort of more realistic casualty figures? How could a government fund a war without knowing how many people died in that war?

1 (1h 37m 10s):
You think the Ukrainians have not been telling the truth about it?

0 (1h 37m 13s):
I think the US and British governments have both lied about it and kept those numbers from the public. And I feel like that's a crime.

1 (1h 37m 21s):
They should tell the truth. They should be transparent. That's the case. It's wrong.

0 (1h 37m 26s):
Well, I hope you'll go back to Great Britain and grab him by the throat and make him tell the truth.

1 (1h 37m 29s):
You know what made, you've made me think, go back to Britain and make us, jolt us into action. You know what I like about the Trump thing in the last week? Just the sense of hope. Optimism. Yes. Dynamism. I agree. Even the bit before the election when he went down to watch one of Elon Musk's rockets launch and just the fact that America's back in the business of going into space, aiming to go to the moon, aiming to go to Mars. Yes. Where's that? In my country? Where is that kind of dynamism? Where is someone hitting the ground with 200 things they wanna do? Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. I agree. You may not agree with all them, but my God, the energy that Trump, I agree is expending the dynamism, the aspiration, the the, the thing of making America great again, I, I got a feeling this time around Trump's gonna have a very good four years.

1 (1h 38m 18s):
I'm not so convinced about my country and I want to get that kind of oomph and energy and dynamism. I think that's in Britain because I don't disagree with a lot of the characterization you've had. If we are a country in the doldrums right now, we are.

0 (1h 38m 30s):
And it solves a lot of problems. I think that's really smart. Yeah. You know, the energy, the attitude, all of it. Why are people doing heroin in the first place? Yeah. Why would you wanna do fentanyl? Yeah. Yeah. Because you're

1 (1h 38m 38s):
Hopeless. We have a terrible drugs problem. No, I agree. In our country. Terrible. You have a bad drug problem in America

0 (1h 38m 43s):
And you solve it with attitude.

1 (1h 38m 44s):
Yeah, you

0 (1h 38m 45s):
Do. Piers Morgan, Thank you for taking all this time. I enjoyed it. It's great to see you in Saudi Arabia.

1 (1h 38m 48s):
It was still against us time. Thank you. Thanks very much. That was awesome. Enjoyed it.
