I sit and tell you my story.


And I. Fucking Fitzsimmons. Greg Fitzsimmons. What's Wrong with him? He's finally coming out. No, after all these years. 'cause I'm sick of, I can't, I don't wanna hide it anymore. I'm tired. I dude up. I went to dinner with a buddy of mine the other day. Came out of the closet At Dinner. Yeah. Before we even ordered appetizers. I'm like, Let me get something in my belly first before I hear that kind of news. Well, let me get something in my mouth. If you've had something in yours, you know what I'm saying? That's how I know it's like, yeah, bro.


Because it was, there was nothing to do. You know, I didn't realize how nervous I would get if somebody was like, I guess like immediately gay in front of me. Or like they, you know, It was like a reveal. I don know if it's called like revealing. It's called a surprise. Yeah. It's surprise, Surprise, surprise. Gay surprise. I'm gay. Yeah. But it's, is it a surprise? 'cause we usually know, I, We almost always know you don't have a good this. I had no idea. I'm of a really good gaydar. Really, really good. My uncle used to get the hiccups if somebody was gay around him. Right. Yeah. You get congested. Well, he just couldn't handle it. I think there was something inside of him. The Lord maybe. And You'd see him start to fucking kind of bubble up a little, like a fucking, like he was made outta champagne. You know? He just, you know, dude, the craziest, he was the craziest part though, dude.


Years later. It's just, he got started getting around his son and then he started fucking losing his mind. He thought his son was gay And he wasn't. We don't know. We dunno. We don't know. You know, at higher altitudes, I think people, there's more gay people at higher altitudes. Can you look that up? I think there might be. Well, that it does make sense. I they they're more exposed. Yeah. Higher altitudes. Wow. People at high altitudes have more. Yeah. Right. Wow. You know, it says who should not go to high altitudes? Should Is it, does, should gay people go to high altitudes or no? Well, it says sickle cell.


So brothers aren't allowed up there. Yeah. No way. But, you know, that's probably, it's closer to, to God. So, you know, you're up there. You gotta be careful. He likes who he likes. That's right. That's all we're saying. Dude. Andrew, thanks for coming in, dude. Thank You, man. It's been a minute. Really, really appreciate it, bro. Congrats on on Bad. Friends. All the success you guys have had. Thank you man. Ditto. I miss you. I miss you. Ever since you went to Nashville, we, we miss you like crazy. We talk about you like you're gone. You're not dead, but you're gone. Yeah. We just don't see you as much. What's Different? I know it's a lot different, man. Have Yeah. How's it felt like? What is the comedy scene like? 'cause you've stayed, you've been here the whole time. I know you had thought about maybe moving, you had thought about you went to New York for a little bit.


Yeah. And I don't, I don't want to. I'm not gonna go any. Oh, thanks brother. this guy. Is it too hot? You wanna check it First? No, it's fine. But it, I'll throw it on him. Come here for a second. No, if I, no, I'm good here, man. I like it here. LA's la is, the comedy scene is good. It's, it just got shaken up and then, so now it's back to like, humming again. Like, everything kind of feels a little bit smoother. But for a while It was like, everyone's gone. Everything disappeared. Everything got quiet. Now I think it's like leveling out. Yeah. You know, it's like, if you're panning for, for gold, you gotta shake some of the shit out. Oh. yeah. And. I. Think also, it probably creates a lot more stage time.


'cause I mean, it was hard for like, Joe Tom. I mean, we kind of were coming up like after them a little bit. Oh. yeah. Big time. And it was tough for us to get, you know, like Consistent. Yeah. Right. As much as you, you know, like they, and so that's just the cycle of it, I guess. Yeah. But you, you never had a thought to go to Austin. Right? You were never gonna move down there. I thought about it. I, And I. I'm still thinking about maybe getting a place there. Yeah. Yeah. Just because I went down there for two weeks. And I picked up eight new minutes. Yeah. It was great. And It was like, I need this. You Know. But do you like barbecue? I don't. I mean, not as Tim Dylan.


He didn't like it. Remember? That was his big thing. He is like the fuck the barbecue. Yeah. He didn't like it. Yeah. And fuck. Well, he tulsi Gabbard. He'd always, he didn't like her. Yeah. Why is that? Yeah, He just throws it. It's always a food and a politician with him. You know, like, I hate German chocolate cake and Pete Buder, you know, he just, he always fucking like, kind of put those things together. Yeah. Tim also barbecue. Even the best isn't that good. It's food for uncivilized hicks lesbians and car salesmen. Aw, Damn. Well I am, I am one of those three. I just, I never, it's not wrong. It's not wrong, dude. It's not a meal that I want to eat all the time. Yeah. I think, I think it's a hot take, but I don't like it. I don't, everyone talks about like, it's the best.


I feel sick afterwards. I don't feel good. You, you. Yeah. I feel sick. I don't need all that meat. That's absurd. What am I doing? Oh? yeah, that's a Good point. Am I storing up for the winter? I don't need all that beef for, it's, it's four pounds of meat. Oh, I'm all right man. Yeah. Now when you say it like that, it really is kind of sad. And the sauce is just so much like sugar and like It's sugar. It's all sugar. Yeah. It's, it's burn. It's like burn sugar. Yeah. And they just lather burn sugar on beef. And you have to just sit there and pretend like your teeth don't hurt after you eat it. I have acid reflux in my teeth Hurt. Dude. don don't wanna do it anymore. It's tiring. Oh, That should be the thing. Which barbecue gives you the least acid reflux in your teeth. Teeth. It stings.


Fuck. I never really thought it's so true. I never really thought about that. 'cause yeah, I'll drink a sip of cold water after. And it hurts so bad. Yeah, it Stings. Yeah. Your teeth, your teeth are recovering. Oh. It's like they got into a motorcycle accident. Oh. yeah, they're, they're, they're bruised for a week or two. Wait, somebody told me you got a bike. Did you get a bike? I got a Did you get a motorcycle? No, no, no, no, no. I got like a eight speed, actually, my neighbor told me is that he, I guess it's about an eight speed. Yeah, it's 10. But couple of 'em. Well, did you pay for eight and you got 10? Huh? It's fucking, It's a pretty good deal. No, it's missing something. I gotta go through 'em again. It's so hard to count the gee. It's like knowing if you really have 10 or whatever, it's like a fuck.


It's like, who gives a fuck? Well, it's, and then there's that one that's just like this, whatever that gear is on the bike. Yeah. That's absurd. Like, Hey, I should be juggling. That's the queer gear. That's the queer gear. You're just kicking the air. Hey. Yeah. That's the meat and fellas gear. You know, There was always a kid growing up who could, who knew how to fix the chains when they fell off. You know, that kid, that kid was such a weird, interesting dude. If, if the chains were messed up on the gear switching, he knew how to fix everything real fast. Brake line. He could replace the brake line. Yeah. And then he just disappear into the fucking ether. Yeah. He died. Yeah. That kid dies really young for no reason. Rest in peace. R-I-P-R-I-P. Mike Chauvin. Mike Chauvin.


That was The guy who did it for You. Mike Chauvin. Yeah. He died. Yeah, he died tra really tragically too. Yeah. Yeah. His brake lines were cut. Uhuh, somebody cut his brake lines. What are the fucking irony of that? I know. That's kind of the universe doing its thing. Yeah. Oh. yeah. Karma remembers, man, dude. Yeah. So you so bad for you guys. Just like fucking, it was a perfect combination, man. It Was a good time. It was great timing. And then the pandemic helped the show. But when Bobby went back to rehab, which I've sent him to three times, we're trying to keep him safe and, and clean and he's doing a great job. But when, when he went back to rehab after his dad died, the story goes that he relapsed.


I knew almost nobody knew. don don't think anybody really knew. Like people kind of talked him. Maybe there was suspicion that he was acting weird, but he's a weirdo. So it's like, how do you really, but then he was hiding out a lot. I knew. He told me not to tell anybody. I got real uncomfortable. I kind of started to, you know, question. Like, I'll just ruin our friendship, I guess, and tell him, and tell people. Right. Because he was like, I'll never talk to you again if you tell anybody that I'm using. So I was like, well, fuck it. I guess I'll just lose a friend. And then really, before I started to go after and tell people, Kala came at me and was like, I knew he's using And. I knew. He like used you against me to try to hide it, you know?


And she's like, I'm sorry you had to go through that. But then finally he admitted it to me and he apologized and was like, I'll go get help. And. I said, when, and he goes, when I get out, we'll start the show. 'cause Kilah, when I had filled in for her Tiger Belly, she had been like, go do a show together. 'cause the fans wanted it and people talked about it. So when he got out and he got clean, that's when we started it. And then three months into it, pandemic hit. Hmm. It was almost like a gift from God. 'cause then we got to just shoot all the time and be together in the studio. I mean, truly it was, it was, you know, and you Need that. If you really build in one, I think you've gotta have time. I think that's one thing people that I didn't realize, I think over the years is just like, how much time it takes to do a podcast. There's a lot that goes into it. This is a job. Yeah. And then when I, when Joe, when I first started going on Rogans, and then I realized he does a job, he does this job five, sometimes six days a week.


And then his other job and then his other job. Yeah. And then his other job. And he still has kettle bells in his hand while he is doing it. Yeah. Like in the middle of, in the middle of it. He's just ripping bells. It's, it's, he's the most impressive work ethic I've ever seen in my entire life. That's a good point. Hands down the work ethic is through the roof. And then open a comedy club and change the scene. Yeah. It's ridiculous. It's like, for anyone that has any doubts or any qu questions or even thoughts about him that are, you know, negative or against the grain, it's like you, you don't, you don't understand that guy. He's a, he's a machine. A magic machine. Yeah. I wonder how much pressure he fe and he doesn't let, if he does feel pressure, he doesn't let you see it. That's what's most amazing to me. Yeah. Because, well, I think he's, he's, he deals with it in the only way he knows how, which is just keep going and enjoy it.


One time we were sitting in the green room we were on, when I first went on tour with him and we were playing arenas and I was like, man, this is incredible. You know, like, I was kinda like soaking it in and he was like, yeah, but you know, don't let it get to you. Meaning like, just do it. Enjoy it and make it seem like it's any other show. Yeah. And keep moving. Don't let it be like overwhelming where you start thinking too much, then you get in your head about it and then it kind of consumes you. And then you can become one of those people who's like, how come I'm not, how come it's not, why am I not? Yeah. Let all that bullshit go. He's like, just, just be in it and keep moving. Yeah. He keeps it moving. He keeps everything going. He doesn't Dwell. No dwelling outta that Dude. It's so funny. 'cause I think, yeah, once you get going in podcasting, you're like, you obviously wanna shoot for the star.


So you like, I mean, I know there was a time when we all, I feel like we're trying to not be like Rogan, but It was like, you look, you know, you shoot for the, You wanted to do what he got what he got to do. I wanted to do what he got to do. Yeah. Well you wanna do it. Well, I'm not, I'm gonna learn from Michael Jordan, you know? Right. I'm not gonna learn from Go ahead. You know, Carl Malone, Carl call Malone. Yeah. I'm not gonna learn from Carl Malone and a fucking 12-year-old wife child, you know? Yeah. Gross. And that's alleged. I, people don't know that, but everybody knows that. But I, I do. I wanna know, what was it like touring with Bad Friends?


Me And Bob on tour. I mean, yeah, Because I remember I, I ran across you guys. We, we were in dc DC This is how funny d this is how DC was Theo. I mean, you know, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna do it to make you feel a type of way, but I'm so proud of you and so happy for you as a friend who's known you for so long. I was so proud of like you and your success. And it really does make, you know, it's kind of like, 'cause you're ours a little bit. You know what I mean? Like, I watched it happen. So I was like, just proud of you. I know proud is a weird word, but I'm happy for you or whatever. And when we're in DC we did one show at the constitution hall and Theo was gracious enough to take one night off so we could do it. 'cause the schedules overlapped.


So you did four shows there, right? Or five, something like that. Yeah, I think so. And we barely sold out one and he sold out five. I was like, God dude, it was awesome. But then we met in the hotel. We had a great night together and we were chatting and like, I wanted to be at y'all's show. Well, those Moments were amazing. Yeah. Because like, the road has dull moments where you're humming along on the bus. It was tough. Was it? And you and Bobby are on the same bus. Yeah. Yeah. It was tough. Yeah, It was tough. Yeah. 'cause we have our tour manager on our bus. Like, it's like a group effort. Yeah. Everyone has to be on the bus. But Is that fun? What's it like being in that sort of a cl Like I can't imagine being on wheels with Bobby. That's where it gets extremely alarming. Yeah. Mobile is tough with him. Yeah. Because at least you're on land.


You can disappear. Yeah. You can walk away from him. A lot of Asians aren't good in motion. Right. In any kind of form of motion. Have you ever seen an Asian drive a boat? They're not allowed to. No. No. That's against sea. That's maritime law. No. Asians at at sea. Yeah. It's an old, I think it's from World War I. Well if you think about Asians, like they don't, there's the kamikaze pilots, right? That's a No, that's, and then there's driving Asians is throughout the history of time is beginning of time, been traumatic time. Yeah. Yeah. Has been traumatic for people. And then even like, if you go to look at like Iwo Jima, like the troops, they would hide in the tunnels or in Vietnam in the coochie tunnels.


Like it's very, once they get in motion, they can't handle it. Yeah. They get frayed. Yeah. Well, you know, it's, I think it's tough when they're like, Bob, if you ever see Bob try to like run or like walk fast. Oh. yeah. It's so sad. He starts to wobble. Yeah. He'll get off axis. Yeah. It's kind of strange. I'll have to hold him sometimes if he's in a hurry. Yeah. So I'll shoulder him up if he's in a hurry. So we can walk in a straighter line. Yeah. It's nerve Wracking. And he has only like one muscle in his body. I've seen like A-M-M-R-I of him or something. It's baffling dude. Because I remember he sneezed once and blew his back Out. Yeah. Well do he And the muscle moves. That's what's kind of interesting. He'll, he the muscle, at some point he'll have a muscle just on his high shoulder. Yeah. Yeah. If he twi, if he was moving a lot, it'll move down to his, his leg.


He'll have His swims around his body. Like a coy. It's alarming. Him on a bus was wild. We did 60 some odd cities. Fuck. Oh dude. It, it was wild. Yeah. We stopped and started. Stopped and started. I had a don don't even know if you heard this through the grapevine. I had a, I almost almost had a, well I did have a mental breakdown with him at, at Dolly World. Wait, Dolly World in Tennessee. Dollywood. Yeah. Dollywood. Yeah. Yeah. Had a mental breakdown. Yeah. Huge. What happened? So it had just been a lot of time on the bus. We were just Tired of each other, man. You know, it's hard how it gets, it's hard. And then he was be he, we were supposed to go to D World Dollywood at a certain time, right.


At a reasonable adult time, like 1130 or noon. Reasonable adult. And he had slept in past when we were gonna all go together that he threw a fit about it. That we were rushing him. Which is insane. How, what do you need to really do? You put on the kimono and let's go. Yeah. So we get on the bus, we go, we get to Dollywood, we get in and then he says, I wanna sit down and eat a meal. And I said, we just got here, let's go enjoy it. All the crew is with us. And he's like, I want to eat. You can go do whatever you want. And him, And, I were bickering. And. I just was like, you know what? You're right. I am gonna go do what I want. So I left. And they were all like, oh, where are you going? And, I just went on my own. I just wanted to, some days you wanna just be alone. Oh. And there was only one Uber in Pigeon Forge.


There's one Uber. Yeah. I'm not kidding. There's one Uber. And the dude and his girlfriend were the driving. That was the only car available. Yeah. So they Had, and the guy calls himself Paul Revere Too. Yeah. Which, I don't like it. I don't like it. And his girlfriend doesn't say, doesn't make any, any comments about it. 'cause I said, you're not gonna say anything about Paul. She's not allowed To talk. No. Well, And I agree. But she, he picked me up. And I had told, I had asked him where the closest airport was. 'cause I was gonna fly home to Chicago to see my parents. 'cause I was like, I need a break. We had four days down anyway. And then they got in the Uber hours later and the same guy was like, your Fran asking for a local airport. I think he done took oath. But, so my phone was off, so they thought I left.


Wow. They were like, he quit the tour, the tours over. Yeah. They kinda had a moment of panic. And they, he deserved it because I needed to break from him being a little brat. So it kind of like checked us. But then of course, what happened afterwards, he woke up in the morning. The next day I came back to the bus and he gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. And he said he was sorry. And then it, it was, you know, like anything, he is my, he is my brother. Yeah. But you fight your brother. You fight. You fight. Oh, being on a tour bus is hard, dude. It's, it sucks. You're on top of each other. Yeah. It smells everyone's messy. Oh. Especially with the, you can hear The Oh. yeah. Listening to the way he sleeps. He sleeps. So, it's so weird the way he sleeps. You can hear him Sleeping. Yeah. Somebody said he sounds kind of like a little bit of like a generator. You know, like a Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Like a bad, like he has a bad fan belt or something, you know. Yeah. Something. There's a hiccup. There's a, you know, like one thing skipping over, it needs to be realigned, but he'll never get it done. Like, His dat fan belt is off, you know. Oh, he'll never get it. Fucking realigned. No. He'll never get it realign. He's one. Bobby is one loose. He steps on one bad rock and he's fucking, He's gone. That's it. We, so I don't wanna lose him. So I, I really do take good care of him. But it was a while. It was a great tour. We had a great time. But we're, we're gonna go down to Australia at the end of the year. 'cause we owe that to them 'cause we canceled it. And then after that, we're not gonna tour for at least another whole year For Bad. Friends. Yeah. Oh. yeah. Well, you gotta take some breaks, man. And you gotta, I know you're doing your own too, right?


Yeah. I'm got, I'm doing my own tour in the fall to shoot my new special I'm doing with Hulu. Hulu. Oh, nice. Yeah. Hulu got a lot of Hulu. Pulled a lot of people away from Netflix. Well, I think a lot these days it's a, Netflix was like the first one. And now I think the people are just seeing more. I wonder what can we see where people are watching? Yeah. Burr moved. Sebastian. A bunch of people moved. Hulu. Yeah. Hulu's doing it. Well they're doing one special a month, which is amazing. So you get the whole month. The lineup is insane. don don't even know if half of 'em allowed to announce some of the people that are on there. But it's incredible. Well, Burr says right here, he's gonna be on there. Yeah. He's he was one of the first ones that they got. Gaffigan. Yeah. Jim Gaffigan. Burr Sebastian.


Roy Wood. Is he? Yeah. He's the man. Yeah. I love that. I think that dude is so underrated. It's unbelievable. Did I did Ayahuasca with him, with Roy? Yeah. Beautiful. Beautiful man. Smart, sweet. He's sleeping in the distance. He like, had a couple of servings or whatever and then went and took a big nap. Well, you gotta rest it off. Oh. yeah. You Gotta do what you're, what you're called to do Netflix. Still the top dog though. Huh? Look at that. Streaming services by subscribers in the world. Yeah. Glo. They're Glo. Well, here's the other thing. Hulu goes global in 2025. They're not global yet. Oh. So next year is, that's why they're doing this special. I think they're doing the specials in this regard because they want it to go global finally. 'cause they weren't global before. I see. So I wonder if we can show America alone. 'cause this says globally Netflix has 270 million and Hulu has 50 million.


But if Fifties only in the us. Yeah. Right. That's only US only. Yeah. Netflix has gotta be around 50 to 70. Who knows? 80 in the, in the us. But, but anyway. Yeah man, I'm doing that. So I'm touring all fall to go gear up for that. All fall. I'll be running around. Which I'm excited to do. I'm gonna come. I'm coming your way. I'll come say hi to you out there. Yeah. In N Vegas.

It's your world. Big, big golf. I played some good golf out there. Oh. If you like to have a little bit of whiskey and golf. Nashville really is your place, man. I think about that all the time. It's like, man, I kind of don't have the two great elements that people love here the most. You know? Why Wouldn't you golf? You think you could?


I think I could. I just You're athletic. Yeah. I should probably spend a little more time doing it. I don't wanna go out. I, I've been out there and it's not good. And I don't want to go out there again and waste people's time. 'cause people are a little more serious about it there. Well, see, I, I'm, I'm good at golf, but I don't give a shit how good people are that I play. I couldn't care less. If you're fun, don don't care. Oh. yeah. I just got back from Scotland. No way. Yeah. I went to St. Andrews, the old course. Man. It was so much fun. Was it really? I went with a bunch of friends. Yeah. I went with a couple. I went, I actually went with only one. Good. I went with Charlie Day, the actor and a bunch of his friends. So I didn't, I was like the last guy invited. I was like, Hey man, I, you know. No Way, dude.


St. Andrews. Yeah. What's it like? Honestly, man, it was, it was a dream come true for me. Like as a kid. Those are like, you always wanna play the courses. The pros get to play Oh. yeah. And. I got to play at St. Andrews. And it was, and we played at five other courses. But traveling around Scotland, I mean, honestly such a beautiful, beautiful country, but truly the worst food I've ever had in my entire life. Oh. It's all war meals. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. It's Like, like well get back out there. Get Back out there. Yeah. Yeah. Go like, get back out there. Get, just get some food and go. It's terrible. It's terrible. And also, this is proof. You definitely, you need minorities. Yeah. You have to get people with melanin to get good flavor and spices.


It's way too many whites. It's flooded with whites. Oh. yeah. It's overwhelmed. Well, I've always said too, like, a lot of people are like, we need less crime in some of these cities. I'm like, but you're gonna have less good recipes. Bad food. Yeah. Bad food. Yeah. What's the, you know, what's the balance? Yeah. You want good food? Yeah, dude. If you want good food, dude, you're gonna need bars on your windows. Okay. Sorry. You get a cage door. Big deal. Lock it up at night. But it is so true, man. People don't want, the, people don't want the crime, but they want the food. And that's the kind of shit that's just not fair. Yeah. Skyland was fun. It was just, damn dude. It was beauty. So it was beautiful. We, we went over there for like eight, nine days or something like that.


And it was a beautiful little trip to go golf. But it's honestly, it's a bonding experience for friends. It's just a way to see your friends. 'cause as we get older, we don't see each other as much. Yeah. We just don't, like, we have to run each other on the road. Or you have to set up a good dinner. Like, I was at dinner with Spade and, and Schwartz the other night. And it's like, you, but you have to fight to set it up. 'cause everyone's schedule is like, it's gone. Yeah. It's so you have to co cognizantly go. I'm gonna do it. We have to like, map out the time. So this was a way to like, make no excuses. Say I'm doing it. Don't, don't throw in more work. You know, just go, Oh, that's awesome dude. Good for you for making that and setting it out for yourself. Yeah. That's a hard thing to do too, you know? 'cause I know you're competitive like me and you wanna Keep grinding. Yeah. Yeah.


It's, well, and you, you're a grind addict. I mean, I am too. It's bad. But you're like, I wanna keep doing shows. I wanna keep growing my career and you know, I wanna keep building this thing. 'cause it's fun once you're doing it. But if you don't take a step back to go do a thing for you I don know, man, you're gonna, yeah. You know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, you're gonna be gone. Yeah. Certain parts of you starts to disappear. Starts with my hair. For me, A lot of times I'll start falling. That's when I know I'm getting too stressed Out. We, when you're stressing out too much. Yeah. I can just, like my back. I'll just start finding it. My back will just, I'll lose my back will seize up. I'll start having back problems when I get really stressed out. One time I couldn't feel my foot for like a week. Dude, the worst thing is say you are going to, you're in the bathroom, right.


And you're sitting down and you, you're pooping. That's what I was gonna say, but yeah, yeah, Yeah. I got it when you said sitting down. Yeah. Yeah. So you're doing a poop or whatever doing a number two and your legs fall. So you've been there for a long time. Does that ever happen? I Like that a lot actually. Oh, I love it. That's crazy. I like it because then you get up all wobbly, wobbly. Oh dude, you know, you, when you get up off the toilet, then you look like a kill Tony guest. You know what I mean? You get, you start wobbling around your bathroom. Oh dude, you can't even make it back to wherever you're going. Like, if anybody saw you, then It was like, what kind of shit did you take? How long were you there? Dear God, Brother. Yeah. But you know what's so funny is I got told that you can't, I spend a lot of time in the bathroom.


I read, I like to sit and read. I, you, they say you can't. 'cause that's how you get here. They can look it up. That's how people get really bad hemorrhoids from sitting too long. Uhuh Yeah. But, but I'm not pushing harder. And. I'm not doing it. I'm just sitting and chilling. But they say if you sit too long, that's how you incite hemorrhoids because of the, the blood flow. So now I'm, now, I don't get to sit and chill anymore. But that was my place. See, look at that. Hemorrhoids are when the veins or blood vessels in and around, your honest and lower rectum become swollen and irritated. Yes. Sitting On the toilet too long can cause it. It's, it's bad. You gotta get off of that. I bet this used to happen a lot in like 16 hundreds and shit. Well, think, no, think about this. They used to poop in holes in the ground. They dig a hole.


So they, it was uncomfortable. They couldn't Relax. They weren't relaxing. Right. No. It's quick and out. You know, like if you've ever been camping, I had to camp. I had to poop against a rock. You gotta lean against a rock and poop. You gotta get outta there. Yeah. You don't have time to like, sit and think. Although maybe in like the, you're talking like a Victorian era right? When they, like, when they, when when, whenever toilets were first, like a nice sitting toilet was invented. Yeah. When was That? They Probably did really sit and really, Oh, once some bro, once somebody rolled in with a toilet dude. Yeah. Which is basically like a car for a shit. Right. Right. People were like, who is this?


Well, you know, Kings and queen, you know, Kings were eating on that. You know, they wanted me, once they saw how comfortable it was, you know, they were like, well, gimme a, gimme a meal. Yeah. Oh, That's, that's Gimme something to snack on. I'm I'll, I can just sit here and it can be, yeah, one fluid thing. Gimme a two-Way contract here. Come on Roman times. Can we zoom in a little bit? See, That's actually pretty beautiful. Oh, a group Shit, dude, imagine that. What the f dude? Well, honestly, that's, that's bond. That's bonding. You really want to get close to someone, you group, and look, if you go back up to that group shit shot, you can see their legs have to overs. They can't be leg, but leg. You have to cross your legs over each other. But that's the Romans. They did all sorts of weird shit like that. Those are, they were weirdos, dude. Hey. But yeah, what if you're just like, whoa, nice one Rick. You know, or somebody.


You're just, you guys are in there. Guys, if you can't see this, if you're listening, but there's literally, it's a bath. It's like a Shelf, like a shelf with holes in it. It's a Shelf with holes in, but there's no like little walls or anything in between. It's just, Just sitting cross. Just leg over leg. Yeah. It's almost like you'd be in a sauna. But if somebody cut holes in there and then people were allowed to do number twos as they wished It kind of looks, it looks more Greek than Roman, to be honest with you. Hmm. It looks like Greeks do. Greeks are Greeks were into all sorts of fun stuff like that. Yeah. They were more like perverted and stuff like that. Yeah. Super perverse. By 3 15 80 Rome had 144 public toilets. The Romans treated going to the toilet as a social event. Hmm. They met friends, exchanged views, caught up on the news, and wiped themselves with a piece of sponge fixed to a short wooden handle.


What If you got little last on the sponge? Oh, you wanna be first on that. You don't wanna be the caboose on that sponge. You wanna go nu first. You wanna be number one for number two. Oh, what? Medieval times. Let's cruise up a little bit. This is really interesting. In medieval England, people used potties and would simply throw their contents through a door or window into the street. Yeah. You'd shit and toss it. Yeah. Unreal. Yeah. The more affluent would use a garter robe or protruding room with an opening for ways to suspend it over a moat. Right. Oh, wow. So, so that was almost like plumbing It was like, it had a way to get out to the moat, But that was also, and then that's, then that's another way to keep people away from your castle too. Oh. yeah.


Because they got a shit river floating around it. You don't wanna get in that. You didn't even think about that, about Mos. You thought It was like this clean water. Mm. Ugh. Shit. River bud. See, that's a nice story. That looks like on, on a plane. That's just, that's just an American Airlines. That's just a shot from Frances. Louie the 11th hid his commode behind curtains while Elizabeth, I first covered hers in Crimson Velvet and Lace using sprigs of herbs to disguise the O odors. Well, yeah. You forget they didn't shower. They showered like once a month or some, if you're lucky. Yeah. So they stunk a lot of 'em. St. don don't know which one it was, but one of the, one of the queens, which queen notoriously never showered.


There was one that like refused to shower. Mm. And she loved it. She thought It was like, She's from Slidel or not fake history on her. The curious comes about Elizabeth. The first bathing habits. Yeah. She Oh, she did. So she did bathe. So people said she did. And it was a myth. Huh. That's a bummer. Yeah. I kind of wanted it to be real. Oh, I like them bitches. That's a little bit nasty. Little stanky. You like 'em stanky a little bit. Mm. I I don't like, like post EDC. Yeah. But not like living in a bird bath. You know what I'm saying? Like, Yeah. You want 'em to be, you want 'em to be just a little, you want 'em to be organic, but not, Not farm to table.


Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You want, That's what I want.

Tell me about Vegas. I wanna hear, dude, I'm dude You went to Grateful Dead too. Wow. Dead and Co. Dead and Co. Sorry. Dead and Co. The Dead and Co. Yeah. The Dead and Company. Yeah. I went BBBA couple weeks ago. I went like three weeks ago. don don't know. Adam Ray And. I went with our ladies and we He's Crushing it. Dude, I'm so proud of the kid. I know, it's awesome. Yeah, we went and had a such a good time. It was also like a last minute we were chatting, salvo came in, we had dinner. Adam And I were talking about doing it. And John Mayer, who's a sweetheart, was like, whatever you guys want, like you want tickets or what do you need? And. I was like, don, don't think we can make it do this last super last minute. And then in the morning we woke up And I was like, all right, we'll go.


You know what I mean? We just were like, we gotta do it like it. It's a 35 minute flight to Vegas. Yeah. I was like, we gotta go. And we had an absolute amazing time. And I. It's, it is one of the greatest visual and audio shows I've seen in my lifetime. The sphere is, I mean, it's, it's worth every single dime. They, they overspent on it. Yeah. And they're losing money. I think they're hemorrhaging money that place. Yeah. That's what it says. I know that the, to build the, the, the crane alone that they use to build the sphere and check me on this, but it, there was like, it took a hundred trucks just to bring the stuff.


The crane is made out of it. It was like the fourth biggest crane in the world. God, I think it's from Belgium or Berlin. Well, I, I mean Berlin. But It took that many trucks just to bring the pieces of the crane. And then it took a couple of weeks to put the crane together. Yeah. Who builds what? Crane builds the crane. Yeah. What Crane was first. You know what I mean? Yeah. What's The first crane that built the cranes? So true. At a certain point you're like, oh, we need a crane to build this crane. And then that, who's built what? Crane is building that Back on the crane. Crane. Gang. Gang. That's right. And you know who built it first. Come on. You Know who built the first crane?


The first crane? I don't know Egyptians. Oh, they did? Yeah. That's how the pyramids were built. They built cranes. Of Course they did. Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck? What people are like, who moved these stones? A crane. Yeah. You idiot. What the fuck? What the, A guy didn't do it. They built a crane. Dude, I love how I've met. Every white person I meet is like, oh, the pyramids, aliens. Every Egyptian person I meet is just like, ah. These just some fucking My dad. My dad loves ancient aliens. That's his favorite thing on earth. Yeah. He's obsessed. And. I say that on stage. I say he loves ancient aliens, which is crazy 'cause he hates illegal aliens.


And I said, dad, you can't pick and choose. They both built the pyramids. Man, you gotta be careful. He's obsessed. Why are white? Yeah. Whites are so obsessed with aliens. It's our number one thing. I think it's because like a lot of whites are so comfortable. Too comfortable. Right. They're too comfortable. So it's like you start to worry about other shit. That's, that is true. It's like how you feel. You start to worry about, oh, alien. Like, you know, is there anybody else out there? Like it's definitely those are creature comforts. Yeah. When you get too comfortable, you start to worry about things that you have no familiarity with that you're just gonna make you kind of make it up.


Yeah. Because it feels like it gives you something to do. Right. If you don't, if you don't work, let's say you, you're raising, you know, you're raising a family. You don't have a job. You're stay at home. Mom or dad. There's a downtime when they're napping and what are you doing midday? You're thinking about aliens. Yeah. You're bored. You're around your house, your vibrator is broken or whatever. Well, it's not charged. Yeah. You gotta charge that thing. You can't keep un charging that. Ugh. Put that, plug it in. Get back to square one. This You believe in aliens, don't you though? You gotta, You think I have to. Let me think. I don't, I think you gotta believe in something.


What's out there? I mean, I think we, the crazy thing is what an anomaly humans are. Right? Yeah. This is weird. We're the weird ones. Like if you look in the forest or whatever, they're know, they all know each other. They know what they're doing. Right. Yeah. They know what team they're on. Sometimes they'll fight, sometimes they'll cuddle or whatever. Sometimes they have that video where like that little duck is on that badgers back or whatever. Oh. yeah. But like they know what they're doing and then we show up. Like we're the strange mammal. Like if you were in the woods and you saw a bear, right. Like come out of his hole or whatever, take a couple of pills, cry, jerk off.


Right. You know? And then transition. Transition. Yeah. Transition. And then get on a computer. You'd be like, this fucking, This fucking alien. Yeah. This is an alien. This Is an alien. So maybe we are the alien. You know, like Well We are, we are the alien to something else. For sure. Well Certainly to nature. Yeah. To the rest of nature. It seems like we are the outlier. Like to fish. I always think about fish. We have to be so annoying to fish. Just stepping in their house and then they have to get out of their own house. Oh. yeah. Imagine somebody gets in your house. Imagine you just have to leave. Yeah. And when And then when they're done enjoying your house, then you get to come back. Imagine they show up. It's like he in your house. Yeah. Pissing in your house.


They just come and piss right in. Right in your front. Hey. And you have to disappear 'cause they're 10 times your size. Oh. yeah. Yeah. That's another thing about us being so comfortable. 'cause there's nothing trying to kill us all the time except corporations. And. I was Gonna say for us, except for us. Except for us, We're the best at killing ourself. We're the only species that works really hard on killing ourself. Yep. With everything we consume. Food, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs. We're trying to get rid of ourselves. Even the cooter's bad now. There was a study the other day. Was it rotten? No. Just, it's like some of it was com. They tested a woman's coer or whatever and It was like 20 proof or something.


Where was that? At 2020 proof. Was that at Indiana University? Yeah, I think it was in Bloomington. That sounds like an IU thing. Yeah. 20 proof is bad. That's pretty, that's heavy. 87 8, 870 5,000 square feet of space. That's in the venue, man. Oh. yeah. Covid delayed. I remember that. In U2 was number one, U2 started. Who's there? Now the Eagles are coming. Something like that. Right? Eagles are coming. Yeah. Eagles are about to do it. Yeah. Wait, tell me though, did you love, did you really enjoy the show and have you been a dead fan? Have you, do you like the Dead? I Haven't been a dead fan. I probably know like six or seven other songs probably. Right. Yeah. Well that's, that's so you like's A pretty good amount. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like them. My brother is a, a huge Grateful Dead fan.


But he didn't wanna maybe see Dead and Co. 'cause he didn't want to spoil like, you know, he's like a Jerry, you know, he is like, he, He, he was, yeah. He liked Jerry. Right. And so, but he wanted to go, he lives in by Mount Zion. So we met over there. And. I wanted to go. We, and we wanted to do something together. And yeah, I think, I love that they have so much art. There's so many little things you know, about the Grateful Dead, that since they have a lot of cool and unique art and stuff, they're able to make a lot of neat stuff to put into the visuals. Right? Yeah. Whereas if you were a band, if you're like, you know, maybe or something, or C, Cna, O'Connor, cna, O'Connor, Joe, just Siwa somebody, you're, I don't know if you're gonna be able to fill that space with enough intrigue, you know?


Right. And history. And history. Right. Right. And almost you almost need something that's a bit historical maybe, or something that's extremely artistic. Like a group that has a lot of ambiance that comes with it. Right. You can't do a solo artist would be a little hard there unless they have such a rich story to tell. Right. Like a Michael boo bla or something, you know? I don't know. But if it were just Christmas and they were able to make really cool Christmas shit in there, then that's the way To do it. Oh. yeah. Yeah. Booby at Christmas would be nice though. Yeah. He is really talented. That guy. People Love him. Him at Christmas, I think rest of the year, Whatever. Well, yeah. No, I don't need him. don don't I don really don't need him. Yeah. Boob later. Dude, that's pretty bad. But what else did I think?


I, I thought it was amazing how like, well there's like these things in the seats called like haptics or whatever. And so sometimes your seat will move, right? Yeah. So some of the seats, I think like 10,000 of the seats, They have haptics. Yeah. Right. And they mo and you know, so they'll have like an a reaction or, so that's kind of crazy. I thought it was interesting how sometimes well you get there right in the beginning and it just looks like a futuristic, like kind of cage or something you're in. Yeah. Yeah. Like a ba like a inner workings of a machine. Yeah. It's not just like you're looking at a screen. Right. It looks like Robot guts. Yeah. Or like inside of a video ga Yeah. Something like video game you went into like a space world or something.


And then it all kind of starts to happen. And they don't give you everything at once. They don't show you all their tricks at once. No. They, they roll it out slow. That's a great shot. Wow. That was U2 probably. I bet. 'cause that wasn't that. What's wild about it is they give it so much dimension, you know, through, through, through tricks of the, of the LEDs. And it really is kind of mind boggling. Gets people, I guess people get really dizzy. Like some people get, they have to take 'em outta there 'cause they get so dizzy from the, the movement. 'cause the movement is cra it physically, like it moves so heavily that I think people get disoriented. Yeah. Oh, there's times where like the way that they do it, you're like, you feel like the whole thing is moving through space or time.


Yeah. Like you're the entire venue, It feels like you're moving with it. Yeah. Yeah. I think they said people with like, kind of like, like same thing with strobes. Like people that have heart problems or high blood pressure epileptics or something, maybe epileptics. Or if you're French Canadian, you're not supposed to go there because it's dangerous for those kind of people. Oh. yeah. You know, and that's, it's just a historical unfortunate truth. You get, they get sick easier. Fuck. Yeah. It's sad. But it was a beautiful time, man. It was a beautiful time. I enjoyed it so much and it was long. And like, you really kind of get a story. And I loved it. Yeah. And I thought what was really cool too at the gr at the dead show was like, if you went down to the street, if you went down to just the stage where the stage is and if there was nothing on the back, nothing on the screen.


The stage only had a few lights on it. It literally looked like you were at a backyard concert. Yeah. It's really crazy. It's, it's like, it's so minimalistic and then so yes, grand at the exact same time. It's Really beautiful. I mean, the stage, it, it had like five lights behind the guys or six, like, I mean small, small lights and then Oh, that's U2. That's U2. Yeah. And then it had a very, and so if the screen was off, it'd literally look like you were at a backyard show. Yeah. Like a somebody's, like a band was playing in somebody's backyard. I woke. But yeah, I would totally recommend it. I heard somebody refer to themself as a spearhead after the, like, I'll never see a show anywhere else.


Now I'm a spearhead. It's Pretty limiting. Yeah, definitely limiting. But it was interesting. I'd never heard It was like, I'd never thought, like I'll only see a show at a certain venue. Mm. Yeah. Dedicating to a venue is tough. Yeah. Because You're only gonna get what you're gonna get. Right. But I mean, you know, that's kind of life, isn't it? You're gonna get what you're gonna get. Yeah. So if you become a spearhead, you might as well soak it up. Yeah. Yeah. I But what else? Yeah. What does this crane say? The fourth largest crawler crane in the world. Wow. That's the crane. A a 580 foot tall crane man. Imagine being sars. It's made by a company called sars. Imagine being David sns. That's your crane.


Wow. What does your family do? We're crane guys. Oh. Big money. We're crane guys. Have you ever seen the Costco guys? Have you ever seen these two kids? Uhuh, the son and his dad we're Costco guys. They go to Costco and they just eat stuff and they review it. Oh. yeah. The world is burning. You know, the Statue of Liberty can fit inside of the sphere. Wow. And the sphere's interesting is right when you walk in, it does feel, the whole thing feels like a presentation, kind of, you know, Oh. yeah. Like even the, the in the original interior is so neat. You're like, you don't just walk right into the vi like venue kind of, you know, you walk into like, like a normal venue would be like this other, you know, like the hallways and stuff and the, the the four.


Yeah. Wow. 2.2 billion. Just to, I mean, yeah. Look at the Statue of Liberty. Look at the little tiny girl. Oh dude. All the bitches are in there. Her and all her friends. Yeah. Well, not as much anymore. They don't talk to Sheila. Yeah. They got, she, they got into a big fight, I guess. Oh, you been to Statue of Liberty? Yeah, I think I have. Did you go up in her head? Yeah. Oh. yeah. I, I went up there. Dude, she was just pissed at her ex about something. Mm. When I was there. Right. I actually was fine. I think I was, I, when I went and visit her, she was in her hoe phase, so she was having a good time. Oh damn. She was spreading love. Really? Yeah. I heard That's why France sent her here, dude. Because she Fucking, she had a little lot of control too. Being too much for France, by the way, because they're, they're all hos.


That's, that's, Oh, Paris got ranked the Sluttiest city in the world a couple years in a row. Yeah. Back to Back, dude. What am I doing in Nashville? Well, you gotta go to par. I mean, do you speak French? But being from the south, being from where you're from, people do speak A little bit of French under Orleans. Orleans A little bit of French, right? Yeah. A little bit of like, that's what I'm saying. See that? That's, you're halfway there, baby. Let's go. That just means to let the good times roll. That's a great thing to, well, there you go. That's all you need to say. It's Not bad, but it's gonna be like, this guy just keeps saying, let the go times roll. this guy is mentally Retarded, dude. Yeah. But also welcome to the party. Yeah.


Maybe they think you're, you're worth the fun. That's all he knows. And that's okay. This guy does it. But even seeing this fear from your hotel room, I can't even explain how it feels like something fell off of another planet. Right. That looks alien And landed here. That's the most alien part, is just seeing it. Yeah, It does. Yeah. And walking up to it feels kind of daunting. It feels very like a millennium falcon. Like it's this big Daunting. Yeah. Intricate. Yeah. It is true. That does feel foreign. It feels foreign. And. I. Don't, don don't mean that in a bad way. don don't mean that in a negative way. Yeah. Because I know the word foreign people are really taken to heart these days. Most sexually active cities in the world.


What'd I tell you? Paris baby. Wow. Paris. Paris. Number one. Paris. Number one. They're back to back champs. But Paris has also been referred to as a queer city. Well, yeah. We say that. Oh. yeah. That's Oh. yeah. LA is number two. No way. California has the highest reporter rates a gen. Oh My bad. Syphilis. Yeah. Con syphilis. Congenital syphilis. Yeah. Congenital syphilis. Another piece of data likewise provides that young individuals that come from more than five out of every 10 chlamydia infections. And more than 87% of those are youth of color. Hey. Hmm. London. London. I really would not think London would be high on the Yeah.


I think British women are more casual about sex. I think Europe probably is as a whole. Right? Everybody in Europe. Yeah. We're a little staunch. But I guess that means that if LA's number two we're kind of like a European city. Berlin. Yeah. I, I imagine Germany. Oh, sex work. Homosexual sex have always con had coexist in the idea of commercialization in Berlin. Yeah. The problem with that is you, you know, in Berlin, you gotta kind of be a part of their, what they want you to do. You know, And I don't know if you know anything about that stuff. But in Germany it's a little too much. It's it pretty intense. Yeah. It's heavy. They're Perverts. There are a lot of perverts. Yeah.


Yeah. Yeah. New, York city. I could see that. Oh. Yeah. In New York though. It's just like, if you, like, you gotta bring all your stuff with you in the morning. Even if you're planning on having sex at any point over, you know, it's like You gotta pack for sex. Yeah. You Gotta pack for sex. You got a hammock, you got some condoms, whatever.

It's too far. Dude. Trump. Yeah, man. Insane. Where Were you when Trump got shot? Man, I'm not gonna tell you. That's, if the government's listening, just in case don don't want anybody to hear. Where was I? I was, I was, I was at the h Oh, I was at the house. I was at the house. And, you know what's so far? I, my, my, my instinct was like, I'm not even kidding. That's what time we're in now. I thought it was ai At first I thought, this is a, someone's pulling a prank. Yeah. On people. I was like, someone is a, doing a very intricate, coordinated prank.


'cause AI is that good. They could make that up. But then I kept, you know, then obviously it, it got exposed that it was real. But for a long, I'm not kidding. That's how fucked the world is that I thought maybe that was fake or that it was, this was all made up. Yeah. It was. It was a trip. It still might be. Still Might be. Yeah. I mean, who, we don't know. We weren't there. I wasn't there. I have no idea what's going on in Pennsylvania. That's how so weird the media is these days. Like, if you don't know and you weren't there, if you really step back for a second, you're like, who knows what the, you know, How could I know? How could I know that that's real? I don't know. I mean, could have, could have not took it took the hit though. Oh, It was crazy, dude. Yeah. That image, him yelling, fight. Fight. Yeah. Fight My God, dude.


What in, I didn't know. It's Put that on the American flag. Yeah. You know, put that right where the stars are. It's, that's the wildest thing I think I've ever seen is a, a guy gets shot and then champions like a, like a, like a guy who tore his ACL Yeah. On the field and is doing like, giving outta the way out. Yeah. I mean, that image is just insane. The craziest thing is I've seen the, a guy on the right at the UFC fights like seven times. Right. I was gonna say, he's his, like, he's his number one guy. That guy, he looks so familiar. It's like, so many things were crazy about this. I was, let me think. Where was I at? Oh? yeah. So I was in, yeah, I was in Vegas.


Where we waiting, we were gonna go to the show. I went to watch, Diplo was playing at like a day party somewhere. So we st I stopped by there. He comes walking up, he's going on stage. He's like, dude, guess they shot Trump. And. I. Like Diplo told you that. Swear to God. He goes, they shot Trump. Yeah. And, I was like, what is it a new song or something? He goes, no, they shot Trump. I was like, no fucking way, dude. I mean, and nobody had said anything. Right. And he's like, yeah, man, they shot him. And he goes, oh, this was, I started, he goes, and Mike fucking dad just walked like, like the door was closed, walking out to the patio, and he didn't know. And he fucking walked right into it, dude.


And It was like, it was the same thing now. I mean, it is, it is just as disturbing. No, I agree. Look, you gotta care about the man closest in your life for sure. Right. But it was just so funny. He told me those things back to back. Dude. And, I was like, those aren't exactly the same, but I'd, you know, I'd love to meet your, I'd love to meet your dad. I hope he's feeling okay. Right. Similar injury. Yeah. And then he just got up there to start a fucking getting Party going forward. Party keeps going. But, so that was just kind of strange. And then, oh, he showed me the video on his phone Of the kid of the, of, of the shooting. Yeah. Yeah. And the video started and he wouldn't forward the video. You could tell It was like a long video. And I, like, yeah. You like skipped forward a little bit. Yeah. But it was nice. I'm like, is Diplo really giving me me this much time to stand here?


Like, he's just got like, I feel bad. I'm wasting his time. Like, I'll move the cursor, but it's his phone. Yeah. You're not allowed to move the cursor on somebody else's phone. That's interesting. Crazy dudes. That's so flagrant to touch someone else's phone. Oh. What was the kid's name that did it? What? They got him right? They got the, he's dead and gone. And Crooks. Thomas, Tommy Thomas Crooks. Tommy Crooks. It sounds like it. Yeah. Tommy, it sounds likes he would do it. Yeah. Tommy Crooks, who did it? Dom is crooks. Yeah. But then you see a picture of the kid and you're like, what? No. Well, one of the wildest things is that people are saying there's no way. Did you see the diagram of where it happened? No. No. Was it, it really?


What is it intricate, Bring that up. The Diagram of like, who, where he shot Him from the layout of what it looked like. Right. It's like Oh. yeah. He was right next to the Right. And this is like, Trump was speaking like off this way. Right. That's why he got his, that right ear. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go to that. Lemme see if that helps a little bit. Wow. Location of law enforcement snipers on roof stage where Trump was speaking. What were the snipers doing while they, they couldn't see the gunman, Bro. It looks like the only build, the only roof that was close to them was that one. So how did they not, And people were saying, you seen the videos where people were like, Hey, there's a guy right there.


And they didn't see it. Huh. A little weird. This fucking dude. Now this could be easily an actor. That's me. That's, that is me, me with one of those ma silicone masks on from him. It's like the guy FII hat that you buy at the store that comes with the hair. Walked. He's, his FET is going. I, well, he was, he was up there. We was yelling. They didn't know. We kept saying, dude, he's on the roof. Dude. They wasn't listening. I mean, you could, that mouse, We could play it. But that's exactly what it's, I think play 20 seconds of it. Couldn't see him, but we could hear him.


So we walked up. Oh, It is a fake hat. What It was, it probably five to seven minutes of Trump speaking. I'm estimating here. I have no idea. He's got chewing too. But big old dip. But He got chew stuck in his neck. We noticed The guy crawling arm, you know, bear crawling up the roof of the building beside us, 50, 50 feet away from us. So we're standing there and you know, we're pointing, we're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof. And he had a gun. Right? He had a rifle. A rifle. We could clearly see him with a rifle. Absolutely. They called him out and no one did anything. The police are down there, running around on the ground. We're like, Hey, man, this guy on the roof with a rifle. And the police were like, huh? What? You know, like, like, they didn't know what was going on.


You know? We're like, Hey, right here on the roof. We can see him from right here. We see him. You know, he's, he's crawling The police. Were, huh? What? And why? Have the cops ever been like, huh? What? Think To myself, I'm like, why is Trump still speaking? Why have they not pulled him off the stage? I'm standing there pointing at him for, you know, two, three minutes. Secret Service is looking At us. Okay, stop it. I'm gonna call this dude dog. Go do something, dude. Oh. Yeah. What are you Doing? You're point at it for two minutes. When you fucking just finishing a beer fucking 50 feet away. You have God gives you one chance to be a fucking hero. And instead you pop open another fucking bush light. Dude, Both of these gentlemen don't are just interesting creatures.


These, these are actors, dude. Yeah, dude. This is a fucking, the backup dude. They got this dude off of team who, this announcer look what he is even using to interview him. Yeah. That's not even a, it's a mop. It's even a microphone. That's a Swiffer. Swiffer. Yeah. Well, I don't try, this is very untrustworthy. That's so Untrust. Very untrustworthy, trustworthy Dude. I don't like it. But to think though, right? So they secure a perimeter. Imagine seeing, okay, you have a 20-year-old. He walked over there with a rifle bag. He walked like a half a mile, I think it says. And Nobody said anything. That's, that's the part, to me that's like Half a mile is a long way to walk with a big ass rifle.


With a fucking rifle. Now you are NPA. It is a Trump rally. So the weird thing is, you almost expect everybody there to be walking with a rifle. They Give you one on the way in. Yeah. Yeah. So you kind of expect a lot of that. Like, yeah, This is, this is a part of it, right? Yeah, that's True. Like the ambiance. You know what I'm saying? Like, if it's at a Biden rally, somebody says him to the rifle, you'd be like, oh, what the fuck's going on? But I feel like at a Trump, it's more like a, you know, American symbolic Yeah. N rra. Bring your guns Plenty of times. This Is crazy though. These people are watching him right here. Gary is Right there. Right there. You see him? He's laying down. You see him? Yeah. He's laying down And I here with you fighting like hell to get what's happening.


And just make sure we take Well, they see a guy. Oh, that guy's walking with his child. Yeah. Look, look, here he is. It's because we have millions. And where Oh my God. Dangerous people. Criminal. We have roof. Wow. I've never seen it On the road. It's much tougher than it's, it happened on rules. How on earth are there not cross in Recorded history in The best quarter. In Fact, if they could ever put up a chart, don don't know if Okay, that's, I can't, Can't tell what's going on now. That's, but yeah. Just unbelievable.


So yeah, you start to wonder, was this put together? But how do you convince a 20-year-old to just go do something like that, you know? Mm. Pack of cigarettes and a, you know, And I don't know some gas money. 20. Yes. True. What were you doing at 20? You could convince me of almost anything at 20. Oh, I hope the photos don't show up. I know that. Yeah. Twenties. Twenties are tough. Twenties are a time when I could I be convinced to get on a roof? And That's a good point. Huh? I don't 20 don don't. Maybe don don't know. You're so gullible. It just depends on, Sorry, I was saying, it came out that he, Thomas Crooks was featured in a BlackRock Commercial. I saw this. He was in BlackRock in a, in a advertisement for BlackRock.


This is where it gets real shaky. This is where it gets real shaky. It's like a, it's like a commercial for BlackRock. It is. Yeah. It was like a commercial. And he's in school. Look right there. Wow. Wow. So creepy. Fuck, dude. It's, everything Gets a little twisted, dude. But now, will Trump be able to speak publicly somewhere again? Like, how are they even gonna manage this moving forward? They're gonna Have to do what they do with the Pope. You know, the Pope Mobile? You know the Pope shell, they'll just give him a Trump. Shell Put him in a little Trump tube. Yeah. He'll name it. He'll sell it. Yeah. He better. He have, You need protection.


You gotta get a Trump tube. They shot me. They shoot me. They can shoot you. Yeah. That like the Pope Pope is. Oh, That's cool. It is dope. Why doesn't, like Jeep should sell that. You know, someone in LA would buy that. Of course. Someone in LA be cruising around in that. Well, remember that chick that banged the clippers on her? She wore that visor all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What was that chick's name? My little silly rabbit. That girl. That was so weird. So Funny. Yeah. I'm his right hand man arm. She was brilliant. But dude, yeah. I just, I I, I mean, I can't even believe it. The craziest thing is, Yeah, that girl, You're almost like, what the, it almost feels like it's all part of it.


Just like, I'm almost, not even, I'm, I'm surprised. But We're the, it's theater. It all feels like theater. Yeah. We're in the middle of like, the craziest play we've ever, we've ever lived. That's what it feels like. And what act are we in though? Are we in the third act, do you think? Is this it? I think, you know, it's funny. You think it could be like, COVID was intermission. Covid was intermission. That's what I call it now. I call that intermission. Dude. Dude, I love that. And now we're seeing the, the rest of the play is about to play out. Fuck, now it's on. This is, oh, and there's the lady right there Who is that says female Shane Gillis. That's was not doing her best work. What?


You see that lady tried to holster her gun a few times. It did. It just couldn't, wouldn't go in. Yeah. That's tough. Yeah. I think that's my Aunt Libby. There's no way She's made bombs here on the Show. You know what Mercedes like? But this is crazy. Yeah. Putting him in the car. Well, the crazy thing is they don't even bring him down to the ground when they're at the podium. No, I know. They stand, stand him up. They stand him back up. Up and walk. Walk him off. Yeah. An easier target. Which is crazy. And he keeps saying, let me get my shoes. Well, they weren't nice. If they're nice and new customs, you do wanna get those back on. They probably are. Yeah. It's funny. This is what they trained for. This is Unbelievable. Get 'em in that, get 'em in the car and then they slam on the door.


It's Like he puts our glasses on. Put your shades on, dude. You don't wanna see your eyes. What? That's wild. What can you even imagine though, like, your job at Secret Service? There's so many. It's all downtime. I'm also shocked that they wear sunglasses. The Secret Service doesn't have like a thing that they can permanently put around their eyes taking on and off. Sunglasses. Yeah. Pain in the ass. And I 'em all the time. And I lose. I'm, I'm gonna, the pair I brought in here today, I'm gonna lose it. I'm gonna leave it here in the studio. Lose 'em all the time. Yeah. I'm trying. I just, you start to wonder what is it a conspiracy? They do, they want us to think it's a conspiracy. Because now there's no, like, the guy's been a martyr after the justice system went after.


Right. Whatever you think. Like I've always thought that Trump is a shady businessman. Right. Do I think that he's a very personable guy? I don't know. I don't know him well enough. The most interesting thing I've seen him do was when he's turned like that and said fight it showed like that. He, 'cause there's a lot of people think, oh, he just wanted, they're gonna want, you know, to turn back around. Yeah. And face the crowd again. Yeah. And face the crowd. And face the shooter too. I mean, you're face, you don't know what the fuck's going on. Right. You're making yourself visual. That's, that was really interesting to me, man. You know what I'm saying? Like, he's a key. Right. So Bold and those other guys. Well, the other secret service, like, please get down. 'cause their their heads are targets.


Fuck. It's just crazy. Have you, have you seen about this guy on the internet? The guy with that hat, that goofy fedora in the background? Oh? yeah. This guy, they're, he's all over the internet. They're, Who is that? I don't even know. But he's, he says name's come up a hundred times. The guy who's holding his phone and they say A clown. That guy's a fucking, he's A Simpson's character clown dude. That's Matt groaning. That's a Matt. Yeah. That's Michael Jackson. That's The Simpsons. God. That's right. That's Michael Jackson. If he never got molested and learned to dance, dude, I feel like, you know what I'm saying? It's insane. Well, Here's the crazy part. You have white dude, you have Kappa Sig right behind him, just smiling.


Like, why aren't all those people hiding? That's what I didn't get. No panic. No panic. They were just shooting. No panic. I mean, they show the tape. That guy doesn't even flinch. Fedor. Fedor, that's his name. Yeah. Yeah. Fedor. Man. He doesn't even go down. But Wouldn't you, if somebody starts shooting at somebody gone. I'm Gone. Gone. Abs, I'm, I'm crawling on the ground and I'm out of there later. Email me and we'll talk to you later. I'm a, I'm absolutely out. I'm not hanging out at all. Do you think a marksman could have been accurate enough just to graze him on purpose? That would be too hard, Honestly. Maybe Those guys are good, dude.


They could not, they could shoot an earring off somebody's ear. Look at him there. There's Vincent. That's his name. Vincent. Just hanging out. Shooting happens. He still stood up. He didn't even sit down when the first shots ran out. He was just hanging out. Now I do know, it says on the internet he has bad knees, but he just stood up. Just hanging out. Yeah. But what Fight, fight after phrase. Yeah. No panic. Pretty incredible. I don't know what they want us to believe. That's a good question. Do they want us to think it's the conspiracy? Maybe. Yeah. Because then, then the wheels get spinning more. Yeah. Right. Yeah, For sure. Man. You don't think Biden has anything to do with it? I don't. I mean, I, I wouldn't be surprised if like the FBI or the department adjuster or one of them, there's something going on there.


I wouldn't be surprised if someone who's compromised at Secret Service, but I don't know how you convince a large group of people. You know, like you have to convince the local police as well. It's like pretty Exhausting. don Don't think I could name five police officers in Pennsylvania. That would probably not stand up to help for Trump. Probably like a lot of those guys are. Yeah, true. That's true. You know? Yeah. Military and, and police. A lot of 'em are Trump supporters. Those people are getting bribed money. Yeah. But it's just interesting. don don't know how you figure that out. And then, but yeah. How is a 20-year-old kid use a ladder? Get up. It just is like, there's nobody standing in any of these areas. No one. Yeah. No one's going. What are you doing? Not one guy, just one walk by guy.


What are you doing? Yeah, that guy. He didn't get any. What are you doings? I don. I mean, this is gonna make for, it's just Unfuck unbelievable ladder. He brought the ladder. Did he plant it beforehand, Bro? He set up Beforehand. He set it up beforehand. So he went there before. Set up the ladder. Dude, that building is, looks like it's about 12 feet, Right? Huh? I wonder what business is in there. Oh, they didn't secure. It says, now, se Secret Service did not secure the nearest tall building. A ladder had been placed in advance of the shooting on the building. Attendees alerted law enforcement to the presence of the shooter. So, Little shaky.

Well they, when they Talk about Make America great again, that's what we're talking about.


Yeah. GST strings in the, In The, in the outfield. That's what we're, we're not talking about anything else. We're just talking about that. Yeah. Just let things be man Fun. Everything now has a rule. Or it's fucked up or something. Dude, Everything has a rule. That's a really good call. Everything has a rule now. It's like, Can't do that. Yeah. Can't do that. Well, you Can't do it like that. You gotta do it like this. You gotta do this. Right. But I don't know if that's because we ruined just humans ruined it. Yeah. We did. Humans ruined it all. That's all our fault. We fucked it up. We, instead of letting things be and just in trying to enjoy things, we fucked it up. We just want, we're greedy. We're selfish. We're self-involved. We don't care about each other.


'cause if we really cared about each other, we wouldn't, we wouldn't go out of our way to try to hurt people or bring people down. We don't care. It's a bad thing. Well, and if some people, if once there's some bad apples, other apples start to be like, I need, I think there can be a tendency. Bad rubs off. Yeah. It kind of rubs off. Or you have to also get bad now to be able to take care of yourself. You know, to be, to be a level. It's like you gotta bring yourself to a different level. You're a good apple. Thanks man. You are too. You've always been a good apple. You Are too, dude. And you know what? I think the older we get in life and career, the more I start to really see through the smoke of all the bullshit and start to care about what I really care about.


Like things that you, I guess you really learn what really matters. It's stuff that your parents would say, or older people would say to you. And all those cliches are true. It really is true that you just, you slow down, you step back, you start to kind of see things for what they really are. And you start to just cherish things that matter. You don't give a shit about the other stuff anymore. Yeah. I don't care about small stuff as much as I used to. It just doesn't matter. You just gotta enjoy it. Yeah. I think some of that, it, it is wild if you're able to get some age that you're able to get some Perspective. Perspective. Yeah. It is nice. But that was, what is that Bobby Lee with Richard Simmons. Rest in peace. Yeah. Richard Simmons just passed away, man. But I, and some on the internet are saying that's is Bobby's fault.

Wow. That looks a AI for some It does see that. That also looks fake. Oh Wow. It's just crazy to see. Like I bet Richard teased him or just touched his Neck. Well, I think it's vice versa. I think they both, Bobby is a big tease. Bobby. Well, he said he let some guy eat his butt or whatever. One time. One Time. He's been involved in some crazy stuff, huh?


Yeah. I think a few, a few times. He's, Yeah. That's what's crazy. I think I would not want some guy to do it. That to me. No, not for me. I know. Look, it's hard to be a business partner and a, and one of my best friends with someone that I respect so little. That's, it's tough. I love him to death. He's my perfect, my, he's my comedy compliment. I've never met somebody more than, I feel the most in tune with comedically. Really? Just because he's, he's, it just feels like we, our brains connect on a just a dumb, perfect level. And I understand him.


And he gets, he gets me and he knows what gets me mad. And I know what gets him mad. It's just one, it's something about it. So fun. Yeah. I feel like a kid when I'm with him. Whenever we get together, it's the most fun. I've said this a hundred times, it's the best thing that's ever happened in my career. Of all the shit I've done, of all the things that I could be like, that was cool. I'm proud of that. It, this is by far the most fun I've ever had in my life. It's a, it is a blessing from the universe. And thank God, me and that little dumpling are together. Yeah. Because I, it's the, it's the most fun I've ever had. I've never had that much fun in anything in my career. No. No crushing on stage. No TV show accolade. Really? Nothing. Wow.

It's what you've gotten to do. You know, it's, isn't this rewarding? This is like how fun. I get to have fun. But You've also gotta do so much acting. Does it compare? Do you, yeah. Like, now that you've had a good taste of both, does one really compare? Are they two totally different things? Obviously they're different, Such different animals. But I mean, they're both rewarding in their, I mean, like, the acting is rewarding in its own little way. I like the acting stuff. If I get to work with people that I'm impressed by, that's what it, you know what I'm saying? Like that's, to me, it's like if I do something with someone that I'm intrigued by or impressed by their skills and ability.


It's cool to see people do cool work. It's just a cool thing to watch Oh. yeah. You know, like when you see a pro, like, you know who the most pro dude on earth? I think John Cena might be the most pro dude on earth. Yeah. He was on Whiskey. Ginger. Yeah. He's the Man. Yeah. He's responsible. He's smart. He's sweet. He's caring. He's hardworking. He's such a fun, nice, like, wonderful dude. He's a pro. Yeah. He's, he's a pro. I i, I don't even know how to like, articulate it the right way, but incredible gracious, sweet. Never steps on toes. Never is disrespectful to anybody. Never has an ego about anything. It's wild. He is a lesson in life.


I've tried to, like, I watch him when we were working together. I was like, this dude is, he's a g We're common. I think what we have to remember sometimes is we're a comic. So something is fucked up about us. We were in that returns basket, Remember? A hundred percent dude, we went right back. You know what I'm Talking about? Yeah. When you see like the sale basket or whatever, or the like 40 cent candles or whatever, and you're like, this bitch ain't gonna burn. You know? Yeah. Yeah. It's like we are, that's so a lot of times I feel like we, I'll compare myself to other, or in some ways I'm like, God, but then I gotta remember I, something was wrong with me. But you're spec. It's in a good way. You're Special, but in a good way. 'cause we we're able to maneuvered enough Right. And make it worth something. Right. We're the, you know, we are the, we're the shopping cart with the wobbly wheel.


The one that nobody wants. Yeah. Look at that. Yeah. That's, we're we're that we're wobbly wheel. And you know what, when you do take it, you do realize it's kind of fun. Yeah. It's funny. It goes off on its own. It'll hit the wall a few times. Yeah. But it's fun. It's kind of fun. Oh, It'll be right into a fucking cute mom. Yeah. It might help you out. Yeah. Yeah. We're the wobbly wheel. And you know what? That's, but that's, you're right, we are different. We're a different species and we feel that sometimes we feel threatened because people don't get us, or we're weird or we try weird shit. You know, you, you try a joker a bit and it doesn't work and people are like, what? But that's the beauty. You're, but that's the beauty of it.


If you didn't have that, everything would be real formatted and real simple. So they, those other people from the other side of it, they love to see us try. 'cause they don't do that. So that's, you know what I mean? Like, I've had a bunch of people, actors say to me, I say, oh man, don don't know how you want to improv those lines. Like, why, why do you wanna try and do that? I said, well, 'cause that's the adventure. The risk is amazing. If you get something out that's worth it and good. It's like, it's just telling a new joke that works. You know, when when you write a new joke and it works? Oh well the first time you're like, Woohoo. It feels incredible. It's the same thing as when you land a good line. Yeah. It's the same, it's the same feeling. Oh, I love that. The other day somebody said Enigma And, I was like, careful, careful.

Yeah, I don't think so. It'd be such a fun dad, man. I Would, but you know what I'd like at this age in my life, I think, 'cause now, you know, 40, once the 40 number is real, I think I'd be willing to adopt and try to give someone a, a good life.


You know? Wow. Yeah. I think 'cause at this age, it'd be hard to start with a baby as older as, because I feel older and it'd be tough. So I think that Really, Yeah. Well dude, I'll be 80 when they're 40. Yeah. But that's their, their, that's their problem. Yeah. But I, I'd rather adopt a kid. Put him into a phenomenal situation. I feel like at this stage in my life, it would be cool to give someone a better life who had Yeah. A tough life. Of course. 'cause a lot of kids have these, these, you know, man, you see a lot of this stuff and you see how hard certain young people have it. And, and there's, you know's no hope. And, I've been blessed in life.


I'm so lucky. So it's like, why not give someone else a good opportunity? don don't know. Yeah. It'd be cool if they had a contest too, to be your kid. Yeah. Well that was how, that's how I would organize it. They'd have to show off somehow. I'd wanna see their skills and abilities and talents. I would rank them. I have a set system at home that I've written out. How high can you jump? You know, I basically put 'em through a combine, you know what I mean? I make my kids run the 40 Oh. yeah.

Just like, oh, I think so. And then also you could have rich people bet on it, like in the distance.

Well, look, when our, when, when, when, when Europeans came over for Ellis Island, you had to, you sh you had to be able to do 10 pushups, otherwise they wouldn't let you in.

You know the song, you know the song the way, where were they going without ever knowing the way, remember that? Yeah. You anyone can see the road that they walk on his pick. Okay. So I learned online that song is about a story that the lead singer read about a couple.


Right. Look at the history of the way. It's about an old couple who used to vacation somewhere and she had dementia and he was old. It's tragic. And they would take this, they would take this trip. That's the couple. And they got lost. And Austin based couple, right. Austin based, couple fastball topped the charts with their hit on the way. Yes. And this real couple, the story is so sad. They, they like would go to the same location. I think It was like Zion or something like that, or the Arche. And they drove somewhere and they got lost. And the, you know, the dementia, you know, they wandered until they, until they were found dead in like a ravine.


No crazy. Yeah. Yeah. They wandered and got lost. So that song, as beautiful as it was when we were young, I mean young people Dunno that song at all. But it's about this old couple getting lost. It's the darkest shit. It's a dark story. Wow. Yeah. It says, for Layla and Raymond Howard, the tradition was Pioneer Day. That's right. In temple. Right. And they would drive there and they would just go and they Right. Showing symptoms of memory loss. And he had had surge brain surgery And They just got out of their car and they started walking and they just disappeared. Where were they going? Going Without ever knowing, knowing. Isn't that so creepy now that you're that? Yeah.


As a kid, I sung that song being like, anyone, can you do rug? I thought that was a great song. And Here I am, just two senior citizens just dehydrate gritty, dying behind a Fucking rock. Just buzzards pecking their head apart. It's terrible. Fastball The song's, lyrics. This is way better. Thank you. The song's lyrics revolve around a couple who decided to leave their lives behind by going out, driving without telling their children about their plans. Their car breaks down during the trip and they continue on foot. The course expresses the idea that the couple are achieving happiness by living to losing touch with the world, even though they may never see their home again. Wild, Wild, Sad. Do you ever have a, do you ever, ever have a thought about Disappearing? Disappearing? Yeah.


Sometimes I think about like, Like Tupac and Maybe like two more. Oh dude, when I was in, we tried to like fake my death or something a while back. Maybe like 11 years ago or something. Well, if you got a, this staff can't help. I mean, Nick is gonna blow it. There's no doubt. He'll blow that easily. Dude, he'll leak. He'll leak the conversation. Oh. yeah. He's gonna leak the plans. But what happened? Oh, my buddy Paul, he's like, dude, we should fake your own death. I think there's some money in it or whatever. And I was like, oh fuck. Well, what do I have to do? And he is like, you just be quiet and just go out to Palm Springs or something for a couple months or go to Syracuse or something. Yeah. And I'm like, oh shit man.


And I. Think I did like three days or something. And then I was like, ah, fuck it dude. I'm wanna live again. And so he'd like called a couple people and been like, oh, I think something's happened at Theo or something. Right. So then he just called him back. And I was like, ah, no, no, no. He's just fine. You can't. Yeah, you can't. He's In Sacramento or whatever. It's too hard to go through with it. But if I feel like if I was gonna disappear, I would go, I'm telling it now. Come find me.

It I don Dunno if it was my, one of my first, but no doubt I saw them. And a band called Face-to-face. Do you remember those guys face to to Face. Face to face to face. Face to face to face. And no doubt were playing. Was it Knight? Is that them? No, no, no. It they were face To Face to face. That's it. You're thinking about That's Duran Duran I think Where I could No, that's, no, that's, that's no, that's culture club. But, but I think face, face to face and no doubt were one of my first. And then Wow. Who took you to that? Oh, I probably was 16 or 17 Matter. Well, Love her dude. I think she's one of the greatest Oh. yeah. Tragic kingdom. That album is so, so good.


I became a teenage girl while listening to that Oh. yeah. I was like this, I'm, this is my girl phase. Oh, I Cried at school when someone sang Jewel once Oh. yeah. Well that'll hit you hard And I. Just, I'd never heard a woman say. And then you hear her regular talking. She's Like, oh, someone New Orleans Avenue. It's so Good. Yeah. That. And then I saw, and then the up in Smoke tour up in Smoke. Look that up if that's right. Cypress Hill. Yeah. Up in Smoke Tour. I think It was Like Oh. yeah. I was at that day. It was like, method Man and Red Man, Cypress Hill. Cypress Hill. Was anybody black or white with weed? That's what it Was. Right, Right. That was it, Dre.


And, and The crazy thing was you were so high, they could have told you somebody was on stage. You'd Have been like Yeah. Wouldn't have mattered. Yeah. It didn't even know Nate Dogg never was there. They put him on every picture. He, he, I never saw Nate Dogg once live. They probably just used him like just he was Late to every Show. Promo. Yeah. Yeah. He just never showed up. That's like boss man. Dilo was supposed to come on the pod and fucking Just bailed. 20 minutes after. He is like, I ain't coming. Mm. Thanks man. Thanks for The heads up. Thanks boss man. Thanks man. Man, Dude. There he Is. You've been demoted to assistant boss brother. I'll still listen to your music, but not for two weeks. Yeah. That was the first couple tho those I saw the, those like li I saw D 12, I saw Eminem and D 12 when I in High school.


Wow. I was listening to a lot of rap stuff and some Gwen Stefani dude. Yeah. I remember we had a, a fashion show at our school and some girl sang Jewel and played the piano. And I just never, like, I don't think had a, I'd never really, no woman ever really spoken nicely to me, I don't think. Mm. And It was like, I, I just didn't even know what was going on. It was emotional. Yes. Yeah. It's emotional. And I. Just remember fucking bawling. And then somebody yelled out And I was like, holy shit, dude. Shit Dude, lemme get these tears off real Quick. Get your shit together there, dude. I was like, I'm only crying because I'm thirsty. And then I just fucking drank a bunch of it off my own face. It was like, Oh. yeah. Yeah.


That's actually, that's more manly. Yeah. Im Thirsty. No, I, and then, you know what else I saw? I saw, and then the other end of the spectrum was my buddy John took Marious saw, took me to see Bella Fleck. Mm. Jam the jam band world. String cheese, all those guys. Mm. I got to see all that stuff. So I touched a lot of bases. I wanted to, I liked, I just wanted to go to live shows. I loved live shows. Yeah. I'd go to almost any live show. Like if, if someone was like, we're gonna a live concert, this band is playing, you know, blah, blah, blah. Aragon Ball or whatever. Okay. I didn't even think twice I would go just 'cause I was like, this is an opportunity to go goof off and disappear with friends into the night.


Yeah. I, I like, I didn't, I wasn't really, I wasn't really picky now, which is crazy. I wish I, I should go to more shows. don don't go to as many shows. 'cause we work in entertainment. So It's hard. You work at nights when shows happen. It's tough. It's just hard. It's hard. I was just looking today, I was like, what shows could I go see? I saw Red Clay Strays recently. They're great if you get to see them, dude, I remember. Yeah. We got, so I think we went to see three 11 a couple times when I was in school. You know that Always Fun Bunch. They were phenomenal, man. And we went, I got, we were leaving Oh. yeah, we were leaving. I fucking drilled some dude with my car. Right. Hit his car. Oh, I thought you said hit the guy. No, thank God he was in his car when I hit him.


Get outta my car. Run up to his window. He goes, dude, I'm so sorry dude. He was so fucked up. He fucking thought he hit me. Apologize to you. Yeah. Do My bad. You're like, yes you're Bad dude. You gotta fucking, you Gotta be careful bud. Bro. These streets are small. Dude. And, I. Fucking, I went and got back in my car. And I took off. Fuck that dude was fucked up. Another time I went to Green Day. That might have been the first show ever. Saw the opening band for them. I was so high. I thought the opening band was Green Day. Sang every Green Day song to, while the opening band was up there. I think It was like Ru Rusted Root, or I don't know who it was. Right.


Sang all. And then like, I was ready to leave my buddies like, dude, they're not even on yet another time. But you already had that Green Day show. Somebody gave me some fucking, yeah, somebody gave me some fucking raccoon pills or something. And I was just fucking out there. Raccooning, you know, And I fucking couldn't, couldn't see anymore. So I could only see with my hands. Right. And so I wandered to the back and it started feeling on a cop, dude know fucking dude. He fucking, he fucking took, made me leave. And then what else happened? Good at a concert. Oh, there was one thing I was gonna tell you. Oh dude. So the other night I'm in Las Vegas and my brother came. Right. And it was fun. We had a great time.


And then afterwards there was a restaurant in the Wind called Delilah. Right. It's like a nice place. Yeah. Yeah. I've been there. It's Nice. It's like, yeah. F Scott's Fitzgerald's vibe, you know, it's pretty cool. So we sit in there and Fat Joe was in there. So he goes on stage. Joey Crack. Right. Terror Squad. Love him. And at first, like it's going pretty good. You know, some people are kind of into it, some people aren't. I'm standing up like kind of singing and cheering stuff. 'cause a friend, a friend of mine loves Fat Joe and they're close. And I wanted to be respectful. Right. And, but some people are in there being a little bit too cool. But then he is like, play another one man. And they fucking play. And then people are like, oh shit. He did that song too. And then it kept fucking stacking up. Then he, next thing you know, 'cause it was NBA summer league or something going on there.


So the place starts getting packed. He's been on stage for like 25 minutes. Then Ja Rules in there. He fucking brings Ja Rule up baby. Damn dude. So dude, so that then Acon is fucking, they were like, damn Acon, he's outta prison i's What I thought. He got deported, Dude. And he fucking pulls him up, dude. He got a work release for him for about 10 minutes. Brings him up on stage by the end dude. Fat Joe. It was unbelievable, bro. That what a, that's what a show. It was so and unexpected. No. You didn't know he was going on. No. Oh, that's wild. When that kind of stuff happens. That's unbelievable. When they're like, yeah, we'll just, I guess we'll just play a song. Yeah. And someone shows up. Someone shows. I've never, I've heard about these, these, this is like lore to me.


I've only been at shows that are, you know, supposed to happen. I've never been lucky with like, dude. And then it just turned into a concert. Yeah. Lucky Boy. Before you get outta here, you've, people see you with the Kelsey's all the time. What's their life like now? Do you know any from when you first met them? Kind of do things seem any different? They're definitely, you know, it's fame and popularity are interesting. Yeah. And kind of scary. So scary and weird. I mean, JI met Travis a while ago. Jason, and I'm new. I'm new to, no, I met him through, through Travis. And Travis is, I, I, I've said this before. And I mean it. He's, he's been the same since I met him.


If I texted him now and said, joking around about something, he would, he would joke just as we were back then, I think, you know, he's much more, he's much busier now than he is ever been because of his life and his growth and his career. And then the, the confluence of him dating the most famous woman on earth is wild. But he's a hundred percent the same cat. I mean, like, it's, it's, I I I don't think I've ever experienced it that level where he's the same guy. Same Guy as, And he's bigger than he is ever been. Yeah. But I don Dunno man. He's been, he's always kind of been that dude And, I think he wasn't gonna let this change him. don don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. I'm not smart enough to understand, but, well, That's probably a good thing for Sure.


I, I hope, I would hope so because he Was always, he has to be in that league too. It's like you, you know what I'm saying? Like Yeah. But it's, it's, it's like a different kind of stardom now. It's weird. Oh, that would be scary. And it's critical. It's crazy Critical for no reason. You know, like the fans are, they pick apart everything you wear, everything you do everything you say in that Taylor Swift world. So it's, it's, I I know. Thank you. I don't, I don't, I don't want that kind of, it's scary. We already get into criticism as comics and most of the time it's like, what do you do? We're fucking around. Like we're Jo, we're joking. But with him, yeah. We don't know. It's gotta be, it's poignancy. It's like everything has to be legitimized and talked about And I don't know how I, how he handles it, but he does it really well. I think also he doesn't give a shit. 'cause he's just enjoying life.


Do you think he's a government op? There's been a lot of people that say that. You know, He was, he has been coerced by the government many times to try to join forces. And he refuses from what I know, every time he calls me, you know, they, they offer him something to try to be a part of. You know, he's been offered to be Play for the Chargers A hundred percent. And he will not. Yeah. Absolutely not. No chance. I Mean, we're not doing that. They asked him to move to Brussels for a little while. Oh, the government. And he wouldn't do that. So he's never, he's never really gone through with it because there's no amount of money you could convince him. And he's not gonna do it. He'll stand his ground. Kelsey is not going to work for the government. He's a stand your ground guy. He's stand your ground guy. Stand your ground. He's a fight guy.


He is. Fight, fight, fight, fight. That was crazy, wasn't it? That's amazing. If I get shot, dude, I'm out. Bro. That dude, I'm crawling out. Even, Even my ear is someone as small as my ear the whole time. Yeah. I'm cry. I'm crying. My ear, my ear. I'm, I'm certainly not fight. That's a new level of bravery fight. No, I will just post fight on Twitter. I Wouldn't even post. That's what Twitter's for. Twitter's for when you get shot, then you say what you, then you post. Yeah. Yeah. I wish they would. Yeah. Try me one more time. Yeah, yeah. I'm not saying fight out loud. That's a begging for another person. Do you see that? Home run Derby winner? Let's get you outta here. Who was that guy who won it?
