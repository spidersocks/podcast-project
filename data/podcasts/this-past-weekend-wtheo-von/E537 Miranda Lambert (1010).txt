And Dallas was, Dallas was OUR like, City, Oh, Yeah, Yeah.


what was your first job over there? I worked at Bell's Oh, my first singing gig. No your first like human job. Like need job. My First, like my first big girl job. Well, I start, I worked at this little department store called Bells for like th Christmas season. They hired me to wrap presents, which I'm terrible at Oh. So th they were like, these presents are terrible. So they put me in th back room to like sort things. And I only lasted two weeks. I was like, I had just started singing. And playing. I was 17. But I needed, like, I was not making any money. Yeah I was like starving musician. And. So I tried for That, like, you know, That like holiday season, extra money. And realized quickly, like, I've got to make th music business work.


'cause this is not for me. Because that's not it. No. It was just not. I wasn't good at anything else. So I was like Yeah. If they put You in th back to a sort, that's not even Yeah. you know, I couldn't even use well, because I, someone lady asked me like, does this look good on me? And. I told her my truth. I was like, not really. They're like, that's not how it works. You kind of have to lie. I'm like, Oh, Yeah. I'm trying to think if I. Well, I used to work at a pizza parlor for a while, and we got late. There were cutbacks there or whatever. And, I don't know how there could be cutback. It's like there was four of us working there. But I guess they had like cutbacks or whatever. So a couple of us got laid off. But Yeah know I. Wonder if I ever worked at a department store.


I couldn't work around pizza. I just I. Love it too much. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. We had th pizza in Your Town. In th town. Yep. And had th salad bar. And had little corn dogs on it. And, That, I I was really happy about That. and we Put corn dogs on th salad bar. I love a salad bar. That's unprecedented. Oh. I love a salad bar. Pizza Hut used to have a great one. You. Remember when Pizza Hut, Yeah It was like Pizza Hut, but like small town brand. Pizza Inn, Oh, Yeah, pizza Inn, same thing. Did they throw th pizza in th air? Or not? No No. Nobody knows how to do That Oh. Now, you know, I've actually seen It in real time now 'cause my husband's from New York. City Yeah. So I've had like legit pizza now. Yeah, not Pizza Inn. Oh. We had a place, I'm trying to think of what it was called, And. But they had a big window there. And some dude I.


Think he was a magician. But they gave him like daytime work, throwing those pizzas in th air. 'cause I think it just fit in people's heads. Like That, that's magic. And so's hard. Oh He. He was I. Think he really got th hang of it. And. It was awesome. People would come from Miles around to watch him. you know, you'd see kids just out there just licking lollipops, just staring at 'em. Looking at this dough wizard. Small, Small town entertainment is, is pretty simple. Yeah, it's easy to, it's easy to come up with Oh. Yeah. Well, when th fair came to town, That was always exciting. We could go to th fair a day before And for 50 cents. You could, You were kind of a Guinea pig. They didn't tell You That, but It was like, come on over. And, You can do a ride for 50 cents. So We lived right down th street from th Fairgrounds.


So we'd walk down there, dude, And it. You would just get rattled. Electrocuted. Yeah. I. Don't I, don't trust small town fair rides. Yeah. I. Just I. I. Just don't And. I I. Think that's probably a wise choice for You. you Know, right? Yeah. How You seem like a thrill chaser. 'cause You got tased And You ride. th 50 cent ride. Like you're going for it. I've been in some bad relationships. Yeah Maybe. I'm a thrill chaser. you know, Yeah I. Think Yeah, If. you tack all those things up. How does a guy, this is news. So how does, 'cause your husband was just like a regular police officer, right? How does a regular police officer meet a, a celebrity comfortably do You Is That a weird thing to ask?


Kind of No, I mean honestly, like We are kind of from, from th same fabric. So It was, th th weirdest part of it all is th th language barrier at first, honestly. 'cause He is a New York accent. And, You hear mine. So it was like any of my southern phrases, any of th like, redneck stuff. I say, he's like, what? I don't understand And what you're saying. So, but We just met We, met By Chance, literally on th street. And, like And. Six years later, It worked out. But Was, was there moments where He was like, you know, this is like, because I feel like if I'm a regular guy, say if can met, you know, Julia Roberts, or trying to think of somebody else, queen Elizabeth or something. And. I'm trying to date him.


I. Would I wonder if there would be moments in my head where I'm like, what, how do I do this? Like, you know, do I put on a special cologne? Like what do, how do I? Just because there's some, Well, Brendan does wear th polo. Like th old school one. Oh He does th red bottle. Oh Yeah works That Green Bottle with th little gold tag. Th red one. You know, if I've seen That one It might be th sport. It Yeah Maybe it Did tour. Remember when sport came out, people Yeah Oh, every Did you ever wear cool water? No I didn't. But I Yes You did No some wr some of th fancier kids kind of did. Guys That had like, game with women wore It. That. That's why I was like, Did. you are You lying. Yeah Did. you wear th court. Say it. No. I didn't have game with women. Oh. I was like, I was always th guy who like would like, would help my buddy open all th Valentine's, like on Valentine's in school, they would have like th key club or whatever would come in And.


If somebody bought You a Valentine, they'd give 'em all out in th room at th same time. So my buddy would get like 11 of 'em. And, I wouldn't get any, but he'd let me like, hold a couple of 'em on my, on my desk or whatever. Make You feel good. Yeah And. It's like Hey Hold isn't It like, Wouldn't It like th one where You give everybody in th class once. So everybody feels love Oh when We were kids, well, when it got into Junior Hi, it got like, okay, somebody had to go. It got real Yeah, Yeah, And. You would get 'em, and he would just have a stack. 'em, he looked like th damn back. You're Gonna get so many Valentine's. Now. It's gonna be weird because You talk about it. That's a good point, huh? Yeah Valentine's were nice. My mom wouldn't get us like something That. She would like leave By OUR like bed or something in th morning. Like, That was pretty sweet though. But Yeah, was there ever a moment where He was just like, where it just seemed like Ner like, he's like, I'm a regular guy.


And, you're a, you're a regular person. But th there's always like a I. Think there's a fear. And, like a regular guy's head of like, how You would behave around a celebrity. I guess. I think. Does It make any sense at all? All Yeah. And It definitely is an adjustment to like, just jump into th country music world. And move to Nashville. I mean, He like, retired. you know, He was eight years on th department, and he like, sort of Chi made th choice. Yeah, Yeah Yeah. He choice together of like We. ve got be together. you know, And You got to trade your gun in for a harmonica or whatever is a Big deal. I think, well, thank God He didn't 'cause I. Don't know If you. He's He loves music. He's not necessarily musical. He did write a song on my new record. Really? He's a co-writer on a song.


On my new record. Yeah I had him writing during 2020. We were all doing anything during 2020. Oh. Just like, bang. Oh got Yeah Oh. If Cops, cops were writing songs, Yeah, Yeah, I was like, let's write songs. And. So We did, and he was pretty good. And I guess. 'cause I mean growing up in New York. City, And, like being a cop on th street in Times Square, like You have a lot of life lived. you know, And. So this record, he has a co-write on my song called Dammit, Randy. and he had some of th best lines in th song. Really? Yeah. So he Oh. Wait, I've heard That one. So like in a hurricane, That was his line. Nuh, flying a cotton in a hurricane, I was like, dang, It. That is a good line. Yeah, it's a good line. But Yeah, you know, I, think That, like all th celebrity part out of it.


I don't care about That stuff, you know? So Yeah It just made it. We're just real And, regular And. Like, like I said, both being from first responder families, like We kind of grew up. th same. There was some Glue there, just Different places. Yeah Yeah. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm just, just trying to inspire like, regular men out there to think That. They could handle it. If they met a celebrity person in That world, That, they, everything could be cool. They can And. you know what it's like, I'm such a big stickler of like, don't surround yourself with Yes people. And. So having a husband that's just a regular guy, like just being a cop in New York. City, And. Like, he come, he comes into my world, but he tells me th truth. He like, calls me on my shit. Ah, He tells me th truth.


He doesn't sugarcoat. He sees everything for what it is. And, I really appreciate That. Like, there's th fact That. He's not in my industry at all. And just really kind of, it's a straight shooter. It's like, it's such a blessing to have in my life. And. So I'm glad That I married somebody. That, just like is is That way. That is just a regular blue collar guy. That sort of comes in. And enhances my world. And speaks a lot of truth into my life. Mm. So y'all go, all y'all regular dudes. Go, go get it. We need You. Yeah. We need You. That's a great call. He also married like a country singer. And a horse girl. And. So I mean he signed up for a lot. Yeah, because Horse girls were like, we're a different breed. like I, Oh, Yeah know Yeah.


Dude. I just met I, went to a therapy place for like a week. And, they had horses out there. And. One of th therapists like, worked with th horses. She was like, th horse therapist lady, or whatever. Like, th That's amazing. Yeah And. So like, she had met there, hugging this big old horse, I. Don't think I don't know what his name was. I've Done That too. That Equine Therapy. Yeah. It's amazing. Like, it really, I thought it was crazy. But it's really neat. It teaches You so much. Like, where they're like, put your hand where You feel like, th put your hand where You feel most drawn to th horse. And. Like, immediately put my hand on its heart. Oh awesome. I didn't even know where a horse heart was. Now, That, I. Think about it. like, I was like, I. Don't know where it is in That. Huge giant chest. you know, it's pretty cool.


Oh, I had to take th horse. I was trying to take his pulse. And I had to do with both of my hands. Like, That, like Yeah. Horses are crazy. And It just got like 60 inches a neck on them. But Yeah, it was kind of wild. 'cause at first she's like, okay, approach th horse And. Let It know you're okay. And. So th I'm like, four feet from this horse. I. Think his name was Knuckles, or like Mitten or something. And. And. I'm like, Hey horse. I'm just letting you know I'm here. Like, It was almost like meeting an alien. 'cause I'd just never even been around a horse. Like in That, much like proximity, like just being a horse in a pen. And. But By, th end. I got to take th horse for a walk. And stuff. And. I felt like it was cool, because at first, I was super nervous. And as it went along, it kind of like Yeah, I, kind of like my idol came down.


Yeah, you know, And, It, And, It, That. They're so therapeutic, just being around them in general. But like, they're just majestic creatures. And, I heard just I. Think they can hear your heartbeat from like five miles away or something. Oh, my God, pervert. Isn't That crazy? Yeah? That's crazy, dude. I mean, that's eavesdropping. That's, You know, but they could sense everything. It's like they tell You th truth about You. Before You even know your own truth, you're like, ah, I didn't grow up around horses. I didn't start until I was 30. And I just wanted to do something. That scared me a little And. I always wanted to be That cowgirl. like I. I used to play all th rodeos back in th day. And like singing. th national anthem, And, small town rodeos. I love Rodeo. I was first getting started. And all those like flag girls in th barrel racers with all th glitter And Fringe.


I wanted to be That so bad. And I chose country music. And. So I was like, at 30. I was like, I'm gonna be a cowgirl. Dammit, I'm gonna do this. And. So I started riding for th first time at 30 And. Now I'm really super into It. I. Love it. I. But I was I mean. I'm still like, I'm green I, don't know what I'm doing. But I just love, like having a hobby completely outside of what I do.

Th lord's Uber Bro. You, get on a horse. It is not, it's like kind of up to, to You. That's a pony. Because they give You these little strings.

I've only done That once, one other time with my record revolution a long time ago. So it was fun to like actually learn every song And.


like I didn't really know 'em That well, I had lyrics up there. I had a little notebook, like old school. I was like, it's my first time to play these. you know what I mean? But I. Think I Don't know. There's one on there called Armadillo. It's th first song on th record. And. My friend Aaron Ray, tier I, don't know If. you know him. He's a Nashville songwriter. And.

You got to tour with Toby Keith before I did Yeah. Yep. what was He like? What's Toby Keith like? That Was one of my earliest tours. I was lucky enough. like I went on so many, well, there wasn't hardly any women Tour tour back th like, really? Well, like in country. There wasn't That many touring That. Much I mean in th early days. You got play like a hundred, 200 shows a year. you know? So I went out with all men for a long time. And I learned so much from all of them. Like Keith Eman was my first one. 2005 And. th 'cause I just played honky tonks until th And, th Drk. Bentley And. George Toby I think was like my fourth big black major country tour.


Yeah And. I learned a lot. I mean Oh. Gosh, old school. Look at That hair. That is like Linda Texas hair. Oh, my gosh. Wow Yeah little old school. Tease it to Jesus. That's what We say. Oh th Lord does my hair while I sleep. Exactly. So Don, even Yeah Wow. That's cool. what was Toby like? Like, what was He like? I just never got to meet him. I've gotten to meet some different artists. That I'm a big fan of, but what was he like as a person? He was really, He was like, He was himself. you know what I mean? Like, he was his, like, authentically himself, kind of did everything his own way. An outlaw in his own way.


Prolific songwriter, And. you know, he was, He was kind of a tough love at first out on th road. But I, guess I needed That. 'cause I was a baby. And didn't know, you know, what was going on yet. I was learning all th ropes of everything And. It was, it was I learned so much from every tour. I was on And. I would say Toby was just like, like his fans taught me a lot too, because they were really about Toby only, like You had to work to get them to care, you know, because they were like, we're here to see Toby And. He's his like, outlaw kind of I Am who I Am mentality. They kind of adopted That. And. I felt like it made me work for It in a good way.


like I had to really figure out my set list. And figure out like, they're, I'm just some little gal. They're not here to see me And, if they're here early. I really need to, I'm here to gain fans. ve got work on this. Ve got capture. That, Yeah Did. you get to interact with him before He passed away. I haven't, I did see him at th BM I Awards when he got th songwriter Legend Award a couple years ago. So it was right before he passed away. Yeah And. Could You tell He was sick? th I just 'cause it was. I knew people. That knew he was sick for a long time. He just didn't like put much out there about it. It seemed like, like, seemed like he was very private. But I. Guess who would want to, right? Yeah. Well, And I was I mean. When he was there. He sounded great and he looked great.


So I mean, you know, That That journey is like, everybody's got to take That journey. And, however they feel comfortable, And their family. And, all That stuff. But, you know, That, he was it, even at th end, like really about th music, you know, Yeah, because th Las, big thing I saw about was th BMIs And. It was all about his catalog. And I did not realize how many, he wrote like 150 songs a year or something. Like crazy Oh, my gosh. Like just prolific And. I also didn't realize how many outside songs he cut, like, or That He had other artists cut of his, huh? Until That ceremony. Is there ever a song where You write it? And You think it's good, but it's not. For You is That A lot. Yeah.


Oh really, A lot of times. Yeah, And, You. you know, it's, I'm thankful. That. Some artists are still willing to cut outside songs. I. I'm one of those artists, You know, what does That mean? That. They're willing to cut outside songs. Like, like You can't write every, You can't cut every song. You ever write, you know, And. So, for instance, Aaron sent me Armadillo. And I was like, I, love this. I'm cutting It. So, you know, I think it's important if you're a songwriter to have a balance of We live in Nashville. Like, there's amazing songs written all day every day in this town for years. And I. Think it's cool when artists are not trying to write every song on their records.


Oh. I. See what you're saying? Because at a certain point, it, it almost, you're just able to help out more people. By, picking up songs. That, they've written really Yeah, And. you know, like for my career, I mean my biggest songs. I wouldn't have if I would've tried to write everything. I mean, like, house That Built Me is a, a staple in my career. And, that's I didn't write. That. And. Mom's Broken Heart. And, Little, Red, Wagon. like I have some of th staples Drunk. Some of th staples in my set. That are my career. Staple songs are not songs. I wrote. So I think it's good to keep th door open to like, you know, look around town. Look where We live. This is amazing, right? Yeah so many people, Yeah, And, You can't do things alone, too.


That's one thing. I realized, like, kind of like, as I get older, it's like I used to wanna do everything. By myself. It was just like how I was wired. And and I still is a lot of times. But it's certainly, it started to alleviate some where it's like, I got I need help. I need people to do And. I need people to help me do things. And And How can help people do things. And. th it's more fun to do something with somebody. Sometimes. Yeah And. It's like when You celebrate th highs with your friends. 'cause You all did it together. Yeah, like a co-write, you know, it's fun. Like, collaborating is great. Nashville's such a good community for That. Like everybody's I mean. you know, you live here like everybody's So, country music community is very collaborative, and we lift each other up.


We kind of stick together. you know, You don't have to do You. Think that's true. I do think it's true for me, it has been for 20 years. And, not That. You have to love every single person You ever work with or in th business. But Oh, Yeah, I feel like everybody's kind of in It for th same reason. And, there's a mutual respect there. Most times, Yeah know, Yeah, Yeah, I, guess. But it's also competitive, right? Yeah. But I think that's also good. You got like, compete, but I think there's a difference in a, a, my manager, we've been together 21 years. And I just recently went on a birthday trip with her. And, one of her really good friends who's born And, raised in Belmead. Her name's Elizabeth And. She said, there's a difference in wanting to win. And, wanting to beat everybody.


And. I thought That was really poignant. I was like, That, That, It. Because that's a different mindset. Like, it's okay to wanna win And, And, like compete. And be on top. But I don't, I don't think You have to wanna go into it going, I'm gonna beat everybody, right? I'm just gonna win at my race. Yeah. 'cause it's almost, it's almost Vin. It's not Vin, but it's almost Yeah. I'm trying to think of th word. It really almost adds a negative edge to it. It does And. I don't feel Like, because I want somebody to lose. th right? Right. We can all win. We just got run OUR own race. Yeah interesting. Yeah, thanks for thinking about That kind of stuff with me. Yeah. 'cause I love songwriting. And, esp, Oh In Nashville, anything can happen. You.


Like, you'll drop a tomato at Trader Joe's. And, somebody will come up. And have half a stanza written about it. know, you know, it's like, you know, it's s great Yeah You. Get in a car accident. And th guy gets out of th vehicle. And. He's already written a couple bars about th accident. and he iss like, what do You think of these And? I'm like, what do You think about giving me your insurance papers? you know? Well, That's th title. Insurance papers, Yeah. That's, but it really is. That's how What's in your glove box? That's a good song. Title Yeah, dude. Yeah. What's in your glove box? Dude, it better just be gloves buddy. Yeah. If there's G gloves. That's weird. Yeah. Why is it called a glove box? Because People Now, That We talked about it. It's even weirder if there's gloves in there. It is weirder. Now, isn't It Yeah And? It started off By. It's only supposed to be your insurance.


'cause people used to put, th name is drive from th compartment's. Original purpose, storing driving gloves. Initially, th glove compartment was a boxer. th driver on th floorboard driving gloves are worn to keep hands clean. And considered essential equipment. And, early vehicles Driving gloves are important for women now too, because OUR hands, they like keep You from aging. 'cause your hands are on th wheel. And like I didn't know That, but like, driving gloves are a thing. But why does That keep You from aging? Because Th sun on coming through th windshield. You wear like gloves while You drive. So That, th Sun's not like getting on your hands, honey, You're only driving a Smyrna. That. Ain't a lot of sunshine on them. I don't know. But I ride in gloves now because of That. You, my horse. I have my little gloves. I'm like, I, don't want sun damage.


Oh, I thought you'd ride like I. Ride a shotgun in a car like I. Ride I. Ride my horse with gloves on now. 'cause I'm like, Oh. God, I don't want aging hands. There's so much to think about. It's a full time job. Oh, Yeah, You don't want aging hands though, No, Because You can hide everything else. But You can't just show up to something with Mittens on for No. Reason. No. But Dolly does wear those sheer gloves with th rhinestones. And. I'm kind of like really into That. So that's a vibe. Somebody said she's full body tatted up I That Too. But whoever really knows th answer, I don't know. A couple men have to know A couple for sure. I mean I. Don't know how many I mean, you know, is she still married or not? Somebody Yeah Carl. Somebody knows And. We're gonna have to get to th bottom of this. Somebody know. Does only know have th tattoos or not. Somebody tell us, Somebody's seen That artwork, brother.


It ain't me. you know, I ain't know peeping time I. Hope she does. That would even make her, if if's possible for her to be more badass. Yeah, That makes it more badass. Oh. If she, if they, if she came out with like, in one of those E, SPN, where they do like, th nude, like they're pushing a baby carriage, like, but they're naked or whatever. If she came out And, she was full body tatted. Dude, it would be crazy. Like Kat Von D, just totally, that'd be insane. Yeah Tats are awesome. Yeah, You have 'em Yeah. I got tats. I'm not like sleeved or anything. 'cause I don't know about th top like at th top of your arm, like as You age. Like, does it get weird? I? Don't know. I don't know. So I just have 'em down here where they can't like swing.


At some point in my laptop, I have on my forearms. I don't want like Mama tattoo arm. like, I don't need That. You. Get a chair. And. th years later, it's a swing set. Yeah. You're like, Oh. That's a damn porch swing right there. Exactly. got be strategic. Is there an artist? That passed away. That, like You really missed their music. You missed them. Is That a weird question? There's a bunch. Like one You knew Maybe. Even Haggard Haggard, like He was such a, like my number one hero. And I was really sad. th day he died. And, like, It I. Guess it was like th first kind of Oh.


My God, one of my heroes is gone. you know, feelings. I was lucky enough to get to sing with him. And meet him. And know his family. And. So That was awesome. In fact, I just saw his family this past summer. th play, th state Fair. And Ben Haggard. And. th family opened. But I, just I. Don't know. That was Merl Iss my like, th number one. you know, Yeah, what You admire about him. You think so much. I. Think That. you know, he, one of my favorite quotes is from Johnny Cash. and he said, I sing about th things. That Merle Haggard actually lived because He literally turned 21 in prison. Like He told his truth. Like he didn't have a glamorous childhood or upbringing.


and he took his outlaw And, sort of th troubled times of his li his life turned him into songs. And turned it into a beautiful career. And, every time I was ever around him. He's one of those heroes. That, like, is exactly what You hope. He would be like, a little mysterious, but super kind. you know, And know. It's always like, meet your heroes or not. It's scary. 'cause what if they're, what if they let You down Yeah, but he never did. Hmm. Like, all these pictures they're bringing can like, tease it to Jesus. I mean, look at th hair. That is Texas hair, y'all. That's definitely a full crop. I mean they got a lot of rain. That, summer. I'll say That. great. That is for sure.


That's s great. What's a song That, You put on? Like, say like, everybody has songs when they wanna feel something, right? So like, You have, like, man, I really wanna feel something right now. Like, or I Don't know. I do. I'm kind of an emo kind of dude. So I'll put on like, like I used to put on, like Trace Adkins. Every light in th house is you. you know what I'm m talking about? Yes is That Trace Atkins. You gonna say Tre Atkins. Yeah Yeah, Oh I told You. That That Yeah. You Want Yeah. You want th big deep voice. Yeah Yeah, like You wanna feel it? I don't know. Oh I went through a breakup. Yeah And. I would sit on my porch. And just smoke cigarettes. I, don't even S. I don't even smoke You. Well, everybody smokes when they break up Yeah, dude, it's th kind part of it.


I would just smoke And. I'd play That on repeat till my neighbors were like, what? th turn off th light or whatever. We can't handle it anymore. I think nobody in his right mind By, George Strait I haven't even heard it. It's So good. It's one of my favorite George Strait songs. But it's just like a heartbreaker. We're like I. Don't know. I love country like I, truly like my go-to is country, old country is like my jam. And, George Strait We. Call him th king for a reason. So it's a great song. Nobody in his right mind would, nobody In his right mind would've left her. Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind. Mm Mm Come on, God put my fucking feelings in a wheelbarrow.


No, We need to go to That horse therapy place immediately. Yeah, what else should I? Listen? Oh Lee Bryce's I Drive your truck. That one's a Heartbreaker. Oh man. My friend Jesse Alexander wrote That song. Really? Yes. She did And. She's amazing. She wrote it. I Don't know who she wrote it with, but you know, she wrote it. That's A great song. She Yeah Oh. It's so good. And Lee's Lee's delivery is like insane. See, it's, but that's a song That, he didn't write. Right? Right. And, that's why it takes a Group. It's like what? You. Also, if he doesn't perform it, if somebody else does, who knows If It works, th same It could. It All has to land in th right basket, right? Like th right song finds th right artist at th right time. Yeah, you know, Yeah The, House That. Built Me too.


I had I saw some That talk. th th Writers of That song. It took 'em, like they wrote That song for like seven years. Alan Chamblin And, Tom Douglas Yes it. They rewrote It And rewrote It. It's seven years A writing It. But can That is such a lesson, like, I'm not good at That at all. like, I Amm, like, I'm kind of millennial about my, like, you know, I wanna come into this co-write Today And. th I'm gonna leave with a song like in, you know, four Hours. You, get a song, or Two Hours, or whatever. It is I I. Don't know. That I could have stuck with it for seven years. Yeah, it's a lesson to all of us to like, be patient till it's right. Oh. Because That song is like perfectly written. Yeah Yeah, they made like a real Sistine Chapel with That one dude, I, remember, it's kind of weird, Maybe, but like I grew up in like a pretty traumatic youth.


you know, And And, I heard That song. This is a couple years ago, Maybe. Two years ago. It was like Christmas time. I was in my town where I grew up. And I went, And, got it. Like an orchid or whatever, from a flower place. And I took it back to th place. That I grew up at And. I went, this sounds really bizarre. Now, I wasn't doing Peep And time or anything. It was like I I knocked on th door. And I gave him That. I was like, I. Think that's really Cool. Yeah I said something nice should grow here. That's what I said. Wow And. I gave him That. That's a song.


You said, That to th songwriter. So It was interesting. We'll Have to write it down. But honestly, And what? Th But it's funny, That, what a song can do to somebody. you know, Yes, because That I didn't write That song, but I was like, how did they know my story? Like, Yeah. But my guitar player, That, was with me for forever, since I was 17, and we lost him two years ago. But He said, I, That is, That song hits me because it's what I wish I had. Yeah, And, That sounds like what you're talking about. Like And, I never thought about it from That perspective. Oh, he wished he'd had those things at his Home. Like he would've had th house That built him, Right? But He didn't have like a healthy childhood Yeah. So, you know, but I I just I love a song like That And. th fact, That, they waited it out.


And just stayed with it is like goals. ve got work on it. Yeah, ve got work on It. Yeah That is Yeah Yeah. Who knows? Like, what things And. That's what's th thing. th one thing that's nice about life, it's like You don't know th little things you're doing now. How they'll merge with like, th things you're doing later on. And. th how it'll help You form, like wherever you're supposed to be. Like, sometimes it's so hard to get through just th moment, you know? But You don't realize, That th moments are th stairs. That are gonna get You to th place you're supposed to stand, you know, Yeah. Anyway, sorry, but Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I. Don't know. Those people must have thought I was bats shit. Crazy, dude. You know? But it's not like th house I grew up in, was an old tobacco farm.


And. It was The, House. Built in 19 Oh, five. And. It was just a farmhouse, No, central heat, And air, one bathroom. Like, not like, like a farmhouse. Like We didn't have a lot growing up, but people constantly stopped By there, specifically older people, seniors. and we were like, you know, I, they would cry. They would just be standing on th front porch crying. And. I was like 10, like hiding behind my mom going, like, trying to ea drop And. Like, what are they saying? you know, That, they had so many memories there, And, they, those, those hand prints were th that's why I thought, when I heard th song, I was like, have they been eavesdropping on my whole life? Like, Wow? Because It was such an old farmhouse. It had so many stories in It, And, Yeah, And. It touched so many people's lives.


you know, Oh, Yeah, Yeah, I. Think that's one thing that's amazing about art, is That. It can do That. I mean I. Think You could. It's just powerful. you know, Yeah, That, th th beats And, th words. And, You put It all together. th right way. And. It unlocks something. know, It does know And. It's like everybody feels like, okay, I am not alone in this world. And. This is this. Whatever's happening to me, good, bad, or ugly. I'm not th only one Yeah. That's th beauty of a song or any art, really, truly, but especially songs. I, love can, I can. I'm in awe of songs. I am a songwriter. I'm a song lover. I'm a music lover. Like, especially country ones. 'cause We, just tell th tell th sad truths. No matter what? Like, You, get in your feels.


you know? Oh Yeah. So, What do You listen to when you're lack wanting to like rage or like rock out or I mean? I'll put 'em before. Well, I mean before I. Go on stage. I. Listen to Fgl L Dirt. It's a little uptempo for me, but it's also kind of, kind of chill. Yeah And, like down home And grounding Yeah And. Th I'll put on a little bit of Booy badass And. Listen to him. So I'll turn it th other way. you know, I might even go some sexy red or something. Like, That I. Don't go anything too crazy. I mean sometimes I'll put on Maybe, like Sound Garden, or like, I've been listening to Steven Wilson Jr. Recently. I'm obsessed with That record. God, it's so good. Golly. It's s great I actually have a rat coming up with him.


And can. So You do. Yeah. We. Oh. My god, what whatcha You gonna wear? We wrote This song, you know, We, it's, it's like hard, not I wrote with him. And, Natalie, him be recently. and we wrote this song called, well, th hook is I. Don't wanna see th movie if th dog dies. Like all of us sitting there crying. It was just like, th most magical, right? And It was Steven's idea, obviously shows up with That, Yeah, And. My dogs were there. And, they're seniors. And. I was like, Oh God, And. They're scared. They're like, Hey. Let's don't finish th song No. He's So great, great I, love him, but also love it said sound guard. 'cause mine is audio slave. Like, that's my Really Yeah girl. what do You wear while You listen to it? People are like, What do You, what people would be surprised to know about You? I'm like, huge audio slave fan. Yeah, I. Just like No in my hair.


I, just get all ragey, Yeah Yeah. Female. more rage is a thing, you know, it's like my bread. And butter Oh. Look. Yeah, No, I definitely noticed. That. Some of it's in, you know, you know, And, Yeah. I've been victim of It for sure, dude. I've got a couple angry women in my texts. In my d in my dang And, You. Ding dang. dms, And My ding. Dang. dms. Yeah, but Yeah, it is, it's just interesting. can, a song will get You activated to get You ready for like a certain moment or something? Did. you ever have to play at a funeral or anything? Did. you ever get asked to do something like That, Oh? God I can't, like, I'm not good at it at all. I, just I. Get too emotional. Did. you ever have to, or not. Yeah, I had to sing at my grandma's. And. I had to sing at a friend. That was like my age.


That was th worst one. Oh. God, is it? th first one You ever Went to. It's a car accident. It was th first, like, like reality check, like teen years, Hi School friend. you know what I mean? And. Her family asked me to sing And. I did. But it was, it was just one of th hardest things I've ever done. I. I, really? you know, you know, so I d I. But you know, when you're given a gift, like, what are You gonna say? I'm not gonna use it. Yeah, to celebrate someone. That was amazing. You have to do it. Yeah, get on up there. Miranda Yeah. Whew, Lord, my good God. Yeah man. Oh. One time, I was at a funeral. And, some th person That sang.


It was a girl, And. She was so nervous. She started singing th Star Spangled Banner On accident. Yeah Oh, man. Well, You shouldn't seen That. Somebody had to go And, grab And, kind of grab it. She was Just like, hardly anyone should sing That hardly. Let's just talk about it. It's time. About, about, But not, especially if Kenny's right there in th casket. And. She's just like, Ooh. People were like, We can't even be here right Now. Honestly. Like, there's like four people on earth. That should sing That song. And. That's it. And. She made It to like, th and people waited, And. Some people started going like this. I was like, No, No, Yeah. 'cause part of it is just You. I just feel so uncomfortable right now. I'm gonna go down th spiral stairs. And leave forever right now, Because those only go up Just thinking about it. Oh, And, Yeah, they Only go up.


A lot of us were like, what? I thought. what happened? He wasn't even in th service. No, th whole thing got really confusing, man. Did they? I've been to some weird funerals.

But you know, I guess that's what happens when You send a senior citizen to th It wasn't Rite Aid back th it was called KMB was th store. They had That had 'em, a couple of costumes over there, but God, it was Yeah. That was too much, but Yeah. Anyway, funerals are a lot Yes. They Are so sorry. I brought That up.

Now she's pregnant. I watched all th things.


But like, she's seems to be thriving. So Yeah I mean she's had a crazy childhood. th Whole thing was Crazy. I can, that's what I'm just saying. I can't even imagine how crazy it was. Like if something like That would 'cause You have these moments in your life. You're being supportive of somebody. They're dealing with a, a disease, a syndrome. And. th But It was real to her. I mean Oh. Totally. So She was a child, you know, Yeah. She was a baby child. But Did tour, th suddenly it'd be like a national thing. And, you're like, what is going on? Yeah I can't believe I was part of That, but I'm, you know, You don't know what th time Did tour know And. Neither did she. Did, you know. So Yeah It was just like, you know, her I mean her mom worked th system. And It worked. 'cause We have all met her.


Like th whole country music community, like ask any of us Oh. So she was was part of It. She was in it. Yep. She was Hobnobbing Oh. That's interesting. Yeah. A lot Of us. That gets kind of crazy too sometimes, you know? But if that's what th child loves or something. But she did. And Gypsy was very genuine. Yeah. Really, truly. That's just such a cr I heard That I was like, this can be true. It's just so crazy. Yeah Yeah did. Has she have You reached out? Have You guys? Has she reached out to You since No? I Mean That was so long ago. She might just put all That behind her, which I would if I were her. you know, I don't know th whole thing. I don't know. Some of y'all songs are so good. I don't know how You could put it all behind You. Well, we'll see if she comes to a show There.


You. Go, dude. Yeah. That's just a crazy thing. That I heard. So I was like, is this th truth or not? It's th truth. It's on Google. It's got be true Yeah. Well, now, you know, chat. GPT is kind of getting better. th Google, because there's not advertising on It Oh Yeah. My brother's like super smart, like really a techie And. He's telling me all about this stuff. When We first said it, I was like, who's Chad? He kept talking about Chad And. I was like, who's Chad And? th he asked it to write a song at Father's Day. We had Father's Day in New York with my husband's family. We're sitting around, you know, with like forced family fun. You have to like, think things to do. Yeah And. So my brother's like, I'm gonna ask Chad to write a Miranda Lambert song. And I was like, okay, And. It did And it Did tour.


Have a melody, but It just th lyrics. And. It was called Whisky And. Wildflowers And. It was kind of good. I was like, Oh God, Oh God, my career's over. It's happening. Do I get a royalty? Will it go on tour? Tell me all th answers Chad. GBT. There it's dude, Chad. That's definitely th there, it's th redneck version of Chad. GBT is Chad. G Bt That's what I thought. He I was like, who's Chad? and he was like, Yeah. I'm saying chat And. I was like, Oh And. It's like, how do You get to New York? City You put in there. And. It's like how much gas money You got. you know what I'm saying? you know, like It has a different voice. Like it has like a He, like a hick voice. Yeah. That would be funny. That'd be great. Having Chad. GPT That would be so good. Hey. Chad, how do I fix this two stroke motor?


Bub? That'd be so good, dude. We have, somebody has to come up with That Yeah whiskey, And waffle, sitting on th porch, sun sinking low memories of You like a river flow. Your laugh still lingers in th evening air, but loves a wild ride. And. Why Is it talk about drinking when it's my song? And? I'm look holding on. Th they're judgey. Chad's judgy And. th th pre chorus got a bottle in my hand. And a heartful of scars. Okay, That sounds like Trace Atkins Las. Well, it also sounds like you're a pirate. So that's th crazy part Of It. It's so stressful. But this is also like Chad. GBT is a newborn. You have to think in a few years if it starts to really get like th ability to do some stuff.


But I don't know if it'll ever take over. Like, th human ability to feel And stuff. And actually create music that's based on real feelings. I, don't Think it could do it. No. And.

You're right. Things have changed. What's a place That You miss in Nashville that's not here anymore. I kind of miss old losers. Like old losers was like I love losers still. But like Midtown. It was like just one little shitty dive bar with like darts in th back. And smoke And like a good, great jukebox, And popcorn, you know?


Mm. And. Now it's like three stories. And th rooftop And. All th things. But it's still great. But I kind of miss, like, th little, like th th dive. Or th better, you know, Yeah Yeah.

I can deal with Yeah, not cul-de-sac. Yeah Cul I. Remember when somebody put a damn cul-de-sac? First time I ever saw one. I was like, what is this shit? what do You mean? You can't keep going. Just fucking hurt my feelings. Boy. I said, we'll see about That. I'm gonna call th damn Sheriff. We'll see about this. I can't Find a picture. I have it on my phone. What else was I thinking about? Oh? If. you had If, you had to travel back in time, right? If, you had a time. Warper And. It could have a Hemi on it or whatever. I don't know how You like to travel, but If, you had a time.


Warper. what time back in your life would You go to do You? Think Right now? I. Think I'd just stay right now. I feel like I've done done it, but I'm still learning. Somebody asked me th th day, like, what's your most fun era? And I was like, right now. can like I still young, but like, not dumb. you know, I mean Yeah. you know, That That whole vibe where You learn a lot. Early thirties were weird. Late thirties were fine. But like now, I'm like, what's what we're doing right now? You're like, We're here. We're here. Everybody's just is like, forties is th best decade. I'm like, let's roll Yeah. We'll see. Yeah.


I. Believe it. Yeah Here. We. Go Yeah. Tell me something else. That You. Think about Oh. You're th one th new song is Damnit Randy on your new album. Who's It about, man? Well, it's about Randy Yeah. Oh I. See, It's about Randy. Everybody has a Randy in their life. Okay, And. Everybody has one. And. It's about just a time where I was like, this is not good. It's not serving me anymore. This is ve got move on. And. And. It. Was It a real, like, was it Sears, or was It just somebody That didn't install y'alls cable Well, or something like it, you know. Well, it, It depends on th person. Everybody's got a Randy Can met Randy, right? And I wrote it with John Randall, who's one of my besties.


And. His real name is Randy. So I always say That to him. Anyway, so it's kind of funny. And, that's th one. That. Brendan's a writer on Oh. Yeah. I was flying a kite in th middle of a hurricane. There it Is. That little songwriter. What else was I thinking about? what drives You at this point in, in your career? you know, this is kind of a general question, but like, you've gotten to have notoriety. You've had number ones. You've won Grammys, you've won You are a household name. You. Have You can afford to pay your rent. you know, it's like, what, what goals are there still for You? Or do things evolve from goals into like, just wanting to still do need job?


can? I'm just curious. And, it's stuff I go through in my own life too, with comedy. you know, I'm just sim I'm just curious. what do You think about That? You know, I am lucky enough to have reached a lot of th goals. That I set. When I started this journey, I mean I was 17 when I was, can chasing music. That's what I'm doing. Yeah And. People are like, fuck, You. You'll be at a Dairy Queen in two months. You know, Yeah know. I was like, okay, see y'all next Time. Like, I'll be singing in th drive through. Damn know. Exactly. Yeah, I. Don't know I, I. Feel like now I'm just like, open. I'm trying to be open to, you know, I don't, I'm not walking around saying, I'm gonna do this, And this, And this. I'm just like absorbing what's around me. And being open to new opportunities. And meeting new people.


And like, also s saying No to th saying No to th right? Things like I think that's a big part of it, because You can save your energy for th right things. If. you just say No to th things That are not right for You. Like, that's kind of where I'm headed. And, where I've been living in th past couple years. 'cause I realize, like, If, you put all your energy into th wrong people. And th wrong things. th You don't have any openness or any time or energy left for th right things. And. th it's too late, you know? So I think I'm just in this space right now where I'm like, what's next? what I mean? This is new. I've just started doing podcasts. Like I've never done That before until this year.


And, you've Done a good job. I've watched some of them. I. It's fun. Well, can, I'm new to it. And. I'm not great at talking like I'm, I'm a singer. Like I'm in front of people. I'm actually an introverted extrovert. I'm an extroverted job with an introvert personality And. So I'm trying to, I'm branching in That way. you know, I always, I'm fine to say my truths in songs. It's just harder to do. Just, you know, saying it out there. But I think it's important either way. So I don't know. My goals are like, what's next? Let's do something. That scares us. Let's do something that's, you know, makes You grow. And makes You learn. Yeah. Yeah. That's true, huh? Yeah. Sometimes. It's so We. It's so I.


I feel like it when you're involved in some part of th arts, kind of, you know, people call 'em And. Some people just call 'em music, And comedy And painting or whatever. But it's weird to also kind of evolve. 'cause it's like You age, right? We age, And And. You're like, well, if I I some songs, I can't even really sing anymore. Some jokes. I can't even really, I could tell 'em still. But is it really gonna be true to where I'm at? you know, you know, I find That that's interesting about art itself is You have to And. th you're, but th you're like, but if I change, will I still have th people who like this thing, You know, Yeah. It's like, how do You keep th common thread? And, keep reinventing. It's a tiny little fine line.


You have to walk. Yeah, And. It's scary because what We do is very public And. Like what We signed up for And. what We started saying, or th jokes, We told at 20, or th songs We wrote at 20 are not th same. We're not in th like, th same life space. And. We're not in th same lane anymore, you know? So it's like figuring out how to, how to do That gracefully, but still keep That common thread of lack. Where, where you've been And, where you're going, but kind of walk this line of staying authentic. Yeah to th to th true You. That started this whole journey. And comedy is th hardest thing in th world. like I did not I. Think That would be th literal hardest part of th arts of any art. I really do really Yeah I just respect it.


'cause it's th most vulnerable, like, standing up there in front of people, And just telling jokes. And hoping they re like That. It lands, you know, And. There's No band. There's, it's just You, Yeah, Oh. God, that's scary. God. I. Wish somebody would pull up with a drum sometimes, Just like You start playing a drum solo immediately. If, you're like, No, this one didn't happen. Take it away, Henry. you know, You, just turn it over. Yeah You. Don't have anybody to like, lean on your up there. By yourself, like emotionally naked. Like, it's Scary. Oh in th beginning, it's so scary. I. Think God. I can't even believe something. When You think back. And I don't mean it. Like, I'm not trying to fill my ego, but, but when You think back, like I. Don't know if I'd go do it now, but Yeah, You, get up there.


That, first time And, you're just like, this is gonna, this is gonna be good. you know, You don't even believe yourself. You're just screaming That to yourself in a car like Yeah, you know, in a Ford torch. You're like, that's just got Be like in your best. Chris Cornell voice. Yeah. know, beefing yourself. I. Don't I. Don't th fact That You said It You. Don't know if you'd do it now. like I. Think about I. I knew like three. It Makes me nervous. You know, I just got anxiety. I. Think about like, I knew three chords. And I was like walking in these bars. Like, can I play at th set change? like I just ve got, get some experience. And. you know, it's That thing of like, how do I get experience If? you don't let me play Yeah. And. th but, but, but th You say I can't play. 'cause I don't have any experience. Like, just put me on set.


Change th And. I'll play my three songs. That I just learned yesterday, like, not good, but just being brave. Anyway, I don't know. We did it. That's a good point. Yeah And know th ones That Hurt, too. Do You have a show? You? Remember, That really just kind of burned You when You are just like, God, this is hard. Oh Yeah, Like A birthday or anything, like You. Ever get, play one of those Arab birthdays or something. You're like, th Th private parties. what? I'm so thankful for. Private parties. I love them. I would love to play your private party, but some of them can be hard. Yeah. you know where it's like I did I played a I, played a sweet 16 one time. And. This thing was th most extravagant party I've ever seen in my life. And. It was a bunch of 16 year olds.


And th only wanted me to do four songs. Michelle Branch was part of it. Lean Rhimes And me, and we each did four songs. Wow. And. Like, this thing was like legit. It was in Washington, DC And. These kids were dressed to th nines they all had on like, everything. Designer. And. I was like, I was working at Bells when I turned 16. Oh, I, I, Rob those bastards, We were dressed to th threes, honey. Three. Okay, I'll tell You. That, exactly. We was th three of us combined. We was a nine. I mean, That was a, That was one. That sticks out, right? Mind. I'm like, Ooh, Lord. This is, this is Bougie. Oh, Yeah, We. Remember, I had hand-me-Downs from damn women. And. I was like, We, don't I don't have an older sister. I was wearing shit. I was like, whose shit is this?


Just, just, you Know, stuff. That, whatever was around my mom. My mom was like a big, big thrifter. So big Thrifter. I'm like, I found. But this is awesome. So, like, it was in th Zocdoc Martin, like, heyday. and we couldn't afford those. Those was very, like, those Were very nice. They Were very nice. God, And. So that's where Mother Hubbard lived in one of those I Heard they were fancy. We went to Goodwill a lot. And, like I found a pair of Zocdoc Martens for $7. And. They were like, new And, I went to school. And. My mom's like, just tell everybody. You got 'em at gws. And say it's like a nice store in Dallas. So I Forever was like, these are my dog.

That's th rest of th threes. Oh. That's like putting damn each foot into a day. Sheraton. That's really nice. Sheridan's have very good beds. You know what I do? Notice as after touring And going to hotels, And stuff. I. Get one thing. That bur bugs me. It now is if th mattress is too soft, Yeah And, I don't mean It in a negative way, but it's like your back starts to fall apart. And, You. Start to realize how many bones You have in your body. You get older. And, you're like, th We can That. This is not a, this isn't holding anybody up. You. Figure out like, what? Like, but is your continental like breakfast, like just fruit loops?


Or is It like hot breakfast, Oh, No? Like, it's those things. You start to like really appreciate on th road. Like, do y'all have real eggs? Or are they powdered eggs? 'cause You can't say hot breakfast if it's powdered eggs. That just doesn't count. That's fair. Doesn't count. Yeah. That's more res, like, it's like MREs, but with a television that's on E. SPN, you know, Yeah, like, they'll have That set up. Yep. Yeah God, I, I. Think Yes I. Remember, We used to go to th continental breakfast? And. We would pretend like th pe people That were waiters or whatever. We weren't even supposed to be there. We weren't staying there at th Holiday Inn. and we would go up there, And eat up there. And. My stepdad would take us up there. But you're not staying there, huh? You, And. We'd go in That bitch. And dying, honey. you know what can saying And, when they have happy hour, And, it's in a box, but I'll take it.


Yeah. It's fine. Box wine sounds great. Let's do it. Do You have a favorite party? Like birthday Party? That You ever had so far? you know, You just turned, turned 40. You said it was I. Think it was this one. Was it Yeah? I Re I. Y'all Go back to th casino. No. We went to Billy Bob's on a Monday. Billy Bob's like th biggest Oh in th in Texas In Fort Worth. Texas Yeah in th Stockyards. My friend Gwen, she's sings with me in my band for 13 years. And. She was like, where do You, because I was like, I don't know what to do. There's so much pressure on That Birthday, Yeah. You know, like th big th zero ones, you're like, like, don't I just would rather do nothing like I. Shut down And. She was We. Were getting OUR hair done, And. She was like, it was typical getting your hair done in th foils. So she's like, where do You want to turn?


40? And? I was like, she was like, I, feel like You. Wanna turn 40 at home in Texas? Go back to th root full circle. And. I was like, I. Do I. Think And. So Billy Bob's gave me th bar on a Monday, 'cause they're closed. and we had Barbecue And, A bunch of my Texas friends, Randy Rogers, And, Wade Bowen, Adam Hood played And. It was just a big old honky tonk night. And. It was like, It felt like, man, this is like why I loved why I started this in th first place. like I just, I've been playing Billy Bob's for so long. And going there to see shows. And. So I, think That was my favorite birthday so far. That's perfect. Well, that's th most recent one. you know?

Don't Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow night. Yeah. Oh Lucky tomorrow night. Yep. For singing for th Doggies. Oh for your Pups. Music for nut music for mutts. Yeah. It's a benefit for Mutt Nation. Music for Mutts. And. How, what qualifies a mu? Actually, Just us probably I don't know. like I, I have just rescue animals. And, like they're just all just mixed little Puffers. And I started a foundation in 2009 called Mu Nation Foundation with my mom. With your mom. Yep.


That's her. And And. We've raised over $10 million since th $10 million. $10 million. Wow Yeah We. Raise awareness for adoption, for spay neuter, for Adopt. Don't Shop And. Like right now with th Hurricane Helene, we're doing a lot of work with Tractor Supply, rescue Relief, And with Greater Good to, you know, people are first, obviously, but there's tons of shelters down there. That, were already overcrowded. And got hit. And. So just, it's, it's, there's a lot of moving parts. So really what OUR Foundation does is kind of meet th need. Whatever th need is, you know, whether it's lifting up shelters, giving them grants for renovations, natural disasters, We kind of run th gamut. But OUR main focus is to encourage people to adopt And once someone creates something like this, this foundation, right?


Yeah. So this is a nonprofit organization. How do You raise funds for it? Obviously, You can do fundraiser shows. You can put your own money into It. And. th how does, I'm just curious. How does a nonprofit even, well, I, guess those are th ways You put money into it. Or You do fundraisers. Yeah, We've done fundraisers. I I Sing for th Pups. I Mean We. Haven't done a music one. But like for my Vegas residency, We gave a dollar a ticket. And I was there for two years. So a dollar a ticket. We've done That on tour, where a dollar a ticket goes to Mut Nation.

Kind of back To th roots. Yeah. I. I wanted to go to Austin. And. Just like, really? It's really honky tonk record. I mean, it sounds like my childhood. It sounds like th music. I grew up on And. I think it's just because I have a new chapter, a new label. I a new decade ahead of me, of like, whatever's gonna happen. And I wanted to like go back to th root of where th whole passion started to begin with, which was like playing those honky tonks in Texas, like I.


Think I had That sort of awakening. When I had my birthday at Billy Bob's And. I was like, I'm turning 48, 1 of my favorite places on earth, in my home state at a honky tonk listening to country music. And. That's just where my heart lives at th end of th day is a honky tonk listening to country music Yeah. So it felt right to like, make my own music That way this time. you know, Yeah, it's hard for your heart to kind of get back home when your life gets busy. Like That in a way. you know, it is And. I. Have a I, have a Austin in Austin. I spent a lot of time in Austin. And, I Love Austin. Me too. My little brother lives there. And, And, I I. Just I. Don't know. I. I. I spent. I. I always say I am a t TN Theo T State girl. 'cause my heart's half in Tennessee, half in Texas, And. But both places, That I Live are revolve around music.


And, I, love, That, Yeah. It's like sometimes your life gets so busy, And. th you're like, you're like, it stops at a certain point. There's a special day or a moment. You're like, Oh.

Yeah, you know, And, it's, it's like a, it's kind of a weird spot to be, but th once You embrace it, which is where I feel like I'm right now, just embracing, like, look, what, what And what I've done so far.


But like, what else can We do? you know, Yeah I still feel really inspired. And excited I mean I'm I. Definitely don't have th same energy for like long, you know, 150 Dates a year on th road or anything. But I'm still so inspired to like, write songs. And, you know, I love th music. I can't. It's, it's my life. I dedicated my whole life to It. Yeah. It is funny. You kind of Yeah You do. When You get busy, And, your career gets busy. You, a lot of You gets dedicated to what it is. It's like I spend most of my time, like I. There's I. Have some close friends. I don't even get to talk to That much.
