Yeah, Thanks for letting us hang around this long, you know, appreciate It.


Been Around how long, Several semesters. Yeah. Does it feel, did it ever feel, did it feel like, 'cause you guys got part Did, you Did, you guys get paired together? Or how did it kind of the beginning become, we're not gonna go through all the history. Yeah, but I just want, you know, just so some people may not know. Classic story, you know, right out of the movies, just friend of ours who we both had a lot of respect for Tim Dubois great songwriter himself and whatever is actually an accountant at Vanderbilt as well, you know, smart guy too. But he just invited us to lunch and thought we might, might be a good pair up. And, you know, Ronnie and I were just kind of growling across the table at each other.


It didn't make any sense to us. And he said, look, you guys can both write songs. and he goes, you know, just go see If. you can write a song together. Okay. So I think that was Tuesday, maybe Thursday we wrote Brand New Man Friday. We wrote this song, next Broken Heart. And Ronnie had Hardy written Neon Moon and Boot Scootin Boogie. And I had another song of Austin found, and we just screwed up and been riding a bus for 30 years trying to figure out how to get off it. It's like we weren't, we weren't brothers growing up, like people, you know Yeah. Challenge to, Did it feel like a pressure, like you had to be like, like I just want, yeah. Like, 'cause with comedians they don't really have that where you come, they kind of partner you up, I guess, for television shows and stuff they do.


Where they package shows. Yeah. But yeah. I wonder, did it feel Did, you guys feel a pressure like, we have to, or it was just No, No. We felt, we felt broke and hungry. Yeah. So what's some motivation? We, you gotta back up a little bit though. We felt like none of this shit's really working that great. you know, I mean, I'd had some, some success as a songwriter, written a couple of hits and whatever, and Ronnie just been out in Okie, you know, hiding writing great songs. Totally unheard of for somebody who hadn't been in Nashville really studying the craft, so to say, to show up with songs like Neon Moon and Boot Scootin.


Oh Yeah. Next album. Hardworking Man. And used to be my Ronnie just had written all these great songs by itself, which, you know, now, I can't even tell you who's out there writing songs by themselves. They'll probably watch and go, Hey, how about me, dude? But, you know, it's, it's a co-writing town. It just really is. It's becoming more and more of a co-writing town. I, I last time, More and more writers on every song I saw one with Nine riders. Nine rider. What the heck. We used to like, we'd throw a bet him if it was like, you know, three riders in the room. Yeah, Yeah. Did it feel like over, did it feel like you guys had to, 'cause I bet it's like it, once you get partnered with somebody, it's like, Hey, we're part, this is a long ride and you don't really know how long the ride is when you start, you know?


Did it feel like you guys, over the years, like you had to be best friends? Did it ever feel like a pressure to be like that? Maybe, but we didn't, I don't think we, we took it to heart. I mean, it, it was like, Hey, we, you know, Tim back up on your story a little bit. Yeah. For me. But Tim, Tim had heard me in a, playing a bar in, in Oklahoma and he was circling through and Clive Davis and he were putting a label together. So he told me, he says, I, he says, I really, I wanna sign you. He said, I've already got Alan Jackson and Diamond Rio. He already had a boy singer And a band And a girls Pam Tillers. And it's like, it's like, like he's going down the list. and we didn't realize this at first, but he was going down the list going, okay, now I need a i a trio.


I've got a trio I need now I need a duo. Yeah. But he didn't, we didn't know that until after the fact, you know, the Judge were breaking up. So I, that, that he saw, he saw an open slot on the CMAs, I think. Yeah. It might have been true. Yeah. No, it Was, I think it was that manipulative. Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah. I saw you guys do your walkout with Morgan. How was that? Man? That was cool. He's got it stirred up and it's like, okay, so where do we Stir? So where, How about that kid That was, did you know about it before what it was? Or? No, I really didn't. They were trying to explain to me what was going on and like, we're gonna look back and you guys come down the hallway and then y'all are gonna walk out together to his stage, you know, we're gonna film it and it's a big deal.


I'm like, okay. And we keep up with it to an extent that we know how he's selling out stadiums everywhere and it's like, you know, get outta the way. Yeah. and he iss crashing websites and Live Nation is, you know, they If you announce ticket sales, it all, you know, it blows up through the roof. So. And I had, I had did a, a walk on with him at Bridgestone when he played here a couple years Ago. Oh yeah, I saw that show actually. Really? I was at that show. Yep. Yeah. That was awesome. Yeah. But yeah, to do that, it's kind of an interesting thing 'cause you're back there, you don't really know what's going on. you know, you can't, you can kind of start to hear people cheering, but you don't really know. So Did, you do that with him? Yeah. Yeah. I got to do one with them here in in Nashville? Yeah. With Deandre Hopkins at plays for the Tennessee Titans.


Yeah, sure. But it's still kind of confusing 'cause you're like J Hop Yeah, Dhop. Oh, that's what I meant. Oh, What did I call him? Deandre? No, but we didn't, when I did it, we didn't, he wasn't doing the walk yet, so, and we, we were in Kansas City the other night with him. Is that right? Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, we were in Kansas City with Kansas City. Kansas City. Yeah. Kansas City. Yeah. That's where you guys did the walkout with him, right? Yeah. Yeah. 'cause it's kinda wild. Yeah. It's just this thing how I guess they kind of just started it. Yeah. You don't know. Yeah, you're right. You, you're just kind of thrown into the fray there and You know what's going on. Yeah. You're kind of, dunno what's going on. You Feel, well, am I supposed to walk here and be cool? Am I supposed to like, you know, rub your shoulders or Right. And they Go and it's start to get weird.


People are rubbing on him and people are Yeah. Right. It's getting, it's starting to get a little aggressive, I realize. Right. And the only thing you know, is it like they, what Are you doing? Stop doing that. Me. And they tell us, they said, no, he's gonna walk fast. Okay. You're gonna walk fast. Yeah. That's it. Then off you go. It'll Be cool when he just starts wrestling. Yeah. you know, Turns around deck. Yeah. It's him and his agent just back there fist fighting. Oh, I think, yeah. It's definitely bizarre because you like, you don't really know what's going on. And then he's like, all right, let's go. And for him it's just, he's just getting to, you know, heading to work. Yeah. Bouncing off the walls. Yeah. Yeah. It had to be weird 'cause you get to the stage and then you guys can't go out to the stage.


So it's like, Yeah. It's like, yeah, we're on. It's like, stop. Yeah, no, no, this is not your show. Stop hearing the cameras all fall off that guy. Yeah. It really was like that man. I, 'cause I didn't even play anything, but I was like, I could try, you know? I was like, let's do it. Right. you know, That's how we were. He just used his wing it go. Oh yeah. And Deandre's like, he looked like he was ready to just run a 40 yard F flat, you know? So I was like, yeah, let's get him out here, dude. Yeah. So that was interesting man. What's it, what's, what's been one of the tougher things that, that came with like fame that you guys realized? 'cause you guys went to being, obviously you were doing well in your careers individually, but even as you were just saying, like, you know, you guys, the first couple songs you put out were hits.


That's right. First four were number ones. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a lot of number ones. Dude. you know, we Just called some buddies up in a panic and, and started playing honky talks and bars. Or even our manager told us not to do it. I said, no man, if, if we're running off like we're knocking hits outta the park right now, we need to have a tight band. you know, when they do. Or we get a place where we're in front of a lot of people. So we, we went for the first year, year and a half playing clubs Everywhere was from here to California. Which was the coolest. It was animal class. The coolest men memory. The coolest memory for me because probably like Ronnie, I mean, just a lot of years of turning corners on clubs and stuff and there'd be four or six cars in the parking lot.


Oh yeah. you know, and you just have to go and set up And one's yours too. Exactly. you know, And one of 'em is a girl you came to invited to Impress. Exactly. And a couple of guys that don't like it 'cause they want her too. And she's not. And she's not cute. Yeah. You set your stuff up, you know, and nobody cares and whatever. And then next thing you know, we're we're parking down the road and to get to a place. 'cause the parking lot's full now those were great nights. They really were, you know, you really, you really couldn't screw up too bad 'cause it was fired up. And that's kind of what you dream about when you're learning. Tune your guitar. you know, just man, just, just the club's part of it.


I mean the whole coliseum thing. And that, that other kind of success was, I wasn't even thinking that far. This was just like, man, it worked. Yeah. It was so crazy. 'cause we don't know each other from Adam. Even at that point. We don't know each other from Adam. and We, we would learn in interviews about that one Another about each other. Yeah. Like I didn't know you did That. Now as you started to get famous, I'm just curious about this kind of stuff, you know, 'cause fame and popularity is such like a, it's a interesting thing. Right. And it's its own thing. 'cause you can't exactly plan for it. Like, were there things that you kind of missed kind of immediately about that? Like, 'cause once you kind of, once it starts to happen, it's hard to put it, you can't really put your life back into that old jug.


Really? No. And you don't see it coming. You can't plan for it no matter where, where it is. I think, you know, even If, you grew up around it, which I didn't, but I can remember. This is so strange. Still I can remember going home after the first like say run the real like tour when we were opening for Reba or whatever. And my wife and, and and mother-in-law going, she said, you've changed. I'm like, what? She goes, you've changed. She said, you're not the same. And it's like, I didn't feel like anything was any abnormal other than I was going out on a bus and singing in front of people. I didn't come back going, you know, Hey, I'm famous. Yeah, yeah. Just but people's perception of you changes, you know, don't you think?


Yeah. And that yeah, it is. And it, yeah. And it's kind of uncomfortable 'cause you don't, you kind of wish it wouldn't. Well you need that safety net of, of, of normalcy, you know, come back to, especially at home. And it was just kind of all of a sudden you're getting pushed, pushed in the corner in a way by that whatever perception is of fame. I just did a bunch of acid. So we're good. We're we're heavy with this, so, Oh, I'm not even here. No, It's just coming, it's coming outta the cosmic space right now. Mushroom, not acid acids out. I think that it is funny. I'm just, my wheels are turning just thinking about those times. And, and honestly I love, somebody made a statement one time, we're having a conversation like this and said, yeah, I wanna be a star.


I wanna be a star. I wanna be a star. Will you people please leave me alone. you know, I've never felt that way. I like that. you know, I mean, like Ronnie, for so many years, we, I was 36, he was 38 when we met, you know, with nothing going on. Really. And I mean that's, that's a, that's pretty old to just get started with a career where you're put together by a record company and to think you're gonna have a 30 year plus run or something, you know, it's just, oh, we Didn't think about the 30 plus year run. I know. That's what I mean. Our philosophy was, Hey, you got three, three to five years. Alright, let's maximize it. Let's take what little money we make. And I was gonna go our, our big Janine, my wife and I just, just got married in Oklahoma.


So our goal was, you know what, interest rates are like 10%. And this was ba back. So see how far back it was. Interest rates are 10%. We make a million dollars. We can live off a hundred thousand dollars a year and live like kings. you know that we drove up to the first house, bought this little house in Nashville and we got, we're just here for a little while. Save your money. Yeah. you Know, honestly, I, I don't know If you remember this, Ronnie, but we were, we were sitting in the Nashville airport just shooting the bull. And we've always just, I guess had kind of a natural, just a couple of guys who were smart asses just, you know, just goof balling all the time. Talking to people just like, like we are today.


And, and anyway, these two girls came over and they, I saw three of 'em over there talking and they came over and asked if they could get autographed and they had a CD and whatever and you know, and we just shot the bull back and forth a little bit and whatever. And I mean, they were sweet and whatever. We signed their CDs and I've always been happy to do that. Glad anybody cares, you know? Oh yeah. And man, a couple minutes later their friend comes over and said, our friends told us what you said we're, we're getting rid of all our CDs. We've always thought y'all were so great. And what I mean, just teed up on us and we're looking at each other and going, I'm trying to remember this conversation, what I could have possibly said that.


And I, I mean, I like to think of myself as a good guy, nice guy, and have always respected our fans and everything else. I'm like, what just happened? But it made me realize that moment, that that minute that we spent together totally wrapped somebody's impression of you And what kind of human you are. Oh yeah. And, and how they'll tell everybody they meet for the rest of their lives. That they're just jerks. you know? And you just, that's the part Did you Ever find out what she, what you said? I have no idea what we said. You were involved. Don't you sound you must have Involved. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. What Did you say I wasn't there. I Wasn't there.


Don't pull, don't suck me down that rabbit hole. It does feel like you get on this one, like this one minute game show to prove to somebody that you're okay or something. I don't know. Yeah. That stuff, it's like, it's Like a job interview. You gotta be quick. Yeah. And you yeah. And you, and the job is, you want them to think you're okay or something. you know? You're the guy for the job in one minute. Yeah, yeah. Right. You can do it. I can't, Yeah, that kind of stuff gets a little tricky. Was it tough? Like what about like having a family and stuff and touring so much? Like what were things that like Yeah. What what's that? Like, like, dude, is it hectic? Dude, I had just been married. I mean, we just got married, came up and, and June Carter Cash gave us a little cabin on top of the hill up next, not far from their house to live in.


Wow. And so she, nice little house, like something out of a magazine and, but it was on top of a mountain by itself. And so was she. Boom, we get, we get a hit right out of the, the gate we're gone. And it wasn't too long. It like I mean. We didn't have, we had like cell phones, but we didn't thank God have cameras. But I started getting these terrorist faxes. I called them like she would fax the hotel. 'cause I, I talk longer and we'd talk so long on the phone. They'd go, okay, alright, alright, alright. I'll be home, you know, in two weeks. I know, I understand.


like, I get it. I love you. Bye. you know, ring, because I'm not, I'm not answering the phone. That ain't gonna happen. So no, not 10 minutes later I get this knock on the door and it's like they slide this stack of faxes underneath. So she started faxing me. It's like, what the hell? And this goes on for, I don't know, a few months. and we, we sorted it out. But to this day, I mean, then she's been, It was not, I Had to go therapy over it. Oh, I'm Sure. With her. Without her, With her at her, at her request. Obviously, you know, because I'm broken. She's not. Anyway, that's long thing, you know, There's, cha had one of those that, 'cause we had a, a cell phone per se on tour, but it was like something that the army would use, you know, it had a suitcase thing that it was in and all that, you know.


Oh yeah. The second You press the button, a helicopter would come by. You know, 18 bucks a minute long way from 18 bucks a it's, it's important. It Wasn't cheap, man. It wasn't, yeah, but it wasn't with our wives or anything. We were a little, no, We didn't give our wives a number. It is important. Was it strictly a beer phone pizza? You're like, we need airdrop now. Right? Oh,

It was good 'cause we were still playing a lot of faires and stuff back then and you know, during, it was kinda like summer vacation. Honestly. It wasn't. I didn't, I never, nevermind we got, fortunately we did have some success and made a little money and we were able to get our own buses pretty early is the reason we're still sitting here having this conversation. Amen. There were 13 of us on one bus Yeah. For a year. and we started a year with the merchandise and, you know, boxes of t-shirts and stuff like that. And then one of our guitar players slept in the back with, with the merchandise. Oh yeah. There's always that. It was Animal House. It was, I got human gerbil. He's back there just burrowing in a bunch of extra larges back There.


It was, it was absolute animal house Man. He just completely just covered himself with nine mediums back there, you know. And it was, it was got him Bird Burton who, who was the famous guitar player that for the Amazing Rhythm, maces a bunch of rock stuff. And you know, he'd come up there, bless his heart. We, we trying to, you know, really trying to keep him around. But, so, hey, you have the sofa in the back with the merchandises, you know, he goes, we don't have any blankets. So you sleep under t-shirts. Right. Anyway, it was, look, it was Animal house. It was like animal house. Yeah. We Had one guy that's like all, you know, all the bunks, like there's what, nine or six to a to a side I think. Yeah. And then the, the back lounge. And there's one guy that we called him what?


Fred Sanford, you know, he was the junk man and he, you couldn't stop at a truck stop and he wouldn't go in like by a fricking cd it Sounded like a Yes. A CB radio and a bunch of chip Did. you hear him at four in the morning, like Turn over and be like a Ace hardware in his, in his bon and like I was cranking around, You hear chip bags crinkling at night and stuff. And like, what? And all of a sudden there's a, there's the, the, the wall and then the bunks. And you'd see like the chip bag would like fall down through the next guy. He's like, God dang man. It was, it was crazy stuff. Truck stops are great though. Oh Man. So much fun. So Good stuff in there. Especially when you cross the border early on. Faith Hill was opening up for us and, and Oh Wow. Huh.


Yeah. And I forget. Oh, and, and Wade Old boys love that. And y'all struck out with her, I guess. Damn. Huh? We got stranded in Canada and in a, a a, a snow storm. Yeah. Yeah. Lot of Stuff. God couldn't have set the table any better from one of You guys. It was, it was rough. Yeah. So in the first truck stop, I go in and I'm looking at all their cool stuff and the freezer in Canada and I pull, it was a eel, it was a frozen eel in the freezer. And I'm like, wow. So I bought it. I mean, I have no idea what I'm gonna do with this, but I couldn't resist. But, but That was a phase when everybody started interrupt. But that was a phase when, when everybody was playing pranks on the road. Oh yeah. Faith and Faith was like, she was one of the guys.


I mean, you'd have to keep up with that. She would, she would throw Stuff and an eel could come in handy curve balls at in all kinds of regards. And Who'd even had an eel? I don't even, some people don't even Canadians. Yeah. Yeah. I think that was the points why you bought it. It's like, look at this, what the hell? So sure. It's Kind of a little bit of a nicer snake. It's the most Canadian thing, you know? Yeah. And, but we get to the end of the tour and sure enough, I walked by, we're fixing to go to the, you know, stage Faith. Faith is on next. And Wade Hazy just gotten off stage. I went by to tell him, you know, good show and whatever. and he iss kind of leaned over. He is looking pretty peaking. And I'm like, Did you okay? He's like, no man. It's like, Faith, put salt. Am I drinking water on stage tonight? I go, oh. and he Was made him six I stomach. Yeah. Made him six.


I'm like, that's wrong though. I got you, dude. So she was in your back, bro. She's in a, she's in a hotel, but we had the codes to her room and her fictitious name. Whatever she was using at the time. Yeah. So me and and Doug make a run. Well first I put the eel in the, in the microwave and the eel didn't even have a head. Oh. I mean, and then once you've thawed him out, he got real slimy, you know. Oh. So we head Over there. Heartbreaking childhood. It must have had, Dude, you know it. And You bring your own food, pull back, Pull back the covers and just laid him out Right where those pretty little feats were gonna go, you know? Oh Lord. Kind of pushed it down. So we put the covers back, just made it look really good anyway.


And the next didn't hear a thing. She didn't say anything. We just keep waiting for the other shoe to fall. Nothing. So we're going through customs, getting back into the States the next day, you know. And I go through and, you know, lady's going, she goes, Mr. Brooks, I go, yes. She goes, I need you to come over here to the side. I go, yeah. She goes, apparently there's been a complaint filed against you about some stolen jewelry by Ms. Faith Hill. And she starts pulling this rubber glove on. And I go, Don't do That. Don't do that. It ain't in there. No. You better not be kidding her. Swear door To God.


She could, she couldn't hold it. No. She finally broke. I go, come on. It's not our first day. Leave me alone. You're not even in this game. You did sing a little higher that night. The world was fun then too, when things were a little bit more simple, you know? Oh yeah. you know, In a lot of ways. Yeah. That was a lot of fun, man. And you couldn't capture the moment as much, so you had to enjoy the moment because that was the only, you know what I'm saying? Well, You got too much downtime. I mean, it was, it was not, you know, if you're not on stage doing something creative, you're doing something destructively creative on the backside. Oh Yeah. you know, You know you've been out there. Oh, it's the dark arts out there brother. It is Did.


you guys ever have a, a comedian that opened up for you guys? I know sometimes they used to do that on shows. Gary Mule Deer. Oh really? Yeah. Still a good friend. Love Gary. Yeah, we did. Did what? Vegas Vegas a couple times. Yeah. Played it with him. It's hysterical. I dunno how many times. But he was out with us quite a bit. That's a tough gig, I feel like. Well he, but he played guitar as well. Well, you know, Gary's like, he, he does play guitar and it's, you know, it's incredible. 'cause he just did a, we did a show together out in California not too long ago. and he played, 'cause he always, he's, he's got a Johnny Cash voice and he'll do a ring of fire or something like that every now and then.


He's, he's hysterical though. Just real, real straight face joke teller and can just break it down. I gotta tap in with him. I've heard of him before. I've seen a lot of, like, 'cause committees, you go to the next club and the other person's just been there, you know, and I've seen a lot of his, you know, seen his name a ton over the years, but I've never gotten Around forever. But he, he actually performed a song and it was, I bet this thing had 20 verses and it was, it was, it was, I'm not kidding. It was like, but it was a real country music analog kinda take you through this whole journey of thing. It was really neat. Big time stand and o because I've seen him perform, I don't even know how many times at this point.


And, and everybody there was like, wow, you got that off your chest? and he did not tell a single joke. Really? He sang that. He sang that one song and left the stage. So was so cool. But it was a humorous song. No, it Wasn't funny. It was, it was a real song. And, and it was, it was Neat. But he was a comedian. He is a comedian. He's A great comedian. Yeah. But Maybe that's his ideal comedy. Him And Roger Miller, you know, him and Roger Miller toured together. Wow. And you've heard of people doing these Roger iss, these funny things that he told all the, he knows all of them. I mean, If, you ever run into him? Get him going on Roger. 'cause he's, he's one of the great historians, the, the keepers of the Roger Iss too. Great guy.


Funny comedian. Yeah. I need to run into him. Yeah. What do you feel like, like, like being a duo, was there, were there other duos that, like in music that reached out to you guys over the years to help learn how to navigate that? Like that template kind of, does that make any sense to you? Yeah, it does make sense. But, but no, no. you know, as, as friendly as they say that, that, you know, the world of country music is, it's, it's so darn competitive. you know, everybody hates one another. They act like they don't on tv. But You think people are really competitive though. Oh, heck yeah. Yeah. No big time. Competitive. I, one of my favorite things is Dolly Parton in an interview, years and years ago, she's, they were talking about somebody and being the com she goes, oh honey, we, there's room for everybody.


No, there's not. Yeah. You wanna get down to it. No, there's not. you Know, what's the most competitive part? Is it people trying to get the best songs? Is it like, where does the competition really come in? Do you feel like I, because that's interesting. I think just by nature to be, to be here and be in this game, in your game or anything that, that there's a, there's a competitive, don't you feel there's a, there's a competitive dynamic that, that runs through it, Especially in the beginning. For sure. Yeah. But you wanna catch up. Like, how many number ones do you have? Who had her number one this week? Who has that? you know? Oh yeah. and we can be cool and like set back and go, you know, we, we don't care. you know, it's no big deal. We're not in it for that. We rent it for the love, you know, and that's not the case, You know?


Well, and, But that's also healthy. That's what keeps you going. It, we do make some real friends along the way. We have, I Mean, you do. Yeah. There are people that you, you're competi. I mean, David Lee Murphy's a great example. you know, who is, he said you wrote with him yesterday, you know, the song Dust on the Bottle. I'd be a little, that David Lee Murphy, him singing, him writing, turned into writing a lot of great songs to Yeah. and we got here, both got here in 79. Literally sw Floors for Charlie Daniels for 30 bucks a night was, you know, getting rent paid and playing writer's nights and stuff. And, and still he's on tour with us now.


And, you know, going out with us next year. We toured with again last year and we've toured together before. Just there's, we've got real friends that, the, the competition, I can't say, I don't know, Maybe, it does go away or something. And at some point in your life, I think you have a certain amount of success. You still wanna succeed, but it's like, you're not so ferocious. Yeah. Like when you start and everything matters. And it's not that everything doesn't matter anymore, but it's like everything kind of turned down the heat a little bit. you know, let's simmer here and see if we can't do something real, something good. Now we kind of know you con you build confidence too.


Again, like I said, Ronnie and I, we didn't figure we'd go a year or two. That's why we were desperate through, pretty much through our whole career was just kinda, this isn't gonna work. This we, you know, are always doubting ourselves. Yeah. you know, always trying to do anything we could what, you know, to do something really special because it's probably gonna be our last song, you know, our last video. I mean, we've always kind of felt a little desperate, I think. Does it feel like it's out of your control sometimes as a musician? Because a lot of it is what songs you get, right? And you can write your own songs, you can write them with other people. But does it ever feel like it's out of your control, kind of like, look, you know how well you keep doing?


Or does it feel like it's in your control? You know what? This it is it, I mean, 60, 60, 70%. I don't know how much you can add to the dynamic. I can add up to a hundred percent Of luck. Right? No, I'll go there. That, I mean, I guess, I don't know. We could try to do more. I can't even, you know, how we luck? Luck. I'm honorous luck, you know? But, but it, it's that thing if you know, if, if you're, you're working at, at it and, and, and luck strikes. It's like you're ready for it. you know? Yeah. You got your ball, medal and bang, catch it. And we're work from there. But, you know, but we, we work hard at it. We're, I mean, we're, we're songwriters before we're Performs. Right. That's a good, that's a great point. you know, you know, all weren up there just, Hey, somebody sell me a hit. You're like, I have the ability to make my own hit.


It's All about the song. It's all about the song. And then as you move through the business, you meet people, you meet people with that are, they're pitching you, giving you good songs too. you know, and you can't, can't write 'em all, you know. And timing Has a lot to do with it too. Yeah, it really does. What do you mean by that? That's luck too. Yeah, Certainly. That is, it's all, Yeah. Luck is just, yeah. Timing is just luck with a clock, huh? There you go. That's great. Write that down. We Both, I mean we both had some kind of solo record deals before we had to do a deal. Ronnie was singing his ass off before I met him. Why? At 38 years old? Why wasn't he a star already? Right. you know, I don't know. Bring it up, Paige. I'm just saying it's 38 years old or Afraid of that.


You only looked 30. I wish I was. Yeah. Is it tough to age gracefully? Is it tough to be like, 'cause even I notice it, you know, in my own career, it's like, you know, you start to do good and you're like, oh, well I'm getting older. And then you're like, you start to see the younger guys that are doing well and you're like, oh, well this is all gonna, is there a graceful way for this to end? Or does it just end or like I? I think you just play that one by ear, you know? And, and I, I keep telling people I'm in die in denial, you know, related to age. It is like, I'm, I'm not gonna know how old I am. Yeah. I don't wanna know. It pisses me off to see every, every article, you know, that somebody, they writing stuff and you go, well, and so and so, you know, 80 years old, whatever.


Leave age outta this. I think three Willie's out there rocking. He's cool. Oh yeah. Right. Go to Willie. you know, he, he'd be the standard bearer for that. But no, I mean, McCartney, they're still out. They're still out doing their thing. Yeah. I was actually saw him in a bath a couple of months ago. Was that we were in the same bathroom at the same time. Wow. What Did you Do? Huh? What'd You do? Just the number one Did. you try to shake his hand or anything? Oh no, I didn't do anything like that. Huh? I freeze. I just let it be. Dude, you That was a little, well, you, you Said something to him. I think I, I honestly, I probably said like, good day or something like that. like I always think I was probably trying to welcome him in like a British tone or something.


Good day. Good day mate. Right? Yeah. I freeze time. I get around somebody. You Don't call him Famous. I'm, they don't, you're to Ireland. Good Mike. They're like prisoners from England or something. Good Grief. He must have been like this Guy. I'm never cool around. Somebody famous. I wish I could be Uhuh. Yeah. Were there guys like that coming up that you guys met? What question had I just asked? Lemme make sure I stay on topic. Sorry. Were You ever in the bathroom with Paul McCarthy? Tell us about the time you and McCarthy were in the bathroom. Oh, one time I went to a, I, one time I was also in the bathroom with, I'll go through 'em all.

Incoming, you know, you make the wrong move there. Anything could go, go Happen. Right. Either way. Yeah, either way it was be trouble. Just wanna Try and shake hands just to see what they're going do though. No, no. Hey man, it's just, I've Always, you know, just especially If, you reach over the stall top. Johnny Cash said that. Ask the, the strangest thing like that that ever happened to him. and he said that he was in a, in a stall in the airport or something. He said this, this paper slips under the wall.


I was like, We're good. Don't touch it. Yeah. I don't have a pencil. Like, Hey, that paper likes men. That's all I say. We're good. So you guys got to meet Johnny Cash? Yeah. No way. Yeah. What was he like, like just as a regular guy? Was he like a friendly guy? Was he kind of like a stoic guy? Stoic, quiet by nature when you first meet him. Just, and, and that's that in, in and of itself, it's intimidating. Oh yeah. And then as you get to know him, he's a 17-year-old kid. you know, that that was it. I mean, he'd do just crazy, you know, funny as all get out. Yeah. Yeah. My wife, her first husband in rented that car one piece at a time and Johnny thing about it, one piece at a time.


He knew it anyway. Or built That car. He Built the car. Oh. Built that car one Sure the time. I'm sorry. Yeah. The song, He built the car. So he Or Johnny really built a car, sorry, I'm confused. Wrote A song. No, her, her ex-wife built the car about the song that Johnny sang. Got it. One piece Song. He liked a song, and him and his bud said, man, let's, let's build it. Let's actually build It. They're always going around there. They owned coal strip coal mines in Oklahoma. and he Johnny did? Or his Friends? No, no. Janine, my wife's. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So she was, they were well acquainted. They, they, they all became fast friends, traveled the world together. I mean, really, really tight. And so when, when I was brought in, her husband passed away.


And when I was brought in, it's like she's, she's marrying or, or dating a musician, you know? And Janine goes, I'm, I'm gonna take you to John in June's house in Nashville. The first time that she did it from Oklahoma. And I went, no, I don't really wanna do that. you know, I just kinda saw that one coming, you know, and John, and you know, of course John's real quiet. And. what? Did you wear her over there? Did. you get dressed up or what? You know, black. All black. No, I mean, wear jeans. What do I have on now? This kind of stuff. And Were you nervous or not you remember? Yeah. Yeah. I was always, I was super shy and quiet and then I'm gonna kind of come outta my shell a little bit these days, but he was obviously glad to see her.


I mean, I'm the new kid on the block, you know, you don't just cru like Yeah. Who's just a long drink of water Taking your girlfriend. Yeah. Your girlfriend bringing you to over to meet her parents Who's just pervert or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I mean, I don't know you, but Yeah. I mean, I'm a pervert, so I'm sure most of us All No, that goes with it. You can't be in a band, not be a pervert. Anyway, dude. And Johnny knew that he'd being a pervert himself. Oh yeah. Who isn't man. Right? Dude, if he show me 70 people, I'll show you. 70 pervert. Right? You've been, you a comedian. Yeah. Yeah. You're a pervert. Wow. That's pretty fascinating though. And Did, you, did people look up to him as like a, like, kind of like, was he this, was he as, 'cause now he's almost, he, there's an idolatry about him in a way.


you know, you see the T-shirts with the Johnny Cash and just his cash on, like No, he's, but he's always been that way. He's always been that, been that forever. Listen, here's a funny thing. So the log cabin that they, they let had us live in, so June did that for Janine, not for me. you know, called her and said, look, okay, this guy's gonna try to make it in the music business, you know, good luck. It ain't gonna happen, but we'll give you a place to live. Okay? Right. We'll give you a flammable home. Right, right. Temporary residence. Okay. Because it's not gonna last long until I find you a guy with money. All right? So thank God we had these hits right off the bat. And suddenly June goes, woo. Okay, you're in. you know, she, she told Janine during that first visit, she said, look, here's, here's how it goes down.


She says it the ch the odds are a million to one, no, 10 billion to one. you know, they, they'll make it. And, and if if he does it, it's not gonna last long. It's just, that's not, that's the nature of the business. And number three, they're all crazy if they do make it for a long time. Yeah. you know, so she, she called her babies. It was Waylon, Jens, Willie Nelson, Hank Junior, Larry Gatlin, I mean, just the wild boys of that, that era and John. Oh yeah, the Ferreal. Yeah. So she goes, you know, just, just look, you know, the uninsurable they put us through hell, right?


Yeah. She says, so get ready. you know, she said, there's no, there's no good to it. There's no, no. So anyway, where was I with Johnny? You said, was he stoic and stuff? First day there, June takes Janine and they leave the house to go shopping. Oh. So it's just you and him And me and John. Oh. In that house alone. Okay. John In the, the bathroom and stand for at least a minute to get ready to and plan some. Yes, sir. And like, I'm the unwelcome guest, or at least I'm feeling that way. Oh, For sure. You are. And and they're, they're John's quiet anyway. He does. He hasn't. He hasn't. Like, And what's he just polishing a gun or something?


No, no. Probably. Yes. Pretty close to it. He comes outta the far end of the house. There are two black leather recliners in front of this tv. And he sits down and he is watching like CNN or whatever, and I sit in the next one just sitting there and no one says anything. I'm like, fuck. Longest time of my life. I, I didn't know what to say to him because he didn't, he didn't talk. But now I know, know what I know, he didn't talk to anybody. Right. And, and all of a sudden outta the blue, he goes, you see these, you see these, these news reels here, these these things. He says, that's a loop. and he said, you know, I'm an addict.


And I went, okay. and he goes, I used to sit and watch TV for days until those loops would end. And then he said it would start a whole other cycle of the news. and he is explaining, you know, how TV works to me and that stuff, and through the eyes of being high. Yeah. you know, you know. And shortly after that, it seemed like two days that we were sitting there, it was probably a couple hours. And Janine and June come back. Thank you. And they've been shopping at Steinmart. And I like Steinmart, actually, sos the Sleaze are a little different. Well, June took her there and her new blue Rolls Royce that John just given her for her.


So there's, there's a little Zocdoc, you know, yin yang there. Yeah. Jeanine was just pale white. Now she knows no strangers. So you never see Jeanine down. So she kinda walked in, she was like, she'd just been scared by a ghost. And so I kind of peeled away and met her in the back, the house. I said, what happened? She goes, I'll tell you later, can can't talk about it. Her when June had read her the right act on, on all this stuff I just told you about, you know, they're not gonna last, da, da, da, da da da. And I said, can we go now? She goes, no, we got one more day. He goes, stay nothing clean. One more day. Right. But no sooner, no sooner did we get here. And, and they were the most absolute supportive people in the world.


John came up one day, we were getting ready to shoot the, the CD cover for Brand New Man, the first cd. And I said, he, he, he was always into everything. He goes, whatcha gonna wear, you know, how you gonna look, I can do your hair? That kind of stuff into image. And I said, well, I don't know. I said, don't I, I've got a few things, ideas. He goes, all right, I'll be back. and he said he left, he getting his Mercedes, he shot out, it's down the hill. He had needed a goat to get up the, the mountain to it. He comes fly, he goes flying down the hill, I guess he goes home, comes back in an hour or so, opens the trunk of the car, reaches in and hands me this black suit. and he goes, he goes, I had this back in 1972. It was made by Manuel.


and he goes, I was sick back then, which meant I was, he was sick. Yeah, right. So he was skinny enough for me to wear my skinny ass to get in that suit, you know. and he goes, don't tell June she doesn't like me giving stuff away. And I have it to this day. I wore it on the back of that CD cover. Oh wow. Yeah. So just that's that's crazy. Oh, it was, Hey man, it Was, check the pockets, dude. Let's party. I bet that thing's got something. She was something, man, the parties there too was strictly lemonade. Lemonade and iced tea. Really keeping it sober. Keeping it completely sober on the table for sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. you know, and nothing in the back kitchen. I mean, she, she was, she was pretty Strict.


She wore the pants in that deal, huh? Yeah. At That point, was she pretty much a Yeah. Yeah, because he probably needed a care, somebody to really care, care for him. Yeah. Let me add spice to that, that little story Is that, that, that particular weekend that we were there, he was on furlough from rehab. Okay. And how long Did you have to be in rehab. Did, you get furloughed. I thought that was a military thing. I Know Johnny Cash. Right. Only Gunny cash would've went to Right. Only he would've went to bootcamp. Right. And so all of a sudden, at the end, How many tours did he do? Right? Oh, he did a lot. But the day, the day before, he is supposed to go back, this is a Saturday. He's going back on Sunday. He comes down with the flu. Yeah. But June's having no part of that.


She's completely just Uhuh. No, we're done. So she wanted to talk to him and we're caught in the middle of that. And I'm going, Jen, can, can we go home now? Can we go home now? She says, no, no, no, not yet. We please go. Janine can tell this story better I can. But so June goes to Janine, he goes, y'all have to drive me to the hospital. Take him to the hospital here in Hendersonville. Make sure, just see what's wrong with him. She says, I'm not talking to him. She says he can walk as far as I'm concerned. Okay. We got it. So we get in the car, start to get in the car. John wants to drive. Yeah. Okay. So John drives and he drove. Yeah, man. But it's, it was like pedal to the metal, boom, off all the way, pedal to the metal. And Janice, he drives Like, oh, because you start nodding off and he nod back on, you know, You nod off, you nod.


So we get to the hospital and they're rolling him in, in a, a, a, a, a wheelchair. And Janine goes up to the desk to give him all the information. And they take John back and he's there maybe an hour. And then we come back and he goes up to his room, you know, his hospital room at the house. He's, He's playing it up, man. He's like, I got do bone. I can go back. He goes, you're going back to rehab. So June goes, well, how did it go, Janine? She goes, well, they asked for his doctor. And June goes, oh hun, he's in rehab. The doctor was in Rehab, the doctor was in rehab. Oh Lord. He Goes, oh sweet. No, no, no.


Dr made furlough Yet Dr. Nick's in rehab. I said, okay, we can go now. Right. She goes pretty, pretty soon. Wow. That's a great story. That's my first Johnny Cash in June Carter. Unbelievable. Yeah. Experience. We had Rick Flair we spoke with him one time, the famous wrestler, you know, he's quite a character and he, he was in a rehab center and the doctor that it got put in there with him and he was in there. And one day, one day they're giving pills to both of 'em. and he is like, why are you giving pills to the doctor? And they're like, no, the doctor's in here now. We're like, damn. Oh Yeah. I mean, so apparently that's part of the deal, man.


Yeah. Well, it's just everywhere, let's say that. Oh, yeah. Look, so many of my friends, I mean, I, I I, I go to recovery meetings. So many people deal with, you know, that sort of stuff. Was it tough for you guys to keep it clean over the years? Did you guys get tempted with drugs or alcohol or what was that like? I don't never, I don't know, really Tempted with drugs or alcohol, huh? Yeah. No, not me. Did, you run it. I'll go with you. Why don't you to explain this? We might have, we might have took a drink or two along the way. I don't know. I think Ronnie took a, took a lot of pills, but I never did. Ooh, what fo Foul.


Yeah. But I have a, I have allergies. Oh, now you do A lot of allergies. I'm, I've never seen Somebody and Yeah. Oh, that dust will give it to you, brother. I'm from Louisiana too, dude. I started drinking at a very early age. That's true. Huh? Wow. Was it hard? Yeah. Were there certain points where you guys had to like, tell each, like Yeah. At what point do you guys ha, did, do you guys ever have to be like, each other's like Caretaker? Yeah. Not caretaker in the sense like actually physically, but just like, you know, and then how hard is it to take that suggestion from the other guy, you know, like from the other lead. We don't do it much. We don't do it much.


I mean, that's, that's one of the unique dynamics of about how we, you know, the relationship we have. We don't do that. It, it'll, if it is, it'll be some common in passing and you, you know, and you'll know. Because honestly, we sit here and laughing about this stuff, but there's not a lot of nonsense that goes on. It's like, we're, we're up there to do what we do. We appreciate where we are. And, and I, and God knows, we know the pitfalls. Yeah. you know? And have we ever been over served on stage or whatever like that? Yes. Has, has anyone ever told us, are you slurring your words? Yeah. You're, no. you know, ing your Told that, you know, You've already written that song.


Drivers Don't write it again in the middle of it. you know, that kinda shit. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We've had a few faux positive people don't believe when I tell 'em this, we have never, I mean, we're both, you know, hardheaded. Whatevers, you know, I came from a pipeline background. Same with him, you know, and it, it's, we have never raised our voices to each other. Wow. Have we ever been mad at each other? Yeah. Have we ever been pissed at each other? Yeah, for sure. We'll go off and pout, but that's it. you know, we've always been able to go to our s separate corners and come back later. And, and some of that, you think it was just because you, 'cause you like, started to achieve your, like your most success that people would know you from once you were older.


Like you think If, you would've been younger. Like, do you ever think of like, the blessings of that? Because it's kind of a blessing and a curse. 'cause everyone wants to be, everyone wants to be 27 and famous, you know. Yeah. But if you're 38 and you get popular, you know, it's, it feels a little different, you know, Has a lot to do with it. You appreciate it, you know, you see. Exactly. Yeah. 'cause there was, there, there was a point for a long time where there was no plan B. Yeah. you know, and, and we both felt that and No. So you, you learn to, you appreciate it. It's just that, just, it's just, you know, beaten into you through, through the ranks. Yeah. Dude, we used to slow dance to y'all's music. Dude. I would be so nervous, dude.


God, dude, I just couldn't even, I would stand so far away from the girl, like, as far as I could, but still touching her a little. Like this kind of, you know, Barely touching her two fingers. You were down in the trenches, man. Look, you were on the floor. See, we're up there on the band stand going. I don't look right. I don't think I'm gonna do that. Just on. Go. Get up against it.

But I would, I would if there's a bit part or something that maybe some, some whatever if something comes up, you know? Yeah. And so, yeah, they started sending me some things and I actually started doing some movies, this and that.


And my son had studied film at, at Vanderbilt in English and wanted to be a screenwriter. And one thing led to another, he came out and started writing with some guys that had produced I co-starred with Ernie Hudson, eventually in, in a Western Oh, Sweet. I'm not familiar with Ernie Hudson. Yeah. You are with the Hudson River? No, I Don't know Who he is. you know, he was in Ghostbusters. He doesn't know him. I don't Remember. It's In the original Ghostbusters. Oh, he was? Oh, They're talking about the glasses. The only black guy in the movie. Are you kidding? Oh, shoot. Here, go Back that Ernie Hudson. Oh, that Ernie. I know who he's Oh, Ernie Hudson. Ernie Hudson. It was so Bernie. Oh, I love Ernie Hudson. Yeah, I, I can tell you did.


No, I'm joking, Ernie. No, that's a, so, so that's something you've enjoyed getting to do then. Yeah. So I got to do that a little bit. And my son wound up being a, a screenwriter, went out to LA to be Tarantino and he writes, writes movies for Hallmark now. Is He really? He does. Oh, that's awesome. Ying. Yeah. Well, hallmark still makes a lot of movies. you know, they're not, a lot of places aren't even making movies. So true. Kudos to, he's got some work, like some movies a year or something. Hallmark does. Literally. Yeah. But some of the studios hardly make any movies anymore, so good for them, man. Wow. That's Cool. What about you? You been in movies? No, I just wrote a movie with me and David Spade wrote a movie together. He did like Tommy Boy and you know who he is? Oh sure.


Oh yeah. And so we wrote a movie and I think we're gonna start making it on January 6th actually. He was in Ghostbusters. Yeah, he was, dude, he was the black guy With the glasses. Huh? With the glasses and one One. Right. So I, I'm, I'm scared about it, but I think it's, I think it's gonna happen. We worked on it for so long and now it's supposed to happen. Now I'm like, I'm scared, you know? Cool. But that's natural. That's normal. Yeah. Yeah. I think, yeah. Being scared of something. Maybe that you don't know how you can do at it or something. But we also have done it all ourselves, so it's like, so that feels good. You Should, you should talk to Billy Bob Thornton.

But the rodeo, the first event busting out, they put six prisoners on six bulls and they're PBR bulls. They're real bulls. 'cause they do a PBR exhibit kind of thing there. Put six guys on it. They release all six of them at the same time. No, of course. The prisoners stay on for like a 10th of a second and then it's all hell breaks loose. Yeah. And every event at the rodeos like that, there's one called pinball where they set up eight hula hoops in the middle of the deal. Eight prisoners stand in the hula hoops. They released two bulls on 'em and the last one in a Hulu wins the prize. And Yeah, no, it's Fantastic. You got nothing to lose. You gotta Go. The prize is just a little bit of sunlight.

I mean, I, 50, 60 years, whatever to, and people watch 'em, these kids, local cowboy kids climb on these horses and they'll ride. I mean they, they used to run 300 horses plus through a day they ride 'em to see how they buck.
