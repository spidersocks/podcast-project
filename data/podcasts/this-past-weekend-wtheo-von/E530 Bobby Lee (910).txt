Well, I didn't mean it. I didn't, I wasn't trying to like throw you under the rickshaw or whatever. I was just tr I was like, I thought a boiled egg was like I importing y'all's community or whatever.


Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, a boiled egg is important in many communities. Yeah. The Irish do it. Oh yeah. Right. Probably Africa. They do probably have ostriches. Yeah. A potato is just a fucking gay boiled egg. you know what I'm saying? That's all it. A potato. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. It's like on another thing is she was cute. Thank you. Are you, is it a girl you're dating? No, it's just somebody I was trying to hit on. Yeah. And I lost the momentum and she'll probably never see me again because of the boiled egg comment. Not true. Yeah. Yeah. 100% true. And you seem to do that a lot. Do I really? No. My bad man. Yeah. That was the one time, you know. But here's another thing.

You threw it out there as a truth. Right. And then I don't know what the thing, you know, I I, if you're bi, dude, I'm good with it. If I was bi, I would know. I think, you know, I would, you know what I'm saying? like, I don't, you would've an inkling or something. Yeah.

But I've been dating this person, and every time we, and rarely do we do this, make beautiful love.


Oh God. Yeah. Yeah. The sacred rituals of love. She goes, yeah. When I was, you know, eight years ago. Yeah. I hooked up with Theo. Uhuh. Yeah. But she says it every time we're naked. Mm. And it hurts me. That's all. And I, I wanna share that with you. Fuck, dude. That's, that's crazy. I think. I don't believe her. And Oh, oh, so you don't believe that you did hook up with her?

And you do long strokes. Mm. Yeah. I do strokes.


I, I say it's long even though it is. And I'll be like, oh, that's long. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know what? You You know what I mean by long strokes. Uhuh long. I mean, I'm thinking you're assuming sexual. Well, you know, it's some, you know, here's what I don't like, people that are like fat, you know, talking about somebody with aorta issues or whatever, huh? Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like somebody just like stroking for distance. He strokes for a quarter mile. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's sort of like, you know when the, in the Olympics, normally in the Olympics they do the breast stroke, but If you slowed it down and they Oh, yeah. You know what I mean. You do those. You don't do those. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I do some of that. Yeah.


I do long. Right. And I take a nap. Oh. And then I do short. Oh yeah. And then I rest. Mm. Do you take breaks? You're almost like a stands of music, kind of with like a, like a half half note, quarter note. Oh, you know what you're doing here. Whole rest. you know what you, when you do this, that's Asian vagina. It is. Yeah. It's plenty. Is it really? That's a lie, huh? No, it's a lie. It's all folklore. Is it? It's regular, like everyone else. For years, I, you know, I remember I almost made love to a Korean woman one time years ago. And this was in Idaho. And her leg, her legs kind of didn't separate. It was almost like Did. you ever get really strong chopsticks or whatever, and you can't open 'em or whatever.


Wait, it was just like that, bro. I swear to God. Maybe. it was, and no offense to that lady. Maybe it Maybe it was a mermaid, huh? Yeah, right. Was it a mermaid? I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. Are there, are there Korean Asian mermaids? There have to be, huh? Bring that up. Bring up an Asian mermaid or something. Beached Asians or whatever. Because if there were, they'd probably eat their own, because they love sushi. Oh, imagine. Oh, here we go. Wow. Yeah, there are. And I'm the buy one dude. Yeah. Yeah. This dude will swim through West Hollywood, bro. I'll tell that dude, I wasn't Hawaii that day. And, and I saw that at a store and Ibotta it immediately. And I ran to the beach. I go take this photo, dude.


Would you Dude, I'm telling you right now. Oh, little Mermaid. Oh, little Mermaid would be better. Oh, with me in it now. Yeah. It wouldn't be Little Mermaid. It'd be Fat Mermaid. But you have like, the music would change Wondering Tree. Yeah. Yeah. We, I could be Yeah. Part of that world. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So Bobby Lee, man. Good to see you, dude. Good to see you, man. Oh, those are my gripes. We're good. Appreciate it. you know, you know, you, you've been going on the road, my friend, my boy Emir Kay.


Yeah. He is wonderful. He's a wonderful man, dude. Very funny. Like, we're going fishing next week up in Oregon, actually. Yeah. He loves fishing. He's good at it. Yeah. And you're good. You're doing shows up there. Yeah. He's a good dude. And. what? But you don't tour as much. People wanna see you in more places, but you don't like leaving home as much. Is that true? Just, yeah. That's okay. I don't go out at all. In fact, like I, I'm going up to Vancouver on the 12th, and I'm doing it with Sura and Sura iss. Like, well, can you do the day before? And then the day after too, because I'm playing Eugene and someplace in Colorado and I just do Vancouver You. know what I mean, because I just, you don't like being away from home from Well, I mean, just truth of the matter is, is that I like doing standup and spurts.


Yeah. And I'm not addicted to like, I. I see. Like Santino and all these guys, they're all addicted to the, you know, they're doum hits. Not do op Wait, dopamine, dopamine, dopamine hits. Yeah. The dopamine hits. Right. Doing shows. And it's like, I, I just never been addicted to that, that dopamine hits. Yeah. You know, I, I I love being at home. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I don't know how you do it. 'cause every time I'm on a line, I see you, you're in Australia or whatever, whatever, and you're killing it. And it's like, I'm happy for you, but I just never had that addiction to it. you know? I think because of the fact that, like, early on I had just so much trauma from it, from being on stage.


Yeah. Like, one time I was at, it's that casino gig in New Jersey, I forgot what it was called. And it's a, it's a casino gig that everyone played. Montenegro, Montenegro, I don't know. I don't know what it was, but it was like, and I remember they had this red curtain behind the stage. And I remember one show I bombed so hard because this is before I think now, you know, because I have fans that get me You know what I mean. And but before, when I was just on Mad TV and stuff, like my fans, they, I mean, they were, they knew me from Sketch. And so they wanted to see me do You know what I mean? My catchphrases. Yeah.


Like, you know, sometimes I do or Oh, oh, hotdog or whatever. Yeah. Right. Like home alone or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. you know what I'm talking about? Why don't they have an Asian home alone? Why don't y'all make a home alone? Right. Well, the home is made outta rice paper, aren't they? Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's like, yeah. And they could get in quickly. Yeah. The burglars, right. They could just run through like the Hulk. Right. So maybe that's why I think it'd be a 10 minute movie then. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean. Get me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm dying or whatever. That's very good. Clever dude. You got. Well, I think different cultures should all have their own films. Okay. Let's talk about it.


So I think that they should be, there should be a castaway. Right? But all an Asian guy. Right. And, but instead of him talking to the volleyball, what'd they call him? Wilson. Wilson. Right. Instead of that, he makes a volleyball factory and he's a sweatshop and he makes monkeys and stuff work. You know what I mean. Yeah. Right. So you do a little twists like that. Yeah. Yeah. you know, it's more about the industry or something. Yeah. It's more about work ethic. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean and resilience in that way. You know what I mean. He could have a couple of stores going on. Factories going on. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean. He could be making fucking volleyballs. Right? Yeah. They should remake, I know Wizard of Oz.


Oh, all Asian. What do you think? Wizard of Oia? Excuse me. Oia. Or Ossian. Some people say people aren't saying Asians as much anymore. A lot of people say, oh, that's os who are saying it Like that Ossian. Who's saying Assan? I was at a hotel, actually, I was in Australia and a lady said, we have a lot of Ian here. Mm.

She could play it Good. Well, she's a good actress. Yeah. She's good at, so if she needed to be wicked, she could do it.

Can I just say something about you? Is you are one of the nicest guys I think I've ever met in com in comedy. Really? Yeah. Thanks man. I mean it's, I I think I'll, I'll I'll, can I give you them my list? Yeah. Okay. And, and you'll probably know but, and let's, we will talk about men. Okay. Okay. I'll talk about women too, but I think aside from you, let's, let's grade 'em from one to 10 niceness. Okay. Singing in. Well, but let's do it. Okay. Because I'm only gonna g give you names that are like Nice. Okay. Greg Fitzsimmons. Oh, oh my God.


Nine outta 10. Yeah, for sure. and he has a new book that just came out. What's it called? It's a special and he has a new video book that just came out. A special, yeah. and he on YouTube. He was just on your podcast about it, wasn't he? No. Greg Fit Simmons. Yeah. you know me, you know me. So check that out. I love Greg. I love him. Alright, so let's go Fihi. Manir oh nine nine. Yeah. I don't think anybody wants to be a 10. Right? They have a little bit of thing that makes him not be a 10. Yeah, they're sick. Perverts dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So that keeps everybody a little lower. Nikki Glacier. Eight or nine for men.


Six. If she's supposed to be male, then she's doing a bad job. Yeah. Yeah. Bad job. Female nine. Yeah. For a female. I think she's a nine. Yeah, she's nine. I don't, let's try to find a 10. There's no 10. The nicest, the nicest guy in comedy. I don't think I can find a 10 then. 'cause if, if fucking Greg Fit Simmons is a nine, maybe. Jelly Roll. Sebastian. Sebastian's a nice guy. Nice guy for a busy guy. He always tries to communicate and stay and stay tapped in. But he's also, but he's only, oh my God, I don't wanna get in trouble, but, oh God. I try to edit my, you know, I gotta edit my shit now, man. So I gotta think clear about it. What?


But I wanna say something. I, I believe If you are in his visual range. Yeah. Right. Somebody that he has a relationship with. Yeah. Right. That he's a 10. I think he's a 10, but I, I don't think that if you're not in his visual range or in his ecosystem, it's hard to get in. Yeah. 'cause he's, he's so elusive. Yeah. He, he'll park his car, he'll do a set and there's no way of like, You know what I mean, going, yo, yo, yo, let's you know, I'm a comic too, or whatever. And developing a relationship. I think he know the people he knows is who, who he knows. Yeah. And there's, and that fucking roster is filled.


Yeah. That's what I think. I think at a certain point you've done all of that and it's like, you only have so much bandwidth. He have children. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He have a wife and parents and I think it's just, yeah. That's, you know, I don't know if doing a lot of that fucking Yeah. Yeah. Glad handing and shit. It's not his shit. Really? Yeah. But you're good at it. Well, I feel desperate probably for to be a people pleaser, you know? No, because the truth is, last night when I was with, so those two girls that I was with, three girls you were with? No, the other one was a stray. Well, whatever dude. She knew that I was gonna probably go say hi to you. Yeah. And she went to your show. Well, it's funny that a stray went missing around an Asian B lm.


Yeah. Yeah. But, and I knew that ya I don't have that thing. Like, oh, this could backfire. Yeah. you know, sometimes people are like that, where like a girl will go, Hey, can I, oh, okay. So my friend Alan Meadows, I grew up, I went to high school with him. He was at the store maybe a month ago. And he's, he's never been to the store and iss never, he's like, so, like he's one of those high school friends Yeah. That are, is just so stoked for you. Yeah. You know what I mean. Yeah. And I, and I, and I, I love this guy. And we were at the store and he, and he sees Mark Marin, and he goes, can you introduce me? And for a split second, I was like, I, don't know.


you know, I did it. Yeah. And Mark was also eating pizza, which I've never seen him do. I never seen him eat anything. I know You know what I'm saying? Mark? Yeah. Yeah. Me either. So it's, yeah. It's scary to introduce, but he was not, he was nice though. He was, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But it's, it's, it's, you don't know You know what I mean. Well, mark doesn't pretend a lot, I don't think, you know, so I feel like I If, you, you know, you're gonna get the real mark. It's like Bill Burr, you, you're gonna get who they are at that moment. Okay. Do you get scared around him when you walk up to him? Bill? Yeah. I bill Burr. I get, I get like, and I feel bad. It's just me. He came on the show last night, dude. He jumped on the show. Yeah, I know. It was fucking awesome, dude. I stood on the side and I was like, I need to go home and work right now.


I did not want to tell a joke. He, he just, he's, he is, I mean, he is the best maybe. I think he's the best. But, oh, there's just something about, like, me and Andrew were doing bad friends. He was upstairs, I guess is the editing place, and he was editing a special. We didn't know that. So we're just doing bad friends. He just walks in. Oh yeah. We had no idea. And it was almost as if I was tongue tied. You know what I mean. I mean, I, he's done Tiger Belly a bunch of times. I've been to his house. I'm friends with him. I love the guy. Right. But every once in a while I get tongue tied, like I don't know what to say. And I'm always like, like he's one of those guys where it's like, you let him talk.


Yes. And then you go, yeah, man. That's cool. Dude. That's how like I was last night. I was all embarrassed. I was like, it was almost like a hot chick was there, kind of. I know. Yeah. He's a hot chick and you're like, at the certain points. I couldn't even look at him. I just look at my other friend and we were both like supposed to be listening to him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or both looking at each other. Yeah. He just, and he's also a super nice guy too, which is also rattled. I kind of wish he was a dick. Well, I think his material is so like him that Yeah. There's like something that's intimidating about him, but I don't think he, I don't think he means it to be that way. No. I think his material is just so it's on in our head. It's in our heads. Oh, totally. It's so funny you said that. Yeah. It's in our heads because he left and we werere all like, oh dude, dude, were, you know, like I was like I when I went back there.


Yeah. The, the residual of him being there was still around. Yeah. People were like, oh, bill was just here. Yeah. It was like, I go. I don't give a fuck. It was like the wizard of positive when that storm hit. People were like, whoa. Putting their windows back together and shit. Yeah. you know? Yeah. Maybe he could be the wizard in our Asian wizard or Wizard of all. Oh. Anyway, I'm gonna tell you something that happened to me other day. And, what would you do in this situation? But do you think it's 'cause we're intimidated of his talent? Move on. Sorry. I'm gonna go back to what you were saying and I'll go back to what you're saying. I just wanna know. No, no, no, it's good. We can just cut. That's fine. Okay. They're just, I'm gonna tell you like we did with the nicest, I'm gonna tell you who just in my opinion, when they're around, it has the same vibe.


Okay. So Chappelle obviously Chris Rock. Yeah. Like, Chris will go, what's up man? You know what I mean. And I'm always like, ha, you know? Yeah. I like you. you know, I get really tongue tied with that dude. Yeah. you know that dude? Oh yeah. One Christmas dude, I dunno if I told, have I told you about this? This, that's his movie. One Christmas. Yeah. It was such a great movie. Is it really? No, man. Oh, I don't, one Christmas, dude, I was on a date. I watched a movie with this girl. you know, have you ever been to this third Street Promenade? Yes. Right. So then, you know, I went to this date and I held ha I tried to hold her hand in the, in the in the thing. Yeah.


And she kind of scooted away. I couldn't get no vibes from her. And afterwards, the Brook Stone, well, not Brookstone. What's the bookstore? Barnes and Noble. Barnes and Noble. All right, dude. All right. There's a better way to say that. Her borders books, which Kamala Harris hasn't visited the whole time she's been in office. Yeah. Barnes and Noble dude. Yeah. Right. So you know how they had the magazine section? Yeah. So me and her wandered in the, it was just during Christmas. Oh. We wandered into the magazines. That two Asians. A couple periodicals. Yeah.

Right. and he comes out that, and he looks at the girl, I swear to God. and he goes, this guy right here, one of the funniest in the business. Wow. He goes, Merry Christmas. He walks away. I hooked up with that girl last night, that night. Fuck. Yeah. That was a layup. But he's one of 'em, you know, who's another one for some reason, Sarah Silverman. Very sweet. She's so sweet. But I, there is a little bit like I. I, I wanna watch what I'm gonna say. I want to You know what I mean. I'm a little self-aware of how I'm behaving.

That's what he is. Yeah. and he iss A BLM guy. He said, Bobby Lee matters. He said, yeah. Are you intimidated by Joe Rogan? What? I think maybe less and less over time. He has such a good memory.

Oh, dude. Where were, where was I in 11?

No, I don't explain like, like Boat Bobby kind of like live bait, Bobby, you know? Well, you know, I've gone through some things Yeah. And I've evolved. Well, that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a good thing like that, that little yellow bad boy that piss scallop. you know what I'm saying? That fucking hero piss scallop. Yeah. I, oh, this must be Did. you hear that?

I was at home and, and you know, you know, when I wake up in the mornings, I have a coffee and I bust up my iPad and I just start like, I go, just go to news. I just wanna see what's going on. Yeah. And that was, you know, and then I remember just watching it going, what a sad day for our country, man. Yeah. you know? How, what was he like?


Donald Trump? Were you nervous? He was, I mean, he's kind of Were you nervous? Yeah. Like more nervous than you've ever been in your life. Yeah. Yeah. I would be too. And then when he, I gotta know when he walks in. Right? I mean, do are you, do you have things planned? Yeah. I had some ideas, but I think I was super nervous. I'd had a long week and it was like, you ever have like a date you're excited for, but you've had a craziest longest week and it finally Friday night comes or something. You're like, yeah, but you, that's what it was. Yeah. That's what it was. And so it was like, you know, and so I just, and I knew I had a limited amount of time. And, what was the time? Probably 52 minutes.


We had 52 minutes. Yeah. That's a long time though. Yeah. But I to talk, I know we can go fast and he can get on some, he gets on some tangents. Tangents. and he Right. He goes in now. Yeah. Yeah. So I didn't, why? I was like, you have to kind of curtail him a little bit, you know? And so I tried to do that with the clips I've seen though. I think that you were pretty, you were good.

Yeah. I'm not the president of Asians. I, I seem to think that, you seem to think that I'm their leader. Like every month there's a gathering. Right. And I get all this information from people. Yeah. Right. And then I go out to the world. I'm their spokesperson or something. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. You're like, Kim Jong No, I'm not Kim Jong-Un you're like a smaller ver like scam Jong-Un Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. you know, I think that Kim Jong-un and I come from the same body type. Yeah, I would say that. Yeah. Right. Like, if they made a factory of like Asians. I'm the same mold as Kim Jong-Un and Benedict Wong. Yeah. you know Benedict Wong?


I don't think so. You ever see Dr. Strange Uhuh? You have the very emperor's body That's Benedict Wong. Oh, you guys, yeah. That's the era you're in right now, Bobby. Yeah. Yeah.

You have very like the emperor that inherits the castle type of, you know. Thank you. Thank you, dude. That's the best. Yeah. But I wanna say that, I don't know if there, you know, I know Stephen Chung. you know him? Yeah, he is. I think look up Stephen Chung. I think he's an attorney for Trump. Is it Stephen Chung? Attorney? Yeah. Republican.

Because who? Do Asians support Trump or not? Okay, I'll, I think some do. Yeah. I'm sure some do When it comes to the economy, probably You know what I mean? Because what, what is this one?


This Is a Trump country. We live in the southeast. We drink sweet tea. We don't drink socialist Kool-Aid. Wow. Wow. So there are, there, there, there. Out there. Yeah. What? Well, like this is the sweet tree country. We don't string the ko. What does he say? Social needs. Wow. Dude. I wrote that speech for him. Did, you know that at the meeting I did. Yeah.

What, what percent of Asians are supporting Trump, though, do you think?


Yeah. Are you trying, let me ask you something with this line of questioning, are you trying to get what I, what my political affiliation is? No. Right. I ain't gonna tell you dog. Okay. Yeah. And I have to say this. I'm in the middle. Yeah. What do you I am, that's a good question, man. Because obviously there are things that I like, you know, I, I like both sides. Like a woman's right to choose. I don't give a fuck. I want them to have the right to, I, it's not me. It has nothing to do with me. Right. I just think, I mean, I'm in, I'm kind of, I'm in the middle of one side, kind of, you know what I'm saying?


A little bit more Or what do you mean? Huh? So you're in the middle of one side. Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay. I think I've always been, I mean, I love the fact that Trump brought over RFK Jr. Yeah. Yeah. I'm still pissed at the Democrats. Railroaded, BERNIE. SANDERS. I like four and eight. Me too. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, do is democracy even real in this country anymore? Okay. I don't know. Okay. That's what I don't even know anymore. I don't even know if all of us are just being played. That's what it starts to feel like, you know? Yeah. I generally don't like talking about politics, but I'll say this. I, I'll say that one side, you know, is more supportive of what I do for a living.


What do you do? Okay. Okay. Comedy You mean a comedy? Comedy Comedy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You mean some freedom of speech or whatever? Yeah. Okay. I think one side is a little more sensitive than the other side. And so, you know, I struggle with that fact. Yeah. you know, look, man, look, I've voted for Obama and I've voted for Trump. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm not a, I am open to anything. Yeah. I've never really voted. Really? Never voted for Obama. One season. You did one season. I Did. you did? Yeah. What? But can you go back to the, you see, here's what you did. I wanna go back to the, my remember the original question I had? Yeah. Like from 15 minutes ago, and then you were like, oh, I wanna go back to that.


And we never did. Oh, about what? I forgot. Being bisexual or whatever. No, no, no. After that I was, yeah. I didn't even explain it to you. Something happened to me the other day and I wa I was, yeah. What was it? I, I was gonna tell, I was gonna ask you like, what would you do in that situation? Yeah. What was it? So I was at a gas station, right? And I'm pumping gas, and there's a guy like right in back of me pumping gas, you know? and he, he looks at it and he goes, he goes, yo, dude, can I get a photo? Right? And I, dude, that day, dude, I had went through it. I was beaten down, I was tired. I was in a really bad mood.


And I go, yeah, okay. and he goes, ah, nevermind then, because I wasn't enthusiastic about the photo. Right. you know, what does one do in that situation? I think you just gotta respect it. 'cause I think it played out like it was supposed to, you know? But then I go, I'll take a photo. and he is like, nah, man. Now he, yeah. Now you're the bad guy. Now I'm the bad guy. Yeah. He's like, I don't want a photo with you because You know what I mean. What he's basically trying to say is, 'cause I wasn't like, yeah, let's take a photo. You, me, yeah. Forever. Right. He wanted that reaction. Yeah. When I gave him an organic, like, yeah, dude, I'm, you know, I didn't say this, but it's like, I'm fucking tired, but I'll do it.


'cause I, I've never said no to anybody. Well, that's part of the problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's sometimes you have to like, 'cause yeah, I would be like that forever. And now I've started to set my own boundaries. Sometimes I would be like, Hey man, I'm having a bad day. I don't feel like it, I'm at the gym. I'm just trying to work out. Or little things like that. Because you also don't want to interrupt your train of thought sometimes your imagination or whatever. 'cause every time you like, you know, so sometimes that can be a bit overbearing. You killed it in Sweet Dreams. Oh, in the movie. Thanks. You killed it in that. Thanks dude. Yeah. You're, I wish they had more, I wanna say sex in it. Okay.


Maybe that's sweet dreams too. Yeah. Me, our characters. The sweetest dreams. Yeah. Yeah. But you, every, I, I'm telling you right now, If, you wanted to, which is, I know you're not gonna want to do it. I know you. What are you looking at me like that? Huh? Why are you looking at me like that? That's how I look. Oh, you're like, oh, am I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. If, you wanted to, you could be an actor. I know you don't want to though. You were just so natural up there. Well, thanks man. It was cool. Like the, I know you don't want to talk about it, but No, I appreciate it, man. Yeah. I think I would like to make something. I just wanna make something of my own. You will. That's the only thing you will, I don't wanna be a part of something, anybody else's thing.


I understand that. But the, but the test is, and you passed it, I think is to do a project that like, you have nothing to do with show up and saying other people's words and you know, you're doing it with real actors and people that are like, been doing it for years and just holding your own and being natural and being good You. know what I mean. And so I just wanted to give you that, those props, you know, because you really did kill it. Thanks man. Alright. You're welcome. You always doing a nice job, man. Of saying nice things about people. Where'd you learn that? I wonder? Hmm. Where'd you learn that? Like, you always do that where you like say something nice about people. I'll tell you why, because I hate this.

No, they hated me, huh? Are on your fucking mind. They fucking hated me back then. Really? Yeah, it was dude.

No, I, I mean, what do you mean? Like, there was, you know, or graffiti or whatever. No, no, no. They wouldn't do stuff like that. But it would be more like, you know, one time I was, I had a, a list of jokes I was gonna try and a comic picked that outta my hand. Oh. and he goes, seen it, seen it, done it, done it, seen it, seen it, done it. And just handed it back to me. You know what I mean. Just like flat out, fucking rude for no fucking reason. Because it's like, but now, because, because of the internet or whatever, it's just like, there's, you can't, you're not, you can't afford to act like that. Right, right. Because it's like everyone has a shot.


Right. And it's like, and I remember back then going, you know, if I'm ever in a position where I can be nice, I'm just gonna be, you do it all the time. you know? And I, and I feel like I think I am. You do it Well, man. What do you mean doing nice? Well, you're nice too. What the fuck are you talking about? You do it. No. Are you good at intros? I don't know. Like, when you bring people up on stage, oh, you are pretty good at it. Are you good at it? I like going up after you. I know, but are you good at it? I think I am all, so if I'm about to go up, gimme an intro, I'll be like, ladies and gentlemen, this next guy, I'll drop him off at A VFW and see how they treat him over there.


He is a true hero. you know him from bad friends. It's okay. It's good. you know him from different places on the internet. You guys, it's enough. It's enough. It's not good. It, you guys give it up. It's, it's, it's enough. Hold on. Sorry. I. can I teach you how to do it? You guys give it up for Ken Jones? No. Okay. Can I teach you how to do it? Yes. Alright. I, I, I think I, I think I know because you're a master at it. I agree. Right? So I, my theory is this, it's like If, you do like this next guy, clubs and colleges, and just something that's not specific, right.


It's just the audience can tell you there's no relationship. Be the relationship between the two people, right? Yeah. So you put in personalized things. I remember when I first met this guy, him and I had coffee and one, you know what, like, you, you personalize it, right? And then you get, you give him specific credits instead of clubs and colleges. You go, dude, I saw him an like, like for me, if I brought you up, I'd be like, dude, I did a movie with this guy called Sweet Dreams. This guy killed it in everything, you know? And he's killing it on his day. You know, just be you personalize it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To let people know that you, I wouldn't If you have a real relationship. Go Vietnam. Vietnam, DVAW, whatever the fuck you were saying, VFW, whatever you were saying, I wouldn't do that, but, you know.


Well, yeah. Okay. I'm just saying, if I took you to A VFW and dropped you off in there, what is a v Fww? Veterans of Foreign War. Oh, that's right. That's right. Power. If I, what do you think? Huh? If I dropped off, you've dropped me off in a VW If we dress you up in like a Civil War uniform, I'd drop you off. Right? A VFW. Right? I have a musket, right? You're like, we're going to kill these guys, you know? Yeah. And then I had one of those, you know, mean mustaches like Curl and one of those round bugles. What do you think that would happen? Yeah. I think they'd be like, they'd call the FBI. Hmm. Yeah. I don't think that'd be good. A lot of white guys be like, and I walked in.


Wow. Okay. Y yeah. Yeah.

Dude, Did, you see that? Pull up. That there was, there was one lady that covered the Trump thing. It was, I think this was an Asian lady, Did. you see the thing covered the, that time that we interviewed Trump, this is kind of self-aggrandizing or whatever. Oh, here we go. But that's not even all Trump has wooed this hyper masculine online culture deeply during a recent podcast with the comedian Theo one. Instead of talking about economy or immigration or healthcare or the global conflicts, they discussed cocaine addiction. No cocaine. Did you. Did you really? Yeah.


Would Did you ask him cocaine? Have you ever asked him? He did coke. He doesn't do coke. Right? He's never done drugs. and he doesn't, he doesn't drink and drink. Doesn't smoke. Yeah. That's don't drink. Don't smoke. Yeah. Cocaine. A Yeah. What Did, you ask him though, what's up with cocaine addiction? I just, we talked about addiction. His brother died from addiction. Oh, wow. So we talked from alcoholism. I'm sorry. Yeah. So we talked about that. And then we talked about why he never drank or smoke. He kind of let on that he thought there could be some tendencies that he could have the same thing his brother had. So I think he didn't want, you know, he, he had fear about that. I can't, you know, I don't, do you understand that or no? What? Your brother having something you have you mean? No, no, no, no. Because I met like I, remember like Dane Cook was like that.


like, I don't drink or do drugs. Carlos Mencia for a while was like that too, where I was like, I, don't touch that stuff. Like, to me it's like I. I love it. Yeah, you love it. Yeah. 'cause I just, I think I don't, I, over time, I don't, my, my natural state I think wasn't my favorite throughout my life, probably how I felt. So if I could change that in some way, then I wanna do that. So those are the things you change it with either. Yeah. you know, stuff like that. I think, you know. Well, I just don't like feelings. Yeah. Wow. That's interesting. I don't any kind. It's like I and I'm sober now, and I've, and I've been able to like, kind of what my therapist says is to like, kind of just identify what you're feeling Right.


And feel it, you know? And I, but I never liked him. I never liked depression or sadness or trauma or anything. I, when you, I, I just, I just, it doesn't sit well in my body. You know what I mean. So it's like, I always like, consume things with it, but it's, you know, but that's more destructive, you know? And so that's why I'm sober. And I, I'm, I feel pretty free now. And I, I think I can handle most emotions. Well, you take on a lot more social. You've been a lot more social, I think in the past two years. It seems like, you know, social. What do you mean? Just like, trying to stay busy, do more things. Right. Like actually put yourself out into situations and stuff. Dude, I think I never, like you said, I didn't never like having feelings.


I, like, no matter how I felt, I felt ashamed of how I felt. That was weird, you know? Yeah. Like, it's, a lot of times I wouldn't feel good and this, I'm trying to, I'm not getting a self pity. I'm just saying, I'm not saying this. I feel fine today, but sometimes I wouldn't feel good. And then I would feel ashamed for not feeling good. That's the part that I didn't understand sometimes. 'cause that made it so hard to like, figure out the first part. you know? Does it make any sense or no? Yeah. I, it makes like, a lot of sense. And it just, I just, it just struck me that I don't wanna get too sentimental with you, but there are times where I really believe this, that I feel concerned about you.


Really? Yeah. I just, because I, I, I, you know, I, because I don't know really what's going on, you know? I feel like, you know, there was a time where that we, we talked more and there was more communication. But let's, let's face it, you've risen a little bit. I know you hate to, it's hard to hear. It's hard to hear. It's hard to hear that you've risen, but you have, well, things got, things have worked, gotten busy, are so good for you. Right? And I think with that rise, right, there's like more of a disconnect with your friends because you're so busy. And You know what I mean, you're doing other things. I get it. But it's like I, I'm always concerned about like, you know, you know, if you're sober, if, like, is he going to meetings?


you know, is he You know what I mean, talking to people about things that are going on, you know? Yeah. I, I, you know, I always feel like things are probably good with you, but it's like I have to admit that there is, you know, concern. I don't know why. I mean, 'cause I love you. No, I appreciate you. No, do I, I mean, I love you. Love you too. you know that, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think, yeah, it's kind of been, I know this is a comedy podcast, but it's like, you know, I just, I don't care. And I just have to say that because it's like, because I've seen it. I've seen people rise and then, you know, they get lost. And then also there's people around them that don't necessarily care and they're just in it for the ride.


I don't know who you're surrounding yourself with or whatever. You know what I mean. So You know what I mean. You're probably healthy and doing well. I don't know. But it's like, there is a concern that like, you know, maybe You know what I mean. You're, it's alone at the, when you get higher up, there's more loneliness. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, how are you doing? I don't know. I mean, I think podcasting makes me feel pretty connected to people. you know? I think me not living here has been, that's a good thing. It's been good, but it's also been, I don't get to see a lot of people as much, I don't get to see a lot of my guys from aa. I think, yeah. My sober program hasn't been that good the past month for sure. Mm. And so I think the really two months, like, or probably the past month, but just, yeah, not being able to like, you know, it's like I'll work late and so then I don't wanna make the morning Zoom meeting or make the, you know, and then I'll get up late and then I, it's like I try to go to the gym, then I'll miss the noon in person meeting.


So just, yeah. I gotta touch base with some people. And dude, I was in Butte, get honest and get tight. Yeah. I was in Butte for a month, Montana for a month for doing what? I did a movie. And there like Butte, there's nothing to do. And one day I was in my hotel room, there was nothing to do. And I called one of the guys that lives there and I go, can you gimme an A schedule? And I trekked a couple of times all the way to this, like in the boonies. Oh, yeah. And I walk into the school and like, there's old white people with oxygen tanks and like You know what I mean. And obviously they drug mules. Yeah. Drug mules. Yeah. And obviously they've never seen an Asian walk into an a meeting there.


Yeah. I never saw one black person in Butte. Yeah. So when I walked in, it was just like, Charlie You know what I mean. Yeah. you know, you know, they get Vietnam flashbacks, You know what I mean. you know, get down, get down You. know what I mean. You know what I mean. you, I don't know, I'm in AA too. You know what I mean and when I'm sitting there Right. Even though like, you know, we don't have the same lifestyles that these people. Right. you know, at least I can say to myself, like, you know, I'm trying, you know, I'm trying to like, take care of myself on a daily basis. And did one fucking, I went to a meeting and I, you know, because there was only two Uber drivers in Butte, and this guy came, this guy's just sitting next to me goes, Hey man, my name's Derek.


And I go, thank. And he goes, I'm a fan. I go, he goes, you wanna ride home a fan, you mean? Yeah. What do you mean? Like a Asian? No, not like dad fan. Oh, okay. He was a dad fan. Okay. It was a deaf fan. No, I didn't know. I was not Def fan. No. It was just like a fan of You know what I mean? Yeah. Of mine. Yeah. And my comedy. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And then he, and then, so I get in the car with his wife. Hmm. and we go the opposite direction. No. Of the hotel. They wanna watch you fucking throw that little livo lean long strokes. Yeah. Yeah. And so then I go, Hey, my hotel's that way. Like, we know, man, where are we going? You gonna, to our house.


Wow. Right. So I go to this house and they want me to meet their kids. Uhuh. Yeah. How old were the kids? I don't know, but they were little white kids. Oh. Too young. So they came up. I, there's these two dogs that fucking jump on top of it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Dude. Huh. And then there's these like white kids that come out of the room Right. Wiping their You. know what I mean? Yeah. They're not crying. They're, you know, they're, that's how they, when they wake, wake up. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. And they're like, yeah, our mommy took us to Missoula and gave us $300 to, for, for school clothes. Fuck. I gotta beat their ass. I don't even know. You can't beat their ass. You can't. Yeah. Like, fuck you bitch like that. But they have $300 dude to split amongst some kids. My mom gave me $30 from the time I was age five to the time I was age 18.


Oh, you're right. You're right, you're right. Yeah. So 300, those kids. But I was in that house for like 45 minutes. Yeah. It sounds like you're, why would you, it sounds like you're waste your time. No, but I, I'm, no, what I'm saying is I'm willing to go to like these legs any lengths I see. To like, just whatever, You know what I mean. Yeah. And they're su they're super sweet. Yeah. I didn't think I was gonna get, like, imagine if I was in a Well Mm. In the basement. Yeah. Right. And you're like, what would you have? Throw down? You get two things thrown into the well, oh shit. Oh shit. Yeah. Oh. So I would lube. No, no, no, no. That's not good. I mean, if you're gonna also use it as a beverage, I think it's fine. You're gonna, you're right, you're right. Two things that water.


Yeah, that's right. Right. And then food. Oh, yeah. Like Jerseys, jersey, mikes or Seeds. Plant your own food. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But, ooh. But you know how, how it depends on how long it takes to grow. Or you could also eat the fingernails that are in the fucking Oh, right. That's protein, right? Is that protein? Yeah. I would just the fingernails. Right. And eat 'em. You know what I mean. A little bit of wall caviar, huh? Yeah. That's all. It's, I would be so frightened. Would you be frightened? Oh, I would be so scared, dude. Yeah. And I would probably, what would I do down there? Sing a lot. And you'd have to hold your peepee or your, there's an echo. So what song would you hear sing? I would, I would sing. you know, I know what Oh, little Town of Bethlehem.


That's a good one for me. Awes. Awe. Imagine I'm in a well and I just go a Right. You get a shrimp and they just shrimp. They catch it like a fucking Wal. Okay. There's drugs, dude. Is there a lot of drugs right now? I've been here. There's a lot of drugs in the, in the Asian community. A lot of T Trak or whatever. I've been hearing, there's like a lot of, dude, I've been hearing that Trak is the big thing in the Asian community. Is that true? Like, traks for Trak or whatever.


It's like, just, just hear me out. Alright. It's like, if I said to you, man, I heard there's a lot of shoe laces in the white community. Yeah. Does that make any sense to you? Wait, no. Like, like why would, like, honestly, okay, man, I heard there's a lot of fucking glitter in the black community. I mean, it's doesn't make what Yeah, whatever you're saying. Does, I feel like you're just coming up with Asian shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're just like, you're just like, I heard. There's a lot of You. know what I mean? Google. Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't go. Don't Google. Yeah. Well, no, what I'm saying is, is that do No, I'm, I'm so, you make me so mad sometimes, dude. Really? Yeah. No, I'm fine. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Google Asians Fork.


Google Asians and Drugs. Asians for tran da reports widespread. Wait, wait. It's purple. So you've looked it up before? I haven't. Yeah. Yeah. Why would you look that up already? These guys, some of these guys live here all night. Night. D-A-D-E-A reports widespread threat of fentanyl mixed with Xylazine. Xylazine. Xylazine. That's tra daddy. Yeah. Where does it say Asians on that? Well, let's see. It's gonna get there. Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced Fentanyl. Even Deadlier said Administrator Milgram of the DEA. The DEA is c xylazine and Fentanyl mixed in 48 of 50 states. The system is reporting that in 2022, approximately 23% of Fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine.


Okay. I, I know where the agent comes from. Can I tell you where? Yeah. This is what you read. Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced Fentanyl. Even Deadlier said administration milligram do. And it, and it says right here, no up. No up there. So I say also known as Tran. Yeah. You think that's an Asian word? Tran? It's not. But Tran is obviously an, an Asian name. Yeah, I know. But you can't, you know what I'm talking about. I, I know what you're talking about, but I'm just saying that's not what it's referring to. I think it's referring to tranquilizer. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I'm saying is, it's like You know what I mean. Oh yeah. Tranquilizer. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was like, Tran seems like a V like a Vietnamese or Korean nickname.


You agree? Tran Tran. I just like Matt, like Matthew Trunk. I know, I know Matthew Trunk. Yeah, I know graduate, I know graduate sociology major. Yeah. So, dude, I wanna let you know, dude, but that is tran, that's fentanyl. I understand. But that has nothing to do with Asians. Okay. Okay. Let's just move on from here. Google. Go to images, then see if we get any. Okay, here we go. Yeah, you're right. Maybe right there. You tell me that face is an ion. I think you're right.


Asians, Fortran. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. Well, you know, I learned something new. Thank you. I'm sorry for attacking you. Yeah, it's okay, man. It breaks my heart though. It's just sad. Is this someone on Trak right here? Look at her sneakers. She is a brand new druggie. Oh, this is somebody on track, dude. On Fentanyl. On Fentanyl. Dude, can you pause that for a second? Dude. Sometimes, sometimes people with their own fentanyl, it's almost as if they're doing yoga, but then they freeze. like I wanna do downward dog. Oh, it's sad. It's so sad. I shouldn't have even made a joke like that. Well, it's sad that it's just like, have you ever done fentanyl? No. I hope not. Yeah, me either.


I, because because I remember years ago, Vicodin really fucked me up. Really? I was addicted to Viking for Would you take it at night or during the day? All day long. Like from like, dude, I got dude Drew Barrymore. I swear to God, I think still hates me because of that. Wow. I'll tell you why. For doing Vicodin? No, because I used to have a bowl of Vicodin in my fucking dressing room at Matt tv. And the Strokes played one night. Oh wow. Right. Yeah. And I guess the drummer was dating Drew Barrymore. Right. and he, he was trying to get sober or something like that. But they all ended up going into my room and eating all my pills. Yeah. you know? 'cause I'm generous. Yeah.


Eh, fuck it. Go get it. Right. And then I heard that she was mad at me. 'cause you had the, it's not your fault. That's true. It's not your fault that you had them. I know that's true. We can't, you know, it's weird to blame the dealer unless the dealer is like pushing 'em on you. Were you pushing 'em on them? Yeah, I was. Dude, I'm sorry if I'm being rude. I feel now. Am I being like, no, dude, I whatcha you talking about? Dude? All right. There's listen guy. What, what? Oh, okay. Listen Guy. Yeah. What, what you doing?

If I was mad at you, I, I'm, I, I'm very comfortable of going, listen, I have an issue. Have you ever had an issue with me? Be honest. Have you ever had a resentment toward me? like, I wish he didn't do that, or No? Sometimes I feel like it's a little tough to try and get to know you, kind of. But I think it's tough to try and get to know comedians, you know?


Yeah. But that being said, I mean, I'm a comedian. Right. It's hard to know any comedian. And I think you're people, everybody love you so much that it's like, you want that guy to know you want to know that guy better.

But that was on a TV show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, wow. Look at that acting. That's Miami Vice, huh? Fucking terrible. No, imagine. Isn't it? It was Magnum. Yeah. But on what have you been dating a lot or not? All right. Let's, you wanna get into it? Yeah. 'cause it seems like a lot of stories you tell have had dating in 'em. I'm trying to, okay. I'm trying to find the love of my life. Are you really? I think I'm ready. Okay.


Babe, you look like Stevie right now. How are you doing? No, I, I, I, listen, I'm, I like some of the girls that I'm dating now, but they're kind of flaky. Like, you know, like, I'll, I'll like I won't call in on a Thursday. 'cause I know. 'cause I've said like, let's go to dinner and hang out. Right. And so then Thursday I'll come around like, nah, I don't wanna do it now. Or I'm busy. Like, bitch, I sacrificed stage time. you know how Val you know how valuable stage time is. Yeah. You know what I mean. It's like, so it's like that kind of shit. And then it's like, yeah, I just, and also there, do I fully trust them You know what I mean?


I think so, man. I think, no, I wanna be able to find somebody that I fully can confide in and go, this is how I feel. You know what I mean. And, and I want somebody to also go give me suggestions or like feedback that I kind of honor and respect and go, oh yeah, that's a good, you know, angle You know what I mean. It's just like, but then also I want somebody hot. Right. So to find that combination You know what I mean. You want somebody you're attracted to. Yeah. Somebody I'm at Attract. Like, what, what I find attractive isn't necessarily what you think. I think so though. I think you and I like the same maybe. I don't know. You don't? No, I never, I I, I, the couple of girls I've seen you with over the years are people, I mean, are people that I would be like I mean there, there's this one girl that used to see that I just thought you should marry.


But yeah, I remember. Hey, come dude, love. Because I just saw regret there. Yeah. I just saw regret there, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just couldn't get it. And that's the thing, I think that you and I have the same kind of issues. I think we have intimacy issues. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I think that it's hard for us to get really vulnerable. I mean, I had that with Kailah for 10 years, but she was the first one in many, many years that I could do that with. There's just something about her that was, I was able to, like, we were able to do that. Right. But it's like, but did the NMC freeze up after a while? Like, it was hard to like, be like sensual or whatever.


I, I, I, you know, the truth is, is I think that, oh God, I can't fucking, I think it's this You want me to say or not? No, no, no, no. Okay. I what I wanna say that. Don't say that. I won't say it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But what I wanna say is the problem with us, because number one, we, we, we go up on stage. Right. And what's more exciting than that? The, the business inherently is super exciting. And there's dopamine hits. Right. I'm gonna get a lot of feeling from right there. Right. And so then also, you and I are also reco recovering drug addicts. So we like excitement.


Mm. Right. and we don't like the same old thing. Right. So there is something about meeting somebody new. Right. Right. It's almost like you get that Yeah. You get that forgetful syndrome. It's like you Right. Yeah. But at the end of the day, and I'm gonna, I've never said this out loud before, and I think I fucked it up with Kilah. And I think that I wish I would've done it over again because I would've changed some things. Right. At this point, it's too late. You know what I mean. We've both moved, have moved on, but there's a lot of regret there. I, and I, I, and I swear to God, Dan, I will, the next girl I meet that, you know, and there's a couple of girls that have potential.


I'll be honest with you right now. Mm. But I, the next thing I'm gonna do it differently. Mm. Number one, I'm gonna get rid of all my machines. Wow. Really? Yep. I have a vacuum cleaner. And. what is that? Like a sex thing or something? Or you mean an actual carpet cleaner? No, I, dude, I showed up at bad friends one day and somebody had sent me something that I swear to God is the size of a vacuum cleaner. Right. It was like this big Yeah. With all these tubes and stuff. It was a sex toy. No. Yeah. Of course. I took it home. And you used it? I plugged it in. Oh, do I, I have so many of 'em.


Oh. I have so many of 'em. And I stick it in. I And. what does it play? It just Beethoven's here or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, and Right. And. What? What? Hey, put it on Christmas. Yeah. Jingle be I, I swear to God, these new machines, dude. You, it sucks you in, dude. Oh, see, I don't do any of that. And they never let go. Dude. I'm 80 days off pornography right now. Wow.


I'm gonna give you a machine May No, please. I don't want anything like that. I know, but I'm gonna I know, but you gotta try it. What does it do? It does three things. Okay. Okay.
