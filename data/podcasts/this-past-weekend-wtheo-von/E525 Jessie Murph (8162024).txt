We did a podcast this morning and yeah, might go get a massage after this or go to dinner. You Should, yeah. And yeah, that's about it. Really. You get massages a lot? I do. They're good for the soul. Yeah. They really are. Huh? I think having somebody touch you that's not trying to like, That's not sus. That's not, yeah.


Trying to be a pervert or whatever. Depends on the massage you're getting. The places I go, I tell 'em immediately when I go in there. Do not, You really do that. Oh, I tell 'em straight up. I say seriously. Yeah, because I, do You feel like you have to? I just don't, I want to, I want clear communication between me and anybody that's touching my body. I feel like. Like, 'cause here's what happened. Like, Should you be doing that though? I don't do it. What? Getting massages? No, I don't tell them that. I'm Not. Oh, you don't. You're just taking a risk. Are Should I be telling them Though? I mean, I think I I think you preface it like, Hey guys, I'm just here for the massage. Especially if I was a girl, I feel like I would No. Really? Yeah. Even if it's another girl. You think so these Days you're telling Them. You're telling them.


Yeah. 'cause some of the girls are even so strong and you don't know. You don't know who, who's who's. You don't know who's who Now? I'm nervous. Yeah. No, but I will tell 'em straight up. 'cause here's what happened. One time I was in the massage, like sometimes they have like that little chair where they put your face down. Have you seen that thing? Yeah. No, I, so I was in there, the lady's massaging me. A guy comes in, this was like at a strip mall in Tennessee. And a guy comes in and he's talking to the woman and he asks her if they do like happy endings or whatever. Damn. Like A client? And. I? Yes. Okay. And I felt like, I cannot believe this guy's asking this. And the lady's like, no, no, no. She's Doing your massage. Well, yes. Okay, okay.


The lady And I was like, tell him no, you know, I'm just like, 'cause I don't know how experienced she is or whatever. And then, yeah, she's like, no. And then the guy got, you know, he, I think he felt a little embarrassed and then he left. But anyway, that's why ever since then, I go in, I say, and if, if, if, if we have a language barrier, I'll even draw. You draw. How do you draw it? What do you draw? Well, I'll draw like, kind of a human body. Okay. And then I'll draw kind of like the, the middle area. How long Would you say this is taking you? Like How long you spend on it? Well, you know, for me it takes a little while to draw it. And then I'll put a big X over the middle. That's what you do? Yes. I, if the, I can see it. If the language is, if there's a language barrier that makes sense. Yeah. I can't judge you for that.


Thank you. Yeah. 'cause I want, I want them to know straight up I'm here so that when we both, when I leave, we both feel cool, but not strange. And that's respectful of you. Thank you. I get it. Yeah. That's where we are. You feel like had so much success at your age. Pretty crazy. Crazy. Are There moments where it's like I wish because I, I don't think people realize, like a lot of people think like, oh, I would like to have popularity. I would like to have fame. I would like to have some celebrity. you know? But then once that kind of comes, it's real and you can't like put it back in the box, you know?


Yeah. Do you ever have moments where you're like, gosh, this is a lot and it's like, and it's gonna be here to stay? Probably, you know. Yeah. I mean definitely. I think it, I'm sure you have the say. It just gets a little overwhelming sometimes. Yeah. But, but yeah. I don't know. Yeah. 'cause I mean it's kind of crazy. No, it is crazy. Yeah. It's, and it's so different from how I like grew up and how everything that I saw when I was younger is so, it's just like a very different, it's an adjustment for sure. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people don't know you are fr You're from Huntsville. Alabama. Yeah. Since that rocket. You have like the most trajectory outta Huntsville. You think So? I think so. Since that, you know that rocket that's by the interstate. I know the rocket. Everybody knows the rocket.

I think we pulled over one time. That's The rocket. Yeah. Ville is kind of a cool place. You don't realize, I feel like it's the next Lexington kind of. You think so? Yeah. I think 'cause it's, there's a lot of odd diversity there. It's like I mean. I don't know. Would you think it was like growing up Did? you feel like It was definitely like Melting pot? Did you the sticks? No. Huntsville? No. I feel like that's a city. Yeah. But I did live in this place called Athens Alabama. And that was the sticks. Yeah. Yeah.

Alabama? Yeah. No ma'am. Don't go. What? Athens? The city of the county. State of Limestone County. That's where you're from. Limestone County. Yeah. Well I was born in Huntsville, but I lived here during like middle school and high school limestone. So formative years. Yeah. Very formative. you know, Did. you guys have like school dances and stuff over there? I, yeah. Yeah. I Think so. Did, you have the one where the girl has to ask the boy? No. Why would you think that? Because some schools have 'em. Like in the south they have Sadie Hawkins? Yeah. Oh My God. Yes. We had this. I went to that. But you're so right. Yeah. That's a really fun One. Yeah. Anything you wanna know about yourself? Just ask. I, but you had to ask a boy.


Yeah, I guess I did. Damn. Do you remember? Like, do you like We did have that. Oh my god, that has brought up so many memories. Oh yeah. 'cause the girl had to buy the shirt. Dude. And. I. Remember I'd be at school and it would be like the day the girl was gonna give you the shirt and you'd be Which shirt? Which shirt are you talking About? Oh. 'cause girls and boys had to have matching shirts for Sadie Hawkins dance. Oh, We had different city Hawkins. Oh really? What was yours? Like The girl, you had to get a matching shirt and the girl would buy it. But then you had to meet her at school and the day she would give you the shirt, you know, she'd call you the night before and she'd be like, my, my mom got a shirt. And you'd be like, all right. You don't know what the shirt is? No. And you're just nervous anyway. 'cause you're just kind of nervous to be around girls and it's like junior high or whatever.


And then she'd get, you'd like meet her for like a, and you'd get the shirt and you were just so nervous. I feel like. Were you like a nervous, were you nervous? like I in junior high and stuff? Like what were you like a Little bit maybe? I don't know. It depends on situation. I feel you. Like that's a scary situation right now. Yeah. Like do you remember the first time a guy had to like ask you to a dance or anything like that? I don't know. I didn't go to many dances. Really? Yeah. No. I wasn't much of a dancer. Well, yeah, I didn't go 'cause I was a no, No, you know, artist like, like a dancer. Like going, oh, You know, you know you didn't go. Okay. You. I think I went to one in like sixth grade or something. Okay. But yeah. Okay. So you're growing up around there. You're not dancing.


What are you doing over there? Did. you have a first job over there somewhere? No, I did. I did track though. I did cheer. You did Track? Yeah. What Did you do? Huh? I played basketball with a couple of brothers too. Bring it up again man. When you get it, you did track. 'cause track is sort of a, that's me right there. There. Damn. Wait, which one? His Pictures faded out over 34. Okay. Is really? Yeah. And I'll tell you this, Mr. Don on our team who was the same age as me, but people called him Mr. Don. He had two children. He was a power forward. Wow. How old were you? Probably High school.


You were 13 in high school? Yeah. Ball and sun. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. So what were you doing over there then? Just, yeah, sports. I don't know what Did you do when you were growing up. Yeah. I don't know either. I guess Just like the normal things. Yeah. Just Normal stuff, I guess. What would you guys do for fun in your town? Like in our town? Sometimes like when we got into high school, we would meet outside of the Michael's craft store parking lot. Yeah. And people would go do stuff. Okay. Yeah. So similar Walmart. Okay. Walmart. Really? Yeah. But I don't know. You didn't really wanna go there. Really? Yeah, I was like ratchet. Did y'all have like different parking lots for different like vibes? What?


Oh, like this parking lot? Is this vibe, this parking Lot? Like this one's rat? This one's, yeah. A hundred Percent. Okay. At our school we had this, it was called the hick tree. Prep tree. And then I guess a little bit more of like the urban tree kind of, you know? Okay. And that's where, yeah, people would like be like more beatboxing kind of stuff. Or people like, you know, siping, stuff like that. So those were the trees that we had kinda, Yeah. Okay. Trees. Yeah. And then parking lots. I don't think so. Really? Like we had to go into New Orleans. If. you really wanted to get ratchet? Kind of. Wait, where Are you from? I'm from Covington, Louisiana. Okay. Alright. So it's just like a pretty regular place. You're close to New Orleans. Maybe 45 minutes. Really? You go a lot.


Oh dude, we would go a lot. But the problem was that we'd go over there and get drunk and then somebody would have to drive home. Or who drove home, huh? Yeah. That's a great question. And that's what our parents asked every time we got back. Oh, it's Fucked up dude. Yeah, it was. It was bad. Dude. Fuck. I love that city In New Orleans. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. I've been like twice. Yeah. I wanna go back. Did, you go on tour. On was the first tour drowning was the tour? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But no, it's such a good one. Yeah. I watched a documentary about Katrina the other day. You did? And now I'm upset. Do you remember it? Yeah. Dude, my friend was a news reporter during Katrina. He lived in Baton Rouge. So they had to take him by helicopter every day into New Orleans and then helicopter him out. No way. So he'd be there like interviewing people that were like, he's like, where are you sleeping tonight?


They're like, we don't know. He is like, all right, I gotta get on this helicopter and leave. That's so sad. What? It was pretty sad. I kind of feel for him some what? But yeah, Katrina was pretty bunked. Dude, You remember it? Well, I don't remember it that well. But I do remember seeing photos they had like, 'cause the water was really high. There were photos where people had like gotten where like kind of swimming through the water and then they got hung up on a fence, like a regular hide fence. And then after the water went down, they found bodies just like, no. Hanging over the fence On the fences. Yeah. That's dark. I didn't see that in the documentary. It Was pretty dark. Yeah. Did y'all get bad weather Like that? I mean that's a bit much. And Oh, oh, You don't have to flash it like that.


I mean, yeah. I mean We can look, we can close our eyes if we want. But yeah, so stuff like that. Like people all over, this was another thing that happened that people don't realize. People would be like going, 'cause everywhere was covered in water. So people would be going through somebody's backyard. They had a swimming pool that people don't know while they're going through the water. No. Yeah. And Just, just down in, that's bad. Deep end, dude. That's scary. The whole city's a deep end. So yeah, that was kind of, I guess that was something. Did they have any tragedies in your area growing up? Are you guys like in the tornado belt or anything? Or headlights or anything? Oh, Definitely headlights. A hundred percent. But for tornadoes for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Some of my friends definitely got their roofs taken.


Oh Yeah. You, We had a lot of li, a lot of headlights. I think I grew up picking the headlights belt or whatever. And you'd see people itching all the time. You was serious. One kid. He was just itching so much at Christmas. I remember he couldn't even open his gifts 'cause he was just, no. Yeah, No, no. Yeah. No. Yeah, he get rid of it. I mean, I don't know. You should ask. I hope he's doing well. Yeah, I didn't get his name. And that's okay. you know, time passes and time heals. All wounds. You think you shave his head. Well, let's talk more about you. Okay. Because I don't know, I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. I know you've just had such an ascent. It's really like I. It's, it's rare, you know, I mean, you've just had such an ascent, you know, with your career.


What are, what are parts that are kind of scary right now? I think just decision making. I get really like scared making decisions. Yeah, Me too. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. That part overwhelms me a lot. And just knowing like what's the right decision to make and trying to learn all that probably. But, And is it decisions about like what, what song to do? Like maybe who to collaborate with? Like what kind of decisions you mean? Yeah, and how to like deal with certain things too. I think I'm learning and like I. Don't know. I feel like I'm also dealing with like, I've dealt with some like hate for the first time. And that's something I'm trying to like figure out. Yeah. Yeah. Because I got such a short temper. You do? Yeah. Damn. So I gotta figure out how to like navigate it. Was it with the co wetzel song, that kind of stuff?


Or just other Stuff? Yeah, I mean that's definitely, yeah, that was prominent. But Yeah. 'cause you had a song with co wetzel and people were upset. Why was it I, I couldn't even figure out kind of why they were upset. I Don't, I think just 'cause I was on the song. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, that's a bummer. Yeah, I thought it was really a gr I thought it was really awesome. Thank you. I appreciate that. I think they were just pissed that like, that's that it wasn't just him probably, you know, because you know, sometimes you just want a song and it's like, you just want that person. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But they were pissed. They were pissed. Damn. Maybe people were really, I got Dogged, Really dogged. Did anybody say a really good burn? And you were like, yeah, that does anybody, because sometimes you read a comment, you're like, that's so good.


Yeah. Yeah. I know. I don't know. I don't know. There was a lot of, there was a lot of shit. And would it just make you like kind of nervous about it or? No, it just made me mad. Oh, I see. Because like, nobody would say that to me in person. Yeah. It feels so personal. Yeah. you know, Did, you ever read your comments? Oh, I'll read stuff sometimes. Yeah. This guy looks homeless. How'd this guy get a home? That's fucked up. Yeah. Oh, at best. This guy looks like somebody that might have matches on him. That's what somebody wrote one Time. That's, that's bad. I don't know why, but that one feels really bad. So Yeah, sometimes you read stuff, it, it really, it really kind of, you feel kind of cooked by it and you can't write back.


'cause then you're in the tre, then you're in the bullshit. No you shouldn't. Yeah. You should never do you. Yes. Nuh. Do you really? Do You not? Hell no. You've never done it, ever. You never wanted to do it. Oh yeah. I've wanted to. Maybe you should Do it. Nah, I think you, you're bad. I can already tell you're a horrible influence. So, okay, so you're growing up in Huntsville and then how do things start kind of popping? You're doing music, you're running track and what's going on? You run by the music teacher and just hit some bars or what? No, I started like posting online and then it just kind of took off from there. Yeah. TikTok On TikTok. Yeah. Wow. So do you think that the, like now like people want to like, do most young people think I need to be good at music or I need to be good on social media?


I wonder. Whoa, That's a really good question. I don't know. Probably social media is their first thought. I think. Yeah, I don't know. That's a great question. I think it's kind of a joint effort though. Like, 'cause If you, the music is the first part I'd say actually. 'cause you gotta have something there I think. But then the next step is to make sure that can translate onto a screen. Yeah. And like in the beginning were you just kind of screwing around or what happened? I haven't seen your earliest TikToks. That's good. I, it's, yeah, I don't know. I was just sitting in my, like in my house in the basement And. I would just like film videos of me singing. I was like doing covers and shit. Oh nice. Yeah. And then one of those blew up and then it was right when Covid happened.


So then I was just stuck at home. So I just kept doing It. Just in the basement. Yes. Oh, and so you just, were you, at first you were just doing covers. Oh that's kind of perfect, huh? Yeah, it was a good start. And then Did, you start writing some like what was one of your first songs that you wrote? I don't even know. I, I've been writing since I was like 11. I just didn't post it when I was 11. Which is so good. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause Ima, I mean, yeah, I imagine that Right? Yeah. you know, even you get your, even it does well at 11 and then you're like, fuck, I'm 12 And, I have all this. It's a huge like If, you want to be able to really like have a career that's a such a long career to have to even get to 30, A hundred percent.


Yeah. Also. And then you look back and you're like things you say when you're 11. It's not how you feel when you're 12. Totally different. So different. Like, man I wish these girls would leave me alone. That's 11, right? And then 12 you're like, damn, where the hose is that it's so different. Some kids are And I don't Say that kind of stuff. Stuff. Oh well we don't to fuck. Is this an early one? No, This is the beginning And it's far down There. That was fast. Oh my god. A lot of these look like, wow. Missing person photos. This is So scary. You're just nightmare. I just scroll through really quick again. Like that a little bit. Oh. Oh. A lot of these look like you're fucked. Like Jesus. Wow. There's a lot. You Were so brave.


Thats a lot. No, and it was scary. 'cause people would like make fun of you at high school. Oh I'm sure. A crazy time for that to happen. Yeah. To put yourself out there like that. And then go to school like If, you have one that doesn't really pop. Yeah. And a bunch of them didn't pop before. One popped. Yeah. Yeah. Following one popped that next day. You were like, what's good? Oh yeah. Wow. It was so embarrassing. And you'd see the like where you can see that people would send something You know what I'm talking about? The little arrow. Oh yeah, the arrow. Yeah. That's the best marker. But when there's like three oh you're Like, fuck. And you know, it's just three first three people in your school would be like talking shit. Look what the fuck this chick's up to. Oh, oh bad. That didn't happen to you? No. 'cause we didn't have it. And so you were like If you, you would sing in front of your class, whatever.


And people were like, you suck or whatever. you know Did, you do that. No, I didn't. Can you sing? There's one video of me singing. The boys will find it. What did we have? Oh, I remember like talent show is where you got to do something. That's crazy dude. So we did, since we didn't have TikTok, we had an actual talent show where people had to do a talent like you. And that was your one chance If you wanted, you basically got one TikTok for the year. And it was live at night. It was, You only had one Of them. That was it. Because it was like, wow. You get up a talent show and that would be it. And people would just, the next day, people would be like, you suck Did. you sing at the talent show here. I'm singing right here. This Is me. This is you. It's a while back. Wow. Different haircut.


Yeah. Cool. We grew up in the church. You know me. There's no way. That's Not really me. Sorry. That's not you. Somebody made this incentive. Hell no. Because that's not you. That is You. No, that guy looks like mentally unwell. I mean, it looks like me, but that guy is not deal. That is, that's you. I pray one day that God turns me into that. Do you Have a cousin? I don't know. But if he is, I'm gonna take his life and his skills and I'm gonna become that Guy. You're related to him. I hope I am. Y'all are. Have you talked to your mom? Yeah. Not as much, but that's just our history. But okay, so you, so TikTok starts to happen.


You come outta the basement, you finally realize, yes, I'm doing well enough on TikTok, I can come outta the basement. Yes. And then how do you start to write like your first song? Like how does it evolve a little bit from there? Do you write your first song by yourself? Yes. I, I think I like something like made me so sad or mad or something. I think I went through a breakup or something. And. I just wanted that person to know how it felt so bad. So I would just like write a song and post it. And I'm like, well he's gonna see it. So that was, and You don't know That was my thought process. Yeah, because a lot of your stuff, it's like, dang, she is, A lot of your stuff gives me like bereaved, like revenge chick vibes, you know?


What Does bereaved mean? I don't know. I liked that word. A close relation of friend through their death. Oh, maybe I, oh, bereaved. Go down one more. To be deprived of a loved one through a profound absence. Fuck. That's sad. Wow. I'm gonna have to use this word more. Yeah. Because some of you put stuff in your, I'm like, God, who's she mad at? you know? Yeah. Or where's some of it has a little bit of revenge in it though. A hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. And it's kind of like, all right, interesting. It's The most motivating emotion I'd think. So. Do you think, Yeah, a hundred percent. What do you think? Right? What motivates you the most? That's a great question. Yeah.


Probably some spite. Probably Spite. Which is just, yeah, it's like Revenges Fancy cousin that wears a tie, I guess. A hundred percent. Yeah. What is it? Oh, proving something to people, Right? Spite. Yep. I'm telling you. Yeah. It's like, oh, I'll show these. And then I use, you know, things you don't say at church or say to your grandmother at your grandmother's house, you know? Exactly. So you start to write a song, right? You write your own songs. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I'll collaborate with people sometimes, but I always am a writer. Really? Yeah. So your first album was mostly your own? Yes. Wow. Yeah. Dude, it was so good. Thank you. Yeah. Damn. I mean, I feel weird as like a man saying that.


'cause I could almost feel like it's, I don't wanna say it's music for women. 'cause music can be for anybody. It can be for anybody. Yeah. Damn. Were you going through it? I don't probably, I've been going through it my whole life. So I think I could just, I was like, who the, what the fuck is going on here? And so yeah, there were so many things I was like, yeah, I just loved it. And, and it was kind of weird 'cause I would tell my buddies, I was like, have you heard this girl? And they're like, what the fuck are you talking about dude? you know, put some gure on bro or something, you know, put on something dangerous.

It was my first time like going on a plane other than for like cheerleading. Yeah. It was crazy. Fuck. It must have been so exciting, huh? It was so exciting. It was so exciting. And I was, I just remember being so like, oh my God, I wanna do this the rest of my life. I like fell in love with it. But yeah, I don't know. Everything just feels like a blur. Yeah. Like how, how do you feel when people ask you? Oh yeah. Now things certainly feel like a blur. Right? And then sometimes you can't even remember what you were doing. It's like I don't even know you're right. You Just, somehow I got where you are. Yeah. you know? Yeah. like I kept, I've always kept working. I've just kept going forward.


Exactly. You just have to keep doing it I think. Yeah. So yeah. So maybe we don't even have to learn about all that stuff about you. you know? I was just, here we are. What do you have like a pre-show routine then that you do? Like? Tell me about it. Take me through some of that. Okay. Pre-show. What I do, I'll have a Red Bull every time And I put on lately.

The last song I play before I go on and yeah, that's really all I do. It's not too complicated. That's it. Yeah. And what's in your green room kind? You have some candles in there. What do you got?


I try to have some candles in there. Like a good vanilla one. I like. Like something really sweet. Probably Like a 'cause. Yeah. Something that reminds you of like a car freshener. You can tell you grew up poor if your candles match your car freshener smells I Think. Damn, that's fucked up. That's so true. True. Damn. Yeah. I actually, I realized that a lot. And light up that new car smell candle, you know? I get it though. Yeah. Bath and Body Works. Oh God, dude, you go there. No, but I used to go there to get like presents for your girlfriend or something. You have to go in there. It's a good place. And it was so embarrassing. Some lady comes over in an apron and she's like, how can I help you? you know? Like I'm in love with somebody. I gotta prove it to him.


you know? I need a damn scent. That expresses my fucking feelings lady. How many times Did you go there, you think? Probably three or four times for girls. you Know, girls the same girl? Yeah. Probably two different girls maybe. Damn. But Was what it was. I got in there and got out, you know? Have did what? I had to. Did the trick though. Huh? It did the trick though. Did the trick every time it's gonna work. Yeah. My first girlfriend was kind of like a, she was like pretty masculine I guess. And she would, the school bus would come and my brother's friend, it would pick them up first. So they'd already be on the bus and she would pick me up and gimme a kiss. Goodbye. Go School. Wow. Wow. How old were we? She played second base. We were seventh grade. I don't know what grade she was.


She might have been 40 years old. But she would fucking, I remember And they would, you could hear them. The windows of me up. 'cause the driver would get mad, put 'em down. You could hear them howling through the bus windows. No. Oh. What was her name? I don't wanna say it because I'm sure she's a beautiful, be like I. I think she just, you know, some people, she's a late bloomer, you know? No, I actually feel like girls probably like mature faster at that age. Oh, she, she was, but she was just Tall. She mature. Dude, she was tall. She played second base. Yeah. Come on dude. This is a lot. Damn. That's a weird image in my head right now. This is a Lot. And. I didn't hold onto that gate or whatever. She was real, she held me up dude. I didn't have AdChoices.


She played second base I think on the, For what sport? I don't know. Hopefully not baseball. But all I'm saying is was she was a tough gal. And. I was just glad that we had each other for the time that we did. And that's the one you got Bath and Body Works for. Yeah. I remember getting her something and she wanted like a lot of like Atlanta Braves, like baseball gear and stuff like that. So she did play baseball. Yeah. She really Did. you had it right the first time she Played. Yeah, she played a woman's baseball. Anyway. Yeah. I'm trying to think, what do I have in there? So I'll have like a yoga mat. Oh yeah, they're sexy right there. Bring her up. Wow. That was a good one. Yeah, That was fun. Dude. She's so good. And I Just got And I. I walked in this If you're on, if you're listening on audio.


It's just a picture of me and Sexy Red. And then there's, I have this suicide boys shirt on. And I just gotten that. There was a room next door I was asking. I was like, you guys know where there's clothing shop? And they're like, they, the people right next door have a bunch of clothes. And I just walked in there and they had that shirt Like right next door to you Of Suicide Boys. You ever heard of them? Of Course I've heard of them. Yeah. I just found a song that I really liked by them. Is it called Dust Dustin A Vase or No? Is that one good? Yeah. I, I only know one song really? And I. Love it. Maybe I should dive in. Are The Roses. I'm trying to think of the one I like. But Sexy was cool man. And yeah, I tried to invite her out to do something, but she got pregnant. Damn. Which is kinda the Same thing because a lot of women are like, I, can I have to wash my hair?


But she's like, Hey, I got pregnant. Yeah. Yeah. That's one hell of an excuse. It's so And. I know. I was like, I even asked my buddy, I was like, you don't think she got pregnant? Just so she didn't have to go out with me. He's like, you think someone would get pregnant? 'cause she doesn't wanna out with you, dude. That's, you're an idiot. I mean, that's commitment though. That is Commitment. That's some real like people pleasing shit right there. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway. Oh, and then, so yeah, before my show, what will I do? Yoga for like 34 minutes. Really? Actually. Yeah. Yep. A hundred Percent. Like regular yoga, hot yoga. I do yoga with Adrian. It's just on the computer. Okay. And I'll put my yoga mat in my green room and then I will have like a couple sips out of a coffee and I'll listen to some FGL or some Booy and or maybe some Morgan.


And then I'll go out there. Okay. I like this routine. Yeah. The yoga's good. Yoga makes you feel good. It's actually, how long have you been doing it? Mm, I've been doing it for maybe six years. Wow. So I do it probably three times a week right now. But it's just makes you feel, I don't know, it makes me feel pretty alive, I guess. You Do like complicated yoga? Hell no, dude. You said Six years. You should be like bird or Bald eagle or whatever that stuff is. Or Damn, you know the names for all of them. Whatever that other one is. Hurt Camel or something. I don't do any of that. What is that? I Don't know. What does that one look like? I? Haven't heard of that one. You gotta be a woman to be able to do that one, I think. But it's, yeah, I think there's just a lot. A lot of different ones. So you've gotta do some cool collabs yo, right?


Yeah. Some great collabs. Pretty crazy. Jelly Roll called you his little sister. What is it? What did he say? Yeah, you talked with him, didn't he? Yeah. Yeah. Good guy. I love Jelly Roll. I mean, who doesn't? No, He's the best dude I've ever met. I know. Such a great man. Almost just there were more of 'em. Or if they just turned him into two E Claire's. No, but now you gotta have Jelly Roll. Jelly roll's too. Good. When you guys made this video, wild ones, this was, 'cause this whole thing's just like, it's not one shot, was it? How long Did you guys, how many times Did you guys do it? I don't Dunno. you know, it's fucked up. I don't know if, Were you really there? No, that to me I was there, but I don't think, I don't know if I've watched the full video.


I don't like to watch them back. Really? Yeah. No. It freaks me out. I don't like to watch it. Yeah. Why Fuck is that bad? I should start watching the whole video. No, I I I don't listen to my podcast. Really? No, no. That'd be weird. Yeah. And you would just be sitting there forever. And then if people see you listening to it, fuck. Sometimes I'll feel bad, like I'm in the airport editing it or something and, and I'll see someone if they see my computer and like, oh God. It's sad. The old listening to own podcast. You think so? Makes me feel sad sometimes, but Right. I feel weird. It's like, it's not my business to be watching it. That's a good point. Right. It's your business to be making it that day. Exactly. Yeah. So like, yeah. What are some collaborations?


'cause like, so collaborations so far you've had Co Jelly Roll Diplo, polo G Diplo, polo G, Marin, Morris, Marin Morris. That's, That's a lot. That's it. People love collabs. I feel like I, I'm a collab. Really? I Love Collabs. Yeah. Yeah. Do you prefer if it's with a male or woman? I've only done one with a girl, but I think I'd like to do more. Yeah. It depends on the song, you know. Yeah. You gotta, you gotta pick and choose wisely, you know? And is that kind of the hard part? Like, so do somebody pitch you a collaborator first? Or, and then they pitch you a song? Or how does that work? Or do they pitch both of you guys a song at the same time? Well, since I write my stuff, it's like I'll make a song And.


I always make it just for me. I never like make it thinking about like, this is gonna be a collab. Right. So I'll make it and then I'll just have to delete my second verse. Oh. And let them put something in. 'cause they have to get to write their own stuff, huh? Yeah, Most of the time. Yeah. Especially if it's a guy. 'cause like the perspective's normally different, you feel me? Yeah. Who would you collab with? If. you were a singer. Oh wow. Would You be a singer or would you be like a rapper? Oh, I hope you're gonna say dancer, but I'll, oh, I don't know about a rapper. If, you had to start a music career right now. You know what I would be. I would think I would be like a country DJ kind of. Okay. That's fire. Because I don't think there are enough of those.


Right. Well I hate is you go to EDM Club or something like that. Yeah. You go to like a, you know, even in Vegas you got some of the night clubs. A lot of times it's like, you know, it's Dip Load, John Summit, Chainsmokers, all good stuff. Right? Love, fun to go to, fun to listen to. But they never have like that a DJ that's kind of like a country dj, but the same place. I feel like If, you did like a country DJ in some of those places. It would like, people would love that too. You Got a point. you know? I really feel like there aren't enough of those. It's crazy. What are you doing? Side hustle. Well then I just think people would, I think people would be like, what the fuck is this dude doing? And if it was bad, it's like I'm already doing one thing, but if I could do something, oh, I know what, I would be a Christmas singer.


You think So? And you only sing a Christmas like Caroler Carol? Yeah. Maybe be that way. I only work one month out of the year show. And when they know when I show up as business. No, not a Caroler dude. I'm not going do Door. What is A Christmas singer? What do You mean? A Christmas singer is a dang, okay. A good person that sings Christmas and sings about Christmas Boy. Like be ringing. That kind of stuff. That Was, you don't fucking lie to me. That guy was you. That Was you. That guy is a pervert Man. You sing just like him. No, that guy's a Pentecostal. And. I. And that guy's been through a lot. I feel like You're, you're fucking with me right now. I No, that's a great, but that guy's had a lot of tough times in his life. Pen. Yeah, I would think. Yeah, I would probably be Oh, oh Jazz.


Maybe something like that. Like Michael Buble. Yeah. Yeah. And. I would have like a cool name too. What Would it be? You could have your name. I feel like Theovon maybe I'd be like, oh, I'd have like a name like mystery or something. Like a stripper's name. But for a Man. So like what? So like Mystery would be my name. That's good Mystery Jackson. But it's for Christmas. Yeah. I like it. And it would be called Mystery Toe. Like missile toe kind. That's good. You've already thought this out. You've already thought it out. This is all horrible. We're supposed to be talking about you, Jesse. So what else can we talk about here then? So you have, you have a new album that's coming out? Yes, I do.


I do have a new album that's coming out. And It's called You have, you have Vengeance towards Men. Huh? Not all of 'em. Really? Yeah. But there's a couple that really must have just, Yeah. I mean, somebody had to do it. Yeah. Somebody had to Somebody. Yeah. Somebody always has to break our heart. Huh? Damn, that happened to you? Oh, I think it's happened to everybody. I think it's one reason why so many people can like relate to all types of things. Probably. It's kind of crazy that we break each other's hearts, you know? I know. And it's common. Yeah. And it does happen to everybody. Dude, it's so crazy because like how you feel your heart, it's pretty important. And then you fricking, you're like, here you go.


And then everything is good for a little while and then we let each other down, you know? Yeah. Fuck. I know you're right. When Did, you get your heart broken. You think even a timeline. We don't need names. I don't think it was really a, I mean, things happen and you like go through things and you see things And. I think it's more, with this album specifically, I think it's more of like a buildup of things. Like something set me off and then it just made me think about everything else. And I was just fucking angry. And then that's, yeah. And when you get angry, what do you, do? You go to a shooting range or anything like that? That's exactly what I do. No, I'm just kidding. Oh, I've never done it. But I wanna try shooting range.


Yeah. Do you go, I took a date one time to a shooting range. It's an interesting place to do that. It was. And it wasn't. Here's what I realized. As I get there, I'm almost trying to be cool and stuff up front at the counter or whatever. And we checked out a couple guns. Dude, you can check out guns. And then here's the crazy part. The guy was like, all right, just here's your guns. Go in there, booth four or whatever. And the guns were just sitting there. And. I was like, are you gonna bring the guns in there for us? And he is like, nah, you guys bring 'em in. And he put 'em just like in this little like, kind of like a bin they would give you at the airport or whatever. So I'm like carrying these two guns in there. And the girl's like, this is cool. This is fun. And then I didn't know what to do. No one had ever taught me how to use a gun or anything. They didn't teach you?


Huh? They didn't teach you? No. They asked you if you know And you lied. Yeah. Why would you lie about that? That's a fucking crazy Thing to lie about. Well, I had to impress this chick, bro. And so I'm in there and And I was like, oh, use yours first. Right. Did She know? She didn't. Apparently she didn't know either so Well that you're so fine. Well, yeah, but she should know, dude, you know? 'cause women need to be able to defend themselves or whatever. And so I was like, use your gun. And she's like, I, don't know how to use a gun. And I. And then I realized like, oh shit, I don't know how to use, use a gun. And so I picked it up and then I realized you're in there and there's other people you could shoot. Anybody If you Want. I've never been in, what does it look like? It's like, yeah, Did, You really?


Oh, a hundred percent. There's no like walls. Oh, there's wall. But like you're facing your target and there's a wall on the side of you. But right around the edge of the wall is just the next person shooting. Really? So you could literally like If, you hated somebody. You could just shoot over that way. You think that happens a lot? I I, you Think that's a common thing? I don't know, but I just hope it doesn't, I was amazed they gave us these guns. So then I said, look, I'm gonna be honest with you. Let's go back to the front to talk to the guy. I said, I think these Guns are, you use a double back. That's bad. So, So sad. I said, I think these guns are broken. That's what I told. That's what you said. And so we went back and like he gave us some kind of like easier guns to use or whatever.


And it was pretty fun. So you just picked some complicated. I picked like some sig, some sa Sig Sig. What's a gun called? Sig Sig. Bring it up. Sig Saar. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. It was just, it was fine, but it was just a lot. But after that I learned how to use a firearm they call it. And now you know. Yeah. And you could do it at any time. Yeah. And I live in Tennessee. It's a state where you can, Damn. You live there, you Can do what you gotta do. Yeah. Live in Nashville. You Can. Damn. Really? Yeah. I used to live there. You did? Good place. Do you miss it or not? I do. I just moved like two weeks ago. Where'd you move to?


La Santa Monica. Yeah. No way. You're by the beach, yo. Damn. I really like it. Yeah. But I do Miss Nashville. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's such a different world. It's so different. Yeah. I mean, Nashville's so quiet. You think so? I think so. I don't think so. Really? I think it's loud. I Mean, depends on where you live though. Yeah. I mean, I just live in kind of like a regular neighborhood, I guess. You're in the suburbs? Nah. Okay. I'm in the city. Okay. I would get out in the suburbs. I've been looking at some houses, but I've just been torn so much. And here sometimes that I'm like, if I bought a different out, I wouldn't even be able to be there to live in it. Yeah. I feel, you know. you know, I feel you so heavily. Yeah.


So Dirty, that's the new single off of the album. Yeah. And the album's called, if These Men Come Around, I'm gonna Kill 'em. What's it called again? Exactly what it's called. Okay. Okay. Damn. Somehow is almost even worse. You'd almost rather have somebody shoot you than to say you are the devil. you Know? Dam, you think that's really bad? What to shoot somebody? Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. That's bad, right? Yeah, Yeah. The name of the album. Yeah, I think it's bad. Yeah, no, I think it's good. That's good. I think it fits you. You actually makes me really happy that you think it's bad, right? I haven't really told it to any like men yet. Really? Yeah. But I love your reaction though. Thanks. It makes me feel good. Damn. Yeah, you are.

It sounds like he has a thousand years just trapped inside of him. That's A great way to describe it. I like that a lot actually. Yeah. Like somebody Just screaming through a fucking wishing well of beauty. A Hundred percent. Yeah. It just sounds like he's like hurting. Yeah, it's like, It's Chris Stapleton e. Wow. It is, huh? Yeah, right. I'd say so. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. It's Chris Stapleton e dude. I went and saw John Mayer recently. I went and saw the Grateful Dead and Company and John Mayers plays with them and sometimes he'll hit a note and it feels like he's like trying to find like the exact note that will like take us all to like the end of time or something.


I feel like he's specifically good at that. Yeah. He's just Like's, just rides at Exactly what he does. He's just such a crazy boy. And then these, here's a couple of Vettes right here. Bring them up. And this is Jan Ma. Damn. This fucking kid is ripping bro. Wow. Full allowance this week. Been through a break. God. Yeah. Yes. Look at his face.

I'm gonna take you there. Okay. So first and foremost, the Teddy collab. I had this song Dirty that I made probably about a year ago today. And I posted it and it went viral. And I was just about to drop it.


And then Drake text me, he slides into my dms. Damn. And he was like, you trying to let me get on Dirty? Really? Is that a Euphemism? Yeah. What does that Mean? I don't know. I don't know what he's into. What do you mean? Like, what was he saying? Was he flirting, you think? Or he was asking about music? No, it's about music. Okay. And I was so excited. 'cause I love Drake. Big Drake fan. I think he's incredible. Yeah. So that happened. And. I was kind of just like waiting on that and it was like some back and forth and then it just end up like not working. It disappeared. Yeah. It just didn't, it didn't happen. Wow. That had to be fricking amazing. Were you scared to write back how long after you saw his message?


This is the question. How long after you saw, okay, Drake sent you a fricking message and you're like, how long you wait to even open it? I don't know. I don't, I was definitely freaking out. He's one of my like favorite, like, just like songwriters in general. Oh yeah. It's if somebody from the Bible sent you a message or something. He's so, he's so good. Yeah. But I don't, yeah, no, I was definitely freaked. I was like, what do I, how do you do that? What Do I do? What do I even wear? Something nice to text him, to message Him back. Is that how you Felt? I mean, I, I was like a little like I, don't know what to, I didn't know what I thought. Yeah. I was like, Hey, I definitely asked a couple people. I was kind of I know a hundred percent. Yeah. You have to Like, what do you say to Yeah, No, a hundred percent.


And so then you wrote 'em back? No, I did write 'em back. But anyways, it didn't happen. But it made me realize that I did want, I wanted somebody on the song. Oh. I wanted it to be two people. And I was like, fuck. Well who should it be? Who could it be? Who would, Even though you'd just written it for you. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's cool though. I just wanted it, you know. Yeah, no, it made me, he really made me realize like the song would be sick as a collab. So I was like, who, who should do it? So I asked my fans, I just like asked TikTok and they were like, I got an overwhelming response of Teddy swims. Really? And once I saw that, I was like, oh my God. A fucking course dude. It's crazy. So I hit him up and he like did a verse and it, it's incredible.


So that's how that happened. And then I also have a club with No way. Really? Yeah, Bro, his energy is, his energy is strong. Strong. He brings energy, man. That guy is so, he's his own fucking thing. He's like almost like a, somebody cut a power cable and it's just fucking that one that's just like that on the street. you know?

He came on the podcast. Yeah, And I just saw like his videos. And people would tag me in him and be like, oh Theo, this looks like you when you were a kid. Or, this reminds me of you. And so then next thing you know, like he showed up and we had, we went for a ride. I got a cyber truck. He, we went for a ride in it and just ridiculous, you know? And we got to listen to like his first new song. Yeah. He's So, he's such a sweet kid. He is. He's always like, so just, oh, that's his mom right there too. She's pretty vibe. But she's married. But yeah, that was him, man. We had a nice time. But yeah, that's one thing. It's like, oh, you can hear a lot of, yeah, you can just hear like a lot of new artists, people can break through really quick.


A hundred percent. Like that situation is crazy. He's so young. I know. What is he like? He's like 13. Yeah. I mean that would be so scary. That's a crazy age. Because then it's like I don't think you develop any of your own like thoughts or real like, or not thoughts, but Yeah, no, He's a fucking adolescent or whatever it's called. A hundred percent. And he's also gonna, he's gonna be so massive. Yeah. It's like people compare him to Justin Bieber all the time, You know? A hundred percent. So That's also tough because you're like, how does he just be himself? He seems to be good at it though. Yeah, I, I really do feel like he's like made for it. You know what? That's kind of funny. He, yeah, he kind of just acts already like he's a star. He does. Yeah. He just has that about him. He just fits in. Like it's okay with him. He doesn't even second guess it. No. Yeah. That's also a thing of being so young though. I don't think it's like, it registers really.


Yeah, like he doesn't really, he probably doesn't really like, it doesn't feel like it's crazy just 'cause you're young, I feel like. Right. 'cause also I think at that age you feel like almost all kids probably feel like a star anyway. 'cause you're like just that vibrant, crazy energy. you know? It's just that age. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So he's just like, nah, but he's, he's great dude. Yeah. That was pretty cool. I'm trying to think of who else I that I'll follow or listen to. Yeah. Who do, who's your like favorite artist? Who do You listen to right now? I listen to Red Clay Strays so much. Have you heard of them? Yo. So fucking good. She comes from S Golden Wow Rabbit School. I know that was you. I fucking know it was was You. Yeah. They God, they're good dude. And they have After When I'm leaving Stage, that's a song that we play all the time.


They got that song. That's Your walkout track. Just Wanna be loved. They remind me of like The Beatles. They remind me of Aerosmith a little bit. My walkout track on, yeah. When I'm leaving. I can't remember what it's called. I love You. Love them. They're so good. God, they're so good. They're from down near you. They're from Mobile. Really? No, I didn't even know that. That Checks out. They're from Mobile. That really checks out. I met you like two years ago. Yeah. We met at your agent's house. A and r. A and R. Yep. And your brother was there. Your brother writes with you, is that right? Yeah, he tours with me. He tours with You Guitar. He's he's a guitarist. Yeah. Nice.


Yep. So was he like part of some of your, like how did that Did, you have to incorporate him? Did he have to audition or It was just like, it's a two person deal. It's a two piece. We Always just kind of like played together. Like he's always just been obsessed with guitar. And he writes too. He's incredible. But just growing up, that's just what we did. So it just felt natural, I feel like, and it's so nice to have him on the road. Is it? Yeah. you know why? 'cause you get to do things together. Yeah. Just like also a sense of like home and family. Yeah. Yeah. He's a, he's a real, real country dude. Are you guys pretty close? Yeah, I'd say so. You have siblings? Yeah. I got three siblings. They're pretty good.


My sister's a nurse now. Damn. Wow. And I'm like, Jesus dude. I would not let her go near me. Why Annie? I just, I couldn't imagine. She's like, if I pulled up, I was like hurt or something. She's like, I'm gonna help you. I'll be like, get the fuck away from me. You really, I mean, I think she's probably educated, you know, she knows what she's doing, but I wouldn't let her, she got To, And she can prescribe pills and stuff now. Damn. So I mean, We'll see what happens. Okay. So what else on the album? And then how far after do you tour? Like, do you have a release strategy? Like do you start to strategize more these days with social media? Or do you feel like you do things kind of whimsical or, or is it like, do you have like almost a calendar where you know when you're gonna put out what I feel like, yeah.


No, we're strategizing is a big part of it. That's another part that really overwhelms me. I don't, I don't wanna do that. I just wanna like put out the music and then step away. You always seem very, like on your socials, it always seems like super just you kind of having a good time. Like just, you know, singing some of the bars of the songs and that's it. you know, it just feels, it feels like you just at home just doing whatever you want, you know? Yeah. That's how I'd like to keep it. But you do have to like think about when you're gonna do this and when you're gonna do that and why you're doing, you know? Yeah. But I hate that stuff. It really freaks me out. Yeah. Yeah. Anything that's too planned freaks me out I think. Oh Yeah. You know. Oh yeah. Well once you start And I, start noticing too.


It's like, well let's do this and do the edit. And it's the second you start to feel that it's becoming too edited. I can already tell it's not gonna be good A hundred Percent or it's not gonna be real, you know. Ah, That's a great, yeah, no.

So now you're living in la? Yeah. Wow. I know. I never thought I was gonna move. Ever. Ever. Really? Yeah. 'cause I love this From where you moved from Nashville to la. Yeah. I just loved this house so much. Yeah. And. I. I don't know. I was never like a big fan of la honestly. Yeah. But now I'm here. And how Did you, and first you moved to Athens to Nashville, Athens, Huntsville to Athens, to Athens, to Huntsville, to Nashville to la. Okay. And why'd you move out of Athens? It was just really, like I said, I went to middle school and high school there and it was really, really small and super conservative. Like, so conservative. Really? It's in the Bible belt. Like Heavy Bible belt.


And, I. Like Were you with the church? Yeah. I like sang at church for a little bit, but I, I cuss a lot in my songs and shit. And that was like a really big, big deal there. Yeah. Especially when me doing cheer was like really serious. They would like make me like run laps. If I like posted something and there was a cuss word in it, I would've to like run miles for every cuss word Really? At school? Yeah. Public school too, which is just fucked. Which, but then like, Like another lap. The guys could do it. Which is fucked. Oh yeah. Most of the guys are allowed to curse in the south. But women are mostly for more for pregnancy, you know?


No, a hundred percent. Yeah, that's exactly what they were trying to say. Pregnancy and recipes. That's like the, those were like used to be the big women thing, you know? A Hundred percent. Yeah. Did, you have the baby class at high school. The men didn't have to do it. We had to do wood shop or whatever. Really? Yeah. But the girls had a baby class. The girls had a baby class. Is that everywhere? Babies. And then I think the second semester was, I wanna say omelets. No. Or breakfast? Babies. And breakfast. Are you serious? Yeah. That's the class. I mean, Look dude, that Feels fucked. That's how you keep a family together. Guys couldn't take it. Babies or breakfast. Some guys took it. You were allowed to take it.


Yeah, some guys did. Let's see, home economics courses often used this of learning how to cook, how to do taxes, and how to perform childcare tasks. That's fair. That's fair. But yeah, I feel like guys should do that too though. No. Yeah. Some guy. Yeah, some. We had wood shop. You had to learn how to build a bird house. That's how to build a how to like de hoof a horse or whatever. A couple different stuff we had to learn. You Really had to learn how to do that. Yeah. That's some Kentucky stuff, right? They had a Ferrier come and he would show us how to do the thing. Have you ever had to do it? I'm like, dude, I don't even, I'm fucking, I can barely like a, like we, we get one pair of Rebox a year. Dude, if I do this to my shoes, mom's gonna, fucking mom's gonna drive over my legs with her car. Dude. God.


How often do you think people use that stuff? Do you ever think about that? How? Like you're never really using anything you learned in school. Oh yeah. What are you using? I think the stuff we should teach kids is like, Hey, how do you be nice to somebody else? How do you recognize maybe if somebody else is having a tough day? Like Emotional intelligence. Yeah. It's, and it's so, it's scarce. You don't even realize how scarce it is. Emotional intelligence. Fuck yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent. Especially I think with my generation. Really? Yeah, a hundred percent. There's just like a lack of like depth. Is there really? Do you feel like less of an interaction in your generation? Fuck yeah. I mean, for everybody right now though, And, I think just because of like, I mean it's because of social media.


But like, it's weird 'cause we're so connected, but we're so disconnected. Yeah. Young adulthood is no longer one of life's happiest times. People are sad. People are really sad. That's Why though. I wonder. Yeah. Why do you notice? 'cause you have a lot of fans that are kind of like, you know, you do touch on that space of like, I wanna feel something, you know? Right. Yeah. No, I don't know why I, I do think it's because of like, you're spending hours a day, like on a phone and you're seeing all these things and it's, you're not meant to see that much I don't think. As a human. Yeah. And you see it and you're like, then your brain's just going crazy. And then you compare yourself to every, Oh, that's the truth. You know? Everybody does it. I think even adults do that now.


Mm. But it's, I think it's really damaging for people. Like in high school and middle school. Well, you compare yourself so much. And here's one thing I realized. It's like, you may love somebody, right? But then If, you see a thousand pictures of other that are not even real. Like they've been adjusted or filtered. Then you see those, then you're gonna think, oh this that you can't help but feel some attraction to some of It. Really? You think so? I think sometimes it's hard because here the felon isn't playing fair. It's like if there's filters and stuff that's not even the real person or the lighting isn't real. You're getting tricked. Right? You're getting tricked. But we're all getting tricked into thinking that there's something better out there that's Fucked up.


And relationships. It's fucked up too. Yeah. you know how many like relationships end? Probably because of that. So many. Snapchat, you know how many relationships end because of Snapchat? You got Snapchat. I have Snapchat. I don't know. I don't use it. Don't use it. I do not use it. It's not good for you. I ain't use it. Don't even do it, don't it? I'll never use it. Don't even do It. I wouldn't, don't Don't. Well I will not. Yeah. But I don't even know. Yeah, people are, and sometimes now, a couple years ago, I would look at Snapchat, but sometimes you would open it up and you would, there would just be like a dang coer or something in there and You're like, that happens to you. Yeah. That's such a thing. You'd Be like, what is going on Unsolicited? Yes. And you're like, where is what is happening?


Or something. And it would be like, come to Memphis or Something. Somebody, somebody you don't know. You'd be like, dear your god, These are your friends on Snapchat. I Dunno who these people are. Well that's a crazy thing on Snapchat is it's just Nate, you have no idea who the fucking person is. What are You talking about? You should, it should be your friends. You probably added them. Oh yeah. Then I don't know how I got, I, I don't know because there's like 70 people that can send me stuff. And, I. Don't know any of 'em. And I. Don't know how they're able to yet. How Did you get them on there. Maybe when I first started, I might have hit the wrong button To where you can allow anything. That's how you get unsolicited dick pics. Really? Yes. Well, I don't get any dick pics actually, dude, there. I have gotten a couple of, I know you've gotten one. There's some guys from Scotland who are always doing blow and sending dick pics to me. But It's just Scotland guys.


Yeah. That's really niche. They either sound Scottish or they've done so much blow. They just can't speak. There's audio. Yeah, there's audio too. On the dick Pics. What are you talking about? Yeah, dude. You think I want a dick pic with no audio? Dude. Whatcha talking? What? What are just a silent, weirder? What are they saying? What are they saying? Sometimes it's like, you'll hear 'em like doing like little football chants or just talking in Scottish. You're getting videos. Yeah. Wiener vs. Or Whatever. That feels much worse. Well, it's more cinema cinematography, I feel like. Cinematic. Yeah. Just a pictures like, oh, anybody could do that. At least these guys are like, they're Putting some work in It feels like a And they thought about you. Yeah. They really thought about you. Alright. I don't wanna think about it anymore. you know? I'm 40 days off pornography right now, so. Wow, that's good.


I feel pretty hype about that actually. I feel pretty good about it. Do you think you will go to college? You didn't go to college? I didn't. You Didn't? No, but I've been thinking about it. Have you? No. Fuck no. I'm Like, Mabu. Would you go like him? I'm never going to college, but sometimes I do wanna go because lately I've, like, when I was in high school, I never, I hated that shit. And. I didn't wanna learn anything. But now I feel like I don't know if it's my age or what, but I just wanna learn so much. Yeah. I'm, I'm trying to, I wanna like force myself to read boring books because I just wanna know more. Yeah. you know? But I don't, you can, I used to wanna go to Harvard. Really? Yeah. So you had dreams like that? I wanted to go. I just wanted to go. 'cause I knew it was like the craziest One.


Like what do you mean go like, just go there, eat in the student union or something. Or you wanted to go to school there? I wanted to go and be a lawyer, which I would've been a fucking terrible lawyer. I don't know. I hate confrontation. Do you, I do Some of your, I don't know, some of your energy. I feel like you want the con you want you, you No, I do. You're there for It. That, that's the weird thing. It's like the songs are like the part of me that, that I'm not, I'm not a fighter, but in my songs, I'm a fighter. Yeah. You feel me? Yeah. But I, yeah, no, it's like my alter. It's like what I, you know. Yeah. That's a good point. Sometimes we create. Yeah. Yeah. I think when I'm, I don't feel as confident off a stage as that I do when I'm on stage.


Right. I never even thought about that till just now. It's just Like, what? You gotta get out, you know? Yeah. Without it, I might be a fighter, you know? I could see you doing UFC or something. You think so? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Dude. Have you ever done that? Have you gone? I've gone. You never gone? I, No. I wanna go really bad. Really? So bad. I'll, I'll, yeah, I'll, I'll see if I can help you out. Please do. I really wanna see it. You would fucking love it then, dude. You think so? Yeah. Are you kidding me? Find a fighter to walk out to one of your songs, to one of those bad bitches that are in the league. Is it? Oh wow. You've watched women too? I Watched a woman punch a tit off another woman. No. Yeah. Where'd it go? Huh? No, that didn't Happen. And If, you catch it, you win like a hat or something?


That like a, a extra large shirt? No, I didn't see that. I have seen, oh, a woman punched a woman's fricking eyelash off the other night in Denver. She had fake eyelashes on. Yeah. That's crazy. Crazy to wear that into the rings. Crazy, Crazy place to do that. She looked good though. She had makeup on Right here. Oh, watch this. No. Yeah. No, no, don't do that. You gotta Use a stronger glue. What's the, what Gluer women using on that? God damn. Fuck. No. you know what You know what I think. Hmm. Do you know what eyelash extensions are? you know exactly what they are? Yeah. It's like a fake eyelash. You glue it on, huh?


No, but the ones that they do, like, they'll go in there with like tongs and they'll do 'em individually with like serious glue. And. I. Hope that wasn't that because if it was her real eyelashes got Came out with it. Mm. Look at how red it is. Yeah. Because I don't think she's gluing strip lash. Ooh. Ooh. Look. You can see it leaving right there. No. Oh my god. Theo. I think that was an extension. Oh, That girl lost her eyelashes. Yeah. It's just that time of year. Oh my god. I gotta go see that. Yeah. You think there's one tomorrow? No, no, no. They have 'em on Saturdays Every Saturday. Yep. you know what though? I will make sure you get to one.


Please do. I'd be forever grateful. It's so Much fun. Really? You're right there by the cage. Yeah, dude. You're right there by the cage. Is it? Is That fucked up that we like to watch that as humans? No, Because I think it goes back, I think at first it is fucked up. But then you have to recognize that these guys are fighters and they love doing it. It's like, yes, they wanna beat each other up, but they also want to show their skill and craft. Right. They wanna be seen. Right. Just like a singer. Just like anything. Right. A stripper. Anything. Anything. It's like I wanna put myself out there. So I think I used to sit there and kind of feel bad, but now I realize I just have maximum respect for both of the men or women that are in there. Because they're doing exactly what they wanna do. Yeah. Here they put it back on, I guess.


Or they took the other one off. Yeah, it's no, the one on the, her right eye is still on and you can see it's gone on the That. It looks like they're gone though. Yeah. That's bad. Mm. Do you party? You drink? I do. I dabble. I used to a lot more than I do now. Really? Why? I, well, high school like 17 was just rough for me. And, I think I like did that to like cope with shit, which is not great. But the older I got, the more I just realized how bad it makes you feel. Yeah. like I can't tour and drink a lot anymore because it just wrecks me. Yeah. I get sick so fast. Oh, you have to take care of yourself so much when you tour.


It's crazy. It's actually crazy. That's why like the other day, people were rip or you know, Morgan. Wallen canceled a show was in Tampa, Did, you see this and Jelly Roll like went and did a show, which I thought was really sweet to try to be helpful. But also it's like, and people were like, fuck him or what? you know? But it's like, it's so hard. And he's been touring for ever three years. Like ever Straight. Just straight. Right. I mean, I think he's had maybe a couple months off here and there, but not a long time. I mean, I was shocked. Remember he was touring off their first album and then he put out the double out. Remember that? Yeah. No, he just hasn't stopped touring. So I can only fathom that he's pretty burn at at certain moments, you know?


And then they showed him the night before. It's raining. Really? He's singing and Steam is coming up for, it was like a hundred degrees. It was like Also probably a long show. Like he probably has a lot of fucking songs to Sing. Oh, he puts in a two. Yeah. It's like I. Think two hours. It's a two hour show. Yeah. No, that shit is so, I don't know how people do that long of tours and not have to cancel shows. Yeah. You never wanna have to do it. But like, you can't sing If. you can't fucking sing. Yeah. You know how much wear and tear is it really in your voice as a comedian? It's like you don't, you know, it's some, but it's not. Yeah, it's probably really different, huh? Yeah, it's more like just making sure your mental state is okay to go out there and build this energy of like, we're having a good time.


you know? What do you do if you're not, I don't Know. Like what would be warrants for you to not do a show? Or you're just raw talking it regardless. You don't have a fucking choice. Yeah. No. So for me, nothing really, unless I was hurt. Yeah. Or unless something like physically really tragic happened in life. But for a singer, is it realistic that it could come up to like three or four in the afternoon? You athlete and you're like, I can't do it. I mean, it depends like, fuck I, I had to cancel one, one time. I had the stomach flu, but like from hell, like I couldn't, it was so bad. I was just throwing up like ho, like I just couldn't like walk very far without like throwing up and shit.


So I had to cancel it. you know, when you're just like weak and shit. Oh yeah. I hate that dude. And you try to open a Gatorade and you can't open it. You have to not ask Your neighbor. That's how bad was. You're laying on the bathroom floor. Yeah, just curled up. That's the only time I'll do it. But I do lose my voice a lot. And, I. Just do the show anyways. I just hope that they're gonna sing. Oh. That's why a lot of people go like that to the crowd. Yeah. Sometimes you gotta do it. But some people fucking, some people fake it, which is crazy. It's not them singing the whole time. Some people fake it. You're lying. No. You didn't know that Uhuh. I knew that people do it. Some people have been accused of it. Mariah Carey does it. No. No, she doesn't really. Mariah Carey. Fuck. That's sad. I'm just, I'm allegedly.


I've heard that she does it. Somebody went to one of her shows recently. They said they bring a soap out there and she just lays on the soap for the whole time. Like in her pajamas. No left. No, she doesn't. No. Swear to God. See If. you can find any of it. Because can you even imagine like, you're like, I was fired. I'll go on tour, but it's exactly how I'm gonna be at home. And you're just fucking, she's Sitting on the couch and she's not singing. She's gotta be singing. You're fucking With me at that point. You have to sing. No, some of my friends just went in Vegas. They saw her not long ago. They're like, she just laid on the couch the whole time in her pajamas and sang. They're like, it was cool. But it was also like, this seems pretty crazy. I, I don't buy it. It could be mythological, you know? I don't know. It's gotta be mythological. Have You seen that crab that's eaten a gush or on the internet?


No. Show it to me. Oh, it's cool. What is it? It's a crab. Just eating a gush or see If. you can find it. What's your for you page? Like me? Yeah. Lot of just positivity.

I didn't, it had like a bad one on, so I took it out. And so And I try to put it into the new shell and it just wouldn't. And then it died. That was it. Yeah. I haven't had a pet since then. No. Should I get another one? I'm trying to think. If you're trying to get something, you know, what you thinking about getting?


I probably shouldn't do a crab again. It probably wraps. Feed it a gush or dude If. you do You Think so? Well, you Know, they like 'em. Girl, get the fucking The Valentines. That was a big crab. That's huh? That's fucking crazy. Oh, you could walk that thing. I'll Fucking watch one of them bitches. Eat a nerd rope, homie. I don't give a fuck dog. Next time I see you, I'm gonna bring you a crab. I'll give a damn Twizzler to a dolphin note. Do not bring me a damn crab. Dude. Play this video right here. This is at a church. Would you keep it If. you want to kick a fat kid at K Church? That's at a funeral. That's at a funeral. Oh, they were leading prayer If.


you want kick A fat kid at K Market? Can you imagine? You're in a fucking church. It can't be real. They all said, amen. Somebody played that on accident. That's fucked up. That might be my favorite clip I've seen all day. Oh, Amen. I like that. That's beautiful. Look at this. You see this whale return somebody's phone. They dropped it in the water. That's a whale Dolphin. Now it's a beluga Whale. Right? Wow. I mean it's like a, it's like, like a trans dolphin or Whatever. Do you know about SeaWorld? Yeah, I've heard about it. You know about the dolphins? Have you ever heard about dolphin births? Like people can, I don't know if this is safe, but people can give birth and the dolphins deliver your baby for you.


It's like a real thing. What do you mean? You've, You've never heard of that. How could I ever heard of it? 'cause it's not even something It No, it is something I, I promise you. You, what are you saying? Like a midwife. That's a dolphin. Yes. I swear it's a thing unless I'm confused. But I really think this is, and Where do you do it? In the deep end or whatever. Was this at a Hampton Inn? This isn't that thing that happened in outside of Waco. Was it? It It could have been. No, I think it's a thing. It's an option. It's an option at SeaWorld. No, look, it's a real thing. I've never seen this. Oh my god. And that thing's a pervert dude. They help you get it. No, That woman's married somebody. Tell that dolphin dolphin assisted birth.


A newer take on water birth is apparently a trend growing in popularity. The Sirius Institute in Hawaii, a new age center dedicated to encouraging the bonds between dolphins and humans. Often assisted childbirth. However, it's unclear if any women have actually gone through with it. One couple from North Carolina traveled to the center for prenatal bonding. But the actual birth with dolphins didn't happen. Wow. Somebody's had to do it though. If it's a trending thing, According to a website, pioneering Russian midwife, Igor Shaky began assisting births in the Black Sea with dolphins that live there. Some of the reported occurrences included a mother and a baby playing with the dolphin within 45 minutes of the birth.


Another instance of a free dolphin escorting a newborn human baby to the surface for its first breath. So it comes out underwater. Bro, let me tell you this. If my baby is born, I'm not giving it to a fucking dolphin dude for even 30 seconds. What if it swims off with it? That's a crazy thought. No, I think you have to do it. But then you're like, oh, it didn't work. Or what? Like how you gonna tell your wife it takes Your baby or it just eats your baby? Oh, that's a fucked up thought. But this is a thing though. They said it's therapeutic. you know what's also therapeutic? Taking the child home safely and feeding him and probably homeschooling him and making sure that your home is protected with a ring camera.


I mean, this just seems fucking insane. Like how weird people get too weird. Dude, Somebody in LA is definitely doing This. Oh, some perverting. Somebody know's. Probably done that. Yeah. One of your friends. Oh, I don't have friends. One of your friends. One of your friends has probably done that. Jessie Murph. I don't have friends. You should talk to them. Do you, have you any new mentors that have come into your life through like, you know, sometimes you meet some of your favorites and you meet any of them that like, kind of like, has Madonna spoken to you? No. That would be wild though. I don't know. There are people I look up to a lot that I know. Like communication.


Like, like Adele. I fucking love Adele. Really? I look up to her so much. Yeah. I think she's incredible. Yeah. She's magical. Huh? She's magical. You've seen her live? No. I've seen her in person somewhere, but I've never seen her live. Really? I wanna see it really bad. Yeah. Did Did you ever perform right after at a venue as her or anything like that? No. I performed in some of the same venue. Maybe because I mean she went on like smaller tours earlier in her career. Yeah, I think. But no, I don't know. She plays in Vegas a lot I think. Yeah. I don't know. But Did she ever reach out? No, but I don't know how this happened, but she like signed a set list. Somebody got it from me for my birthday.


I think it was just a, somebody was like, can you please do this? She probably did it, but I don't know. It's, it's on my wall and it's my favorite thing I own. Really? Oh yeah. What about you? Let me think. If somebody gave me something that was real nice one time, the guy that's in Better Call Saul one time, I think I was performing somewhere after him and he left me a nice note. What'd he say? He said, have fun. I was just here. Wow. You have it on your wall? Nope. Bob Denki. But he wrote it, signed it. Thought it was pretty nice of him. That's special. What do I have as something that's real special?


Yeah. What's the best gift you've ever received? Or, so what's something that If, you could only hang one thing on your wall. What? What are you hanging? Oh, that's Such a good question. One thing, I don't know, it's, I, I can't even answer it. I don't think it's a crazy question. There's a nice piece of art. My friend painted like, it was like the first piece of art I ever got. And maybe I would hang that there I guess. But what does it look like? It's just a picture of Chris Farley. Who's that? He's a comedian. He was in a movie called Tommy Boy, black Sheep. He's like a famous actor. That's him. He died though. I've seen him somewhere.


Yeah, he's, he used to do like, he did films like Adam Sandler, David Spade. Oh my God. He was on Saturday Night Live. He did like Fat Guy and a Little Coat. He used to do like all kinds of like sketches and shit. I know, I've seen him somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. You've seen him. He was like unbelievably famous. He was like the most famous guy that they ever had. Was It? I mean, look at him. He's, oh wow. What movie is this? This fucking, no, this is him that's going on like a, A talk show. Oh fuck Obviously. Fuck. Sorry. Wow. Wow. Yeah, dude, my friend said he would just puke. He like, my buddy would go over to his place sometimes and he is like, he would just puke on the side of his bed.


And then just like between like the wall and the bed all the time. Yo, what for? Why? Just To party. Just to be like that dude. My friend Jeff. So you ever heard that song? It's an old song. It's like you gotta keep 'em separated. No, wait, maybe keep going. Oh Yeah. You talking back to me. Oh, your mouth. You gotta keep 'em separated. Come out and Play. Yes, yes. I've heard that. Well, you're getting a tattoo now. You're getting ink done. Anyway, my friend Jeff, he like anger issues or whatever and he would just, he would get angry. He would go in his room, he would play that song and he would just beat the fuck punch holes all in the walls of the, That's all he would do.


Just to that song you think? Yeah. That was the only one. Oh, we could tell when he was mad. 'cause in there you could hear the walls like not doing well. And then here's what would happen though. Every year at Christmas his parents would get his walls redone for him in the room. He would fucking do it again. Yeah. This was at his family home? Yeah, at his family home. And then I saw this band one time in Vegas, And I told the lead singer, it was like this, the lead singer of Offspring And I was like, bro, you are never gonna fucking believe this. And, and they died laughing. It was pretty awesome. Before you go love life, what's the, is it, is it, is it harder to date as you get more popular? Yeah. No, I think I'm just, it's hard when you're busy. Yeah. you know, and when you're touring a lot I think.


Oh yeah. But yeah, I don't know. I don't Know. Yeah, it's hard to build something 'cause you're kind of on the go and your career. Like it almost has to come first. Sometimes it Has to come first, right? Yeah. I mean, what do you do? My career is just like, I've worked so hard that my career takes first place. It's Got to Most of the time, even if I don't want it to. Yeah. It's like, I have to do this tomorrow I have to do this. It's like, I'd love to, a lot of times it'd be like, yeah look, I would like to do that, but I just can't right now. you know? But then you start to think, oh well then like, yeah, at some point there'll be times where I don't have to tour as much and, and then maybe I could try to devote more attention to it.


'cause it takes attention too. It takes attention and it takes like care, I think. Yeah. But fuck. I mean, but do you ever see yourself, I mean, at some point I'm sure, but is there ever gonna be a point where you're not touring though? That's A good question. And then you bring your family on tour and then they gotta help out. Yeah. And your wife's selling Merch or whatever and calling you an asshole at night. you know, outside of a fucking waffle house or something somewhere. And you're like, yeah, that's What you, I'm an asshole's. What? That's what you think. That's what you think. I mean, I think you gotta, you know, hope for the best. you know? I think so. Dirty, that's the new single that's available now with Teddy swims. With Teddy swims. So fricking cool.
