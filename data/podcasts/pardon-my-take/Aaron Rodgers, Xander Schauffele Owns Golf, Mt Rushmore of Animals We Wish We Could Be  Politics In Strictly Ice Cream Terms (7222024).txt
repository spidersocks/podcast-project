Today is Monday, July 22nd. And boys Xander Schley is the golfer of the year. How about that? Two majors. Everyone thought it was gonna be scheffler jacking 'em up. It, it, it's, it's like crazy that the year has been Scotty Scheffler. I know there's still some golf left, but Xander winning two outta the four majors and winning it in incredible fashion in Scotland on Sunday where he just, he, he went to the back nine.


He was down two strokes, I believe. And he basically was like, fuck this, I'm winning this tournament. He had the eye, eye of the tiger and I mean woods. And he was making shot after shot shot four under in the back nine, one by two strokes. And he now has half of the majors in this year. And we saw his dad finally get to celebrate with him wearing his Panama. Was it Panama Jack? Is that what the name of the hat is? I Believe so. Yeah. He was Tommy Bahama maybe. Yeah, he was wearing the hat. He had a a a flaska whiskey. He was looking awesome. Hoss. Hoss. Big time Hoss. Yeah. Absolute Hoss. And Xander is now. I like you can't say that Xander hasn't had a better, I know Scotty has all like these wins on the tour.


Two majors to one. That's it. Xander had the better year. Well it's crazy 'cause Xander Schley could not win a major. Yeah. And then now the lids off. He broke the seal. He did. We've all been there. And this is a big year for the United States of America. Yes. We had all four major winners. That was the first time, I wanna say since it's been a very, very long time. 2000 Jack and Arnie. And it was all Tiger. No, no, because remember, oh no, he did the Tiger Slam in. So it was, it was not all four in the same year. It was 1982. Mm. First Time Jack and Arney. First time since 1982 that the winners of all four majors are American. Who was that in 1982? Don't have a, It's gotta be Jack and Arney. Probably Jack and Arnie. Yeah. She's gotta say that. but It Jack, it's still USA is back big Time.


Yeah. It Was Suck My dick world. I I, I stand by my, take that I don't want to play golf in England. Links golf. But I like watching it because it looked miserable Friday, especially Friday. Looked like hell on Earth. And they actually said that, I think someone, I can't remember who it might've been, Scotty said it was the gates of hell when you, when you make the turn to nine and the wind's just right in your face. Guys were hitting like Dr. Actually there was one guy who, I can't remember exactly who it was, but he said he almost hit driver on a par three, but he's like, I can't do that. But he thought about it because the wind was that miserable. I think Scotty, it was that, that long par three. It's like 230 yards.


And Scotty hit a three wood, I believe. Yeah. And stuck it to like two feet. It was, it looked so miserable. Guys were struggling left and right, but Xandr was the best. And it, it did calm down. I I know that link, Scott. It's fun to watch because it's fun to watch them struggle with it and have to hit these crazy shots. But I just watched it and was like, if I had to play that, I'd infinity shots for me. I, I'd say there's some holes where the bunkers are so deep that if I got in there, I would just take my bag and I I would just drive the opposite Direction. That was that one guy on Thursday who just left. Yeah. I'm out. Kinda looked like me. I I liked that move. He was like, he hit such a bad shot. He's like, I'm not gonna go pick that up. Yeah. I can't. I'm just saying my back hurts. I'm leaving. I can't look for this thing. Yeah.


Brooks today he was it today or was it yesterday where he lost his ball? I think it was Saturday. Yeah. He lost his ball and then he hit another provisional. And that was also a very tough one to find at that point. When you're provisional is not, when you can't see it, that's another one where it's like, I'm going home. Yeah. It's not my day. And Xander just Do, I mean that shot on 11 where he is like, fuck it, I'm going right for it. Yeah. It was so awesome. I hank I I have a question for you as our golf expert, but we should at least mention that we are That was really cool when Max cheered that loudly to make the cut. And that has everything to do with the fact that he's a friend of ours and we're completely biased. Cut of the year. Cut of the year. Yeah. Cut take are coming up and, and, and, and next week might be cut of the year.


I, that was one of those moments where I'm like, that's our guy. Yeah. He's a good dude. Right. We wouldn't make fun of it if it was someone else. Good golf. That's our fucking guy. Good Golfer. Even better human this year. He's been a better human being than golfer In the majors. Yes. But except, Except for the first three rounds of the masters. I will say the, if he had done that for the US Open PGA or the Masters, I would've, it would've taken a lot for me not to say something I can understand being like, I don't wanna have to fly all the way back home. Yeah. I'm here for this tournament. Yeah. And like it's across the, across the pond. All that shit you've probably paid. That's actually gotta be nice. You Probably paid for your Airbnb already. Yeah. You might as well just use it for the weekend.


Right. Like If, you lose the, if If you don't make the cut at Masters. Yeah. It's a bummer. But you can be home within five hours. Yeah. Also, if, if he hadn't made the cut, he might not have been able to get home with the airline delays. That's true. Yeah. So think about that Jerry. Right. The the cleric jug I think, I think is the best golf trophy. Embrace debate. Best one to drink out of. Definitely. Are we counting the, the green jacket? The green jacket is a trophy. Yeah. In which case I would say, yeah, green jacket. But besides the Green jacket, what about the one that they wanted us to take a picture With? Oh, the FedEx Cup. Yeah. That one to me, I mean the aura on that one really. It's all, all eyes forward to the road to Dubai. Rory told us that's the most important one of the entire year. We, We listen, the people at the PGA have been incredible to us and they've gotten us some great guess.


But when you were like, yeah, the FedEx Cup trophy's coming by, do we want to do something with it? And Hank and I were like, I don't know what we would do with it. Drinking Coors Light out of it. Yeah. We didn't win a I I feel I would feel wrong doing that to a trophy. We have no business. Yeah. I'd look at it, I would point at it. Yeah. Be like, There it is. And be like one day, one day. This could be ours. No, but it's the clear jug is, I think it's a underrated trophy. Yeah. Did you It's one of the most underrated sports. Did you hear Xander's Dad said he's drinking wine out of it. It'd be sacrilege to drink beer out of it. No. You could drink just you. It has to be room temperature Beer. No, he said it would be sacrilege because it, let me get the exact quote. I think you have to drink whiskey out of it.


Well, he was drinking whiskey out of a flask in the back of the media room. Yeah. You gotta stay warm. It was awesome. Hank question for you. Yes. In terms of this golf tournament, what, first of all, rank your majors, which ones you'd wanna win? Masters. Hmm. Open us Open. Oh. Opens two. What about the Ryder Cup? That's not a major, That's not A major in my mind. That's a good answer. So open is number two. You have more history. There's a lot of history. Birthplace of golf, there's A lot of history. Hank And it's like more, more random.


There's always more random winners I feel like in, in the open. Like even, what was the guy's name? Tristan. Tristan. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I thought it Was Thurston for most of the weekend. Yeah. The Yeah. Thirst. Same until I, until I turned it on the broadcast. I was like, oh, name's Tristan. This is what Xander's dad said. He said, Xander said he, he himself is not a big drinker. So when a reporter asked what he would drink outta the clat jug, he joked he couldn't wait to see what his father would put in here first. So then a gaggle reporters rushed over to Stefan to ask. He solemnly looked down from the brim of his Panama hat to remind the reporters. Claret means a red wine for from Bordeaux. Of course it's Claret Jug If. you put beer in it. That's sacrilege. I'm not fighting with that guy. He was a ha I would, I would put beer in it.


I I'm gonna let him do the wine then maybe sneak in a little beer at the end. Americanized that trophy. My Question for you, Billy Horschel was kind of rooting for him. Seems like a really nice guy. Didn't love, didn't feel like he dressed to win a major today. I Disagree. He's got A unique vibe though. Okay. I understand. He always kind of dresses. I Don't know that. I think he dressed to win the open. Yeah. The Carter didn't Anywhere else. I don't know. It just, it didn't feel like killer. You know? It's a little too nice. It's like, it's a little too nice. That's what's the, what's the guy who is a who? The, the kids who read the kids' books. Who was a US sniper? Mr. Rogers. Yeah. That guy. Not, not really snipers. No, no. There's a rumor that there's a rumor that he always wore the cardigans because his arms were just tatted up like a motherfucker.


One of My favorite rumors, won't You be Me, Billy Horshe. So I was rooting for him. 'cause I was like, I didn't have, I bet on Brooks. I bet on Holin. 'cause we thought he was, you know, questioning death. One of the dumbest bets ever. So I was just, I was watching as a golf fan on Sunday and I was rooting for Billy Horshe, his putting like, set up when he set up for a putt on maybe four. I was like, that's it, he's done. I don't know if that's like, I know it's what his setup is, but it looks so nervous and so not steady that I was like, he can't win a major. It's also hard sometimes, like I you like that wear your heart in your sleeves guys. But also sometimes when they're like overreacting to Miss putts and stuff, when it's that early in the round, you're like, yeah, you gotta you gotta get it together.


You can't let it, like, Xander just doesn't react to anything. Anything. He was, he was just staring. Like he would hit a great shot and he would just stare down, like put his head down and be like, next shot. Billy Horschel was practicing his putting technique while someone else was putting on like the fourth or fifth. Like, this guy's cooked and I wanted him to do while I was rooting for him. But I just, maybe he's got a Do you think as a golf expert, he's gotta change his putting stance? No, I think whatever. I I think it got him, got him that that far. Okay. He's come a long way in the last year. Okay. 'cause I just saw it with my eyes and I was like, nah. Doesn't have It. Doesn't have it. I do think that the winner of the open is usually the one that's most likely when you look at their Wikipedia page to just list their golf accomplishments.


Yeah. And nothing else. Yeah. It's just like, this is what this guy's known for made the tour in this year to like top 10 finishes, then won the open. Yeah. Like a master's champ might have a DUI, They might have a DUI something fun in there. Right. Maybe they played football in high school. Yeah. Open championship. There's so many guys where it's like, he joined the web tour in 2011. Stuart Sink. He was born on the web tour. Remember when Stewart Sink won it? Yeah. That was cool. The Other thing about him, tan line. Tan line. Yeah. At least He's got That was crazy. Also really cool that his name's Stewart Sink. Yeah, it is. You got a sink. Putts just fucking badass. Anything else from from the golf. Did you watch it all? Hank or were you golfing? No, I watched. You did? Yeah. I like having it on in the morning.


Yeah. I mean, I Woke, I I watched the, you know, last three or four hours, but it was kind of like, you wake up and guys have played 18 arms, but it's nice like on a Saturday and Sunday, it's a nice change of pace being like, oh, the, it's gonna be over by like one o'clock. It's just nice. It is fun To wake up and see somebody have like the worst toll of their life to start your day. Yeah. They're doing the recap of what happened, what you missed while you were sleeping. You are like, oh, that guy had a much worse day than I'm gonna have. Yeah. This Is good. I I also had a, a very dumb, I can't wait for football to be back thought. But just seeing the stands full of people in sweatshirts and jackets. I was like, I can't wait for like Thanksgiving, Fall. Fall. Can't wait for fall Thanksgiving Football. I, I got a text from our good friend Mike Vrabel this morning, just of a picture of the muni lot.


Oh nice. And it said like, I can't wait for that. Yeah. Seven Weeks. The muni lot will look like this. And look, just look at these dudes getting ready to watch football in Cleveland. This is gonna make you excited. Yeah. Very excited for Look at that. That's football. The best. Almost back. We're almost there guys. Yeah, I'm ready for it. I'm ready for football. My body is ready. I mean, golf is great, but football's football. That's just the difference we've have you seen the, like clips for coming from, from training camp? Yeah. It's awesome. I mean, we, we fucked up. We fucked up by letting Patrick Mahomes have Xavier worthy. Yeah. That one made. We did that. That was a clip where it's like, get ready to see this a million times. You gotta be especially bad for Bills fans to watch that. Yeah. Fastest guy out there. Okay. Other things, I guess we should probably talk about politics, but only do it in a sports way.


Your boy memes, Casianos could not be more back. He's dialed Casianos hit a home run today. I know it was after Joe Biden dropped outta the race, but he also did it a couple hours after the announcement that Tom Brennaman is back calling college football games. That Was my, who's back in the week. Yeah. Was old Tommy B And then Castano's. Like they, I would imagine the sports book lost all their money today on Casianos hitting a home run. Yeah. The Minute you finds out, you know, he's gonna hit a home run. You gotta Pokemon go to DraftKings whenever whenever something bad happens. Yeah. 'cause Castanos has dialed in. He's got his pulse on on all the tragedies. Yeah. So I got a question. The only question I got is, is the whole Biden thing.


Is he, he now is just that coach who got fired at Long Beach State and then made the tournament. That's what's happening. Kind of. Yeah. So he is gonna ride it out. He's gonna coach the bowl game. What if, what if just Russia loses the war against Ukraine? What if the economy goes through the roof? Yeah. Can he jump in first week in November? Be like, I think we're gonna run it back. We got some momentum. We got something going here. It's a momentum. It took me stepping down to make it happen. It it is kind of like the backup quarterback situation. You know, the whole, the whole weekend was, was we, we said this a couple weeks ago, but it really is political, political people not understanding sports fandom because all the leaks that were coming out saying there's no way he's dropping out. Yeah. We're just What happens before a coach gets fired?


Yeah. Or if it's, if it's a quarterback, it's like, Kamala, are you re are you really ready to see Trevor Simeon start? Yeah. Why not? You think you wanted Trevor Simeon start, let's go until he steps up and then throws three picks in the first half and you're like, fuck. I kind of, I kind of miss Sack Wilson. Yeah. And there's factions inside the coaching room. Yeah. It's like, oh, this Trevor Simeon. Well, the Trevor Simeon was drafted by by the new Trevor Simeon's. A solid player. Yeah. Well he is, He's been, he's been around for a, He was drafted By Kamala, had a job for like 20 years. He was drafted by the, the new gm. Yeah. And they're like, we gotta we gotta make this switch. So yeah. That's politics as it relates to sports. So That's, that's about it. Yeah. They're probably still gonna lose. I Do I do think it was fucked up. They made him do it on national ice cream day.


The guy loves ice cream. Yeah. He fucking loves ice cream. He didn't wait right. Till the open was over too, which was nice. Yeah. Maybe he had, he like ate a bunch of ice cream and he was like, I could just do this every day. Yeah. Like, I don't have to have a job. I don't have to worry about running the world anymore. I can just, there Probably is like a bunch of national ice cream days. Right. That's one of those days We should listen. Jill, Dr. Jill Ice Cream Day. Dog Day Donuts coffee. It's like, there's 17 of 'em. There's a bunch of women's days too. Yeah. And then whenever that happens, everyone like international men's day trends because everyone's like, how come there's no international men's day? Yeah. And weird. All that. There's only one stake in a blowjob Day. Interesting. That's fucked up. Interesting. Huh. Interesting. I think trying to Keep us down. I think this week is uncle's day.


Shout out to all, all the uncles out there. The real heroes. Uncle's day, National Uncle's day baby. Yeah. Big time. You Don't even become an uncle like by you don't do anything. Well, you don't, you don't choose to. You you're born and then you have a birthday. Yeah. I know. But it's just very funny to be like uncle's day. You don't, you don't choose to be uncle. It's, it's, it's best bestowed On you. It's bestowed upon you. You can't turn it down. You can't Yeah. Can't be like, no, I don't want to be an Uncle. Thank God there's a holiday for uncles. Yeah. The parents that pick up the kids and then just get rid of them at the end of the day. Of course. Once every month. I love it. You deserve a day off. You could also just tell Joe Biden just every day is ice cream day. Yeah. Jill, just tell him that. Just be like, It's For me. Honey, guess what? Ice cream day again today.


Yeah. And be like, oh. Oh, It is for me. The, my Apple fault doesn't fall from the tree. My son is now pulling my own tricks on me. Where we went to the ice cream store last night or Saturday night and we got the same exact ice cream. And he was like, Hey, can I try yours? I was just like, God fucking Damnit. Yeah. You never know. It might be Better. Had like half my ice cream. I was like, this is bullshit. There's nothing better than vacation gelato or vacation ice cream. Ugh. Every day. Every single day. If I'm, if I'm outta the office, if I'm in a different city, you bet your sweet ass. I'm getting gelato There. Like a hot day at the beach or the pool and then ending it with a fucking huge ice cream cone. That's it. Not living baby.


But you Know what I like about the cups is the tiny spoons. So you don't think that you're eating that much gelato. You're like, I'm just, I'm just nibbling. I'm just a cone guy. To and through same, same, same waffle. Just regular. I used to be a regular and then my lifestyle just got too big. I just, you know, waffles are a lot. I know, but I need, I need the, I need it to be able to hold all that ice cream. Yeah. But I like to Yeah. I'm usually Like one scoop, right? Yeah. No, I'm a two scoop guy. And the two scoops don't go in sugar cones or, or the cake cones. You need the waffle cone. I just is what it is. You gotta, it's like going from XL to double xl. Same scoop or two different flavors. Sometimes I'll mix, miss mix and match. But the problem is you gotta make sure the bottom flavor is the, is the, like you, if you're taking a risk foundation, you're like, if you're in between two flavors and you fuck up the bottom flavor, you gotta restart and just get another cone.


That's Why I, I'm more into the cup because you get the two, two different flavors. Two scoops, two flavors. And then you get all the toppings. If they can like put extra toppings, then the cup catches at the bottom to That's but it, but it sounds like you're the same type of eater I am. Where If, you get a plate and you've got three or four different things on that plate. You save the one you want until the end. Right. The last bite Is the most important bite I dive Into Whatever fucked up vegetable that somebody made me get. Yeah. You gotta Get, I eat that first and then I, you save the real action for the end. I Have to have the, a great last bite one and Oh, real fat guy moves. I do. Go ahead Max. Not the your fat guy. No, you go. You mentioned the, the toppings. Yeah. Gotta get the whipped cream. Got the, gotta get the gummy bears. Gotta get, Sometimes I'll go chocolate syrup. Sometimes I'll go real fat guy and I'll get a bowl with the toppings and a cone on the side and I'll just be like, it's like you can basically have like six cones dip.


'cause you just keep scooping it in. You dip. No, you keep adding more to the cone you lick, then add more. And then you finally eat the cone. Real fat guy move. But pros pro move. I got a great, great spread this weekend. I got, it's a combination. I didn't even know that this existed. Shout out in Michigan, they have more fat guy flavors than any other state in the union. Yep. It's a combination peanut butter and marshmallow fluff. Mm. Mixed into one spread. It is fucking awesome. That's pretty good. Yes. That's pretty good. What are you gonna say, max? I was Just gonna ask if we could get ice cream tonight. Yeah, we should. Yeah, We should. Okay. We should. I'm so down. This Is, this is actually a perfect, I I, I'll, I will throw it out there to the awls. And anyone listening to this maybe who just showed up to the first episode for Aaron Rodgers.


Find me a breakdown of Joe Biden stepping down better than this one. Yeah. Just where we just talked about ice cream for 10 Minutes. Deep, deep dive into the sweet creamy treats. Let's get get, this Is how politics should be discussed. Can we have ice? Yeah. Can we have podcasts outside today? Fuck yeah. Yeah. It's the summertime. Yeah. Do whatever we want. What are, what flavors are you guys gonna get? I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do a mix of mint chocolate chip and then chocolate chip cookie dough. Mm. Mint chip. Mint chip. Mint chocolate chip. Chocolate chip. Mint chocolate chip. Yeah. I had, I had double scoop mint chocolate chip last night. I Wonder if there's somewhere walkable. I don't like it when the mint chocolate chip is white ice cream. Yes. Green. It's gotta be green. Make it green. I want, it's gotta be green. I want that weird fucked up color of green that doesn't exist green in nature besides in mint chocolate chip ice cream.


Matthew, since you're sitting here and just, and just nodding your head. I know you love ice cream. So tell us your favorite flavor. Chocolate. Okay. There we go. Go More solid. I'll Put the better. That's good. That's like a fucking, that, that, that's basically just running power offense. Yeah. Run the ball. Yeah. Run the football. Stop the run. Four, four yards will get your first down. We're Playing Steelers football right now. Also. Peanut butter Chocolate is my favorite. Peanut butter chocolate's not bad, but when you combine the peanut butter in the, in ice cream, it's good. I don't like peanut butter. Chocolate cookies. I think peanut butter. Wait, what do you mean? Like, if it's a cookie that has peanut butter flavor and chocolate flavor. I don't like that dries my mouth out. Oh, I agree With that. In an ice cream. He's Saying like a, an actual cookie. Yeah, like a peanut butter cookie.


I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but I love peanut butter and chocolate Together. Yep. Are you I'll eat, I'll eat peanut butter. Anything. Hank and I are maybe like, the foundation of our friendship is peanut butter and chocolate. Anytime we have Reese's, we'll just give each other a, a slice. Speaking of Matthew, are we going with Huey as his name? I've I, someone said to me, well, I'll find the tweet. So hole's out hole is a hundred percent out. Yep. It just doesn't work. We tried. It doesn't work. But shout out the a WL Mikey memberships. Great fucking name. Mikey Memberships intern. Matthew is a Huey. If I've ever heard one. Don't even need to see him to know he's a Huey.


I mean, I, I think he is a Huey and I kind of like the idea of him having to introduce himself to like, I'm Huey football coaches and, and Aaron Rogers being like, Hey, I'm Huey. Now let, let's talk about the spelling. 'cause I think he's an HUEI. Correct. HUEY Huey. Not H-E-W-E-Y. Baby Huey. Yeah. Huey. The The, the comic. Yeah. You're Huey. Yeah. You're Huey.

So it's like you can just, you can make it. Oh, It's however You want. I would say Yeah. 16 handles. Yep. Or the one here.


What? I forever Yogurt. Forever yogurt. Yep. So Good. I would say frozen yogurt is the Brock Purdy of ice creams. Mm. You can win with it. Where ideally would you take it number one? Probably not. But you get all the great toppings on it and it becomes great. Right. The Key to frozen yogurt is to trick yourself into being like, it's not as bad as ice cream, but then you put an entire candy bar on it. Yep. That's what you do. Yep. And it's great. Okay. Anything else going on in sports or politics? This is good sports. We Crush, we crush the Politics. This we might be the best politics. Like move over to the Johns. We're pretty good. We Crush the politics. U USA almost lost the south sedan. Oh Yeah. More politics. That was fine. Update for back here.


Huey Has already changed his Twitter name to Huey. Oh, Nice. I love it. Man of action. He went to Twitter. I fucking love it. Love That. I love it. Yeah. So we, we scored with eight seconds left. Right. To take the, we're down by like 14, 15 points in the first half. LeBron, I, I'm convinced that Steve Kerr told the guys like, fuck this up, like tank a little bit. And then let's see if we can come back. South Sudan. I lu al dang has basically like put that like entire program, put it together. And they, they're, they're scrappy. Yeah. They got some decent players. Yeah. So It's A wake up call. Steph and LeBron saved the day Steph hit that big three. Derek White. Derek White. That lobbed to Ant. I don't know what happened there. An that wasn't Derek White's fault. It was an's fault or not.


Sorry, not sorry. Ant Anthony Davis. But yeah. Are we worried? Does this count against USA max? What? Did you see Joellen beads quote. Oh, that was what my Monday reading was. I left. We should talk about it after. I thought it Was satire. Yeah, let's talk about it after. Okay. 'cause it it is. You have one quote. I have another. You have the one about LeBron. Yeah. Yeah. I have another We'll do that after Aaron Rodgers. 'cause it is, can't wait quite. He did a New York Times profile. It's quite something. Can't Wait. I thought I, I was like, oh, this is butt crack Sports. It was quite something. Okay. Lemme see what else did I have on my list of sports topics?


The Celtics gave another extension. Yeah. Where the fuck are you guys getting all this money? They don't, so they're selling the team. So the current ownership is like, fuck, I'll give everybody a contract. I'd never have to pay it. Good for your friend. Christoph Forus. Yeah. I mean the, the Wait Who got the extension? Same Housing. Oh Yeah. Yeah. But they have poor zenga. They have, they have everyone signed. They had the Same Houser made $45 million And they, the the penalty that they have to pay on. It's insane. Why not? But who Cares? That's that's great ownership. You Yeah. You want that? Like go spend all the money. Go for it again. You got the young guys like locked up for a long time. Every ownership should look at this and be like this.


I mean, the Warriors kind of did that. Remember when the Warriors just spent money like it was going outta business. Why wouldn't you do that? If? you have the core of a championship team. Yeah. Here's the thing. Money's not real. Yeah. Not to get all Aaron Rodgers on you. But money only has value because we say it does. Yeah. 210 million tax penalty. That's, that's Biden. That's fucking ashtray money. Yeah. That's what Biden know. Yeah. Now Biden's out. Who knows? Taxes might go down. That's Fucking easy. I love It. There's also some Oakland athletics news. Maybe you have, what you should do is you should have, you should have Zelensky buy the Celtics and then no money problems. Yeah. It's Not bad. Think about that. Okay. Yeah.


Big circle. What was the Oakland Athletics news? I'm not smart enough to understand exactly what it is, but apparently there have been Oakland area investors, like pe business leaders that have money Okay. That want to in either invest in or, or try to purchase a lot of the, the A's and keep them in Oakland. And Major League baseball has allegedly been telling them that they're not allowed to talk about their interest. Ooh. Because they want the A's to move to Vegas so badly. Oh. 'cause it's going, you know, mean increased value for every other market M lb team. But apparently there are some people that want to kick money into the A's and keep it in Oakland. But for some reason, I don't know how the MLB is making them just shut up about it.


But they're not allowed to talk about it. Fuck John Fisher again. Fuck John Fisher. This is where we stand on this. I don't, I don't know how deep this goes and how they're able to keep the people from being quiet about their, their rumored interest. but it, it just stinks to high heaven. Yeah. And I don't like it. It's bad. It's bad for Sports. Very bad. Did you see Jose Sgo throughout the first pitch? Oh, how, how'd he do? He actually did. All Right. Okay. Good. He's good. He flexed Good. But yeah, this is, this is, this sounds suspect. It's very suspect Sounds very, very suspect. They, they keep, I see people keep posting the temperature like first pitch temperature. And it's crazy. They're gonna play in Sacramento.


I know that Vegas will be indoors, but Sacramento's not. So like they, the other day it was like Oakland first pitch temperature 75 degrees Sacramento 105. Vegas 119. So I I I just looked it up. Right now, apparently what's happening is the people that are rumored to have interest in investing in the ace and keeping them local Major league baseball is saying don't talk about it publicly. You're not allowed to say anything because If, you do. We're going to prevent you from investing in any other teams in the future. Oh, that's bullshit. So that's how they're making them shut up about it. That's bullshit. So, fuck John Fisher. Fuck man. Fraud. Fuck Man. Fraud man. Fraud's a dick. That's bullshit. Yep.


Okay. The only other thing I had was Lamar has diarrhea again. Yeah. Yep. That's how we know football's officially back. Yep. Lamar Jackson missed the first day of, of, of training camp. Right? Yeah. He had to be sent home. Yeah. He, he, I guess showed up at the facility and then they sent him home. 'cause his butt hurt. Yeah. But that's a classic first day of school move. Yeah. I could imagine Hank missed a couple first days. No. First days were fun. You show up. First days fun. The second day sucks. Yeah. Show up. Get your fit Off. First day, like especially in college when you just get your books. Yeah. Do a little, couple icebreakers. Yeah. Then you never show up again. Yeah. Syllabus day Also, they had the MLB Hall Hall of Fame induction today.


Didn't realize that. Great timing. Baseball. Yeah. Jim Leland. I hope. When did he give a speech today? I think so. It was Jim Leland, Todd Hilton, Adrian Beltre and Joe Mauer. Jim Leland. I, he should have been smoking a cigarette. I don't know if he was during his induction, but he should have been. Yeah. That, I don't know what, I guess now's the time. But why wouldn't you do it like during all-Star break or something? I don't know. It was just, I was listening to the Cubs game on the radio and I, they were like, oh yeah. And the Jim Leland's going in today. I like, oh, okay. Wait. Stay rolling. Cubs can't Hit. Cubs cannot hit at all. Hank. They had a walk off walk today. I had my statistical model. Had 'em at 0% chance of winning that game when Soda had a, a no hitter with like nine Ks going through six innings.


And I was like, he gave a one home run. I was like, that's it. Statistical model had zero. They found a way. No, they suck. You went Saturday. Yeah. They can't hit. It's brutal to watch. I went Friday. They, I also can confirm they can't Hit. Yeah. No, they cannot hit at all. It's boring. Baseball. You guys lost two outta three to the Pirates. That's True. But we won today. Two outta three of the pirates. One outta one in your cap. One. That's a big rivalry. That's up for bragging rights. Oh yeah. In the state of Pennsylvania.

And McGregor I think owns the boxing company that Mike Perry is the face of. Okay. And after the loss, he basically was, you know, disgusted by what he saw. He said, you're fired. Mike Perry Go And who? Mike Perry is. A UFC fighter. Yep. We knew we just, some people at home might not know. Yeah, I didn't know that either. But then about Jake Paul, he said, Jake Paul is the biggest piss bag I've ever seen in my life. 40 pound weight difference juice out of his head.


Still shitting himself in there and just basically going out, going after him for steroids. So is he gonna wait, Connor McGregor was going after Jake Paul for steroids. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Oh, by the way, last time we talked about Connor McGregor on this podcast, Robbie Robbie Fox reached out to me. He was very concerned that we thought that Conor McGregor might be done as a fighter. He wanted to clarify that he's not done. Oh, okay. Good. As a Fighter. Good. But this sounds like, I mean, as far as Conor McGregor taunts go, this is pretty low. It's not that bad. He said a lot worse about a lot of other guys. Yeah. Maybe he's lost his fastball. He might Chirping. Yeah. 'cause he, I mean he was calling Habib a terrorist. Yeah. I swear to God. A fat can of bitch piss. Okay. That's better. That's good.


Yeah. Most valuable piss bag. And With the Irish accent that takes it up a notch. Fat, what is it? Fat bag of fat Can of bitch Piss fat can Of bitch piss is pretty good. Connor is not done. Robbie said. Not done. As Long as he doesn't have any more movie premieres, As long as there's no movies that he stars gonna come out. I saw that face.

And Tom Brennaman is an undervalued asset. Love that. So yeah, this is good. He should actually, given his background, he should probably call live golf events. Yeah. I feel like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia would love to have him on board. Yeah. But it C CW is where we had our bowl game. Yeah. So the CW president, whose name is by the way, Dennis Miller is kind of crazy. Love that he hired him because he is taken full responsibility for his actions. I think he spent the last couple years just talking to gay people.


He did Do I. I did see him doing like a bunch of speeches Yeah. In front of people. So maybe that's what it was. Yeah. He's been apparently like hanging out at like local gay alliance meetings. Just talking to people for the last three years. That would actually be awesome if in the broadcast booth he just had a big sign that like number of days since I've, Since I've used Yeah, Yeah. Since I've used this word. Or if he just came out Then. but it would be great if it was like number of days since I used this word and he does the whole season and then all of a sudden it's like a Duke game in the middle of November and it's at zero. And we're like, what? Yeah. What happened? Something Happened. Yeah. Or just only calls Liberty University's games. Yeah, that'd be good too. All right. So Tom Brennaman iss back my, who's back of the week.

It was the OnlyFans because You would have to think that he would like If. you think it's gonna be your last one?


Yeah. Make it a good one. It was, it was the OnlyFans I believe. But yeah, that's just so, just a reminder to everyone out there that, you know, you could go at any moment. This one, he went because he was trying to kill a former president, but yeah. Yeah. Clear that. Clear that browser history. Use the private browser because you don't want to be like, Hey, this guy died and he was looking, he was jerking off a couple hours before he went. If you die portal. I will, I will clear your browser history. Yeah, I'll make sure. Thank You. I will too. Thanks Hank. Clear your browser sir. Would you like us to clear yours? I don't really care. Okay.

Alright. Last who's back? Huey. The WNBA. Yes. Yes. I mean, what a game last night. That was awesome. Well explain to maybe some people who didn't watch it. Well, I, who wouldn't? Not me. I watched it. I mean we, We had, so for the, the all-star game format this year we had team WNBA first thing Team USA.


Oh, That's awesome. So yeah, A lot of Kaitlyn Clark, angel Reese got to play against team USA kind of, you know, a little, little revenge. Kinda let 'em know. Did They win? Team WNBA won by eight points. Wow. And Really it was, that Should have been for the chance to go to the Olympics. They should just swapped teams. Yeah. Yeah. It really, what is, it actually got closer towards the end. The WNBA was kind of in charge of that game for the most part. Team USA got a little closer, but it was impressive. The rookies did great. Hugh, I got two questions. Who won the three point contest? It was the same girl. The same girl won the three point contest and the skills contest. Who was she shout out to? Mrs. Gray. Ms. Gray. Okay. And then who Would like a teacher?


My second question is, who won the slam dunk contest? There was none. Okay. So that's the kicker. Who Balled out? That is the kicker. Who balled out for the team? WNBA. So, So let's get Into here. I I know the answer and I, we have wanna see didn say the name Enrique. Okay. That's the first name. Yep. And the last name. Give me a couple more minutes. Oh boy. Do I. Have to, yeah, You got it.

She Played at Notre Dame. 34.6 assists a six for seven from the freeth throw line. Only not, you know, eight from 13 from three. And she should have been on the team Very much. Should have been. See I, she was actually like Caitlyn Clark was the one that everyone was saying. Oh, she got, why not put her on the team?


Enrique should have been on the team. Yeah. She's, she's better than players on that team. I saw Caitlyn Clark, she got picked up full court by, by Kelsey Plum, right? Yes. Yeah. Face guarding Her face guard and still got passed her and threw a diamond. Yeah. The Team USA like took it personally. It felt like a little bit more than the WNB. They probably should have taken it more personally 'cause they lost. Yeah. Yeah. And Angel Reese had five offensive rebounds. I mean, she was a beast on the paint. Wait, so this means even when they, if they win the Olympic gold, they're not the best team. Asterisk. They literally lost. Now isn't this the plot of like Mighty Ducks too? Yeah. Where they become the US national team. Yeah. They should let them be the US national team. I agree. Yeah. Okay. Thank you Hugh Huey. Good job.

When they run on top of them. That's awesome. Yeah, those videos are awesome. Alright, my last pick. I'm gonna pick the A pig in The Bahamas where the Instagram models come and take pictures With you. Pablo Escobar's Pig. No, the ones in The Bahamas. You know 'em the Instagram, the hot chicks. Yeah.

Yeah. They seem to have a good life. It's like they're all at a, a big music festival.


All Right. Yeah. It's Bonnaroo. Every week. I had We're just thinking of Happy Feet. Yeah. Happy Feet. Yeah. Of course, Of course. Happy feet's. Definitely good. Hmm. Giraffe. Oh, monkey Elephant.

Building stuff. Yeah. They look like they just have the best life. An island gorilla. Yep. But then sometimes Ireland Gorilla is my one. One Gorilla is your one. One. Even After Harambe, it's closest To a person. You know? So you're, you're, you kind of know the shape you're getting into. You're in the middle of the jungle. No one's ever out there. You're with all your people all the time. You're just surrounded by like trees and woods and other gorillas. True. There's not, you're not being hunted that much, I don't think. But you might have to fight another gorilla. And now it suck. Yeah. But it's like kind of fun, you know? Yeah. It's like big, loud, you know, it's like monstrous. It's like the closest you're gonna get to like a wrestling match in the, you know, out there that's like Yeah. It's boys would be boys. Yeah. Just you could, you know.

Yeah. Take a baby's soul. Yeah. What about, would it be cool to be Commander Biden? Basically No rules. No rules. But I feel like you, because If, you think a sheep dog would have a great life. I feel like you do all that shit at the White House. Ah. Except with the Secret Service Day. Commander Biden tried to warn us about the Secret Service. Yeah. He did his part. I think Commander Biden would suck though, because if you're a dog being in a house where it's constant people coming, showing up would suck.


That's why you bite. You Want some alone time. Yeah. Like Dogs don't really like when the doorbell rings. Yeah. White House doorbells just ringing constantly. Yeah. That would drive you nuts.

And when you go for walks, you can just get carried around in a wagon. you don't have to exercise. Yeah. Any others that we missed? I'm trying to think. Oh, I would hank a fox on a golf course.


That'd be pretty sick. Like a cute little fox foxes. They, people don't fuck with foxes. It's, they're right in that perfect zone where like, you're kind of scared of a fox, but you're not like hunting it. And I don't know, they can kind of, they can kind of be in regular like world without getting fucked with too bad. Fox would be nice. Like, being the apex. But like thinking about, I was thinking about if I wasn't, if I was the animal with all the other animals. Like, you just wanna be the biggest animal. Yeah. Or The fastest. Yeah. Or strongest Kennedy Goose on a golf course. Pretty good. No one really fucks with you there. Yeah. That's, you just have to be that you, you're An asshole. Miserable. Yeah. You're a miserable life.

He has his own parking spot. One that he could practice pulling in and out of. Get some reps in so he is not banging into other cars in the parking lot. But thanks to cars.com for setting that up while the cars.com parking spot is so helpful. Not having to battle for a spot. The cars.com, your garage feature is probably even better. I love how I can track my car's value. I can see how much it's gonna be worth in two months. I've been thinking about getting something different. Maybe knowing my car's value is beyond helpful and making that decision. Since White Sox. Dave has the cars.com parking spot this week. They'll have plenty of time to create an account with cars.com and track their cars value. White Sox. Dave got the most prized parking spot at Barstool. But we can all grab some very valuable insights into our cars value with the cars.com. Your garage feature, the parking garage is frustrating. But cars dot com's new feature. Your garage is anything but track your car's value. You get to know exactly what to expect when you're ready to sell. Track your car's value on cars.com. Shout out to our great friends over@cars.com.

Obviously last year. I want to ask one question that's difficult. It sucked how it started. Did you ever watch back the video of you with the American flag? 'cause it was badass. That was fun. Yeah, that was Fun. Did you watch that back? As Somebody who's patriotic, who sings the national anthem?


Yes. You have to respect that moment. It was a, it was like a ch nine 11 coming out with the flag. It is one of those moments where you just, you're thankful you didn't do something real stupid. Right before that. I'm thinking my dumb ass, this is my 19th season. I've never run the field with him anything. Right. Just run out there, do my low fives and move on. Right. That's an amateur move by you, by the way. Really amateur. Well, the problem is we're dealing with like, trying to get a bunch of people Yep. To Let us have space here. We've been, But I almost didn't run out there with it. Yeah, really. I saw everybody took a, I thought it was gonna be like a couple guys, like the left hack. Well the first guy introduced takes one out and maybe Garrett takes one out. So I'm like, nah, I'm not gonna do that. Then I saw everybody take one. I was like, gimme that thing, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And It was badass was awesome.


It was One of the coolest moments of my career. The Clip of like behind You, you know, 2013, the week 17 at Chicago. Right. All 2011. Chris Conti. Chris Conte. Just listen. He, he got lost. He got lost. Sometimes you get lost on The field. At what point in that play were you like, he doesn't know where he Is. It's not him. Major Wright had a a, a penalty on the play. Right. It was a illegal contact. They didn't call John Coon blocked pep, you know, had a great cut block. He had two, he had four on three on the backside. He should have got home. But once I got out, I knew It was the most wide open anyone's ever been. I don't know about that. It was pretty close, very wide open. It was pretty close. It was pretty, yeah.


It was one of those moments, like there's no way someone's standing down there. But you Know why. Right? Why? Because it's a zero blitz. Yeah. You gotta get, which means you're blitzing one more than you can protect. Right, right. You Gotta get home. The defenders play one move. So he didn't think he'd have to cover for four seconds. Yeah. It's a Greg Williams special. Dr. Heat. You're a jet now. Why are we talking about Packer's, Bearss? That you brought it up About that Up. I dunno. You wanna talk about the Jets? About we, how close were you to playing last year? Well, if we'd been, if we'd been in the hunt, I was gonna try and play. Yeah. Yeah. It healed that quick. What'd you do to, to make it heal That fast? Listen, in 20, in 2014, I played in a small circle when I ripped my calf up a couple times. And it would've been like that. It would've been shotgun and pistol and, you know, no like keepers, no hard action stuff.


It would just would've been kind of playing in a small circle. Yeah. Yeah. When you sat down with your doctor, you're like, what kind of news can you give me that I can stay in the headlines for the entire year Basically. Yeah. So we, that was mean of me. You're a jet. I like you. Yeah. That's, that's kind of, can we swear on this? Yeah. Fuck you Said. Fuck, Fuck, fuck. We got two. We got two. Two sponsors here. Yeah. No, you can say whatever the fuck you want. Okay, good. Yeah. How is Egypt? Amazing. Yeah. Amazing. Did you see the Pyramids? Yeah. All of them. Pyramids, temples. Did you find out anything about camels? The World? Yeah. I mean, you go out there, you think about the history of that place a little bit differently, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I actually want, I wanna talk to you about Egypt because there's, there's like a lot of different theories about what went on in ancient Egypt.


Like civilizations. I could have started there. Did you look into any Of that? There's a lot of interesting things about it. I mean, you go, we did all the like, other temples in Osan and Soho and different places before, and they're like floor to ceiling hieroglyphs. It's weird. You go in the pyramids, there's nothing, no hieroglyphs, no nothing really. There's also never any bodies been found. They told us there was like burial chambers and in co fu the main temple, it's the main room is the king's chamber. And there's a queen's chamber. There's no bodies ever found, there's no bodies found in ra, the second chamber or second pyramid. So that's all very strange. I think the, the fact that the stones came from a quarry, which is 300 miles away or whatever is strange. 'cause those things weighed, you know, 20 to 50 tons.


I think most of 'em, the weather of the Hinx, I'm wearing the Gram Hancock camp. As far as like that, the age of those structure is much older than they tell us. Yeah. 'cause that's like natural erosion on the sphinx. It's something that would've taken place over like thousands and thousands and thousands of years. I'd like, I mean he talks a lot about the younger dryas and, and, and going back, you know, 10,800 years I believe it is. And to me that's, it seems more in line. It's just, it's ancient. It's, it's, it's, it's an interesting country. I mean, I wouldn't maybe recommend people go in there in the summertime. Yeah. It's like one 20 in Osan. But Yeah. They also might have OTAs. Yeah. But you could get had to, those could get excuse for that. Yeah. I Don't, some people could. Yeah.


I'm sure. Was that a problem? Was that a problem With, What was it, was there a problem that it was unexcused? Oh, I don't know. I mean, I'm sure I'll get fined for that, but Yeah. The thing that I think people don't understand is that when, when I was in the NFC North and playing for that team years ago, there used to be a real thing called Minicamp, where it was, you had one of 'em usually, sometimes it was right after the draft, but either way it was five practices in three days. Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So two practices on Friday, two on Saturday, one on Sunday. Now it's not Minic camp. They, they can arbitrarily put a tag on whatever week of OTAs they want. Yeah. So this is the mini camp week, which makes it somehow more mandatory than the other weeks.


But this, it's, it was an OTA schedule. That's how it's, you know how words can be a little deceiving from time to time. You can make a story outta the fact that I missed a mini camp when it was really two OTA days. Right. Interesting. That came to the first 10. Right. So this is a media thing And you would never like change the meaning of a word or deliberately tell people one Thing. No, of course not. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I have Your back. Well, I mean, you want to go into the etymology of, of, of words at this point. Yeah. Actually, what do you wanna do? Yeah, no, I'd love that. Yeah. I'm just saying I have your back. Yeah. I'm your protector now. I'm, I'm, I'm all, I want you to have nothing but success with the Jets. Listen, if the Bears can't win a Super Bowl, you winning a Super Bowl for the Jets would make me happy. Okay.


Seriously. All right man. I appreciate because then I could just be like, I kind of remember him as a jet. That's what I tell everyone. I love that. And I could just erase 15 years out of my brain. I that and it would be great. Okay. Alright. Cool. And then would you go, would you go in the Hall of Fame as a Jet If? you won two Super Bowls. Yeah. You win two in New York. You Have to. You'd have to. You got to. I think gotta Respect. You Have to. You have to. Now I'm rooting for two. Yeah. Now I'm rooting for two. Has he? That'd be so mean. Is it a little different, like talking about the media going to New York, can you feel a difference between the New York media and the Green Bay Media? I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, there's, there's more beat writers in New York. You know, I've always felt like I had good relationships with, you know, a lot of the members in, in Green Bay.


but it wasn't like, they weren't media's media. They're trying to get a story and, and they're the worst. Well, I don't know about that. There stink. There's some, there's a few good ones in there. Name one good person that owns a microphone. That owns a microphone. Yeah. Pat McAfee. Yeah, That's true. We love Pat those boys. That's a fact. Yeah, that's a Fact. He paid you to say that though. Yeah, I guess he did. Yeah, He definitely Did. Exactly what it's, you became like Mr. New York when you moved. I loved that. That's such a good time. That's why I was so heartbreaking. Yeah. To play fucking foreplay, but Yeah. Yeah. You didn't complete a pass though. So maybe I didn't throw a pick either. But maybe you were gonna have a bad season. Think about that. Maybe you were never gonna complete a pass that season.


Imagine that. That's true. So like, that might have saved you. That would been wild. Yeah. It's like Aaron. Rodgers is, we're in week 10 and Aaron Rodgers has yet to complete a pass. What are you saying? I'm just saying this is, I'm using a spin zone that's, yeah. Like this is actually, I like how positive you're spinning all this stuff. That's fantastic. It might've been a good thing. Now you're, it might have been. Yeah, It Might have been. You just gotta recalibrate that whole experience. It's like, it's a blessing sometimes, you know? Yeah. Like you learn, I'm sure you learn some things during the season, not being able to play a Lot. Yeah. Being on the headset, listening to all the crazy things that get set on there. Yeah. That's wild. Nathaniel Hackett making a lot of like gold member references. Not many. A few from time to time. There weren't a lot of things to be excited about. Our, our Red Zone percentage was pretty low.


And our Yeah. Points per game and other things. Yeah. What, where do you live in New York? You live in New Jersey? Yeah. Nobody lives in New. Yeah, You can live In New York. If, you're a giant. You can, but still, I don't know why you would just 'cause the traffic into a tunnel and Yeah. Yeah. All of our stuff we're, I joke about, I know that stadium used to be on Long Island and, but we're the New Jersey jets. Yeah. So are the Giants. Yeah. The Giants play in New Jersey. There's Only one team that plays in New York. Yeah. It's a Buffalo Bills. Bills mafia. Yeah. Bills mafia. Yeah. You guys, I mean the Jets, people forget the Jets won week one, right? Yeah. One Oh, as a starter. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's also a great point. Yeah. Highest winning percentage ever. Ever. For The Jets. Jets Legend. Jet. You've never lost Jet. Jet.


Salty about, you know, like the, the 13 game against the Chicago where we're ahead three. Nothing when McClellan, you know, landed on me and I was, he was just making a football play. Yeah, I was. That was just a Go. But I got the L for that. Yeah. I was outta the game. We're ahead. I celebrated that it should be a win. That's so hard Win. Was That the one where you, Why do you celebrate people fucked? Because You ruined my life and it's like, he's hurt, he's done, he's never coming back. And then every time you get hurt, I mean remember week one Now you're, you've, you've caught me in the trap week one when you were I was, yeah. When the Bears, when Khalil Mac debuted and it was like, this is awesome. And the Bears are awesome. My favorite all time clips hurt. Yeah. Yeah. And then that was fun. That was a good comeback. I knew we were gonna win that one. But my favorite all time clip that I've seen is gotta be you at the Detroit game.


Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean that was, I was literally doing it as a support thing for Detroit Don in Superfan. I was there for the M championship, which was Friday night. And I was like, let's just go to this game and root against Rogers found their tickets, got a seat next to him. I was like, I'm here for your support. Like, fuck this guy, let's beat him. And then it's Hail Mary right in their face. Yeah. And they just, and the way they were talking before, and I do the same thing. Crazy. But Detroit Don was saying that he did the calculations and he's like, once we win this game, there's like an 80% chance we're going to the playoffs. And I think the lines were like five and six or something. So the, you just crushed everything Then? No, it was, yeah. What was it? We were, we were six and three and they were four and five.


Four and five. Yeah. So they were like three and six. Yeah. And he's like, once we win this game, 'cause it was like mid third quarter, they're like, I've done the calculations. Like, we're gonna win this game. They're gonna win next week. Then I was like, Sounds like a Bears fan. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I sat there and I was like, yeah. Go. Go Guys. You guys, you guys always feel good about your team though. That's every year. That's every year. Every year. This is our year. That's Football. That's what football is. Bad Jets fans feel the same way. Been Trestman maybe one Of those years. The second year of Trestman got a little not great. And John Fox, it was not Who's Your favorite all time Bears quarterback? I mean, it's Jay. It's actually Kyle Orton, but Jay as well. I love Kyle Orton. Kyle, I think Kyle Orton. Kyle. Like Kyle Orton doesn't get enough credit for like, dude got the ball out fast. You Kyle beat me on three different teams.


No way. Chicago. Yeah. He ended our 13 or 19 game win streak in 2011 when he was in Kansas City. Yep. And 14, he was in Buffalo. Yeah. Remember when he just retired? He just like, he gets the ball out. He just drove away. He was like, I'm done. He, Yeah. He's just like, I Have You ever gone out with him? Had No, but I want to so bad. He's a great dude. He's just a dude's dude. Yeah. Like when he just Yeah, he's the Guy's guy. He's great. Like Pft said, he just, he told the media, he was like, yeah, I gotta go get something from my car. And he just never came back really? Week 18. Week 18 or week 17. Then the season ended and he hadn't said if he was gonna retire or not. And they're like, Hey Kyle, we have a couple questions after the game. And he's like, yeah, lemme just grab something outta my truck.


Drove off. Retired, never came back. I love that. Pretty sick. Isn't that's Incredible. I know that's, that's Kylen the best way to retire. It's like low key, but it also makes people respect you more afterwards. Barry Sanders did something like that. I feel like Calvin Johnson didn't have a big, a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. He just went off. Are you Cutler? Are You gonna do that? Yeah. Jay. Yeah. Hey, he was on the Dolphins. Yeah. That was awesome. He had that, he got, he had a couple moments. That was a, that was like a quiet quitting. He go down to Miami for a little bit. Just kidding. That's A thing now, right? That's that's a young person thing. Yeah. You just kind stop working. Adam Gates paid him like $10 million. No, the quiet quitting part. Yeah. Yeah. Hank quite quit like three years ago. Yeah. Nice. But he's still around. Smart. Yeah. Just slowly quiet. Quit. So what, what, what do you think about the Jets this year? I always like our chances. You sound like a Bears fan.


Yeah. Jets fans are probably as tormented as Bears Fans. Yeah. Yeah. I would say so. It's a different level of Torment. Yeah. 'cause the Bears have been in the playoffs Right. At least once in the last 13 years. Right. The, It's kinda kinda the same like what you did to Chicago. That's what Tom Brady did to Yeah. To New York. Is it the, and now you are just traveling around just trying to continue that, that hatred Of, of what Well you're just trying to, you're now you're trying to take over Boston, but you stole big cat's Joy. I'm definitely, you stole big cat's joy for like a decade. You made him significantly less happy. Yeah. That's, that's, we always say that that's like the next level of athlete If. you become the thief of joy. Yeah. Like Mahomes has reached that level where, you know, like if you're a Bills fan or you're a Niners fan, you're like, this guy has just ruined it for me.


You did that to me. That's the, that's the like elite quarterback then thief of joy above That. Well thank you. Yeah. You, you hit that. You definitely hit that. I appreciate that. Portnoy's gotta be riding kind of high right now. Right? Why? 'cause he's got a dog that's like a billionaire. Yeah. That and the Celtics. Oh Yeah. He's happy about that. Hank was on the, on the duck boat with Joe, miss Missoula. Oh really? The coach of the Celtics. What was that? He personally invited him. That's Yeah. Joe Coach is pouring beer on Hank's head. It was great. He basically won a championship. It's pretty insane. That ring. Yeah. He's like Kramer going the Tony's when seat fell. Yeah. Yeah. That was essentially what it was. He just got ushered off and he is like, I'm just part of the Celtics now. Alright, so Congrat. What? Congrat. Yeah.

How much does training camp suck? Like it has to, if you're, if you've been in the league for a really long time, it's like I know what to do. It's a different suck. Back when football was hard, you know, long time ago when there's real double days. Yeah. Physically it was the worst, but mentally it wasn't, I don't feel like it was as bad just physically.


You were just, now it's all mental. Yeah. You're sitting around all day long in, you know, interesting meetings in The hot days. Yeah. Yeah. And the practice is short. It's not even that hard. Yeah. And you don't play in pre-season. We used to play in pre-season. Right. You know, we, we'd play, we'd like play, you know, 15 plays then a quarter and a half, then into the third quarter. Yeah. You know, now you don't even play in the preseason. You Should play in the preseason this year. Why? Why not just take, make football hard again? Aaron Rodgers is making football hard again.

The Secret service agent, he said he's the one that, that put that bullet on the gurney. Well, yeah. That's obvious. And he said that he, he grabbed no, he said he found it in the back of the limo. Meaning it was like one of the deflection shots. It wasn't the magic bullet that they said that it was. What A great bullet that was. Yeah. Well, they said, I Mean, how can, It's like you're passing technology in, in Dallas. That was not real. That one on the sideline. Yeah. It kind of curved back. Yeah.

Yeah. And then they reverse Course they did a reverse course a little bit. Actually. People are unfair to Aaron. Rodgers. I've always been consistent with you. Oh, I don't care about that. I, Politics I've said from the beginning is an absolute sham. Yeah. And if we've seen anything, whether it's you talking about what they did to Bernie Sand in 2016 that we saw in the Podesta emails or the fact that nothing really ever changes, nothing changes. All they do is just talk about, well, what they're gonna do. And then nothing. Life doesn't actually get better for any of us, whether it's a Republican or a Democrat. And we're still just doing the same fucking two party system and not letting Bobby get in or anybody else. Yeah. PFT and I always said, If, you want to be president, you should be disqualified. I like that. Yeah. That's, it's basically an egomaniac. You have to be a psycho to want to be president. Right. And to actually like, follow Through that.


But just some common sense politics, some common sense. Like, let's not let anybody over 75 and the Packers have a rule. Yeah. 70. You gotta retire. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You go into a board of ERUs, it's 70, you gotta retire. Yeah. That seems to make pretty good sense. You Know what, you know what they used to do in ancient Greece was they had this thing called sortition. Where Is they chopped their nuts Off. No, they probably did that back then too. Yeah. but it was more along the lines of like a lottery to see who was gonna be the, the mayor or the governor. And so it could be anybody. Like they just randomly gave to somebody. Which is kind of terrifying because there's, It's terrifying in today's world. A lot of weirdos out there. But at the same time, yeah. It made them really focus on their education system because like any of these psychos could end up being Right.


President. But how about term limits? Yeah. Yeah. How about you can insider trade? I love that Dave's jumped on on board with that. Yeah. Those apps, they track. Like, you can track Nancy Pelosi's. Yeah. She's a hell of a stock trader. It's crazy. I don't know what Davy Doing from Wall Street. I dunno what Davey Day trader's doing. He should be fucking following the old Nancy. Seriously? Yeah. It's, it's insane. Nancy's got it down. Agree. It's embarrassing though. It's embarrassing for our country. And it's also embarrassing. Like, I know we're getting deep into it, but it's, it's embarrassing that people can't, there's no one who can just have like the common sense approach that like, don't, not everything has to be one or the other. There's a lot of middle that no one ever knowledge. But the is the loudest. The loudest people is the 10%. Right. And There's a But 5% on both sides. Yeah. The most of the country. You travel around the country. You guys do all the time. It's regular guys, fucking great people.


Right. Who don't, you just want to kind of be left alone. They want their freedoms. They don't wanna be told what to do with their bodies. They don't wanna be fucking taxed. Crazy percentage. You know? And they're not looking for a bunch of handouts. They Just want to be Happy. Just wanna be kind of Yeah. Happy and left alone for the most part. Yeah. I think stand outta politics is probably a good choice. Just 'cause you have to answer for everything. It's like when, when that article came out about Bobby, where it's like he's got a barbecued dog behind him. There would've been people like asking you, like, do you support eating dogs? And you'd have to say, I do not support eating dogs. And they'd be like, why are you even addressing That stuff? Well, they're, they're scared of people that can't control. True. That's, that is a fact. That is a confirmed Fact. The media in general is scared of people that can't control. Yeah. Yeah. Which that's, you're Kind of, that's why, you know, to talk about your company, you know, like that's why those bullshit articles would come out all the when the earnings.


Earnings Every time. Yeah. Every single time. Why? Because They, because Dave and you guys built this brand that can't be controlled. Right. That we don't have. And you try and then you try and get after 'em. You don't have, you know, the women part and Oh, no, no, we have wom woman, CEO or this thing or that thing. It's just like people that they, that they can't truly control are dangerous people. They, They've hopped on every single like angle to try to take us down throughout the years. It's literally just gone from like one thing to the next. And it's just like, all right, we're still here. It's so un it's, I would say the majority of 'em too are so unethical. Yeah. Oh Yeah. Like the practices now is just, it is a fucking joke. Yeah. It's, and that's politics. There's bias in all of it. Right. Which is should be journalism Us.


And then you get back to the, the core of what the hell's going on right now. We have a guy who's been, you know, whether rightly or wrongly, a kangaroo court or whatever, been indicted on felonies and a guy who's shit in his pants. It's Pretty good. And then we got Bobby who doesn't give a chance to even be in the, in debates. Yeah. And If, you knew the insights about how ridiculous it is for a third party candidate to get on the ballots. Oh yeah. In 50 states. It's a fucking sham. Yeah. Like I, it's certain colors in some states it's certain person, people you gotta submit it to. In other states, there's certain amount of votes in certain states. It's a fucking joke. I Feel like it used to be easier. Back in the day, Ross Perot was always running. Yeah, No, he was a real, he was on the debate stage. Yeah. When we were kids. Yeah. No, it's, it's crazy.


It's crazy. So football. Yeah. Who do you like this year? I like us The Jets. Yeah. And who? You gotta play somebody in the Super Bowl. Bears. Not the bears You. That would ruin you. Why? Oh, that would, that'd be a great way to go out. Wouldn't be True. I actually don't know if I'd be able to handle that game because there'd just be so much at Stake. That would ruin you. It would ruin me. Yeah. That would ruin me. I would be surprised if the bears were there. That's not a disrespectful thing to say, but like I would too. The NFC Is Would be surprised as Well. The NFC is tough And you have a rookie, rookie quarterback. Yeah. I think he could do it. Yeah. I think they surround him with a lot of really good pieces. Yeah. But I think in their division on paper, can you not say that they're not, you can't say they're better than third on paper in the division.


I think I would, I think I would say that objectively I Can, I can say whatever I want. Objectively want. Yeah. Objectively you think that they're better on paper than Detroit and Green Bay. I think they're better than Green Bay Paper. Really? On paper. Paper. We're talking about on paper. I'm talking about paper. You're, I dunno what paper you're using in Chicago. We're Talking about paper Tainted by that. That No, I, I'd agree with you. We have, listen, We're unproven. I gave you how much time do you Yeah, We're we're, we're done in a second. We're unproven. We're unproven. But I love, I love that Ryan Polls has, it feels like they've built team. You're a big Ryan Polls fan. Huge Ryan Polls. Even though he shined you. We, We've, you guys were doing a, let's FaceTime the person on the phone. You wanna FaceTime and see who picks up. And I fucking picked up Back Ari. I was like, yeah. I was like, let's FaceTime Rogers 'cause we're gonna be in Tahoe.


Try to get him on. He's like, no problem. He's like, but you have to FaceTime poles and try and just say that you, you're with me. He didn't want a job with the Bears, but he, I was like, I wanna watch you try to get me on the Bears and Poles didn't pick up. Yeah. So Yeah, that sucked. He kind of did what you do to me.


Alright, last question 'cause I know you gotta go Rollback. Question R-H-O-B-A-C k.com. We're in it right now. Rollback Polos. They got QIPs hoodies. Joggers shorts. Rollback dot com. Promo code.

No he didn't. Oh, okay. That's awesome. You just remembered that and you just brought, I've been in the league 20 years. Yeah. You, you're a quarterback when you're 12, Which is also the funny part when people are like, did you play, did you play with against Steve Young and John Elway? I was like, I was in high school when they retired. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.


Alright. But speaking of that, how many more years? I don't know. I'm not sure. This one for sure. This One for Sure.

Rainbow Body. Yeah. Was it Aaron Rodgers ever real? Yeah. Just I'll be happy to say no. This Is a simulation. So what is, what is exactly What are talking about? No, you're right. You're right about that. I think it actually is a simulation. Yeah. It's gotta be right. I don't know. Mathematically think About it got throw to Mathematically. What time of math? Terrence Howard Math or Terrence Howard. Math one times one is two.


Do you know math? Yeah. Is it weird that you went to Cal? Yeah. That is weird. Yeah. What's eight times five? I don't know. Do you know calculus? Not really. I wasn't good at calculus. Never been in the same room as Calculus, algebra, geometry. Yeah. Fantastic. Me And calculus have never met. I don't even, I don't even If. you showed me. People are using calculus today. Show of hands. Nobody. They've Got calculus. Wow. This is not exactly the greatest point. It's The swath of the population here. Okay. We are the bottom of the barrel when it comes to that shit. But still none of us. Yeah, None of us. That's true. Yeah. You get they they have, they have machines that can do that. You got calculators here. Computers, ai. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. What are we doing? What Happens when AI takes over though? Bad. Yeah. I actually think we're, we're probably the only ones that are safe.


You probably are fucked. How come? I don't know if ai AI's Gonna go taking the strong ones out to start. No, They're just gonna be. Yeah, that might be true. Can AI do a podcast? Yeah. No, I Don't think so. I Don't think so. Can AI play quarterback? Yes. Yeah. Probably AI drink Ayahuasca. Good point. You could probably code ayahuasca somehow The virus. So we're all safe. Yeah, we're good. These guys are all fucked. Yeah. No chance. They're editing and everything. That's all ai. The thing about us, I feel, I feel like we're too dumb to have AI take our job. Like you can't train AI to be this stupid. Right. It would break. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I Don't know about about that. Like how do you say to ai? Like intentionally fuck up facts all the time.


Just like program it with like, I don't know the current state of our politics. Intelligence level. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Or just use our brains. Maybe they we're the model for the dummy ai. Are You smarter than, than Joe Biden or not? I would say yes at this point. Really? Yeah. I would say so. Probably. Nice. Probably. Yeah. Probably. I haven't shit my pants in. I think it's been a year and a half. It's been about six months for me. That's good. Which is pretty good. That's good. Yeah. I'm definitely not smarter than Hunter. That guy rocks. I don't sniff any hair. He just Figured a lot of stuff out. Yeah. How to make money. Painting. Yeah. I would like to party with Hunter I think for one night. Maybe six hours. Six hours with Hunter. Yeah. Yeah. Get outta his life. There's Some gerbils in there or something.

Okay, let's wrap up the show before we do these quotes. So memes made a mistake Oh no. In the Aaron Rodgers Interview. Oh no. And I didn't realize it in real time, otherwise I would've helped him. Yeah. I thought it was just a very awkward question that he asked. He asked Aaron Rogers if he would play more than four plays this year, or if he would play five plays this plays this year. It kind of was weird. We all were like, what's going on here? Memes forgot to say the part. Where will you play five plays this year? Because If, you don't. I'm going to have to strap a bomb to my chest and go bomb. NFL headquarters. Yeah. Memes famously made that promise. Yeah. A couple months ago. And that was the context for the question.


Yeah. So You that, Because it sounded like you were like being a Dick Jets fan, but in reality you were just trying to save your own life. Yeah. I was just mainly just trying to ask questions if he's gonna play. 'cause all I know is five snaps. Yeah. But I, I should have referenced the bomb. Yeah. The bomb would've been good there, but it was a good interview. You did good memes. Yeah. All questions but the one awkward One. Yeah. But you did a good job. I was, I was proud of you. That was your first time asking questions in an interview, right? Yeah. First time ever. Wow. And I asked I and one question with the quarterback, just everybody's hand size. Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. Okay. You wanna read these quotes? They're great. PFD, let's hear 'em.


Do you see 'em? I did not see 'em. Oh, I love it. So we'll get your honest reaction. Okay. Okay. Go ahead Hank. You go first. Yeah. I woke up to this one on on Saturday and I was like, this is just fake. Like I, I scrolled by a, a buck crack sports tweet. It said this is from Legion Hoops via the New York Times. Joel Embiid on, if he has any doubts, team USA will win the gold medal. You look at the talent that the US has, but there's equal talent on other teams and the talent that's on the US team. You also got to understand most of these guys are older. The LeBron now is not the LeBron. That was a couple of years ago. So it's a big difference. Everybody would also tell you, and you can see for yourself the athletic LeBron dominant that he was a couple years ago is not the same that he is now.


I think people get fooled by the names on paper. But those names have built throughout their career and now they're older. They not what they used to be. Mm. Okay. Those Are His Teammates. Yep. They're his teammates And a very accomplished teammate who's been to has LeBron. Oh. So, oh, So now we LeBron stands on this show. No, I just, I was gonna ask question. LeBron stands on on Show. I was gonna ask a question. I was gonna ask a question. Hank, has LeBron ever been to a conference finals? A lot. A lot of 'em. I think a lot. A lot. So is like all of them basically. Yeah. Maybe Joel Amida just, he's shocked because he's never been on a team with this much talent before. Yeah. No, I think he's saying this team sucks. It's interesting.


Interesting move. He's playing on such a good team. He is like, eh, we're not that good. Yeah. Interesting move for, for a new American. Yeah. Max If. You're in that locker room and you see your teammates head about you and and your team leader. What would you Well I, that was a quote taken out of context. We, you didn't watch the full thing. What was the context? I Don't know. I did read the article that he had in the New York Times. It did make sense. He said that Cameroon is home and if Cameroon had made it to the Olympics, he would've been on Team Cameroon. He was deciding between France and us. France put like a time limit on him. Us was like, Hey, let us know.


And he was like, I, I'm picking us. So he did make that clear. So it wasn't like he, he was very clear about that. But he also said in this one, essentially without freak injuries, he'd be in the goat conversation. Anthony Edwards says shit like that all the time. And you're like, oh, Anthony Edwards is so great. I Don't think he's, well, Anthony Edwards, if Anthony Edwards said that 10 years into his career without getting to a conference final, I'd probably be like, that's crazy. Also, I don't think Anthony Edwards has ever had the type of injuries that Joelle and Beat has had. Yeah. But you do see the difference. So you're backing up Joelle beat's point. No, No, no, No. I know. I'm saying Anthony Edwards would never say that because he hasn't had those injuries. Yeah. He wouldn't say freak injuries.


You understand that If Anthony Edwards in 10 years time, if he hasn't won anything and he was like, I'm the goat. Don't you want guys, you want your guys to have confidence. You, you every, Yeah, I guess. But he doesn't have confidence. Your fan team. You should think that your best players, he Doesn't though. Because he's talking, he gonna get hurt. And he is Talking about LeBron. He doesn't have confidence in his team. This isn't, this isn't Max. You guys can't No. Max is short circle. You guys, this is such bullshit because all you guys ever do is just shit on LeBron shit on LeBron. He's a piece of shit. And then the one time that like it comes against me, you're like, oh, LeBron. Like he's the fucking best You might be right.


I can't believe anyone would ever say this about LeBron. You might be right. I Don't even think about it like LeBron. Like it's not personally. That's exactly what you think about. It could have been any teammate. It could have been anyone on this Team. Well, he did say, and the other guys on the team have built their reputations off what they have been, not what they are right now. You might be right now, you might be right Matt. He said that his Teammates are not what they used to be. Lemme Try something different than Max from this article. Okay. We're we're just hopping around. I think Joel MB just needs to, my motto is never tell anyone outside the family what you're thinking again. Yeah. Keep it in the family. Let me, let me, let me ask you this one. He said quote, the best cheese steak is subway cheese steak Tro l mb. He's A big Jared fan.


That's a Great troll. He said, I don't eat cheese steaks. And the, and the reporter said, you don't eat cheese steaks. He said, no. You want to know the real answer. The best cheese steak is subway cheese steak. It is good troll. It's a great troll. Could you imagine Bryce Harper saying something like that? Max? Yeah. I mean, Abbi's a funny guy. I actually did come, come out of this interview liking him more. 'cause he was, you know, he's been through a lot and it was like, it was a good interview. I wanna make one thing clear. I have nothing against Joellen Bead. I like, I think he's a funny guy actually. You just have something against me. No, IDI love how mad he makes you. There's certain people out there and certain things are just, I only see them through the lens now of being pressure points on Max's body where I can press the Joel m bead button and get Max worked up about it.


I can press the second place button, get you worked up about it. There's a lot of things. So I appreciate him for that. But I do think he's a good guy. Yeah. And I think he's, he's great guy. Funny. And he's intentionally troll sometimes. I respect that. Like I could see him posting a black and white steak photo and being like perfect stake. I like this guy. It Does sound like he likes subway cheese Steaks. So he might, yeah. Yeah. I I, I like the interview. It was a good interview. He's been bawling. Not really, but that's fine. It's preseason. Well, it's, I mean it's, he will baw. It's preseason. He's calling Out his team. It's all made such bullshit that they, this is a personal thing. What, how, why are they playing four hours away from Paris?


It's Paris Olympics. Oh. 'cause you want to go To Europe. I wanted to go to the Europe. Yeah. I wanted to go to the games. It's four hours away. Have you ever seen how the Olympics work though? Take a Train. Oh man. I'll, I'll pay for you to go. I, yeah, Go. I can't. I'll pay for you to go. 'cause imagine if Max got to see Joan be getting a freak injury. Where? In fucking France. Where are they Playing? I don't know. I just, Because I went to go If. you saw that would be the most max thing ever. If he, if he was out for the year with in Max was watching him in France. You just have to point, you wouldn't be able to come back. You'd have to stay there. Yeah, I would choose to stay there. Yeah. You'd look good in a beret.


Oh, we should get some, can we get a couple max? You know? Yeah. Baguettes. Yeah. I'll tell you what, for sure. The, the baguettes in France. I can't wait. They are so much better than the shit we eat here. It's insane. You just become, I remember I went to France for like 10 days. It just became like two o'clock would hit and be like, time to eat an entire baguette. I just want to eat bread and cheese. Oh that's like, I don't want to go to any nice rest. I'm going to but It in The water. The only thing I just want bread and cheese, Something in the water, Bread, cheese. The wine is good. Oh, by the way, the, oh, one last thing about the Rogers interview. I know we got into the JFK conversation. I wish I had seen the fact that his driver was the one who shot him before.


Before that, before we interviewed Rogers. And Obviously we taped that before the Trump assassination thing. We did. And Joe Biden dropping obviously. Did you see the, the video of the driver shooting him? Did we watch it on? Yeah, but you saw it. You've been converted. I mean that's just not a real video. Okay. But I don't wanna talk to you anymore then. Alright. Numbers 23 12 8 42 56. Hank. I'm starting to get that thing where people just DM me strategies of how to get the number and like, it's so fucking annoying because there's no strategy. It's a random number generator, but there's no way you're actually Gonna know what Well, they're actually thinking about it.


Actually, there is a strategy. You can just pick the right number, which all of us pretty much in this room have done basically. Basically 99, put 21. This feels like a 99 day. 35. Oh, 35 Cmax. You should have picked 35. Yeah. Yep. That's an easy strategy. Try the one through a hundred.
