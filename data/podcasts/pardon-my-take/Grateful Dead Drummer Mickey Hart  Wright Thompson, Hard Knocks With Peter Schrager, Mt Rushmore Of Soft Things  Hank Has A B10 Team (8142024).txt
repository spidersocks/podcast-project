Today is Wednesday, August 14th. And the Jets have a problem. Is it a problem? It could be a problem. Do You think it's a problem? Is it a problem when you trade for a guy? Mm. And then he just never shows up. Well, so Hassan Reddick, who was traded for by the Jets, is at an impasse with the Jets because according to Hassan Reddick, they agreed to a new deal. The Jets are saying if they will only do a deal, a new deal, once Reddick shows up to camp. And Reddick is saying he won't show up to camp until there's a new deal. So they're at an impasse. They Gotta meet meet on the Jersey Turnpike.


This is why you, you hold in, you don't hold out. I Actually was, that's What they did with Dur Durrell Revis. Yeah. Back when Hard Knocks was going with the Jets a long time ago, he was holding out, they met at like a diner. Well, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They should do, the Jets should just run a training camp practice from Hassan Redick's backyard. Yeah. And see if he shows that. Just Bring it to His house. Well, the problem is, I think he might be in Tokyo today. Oh. Or at least he posted something on Instagram that made it look like he was in Tokyo. Either Way, it is high time for the Florio's of the world out there. The RACIs, our guy memes, diehard Jets fan is very upset. And I don't think he has a gripe other than it feels like the Jets are not handling this correctly.


Well, When, when memes doesn't like the news, he blames the reporter. It's like if your house gets hit by a tornado, you blame the weatherman. The, The, the phrase Don't shoot the messenger. Shoot. The message just never has come into memes. His brain. I'm kind of with memes on that one. Oh, of course. Because because you don't ha you can't shoot a message. Yeah. Someone gets you bad news. You hate that person, You shoot that person. Right. That's what we Do I. I looked it up. And. it looks like Hassan Reddick. He's, he's scheduled to make 14.25 million in base pay. He's missed 15 days of training camp, which means he's accumulated $850,000 in mandatory fines. Oh no. And 300,000 in discretionary fines. Now for every week that he misses, he's gonna miss that week's game check as well.


Oh no. Which is one 17th of the 14.25 million. So he owes, he owes the Jets over a million dollars right now for skipping work. Can you imagine if we find people for missing podcasts? Mm. Can you imagine how much money we would make? Big Cat? We'd Make a lot of money. Something To, something to think about. But this dude hates work so much that he's, he's willing to pay a million dollars. Sounds Like they should trade him to the Bears memes. Yo, your thoughts. So yesterday I was pretty fired up yesterday. This morning? Yesterday. Count today. All of today. Yeah. That was calm. That was Calm, man. Oh, that was calm fired up when you told the Fuck off anything in the past was yesterday. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah.


This Morning you're like my 3-year-old memes. Where, where she's like, yeah, I fell yesterday. And she's talking about a month ago. Yeah. I've calm, I've calmed down since this morning. Okay. Not really. And no, it is the Jet's Fault. That's, that was my first conclusion. Oh, But also Flo and Rossini, because they Yeah. That Told you. Yeah, she's, she's full blown Florio of the year. Wait, did you say she's full of blown? No. Full blown. Full blown Flo. She's full blown Heard. Full blown. She's full blown. But also full blown. No, full blown. She's assistant Florio. Oh shit. That's a mean thing. You can say. Damn. Okay, so L'Oreal, What are you gonna do?


Can you give him to the Bears? No. So I don't think he's going anywhere. Trade Him back to the Eagles. Flip him distressed asset Memes was getting to the point today where he was just yelling other players' names and being like, take him. No, you should, you should take that other player. Hank. Hank knows. Yeah. Hank what? Do you have any players that are in contract disputes? Matthew Juno. Oh, you Juno. Okay. All right. And how's that going? They're working it out. Okay. Him and Mayo were on the sidelines having a, a nice conversation. Seemed friendly and, and good. Yeah. Friendly and good. I think he'll be on the Patriots. Okay. I think they're friendly. I dunno if they're good, Friendly and good.


He'll be, he will. This is the off season. This is how it goes in the preseason. You know, you gotta you gotta negotiate it. It sometimes, you know, takes a little while, but the Patriots, unlike the Jets, are a, you know, classy organization. They're gonna figure it out. I can't really say the same for the Jets. Yeah. The Jets probably won't Get it. Something seems weird where they traded for the guy. And usually when that happens, you negotiate at least the, the outline of what the terms of the new contract are gonna be once you get there. The whole point of trading for him is, you know, he's gonna sign the new contract. It's Like when, when Chicago got Montez sweat. Correct. From the football team. They had a deal in place and then they executed it. It's not just like a one year rental for the Jets. I feel like it, I don't know if it's on the Jets, if it's on his agent or both.


Maybe both. Maybe both. Or Flora and Reini. I'm gonna call her Reini real quick. 'cause she needs to respond to allegations that she's assistant Florio. That is, that are some heavy allegations. Hank, I'm really proud of you for knowing Matthew Jude's contract issues. Thank you. We had a debate whether you would know what the fuck, what do you mean? I'm locked in? Yeah. That's why they call you Lockwood. I watched more preseason football last week than my entire life before this. Really? Yeah. One game, Like three quarters. Yeah. That's big time. Yeah. Memes might be right. Yeah. She's probably on the phone with none of her sources. Voicemail Is busy talking to no one.


I brought, I said this to memes yesterday. I was like, oh yeah, we'll take us on Reddick back for a sixth round pick. And he was like, no. That his value would be way higher now than what we traded him for. No. Legitimately thought. You think He's he's gone up. Yes. Like he was like, he was gone up. He Was like, we would get more back than what we gave You. Yeah. I don't think that's how it works. Memes. It might players go down. You should teach a finance course. It might. It might. Okay. So memes, you gotta get that figured out. 'cause I don't want, I don't want you to be grumpy memes. And this feels like we need to just get 'em on the field. Right. It's Supposed to be positive. Just pay him the, the salary cap is not real. That's a fact point. General Saints have taught us that many, many times. Just Give them the money. You have like one, maybe two years of Aaron Rogers.


Just give him money. Let's have a good season. Yeah. Just make Another Vaccine. Stop. The fuck. Does that mean Johnson And Johnson? He's right. Yeah. We're About to get another pandemic. I heard that. Let's get another pandemic. Bird flu. All the pass rushers. You want Bird flu's happening recently? Nice point. Eh, That's what Hassan Reddick has when he doesn't play after leaving the Eagles. Oh, I love, I I I forget how much Hank can just exist and get in under memes. His skin when it comes to the Jets. Yeah. Listen or anything. Listen or anything. We, We, we hate on Hank a lot. A lot of it is deserved. But you have to appreciate the fact that when Hank is going up against somebody else, it's awesome.


Yeah. We did the, we we were, we were doing stuff today and we, we did the, we had a little downtime and we did the Mt Rushmore of reasons why Hank can't exist. And what were some of the things we came up with? It was speaking or not speaking. Yawning. You've gotten in trouble for both being hungry. Being hungry, golfing, having Any hobbies, any hobbies, anything that outside of work that I, any, any activity. Well, If your hobby was work, then I wouldn't No one's hobby is work. No. Sometimes you get mad at him for, for doing Work as well. Yes. Yes. Really? Yes. When I ask you to, when I ask you work questions, you get mad at me. Yeah. Well, you also trapped me in a conference call this morning. Yeah. That only fact or fiction. That's the only way to do it. And he said to me this morning, he is like, Hey, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ride with you.


And I get in the car and he just goes, oh, by the way, we have a conference call that I added you to starts in two minutes. And Then he sold. And I know I couldn't go anywhere. Liking music. Liking music, liking. Yeah. Yeah. You've been on his ass for liking Billy Strings? Well, no. It's just funny. It's the only musician I've ever heard Hank name. I think he only knows one musician. That's Not true. Name another musician. Gucci Mane. Oh, Nice. Okay. Fair. What else? There's Dressing nice. Yeah. Yeah. Or well, just dressing no matter how you Dressing. We said being hungry. Yeah. Or Just thinking about thinking about anyone else. Like thinking like, You always think about other people Being heartfelt towards you guys.


You guys get mad at me for that. Yeah. Because it's always, it's never ulterior motives. That's not true. That's what I'm saying. You're always thinking about other people's That's point proven. Right. Waking up early to work out or sleeping in too late to not work. Yep. You can't exist. Yeah. Sleeping or waking, you're not allowed to do. Yeah, Exactly. Now you guys are seeing Yeah, no, it's tough. It's tough being you. I apologize for, for getting on your case act. Yeah. It's All right. Yeah. You're a great guy. I'm sorry. Cross. I have to bear. You do Exist. Yeah. Is that the expression? Yeah. Vacations. Yeah. If. you think you're Jesus. That's okay. Not taking vacations. Yeah. Wanting to get, you know, wanting to relax. Right. Illegal. Yeah. Illegal. And then not relaxing.


Illegal. And Then when I'm Yeah, when you guys, when you're up Up, yeah. Right. Taking your medicine, not taking your medicine. Right. Either Way. Both suck for us. Yeah. People, I hope people are understanding like this is, is what truly what I have to deal with truly. Right. But also it kind of works against you because we just described every part of your being is annoying In your mind, But Yeah. No, Then you're like, think I you around more, which is my entire point. I Do, I. Love Having you around. It's like, how, which one is it? Which one is It? I love having you around. I Think both sides keep Side having you around. But I also hate, I think that Hank is right when he says that he can't exist and then we're right when we say that you're just annoying. Right. And also at the same time, saying, If I was really annoying, you would think you'd just cut me out.


No, I I I love having you around just to see how you can't exist. I wanna watch you exist to be like, no, stop doing that existing. Yeah. Hank's great when it's directed at somebody else. When you focus all your energy on, on being somebody else's problem. I like that part. Yeah. I love you Hank. I love you guys too. Oh, thank you. You finally said it back. You didn't say it back the other day in the car when we were fighting about on the way to what? Were you on the way to ho hard knocks. Yeah. We were on the way to hard knocks and you were stalling me. Alright, so we, we are gonna talk about Hard. Knocks With Peter Schrager. The other news. JJ McCarthy has a knee injury. Yeah. Meniscus. Terrible loss. So I think we should go to our senior meniscus correspondent Max.


Yes. Who has dealt with one or two of these in the last years. Max. What can we expect? How soon can we expect him back on the court? Also On the court. Yeah. On the court also. Is he going to learn how to fall onto his neck as opposed to landing on his feet? He doesn't, he doesn't try to fall onto his neck. He should, he should probably fall to, to brace impact if he were like coming down from a dunk. But he is not dunking. He's playing football. But it, I'm, I'm telling you what I know. Okay. Okay. You asked me for my expertise. This is my expertise. Yes. Okay. He could be back. He will probably be back in like two months and then it'll linger for a little bit longer. And then he'll have like a couple good games. And then if he has one bad game, you can just blame it on the meniscus.


Yep. That's the prob really the number one thing. Or he Is just tired Or, or he is just tired. Oh Yeah. Is he gonna get fat? No, he's not fat. He will be like really strong, really athletic. Probably the best at his position. Is he gonna Play like he's fat? No. No. Other people will maybe say that he plays like he's fat, but he is, is not actually fat. He is actually really athletic. And, and if he didn't have his meniscus, he would be in more shape. Better shape. Conditionally. So he is fat condition fat. He won't Fat conditioning wise. Fat? No, not fat, but just not as good shape as he would've been. Okay. If he didn't tear his meniscus. And it'll come back like within the next couple years.


Like there'll always be the worry of, you know, the meniscus tour. It could tear again. It probably will tear again. And it's always gonna be in the back of your head. And you'll always be like, I, you know, what if he didn't tear the meniscus? What Could have been? Yeah. Right. Shout out. Could be shout out JJ McCarthy for being a tough motherfucker because he didn't, he tore his meniscus and then didn't report it until the next day. Yeah. And he was like, Hey, should we check this out? It sucks. It it like, it just sucks. He Did look really good in, in the preseason week one. Yeah. They have Sam Donald. But the, like that's, That's a denial injury. That's like a I'm gonna sleep, I'm gonna sleep this off and I'll be fine. Which yeah, everyone does when you, when the minute you get injured, especially if you're drunk and get injured and you're like, I'm fine.


And then you wake up the next day and you're like, I can't Walk. That's what happened with my foot. Yeah. Yeah. I just walked it off, walked home that night and then I woke up in the morning. Nano bubbles didn't do shit. But it really does suck for Vikings fans because you're excited about your, your new quarterback. And then he should be fine long term, but it still is like, if he misses two months of his rookie season, that's big. Yeah. So I know that there are two different types of surgeries you can have on the meniscus. One is when you like cut it out and the other is when you repair it. Right. You sew it back together. Yeah. And So, if you cut it out, you can play on that after a couple weeks. If, you sew it back together. It takes longer to heal. But then you're better off in the long Term. Right. you don't get bone on bone like D Wade Had. Yeah. Bone on bone could be an issue.


So Max, which one did who? I forget, which player do you root for that had meniscus surgery? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, was it in bead? What kind did he have? Meniscus? I don't know. But Did they, was it the long one or was it to cut it out and he's gonna come right back? I think he, I think I, I think he said both. Honestly. I don't, I'm not, Yeah, I, I hope he is okay. He looked great. Yeah. I feel bad for Viking Stream sucks. It's a shitty thing. Like you've been through it before with Teddy Bridgewater. I hope nobody threw up this time. But yeah. Hope he's okay. Was, was it the Derek Carr seven year bump that we talked about? Because Sam Donald is in his seventh year, which is crazy.


Yep. That he's been in the NFL for seven years. But Sam Donald is now gonna be the starter. Yeah. Also, just a reminder that doing a fantasy draft before the end of preseason is insane. You gotta Do it Labor Day weekend. It's insane. I 'cause Jamir Gibbs got hurt too. Yeah, I think it was a hamstring. Is He okay Huey? He's gonna be all right. Okay. He's gonna be great. Because I saw there was like some people who were concerned about that, but there's no, there's no worse feeling than being in preseason and getting that alert from Shefter and being like, wait, that's one of my guys. Especially If. you have a rookie quarterback that you're excited about. Yeah. It sucks. Yeah. So sorry for Vikings fans. Okay. Before we do our Mount Rushmore, should we, should we take a quick look at the top 25 and we also have some breaking moves.


Breaking moves. Henry Lockwood? No, this is not, this is not Person's name. This is has nothing to do with him. Existing. Not existing. Whatever. Henry Lockwood, after doing an extensive search where he just got drunk at bars and called it work last year, he has found his Big 10 team, which is The Washington Husky. Oh wow. So you went to a Washington bar last year? No. Oh, I didn't. I didn't declare them My Big 10 team for the record, but I am high on them. So why are They, it's an actual fit. Yeah. Why are they your Big 10 team? Because Belichick is a defensive coordinator. Bill Belichick.


Steve, Steve Belichick. I knew that. Yeah. Wait, Wait. Did you actually think that Bill Belichick was gonna be the defensive coordinator? No. But you, you said that earlier and you didn't like, you're like Belichick's, the defensive coordinator was like, you have to say Steve, obviously It's obviously Bill Belichick's not the defensive. I understand. But you do have to say the first name in that. Okay. Steve Belichick. Sorry, I didn't, I didn't think that. I thought that was a given. Bill Belichick was on McAfee show yesterday or Tuesday, Monday, whatever. And he was talking about how he's just been, you know, hanging out around the team. And as has Pete Carroll.


So the Washington Huskies have maybe the greatest coaching staff that's they got, or not an official coaching staff, but is a coaching staff of all time Shadow coaching staff. Yeah. You got the old dogs getting back together. Now. it does make sense for Hank to be a Huskies fan because they combine two of your great loves before games. They've got drinking and then they've boat sail boats. Sail. Yeah. You gotta go sail gating at some point. So how do you I would love to, how do you like your Huskies in the Big 10 West? Well, That's what I asked Big Cat before. I was like, are they in the cupcake division or the, the hard division. And I always found out that it's one Division. Yeah, it's one. It's all one division. That sucks for you guys. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But it's expanded. Play out. My Big 10 knowledge was just like, it's Ohio State and Michigan and then Wisconsin comes outta the cupcake. Yeah, yeah.


The legends and leaders conferences. So So it's like the big 20. Yeah. They don't change the numbers. Yeah. They haven't changed the numbers. 18. 18. Yeah. One, one conference. Yeah. How Do they decide who gets to the Big 10 championship? Top two. That's It. Yeah. Could be Michigan, Ohio State playing back to back weekends. That's cool. Yeah. Well, I don't know if that's cool that that's the thing. Well you're just was, I mean you're screwed. No, No, no, no causing screwed. Well, no, because it's expanded playoffs. So there'll be, you don't have to bake to the Big 10 championship to be in the playoff. Got It. The, the Like a Washington schedule Situation of Ohio State and Michigan playing each other in back to back weekends would probably suck because both teams would then be in the playoff most likely.


And then you'd have a big 10 championship game. That would mean Yes, home field advantage, but also it would kind of take a little away from the rivalry. Wait, would there be a possibility that they played three weeks in a row? I don't think they can play three weeks in a row. 'cause I don't think that's how, I don't think they would ever the bracket them that way. It would. But the possibility exists. I'm not, I don't think so because I think it's automatic. I think automatic qualifiers would get a buy. They Always Get a buy. Yeah. So I don't think it would, it, it can exist, But we could get three matchups between them in the same year. Yes. That's on the table. Yes. It's tough to beat a team three times. Yes. I mean this Is a could happen in the, could happen in the SEC as well. Yeah. Now I like the years that Georgia and Alabama play each other.


They could play again. They could play again. Looking At the top 25, the thing that jumps out to me is things being Guess. Wait, that did happen. Wait, no that didn't. Ha did that happen? Did Georgia and Alabama play each other three times when they played in the national title? I don't think so. I think that was just the second time. Which Year? Because they did put The two Year Oh I like that memes. Because they could in the SC championship. Yeah. And yeah, they lost in the SEC championship and then won In the Yeah, That was the Bryce Young year. That's Right. That's right. But the thing that jumped out to me was things being just as they should be, which is Iowa at number 25. Yeah. Iowa. They should just stay at 25. And NC stayed at number 24. Yeah. Yeah. Those perfect. Two teams. They fit there. Iowa, it doesn't matter what they do, they should just always be number 25.


Georgia one, Ohio State, two. Oregon. Three. Texas four, Alabama five. This is the year that if Ryan Day this is, this is, he's got the squad, his defense is gonna be nasty. If Ryan Day doesn't do it, then the born on third stuff Yeah. Is gonna start to really come true. Big matchup. October 12th. Penn State. Ohio State. Whoa. Getting ready for that. And November 9th, we'll lose that by 10 Or no, is that org? That might be Oregon, Ohio State. I think that's the matchup on October 12th. Yeah. There's Oregon, Ohio. I mean There's some great in Washington, Iowa. In Washington. Oh yeah. Hank, sorry, we forgot Hank was in the room. Yeah. Hank, We talk About his huskies. Are there a lot of, a lot of UDub bars in Chicago?


I don't know, but it gotta one Probably they have to start one. Maybe. Hey, why don't you give us a quick win loss for the Washington Huskies? Alright, So they, I just looked at their schedule. They have a, they have a big PAC 12 schedule is what I'm calling it. Okay. Michigan's nine. But aren't they gonna stink this year? No, this'll still be good. But they'll be, they'll, they will not be, I'll tell you this thing, they'll not be in the top 10 by October 5th. Okay. Mark my work call on your shot full card. So that'll be a win. You just skip to the fifth week. Well, yeah. I mean Rutgers obviously a win. Northwestern obviously a Win Washington State rivalry game. Maybe not. Wait, where's Northwestern Washington? Yeah, You would have to go to that if it was here.


I would love to go to that. Also on a lake, right? Yeah. Yeah. Literally this year, because they're playing on the practice facility. There's stadiums that's, I mean, crazy. I probably will try and go to one of those games. It's gonna be a sick end zone Cam. I'm A sucker for, for water. Iowa. Win Indiana. Win USC could be tough. Penn State win UCLA win. Oregon could be tough. So undefeated in two could be Tufts At Penn State. Doesn't that doesn't matter if they do The whiteout. I think. I think it is. Wow. For Washington. That's Classic. Are you talking rival? No, I'm just thinking Like, are you talking shit about your own squad state? If. You're a Penn State fan and you're like, Why? I did it for Minnesota last year.


Yeah. I guess that's, heck if I were you, I would say that's, that's just a true mark of how respected Washington is. Where Penn state's using their white out on It. Is the white out? Good point. Washington is the white out. Alright, Maybe we'll go. I would love to, this is great. We should do this. Content. Yeah. Content. Alright. So what is that 10 and two? Eight and two. It was, it was undefeated with two. Could be Tufts. 1, 2, 3, 4. We are gonna do a full college football preview in the coming weeks. This is not it. So just don't, this is just our Washington Huskies previous. This is us just looking at, at a list of teams. And Hank talking about he's not Love. Hank's, Hank's, Washington Huskies that he, that were Hank's Washington Huskies as of an hour ago.


Yeah. I'm a loyal guy. He's smitten. He's spent, it's gonna wear off. Hank. It's What You're love of the Huskies. What happens when they, Not my love of the Belichick. Never. What happens when they play a late Nike? I will Never go away and, and Hank, he's got some drinky. I'll just have to have some more drinking Play. Nine 30 kick. I'm not a Saturday drinky Guy. Big after dark. Oh you aren't. Not during the football season. Oh, okay's not True. We did a bar crawl last year to look for your Big 10 team. Yeah. You Literally did that. Did that was day drinking. And That was work. That was also work Max. That was work sponsored. Shout a Coors Light. I had to do that. I had no choice. Alright, well I'm excited to watch Hank.


I'll tell you what, Huskies have great colors and great gear. You got that to look for Cool fans too. Yep. Great coaches. Spencer Hawes. Great stadium. Yeah. It means Spencer, You're, you're buying this. You're You're doing what? Every econ. 'cause you taught us this with your econ class. Buy high, sell low. Yep. 'cause they just went to the national champ. They've never been as good as they are. Yeah. He's noticing the trend in the market. Hank's going to the moon. That's your problem. Kate, you're selling before. We're on the moon. You couldn't be, Their mascot is awesome, by the way. The worst Time Dubs dub. You're just missing Insane season. Hank get to know Dubs the mascot. He rocks. Yeah, he's a good boy.

Wait, did you just apologize? No, he just admitted that everything, he, he copped everything. I try and muddy the water. I actually always respect that in a TV show or a movie where the guy that's on the stand gets so pissed off at the, at the like prosecutor that they, they just admit to massive crime that Happened in the young, the Young Thug trial. Yeah. The guy said, he was like, yeah, we went up and did that shit.

I just got a call back from receiving. Let's see what she has to say to memes. Hello, Is this Diana Rec? Yes, this is Diana Rossini. Who am I speaking with? Hey Diana. This, this is part of my take. Earlier today, memes said that she, on the air that you were, or you're on the air, you'll have to tape. Earlier today, memes said that you were a system Florio at this point for your reporting on Hassan Reddick.


Do you have any comment to him? I think that memes needs to understand that Mike Florio, Diana Rossini, Tom ero, Adam Schefter, Ian Rappaport do not make the decisions for the New York jets. Mm. New York Jets make the decisions for the New York Jets. So while he does not like the messenger of the news, it's not our fault. Mm. So I would say sorry, but I'm not really sorry. Mm. Okay. I think that's fair. Memes. Do you have any retort? Nope. All right. He doesn't have retort. Yeah. Put him in the body bag bodied them. Good job, Diana. All right. Maybe he should follow me on Twitter and I can give him more gen. Oh. Oh, wow. So so you don't even follow her on Twitter and you're complaining about her tweets?


Huh? They That soft, That's soft. Wow. That is soft. Soft. That's real soft. He saw, Oh yeah, we talked about the Italian angler. I think he's got some self-loathing. Yeah. Something's wrong. It's basically if your name ends in a vowel, memes doesn't like you. So I'm, I'm never gonna forget this. That's true. Okay, well thank you Diana. Okay. Hi Max. Bye. Bye. That was, that was soft by memes, right? Yeah. Very soft, insanely soft memes. Alright, let's do Hot Seat Cool Tour. And those great Mount Rushmore guys more open-ended ones. If anyone wants to treat him at us. Those are the fun ones. Yep. Because Hank just always goes with the most literal definition of it. Well, no, he gets mad at us for exploring the other options.


Yeah. When he also has those other options. Yeah. He, he, he, I told you I'm, I'm bad. He's plenty. Yeah. A lot of my anger is just directed at myself through you guys. Hank Hank, do you want me to help you with Mount Rushmore? I mean, again, like the sanctity of this whole contest has been, we're tied In last place. Hank. Not anymore. You're not out. Its boobs.

You you also doesn't, you're, I also don't know the order anytime You're, you're in the clear. I don't know the order time. You Just made fun of Big Cat for never knowing the order. Yeah. You Said I don't know the order.


Muddy In the water. Oh, you don't know how the order of like who's picking when. Oh, got it. All right. Yeah. Yeah. So how would I rig it if I don't know the order day Today? Maybe you're playing the long game Kaiser Soze of the order. They never caught on for me to finish second place, H just lives, life as devil's advocate. That is unfortunately true. I've got like this mastermind and I'm, somehow, my mastermind has me 11 points down from Max. It doesn't, but it does. It just can't come in last, Which I could still, No. Okay, let's Do Hot. Seat. You might win Hank sometimes you, you, you think that you're gonna lose and you end up winning. You can't beat boobs. It's true. It's A fact. Boobs are a great, not On a cool card.

And they're, they're supposed to boom or doom one of the items, but then they both kind of end up, they kind of end up booming both of Them. And they'll sometimes have the Sam Club guys on who are the Indian father and son.


Yeah. That's kind of cool. See Hank It's like trips. The blood's getting together. I'm starting to think that Hank has a little anti Italian discrimination with him. No, I mean, listen, any, anyone can do their thing. I'm happy that they're, they're popular. I I usually don't share my, my hater opinions. Would You like it more if they were on a golf course doing golf videos? I, it's not really, my issue is not with them. I do think it's like an internet hive mind personality where people are like, oh, these guys are electric. They're so funny. Like they're not Well It, it's, It's Like people see other people saying they like 'em and then they can I I throw something out. There's like hive mind, brain rot. Like, oh, Can I, This is the flavor of the month. We love these guys. Let just throw something out there. No, you Don't. So there's this thing called irony.


I don't, but no, I think, I think that there's like, there's that section of the world where people understand irony and then there's just like the sheep that are like, oh yeah, like we fucking love big justice. I think it's like a lot of things on the internet where it might be fun to watch, but then when you find yourself explaining what it is you like, Listen, actually you guys just explain it made me want to You start to like it less when you explain what it is because Yeah. Yeah. Dude, Don't do that to the Grizzler. I like the Riz. I guess The Riz did nothing wrong. No he didn't. It's 400 foot box. No, the Rizz The Grizzler is funny. And, and what's Little Justice? I had no issue with Little Justice. The Rizz does sick bike Tricks. Yeah, he does. He's the bike. Have you seen the bike trick?


Oh No. Five. We were talking about the boom guys. He said that Safety did a video where he, he said he was gonna do five bike tricks and then he came back, he did one and he was like, I kind of ran out of time. No, the other ones are too dangerous. The other ones are too dangerous. Which, I mean, practicing. Yeah. Showing safety is good on the internet. Yeah, It is. That's a good point Max. Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate that. I didn't know that this was going to have such a spirited conversation around it. Well, He's a hater. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah. Not publicly except for this And The Cults kid. Yeah. I was just about to say, you hate Cults kid that you hate Seth with Floweth. Yeah. That was a raw reaction. It was bad. I didn't realize that. The course of that or it's the same as our God is an awesome God. Yeah. I love Seth with Flow.


He stole that from church and Seth with Flow saw it and everyone commented. He was like, thanks the Pardon My Take for shouting me out. And all the comments were like, Hank's such a hater. We'll, we'll get him. Yeah. I I don't wanna be a hater. This is just my, like I see this shit and I don't like it. I'm gonna give you a dom. What do you want me to say? I'm, I'm gonna give your attitude today a doom. Yeah, Yeah, that's fine. Double doo. Okay. I'll try a doom. I'll try and and watch some more come around. I liked they did the, the Los Polos. The problem is the only thing you, there's a Street dad is golf Videos And it that your, your only idea is mini golf. No, there's, there's, that's stone joke. Yeah. Well it was a good joke 'cause it's true. Yeah. It was a good Joke. You didn't make it.


This Loess Polos is a street that Gets a boom Was funny. Him and his dad, his dad like, said the same thing. He was like, who the fuck are these? Like another Italian kid? He's like, who the fuck are these guys? Started talking shit. And then everyone was like, the Rizzo's gonna get you, ther's gonna get you. Then they all did a, a stream together. That was funny. That was, that was funny. And it remade The Bronx. It like five minutes long again. I think the more you explain where the less I like it. Yes. Yeah. I just wanna watch the videos and and smile. Yeah, it's It's, but that's fine. It's the internet. It's like supposed to be Do you everyone, do you? Yeah. I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not saying 'cause I think one way you should, but Yes, he's been trying to go viral for a very long time. He was a, he was a former in independent wrestler. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.


So he's he's about that. He's he's got this in him. He's about that content. Like Yeah. Like the people who found his early videos like, don't realize he was also a wrestler to going on the independent circuit. Yeah. You tell me an independent circuit wrestler wants to go, wants to make money going viral online. No, duh. Yeah. I I mean sometimes when you're an inventor it takes you a few dud in convictions. Correct. Until you get something awesome. People Laughed at the at at Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs did it. They fired him from Apple. Got fired, then he took a loan and then he came back and crushed him. Yeah. Hank would've been such a Steve Jobs hater. Oh my God. Yeah. Biggest 'cause he doesn't eng golf. That's the problem. Ans only YouTube videos are golf. If I would went to your algorithm right now, There's one other thing.


Boobs What? Who? Billy Strings. Oh Yeah. Hit the line. Billy Strings Golf. Imagine if Billy Strings did a, did a, a golf video. Good, good. Great. Yeah. Billy Strings come on the show, do a video with us. Oh, Okay. You're cool Throne. My cool throne is chess controversies. Mm. Have you guys heard of the chess controversy? It's another butt plug. No, this is, it's different. It's much more sinister than the butt plug. There's a Russian grandmaster, I think she is. She was competing in a tournament against her opponent who's from Dagestan. And before the tournament they caught her on camera. She snuck into the room, went up to the board that they were about to play, and smeared something on her opponent's pieces and on her side of the board.


And then her opponent got deathly sick. Oh. Almost died. Ooh. So they went back, they reviewed the footage. It turns out that she sprayed Mercury onto her side of the chessboard and almost killed her opponent. Holy shit. So there's no butt plug stuff in, in chess now, now that hardcore they're actually trying to kill each other. Yeah. It's almost like Belichick stuff. That's Very hardcore Belichick mate. Okay. My Hot Seat. This happened late Sunday after we recorded, but Matt Kucher What a dish. Dickhead What A douche bag. The Worst. What'd he do? The Oh, Hank's gonna offend him. Nice. Okay. I like this. It's spicy. The Wyndham Championship, there were, so they, they had bad weather Thursday and Friday.


They had to fit in a bunch of rounds on Saturday and Sunday. The course, the, the ground crew did an incredible job. They got the whole thing in. Matt Kucher was in 12th place, didn't mean anything for the FedEx Cup, didn't mean anything for pretty much anything. Hits into the group ahead of him on 18. And then just picks up his ball and leaves and says it's too dark. And came back on Monday to finish half a hole while everyone else had finished. So it didn't mind made people come back and sit there. It was actually very funny watching everyone clap douchebag move by Him. Did did he make his putt? I think he got the exact score he was gonna get, he get a par He stayed in at 12 So he, he two putted.


So Hank no, he was like halfway up the fairway when he came back. Okay. Hank, you're Def I'm not defending him. 'cause Matt Kucher is a, a documented scumbag. He won a tournament. He had like a fill caddy. He won like, I think a million and a half or $2 something paid his caddy like five grand. Like Yep. I remember that. And there's been some other examples of him being a scumbag. So I think in this case it probably is just him being a scumbag. But I did see a golf journalist who had a, a thread breaking down why he might have been doing it. Basically saying that he was in the last group and the person he was playing with was, had a four shot lead. He had to play in the dark. He kind of blew his lead and the group in front of 'em was playing super, super slow all day.


There's a like a couple long videos of the guy who won, I think Ry the, the two glove guy taking like four minutes on putts, like taking forever. And that Kucher was basically standing up for the guy who lost a lead, but he didn't say it like, which is obviously not His defense. And also did, but didn't that guy finish? He chose to finish, but he, but Kucher was saying like he was just, you know, he was going through the motions. He didn't say this, but this is what the guy was saying, that maybe he was just trying to set a example of like, the guy should have been playing faster in front of them. You gotta take a stand. But That's not, how is that taking, I don't know how that takes a stand for the guy he's playing with.


If the guy he's playing with was like, oh good call Matt Kucher. I'll come back Monday too. I understand. Well at that point he was already outta the le he already had lost like, Sounds Like he's taking him, being a jerk and, and twisting it into here's why I'm actually a hero. Did Matt Kucher write this article that you read Hank? No. And he, his the other point said, Matt, the other point he said, the other point that he said was that if Matt Kucher had just come out and said all this, instead of doing the little coy shit, people probably would've had his back. But he didn't. That's true. If he had, if he had been like public about why he was doing that ahead of time, I'm, I'm looking back now at the caddy controversy where he paid his caddy five grand and then later on Kucher said that McElroy cost him $300,000 due to the two point advantage in their season long FedEx Cup race.


And then Rory said, and we all know what that money means to him. Mm. So apparently he's cheap. Oof. Super cheap and like a documented kind of scumbag Maybe. How about this flights? They're cheaper on Mondays. True. But he had to stay an extra day Way cheaper. But he had to stay an extra day. PGA tore had a funny tweet 'cause they do like the, you know, every shot from like Brooks k winning the, the US Open or whatever, and they show a million shots. They did every shot from Matt Kuchar's finish Monday morning, And. it was just three shots. Oh, I love that. Yeah. There's like a couple random people clapping. Okay. And then my cool throne is Trump's comedic bone because he did the Elon Musk Twitter space.


And listen, we don't get political on this podcast, but the telling, the retelling of the high stakes stare down with Putin was one of the hardest times I've ever laughed. I'll play it for you. This is his telling of Putin and Trump negotiating the start of a war and what was gonna happen. And again, I said to Vladimir Putin, I said, don't do it. You can't do it, Vladimir, you do it. It's gonna be a bad day. You cannot do it. And I told him things that what I do, and he said, no way. And I said way. That's it. Good. That's good. That's, I mean, that's fucking funny.


That's What all negotiations are, by the way. No way. That's, that's the sub, that's the Subtext to every negotiation ever way. Just say way and walk away. No way. Yeah. There's a, it's a, it's a five-year-old response. He he got 'em with Yeah. Deep Way. Deep down inside we are all five year Olds. Yes. Yes. No way. Way. Okay. Huey, My Hot Seat. The WNBA. Oh, okay. So I gotta, I got a, I got a real story here. This one is legit. So there's a woman by the name of Dika Hamby. She was on our three by three women's basketball team. Okay. She is in a little dispute right now with the league of the WNBA and the Las Vegas ACEs.


Oh. So I'll give you the rundown before I give you the headline. Okay. That's how it usually goes. Yep. When you read an article. Yeah. In June, 2022, she signed a contract extension in July, 2022, she got pregnant. Okay. And Then what comes out afterwards is a baby. Well she, she, she alleges that in the following months that the Las Vegas ACEs were quote unquote unhappy with her. And she, she's alleging that they, were they, so essentially in the contract she had, she was supposed to have team provided housing and she was supposed to have tuition, school tuition for her daughter's private elementary school.


Okay. She had an older kid. Older Daughter. Yeah. Yeah. And she is alleging that the Vegas ACEs did not give her that. Okay. On top of the fact that they essentially wanted to trade her and wanted to push her out because she signed a big enough contract that they said was enough for two to three players. You know, the contract was a, a big enough contract. She's, she's averaging 20 points, 10 rebounds right now. She's doing very well. But the, the contract essentially, they essentially wanted a, wanted a few different players for her contract is what their was Las Vegas is saying, wait, so Wait, Get rid of the headline. Wait. So the, the Las Vegas is, they're owned by who again?


What, what football player has a, has an ownership stake in them. Big Cat Tom Brady. Yeah. That's interesting. 'cause this doesn't sound like something Tom Brady would do to a pregnant woman. Kick her out. Read us the headline. So the, the official headline is she is essentially that the, Oh, I got it right here. Sparks de Hamby Sues WNBA ACEs alleging discrimination. I think you should have read the headline First. I don't know. This is, it's kind of unorthodox. Well hear me out. Okay. So, so this is the second time they're going into an investigation. Oh. The first time the Las Vegas ACEs lost their 2025 first round pick For a pregnant lady.


For A pregnant woman. Whoa. So essentially, and she's saying that the WNBA did not do a good enough job. Got it. So essentially they're going back. She wants, they didn't learn their lesson, go back and Ah, and, and, And yeah. So and, and go through all that and also have to pay for her, her money, the money she lost her, her her lawyer fees, all that extra stuff. Yeah. Which they should do. Which stuff that also, this is a, this would never happen in the W or in the NBA. Correct. Oh yeah. Because don't think you can't get pregnant. Pregnant. But Also can you imagine if like football player, if male football players could get pregnant and you're psyched about the upcoming season. Yeah. And then you find out Jalen Hurtz is gonna have a kid. So he's gonna be out all season. Yeah. Yeah.


That would suck the discourse. That would, that would surround the league. Yeah. Yeah. And it essentially, that's why the Ace is in her, her words are saying why she, they weren't happy with her. Yeah. Because they signed this big contract and She got pregnant. She gets Pregnant a month Later. Well that's not, I mean, it's Not Her fault. Yeah. You should be able to get pregnant. Yeah, I agree. You should get pregnant when you want to get pregnant. It's fair. And sometimes you don't plan it. Yeah. And it was literally a month after. So people be fucking, she probably got Yeah. Started having sex with a once she got a big paycheck. Yeah, that's true. You know, To celebrate. That's True. Yeah. Yeah. Paycheck. Yeah. Paycheck sucks Guys love money. Yeah. We love chicks with money. Alright. And your cool throne. Oh, my cool throne. The Dallas Cowboys. Oh. They are the first league franchise in I think US sports to pass surpass the $10 billion.


Evaluation. Evaluation. Love this. Good. I love this. I mean, no more. No one's got more money than jj. Yeah. JJ and I love these lists. They're kind of like the, the USS News news and World Top Ranking of colleges. Yeah. Where it's like none of this, it's all made up. Every School has been at least rumored to be one of the top 10 party schools in The United States. Yes. And every school is also like they're the, the small Ivys the public Ivys. Yeah. The but it, it's the price is what it sells for. Yeah. The price is the price. Yeah. I don't know. He, they say that he, he could sell the team for $10 billion, but Again, it doesn't matter if he, if no one wants to buy it for 10 billion, I think Jerry Jones would buy the team right now for 10 billion.


Yeah. From himself. Yeah. How come they can't pay Dak and and Cdy then? That's A good point. That's a good point. Should be able to fu should be able to Take a look out Mortgage. Some of it.

And now here's Peter Schrager. Okay, we now welcome on our Good Good Friend two times in a week because he did join us on the Grit Week van for the Mount Rushmore of Yellow. You got a insight into the madness. That is Pardon My Take. It is Peter Schrager. He has the Hard Knocks podcast. He has Good Morning football. He's a reporter on Fox. He does everything. Does anyone ever call you The Schrager Meister? No, I like that. I like that Nice cold glass of Schrager Meister. Can I show you what else I am? Yep. In possession of this book? Is that me? Mm. This is the Aaron Rogers unauthorized biography.


I, I got a copy. I'm flipping through it on about a hundred pages in Let's go. Okay. There's probably a lot of slander in there. Authorized biography. Yeah. On, on the Bears. All right, so before we start, we should just address, this was a win tonight for the three old guys sitting right here. We're not gonna rub it in because it is live now on Max. But there was a delay getting the hard knocks episode up. And I, I know that PFD and I have been belittled, ridiculed, mocked for years now because we refused to cut the cord. Tonight was our Super Bowl because we got to watch hard knocks live and everyone else was mad about an app.


So credit to us guys for never giving up. We did it. We did it guys. I I knew this time would come and it's interesting you call it the Super Bowl. I thought of it more like training camp. This is like training camp for football season, especially college football season. When you know that there will be certain apps out there that aren't gonna work on Saturday. And you're going to need these reps in the preseason to know that you need a redundancy plan in place. You need to know that you have girl fashion, cable. Nothing wrong with it. Failing to prepare is, is preparing to fail. Yes. So just let's use this opportunity to get better. Yes. I pay, I pay 200 plus dollars a month to a cable provider every single month. I barely even turn on the tv. but it's all in preparation for this moment.


I, I think it's akin to, you know, you see that Michael Rubin fanatics White party and like those who are in the know are there and they're all partying and we're all on the outside looking in watching all of these Bears Media members be like, does anyone have HBO Act? And like, just us, like taking photos of it and like doing selfies. Like I felt like we were at the party and they were all on the outside looking in. It felt pretty good. I, I've said it before, but I, I have a dear friend who cut the cord. It was probably like eight years ago and, or maybe it was, maybe it was like six years ago. And I was over his house for the USC Ohio State whatever bowl game they were playing in. And his stream kept on buffering.


And I had a lot of money on the game And. it was at that moment that I was like, I always have to have a backup plan. I know this is gonna cost me too much money, but I don't care. I have to be able to watch my sports live. And tonight we, we won. So Schwigger, it was actually a great episode. It was, it felt, it felt like they got back to football. It was like they, and they, and they spread the ball around. Last first episode was a lot of ebra flues tonight was like, you know, Keenan Allen Roma, Dunay, we have DJ Moore moment, Jonathan Owens. So you, you watched these before, right? Do you get these Before us? I get 'em like a few hours before they go live so I can do them. And then I get, then I interview a guest each week.


So the first week I interviewed Lacer, who was amazing. And then this week I just got off the phone with Ryan Polls who has also seen the episode and the GM and I were talking back and forth about it a little bit. And to your point, the first week was a lot of setting up characters. Here's Ebra Flu's glow up, we're gonna talk about his Ryan Reynolds hair this week. We get Jalen Johnson and we get Keenan Allen going at it one-on-one at Practice actual football and great access that we don't typically get to see when we just have the shaky cam footage from training camp where someone's watching from like the crowd. Yeah. It was awesome. And then it sounds like Keenan Allen was conceding that, you know, yeah. This, this guy's been beating me all p like this guy had the best of me.


So Bears offense gets a lot of press, but like this was the episode for that Bears Defense that I was making. I know it was And it. So I have to ask, everyone should go listen to your your Hard Knocks podcast, but can you tell us what maybe a quick summary of what Ryan Polls is feeling? I mean, I, I I love him, but where's he at mentally with this team? Yeah, there was a quick little moment in the beginning of the episode where he was talking to Ian Cunningham, who is kind of his number two in Chicago. And he is like, have you noticed that Caleb's getting a little better on film? Like he's picking it up a little bit, the rhythm. And he's like, so he was talking about it every single day. Like Caleb's picking up things that he didn't have the day before. He's picking up coverages that he didn't see week one, now in week two. But I thought It was great. I was like, I kind of liked Caleb in episode one because for that rookie show, you can go up there and you can be like, here's my, my college fight song.


Or like, here's my favorite like new hip hop song. Instead Caleb comes out, he's horrible singing John Legend's ordinary people and like they're throwing shit at him and he just gets the, the piss taken out of him. And he is smiling and he is laughing and he's an equal with Tyson bet to Austin Reed and Brett Rip. And you're like, I like this guy. So I'm like, you have to like that. And he is like, no dude, that's Caleb. Like he has never been an entitled guy. He comes right in and he is one of the guys and he's like, If, you think he's shitty singing? You've gotta see him golf. And the best part about it is he's a horrible golfer, but like he comes out there and he like takes the swings and like is not as not scared. A lot of these athletes have too much pride. Like Caleb's like, I suck at golf, I'm gonna play and I don't care.


And that's the ultimate confidence. So like, they're all happy it's going well. Yeah. Yeah. It does. It does seem like, like they're pretty happy with him. I wonder if if Polls would've done the podcast if Caleb Williams hadn't played that well in preseason week one. Interesting. Because like, we gotta see him go out there and do stuff that only a couple people can do in the NFL with his arm. And so he's like, yeah, probably a little bit of relief from Ryan Polls. Like, okay, I, at least I know I'm not a, a complete moron for taking this guy. Number one. It looks like the chapter I did. I did, I did get this booked on Sunday night. So that does, that does make sense. The game was Saturday. I, one last thing on polls. I thought it was interesting because a lot of these guys clam up when it's not like football. I was like, you were in Kansas City when they drafted Mahomes, but you were also in Kansas City when they drafted Kelsey.


Like, would you have ever thought? He's like, what? He's like, no, I would've never thought like at that time that Kelsey would get through his rookie year. He was crazy. He's like, that's why we love Travis. Because you know, Andy Reed found a way to make it work. And like he said that he and Kelsey saw each other before a game last year and the two of them did like the Paul Rudd, Sean Evans meme of like, look at us. And he is like, I'm a GM. And he is like, and I'm dating the number one pop star in the world. And it's like the team had a huge embrace and I'm like, alright, so Pauls has a personality. He was pretty cool. Yeah. He, he is o other quick hitters. 'cause we, we have some, some questions Schrager about the rest of the NFL. Yeah. And we don't wanna do all bears, but these are just notes I took down PFT so you can, you can add in anywhere.


Yeah. I love that they're scouting the refs. That was pretty cool. Craig Rad. I believe that. I believe that gentleman's name is Harry Free. I go deep. The kid who was talking to Caleb and is like, look, he's a, he's an athletic director in Seattle and and this is what he does. You're gonna see him once a week. Like that's how deep this is. I've never seen that before. That was cool. Yeah, I love that. It was very cool. Private Investigators for the refs. It's smart. Yeah. Yeah. I loved seeing the scene, the Museum of Ice Cream. Just because I've been to the Museum of Ice Cream three times, both in New York City And Chicago. I I didn't is that like a chain? Because Big Cat it is. I I took my kid to New York. No, he's just a, he's a history buff. So he wants More. It's loves Sister. Well listen, you go to the one in New York City is the one in Chicago the same.


Gotta try, you gotta go to the one in Chicago again. So it's, It's kind of like a hillstone. Like if there's a hillstone in any city, I'm trying that French dip there. I have to, I have no problem saying I've been to the Museum of Ice Cream three times. That's I, I I'm not, I'm not worried about. And then the, the other one and, and this one was like a very dad moment. DJ Moore before the game in Buffalo. His daughter being like, what's the bumblebee's name? And if, and like that's If. you have kids. That's the most kids thing ever where the world could be on fire and your kid is just like, Hey, this is right Before The day. Hey play that one song. Yeah. Play that one song we listened to three weeks ago that has the cat in it. And I'm like, I don't fucking know what song this is And, and how and how up to date like if came out like in June.


So I'm like, wow, that's not saying Frozen. That's not Beauty and the Beast. That's not Aladdin. Like gimme the if character. I'm like if I don't even Where'd you find if Okay again, cable guy here. I don't even know where to find if that's incredible. Okay. I stupidly didn't plug my mic in after I spent the first 10 minutes being like, oh, I'm a genius for not cutting cords and look at me. That was the most karma thing ever. So you could hear me through my headphone, my, my earphone or I actually have, you know, wired headphones. You hear me through that mic? Now I'm plugged into my actual mic. Holy shit. That was a perfect way to start the show for me to be like victory lap and then, hey, you are the old fuck PFT.


Yeah. Any other thoughts about hard knocks before we talk about Schrager? About other camp stuff? I, Yeah, I just made a quick list of three things that big cat's gonna get mad about during hard knocks. I didn't get Mad at all. Well, Well well let wait, let, let me get to 'em. Let's see. If, you got mad 'cause last week you got mad about a few things. How they portrayed our dear sweet Caleb Williams. Yeah. The first thing is, I just predicted that Big Cat would yell at max for not pressing the button. Did not. So maybe this is growth. Maybe this is progress number two. You remember last week when you got upset when they showed Caleb Williams on screen when somebody used the word grinder? I was joke, but yeah, I was, I was wondering if this week you got upset when Caleb was having trouble putting his shoulder pads on.


No Doubt. I know. And then, and then, and then Rome was like, he was like, Hey Rome, can you get my strap on? Sounds like you're thinking about me while you're watching hard knocks. Keep going. Just sexually only. Sexually. Yeah. That was, that was pretty much it honestly. Because I feel like, I feel like you would probably agree with, with Austin Reid when he got upset at Sean McDermott for challenging that. Yeah. Challenging all Austin Reed wanted was just one completion. Yeah. And what is Sean McDermott doing? Let's come on, let's, let's be nice. Let's spread the ball around a little bit here. Can, Can I shout out Austin Reed's parents? Yes. You know, correct production team. I'm like, gimme this parent's names. These people are great. Jen and Tom Reed and they went to every one of his games from southern Illinois to West Florida to western Kentucky.


And now he's been to Canton and Buffalo. I'm all, I'm for those guys. Those are my favorite people. Yeah. Good. Hey, they're awesome. I also had on my list that you would get upset at HBO Max because you thought that maybe they, they were intentionally not letting people see the good Caleb Williams plays this week. No, again, I was watching on cable so I I was not mad. Listen, my, my complaints about the first week I admitted that I was maybe a little triggered, but there also were some real complaints in there. They showed football this week, I wanted to see football and that's what they did. They showed a lot of football. A lot of football and they sp and again, they spread the ball around like I wanna see everyone on the team And. it felt like that this week where they were giving a bunch of guys some love.


They, you know, like at the end when they were giving Austin Booker some love, like it was just, I loved it. Like you're learning all about all the Running back outta Howard. He got a lot of love. Yeah. Right, right. Vili Jones fumbled the ball. I've seen that before many times then he had some nice runs. But yeah, I, I am, I have no complaints about this week's episode. I thought they did a great job. Also, I, I don't think that Simone Biles as human when they showed her climbing up that rope. Crazy. That's just crazy. As a guy that used to like jump up and then quickly put one arm above the other and then just fall, the fact that she can climb a rope to the ceiling in like three seconds is insane. Yeah. Did you guys have that the presidential like fitness, the national fitness?


I was never presidential, at least national. I couldn't do like the, the the flex arm hang long enough. I, Yeah. Oh you did the flex arm hang. Yeah. Not good Pullups. Yeah. Not easy. Yeah. Yeah. I had, I always had trouble with a mile run. I was always like 30 seconds too slow to get presidential on that. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, Schrager, give us three big stories that are going around in training camp right now and what's happening. And maybe just some details. 'cause you, you're plugged in everywhere. Yeah, I've been to a few of them. And I'll say like one of the the cool things at Jets Camp when I was there was that the Hassan Reddick story is like almost like a non-factor.


That, and I, I'm not minimizing it, it's a crazy situation that you have a star pass rusher, demand a not demand, but request a trade get traded. And they somehow didn't sign him to a long-term deal before they brought him in the building and he did the press conference and now he's not there and wants to be traded again. But like I, it's, I live in New York City. I I I'm amongst all these jet fans. It's like last year they were burned so badly and they're like so scarred that they're not letting themselves get excited of all the practice. I've been to the Crispus practice. I was was that was at this Jets one and it's like they're really good on paper. They were really good on paper last year, but they added three really good offensive linemen to protect Rogers.


They added players on defense. Like, I'm trying not to get too excited because, you know, I've been down this road with the Jets, but I, I'd say the Jets are running a very crisp, nicely, somewhat under the radar training camp and in a year where it looks like the Patriots, the Dolphins and even the Bills might be taking a step back from where they were last year. Like this. I don't know, I don't want Jets fans to get too excited 'cause I get it. But like that was one of the crispest practices I've been to all summer, maybe in the last couple summers. Ooh, Interesting. I like that. What about, what about Brandon Iuk? Is he gonna get traded or are we just gonna play the Will Brandon IU get traded game all year? You know, I do this daily morning show and it's like, we have 32 teams and we have so many stars and like multiple days we've started talking about Brandon Ayu and it's just like, now here's the wild thing with that situation.


It was, they thought they had a deal then it, they, the both sides went dark and then, then it was like, alright, well there's the Patriots, but then Bernie New, I'm not gonna the Patriots. So it's really down to one team, the Steelers right now. And apparently there's a framework in place, but you need a and the Niners to agree upon it. Like the Steelers aren't budgeting. Here's the crazy thing. His agent's a guy named Ryan Williams who's big agent in the league, whatever, they have a bunch of guys, Ryan Williams and John Lynch are like lifelong buddies. Like best buddies like Ryan Williams invited John Lynch to his wedding. Like they are that tight. So there's personal, personal connections in this thing where, to me that tells me, all right, at the end of the day, I, if those are the two people who are running the business operation in this situation, like they'll find a way to get IU dressed and with the Niners and playing with this team and there'll be a contract that both sides are happy with and the Niners can go to bed at night.


But like for them to, to to go and like dig their heels in on this one and then for, for IU people to be like, well he just, he cannot, he cannot take up take step on the field until he gets more money. Like I just have to think they both, they're in the, it's a beneficial place for both of them. Like let's just get it done and, and find a way to make it happen. Wait, you said that he invited John Lynch to his wedding. Did John Lynch go to his wedding? Yeah. Did he attend the wedding? John Lynch? John Lynch was at the wedding. Like lifelong friends after wedding? Yes. Oh, okay. Well yeah it would you rather lead up. That's so interesting. Like good morning football. Would you rather lead off for the next two weeks with talking about the Dallas Cowboys every day? No, no. Or talking about Brandon iu. You know, it's funny 'cause our show is on so early, so like I always make this argument and you guys can appreciate this.


I'm like, there, there are not that many Niners fans up right now. Like, I don't know if we need to start the first hour of the show talking about a second wide Receiver on the 49 ERs. But I think it's a universal theme when you get the player that's like, I'm not coming to camp, but I am at camp, but I'm not taking part in practice. So yeah, I don't know cowboys that might sell better, but the IU thing is more timely. So. And then the last one that I had a question about is what are the Vikings gonna do with JJ McCarthy? Yeah, Look, that was that, that's, that's crappy news that which just, we just got it today obviously that his knees messed up and hopefully he will be back. But that wasn't necessarily the planned week one anyway. The, the way I saw it or the way that I've been hearing it is that like, and I know you can roll your eyes 'cause we've seen Donald with the Jets, with the, with the Panthers, with the Niners, we've seen Sam Donald, right?


We get what we're getting still in his twenties and like everything I've heard is that like, as great as JJ McCarthy's been like Donald's been even better in camp, they signed him to a $10 million deal. They feel confident that Donald was gonna start anyway out of the gates. So this gives time for McCarthy. But that's a really good situation for Sam because it's Kevin O'Connell who's a former quarterback in the NFL. It's Josh McCowen who's a like 18 year veteran in the NFL. He's, he's the quarterback's coach out there. And then you've got Addison Jefferson, Aaron Jones, and of course that great offensive line. So like, if Donald was ever going to have a chance to, to get out and have a good start, it's with this team and what they have, the McCarthy thing, it's unfortunate because I think everyone was excited, but again, 21-year-old kid, like super young, I don't think they're rolling him out out of the gates the first month of the season anyway.


Yeah. So it sounds like they'll probably take the more cautious approach. It does suck. It sucks beyond beliefs to have your rookie quarterback have that, but you also have to think long term. It's not just this season. They're not in Win now mode. Yeah, I I, you know, PFT I'll tell you this, you know, I talk to Cliff all the time. The, the offensive coordinator in Washington, like everyone's happy and polls is thrilled with Caleb and I talked to Sean Peyton and he's thrilled with Bow Nicks like, you have no idea how good this kid is. Like, great, like what they're getting out there in Washington. Like, I'm not trying to get you too gassed up here, but like, like don't gas me up. Holy shit, bro. Like they're talking like, this guy is the real deal in Washington and Jaden Daniels has been everything they were hoping for and more in training camp as far as leadership, as far as on the field.


And we saw him attempt three passes. But how calm did he look in that preseason game against the Jets just moving the ball right up the field? Yeah, I mean, Dan Quinn called him Top Gun, which is an awesome nickname. That's awesome. He, he just buzzed the tower. He didn't get permission, but that the first pass that he threw Dan Quinn needs to teach him we're too close for missiles, let's switch to guns. Because the first one that he threw on that little screen pass went like six feet over his head. I'm gonna chalk that one up to adrenaline. It's Two pumps. He had family in the building. It was a noon start. He was ready to go, man. Yeah, I I like how you said I'm not gonna gas you up too hard. And then you're like, holy shit, bro. Like I'm gassed. All right. I can't get any more gassy than I am right now.


I, I haven't felt this way in a long time. Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just desperate to have any like, shred of, of positivity or, or hope, but yeah, I'm, I'm getting drunk on all the Jade and Daniels Kool-Aid, so it's been, I'm I'm happy that you told me that it's been good. You said earlier that the Jets looked like they were having a pretty good camp. Things look crisp. I know you don't wanna, you don't wanna trash any teams, but can we put it this way, like which teams so far in camp have had the most questions? Yeah, I'm curious what we get with the Patriots and I know Hank is, is a key part of this, this, this group here. I I just, new coach, rookie quarterback, the preseason debut for all of them didn't do anything to blow anyone's hair back.


So I, this could be a really interesting transition here in New England and, you know, to to, to have IU like so openly say like, I'm not gonna New England, everyone just kind of shrugged their shoulders and nod. Like that's, it's, it's not what it's, it's a, it's a new era, I'll just say that. Yeah, the counterpoint Joe Milton, maybe he saw Joe Milton play and he is like, ah, maybe It's fans of Michigan, fans of Tennessee, fans of college football have been hearing about Joe Milton for years. I think he's got a, a great rocket arm and we had him on Good Morning football last year. He is a really good kid. But you know, you go on the sixth round and accuracy has always been an issue. So I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't put Milton ahead of May just yet. Yeah, It's phase one.


We're in phase one of the Joe Milton experience and anyone that's that's paid attention to him in the past, you, you know what's coming. But just enjoy the ride, Enjoy it, enjoy it. And they used to do this with, I wanna say it was either like Michael Bishop or Rohan Davey. Like they would, they would take out Brady at the end of a half and they would throw in one of these just like rocket armed guys just to throw the Hail Marys at the end. Like Belichick used to do that. I got, I think it was Michael Bishop from Kansas State. I, I would not be shocked if we saw Joe Milton just throw a couple bombs during the season and they put him in there just to let him get one of those deep throws before the end of the half. Alright, I got, I have something for you guys. Yeah. Okay. I I am so jealous of that Rob Dere ridiculousness, you know, studio you guys have in Chicago where I'm at all hours watching just fun games happening.


Big Cat, I I live in Brooklyn, obviously used to live here and I don't know since you left, but there's a craze in Brooklyn and it's in Dumbo and it's the sport called Pade. Yeah. Are you aware of what Pade is? No, I've played it. I've played it. You you have, okay, go on. Yeah. It's the sworn, the sworn enemy of pickleball. Yes. It's pickleball, it balls an evil twin. So it's, it's two on two. It's like pickleball, but you can go in the kitchen and all this things. It's more tennis than pickleball, but there's glass walls and you bang it off the walls and I've been playing it all summer. They have it at, in, in Dumbo. And I am telling you guys, If, you built a Pade court in that Chicago gymnasium of yours.


I'll fly out once a week and I'll play with you. I'm so addicted to this sport and it's not just me. I, I'm at the court and like Andrew Schultz, the comedian walks in, he plays name drop, doesn't say hello to me, doesn't know who the fuck I am, but like still he's there, there are other people that like, it's gaining steam and I feel like you guys would love it. And Big, Cat is so up your alley where it's like, no, it's not, it's not tennis. Not you're, you're Not gonna be, but that's what they're trying to do. They just, they're, they're trying to basically figure out different ways to play tennis, which is a boring sport to play. No dude And it like, oh, let's make it small, let's take it off the walls. Like, Hey, can you just admit tennis is boring? No, how dare you. PFTA. Did you love it when you played? Okay, so I played one time and I got my ass kicked by a 65-year-old.


Okay. It's all these boomers are creating games that they just don't even have to move. They're so, they're so good at it and, and they know all the angles and they know how to like, hit it off the wall and, and wait for it off the wall and hit it at just the right angle. I know it was all Angles, it was humiliating, all, but like, that's what they do though. I remember when you were doing those, those basketball workouts and I was so jealous of you. I'm like, yes, that looks fun. Like, you're getting a sweat in this is what this is like, it's No, no, no, no, because it's, it's it, the boomers have created games where they basically like shrunk tennis so they can stand in one place and be like, I worked out. That's what they're doing. I tell you, you'll sweat your ass off in this one. I think the boomers created these sports just so they can stick it to millennials Yeah.


So they can just kick the shit out of us at a sport and, and be like, see, I told you guys didn't work hard Enough. They never, they never sell their houses. So no one our age can own a house. Yeah. They never leave their jobs. So they never wanna leave the presidency. They, they just, they just, now they ruin all of our sports and recreation. I'm with you. Forget it. And what's the theme about all these sports? They just take a, a sport that already exists and just make it significantly smaller so they can cover all the ground. It's ridiculous. I, I'll not stand for Padell. All right. I have one, I have one last question. Schrager. It's Rollback question R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo. Take 20% off your first purchase. CUSIPs Polos, hoodies, joggers, shorts. Who is going to be the week one starter in Pittsburgh?


I think Russell Wilson. Yeah. I don't know the status of his calf. I just know that when they brought him in, it was like they put tunnel vision on. They're like, Wes is our guy. Like, we're good. Like just feel and fields when it's ironic because I remember covering, this is gonna date me. I remember covering the Seahawks in like 2012 when your guy Russell Wilson showed up there. And. it was the late Tavaris Jackson And. it was Matt Flynn and everyone was like, it's an open competition. And Russell was a third round pick and won the job outright. That's what they're saying in Pittsburgh. And I think like the irony is like, it would have to take Justin Fields to have a lights out, undeniable preseason, And. it would have to maybe take a, not a hundred percent Russell Wilson with that calf for fields to start week one.


But I think, I think the plan is Russell Wilson week one. I think so too. Yeah. Yeah. What what about your guy canals? What about the, do we have any canals? Yes. Or Guy Teer. Did you see, like, I feel like, Did you see the canal? Did you see the canals video that came out where they were doing the rookie show and he said, fuck it, I'm jumping in and he is saying, Bob Marley, every little thing's gonna be all right to the team. And he sang it perfectly in you. So all is good in Carolina, guys. Okay. That's good that, that I'm glad that he's a good singer. That's important to have as, as a football coach, As, as an NFL head coach. It's good. Has there been any, any reason for optimism down there? I do feel for, for Panthers fans.


You had a rough season one with Bryce Young and the fact that CJ Stroud was so good last year and he went second. Overall it's tough. It's tough to make it through a season like that. Yeah. Is there any, is there room for hope? Do we have hope in Carolina? Sure. And look, they, they, this off season, they like really spent a lot of money on like guards. Like they spent, they spent a lot of money on like Robert Hunt from the, from the Dolphins who's not a household name, but like they broke the bank on 'em. They just wanna build up this like brick wall in front of Bryce Young. And yes, he can see above it. And then in the draft they got Legette at Wide Receiver, they got Brooks at running back. So like they got the big guys up front in free agency and they got some weapons on the outside last year had never had a shot.


It was dead on arrival as far as no weapons, no protection, no chance. And now you have an offensive head coach and you brought a bunch of different skill position players in and now you have an offensive line. So the hope is this team is a little bit better, but I'm, they're not like a playoff team in my eyes. Yeah, you, I mean, you're a David Tepper apologist, so I Am, I love, I loved his, I loved his maniacal ways on Wall Street. I told you that last time I spoke with you. Yes. Yeah. Yes. No, I haven't spoken to, I haven't spoken to Tepper. I I assume he is on a yacht somewhere. So. Nice. Yeah. Alright, well regs, thank you so much.

And now here, Wright Thompson and Mickey Hart. And now for something completely different. Okay, we now welcome on two very, very, very special guests. It is Mickey Hart, the legend himself from the Grateful Dead and Wright Thompson Award-winning author. We don't read a lot of books, but we know Wright Thompson is a very good author. They have collabed for a new documentary that's coming out on ESPN that's gonna be out today as we're airing this.


It's called Rhythm Masters A Mickey Hart experience. I was lucky enough to watch it and it's unbelievable. I I wanna say that from the, from the jump, what you guys produced was incredible. Mickey, I I, I guess I, my first question is what, what made you wanna do this project? And kind of like what was the, what was the fire that lit you off? Like, Hey, I want to combine my world of drumming in sports in such a beautiful way. Oh, thank you very much. I guess you might call the genesis of it all was with Bill Walton, of course. Bill and I were good friends and he, once, he once mentioned to me that he thought basketball was very much like a band, you know, a basketball team.


And putting a ball through a hoop into an net was like string music. And I thought that was very interesting, you know, that he thought that he saw the musicality in, in basketball. And I, you know, and that, that started me thinking that, well, everything in this universe is full of rhythm. You know, vibration is the basis of all life And. it just extends on and on and on over and over. The rhythm of life, the rhythm of anything and the rhythm of the game. Sports, for instance, was always intriguing to me since I, when I grew up, when I was a little guy, I used to watch Bob Cey, the great basketball player who kind of almost invented modern basketball.


And I used to watch him And. it was actually in black and white and back in the day. And he was my first sports hero. And I thought, well this guy is, he's a great artist. I even knew that when I was a kid. And so there is the art of sports and basketball, for instance, and all those things kind of keyed me and writing about rhythm and different walks of life and so forth. And was, it was another extension of the philosophy. That rhythm is everywhere and you just have to find it. Yeah, Yeah.


It's fascinating. And Bill shows up a, a number of times throughout the movie right off the very start. I think he's the first voice that you hear in the picture. I'm curious to know how he introduced himself to you for the first time. What was your first experience like meeting Bill Walton, you know, him Bill a massive Grateful Dead fan. Well, it was back in, in when he won the championship in, in Oregon. And he came to one of our concerts and I looked down into the audience. It was a small place. It wasn't much, it was a theater, kind of a largest theater. And it. I thought everybody was sitting down and And. There was just one guy, you know.


And I thought, wow, why is, you know, why is the audience sitting down? There's one guy standing up and at my equipment, man, Rero. He said, no, no, no, that's Bill Walton. You know, the basketball player. You know, the, and I go, oh, really? I loved to watch him in U at UCLA. I saw a lot of the games and I was a huge Bill Walton fan. And, and I knew he was a deadhead. And I just said, bring him back. Bring him back stage. And that's how I met Bill Walton. It was at a concert. And Bill and I started a relationship, I don't know how many years ago, 45, whatever that 40 like, you know, and became best friends over the years.


Yeah. I mean we, we were lucky enough to interview him probably like six or seven years ago, And. it was just, it was incredible. He was one of those guys that If, you spent an hour with him. You felt like he was your best friend, And. it was, yeah. It was a blessing. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Right. You are, we, we were talking before this, you are a deadhead. I have to know because I'm a huge deadhead as well. How like, cool was it to be in this project and get so close to seeing how Mickey works and how the creative process comes about for such a legendary guy like that. Like, I mean, it's, it's such a cool experience for you, I would imagine as a deadhead.


Well, I, I would say this, you know, it's very cool obviously. 'cause you're like, you know, when you're 15 years old, these guys don't seem real. And then, you know, so you meet them. But I'll tell you, for me, less than a deadhead, it was like, as a person who tries to have a creative life, to see Mickey's work ethic, Mickey close your ears. I hate giving you compliments in front of you. But like, but I mean, his work ethic That's exactly right. His work ethic and his relentless drive to be creative, to push himself, to stretch, to find the boundaries and move through them.


It just was a real, it, it ca making this movie with him came for me at the exact right time in my own life. Just as a reminder of how you approach a creative life and how you don't. And so like, I don't know, you, you hear about these guys and you always wonder if the emperor has any clothes. You know, like, what, what are these guys gonna be like up close And? it didn't take long for us to understand that we were dealing with a minded work with, with an incredibly smart, educated person who also had a, an intuitive sense of his, one of the things he said that really stuck with me is, as you get older, you grow into your instrument.


Yes. Not outta it. Yes. And that really struck me as a, we are on a journey that lasts a lifetime, all of us. Yeah. And, it was just a good reminder for me of how to be, I mean, I, I couldn't be more grateful for the experience and like, making the movie is the tax we all have to pay to have the journey. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I just hearing your voice, right, it, it just took me into fall. I just thought it was a Saturday morning and I'm ready for college football right now. Yeah. You Know what? Like I can start talking about SEC football. Yeah, I know, I know you can. So did you have to kick him out of the, the recording booth? Did he wanna do some voiceovers for This movie? Mickey Wright is, is has been, he's been right a lot of times helping to produce and write the, some of this, this chatter.


It, it was a pleasure working with him and Tori Champagne and E-E-S-P-N in general, nice folks there, receptive to ideas and very loose and allowed me to have creative freedom with this. And you know, that's really what it's all about. When you're an artist, you have to have that kind of freedom to create something like Rhythm Masters, which I'm very proud of actually. It's, it's quite, quite a good story. It it takes rhythm into a whole other land. Yeah. And it exposes the idea that rhythm is essential in life. Yeah. Just in sports. But, and in, of course in drumming, that's the basis of drumming is, is rhythm.


But just in general, you know, it, it kind of gives you th gives you pause and lets, makes you think about, well, doing something right is in rhythm or wrong, is out of rhythm or hate or is out pieces in all that kind of, you know, the good rhythm and bad rhythm. Health is good rhythm disease, bad rhythm, you know, winning is good rhythm, bad rhythm is losing all of that kind of stuff was told in this movie. So it's more than just a movie just about sports. It's really tells a lot about, it talks about life in general as well.


And it's very important, especially to keep your equilibrium and your balance when you are, when you're famous, you know, as sports figures would be and how they deal with it off the court. Especially, you know, all of these athletes that I interviewed had such a spiritual take on it and very much like myself. It, it was very, it wasn't very different than how I think about rhythm and music and being in the now. And these things bring you into the moment. And that's very powerful emotional payload If you will dealing in, you know, at sports at this level, you know, the rhythm master level and you know, it, it And it And it, it also informed me as well, like about, you know, Mario Andretti, you know, and Marshawn Lynch, Bob czi, you know, Phil Jackson, all of these great players and influences, influencers like Phil, Phil Jackson, who's not only a great base basketball player, but a great human being and brilliant, you know, the zen master, you know, really.


And It was great to reconnect with Phil after a a few years of not not seeing him. So yeah, it was really very nourishing for me to talk with all of these, these great players. Some of them are, you know, heroes to me. Yeah. Phil Jackson talking about how he thinks about basketball in four, four time and the, and the two beats for anything to happen was, was really interesting. There was one thing that you said that that struck me and that was that you can go fast while you're not moving. So what does that mean? Well, it's about the power of concentration in the mind and focused. And when you focus on something, you can go fast, you can go slow.


When I'm up there and I'm playing like mad and I'm just going crazy, but inside I'm very calm and, and you know, and balanced and, and happy and so forth. So that allows you to be able to run a marathon or a sprint or just stand still, you know, sometimes I'm very still inside and outside, you know, it, you know, it is just, it, it, it looks like a, a would look like a frenzy in a way, but that's not really what's going on inside. You have to really be collected and and focused in order to go fast.


And, and in the same way to go really slow, you need to be able to have that balance to be able to, you know, encompass all speeds. So yeah, the mind is very powerful. So what the brain says the body does, so this really basketball, football mostly is about neurologic function is about how the brain operates and what signals it sends. And the brain is all about rhythm. You know, you got a trillion neurons firing every, you know, every second in your brain. And that's pure rhythm. So the, the ability to be able to coordinate your brain and your body movement, the idea of body mind connection is everything in sports and in life and in certainly in drumming.


So you can go fast, you can go slow, you can stand still If, you have the right head space for it because sports and music create a virtual headspace where you go, which is not like everyday life, like you're walking down the street or doing Anything else. It's very different. And that's the high of it all. Yeah, yeah. Well were gonna, you said you were, I feel like you were about to say something right? And I I do want to just hear you talk. Well, I was gonna say, like, when you talk about Mickey's, like relentless curiosity, I mean, the thing that drove it home for me was, I dunno, If you remember last year's tour, I mean, the biggest two tours in the world were Taylor Swift's Era's tour and then Den Company's summer tour.


And so we were out in San Francisco for that last couple of shows, and after the last night we went immediately back to Mickey's dressing room. I mean, the crowd is still sort of singing not fade away, the drones are still up in the air. And he comes in and locks eyes and the very first thing he says is, am I gonna have my sports highlights tomorrow? I mean, you know, my ears are to quote Bob Seger. I mean, my ears are still ringing from the echoes of the amplifiers. And, and he's already moved on. And I just like, you Know. Yeah. It's crazy that I actually had that question, Mickey, because it, it, it's, it, as a fan watching from afar, the grateful deader counterculture and their, and you know, the, the, the hardest touring band in history.


And like some people from afar might say, oh, well they, you know, they're just playing jam band music. Like whatever. But the, to to hear and read the stories about your guys' work ethic and the days and and years that you guys built, even before you became, you know, this incredible, you know, touring band you guys were playing day and night, And, it feels like that that work ethic and those hours put into it kind of get glossed over by maybe regular culture people and, and thinking like, oh yeah, they're just out there playing their ba you guys put in all these hours. So what was it like when you were getting to that point where you can all speak the same language on stage in an improvisational way that is so hard to reach that point?


And I think people don't give enough credit to, to how difficult, how many hours get into that. Yeah, you bet. We practiced every day, all day, you know, that it was, you know, we weren't, we weren't sitting around smoking dope or anything. Right. All, you know, and even if we were, we were playing, you know, constantly. So, and also, you know, it happened right from the beginning, you know, grateful Dead music was magic right. From the first, you know, drop of it. So it was just a matter of collectively getting it all together and being, presenting it to people because the music was something we were discovering.


We were falling on every day. We learned something every day. The more you played, the more you learned. And, and we didn't care really about, we weren't into the money or into the fame, and we didn't have hit records. We didn't do videos. So I don't know about counterculture, but we certainly weren't totally part of the music industry. We were maybe in parallel with it, but we certainly weren't part of it. We were in our own grateful Dead world, spawning our grateful dead mythology on our own with great songs and loving people all around. And we, we just had a great time in the early days.


And then it just kind of blossomed over the years, very slowly, very so like a turtle as opposed to the hair. And we are the turtle, but we finished the race and that's the important part. All those, all those rock stars with their jewelry and, and you know, the fancy hairs and all that, whatever, they, they fell by the wayside because it, it wasn't built on, it wasn't built on the right foundations. We were built to last. And I, I knew that right from the beginning. I, I thought it would, you know, we were thinking about doing this for the rest of our lives. Even when we were kids, we said, do you wanna do this the rest of your life?


Yeah, yeah, of course you do. but it is hard to, you know, to actually manifest that. Yeah. You know, you could talk about it, but to actually do it, there was a lot of ups and downs and like you rhythms, good rhythms, bad rhythms, fights, all kinds of things that we worked through to be able to come out on top as it were. You know, like Wright said, it was a great tour. The sphere was great. It was really an honor to be able to play there. And, you know, it was, it was a, the new experience yet again, a new experience for us. Yeah. And that nourished us. And so all this nourishment over the years, If you play, you get nourished If, you really play hard.


You play like you really mean it. And we meant it. Yeah. We were not kidding around. It was none of that, you know, it was, it was the music first. Yeah. Everything Else followed, but the music was first always and still is. Yeah. The sphere was incredible. I was lucky enough to go. I I basically spent the month after telling everyone how incredible it was and how my life will never be the same after going to the sphere one. I mean the, the, the drums in space, the visuals and what you put together there were just outta this world. Good. I I, I, I know you can't say, but I'm hoping that the sphere is not done for dead and company.


And, and maybe there's a future dates coming up because I, I was lucky enough on, on the second night I went, I was lucky enough to, to sit with John Mayer in his green room and he, I just spent 30 minutes profusely thanking him for keeping the music alive. And I wanna thank you as well. But tell me there's gonna be some more sphere dates or at least gimme a wink. Yeah. I, there's no reason why there wouldn't be. Okay. I love that answer. I love that answer. Let's put it, let's leave it at that. Yes. Yes. Because it's all, all, all I've been thinking about is getting back to the sphere. I gotta get back to the sphere. So right ahead. I I'm not joking. PFD can attest to it. Yeah. I've been telling everyone, like the people that leave Avatar, they won't talk about, they won't shut up about how great Pandora the planet looks and how they wish that they lived on Pandora.


That's Big Cat with the sphere. Yeah. It's like, I gotta get back there. Nothing is the, nothing is the sphere. My life is not the same without being in the sphere. So I Need to get back. It's, it's the next, it's the next step. But the, you know, we play stadiums which are made for baseball and football, you know, we play places that are not meant for music really. Or lights, you know, just pretty lame, you know, light show behind you one screen and once you see the sphere, then you understand what the future is Yeah. Of, of music and, and visuals. Yeah. And when they come together, it's very powerful.


It was, it was a real challenge playing in the sphere for a lot of reasons. Firstly, we, it was a, it's a new sonic environment that we had to get used to. 'cause we've never played, I mean, I thought it was suicide to play in the sphere, actually. I mean, sonically it's, it's just not done. But with all of the artificial intelligence and the 1600 speakers and the high def visuals, we made it come alive. We put a lot of time into making it feel like the Grateful Dead, you know? Yeah. Just like us. And so, and also to be able to stay focused for 30 shows in the same place.


We never did that. Maybe we played 13 or 12 days at Madison Square Garden in a row, but we never played 30 dates any place. Yeah. So to be able to stay focused was also a big deal. You know, only playing three nights. Normally our paces, two nights on went off, two nights on, and once in a while we'll play three because of the vocals. You know, it's hard to, for the, for them to, you know, do four in a row. That's, it's very, very hard. So yeah, I think that discipline was part of it, you know, and as you get older, you have more discipline.


Younger you, you know, you just, you are just, you just, the fuel is just youth. Yeah. But as you get older, then you gotta conjure another kind of power. And, and everybody really is drama free. It's really a great band now. It's, it's phenomenal. It, it's like just watching the, the iterations and it's just, it's great. It's, I, I can't thank you enough. I, and I, like I said, the drums and space was incredible. I was, I was one of the people laying on the floor. I Don dunno, If, you expected that to happen, that people were gonna lay on the floor 'cause of the vibrations. But that did happen. Yeah. It gave me pause when they said, oh, they're all lying on the floor doing it.


I go, what? You gotta be kidding. That never happened. People normally don't do that. Yeah. You know, but in the, in the sphere, you can feel the vibrations, especially in the seats, which is haptic seats. There's vibratory, there's speakers in the seats. And you can feel the vibrations when I go downtown, when I go low. And so, but the visuals, looking up at the visuals and how it, it, it kind of goes with the, with the percussion. With the drums. The drums sound for some reason sound really good in the sphere. Yeah. Better than any place else. I, it nobody can really quite describe the impact and that the drums deliver in the sphere for me.


And that was just a lucky, it was the luck of the draw that it just so happens. Yeah. That drums sound amazing in that place. You know, Mickey, I was gonna ask, you know, one of the things I thought in the sphere, was it the, one of those last couple of nights I was there, it reminded me of that the, the power and the communal spirit reminded me of that story you were saying about after Woodstock when you had your black lab and you could hear Sly in the family stone. And I, I just wonder, If you would mind telling these guys that, 'cause that, that makes the hair stand up on my arms still when I think about the sort of the communion of, of live music. Yeah. Well, that was a major moment.


I remember being on the Hill, And, it was after our set, I guess And, it was at night. And there were fires going all on the valley. You could see 'em all over. And Sly was just killing it. And they were all saying, wanna take you higher? Higher. So you hear 500,000 people going higher, higher. And you know, I never heard anything. Like, no one's ever heard anything like that before. And I was good friends with the drummer, Greg Rico, masterful drummer, amazing drummer. And he was nailing it. And it was total rapture really.


I mean, it was awesome. I mean, and the idea of awe as an awesome, you know, it really, you, you just had to sit back and go, wow. The power that we had, we weren't alone. He was 500,000 of us. No one's ever been able to assemble that be in those days anyway, you know, 500 of thousand of anything. Yeah. Alone, people being friendly, loving. And here the music is taking you to a place that you've never been before. Now that's power. And you talk about Rhythm Mastery. Well, that moment that night, they had it. And also Michael Shrieve, master Drummer, master with Santana.


Michael was a student of mine years and years ago before the Grateful Dead. I, he was one of my students. And there he was on the stage playing just out of his mind. Just incredible. So I was really proud of him that, that night, you know, when he played, when he performed. So Woodstock was really, it was inter very interesting. And life-affirming actually for me. Yeah. It's very cool. And I, I'm sure you've gotten this question before, but I, I have to imagine that being in a band like The Grateful Dead, it feels like it was something that was always meant to happen. You guys fit in so well together.


It's been such an amazing journey. People's lives have been changed. You've made so many friends. Was there a moment when you guys started to play, I'm sure you've played in other bands before, but as you're starting to either rehearse or play your first shows with the Grateful Dead, where you knew that something was different and something was special about this band? Well, Absolutely. When I first heard that, well, they were already just changed their names to the Grateful Dead. They were warlocks, the band was called Warlocks back then. And it, they just changed it to Grateful Dead. And when, and I was invited to their concerts. And when I first heard the band, I couldn't believe it.


I mean, it was so loud, And. it was so out out there, you know, and the music was just blossoming. It was a blues band back then. And they were playing the blues. Like I had never heard the blues before. And then I sat in and that was it. You know, we just came together and said, wow, this is the Grateful Dead. You know? And so, you know, Jerry said, man, we could take this around the world, you know? And we did. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, you know, and so yeah, I knew it right from the very first moment that Grateful Dead music was special, really special. And over the years, we nurtured that, you know, and, you know, and created what you now know as Grateful Dead Music.


It was a genre of music, really, you know, and with this, and we were improvisation, like Yeah. And that was different back then, you only, you only improvised in jazz. It was grateful that it was like a big, loud jazz band, you know, in a way with a big backbeat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so You could dance to this jazz and, you know, everybody was listening to Coltrane and, you know, all the great jazz guys. And, and I was listening to Indian classical music, so very complicated rhythmically.


And that's one of the things I brought to the, to the Brew, was that rhythmic complexity. Yeah. And yeah. And then we just shot from there, you know, that we took off. Yeah. I, I, I love the idea of a music executive somewhere listening to the Grateful Dead in the 19, I don't know, maybe the 1970s and figuring like, we gotta figure out a way to recreate this and try to make it like commercial and try to come up with a formula for it. While everything that you guys have done has been organic and just something that's naturally happened between you and your fan base throughout the years. Was there, were there other bands that tried to, tried to copy what you guys were doing as it went along? And you're like, you don't have it, man, it's not, it's not the same. No, in The beginning, nobody in the beginning and nobody could copy it because we were, it, it was so new they didn't know how to do it.


You know, they, they, I mean, when you invent something at, you know, then that's different. The people couldn't, you know, at first they couldn't understand it because it, you know, it was so different, you know, than any other kind of music and so intense back then, you know, remember we were just kids playing hard, really fast, hard music, you know? And very complicated actually. And then it got simpler and we started to learn how to, you know, work at these, these, these incredible tempos and being able to go 3, 4, 5 even more hours every night.


Back then, there was no unions and there was, so we could play, you know, we could play till we drop. Right. You know, we would, at the Fillmore East, we would start at about eight 30 and wound up about seven o'clock the next morning, you know? So, you know, there was nobody to tell us to stop. We didn't. Yeah. Now you have to, you know, now we've limited to three, three and a half hours, which is reasonable now. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Right. I had a question for you. So you are, your, your life has been sports and covering sports. You, you wrote a great book called The Cost of These Dreams, sports Stories, and Other Serious Business, which everyone, I should say, everyone go buy it on Amazon. It's, it's a great, great book.


But you've covered sports your whole life. Sports are your life. Was there something that you uncovered in making this and being around Mickey that you're like, wow, I never thought of sports this way? You know, that's a great question. Great. I never thought about that exactly like that before. Yes. And, it came through in several ways. One was Mickey was asking these athletes questions that it seemed to me that they had never been asked before and had been dying to be asked. And so I think that, you know, athletes are physical geniuses who move through a grid with other people.


And I think that sometimes they have trouble articulating, they'll say the games seem to slow down. And, it sounds like a cliche, but really it's just a physical genius who can't find the vocabulary to say exactly the complex things that are going on in their heads. And Mickey was asking, I mean, I need to just send you the full unedited Marshawn Lynch conversation because we used, We'd Love to, we used 90 seconds of it. And I'm telling you, that's the best sports interview I've ever heard. Yeah. And we, you, you should just run it because like Mickey got Marshawn and Marshawn got Mickey. They immediately understood each other as sort of fellow travelers along the same path.


And, you know, that that happened with Jack Laus. I mean, Jack Laus is famously prickly. And I didn't tell Mickey that beforehand. I thought it'd just be a fun social experiment to see what happened. And, but so Jack started off prickly, but by the end he was, he was putty in Mickey's hands. And so, and so I think it's that these guys spend a lot, these guys and gals, men and women spend a lot of time thinking about their interior life, their mental health. And I don't mean like reacting to stress. I mean, literally how do you process information? How do you deal with failure and success and egos and all of this.


And so it feels like they were getting asked questions that they'd never been asked before and have always wanted to be asked. There are three or four questions that became stock questions for Mickey that I'm definitely stealing. Yeah. Like, I'll, then I'll yeah, I'll ask everybody going forward three or four of these questions. And, and you're right, because when watching it, like I, the the one of it, it was phenomenal. Everyone should watch it. It, it's so unique and so different than, than what, you know, you think like ESPN documentary, it's so different and, and out of the box from that. But the, the Joe Montana part where he's describing a five step drop and a three step drop and the rhythm of it, and it's like, I almost got lost in it.


I was like, oh my God. Like I never, you, you just think like a quarterback drops back. That's something you see, it's a small part of the game. And just having him dissect it to such a minute level, it was, it was incredible. You're right. Like I I, I didn't even realize it till you just said that point of having the guys talk about it in a way that they had never spoken about it. I mean, I, I, I've written about Joe Montana, I've spent a lot of time with Joe and Jennifer Montana and wrote what I think is a very revealing story about him in which he, he said all sorts of stuff he'd never said before. And he said stuff on this interview with Mickey that I'd never heard him say before. And that was very early in the process too. And I was, it, it was interesting because Mickey said to me in our first conversation, we went up to his house in north somewhere in northern California.


And he, I tried and he was like, I can get them there. And I, I sort of clocked that and like, I made a little note And. it was like, Mickey says he can get them there. But I was like, all right, tough guy. Let's see. Yeah. You know. Alright. Big rock and roll star. Let's see how well you interview somebody. And just after Joe Montana, I knew this is gonna be really special. Yeah. 'cause Joe has been interviewed over and over and over and over and this was new shit. And I, I, so from that point on, I just, I couldn't schedule enough interviews. Yeah. I, by the way, I read the Joe Montanas P piece. You did. That was phenomenal.


Again, go by Wright's book. I can't recommend it enough. Read everything he's ever written. Yeah, right. Like the you Yeah. I, I even forgot that I had written or read your or Joe Montana piece that was, I remember reading it and being like, wow, I'd never even, like, I feel like I actually know Joe Montana now. So Mickey w was there one specific interview, so kind of like the same question to write where you asked someone something or a athlete revealed something that you had never thought of sports that way? Well, of course the Marshawn Lynch, like Wright said, was extraordinary because he talked about the spiritual side. Immediately I walk on the field, I look at the nearest goalposts, I circled the field to the right.


I circle the field to the left. I think about the people I'm going to hit and, and and, and, and, you know, and pray that they, you know, they won't get hurt. And you know, he was very, he just, just all kinds of wonderful things. Then there's the Phil Jackson interview where he really lays it out, you know, two beats, one beat, two beats more than two beats, you're out of time. So he really, he broke it down. You know, he put that quadrants, he goes here and here and here and If, you don't do this in two beats. And he talks about it in beats, which is, which relates to drumming. You know, you could say, well, beat is, everybody knows what a, a beat is.


And so Phil was of course a very articulate, very articulate, and everybody, Bob Coy, you know, he just talks about the art of the game and And, it is an art form. And, and Mario Andretti says the engines is vibrating. It's like a song he says. And when he said that, I go, oh yeah, Mario, that's it. It is a song. It was, it was really good. Yeah. So the game is a song. Yeah. It's A lot of, to a lot of athletes, they don't, they see it as musical. Yeah.


And that really just, you know, I, you know, I heard what, how build it, you know, spoke of it. But, you know, he was a deadhead and he was talking about, well I tell you one time we were backstage with his son Luke. Luke was the, was the coach of the, what do you call the lawyers? And he's back there and he's saying to Luke, he said, Luke is halftime. He said, okay, you gotta come out the first with like, with Bertha. You know, and then you then, then you, then you bring it back to playing band kind of a thing. And then you and I said, bill, give the kid a break, man.


You know, he's the coach, you know, spectators here. And, and, but he saw it in musical terms and a lot of, and that's one of the, the most interesting parts of it, besides the spiritual nature, which I knew athletes had to have it in order to access the, the, the, the flow state where everything moves and you're not even thinking about it and you're in the moment. And all of these things which Rhythm, Masters have to know if If, you don't know that you're not a rhythm master in anything. Whether you're painting the fence or you're a, you know, a great carpenter or you drive a great semi.


These are all Rhythm Masters. 'cause they were able to get into that flow state and to be, you know, in the now. So it doesn't have to be drums or drumming, or it doesn't have to be sports. You can be a rhythm master in anything. Yeah. Yeah. If, you know, how to get into these states, these flow states, which is about consciousness. Yeah. And be aware of who you are and what you're doing and where you're going. And then also to be able to let it go. Yeah. And then just be in the moment. You can think at a mi over and over and over again. But you have to let thinking go and just be, and that's not easy when you're in the middle of, you know, when you're in the middle of that, you know, that cathartic moment.


So that's, that's what I brought, brought back from this. I had a great time interviewing all of these athletes. And like Wright says, you know, some of them were a little, they didn't know how to approach the interview. You know, they thought this is gonna be a straight interview about how great they were. But that really wasn't really on my mind at all. 'cause they were all great. That's why I talked to 'em. Yeah, yeah. Getting down to the human level, that was the real outstanding part for me. Yeah. You had these moments where you look it up and Mike Piazza is talking about Tigers and Ozzy Smith is talking about Newtonian physics. Yeah. And you're just like, or am I, yeah.


Yeah. I just was like, okay. I mean, one of the things you learn, one of the things you learn if you're riding shotgun with Mickey is just hang on. Yeah. Like, you know, the circus is in town. And so, you know, my my 5-year-old thought Mickey was like some sort of magic creature, you know? Oh, yes. Is she didn't know he was this Oh, I know. Yeah. But she didn't know that. She just ran right up to him and gave him this huge hug outta nowhere. And then I later found out that Mickey had given her cookies. So that was, but no, it, it, it just, man, the experience of watching him do this work, as someone who was a fan of the music, you know, they say don't meet your heroes.


And I mean, we're very lucky to report that, you know, he's got, he is an incredibly, incredibly talented musician, thinker and writer, but it just also a good guy. Yeah. Like we had fun. This was a fun project. There was very little drama as he said. It was, you know, Tori Champagne, who Mickey and I both call the adult in the room, did a lot of work and really brought the thing home. And it, it, she did. I I just had a great time doing it. And I mean, that's what I'm grateful for. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, being able to tap into something that an an athlete at the peak of their game has always thought in their own, either they thought it consciously or they've known it their entire lives.


And it's, it's how they go about their business. They think about approaching something as simple as a three step drop in this very personal way that you can tap into and immediately have them speaking your same language that you understand. It ties back into like just the universal nature of rhythm, which I think is, it's a really interesting thing to dive into. And then you talked about getting in that flow state being still, but going fast at the same time. I think you discovered the zone. I think that's what being in the zone is. That's when an athlete says like, everything slows down. I think now we can do more work to quantify what the zone is and try to figure out how to get there. It's fascinating stuff to dive into.


I'm, I'm curious to know, as a drummer, there's a, to me there might be a difference between sports at their highest level and playing music at the highest level, but maybe I'm wrong about this. And that's the, the inherent nature of competition that you have in sports and in music. I feel like it's not as much of a competition against somebody else beating somebody else as it is doing, you know, maximizing your own ability or, or playing to the highest of your capability. But may, maybe I'm wrong, maybe there is a competitive drive in in a lot of musicians. Yeah. Maybe there are, you know, but that's second fiddle.


Actually the most important thing is, you know, when I go on stage, I try to empty my mind and try to be very relaxed and I try to make everybody on the stage play good. You know, I'm for them, you know, I'm trying to lay down a real good groove so, you know, Bob or whoever can, you know, just ride on it, you know, and have a great time. And then I get down to business, you know, And it. But the most important thing is to make everybody feel like they're part of a team. And there's no competition on the stage. Absolutely none. And If, you might be competing in your mind with some other drummers, some and far away, you know, thoughts and stuff.


But really it's, it comes down to, you know, I think the empathy in music and the empathy in sports are really important. People don't realize how much people care for their oth their teammates. It's love you, you attached to them in some way. You don't have to go home with them, you know, and, and hang out all the time. But when you're together, you feel this connection. And that's part of getting into the zone. Now when you talk about the flow state, I, it really came together with me when I started writing my first book, drumming at the Edge of Magic in 1990, I think it was.


And I started investigating these trance religions, Santaria, ble. And most of the cultures out there in the world have to do with trance, Indian music. And even even American music had that, you know, even the early rock and roll, there was these trance states that we would get into that, that we couldn't define. And then all of a sudden we realized that it was just focus and concentration and moving into these others, these other mindsets and allowing the body to flow. And now we can articulate it. And that's what's been happening in the last, you know, 30, 40 years, is that we know a lot more about how to get into these trance states.


Which basically that's what the, all of these, these things are, it's a, it's trance is not a bad word or any, you know, it's not, it's a strange word, but when you go down the highway and you miss an exit and you're daydreaming, you're in a big puppy trance. Yeah. You know, And it not harmful or anything. These things aren't harmful. Yeah. But they're, once you know how to go in and out of them and how to stay there, then that's the key to be able to win. And all of these Rhythm Masters that I interviewed are winners. They know how to go there, how to stay there, and they know how to win.


Yeah. And the sports is just, you know, it is just a miniature of life is what we do with rhythm only in sports, it's all about rhythm. Without rhythm, there could be no sports. Yeah. You know, just be running into each other and, you know, and not having no teams. Yeah. You know, there no teamwork or any of that stuff. So the basis of it all is rhythm, whether they realize it or not. Now it's going to be a educational moment. This film could be looked at in those terms for a lot of people and allowing their minds to be able to understand what they're doing or what they did.


Or other people looking at sports in a different way. You know, it's, these are very complicated. Thi these are states of minds. These are not, unless you know what you're doing and how to get there and how to stay there, you can't win. Yeah. Because you, you just swimming upstream so that it tells a lot of stories. This, this, this Rhythm Masters work. Yeah. So this has been phenomenal. We appreciate both of your times.


I have one last question. It's a Rollback question. R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo code. Take 20% off your first purchase. QIPs Polos hoodies, joggers shorts. So everyone please do watch Rhythm Masters out debuting tonight on ESPN as you're listening to this.


Mickey, I, I, this is a dumb question. I'm sure you've gotten it a million times, but when someone asks me, you know, what is your e explain Your Love for the Grateful Dead. I, I basically say, listen, the, the beauty of is it, is that I don't even know what my favorite like song or show is because it changes every day. And I'll find a show that I'd never heard, and that will be my favorite show. Or a song that something unlocks in my brain. I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm listening to this song and I never listened to it this way. But is there a specific time and place that you look back to and you're like, everyone has their own favorites, but your own personal, like, that's, that's where it was.


That was what I look back at and I daydream about maybe that year or that little era or whatever it may be, that you just, something that unlocks in your brain when you find yourself, you know, kind of drifting off. Well, one show was really in Cornell in 77. Yep. That 77 show in Cornell. There was a few songs that night that was superb just beyond, you know, anything we've ever played before there. But you know, there are nights just sprinkled all through the 60 years of playing when you play good. That's, you know, that's it.


You can, if it's one, even one song, sometimes it happens. And then the rest of the songs, you can't quite get it. But whenever the magic happens, then, then it, then that's everything. Yeah. You know, that's your whole life. Remember, I've been playing most of my, my life in my whole life actually pretty much. I've been playing for 70, some, 75 years. So, you know, it's everything. You know, you put everything you have into it, And, it gives it back to you, you know, in a lot of ways. Makes you happy. And it, it does things to you physi physiologically, whereas you're, it reduces your stress.


It makes, it makes you a better life. It makes you learn how to love, because that's what music does and that's what sports does. Yeah. You know, you, you can't play great sports and not love it. And so you learn about love, you learn about empathy, and you learn about the good. Yeah. And So it's much deeper than just playing a sport. The, the, the benefits you get from it are extraordinary. The more you put in, the more you get back, the longer you can stay there, the better it is. And never quit. Never stop unless you have to. And that's, of course, a lot of times it's ripped away injuries and so forth.


Same thing happens in my work injuries all the time. You know, you have to, you have to overcome them and you have to heal yourself and come back again. So it's just not like getting up there and playing the drums. You know, I have to train every tour. I train for months to get up there and be able to relax and just, you know, not hurt myself. Yeah, Yeah. And I'm, and the same way in sports, you know, so you have to understand that these players are really, they put in so much time, all of us, any professional that's at this level, you know, has to give their heart to it.


And and there are benefits to that. When you give yourself up and your heart to the, to something you, it, it's, it is really hard to describe, but, but what you take away from it and what you take from that power into your regular life is really what's important. What do you I hope that the people don't leave the music where at the, at the hall, you know, at, at the venue that they take that feeling home and do good with it. Yeah. That's, and that's really the payoff for me. If I, if I know that's happening, then I've done a good job and I feel great about it.


Yeah. It, it was not just about the concert, it's about what you do with that feeling. Yeah. Well, Mickey, thank you so much and Right. Thank you so much. Everyone, go watch it. It was an incredible movie. And Mickey, I'm I'm holding you to it. You did say that you guys were gonna do some more sphere dates. That's me. You might not have, you might not have exactly said that, but that's what I took from it. So that's Not exactly what I said. That's not exactly what you said, but that's exactly what I heard. And it. It's all up. That's what I meant. Yeah. It's all up to interpretation, But I didn't say it. Yeah, but yeah, but that's what he Meant. Yeah, that's where you meant. So thank you so much. This was a thrill and we really appreciate it. And everyone go see Rhythm Masters and thanks so much guys.

Listen, Football's gonna be back soon. We, this was fun. I had fun today. Yeah, Don't worry about it. Hank, once football's back and the Patriots are in gear, I'm sure you're not gonna be talking at all. Yeah, too much Hank and too much hating from Hank. And that's all right. But I will say this memes, he sent me some hater questions. I was like, send them and then he just, and said, send me questions that are gonna make it look like I asked. He said they're set up questions, so Oh, no. Rude Longtime. A WL I've noticed means Can't Exist. I've noticed that. It seems like every single guy in the crew now loves the West Colorado. Grit Week. Arizona Super Bowl Chill week. Have you Ever thought again?


I did Not. I did not. This is, I did not pick these questions. Have you ever thought about a winter trip out West? Oh, winter trip out west. We don't really do winter trips because I think you guys would love an Aez ski trip after the Super Bowl. Maybe hit the slopes, check out some other sports scenes. And. It's a vibe. Apre Ski, Much love. Yeah. What is it ap Pray Ap. Pray ap, pray after Ski. We, we don't usually travel that much in the wintertime because we've got football on tv and then we've got the, the Super Bowl. I guess we did go out west last year for the Super Bowl to Vegas. Yeah. But yeah, we don't really travel that much in the wintertime. I, I love it out west. Yeah, I I, I had great time. We're gonna go to Tahoe every year. Grit Week will not be out west next year.


We did, I think we've actually Talk about San Diego Week. We've kind of done a good If. you look at the grit week, year after year. The last time we went out west was five years ago. So this was the first time in five years that we did it just happened that we did Tahoe. Yeah, Tahoe will be every year. Yeah. I mean the West Coast is a hidden gym. It is Los Angeles. You wanna talk about it? Los Angeles is great. California. California. Malibu, hidden Gym. They Should write some songs about California. I don't think that would play The boo. Where's the furthest place you would travel if it meant you got to interview one of your white whales? White whale. So like Katie Belichick, Molly, who else?


Yao Ming. Brady. Brady. Ying, white whale, Key West. I would go, I would go to Brazil. They would eventually be back. Brady probably wouldn't be in Brazil. So I don't know why I, Columbia, it Wouldn't make sense in my head. I'd be like, aren't you coming back? Hank would you go to Hawaii to interview Tom Brady? Yep. Wow. I Mean, he was a shocker. That's far, that's far. I guess Hawaii. I'd go to Europe. Hank, would you go to Japan? Would You go to the beach? But I would just simply say, aren't they coming back? What If the answer was no, Katie's never coming back. He might not, he was having fun on that water slide. Dude, I love that water slide pick.


He's the most relatable. Put your arms up like a little kid. Our last one. Hey guys, just curious how close of friends you are outside the show. Do you consider each other more of coworkers or friends? Family. I think, yeah, it's closer than friends. Actually, Mickey Hart kind of got on it where it was like he had a, a line there in the interview where he was like, you know, maybe you're not spending every second outside of it, but when you're, when you're in it together, there's no bond like it. Yeah. And that's kind of how it is. I mean, I spend outside of my immediately family, I spend the majority of my time with everyone in this room. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. I mean, we're not going out on Friday night because we're spending 70 hours together.


Yeah. And and also like if you've got three kids, it's probably not Yeah, you probably can't be like, Hey, I'm gonna hit happy hour. I would say, I would say it's close. It's as close to family as you can get. Like I consider you guys my family. Yeah, I do too. And that's what I'm saying, like it is, it's, it's Family. I was thinking about that the other day. Like the fact that we've been working together for eight years. Eight years, nine years. Eight years. Eight years. Is it eight full years now? Eight full years. Eight and a half. Eight And a half years. 11 for me and Big. Cat. Yeah. Yeah. Eight and a half years. And like most shows, If, you work with anybody for eight and a half years, there will be little petty conflicts that end up driving the show up post. Not us. Not us. No petty, None of that. No.


And the fact that we've avoided going at each other's throats at all. Yeah, completely. Completely. It's, it's actually great. It's very healthy for me and Big Cat to have Hank in this place. Oh Yeah. He absolutely is a, he's he's nuclear deterrent. Yeah. He it is crazy though. Listen, like, I mean, even what recently it was Jesus Romero, you know, the whole documentary about Francesa and, and Mad Dog just not speaking off air. Yeah. Like we are very blessed. What? No, it's what you Do I mean. I think that you guys have joined in hating me and that has helped you guys. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very useful position. I was thinking the other day, I, I dunno if I said this on the show, but I feel like the first 10 years of your life you don't really remember.


Or like, you're not really in control of, it's basically your parents, you know, they set up your play dates, they set up what you're doing, they set up your hobbies, whatever. And then 10 to 20 you're kind of in more control. You know what you're doing, you know what you like. But so it's basically 10 to 20, 20 to 30 for me. And it's like half my life has been with Yeah. You guys. Yeah. The, I I I texted you guys. It's a third, but it, but you guys were out, right? I get what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. The last week of August when I was here and you guys were out, I texted you like, what day two. And I was like, I miss you guys because it, it was like, obviously there's a lot of people that I work with here and I I love all of them, but it was, except for Brandon. but it was very weird not having you guys here. I was just like, I kept on like, kind of wandering around being like, oh, I wonder what Max is up to.


I wonder what PFT is up to. Oh shit. They're not here. Yeah. So don't ever leave again. Okay. Hank? No. What do you mean? No, I will leave again. God Vacations. Yeah. I I feel like coming to work is a vacation. No, it's about to be that that is true. Well, You don't think that I Do I just like, again, whatever we're, we've been doing for so long, I've said this a million times. We work a lot. I like to, I like to recharge and refresh. Like To play a lot. Yeah. And by recharge and refresh Come back violently hung Over super hungover. Say here in water show. That's true. On Sunday Was, it was on on Sunday again. It was on Sunday.
