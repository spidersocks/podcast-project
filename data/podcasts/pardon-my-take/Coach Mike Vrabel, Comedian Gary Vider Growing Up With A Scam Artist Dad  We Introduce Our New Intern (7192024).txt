We also have a, a very interesting interview with comedian Gary Vier, who has a new podcast out that everyone should go listen to. Called number one dad, basically talking about his childhood, living with a father who was a scam artist, and he had these crazy stories. He snuck into MSG with his dad over 50 times.


Awesome. Interview with him. We're gonna try to do the Mount Rushmore Pizza toppings for real this time. It's our third try at this. We tried it last year. We tried to run it back and, and give Hank a shot at redemption. Hank threw it right off the top, taking spinach in the first round. Yeah. So, but, but I think Hank's really turned around his attitude's much better. I was watching the old clip and Hank used to be just in a sour mood all the time. Yeah. Didn't want to talk, didn't wanna participate. All he did was complain that we ruined Mount Rushmore season. But Now, it is the summer of Hank. He's, we've got a new boy. Yep. And he's chipper's hell. So different guy. This is gonna be great. Different guy. And then we also have the introduction of our intern. So we're going to, we, there's an extra person in here, our new intern, who we all are fond of.


He's been in the office for a couple days now, but we've kept him a secret because we wanted the a WL to see him first. So we'll finish then with Fire Fest. But we have an awesome show.

They, they really stink it up for a while. Yeah. Be honest. It looks like you just jumped in the ocean. Yeah. I mean, I've got curly hair anyway, so this is, I told 'em, use the tightest, smallest rods they could find. How long does it last? I think until I like wash it out. So tonight. Oh, Tough. Yeah. No, I'm not, not gonna wash out too much. I can see why you put it off for so long. No, I didn't put it off. Hank you missed it. Meme screwed it up.

We're doing Mount Rushmore of pizza toppings today for the third time. We've done it twice. The famous first time we threw it. Well, we didn't throw it. We were just trying to help our boy. Yeah. Second time Hank threw it. Third time. We're gonna do it for real. For real. Yeah. For real, for real. Okay. So you got your perm. I kind of like it. Yeah, it looks good. I'll tell you what, cruising in the El Camino with a perm hanging out. Yeah. That's a good look. You're basically A time traveler. I'm pretty much from 1970. Yeah. I'm, I'm living Dazed and confused. Yeah. So we have a couple sports things to get to before we get to Mount Rushmore. But the other thing we have to get to, there's another person here and we have our intern and his name is Matt or Matthew.


Matthew. I'd prefer Matthew. Okay, great. Matthew. Okay. Why would you prefer Matthew? Are you I think I'm a little too fat for Matt. Okay. I think, you know, Matt's, you know, last six months, they've probably gotten laid. Yeah. Right. Matthews And you have not, you know, Hey, you Said it. Okay. Maybe you lose a couple pounds, then you lose the letters. Yeah. Then you'll just be matha. But, but Then what's the point? Yeah. Yeah. So I, you know, when you came in for the interview, we instantly fell in love with you. I'm a little disappointed that you're not wearing the suit again, because the suit that you wore was a good look. Yeah. It, it was a good look. I got it. I mean, I, I can bring in any Day. Okay. So you got, you got your one suit. Yeah. Matthew, we'll, we'll get your backstory real quick in, in a second.


And then, and we also give you a task. Matthew blew us away. He, he came in the wettest handshake of all time, which by the way, I don't know, If, you guys shook his hand on Wednesday his first day. I did. Yeah. Still Wet. Still wet. Always damp, still Wet. Still wet. These are moist little boy. So he Had an upper lip that was just wet as could be. And then he sat down and we started talking. He is NBA hole on Twitter with a W. With a W. And we were asking about it, and he said that the, he, he had a NBA podcast called NBA hole. But he then decided he was going to, you know, equal time here, we're gonna add the women's.


So he became NNBA hole with the W And then we asked if we could listen to his podcast. And we're like, Hey, how many episodes have you done? And he is like, I've been doing it for a couple years. I got over 200 episodes. Like, great, well listen to it. He said, well, I accidentally deleted over 200 of my episodes. So that right there was basically like, we need this guy. Yeah. We need you. We need you. That, that seems like the kind of guy that would fit in real well around Here. Yeah. And then, and then I think he also had a, did you have another podcast? Yeah. That also accidentally fell into the same category of waste. Okay. That one. But yeah, that one was more of like a, just a whatever, you know, whatever floated my boat type of podcast.


Okay. Okay. What does float your boat? You know, just whatever is in, I'm in the mood for Yeah. I'm a big, you know, sports and those are my hobbies. Gambling, obviously, I'm a big horror movie fan. So I like to get into, you know, weird, you know, thoughts and, you know, which killer could kill me quicker, you know? Okay. Okay. You know, type of thing. Which guy could I, you know, do I have a shot against, you know? Yeah. Who do you have a shot against? Penny Wise. Okay. You're ready with that? Yeah. Never Seen it. He, well, you never, you never need to. Is that it? Yeah. Yeah. It that scared the fuck outta, I saw it way too young as a child. The first one. Yeah. And I shouldn't have seen that movie. And I saw it And.


it was the scariest thing ever. All right. So Matthew, give us a backstory. Give us what, who, where are from, Where are you from? What are you about, What are you about, what are you, what were you doing before this? Just, you know. Yeah. I'm from Detroit, a little bit north of Detroit. More specifically a small little town called McComb. Okay. A high school. We got a lot of cougars out there. 'cause that's our high school name. Okay. You know, a couple hot moms, but you know, lot, lot more young studs than won, won a state title this year. Oh. Oh, you think so? Oh, we were like, first place in the state, you know, like, what, A year or two years ago? We, You're asking, you're saying it like, we know we Don know. Yeah. What's sport? What sport? Well, I'm hoping somebody else. I Don. So we're talking like the football team.


They're going to win state this year in Michigan. I, that's the goal. Okay. That's the goal. Every year I'm gonna hold you that. I'm gonna be become very, very, I'm going to pay a lot of attention to Michigan High school football. Do it. You're gonna be in it for rude awakening. Well, you don't even know what team he roots for. Yeah. Come on. What if he roots for McComb? You're not gonna No, I'm, I'm a Kalamazoo guy. Oh, well we, we have a rival. Yeah, I know. Okay. Who's the rival? Chippewa. Okay. Yeah. Chippewa boy. That's my team. Yeah. They went under A name change a couple years ago. Yeah. Now they're just the football team. Yeah. What, What, what happened? I think they're the Big Reds now. Okay. And they, That's Almost worse. Yeah. That's, that Might have been the old name.


They changed, they won this title in 2019. So we're, you know, we're, we're, we're falling behind them. Okay. So, so you, you're from north of, of Detroit, Michigan. Yeah. Did you go To college? Not one bit. I took one, one English class once where? At a community college in Macomb. Okay. Nice. Why, Why'd you take one class? Well, I just wanted to get it tested out, you know, to see how I could do and the college life. See how I, you know, just, I was working. So just let's add one thing. See if I can manage a class. Manage the extra hours. Couldn't Okay. The extra hour. Yeah. It wasn't about an hour and a half Extra. So what, what kind of jobs did you have after high school?


So I've done, you know, lot, lots of odds and ends. A cook prep, cook laborer, non-union, you know, so just done It all that good. Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't know what a union looks like. Okay. What does laborer mean? That seems it could be anything. Exactly. That's the best kick. Picking Things, things up. Putting things down. Yeah. Putting, giving birth. Yeah. Putting some drywall maybe. You know, I'm, I'm the grunt work, so, you know, demo up and down the stairs, you know, I was the one gear, everything. So Randy didn't hurt his back type of thing. Yeah. And then, yeah, like, you know, just helping, you know, hold stuff, get this, yeah. You know, nothing skillful. That sounds illegal. Well, like, Hey, hold this for me. No, not like, hold this, hold this bag for me.


No, Hold the ladder up. Oh, okay. So I can walk, you know, so I can install the Light. Got it, got it. Got it. That Type of hold. Okay. And yeah, just, just kind of stuff like that. Just, I wouldn't say anything too skillful, but yeah. We gotta get you together with Jerry. Oh. Oh, Me and Jerry. Oh, oh Boy. Me and Jerry had a night last night. They are very good friends. Yeah. Already. Okay. Yeah. You, you Remind me. They share a lot of interest. You remind me a lot of Jerry, right off the Bat, they share a lot of interest. How much Money are you gonna have To, of political interests? Yeah. You're Not gonna have to loan it. You're gonna have to earn it. Okay. Alright. So, so the, the podcast that you started, NBA hole. Yeah. I kinda wanna just call you whole. I've been, I've been, I don't know. I like Matthew for some reason.


Whole Is good. I think whole Matthew, We're just a nickname company though. Like, I need Nicknames. I know, but it's, it feels like he's a Matt guy and then Matthew's almost his nickname Or intern whole. I Think I'm going whole. Okay. I Don't know. With The w That's a weird, or just like our guy Whole I, we call memes. Yes. At the, at, at Tahoe is introducing himself to celebrities. Like, Hey, what's up Hank? And he goes, Hey, I'm memes, but memes. And then people are just like, what Memes Makes sense. He's a memes guy. He's, but Saying memes to another human being is weird. Yeah. Saying it's like, it's, but that's the beauty Of it. Okay. All right, well, we'll, we'll work on, let's not, You have a kid named Pug Also Matt and, Well, he is a dog. Matt and Max sound a lot alike.


Matthew. That's what I'm saying. Matthew. I like Matthew, but okay. We, we'll figure it out. Let's not, we can't decide right now. No. Let's see how he goes. He's gonna do something stupid. So you started the podcast. What inspired you to start your own podcast? I just love sports and I just, you know, I like to a place to kind of go and talk about it and kind of avenue, you know, funnel it down into a, a place where I, I mean, I'll be honest, like, I've listened to my own podcast like two to three times over. What? That's crazy. Yeah. I wanted to understand. Wait, so were you listening to your podcast? So you had another podcast to listen to? Or were you making your podcast? Or you had another podcast to listen to? No, I was just, I was making it just so I could go back and listen to myself and, and, and learn how I like talked and my Beat. Oh, okay. That's good. Yeah. Like, And, and practice that so that it was like, you know, 'cause I can sit down and, you know, hear somebody else talk and, and talk about, you know, I can sit there, there we go.


I can sit there and hear somebody else talk and, and, and, you know, do all that. But when it came to myself, I just wanted to, you know, actually understand how, you know my beats and, you know, my emotions and, you know, at the end of the day, like you could talk, but then you're not listening back to what the film, it's, it's, it's Going over game Tape all 22. Except for you when you deleted it all. Well, listen, I already listened to it back twice. I had all the, you know, the information Out there. Is there something that you listened back to that you, you changed about how you did The, the podcast? Like, I just like certain, like in and out of topics making like how I would transfer it from one topic to another, just making sure those transitions were a little bit better understanding, making sure that like, there was a little bit more of a beginning, middle and end to my points and not just a point that, you know, didn't know where it was gonna fizzle out.


So just kind of being a little bit more prepared for those things. Not even necessarily writing it down, but just mentally knowing where to take that. Okay. So let's, let's show everyone what you can do. So why don't you tell us your order of teams, like your, your fandom, order of teams, you can do college as well. And then transition into the first thing we asked you to do, which was we want the top 10 current basketball players in the world. So that's NBA and WNBA combined. Okay. Alright. Alright. Well, first off, I guess I, I'll give you my rundown on my teams. First off, as you can see, I'm repping them proudly defending reigning, undisputed national champions Yeah.


Of the college football world, the Michigan Wolverines. Okay. So the, the football team will go one Dan Campbell and the Detroit Lions are gonna have to take a, a nice spot at number two. Number three, sadly my, my loyalty goes out to Tommy Gores and the Detroit Pistons. Okay. Four Dusty May coming into Michigan. Wolverine basketball. Okay. Taking them back. I like that. Fab five is gonna be fabulous once again. Okay. Yeah. Then you know, tigers and Red Wings are, you know, they're, they're at, they're at the bottom. They're tied down there. Okay. Are you, are you a Michigan man? I'm a Michigan man of heart. What makes a Michigan man? Well, that's a good question.


Hard work and that's about it. Okay. Okay. What, what would you say to people who might call you a Walmart Wolverine? You're not a half wrong. Okay. You know, I think that's a fair statement because I think at the end of the day, I think it's fair to say the Wolverines have a little bit of pride and prestige and, you know, a lot of doctors and lawyers go there. Yeah. So when you, you never went to Michigan and you never even touched the university. But then you're sitting there saying, look at these boys. These are my boys. It feels a little, you know, it feels a little fucked up. I listen, I, I I, I don't, I don't prescribe to the theory the Walmart wolvery. I think you should root for whoever you root for.


That's what college And. it doesn't fucking matter. If you were to say that about everyone that cheered for every like SEC team. Yeah. It's stupid. There's a level Prestige. Yeah. But gatekeeping that stuff is the dumbest thing in my mind. That's so, alright, so those are your teams. Oh, oh yeah. And then, you know, and, but at the end of the day, but those teams are awesome. They are nowhere near as awesome as these 10 people in and out of the NBA and WNB world. See, that was great. Transition was a great transition. And, and last, we're gonna start with number 10. The, the old man himself. The man who's done it before and he'll do it again. LeBron James. Do You think he's gonna win another title? He Could wait. Are you a LeBron fan?


I, I like excellence. Okay. Okay. And He's been excellent. Okay, So you are a LeBron fan. Okay. For now. What do you think about him making the Lakers draft his son? Man, it was disappointing. LeBron's a better person than that. And I think at the end of the day, sure he's gonna play with Bronny one day. But it's, I like that You're Disappointed. You actually are disappointed. Yeah. Like, yeah. What about, I mean, I always say you're feeling it. A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. Well, he would, that's what I always say. Maybe he was trying to speedline that process. Yeah. And bringing Bronny to his team. Yeah. So, you know, just disappointing.


Okay. Just, you know, made me look at him differently as a father. Oh, that's what I was saying. Oh, okay. Yeah. Number nine, not a father. Are you a dad? No. Okay. And neither is this guy? I don't think Joel and Beat. Okay. I think he, yeah, Definitely is a father. He's 100% a father. 100% a father. Oh, right. Arthur is the name of his son. Yeah. I got a dog named Arthur. So, Alright, so he is number kind of Dog. A komsky. Who's that? Like a, a, a little, That's the chief of staff for Coach O at LSU. Remember Hus? A Husky. A husky Pomeranian. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. He's a little thing. Okay. Joel. Well, you know, dying, but you know, at the end of the day, is he gonna do it?


No. Number eight. I like how he did. That was a great like, sports broadcaster thing. You didn't even answer your own question. Is he gonna do it? And then just go to the next one. Number eight, A guy who arguably maybe shouldn't be on this list, but You made it. That's why I'm arguing. Okay. You're arguing with yourself. Love this. But He's probably the best ball handler in the world. Magical. Some say Kyrie Earth. Whoa. Okay. Yeah. I, I don't hate that. At the end of the day, if you're gonna If, you wanna win a game, he can help you do that. Turns out he more than Joelle. He, He was hurt at the end of last season. He got, he just got surgery. Okay. Yeah. Well, he is Kyrie, this is, there's a lot of big names left.


Seven Giannis Kubo. Okay. Good Job. Yeah. A great Greek freak. He's, you know, a couple, couple rough seasons and, and the Bucks are a rough organization right now, but they're gonna be all right. And if they have him, they'll manage. Okay. Six. Obviously the man who still does it. Stephan Curry. Okay. He, I think he just performed pretty well against Serbia. I think he was 18 in a couple minutes. Rivalry game. Yeah, He great kid. Gonna keep doing big things. Hold, Let me interrupt you for a second. Is that, is your accent, is that a Michigan accent? Nervous Michigan? That is. Okay. Yeah. You, Steph Curry's like 34.


Yeah, he's like 10 years older than you, right? Yeah. He's a Young guy, great kid, great Kid. Not even 40. He's got a whole life in front of him. Number five, the man himself. SGA. Okay. Shane Ress, at the end of the day, he does, he does great things. And his, his ceiling is, he's blown my expectations outta the water. Yeah. Okay. Number four, maybe a pretty controversial pick. Victor Wynn Bema. Okay, I like this. Let's get him out there. Oh, By the time this man can rent a vehicle, he will be the best player in the world. Wow. What is that? 25? Yeah, 20, 25. So we got like four years. Yeah. I mean, to me the, the sky is nothing but a limit When you put it that way.


Like that, it seems like he's about to be the best player in the world. Yeah. You say 'cause he, you would assume he'd be able to rent a vehicle. No, he can't. Can't now. Yeah. But he will be three more years probably. How old is he? I Think he's like 21. 20. How old are you Matthew? 25. Okay, so you can rent a vehicle. Yeah. He's 20 years old. Five more years. Alright, Number three on this list. The only woman, oh, I wanna, I wanna make clear, let's make it clear now. Asia Wilson, oh, Good Call. She averages 12 rebounds, two steals, three blocks, four more points per game than second place in the league.


Her, her EFF, which is her overall efficiency is nine more than the second place girl. Wow. And as points rebounds assist steals blocks to gather minus field goals and missed free throws. Oh. Per game internals. Her, I think her, her at being the best woman in the world compared to the second best woman in the world, the gap is as, as long as, as strong as, as big as Patrick Mahomes to the second best quarterback in football during the playoffs. Specifically the Playoffs. Okay. Just, she is just, you're confident with her.


You're, you know, she's skillful, she's athletic, she's insanely talented. Yeah. She can do it all. You're not worried about what she can't do. You're worried about what she can do. Alright. Against them. And She's gonna be the Yep. Okay. Who's the second best quarterback in the NFL in the oh, Oh. During playoff time? I, I would take Joe Burrow. Okay. Alright. At the end of the day, you know, good answer. He hasn't been, you know, yeah. He's been injured. He's come back. Number two, a teammate of a man we named earlier Luca Dockage. Okay. You know, you just, what he does his, his overall stat line, just impressive as can be a little bit of a beer belly, but hey, I'm no one to talk.


Same age, same age. and number one good kid, number one great kid, number one, the, the best player in the world. Nicole Yoki. Yep. I like your list. This is a solid top 10. At the end of the day, he's won. Yeah. And that's the difference between him and Luca. Yeah. World champion. Yeah. And You can argue Asia should be two because she has a title. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe I'm Wrong. Do you wanna make that change? Sure. Okay. Asia's number two. Okay. Alright. I like that. Like that's, I can't find any holes, any gaps at all in that top 10. Yeah. I wanna be realistic at the end of the day. Yeah. You have to be honest because there Isn't gonna be another two or three girls on this list. Yeah. You know, Kaitlyn Clark fans can shut the hell up.


Oh. With that being said, 19 assists. That was incredible. Incredible. Incredible. I haven't seen since something like that since Kirk Heinrich and NBA 2K oh six. Oh. But yeah, that was, that's my list. I, I Give, I, I would rank your list very highly. That's one of the top 10, top 10 lists I've heard this year. Yeah. Hopefully it's the best. Okay. Alright. Anything else before we, we talk some other stuff. Hank do you have any comment on that? No, I think the only one that I would take umbridge with would be SGA. Yeah. You, Your umbrage taker. Who, who Do you think should be on it? Well, I think there's a guy who's the same age. Jason Tatum more is not in The top 10 more NBA first Jalen Brown is not in the top 10 More.


Yeah. Well I heard your list. I know that. I'm just said if I were to take umbrage, you'd be with that. Yeah. More points per game. More rebounds per game. Mm. Way more playoff wins. No, Anthony Edwards Either, But that's fine. Yeah. Alright, so, and then you, you also said that you were working on Mount Rushmore ideas. Why don't you give us two? Okay. And then we'll, we'll, we'll keep moving you by the way, Matthew said he, he was working on Mount Rushmore ideas. He came up with some, he found some, he found some and split 'em. I don't know what that means. Okay. But he's, but he found some and he split 'em. So one, I got families to live with the Mount Rushmore families to live like you could do sitcom families, like Yeah.


Oh, the Griffins, but or not bad. The Hutchinson family. Yeah. And you just won't wake up next to good looking people. Oh. You know, so families to live with or beef bump. I don't hate that One. Yeah. That felt like that. Okay. So that you, Hutchinson was right there with It's a good Family. Yeah. Okay. Yep. It's a very good family. Yeah. Yeah. No, very good family. This is a good one. Missed shots. Oh, Rushmore missed shots. It could be, yeah. That's kinda wide open. Yeah. A lot of missed shots lately, I'd say. Oh Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Miss Jots being up there, you know, I also got fat guy sayings. Oh, okay. I like that. I mean, every draft is stacked for maximum big. I'll have another.


Yeah. Are you gonna eat that? Yeah. You know, I could eat. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not full lunch for dinner tonight. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I like that. Can we have SI Hate pizza. I hate ice cream.

Jerry walked in and was like, oh, we got the big guys in here. Max was, what is that supposed to mean? Damn Max. but it wasn't guys is okay. Yeah. I was calling you my big boy on Tuesday night. Yeah. That was good. Yeah. So that's my big boy. I, The jersey Was too small. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Matthew, we're excited to have you. Yeah, thank you. You'll be helping out as much as you can internship for the rest of the summer.

Oh yeah, he started Breaking it Down. Breaking it down. He has a notebook, So I took notes on every game. Okay. Just general light, like philosophy stuff. Yeah. So it's actually just really impressive what you've managed to do. Oh. Feels like, Because somehow you performed worse on the second night. What? Even though you had more wins Huh? Which is actually impressive. No, this is, this is good. This is good. Went ugly. You threw, I, I wanna make this very clear. Eight pick sixes last night I played more games.


You threw 16 interceptions? Yeah, I played more games. Games. I played five games the first night I played what, like eight games the second night. You still threw 11 interceptions on the first night. Yeah. Three Of them picked sixes. Yeah. Four touchdowns. Yeah. And I think it, these are all passing numbers, but I think there was only three touchdowns. And I'll give you an extra one. 'cause I felt bad. Okay. It was, I mean, it was just honestly awful. Yeah. But I won The, the, the C game. The first game you threw five interceptions. Yeah. I mean that's, that's a horrible way to start a season. Yeah. That was the first game of that I played in the game. Yeah. These are long quarters, right? Yeah. These are, these are, yeah. That's 10, 15 Minute quarters.


He should be running the ball more. Okay. I mean, that was the one thing I kept noticing is positive yards happen more times than not when the ball goes in the ball carrier's hand. Yep. But then you throw the ball and shit doesn't go well. Yeah. No, You're right. And, and, and you were, the craziest part is on the second night you were staying in the pocket more, but yet you were more inconsistent with your throat. Okay. So somehow you, you learned from your mistakes, but you didn't, I'm just so we're clear. I'm the offensive coordinator. I'm not playing the game. Right. Well, like the, the players played the game. Right. The play call hasn't been great either. Okay. Okay. Okay. You know, we're gonna get into it. Okay. But I did win, I turned the season around, won a bowl game, which you have yet to congratulate me on.


Congratulations. Thank you. On The best season Wazoo is gonna have under you, coach Doug's. Oh, wow. I mean, the roster coming in next season. Are you Poopy stinks is I'm, I'm realistic. Okay. And I, I I'm wanting to root for you. Okay. But when but when you're missing reeds. Yeah. I mean, I mean, you could have beat Oregon. Yeah. Game one or that's, what is it second, third week you Yeah. Yeah. That you're talking about the first night though. Yeah. First night that was bad. It was just, it was, it, it added to the, the badness on night two. Okay. If, you won that game. We, you know, sky's the limit. Yeah. You coulda got a three star recruit. Yeah. Okay. I'll take that criticism. It's rough. Yeah. All right. That's fair. Listen, I'm a big boy.


I'll be in the booth next season and I'm excited. Okay. I, I'm rooting, I I would love to see your notes after a game. I'd love to get you, you know, the feedback helps. Yeah. No, I think, you know, you need to listen to your thoughts more. I feel like you're, you know, you're, you're just doing things. Yeah. No, that's True. And you just, you just gotta calm down, breathe and take it one day at a time. Yeah. Don't play at A time. Yeah. That's facts. That's facts. Okay. So Matthew, I like that. I like that Come coming at Doug's. I like that. So you, you're gonna be there. You'll, you'll watch the games, the streams. You're gonna be with us for the rest of the summer. We'll see how it goes. We're excited to have you. And what else? Anything else for Matthew? No, I'm excited. I'm excited.


I, I think we're gonna have him be the world's first college football. Bracketologist. Yeah. Preseason. Yeah. So maybe next week. Yeah, next week. Next Week. Do your bracketology for the top 10. Yeah. Okay. Or top 12. And and between now and the end of the show, think of a fire fest. Okay. All right. All right. You got this. I like Matthew. That's Matthew our intern Mr. Hole. Yes. There's gotta be some people who applied and they're like, the guy fucking deleted 200 podcasts and that's how he got the job. I mean, that's, I like that. We've got a guy who's whose only job is to press the button to publish the show. Yeah. And now we have a guy whose only job is to press the button to delete the show forever. Yeah. Yeah. There are also the video with all of the interns that applied will be coming out shortly.


Yeah. And you'll see Matthew did sweep us away. He was, he was quite something. Yep. He had his suit on and he was, he looked, I, I think I called him John Candy. New age John Candy. Yeah. Like From you're watch Trains and Automobile. Yeah. If you're watching right now, he's got a John Candy look. That makes him very lovable. So we're big Matthew guys. Okay. Sports World. Kale Williams officially signed as a bear. Was there a doubt that he was gonna sign? Good Question. Oh, that's funny. PFT that you asked that If, you listen to the lame stream media. There was a doubt. The florio's, the cowards, the RG threes of the world. Wait, are you talking about pre-draft? I'm talking about the entire process of there was pre-draft.


There was, there was in between draft and signing that people were like, oh, he's, he's trying to get the Bears to agree to no franchise tag. He's trying to get the bears to agree to no fifth year right now. He Wanted equity. All these rumors were such bullshit because Kale Williams doesn't have an agent. So you have agents basically saying, Hey, KLE Williams If, you had an agent. All this stuff wouldn't be happening. You should have hired me. But Mike Florio, Colin Coward, RG three, the countless anonymous trolls. All who said that there was 0% chance that Kle Williams was going to sign with the Bears. That he was gonna force a trade. That he was gonna demand ownership.


Florio said he was gonna play another season at USC. You all look like morons Kle Williams' officially signed as a bear. We now have a window. And I would like an apology. I would hope Florio would be a big enough man to apologize. I don't expect it. Coward the same. Remember Coward said his father said he has no chance, chance he's gonna go to Chicago. All these people spent all this time and, and no one's taking him to task. So you've been taking a task and he's officially a bear. And I'm excited. I think that there was a lot of talk going like through the season about certain teams he didn't want to go to. And then for like a month leading up to the draft, then that ES ESPN article came out that was like, Caleb is down to play. 'cause it was always Bullshit.


And then there was no, I I haven't heard any other doubters after the draft post draft. There were people who were saying he was trying to get the fifth year taken away and they get the franchise ta tag taken away. Like there are people and they'll move the goalposts. I had people yesterday telling me that Kale blooms won't sign a second contract. Mm. That's a, let's have that discussion right Now. It's just crazy. I don't listen to the flurries of the world. I listen to the boogers of the world On RG three. Booger, McFarland, Booger McFarland. He said today on Get Up. Don't be surprised when Jayden Daniels is the guy that they're talking about next year as being like a CJ Stroud. And Caleb Williams is the one being talked about. Like, he's a Bryce Young. So I'm, I I go with booger.


Booger played in the league. Okay. That's my guy. Okay. He knows Ball. Windows open. Windows open. Alright, What else you guys wanna talk about? That was a dud. Sorry. No, I I honestly just, of course I didn't hear. Sorry bro. Hit a three. He did. Finally, Ronnie Hit two threes. He had a good game. 12 points. And there's talk that they, they might shut him down after he had one good game. Just leave him in a, with a good taste in his mouth from Summer League. So I don't know if that's gonna happen, but that was the big story. A lot of other people are pointing out that Alexander Sarr went, oh, for 15 from the field. Oof. Oh, for seven from three points against lasers. You know what, you learn more from a miss than you do from a make. Yeah. So I feel like Alexander Sarr has nothing but room for Growth.


Wait, So bro, he hit one three. Oh, I thought he hit two. I thought, oh, he hit Two. I thought he hit, I thought he went two for five and one of 'em Was clutch. He's on fire. What do you mean it was clutch? It was like the quarter. The agency? No. Oh. I think they're all clutch. Yeah. Yeah. He is all clutch. We also had the, the list, the top 100 athletes, we called it correctly. Serena Williams was number One. Was she? Yep. Fucking nailed that one. We forgot about phe. Michael Phelps. Oh no, it was Michael Phelps. Sorry. Michael Phelps. Number one. We forgot about Phelps. Serena was number two. Okay. And then number three, I'm gonna, It was messy. Okay. Messy. That makes, which I, I like that. That makes sense. And then after that, Tom Brady, It was two Serena, three messy four.


LeBron, five. Tom Brady. Six Federer. Seven Simone Biles. Okay. We didn't have that on our radar. Eight Tiger Woods. Nine Hussain Bolt 10. Kobe Bryant. Interesting. Yeah. And then Novak. And then Nadal and Ronaldo. Oh. So interesting. Mess. He's way higher than way higher Though. Way higher. Where's Djokovich? Djokovich was 10. Did they have any horses on the list? I don't think they had any horses on the List. Null and void. I do not think they had any horses on the list. Steph was 14. Katie Ledecky 15. Yeah. They did, they did a good job of switching it up on us. 'cause we thought it was gonna be Serena. And then they went with the Phelps.


Yeah. Forgot about Phelps. We also had Sam Pittman, Arkansas coach. He went in front of the media today and he, he gave the best quote of the off season, besides Mike Gundy saying that he's driven drunk thousands of times. Sam Pitman said, our focus this year is to embrace the hog Ooh. At Arkansas. Okay. Which I love. That's a, that's a great slogan that you can put out there. Okay. It's easy to chant. That's what Bill Clinton's motto was for the state when he was governor there. And I feel like Arkansas might be back. I think they're also back because they get to renew the rivalry against Texas. Yeah. Which is bigger than a lot of people think. Like Arkansas and Texas hate each other. Yeah. And so we didn't get to see too much of that in the last couple years, but I don't know. I just, I liked, I like Sam Pittman.


I'm wishing the best for the hogs. Embrace the hog. Yeah. It's, and he's also got those big old breasts. Big breasts. Yeah. And the jowls. Yeah. I, yeah. We're Sam Pitman guys. I would like Arkansas to be good. Oh, also Russell Westbrook. He's in the news today. Yeah. What happened with him? So he was traded to the Utah Jazz again, and they're gonna buy out his contract again. He Just gets, this is the be he's got the best career ever. So this Is two years in a row where he will be on the Utah Jazz. I don't think they ever even thought about making a jersey for him. They should really do a, a retirement video For him. Yeah. A welcome back. Yeah. They should do. Yeah. A welcome home video for He went to the nuggets today. Yeah. So he went, he went to the jazz, they bought the contract out. Oh, I don't like 'em. And then he goes to the Nuggets. I don't like that fit on the nuggets either.


Yeah. I don't like that on the Nuggets. Huh. Okay. And then we had the open championship. Victor Hovland sucks. Yeah. Tough course. That was a bad decision by us with the whole death thing. And we're like, oh, maybe this will be, and then he was eating ice cream. That sucked. Yeah. This is a tough course. We saw a couple people, I think Awa did it where he hit a bunker shot, And. it just went around the bunker and came back in the bunker. I saw that a couple times. Those Are fun. Bryson's Basically out Ludwig's. Basically out. Yeah. Tiger's definitely Out. He had that one birdie though, which was sick. Yeah. And then Brooks had like a four hole span where it looked like Brooks is, alives is, yeah. Brooks is alive. Brooks is dialed right now.


And Bryson also had a moment where he corrected a reporter's English and, but Bryson was wrong. I dunno. If, You guys saw it? No, I didn't see that. He, He said incalculable. Yeah. The reporter, I believe, hold on, lemme get the clip. I think the reporter said Incalculable and he said it's actually incalculable or Whatever. Incalculable. Yeah. Hold on. Ready? When there's so many measurements going on in your Mind. There's not that many. There's a couple, it seems like. Yeah, there's a couple, but not that many, Many things that are maybe incalculable. If that's incalculable. There you go. Any, gotta give a look to it. Uncalculable might be a word I don't know, but yeah, incalculable is the word.


Incalculable. I, I love the idea of though, of Bryon just correcting people and being wrong though. That's good. I thought I like that. Good for, yeah. Yeah. Did you see the, the plants, the Bos, is that what it's called? Yeah. That's what Shane big That, that Shane was telling us about. Yeah. Have you seen the pictures of it? Yeah. It's fucking gnarly. Yeah, it is crazy. It doesn't, I know that like link's golf is supposed to be the best golf and everyone wants to go to, you know, the UK to play it. but it just never seems fun. No. When I watch it, I'm like, what? This, the wind is always blowing. It's overcast. There's huge bunkers. It just doesn't seem fun. Yeah. And the courses look like they were just like bombed out in World War ii. Yeah. And they never repaired 'em. Yeah. It it looks like the worst event to go to as a fan, as a spectator.


Yeah. Just sitting out in the rain, in the wind the whole time. Yeah. But you guys love the course. I do, but I'm just saying it for like, the Course is, the course is fighting. Correct. No, These are good things for the course. Yeah. Yeah. The, I'm talking about like the experience of being out there in person. I the course, like when I watched the Masters, I'm like, man, I wish to go play Augusta. That looks incredible. When I watched the, the British Open, I'm like, I don't know if I'd wanna play that. And I obviously I'm not a big golfer, so I get it. It's incredible for golfers, but like, it looks miserable in the fact that if I ever got in that bunker, I'd never get out ever in a million years. It's cheap over there. Golf is, golf is cheap over there. Which seems appealing. Well, I mean, but you have to fly over there. Yeah. But If, you right.


That's true. How cheap is it? Like 50 bucks, a hundred bucks. But the flight, I'm saying though, like that In the hotel, Hank's thinking about moving. No, no, I'm not saying, I just think that's a, a nice thing. Like they golf is, is for the people. So people's, for the people strip you. Should we take a trip? I'd be down Crew week. Yeah. We're throwing that out there. Yeah. Do you think you can golf right now? I can't. No. Oh No. We gotta You can't eat ice Cream off fire fest. Yeah, it's bad. Oh no. Hank Sacrifice. You do sacrifice for us constantly. The team needed me and I, I didn't want to back out. Yeah.


What I, I agree with you. You did. You you were awesome on home run derbies. You didn't wanna back out. No, I, I didn't. I wanted to, but I knew I couldn't. Hank was very good Standup guy. Yeah. No, he was fucking awesome. Had a great swing. Okay. Anything else. Brandon Iuk demanded a trade Again. No, he formerly, he like requested it with the team Instead of passive aggressively team Instead of passive, instead of just posting practice film Videos where he Like watching commanders. Yeah. I Wish I could play with this guy. Yeah, but he, he apparently requested it with the team. But the Niners have a history of not honoring trade requests because you don't really have To. Yeah, no, you don't have to do anything. you Don't have to do anything. And Brandon Iuk is really good In the NFL.


That's what the contracts basically say. It's like your, your only leverage that you have is to just be annoying. So he wants to trade. Wait, is something going on with Devonta Adams too? Memes. A lot of people shot it down, but, oh, there's speculation. So, but you're thinking maybe. I'm thinking if the Raiders start off bad, then trade room is gonna ramp all the way up. Nice. Nice. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. On the, on the new Netflix show, the receiver, he was just pissed at Jimmy G and not hitting The ball. I saw that. He is like, he's gonna get me killed. Yeah. So never wanna see that. We Should watch that show. I heard it's good. Yeah. Never want to get me killed.


Is not what you want your wide receiver saying. They gotta make a show. Just the fullback, like how we had the quarterback won then wide receivers won. Gimme a fullback show. Just a 10 minute episode. All fullbacks. Yeah. 10 minute episode. But just like dudes lighten people up. Sideline shots. Sideline shots. Sideline shot. Yeah. Full line package. Sideline shot. Then like the bye week And they're on like their family farm using a tractor. Yeah, that's what I want. Show me Fullbacks. Joe's Fullbacks. All right. Should we do our Mount Rushmore?

Jalapeno and a pizza is pretty good too. Yeah. I hadn't had it till I've been out here, but Sausage, like Chardonier is really good.


Yeah. I've never had jars really? Pizza Regional. But it's good. It's really Good. If I get like a tavern style pizza with soft sauce, get one of Jarre. Probably, probably the fattest thing you can do. But I fucking love it. It's the pizza place in Madison, Ian's, which actually they have one demos is the name of it. It's in Chicago as well. Macaroni. Yep. We, I had that in College. Macaroni Pie. They they have that at, what's the name of the pizza Buffet place? Pizza. ccs. Caesar. cc's. cc's. Pizza Buffet. Nice. There you go, Matthew. Nice. Nice job Hole tomatoes on the pie. Sometimes pretty good. Yes. Yes. It, it can be overkill. Yeah. Yeah. Tomatoes like a mar mar salami. Margarita. Yeah. Margarita Pizzas. Yeah. Margarita pizza is good. Salami Trust tree.


I Used to work at a place that had, like, it was, it wasn't great pizza, but it was an Italian place with like the oven style thin. And they had a really good like salami and like hot honey pizza. Yeah. Mm. Or the trust. But I, I, I haven't ordered it. Like, it's not something I would order. I want pizza real bad Right now. Till you got something. Being totally honest. Yeah. I don't mind anchovies. I don't like 'em. I don't mind it at all. I, I almost never get a pizza with anchovies on it. But when there's like a little bit of anchovies, there's a treat. They just taste like salty. They don't, you just Need, you need, They don't taste fishy at all. It's Just so hard to do that because you just can't, you need like, buy in from like three people. Yeah. If I'm like by myself once every couple years just as a treat, get half of it with anchovies on.


Yeah. I had a chicken Caesar slice and my college pizza place. That was good. It was just, it was just like chicken Caesar salad on a pizza. but it was nice. One Of the biggest pet peeves I have is when you order pizza for a large group and someone's like, get a, get a cheese or, or whatever. Cheese. Or like, maybe get like a mushroom or something. And they only have one slice of that. And they eat all the other ones. I'll make people, if they ask for something, like if they ask for an anchovies, I'd be like, you have to eat four slices. You better put in work on It. Pizza. Like, you have to, you can't, you can't have one anchovy and then go to the pepperoni that we're all eating. You Guys ever eat a full pie by yourself? Colony Grill? Yeah. I don't know if that's full pie. Like it is the full pizza, but it's thinner, but yeah.


Yeah. I've Had it. What is your favorite, like If you're going and you can get any toppings you want. Like what is your customizable pizza order like right now? Bacon, pineapple. I, I am doing pepperoni jar air. And then I've got hot honey at home that I put on it. I go one pepperoni pie, one barbecue chicken with like sauteed onions pie. One cheese pie is all for me. That's it. I go pepperoni and then a barbecue chicken with sauteed onions. I do s sausage, onions and mushrooms. That's my, that's good. That's my favorite pie. Good Order. Solid order. That's a good one.


I love mushrooms on pizza, but I, I know people aren't gonna, and there's some people that just hate mushrooms. No, I I think mushrooms belong on pizza. Yeah, they do. It's all about the saute too. Like it's not, they're not, they're not eating like, you know, dry mushrooms, right? Yeah. When I was in college, I was a pizza delivery guy for I think a full year, full calendar year. I worked at a place called Anthony's Italian Touch, which is a very creepy name for a pizza. That is weird. And what made it weirder was the guy that ran the place was not Anthony. His name was Nick. But he just called it Anthony's Italian touch. 'cause it sounded more Italian. But I had this one customer that would order extra mushrooms, like double mushrooms. That was all that he would get. And that shit would stink up. Double. Double mushrooms. Double mushrooms. Like extra extra mushrooms.


Double mushrooms. My car would smell so bad. What do you guys think about little pesto? Pesto on the pizza? That's nice. Yeah. It's bad. A little change of pace. Not bad. That's another one where like, I, I won't order it if I'm not eating. Like, you have to eat all the, you have to eat a lot of slices though. Yeah. You can't be like, I want the pesto pizza. Me Memes keep saying vodka pizza. But I don't think that's a topping. I feel like that's just a, it's A sauce. Yeah. Yeah. Sauce. I thought about doing stuff crust, but I don't think that's a topping. Right. No, it's, it's a style of pizza. No. Yeah. That's style. Matthew, we miss any a breed? No, I think you covered It. Okay. I mean, Unless you wanna start talking like barbecue sauce and ranch and, Well, we Yeah. Barbecue chicken. Well, yeah, But like The sauce, specific sauce. Just the sauces.


Yeah. I do like a little, yeah, like If. you can't get a little barbecue sauce. Little frank's red hot. Frank's red hot's pretty good. Thinks red Hot goes on everything. If it's Like shitty pizza, I like, like a ranch or like a hot sauce. But if it's good pizza, I just like want like the pizza by Itself. By the way, Hank still thinks we're fucking with him. He's just not Participating. I think, I think what happened is this took Hank back to a dark place. Yeah. No. There's PTSD. It's Like trauma involved and he hurt us. Yeah. The Death of this segment. There's not, we've had so many good moments. We had Max saying that titty fucking, there's been some incredible moments. Mr. Positions. Yeah. Yeah. Billy and Jake doing ai Taco Bell orders.


There's been some great Mount Rushmore moments. I don't know the integrity of the game was lost. Look at that Check. We haven't broken the integrity since we broke it one time. And you still have trust issues. Why wouldn't I? Of course I Do because we've, we've done three seasons straight up since then. I've Watched that video so many times by the way of, of us doing the original Mount Rushmore pizza draft. And then Hank being totally surprised whenever he got like his next pick off The board. Yeah. He was so mad at us. Yeah. So, so mad. We're back. This was a good draft. Come on, Hank. Yeah. Good times. It's a Good draft.


Hank you, you won an NBA championship like three weeks ago. Your favorite athlete of all time. Suck your dick at his retirement ceremony. That's gotta you, you can't get down in the dumps because of a segment. I'm not down in the dumps. He's just, he's got, he's got his guard up. Yeah, he's got his guard out it as I should. But you are down in the dumps. But we did, we we just pulled this off. Now we can put it to bed. Now we can lay it to rest. Pizza toppings are done. What? I feel like that's what you're setting me up. You're trying to set me up. I know, I know you are. This whole time you've been like Nch all trying to get me to get my guard down. And then you come back over the top. We, I'm surprised because I'm getting smoked in the standing. So Yeah. What are the standings? It's not that bad. Yeah. There's remember last year you guys didn't you guys make a comeback?


Yeah. At the end. Yeah. Hey, Billy. Jake did. Oh, it was Billy Jake. It'd Be a real shame if people voted for this Mount Rushmore based on attitude during the Mount Rushmore stop. No, we, we, we had a good lead and then I went on vacation. Oh yeah, That's right. So you just suck at Mount Rushmore, Hank, that's all it is. Yeah. I feel like you always have like two good picks. I tried to blame the team. I had the team angle for a while. Yeah, That's kind. There's nobody left to to blame now though. That's Not Yeah, it's all right. It's a long season. It is a long season. Yeah. We got a lot of Mount Rushmore left. Okay, let's get to our interviews. We got two great interviews.


We have Mike Vrabel. Wait, did you lose last year, max? Yeah. You lost, you had to go over. Yeah, we did the 24 hour stream. Oh, Yeah. Yeah. It was bad. We have Mike Vrabel and then we have an awesome interview with comedian Gary Veder, who has a crazy, crazy story about his life with his dad growing up, who's a scam artist. Insane stories.

Okay, here he is. Mike Vrabel. Okay, we now welcome on a very, very, very, very special guest. One More, very, Very, very, very one of our dear friends. It is a Chill Week interview presented by Coors Light and Chevy Silverado. One of our dear friends recently retired NFL Head Coach. Mike. Vrabel. You Can't fire me. I quit. Yeah. Well, I, I was gonna say the recently retired, but then I realized you have a job. You're Have a great job. I asked Kevin Stefanski, the coach of the Cleveland Browns, what is RAs doing for you? And he said he's scout team. Middle linebacker.


So that's what you're doing for the Browns partly. Yeah. Any, anything they need help with and anything I can do to, to learn. It's, it's been awesome. You were actually putting on the pads, right? You were, you were doing like kickoff return. Yeah, just helping, you know what I mean? Bubba Vent intro. The special teams coordinator. I, bubba was a rookie when I was with the Patriots. And so we would take Bubba and his girlfriend, his wife at the time now, now his girlfriend, Katie. You know, we'd take the rookies of dinner or whatever. And so Bubba now is a special teams coordinator. So it was an easy transition to help on special teams. I've, I've played a lot of those positions. I've coached him and help Kevin and Andrew and, and the Browns and, and the Hasham family. However, I can wait.


You just said whatever I could do to learn. Yeah, I mean that's a, that's actually a pretty crazy, it's cool. And also crazy thing to say, you, you were, you're a very good NFL head coach that is in a transition period where you're gonna be an NFL head coach again and you're like, I'm back to learning. Well, I think like Anything else, you guys look at podcast, there's a million podcasts. Well, there's a lot of ways to coach football. There's 31 other teams, head coaches, there's coordinators, there's guys that have been other places, Andrew Barry, his personnel staff, how they go through draft prep, how they, you know, integrate analytics and how they communicate with the coaches and all that stuff that I'm trying to learn and be a part of.


And, you know, it kind of worked out for, for them and for me especially. And so that's what I've tried to do. That's Super mature way to look at it. I, when you relate it to podcasting, it's like, we should send Hank off to another podcast to learn. Yeah. We should learn. We should send him to politicking. When we were Ohio State Urban Meyer was like, I, whatever Alabama's doing, we're, we're, if they have 50 people in recruiting, we need 51. Right. And if they have this, then we need to have one more. Like that's how he looked at it. And so you're always trying to figure out what everybody else is doing that's successful and, and, and try to figure something out. So yeah. You're, you're a consultant for the Browns, right? Is that your official title that Yes. That's An awesome title. Coaching and personnel consultant. It seems like you do like whatever is needed.


Or are you, are you coming up with like, your own initiative? Do you have to be like a self-starter? I think there's a lot of leeway there. I think the, the first, the first thing I wanna do is, is help Kevin wherever I can. I've got a lot of respect for him. I think he's done an unbelievable, he's the best job. Best Yeah. Is help and support him wherever, if he has questions or he wants to bounce something off of me. And then I thought it was a great idea. He's like, we have a pretty new offensive staff, you know, a lot of guys that have, you know, transitioned on to other places. And now we've hired some really good coaches that are, that are new to Cleveland. Why don't you hang out on the offensive side and give a defensive perspective. Tommy Reese, former quarterback of Notre Dame, Alabama coordinator, and he's coaching tight end.


So he's like, why don't you work with Tommy? Yep. And the tight ends. And so yeah, I played a little tight end my day. You know, it's not a Yep. Oh, maybe Biles Garrett at tight end this year. Well, Shh. Yeah. Can't give it away. I mean, you can't stop that still. It's July, You can't stop. It Did. So anyways, I, that's been really cool to have that perspective on offense, which, you know, having, you know, six years as a head coach in Tennessee, there's plenty of offense that I was doing and understood and communicated with. So that's what I've been doing. So Do you think Stefan's gonna have you address the team in the Mike Vrabel situational spot this year? During the season? Potentially.


I mean, we've discussed it. I put, you know, I put tapes together for, for Kevin and things that they've done, things that we've done, things that people around the league have done, showed it to him. He's got a great group there. And so we sat, you know, a few mornings and went through the tape. And what, what you try to do situationally, is you try to take all these clips and you try to, you know, consolidate it down so that you can show the team, you can show the quarterback so that everybody sees it through the same set of eyes. They're not gonna be able to watch 3000 clips in the last 45 seconds of the first half and the last 45 seconds of the game. So you're like, okay, that's a good one. And then you come up with this cutup and then you just, you know, show it to the coach and then he decides how we wanna do things.


Do You know what I'm talking about though, in terms of the actual situational spot? I, I knew, I knew where you were going with this. Yeah, There's a lot. You don't, you just tell me what situation you still don't Yeah, it's the, the Tennessee Titans are playing a Sunday night or Monday night game, and they're like seven to 10 point underdogs and everyone thinks they're gonna get absolutely killed. And then Mike Vrabel comes in and he wins the game. We did that quite a few times. Yeah, that's, that is the, that seemed like every game we won pretty much seemed like that anytime The, anytime the Titans were like consensus written off as they got no chance in this game, you guys would win out decent Money line. Yeah. Very good. That's right. So like that's the, that's, I don't know, I don't know how you did it. I, it, it really was more than just a couple times where it came, it became something that I almost expected where it's like if their, if their backs are against the wall and people think that they got no chance, Brave's gonna figure out a way to get this team to play and play their best football Here.


Here's what I say. You guys have a team, you guys have a operation, you're very good at what you do early on, maybe a few years ago, you're like, we're gonna make this switch And, it's gonna work and, and our, and our, and our shit's gonna take off and we're gonna, we're gonna nail this. We're gonna figure it out. Whatever that was, whether that was with Dave or you guys. And so early on, I forget what it was, 2018, we set. So it was like, I think it was the second game we were playing Houston and they were rolling, they were good. Deshaun was down there. We, we had nobody, we had, everybody got hurt in Miami. We had like our practice squad tackles. Marcus got hurt.


And. it was like, how are we gonna win? Well, we faked a punt. We threw a punt to Byard for a touchdown. I was like, we're gonna stand in the huddle for 38 seconds. We're gonna run the line, snap it, we're gonna go Wildcat with Derrick. I mean, we did all And it. So I was like four the night before the game. I was like 40, 17 and two. I was like, we gotta run the ball 40 times. We need to hold 'em to 17 points or less and we need to get two turnovers. And we won 20 to 17. Yeah. And, it was like, That was, they Set the, so when you explain these things, then you're like, this is how we're gonna win. It may not be the same every week, it may not always work, but this was the plan. And I think If, you can do those things and then the people around you see it work.


They're like, okay, well we'll give it another try. I'll see how it goes. So You had a specific like plan like that when you would go into a game where maybe your team didn't match up a hundred percent. Like talent for talent, you know, If, you play this game a hundred times, you're not gonna win 50% of them. But you had that plan of, hey, if we can muck it up and do these three things, Reserve the right to punt. We played the 49 ERs and you know, we, we came out, I said, reserve the right to punt. It was back and forth. We took care of the ball. We had a huge turnover in the red zone. And, and then Jimmy came out, I think it was the first play of the second half. And we had gone from playing all zone. We switched it up, we played, man, he kind of chunked the ball.


Amani Hooker intercepted it. And and we ended up beating him and they were, you know, they were really Good. That was a Thursday night game. Yeah, yeah. Right around Christmas. Yeah, I remember that. That was one of the ones. Yeah. Whereas like the in the Ram Sunday night game. Remember that one? That one Was there. Do many, was There a Dolphins one too? The Dolphins one was last year. Yeah. Yeah. There's so many where it's like, you just go in and everyone's like, Titan's got no Chance. But you know, that and, and whatever team hires Mike Vrabel next, his head coach is getting like an entire season's worth of Mike Vrabel being counted out. Yeah. I think the 49 ERs were wearing all whites in that game. Yeah. And I actually gave you a chance after I saw those, those didn't make any sense. Yeah. I mean, I don't know necessarily being counted out, but I just think that there's a, there's a mentality that, you know, I mean these guys were here for a reason.


Everybody, I think each week you just try to explain everybody that you have to prepare as a starter. And I think it kept guys engaged. I think when they saw that, you know, we played different guys in different places and whatever we try to do, you just try to keep 'em engaged and, you know, hopefully I get an opportunity again and, and would love to try to do it. I think it's gonna work out for you for sure. I mean, this off season, I felt like you were one of the top coaching prospects out there. It's like, I, I was going through my own personal coaching search at the time and I was like, yeah, Mike Vrabel would love to have Mike Vrabel in DC It's, a lot of it is about fit. You know, I think these interviews get overblown. I think that they, they go through a process. I think that Or you were too. You were too big and intimidated.


Yeah. You are too Physically big. It's a big man's game. You scared away a lot of owners because They're afraid. It's afraid of you. It's a man's game, boys. And I mean, they just keep getting bigger and bigger. And so, you know, I, I didn't really necessarily, I tried to do my job the best that I could for that organization. I was shocked. But these interviews are interesting, right? You, you try to make a connection early on. Right. We have a connection. I've known you guys, you know, thought I had great interview in, in LA you know, for the Chargers. And you know, Harbaugh decided to, to come to back to the NFL and that's what, you know, Mr.


Spanos and, and John Spanos communicated with me. And I, that's, I respect them for that. They, they literally called me on a, you know, string you along. Yeah. No, they called me And. it that rarely happens to where, you know, if an owner's gonna interview you and then go in a different direction that they'll personally call you. And they were like, you know, second place isn't gonna give you much, but wanted to tell you that, you know, we just had an opportunity to, to hire, you know, John Harbaugh. So that's how it goes. Or Jim Harbaugh. Yeah. I was, I was actually surprised. I do that every time by the, it is, I do Jim and John fucking impossible every single Time. Just say HARs har HARs. We Know them so well and I just always do That. Yeah. I I was, I was actually shocked that you were fired this year because it felt like you were a good thing, a stable thing that the Titans had going.


Your team's always played hard. And I remember it was during the season, I will say that was, I was always proud of that. Yeah. I appreciated that as a young coach. There was a veteran coach at Ohio State. He came in, Dave Adolph, and he, he was a defensive coordinator with the Raiders and he was, he was a defensive coordinator for Al Davis and that's not an easy thing. And he, and he was helping out Ohio State when I just started there. And he came in and he, Tressel had brought him in to kind of just, you know, watch, consult, hang out and, but good football coach and he's since passed away. But he said, man, your guys would play hard. Yeah. And I, and that didn't realize how good that felt when he said, your guys play hard. And so I always try to carry that through, you know, and I figured it was the contract that you made for the team with the team.


Yeah. You're, you, you individually, that's the contract that you make with the football team is that you're gonna play your ass off. But that I, I really do think the way If you can get your team to play hard in the NFLI think it actually is worth like, consistently week in and week out. I do think it's worth a win or two at the end of the season. Yeah. And then if you're worth a broke one, then you got a chance to win. You know what I mean? It's like it If you play hard, you're gonna be in the game. Right. There are teams that you can see like, oh, they're just not, they don't bring it to the other team at week in and week out. But when you, when Vrabel coaches the team that happens. Well let's hope so. Yeah. We should hire him right now. Yeah. You want to, you want to coach our podcast? We don't have a head coach Consultant. I mean, if I can't beat out one of these guys, I problem. Yeah, you Can definitely.


Yeah. Yeah. Name your title. Forgot To hit record on the, on the camera yesterday. The coffee. Yeah. Did we get the coffee? Yeah. Well Hank you know, he is slow. Yeah. So, so, alright. So would you ever coach college? I don't, I'm not gonna say never, but it's certainly turned into a different game. You know, I talked to, you know, coach Fickle. Yep. You gotta be a huge fan. Have are you gonna go up there and have him on or no? Yeah, We've had him on. Oh good. But I saw him when I was up there in the spring and I'm gonna go up for you This year. Are you, are you contributing to the NIL I'm? I've been telling 'em. Tell answer, put him on the spot. I'll tell you the answer. I've told them, find me a really good player and I will do a Stella Blue Coffee NIL deal.


That's bigger than like just Luke, I hope you're hearing this. I'm gonna, let's call, we'll call Luke right Now. I told, I told the basketball team, I told the football team. But figure out like you bring the player to me and be like, Hey, we're this close to this guy. Can you help? And I'm, I'm in and and Bring in the closer. Yeah. I'm not gonna just write like tented grand. You don't tr you don't trust. I'm Just not gonna write A 10 grand, 10 grand, 10 grand And just be like, I see where it goes. Hold 10 grand is not gonna get you a player. Exactly. I wanna actually, you're not gonna get a player for 10 grand. I wanna actually have like an impact where like If you just give money to like a collective. It's like where's this gonna go? Knows It's gonna go to the players. It's that. But anyways, I want, I want though, I don't know, like Luke and I have had conversations about this, about, you know, how do you wanna structure that money that you have that you're allocated for each team.


Right. Your salary cap, is it, you know, gonna be this group of incoming freshmen that I would consider rookies. Right. That you're not really sure on. And what's the hit rate? Are you gonna try to develop your own team and then resign your own guys? Or are you gonna live in the portal? Yeah. And that's free agency. And again, those are six month rentals. Guys are coming in and then they're out. Right. There's A lot about coaching college football that's not about coaching football at all. And I feel like it would be, you could have more success I think translating from the NFL to college than you would going the other way around. But also at the same time, if you're an NFL coach, I don't see like why that would appeal to you. You have to work so much more. Well there is a lot of, you know, you, you in the summer, you know what I mean?


You'll, you'll be sitting at, at baseball games or you'll be sitting at things and kids will call and say, Hey coach, I'm 30 minutes from campus. And you're like, I mean there was a guy from Georgia, I was at one of the kids' baseball games when I was coaching Ohio State and he was making the Notre Dame, the Michigan, Ohio State Loop like in the summer. And he, and he went to high school like an hour from, from Georgia. And I'm thinking there isn't a chance in hell this guy's coming Ohio State, but I've gotta come in there, open up the stadium, go bucks. And I'm thinking just go on down there and commit to Georgia. Yeah. And yeah, it's chasing. And any did. Yeah. Right. Of course he did. So do you think, do you think Coach Fickles, I mean I'm very bullish on the season. I think it's a tough schedule, but how do you think I, I think going into his first year at Wisconsin And again there was maybe some, I'm a football coach and a football player bull bear.


Like can we clean up that like you mean that you're excited about the the bull is A good bear is bad. I think bull is, Bull is strong. Bull bull. Bull bears are, have you seen the bears out here? And Tom? Yeah, I'm bullish means I'm very excited and I'm like by the Luke fickle stick. Good. It gets very complicated when he's talking about Chicago. 'cause he's always bullish on the bears. Bullish on the bears. Yeah. Yeah. Bearish on the bulls. I can see Where that That's true actually. Very true. That's true. Alright, so I am high on Luke Fickle. Good. I think the first year going to Wisconsin probably were, it was maybe a, a more of a mess that he had to clean up. You know, he, you know, He realized, you know, he had, he was my host at Ohio State. Yeah. He was there as a freshman and I came in in December and he was waiting for me when I got there at the hotel.


And, and the, and the rest was his history. How You guys best Friends. Were you guys best was How Well his Id worked for me when I was 19 years old. Who Would, who would win in a fight right now? Fight Al would beat his ass. I mean he only lost, this is not a sanction wrestling Event. Whoa, hold on. He only lost once as a high school wrestler. Right. I think he lost three his entire times as a freshman. He was an unbelievable wrestler. I Thought you lost once as entire Career. I think he lost three I because I went to a really, really good high school wrestling program. I was a basketball player. I was too athletic to wrestle. But I remem and we, we had, we had ended up winning a national championship. So all my buddies were wrestlers and they played football. And so Luke I think lost three as a freshman and then went undefeated.


Three straight years. Crazy. So he'd kick your ass. Yeah. No, no, no. Like in a sanctioned like wrestling match. Absolutely. Yeah. But If you If you guys fought right now. He would just, he would wrestle you to the ground. I do, I do not believe if it was a street fight that I would lose. Yeah. I think he would. I think he would have you. I What's the size? You he'd sle your ass. You're, You're way bigger than him right now, right? Well I'm intimidating. Yeah, you Are bigger than him. He's lost a little weight. But, alright. So back to the Luke fickle question. I think the first year at Wisconsin, maybe a little bit more of a situation he had to clean up than he realized. How do you think He's feeling going Into Year two? I think I, I am always high on Luke. I, I wanted, Luke recruited my oldest son Tyler for when he played in Houston and he recruited him at Cincinnati.


Jen and I, you know, obviously we don't have a say. My, my wife and I thought it would be a amazing 'cause what he was doing with that program. Right. And then Tyler's like, you know, dad, I've, I've known Uncle Luke since the day I was born. You put him In a tough spot. Yeah. And. it was like, yeah. When you look at it like that, you make the decision that's best for you. Now you gotta call him. And Tyler was like, fuck, I gotta, he's like, I gotta tell him I gotta call him and tell. I said Yeah, that's part of the deal. He goes I figured you were gonna say that. Yeah. He should've just gone to Cincinnati instead of having call instead Of having to call him. Yeah. Hank The coffee. I was like, Luke, you're pissed at me. 'cause Tyler's not com I was like, don't be pissed at me. Right, Right. Hank, you got, you got Ray's coffee. Where'd he go?


Hank's just off where he on out. Hank's off surfing the internet in the other room. So speaking of Hank, his favorite person in the world, Tom Brady, I, Don Dunno, If you saw, but he went to Tom's jersey retirement, right? Yeah. Tom called him out by name. Yep. Brady four. We also watched the roast of Tom Brady, which you were not at. I I was thinking that you were gonna be there. I mean all the good stuff. I mean, I was too much low hanging fruit on those jokes. I thought there was some Yeah, I've done much more. Yeah. I mean it does feel like you were, you maybe spent whatever it was the first five years of his career roasting him every single day. Yeah, no, we had those, those were great. Those were fun. The roast was funny. I I the funny parts, I mean, I didn't sit there for three hours, but, you know, there was some good stuff.


Yeah. Do you want to, what if Hank was Tom Brady? Would you roast Tom Brady? Like what would you have said at the roast? Oh, I, I, I, there's a lot of stuff left in there I think that we could have done. But I mean, it was a lot. Again, the, the, the, I I I struggle with, I I I like to age gracefully. I got the wrinkles, I got crow's feet. I got scars. Same it, it's just a polish and a shine on that, on that face of his right. Yeah. I think everybody in this room, we all age gracefully. Exactly. Natural. We just, we embrace it, you know? Yeah. He's kind of like an anime version. Air Tom Brady. It's like an airbrush. Yeah. Right, right. It's an Instagram filter of himself.


I was with a, like we had a family over the summer come and hang out with us a couple days and we, we went out on a boat and we had a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. The daughter wanted to get like pictures of her like jumping off the boat. And like, she's like, as she's in there, she's like, put it in portrait mode. And I'm like, what the, what is portrait mode? Yeah. I mean the game is, the game has changed. It's everybody's gotta gotta go on Instagram or, or TikTok, the speaking of Which, thanks Hank. Are you surprised that, no, not surprised Bill. Get a, get a job. That was a little surprising to me. It felt like he would've Yeah. Again, this's a connection job.


You Right, right. You know what I mean? You come in, you sit down, some organizations have eight to 10 people there, some have just a few and you have to sit down there and they have to, you know, I'm not, I don't think many people, no Bill, I mean, he is been in New England forever. So I don't know how those interactions went, but there's certainly a connection that has to be made. It's not just, you know, they have to see them say, this is the person that's gonna lead our team to a championship, not that he did it in New England and it's just automatically gonna work. Right. And so there's a lot of fit to it, having, having done it, there's a lot of fit with the pieces that are around you with ownership, the support, the communication, the general manager, the personnel people, however that works.


And so, you know, maybe that wasn't the right fit. Yeah. I think there's a chance also that he gets into media and he, he either loves doing media or he loves the time away from football and kinda leans into it and doesn't come Back. Well, I think there's just so much knowledge there and the way that he can articulate it and he explains it. And those are, when I watched him briefly, you know, in those media opportunities, that's what we felt like, you know. Yeah. Me and Teddy and, and Willie and Ty and on and on and Seymour and everybody that we played with and, and Rodney And. it was just, that's kind of what we got in a team meeting was this overall history of football, understanding of who we're playing, how we have to win.


Just the intricacies of that. And I think you saw some of that. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, he was great on the, on the draft night stuff. It's, yeah, I just, I was shocked. We'll see, you're, you're right. The fit is always, you know, the connection, the human connection with the owner and the coach. But that just feels like, maybe, maybe owners are intimidated too, where it's like a guy who has that legend behind him and the amount of Super Bowl rings. He's going to command a lot of eyeballs and kind of take a lot of attention in your organization. And sometimes you need that though. Sometimes somebody's gotta stand up there and take the bullets. Yeah. And sometimes that's a good thing. Did Yeah. Did you think the Apple TV documentary was, what'd you, what, what were Your thoughts on that?


I didn't watch it. I, they, they came in, they interviewed me. I said, you know, I can be available, you know, for, for an hour two in the summer right before training camp or something, you know, they came in and, and I didn't really, again, I was in a different position. I was coaching. Right. And I was gonna play against Coach Against Bill. I wasn't gonna play hell coach against Bill. So I didn't really like, catch much of the undertone of the, the hit piece. Right. You know, I didn't watch it. I talked to some, some big, big Patriot fans and they're like, if they spent 10 minutes on a team that won 20, however, three games or four games in a row in the National Football League, then it wasn't a very good Document.


Oh yeah. Your team Scott, they, they basically showed the first Super Bowl and they won again. And they were like, and they were like, and they won again. And also they won two more. Okay. Now Aaron Hernandez crazy. I, I felt like the roast thing, man, that was probably what bothered me the most was like the whole idea of about a roast. Like if we went out or we were hanging out, like, you'd make fun of me, I'd make fun of you. Or you'd make, and then you'd make fun of like, you're there to like you, you get made fun of and you get to stand back up. Yeah. And then make fun of somebody else. This poor bastard, he can't even defend himself. Yeah, yeah. Like he's in, he's in a great, it's like we can Yeah. You can't really, like there's no swinging back.


Yeah. From that standpoint, that was, I was some of those jokes I was like, but there was some funny moments in that roast. Yeah. Yeah. So you obviously still have, you know, close ties with the Patriots. Always. Will, was there any part of the, the Ring of Honor ceremony that maybe rubbed the Titans the wrong way? Where it's like, does he love them more Than it wrong? Loves us? Well, you're asking love person. I, I certainly hope not. You know, I, I certainly hope not. You know, when you, when you there, there, there was gonna be some uniqueness to this. I don't know, you know, I can't think off the top of my head. I'm sure there's coaches that did something, but not currently. Where I went back it was the bye week and everything was structured And, it was hopeful that our bye week in Tennessee was Patriot's home game.


And. it was And, it did And, it worked out. And as soon as it came out, you know, you call the owner, you call the, the team president. You know, because you can kind of see like, this is how it's gonna be. It, it, it's gonna be a big deal. You know what I mean? It's like I played there. You're going back there, you're gonna put a red jacket on, you're gonna stand with Mr. Kraft for four hours. There's gonna be the, you're gonna sit in the box next to 'em and you're gonna watch the game and you're gonna have a conversation and all these things are gonna be caught on television. Right. But like, my, that didn't affect my desire to, to be in Tennessee. Right? Yeah. Right. Like that's how it goes. Like you go back there And, it was amazing. And the conversation that I had with the fans was, don't be frustrated about this season.


Like, look up there and look and see, like when teams come in, like they stare at those banners. Like, I remember going back there in 2020 in the 19 season and telling the players like, you are gonna see those banners and those aren't, you know what I mean? You don't get caught looking at the pins, stripes, boys. Like those things are amazing and what they've done and yeah, they were 19 and three in the month of January in the playoffs. Like, it's gonna be a tall task, but we're up for it and I'm gonna tell you how we're gonna win. But also a lot of teams go in there and they stare at those banners. Yeah. And I wanted to explain that to the fans. Like it's not like you don't walk in NFL stadiums and see the entire end zone. Like with a FC central division champion banners.


Like these are Super Bowl banners. Right. These are Lombardi trophies. These aren't like division banners. That Was a great game by the way. Where you stole time from, from Belichick, you just time traveled. Did he ever, yeah. Did he ever say like, Hey touche, like good job RAs, Did you learn the way it's it's different. Like, I mean, bill and I, I mean we have a, I would, I think a great relationship and, but it's, it's different, right? It, it was a player coach. Now it's coach. Coach and we're, you know, we were competing against each other and now we're, you know, up, up hopefully potentially for, for some of the same opportunities if the, if it presents itself. And so we never really talked about that situation or you know, Anything else.


And it's kind of like understood, like everybody, these games are all taped guys. They, they, somebody comes up with an idea and then somebody tries to Yeah. Do the same thing or somebody Comes, but you did it like perfectly. It went to perfect moment to the guy who does it every Did. Yeah. It was good. And, and again, my guy, you had that smirk on your face. My, I did not wanna smirk. I did It. I swear To guy. You definitely had a little Smirk. But my, my guy stretch up in the box who's with the Rams now he's gonna help the Rams. John Stryker stretch. It was like my, my personal assistant game management, he was doing a lot for, for us. And now he's with the Rams. But he was in my ear and he could watch on the TV copy and he's like, he is steaming.


Yeah. And I'm like, stop, stop telling me this. And I was like, because I could not, I didn't want to like Smirk Explain, explain the situation, the loophole that you guy that you took advantage of Outside of Yeah. The outside of five minutes. Any defensive penalty, they would just wind right, right. The clock. They would just take the yardage off and then put 25 seconds back and start the clock. So you could take it down, you could, you could fall start or you could delay a game, then you could fall start. Then you can delay a game again if eventually. 'cause if you're punting from the 36 yard line or 35 yard line, you don't want to attempt a long kick in the, in the weather or whatever it may be.


What's the difference for these punters nowadays between the 40 and the, the, the, the, the plus 40 and the minus 45, they're, they're so good. They're so specialized. They'll just, you know, instead of kicking in and end over end, you know, they'll just kick it in the corner and, and kick it outta bounds. So the yardage really didn't matter. It was about taking the time off and figuring that, try to give Tom Brady less opportunities or if we gotta stop then they would have less time. We ended up stopping 'em and then they had eight seconds or Whatever and there's nothing the other team could do. They're sitting there. Yeah. They could sit up and yell at the officials and the officials are like, If, you do it again. It's gonna be this, this. And I said, you know, and like the guy jumped off sides, like the guy flinched.


I don't know what to tell you. Like, Jesus Christ, you yelling at me like I know the rules. Yeah, it's right there. And you, You've Done that. You always tell me what the rules are and we'll play by 'em, And it and we'll do the best that we can. So then the next year they said, any penalty, the clock stops, any offensive penalty, the clock stops. That's Kind of an honor to get a rule change because of something you did. I had one as a player too. What was that? What was that? So it was the old like fake timeout. 'cause the rule is you can't call two consecutive timeouts. You Pump faked the timeout. I pump faked the timeout. So we would do this on like the field goal block and, 'cause this is back when you could push. Yeah. So Teddy and I would literally stand with our hands on Seymour's ass and Ty Warren.


And Ty Warren's ass. And we would, as soon as the ball was snapped, you could push And. it was like, it would just be a tidal wave and the line would go back and everybody try to block and then you can't push anymore. Right. So we would like ice the kicker. We'd call the old time out and then I would stand up and I'd be like, time out, time out, time out. No one that the official wouldn't give it to me. And then the tight end who had his hand down, he would like think it was a timeout. So he'd pick his hand up, I'd go, that's a false start. And they would move him back five yards. Oh. 'cause the guy thought, oh, it's gonna be another timeout. Right. Watch, this guy's gonna pick his hand up. I'd be like, time out. Time out. And he would like, and I'm like, fall start. And he'd like, I guess he's right and we gotta throw it. So then they're like, If, you do that.


Then that's the delay game. You Can't do that anymore. Yeah. But we did that a couple times back in New England. You'd Also just take a guy, sometimes I think it was on punt, maybe punt return. You would just take a guy on the sidelines and be like, Hey, go run out on the field. Get 12 men for real quick. So that is a, that, that was a clock thing. And. it wasn't necessarily punt return. I don't wanna get too far into the weeds on that one. 'cause that's actually a pretty good one. It's a, Okay, you gotta keep that one. Yeah, yeah. For sake, If, you know what I mean? You're, you're down in the game. Let's say you're down in the game, right? So now you're trying to con conserve time. There's two things you wanna consume time or conserve time. If you're down, you obviously wanna conserve and, and they get a long gain on first down, right?


So now it's second to one. Do you wanna waste the time out? Right? What's the probability that they gain a yard? Give 'em a first down. Right? So you kind of just resetting the process. Right. It's smart because again, it's not about the yards. It's about the time. So you kinda run a guy out there and you know. Yeah. 'cause the worst that could happen is they get like a, a gain of no yards on the second down, and then get a first time On third down, down Game down. Then you're fucked. Yeah. Have you ever read up on, I think it was Buddy Ryan's Polish goal line defense? Yeah. You ever heard this one? No. Oh yeah. I'm trying to remember. I mean, I Played my, my first coach in New England was Rob Ryan. So you, and he'd tell Buddy Ryan's stories. He didn't tell this one. You put 14 guys on the field on defense, or like 13 guys out there? I, I think it's 12 or, yeah, it's, it's 12 or 13.


What difference does it make? If you, If you 12 twelve's good. 13. Gotta be better. But 12. It's harder. Sometimes the ref will miss 12, right? No. And well, I Mean, not the NFL refs. No. It's happened. They miss it. And If you, If you get a penalty. It's half the distance. So you go a centimeter And then if there's like six seconds left Yeah. Then they can, some of those seconds burn off maybe. Yeah. And so then now they only have one Play and you get it untimed down. Yeah. And you might be a little more like the Hacka shack where Yeah. You know, there's six seconds and you think it's the last play. Usually it's the half. But a lot of these teams now with the analytic, you know, I mean, they're going for it. Where it used to be a field goal. They would just take the field goal.


Now, you know, they untimed down the ball's on the half yard line. Most teams will go for it. Yeah. You've, you've, I mean, are you, I feel like you would go for it, a relative like you, you'd play the game of, Hey, this makes sense, you went for it. This actually was, I mean, you know, this will Compton's a fucking moron. He's got like rocks in his brains. We had the whole debate about Dan Campbell and he was like, you got, you can't go for two. You gotta, you gotta kick the extra point. You gotta kick the field goal. I was like, your Coach Mike Vrabel. Who from the outside people would be like, old school doesn't like analytics. He did this against the dolphins on the Monday night game where they're down 14 and you go for two after scoring a touchdown.


He did it. That is what that, that is playing the percentages. Yep. He, he is showing you that you can adjust and will just didn't understand that. Yeah. I I, it makes sense when you look at it that if overtime is a coin flip, right? Right. You try to avoid the coin flip. Right. And you're just trying to put the numbers, give yourself a best chance to win it in regulation and, you know, you can debate whether you want to do that from, you know, the, the eight yard line. I, I don't know what the nu the number are. Probably that the Dave Campbell. Yeah. Cowboy. Cowboy. Those You probably those I think the odds start to go down. Yeah. But you know that, that's the whole idea and the mentality seeing a lot of these teams, you know, just being able to go for it more when you, when you cross the 50 yard line.


Yep. And, and a lot of those things inside the, the, the two or three yard line going forward on fourth down, these things are all very important in how, how you combine those numbers Right. Is critical. Just like when you talk about analytics and, and, and drafting players. Right. Height, weight, speed, different scores that they put together based on the testing arm length, you know, how you weight things. What positions may take in analytics, you know, to more seriously than other positions would. Right. Like maybe not need to use the analytics so much in this position.


But historically, height, weight, speed has, has transferred, translated pretty well in these positions. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe this is what you should do for your next, when, when you get to the next coaching cycle that you're trying to get hired, you bring Will with you and you sit him down, you're like, watch, I'm gonna teach him something basic. Ah, That's risky though. 'cause he might not pick or you just debate. That's true. Might not debate. Bring a monkey in there to watch him wipe his ass before I interview. Will. What you do is you just have Will and you debate Will, and you show how much the problem If you bring Will then Taylor's right there. You know, I mean it's like, it's And they got like seven jps that Show up. Yeah. And they got a bus, which is a great idea that they had to do a podcast on a car. I love Will.


But he, I, I literally, I wanted to Fight him. I love, I love him too. I Wanted to fight him on the analytics thing. 'cause I was like, I like you just don't understand the simple math behind It. How did Beer Olympics Go? Oh, it was fantastic. I'm still hungover. It was a lot Puke and rally. Yeah. Well they, they kicked me out. So, if you puke You out. If you. I was like, I can still play. Put me back in. Coach, coach. It was like You didn't, they took my helmet pass protocol. Yeah. They took my Helmet. I was like, I want get back In you If. you pass the protocol. You took Big Cat to the tent and they were like, he's not coming outta this tent. I, I actually, I threw up after the very first Event. Did you, did they let you compete as an individual? I, I was very sneaky about it. So I just, PFT Threw up right away. Yeah. So I chugged three beers and then just calmly walked around the corner puked and came back and started drinking again. Good to go.


They didn't see that the cameras weren't on me. They saw Mine. 'cause mine was at the end of the day And. it was after all day. And I'm 39. So Did you guys show up in one of those like party buses? Yeah. Yeah. And, it was, I mean, it was fun with the boys. Like those guys are the best. All the guys that were there. The not fun part is being 39 years old and waking up with like crippling hangover anxiety and being like, what the fuck am I doing? I just wanna go home. That part wasn't fun. Yeah. But everything else was Great. Who won? Will and Taylor? So they, yeah. Oh, can we? Yeah, I know. We could bleep everyone. Ble That said it. Jimmy Trow went on Rich Isen and said who won? Oh he did? Yeah. So they, they invited everybody to Nashville to, to win. Yeah. That was basically it. They were also the Yeah, the last game of beer pong took I think an hour and a half was, it was Insane.


He was playing David bti and they just, none of 'em could see Will and Taylor beat our asses in the pool. 'cause I started a rumor that they were drinking fake beer. Oh. And everyone in the whole house like, kept on coming up to re like, are you drinking non-alcoholic beer? And so yeah, they kicked our asses. They like almost drowned. Hank I ngi the shit out of Taylor though. You Should come. I've been invited. I didn't think that was the best place for me. Probably not. It probably was. You should come as just security. Just beat the fuck outta me. God. It looked, It looked fun. It looked like carnage. It, it was a lot of, it's like there's something about just hanging out with the guys playing games all day, getting drunk. It's just, it's fun. Yeah. That's awesome. Out there throwing a ball around with the boys.


Yeah. Right. It's just fun. Like, there's nothing like there. Yeah. There's moments I think around four o'clock I was like, I'd pay a fucking million dollars to be in my basement right now, but still just Get me outta here. Yeah. Right. You like, try looking for the Irish exit. We Go like that. Yeah. Stop. Look. The My Fingers exit like the old Mountain Dew slip Aoo. Yeah. Yeah. So like me and Big Cat never had a chance to win. No. That's what we realized after we got there. 'cause you're competing against giant dudes that can, that can help all Hammer beer. We flew all here. This the bus. Yeah, We were talking, I was talking to two guys who played on Michigan last year who just got drafted. Not only are they freak athletes, they're 300 pounds and they're 22 years old. Like we had no Chance. Can't compete with that. No chance we made the cut though. Which I think is pretty good. Yeah.


What is that like top? It was like the top half. I think it was half. Yeah, half. So yeah. Oh, for half. I did it. I did it. Three beard chug in 8.19 seconds. Tom could chug. I would say that. Yeah. That's the one thing I remember. I heard that about that. He was like, Just one right down. He, he would break that Parentes. There was a bar outside of Bryant College called Parentes. And then we would go there for like an hour after meetings before bed, check at the Patriots. And. it would be like, okay boys, let's go. When did he stop chugging though? Oh, I don't know. He, he had to have stopped. There was a couple years. It was Like a, when he was new. Yeah, man, that's how it goes. It was crazy. It's a transition. That's a transition.


Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, we don't, I don't, I don't drink with like my coworkers anymore. Let's, I can't. No, they don't want To either. They won't tell you this, but they don't want to hang out. No, I know they don't with you guys. Well, if I pay, they want me there. They really don't Want like, yeah, no, they don't want me there. I think, I think we can drink with them for the first, like four or five beers and then we gotta go. Yeah. And let them do whatever they do late night. I mean, I guess if that's the, you know, the culture that you guys wanna create, you're Not cool. Yeah, we're not cool. No, you're Right. They don't want to hang out with the bosses. Just like nobody wanted to hang out with the head coach. It's how it goes. Are you gonna be on the sideline for the Browns this year? No. No. You're gonna be up in the booth. I'm not.


I'm, I'm not. I knew going in Kevin and I had talked and not having a role on game day. Oh. But I think that that's good. You know, I mean, I wanna do everything that I can, you know, prior to the, to the game, to pre advance to practices, help out where I can. And I don't want to change their flow of the, the game day. That makes sense. Makes sense. I mean, there'll be games that I go to and again, these were conversations that Kevin and I had, like, how is this gonna work? You know, first we talked about is it just gonna be for the home games? Right. Right. Would it just be for the home games? And then the schedule comes out and it's like, they got three home games in a row and then they got three away games. And I was like, I don't, that's not good to you.


That's not fair to you guys. It's, I don't think that anything I want, like, maybe I'm starting to work with a young player or helping a coach or doing something and then I'm just not there for three weeks. Like, that didn't feel so just trying to find something that's consistent. And so we came up with this and you know, I think it's gonna work really well. Have You thought about what your Sunday's gonna be like now though? Yeah. Welcome to our world. You're gonna be watching the games on TV like everyone else. It's Harder than playing. Yeah. I mean, I think that that's exactly what I'll do. I'll watch the, watch The Browns or I'll watch whoever, you know, we're playing next and try to get ready. Watch all the games. You're gonna get to watch the BA Red zone. What is that? The Red Zone or that? Yeah. You're Gonna experience Red Zone.


Oh, we have all the tv. So we put on all the games we watch. Oh, we have all the tv. I'm telling you The truth. You, You, you, you're gonna have you Having One TV guy doing guys, you strike me as a one TV guy. You guys Are like, hey, you wanna know how everybody's doing and you just don't wanna know that they're doing better than you're doing. I, It's our joke. You doings I'm doing. I Think that's also a fair question. How many TVs? You're good. How doing better than we're doing. How tv You guys got a job. How many TVs? That's true. I'm a Consultant. You don't have a job. You're Right. You work at Deloitte. Wait, are are you on contract? You guys understand, like, I used to wear like orange, brown sweatpants at I know school with a dog. Like we'd see how many dog biscuits you could eat. You want talk About chugging beers? Like you, you haven't lived until you puked on milk bone.


You know, there's like hair in those things. When you eat 'em as a, as a sixth Grader. You, you ever part of the muni lot? What's That? You hang out the muni lot ever At the what? At the muni lot isn't what it's called. The muni lot. Oh yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. Municipal lot. So That'd be funny if that was gave Yeah. My, the first time I ever smelt weed, I was like in seventh grade and my dad splurged for dog pound tickets. And, it was like, guys are like, had a keg there and they're like pouring beer, And it iss like smack passing Jays around. And I was in seventh grade and I'm like, what is this? He's like, well, it's a good time to talk through a lot of this stuff here as we're watching the ball game was at the last game at Municipal Stadium. Oh wow. Which was awesome. They were, people were pulling it, pulling. Yeah. You remember, have you seen videos Of that?


Yeah. Oh yeah. Taking out the Seats. They pull the rails and they come out or the chairs and they come out like 15 seats in a row. And. it was like, ah, ah, ah, And. it would throw it over to the thing and the place would go nuts. Yeah. Yeah. Browns fans are special. I I do have a, a good place in my heart for 'em. I've, I've tailgated a couple times that parking lot. I have never seen people that drunk before. 10:00 AM before It's Northeast Ohio is a great place for football. There's a lot of history, which is really cool. You know, and they had a lot of Ohio State players. Yeah. You know what I mean? So the, the history there, they've had a lot of Ohio State, his players, obviously Paul Brown, you know, coaching high school football and Massillon. So that's the kind of stuff that's really cool.


You know, bill Willis was like one of the first like nose guards he played at Ohio State and they said the story was that he kind of was like a linebacker and then he walked down over the center and put his hand down and that's how he became a nose guard. And, and he was a, you know, he's a Hall of Fame player, hall of Fame, pro football, hall of Fame college, you know, hall of Fame and, and Ohio High School Hall of Fame. So there's a ton of history there, obviously. And it's cool to look up and, and, and see a lot of those names. Yeah. Did speaking of Ohio, does it bother you that Michigan has your number right now? Or do you not care? I, I'm, I'm, I care a little bit. I don't care a lot. Yeah, you're not, you're Not like, you know what, I I'm not No, I'm, I care.


I I don't care that much. Okay. Yeah. you don't care that like the NCAA football game just shot on Ohio State with their trailer. Right. Didn't, didn't catch that. That didn't Cross your radar. Radar. No. Yeah. That's shocking. I thought that for sure Would've been been on your radar. Nope. That's not, We're not hot to a girl. She was on the timeline. She was on for you page. She was on the for you page. Yeah. Spin on that thing. She's Get a documentary about her And, and I love this, like, their hillbillies in Tennessee are like, and we're making sure she gets every dollar she's supposed to get. And she's over there signing hats, signing Hats. Yeah, I'm good. Confirm her for cashing in though. You guys, you gotta know.


Strike while the iron's hot. He's like, I'm representing her now and she's going to get every dollar she's supposed to earn. I'm being ethical about this. I want, you gotta have like a follow up plan if you're hot to a girl. Like how do you follow up that massive first hit? Yeah. I Don't know. There's, there's, you know, I mean, you don't Yeah, I mean, other than like a, like a fantasy camp where like, do you come in and it's like, yeah, you teach, like here's the technique. She's a coach. Yeah. Yeah. She could be a coach. She coaches all. I, I got kind of a kind of a serious question. We talked about Dan Campbell kind of serious, kind of serious. We talked about, kind of talked Dan Campbell earlier, and I feel like where you were early on in your head coaching career in, in the NFL is kind of like where Dan Campbell has been around the last couple years.


Where, what I mean by that is that I feel like journalists and the media and fans a lot of times didn't necessarily know how smart you were for the first couple seasons. They saw you as, you know, former linebacker, meathead, he's aggressive. And I don't know, If you played into that aspect to like, let people underestimate you. But I feel like that same thing is happening with Dan Campbell where he gets all the clicks where he says, I'm bringing a live line onto the field, you know, doing all the meathead stuff, but secret, that was our fault. Yeah. That was our fault. But secretly, secretly, he's like very, very smart in a, in a football sense. And he's like very, Yeah, he's been around the game. He played for a long time. He, you know, obviously was successful in New Orleans and in Miami and everything that he did.


And I think that that's his ability to, to translate that being a player, right. These tight ends are very unique positions. Right. They're, they're involved in a run game. They're involved in the, in the past concepts. So they know coverages, they also know fronts. So he took a lot of that from a, as a player and, and the way that he played the game and then translated that to his coaching style. And this, when you go out there, you're not trying to prove anybody like, oh, I'm this, or I'm smart. I'm, I'm, I'm very intellectual. It's all about what you're, what you can get your players to believe it. Yeah. Right. But I, I feel like sometimes he does it the other way where he, he puts stuff out there to make people underestimate him and not realize they're, I mean, I don't know that maybe he does or maybe that's, that's his personality, but they, they've certainly been successful and, and, and I love the way that they play.


I love the, you know, I, I always root for Dan. I I think that he's, you know, like would always have conversations with him and wish him the best until they play to Browns. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's, it is, I I think it also just speaks to the way the game is talked about as obviously evolved. Analytics, a lot of it's covered in a different way, But analytics is always something that was a part of the game. Of course. Right. There's always percentages. There are always this. And I think now that there's gotta be a fine line, right? Yeah. There's gotta be some working balance between the two. You know, they're humans and you have a feel and not every time that the conditions are the same and you know, the decisions that we make.


Yeah. They have to be, you know, you just don't want re results based Yeah. Analysis. Yeah. Right. Well, it didn't work. So, or it worked and so it was Right. It's gotta be the process thought out before. Like, if we get this situation, here's what we're doing. Always had analytics. It's just how the numbers that we're now measuring are different because we've learned what's better, what's not. And having a coach that has like real life, like especially playing experience Absolutely helps when you've got the numbers and then you also have game feel at the same time, right? Yeah. The, the, the application of it. And I, and the biggest thing is that the players understand what it is that you're doing. Right. Hey guys, we got a call upon this practice in August when we went through this situation and this is why we're doing this.


And and I think that those, once you can get the players to understand it and, and buy into it and believe it, you know, then you get a chance. Did you have that moment where you could feel that the players were fully buying into everything you did? Because it feels like every time I hear a story about coaching, and this goes back to Belichick, it's like the minute the players realize the coach is putting them in the best spot, they buy in a hundred percent and they're all in and they'll do everything for that coach. Yeah. I, I do. I mean, I think it was, you know, early on, I think we'd, I think that they, we might've beaten the Patriots in, in 2018, you know, even before we went up there and they had lost to them in the playoffs the year before and, and they went hurry up.


Right? They went on the ball and they weren't ready and they weren't lined up And. it just, it didn't look like it was a, a, a unit. Right. It didn't, there was, there was no flow to what they were doing. And so I just said, you guys are gonna be ready and to beat this team, to beat this quarterback and to beat this coach, when the game's over, you have to be mentally and physically exhausted and however you wanna put that first physically and mentally exhausted or mentally and physically. 'cause every snap, if you're not ready to go a quarterback like Tom is just gonna pick you apart. Right. They're just gonna spread you out and If you can't get lined up. He's gonna snap it and he's gonna throw to the guy that's open.


That's how they operate. And we, we, we beat 'em in Tennessee. And, and, and the guys that were there and then had gotten beaten were like, okay, we felt like we were prepared. They went empty, we blitzed them sacked. I mean, we sack down like eight, 10, you know what I mean? And they were like, okay, this, this felt better. It felt like we were ready for what they were gonna do. Yeah. So those, those, that was something that, you know, I think early on helped us. I just thought of another variable game when you, I think you held Patrick Holmes. Holmes to Three Points. We Did. Yeah. That was a class. Was that the week After? you guys lost the Cardinals opening week? I don't know if it was the very next week, but, but That was a VR game we played. We played well, yeah.


Where the Chiefs were like, oh, the Chiefs are are the best. Patrick from Holmes, you held 'em to three points. Yeah. And we had great, you know, main again to be able to, I think Travis had one catch or something like that. And so the guys executed the plan. They, they knew, you know, just, but you know, unfortunately we weren't able to, you know, to beat 'em when it mattered that that was to go to the Super Bowl. I I need you back in the Leagues. Yeah. We need the mic variable Weeks's just you and Tomlin. You get a sense. Yeah. You get a sense of it and it's like, okay, at least I've, I've got one winner this weekend. Yeah. It's always good to go into the weekend knowing you're, you're not gonna get shut out. Yeah. The Steelers or the Titans are underdogs and everyone's written 'em off. Yeah. Great. Oh, have you thought about the new kickoffs yet? Yeah, we've worked through that. What's gonna happen with those?


I think you'll probably see, I think as the season goes on, probably more touch backs, you know, I think that we'll see, you know, what's the difference? I know that analytically somebody's gonna, as soon as this comes out, they're gonna tell me the difference between the 25 and the 30. It's five yards just did it for you. Points. Yeah. Okay. Points. Is it a half a point? Third Is a third is A third is a third of A point. It's 0.1. Three points. Is it? Yeah. Good. Yeah, sure. It's a third of A points, but I think that it's gonna, if it keeps the kickoff alive, And, it keeps guys, you know, the, the special teams in the game, I think that there's gonna be more returns.


I think there will be more yardage gained. I think guys are gonna, you know, be able to, to get it up, you know what I mean? To, to be able to hit it in there and, and, and get some yardage out there and we'll see what the 30 yard line does on the touchback. Yeah. And maybe have kickers that can tackle too. We, you know, that's, that remains to be seen. That'll probably never happen. One of my best friends in the league playing All, every coach Larry izo, Larry izo came with this idea when we were in Houston and he, and he went to, you know, Larry and I played for eight years together in New England. And so he was like, Billy, I think we're gonna have Brian Peters, you know, Northwestern guy, we're gonna have Brian who's like our special team's, like really good player.


And he's like, I'm gonna have Brian kick off, you know, he can kick off. And it's like, we're gonna get an extra guy covering. And I think we were in Minnesota, first one he kicks down to like the five, and maybe he wasn't the first one, but the second one he kicked. And his, you could just see his quad go, just explode. And I'm like, Larry, this isn't gonna go well for you. Yeah. There, there's one guy. Billy was like, What the fuck are we doing Larry? I think he's on the, the Texans, right? He's, he's a safety and can also kick pretty well. He did a couple kickoffs last year. So what made it feel goal too read Is a Safety for Kansas City and then Dre Wale. Yeah, Badger. I, he was, I I really like, he was versatile.


Yeah. He was in Houston the first time when we were down there and he kicked last year. I think he had a kick against Tampa Bay, the game that, you know Yeah. Houston came back. Yeah. And, and won at the end. Yeah. Yeah. Do you still hate kickers? Because I think you, for a time period you did hate kickers, right? I, I mean I, I don't know how many we've gone through, but there should be a game. Have you kicked for the Tennessee Titans? 2008 to 2022. And I wouldn't be able to tell you if they did or not. There were some days, I think one year we probably had six field goal kickers And sometimes you just wouldn't send the kicker out there. It'd be like, you're, you're just like, I'm done with the kickers. I can't handle another, another miss. Yeah. I mean, I, I see these guys at Kick Force, Kairo Santos missed four field goals against the bills.


Bills were good. They're still good. I mean, Josh Allen, you know what I mean? A great defense. Four field goals. You know, the last field goal he missed was that fourth one again against the bills. And then he goes to Chicago. I don't think the guys missed six. No, He's been actually Money. So money. It would be, it was unreal. Yeah. And I'd watch every week, I'm like, oh, Greg Joseph, he could only kick 52 yarders when he was in Tennessee. Apparently he made a 65 yarder or whatever he did to win the game. I'm like, nice kick Greg. These guys are great guys. Apparently they get down here on a Broadway. Yeah, they can't south. They can't they can't, they can't make 'em. Oh yeah. I mean we, we, Nick Folk was fantastic for us last year and I, and I joke, but we, we had certainly Some bad luck.


Yeah. Some, some Some bad breaks. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, so I got one last question. This has been awesome. We love having you on vrs. Can't wait till you get back in the, well you're in the league, but head coaching we're If. you need us to like call in a recommendation. We got you. I'm Tried. I You on a resume. Yeah, yeah.

And now here's Gary Viter. And now for something completely different. Okay, we now welcome on a very special guest. It is comedian Gary Veer, who is here for his comedy, but also for his podcast that is out now. It's called Number one. Dad I've listened to every episode, it's an insane story. So we wanted to have you on talk about it. There's a very weird and awesome sports angle to it. So let's start there. Let's start with number one. Dad, first of all, thank you for coming in here. Totally do. Do you want to give a like a quick Yeah, yeah. I'll give a background.


Yeah, Background and then we Have a question and like kind of where like the podcast picks up. It's my dad and I, we had a extremely complicated relationship, but back, this is in the early nineties. My dad, he, for one, he's a con man. Yes. To get that like, you know, right out there, he's a con man and we stopped talking 24 years ago. But back in the early nineties, him and I, we shared this special moment where one of the cons involved me where we would go to Madison Square Garden. He called up ahead, he say that we worked for Sports Illustrated for kids that I was a reporter and he was a photographer. And when we'd arrive at the garden, they'd give us press passes to these games back in the nineties between 93 and 97.


And we went to over 50 games completely for free without tickets. And they, they gave us access to the locker rooms also. So when we would go there, not only would I meet the players, but I would keep up appearances and I would also interview the players as well. So I met all the, the New York Rangers back in the nineties. I met all the Knicks back in the nineties. And then if they're playing, you know, a cool opposing team, especially like the Bowls when they came to town and Michael Jordan was there, I met and interviewed Michael Jordan as well. That's, that's awesome. Would you actually like write stories? No, we wouldn't even write stories then. That's the thing nobody asked because over time, one for one people just believed us because after they see you a few times, they're like, oh, here you are again.


So it's all good. But they never questioned us. They never asked to see any articles or anything like that. But I would come around with like a notepad and a pen and I would ask questions mostly like, you know, bullshit questions. So it'd be like, what's your favorite food or what's your best advice for a kid that you know, wants to maybe one day be an athlete? So it's things like that, things that they would actually ask in Sports Illustrated for kids. It's crazy. And, and obviously the whole podcast is, you know about your dad and he has a ton of different cons that broke apart your family and, and like, was very hurtful. But this one, when I first saw this one I was like, oh shit, this is insane. 'cause there's pictures of you with Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing. Now how old were you when this happened? So I was between the ages of ninth to 13 when we were doing the si for Kid scam.


Did you have any idea that like you were just, you were part of this con Yeah. Or were you like, 'cause there's there's like nine years old, I could see a 9-year-old not fully understanding and being like, this is just the coolest thing ever. For sure. I mean I knew a hundred percent my dad, I was kind of groomed into ho my dad I think wanting me to be like him, right? He wanted me to be this kind of conman, this, this fast talker. A guy who had a lot of street smarts. So very early on my dad was operating like this and just everything he would do if we're going to a restaurant, he's trying to, you know, cop a free meal by whether he is bartering or might he own a, a payphone slash telecommunications business. Their, their phones would just be magically out somehow.


I would always think that my dad would cut wires and things like that and we'd be getting a free meal because they needed somebody to repair the phone system. So I was seeing my dad operate on a certain level. So when it came time to do the Si for Kids scam, I was very familiar with how my dad operated that I knew that, that it wasn't, you know, who we were. Yeah. But that we would just have to keep up this, this ploy to actually get in. So There was no part of you that was like, when you get si for, I remember getting si for kids when I was a kid. There was no part of you that was like, oh, I'm gonna see my article in here. No, no, not At all. Yeah. You're just like, this is what we do to get tickets. Oh, for sure. And my dad would take the pictures and he would use these pictures to show off to people. If we went to restaurants, he'd be like, oh look, this is who my son meets.


To kind of give him a higher profile. He always just loved bragging about different stuff. His accomplishments. He loved lying. So him succeeding in this particular lie definitely brought him joy. Yeah. So did you tell any of your friends that you were writing for a sports illustrator for Kids? No. Never told them. And that was part of my dad's thing. He was, he, he knew that. However, if I was to tell somebody they wouldn't understand it and then it would also get back to him. So we kept it very hush later on as time I was like, I wanna share these moments. I wanna share that I met Michael Jordan with people. So my dad agreed that we could tell people that he knew somebody at the garden and that's how he had access. Okay. So it was never, you know, being a completely forthcoming or anything like that. And Yeah, Go ahead. Was there like a moment growing up where you realized that like a lot of what Dad says is bullshit?


Oh yeah. And. it becomes a point where you're like, damn, can't you just be like a normal dad? Right? That's all you want. You just want your dad to be normal at a certain point. You're living this cool, this cool moment where you're going to these games. And all my friends, they weren't able to go to see, I went to Rangers game Game seven Stanley, the Cup game one, game five and game seven without a ticket. Game seven. I sat glass and watched the Rangers win the cup, went to locker room after the game, watching them drink from the cup, went to the after party. So these are things, and I go to school the next day. I can't share with anybody, but I just want, I want to, I wish that we, I could have, I wish I could have been like my dad and I, we did this thing. Yeah. But you can't, you have to keep it quiet because you don't want to not be able to do it.


And who, I didn't know what the repercussions were about lying. I just knew that it probably wouldn't be good. Probably we probably wouldn't be seen in a good light. Have any of the, so when you went, you, you posted the first like story about this during Covid, right? Yeah. And so you posted like, hey, I lived this life as a, a fake sports illustrator. Yeah. Yeah. Kids reporter. Well The last dance just came out, right. So, so it kind of brought it up and my son was just born, so I was like, maybe I should just start sharing this. And I would tell people like Nate Boetti and, and and my friends in comedy all about it when we were, when we were like starting out and they were like, oh, this is so insane. And I just, I didn't really find the right time to say it. And then having a kid of my own kindly kind of brought this out more of why, you know, make, maybe make maybe question why did my dad do this?


Why, what were his, did he even do it for me? Was he doing it for himself or was he, was he actually wanting to show his kid a good time and this is the only way he could show it. Yeah. And then kind of made me wonder, what has he been up to after all this time? 'cause like I said, we haven't talked, we haven't had no communication in 24 years. And, and yeah, I wanted to see what he's up to. When you went public with it, did any of the, I would assume none of the athletes reached out, but did anyone reach out like from Madison Square Garden or anyone being like, Hey, this is crazy. I remember this. No, nobody, nobody reached out. The only, I mean, sports Illustrated reached out just so I could write an article for them. Right. And then they went under. So I don't know if that was because of me. Yeah. But, but besides that, I would say, yeah, nobody did And.


it was before Dolan. So I think I, and I've been to Madison Square Garden, I went through like the private entrance before and it's, it's after that article came out and everything. So I think I'm good on Dolan's terms, but other than that it was pre Dolan. So I think everybody's gone from the garden by that at this point. The craziest part to me is, so you're a professional comedian, you went, I wanna talk about you. You won, did you win? America's Got Talent? No, I I I was a finalist though. Finalist. Finalist, Right? Yeah. I lost to a, a magician or somebody. It's always that, It's always a magician or some guy that like, invents a, a musical instrument that takes up the entire road. Yeah. Yeah. But so, so you, you've been doing comedy for a long time and comedy, you know, we, we have a bunch of comedians on, we have friends that are comedians.


It feels like most comedians tell a lot of personal stories. You just didn't tell this story through all your comedy all these years. Yeah. Never, never told it. It was one of the ones where I co I wouldn't even mention my dad and my act. I, I didn't want anything to do with them. I completely cut 'em off. It was just too much bringing him up. And then I needed a kind of a right platform to, to bring out the story. And then, so I felt that this podcast would be it. Yeah. It's kind of beautiful too. You ended up becoming a Sports Illustrated columnist. Yeah. 'cause your dad lied about you being a sports Yeah. 24 years later And you're like, I would hope that you're, I mean, the podcast is really, really well done. Everyone should go listen to it. But I would, I would assume you're making money now off your day.


It's like you're kind of getting him back a little Bit. Yeah, he exploited me and now that's my chance to him. Right. You Yeah, He, because he he put you through all this, This is every Yeah. This is everything he taught me. Yeah, right. It's coming right back out full circle. Yeah. That's crazy. The, the other one that, and you mentioned it there for the payphones, the, I don't know, If you listened to it yet, PFT. But his, your dad basically went around selling payphones pretending to be at t even though he had no relation with at T Yeah. My dad was a master at pretending and posturing people. He could be somebody, anybody he really wanted to be. And as soon as he saw something as, as simple as this is, but with at and t he owned and operated his own payphone slash telecommunications business.


And he would go and get accounts by saying that he personally was at and t they didn't know that he was just a one person to, maybe he had four people max working for him at, at a time, but this very small company. And he'd get accounts like ToysRUs and Costco and he'd put in all their payphone systems and all that. And this is, I mean, this winds up being big money back then. And they had no idea they weren't actually working with at and t. So Like when he'd send him a bill, would it say at and t on the bill? Yeah, he would, he would forge it. He would have their insignia and their symbol on there and, and their logo and If, you call my dad's phone, it would have the at t chime on it. So they fully believed that they're in business with at t And then he would give, when they would change over managers, he would give them a commission.


And then if they, if they move managers, sometimes he wouldn't give them commission, things like that. Just finding ways to weasel his way in and out of certain deals. You go ahead. Was was he always on the look for a scam? Like where would he go about his day and be like, oh, that's something I can, I can take it. I'm gonna circle back on that one later. Like, or was this just about like, you know, he'd get a meal here or there, he'd have a couple big ideas every now and again, like the, the Sports Illustrated for kids or was this like an everyday thing where he always had to do project, Everything. Everything he did. So before the, what predated the at and t thing, he had a furniture business and he would give some people their furniture and then some people not. And this is back in the eighties, so finding out how, where my furniture is back in the eighties, you have to jump through hoops.


You could call the Better Business Bureau, but are you one of, you know, you know, two people complaining about this furniture company or Right. You know, how long do you have to wait on the phone? This whole process or, and this guy is saying, meanwhile my, my father's saying, I did send you your furniture. You do have it. What are you talking about? This person's lying. So your word against his, and eventually people, enough people complain about my father, he wound up being in court. The Attorney General New York State Attorney General filed suit against him. And apparently my dad, it was something over like a hundred thousand dollars that, that he took from people back in the eighties, which is equivalent of like 400,000. Right. 500,000 now. And these All, all these scams do feel like you couldn't pull him off today.


A lot of them. Yeah. You can't. You can't. Now a lot of my dad's scams it's simplicity. It's him saying he is somebody and then somebody buying it. The at t thing, the Sports Illustrated. So a lot of people look at certain scams as, you know, to get into Madison Square Garden, I'm gonna have to jimmy a lock and then slide in through a back door. My dad's just gonna walk through that front door because you're gonna give him access. Yeah. A lot of his things are figuring out a way in the most simple way to get in. Yeah. We've, I I, I'm ashamed to admit this, but like, it, it wasn't until about two years ago that I realized that conman didn't mean con, like you're tricking somebody. Conn means confidence. Yeah. And So, if you just do something with enough confidence and you act the apart, then people just let you, we've always said that the easiest way to get into places is If.


you have a clipboard and maybe like one of those orange day glow vests and earpiece. Yeah. Yeah. No one's golf, Golf cart. If. You're on a golf cart. A golf cart with a clipboard. Go ahead. Go for You can get in anywhere in America. But yeah. So, so your dad was like a very confident person in everything he was doing. Oh, absolutely. Would he, would he like change his style, or was it always like a very assertive, aggressive guy? He was always like, I mean, very assertive, but you know, if he was talking to somebody who is, is like a Israeli, he could put on like a Hebrew accent or Russian, he's figuring that out French. He's all of a sudden he could like speak French. So he's a smart guy. So he knew what to say to make certain people like him. Yeah. Yeah. So you could always figure out something.


The Psychology of it is, is so fascinating to me because I've, I've dealt with a couple people in my life who are, you know, I, I think your dad is probably to the like, very far extreme, but like, I used to have to manage property in my old career and like, I dealt with someone who, they moved into an apartment and all, they made a list of like 300 things to complain about. And their whole plan was, you can't fix 300 things, so I'm just not gonna pay rent for three months until you finally kicked me out. And like, they, and then I, I looked it up after. It was like, I was very naive. I looked it up after the person was in all these court cases and that was their entire thing. Yeah. They just go from apartment to apartment knowing that they could, they could live off of people for long enough to then go to the next one.


Yeah. They just figure out a way And they just, it, it's like, I think there's such such a fascinating thing where like most people are trusting and most people want to take people at face value. So. if you have this sociopathic brain, you can take advantage of anyone For sure. And now some people are not gonna buy your bullshit, but for the most part, a lot of people are. Right. Like I said, I mean, not everybody think when somebody's talking to you, you're thinking that they're gonna be telling you the truth. Right. Even on the street, oh, I need, you know, anyway, the directions for this, by the way, could I have, you know, $5 I have no money? It's like, well now I gave you directions, you already had a conversation. Maybe now I am gonna give you five. Right. Yeah. You know what it's like. That was their whole intent, but they got you kind of talking or whatever.


People just figure out a way because they don't think that they're gonna be lied to. Right. And it and it's like, it's, it's a, it's kind of a scary life hack. It's, it's actually almost, I was thinking about it more 'cause it, again, this podcast is so, so good and I, I was listening to it all weekend. Thank you. It's like, it's like the people like in homeowners associations who complain and complain and complain and they know that if they complain enough they'll just wear everyone else down. Right. And it's like, If you, if you're just an like, If, you just annoy people to a point that they just give up. That is like a weird life hack. That's a loophole that for sure you can use And. it seemed like your dad kind of had that figured out. He's like, people will eventually give up because I Won't.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna give you your furniture because I know that it's gonna be a pretty hard for you to figure this out. Or maybe you don't wanna put in the time, so I'm gonna get away with this for a while. Right. But yeah, back back to the confidence thing. Yeah. My dad, he kind of operated on a thing where even, you know, when we're all young, you, you kind of like, I could do this thing. I could, I'm gonna sneak into, you know, six flags or something like that. I'm gonna figure something out. But when you get older, you're like, oh, I don't wanna deal with the consequences. I think as my dad got older, he really just didn't care, continue not to care about the consequences. Right. He just had that mentality like, I'm gonna go through with this. I'm gonna figure out how to, how to get by. And if I get caught, I'm not gonna be embarrassed. It just is what it is.


Yeah. Yeah. Did he ever get caught in front of you? Yeah. I mean, there was one time we were at a, a diner and I, I had like a small cut on my hand because there was some glass on the table. And my dad just went up to, I guess the manager of this diner and said that my son is bleeding, you know, you should comp our meal. And I was with a friend at the time. Next thing I know my dad was getting thrown out of the diner. So it's these little things where you don't want your father to be doing that. There's no reason for him to ask for a free meal. And who knows exactly what he said to them. But next thing you know, he's having the cops called on them and he's eventually, he, like, he pressed charges against them and he, he still got, he got more money out of Yeah.


It's the complaining thing. Like, If, you keep pushing, someone's gonna give up. 'cause they're like, I don't wanna deal with this. Exactly. That's Crazy. Is there anything that you've, you've taken from him that, that he taught you, either like knowingly or unknowingly that you've been able to use to your advantage? Like either we're obviously the podcast, the stories Right, right. Big thing, but just like his mannerisms or how he approaches people in a conversation. I would just say that, you know, basically how people take you at face value. Yeah. So you could really use that, you know, to your advantage, but you don't want to use that. I don't, I didn't wanna be anything like my dad. But in terms of comedy, if anything, it just taught me, you know, If, you could be If you could be confident If, you use your, your skillset in a positive way.


You might be able to do something actually with your life as opposed, my dad would say that he was a cop. He would say that he was a lawyer. He'd impersonate these people. He would say that he's a photographer and these are things that he all probably could have done on his own if he actually worked hard. Right. But he chose not to. Yeah. 'cause he, he does sound like a very smart guy. Yeah. And he was funny too. So I saw all this that, that he had the capabilities of being a a different person, but he chose to, he loved lying. He, he loved conning And. it seemed that that really brought him joy. Well, as, As a comedian, it's interesting because that's probably the one line of work where you can't lie about it. You can't fake it. You can't fake it. You can fake con in comedy, you can fake a lot of comics.


You go on stage and you know, you're still in front of an audience. You have to act more confident than you actually are. Right. So it does play some sort of a role. But, but yeah, for the most part, there is vulnerability. Vulnerability and I can't even say that word, but it's a good one. Yeah. And If you're funny, you're funny though. Yeah, yeah. Like you can't, I guess you could steal outta people's jokes. Yeah. You could say. Yeah. But there's still some, yeah. There's still some truth in who you are on stage, for sure. Yeah. How, so now that you're a a father, are you worried like your son is gonna have, like if he shows signs of d con man early? 'cause it is, it does. I I, I don't know the actual psychology of it, but it does feel like this is something that some people are just born with where they have that sociopathic like ability to lie and they never relent on their lying.


Yeah. I think, you know, whatever made my dad do it, it might've been his upbringing, his need to see that he, he couldn't afford things and then, you know, he was like, how am I gonna get certain, you know, material goods. But in my son's case, I think If you just try and teach them, right? Yeah. Hopefully they, and, and tell them to be honest and, and say that's not a good way to go about your life. Hopefully that they, they stay clear of that. Yeah. It's funny 'cause like every kid has moments where they, they bang their arm on something and then it's a big deal and they act like they're hurt. It's a nor perfectly normal thing for a kid to do. Yeah. But maybe you look at your kid, you're like, oh no, To sue me. Yeah. So he wake up the next day in know neck brace.


He neck brace being like, dad, where's our settlement? That's slip fall. You know what he, my son does now. And I mean, kids are, how old are your Kids? Five, three, and one. Okay. Yeah. So I have a four and 1-year-old now and my, my 4-year-old, he'll say sorry about stuff. He'll hit his brother and be like, I'm so sorry. After he does it. Yeah. But He's saying it just so he could, you know, what else are we we're gonna be like, well, you shouldn't do that. And he goes, I'm sorry. No. They know it's easy way out. Yeah. It's a very, a very good tactic at manipulating the situation. Yeah. So they ha so kids have it and it's just, it depends how you, you, you kind of maneuver around it. They're always trying teaching Right. Is wrong. Yeah. No, that's true. My, my son does the, I'll say, sorry, If, you say sorry.


I'm like, what the fuck? How did you get that? And then obviously I'll just be like, yeah, I guess. I'm sorry. Yeah. So that way we can move on. Like, yeah. Like Yeah. He'll, my kid will do that too. He'll be like, say you're sorry for, for raising your voice. Yeah. Right. Yelling. I'm like, I'm not even yelling. Yeah, exactly. I just said, don't do that. Yeah. Like, well that was too loud. Right? Yeah. Fucking Yeah. The kids are little con men. Right. How bad was it looking back on pictures and seeing your bowl cut? Oh my God. I, I would've done anything. That's probably actually why I didn't share the story forever. I went bald on purpose for that. Yeah. but it was the, I have that bowl cut is, is horrendous. but it was the nineties and Yeah.


And that's what they did. And I, the guy who, I had a guy who was cutting my hair and I guess he was, he was probably just bored. He just kept on doing it every single time. I probably, I had definitely had the bowl cut probably too long. I probably had it going into 2000. Yeah. 'cause it's like, oh, sick. You got a picture with mj. I know. Bowl cut. I know. Oh, it was terrible. So How did, how did this end? How did you guys decide? Okay. The sports illustrator for kids thing. I'm too old for that now. I was, started getting fed up with all the stuff my dad was lying about. He wasn't treating my mom well. My sisters and myself. And we'd be going to these games. Lying. I wanted a, eventually a real relationship with my father that I saw was non-existent. I saw my friends had it and I was also getting older.


And I, there was always a chance that I could run into somebody that I knew at the garden, a friend that was there. So that was always on the back of my mind. And I felt that it was kind of at its course. So I was about to be probably close to 14 at the time. And I just said, you know, we gotta, we just stop doing it. And my relationship with my dad was kind of fizzling out. Yeah. And, and you, you, you did say the anecdote that you would, when you went there, you would like go as you know, your fake press credentials, but then you would never sit with your dad. You'd sit by yourself. Yeah. So you're nine years old, Never actually having that the father son experience going to a sporting event with Right. With your dad. You Just sitting by yourself. Yeah. When, yeah, I would sit in the press area or if he found me a seat, I'd be in another part of the arena where he would be taking pictures on the floor or like, he would have his camera through, through the glass.


That's crazy. Yeah. So he would actually take the pictures though. 'cause he was, was he like your photographer? That's, he was my photographer and wouldn't say that he was my father either, which was totally unnecessary. He could have said that he was my father, but I think that he just enjoyed not saying that he was my father and that he was a professional photographer. And I was kind of this prodigy kid reporter. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it Yeah. He's, he sounds like he like got high off the lie. Yeah. Where it's just like lying to someone makes you. It's, it's, it's wild because I mean, I think everyone's probably had an experience. We know somebody like that. Yeah. We know. So, yeah. But like, it's like, dude, just tell the truth. It would be so much easier. If, you just told us the truth instead of lying. And then when we say it's a lie, you're like, well, no, it's not.


It's like, why are we doing this? Yeah. And I went to tons of therapy over, over time just to teach myself not to lie. I would lie in with my wife about things I don't even need to lie about. And then she'd be very upset with it. And you know, I, when I saw a Top Gun Maverick, I didn't tell her about it. And then she, she was like, you wanna go see it? And I'm like, sure. And she's like, you saw it already, right? And I'm like, no. And she's like, you saw it? I'm like, yes. And then she got so furious with me, but it was such a pointless lie. Right. No reason to lie. And In her mind she's like, if you're lying about that, what else are you lying about? Yeah. Right, right. Wow. That's crazy. So, So have you, have you made like a, a plan for the podcast of all the different storylines you can go down?


Are you, are you like rediscovering, are you reremembering some of these old things? Like For sure. Yeah. It feels like doing the podcast itself might be almost a therapeutic experience. Definitely therapeutic. Because a lot of the stories I buried, I had 'em so far in the back of my mind. I wasn't thinking about it. And then, then I, as I more, I thought, and then I started interviewing different people, my, my sisters. And then of course talking to old people that, that worked for my dad, And, it just brought back tons of old memories. And then just going to therapy, I, I would be like, oh my God, we counterfeited money together. You know, we would get in, he would purposely get in, he would purposely get in Fender beers and then and say, you know, act like my neck hurts also, just so he could collect on insurance claim.


So these things, you know, getting thrown outta that, that restaurant, these are all things that I completely forgot about. You know, when we would go to a movie theater back when I was, I remember five years old, the first thing that we would do is I would sneak under the ropes and then he would go find me. And it's normal who hasn't snuck into a movie theater, but not with your dad. Right. So, and I didn't think, I knew my childhood was messed up, but I didn't think that it was as messed up. 'cause I'll get responses from people be like, oh my God, I can't believe you went through this. And I was like, oh yeah, I guess my part of my childhood, you know, I missed out on certain things or at least a normal relationship with a parent. Yeah. It's it like the stories going to Madison Square Garden sounds very cool and then you're like, but it was also with your dad who you are supposed to have a relationship with, like relationship that's not running.


Cons. How, I don't understand how he never got arrested. He has everything that I've been able to find. He never has been arrested. And since 1984 he's been involved in that. I've been able to find 23 court cases. Geez. And that's just what I've been able to find. And these are only the stories that I know there. There's gotta be so many more that, that he has that maybe he will share and, you know, we'll find out. He, you also told a story, he, he was not in the mafia, but he knew mafia guys and would like hang out with them. Would you, would he take you to those places? Yeah, I never went to this place. There's a place called Wiggles and my dad installed their payphone system and had, had their, their, all their communication was done by his company.


And this co this strip club Wiggles was owned by this guy Vinny Palermo, who was the head of the Dekal Canty crime family. And some people say that that's who Tony Soprano is based off of. And apparently, and this comes from one of my dad's ex-employees, is that he found a bug in their phone. And from that point on, these guys were completely indebted to him. And that's what, that's the word that, that came from one of my dad's employees. And then knowing my father most more than likely he planted the bug. Yeah. He planted the bug, told him that just so he could be on good terms with them. False Flag. He's the hero genius. Yeah. Yeah. So it, it seems, I'm not a, I'm not a licensed therapist obviously, but it seems like a lot of the stuff that, that a con conman would do is rooted in deep, deep insecurity for themselves.


Yeah. Like every interaction that you have, you have to feel like you're getting one over on somebody. Like you're smarter than, than them. Like you're better than them For sure. Was these People who are successful, you know, to everybody else, let me feel better than they are. Yeah. I'm better than that guy. Yeah. Everyone thinks he's high and mighty. Tell you what, I'm gonna trick him and now I feel good. Was he ever like that? Was he try, was he conning you? The, you, my thing with him was I played sports, I played baseball and I played hockey. And in those senses, he would take what I was doing and use it to his advantage. If I was playing baseball, he would have to be the coach. All of a sudden equipment for the team would be missing.


Yeah. And, and that would be, I assume that he was selling it and he was, you know, responsible for, or in the clubhouse that he had access to for a little league in hockey. He was hockey basically. This is early on where they kind of started having a a u teams, especially during my age of growing up when in the nineties, and he started his own a a u hockey team essentially. And he would overcharge the parents and I would be playing on these teams. I wouldn't deserve to be playing on these teams. He would have really great players. Some guys went on to play D one and in the NHL as well, but he would overcharge their parents and he would make money off of them. Meanwhile, I love playing hockey, but then you're hearing parents complaining about your father.


Yeah. Overcharging them when, you know, a hotel shouldn't cost $400, it should cost a hundred dollars or whatever. Right? Yeah. And he'd be charging these people and, and making money off of them and then kind of putting a bad taste in, in their mouths about him. And then I'm hearing about it on the bench. Of course, It sounds like a, a lot of, a lot of complications that you have to deal with as a kid. Oh, Not stuff. How deal with Like, all the, and I could see why that relationship would probably get fractured at some point. Oh yeah. So now that you're doing the podcast and you're talking about all these stories, at some point he's going to hear the podcast, right? Yeah. Do you think he has already? I I don't know. I haven't, I haven't heard from him since the podcast has come out. So as far as I know, he hasn't, unless he's preparing a lawsuit.


Oh, that's gotta be a concern. Yeah. I mean I maybe that would be season two. Do you want Oh shit. Do you want we we probably could get sued having you in here. Yeah. Yeah. I He's a good guy. I love, I don't believe you. No. That Man, he's a standup guy. Never done anything. Never told a guy in his life. Yeah. Yeah. Would you want him to reach out? You know, so I mean the, the way the podcast is going right now is that I, I mean, I, I tracked him down. I have his phone number and that was episode that, that just came out today. So the next thing is just to wait and see. We're supposed to meet face to face in the, in the podcast. Okay. Gonna the second Avenue Deli. Yeah. Jesus. Alright, so your comedy career. So you, what, when did it start?


When did you, what was your first like, big break or was it America's Got Talent? No, first big break was Conan. I did Conan in 2014, and then that was the first time I was ever on tv. And then the booker at the time, he saw me at a comedy festival in Portland, just randomly And. it was, there's nobody in the room. And fortunately enough, I, I went on second and he was still in, he was still there. And I did well. And then I, I got booked for Conan maybe like a month later. That's Awesome. Yeah. That's really cool. So is that, I always wonder do Conan too. Yeah. So you did Conan and then was it, from that point on, it was like everything started opening up a little bit for you Then I Yeah. Started opening up, started touring more, started headlining, and then I got America's Got Talent and then going pretty far in that, that helped get an agent and manager and, and then some more gigs.


And then, you know, fortunately enough, a lot of my friends, they started doing well too. So guys like Nate and Sam Morell and yeah. The guys that I've, I've toured with Salano, so their careers exploiting as friends, help friends in, in comedy. And that's kind of been the best thing better than any agent or manager. Yeah. They, they've been definitely a, a, a deep part of any type of success that I've had. Yeah. I love that part about comedy where it's like, there's little groups and if one of them, you know, quote unquote makes it to that like big supernova level, they kind of bring everyone ar along for the ride. Yeah. And I didn't know that going into comedy, you just kind, you think it's very secluded that you, you know, just gonna be in isolation all the time, writing jokes.


But you meet a lot of people who have maybe similar past to you or, or could at least understand your past. And that's been a, a cool thing. And and then those become your best friends. Yeah. Has, have you, has Nate ever sworn around you Never Not close. Yeah. I try getting him every time. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't, he doesn't do it, is It? He won't say damn. No. He told me to not say Damn, actually. Really? I clean It up. I was like, damn, damn. Is it weird watching Nate with his dad, who like his dad, you know, does shows with him and it's like, he's incredible. Very Funny. It's so perfect. Yeah. And his dad loves the, the, the podcast and he loves the sports stuff. So it's, but it's such a different relationship than I had with my father.


Yeah. They're so close. He had Nate's dad opens for him. Yeah. And it's, it's super cool. That's Awesome. Are the Knicks back? I think. Oh my God. Yeah. And especially getting bridges. It's insane. Yeah. I love it. Villanova. Knicks. Yeah. Yeah. It's Crazy. Had none of your like sports fandom was diminished at all by any of these things? Was it For Yeah. I mean, well also the Knicks and the Rangers had some bad years Yeah. In the, in the two thousands. So that kind of affected it. So I, I took a step away from sports, especially with my dad, as I mentioned, getting involved in hockey. I was like, let me just put the, the skates down, the stick down and the skates because I couldn't be around ice hockey anymore after, by the time I was 17. Yeah.


And then, and then I'm back in it now. Yeah. You kind of just, sports just, just warms your heart. You love it, And It draws you back in. Yeah. Yeah. And especially when you have kids too. Exactly. It's like, oh, I wanna share these moments too. Completely. Yeah. At the garden, especially like the, these playoffs were just incredible. The, the atmosphere there. Like, I get it, I understand why people say Madison Square Garden is like the mecca of basketball when you see them win a playoff game and they go nuts. It was just, it felt pretty special this year. So they Yeah. The Villanova, Nicks, they've got like every player from that college. Do you want, do you want Jay Wright to coach the team? I mean, that'd be all, if he came back that that'd be insane. But I mean, right now they're great. They're great. I mean, I think that, I think coaching is, is kind of set, but I, I think that they could, they definitely make a run, but other teams are, are making moves too.


Yeah. The, it's, yeah. I mean it's fun. It's fun. Like I, we lived in New York for seven years and I, I hate to admit it, but like, when you go to a Knicks playoff game, there is a different vibe To it than And. It's better for ba if the Knicks are doing well, it's better for basketball. Same with hockey. If the Rangers doing well. Yeah. I mean, ESPN just sucks their dick the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. The Pacers weren't even in that series. Right? Right. It Was, it was just the Knicks. Yeah. Brunson is out. Amazing. And I met him at a game and he's such a nice guy and you always hear great stories about him and he, he will help old people. He is like, like a superhero. Yeah. Dante di and Ginger too. He's that, that dude seems awesome. Oh, he seems Super cool that they're, they just seem like cool Dudes.


Yeah. Yeah. See Brunson's helping old people. Yeah. I heard a story that, like one of Sam's cousin, Sam Morell's cousins said that they helped, his Brunson helped and his wife, I think or girlfriend helped their grandparents like carrying their groceries. Sam can't be trusted though, with the Knicks and like, he's just going around just doing like Gorilla Market. Right, right. For Them, Like Yeah. You hear Brunson, he saved like a bunch of puppies. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. What? Okay, sounds good. What about, What about on the baseball front? Baseball front, I mean, I like the Yankees, but I'm not diehard in any, any which way. And I, I did love baseball at one point and now I know you guys are huge baseball guys. Oh yeah. Big time.


Big time. Huge. We you're, you're, are you being facetious? Oh No, I was. I thought you were, you're not. No, we, I mean we just did our, we do a, a fantasy league called Dingers only. Oh, okay. Where we just draft nine players in the only status home runs. Oh, okay. And we started July 3rd, which is like three months into the season. Yeah. Yeah. And we drafted like half players that were on the On Reserve. Yeah. Everyone gets very mad. I mean, baseball to me is always Very Oh, because I heard Yeah. The, what's his name? Christian. You So Well we, yeah. That's a whole other issue. I don't know. We might have to, Nate would not want to hear this story. Yeah. We, we told him when he, before he, when he was on the Marlins, so before he was hitting like a ton of home runs, he was like, I think I could win a home run derby. We were like, no, you can't. And there was a porn doppelganger Yeah.


Of him who, there was a video of a guy who looked exactly like Christian Yellich eating a girl's ass. So we said, stupidly If, you ever win the home run derby, we'll eat each other's ass. And he, the one year that he, he did he win MVPI think he won MVP that year. He got hurt right before the Derby. So we dodged that. But I think he's gonna be in the derby this year. So we might have, he'd Ask, we might have to eat each other's ass. Yeah. He could end this podcast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really Stupid. Or make some good money, you know, people into That. Yeah. But at what cost? Right, right. It would just be Bella. I don't know if I could look Big Cat in the eye. Yeah. Yeah. Well you won't have to If you. Yeah. The brown eye. Yeah. This is, it's it's gonna be bad. That's actually a really bad thing that like is in the back of my head.


Kinda Like your Dad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like just bury it. Yeah. There's a thing. And every now and then it comes up and triggers a memory. Right. And we're like, oh fuck, we have to get To say that. Go to therapy. We should actually have a therapist on the show, like in Billions how they have Wendy that just sits in the corner. Oh Yeah. Yeah. You need somebody. Yeah. Yeah. What, what's the hardest part about comedy? Hardest part. I mean, coming up with new jokes is, is super hard because you might have, think you have a new joke, then you have to test it on stage and then it might not work. Are You gonna be able to, are you gonna use your dad now? Like, 'cause that I might, That feels like a treasure trove of, of Material. Yeah. I might, I'm definitely, you know, letting so much out in the podcast. So I, I mean I I, I do sprinkle it in a little bit on in my set right now, so we'll see how it goes and as time goes on, but yeah.


If there, if there's room for it, you know, it's if now that people know the story and then, you know, if they come to see me, that gives it a little bit more weight. Yeah. So that Kind of helps. Yeah. The, the, it must be a weird feeling too, now that you're a public figure, knowing that all this time your dad probably was still scamming using your name. Yeah. Telling people where He goes And like, that's my son for sure. Like, that's crazy to think about that. He probably, That's something I always Yeah, I I, I've thought about that and you know, I had concerns about him even showing up into my life before I went and, you know, approached him until now, which was when my wife and I got married. We had to tell security at the wedding venue. This is what my father looks like.


Make sure you don't let him in, because who knows? We we're like, maybe he shows up and dressed up as a waiter. Yeah. Yeah. That would be, that'd be wild though. If, you got super, super famous, most popular standup comedian in America, and then your dad's out there somewhere telling everyone that's my son. And they're like, dude, some bullshitting us. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. There's no way think God is the, the only real Thing ever, ever said. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that could very well happen. Yeah. Maybe we're Rooting for you. The, the, so, so the whole story and everything coming out have, have your friend, what has your friend's reactions been? Are they like, well now I understand you a little more like, 'cause it Is Yeah. My wife says that now. Really? Yeah. She's like, oh wow, you mean you really, I mean, she knows all this stuff, but now just hearing it and you're like, oh, you could've went one.


I mean, there's only one or two ways. Yeah. There's no in the middle, you have to, you're either going extreme, extreme liar or you're gonna be, you know, I, I like to think decently honest, you know? Yeah. Pretty honest. So I try and, you know, tell the truth and, and be a good person, be a good father because I could have been a bad father and that was kind of what was taught to me. But Maybe, maybe you're being a conman right now. I know. Maybe none of this is true. Yeah. Fuck. All of it is. And youve taken This a big spin, All of his lessons that he kind of gave you. Right. But you're just, you're taking, it's all made up. Yeah. Your dad's actually literally the number one dad. Yeah. It is all in plain sight. Yeah. You did that as a joke. But It's reverse. Yeah. We saw my son could have a podcast. Yeah. That, that would actually be a fantastic ending to the podcast.


This has been a con Here's my dad. He's a sweetheart. Yeah. Yeah. And I just knew that I would get good content out of this. Right. But I, I like what you said and it's, and I, I thought of that recently, but he exploited me as a kid trying to use me, whether it was sports or, you know, going to the games together and getting what he wants out out of those lies. And then now it's kind of my turn. Yeah. Yeah. You get back at him. Yeah. Have You, can you take what, what you've experienced with your dad and are you better at spotting another conman because of that? Oh Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, also the key is just think everybody's lying to you. Yeah. That's one. It does like, just think that everybody's full of shape. And most pe most people are, I mean, you, a lot of times you go and you start talking to people. If they're at a party, people start bragging about they're already, they're already lying because you're trying to be entertaining, you're trying to sound interesting.


Yeah. So a lot of, a lot of things that people are saying to you are gonna be false. Yeah. And it is that like first feeling of, oh, I just got conned. Like it does change you. Yeah. Where you're like, all right, now I'm looking at everyone and not like, I'm not gonna take them fully at face value. 'cause I find myself, I struggle with that where I, I think I'm too trusting of a person sometimes. And it's like I could, you know, You're trusting where the guy, when you, the Stella Blue Coffee last time I was here, you're like, I'm sending it. And you did, you sent I did. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I didn't even do. Nice. Fuck. Yes I did. Alright. But those, but a lot of times people give, you know, empty promises and they'll say they're gonna do and they don't. So, you know, you're my good graces.


You just kept your word. You're an honest Man. That's probably credit to Paige, who's our office manager here, who's fantastic. I probably was like, Hey, send him some. So she credit to her, she did the hard work. Right. But I at least said, please send him. Yeah. It happened. It happened. I wanna go back to Howie Mandell real quick. So America's Got Talent, how He's a recurring guest on this show. Interesting guy. Yeah. Did he ever, he never shook your hand right? Never Shook my, I've opened for him too. He's had me open for an ac I bombed too. It was not a, not a fun crowd to perform in front of acs. Owe a lot of trash there and, but he's a good guy. Howie. He's a good guy. So I, I would assume that doing standup comedy for like, him and Howard Stern would be, you'd be like thinking in the back of your head like, oh fuck this, is this Howard Stern?


Yeah. Super cool. Yeah, Howard Stern was one of the judges on a GT when I was there. And, and, and Howie being there and you're seeing 'em. 'cause you grew up listening to them and seeing them on tv and obviously they're both very famous, but that is definitely in the back of my mind. But even more so these shows were live, they were alive. So, and I'm at Radio City, so you have a lot going on where you kind of don't even care that it's Howie Mandel and Howard Stern. Yeah, Yeah. Backstage. It must have been quite a scene though. Like when I think of America's Got Talent and the cast that are on there. Yeah. You've got like a guy with seven dogs. You've got acrobats dancers. Oh, it's ter it's, it was awful.


That whole, the whole scene back there, it's, it's very hectic. You're waiting to go on and then you only have a couple minutes to perform on the show. And meanwhile, the person before you on my shows, they would, they, they would have a singer and they wouldn't even be singing an original song. None on my show. Sometimes they do sing original songs and that's cool, but when they're not singing an original song and, and then they're getting a standing ovation to me it's, it's karaoke. Yeah. Right. I'm telling, I'm doing my joke. Right. Yeah. And I wanted to say that to the judges, but then you seem like you're a dick. Yeah. But it's true. And also going out there, you're sometimes the act before you, they stink and then it's a cold audience and now you've got two minutes. Like just jump right into your standup routine completely.


There's no buildup whatsoever for it. You just gotta be like, okay, I gotta be funny within the first like five seconds of being on stage. For sure. And comedy works better when there's comedy a little bit before you Right. An audience just needs to start hearing jokes and just getting warmed up. So the whole setting is tough, but I, I, whatever the lineup that they had me in it definitely, it worked to my advantage somehow. Yeah. Was there any reservation of doing America's Got Talent that it was like not a comics comic move, like you're kind of doing this thing where people are gonna look at you and be like, it's kind of cheap For sure. Really? Yeah. You in the back of your mind, you just don't want to, it's kind of an icky feel of you don't want to be associated with it.


It's not as, it's not as cool as a Conan or, or being in in the light of, you know, just I know kind of a cool vibe. Right. Which is a crazy thing to be like, I'd rather grind it out in clubs Yeah. Than have this like be on network television right In front of me. I guess an advantage is not winning it. Yeah, true know because then you don't have that the label, but you still have Oh, I was on and you have Cool Clips. Yeah. I Still feel like a lot of comics or a lot of people from America's Got Talent have from America's Got Talent after their name. Who's The most famous America's Got talent person? Jeff Dunham. I don't think he puppet Guy. Was he? Who, who's the most successful? He Brought puppets back. Maybe Gary Veer. Yeah. Maybe it might be you. It could be you.


Most successful America's Gary Vier and Manny Veer my, that just a badge To, it'd be funny if it was like, Did they do like a puff piece on you or like a sob story? Yeah, I li oh well I lied in my, in my sob story I said that I had, well there are two things I lied about. One, I said that I had a roommate at the time because I didn't have material yet about having a, a girlfriend. We were about to get married. So I made up a whole story about having a roommate and, and that was my backstory. And my roommate was, was played by a comedian Greg Stone. And he was kind of just a piece of garbage and he would steal from me. So that was kind of my backstory. But my, I was actually getting married at that time and I didn't wanna share that with 'em 'cause I didn't want them to ruin the wedding. Yeah. So it was either them or my father that was, that I was thinking was gonna ruin my wedding.


Yeah. But I don't recognize any of these names. Terry, Terry Fader, he's an impressionist. A Lot of these guys, If you win, you get a show in Vegas. I don't know if they, I'm pretty sure they still do that, but Yeah, I, I remember that name Sounds familiar. Yeah. It'd be funny if it was just like, if I was scrolling like Copperfield Kaw Leonard. Yeah. Yeah. He just went and dribbled and was like, oh shit. And I, the old eight dogs won in season seven. I Remember them. Yeah. Yeah. A bunch of like little small white dogs that did all these tricks and jumped through hoops and Stuff, stuff. Matt Franco, I don't know, I don't recognize any of These. I was on season 10 Paul Zin. Yeah. So you lost to a puppeteer. Yeah, puppeteer vent place. That's brutal, dude. Yeah, it was tough. That's, it was really tough.


That's The most tragic thing that's ever happened in your life because You try. Yeah, I know. You try. You do. And you try so hard to be funny. And this is a set I'm gonna do be doing. And you run it even though it's two, three minutes that you're gonna be on stage and then Yeah. You lose to a guy who's a ventriloquist. What's also tough about America's Got Talent as a comedian is they've got, don't they have the like buzzers the exes if they don't like you? Yeah. So you can like tell one joke and then you just hear buzzers and then you have to keep going until they all act you out. Right. Oh, completely. And Heidi Klum did not like me whatsoever. Oh shit. And she was still pretty attractive back then. Yeah. So, and but, and also I thought, you know, I loved her too growing up.


So then hearing that you're is part of you as a, you're, you're a kid. Yeah. When you're talking to one of these people that you knew back then that you know in your mind and I remember her saying that She didn't like my comedy, it hurt, but I'm at the, and then I'm like, screw her. She doesn't even know the language. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. Good Point. Right. You're, you got this was It wasn't Red Panda on America's Got Talent? I don't think so. Shin Li was the big winner. I know he's got like a whole act in Vegas. I feel like that's what my wife song she Got discovered. Wife Said sucked. Yeah. Yeah. Season eight America's Got Talent Was Red Panda. Red Panda. That's where she got discovered from. Yeah. Well she, she, She, she's the most successful. She's the most talented person. Yeah. Alright, I have, I have a couple last questions.

Do you think there's gonna be a, a movie or a show out of this Right now working on writing up a a TV show Hikes? Yeah. And do you Need any cameos? Oh, absolutely. Podcasting. I think it'd be, I could see you guys in it. We we're, we we are like, we strike out on every cameo. No, But if it was up to me, I want to throw in as many of my friends as possible. Yeah. I think it's super cool. Who Are you gonna play? Your dad. That'd be cool. I mean maybe, I mean they might need a bigger name or, or something. I, but I would be totally down and I think I could do it. Yeah, for sure. And I think that it would be cool because it could be, you know, definitely a nostalgia piece. So back in the nineties maybe, maybe mixing, you know, present day. Especially me being a, being a father now and and stuff like that.


I think it'd be, I think it'd be really cool. But whether it's a TV show or a movie, I think it has legs for you. Iro. I agree. What about, so I know that the an I know probably the answer to this, but has there ever been a small part of you that's like, let's go to a game and pretend there we're someone else? Yeah. Abso absolutely. Yeah. You wanna do it. Especially when I had no money. I, it's all I was thinking. I was like, I could go to these games and I could probably get in and and figure out a way. Yeah. And I do know how, but it's, it would make me look so bad. I can't, I can't say it. Yeah. Think think of the worst thing. And that's how I'm getting it. One time, oh, One time I tried to sneak into RFK stadium, it was the National's First year And.


it was the 4th of July. I was drunk, I was shirtless and I, I went up to the media entrance and I told 'em, I was like, yeah, you have my name on the list. And they're like, no, we don't. What's your name? I told 'em I was Michael Wilbon. And they said, no, you're not Mike Wilbon, he's black. And I was like, Touche. That was my, that was my biggest experience. But Hank our producer, he used to sneak into the Boston Garden What, like almost every night With Butter Knife. With A butter knife. Yeah. He, there was one door that had had a latch on it that you could just go up to and wiggle, get into the garden. And he like early Barstool days when the Blackhawks played the burns of Stanley Cup and Dave and I went to a bunch of the games and we were looking for tickets for one of the games. Hank was like, we could just butter knife in him. We're like, dude, like dude, we can't like do imagine the look of us like trying to break into the Stanley Cup front.


Right, right. He like, he just didn't even think about it. He is like, it'd be no problem. We'll just butter knife in. I know the door. But yeah, he used to do that all the time. One thing I do agree with your dad on, it's fun to sneak in places. Oh yeah. That's very, very, it's A thrill. It's a Absolutely. You have a rush. You, there's something about it. There's something about not paying for something and then getting away with it. Yeah. And you gotta see something. That was amazing seeing Game seven of the Stanley Cup. I, I was at Jordan that the time I met Jordan was at his double nickel game. That's crazy. So it just wound up being this historic event that I was able to go to completely for free. And you got, you got to interview Jordan one-on-one after I did. He was in a private locker room. It was him Phil Jackson and a few other assistant coaches. And then I just went in there. I only asked him one que I asked him what his favorite food was.


I couldn't, I was so freaking nervous that it was Jordan and I, I mean I, I could believe that we were able to do that. Yeah. And that game, the actual real Sports Illustrated for kids was there. And this is the only time they ever, they were ever at a game. And they weren't, it wasn't a kids' reporter, it was two adults. They didn't use kids back then and wait, what? Yeah, they didn't use kids. So that was another part. Nobody even, but It Was scammed them. It was four kids, not by kids. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But eventually they wound up using kid reporters. Maybe they got it from my dad. Yeah. But at the game we found out that they were there and my dad went up to them and asked them for their business cards. I don't think he led on that.


We were saying that we were Sports Illustrated for kids, but he said whatever to them, got their business cards and when it came time at the end of the game to go in security, let us in. Didn't let them in. I go and meet Michael Jordan we're coming out and then they were still trying to get in. That's crazy. Wow. Yeah. And, and not only this, I was, I found this out 'cause we interviewed and we had to cut it for the podcast, but I was the last person to interview Michael Jordan for Sports Illustrated be for kids because he didn't take any interviews with Sports Illustrated. They had an article called Bag at Michael, title Bag at Michael. And from then on he said, I'm never interviewing with Sports Illustrated again. So You were the only one. Yeah, He let me slide. 'cause mine was in 95 and that article came out in like early 95 or 94 And And you weren't even Sports Illustrated.


Yeah. You need to get in touch with mj. I know. Be like, listen, your boycott actually stands. Yeah. I didn't actually work for Sports Illustrated. Right, right. Yeah, it still Works. Which, what was his answer though? What's his favorite? Steak? Steak. Yeah. Good Choice. Good answer. Yeah, good Answer. That's a good steak's. Good man. Yeah. Alright, well Gary, thank you man. Anytime you're in Chicago you gotta come by. Definitely. We appreciate it and everyone please go listen to number one. Dad. It, I can't recommend it enough. It's, it's like a very nice, refreshing change of pace of like, it's in the line of a True Crime podcast but it, you don't have to listen to someone getting murdered. Yeah. Yeah. That's the best. Yeah. It might be your Elevator pitch. Maybe my dad did murder somebody and I don't know about it but it, you know, it's not in the pocket.


I Feel like he, I feel like he didn't have that in him. Like he's just, he just gets off on lies. I think he's the type of person that he could be Aja he'd be adjacent to it. Yeah. Not he, he would never have the blood on his hand. Right, right, right. Well thanks so much man and best of luck with everything going on with this podcast in the show. Thank You both

Okay, let's wrap up. Fire fest of the week. Hank. I have bicep tendonitis in my right arm from hitting dingers. Wait, sorry To Hear that. Hold on. Is that bad for golf? It's terrible for golf. Why? Because I can't really lift my, it hurts to lift my right arm. So the backswing, there's a lot of pain. A lot of pain. Yeah. I saw you try to eat an ice cream cone today and when you couldn't eat an ice cream cone, I knew it was significant. Yeah. I mean it's not like, you know, debilitating pain. And, and I talked to a esteemed doctor, AKA chiropractor at the office yesterday and he gave me some exercises to work on. It feels better today than yesterday.


But I keep doing things and, and reaching for things and going to like lift things up and just being like, ah, ah, Ah. So yeah, I was trying to eat ice cream and almost Died. Here's a good exercise, Hank. Put your elbow kind of down at your side. Bend your arm at 90 degrees, lower it a little bit. Lower your elbow low. Yeah. Drop your whole arm a little bit. Wing it down a little bit. No, no. Like this. Hank look at my arm. Like that. Bring it down. Bring down over to you. Bend it over to your, now start moving your wrist back and forth. You don't know what he is trying To do. Yeah, like that. There you go. That's good. He's trying to get you to jerk off. Hey. Yeah. Oh yeah. Just do that a lot.


You'll be fine. I've just searched it. That's, that's like golfer's elbow. Is it the same thing as golfer's elbow? I dunno. Is that what it says? Yeah. Yeah. That's Bad. So Hank, when I fucked my elbow up a couple years ago, you remember that I had like the, the UCL when my, my fingers went numb from swinging a golf club. I actually got injected Billy football injected those research chemicals into my arm and they worked. Now the downside to this is you have to let Billy football inject you with research chemicals. but it worked. So the question is how bad do you wanna golf? We'll see, I'm just gonna ride it out and just hope I wake up tomorrow and I'm Fine.


Oh that's a good, that's the point. It's a wait and see approach. Yeah. Okay. I don't hate that. Ice, Heat, ice, heat. Is that, is that medically advised? Ice? Heat. Ice heat. Have you Done any of that? Yeah. What's the heat? Like a heating like a I have like a Heating pad. Heating pad from my, when I blew my back out a few years ago. Yeah I'm pretty sure you just have to go ice or you just have to go heat. I don't know what ice heat. Ice heat does. Well ice is right. After, you injure it? Yeah, first like four eight hours. Heat. It can be used when you're like, if he's like actually gonna go out and play it can help warm up the muscles. I don't know if sitting on your couch heat does much, but I'm not a doctor.


Well good luck Hank. Thank you. ICE is a great choice for the first seven, two hours. Like I said, so maybe I am a doctor. Heat on the other hand, helps soothe stiff joints. Right. So I, I actually nailed that. That's heat is what you do when you want to go play. And you want it to feel like warm and, and good. Wow. Yeah. I just don't know. If. you should do both at the same time. No, no, no. Oh, That's hot ice. Well, Hot. You, you said ice, heat, ice, heat. Back And forth. Like ice it and then heating pad. Yeah. Okay. Well good luck. Thanks. Yeah. I really want you to be happy because I can, I can't take this hank for the rest. Yeah. I like, I I think we said it would be a shame If, you got hurt and couldn't golf now that we're here.


It Is a shame. It fucking sucks. 'cause I need, it's like having a dog like on a rainy day. A hype, a hyperactive dog like Leroy dog. Yeah. But it looks like you're like Blake. No, no, no. You're a hyperactive dog. Sorry. Sorry. No. Like Blake is like that. Yeah. And he had, he had two elbow injuries. Yeah. But you And he couldn't go out and play and Yeah. He was a pain in the ass. Yeah. And You're stuck inside and you're like, man, I wish I could just get my dog to run around. Yeah. He would be a lot happier in sleep. We need you to play some golf, so you'd be a lot happier in sleep. I actually have some of his old anxiety medication that I use to keep him calm. Maybe Hank could use some of that. Oh. Put a cone on you. You'll have to talk to a dog to make sure that it's okay to take. So we'll have p see If.


you can take that Medicine. Yeah, I think it should be fine. Yeah. Okay. My fire fest of the week is, I've gone down a rabbit hole and I've got a new hobby. Oh. 'cause I've gone down a rabbit hole too. And I think that the driver actually was the one who shot JFK, but go ahead. Oh, In like, way back in the day. Yeah. Well, you can bet your ass that it, it wasn't the story we're being told. Yeah. Because the secret service agent said he found that that bullet, that bullet. I watched, dude. I watched one video, And. it looked like the driver turned around back. Either way I'm down on the rabbit holes. Go ahead. Back into the left. Yeah. So my rabbit hole is just about growing weed. Yeah. So I've been talking to a lot of people about it.


I think I'm gonna start growing weed on my rooftop, which is legal. It's totally legal for personal use. But they said, I gotta go to a store and ask for a clone. And then when you get the clone, then you can grow it. And then the trick is to harvest it before it gets too mature. That way I can get my mids nice. My, my perfectly average weed. Nice. And then if it does well maybe I'll experiment with it. It does. Well then maybe we get into the, the weed business and we sell P-M-T-H-C. I like it. What do you guys think about that? I like it. I've gone to down this rabbit hole before. The key is when it's, you're ready to pluck it, it's drawing it out.


So you gotta wait, you gotta, you, You gotta wait, you gotta dry it properly. Or else you're just gonna spend months growing weed and then you go to smoke. It And it just wet as hell and pointless. Yeah. Yeah. So I, that's all I've heard. So I, I need to talk to somebody that has experience in this. My aunt actually grew weed when it became legal in Virginia. She had her own plants and then she gave me some of it like in bags. And. it was like the most 1960s. Yeah. Shake ever with like seeds and stuff. I don't want that. I want, I want like de just decent weed. Also, I've heard If, you fr if your friend that you're growing it with wants to like pluck it soon. 'cause they really just wanna smoke it. but it's like If. You're supposed to wait an extra couple. We in. You get a lot more. Yeah. Just wait. Okay. If my friend tells me that, I'll keep in mind what would you say to people who say that you're a drug guy?


I'm not a drug guy. Okay. Marijuana is not a drug growing weed. It's an herb. It comes from the earth. Watch this video. Watch this video. Is this Revelle? No, this is, it's No, I don't wanna watch this. No, It's fine. This is revelle. No, I know. No, it's not. It's not. It's not HK eight K. Look, the driver. The driver turns around. Bang. Oh yeah. I told you I've been down some rabbit holes. I, I, I unfortunately have gotten into a, a very bad, I Mean, this has to be an edited video. I have that video. The guy's holding a gun into hit him in the head. I've gotten, there's no way that that is the video. I've, that's the most edited video Of all time. Dude. Dude, my algorithm Turns around with a gun in his hand. My algorithm is so toxic Now.


That is not, there's no way. Yeah. I clicked on like three things a week ago and it's, it's gotten crazy. The internet that I've gotten into is crazy. So yeah, I saw this and yeah. Now that I think the driver did it, I'm, I'm not, I'm my mind's still open about this. Yeah. Okay. I guess JFK's Is, that's fine. Just, just, just click. Is That too soon? No, you're good. Just click, click more of those videos and you'll, you'll see it. Yeah. It probably is edited. You're right Hank. Yeah. It is so crazy. Have you guys seen the octopus murders on Netflix? No. So it's a crazy, crazy documentary series. One part of it is this dude who claims to be CIA brings somebody in, shows them the video and then edits something into it and tells them like, this is the video that you haven't seen your entire life.


And then that person spends the rest of their life not knowing what video is real Oh shit. And drives them nuts. Now I don't know what's real. Yeah. That it's all a simulation. Yeah. Okay. My Fire Max is a hiccup. Yeah, it's a hiccup. My fire fest Not on my mic was still On Tuesday night. We hit dingers. It was a lot of fun with the boys, but I think I'm officially, officially washed because it was one of those things. I had so much fun being out with the guys. I'm not claiming I was ever a great athlete, but I do think a younger self, I could have probably hit more dingers. And it was halfway through the whole competition and I looked at the leaderboard And. it was like me, Titus Chief Brandon and I did the math And.


it was like every guy who's 37 plus and Max obviously played college ball. Like Max was a fucking beast. So I would never thought that I was gonna hit as many dingers as Max, but it just dawned on me that it might be time. I I I might be washed. Hank did what? Hank Hank thought he was gonna hit as many as me. I don't Under, I don't understand. I I don't understand. Max, Why are you going after Hank right Now? Is Oh no, no, no. This was, This is crazy. This is like, this is, This is good. I am a competitive person. We are a team. Max is by far and away the best hitter. So I'm, I'm striving for something like, you want to be the best. And in order to be the best, you have to beat the best.


Now do did I think I had any chance of beating Max? No. If we did that a hundred times, would I beat him once? Maybe. But like, I think you, I think you thought you were gonna beat him at one point. I didn't think I wanted to beat him. Yeah. But I never thought I was going to beat him. But I don't think there's anything wrong with like, wanting to beat the person who's the best. Here's the, here's the question, right? I'm not gonna lie. Seems crazy. When Max was up at the plate, were you rooting for him to hit home Runs? Yes. Because I wanted to leave. Or were you happy when he didn't hit Home runs? I wanted him to hit home runs because there I wanted to leave. Was there any And I want any rooting For him to not hit home runs? No. If it had gotten closer, maybe, but it, it, it, So at the beginning when it was close, It never, no. 'cause it took me a couple rounds to get hot. There was a point where I was like maybe six or seven behind and I would, but I also was, my arm was fucked.


Yeah. Hank was awesome. Yeah. Yeah. No, but I will say like, when you came up to me and were like, how many did you hit last round? And then someone was like, are you trying to beat him? You're, you're like, it's keeping me in it, it's keeping me in it. Yeah. And then competitive drive that kept that like, I was kind of like cruising. And then you said that I was like, alright, now I just have to hit a home Run on Everyth. So that was good. Thank You. Did you did like iron Sharpens iron? Yeah. Yes. Then I ended up, but then people Were like, I, I can't believe you wanted to beat me. I like, yes. I don't, I don't, there's nothing against Max. It wouldn't have mattered. Who, you know, the best person was like, why do something If? you don't want to try and win it. Okay. No. Yeah. And it And it kept And it kept me more involved too. It did. I Could see both sides. Many fine people on both sides.


Yeah. It was fun. It was a lot of fun. but it was so much fun. I'm so much fun. but it, it, it was the first time. I mean, there's been other times, but it was the first real time where I was like, if I were 10 years younger, I feel like I would be hitting more home runs. And I like, I was maxing out everything. I had And. it wasn't that good. Well, you didn't have to swing that hard. Right? 'cause it was only 215 feet. Right. You just made decent contact. No, I wasn't maxing out my swings. I'm saying I was maxing out the fact that I was tired after four swings. Right. I think I was You went the third furthest ball. But still, I was just not That's what that actually proves my point even more that like, I feel like it, it was there at some point and it's just completely gone now. So that hurts.


That hurts. Shout out to ibo. He was a fucking Yeah. IBO was a monster. And it and e like that's the thing. I'm not, I'm not deluding myself to think if I were 25 years old, hit the fifth, fifth, fifth, Fifth. That's On, that's on me enough. Yeah. If I were 25 years old, max would still kick my ass. IBO would still kick my ass. I just think I would personally have performed better At school is hilarious. They put my fucking film school. Yeah. They put your film school also Jersey Jerry's just bar stool. Yeah. So yeah, it was, it was a lot of fun. Thank you for everyone who watched just hitting dingers. We gotta do it again. It was just, we should just do it and not even count it.


I'm down to do it just casually. Yeah, it was, it was no so much fun taking pp rocks. Yeah. It was so much fun. Okay. Matthew, did you get a fire fest? Yep. Okay. City living very new for me. Okay. Grew up my house is a next to a farm. Your country mouse. So yeah. That's all I know is fresh air and nothing else. So yeah, just trying to get like, and like, you know, trying to get here like a 45 minute walk doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me. But when I said that yesterday Jerry had a, a pissy fit when he was like, well, 45 minutes. That's a long, that's a long walk. Yeah. So I, you know, it's small stuff like that.
