I I am in love with him because he makes me want to be a better person. He made us hard. He made us hard. He, he, he's the famous, we, we played the clip when he was introduced. He, he's, his goal is to make the Chargers harder to break.

Today is Friday, August 16th and PFT. We've got injuries. It sucks. We've got injuries. This is the worst time of training camp. JJ McCarthy is out for the season. Jordan Addison may out for a while. It's tough. It's really tough. First, I, I'm, I'm upset for the Vikings fans out there. You you had a lot to look forward to, especially after week one of the preseason. Everything looked great. I guess the good news is that Sam darn no longer has mononucleosis. Yeah. Seven year bump. I I, I posed this question. I I I, I got ratioed to hell. I posed this question when it, when JJ McCarthy was announced out for the year.


Am I crazy for thinking Sam Jar might have a good year now that I posed the question before Jordan. Addison got hurt, but my whole thinking was he's gonna have the best receivers he's ever had. Seventh year bump. Yeah. No Mono. Kevin O'Connell. Good coach. Played quarterback. Kevin O'Connell got good stuff outta Josh Dobbs last year. Yeah, I mean, Sam, he's a, he's a quarterback friendly coach. Sam Darn. Just remember like Sam darn did, he did play the quarterback position with the greatest handicap of all time. And that's Adam Gates. Adam Gates, yeah. So, yes, he had to get the stink of the jets off him. He's been around smart football guys for the last year.


Yeah. He went To San Francisco. San Francisco. San Francisco did some rehab there. His grandfather's name is Dick Hammer. Yep. So that you got that going for you. I just, that's the ultimate Thor for all the Vikings fans out there. Yeah. This, this might be crazy to me. I, this this might be the dumbest thing I've thought, but I, I kind of feel like, and I don't want the Vikings to be good, but I, I kind of feel like Sam Dar might surprise some people this year. And I think his head is gonna look normal size in that helmet. Yes. In the purple it's gonna agreed. Yeah. It could be worse. I think they're doing the right thing you want. Oh, It definitely could be worse. You wanna do you wanna do the Yeah, you could have absolutely no plan at backup quarterback. Which at times it looked like you had no plan at backup last year. Yes.


I think he's probably remember Josh Dobbs? Yeah, Josh Dobbs was good for like a couple Weeks whenever he changed the team. He was good for that first couple weeks. Yeah. Just bring him in. Just bring him in for one week. Yeah. I he'll probably be on, on same phase as new places. Who? Josh Tobbs? Yeah. Is he in the league? I think he's in the league. Yeah. I think he's on a roster Right now. We're gonna do that in a second. He's gotta be on a roster. But yeah, it could be worse. It's the right call I think to do the long-term meniscus surgery. A rookie quarterback. Yeah. No, it's Absolutely the right call. you don't want, you don't wanna rush 'em back from this at all. They're, they're not in winnow mode. It makes no sense to, to rush 'em back. A team that I guess is in winnow mode is the Atlanta Falcons who traded for Matthew Judon. They're all, all in. They're all in. Hank is not here right now.


He's gonna be here for the Mount Rushmore. He is though. We're taping this part of the show, obviously on Thursday. We taped the Mount Rushmore on Wednesday. Hank is, if you're listening to this, it's already happened. He's led the New England Patriots out on the field via lighting? No, the lighthouse. No. Via ringing a bell. He Rang a bell. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine. Yeah. You, you ring the bell and then the bell lights the light. Or maybe the light's already lit. Yeah. He's ringing the bell to symbolize to commemorate the lighting of the light in the lighthouse. And then the team's gonna run out onto the field and Hank's gonna have a little shit eating gr on his face. I'm happy for him. He loves that fucking lighthouse. It's gonna be great.


But the last, so the last time we talked to Hank, he said that Matthew Judon was having, was it friendly and what was it, what were the two words? Maybe? Like Friendly. Friendly and good Friendly. Good normal conversations. Conversations with head coach Mayo, it turns out. And he also took a side swipe at memes and was like, Patriots are classy organization. We'll figure this out. The Jets won't. And then maybe like two hours later, Matthew Ju Don got traded. Yeah. Do we know what what they got in return for A third round pick? Third Round pick. Which Fleeced? Well, I mean, Matthew Judon is a very good player. He's also 32 and he needs a new contract. Yeah. So that would be the part where it's, you know, the third round pick.


'cause it always happens whenever a player that you know gets traded and you're like, that's it. Third round pick. It's like, oh well yeah, he needs a brand new contract and he's gonna get paid. He's gonna get paid. And you're right. Although the Falcons, I, I heard like there isn't a plan to give him a new contract To extend him right away. They, they actually did the opposite of the Jets. The Falcons might be the classiest organization or the three, they did not trade for him with any pretenses of a new contract. So he's gonna go there. But he, what if he just wants a new contract? I'm sure he does want a new contract. That's why he wanted a trade. So, but he'd rather play out his contract with a team that's not going to give him a new contract and is upfront about it than with the Patriots. Yeah. It seems where it Wasn't don't Want to be on the Patriots.


Yeah. So it's weird also, it's, it goes against everything I've ever known about the Atlanta Falcons, which is, they've been committed for as long as I can remember to not having any players that I can name on their defense. Yeah. And now they've got a couple really good players on their defense. Yeah. And I dunno, the Falcons, I, maybe I was a year ahead on the Falcons. Maybe the, this is the year that the Falcons tie it all together. I Think it's just gonna be a lot of teams in the NFC South that are gonna be nine and eight, 10 and seven. And then the Panthers. Yeah. Probably And it, it's gonna go exactly like last year where it's gonna be the three-way between the Falcons, the Saints, and the Bucks. And it's like whoever just ends up winning a couple of these head-to-head will go to the playoffs. I'm Gonna look at these odds real quick.


See what, what the odds are for the Falcons to win that division. 'cause I, I like them this year. They're probably not that high just because of there's no dominant team. Yeah. I I have already said that the Saints might not be as bad as people think, but memes, I, Do. I did want to ask you real quick because you got the sideswipe. How are you feeling today knowing that you are at least partially vindicated, even though Hassan Reddick is still holding out and the Jets are still not figuring this situation out? Hank being immediately wrong was delicious. Delicious, delicious. Oh, good word. Good word. Does it take some of the sting outta your jets? It takes some of the sting out.


I still want them to resolve it quickly then it's a massive w for me. Yeah. Then it would, if they, if they get Hassan Reddick signed within the next like 48 hours, then you, you get a huge dub. But if it take, if it goes into the season, it's, Or if he doesn't play and you trade him for something less than what you traded him for, then you're back to a loss. Yeah. That's a major loss. 'cause Hank was technically right. They did figure it out, but So yeah, they did figure out Matthew Judon pretty quickly. It was productive and good. Normal good. What Was it? Yeah, I think it was good and happy or something. Good and Happy conversations. It was like f friendly And. it was friendly in something. Yeah. Now It means what? If, you traded Hassan Reddick to the Patriots Happy so bad, God forbid.


But, but What if Hassan Reddick, then what, what memes, what If you traded him to the Patriots then Hassan Reddick said, I'm not gonna play for the Patriots. Then that'd be a massive w But then okay, but then the, what if the Eagles traded the Patriots to get Hassan Reddick back and they got more than what you paid for. That'd be a loss. But the Eagles season's already over because apparently Jalen Hurst is throwing too many touchdown passes and not enough interceptions in training camp. Is that right? Max? Oh yeah. Nick. Nick Wright is my new, is my Florio. Oh, nice. A new Florio has presented himself. So the problem is that what, what he's he's too good because I know they always say you learn more from mistakes than you do from success.


So he's, he's not throwing enough interceptions to learn anything. Yes. They said that That's such a good take number, number. He's co completing like 80% of his passes. And number one, he just kept saying, he is like, I know this is gonna get aggregated. I know this is gonna get So he's doing it. You're Aggregating him right Now. That's not what Nick Wright sounds like, but yeah, that's, That's he's, he's doing it to get clicks and he's admitting that he's doing it to get clicks because he knows that He sounds Yeah, you should never admit, admit. But he sounds ridiculous. He sounds ridiculous saying that he's not throwing enough. He's not watching any of the camp. How do you know that Nick Wright, he's a smart guy. He watches the tape. He, there is no tape. But What do you mean there's no tape? How many you don't think he's got tape? How many times have we gone to camp and, and There's tape being filmed, But you're not.


But like, so that's for the team, But maybe he has access to It. Yeah, maybe he has access. He doesn't have Access to that. Nick Wright has all 22 access that knows else. He's saying that he is not taking enough risks. He's been very, how the fuck is he supposed to know that It is a great take? He's like, he's not taking enough risks. You gotta you gotta throw some picks in training camp. It's Such a good take. I, I'm pretty sure I had this exact same take ironically about Nick Foles when he threw two interceptions. I was like, this season actually sucks. Yeah, you gotta, I mean you gotta, I I do. You do even then want guys taking risks. Like Rogers at the end of his career with the Packers, there was the argument that he, he was obsessed with not throwing interceptions that he would not take some risks.


But even then you're watching it. Like if he was watching every play, but You don't know that he wasn't watching. He's, there's no way he's watching it. What about a pick on third down If? you throw it deep down the field. Same as a punt. That's a good pick. Sure. Okay, so Let's talk about the positive word out of the Eagles camp is big Dom is just running the whole show now. Rocks. He's the best. He's the coach of the team. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. We had a, we had a problem last year of IG someone being the guy that everyone can look up to. We got that guy. It's big Dom. So Max, I love Big Dom. Don't get me wrong. Love the guy. Is it a, I Don't like the way Is going. I'm just curious. Yeah, I don't either be careful. I well I'm, I'm asking a question. Okay. But be careful.


I'm It, this is what we do to learn. We ask be be Careful how you ask it. It's called the Socratic method. Okay. Max, Just be careful And now you're saying things that I don't know. Is It a good thing? Don't confuse it. It's All Greek. Max. Max. Is it a good thing Greeks Are just Italians who don't pay taxes? Max Fact, Is it a good thing? Would it be a good thing for your head of security to be coaching your football team? Yeah. I think So, if You, if the head of security is big, do Okay. Alright. That's all I wanna know's. All I wanna know. Did You guys see, by the way, when Fantasy Fuck Boys comes back, we had the lineup for the Staten Island Little League World Series team that's in Williamsport. I'll just give you a couple of the names. It's great. Okay. It's just fantasy fuck boys.


Central Latin batting. First is Vin Ru Ru Ruggiero. Yeah. How do you say that? Ruggiero. Ruggiero. Second is Steven Grippo. Peter Occhio. Steven Grips is is the catcher. We also have on the team. Dean SC Scar. Jello. Okay. Joe Achi, Dylan d Dega and Dylan Cat. Jason Ro Rocchi. I, I can't even, I can't speak Italian. Max. You gimme some Italian help here. ROCC. I have To look at The io. Lemme look at it. Rocio Rocio Rocio. Yeah. D Roach. Let me, I Ach j Jason Rocio J Roach.


No, you're saying it wrong. Dylan Deta is my favorite. Yeah, I like that. That's a good one. That's a good name. But yeah, there's a lot, lot of vows. Just be careful. Big fat. I'm talking about the Little League World Series and saying, fuck boys. Just saying, Your brain went there. That not, not anyone else's. We went, that's fucked up. Went Through it. Your brain is there in the League World Series. People don't talk about that enough. I think we talk About Max, you were in it. Right? Some a WL found the game that I played in and put the whole thing on YouTube. Love that. You know what I love about the Little League World series? I love the fact that it's, it's for the kids and they get the best umpires and they, they do it the right way at Williamsport. Yeah. I don't see that a lot these days. Agreed. And it's something that, and if, if you're in wholesome, we can all get behind.


If You're someone who just spends all day online yelling about the kids and the umpires. Maybe get a life. Yeah. You get a life. Although The, the one thing I never like about it though is the one coach that knows that he's doing something to go viral. Yeah. He knows that he's Mike. Yeah. He, he, they lose and then he brings 'em all and he is like, listen, look around. You guys are gonna love, you guys are gonna think it back to this moment for the rest of your lives. Like, no, they lost, they're out. No, I, I actually love that Rico just gets so fired up about Li League World Series and the umpires. Yeah. And the system. And The system. But yeah, that, that was good. What, what, before we do this game, what, what else do we have Anything else? If We're talking about quarterbacks being too good in practice.


Jayden Daniels threw five touchdowns in a row. That's Pretty good. But maybe too good. It might be too good. Yeah, it might be too good. He needs to learn how to throw better end zone interceptions. Yeah. We had, oh, there was one other thing. Oh, Jamis miked up was incredible. Jamis miked up is really good. I Just Love him the entire thing. Oh, just say him going up to his teammates and being like, I'm in your establishment now. Yeah, that was great. The US men's national team. We got our guy. Yeah, Tino. Yep. His name's Catino. He's Argentinian. He coached for Chelsea, coached for Tottenham. I think he got them to like the Champions League final or some shit like that. Surely He's won a lot. He's won. Yeah, he's won some where I think he came in like second place in the EPL.


He, he did win a, he did win the French League with PSG. Oh right. The Farmer League. When, when he had, He, he, he beat a bunch of Uber Eats delivery guys With Namar and Mbae and Messi. Yeah. Okay. So he has won. I assume that since he was, he was Pulisic coach when he was at Chelsea. I'm assuming that they asked Pulisic what he thought about the coach. And then Pulisic said he's a good guy. Then they brought him in, Which might not be the best thing. 'cause we gotta make our guys tougher. Well, apparently he Get beat up all the Time. I, I, I read up a little bit about this guy and he coaches using the theory of Gia Universal. Okay. Which means Universal energy. Love it. Max, did you get that Universal energy, which is basically he coaches on vibes.


I he thinks that every player either has good vibes or bad vibes. Hank would not last on this team. He would not. And he just, he, he has like this theory that it's all connected. It's all one song. I like that. So it's a very, it's a very different coach than what we had in the past. People were telling me last night that we're gonna score goals and we're gonna give up goals. And that's all I care about. If I can bet the over while watching the US men's national team and win, I don't give a fuck what ends up happening. We could lose every game if there's five goals He plays, I think his formation is some like 4 2, 3 3. I don't know. That probably doesn't add up to 12 or to 11. But I know that he plays a very aggressive style.


So let me ask you this question. PFD. Yeah. As our four more most soccer, international soccer guy, would you say this was a home run higher? Because I, In soccer terms, I feel like people were very upset or, or very excited. Like we got him. This is incredible. We never thought we'd get a guy like this In soccer terms. It's a grand slam. Okay. It's a grand slam. It's a touchdown. So I just want it on the record, if this is a grand slam touchdown of a hire and we don't get good at soccer. Yep. Could you make the argument our players are not good At soccer? Yes. Okay. Yeah. That now I'm excited. That's what I've been saying this time. Now I'm excited this entire time. And we, there have been times in the past when we've had shitty players.


I will, I will give you that. A hundred percent. There have been times when we've had decent players. Now we have, which should be the best players we've ever had. And which Is not a huge, It Doesn't mean they're good. They're good. Relatively speaking. I'm saying like in the world, they're not, they're still not good. Well, they Play on the best teams in the world. Meaningful minutes. Many of them ish. Many of them. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Not a lot of them. There are, there's like four or five guys that play significant minutes on really good teams. There's a lot of guys that are on good teams that don't play at all. And then there's a couple other guys that are still up and coming. But what I'm saying is, yes, in the past you've been a hundred percent right. US soccer has never been, I'm excited anywhere close to the top talent in the world.


Now they're, I wouldn't say that they're in the top five talent in the world. I would probably say top 10 in Terms of Okay. I'm, I'm just excited roster the test. I'm excited for the test. And Now that, that shithead Greg is out of the picture and he is not too busy getting in pissing matches with his players' dads to put it forth a, a good, a good lineup. I think, I think it's safe to say that this will be a big disappointment if we don't, I I think disappointment would be losing in the knockout round. I think that we need to win at least one knockout round game. I think we should get to the quarterfinals. So I'm just excited for the test now because we'll find out if this is a home run Grand Slam hire. We can't blame the home run Grand Slam hire.


We can't blame it on the coach. Correct. Yeah. He's going off. I'm excited for Universal Energy. I hope we're good. I want us to be good. It'd be awesome if we're good. I mean, the World Cup would be So exciting, but if we're bad, I'm going to be like, yeah, we're, we're never gonna Be good. And I think that would be, that would be valid at that point. Yeah. Okay. If we're bad, then it's like, then we're bad. Then it's like, why isn't Jalen Brown on this team? Yeah. This Is, this is exciting because I've always wanted to just get to the bottom of it. Like, should we actually invest money and time and resources as sports fans? Or are we just gonna be bad? I, yeah, we'll find out if we're good, then it's gonna be like, fuck yes. Let's go win a World Cup. I'm also interested To see, not saying we will, what This guy does in terms, because when you're the US soccer coach, you're in charge of a lot of shit. Not just coaching the team on the field.


You have responsibility in like developing the youth program. And in the past he's worked with like the government of different cities and, and parts of different countries to like get them to buy into his youth development program. So I don't know if this guy's gonna go across the United States and be like, Hey, we need to work on our youth development. I'm gonna meet with the mayor of like Chicago. I don't know if I'm gonna meet with the governor of Texas or whatever. But I'm curious to see. 'cause I think he's gonna be coaching for the most part, stationed overseas in Europe. Okay. Which is fine. Listen, we've tried it the other way before. Yeah. We just, and how's it work When he's, when he is here, he just needs to be here. He needs to be here to get all of them. So wait, is he keeping another job or is this his job now?


I think this is his job. Oh, love that. I don't think he's like a step coach. Good for him. Yeah. So Tino Smart move the bar's low. A European guy from, from Argentina. Hmm. That's interesting. Yeah. How'd you get down there? Dunno. Okay. Operation Paper. Let's Anything else are the Phillies Dead Max? They won last night. Okay, so they're back. Yeah. I just know they've been struggling. They were struggling. And then Schwarber had a grand slam to save the season. The NBA schedule came out. I saw that. Yeah. It opens up with Nicks and Celtics. It's talking basketball. That's about it. What off season? No, off season for us.


Sixers play the Celtics on Christmas day. Oh, That's, that's such a gift. That was, that was the number one thing that I, I saw, I saw the Bulls have two nationally televised games total. I think one of 'em is against the Hornets on a Friday night at like 10:00 PM That's sick. Is that, is that the NBA cup though? It might be. I don't know. No, that's in mid-November. mid-November. Yeah. So, oh, and then also if there's any Notre Dame swimmers listening to this right now, we'll hire you. Yeah. They started a, a legal gambling ring. I, I read about that. What's, what's the problem here? I don't know, but I just know that like us having Barstow having its own swimming team, that we just challenge other people.


Like when we get in Beefs online, just like, you know what, let's, let's, let's finish this in the pool. Your Fastest guy. The, and we just have like a Harlem Globe Trotter Zest team. We just bring 'em out there against Guys that can't really swim. Yeah. Yeah. The Washington Generals of Swimming, let's finish This. Like men, let's finish it in the Pool. There would be a lot of deaths if, if that was an actual format. But I read about it. They had like an internal pool, for lack of a better term, like an internal gambling ring. Okay. I'm confused. Where they would bet on where they would bet on themselves and bet like amongst themselves, who's gonna finish better? And what, that's Just Fun. That's just dudes. Yeah. What, what's the problem There? That's cra If. you do that then that means there's a lot of teams that would have that issue.


Yeah, Because that's, It's classic Notre Dame though, to be like, we uncovered it. Just wanted once raise our hand and say, we found a dicey gambling operation amongst our swimming team. So we're gonna shut it down. Yeah. Thank us. Later. Get in front of this. This is Notre Dame. Get in Front of this. Alright, let's do, let's, let's get, let's get ourselves ready for, for some football. Let's, before we do this, we are going to give a couple picks. So with DraftKings you can bet on all the preseason stuff. Now I, we, we we're thinking about prop picks. So we're gonna throw a couple out there. We, which one are you gonna pick? I'm gonna do rushing touchdowns. Okay. And Max, which one are you gonna do? I'm gonna do passing touchdowns. I had Receiver. Okay, perfect.


So Max, you wanna start? Who's your, who's your most receiving yards? I'm trying to get the on DraftKings. I'm trying To get the odds for All right, then I'll start. Yeah, I'm gonna go passing touchdowns. I know that some people might say, oh, sophomore slump. CJ Stroud plus nine 50. I like it. I mean, Stefan Diggs, Nico Hollands Tank Dell. A Tank Dell. That offense is gonna be explosive. I actually saw a picture, someone, it was like a meme And. it was CJ Straub with those three guys standing on the sidelines, like, who's gonna stop them? And I wanted, I didn't, but I wanted to just circle Stefan Diggs and be like, that's that's who, he's the guy when he doesn't get the ball.


That's exactly who. Yeah. Yeah. You're gonna have to keep him happy. Yeah. He's plus nine 50. Mahomes and Dak Prescott are the two favorites. So little value plus nine 50. I think CJ Stroud's gonna fucking rock this year. I like that. Yeah. It's a good pick. Good value. Okay. What do you have? So for mine, I'm going to go with rushing touchdown leader Brie Hall. Ooh. Brie Hall. I, I just lost the odds. I think it's plus 1800. Plus 1900. Whoa. Something like that. And my reasoning behind it is Aaron Rogers should play more than five snaps this year. Right. Memes should A memes is strapping a what to himself.


Yeah. What are you gonna do? Memes? Yeah. I'm gonna Blow myself up. Where? NFL headquarters. Oh. Patrick Beverly not expected to sign with the NFL, but I like Bri Hall because the first year with Nathaniel Hackett, that air Aaron Jones had in Green Bay, I think he had 16 rushing touchdowns. Mm. Nice. And I feel like Nathaniel Hackett's gonna get him the ball inside the five I do. They have a touchdown vulture. Yeah. Braylin Allen or no, B Braylin Allen is on. Yeah. Bra Allen Jet. Yeah. Bra Allen. Braylin Allen is, He's 19 years old and he's actually exactly who they'll use the goal. He actually looked really good. Fuck. He looked really good against. I don't care. I like Bri. Saul, Bri Sas a good player.


And Izzy's not knocking on the door this year. Jalen Hertz at 15 to one isn't crazy Now Sequan Will dip into that. No, Big Cat. He is sequan. And also he throws too many touchdowns now. Yeah, it's true. He won't be rushing. That's a good point. And the tush push. Who knows what's gonna happen with no Kelsey. That's very true. It's What do you have, max? It's Funny that, it's funny that PFT went pretty hall. 'cause I'm going Garrett Wilson. Oh, at 14 to one. All right. We're high on the jets. Yeah. Garrett Wilson has had a really good, he hasn't been a big touchdown guy, but he is never really had a big a quarterback like Aaron Rogers. I think that that's good value. He could blow up this year. Okay, I'll change mine to Aaron Rogers. 16 To one. Rogers.


Let's go Jet. Alright. Aaron Rogers 16 to one. That's actually not a bad pick. Big Cat. I, I kinda like that pick. He's gonna feast against the Patriots. Yeah. He's, and he's, they're gonna do the perfect amount of handing the ball off in the goal line. Yep. And throwing it Jets might score a billion touchdowns. Has that ever happened?

I wrote The rest of me Is, is is Silence of the Lambs a sequel Kind Of. Brian Cox played Hannibal Lecter. I think it kind of is. I think Man Hunter was a prequel that came out. I don't know. I get the timeline. No, There's Red Dragon, which is awesome. I Read an article That was, and there's a Hannibal two, which was not great. And then there's a Hannibal four, I wanna say that was okay. I read an article about how Brian Cox worked on Super Troopers And.


it was like they offered it to Bill Murray, then he turned it down. Brian Cox read it. He was like, I always kind of wanted to do comedy. And then I played Hannibal Lecter and my whole career changed. And I was like, wait, Brian Cox played Hannibal. Yeah. That, that was Manhunter. Yeah. So, But that was before Silence of Lambs. Yeah. Yeah. Mean that Hannibal Lecter Was, silence of Lambs is a sequel. It Was played by two different people. I don't, I don't know if they call it a sequel in like the classic sense of it, but Yeah. It's like in the same universe. Yeah. One of my favorite. You Don't need to see Manhunter to see Lan. Correct. Right. And you don't need to see Red Dragon or you don't need to see Lan.

One of my favorite quotes of all time from a movie. But I feel like it wouldn't have really played in the graphic And. It's also, I mean, Roadhouse is a popular movie, but I used to fuck guys like you in prison, which was an ad-lib, like, like quote. It wasn't on the script because it still makes no sense. You just, he was, he had him in a choke hold. He said, I used to fuck guys like you in prison. So he is just saying that he fucked My, my favorite quote guy Cole threw it.

Okay. We now welcome on a very, very special guest. It is Los Angeles Chargers Khalil Mack. Wish he was still a bear. This is our Grit Week interviews presented by Coors Light. So Cleal, first of all, thank you for joining us. First question, same question we ask everyone on Grit Week. Yeah. How do you define grit? Oh, man, it's a, it's a badass, tough motherfucker willing to do anything to, to help the team win. Okay. Yeah. That's a good answer. You a badass, tough motherfucker. I mean, it is, it should be obvious. I shouldn't have to tell you. Yeah. Have you, I want it to be obvious with my actions on the field, not just speaking on it.


You Know, I'm, yeah. I would say you are a true badass motherfucker. Doesn't have to say they are. Everyone just knows. I want you to say it for me. Yeah, You are. You are a true badass. You can redo The intro If. you want. We're joined by a very special guest. Khalil Mack. A true badass motherfucker. Yes. Thank you. That sounds good. That sound Cool. So, Khalil, I did, I I talked to you a little yesterday. I, I wish you were still a bear, but we're excited to have you on. Yeah, I, I'm happy that you're doing well with the Chargers. You had, how many sacks do you have last year? 17 and a half. Jeez. 17 and a half. You're old. 17. Maybe. 17. I should have actually introed it differently. Future hall of famer. I appreciate that. Have you, have you thought in your head like the number of sacks you want to get to?


'cause you're over a hundred. Yeah. You're getting into that territory where it's like, these are some real dudes up here. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have a number in your head? Definitely don't have a number in my head. I, the only number my head in my head was the hundred. Knowing I can get to that was pretty cool last year. But from now on, it's just going out and playing ball. Yeah. And it, it's crazy that you got to a hundred sacks with, for people who don't know your story with football, you only played one year of high school football, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. So there's a whole alternate world where you don't get hurt playing basketball in high school. Yeah. And you never play football. Low key. Yeah. Yep. That's crazy. I probably crazy be a physical trainer or something, or, yeah.


That's nuts. Athletic trainer. Yeah. So was a, it was a knee injury. Yeah. Yeah. Patella patella. You tore your patella. Yeah. And then you came back and you became one of the most explosive football players in the world. Yeah. Man. Yeah. That's pretty cool. God is good. God is amazing, man. So, so when you switched to football, 'cause you were, you know, obviously you were thinking, all right, basketball, I'm gonna get a scholarship. You have one year of high school football. Were you like, this might be the end for me. Like I, unless like I have to play out and then hope that something falls in my lap here. Yeah. Low key man. But the first day we put pads on my, my head coach at the time at, in high school, his name is Waiters Ashman. He said, he said after, after the, after the paddy practice, he was like, I might be able to get you a scholarship man.


Wow. And that might be turned into a, a offer from Liberty University. And then that, that changed. That changed into a offer from university at Buffalo. Yeah. So that was first day. He was like, oh yeah, you might be a scholarship guy. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Yeah. That's Crazy. That's awesome. So you go from Florida. Yeah. You grow up in Florida and then you go up to Buffalo. Yeah. We love Buffalo. Buffalo's A great city. Yeah. I love Buffalo too. Great people up there. But the first time you got to really experience the cold in Buffalo as a, as a guy from Florida. Yeah. What was that like? Man, it was life changing man. I, I think I had my biggest winter coat on the first day of maybe like 50 degrees. And everybody was looking at me like, why you got your, your your biggest, I think it called, called Burlington Coat Factory.


My pop took me to Burlington Coat Factory to get me the big jacket. And I had it on thinking that was the, the coldest it was gonna get. But when it got to negative 10 and five, it, it, it was definitely life changing. Yeah. And at Buffalo you were insane. Yeah. First team all American in the Mac, which is hard to do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What, at what point in your career at Buffalo could you tell, like, not that the game was easy for you, but you were clearly just so much better than everyone else on the field? Man, I remember the first day of Pad at practice going against the tight end at the time was a guy named Jesse Rack. I think he was probably like a decorated guy as well in the Mac conference.


And I remember whooping him pretty, pretty good. Not, not shout out to Jesse, no, no offense. But Jesse just sitting in his whoop pretty good. And then going against a another guy and James Starks and him instilling that confidence in me. Like, man, you, you, you can ball bro. Yeah. And once I heard it from him and seeing him go on to the Green Bay and do what he did his first year in the league and win the Super Bowl and all those different things, it, it kind of helped my confidence. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And then going to the draft process, I know GMs they, they like to get real weird with it. They like to figure out like if a guy's mentally tough enough. Yeah. Especially if they come from a small school, right?


Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like maybe all your physical stuff is out there and they measure it and they're like, yeah. It fits the profile. Yeah. But when they're talking to you, were they like, were they trying to fuck with you a little bit? Like knock you off balance in the interviews? I feel like the only interview I had that ended up being like, the funniest one because that's the team that drafted me was, was, was with the Raiders. And so talking to them, it was definitely funny in a sense that they would try to get a feeling, a feel for the type of person I was just from the like 15 minute conversation at the time. But it wasn't so much of them trying to figure out if I was tough. 'cause I feel like they can already tell. But just seeing the demeanor that I have off the field versus the one I have on the field is kind of two different things.


Yeah. Did you, did you talk to Mark Davis in that interview process? Not Mark Davis. I just remember talking to Reggie McKenzie and all the guys that were under him at the time. And Yeah. I didn't get a chance to talk to Mark. No, Because Mark, he, he's a hero of ours. I know you probably have your differences with the whole contract. No, No. Nah. It's all love. It's still all love from, from Mark. But the Gruden, the group, the, the, the Gruden guy is the guy that I probably had the, the biggest issue with. Yeah. That, that was weird. Right. Because I, I remember the contract negotiation. 'cause you were first team all pro and, and was it, was it Oakland at the time? Or was it Vegas? Man, I, I really can't remember what, what year was maybe it was, was it 18? 2018 at the, I was embarrassed in 18.


Yeah. Yeah. So, so I know you had your differences with the organization, but Gruden was coming in And. it felt like that contract negotiating just kept getting dragged out and dragged out. Yeah. It's like, when is this gonna happen? Is it gonna happen? Yeah. And then you get traded. Yeah. And Gruden says that you didn't want to be there. Yeah. But you never talked to Gruden. Exactly. Have you Talked to him yet? Man, I talked to him a few times since then. A few supposed to be private conversations, but one of 'em was, ah, you motherfuckers won. Motherfuckers won the, the, the, the trade or whatever at the time. And I knew we were gonna play Oakland that next year after my 18 that year in 18 with the Bear.


I think we was gonna play him in London. He was like, I'm gonna send the house at your ass whenever we play. And that motherfucker, he really did. So yeah, it was funny. It was funny just interacting with 'em over the phone and kind of squashing the beef, but not really. Yeah. 'cause it always gonna be that same, that same feeling every time. I see those colors on the other side. Yeah. Use it to motivate you. Yeah. I had another question about your draft process. How much do you think your helmet, your face mask helped you get drafted so high? Because that was the coolest face mask ever. The one you wanted wore at Buffalo? Yeah, man, I wanted to wear it. You looked like Bain. Yeah. I wanted to wear it in the league. I thought Ray Lewis probably wore maybe the year before. Yeah. Or two years, or three years before I too Justin Tuck was wearing it.


And then they changed the rules soon as I soon as I got to the league. And so maybe that did help. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was the coolest thing ever. I also read a story. I, I I wonder If you can If you remember this? I read a story that you were so dominant in practice at Buffalo that they would make you line up like five yards off of the line because they were like, the offense can't get their plays off. Nah, that ain't True, man. Okay. They never did that. That's, that's funny man. Okay. And then the other one, the other story I read, which was crazy, I guess there was a, a pass rush where you one arm hit the tackle Yeah. And he was falling into the quarterback. Yeah. And then you grabbed the tackle and basically picked him back up so he didn't fall into the quarterback.


Man, I think I'm still doing that shit, bro. That's great. Yeah. He said they watched it after like, what the hell, just like the quarterback, the story I read the quarterback watched it after him was like, CLIL Max saved my life. 'cause you, you, you basically threw him in the air. Yeah. And then as he was falling, you grabbed him and pulled him Back. It's some quarterbacks that's been on the, the wrong end of that. I think Eli, I think I called Eli. I, I wasn't trying to do it, but it just so happened it happened that way. I think Eli was the only guy I probably got like that. Just throwing someone else into him. Yeah. Throw Well, yeah, were your best move. Him and Kirk Cousins maybe. Yeah, That's, yeah. Those two checkout for guys that would get sacked. Like that your best sack of all time was when you sacked Aaron Rogers with your ass.


Yeah. That was awesome. You, you, it was the ass sack That was, and you Forced the fumble, Right? I thought they called it the back, the back sack. No, the Match that ass up. Yeah. Was that the week one game? It was a great sack. No, I don't think it was week one was Like the game sucked. That one when they came Back was NFC. When we, when we clinched the NC Yeah. At The end of the season. NC north. Yeah. The end of the season. Yeah. But in the play, you can watch it back and you realize, oh, I'm not gonna be able to turn around. I'm just gonna stick my ass and your ass force to fumble. Man, You talking my, I Mean, it's True. I knew, I knew he was somewhere back there. I I was trying to grab, grab at the ball and so Yeah. Whatever, whatever. By any means I was trying to get that motherfucker, man.


Yeah. Yeah. I I I, I do have to bring up a bad memory, the double Don, but I want to talk about the 2018 Bears because that defense was so much fun to watch. Yeah. Man. At what point in the season were you like, this is a different, like, 'cause I thought, you know, if If you beat the Eagles, like the sky's the limit with the way the defense was playing. Yeah, man. Yep. Yep. Man, man, bringing back memory, it's like a mug man. The first day there, man, I, I kind of just got a feel for the guys knowing that Kyle Fuller was there. I I knew you had a ball on the outside, but I didn't know a lot about Prince and Muca Moore. Yep. But sitting down talking with him and then figuring out that this, he can press off the line and all these different things.


And I didn't even know this young guy, Eddie Jackson was in the back end ready to catch the ball and score at any moment. Yep. A Team Hicks. Yeah. Along with Amos and Hicks. And, and then you got two guys, a guy that just got drafted in Quan Smith at the time and, and Danny Reva in the middle. Yep. And then Akeem and Eddie Goldman and, and Leonard Floyd on the outside. So it was like, I didn't know I was coming into this because I didn't, I really didn't know a lot about the Bears organization before I went. I think I, I made a joke and, and said I I met like the whole McCaskey family and had no clue who was who.


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was, it was like a, a real like big shock in the culture of like, just seeing how big that family was and how much that team meant to the city of Chicago. Yeah. Yeah. And that double Don, how long did it take you to man, people still just like spam it in my replies on Twitter all the time. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a bit delusional because it's like, at the time I was thinking, man, it it, it won't be so bad. Me, we can keep this, this group together. Yeah. We can come back next year and have another shot. Yeah. And that's, that's what I immediately fixed my mind to. But as time goes on, you feel it more. And, and just the understanding of, damn, that was, that was a rare opportunity right there man to, to really do what I want to do before I, I hang him up When Yeah.


Do you think it was maybe a mistake the next season started with Matt Nay doing, ending every practice with kickers kicking from that spot? Oh Man, I see. I don't, I I I don't know that. I didn't even know that. Yeah. Yeah. You tried to like exercise the demon. We're gonna, all that does it just puts it right back in your head. Yeah. I mean, it is a crazy play. Yeah. Double dunk. And You guys were so good. Like I, I know that I'm obviously very biased and everyone laughs at the Bears and we're a, a joke and all that stuff. But that team was playing like, I remember the, the, the game that I think about in that season Yeah. Was when the Rams who end up went going to the Super Bowl that year Yeah. Come with their offense to Soldier Field. Yeah. And I think you guys didn't even let them score a touchdown.


No. Just absolutely demolished them. Yeah. And I was like, this is different. Yeah. Yeah, man. Nah, that was, that was a special group man. And, and also with, with Coach Vick Fangio, man, just the mastermind behind him as a whole and him understanding the players that he had and, and making sure before the week we were prepared and knew what we were gonna do and everything was just gonna be, we, we, we expected to dominate the teams that we win against. And so Yeah. Man, shout out to them, man. Yeah. I, I definitely miss that group. Yeah. Do you miss bare weather at all? Nah, I, I don't miss the winter. I don't miss the winter time, but I, IIII miss like, the fall end, the fall seasons and all those different things, man, Chicago's a beautiful city man.


I, I moved from Glenco to down to like the, what they call that? The golden, the Golden Coast Triangle. Oh Yeah. Yeah. The Viagra Triangle or the Gold Coast. You know what the Triangle? Yeah. Yeah. You know it. Hey. But yeah, I'm Still a little young for that. I gotta, I gotta wait till my dick stops working. Well sometimes I didn't even know we could talk like this. We can talk like this. Yeah. We talk whatever you want. Yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. Any questions about our dick? No. Hell. Okay. Alright. Well If you if they come up, if it comes up naturally, we're happy to address. Listen, guys need to be able to talk to each other like this. It's all good. Guys can talk to. It's fine. By the way. So you mentioned, you mentioned your, where you're living. It's not really that good. We, we have to, we have to bring, I told you this yesterday, we have to put to bed the Halloween, the famous Halloween story.


Oh yeah. Yeah. Yep. Because the media ran with it. Yeah. That kil m hates kids. Khalil. Mack hates Halloween. Yeah. What was that? He shut down his house. Yeah. For Halloween. Turned off the lights, had had a security out front. What happened? Man? So what happened was my, some, some, some type of way my address was on the news in Chicago. Okay. And I just had random people just randomly coming up to my house for probably like a week before, before Halloween even came about. And so talk, talking to my guy, tar, I don't know If, you know John Tar? Yeah. And my guy Tar. I'm like, tarp man, I don't really feel too safe right now. I'm trying to figure out this, the Chicago media system.


Like they can just put your house on online. Yeah. On the news. He's like, man, trust me, it's different, but we'll figure it out. And I'm like, okay. Bet before Halloween we gonna have to figure something out. 'cause I know it's probably gonna be a lot of traffic coming through here and I wanna make sure everything good at the house. Yeah. And he was like, okay, bet we can set something up. And so he just so happened to have one of the security from the team to sit outside to make sure it wasn't anybody really trying to just Yeah. Break in. Yeah. For, for, for so for, for so much of the, for so much of the word, for the, for the turns. But yeah. And at the time, I, I don't think I had my gate up yet.


I think it was partially up maybe. Yeah. I feel like it was like partially up and the entrances were like, no gates. Yeah. And it looked, it looked a little awkward, but at the time I didn't have any candy. I, I just moved in. I I don't think I had a bed at the time. For real. And so it was one of those things. It wasn't. So for the record, Khalil Mack does not hate Halloween. Yeah. And Khalil Mack is for The kids. I don't celebrate. I personally don't celebrate. Oh. So you might hate Halloween. You might hate Halloween. No, I don't celebrate it. Okay. I don't Celebrate. Why don't you celebrate It? I don't celebrate it 'cause of my beliefs. Okay. Oh, all right. All right. So, but do you, are you for the kids? Oh yeah, I'm for the kids man.


Okay. Absolutely. Absolutely. I just wasn't for, you know, your dress Getting leaked. I agree with that. Yeah. That was, yeah. That's crazy. That was new. That was new for me. Coming from, coming from San Ramon, California And. it was, it wasn't that intense. Yeah. Okay. That's fair. So if a kid comes up to you not on Halloween, different day dressed in a, a costume and they're like, Mr. Mack, Mr. Mack, can I have some candy? Please? Mr. Mack, would you give that child candy? You have a bag, you have a full candy In your pocket? Do I got a Absolutely. Okay. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Good. Y'all seem y'all Halloween guys. Yeah. Really? I like candy. You like candy? Yeah. Yeah. What kind of candy do you like? I like of it. So my, my favorites are like Sour Patch kids.


Oh, sour Patch. My wife, I like Three Musketeers a lot. I like Twix. I like Reese's Peanut butter cups. We Too, I like ese. We saw it down in, I think was the linebacker's room. There's just two boxes full of candy. Yeah. They said that that wasn't yours though. Nah, Nah, nah. Does Coach Ben Herbert know about that? Man, I, I hope not. Yeah. I hope not. He'll kick your ass. I hope not. You, I think I seen a picture of you doing the neck. Neck. Yeah. Yeah. How strong was your neck when he, did he test your neck? Oh man, I did. He tested your neck? Yeah, He tested our necks. How did, what, what test did he do? He, he put us through a neck workout. Yeah. He, he put us just pushed on Our head. Oh Yeah. He put his hand on the back of my head and then gave me a neck workout. Do you, do you think he's made you harder to break?


I mean, that's literally what he did. Yeah. No, the pictures weren't great for us. They were Not great. But my neck is so sore this morning. Yeah. My neck is very Sore. My, my jaw too. For some Reason I was working hard, real hard. Your jaw too. That's a different thing though. That's unrelated. Do you think he's made you harder to break, Man? Absolutely. Man, coach, coach Herb man. He's smart dude. Intense. Yeah. You know, he try to, you know, he come off as intimidating to some people, but I like, I like, I like that energy, man. Yeah. He almost come off like one, like one of the fullbacks that's that's a little throw off in the head. Yeah. Yeah. That's gonna try to knock your head off. But yeah, he a good dude, man. And he understands the, the body man Start from Wait, so what position group is the craziest on a football team?


Like what room is like don't fuck with those guys. Crazy. In what sense? Like crazy. In like what sense? What sense of the word? Like they're a little off. Like mentally they're a little off. They gotta be a little off to play that position. Maybe it's d-line. So can we do a top five? Yeah. All right. So crazy in the sense of the word. So Yeah. You'll have to, you'll you, ideally you want your D-line to be a little off, A little off throw off, off. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You want them to Yeah. Just get mad at nothing. Yeah. Then you want your linebackers. Yep. Whether it is edge or inside. And then you want what? You want your oline. Yep. You want your o line. I I low key. I prefer the O line to be at the top of that list.


Yeah. But nowadays it don't seem like it's a lot of like crazy Oly o linemen. They seem like they got a lot of sense. Yeah. Yeah. But, But like back Richie and Kto. Yeah. Go back. Yeah. You want, you want Richie Andto, You know Rich. Yeah, yeah. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That type vibe nowadays. So I put them three. Who else you got? I mean, I would assume you want defensive backs to be a little crazy. 'cause they have to have Confidence. You want them to be cra but you want them to be a little, a little, you want 'em to be a controlled, kind of a controlled aggression. Like you don't want them like a safety maybe. Yeah. You want your safety to be a little throw off. Like dur durwin. Durwin definitely got a little, he got a little, he got a little bit to him.


Yeah. He scares me. I Like that he one of those like, that'll knock your head off. But Yeah, you, you could say dbs, but I, I wanna put the who, who I wanna put in there running back. I wanna put your Yeah. Your running back. Full back, running back. Full back room in there. Yeah. You Gotta have the crazy Kickers and then last. Yeah. I think, yeah. I, I think the kicker gotta gotta be like a different type of crazy like delusional type of Yeah. Like doesn't wanna talk To anymore. I could kick this from 70, 60 type. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's the cold. Yeah. I don't even know what a goal post is. Yeah, exactly. Windy City. What? Like what, what, what a I don't care about the wind. If it's going this way, I'm kick it. Yeah. So it's like that type of crazy Yeah. Yeah. Like Janowski. Yeah. Yes.


That's my guy. That was, That's my guy. What was it like meeting him for the first time? Man, It was unique man. I did not know. I did not know what type of dude I was going to actually meet. I thought he was like an older guy, but Jano was like super cool and laid back and Yeah. He'll have some something to drink for you in the back of the plane. If. you want If you wanted some, talked To you about Poland? Yeah. All the culture. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Polish culture. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Yeah. I remember they brought him out one time to try a 76 yard field goal going in a halftime. No, He made it. I don't think he made that one. I think that one landed like a little bit short because like 76 yards. That's bro. That's crazy long. Listen, That, that was the only kick I knew that was built like a, I don't even know.


Like a old line. Like a Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Yeah. How, how, how far do you throw football? I'd say maybe 67 yards. I heard that you have an unreal arm, but you, so you played quarterback when you were a kid and your problem was you couldn't throw short passes. No. No. That's fake. Yeah, that's fake. Yeah. I don't know what else. Yeah, That's, you had good touch. That's what I read. I Could, I could throw, I could throw a decent ball, But I mean, 67 yards. That's pretty good. Like, Why aren't we using you a trick place? I mean, we had a play in Chicago, man, I don't think we had a chance to run it. It was like Santa's, well, nah, Santa's Rain Day. I think that was for Keem. It was something, it was something like along in a, with a Christmas vibe with Nay. Okay. But we never got a chance to run it.


It was almost like the Derrick Henry play. Okay. So you were gonna get the, you were gonna get, Get the ball, hit it off and throw it it, yeah. Jump and throw it. Yeah. Yeah. Shit. That would've been awesome. Yep. Yep. Matt Eggy was like looking down his play sheet and said Bu and he was like, ah, I can't call the fun play. I Need that. That's not me. I need that play. Nah, he definitely will call him. But we, later on we went in situations where we can play around too much. Tell, tell Coach Harbaugh put something in for you. I mean, I, I would hope so, but Yeah, I feel like, I feel like he would do it. So you, you're just getting to like know him obviously. 'cause he is still relatively new relationship with you guys here. We love Coach Harbaugh. Yeah. He's like a brutally honest guy. Oh yeah. And he's a football guy through and through. Yeah.


So I, I imagine that the two of you kind of get along as a veteran. It seems like that's the kind of guy that you could Oh yeah. Identify or not identify, but be like, I respect this guy because I've been around the business long enough to know that you want a guy that will give me bad news or tell me I'm not doing something right. Yeah. Yeah. And be direct with me. Absolutely, man. Yeah, absolutely. And that's from top to bottom, man. You can tell whenever he speaks in front of the team, it's like he's going to whatever is on that paper for him to talk about. He's not going to hold back from it. Whether somebody's late or somebody ain't doing whatever they supposed to do, he's gonna let it be known. And that's the directness and that's the, that's the, the football ness of, of who he is. Yeah. He always says the human body craves contact, which I think is true.


Yeah. Yeah. But maybe not like as a veteran, maybe you get back to training camp and you're like, I don't really miss training camp. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean for for, for the lack of the lack of what? The lack of the meetings. But the game, the love of the game, man, I love coming out on the practice field, but the talking about football all day and, and putting it in, in terms and all that, it's like, huh. I could do without that part. Let me do, do the fun part. We go play on Sundays. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we, we had Dallas Godard on last year, tight end for the Eagles. And he played at a small school, not like Buffalo Buffalo's plays in a real conference. They played north. I appreciate that. That was my first time here.


South Dakota Free, something like that. Yeah. And He told a story about how when he was playing against these guys, like he would go out and the DBS would be like, can you take it easy on us? Because you're that much bigger and stronger. Did you ever have a moment like that in the Mac where maybe not take it easy on us, but it's like the guy, you're beating up the guys so bad they're just like, this is this, I'm going to be an accountant next year. I don't want to, I don't wanna play against you anymore. Man. I I I had a weird moment. I wouldn't say it was to that extent. It was definitely like a moment of like, what the, what the fuck this dude just saying? Yeah. but it was my University of Ohio. Ohio. Ohio. Ohio. Yeah. Oh no, it was Ohio University.


Ohio University. Yeah, Bob. Yeah, yeah. The Bobcat. Yeah. Yeah. And so it was maybe like a guard or a tackle And. it was like, man, can we take a pitch after the game? And I feel like it might like be like the second quarter at the time. I'm like, what? Fuck, what's going on? He was trying to kill your kindness. Yeah. It was like, ah, that's weird. Yeah. That was a weird moment. But other than that, I don't think I had too many. Yeah. Yeah. but it had to feel at times. It's like no one can stop me. Oh man. That was my mindset. That's been my mindset my whole career, man. Be a grown man amongst boys. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yeah, Me Too. So is is it still that way?


Like are there times when, when the game feels easy to you? Man, last year, man, it was, it, it got a lot easier just switching my mindset, being around guys like Joey and, and my coach at the time, gift Smith. Just learning new things, learning new nuances and things to put into my game. It simplified it that much more. And that's, that's where I feel like you can always get better. If you getting better or you getting worse. Yeah. So we might be dumb because we watch the games on a, on a couch on Sundays. Yeah. Which we watch all the games at the same time, which is hard to do. Yeah. You've never done that before. We do it every week, but we sit there, we watch and then we come up with these theories and we were watching the Chargers last year and Brandon Staley obviously he, he liked to mix it up on fourth down on offense a lot.


Yeah. And at times we were like, I don't know that I would like playing defense even though he's a defensive coach. Yeah. I don't know that I'd like playing defense in that system because you never know when you're gonna get back out, out on the field. Like Yeah. You don't get that much time to rest. Yeah. Was that a conversation that you guys had with Coach, which is like, let us, let us take a break sometimes. That's, That's where the, that's where the crazy and the de delusion come in because it was like, man, I'm riding, I'm riding with you coach, whatever you decide, you know what I'm saying? I know the offense going to convert on fourth down and if they don't, it's another chance for us to go out there and kick they ass. That's always been my mindset, whether they turn the ball over Oh, back. It's another opportunity to go out there and kick their ass. Yeah. And so that's where the delusion turns on when you on the field.


That's Where we're wired Different. I, yeah. Future Hall of Fame NFL players where we're, we watch and we're like, dude, we just wanna rest. Like, And, and if you're gonna make me, if you're gonna make me go out there, don't send me back out on the 35 yard. I'm gonna give up a touchdown. Yeah. Like Make them have to work for it. Like let, let some clock tick away here, coach. Yeah, exactly. Oh man. So let us chill for a minute. That's funny, man. Chilling. Seems fun. Well, Cleal, this has been awesome. I have one last question. It's a chevy.com question. Go to Chevy right now. Chevy Silverado. Best truck ever. You are not much on social media, right? Nah, Nothing. So do you ever see like, any like, crazy fans, like on social media for you?


Or is is it ever weird you out? Weird in what sense? Like is a like Well, I, I, I searched. I, I was like trying to find the weirdest tweets and I have a couple album. I'm really, yeah. You could tell me if this is is weird. Someone treated I fucking love you. Khalil Mack. Khalil Mack is my whole life. I die for Khalil. Mack. Whoa. That for the record, I don't want to die. But if Khalil Mack was like, Hey, you have to die, that I, so that I can live, I'd do it. Like that stuff's weird, right? That that's weird. Really weird. Those are all my tweets. Yeah. I mean, I love you. I know what, say, say my guy Cat appreciate I literally If you, If you had said in that 2018 If you like, I was not threatening you to say that, man.

I got a few more things going on than just you. I believe it, bro. I believe it. So Do I, man. Damn cat. That's funny, man. But for the record, if somebody ever, god forbid If, you ever find yourself in a life or death situation, just tell 'em, Hey, go kill Big Cat. Yeah, Right. I'll take it. I'll take it. Even though you're not on the Bears anymore, I, I'll still take It. No, man. It's all love, man. I appreciate, I definitely appreciate you guys having me on, man. Yes, yes. This has been awesome. Definitely Been a cool experience.

Maybe I'll actually think about this. What This would be the greatest Hall of Fame speech ever. I get up and I'm like, I'm now presenting Cleal Mack. And then boom, shoot myself in the head. Oh, come on bro. You tell me that people wouldn't remember that Most memorable Hall of Fame induction Ever. Come on, man. I might get some blood on the gold jacket. That might not be good.

Be, Be beautiful. I think. Like I do have one last, last question for you, because I read somewhere, I don't know if this is true or not.

I don't even know a Han. I don't. Is that the Bob? Yeah. That sounds like you know him. That might be the only song. Yeah, they got, they got more songs. Yeah, But no, it's just Umba. What's the last time Remix? Like Old Town Road? It's Been a minute. Okay. It's been a minute. It's been a minute. Might need re refresh. I listen to it on purpose or just listen to it. Listen to it on purpose. No, I don't, I don't think I listened to it on purpose. But you, you taught yourself guitar, right? Yeah, I tried, man, till my, till my finger got stuck in somebody Hillman and Yeah. That Sucks. That thing is gnarly.


Damn. You want my Finger? I'll give you mine. Yeah. Sound. You sound like Joey, Dude, That Lemme see your finger real quick. Yeah, That would actually be good for guitar. Really? Yeah. No, hell no.

It was all done with the help of Silverado. This year, Silverado was out west with us for our latest grit week, driving to the ocean to go surfing, driving back, it was a pleasure.

And now here is Los Angeles Chargers Strength and Conditioning coach Ben Herbert. And now for something completely different. Okay, we welcome. On a very, very special guest. It is our Grit Week, presented by Coors Light. It is Executive director of Player performance for the Los Angeles Chargers. Coach Ben Herbert. Coach Herbs. Can we call you Coach Herbs? Please Do. Okay. That's what, yeah. 99.99% of people. It's Herb or Coach Herb. Okay. So love it. So we, we gotta start grit week off with the first questions. The easy question, how would you define grit?


Your ability and willingness to do any and all things regardless of circumstance. That's a great answer. Okay. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. I love that word. And, and most, most importantly, what it represents to me. It's, it's pretty clear. Yeah. That's, that's how I see it. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's, that's concise. That's to the point. Makes sense. How do you instill grit in somebody? Or is it so something that you have? You know what, I think certain people in their upbringing and their exposures in life, they get exposed to, to some things that require more of it and, and nurture the development of it.


But I definitely believe it is something that can be developed through exposure. And the best thing is it doesn't have to be like a, like I just think daily exposure in small doses. Some days in, in, you know, bigger doses. But just that repeated exposure, you know, and as someone's development of it, you know, starts to blossom. And then for me, you just re encourage when you see it and you see guys display it or you see a group display it. And I love to just reinforce like, that's what it looks like. That's Grit. That's what it feels like. Please show me more of that. Wow. That's, Are those the words you use that?


Yeah, yeah. Along those lines. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. I, so I gotta say, I, I was, I was doing a little research for this interview and I watched a clip of Coach Harbaugh talking about the first time he met you and how he had to avert his gaze because you locked in and saw through his soul. So I was prepped for the handshake, but even even prepping myself for the handshake, you gave me a look through my soul and I had to look away. So what is that? You just can look through someone's soul. No, you're doing It right now. I mean, I dunno what you're doing. You're doing it Right now. The key for me, eye contact is powerful. You know, I have two boys who are 10 and 13, as soon as they could really comprehend, you know, shaking a another man's hand or shaking anyone's hand for that matter.


And in the eye contact, there's just something about the eyes. And when you're not accustomed to looking into someone's eyes when you communicate with them is very uncomfortable. Yeah. However you can learn and you can develop that as well. And you know, I always tell guys I'm not interested in like, trying to be this tough guy, like, stare at you or, you know, but I eye contact. I'm not interested in running away Right. With my eyes. I can't move physically. Like I tell people, you can't move physically, but you'll go somewhere else with your eyes. I, I prefer to just stay sta We're just staring at each other right now. And it. Yeah. And then periodically you look away if need be, you know, but yeah, it's just eye contact is just something about it.


Yeah. I'm not, and like, I, I literally see it as I'm not interested in, I like to be right here. Yeah. You know? Yeah. And stay there. Locked in. Yeah. Locked in. So, and, and Coach Harbaugh also called you his X factor. And you know, you, you started, we, we were talking beforehand, you're a badger. You went to Wisconsin where At? Wisconsin. Arkansas. And then Michigan. What, like, your career and learning all these things being around football so much, like what do you think that you're an X-Factor now are, are you feeling like, Hey, I, I know how to do this better than anyone else at this point? No. That's the last thing that I think. Okay. It's a incredible honor for coach to view me the way that he does.


But what I do know and what I've learned over time is, you know what? I do like this moment. I'm right here, right now. And then I'll move on to the next moment. What I've done in the past, what I'm, I, I don't just think, or even I don't let myself, what, what the future holds is irrelevant to me right here, right now. Right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna do this to the best of my ability with you guys. Right. And then move on to the next thing. I don't get caught up in You're the difference or you're the reason for greatness. A team was great, or you're the reason that they were terrible, or I've experienced all of those scenarios.


I just, I like humble and hungry. Right. I'm gonna coach hires me to do what I do and, and it's my responsibility to really just to keep up with him. Yeah. He's the tone setter. He's the tip of the spear. It's easy to respect the guy that conducts the, conducts his business the way he does. And that inspires me to just be sharp every day. Yeah. Yeah. I, I knew you were the real deal when I was, I was looking into like Big, Cat, you know, doing some research before we sat down. I looked at your social media And, it still lists you as the strength and conditioning coach of the University of Michigan. And from that moment, I was like, that's a guy that's locked in on his job. That's like, I don't care about social media. Forget that nonsense.


I'm right here, right now. I don't think that you've tweeted since like 2017. But again, that, that's the kind of guy that I want strengthening and conditioning my players. Have you thought about changing it? No. Yeah. I haven't, to be honest. You know, I got in, when I went from Wisconsin, you know, we went back to back to back big 10 championships. Yeah. We went to Arkansas. And so you get accustomed to, you know, a lot of people saying a lot of positive things about, you know, we're big, strong, physical, all these, all these different, different things. And then we went three and nine that first year and we were not labeled that.


And I got encouraged to get involved with social media and engage and, you know, do these different things. And then it just took me on a rollercoaster emotionally that I was like, you know what? I prefer to not be on this emotional rollercoaster. So then I just disengaged and now I, you know, people were like, coach you, like you live under a rock, kind of. You don't, I have very little awareness of other, you know, things other than what people put in front of me. I just kind of stay in my own world, you know? Here you find me in the room, you find me at, you know, my current address. That's, that's about, that's about the extent of it. Yeah. I was That's good though, was I was listening to a podcast that you did with the guys here and they asked what you do in your, like, spare time for fun.


And your initial answer was clean, you clean stuff. Yeah. So I, there's something about people that, that get it. There's people out there that they just enjoy. They enjoy doing that. I, I love taking something from, you know, if it's disorganized or messy, if it's mine, I'm not interested in doing it, doing it for you guys. Right. But if it's mine, I just, I, I enjoy. I couldn't tell you why, because Since you cried from It, sense of accomplishment. Yeah. Accomplishment, yeah. All of those things. And, and so I find myself when I, you know, it's just a peaceful place for me, you know? Yeah, Yeah. And you, you, I also heard that, so this new facility's incredible. Yeah. Are you worried at all that it's too nice for what you want to do?


No. What's funny is like, you look like If, you go over, we got some plates and you'll find some rust. You'll find a little rust. Okay, good. You'll find a little rust here and there. But yeah. Whether it's this or, you know, you could put us in, I mean, a back alley somewhere. Like, we're gonna conduct our business the same way. You know, we're gonna train, we're gonna do things. How we doing? Yeah. The environment. It's just a beautiful environment. We take a lot of pride in that. But no, the work, how we work, the way we work, the consistency we work with is that's gonna take place regardless of where we are. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause I, I heard you fell in love with a shop vac that you went to the store, got a shop vac. Yep. And now you just wanna shop vac everything, which I understand. I, I fell Vacs cool.


I The most versatile, it's the most versatile tool out there, you know, every, every time a guy that's been on my staff, like they become a homeowner. That's my favorite gift to give is a shop. Is a Shop. Yeah. I had a similar experience with a power washer. You get a power washer, then all of a sudden you want a power wash. Everything. Yeah. And it, it's so satisfying. But yeah, like you said, there's like small feeling of accomplishment. You feel like you've done something. Yeah. And I'm Ready to move. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's, The shot back is gritty. It is, yeah. Because you don't have to, like, you can, I mean, pretty much anything, you know, you can, you can suck up with a shop back. I love it. I, you could say I love the, the versatility and I love the grit factor of the shop back. The shop back. Yeah. No doubt.


So, so coming to the NFL, is it, how does your job change when you, you know, you've spent all this time in college, you're taking 17-year-old kids, building them into men. Now you got a bunch of men. Is it like, have you noticed that, hey, I gotta approach this differently? Or is it, this is my system and we'll figure it out going forward? Yeah. The biggest thing is it's a lot more similar than it is different. There are some nuances that are different. The maturity of the, the population you work with is, is obviously different. But the desire guys in coming into college as freshmen, guys that are in college, you know, they, high percentage of them, you know, they're hell bent on getting better.


Yeah. And improving Exact same here. You know, regardless, at least this roster, the guys that we have, regardless of how much money they make or or not, where they fall in that category, they wanna, they want to get better. Yeah. And, and If, you can help them do that. That's very, that's very important to them. Yeah. They're very responsive to that. And the process, the system, the way we do things, our evaluation process, making sure, and I've told guys, this isn't come in, let's get a workout, like we're gonna train. It's very different. And so training is very intentional. What we're gonna do, why we're gonna do it, and being able to build that rapport and that relationship with these guys is, is of the utmost importance because they've been doing it.


They have a lot of 'em have different experiences, you know, doing different things. But If, you relate and communicate to 'em and in the, what I view as the appropriate way they've been, they've been great. Yeah. Yeah. So as somebody that's in charge of building strength, when you go into every off season, I assume that you, you tweak things, right? You, you always try to get better, you try to improve. How do you determine, like what's gonna change year over year in a strength program when maybe you've been there for a while, maybe you know what works? Like how do you figure out, okay, this is a missing piece that we need to add on and incorporate next season? You know what the unique thing is every year you don't know necessarily until these opportunities present themself what is going to be needed, right?


Because each year there's different individuals that make up the team. The, the mentality and the makeup of the team, the, the culture so to speak, the personality that the group has, it changes. And so if you're gonna say, how are we going to improve the capability of the four rotator cuff muscles in the shoulder? There's a specific cuff sequence that we do. It's what we do where there's the most versatility is things that involve consistency, things that involve mentality because there's cer certain things that certain individuals need and certain teams need that other teams didn't. Yeah.


Right. And then it's, it's always figuring out, you know, what range of motion and tissue and joint, you know, flexibility, mobility, strength and power movement traits. That stuff's relatively easy. It's the things, those are all objective. We measure, we test, we measure, we test. Right. The guys all have that data, but it's these other factors that play a significant role. The mentality we talk about grit, consistency, all of these things play a significant role. And those are the things that change because when, when you have a group or a team that has that, you don't need as much of it.


Right. Things to help with that. Yeah. And you have some teams that don't have that, Hey coach, what do we got today? Day Stop asking me that. Why do you care what we have? Right? Right. It doesn't matter what we have. The only thing that matters is how you're gonna do what we have. Right. You know, so these type of tho that's what one big cue, they start asking like, what's the schedule? What are we doing? They wanna know, oh, so you can prepare yourself for what's to come. Right. And then I'll tell them the, I'll just make up just some random sequence that they, oh, okay, cool. Sounds good. And then it's not that, in fact, it's the exact opposite.


Right? Yeah. And then they, you, you can completely desensitize 'em. Right. And that's one of my, that's one of the, because That is a very natural thing when you're like, I'm about to do something that sucks. I want to know how bad it's gonna suck. And then you can prepare yourself like, all right, I gotta go hard here, I gotta go a little softer here, I gotta go. That's smart that you keep them on their toes. You, you in your introductory press conference here. I loved it. You said that we're not building shrink. We're making them harder to break. How do you make someone harder to break? Could you make us harder to break? A hundred percent. Yes. Guaranteed. Because we Break easy Now. This is, this is the key. And here's an exact just way I, when the guys, when we talk through it, okay.


So, and I referenced in my opening press conference, neck training. So in my opinion, when your neck is stronger in flex, when you press forward or an extension when you press back and we side bend as well, when your neck is stronger and you strike something or get struck, in my opinion, you're gonna be able to dissipate that force more effectively, which is gonna decrease the likelihood of the brain coming in contact with the skull. Now can it, and does it still happen? Yes, it does. But if I have the choice, oh, I'm going to go to great lengths to make sure we are as effective as we can be at getting your neck strong.


Inflection and extension. Same thing with the four rotator cuff muscles in the shoulder. If, you want a strong stable shoulder. Would you prefer all four? Were strong. Three of the 4, 2, 1, or none of them. So right away, okay, coach Herb, how you gonna make us harder to break? I'll take you in, I'll literally show you a neck sequence, teach it to you, let you feel it, take you through a four part cuff sequence. You guys could do those, those things easily. And you could do them multiple times a week. And then you could be in a multi multiple different situations where that could benefit you. Right. And for the guys is things happen.


But when we look at what we're gonna program and what we're gonna administer to them, that's how I view making them and helping them become harder to break is making sure that certain areas of the body just are, are more equipped to tolerate stress better. We, We need you to make a harder to break for podcasters. So it's stuff like, can you eat, you know, of 10 buffalo wings and then have a dairy queen blizzard? Will your legs fall asleep when you're taking a shit like that? That we need that type. Not forget the neck. Yeah. Well we just need, we need like, How loud can you scream at your mom when she comes down to the basement? Yeah. Not now. I'm recording. Can you, can you watch football on six TVs at the same time?


Yeah. Are we harder to break? That's what we need. You need me to program for That? You guys are out. You're outside of my world. Yeah, I think you're on the right. I'd love to see you in our world. For What? You Oh, you would hate disgusting. You would hate it. Oh My god, you would hate it so bad. You Got a good point about the, about the neck though. I feel like woodpeckers, what do they do all day? They slam their head against a tree. They got strong necks. They don't get CTE, they don't get concussions. Yeah, they got the stabilize muscles right there. How long would a, would a, a neck sequence for guys like us, how long would that take To a, to take you through a, we call it a four-part next sequence, four-way next sequence. I I mean, it'd probably take me two minutes, two and a half minutes to take you through it and you To find out how weak we are.


Well, I would know as soon as I put my hands, I would, I would, alright. We're Gonna do that after this. Yes. Yes. But I would, I would know. And then the key is I'm only interested. I'm not gonna give you more than you can handle. There's no benefit to gi give you too much pressure. No. Good. Too little. No good. I'm go, I'm gonna get full range and you're gonna work. Right. I'm gonna let you get the range that you need to get, but I'm gonna make you earn it. And at the end you'll go, I, i 100% guarantee you'll go. Oh, that's what he's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you'll Love it. Okay. We're gonna do that after this. Yeah. Yeah. So the other thing I, I love how you refer to it as cold water, but you love the ice ice bath. How long do you stay in?


I just got asked this not too long ago. 10 to 15 minutes. And What temperature? I don't care. It could be 39, 47, 52. You know what, cold water? Yeah. Cold. Whatever it is. Like, Hey, hey, how cold is this? It's, no, that's too cold. Or too, I'm gonna get in it. I'm gonna sit in there, you know, up to my neck for 10 to 15 minutes. Geez. And the first four to five, I'm in there. Just you, we say the three of us are in there. We're, and I'd say, Hey, you just get to the six, seven minute mark and everything starts to numb out. And then you got another, you know, however long we decide to stay in there.


But then it's, you know, you're thawed out, or excuse me, you're numb. So yeah. And then I always say, then get out, put a hoodie and some sweats on. Let your body just thaw out naturally and then shower after. But that's, I think you would've survived the Titanic. That's, that's a yeah. A very long amount of time. Like just, just sitting in there six minutes until you get numb and then you won't feel it anymore. It's crazy. I gotta, I, I gotta try the, the cold tub situation. but it, I heard it, it increases a bunch of stuff in your body. It increases like all the good stuff, all the good brain, I don't even know what they call 'em, but it, it gives you like the serotonin, the dopamine or whatever. But you do it, I'm guessing primarily for like inflammation stuff.


Yeah. And I said, you know, when I got asked about it last time, just joints makes my joints feel incredible. Yeah. And then If, you ever want, I was talking to one of the players about it the other day, If, you wanna, and you, you guys may already know this, if you've ever just jumped in cold water, like sitting in it, get in, just sit in it for, you know, just a few seconds and then get out. That's one thing you wanna wake up and it's all based on the sensory receptors, the amount of sensory receptors you have in your head. When you get in, you drop under, you come out, you, it's instant. You, you want an instant wake up.


Yeah. Yeah. Are you allowed to eat in the cold tub? You can eat, drink. And you okay? Yeah. Get it. Just get in and relax. Use Cold water. Yeah, let's do it. I have a nice like soup dinner, hot soup in the cold tub. Yeah. Warming from the inside out. One of one of my favorite pictures ever. And I texted 'em after I saw it, JJ and tj or, or they had cut a hole, you know, and they're sitting in their pond. Yeah, Yeah. In the ice, like, la da Da. Just, you know, just hanging out. Do first thing in the morning instead of a shower. Just cold. Just cold water wakes you right Up cold. I, I don't prefer it first thing in the morning, but If you. Yeah. You get in If, you took a, you could even start hot and then just the last say 60 seconds or 20 seconds before you get out, turn that thing to Colt and you'll, oh, it'll, yeah.


It'll bring you to life real quick. What, What time are you waking up these days? It depends on the day. I love, this is another thing they said. What do you love to Do? I Love to sleep. I don't know if you've ever met someone that enjoys sleeping more than I do. However, for 25 years, I usually will get up between three and five. That's insane. That's crazy. What time do you go to Sleep Usually? 8 39. Nine 30. Okay. Now, some nights, you know, if we're, you know, we're gonna, I'm gonna hang out, you know, with my wife and boys a little bit, clean Some stuff, get the shop back out, go crazy. But I've never, I've never enjoyed waking up early.


I love to sleep. And when I get downtime, I'll sleep as long as I can. Yeah. Yeah. But, but I'm, you know, it's all, once I get rolling, then it's good. But I wake up when the day, you know, based on what the daily demands are. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you wake up at three in the morning and you don't like to wake up early, that's like you're, you're instilling grit every single day. A hundred, A hundred percent. And I say, you know how there, there's people that put their feet on the ground in the morning and they're like, I'm ready to have a great day today. Yeah. That's not me. Yeah. Yeah. I wake up and it's like, How much coffee? No coffee. First thing I do is get in the shower cold hot to start, and then I'll usually finish. Not always, but I'll finish with a, you know, 10 to 15 second little cold burst.


Yeah. Wake you up. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you do between the hours of like three 30 and six or six 30 when, when everyone else gets to work? Well, so it depends on what, what the day brings, you know, what time, if we have a staff meeting or what time we're gonna train. Usually because of classes in college, there is, you have early morning training session or, or multiple because of the, the class demands here it's different, but whatever, you know, whatever it may be that needs to be done. That's what we're doing. Yeah. So when you're watching your team out there, do you get extra pride out of like, watching them run the football?


Like I'm thinking even it's incredible Michigan versus Penn State this year. Incredible. There no, there Pass in the second half. Is that like, is that just the pinnacle for you watching them just absolutely beat down another team physically, There's, there's no better feeling. It's, it's incredible. And, and I would prefer like those type of scenarios. It's incredible. And I learned it at Wisconsin. Yeah. You know, when I got there as a player and what we took pride in doing, and then it really became instilled in me to, to run and pound a rock. Yeah. It's, it's, it's amazing. Take The will of the other team. Yeah. Yeah. It was, and and to do it, you know, like we did it this year, especially that Penn State game.


Yeah. It was no better feeling. Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's a match made in heaven with Harbaugh because he has famous times. I think there was this Stanford, was it Stanford versus Oklahoma State in a bowl game and he ran the same run, play like 13 times in a row down the field. It's just like, you can't stop it. That has to be the be that's like the peak of just like man football. Yeah. As I, as I see it, I, I love it. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. It's great. And there's nothing, there's nothing you can do to stop it. Have, has that ever happened against a team that you've been associated with? Where it was happening to me. To you? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Wisconsin verse Michigan in 2019, maybe in Camp Randall.


That was a big one. Yes. Yeah. That did not feel, we ran the ball down. That did feel good. That did not feel good. Yeah. Yeah. Those what I, what I take from those, it, it makes you feel certain what it, what it does is it inspires you to, you had to get back to work. You know? And that's why I say humble. It's, I've been on both sides of it. And I prefer, fortunately I've been on the other, on the good side a lot more than the bad side, but, oh, I, I know how both sides feel. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. I, I noticed that one of your favorite pieces of workout equipment is just big tires. You buy a lot of big tires. What is it about tires? Like tire flipping, tire pulling, what is it about tires that make 'em such a great piece of workout equipment?


So it used to be the tire and I had the most insane collection of tires we named them. We had the most insane collection of tires. I, I mean 15 different sizes and shapes. Now we have finisher flip sleds. The beauty of the finisher flip sled is the position that it puts the guys their lower back end. And you don't have to grab it here, you can grab it in this way. And, it stresses the bicep differently. So posturally, it puts 'em in a better position. But your ability to get triple extension and to develop strength and power, that is my new, yeah. I don't even, you could, it's similar to a tire flip, but it's, I wouldn't even disrespect the flip sled by saying it's that it's, it's its own beast.


And it's one of, if not my favorite tools, that thing is insane. That's another thing you guys, I'll teach you how to use the finisher flip sled. Yeah. Incredible tool. Yeah. So how, how would you go about naming your tires Kinda glossed over That one. Yeah. You know what, just my staff, we would just look at the tire and that looks like, and we would just throw names out there and then, you know what I mean, bat around. No. And we, yeah, we literally, we would just go down the line and, and really just banter back and forth about what we thought would be the best name. Just dude's naming tires. Yeah. What's it look like? And then that's, that's what we will go with. What about, what about having the plates, everything Perfect. What what's that about? Where you said that in your introductory press conference, every plate is gonna be exactly where it needs to be.


Nothing, just like laying around. Is that just a mentality of you gotta take care of your surroundings? It's just how, it's that it's also just how we practice attention to detail. And it often, sometimes people don't, it's not going to directly correlate and guarantee you're gonna be successful. But what it is an effective tool to me is practicing your attention to detail. You want your footwork to be a certain way you want when you strike something. Right. All these things in your, in your game, you know, you're, you're, there's so many different details that matter. That's just how we practice attention to detail.


I, i just little q little cues that I'll use one, I I take tremendous pride in the space. Yeah. And I, you know, I like things neat and clean. So that just is what it is. But in terms of when you wa how we train, when, when I teach you guys when we do the neck or I teach you posturally, I don't want you, I'm not gonna put your lower back in a bad position or allow you to do it in a way that's gonna hurt you. Right. Right. So these details and how you execute all of these things are paramount. Because if technically if you're not sound technically in my opinion, then you increase the likelihood of injury in a training environment.


So the, it's just the detail. Yeah. And then how do we practice it? And, and that's just, that goes hand in hand with just the respect we have for the space too. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Do the little things right. The big things take care of themselves, that sort of thing Along those lines. Yeah. Yeah. So who is the, you've coached a lot of really strong players and they've become strong as you've coached them. Who's the strongest guy you've ever worked with? The key is strongest in what? Because So, if you said Turkish getup If, you If, you guys know what a Turkish Yep. getup is. Yep. Okay. And I describe that to the guys as it's a movement that challenges and stimulates the body from the tip of the finger. When your arms extended from the tip of your finger to tip of your toes, it's holding a bar and, and, and being down And.


it could be a dumbbell. Yeah. It could be a bar And standing up with it over your head. Right. Standing up with it and then coming down with it as well. Yeah. Chris Jenkins DT tackle at Michigan did it with 170 pound dumbbell And. it was silky smooth. I mean, it was incredible. You can see when a guy's outta control and he's all, and you can see when he's rock solid, Aiden Hutchinson had did it with, he had a bar and he had 45 pound plates on each side with no collar. Because if the wrist, it's doing it with a two and a half on each side is one thing. Okay. If the plate slides off, if it, if it's not perfectly stable, if the plate slides off big deal, they can still stabilize it. If a 45 pound plate slides off one end the other side, it's going the wrong way quickly.


So the demand, I don't like things that are high reward and high risk. My favorite things are things that are high reward, low to no risk. However, there's a sliding scale with every movement I choose for the guys. But when Hutch was getting ready to do that, he literally started with a bar, then a bar and two and a halfs on each side. Fives. And he worked his way up. I knew that if I captured that, you know, he, it would just give him, it's another feather in his cap of what a free show he was and what a free show he is. Chris Jenkins that, you know, mozzie Smith, he took, he took 3 25. I mean he hit it for 20 reps.


He went up to Plyo stairs. We had Kenneth Grant, 360 pound that, that de tackled, that ran down that back from Penn State. He went up to, we had to plyo stairs at Michigan. He went up at 360 pounds. He went up those in like 2 7 9, 2 0.79 seconds. Lower body. Travis Frederick played center force at Wisconsin. Incredible. And you could go on down the line, you know, the things that you see guys do over the years. Yeah. But those are, those are some of 'em. Yeah. Did you, a couple Wisconsin questions one, the TCU Rose Bowl game, was there any talk afterwards? We should have run John Claymore.


That one hurt. Yeah. That, that one hurt. That one Hurt. That one hurt. I was sitting right in the sideline where the two point conversion failed. Yeah. That was bad. John Clay was a beast in that second half. Beast. Yeah. Beast. You know what, I can't remember what the, the postgame, you know, conversations were or weren't. But yeah, I mean, when we gave him the ball, yeah. It usually worked out well for us. Just Truck people. Then Russ did spike the ball in time. You agree Against Oregon? In my opinion, yes. Okay. Yeah. And then was there any talk when you left Wisconsin for Arkansas, was that, was there any conversation about like, we're running outta wat brothers and there's no more coming.


We gotta we gotta get outta here before You run out. Well, you know what I had, I had jj, I had Derek and, you know, over the years, you know, I, I see TJ here and there on unfortunately never got to coach him, but yeah, then, then he came after I had left. And then, yeah. You wish there was, You know, it just keep going. You thought for a while there was like, every year's just gonna be another w brother. We we're good. No doubt. Yeah. Yeah. Talk To mom and dad, like, hey, maybe get back in the bedroom for last time for me. Think about the future of the Football team. Yeah. We just need all their kids to go to Wisconsin. That's all I care about. Would be amazing. Sign 'em up. Yeah. I got a real scientific question for you. What is the best lifting music? Ooh.


Ooh. See now this is where, when it comes to music, I usually, it's the vibe of, of the, the guys. Fortunately for me, we could put there's, I mean, you could put anything on there. I love old school. Like you throw the Rocky four soundtrack on and I'm, you know, that's a, that's a, that's a go-to, but it can be Metallica, it can be heavy metal, it can be any type of hip hop, whatever, whatever the guys are feeling. And they're gonna vibe too. That's, that's what it is. Yeah. Some days And, it's all over the map. Fortunately, I love, I love it all. And I've heard it all 25 years spent in a weight room.


I've, you know, heard everything. And I fortunately enjoy everything. Yeah. You have a raw doggett in the gym. You go in there, no music, no headphones. There's days no music. And I'm just looking for someone to be like, Hey Coach R, where's the music? And I go, you, oh, you need the music? Or, or we'll play. We've played Barney and they're, some guys are so focused on like the music. Hey, stop worrying about the music and worry about, you know, those, those are some of the mind. Yeah. We'll use some of those, some of those tools too from love that from a mentality standpoint. There's No music in waiting for the first guy to ask You where the music says, some days we'll take a horn And it just, and just repeatedly.


And, and they're so like, what? Hey, you know, just stop, stop focusing on get 'em to focus on the wrong thing. Yeah. But here's the, and and they will be, they do become desensitized, I promise you. Yeah. Here's where you're working with, when you're talking to us in terms of grit level. There have been times I've gone to the gym realize I forgot my headphones. And then I'm like, well, I can't work out today. And then I just leave. Yeah. You'd be disgusted by us. That's not Gritty. That's not, yeah. You would Be's not disgusted. That's we're we have gr I'm working on it in certain, certain facets, you know, doing our job. But in terms of like working out, we don't have a lot of grit. Yeah. So we need that. And it's not all created equal. I mean, you, to do your job is the most important.


So whatever you have to do Right. To get yourself where you need to be. Yeah. I'm not like, I'm in a working environment. My level of urgency is very high. However, when I leave, I tell the guys when I leave, I'm, I'm one of the most chill laid back. You know what I mean? Just 'cause what Do, I need urgency for when we're, you know Yeah. Just hanging out. Yeah. It's just, you have to time it appropriately. And, and like you said, when we're working, we have it, which, that's when you need it. Yep, yep, yep. And when you're not working, you know, there's, you can be selective in a workout. You don't have your headphones, you don't feel like training. Okay. That's a lot different than you. You don't feel like doing a show.


You gotta get your mind right. You're gonna get your mind right. Yeah. We don't miss shows. That's A fact. I broke my foot. I did a podcast that day. Big Cat. Got By dog by a dog. Didy did a podcast. There you go. No problem. Yeah, right through it. That's grit. Yeah. That Is grit. Have People calling calling Dog Bite that day. Yeah. They'd be like, can't do it. Yeah. Rabies shots. We Got it. We got that. Grit. Alright, well Coach HARs, this has been awesome. I got one last question. Chevy question. chevy.com. Go check it out. Chevy Silverado. Best truck out there. Coach Harbaugh who we're, we're we love, we're good friends with, do you train him? Does he ask you like, Hey coach Herbs, I need a, I need a formula.


You know, you need to gimme everything. Are you, are you actively training him still? Coach Harbaugh does not a coach Harbaugh just walks into the room and he's ready to train. You know it. Coach you ready to roll? He does. Not ever, never. What are we doing today? How much? How he just goes and he attacks and he does everything that the guys, I mean, he sled drags, he flip sleds. He, he, he does it all. He reverse bear crawls. Like we had a ramp at Michigan, he would reverse bear crawl. He, all of it eats it up. I love That. Eats it up. I Love that. Yes. And he does it all in his khakis. Right. He, he, a lot of times whenever He walks in the weight room, whenever he is shows up wearing that's what he trains in.


Yeah. It's like, Hey, I gotta go and change and No, he just coach you ready to roll and he he'll give you that nod, you know? Yep. And then he, he just, yeah. He's the grittiest Yeah. Of the gritty. Yeah. Yeah. Believe It. When you first interviewed with him, did you know during the interview you're like, I can work with this guy. This is going really well. You know what, when he decided that, you know, he, he brought me into Michigan to interview and then I just, I hadn't met coach or been around him, so I did a little background and then you just, some of the, the stories and some of the things you hear and then some of the people that had called me, Hey, you know, you're gonna Michigan coach. And then it just, these, these things you hear, I, I came to realize quick like the type of mentality, you know, that, that he had.


And that's, that's why I mean it was, it was the perfect fit. Yeah. Yeah. It's worked out well. Yeah. I mean, I'm pumped just listening to you talk. I, I, I kind of want to just move out here and have you train me, but it wouldn't go well. I'd break in a second actually. We might break you. Yeah. You maybe If You spent one day with us, we would probably break your will. You'd be like, I gotta get outta here. This is terrible. These guys Are too easy to break. I'm, yeah. They've been sitting on the couch for so long. But yeah, that's, it's, it was awesome to have you on. Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate it. Best of luck this year. X factor. And let's do this neck test. Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it. All right, let's Do I. Love it. It,

Okay. Great job Huey. Great job Huey. Let's get to Fire Fest of the week. Wrap up the show. PFT Your Fire Fest of the Week. My fire fest of the week is it's fantasy football related. We are in a fantasy league. It's CJ McCollums, he calls it the High Rollers League. And Jerry O'Connell manages our team every year. But in years past, I've kind of been the one that's on the group chat with the league. And then I text Jerry on the side and I tell him what's happening. Oh no. This year I decided it's time to have Jerry in the mix. Oh no. So yesterday I added Jerry O'Connell to the Fantasy Football Group chat. CJ McCollum Turtle from Entourage, Julius Randall.


There's a, a few others that I'm, I'm not naming right now, but it was like throwing a bomb into that group chat. Yeah, I'd imagine. So I brought him in there, added his number. First thing that happens, Jerry texts them. And I'm not gonna be reading things outta the group. I'm not gonna make a habit out of reading things outta the group chat. But for the intro, I think, I think this deserves a little bit of discussion. Jerry just comes out and says, Hey guys, Jerry O'Connell here. And the group chat turned green. Oh yeah, he's got The Android. He was out of, out of the 12 people that were in there, he was the first non iPhone user. Oh. He Ruined it. And then everybody started commenting how he turned the chat green.


Oh no. And they were booing him. And. it was a tough start. And then Jerry says, Hey everybody, Jerry with the Android. I came in second two years ago when DeMar went down prayers for DeMar and also Ukraine. And then nobody responded. And then Jerry like two hours later says, Hey fellas, just so you can get to know me, here's a link to my IMDB. And then he posted a link to his own IMDB in the group chat. And he said, go ahead, ask me anything. And nobody really replied. I think, I think Turtle said Mr. Bing bong back to him. Okay. And then Jerry said, yeah, Mr. Bing bong, I don't know anyone on this feed. Anyone from the mainstream media on here, just want to know how raw I can get.


And then, and then no one's responding to that, so, oh no, I've really mixed up the, I've mixed things up. You know, Jerry, he's gonna add some excitement to the fancy group chat. He's coming in hot. Oh, I expect nothing less from Jerry. Oh No. But we have to have him on to, to talk us through what a strategy's gonna be. Last year it didn't work out so well. Turning a group chat green is just unforgivable. Yeah. So now I obviously I'm to blame for, for doing that. Yeah. And Jerry, get a fucking iPhone dude. I'm sorry, I'm sorry to the group chat, but I think you'll enjoy having Jerry in there. Give him a chance. Yeah. Jesus. Now I'm pretty sure they started a second group track. Oh, for sure. Just minus the And Jerry now Jerry. Yeah.


Jerry's gonna be coming into Chicago last week of August. So we get our, our full fantasy preview. Very excited for that. I Hope that this just turns into Jerry just, just talking to the guys and nobody ever responding to it. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, like this is mental warfare in our part. Yeah. We haven't won years past. Jerry's kind of, he's knocking 'em off balance right now. He's gonna get them to a point where they're just gonna want to do, like, do whatever trade with Jerry. Just get off your back. It's kinda like negotiating against Marlon's man. Yeah, Marlon's man has sent me some updates recently. How's doing with his schedule? He's doing great. Well, I'll tell you. How are his cats? Lemme tell you. Okay. I Feel like we haven't gotten a Marlon's man Cat update in a while.


Okay. Let's see. All right. Last text from Marlon Mans. Well, I'm going tonight to Chicago for Sunday night baseball, I think. Last one with no football or hockey or basketball. That was when we were in Grit Week. And then he just sent me eight cities in two days. Seattle New Newark, Albany, Saratoga Springs, Boston, yesterday. Boston and New York. To Milwaukee. To Chicago today. So when he says Newark in there, is he just talking about the airport? I think so. And then yesterday I did not open this. It was just Instagram reel of, oh, I think it's just Manny's Deli in Chicago.


That's cool. Yeah. I mean, I, I know the place. Oh no, it's men's delicatessen. So it's just a bunch of sandwiches which credit to him. 'cause usually when you open up an Instagram reel, it could just be titties. It usually is. Yeah. Especially with Jerry. With Jerry or Marlon's. Yes. We should put them on a chat together. Yes. And they're both Android. Yes. Yes. I like that. Wow. Also, Marlon's man, please. For, for the love of God. We need an update on your cats. I wanna know how your giant cats are doing. Yeah. Let us know about those pussies. Okay. My fire fest. I I have two, one, I hate that I'm gonna say this because, well, he's probably not gonna listen. I do Miss Hank every time he's out as much as we give him shit. I do like that is, it's empty right now.


It's also, it comes from a, a place of jealousy that Hank has gotten to do so much cool stuff this summer. Well, I don't know if I'd count this as he's ringing a bell. Yeah. But he loves that fucking lighthouse. Yeah. I just, I miss him. I miss him. Yeah. So I hope he doesn't hear this part that I genuinely miss him whenever he is out. I miss him. I, I think he did not bad in Mount Rushmore today actually. Yeah. I think his movie quotes did not bad. Yeah, I think he did. Not bad. Yeah. It's gonna be a fight. We have six left after today. And Congrats to Max. Congrats On Max. You clenched. Good job, max. You didn't clinch first. Right. But you, you clinched not last. Yeah. And that's what's important. Donny's making meatballs right now and he keeps telling me to come eat 'em.


That's My Fire fest. Oh, okay. That's a good fire fest. We'll wrap up soon. My other fire fest is, my wife and oldest were outta town for a couple days and so I was in charge of the two youngest and I did okay. But I quickly realized that like I have these moments where I'm like, oh, I'm an adult. I'm clean. I'm not like I used to be one, my house just went right back to like my college apartment. There was just shit everywhere, boxes everywhere. Just not opening the, she came home and she was just like, did you check the mail? And I was like, ah. Mail. That's The one thing came in with like a huge stack. And then there was one night where I was doing dinner with my two youngest. And halfway through dinner I realized that I just had them both eating off paper towels and I had just not giving them plates.


That works. So yeah, that was one of those moments where like, dude, what are you doing? Just get the fucking plates out. But spin zone, that's how I eat, I eat over the sink. I eat over the trash. But Spin zone, some of the most memorable times in my childhood, bonding with my dad, where when my mom would leave town and then she'd come back and that, like those two hours before she got, yeah. We would all spend time just like undoing all the damage Correct. That we did to the house before she got back And. it was fun. Yeah. And we ran, we ran, we ran the, the, the same play we ran chicken nuggets, Mac and cheese. Yeah, chicken nuggets, Mac and cheese. Run it again. Yeah. I just basically was like, do it again. Do it again. Okay. Huey Max needs these meatballs real fast.


No, Donny just, Donny just gave me a plate. Oh, he did? Okay. One bite review. Wait, are you holding the meatballs right now? Yeah. He didn't gimme a fork, which is Just use your hand. Yeah, just dive in there. What do you think Max? Really good meatball. Really good. Oh, that's so gross. That's a nasty sound. It sounds juicy though. Smells great. Yeah. Okay. My, my fire fest. So I got a new place. It's a walking distance from work. Everything's great. Love it. So the roommates are a little interesting.


Okay. And so the one guy very nice showed me around the place, I think his name's Elio, Eli, something like that. Eli or Elio? Elio, Yeah. It was like the EE Just call me. Yeah. Big E. Yeah. E He's smaller than me, so Yeah. But that's funny. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Big E. Yeah. I, I'll try it. We'll try it. Okay. And then, so he's some great guy. Awesome. The other guy didn't say a word when I walked by him in the kitchen, I, I had a little, I had to grab a Pepsi zero sugar, and I went in there, went, I was gonna say hi to him, but then we looked at each other and he didn't say anything. So that scared me In Your kitchen apartment. Yeah. So that scared me and I was like, I'm not gonna say anything.


So then I just got my stuff and I left. Do You guys share? I walked down the hall. You sure? Kitchen and the living room? Just yeah, yeah, yeah. And he has a cat? No. Oh. Where'd that come From? I don't know. I thought I saw something about a cat or a dog. In your apartment? No, there's a chick who lives upstairs. Okay. Different apartment with a dog. But what happened was that our front doors are the same. So like, oh, open Up a hallway. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. So, so she was coming down as I was coming in, so that confused me as I like, as like, you know, what's going on here. But that's a different apartment. Her and whoever. How's the dog? Did you pet the dog? I did meet the dog. Dog. Nice dog. I petted very nice dog. Yeah, very nice dog. You can't have another max On? No, I petted it. It came up to me. I petted, you know what kind of Dog?


It was a pit bull. Oh, nice. Yeah. What was the name of the dog? I don't, I don't know. I didn't get that. You gotta get the name of this dog. I don't know. I don't even know the girl Because, well, If, you find out the dog's name, then you just say hi to the dog every time she and the dog walked past. Yeah, Yeah. Never acknowledge her. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. Exactly. All right, so this other guy, you, you've got a roommate that you stood in a kitchen, your kitchen together and did not say a single word. Did not say it was three Seconds. That was, I mean, now you can never talk to him. No, You, that's What I was, that was the moment. That was It. You can never speak to this Person was he was cooking and watching a show at the time. What show? Okay. I don't, I I didn't stay around that. It was, it looked like something that was more live than like a a, an actual like setting. Like it looked like a sporting event live, but it wasn't like it, it felt it had a gamey vibe.


It didn't have a TV show box. You watched sports? No, I did it look like sports. It didn't look like American sports. Got It. That's what, that's what threw me off. So I just assumed, Is this person American? No. Okay. So that's where I kind Of, so maybe they don't speak English. So I heard 'em on the phone and they speak fluent English. Okay. Okay. It's fluent. Could be Smart to say they get the, But it If you walk past and you don't know, like if they're watching something live, you don't, you don't talk to them. That's kind of a good move. Maybe he didn't wanna be interrupted. Yeah. So I, I, I think I played it right. But I also don't know if I did. You Gotta wait till he wears some sort of sports merchandise. Like a hat of a team or a shirt of a team.


And then you strike up the conversation. Also, just to clarify, you did not play it right. Oh. But playing it right from here on out means you can never speak to them. What about Eli? Eli, you can. Okay, cool. But you If you miss the first moment to talk to a roommate. Yeah. In a kitchen. It's over. That's fair. That's what it felt like. That's, it's over, it felt like that moment is gone. He missed the opportunity to talk to you though. Yeah. Think about it that Way you can look at it. Yeah. That's, that's what I had like to see it as. He's probably on a podcast right now saying, I think I screwed things up with my, my new roommate Huey. Yeah. Could you imagine? Yeah. But I also have my own bathroom so I don't have to like, oh wow. Interact. Look at you fancy boy. Yeah. Eli told me I had the nicest room. Oh, so He says that to everyone.


Sounds like a Real straight shooter. So, yeah. I mean, so I don't have to, I really don't have to even like try to interact, but yesterday I was doing laundry and twice where like the second I closed my door and of my room, I heard a door of the other room open. Oh. So that made me think, oh, he just doesn't we're really Yeah, no, he doesn't want anything to do with you. Yeah. It's probably for the best. You don't know him. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like he's, he's sending some pretty strong signals. Yeah. Like, hey, I'm doing my own thing over here. That happens. You don't want any part of this that Happens in work. Like when we got, when we got bigger and bigger as a company like If, you see someone and it's like the first time you see 'em and you don't talk to 'em like that's it. Yeah. You know, like you're just, it's just, that's it.


Yeah. Yeah. Until someone maybe formally introduces you, but you just miss that moment. Or If you see somebody, then you don't wanna be the guy who's like, Hey, do you live here? Yeah. It's like, dude, you know I live here. You saw me yesterday. You didn't say anything. If. you see somebody at work and, and you say, Hey, are you new here? And they're like, no, I've been here three months. Right. Yeah. You can't, you can't risk that. Yeah. Yeah. You can't risk that. Good. Show boys. Let's do some numbers. 8 20, 56, 74.
