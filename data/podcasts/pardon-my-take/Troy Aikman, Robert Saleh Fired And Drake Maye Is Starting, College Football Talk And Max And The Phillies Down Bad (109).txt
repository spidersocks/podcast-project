And Robert Sala is fired. You're gone buddy. You're fired. You're gone buddy. You're gone. Aaron Rogers Coach Killer. Possibly A serial. He's a serial coach. Killer. He's a serial coach. Killer Mike McCarthy. And And. He's got He. Probably would have to, I guess two will make him a serials Coach. Killer. Yeah. If you listen, if you kill two people, you're a serial killer. Killer. That's true. That's a good point. Serial coach, killer memes. Is this what you wanted? Is Nathaniel Hackett also fired? He's not, He's not. He's not fired yet. That feels like you thought caught the wrong Guy. Yeah, I thought He would go First then Bob.


But I thought, I thought, I thought He was got Get fired if They lost the next three games. 'cause They went Vikings. Bills Steelers. Okay. And. Then after That stretch, He would've got fired. But They were just cutting ties with him. What if Bob got fired because He wouldn't fire Nathaniel Hackett. Mm. That's a fireable offense. Yeah, I would agree with That actually. But then They would've fired Nathaniel Hackett still too. Yeah. No, maybe not though. Bet. Because maybe the worst offense is as a head coach, the litmus test is, will you fire Nathaniel Hackett? If you say no, then okay. You can't run my f You're clearly not cut out for this job. Also, I wanna say one got nice thing about Robert Sala. Good defensive coach. I, I would He always He like He never got the qb And.


He He might not He, might not have still had It. We'll, We will see how Aaron Rodgers rest of the season goes. Memes? No. I think He had a qb. He. He He had a qb. When He has a QB right now, He has a QB right now. Said, okay. Alright. But He never got the qb. Right. But his defense is always competed. And. Yeah. Maybe he's just a defensive coordinator type of guy. I Wanna say a lot of nice things about Bob Sala. Okay. Because I, I don't feel like He is, He was not put in a position to succeed. And. A lot of That has to do with the fact That. The entire team just became Aaron Rogers. Yeah. And. So He just He looked very frustrated for the last two years. Obviously having to deal with like the, the rollercoaster at quarterback last year. And, then all the media shit that's been going On in New York.


It looks like He wasn't having any fun out there. Yeah. It It seemed like the writing was On the wall. We should have, We should have paid even more attention. I know you said It was just nothing. Memes. But the moment when He, when Bob Sah went to hug Aaron Rogers during the Patriots game, And Rogers kind of pushed him off. Felt like That was the moment. That was bad. Also, do you remember, I think this was last March at the owners meeting, there was a report, That Woody Johnson, And. Sala got into an argument like in front of everybody. I think the NFL network reported It And then the NFL. Then the Jets came out. And said, this is bad reporting by the NFL network. And then the NFL network did a split of like We stand by And. Also, maybe things didn't happen the way That We thought That They happened.


I think That They just haven't liked each other for a while. I And. Yeah, I'd Agree. And. When you lose, when you lose the London game, It feels worse. The London Game always feels like a firing game. Yeah. Especially for Woody Johnson. Because Woody Johnson He was like the ambassador to Ireland for a while. He's got a bunch of friends over in the uk. They. Were probably at the game. And He is like, oh shit. I feel, I feel like a real asshole in front of my friends. Yeah. Don't embarrass me in front of my friends. I got A fire. So I also, I don't know if there's anything to this, but a lot of the discourse about like the Lebanon flag, On so's arm. So I saw That Story. Yeah. I wasn't so I know That, He doesn't wear It every time. But It wasn't a thing in the last couple years where coaches are wearing, like, where they're like wear their like Yeah. Their heritage. Yeah. And, And, Belichick.


He would just wear the Croatian thing. Just On a random day in December. He'd Bet. Like big Dom always has the Italian Thing. Italian thing. Yeah. And. I think Arthur Arthur Smith had the Scotland flag. Everybody knows Big Scotland guy Arthur Smith. So I got, oh, I got another spin zone for Robert Sak. 'cause I know He is probably listening. This actually is like a great time to get fired because it's football season. Yeah. So you Get to just watch football. And. If Aaron Rogers had not gotten hurt last year, there's probably a chance He would've gotten fired last year. And. Then going into this year, He would've been like, oh, I got find a new job. 'cause I got work. You know, I got keep my name out there. He's almost been forced to sit.


On the couch. And watch football. And. Guess what? It rules. You're getting paid to watch football. Yeah. Getting fired during the season is great. Yeah. Actually, just getting fired as a coach is, is the best gig you could ever hope for. Yes. It's college. NFL. You Get paid money not to work. It's a pretty good gig. And also, you don't have to go into work for the Jets. And, And deal with the media. I may maybe I put like 30% of this firing On the media. Yeah. Probably We. Kind of We. Our hands are not clean in all this. So Memes now. That, you fired a coach. Interim coach. Jeff Ulbrich. Jeff Ulrich. Okay. Defensive coach. Great. 'cause That was, you should have just made It hack It. And just been like, fuck It. Let's run this back. I, I think They should have made It.


Aaron Rogers. All right, I'm They. Should have just done player coach We They could, They could have made It hack It And then put a actual offensive coordinator in. Yeah. But if you, if you just turn It all over to Aaron Rogers, And say like, listen man, this is, this is your team. Anyways. Let's just see what you Can. Do you Get a hundred percent of the blame? A hundred percent of the praise. If It works out, I feel like He would've done It. Yeah. A Hundred percent. By the way I'm looking right now. Jeff Ulbrich, he's got work out. This is now He looks the, the great Beard And. He's only 47 years old. Jeff Berg's got work out because when It comes to interim head coaches, you either need a fat guy, Or, you need like an an ex-player. Hardass He looks like the ex-player. Hardass linebacker.


I think he's got work out. I Got a couple reasons why I think this might work out. He has interim head coaching experience. Yeah. In his past kind of He was Dan Quinn's Wouldbe interim head coach? If Dan Quinn got Covid during the 2020 season, He looks Like a mini Dan Quinn. There's That And. There's also the fact That. He's a wrestler. Yeah. And. I, that's what I'm saying. Linebacker. A wrestler. Being, Being a wrestler, I feel like is a big, big plus in the, in the interim head coach power rankings. That, We do. If We figure out like what are the attributes That makes a successful interim head coach. Another big one is, if you look up fun facts about Jeff Ulbrich online, you don't find anything. Love That. There's nothing fun about this guy. He's not fun. He's not a fun guy. All his fun facts are like, He has a family.


Yeah. He has relatives. Fun fact. Thi He likes football. And He has a family. This guy's got work out memes. Yeah. I think He made the right choice. He's got Get people running through a brick wall. I think so. And. Then if the offense magically just works out too That would bet. Awesome. Yeah. I don't think that's got happen. But So where, where are you at for like, this was a little shocking. I didn't, I I wasn't shocked. That He was fired. I was shocked. That He was fired this quickly. I thought He would maybe Get a couple more games. Then you find the Bye Week And. Then you fire 'em. But they're like, nah, fuck It, let's just fire him right now. What? How are you feeling overall? Is this a positive Or negative? So I think it's a positive.


But I do feel kind of bad for Robert Selloff. No, You can't. Not in this business. Only because Aaron Rogers Achilles is the main reason why I got fired. No, no, no, no. Disagree. We. If Aaron Rogers doesn't tear his Achilles, I would imagine Robert Salah would've gotten fired last year when the Jets, when Aaron Rogers is old And, everything's falling apart. And. Then They don't make the playoffs. I think you're right. But you Get an entire season's worth of Aaron Rodgers And. You could see how He dealt with That instead of just five Games. Got It. Got It. I, I see what you're saying now. It does feel early. And. it doesn't feel like Woody Johnson doesn't fire He head coaches in the middle of the season.


It just like a new thing for him. So It feels early. It feels like a panic move also probably makes It a little bit less likely. That. Devonte Adams, your your Yeah. Your prize possession. That, you've had your eyes. On, do You Devonte Adams. What? I was reading some, some rumors. Devonte Adams of the bills. Oh, I don't know if t make any sense. How does That work out with the Ravens? I Don't know also how t make any sense with Sense We. As you know, Edgar Allen Poe lived later. On his life in New York State. And. That's the only And. Those the only team That play in New York state. I don't know how It would work with Cap Or, any of That shit. But It was interesting. Memes. I am, this sucks a little bit because I wanted forever for Aaron Rogers to tear down a franchise.


And He came so close with the Packers, but now he's On the Jets And. He's just doing That to New York. You realize that's what's happening though, right? We can't really tear something down that's already torn down. That's a fair point. True. That That is a very fair, but there was the expectation of It existing And. Then It just absolute gone to dog shit. He basically went in a guy getting hit in the nuts. Over And. Over And over He showed up, got the guy a cup. And was like, you're safe now with me. And. Then just took a sledgehammer. And hit him in the cup. And smashed everything. I would say it's like It kind of along those lines. If a guy was getting hit in the balls over And over Aaron Rogers came in.


And. He goes, don't worry, I'm got fix everything. And. Then He just cut your dick off. Yeah, The guy. Because That doesn't hurt Anymore. So now, yeah, now you don't have a dick. You unique. You Can still Get hit in the balls. The th Theon. Greyjoy. Yeah. That's memes. Reek memes is is yeah. Fuddled by everything. got He said To him. Got a little re in. There's a lot for Memes to process. This is fucked up. Okay. So, but but memes. I would've thought That. This was, I've seen a lot of dysfunctional franchises in my day. And. This is just like, I don't think it's anything to bet happy about if you're a Jets fan. Because it's just like, oh shit, we're just got keep doing the same thing. And We have no stability.


Yeah. It all comes back to the owner. Really? And. It's just also Nathaniel Hackett might have more power now. That's the scariest part about this. If you're Nathaniel Hackett, you are terrified right now. Yeah. You're like, oh shit, I have to stick around. It's like your mess. You have to clean It up. We. Maybe not, because Rogers seems to like him. And. That's really all It takes to keep your job. You Think Nathaniel Hackett's like reek? Yeah. Kind of. I, I think he's more of a reek And. Then. Aaron Rogers is more of gray Joy. Yeah. Yeah. We. Woody Johnson went On. No, They. They're the same person. Right? Who? On Gray Jordan. Oh, Ramsey. Bolton Ramsey. And Bolt Joy comes Re Yeah. Yeah. What? Woody Johnson went On the news.


I don't know if It was Fox News. Or. CNN. The News News. And said, And said this big end News. This is the best jet team of all time since he's purchased. When did He say That? That was before the season. Oh wow. So his expectations are kind of like my expectations. And. Some people may say I'm delusional, but that's fine. So, okay. When I was waiting for something else there, but, okay, So when That fails, And, you start off the season two. And three. Yeah. Somebody's getting cooked. I If Get Devante Adams is all forgiven. We Because of Woody Johnson. We're not going to get Devonta Adams. Yeah. His son Reddick's not going to sign how everything comes back to the owner Got It.


Joe Douglas has no power. Joe Douglas was friends with Robert Sah. This came from the top. It's trickle down. Sucking, Trickle down. Sucking, trickle Down. Sucking. Okay. Nancy Reagan bet a big fan of those things. Huge. Huge. Alright, so other story before We Get to play off baseball. Yeah, I, I do have a question for you guys. Would you rather, if you're, if you're Bob Sala, would you rather Get fired in England? Or would you rather Get fired after you come back to the United States? And, then you have to go into work And. Then you're sitting in your office, you already started work And. Then the owner comes in home. I'd rather, I'd rather Get home. I think I'd rather Get fired overseas. No, because then you got go. Then you got fly back. On your own And. You got tell your family And, all That stuff. Would you rather Get fired in person?


Like you have to wake up early, go to work. Get fired And. Then leave Or. Just Get like a text call. Or email. Yeah. It could, This could have been an email. I would rather Get fired in England. And just go On an epic bender over there. Just bet like, fuck It. I'm just got have a good time. I mean, I assume He would not, yeah, I mean I think He has like a bunch of kids. Yeah, no, I'm saying me. I'm saying you would you rather guy. Yeah. He's got a lot of Kids. I would rather He. He's got like a shitload of kids, right? So many. How many kids does He have? I think 11. Yeah. Are you Serious? He's not doing a bet. Remember there was That report. He was getting his house fixed. And, everybody was just staying in a hotel. Yeah. He tells his kids, dad, Hey guys, dad's going to England for a work trip. He'll bet back soon. Seven. Seven. He never, seven never comes back. Seven is just as close, like once you Get over five it's, it's like you're got bet like doing a TLC show.


Okay. So I would rather go home though. Just because I wouldn't have to deal with, 'cause then you, if you go On an epic bender, then you have the hungover flight home where you're like, fuck. I like actually facing the fact That, you got fired. Then you just never go home. You're like, I'm an England man now for the rest of my days. Yeah, I would want to go home. Alright. So other Monday night football, the Chiefs are back. They never left. But That was the best. The offense has looked in a while. Patrick Mahomes I think threw for two over 200 yards in the First. Half They also are doing just we've, we've said It before. We've made the parallels to the dynasty Patriots.


But what the chiefs are doing is very dynasty Patriots esque in That. They have They have shifted their defenses. Elite And. Now They also are adding in the fact That They got guys like Juju Smith, Schuster And, Kareem Hunt, And, just making them good again. It's 'cause They know what Kansas City is. Yeah. So They just Get back in the building. And. They're like, oh yeah, I remember. I'm good at football. It's crazy because there was so Sola tweeted That, it's been 1,366 days since Juju Smith Schuster had over 130 yards. That was the most game since He had the 2021 Wild Card game. And. Then It had been 1,400 And 22 days since Kareem Hunt had gone over a hundred yards rushing.


Yeah. I feel like They, They're just throwing back to guys who were good four years ago. The Chiefs Can take anybody, any player that's been On the roster in like the last 10 years. And bring them back. And. Then they'll just bet good again. Doesn't matter. Like Shady McCoy. Yeah. You Can. Tell me Shady McCoy would Get signed tomorrow? Yeah. And I'd bet. Like yeah, he's probably got Get 60 yards receiving. Yeah. And. So Also their offensive line. I don't think It gets lost sometimes. 'cause They have Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kel. They've got superstars. They've got a great defense. But the Chief's offensive line is really fucking good. Yeah. We They keep getting injuries though. Yeah. And They got a couple last night. And, but they're but they're still, yeah. They just keep pushing you back. No, They basically just, you know, changed the whole team over And. They've, they've lost some really good players in, in, in the shuffle of It.


Had to let go of guys. Had to, had to let guys walk for money. more money. But Or trade guys, And, They, It, doesn't matter. They're just really, really good And. They're got win the Super Bowl again. And, We. Just all have to, to come to grips with That. As for the Saints, We might've gotten ahead of ourselves. Yeah. It looks like two games into the season. You Can still feel good about That. You Can. Just close your eyes. Drift back to That World. Yeah. Go back three weeks ago. And just bet. Like, yeah, We might bet the best team in the NFL Or. It turns out That. You played against the Panthers. Yeah. He played against the Panthers And. Then you beat the Cowboys who might not bet Good Derek car also. I is He trying to break a record for highest balls thrown That. That Pass. That He threw was sick though. He Did a couple where He just, yeah. It was, I don't know what He just put so much air On.


It's crazy. I think That one He had to where He got the oblique injury. Yeah. He said That. He He hurt himself when He threw It. Not when He got hit. Or not when He hit the ground. Mm. So He He fucked up his oblique. They couldn't shoot It up. He's got try to play, I think. But I, he's a tough guy. I don't think he's ever missed a game due to injury. But On That one play It might have been the highest ball of the year. And He dropped It perfectly in the bucket. It was a very hard catch. So the, the receiver didn't come down with It. But yeah, the Chiefs He had a cool play last night. Or, the, the Saints had a cool play last night. Yeah. Maybe the best play where They had Saunders That made That interception in the end zone. Big boy. Big boy. 320 pounds tucking the ball, carrying He, switched the ball to his outside arm. He looked awesome. And carried It down the field. That was a great, great play.


And the fact That He wears number 50. Yeah. I think That makes him look so much faster. When He was returning, I was like, is That a linebacker? We? It's also the fattest Number. Yes. We. I I would say 50 is a linebacker number though. But It's also the fattest number. On a fat guy. It looks because It Squishes. Yeah. It squishes. t make him look fatter. But It also makes him look faster at the same time. He was fast. Yeah. He was, He was 17 miles per hour. I think It's crazy. So yeah. Chiefs are just, do you see It, Hank? Do you see It watching the Chiefs? You're like, oh yeah, I've seen this before. Yeah. I hate It. It's, it's, they're like, oh, Patrick Mahomes. How's We got Get outta this one. Oh, there It is Again. And got, it's like picking up these trash wide receivers. That were bad for other teams. Like Ju Schuster. Yeah.


Weapon. Yeah. He was horrible. That's all he's got do. They're running like a million tight ends. On the field. They. Pick up whoever They want. Yeah. And. They're got bet. Good. Yeah. It's, it's like, just slot him in. Andy Reid He gets bored sometimes with, with just beating teams regularly. So He has to run the play where He is doing. Like Travis Kel with an RPO inside the five yard line. Which worked. Yeah. And He does. I mean, Travis Kelsey's rugby pitch That He had was awesome. That was a perfect rugby play. It was a pin. And pass. He caught the ball, attacked the defender, waited for two defenders to commit to him. And then threw It out sideways. It's beautiful to watch when It works. Yeah. And. Travis Kel has been, he's been On That longer than I have. The, the downfield laterals. Like he's been doing That for like seven, eight years in the league.


But it's a perfect play. And when It works, 'cause the defense collapses. On the ball carrier. You got a guy On the outside And. When you have a guy That Can throw It like That toss It under hand. That went like probably 12 yards in the air. It's a, it's a beautiful play. and more teams need to start doing It. Yeah. Yeah. It was, they're just They. Just find ways, And, they're bet than everyone. And We just have to all deal with It. Because now this year it's different than last year where last year They were showing struggles. And, it's like, oh, now they're got have to go On the road. This year They have not been super They. They started being super explosive last night for the First time offensively. Mahomes looked not at his best, but It, they're five. And. Oh, And. it feels like they're their best is coming.


So watch out for That. Yeah. I, I Can hold two different thoughts in my head at the same time when I watch the Chiefs And That one is We are very lucky to watch this team. 'cause this team is awesome. They're so fun. And. Then at the same time, I'm like, enough enough. Yeah. Let somebody else have a turn. Yeah, right. Exactly. But, but still, I'm like, yeah, this is great football That we've never seen before. Yeah, exactly. It's, it's crazy. Chiefs are just, they're just That much bet than everyone. Alright, so we're got take we're got do some playoff baseball. We're got bring On Max. We're got bet in On. Zoom for a second. And. Then we're got do some college football talk. Okay. Before We Get to baseball, We have breaking moose.


Breaking moose. That That might bet the best cow he's ever done. That is a very exciting cow. And That sounds like a cow who has a new quarterback. Drake May is going to start. Pretty much everything Hank said was wrong. There was a mutiny They Call. That wish casting. I think when you just say what you, what you want to have happen. Yeah. Like the coach throwing a challenge flag On a replay where you know He is wrong. Hank, you are going to watch NFL football On Sunday with a new quarterback. And. We're wearing the throwbacks, which is exciting. Wow. Wait, what kind of throwbacks?


The Red throwbacks. Oh. Oh. The real throwbacks And. You're playing the Texans. That is not as exciting, So No, it'll bet. Fine. I watched my rookie quarterbacks go against Texas. It went great. Yeah. They And with a bad offensive line too. They don't really like to pressure the quarterback That much. Oh boy. Yeah. That's a, that's an interesting move. But I mean, I guess, you know, it's exciting. The Mutiny It was a muti. Yeah. It He works. It was A Mutiny And. Then there's reports I saw Rossini say That. There's, you know, people in the league saying He should have been starting the whole time. Did He say you saw a Sini say That. Or. You saw a Sini. I saw Rossini. Sini. Okay. I mean, He sh we're got talk to Troy Aikman about It, about starting Rick quarterbacks.


But That was my point when I talked, when I said It On Sunday. Like if your whole idea is That, you can't start 'em behind this offensive line. That means you can't start 'em this year. And. That's crazy. See you got start 'em And Now. We are And. Now I listen now you Get. This is fun though. Oh yeah. We have the, the Patriots bear. I think it's Patriots Bears. Patriot Or Bears Commanders back to back weeks. It's Wild. Rookie. The gauntlet. rookie quarterbacks. So now, but dude, Hank, this makes your Sundays exciting. Now. You'll bet here every Sunday for the kickoff.


Yeah. I'm scared Or. Yeah. I Can tell You're not excited about this. You're scared. He's scared. Why? You can't live scared. Don't bet. Scared And. Anyone didn't hurt at any time. Don't bet. Scared rookie quarterbacks end up being great And. Then They make you happy all the time. You, you could, you could roll your ankle walking off a curb. Yeah. I mean, I'm excited. We're got probably Get. No, you know what, we're got crazy. We're got shock. The world. We're Got shock. The world It. It's crazy. Like, Hank, even in your position, if you know That, the season's not got work out. We in the long term, having a rookie quarterbacks is fun. The, I I wanna see Jolt out of you. Yeah. This is the Are you dead? Yeah. I, I think He, honestly, I think he's dead as a sports fan. I think He wanted Drake may to never play. Yeah. Just happened. So He could bet like We who We have Drake may It's hard to get excited watching this team's off.


I guess maybe May will fix everything. Yet Drake May's got fix everything. He's Not got fix everything. But You Get to see a rookie quarterbacks. That's what He's point's got do. Hank He is I And. Listen, maybe this is presumptuous of me to make these wild predictions. I do think Drake may will try to throw to a wide receiver. That would bet fun if He has time. Yeah. Right. So That would bet fun. That would bet fun. Yeah. I mean if We Can beat beating the Bears would bet fun beating anyone would bet fun. Why'd you sing? Let the Bears. Yeah. What the fuck? Who who just said it's coming up? I don't think we're got beat the Texans. I'll say That not with That attitude. You're Right. Maybe you guys wear the Letterman jackets this time. Yeah. Airplane should We You Should bet so Pumped.


If if the Patriots beat the Texans We should release the T-shirt. Oh yeah. We should The Drake may Henry Lockwood t-shirt. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think We Can 'cause of Drake may, but I guess what do you mean? I mean, you guys are got release It at some point. I don't, it's insane. But I feel like this would bet caused to do It. Right? I'd never want It to get released. I think it's a crazy T-shirt to ever even bet made. But I know you're got release It at some point. So I'd rather you just Do It Get way. Iactually like the idea of never It, but just, just holding It over Hank's head. Like maybe we'll release It. Hank, You should bet. Excited. This is not what I expected outta you. I'm what did you Expect? I a rookie quarterbacks starting is an exciting thing when your team stinks.


I don't think it's going to make our team stink. That much less. I guess it's The, yeah. Still He He looking At this in the wrong perspective of he's not got save your season. The Patriots aren't got win a Super Bowl this year. They're probably not got go to the playoffs this year. But you have a rookie quarterbacks drafted. What? Third overall, third overall pick starting for your team. I, you know what Hank's problem is? His tolerance has gotten too high. His tolerance has gotten too high. Where he's, he's had all these championships. He was On the float in the parade. He got to bet the keeper of the lighthouse. Now, the things That should make a normal sports fan happy. Like seeing their First round quarterback start a game. That doesn't even register. On the scale for Hank It. It's, I I also think He just doesn't, so It doesn't matter.


The team is irrelevant at this point in this, in this season. Okay. The, the team is irrelevant. What's relevant is That. You just need him to look like good And progress. That's where the excitement comes from. Like, I saw Mitch had a bad First start. Do you remember Justin Fields's? First start against the Browns. That was the worst. First start ever. But It was still exciting to bet. Like, ooh, maybe next week. Yeah. You see And, then you just like It little, You, you see like two good throws in That. First start. Yeah. And. You're like, oh, We Can work with That. Little Steps forward And. You Get excited about the future. That's what It is. It's the future. It's not That now it's the future. Hank, pick yourself up. Alright. It's the future. The future.


Yeah. You don't believe That, you Don't. I'm excited at all. You're, I think you're bummed out. This is the only thing That could possibly make this season exciting for you is to put Drake May in beating The Bengals was exciting. Yeah. Winning the First game of the year was exciting. I think. Hank, You were almost, you know what? All the way sidebar almost back in Sidebar. I don't think Hank believes in Drake May. No, I don't think so. Yeah. And. So that's why he's afraid to watch him. Right? That's bad heavy balls. If He, If He believed in them, He would bet pumped You guys under, I mean, I guess It. I I people are got bet mad. The, our team sucks. Our s And line Is horrible. That's All Drake could bet. Best quarterback of all time. Tom Brady could bet the quarterback of this team.


And. But most rookie quarterbacks And are On shitty teams. CJ Stroud, shitty team. Most rookie quarterbacks are On. Shitty team is about watching him. And being like, Ooh, That was a nice throw. Ooh, That was a nice play. Ooh, he's getting bet. Ooh, We just won a game with him. Ooh, there's, oh, he's hitting the wide receiver. See if Hank truly believed in his guy, He would bet pumped to see this because He would watch Drake. May the Vikings He was got do something awesome. And. Then He would know. You don't think he's Got do Anything awesome. He. He doesn't, He doesn't believe in him. You don't believe he's got do Anything awesome. He doesn't, He doesn't have That excitement at All. I'm excited to see. I'm excited to see. No. Yeah. Listen, it's also like you want him to start now. Because if He is good, And, he's the guy next year is like, then you build up.


Whereas if you did the, the Henry Lockwood strategy of keeping your quarterback in a bubble wrap, And never taking him out. You would just bet starting fresh next year. Aaron Rogers, Tom Brady, Jordan Love, like people don't start their First year. And their final They Named three guys. I guess Patrick Mahome too. Shit, those Are, but that's not always the case. I don't think It's crazy to bet. Like, it's not a, the worst thing in the world. If He doesn't play That much. His First sheet. It's Not. But those guys also, wait, hold On. I know what my response was. Those guys also had Hall of Famers, Or, Alex Smith. Not a Hall of Famer, but And, I guess Hall, hall of Fame person. Really good quarterbacks in front of them. And. That's why They didn't start. Not because They had Jacoby. Brit.


Aaron Rogers had Brett Favre, Jordan Love had Aaron Rogers. Tom Brady had Drew Bledso. Patrick Moses had Alex Smith. Those were good quarterbacks. Fair, Fair. That were starting for a reason. Not Jacoby, Brit Fair. That was good. I I I recovered That. You don't even care. He almost had us, But He doesn't even And. it goes down to a lack of belief in your guy. Hank, Are you upset at yourself because you were in the camp of don't stardom. And, if you had been in the camp of stardom today, would bet feeling vindicated. What? I'm just, I I I opened up my, my group chat from my friends from home to see what the, what the feelers are. And one mayday all caps. That's good. We. You got come up with a bet name than That.


Mayday is actually a bad thing. That's what you say right before a catastrophic. SA real. Yeah. Hate the move. He is not ready. Oline can't stop a beach ball. We have no weapons when He doesn't play We. Everyone's got, say He is Drake. May is Mac Jones 2.0. You're paying Jacoby to get beat up. And let Meg develop. That's what we're making the playoffs for. Why put wait, Drake may harm way afraid of Mac Jones. Kind of true. Hank look at the schedule. Jacob's slower than God. Washington Oline not great. Chicago. Oin not great. Yes, those rookie cubies are fine Facts. That's true. Jacobi, Brit, like sacks are partly On the quarterback. And holding onto the ball too long. And also like no one if you, if you watch them, no one was expecting Jacobi, Brit to throw the ball with any type of like, oh, he's got burn us for like a 15 yard out.


Or something. The defenses, were all just standing right at the line. And, just like your old line is got look. Bet with Drake May behind, behind center the, oh, hey. Oh, memes, hater memes just went like this. Oh man, Hank here. All right, here's what Can, Get you excited? Okay. Texans game probably not got go Great Jaguars game. Probably got go bet. Then what if you beat the Jets at home? What if you beat the Jets at home? Now we're talking Patriots are one in 10 since the lighthouse has been built at Home Point. What if you beat the, the Jets at home? Hank. Hank, how excited would you bet if you Get to memes will probably try to throw a punch at you. But I will do my best to bet there to catch That Punch. Hank also, think about this.


Even if you don't beat the Texans, every good throw That Drake may makes in That game is got bum memes out. Big Cat. Yes. He's, you guys Got bet. He's got bet like shit. He's got another good quarterback. And. My team is just firing everyone. Do you Remember the preseason We were about to go. I think We were about to set up for maybe Doug's Or something. And memes was like slow And. I was like, what are you doing? Memes. And He said I have to watch Drake Ma to make sure He is not good. Yeah, you have memes. On the ropes. True. But David Andrews is out for the season. See, And He was, he's On the rope. Good line. Yeah. He's On the ropes. And Fight back against when you got about Me thought tank. No, David Andrews no use memes. No one On. The On the line Go after memes.


He's right about David Andrews. But I if We Can again. I said That in the good year. Beat the Jets. Beat the Dolphins. Beat the bills. Yeah. Rivalry games Beat the Bears. Whoa. Rivalry games. Yeah. Beat the Bears. What are you doing? What does That mean? Memes. You're scared. That Drake May is got bet. Good. Beat them too. You're, you're scared. Drake May's got bet. Good. He. He's not He. He might bet. Good. Oh Yeah, but you're afraid. Oh, he's scared. I I don't know if you believe he's got bet. Good. But you are definitely afraid of Have to bet. Afraid. You have to respect the thought. That He might bet. Good. You're 100% afraid. That He could bet. Good. 75% He could bet Good. But no offensive line could break him. Yes. But They could probably Get a new offensive line.


Can. You Get a quarterback that's 20 years younger. No, but in my experience with no offensive line, it's very hard to Fix. It takes Years, years, years. Unless you have a younger quarterback. That. Can escape. That. Yeah. Who Can move. Unlike a 40-year-old quarterback who's coach killer And. One foot. Do you remember That one time? Oh, this is, all right. So this is what We got do to get Hank up. Yes. We got bring memes down. It's all about That's what it's all about for Patriot. If you can't Get excited because you're not got win Super Bowl this year. I Get It standards are a little bit higher in Boston. It's like championship Or bust. But if you're a Patriots fan, just think about how sad it's got. Make your enemies. What did It take to get Hank's swagger back?


It took shitting all over memes. Yeah. To bring him down. You Can. You Can snatch the future of Every Jetstone. Yeah. He Hank's smiling. You're getting your swagger back. I mean, you, you don't need to get your swagger back. You had Summer of Hank like two days. But think, Yeah. Think, think about all the Jets fans. And, all the shit. They talked when They got Aaron Rogers. Guess what if Drake May goes out there, And lights It up this weekend. You Can just laugh at them. And bet. Like, look what you guys sold yourself. On. And. Look what I got. And. Hey, you beat the fuck outta. Here's another thing. If Drake may turns out to not bet. Good. It's not like PF it. And. I are got laugh at you because our guys are good. Yeah. But That again, We didn't have the choice. So We Are Yeah. Yeah. Right. No, But We. What if Bo Nicks And, jj And JJ McCarthy are also good.


That then would hurt And. Michael Pennix. That would hurt. I mean, yeah. I I would imagine Spencer Rattler. Spencer Rattler. He's probably got Bet. Good. Do you think this is because they're wearing the throwbacks And. If They like win, they're got sell a shit ton of Drake. Ma. Oh, Patriots. Throwbacks. I like That. You're right. Stawell. You're right. You're absolutely right. Because why won't you do It against the Jaguars? Let's see whose line is It Anyway, did It change draft Seven? It hasn't changed. It has not the two towns of Drake. May's worth zero points. That's fair. He's rookie court. That means He should have been starting. Yeah. Yeah. I think We Got every time I see the Patriots throwbacks too. I just think of That game against the Titans. Mm. Was That the snow game? Mm. You remember That quarter? Hank Six touchdowns in the First half Go mega Max On the On the Patriots this week Put him in the hungry dog.


Yeah. Believe. Believe. Mayday mayday Mayday Mayday may smash the button. Mayday Mayday. I said. All aboard the Mayflower And. That's what, oh, that's Good. That's good. Yeah. That's cute. That's good. That fits in nicely too. Yeah. Plymouth Rock. Yeah, that's good. Alright, let's kick It to ourselves for sure. Some playoff baseball. Talk with Max. Okay. Play off. Baseball. Max is in New York for the streams. Did Max, would you like us to start with the Phillies? Or We could end with the Phillies It. Doesn't matter Is That. We. I don't know which way.


You're the, you're the producer. Max. Why doesn't It matter? 'cause It doesn't matter. I don't know why you guys, I got onto this Zoom call. And, you just keep saying my name like That And. You've never done this before, ever. And for some reason today you decide That. It's, it's a good time to start doing this. It sounds like the breaking news. Cow is saying That Philadelphia lost. Yeah. No, but It sounds like it's not even, it's like a, like a, a cow that's dying. We. I guess the Phillies are dying. Yeah. Listen, I, I wanna bet Fair. I I agree with He. Makes a good point. Like, this series isn't about Max. It's not, but I, I do think That Max should start out.


Yeah. Okay. So Max, the Phillies are They dead. Yes. So it's over. Yeah. Alright. So That was the Philly's Met series? Yeah. I don't know. I I, I I think they're dead And then. They win. So that's why I got think That, they're dead. I, I had Hope Co coming into today. And. Then They died. I hope, going into day game one. And, then They died. And, I thought We were dead. And then We arose in game two for a little bit. So right now I just have to assume death. Yeah. We, your guy who is actually the grim reaper. Nick Castellanos did have a good quote. What was That noise?


I think That was my computer. Computer's updating Nick Castellanos. This is as close to death as we're going to get as a group. So, in a way, It should make us feel more alive. There you go. That's Justin, Jimmy Carter. That's huge. I Don't know what the fuck That means. And. What do you mean? They're, they're close to death. They, when you're, when you're as close to death as you could bet, you're also the most alive. Yeah. That doesn't really make sense. We Al Pacino told us different We. That's coming up not to get outta order. Yeah. So I max ever You have a near death experience. When you have a near death experience, you come back rejuvenated. Anything's possible. You wanna maximize your time.


Maximize. Let's do this. Max, Shut up. Alright, I got a couple questions for you. Max. First one. One. Can, you explain the hands, On the ears, like a little 5-year-old with a firetruck going down the street. Move That. You do when things go bad. I, I don't know. It's just like, I don't want to hear people cheering around me because I'm with a bunch of fucking Mets fans. And, it's like a, it's like a panic. It's like a, oh no, some this is bad. That's happening. Yeah. And. I don't, I don't know how to explain my actions in these times. And, you want me to explain, but I don't know what I'm, I don't know what I'm doing.


It's very adorable. It's it's great. It's so cute. It's not. No. Especially when you're, when you're sitting baby style And, you put your hands, On your ears. I love It. Yeah. It's so, so cute. You really are like, oh, here comes the firetruck. And. It's super loud. Everyone put your hands. On your ear. On your ears. Oh, it's 4th of July. It's not even the real fireworks. Someone just let off like a Roman candle Hands On your ears. It's like in something about Mary, when He won't let anybody touch his ears. And. Then Ben Stiller comes at the end. Got your baseball. Yeah. Okay. So That was question one. Question two. What are the vibes in That room? Tough, bad. It's just like, I, I don't, it's just like assuming loss.


Like the Mets. The Mets in the Phillies are just completely opposite teams though. The, the Phillies were tough. On Sunday, I don't know this. The, the Phillies are a soft baseball team. The Mets are a hard baseball team. They're a tough baseball team. They come back from things. And. The Phillies just don't, the Phil, like They just die. Yeah. I feel And Tomorrow. Bryce Harper tonight got mentally dominated at the plate. That. So That was the moment one at That. That was the moment. That the game. Like, oh, I texted you That. Yeah. Yeah. I We, I was texting. Max was like, this is the inning. And. You had two, you had lead off walk from Schwarber, then another walk. Two men, On no outs. Bryce Harper up Perfect time.


And He went three, three swings crumbled And, three rumble swings. Strike out And. The last One, the last swing That He had was maybe so bad feeble attempt I've ever seen to hit a baseball in the playoffs. And. Then the next And, then the next batter sucked. Cascianos hit That ball in the screws. And We got doubled up. And, there's nothing you Can do. He hit a line drive right at someone. It wasn't your night. Yeah. It wasn't your night. And And, Noah. He. Like you thought It was got bet a bad night for him when Alonzo hit the home run. And, whatever. It was the second inning. But He settled down. Obviously the They probably, I don't know if They kept a mi. He was not, He was what, like 80 pitches. So like you had to keep him in.


He Just always does That He He looks like good for fi five innings. And. Then you put em out for ano for the six And. Everything. Crumbles. And. Yeah, Because He was, He found his bunch Groms. But He just was walking everyone. Yeah. He found his groove. Where He had like what, seven, eight strikeouts. And He Had eight Ks. Yeah. Eight Ks And, five innings. Yeah. But He just That was tough. So And And the Mets credit to the Mets. They are It. Just We said It. For the last series, They just have That team of destiny feel where every big hit, every big like They got They got guys just stepping up in the right spots. Big strikeouts, They. Just, I, I don't know what It is. It's just you. You have That. Feel And. The the other team that's got That feel right now is the Padres, I would say where it's like the Padres.


Shut up. Hank We. The Padres do have That feel though, where They just keep getting big. I mean, by the way, it's a home run every night. And. It's Hanks Padres. Yeah. In a weird way, the way the Padres lost game two was almost bet because it's like They. Were just never in That game. And Or. No wait was It. What was game one Game. Lost game One. They Lost Game One. Game won game. Game game. Two by a million. Game two. That was the one where Machado threw the ball at the dugout. And. Then everything went nuts. And. They started throwing all That shit. On the field. I love They. On every, yeah. Love how mad the Padres make the Dodgers. Yes. And. That's why I love this series. I want this series to go back to la I'm rooting for San Diego. I think That, they're the most fun team to watch in baseball right now.


They've got like a, a great combination of guys. That, don't give a fuck. And are also simultaneously really, really good. So our friend Ryan Spader just tweeted this out. Pretty incredible. Fernando Tiz is batting at a clip where He is. He's got a 1.506 OPS. He's Homering in 12.2% of his plate appearances during his career, the post-season. He's the all time post-season leader in batting average OBP On base percentage slugging, OPS, And Home run percentage amongst people. That have at least as many plate appearance as He does. So He doesn't have a ton of plate appearances, but he's really fucking good. And He is also excellent at making people angry. Yeah. He's pissing everyone off.


And. That's like, that's what It feels like. It feels like the pottery. And. The Mets have the, have the team of destiny. The, the Indians. Or, sorry. The guardians. And the Tiger series has been awesome because it's just been great pitching. And s Scbu. Do you have a s Scbu? You need a s. Scbu. Max s Scbu. I would trust with my life. Yeah. We had a Scbu. That went seven. Seven. Scoreless. On Friday. And. Then We brought in a bowl. Or a bullpen. That just got fucking shelled. The second He came out. Yeah. So yeah, We have a fucking Scho balls. Scbu On Monday That outing, where He was like, there's just something about a guy who's shoving And. He is reveling in the moment. And. He's like, He was almost like, like whooping up the crowd to get louder.


And. Like every big strikeout, Or, double play. It was just, I love It. That's the best part about playoff baseball. Like big home runs, And ACEs, That, shove. Those are the two things. That, I'll just fucking give It to me all day, every day. That. I also love how excited the Tigers are to go back to Detroit. Yeah. They should They do Shit. They do. Sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make That about the Release. No, No, it's okay. You brought, it's okay. You asked. I did. I take It back. You asked, I asked My I I have, my only note from the pods game is That. John. Smoltz is everything. That That. Tony. Romo wishes. He was. Mm. John s sucks. Good. Good note. No, John Smoltz is, John Smolt is elite. Like He. He knows every pitch that's coming.


He calls It out. And. He's right. I agree with Max. Hank doesn't know Ball. I think John, I like John Smoltz. I like him as a pitcher. He's, he's confidently wrong. more than We are. Which is saying something We. Yeah, but He Is John Smoltz. He's like talking about what He, basically what He would bet the Vikings. And. He's one of the best pitchers of all time. So it's like, that's what he's saying. But t make sense Note. I'd rather hear That. I'd rather hear That. POV. Yeah. My my other note about Hank's Padres is That. They got 16 straight outs after the Grand Slam, which goes And. it proves Or Point, That Grand Slams are rally killers. You shouldn't hit 'em because then you Get everybody off the bases than it's hard to keep scoring runs. Yeah. But It was a It playoff.


Baseball has been awesome. 'cause It was won one all around until today. Obviously the Mets up two, one And, the Padres of two, one And. Then the Royals go into Yankee Stadium. And steal one. And, I just love this is, this is just Groundhogs Day for the Yankees. Like they're Yankees fans. Aaron Judge can't Get a big hit. John Carlo can't run. They're just, they're It. Just every year the same thing happens. And. They just, they're like, where are the stars? Why aren't the stars hitting a hundred home runs? And. It would bet very funny if the Royals, after all the Yankees fans talked about, like everything's set up perfectly for 'em. Astros are out. And who were, who else were They scared of who? Oh, the Oriole We. Not They weren't scared of the Orioles, but They were like, oh, Astros, And, Orioles gone.


It's now just us. Versus the AAL Central would bet. Very funny if the Royals found a way to win this series. Pickett, I have a question. Yeah. Is, is Aaron Judge a true Yankee? So good. Good question. Thank you. I talked to our good friend Tommy Smokes last night. And. I said, do We have to take Aaron Judge's pin stripes away? And. He said, did He ever have them? Yeah, I don't think, I don't think He truly ever had the pin stripes, because I think They, I think what happened was Yankees fans gave him, They had the pinstripe discussion when He He hit the most home runs ever in the history of the American League. But I don't think He ever truly got to pen stripes. So He did have, I wanna say what was the postseason?


He had a postseason where maybe It was when They lost in the A LCS to the Astros. The year That They cheated. I feel like, I feel like He had a decent postseason for Or. Maybe a co a couple games, big hits. Yeah. I'm looking right now in That Houston. He had three home runs in the A LCS That year. So I feel like And the And. Then the next year when They lost to the Red Sox in, in five, He had three home runs to start That series in a five game series. So I feel like He was given his pin stripes maybe like, Hey man, this guy's got bet incredible. He's been hitting a couple big home runs. But yeah, He is not, he's not doing It this year. I Don't think he's a true Yankee Big.


Cat, which is so funny to say because he's objectively one of the best hitters of his entire generation. Maybe one of the best hitters. At least On Pace to bet one of the best hitters in Major League baseball history. But not a true Yankee 'cause. True Yankees. They Get It done in October. They do. That's a fact about true Yankees. Look at the calendar. What does It say? It's October. I'm looking right now. His batting average in the playoffs career is 2 0 8. Oof. Yikes. It's Mr. June. He is Mr. June. So yeah, I mean, I just And John, Carlos, Dan, like, I don't know. I don't know if They could do a designated runner rule. But They should think about It. The guy can't run. It's crazy watching him try to run.


You guys wanna, if He tries to run, that's when He starts pulling stuff. Yeah. We, you got say, Hank, you Wanna predict the four games today, Wednesday. Yeah, let's do It. Ooh. I think Philly's got It. Same, I think. No doubt. Who's On the bump Max. Ranger. Suarez. He was the best pitcher in baseball. The First half, then He got hurt. And, He came back. And. He has like a, like a about above six ERA since he's been back. And, you're going up against Quintana. Yeah. He's not, he's not That. Scary. No. Yeah. We. Can win. But it's got bet, it's got bet a shootout. And We. Like, didn't use our best relievers today. I think in preparation for tomorrow being a big bullpen game. Okay. So yeah, tomorrow's high.


Leverage everything. Yeah. I mean, yeah. You, you ha is It must win. Or can't lose All of the above. I mean, both. They're got lose, but They can't lose. Oh no. Max And. I'm got bet sitting in That. Fucking, I, I don't know why I came out here. This is, I'm, I'm over for two for flying out. And coming to the, coming to these fucking streams. And. Neither of them were particularly close. I liked It when you said That, you're not good in any room. I thought That was, That was a, a fair observation to your point. Have you considered watching outside? We talked about That. I, I don't Get. I also, people say That people are, are like, what?


Why the fuck did you go to New York? You, you're just got, you're just got lose in New York. You wanted to, I don't Get to choose where I go. That's a fact. Everything, everything is is a puppet Here. Here's a little behind the scenes of how bars stool works. Dave texted And was like, max needs to bet On the streams. And. I said, We need Max for PMT. At least On Sunday. And We have some stuff. We're taping On Monday. So He Can probably bet back there. On Wednesday. So the original idea was Max would go On Saturday And, then He would fly back. On Wednesday after Sunday's. Incredible game. Dave texted me, And said, I wish Max was On the stream. Which was basically saying, Hey, go talk to Max.


I said to Max, you, you Get to decide. But I obviously know, like if I, I said to him, if I were in your shoes, I would go And. He was like, yeah, I'm got go. 'cause he's a company man. So yeah, He He doesn't have much of a say. This is how We, like, these are the moments. That make us different than everyone else. These are the moments That, We have to capture. Especially when We have two, you know, rival cities going up against each other. So credit to Max. He's a company man. If Dave Cared about his Philly's future, He would send you back. Oh, should I? I'll send That text in the morning. Max. Max. Here's the thing. I'm Okay, go ahead. I'm Willing to do whatever I'm asked of me, but I keep losing here.


Okay, max, think about this. What about watching in the hallway tomorrow? Put a, put a office chair in the hallway. You're technically not in a room. I'm fine with That too. Alright, So try That. I think That might change the vibes. I I'm fine with That Because you could still They They. They do have like the outdoor, the outside Thing as We And. You Can still have max moments out there. Like And, And, And. You Can come in to, to make cameos. But I think you're sitting in Frank's Seat anyway today. Yeah. I I mean, I was just sitting where, where I was told to bet sitting. Yeah. Come in. Okay. Do you want me to send That text tomorrow?


I'm happy to send That text being like, Hey, I Don't want It to look like, I'm like, I'm trying to leave. Yeah, you're right. 'cause you, you aren't like, you're a company man. Hank, you wanna send That text? You want me to tweet him right now? Yeah, tweet him. He's not got see That Tweet him We. who have pick him tomorrow. We. Can. Bring It up. Oh, We do have pick him tomorrow. But that's probably not enough time for Max to get back. Max book a flight just in case. We'll figure this out. Okay. Okay. All either way. Don't, don't die yet. Max. Lot of playoff baseball left. Maybe we'll just watch It. On the plane. What? All right, so let's predict these, let's predict these games tomorrow.


All right. I got Phillies. All right. And. We have all four. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going, I'm going. Phillies, Royals, guardians, pods. Okay, I'm got go. Phillies pods. Royals, tigers. I'm going. Phillies. Dodgers. We. Don't do That. Don't do That. We can't. No. I Get to go. I Get to Go. Okay. Yeah, sure. True. True. I got, I got Phillies. Dodgers. 'cause I wanna see It go back to La And. And And. Also, because you don't, you cashed outta That. And Hank. No, no. I listen. It's true. Straight up.


I want to see the Padres win the World Series. No, no. Deep down you don't. That's That. No, I do That. That's, that's absolutely false. That's, that's not true. Big Cat. It's not true. Because it's, I cashed That out so I could put the money On the Travis Hunter future. Correct. Which I do not. You could just like Paused a little bit more money. But Still you don't. I Get The, I Get the feeling of being right though That. So earlier, On, the Padres, you Listen, I, you could say whatever you want. I've done It before where I've cashed out future. I'm rooting a hundred percent against That team after I Cashed. You think? You think I'm rooting for both You And And Hank to lose your futures. No, You're not. It's not us. It's the fact. That, you cashed out. You have to root against you.


I if cash out, you have to root against That team. You're project you would root against your team. I will. I'm telling, Telling you That, I have done It. And. I, you, that's a human nature. I am not do That. I don't, I don't feel That at all. That's a, that's I deep down. You don't want the Padres to win. No. I swear. That would've been A swear. You had a great number too. Swear, I'm, I'm rooting for the Padres. Love the brown And yellow. You don't see a brown And yellow combination. A lot. Sports. It's good colors. Especially the pink And. The yellow They pop. When They wear those as the accessories, they're a fun team. They, piss everybody off. They make me happy. There's no way. Same. Maybe Jayden just turned over a new leaf in my head. We're being optimistic about things I'm choosing to embrace. We're not talking about Jaden right now. Shut The fuck up, max. Alright, what was your, what was Your last name then?


I got the Tigers, then I got the, the Yankees. The Yankees. All right. Max. Max. I will go Mets. I will go Royals. I thought you We got go for Mets. What I should say, Mets. Mets. Mets. Mets. Sure.

Although he's been, We already talked about the Jets, but he's been in Jets land today. It's been a big day for his Jets. Memes. Would you like to twist a knife? You are a Mets fan.


I am a Mets fan. I this team is very special. That was, That was a fantastic game today. But I'm afraid the Phillies are probably got win Today. And, you don't want It to go back to the bank. Nos. Matts Mets. Mets. No. Nope. Phillies. Philly. Phillies. Mets. Mets. Mets, Mets. I, I don't, I I actually want my, my prediction change to the Mets. 'cause I actually now That, I think about It. The Phillies are dead. Phillies Are dead. No, No. Yeah. They are, They are, let's bet. Honest. They. We want We. Wanna try to get Max back? But they're dead. I Want Max to say No. No. I'm s Oh no, I meant I wanted to get him back Metaphor. Like, I wanted to like Get his spirits back up. Oh, I You want him to, you don't want him coming back here?

Is there, so is there like, is something broken? That? You don't want 'em to stay? No. The, thats keep winning. Just stay in New York. Yeah. I think Max, you could definitely just come back. And bet. Like I'm, I've only won And. Just sit right back down. On the ground. Right in the corner of the gambling cave with your hands over your ears. Like a big baby. And. Watch the Phillies win.


The hands will bet over my ears regardless. Yeah. Okay. Anything else from baseball? It's been awesome. I love playoff baseball. Yeah. There's nothing like It. And. I Pause po to the favors to win It. All Phils are in dead. Lasts to win. It. All favorites. The Padres are the favorites. Yeah. We. 'cause they're, they're up to one. I'm So happy. No. To win It All. Yeah. No, I know. They're up to one. The only other team up to one is the Mets. And, the Padres would've home Field advantage. So t make sense? I think They would. Yeah, They would. Yeah. They Definitely would. What are the Phillies? Win? It all Plus a thousand DraftKings drafts. I kind of, I kinda like That DraftKings Max.


The bats just come alive. Fight Max. Don't let 'em Get back to the bank. No. Matts Matts, Matts Matts. No. When It goes bad, It just It goes so bad. And. it was such a beautiful scene at City Field tonight. That That, sunset They were showing was incredible. Crisp in the air. Yeah. Mets fans are long suffering fans. I also landed at City Field, which is Or LaGuardia, which is right next to City Field. And. it was just a bunch of people flying in to go to the Mets game. And. Then It was like, I'm literally looking at the game. And. I'm flying here to go watch the game. And in a room full of people.


That aren't Phillies fans? That. So That That crossed my mind today. For the record. You're talking about the Mets fans? Yeah. Not your, not Rone, Smitty, GIA, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I love the, I love the Philly crew today. Yeah, yeah. No, you have a good Philly crew, but you It is, you're, you're playing an away game against. Correct. Because It is the Mets, the aliens of Barstool. And, the Mets crew. They're, they're very entertaining. But They do kind of own That, That gambling cave. So you're walking into their place. Correct. Max, who's the most annoying person that's rooting for the Mets that's in That room? None of em. Bosco. I'll say Bosco is, yeah, Bosco is an easy one to say.


Bosco. Bosco. Thank Bosco. Shout out Bosco for showing up. Thought for a second. He wasn't got show up. Don't say That. What? Say That We who got there at ending three. Tough came already started. He came up to me after the game. He's like, how much shit do you think I'm got Get for coming here for showing up late? And. Blos A blows. He didn't have Blos. It was a weird ass starting time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No one knew about It. I don't blame, I don't blame Bob. You didn't. I had my time zones wrong. And. I thought It was at an hour earlier. But if It was my team, I would not have, I would've had That thing printed in my brain There. Rider Hank coming up.

What do We talk about now? Sports. Okay. Let's talk some college football. PFT. We had the weekend of chaos. It was awesome. Apple picking weekend. You look at the slate, there's not That many big games. Oh, next week is got bet. Incredible. And. Then We had number one. Alabama loses number four. Tennessee lose. Number nine. Mizou. Missouri loses number 10. Michigan loses number 11. USC loses And. It feels like we're in a new era of college football, where these teams with the transfer portal, because like Vandy I think had 43 new players. The c the floor of a Vandy has been raised.


The floor of some of these teams in the Power five have been raised. Where you Can see these type of upsets, And, chaos, And. Now Vandy has the First time they've ever beaten the number one team in the country. They were ing 60 against top five opponents in their last 60 going against them. It was an awesome, awesome. That's a trend. That's a trend at That point. That's a very big trend. It was an awesome game. They were non-competitive. They were always They. They didn't win an SEC game last year. I think They, the closest They were, was like of 15 point loss to Auburn. They. That was an awesome, awesome game Ex like whole thing. Nashville. The, the putting the goalposts into the river. Diego Pavia was awesome.


He's the best. I I loved him last year at New Mexico State. But It was cool to see. Like, maybe we're getting a little shift where everyone, maybe there's a little bit more parody. Yeah. In, in college football. I, I, I guess we'll find out. But right now, this season, it's still early. But the chaos And the fact That We don't know who's good in college football right now. Yeah. It reminds me of That 2007 season. Yes. And. If you, if you don't know about the 2007 season, go back. Watch. There's a bunch of videos, On, YouTube, That, break down how crazy That season was with all the upsets. That happened week after week after week after week. We're On pace for That right now. It's probably not got last to the same extent That 2007 did. But the upsets are incredible.


Vanderbilt, I love the, I love the new tradition, which is if you have a river in your town Yeah. And. You beat a good team. You're tearing those fucking things down. You're putting 'em into a river. Yeah. They belong in the river right now. And, They walked like two miles with the goalposts. There was some sick ass night vision cameras too from saw helicopters I That where you saw all the vanity students like crawling down the steps to just very calmly And, very They were very organized with how They got those goalposts in the river. But it's just like a mindset. That We have right now where We win football game. Go post Go River. And And. It's, it's so much fun because we've had all this, you know, whether bet, bet conference, realignment, NIL, transfer portal, all this hand wringing, That college football, the playoff expanding all this handwringing in the college football is got lose some of its luster.


And what made It unique And? Yes, We did lose some things. But I truly believe with, with the NIL And transfer portal, I think you're got to get these teams, the Vandy of the world, being able to take a little slight step up And bet competitive in these type of games. That you didn't have before. It's, it's kinda like And. it feels like every It feels like there's, it's not, it's not like It was 10 years, Or the last 10 years where there's three teams. That, Can win the title And. No one else like you, you could, you could put your, your you life, On, It, these three teams, no one else has a chance. It feels like there is a maybe 10 teams right now. That. Yeah. I guess On the right day. They could win this. Win the playoff. Because if you're, if you're a big school, you're also using the transfer portal with the exception of Clemson.


But I think That, the smaller schools, Or, the traditionally weaker schools have a much bigger upside to the transfer portal being able to access those guys. Yeah. We. You know what I'm saying? We, it's, it's the, it's also the depth chart where it's, you know, guys would go to Alabama, sit for a couple years, then Get their chance. Yeah. Now maybe they're going somewhere. And, they're not getting their chance right away. And, they're very talented. And. They're like, I'm got go somewhere else. Or. On. The flip side. A guy at the lower schools. The lower schools are probably the ones That, Get hurt from all of this because a lot of like guy goes to a Mac. Or A Sunbelt, yeah. Plays for a few years then is like, I got one year left. I'm got try to go play, you know, at the Power five level. Right. But if, if a vanity, what I'm saying, And Diego Pave like, He goes up.


And wins That game. They don't win That game without him. On On Saturday. Yeah. So the, the the smaller big group of four schools, right. They're going to benefit from It because They Can Get access to good players. Correct. The top schools are got benefit too, but maybe not to the same extent. That. A Vandy would benefit We. They don't Need They. Proportionate We do It differently too. They, their recruiting is always Bet, bet Elite And at a different level. Yeah. And. But It was just, I don't know. I think college football's in a great spot. There's chaos everywhere. And, We didn't even mention like without Cam Ward another transfer. Miami would've been added to That list too, because That was an insane comeback. Late night against Cal. But They have been On the ropes two weeks in a row. And.


It's just every Saturday feels like you Get one of these moments. That is just so much fun. And, I'm, I'm just very excited about the future of college football when we've spent so many years being like, it's all dying. It's all got suck. Like the, the sport We loved is gone. We conference Realignment does suck. I, I don't like That, but it's got happen no matter what. And there's nothing you Can do about It. So just put That aside, put the systemic stuff aside. And, then just embrace all the chaos that's happening. Yeah. Also embrace the hog. I love That quote from Sam Pittman. Oh, We Got, so, yeah, We got embrace the hog. Tennessee's got this is, I, I feel for Tennessee fans, they've had elite, elite offenses. And And, suspect defenses, And.


Then this year, They have an awesome defense. And Nico's a freshman. And He had freshman moments running outta bounds. On fourth, And five to end the game. Joe Milton did That. Yep. Joe That was The That against exact same Joe. One of the other greatest quarterbacks we've ever seen. That was tough And, I do feel for Tennessee fans, their, obviously their season's not over. But when you lose That game now, It, It just everything gets a little tighter coming up where you might not have the safety net. That's really what's happening here. And, I love That part of It because the argument That, the regular season won't matter anymore with 12 teams in the playoffs. It's just a safety net. Like Tennessee has to win one of their big games coming up. Yeah. I Mean It It is good. I think for what We have for, for future football this year. It's, it's good.


That We have the playoff because That That loss to Van would've been disqualifying for Alabama. And We wouldn't Get to see them play in any real serious postseason games. Probably We. Yeah. Because Saban would've just Nick Saban. He He would've just gotten On a show. And been like, we're one of the best four teams in the country. And. Then They would've been like, Yeah, you're probably right. Also, Nick Saban with an all time quote before the game saying That Vandy was an easy place to play. He's Right. He's for him, And for him, for Nick Saban doesn't lose That game for No. Nick Saban would not He would He would have the stadium Firebombed in the fourth quarter if They were losing. I, I think I saw a stat. I think Vandy scored like 16 total points against Nick Saban ever. Yeah. I I They didn't play every year. 'cause they're obviously not in the same side. But It was, It was something ridiculous.


They They never They were never competitive against Nick Saban, Alabama teams. Yeah. The last six quarters for De Bore have been a nightmare. Yeah. Nick Saban never had six, six quarters. Like That. Yeah. But We We had, so yeah, We had Tennessee That was tough to have Nico go down. Mizzou They were underdogs. Yeah. But now Texas a And M's. Back in the picture, they're backing like, Hey, if They win one of their big games coming up, They could bet in the playoff. Which is crazy because that's again, That. You, you would usually disqualify off of a loss And then say, oh That bet luck next year. Now everyone gets back in here. And. Then you had Michigan, who They probably are out. Yep. And. USC, who's probably out as We probably is never in.


But That was a tough loss against Minnesota. Where they're up, you know, seven going into the fourth quarter. And Minnesota just grinds em. Yeah. And And. Big JMU News. Kurt Ti And, his Indiana Hoosiers are looking pretty good for the playoff right now. What about real jm? No, I'm talking about j I'm talking about Kurt sti. Former JMU coach. The Hoosiers look like they're for real. Got It. I like them a Lot. I apologize for your, your JMU losing. Yeah. So I, I had hopes of the offs. I was the Vikings, the offs. Just being in the playoffs would've been nice. And. it was got bet an uphill battle, but did not expect to lose That game. It was bad. It was, It was bad. Play calling team looked very outta sorts compared to how Sharp They had looked in in weeks prior. I don't know what happened with That. It was just, It was all around Bat our quarterback, I don't know if he's injured, had some accuracy issues.


It was bad. It was a bad night. I didn't, but at the very least, It was not the big upset That happened. I was very thankful. That, Alabama lost to Vanderbilt because it's like, okay, We. Yeah. We might've lost his 18 And a half point favorites, but at least we're not a Alabama. Yeah. I mean those, yeah. Right. Alabama was the story no matter what. Yep. We also had, by the way, you, you mentioned conference realignment. I just wanna say I feel really bad for James Franklin. I don't know if you guys saw this, but apparently in their upcoming game against USC, the State College airport is not big enough to fly them out of. So They have to go to Harrisburg. So James Franklin did a press conference. And was like, yeah, We have to bet On a bus for like an hour.


Oh my God. This is the new conference in Line. I hope he's okay. It is really tough. That's a lot of sitting. That's really, really tough. An hour. Hour. Yeah. That's tough. I Think, let's see, I'm got find out exactly how far It is from State College PA to Harrisburg. 'cause It could bet more than an hour. But it's just very funny. That, the fans are, are having to come up with a new normal where Cal And Miami are a conference game. I Will never stop laughing when I see Cal playing against Miami for the Atlantic Coast Conference. The, the the signs at at game day for Cal were so funny when people were actually getting mad online. Yeah. There was someone who said the Algorithm. I think It was OT for highs person.


That was a great one. And, They got very upset about That. That Was a great one. There were so many trolls. On there. Alright. Harrisburg, And State College. Oh my gosh. Hour And 28 And. That's probably right now you're looking That up at 1230 in the afternoon. On the east coast. Yeah. I don't think there's got bet much traffic in That Is It. Bet, bet. Rush hour. No, I don't, don't think Rush hour got to Harrisonburg Get instead of traffic. But yeah, that's brutal. We also should, We should mention Travis Hunter had a bi week. He should bet the Heisman. But Ashton Gente is God damnit. He's really good. He's So good. It's insane. It's insane. The balance. That He has how his burst, how quick He is.


It's, it's crazy. He is in a non Travis Hunter year. That's what's so sad about this year, is That We should bet respecting Genty Moore. But unfortunately he's got Get just washed away in all the Travis Hunter hype. Yeah. He He is On pace. Right. So He has 1,031 yards And 16 touchdowns do five games. He's also sat out like a bunch of second halves. He's On pace for 2,474 yards And 38 touchdowns. Barry Sanders had two 2,628 yards. And 37 touchdowns in 1988. It's crazy. Big Cat with the state of the running back position in the NFL where, you know, you have to maximize your healthy years as much as you Can. Is It crazy to think maybe Gente should just sit down for the rest of the season?


And? I would agree. And And. He's already got a season's worth of stats. Exactly. I, I wanna see this guy make all the money. That He Can have glory at the professional level. And, I think for his own safety, I think it'd bet a good idea. Yeah. I think somebody should tell him. That He had a, a moment. There was a moment On Saturday where He, I think He ripped off like a 75 yard run And. Then I looked at his stats, And, it was like halfway through the First quarter. And He had like six carries for 82 yards. Call It. I was like, man, take out That 75 yard run. They're bottling them up. Yep. And. Then as I was about to tweet That, He had like a 65 yard run touchdown run. I was like, all right, nevermind. So I was the Vikings That during the game because he's reached the point of explosiveness where you don't know what the timeline is reacting to when They say God damn Ashton Gent is so good.


Right. Because you He might bet you might bet reacting to some a play That happened like two minutes ago. Yeah. Or He might have just done It again. Yeah. It was, he's he's been incredible. So That is our Heisman watch. We should say, I think it's two horse race right now. I would say. So we'll See what happens. Basically we'll come down to like, does Jalen Mill Row have a big couple games? I don't, I I can't In good conscious, I cannot vote for a Heisman quarterback. That lost to Vandy. Yeah, I'd agree with That. Does Carson Beck have a couple big games? I can't in good conscious vote for a quarterback. That lost to a quarterback. That lost a Vandy. Great point. And. Then Quinn ERs obviously missed a couple games. So I think He might bet. I don't think there's been a Heisman in a long time. That's won while missing a couple games.


Yeah. Yeah. So I would agree to That two horse race. We also should say, one last thing I had was Army And Navy are incredible And. it would bet awesome if one of them went to the playoffs. That would bet. Very fun. Yeah, would Bet. Very, very fun. I also think I might bet wrong. No, I think I'm right. I believe the playoff seating comes out before Army Navy Does It. So That. Yeah. That game doesn't count. I've heard That That game doesn't count. But I don't know if that's one of those situations where it's like you're not allowed to, like all the people That That come up with the seating. You're not allowed to even watch That game. That would bet. Don't Let It enter your brain. Crazy. If if one of 'em got in Huh And, then They beat And the other one Beat 'em. They both play Notre Dame. Okay, so you wanna to get In this season, you Wanna to get wild with It.


Yeah. I Think, I don't know this for a fact, but I think the way That the seating is written is That. You have to, you have to win a conference. Right? To bet considered one of the top four teams. Yes. That is true. And, That check Get. That buy. Does It say That? It has to bet a Power Four Conference. It does, does It It doesn't. It doesn't like if all the p if there's two conferences, That don't have like the big 12. For example, if They have a, a conference champion that's, you know, got three Or, four losses, And, then if you have a another like an a C champion, That somehow has three Or, four losses. Is there a possibility That, a conference champion could come from a conference.


That isn't one of those schools. Like That isn't one of those power fours. I thought They set It up to basically screw the little guy. But maybe, I think That was the intent. Yeah. But I don't know what the rule actually says. I guess It does say, I guess It technically says four highest ranked conference champions. So maybe not So It could bet like a Mac It could bet like Toledo If They were higher ranked. Yeah. If They were, if They ended up being a higher rank than, than whatever like the Big 12 champion was. Yeah. Yeah. That would bet crazy. That would bet crazy. Army Navy is played after the final. Okay, so It was right December 8th. So that'll bet. Interesting if That was, imagine if That happened. I I'm rooting for Army Or Navy to get in.


How awesome would That bet? How awesome would That bet I'm got look right now. Anything else from college football? How about your Huskies? Hank? Big win. Big upset. Just kidding. They're favorite They. Were Still though. It's good. Good win. It's a good win. You guys lit 'em up. A lot of questions in Michigan. A lot of questions in Michigan. Hank, what'd you think about the game? We talked about It Sunday. That was a big win. That was as much as you could do. We. What else do you want from me? You guys aired It out. Maybe You would've watched tape. I did not watch any tape. I'm sorry you didn't Watch any tape. God damnit I really want Army And Navy to get into the playoff.


Yeah, both Of em. Now. I I do know That. Those two teams specifically are independent. But It could bet, you know, potentially Max school. Yeah. That would rock if a max school got got a buy. It would bet. Incredible. Yeah, I think They would probably try to rig It so It wouldn't happen. Yeah. For Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. Okay. Should We do Hot Seat Cool Throne

Hank Hot. Seat Cool drunk. My Hot Seat. I got a couple. Okay. Oh, I love That from you. My First one is Life After Death. Okay. Jimmy Carter. Nope. Al Pacino. Oh, oh Yeah, I saw this. Yeah. He had a covid, I guess near death experience. And Or. Like maybe He died. And came back. He said He didn't see anything. He said, there's nothing after you die. Just So He just took a nap. It Just goes blank. No. He took A nap with No dreams. No dreams. Yep. I've been having crazy dreams recently, but The fact That He remembered That. There was nothing tells me That. There was something to remember. You know what I'm saying? True. It's like in That movie contact where it's like your camera recorded when you went to That other Dimension.


Your camera recorded nothing but static. Yeah. But It recorded eight hours of static. Right. He also didn't die. We. I guess It left him with no pulse. No He fell asleep. Covid near death experience. It left him with no Pulse. Is Al Pacino. No, it's Robert De Niro has like, who keeps having kids. I think Pacino might have had one too. Robert De Niro is just like, I, I think He has like a newborn. Yeah. He jumped off a boat this summer. Is He okay? Yeah. Did you see the video? Yeah. He He. He just like almost died. Falling off a boat. Wait, He, did He jump? Or did He fall. He jumped. But He, like It looked like a fall because He is Yeah. Can't bet. Graceful at That age. Speaking of not being graceful at That age. My other Hot Seat is Bob Costas.


Okay. I actually had him On my Hot Seat too. Hank, thanks for doing two of them. Go Ahead. Do you want me to No. Yeah. Why? He just sounded, he's, he's broadcasting the Yankees Royal Series. And He sounds horrible. He is a robot. Bob Costas is a really good case for maybe nostalgia isn't always the best because when Bob Costas started calling baseball games again, I was personally like, this is awesome. Bob Costas called the World Series when I was a kid. This is cool. No, no, no, no. I think he's still stuck in the year like 1991. Yeah. Yeah. It's like when They do, I mean, I'm, I'm worried about one that's coming up. It's like, you know, anchorman two And They do these sequels of comedies.


That aren't necessary And. They're just bad And. You're like, this just kind of It doesn't ruin the First one. Yeah, but it's not necessary. He He has all the money. He doesn't need to do It. I don't Get. Why? Why He chooses to do It. I think Bob Costas believes That. Bob Costas adds a lot to the sport of baseball. Remember Bob Costas? Did That whole remember what was It was It Sunday Night Football when They gave him That. Weird. Like Bob's minute sitting On a soapbox. Yeah. This is what I'm chewing On. Yeah. And He did the whole thing about how the NFL is too dangerous. And how He, how He feels like he's been complicit in all this stuff. I think He thinks That baseball's the one true sport. Like Bob Costas strikes me as He wishes. That It was just baseball horse racing. And boxing.


Yeah. That's It. There was the Bob Costas minute. He did the thing about football And. Then He did one about like guns at one Point. Yeah. You'd wear his little fucking S Scally cap. And He. Just, he'd look even shorter. Yeah. What what They do is They would essentially give him like a letters to the editor page. Except It was On tv for everybody to Watch. Right, right. But yeah, It was, It was Portnoy's complaint. Yeah. It was like having this report. Noy On the show. Except he's On during a baseball game for some reason. I think He. So that's why I think He does baseball. 'cause He thinks it's, you know, He. He truly is America's pastime is baseball. He's very romantic about baseball. Yeah. He would marry baseball, but He wouldn't fuck It. Right. He Also drop some F bombs in the WWE documentary. Which, Oh, That's spicy was crazy.


Yeah. That's crazy. Spicy. Bob Costas Really spicy. What'd He say? I forget It. It was laugh out loud funny. I forget the context, but He was like, it's just not the fucking same Or like He He. Just It was an unnec. It was too unnecessary. F-bombs. That's, That's wild to me. That Bob Costas would bet a wrestling fan. He Like broadcasted in the beginning. I would've bet everything That. I own That. Bob Costas would look down. On. Anybody that's ever watched wrestling. I think I wrestling. I forget the exact wrestl. It's fun No matter what. I'm pretty sure He said, like I, you know, when And, it started like He He was involved in the broadcast teams. And And, you know, WWE one, And Or. WrestleMania one. And two And stuff. And He was like, I thought It was fun. And entertaining, but it's just not the fucking same.

The Cardi B thing happened, which then other reports came out about him basically just banging everyone. So I was like, oh good for kind of Cool Throne. Yeah. He's a Guys can't bang anymore. He's A healthy, it's an act that's natural. And healthy for an adult male. Yeah. And. There was the video of him On the Vikings. When They went around. And asked everyone, you know what teammate would, wouldn't you let date your daughter? And? Every single person like unanimously was like, Stefon Dicks. That's so Stefon digs. And. That Funny is a dog. He's dog. And. And. That That. Lizzo Lyric New man On. The Minnesota Vikings. Mm. That was when He was On. Do you think, do you think Stefan Diggs fucked?


Lizzo? And then He. I thought That was Adam Thon And. Then He fucked an eight month pregnant. Cardi B. Does He have a type? I think That was after He left. But That would bet funny. I thought It was, I always thought It was Kirk Cousins. Yeah, probably Kirk. He's a dog too. Yeah. I think When did That song come out? 2017? No, No. I think it's after I'm got go with after sister. Ah. 2020. No, I'm It was like a lineman. Or something. They. They figured out who It was. Yeah. It was 2019. 2020. Someone figured It out. So maybe It is Stefan digs you. Right. I think It might bet Stefan digs also the listen at at least he's, it's kind of having safe sex.


You're not got Get, her pregnant Who? Cardi B. Yeah. Although I think That, I always, I feel like there's always like one crazy story about double pregnancy. That's how Twins are made. The baby Comes out pregnant. Yeah. Yeah. Are you Hot? Seat, quilter thrown. Or. Did you have None? I mean, Hank, Hank ripped a couple of em, but good job Hank. Great job Hank. I appreciate That.

Are you, are you, what's, what's going On here? What are the vibes I'm catching from you is It because people should make sure They really, really watched the, the golf video We did with the Bob does sports cars.


No, I got over That. I I woke up fresh late. What do you mean got over It? You we great. Yeah. It Was fun. That, you should tune in. You'll enjoy the videos. Tune in If you like seeing Hank destroyed mentally. Oh boy. Do We got a video for you? My my Hot Seat then is got bet I'm got do the Indianapolis Colts. Oh On. The Hot Seat. 'cause Belichick was On the man And cast, which I, that's the only time I watched the man And cast is when Belichick's On It because I feel like he's, it's a good fit. That They have, yeah. And He was talking shit about the Indianapolis Colts saying That. Yeah. It's loud at Arrowhead. But you know what was really loud at the RCA dome in Indianapolis when you guys used to pump in all That crowd noise. Yep.


And. Then one time It skipped And We all heard That And. Then Mr. Erse responded this morning to the allegations. That They used to pump in crowd noise. He said, reminder piped in crowd noise. Myth. A thousand percent fictional And the skip 1000, 1000% fictional And. The skip was TV broadcast. We Get It though visiting teams couldn't believe That 60,000 in an intimate domed stadium. Can make That much deafening noise Wave smiley face a credit to Colts fans. So who knows, who knows who's writing this. I I have to wait for all the facts to come out till We figure out whether Or not the Colts used to back in like 2006 pumping crowd noise Wave smiley fo Wave smiley face accredited to Colts fans.


Wow. So a thousand percent fictional Or. Is Belichick telling the truth? I don't know. Yeah. Hank, do you remember That Not, I don't remember like the details. I just remember them saying They pumped in crowd noise. I don't remember like the, the drama as It unfolded. I think a lot of stadiums do. It. Definitely. I think, I think yeah, probably. Seattle does It Or at least used to do It. There was one coach That told us anonymously. That He gave his grounds crew instructions. When They went up to Seattle to pour my acid, On all the power lines connecting the speakers to whatever pumped in crowd noise thing. They had And. Then the grounds crew was like, no, We can't do That because that's illegal. And And possibly an act of terrorism.


Yes. The coach didn't tell us this. The grounds Crew told us. The grounds crew told us this. Yes. And, it's anonymous. Which Coach It was. Yes. Yes. And then yeah, there was the, the Seahawks used to do It. I feel like the Vikings And Falcons I think got in trouble for It. Falcon They. Get fine for It. Yeah. Falcons got fined for It. Yeah. Belichick probably squeaked On. the Vikings then too. And was like, Hey, Or. On the Falcons. It was like, Hey, just so you know, They didn't hire me. Just fine. 'em Yeah. The commanders used to do It. I I heard It all the time when I was there. Yeah. It. It is, He is good. Belichick is, I don't know. I don't know what I He, I guess He was always this guy. He's a Delight. Yeah. And Also very, very funny picture of him with his girlfriend in Nantucket. Where He did the patented Belichick Rip On a Taylor Swift sweatshirt.


Yeah. Did you? So funny. Did you see what was in the background of That picture? What was It? A lighthouse. Whoa. A real lighthouse. Do You think he's coming back? No. That was Nantucket second. No, but that's like the But That could bet a sign That. He's coming back. That was his sign. It's like Devonte Adams posting Edgar Allen Poe. Yeah. Oh man. What if he's coming back? What if He goes back to the Jets? Oh, signed the contract. On a napkin. That'd Bet. Incredible. Alright. My Hot Seat is my Chicago fire because We just hired Greg Berhalter his head coach. Oh no. Yeah, I think that's great. I think that's great for Greg because That just means That. He's definitely not going to return to the US national team.


Director of football. And head coach. Hey, listen, anytime you Can Get a guy who's coached in the World Cup as your head coach, you got do It. Does this mean That? We're got have to get him On the show at some point. I think We should, We should, because We also, I, I think We should Get him. On the show And do no research before. Yeah. And. Then just go off vibes of what everyone else said about Him. Unfortunately, I've got a lot of mental background. And Greg bur I don't, I just know you It was always bur halter out, but now We Get to do bur halter out again. That's true. Yeah. So are you bur halter out right now? I'm bur halter out officially for the, for the fire. Yeah. Fuck him. That. And. You know what, let's give him one day two 10 o'clock tomorrow. I'm officially Burr Halter out. Okay. Did He, does He have any playing experience with any of the fathers of the players?


That are On the current Chicago fire because That could really screw things up. We, the good news for the fire Is I can't name, I can't name em. I, I was got say I Can Spencer Richie. Not even just fire stud, but, but MLS player That didn't play On. The U Can. You name an MLS player. That's not On. The US national team. Yes. Messy. Spencer Richie Or. No Or. Or wasn't like superstar somewhere else. Spencer Richie. Spencer. Spencer. Yeah. Easy. Fuck Yes. Spencer Richie. Shout out. Husky is He. Yeah. Nice Boys with Spencer. Backup. Goalie. Your boys with Spencer. He's boys with Spencer. His name is Spencer And. He is also Boys with Spencer. Two Spencers got It.


I hu knew who you were talking about, but the listeners did not. Right? When you just said Spencer. My bad Richie boys with Spencer. My Bad. Alright, And then My Cool Throne is Deshaun Watson because He settled another lawsuit. So We are now in a cycle. That will not bet broken That because the Browns are paying Deshaun Watson way too much money. So That, Deshaun Watson, Can then settle all his lawsuits. So That, He, He, Can never bet brought to justice for any of his crimes. So That the NFL can't suspend him. And, the Browns can't Get out of It. Yeah. The Browns can't do anything because his contract says That. There's nothing in there. Like if It wasn't already all the stuff that's been reported about him, They can't take any action against him for any of That And.


They're paying him. So That He Can basically stay afloat at paying off all these women There will bet no new allegations because all the allegations Get settled using the money That. He's getting paid from the Browns And. The Browns need the NFL to step in. But the Browns, the NFL can't step in until it's goes from private settlements to public And. That will never happen. 'cause the Browns keep paying Deshaun Watson. Correct? Correct. Damn, What a fucking dis just bench his ass. I feel so bad for Kevin Stefanski. Yeah, He should quiet quit. It's, I think He has. Yeah, I think he's still trying because, because He He, his hands are tied. He can't do anything about It 'cause the ownership's like you have to pay, you have to play the guy That. We're paying money to, He's so bad at football.


And. He's a bad guy. Isn't talking about De Sean Watson. Jamis would save everything. Jamis would light a spark. What are you got say memes. What if the Jets trade for Kevin Stefanski? That would bet a smart trade. Yeah, That'd bet. A great trade. That fix Everything. Everything. Everything, Everything. I son Reddick for Kevin Stefanski. Straight up. Yeah, I saw, I saw a lot of people complaining. Complaining about what? Pass Rush On the Browns. Oh, even though They had miles. Garrett. Yeah. He's been injured. Remember he's got a thigh. Ankle. Achilles. Yeah. Two eyes. But it's almost Halloween season. He loves Halloween season. That's true. He'll bet back. Alright, let's Get to our interview. We got Troy Aikman On, the show PFT.

Okay, We. Now welcome. On, a very, very, very special guest. It is Hall of Famer, Dallas Cowboy, Troy Aikman. Troy First of all. Thank you for joining us. We've We. We. Were just saying it's been long overdue. I guess I'll start with That First question. What, what is your, you obviously have this great relationship with Joe Buckman working with him for years. He's a good friend of ours. What does Joe Buck say about us when, when we're not around We? who He talked about y'all To me, for the First time last night as We were, were leaving the stadium. Okay. So there ha hasn't been a whole lot of dialogue.


I don't wanna I don't wanna disappoint y'all, but damn, Damn. But It started. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like he's a, he's he's ashamed of us. Is That what? It sounds like, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. No, but He heard. He heard I was coming. On And. So He He He grabbed me. And He was, He was fired up. He He said He is been a guest. On your show a few times. And, he's really enjoyed It. In fact, He He said it's the best thing That he's ever done. As, as far as how people have, have taken to him. And have gotten a chance to see his personality. So all good. Yeah, it's all good. Alright. That's, that's actually the whole interview. Hear. Okay. We just wanted to compliment from Joe.


Yeah. No. Yeah. We. I'll take It I'll take It. So now That, Joe's feeling all high. And mighty about himself. What's the worst part about working with Joe Buck? Hmm. You know what, I'll, in all honesty, there's, there's not, there's not a, there's not a lot of downside, you know, I mean, it's, it's amazing. That we've been together as long as We have, I think the, the One thing, We Joe won't let me do anything by myself. So, you know, he's involved in everything. Yeah. And, if I'm, if I'm doing an interview, I'm surprised. Is We got sneak onto this thing? No, we're just talking shit about our friends behind their backs. Yeah. The hair. I, you could've said the hair plugs. Those guy That got ridiculous. Right.


I mean, That got a little ridiculous by him. Like the, But you're talking about like the SVP interviews. It's like Jos. Hey, Jose's here too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We. Yeah, exactly. So it's, you know, that's just part of the deal. You know, we're a package deal. Yeah. So We do everything together. We who, I mean, And, we're got Get into questions about your career, And everything, but you to, to talk about you. And, Joe And, And, the And, the games you call. I i you guys, I love your booth. I I love listening to games. You guys both have big game voices, but I think it's also a testament to your relationship where a lot of times it's lost That. The, the relationship between the two guys sitting in the booth together matters so much. And, like It comes across On, the screen And, you, Can tell you guys are friends.


Was there ever, when you started with him, was there a feeling out process to get to That comfortable level? Because you guys are like the best booth, in my opinion. And, it's because of your friendship. Oh, thank You. Yeah. Thank you. And. And, And. I, I, you know, I've, I've been asked why do I think It works? And. My, my First answer always is That. I think the viewer, I think They feel the fact That We are really good friends. And And, you can't fake That. So the fact That, you understand That Or sense It, you know, It It means a lot to me. But when, when I got paired with Joe, so I, I came, I retired in 2000 And. Oh one was my First year of broadcasting. I worked with Darrell Moose, Johnston And, Dick Stockton, And Madden was the number one guy.


So then after one year, John left for Monday night football. And He called me to tell me, I had no idea what That might mean for me, but They paired, Joe And, I And, Chris Collins, worked together, And. So the three of us worked together for three years. And, I, you know, That was three. A three Man Booth is challenging. So Joe claims That. He had called a game of mine back when I was playing. I don't recall him ever, I don't recall ever being in a production meeting with him. So, you know, which you guys know Joe. So That didn't go over real We, but I got to know Joe Bet once We got into a two man booth. We were, We were close when We were in the three man booth with Chris.


But once, once It became just Joe And, I, you know, then We had more concentrated time together. And, I was golfing at the time. We spent a lot of time in the off season golfing. Our kids are our daughters. They're not kids anymore. They're adults. But They, were They, were roughly the same age We. Were girl dads. We've, we've gone through a lot of life experiences together. So it's been a good relationship, really, right from the start. Yeah, it's It is been, it's been great to watch And. You guys do add like That element, like Big Cat said the big game voices. It just feels like it's a spectacle. And We got Troy And, Joe On, the broadcast And. That's always great. And, unless you make a minor mistake, On the Air And, you accidentally say That. Taylor Swift is married to Travis Kelsey.


Yeah. Like, is That I, is, is was That a big deal? I mean, was That was That like, was I, was I On a tightrope right there? You know, I'm I this morning I, I I woke up And. I saw a headline like Aikman knew He was in trouble. Or something. And. I'm the Vikings. Gosh, if this is, if this is newsworthy, I mean In trouble. Yeah. I mean, look. Really? Yeah. Have you ever done the thing where you became an ordained minister online, you like, fill out a form, takes you five minutes, And And, you Get a certificate? Because if you had I've Not done. I've done, I've done, I've done That. I've, I've done That to become a bartender, but not, not a minister. So, Okay. All right. So they're not actually married. It's like, have you ever seen That thing?


You do. That's what happens to the lead singer. They accidentally say he's engaged the band falls apart. You might have just cursed the Chiefs. Yeah. You know what, someone, I don't know if I cursed him. Or not, but someone actually reached out to me today. And said That They might actually bet engaged. So I might have, I might have, I might have broke the story. Big J journalist Is It. So, so the, I I like, like I said, we're big fans of yours. I wanna talk about your playing career real quick, because I We always do. Whenever We have rookie quarterbacks, it's always like, We, Peyton Manning threw 33 interceptions, Or, whatever. It was his, his First year. You also had a tough First year. Didn't win a game, threw a lot of interceptions.


Yeah. Yeah. Was there ever a moment in your First year where you're like, this might not bet. Like, I might not bet able to make this, because We see It now all the time where They rush guys in And, there's five guys drafted And every First round, And, three Or, four of 'em are failures. But what, what was It like when you were going through That And? How were you able to overcome It? Because it's really something We should all look at And bet. Like, Hey, don't give up. On a guy after a year. Yeah. Like, like, maybe this isn't the profession for me. Huh. Yeah. Go into something else, but no, I I'm asked a lot as you Can imagine with these guys now, you know, should a guy sit And, watch for a year, Or two Or should He play right away.


And all, all I know is what I experienced. And. That was, I played right away. And, I think the key is not losing your confidence. And, fortunately for me, I had a former NFL quarterback That had played years earlier. And, Jerry Rome That was my quarterback coach. And He He was great. And just simply not allowing me to lose my confidence, which, which I didn't do, but I was demoralized a bunch. I mean, there were so many times I walked off the field, the Vikings, what do you got do to win a game? But I was, oh, And 11, like you said, got got beat up a lot. But I, I, I still always believed That We would Get It going And. Fortunately, my First start my second year.


We won. So I got That Monkey off my back. But you're right in That, we're so quick to judge. I mean, we're judging these guys after three, four games. I mean, it's crazy. We don't even give 'em a year. Yeah. And, we're already making proclamations. On Jayden Daniels, who I think is sensational, but Caleb Williams, you know, people are already comparing those two guys. And, who's will make this, who's not, of course, Bryce Young from last year, And, I, I do think And And, you know, And And, a guy like Sam Darn right. You know, who's been years now removed And. He's gotten in the right situation. And. Look what he's been able to do. So I I, I really believe That so many of these quarterbacks are really talented.


They, just Get put in bad situations. And And. I was in a bad situation. My First two years, And. Then North Turner came in, And it It changed the trajectory of my career. And really, our entire team And. it It really is what allowed us to go On. And win Super Bowls was when He came in, And started coordinating our offense And. So I think That organizations, And offensive coaches, And offensive coordinators have failed quarterbacks more than quarterbacks have failed organizations. Yeah. Yeah. And it make sense. And And We just found out right now, actually, That Drake May is got bet starting for the Patriots. This Oh, wow. Upcoming weekend. So, so They made the change. We, were talking about this On On Monday's show about whether Or not it's a good idea to start Drake may right now, considering where the Patriots are at And, really what They want to accomplish this season.


So, I'm curious to hear from your perspective, do you, do you feel like this is, it's the time to see what the young guys got? Yeah, I think the, again, going back to if I were the coach, I would simply ask the question one, Can We protect him. And, Can, We. Put him in an environment where We at least give him a chance. Where He has an opportunity to have success. And, if the answer to those questions is yes, then I say Get 'em out there. And And, let 'em Get some reps. I mean, you talked about Peyton. You know, Peyton struggled as, as a rookie. There was a time when all rookies struggled. You know, the Dan Marinos were rare And. Then Ben Roethlisberger came in. And He He had a really good rookie year. And. Now we've seen Dak Prescott, we've seen, we've seen others.


CJ Stroud, there's, there's guys I'm leaving out. But we've seen more And, more rookies who have come in. And And been able to play at a pretty high level. But if you're a, if you're a rookie, quarterbacks And, you struggle And. That's somehow end your confidence. Or somehow affects your ability to play at a high level. Then you probably weren't wired properly to bet a franchise quarterback anyway, is, is what I would think. I think that's That that's a valid point. So you were talking about the organization having a good organization around you. I'm curious to know, did Jerry Jones, did He ever land the helicopter On the practice field while you were On? It? Or is That something? He's just recently started to do We, who started doing It probably, I don't know, eight years ago.


Or. So 6, 7, 8 years ago when He, when He got the helicopter. But you know, when He He, I came in the same year as Jerry And. When, when I came into the league with him, He He had mortgaged everything He owned in order to buy the Cowboys. So He He was not, He didn't have the perks of a 300 foot yacht, Or, a helicopter, Or, you know, all the other trappings, That, He, That, He now has, so We didn't have to, We didn't have to deal with That, but That helicopter, It It, it's, it's running a taxi service back And forth quite often throughout the day. So It becomes a regular occurrence. Yeah. That's Awesome. That's what I would do.


Yeah. That would bet the worst owner of the legal Absolutely. Way. Absolutely. Yeah. I would, I would just take all the pieces from all the worst owners, combine them into one. That's probably how I'd act if you just gave me a team. But at the time, you just mentioned you came into the league at the same time Jerry Jones got into the league, And. Then you guys kind of all grew together. At what point did you realize That your owner, That you had, was different from all the o other owners? That's a great question. Great question. That's one I'm never been asked. It's a great question. I I, you know what? It It It resonates because I would tell you We First of all, as soon as you meet Jerry, have y'all ever met Jerry? We've never had the opportunity. We want to get On, That bus And have a couple Johnny Walker Blues with him. Yeah. Hell yeah. I, I bet if He knew you wanted to do That, you would bet invited quite, I, I'm being serious.


And And. You know, I think when, I think when anyone meets Jerry, anyone who listens to this, that's had the opportunity to meet Jerry, I think would agree with this. That, as soon as you meet him, you realize he's different. And And He is unique. And He approaches life just differently. And He approached the league differently. I mean, you think about It, That, He had not been in the league very long when the league was about to re-up with the networks at the existing prices. And, They were told the networks told the league They weren't making money. Hey, We still want to televise NFL games, but We, We have to do It at the same price. And, it was Jerry who put his foot down.


And said, no, we're not got do That. And. Then He got involved. And. That's how Fox then got involved. And. The rest is history with what the TV rating Or, the, the contracts have been. So I would say That right away, I knew He was different. And. Then within a short period of time, you realize how competitive He is. And And, how badly He wants to win. He does, He does wanna win. Now, some would argue as to how He goes about doing That, which is a valid argument. But yeah, he's, he's in It to win. There's no question. Yeah. So the, your, your run with the Cowboys in the nineties, the team, team of the decade, three Super Bowls, And We talked about the, oh, And 11 rookie year.


But then you're building, you're building, you're building. Is there one game? That, you Can look at And, say That was the moment That. I knew That We were We were about to bet something special because That That, the sports is about the Climb. And And And watching a team come together. Is there one game, though? You specifically are like, yep, That was It. That's when We knew We were different. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you ever realize It at the moment when It happens, but, but We were my second year as, as tough as my rookie year was. My second year. Started out even tougher It was, because when you come in, the Cowboys were the worst team in football the year before I arrived. That's, that's why They had the First pick And. That's why I went there. And, And, it's hard to take ownership in your First year because you're new And.


You say We heck, this team was bad last year. You know, I, I, this isn't really my fault. And. Then your second year, you start to do, you do start to take ownership. And you, And you then are part of the problem. And We started. We started That. Year three, And seven. We were worse offensively than We had been the year before. And We went to La We went to play the Rams. When They were down in Orange County, And They were a really good team with Jim Everett as a quarterback. And We beat them. We We were heavy underdogs. But We won That game. And We ended up winning four games in a row. And put us, put ourselves in a position to potentially make the playoffs. But We didn't. We lost the last two games, And.


Then the next year, We had a good year. We made the playoffs. But when We all looked back, On, when did It really turn for us? It was That game against the Rams in, in 1990. That kind of, kind of got things going, at least in the right direction where We started to build On something. And. I think That, I think all teams go through That. We had the Redskins. I say Redskins. We had the com, the Commanders a couple of weeks ago, And, nobody expected much out of them. And, Jayden Daniels has a fantastic game against Cincinnati. And. I said That during the broadcast. I didn't reference my own career, but I really felt That That was a game. I do think That, we'll see how their year goes, but I would bet That most people, if not everyone in That organization, is got, look back, On That, Monday night game against Cincinnati.


And say. That's when We really started to believe That. We had something. That was unique. And, I think They do have something that's got carry them this year. Yeah. And, it's, it's so funny because in sports too, I, I, you could tell me if I'm way off, but like the human element of, it's not all just talent Or scheme, but the belief in a hundred percent, being able to do something matters a lot for a lot of these teams. And, in some ways, It matters more, you know, than the, than the talent. I, I, I 100% agree with That. I, I, I believe I've always believed there are guys within an organization, guys within a locker room, On a team. That may not contribute much On the field, but their contributions to the overall success of That team are, you know, you just can't, you, you can't put a value On It because of their personality Or.


How They keep guys loose. Or, how They build people up, Or whatever, whatever It is. But the locker room dynamic. It It, It means something. Yeah, And, you have to bet in That locker room. It's one of the reasons why I had always wanted to bet a general manager. I mean, That Time's passed me by, but I'd always wanted to do It because I've been in a championship locker room. I know what That locker room looks like. I know what It feels like. And. It's not always just simply looking at a pa at a player On paper. And saying, We, this guy's bet than That guy. There's more That plays into That. And, And having a belief in one another. And having a trust is a big part of team success. Who, Who was That On The Cowboys. Maybe someone a name That. We wouldn't think That popped off.


That was like, this guy is a glue guy. Something That you, you can't understand It unless you're in That locker room. Yeah, I would, I would say Kevin Gogan was, was absolutely one of those guys. He's the First guy. That comes to mind now. He played. He wasn't someone who, who, who didn't play. But He wasn't this all pro offensive lineman. I mean, He just did It, On, On, sheer guts, And And And attitude. But what He meant to us during the week, I is, you know, you can't, like I said, you just simply can't ba you can't put a price On. Yeah. Yeah. t make everybody else want to do their job a little bit. Bet. Yeah. Right. So, I, I read something interesting about you today.


I don't know if it's true, Or not, but if It is, this might bet the most interesting Troy, Aikman fact of all time. You were the Oklahoma State typing champion when you were in high school. I Had this written down as We. Yeah. I What is That? Yeah, You is That true. What? It's, it's somewhat true. I, you know, sometimes when I'm asked That, I just roll with It. But I'll, I'll just bet I'll shoot you guys straight. Okay. Okay. It was, I think It was like a Tri-County contest. It was not a state title, but it's, it's grown It went from like a county vo-tech deal to, to, Hey, you're Oklahoma State champion of 1983, Or, whatever, whatever It was.


But my sister, I was in type And. I took, my mom was a type setter at the, at the local newspaper. I don't, I don't know if typing is, is passed down if it's hereditary, but It might bet. But she was good. My sister's a year older than me. And. We were in typing together. And. She was the best typist in the class. I was the second best And. She was the one who was supposed to go to this contest, And. She didn't want to go. She said, Hey, I, you know, I, I don't like to compete. You're used to It. Why don't you go And? I said, hell, I'll go, I just figured out I Get outta school for a day. So I said, yeah, I'll go. So I went. I was the only guy in the typing contest. And. I thought I did okay. I, I didn't think It was my best stuff.


I, I certainly didn't think I won And. Then We, go into this room. 'cause They had an accounting contest. And They had, They had all Kinds of different, It was the most boring thing contest ever. Oh, yeah, yeah. It was all kinds of stupid stuff. Like That, And, And. I went into the auditorium at the end of the day, And just sitting there, And They said, now for the typing winner, And And. They, I They announced my name, And. Now, that's when It got embarrassing is That. I, you know, I had to walk down. I'm like, I'm the typist. You know? I was hell. I was, I was an athlete, you know, I thought I was And. But yeah, I won That, but It. But it's got, I, i little did I know That all these years later. I mean, It. Yeah. People are still talking about It. Troy County, On. My Wikipedia page, Or something.


I just, I found It when I looked up fun facts about Troy, Aikman. And, And That was one of the First fun facts about, it's in, you guys are like the Manning family, but for typing. Yeah. Like your mom is a typist. And, then And. Then your older sibling was supposed to bet the best one. Then you fill in. Yeah. Yeah. That's Great. No, that's a, that's a, that's a good point. We are like the Manny family. Only for typing. For typing. Yeah. So what was your, what was your words permitted? I, I That kind of fell like a shot a little bit, but I, What was your words permitted? On. That. Do you remember? Oh gosh. I, I think I was up around 80 something. Oh, that's pretty good. That's really good. And And. Back then, you know, They didn't have computers.


It was all, It was all typewriters. And, And. So little did I know That taking, typing was got end up being such a, a game changer for me in life. You know? I mean, I, I I type out emails, And, you know, I, I'm not, I'm not doing this, you know? So, Yeah. Wait, so you still got It? You think you still got It? Oh yeah. Okay. Still got It. I still got It. You could definitely take Joe. Joe Buck doesn't type any We. J Joe Buck's got assistance. That type all his shit out for him. Oh, Hell Yeah. Sometimes I might have to type his stuff. You know, you just never know. I just like the idea of someone walking by like a hall of Famer, three time Super Bowl champion. Troy, Aikman, And being like, damn, He, Can type We.


What stood out to me was They. They had a quote from one of his friends, I think back in high school. That said, Joe Typing sounded like a machine gun. Troy. Yeah. Yeah. Troy. Yeah. Troy. Yeah. Troy been typing Sounds like a machine gun. Yeah. You just know who's typing. Close your eyes, you know, who's typing. It's A powerful email. Yeah. Yeah. So, so you also, I assume you sent out emails 'cause you have a beer now, which is pretty cool. Yeah. That's like, I mean, you, you, you're a guy who has It all Super Bowls, hall of Fame, And. You're like, yeah, why don't I just add another one? I'm, I'm got Get a Beer, which is the coolest thing ever. So when did you start It? I started We shoot. I guess It goes back five years ago now. So It was when I, it's when I had the idea to do It And.


it took two years to come up with the recipe. And. What I wanted to achieve was First of all. I, I worked for a distributor in college before I, when I was transferring from OU to UCLA And. Then I became really close friends with a distributor here in town. And did a lot at his distributorship sales meetings. So I, I And I've done some campaigns over the years. So I, I've kind of been associated with the beer business for a long time. But I, I just, two things. I, I felt That one, the brands That were On the market I thought were tired. And, it was time for something new, something disruptive, And. Then two, I felt That. I could do It Bet And by bet.


I, I felt That I could make this cleaner. So That was kind of the, the approach. And We partnered with Oregon State. They've got a terrific beer program in their food And science department. And, it took two years. And so will make eight different than any other beer is That It. We have no adjuncts, meaning We don't add any syrup, sugar sweeteners, no corn, no rice. We're the only widely available. Beer That doesn't do That. So It truly is a cleaner bet for you. Beer, a hundred percent organic grains, 90 calories, 2.6 carbs. So the measurables are important.


They're important to me. That Mic Ultra, for instance, is 96 calories, 2.6 carbs. We're 90 calories, 2.6 carbs. And We don't have junk in It like They do. So, I'm real proud of It. It's doing really We. We're in Texas. And, Oklahoma And. We'll see where It goes. I'm, I'm, I'm We continue to grow And. Then we'll start looking more expansion And probably in 26, 25. We'll continue to focus On those two states. That's Awesome. That's very cool. And. Now, now you Can drink beer while you watch football. On Sundays, since you're On Monday night football, That must have been a great switch for you. Right? You Get to watch all the games On Sunday as They happen. Yeah, you know what, it's It. It's great for That reason.


It also, It It creates a pretty good pacing during the week. That, you know, one, I'm home On Saturdays for the most part. So I Get Friday, And Saturdays at home in Dallas, along with the rest of the week, which is good And. Then I also have the day On Monday. So I feel like I've kind of got a bonus day in my, in my preparation That. I otherwise didn't Get, but yeah, it's been great. I can't believe this is already our third year On. Monday night Football. Yeah. Yeah. And, Monday night football's the best. You sit down, you after a weekend of just watching all the games. You just Get one game to focus On. It's great. We. The the big thing I think is That We we're getting good games, right?


You Know, there was, there was a time when I, I don't know That They could necessarily say That, but the league's been fantastic. Roger Goodell's been, been amazing. And. We've, we've had, we've had really good schedules. Now we've got flex scheduling And. So obviously that's what drives viewership. And And. We've been fortunate. That The league support has supported us the way They have. Yes. Yeah. So Flex Scheduling That kicks in week 12 from one Night Football. Yeah. I love That. It's awesome. I I love the idea That We won't necessarily have to sit through a dud just a game. That doesn't mean Anything. Yeah. There's a game. I think it's week 12. It's, we're, we're at Denver And, I forget now is It Cleveland? It might bet Cleveland at Denver.


That. That That May, may end up being a flex. Is is kind of what it's looking like as We talk. Yeah. We deserve good Monday night football games. And, I mean, you, you called the Chiefs Saints last night. Obviously, anytime Patrick Mahomes is playing, it's great to watch. I We We always say like, just flex the Chiefs to every single Monday Or Sunday night And. You'll bet. Fine. Is It awkward at all though? Has Patrick Mahomes brought up the tweet, the famous tweet? Because That was, That was bad. Troy We We consider you a friend now. But That was bad. No, It wasn't bad. No, no. It wasn't bad. So, for people who don't, so people don't know. The tweet I'm referring to is the athletic Kansas City said, in case you missed It, Patrick Mahomes has thrown 36% of Drake men's career touchdowns in about 8% of the games.


This is from 2019. You quote, tweet And said, in case you missed It. Talk to me when He has 33% of my Super Bowl titles, It took him four more years to get a hundred percent Right. Right? What part, what part? That was bad. That was bad. We That happened fast. who So That happened fast. Now here's what happens. So here's what happens. Something like, something like That happens, And then, I mean, I could bet On this show explaining what happened. I could go On every national show. And, you're still not got reach. All the people who saw it And have their opinion. Yeah. So, you know, I don't Get defensive about It. I, you know, in the world, That we're in, if you Get defensive about anything, you're, you've lost your mind.


'cause there's no point in It. But that's facts. But, so here's what happened. I, I don't even hardly Get On Twitter, but in 2019, I just happened to get On It And. I was looking at my reps, And And this And And. I, this one comes up, And And. I don't even know who the writer was. I'd bet Curious as to who the writer was. Here's what I've said is That, whoever this rider was, like, why would He compare Patrick Mahomes his stats to me? Like I was never known as a stats guy. True. Why, why wouldn't He compare Mahomes stats to Dan Marino, Or, Joe Montana, Or, somebody like That We.


So when I read It, I felt like the rider was taking a shot at me. You know, I thought, ah, like I said, like this jackass. I mean, like, what, what And does Yards Or, any of That even matter. Did touchdowns even matter at the end of the day for a quarterback? The only thing That matters is, is winning championships. I mean, that's all That. We're ultimately judged On And. If a quarterback puts up huge numbers, And doesn't win. He's carrying this burden around with him for the rest of his life, for people saying, yeah, but He never could win the big one. That's all That people will say is, oh yeah, He put up big numbers. But He came. So at the end of the day, the, the championships, in my opinion, And, I know That sounds self-serving because I was able to win three That.


But that's what matters. So I thought this rider was, I, I just thought, what does the, what do numbers mean? It's, it's irrelevant. So my reply was, was really a shot back at the rider to say, Hey, this is what matters. Right? Lemme know when He has, that's what matters. Not how many yards he's thrown for. How many championships does He have? It was never a shot at Patrick Mahomes. That makes more sense. Yeah. So when I sent That out, when I sent That text, when I sent That tweet out, I actually was kinda laughing about It. I thought It was pretty clever. I thought, yeah, fuck That guy, you know? Yeah. I thought That was pretty, I thought That was pretty funny. And. Then the next day, I, I Get up And.


I just happened to go back On to see, you know what the response was, And. The response was totally opposite of anything I was trying to achieve. And. So They all thought I was taking a shot at Patrick. So now every time Patrick's had success, you know, That tweet Oh, yeah. Comes back up. But I reached out to Andy Reed the next day, And. I said, Hey, Andy. I said, here's, here's what happened. I said, I know you, you, I know you don't, you could care less. You know, you've got a million other things you got worry about. Besides my little tweet That went out last night. But I said, here's what I meant, And. I said, if you could just tell Patrick That this was not in any way intended to bet a shot at him at all, And, Andy said, Hey, I haven't even seen It, haven't heard about It, but you know, I, I know you And, I know what you're about.


Not even worried about It. So blah, blah, blah, And. I saw Patrick, I've talked to Patrick about It. So it's all, it's all fine. But, you know, then He And, I hope Pat, I hope Patrick wins 10. I, I I really do. I mean, I hope there's a lot of quarterbacks. I hope win 10. I I pull for all these guys. Yeah. So It was never, It was never about Patrick It. It was about the rider. And. I just thought, I thought It was a, I thought He was taking a shot. And made It unfairly And. it didn't make sense to me. So, That all makes sense. And, I, I, I appreciate That because the game has changed. And stats have changed, but at what point was It the second Super Bowl Or, the third Super Bowl, where you're like, should I just delete this We? I, you know what? I don't, I I was just the Vikings about this too. Because again, I, I'm not On, I'm not On Twitter That much, but I don't think I've ever deleted a tweet.


No, you shouldn't delete It. This one's funny. 'cause It goes viral every time He wins a Super Bowl, which is every year now. Yeah. And, I, you know, I, yeah, no, I, trust me, I know It goes viral. It's, I I see It. I mean, I see It. Yeah. But yeah, I, I, I guess I'm fortunate. That, I haven't felt a need to delete a tweet. Yeah. And, even That tweet. I'm, I'm, it's not like I'm embarrassed about It Or. Wish I hadn't have done It. I just, I just, I, I, I'm hoping the right, I'm hoping whoever, whoever tweeted That, whoever wrote That, maybe one day I'll figure out who It is. But whoever did It, I hope He understands That. My reply was for him. And, not for anyone else.


Yes. I like That And. Again, I never thought It was like a shot at Patrick, so to speak. It's just so funny how Fast He won three Super Bowls. Oh, yeah. Instant It was instant. It was like, no. Yeah. You, you treated That. Yeah, And. Then It was like three And, five years. Yeah. That's a That. No, that's a good point. Like, you're right. Like He, He, He didn't Get to 33%. He got to a hundred percent like Overnight. You know, I'm, I'm also reading up On, this And, what you should do is when He wins another Super Bowl. 'cause it's got happen at some point just in advance, change your profile picture to just like a picture of your beer. So then when you go viral And, people look at you They. Just That, You know, They Get you beer in There. Yeah, that's true. Now, I, I also saw That, you are, you are in a, a bit of a back And forth with Lamar Jackson about who has the trademark to the number eight.


You guys are both trying to trademark the number eight. I'm, I'm not trying to trademark It. He. I guess I, I like Lamar. I, I think Lamar's gotten some bad advice. It was news to me. I've not talked to La to Lamar about It. We. I, We will have a game of his. I, I'm not even sure we'll talk about It then, but I think he's gotten some really bad advice from whoever's, whoever's his legal counsel On this. But, you know, there's a, there's been a lot of great players. That have worn number eight long before me. And, certainly long before Lamar. You know, you talk about Cal Ripkin, And, Archie Manning, And, Yogi Berra, And. You know, there's, I've, there's a lot of guys.


Yeah. And, you know Kobe, of course. War eight And. So to trademark a number, I'm not, I'm not sure you Can do That. I know he's, I know he's proud of wearing eight. Steve Young was proud of wearing eight. You know, I'm proud to have worn eight. My, my beer is named eight And. I'm wearing a hat. That is for my beer. And And. I have the right, as, as as someone who has the trademarks for alcoholic beverage to promote my, my product. And On A hat, On a shirt, On a duffle bag. Or. However, I choose And And.


I And. That's why I think he's just gotten bad advice. And And, anyone who looks at Lamar's Marks, no one would confuse what I'm doing with my beer, with anything That he's doing. Yes. So, I'm not a big article guy. I just read a headline. That said, That, you And Lamar Jackson are fighting over the number eight. We're Not smart. Yeah. Just so you know, we're not smart at all. We're He And. I aren't He And. I aren't fighting at all. I, I, like I said, I'm a big fan. And And And. I, I invited, I invited Lamar On a post On Instagram to, to, to talk about It over a, over an eight beer And.


Maybe we'd have Steve Young kind of officiate the, the, the, the thing. And And And Get the Eights together. Yeah. Yeah. And Lamar. And Lamar He liked the He, liked the posts. So I don't know what, what Bet It. I think you guys are good. Yeah. But that'd bet a great summit. Eight Fest And Eight. Yeah. Eight Fest. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Just all hang out, put the Heisman house to shame. I would like, That, I got a question for you about the modern day. NFL. If there was one team That, like if the NFL was a stock market, And, there's one team, That, you're buying stock And for the next, like three to five years right now, considering where They are, where you think they'll go, what team do you think That would bet Washington? Crazy. Okay. I didn't, I didn't think you'd say That, but that's great. I would agree with That. Hmm. Yeah.


I, I wouldn't have said That prior to this year. I probably wouldn't have said It if We hadn't have had Washington already this season. But I, I can't tell you how, how high I, I am On this quarterback. It's been a long time since I've been, since I've been That High On a young quarterback. I, I watched him. So he'd played two games. I guess We had 'em week three. And. I liked what I'd seen And then. But there's a lot of quarterbacks. That have talent. I mean, virtually every quarterback in the NFL has some ability. That's why they're in the NFL. Especially if you've been a First round pick. But, so then what separates 'em, We, you know, the players, like we've talked about, the organization, the coaching, the players around him, all That.


But, but what Can the player con control. Does He have the intangibles? You know, does He want to bet? Great. Is He smart? Does He put in the time all those things? He a good teammate. All That. So when We did our production meeting with Jayden, I, I immediately was That. That's what sealed It for me. Before We even called the game before We even had the game against Cincinnati. When We got done talking to him, I said, wow, this guy is the real deal. I mean, he's really talented. And He is really smart. And, his, his upbringing, you Can tell He was raised, right? And. So I said, He has It. He just has It, And, And. Then He goes out, And plays lights out. So I like him.


And And. I'm a fan of Dan Quinn's too. So And, I And, I said It On, the broadcast That Washington organization. When I was playing It, It was, It was hard to go into RFK, And And play them, you know, Joe Gibbs coach teams They were They, were We coached. They were talented. And. I just hated to see an organization Get run into the ground the way That one did. They had great fans. Then people weren't even showing up for the games. All of It. I, I think the Washington, I think it's fair to say That like Chicago, like the Giants like San Francisco. I think the league is, even though it's been a while since they've been good, I do think the league is stronger when Washington's a good team.


The NFCE certainly is. It's more compelling. So I, I like them. I don't If you said who would the next team bet? I, I don't know. I don't know who I would say quite honestly. There's no one who really just jumps out at me. I, I maybe Chicago. Hmm. You know, may, maybe Chicago. I do think Chicago's got some talent. They're still kinda trying to figure It out a little bit. I, I still think, Caleb, going back to what We talked about earlier. I hate to even say still, because he's in his First year. I mean, We shouldn't even bet judging him On what's happened up to this point. But I think he's got Bet a good player. Yeah. Yeah. He's gotten bet every week. Yeah. And, you And, that's hard for you to say against for a USC quarterback.


You know what? It's actually not Okay. I guess the other team I'd say would probably bet Houston because of CJ Stroud. Yeah. And. I, Dico Ryan's I love. But no, you know, as a matter of fact, I, my, my UCLA family won't, won't like hearing this, but I grew up in Southern California till I was 12. And, it's hard to bet it's hard to live in southern California. And And have the name of Troy And. Not bet. A USC fan. True. Yeah. So I was a, I was a big USC fan growing up. And And. Then when I was looking to go to college, had UC had USC had They have recruited me, there's a good chance I, I would've gone there.


And. There's a good chance I would've gone there even when I transferred, if, if Rodney Pete wasn't as young as He was. And already entrenched as the starter. Yeah. But, so I never, I mean, it's a It was a great rivalry. And And wanted to beat 'em. Unfortunately, I, I, I lost the two games I played against them. But, but I've always, I've loved their uniforms. I've lo you know, I, I've, I've been an, I I don't have, I don't have the hatred towards USC like some of my former teammates do.

So, U UCLA obviously in the Big 10 now. Not the best start to Big 10. I'm a Big 10 guy And. You have to work with one. How much does It suck? That? Like for once in basically the history of all college football, Joe Buck gets to talk shit to you about Indiana being bet than UCLA That would. If I were in your shoes, That would drive me nuts. If you, if you played for the school And Joe Buck's wearing his Indiana stuff. And And probably giving you a lot of shit. Yeah. That, you know, there was a couple years ago, I said, something came up. The player was from Indiana. He mentioned It Or something. And. I, I said, Hey, I, I'm a little, I'm surprised I didn't realize They still played football at Indiana.


Oh no. And And. Then, you know, then you're like, okay, now, now I should Get On Twitter. 'cause I'm got Get blow up, blown up. You know, people are so sensitive about everything. And, And, And. Now, just a few years later, I'm, I'm outwardly being supportive of, of Indiana. Yeah. I mean, so I was watching them play U-C-L-A-A few weeks ago. Didn't know anything about this Coach, coach s Netti. Carl Sign, Netti And. I mean, how about That guy? Yeah. I, what he's done is amazing. So all of a sudden I've become this huge fan of this guy And. Now I'm a fan of, of the Hoosiers.


So I'm, I'm talking to Joe. Every, like, I'm a bigger fan of for the Hoosiers than He is. Oh, I like That. Take That. I actually think when I think Indiana football, I think Troy, Aikman First. Yeah. Joe Buck second. That's a fact. That's a fact. I, I love That because, You know, He hates That too. You know, That Joe hates That. Yeah. You got learn every player On, the two deep And just bet like, just spouting out names. Like, oh, I guess you don't watch Joe. You didn't know the backup Center. Yeah. You, you know what I love That. Yeah. And. But I, I like That. I, I like That. You acknowledge, when you think of Indiana football, you think of Troy. Troy, First name. First Name That comes to mind. I, I read, I read a rumor. It comes to mind. Yeah.


I read a rumor. That. Yeah. I like That. When you're in the booth, On, Monday Night Football, you're wearing the Indiana pants underneath the desk. We can't see That, but Joe doesn't have his On. Yeah. That's bad. No. He doesn't have his On. No He. He's not, he's not bringing It like I am. Yeah. You know, Hoosiers, Troy Aikman. Mr. Hos one. And one. I have a question about coaching. You obviously Jimmy Johnson, you, you know, you had a great coach in, in Dallas. He goes to, he's a hard ass. I I would assume, like you have many stories about him. And, how He coached the team. He then goes into media And. He's like this lovable, likable guy. We've seen the same thing with Belichick, who was a hard ass for 20 years. And. Now he's this gregarious guy.


On Air We. When Jimmy made the switch, were you like, what's going On man? Like, you were, you were cutting guys when They were sleeping. Like, what, what is happening here? Where Or, Or, Or, did you always know He had That side. He just wouldn't show the team. At the end of his time in Dallas, He And, I became really close friends. So I, I got a little glimpse of, of really what He was about. But still not. Jimmy was, He was highly driven. And motivated to bet. Great. So He will try to tell you That He played a role. He played the role He had to play in order for us to achieve what He wanted us to achieve.


I, I think, I, I don't think it's quite That simple. I, I think That, what He was We saw, I think that's who He was. But at his core, at his core, He is what? We see On tv. Yeah. At his core. He wants to bet He just wants to enjoy life. He wants He wants to drink his beer. And, And just have fun. And And, I think That, that's how He has always been his whole life. But in his profession of coaching, He wanted to bet great And to bet great And. Same with Bill to Bet. Great. I just don't know. I know times have changed, but I don't know many coaches. If you said, boy, They are like one of the greatest to have ever done It, I don't know how many of those coaches We would point to And, say They are players, coaches.


Yeah. You know, I think it's hard. I don't, I And I don't, I I, I was drawn to guys like Jimmy Johnson, bill Belichick, you know, I Bill Parcells, you know, those types, those are the guys That I always wanted to play for, because that's kind of how I'm wired. You know? I mean, I wanna have a good time, but when it's time to work And, it's time to get serious. I just wanna know somebody's got bet there holding us all accountable. And. So yeah, he's taken, you know, Jimmy has certainly And. Jimmy And Bill are Belichick are really close friends. Yeah. And And. Jimmy would bet the guy to tell me, Hey, because I'd go in We.


I'd go in And visit with Bill And, production meetings, And, the, what you see of him, Or saw of him at his press conferences was what I got when I went in there. And And was talking to him. You know, It just wasn't there wasn't much there. Yeah. And, I'd say And, I'd ask Jimmy, like, how, how do you Get along with this guy? I mean, how, how does It work? And He goes, ah, He is great. And And now, now the whole, the whole country's gotten a chance to see, you know what his personality is. And. Obviously, he's a smart guy. And, he's great. Now, what'll bet interesting is when He goes back into coaching.


If He has this persona again where He is got bet the old grumpy coach who doesn't answer questions. Yeah. I mean, it's, no, I don't, I wonder how effective it's bet. Bet. 'cause now we're seeing this other side of him. Of course, in the media. Yeah. So you said something there. I I wanted to do a follow up. On, On accountability. And. I was always wondering this 'cause We, we've had Michael Irvin On this show before. He tells great stories. Everyone knows his famous stories. Was there ever a moment in the nineties where you're like, He came in, maybe late Or, something like That where you're just like, come On, dude. Because It does feel like his talent was so special. He maybe got away with more things in Jimmy Johnson's eyes. Was there ever a moment where you're like, all right, you need to, I need, I need a little help here.


We who got away with more? Jimmy was always Jimmy And, our First team meeting every year, made It real clear. He is the only coach That I've ever had who would do this. But He would say to the team, I do not treat all the players equal. I love That. Everybody says, everybody says, I treat everybody equal. He says, Jimmy said, I do not. He said, if, if, you know, if you're Emmett Smith And, you do this And do something wrong. I'm got look the other way. If you're so And, so hadn't done anything, On the field And, you do That, you're, you're not got bet On the team. You're got bet cut. So you're got bet treated based On how you perform in the games. And, the bet you perform, the more leeway you're got.


Get. He's the only coach that's ever been That honest. I mean, every coach does That. Let's, I mean, We all know That, right? Yummy was the only one who admitted It. So Michael, Michael always knew how He, He always knew where to push the line, you know? So He He was got take full advantage of whatever leeway He was afforded. But Jimmy did a great job. There was a, a game We. Were going to Detroit And. Jimmy was one of these guys who always did He, got On, the plane early He, like our meeting, our First team meeting That We ever had with Jimmy Johnson. The meeting was at nine in the morning at 8 45. He started the meeting players were trying to walk in And.


He shut the door. And wouldn't let 'em in. And, they're like, He said, you're late And. They're, look at their watch And. It's, it's five to nine And. He said when the meeting starts, that's, that's, that's what time the meeting is And, if you're after That. So then everybody got into the meeting room 20 minutes before the time for Jimmy. So that's how Jimmy operated. So we're playing in Detroit one, one week. And we're flying out at 1:00 PM Or something for Detroit. The team charter Michael shows up at 1250. And, They. He said, shut the door. We're leaving And. They said, Mike Or, coach Michael Urban just pulled up. He goes, I don't care. Shut the door. We're leaving. So Michael was getting out of his car with his luggage.


He wasn't late, but in Jimmy's mind, He was so He shut the door. And, We took off without him. So we're all On the flight going, man, We just left Michael back, On the tarmac. Michael had to take a commercial flight. We benched him for the First series. And And. Then He came in off It was so Mike Or, Jimmy did little things like That. Once Jimmy left, I think Michael realized That He, He He was afforded a lot more leeway. Yeah. And then He. He took He, took more advantage of It. But you know, Michael is a really special person to me. And. I have a relationship with him, unlike any other relationship with, with a male That. I That, I know of, you know, And.


The reason is, is That, no one worked harder than Michael. Nobody showed up. And gave It everything. I didn't care what Michael was doing when He was away from the facility. As long as It didn't impact our ability to practice Or, what We were trying to do in a game, I, I was fine. And never once did I think That, whatever He was doing away from the facility, was affecting his play. And, I I, I love him to death. I think the world of him, He would He met my mom. My rookie year, my mom passed a couple years ago. He met my mom. My rookie year. He gave her the biggest hug, made her feel like a million dollars.


My mom knew of some of the indiscretions That Michael had encountered over his life. But she passed loving Michael Irvin And. The reason was, is 'cause He made her feel so special. Every time He saw her, he'd go up And, give her the biggest hug. And. That's Michael. I mean, you guys know him. He's, he's just a really loving guy. And. Everyone I know loves him. And, And. It's, it's given him a lot of grace, you know, of his life. for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the, the personalities. On That, team And. Then after Jimmy, you had Barry Switzer, who's, who's a wild man in his own right, a little bit wearing like the fur coats, having some fun. He liked to drink a couple beers too, right?


Yeah. He's into wine now. And, he's still, from what I gather, He still gets after It pretty good. You know, he's Barry's 86. I was with him this past summer. He looks fantastic. Sharp as He Can Bet. Funny as all Get out. I mean, the guy is, he's, he's, he's an impressive guy. I mean, It was, It was tough those years. That He was the head coach. It was, It was challenging for me. And, I think It was for some other players. Probably On, our team, That, you know, Barry hadn't coached in quite a while. He'd never coached in the NFL. So He was On his couch. And, And, And. I don't blame him. He took the job, you know, He got offered the job. He took the job. We were defending world Champs, And, you know, He gave him an opportunity to get back into coaching with a, with a really good team.


I think It was really, It was the hiring of Barry, I think was more an indictment. On Jerry And maybe, I don't wanna say how little regard, but, but when He, when Jimmy left Jerry was, Jerry famously said, any one of 500 coaches could have done what Jimmy did. And winning back to back Super Bowls, And. I think the hiring of Barry kind of showed what Jerry thought the importance of coaching was to the success of our teams.


And, I'm a, I'm a believer in the, like I've always believed at the collegiate level, if you have really talented teams, And average coaching, you Can win a lot of games. If you have average talent, but have really great coaching, you Can win a lot of games. But in the NFL, you got have great players. And, you got have great coaching. I mean, you really got have both. If you're got bet if you're got consistently bet good And. So I I I'm one That puts a lot of value. On On the importance of coaches. Whereas I'm, I'm, I'm not certain, I'll let Jerry answer That, but I'm not certain Jerry does. Yeah, Yeah. We who were talking about this a couple weeks ago, That, Jerry has kind of, maybe he's learned from That because he's in recent history.


He's been very loyal to his head coaches. Yeah, I guess so. I, I, I don't know. I, I don't know. When you say loyal, I I, I, I'm curious as to, as to why you would say That, but Jason Garrett stayed for a long time. Mike McCarthy's, It feels like And. Mike McCarthy's won a lot of football games to Cowboys. But It feels like he's been, at least from the outside world, talked about as On the Hot Seat for a long time. Yeah. I think, you know, with Jason, I, I don't think Jerry ever wanted to have to fire Jason. I think He was hoping That. Jason would bet his Tom Landry And would bet the coach until, you know, long after Jerry passes.


But when He was in the, so-called Hot. Seat, those They had good years, you know, And. So then he'd Get re-upped And. And, you know, He. But yeah. So that's That, that's, that's where, that's where, that's where that's at. Yeah. Gotcha. Hey, have you ever met Jay-Z I've not. Do you think We look alike? I didn't say That. I was just asking We. It's a, it's a segment. We. Do We say it's a question We. Ask everyone. Have you ever met Jay-Z. Oh, really? Yeah. Now That, you mention It. Yeah. Hold On a second. We. Because there was a meme. That went around saying, I looked like Jay-Z. So, Yeah, I mean, you do, you do It. It was, That was a, That was a very funny observation.


By Over Kila, You think do look like, you think I do look like Jay. Little bit. Have you guys have never hung out before? Never been in the same room as what you're saying? No. No. I've never met him. I, I feel bad for him. That. People think I look, you know, That He looks like me. Or. I look like him. But I, I do think now in the, in the mean, I, I don't know if It was doctored in any way. Or not, but I do think We look alike in the meme. Yeah. But, but I don't think We, I don't think We look alike at all. I think if you, It is a funny meme though. Just Bet. Ready for That. Like Jay-Z If, if somebody, if the police ask him, Hey, this looks like you at this Diddy party, He might say, that's not me.

Yeah. I like That. I like That. Yeah, it's good. Have some loyalty to your take Memes. You want to, you wanna let That person in We have We We figured We finished the interview. How We started. It, let's see if he's coming in. We have Jay-Z for you. Yeah. No. We have the, the second, the second biggest Indiana Hoosier football fan. That We, know of Joe Buck. Yeah. Joe, things have not gone We for you in this interview because we've declared That. Troy is the number one Indiana Hoosier football fan. We, Who was saying He was saying That. Everyone knows That. When you, when you think of Indiana football, That, That, you know That.


I'm the First person who comes to mind. That's A fact. We did say That. And. We. Believe That We. I, I'm only here because I heard That. Troy was doing an interview. And He was trying to do It by himself. And, I Right. And. I thought I'd just jump in. Yeah. Oh, hey, Joe. Contract, right? Yeah. Whenever Troy shows up, Joe has to bet there too. Yeah. Joe, how you never talked to a, to Troy about us. That hurt our feelings. We our First question was how often does Joe bring us up? And He is like literally never. That's true. Only On way outta Arrowhead Stadium. If I ever brought you to, to, to Troy Aikman. That's pretty true.


So I told him, I said last night for the First time, you know, I mean, less than 24 hours ago. Damn. And, you're trying to hide a big part of Your life from, from Troy's you're shape of us. I don't like That about you, Joe. Yeah. Yeah. But I was effusive in how you two people have changed, at least some of my perception out there in the, in the Twitterverse, the universe. I mean, you've, I love you guys. You know That And? I told Troy, I was like, these guys are great. They're got give you shit. You got bet able to get back. Adam, don't Get fired, But Go in with your hands up And bet. Ready to, to Spar We. What, what We did for you.


That was nothing. 'cause what we're about to do for Troy in the Indiana Hoosiers And, his fandom is got bet On Overdrive Where the memes are got bet. Crazy. That's all. It's, it's Hoosiers And Troy Aikman. That's They. Go hand in hand. Troy. Say, say this. Say, say, Indiana football is undaunted. Do you want me to say That? Yeah. That's, that's their thing.

Joe's trying to jump On my bandwagon. Yeah. It's disgusting what he's doing. It's Disgusting. Disgusting. That's disgusting. That's Disgusting. Joe, this isn't really a question, And, it's not directed at anyone in particular, but America misses you in postseason baseball. Mm. I'll just say, I'll just say That. Yeah. Leave It at That. We. Where were all these people for 24? I'm glad He is Not, I, I'm glad He is not doing baseball. 'cause, because when He would do baseball, He would leave And. I wouldn't see him for a month.


But, but I I I agree with you. And. it really is. It is amazing. How many people share That sentiment That y'all have. Because I, when I'm with them, there are people constantly, especially this time of year, That, tell him how much They miss him. Yeah. Doing baseball. We Miss him. We. I think part of It is I just did It long enough where people just as associated my voice with, with kind of October baseball. Some people hated It. Some people loved It. I loved every minute of It. I'm glad I did It, but I'm also glad That, this is a football only life in, in my world these days. It's just, it's it's bet And also, God basically told you never to do baseball again.


When you tried to come back for one day this summer, And, it was rained out. That Literally happened. It literally happened. I come back one day, And. it was like It was just, yeah. Nope.

Okay, let's wrap up the show partner. Your take listeners submitted. Go. This guy's take Or. Girls who knows the major sports should all have 17 games like the NFL. Oh, I'm in Basketball. Baseball. And. NHL games would bet a thousand x more electric if there were only 17 games before the playoffs. Much bet than all the meaningless were regular season games. People love NFL And College football because It dominates one day a week. And all the games matter. Oh, On. First glance. This sounds flawless. Yeah, I'm in. But then what My sports, but then what do We do during our weekday nights? And like So May.


Yeah, true. I think if They made It, if They made the schedule correctly where It was like Tuesdays And. Sundays are NBA Mondays And. Thursdays are NHL. Wednesdays And Saturdays are college basketball. Okay. Where it's like, you know, what day has what And, it's like That Day becomes the biggest thing ever. I Like this solution, but I think We need to, We need to expand It a little bit. If We had, it's only 64 Games. Yeah. We should probably make this a little bit bigger than That. See there, I think there's, I think there should bet 52 games of every sport including football. Oh, I like That. And. So every Sunday there's football, But That would typical every Monday night Football, every Monday there's football. Every Tuesday there's basketball.


Every Wednesday night. We got hockey. 50 games, schedule for basketball, hockey, And, baseball would rock Year round would rock. Nobody gets Vacation would rock. What if it's no sports in the summer? Except like the Olympics. Just, yeah. And. Just everyone has to agree to play golf. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Everyone, Everyone. No work either. No work. Yeah. The whole, I mean that's what Europe. Europe, Yeah. Europe does. That. Yeah. I like That. I do think That, there's something to bet said for they'll never do It because owners want all the money. But NBA And NHL could bet a little like 60 games would bet. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. There's too many games right now. Baseball too. Yeah.


Yeah. Baseball should bet like one 20. But again, that's never got happen. No. Yeah. It's crazy how much of a difference there is between playoff baseball, And, regular season Baseball. It's Nuts. NHL is not as drastic, but baseball is just, it's so boring. And then it's so electric. It's Every second is electric. Oh. Did you guys hear this take? I think It was Ken Rosenthal. That talked about It. He wrote an article about the Padres And about how like the Padres are quickly becoming not America's team. Oh, how He hates the Padres because they're too flashy. This is a great quote. He said, Machado is far from the Padres. Only irritant. Fernando Tiz Jr. Is a smiling dancing peacock. Oh. Which is awesome.


I, you know what I love It because it's, we've said this a million times before, but Ken Rosenthal having this take is what keeps the world alive. Yeah. Now That Bob, You need an angry man about little, little short, angry man angry about things. That are so inconsequential. Yeah. Clutching his pearls. He said jerks. And profile is the kid who pulls the fire alarm at school. And then asks Who me? That kid was fun. Yeah. We all knew That kid. Yeah. Maybe you were That kid. Yeah, That kid was fun. Ken Al. Fuck you. You know What? Without That kid, That pulled the fire alarm. We wouldn't learn about fire safety. That's also a fact. Yeah. That was a, That was a good, That was a good kid to bet friends with saved Lives.


A simple question in light of this morning's news is Aaron Rogers, the LeBron of NFL old period gets coaches fired. Period. Ayahuasca equals vino period. Getting his children On his team. Even though They might suck. Parentheses, Hackett Lazar, et cetera. Yeah, no. He does do the getting your, your friends Or children. He absolutely does That Overrated doesn't have enough championships despite how good people say He is. Oh, I like this Hank right? Yeah. You think LeBron's overrated? Yeah. What if I said LeBron was the second best player in the history of basketball Fair. So he's sometimes overrated by one.


Yeah. Yeah. This is, I I don't know what memes, I've been rooting for this forever. And, it's happening to you. You need Devonte, You Need Devante. Devonte fixes everything. You Need Devante Dev. Fine. Everything's hit the Devonte button. I'm not a Jets fan obviously, but I think if you were a Jets fan, if I was a Jets fan, I could sell myself On. If you Get Devonte, it's like, all right, old coach, gone. New new coach, great player. Aaron Rogers, Can figure. It out. We're got bet. Fine. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't Get Devonte over Over. Yeah. I think the best way to fix this problem is by getting a, a malcontent wide receiver into a locker room with absolutely no leadership.


And. The best way to negotiate is to bet like the only thing That will save us is this one guy. Yeah. Raiders. Will you trade him to us? So It's all about Woody. Does Woody wanna win? This will go We who also Don't talk enough about the fact That. Your owner's name is Woody Johnson. Yeah. His name is Woody And. His son's name is Brick Johnson. That's kind of a cool name. Yeah. They're getting harder. Brick Johnson. I think the NBA And other leagues That do Western conference versus Eastern Conference is bet. I know there's history with a FC, And NFC, but I think a divisions with more regional makeup is bet. Wait what? Basically saying the NFL should bet Make more sense.


It should Bet like baseball used to bet before inter league Play, basically like, I guess No, but the, that's not what he's saying. 'cause baseball No, He is saying like Eastern versus Western Conference. NBA. Yeah. That's the only thing That he's saying. Okay. Because 'cause he's saying basically like the, the Is the NHL Like the Eagles should bet in the A FC is what he's saying. Yeah. And. it should bet East, west N should bet. I mean N Hhl is similar too, right? Yeah. NHL is similar. Yes. So who, what would bet the divisions if We split It into East West? Just the eastern division with N Ffc. East And, AFC East. Yeah. You'd have like, You'd just Yeah. Patriots. Yeah, Just bet East, east, west It would pretty much, it'd bet.


Pretty much like hockey. Yeah. Where like the NFC would bet like Bears Cowboys over West you six. Yeah. Or basketball. Six divisions. Yeah. I don't know. That sounds crazy. Generally I like the things, I like things the way They are. I do too. I, because I understand It And. I Get It. But it's not always the way That makes the most sense. Yeah. I mean I, yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't know if I, I Can go for this. Let's see. Command. Do you guys see It? On the Tv? Nope. Nope. We. See? NHL Homeland Stanley Cup We. See a commercial? There's a hockey Chick-fil-A Commanders would bet in division with Ravens.


Now We. See? Boobs. Eagles. Why'd you put Tits On here? Panthers. Steelers. Why did You put Tits On? Aaron Rogers are There. Tits On. On. What are there? Tits. On the screen. Yeah. On. Aaron Rogers. You photoshopped It memes. You dirty dog. That's Yeah, that's AI Rogers Shane's Back here doing That. Oh, Shane's not doing It. Shane. Nice charger sweatshirt. Dude. Shane wearing a cross sweatshirt. He texted me this morning 'cause We were out doing a video at like 8:00 AM Me And memes. He's like, Hey, I think, I think my package came Can. I open It It is your mail. I didn't, I didn't feel Right. Opening your mail without this is, this has been the most hyped sweatshirt of all time. And. it looks cool. It's Dia de los Muertos.


Thank you to the Chargers. Yeah, thank you. Hooking us up. Great Holiday. What Is the significance? It's just, it's a charger sweatshirt with the Chargers logo. On It. I Think it's like Mexican heritage. Or. So Isn't It d de los los Mus, which is like They. It's kind of the Mexican version of Halloween. Where They just celebrate everybody That's dead. Oh, now And. This is all making sells. And. Yep. Shane's got use this On a date. Could. Yeah. Shane, it's A great holiday. Likes A spicy Yeah. Look at That smile. Okay. But It was just funny. That, you're like It. It's here. Can you like It was, It was basically like a kid being like, is It Can We open the presence yet It is a federal crime to open someone else's mail.


So That's a good point. That's true. I Figured out just That's true. Send a text. That's good. That's a good point. Way to check. Okay. Is That It? There's A couple more. Would you agree to your team winning the Super Bowl in exchange for you never being able to watch another NFL game afterward for the rest of your life? Oh No. Once You need to watch the Super Bowl season, but you have to write off in the sunset. Like John La And, never watch another game. So would You, would your team bet guaranteed to never win? I would do this. So the question is, would I watch my team watch win a Super Bowl, but then I'm not allowed to watch my team Or. I'm never allowed to watch football again. Football again. Another NFL game. No. No. The Answer's no. I know I can't do It. The answer's no, I can't do It. That's too Far.


That's too far. Now, would would It bet difficult if It was saying, you Can watch your team win a Super Bowl this year, but you'll never Get to watch again. Or, you Can watch the rest of your life, but it's a guarantee. Your team will never even go to a Super Bowl. I think I still would have to watch. Yeah. I mean, I, I'm got watch regardless. Life without football would bet Brutal. It's no life at all. Brutal. Oh my God. I can't even think about It. I just move abroad. The only way I would consider It is if my team won a Super Bowl. And. I'm not allowed to watch football anymore, but my team continues to win Super Bowls, but I can't watch, but I just know That, I'm a champion. Yeah. Okay.


Last one has a hip Drop tackle been called in the a game this season. I can't recall seeing one called. Want to get your opinions. On. The NFL enforcing this rule only by fines. And not during a game. Seems like It misses the point of preventing injuries if It is not enforced in game. Yeah. I I don't think I've seen one. In fact, I've seen a couple hip drop tackles. That should have been called That weren't called, but I don't know. That. I've seen a ref throw a flag. On It. I I feel like this was the NFL just trying to scare defenders before the season. And bet. Like, hey, there's a penalty now. Don't do It anymore, right? I've seen them. Yeah. The Tackle They been called have happened. Yeah, I think someone's even been injured. On It. But yeah, They just don't Call It. It's just such a weird thing. That They tried to legislate because it's like if you tackle from them behind And, then you use your body weight to bring 'em down.


It sounds a lot like a normal tackle the way They describe It. Yeah. Yeah. I'd agree. Okay. Good questions. Should We do numbers? PF D. And it. Memes. Have you ever gotten this? No. Nope. You guys have never gotten this. Sadly, We have not. PF D Will Get It one Day. I won't. Ah. Memes is got Get. It. No PF. D. No. You fired Bala. All right. Numbers three. Yeah, sorry. 85 9 9 P.
