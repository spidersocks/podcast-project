Today is Friday, June 27th. And Hank, we did it. It's Friday. Let's go Boys. You got there. We're here two Fridays in one week. Got, there's better than that. Two Fridays in one week. Hank made a great point though. He was like, I get it mixed up because you know, it's like show days. Yeah. So like today would be Hank's Sunday. Right? And we're doing a show now. Yeah, It is. It is Thursday as we're taping this, but it's Friday as people are listening. So that counts. Yep. Yep. We had the NBA draft. Just as a disclaimer, I said at the beginning of the show, we have been playing golf for the last two days. Taping a lot of content, very out of pocket. This is gonna be a low facts show. Low facts show.


But a lot of takes. I think we should, A lot of takes. We should substitute the facts for takes. Well let's start with this. Credit to us, because we were right about Cooper Flag three years ago, almost to the day. Yep. I found the clip when we basically predicted it And we said, Cooper Flag will be the first white American that will get drafted in the one one overall in the NBA three years ago. So we were first to have it. Yeah. I think what really settled it was finding out his name was Cooper Flag. Yeah. And that he was from Maine. Yes. That's the guy that we need to be back. Also in the clip, you did say PFT, you called your shot for Grady Dick. So we'll just keep that part out. What's Grady dick up to? He's in the league.


Okay. Yeah. All Right. Well yeah, we're not, we're not far Off. No, we weren't far off. But yeah, Cooper Flag goes one one overall, which we all knew was gonna happen. There was some awesome Fire Nico Chance going on. Also, Nico Harrison, it just continues to confirm that he's a shithead and maybe an idiot because when he was talking about getting Cooper Flag one one overall, he said Fortune favors the bold. Yeah. It's a bold move. I don't know, I, that's just, that's just not how that quote works. He didn't, I guess he did do something bold, but that didn't, that's not why he got the number one pick. Maybe he's talking about the lottery. I guess. Like he was rewarded in the lottery because he was bold enough to trade Luca.


Right. Fortune favors the bold. But I did enjoy the Fire Nico Chance. That was great. Yeah. I mean, congrats the Mavericks fans. I know nothing's gonna replace having Luca, but this is a pretty good Constellation prize. Right. Really good. Worked out pretty well for you. Now this morning I tuned in to get up. Oh, did you get to watch Get up at all? I did not Watch Get up this morning. Well, You missed out because one of the first topics, should the Mavericks be favored to be the team that gives Oklahoma City a run for its money outta the West next season. Oh wow. Cooper Flagg ad Kyrie. Think about it. It seems like they're, the next one up Is Kyrie. He tours ACL. Right.


So he's gonna be out for at least a little bit. He'll be out for a little bit. Yeah. But it's fun. It's fun to think about like, we're already shitting on the thunder. Yes, Yes. Oh, you gotta do it instantly. Yeah. Yeah. Like it was disappointing. They took it to seven. Yeah, it was, yeah, it was. I'm disappointed. By the way, did you see Tyree Halliburton poor guy? I mean his, his post was very like, it, it sucked. Like him having to write that all out. But then he also had what was clearly a scheduled WWE tweet ad. Yeah. That he had to post. That was sad. That is sad. How long ago do you think he scheduled that? I don't know. He, he, well not that because he did use like co like what's happening today. He said on the upside, my character is now available in WW 2K 25.


That's good. Go cop the Dunkin Destruction pack today. That's a good way to actually make it have more interaction is to just toss something about the injury. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But that did, that did that was kinda said. I have, I have one scheduled tweet Okay. That I put in like two years ago. Yeah. 'cause I scheduled the tweets of, Pardon My Take to go out at 7:00 AM every morning that a show comes out. I accidentally did one for Mark Titus when he was on the show like two years ago. And I think I scheduled it for three years in advance. So like next year, some random day, I'm gonna post a link to part of my take featuring Mark Titus. I love that. When he is not on the show. I love that. Yeah. Cooper Flagg, by the way, the ESPN broadcast had some difficulties. They, they had, I think it was Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey, where they were doing a pan up from their shoes.


They were like, and there's Cooper Flag. Very much not Cooper Flag. Well, for a second I thought you were wrong about that take. Yeah, yeah. I was like, wait, no Big Cat said White American. Yeah. But the, I, I did see this Cooper Flagg and this obviously he has to be everything that he's scheduled to be one one overall, he is supposed to be really, really good if everything goes well for him. And he signs all of his extensions and everything. 'cause I like to just be like, Hey, this guy's gonna be incredible. He could make close to a billion dollars in the NBA by age 32. How does that work out? He has a $62 million rookie deal. And then this is all off of just like the cap right now. So the cap, if the cap goes up more, then he'd get the 30% supermax, which would be $359 million.


And then he would get the 35% supermax, which would be $509 million. Damn. No state income tax, either Big, No state income tax. It's big. So he, that would be pretty cool. That was cool. What else did you like about the draft last night? My favorite moment was Colin Murray Boyles. Yeah. Fuck. When He got drafted by the, by the Raptors. And he was just immediately like, fuck, fuck. And then I don't know how you, how you react to that. If you're the Raptors like the front office, do you like sit 'em down? You're like, do you hate us? Yeah. Well at at least they could maybe work through that Ace Bailey. Like he hates Utah. That's the funniest possible outcome for Ace Bailey. I think He was Pissed. Yeah. He is like, I'm not gonna work out for any of these teams. I want to go to a great city.


I'm gonna have a great time in. And then Utah, I was like, buddy, we got a seat for you right Here. Hank. There was some smoke Utah trying to trade for Jalen Brown. Yeah. There's a lot of rumors going around. There Was some smoke. You want Ace Bailey? I mean we, we gotta get some cap, some some cap room. Yeah. Ace Bailey said, going to Utah, I can control what I can control. They feel how they feel. But my team and me, me focusing on basketball and them doing what they're doing. So it happens. Yeah. That doesn't feel great. Get ready to learn Swig buddy. Yeah. He's not, I don't think he wants to be in Utah. No. I mean, no, he definitely does not. That was, what teams did he want to go to?


Like he's, I think it was Wizards. He was trying to engineer himself to go to the Wizards. Maybe The Wizards and the Nets and maybe Philly. No, it was the Wi Wizards. Nets and pelicans. Wizards net. By the way. Pelicans. Oh boy. Yep. That was the worst trade ever. They traded from 23 up to 13 and they gave away their unprotected first round pick next year. Actually worse than that. They gave, they have the Bucks pick as well. Yeah. The Pelicans they gave whichever one is, is better, is higher. Yeah. And if the Bucks trade Giannis, that could literally just be two shots at getting the one pick. Can You, can you do that in other sports? I don't think the NFL has that ability Right.


To say like, whichever pick is higher, you get that one. I think. I think you have to declare, You might have to declare Where it's coming from. Yeah. But yeah, in the NBA, it's like, there's so many things that you have to know about NBA transactions to become like knowledgeable at all. Yeah. About what these teams are doing. Like the different exemptions, different trade packages. It's hard to keep up with, but I am a fan of anytime a team gets fleece. Yeah. So that was, yeah. It was a fleecing. This one makes no sense. I Joe Dumars now running the Pelicans. I don't know what he was thinking. It's, is he convinced himself the Pelicans are gonna be good next year? I don't know. Because It's not even like he went up to a top five pick. He went from 23 to 13. Yeah.


The Hawks great. Credit to the Hawks. They're, I mean, the Hawks might be good. Some at some point. I, I have a take about the NBA draft. There's too many players in attendance. Too many players in, you're Setting yourself up for the bad moment where the camera's on you and you're, you're so pissed off about everything. I felt like there were 10 guys Yeah. That were waiting to be drafted last night. There Were too many players in attendance. There were way too many tears. So many tears. Yeah. Everyone was crying. I kinda liked the tears. 'cause they were, they were mostly happy tears dream Come true. That didn't come true. At least I need at least a couple guys to not cry. Ace Bailey cried. 'cause he was gonna Utah. Yeah. The and then also the fact that they do do it two nights is insane. Yeah. The second round being its own standalone night is nuts. Who was the one player that was there as a fan?


Like I think he might have even bought a ticket. He wasn't, he wasn't predicted to go in the first round. Was It the Chinese player? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. He is the highest drafted Chinese player since, not Yao, but the guy after ya that went With Bucks. Oh, Jining. Jingling. Yeah. I think that's Yi jingling. Yeah. So he's the highest drafted Chinese player to go that high. He's what, seven foot two? Yeah. He's a monster. But I don't think that he was there expecting to get drafted last night. He just showed up and he was like the little sass. He was like me. Yeah. He Picked me. He was mocked to be like the 35th. Yeah. Pick I think, I think Illa or Guy Illa maybe had him going. He was like, he's one of the guys he loves. He watches ball.


He watches ball. We also had, oh, we should say, shout out the two college basketball powerhouses of Duke and Rutgers. Rutgers Big four outta the first five picks were Duke and Rutgers players. Huge night for Rutgers. I Feel like I, that would drive me nuts if I was a Rutgers fan. It would, I know that you can spin it and say, well, it's a great night for Rutgers. Like we, you know, you see that you can go Rutgers to the Dr If you have two of the top five picks and you didn't make the NCAA tournament, that would devastate You. Yeah. Where'd they finish in in the big last year? 10th. Yeah. That's bad. It's bad. How is that possible? They just, they didn't have anyone else.


Like, they didn't have anyone else. Yeah. That would dr That would drive me nuts too. I liked, I liked a few things last night. VJ Edgecomb Good pick by the Sixers. I think Guy loves to jam it. I loved the Wizards Pick. Okay. I loved Trey Johnson. Best shooter in college basketball. Okay. Maybe him and, and K Nipple. But I feel like the wi I was thinking about the Wizards last night because I said that, I made that comment about how it sucks the life outta you to play for the Wizards. They need to change their name so bad. They gotta go back to the bullets. I agree. I think you go back to the bullets day one. Culture change, different mentalities. I'd agree. Your shooters again, Why can't they just be the bullets and it'd be a train instead of bullets.


That's great. Or a blender. Yeah. Yeah. Do You, you have no idea Or a whiskey, isn't there a bullet whiskey or something? Yes, there is. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So Bourbon. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep It, keep it ambiguous. Yeah. So much cooler if it's the bullets, but yeah. I, I love Trey Johnson. I think that was a great pick. What did you guys think about? So the Bulls picked Noah Senge from France. That's our, that's just our, our weby bait for a couple years from now. Very smart move. What'd you think though? He left his team who's currently in the playoffs. Don't Love that. I feel like he's gotta get ready for the playin though. This year. He's gonna be a play. I mean, he's gotta be a playing guy. So with the Bulls. So what's The format like in France? I don't know.


I think they're up to That's the Euro League championship. Yeah. I mean, I, I don't know. Oh, It's a Euro League championship? I think so. Yeah. I don't love that. Yeah. I mean He's, it's, it's a very French thing to do. Yeah. I, I don't really care if he's good. He is good. If he's bad, he's bad. I Think Silla had him pretty high up too, Didn't he? Yeah. That's, that's my entire take. If he's good, he is good. If he's bad, he's bad. And if He's put that on a quote card and if he's good, that's good for you. Yeah. He was to steal the draft according to my mock draft, which was me just basically pulling up my phone. Right. Right before the Bulls pick. Seeing it and being like, steal the draft. Yeah. Fleeced Also one other data point about Trey Johnson, the outfit that he wore.


Love it. What was the outfit? Oh, he wore suit, Suit top. Was it shorts or was it Capris? No, it was shorts. It shorts. It was full shorts. It was like Angus Young. He's like an ac DC guy, I'm pretty sure. Okay. But it was a, it was a great look. Loved the fashion at the draft last night, I also wrote down, I'm pretty sure the Nets just picked like the same player over and over. Is that I, they picked a bunch of like wings that can't shoot. Yep. So that, that was smart. And we had the clip of Josiah standing in the middle of the Nets war room looking for a high five. And no one even thinking about giving him a high five. It was great. You can't have that as an owner. You have to Sorry, governor.


As a governor, you have to have an established, I'm going to you for a high five guy. Either that Or just be comfortable not getting a high five. Yeah. Keep, Keep your hands in your pockets. Yeah. Be be in the corner sitting down with like a cigar in your hand looking like a governor. Yeah. Looking like an owner. And just look around the room and be like, good job, good job, good job. Everybody thumbs up. But yeah, to be standing the, in the middle of the room, like looking for a friend that doesn't speak highly of them. I also wrote down that I think the future of Duke eight is just rest in the Knippel family. Because seeing all the brothers lined up, I was like the, when these guy, when we get to the third kniple at Duke, it's gonna be on.


Yeah. Did you see the, the highlight package they put together, It is gonna be on of All the K nipple, like the dads and the uncles. Yeah. Playing basketball back in the nineties. Yeah. Flying K nipples. Yeah. They, they looked like a Duke basketball team. Yeah. It was crazy. But yes, you're right. Like it's, it is very valuable to have generations and, and like siblings that come one right after the other. So you continue that same hate you had for the first guy. Right. For up to a decade. It's wonderful. Right. Right. So they, they hold the future of the whole Duke hate in their hands. I think they can do it. What were you gonna Say? Memes? All their names start with K. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And you said the third one would Oh, would start all the hate That was worth the laugh that I didn't, I didn't deserve to laugh, but the laugh was warranted.


Yeah. They have five brothers. Once they get all, once, once they get, they, when they do KK and then they get to the third K, then the hate's gonna go crazy. Yeah. It's gonna be nuts. Good job. Me, they also had Cedric Coward got drafted last night. Yeah. And they called him Colin Coward. Yep. On the broadcast. That was fun. That was very fun. This is some high level draft talk we're doing. Yeah. That was, Hey, what Do you got for us? Nothing. Zach, what do you got for us? No matter, I just think I, no matter where you get drafted, it's, it's an insane pla or position to be in, to be like, oh, I don't want to go there. Yeah. Like, oh, I hate getting drafted in the NBA draft. Yeah. Yeah. What a m Like to be bummed out Right on draft night. Oh, No. Generational wealth for me, my family sucks. Yeah, I agree.


Also, Jay Billis might be addicted to saying three and D. Yeah. Addicted to it. It was a problem last night. That's very disingenuous of you. I counted eight times that he said three and D within the span of 45 minutes. Yeah. Jay Billis. What a great interview. What a great interview. Great. Is he a better analyst than he is a person? Oh, I that, that's a close one. That Is close. I, I don't know. I'll say toss up. We'll fi we'll figure it out later. Maybe we'll have him back on. Alright. Any other draft stuff? That's about it for me. That's About it. I, I pretty much emptied the clip Also.


I don't like the way they do trades. Yeah. They don't, you wear the hat. Yeah. The way they do the trades, it doesn't make any sense at all. Because Adam Silver takes like 30 minutes to go up and tell us about a trade that we already knew about. You got guys wearing the wrong hat on stage on draft night. It was just, I don't know. I felt like it was beneath the NBA to have that. Yeah. Oh, Cooper Flag did say he can't wait to face Jason Tatum. Yep. Does he not know? Yep, He will eventually. But does he not know about this year? Eventually. Okay. Okay. But this year, no. Cooper Flag also said that Jason Tatum was his favorite player growing up. Which Oh my God. Wanna feel old?


Jason Tatum is like 27 years old. That's crazy. Oh's 19. He's 18. 18. He was, I think he's one day younger than when LeBron got drafted. He reclassified when it was Mahaw. Right. That wore the, the Rockets hat Or No, he was 10 days older. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's gonna be a picture that you're gonna look back on like for the rest of his career. Yeah. Draft night. And people are gonna be like, what the fuck? It's like first episode of The Sopranos where they had SAT's named something different. Yeah. In the pilot. The, the other Aunt Viv. Yeah. From the first Season. First season of Fresh Prince. Right. Yeah. And we, And we just switched it On him. We switched Hank out after Year three seasons in. They did. Yeah.


And that's fucked up. Yeah. You just pretend like everything's the same. Yeah. Good fact check. You know For sure. It's three seasons. Two or three. Yeah. Oh, I don't, it was after. It was like they established. They ain't Viv. Zach Is furious Inside. And then all of a sudden I just came in into a new season. It was like, he's Like, this is your new Aunt Viv. Yeah. What the hell? I'm gonna say three. Okay. Let's, we'll talk some other stuff before we do that. Mountain Dew. You see it right here. We love Mountain Dew. It's start of golf season. Start of summer season. Grab a dew. It's warm weather. It's delicious. Summer in Chicago is finally in full swing. I'm gonna grab one right now.


Look, we got everything to look forward to. We got baseball, we got golf, we got lake days, we got backyard barbecue days. And you know what goes great with it? A delicious Mountain Dew. So nothing goes better with let's say backyard barbecue and hanging with your friends. And the refreshing citrusy kick of Mountain Dew. Were you gonna say golf? No, I gotta update and Viv update. Nothing. Nothing is better than these delicious Mountain Dews. They also have the new cans, which are in nostalgia in a can. I see 'em all around the office and I stop in my tracks. I'm like, I gotta have a Mountain Dew. I gotta do the dew. So grab a dew in the new packaging and enjoy the refreshing citrus kick of Mountain Dew.


We also have Barstool Camp coming up later on this summer. Mountain Dew will be there. We'll be drinking Mountain Dew all week long when we go to Barstool Camp. I'm very excited for that. Nothing is better, more refreshing than the citrusy kick of a Mountain Dew in the summertime. So grab a dew in the new packaging and enjoy the refreshing citrus kick of Mountain Dew. Okay. What'd you get the update after the third season? Aunt Viv was replaced. Oh, so you nailed it. Yeah. Dude. Way to go. Thanks. Nice work. Hey, I was fucking huge. Just like they replaced Joe Biden with a new guy after one year. Yeah. Were different. His ears were way different. Years were so they were connected. Way different. We replaced Hank after two episodes With the new Hank.


Okay. What else we got going on in the World? Some baseball news. Yeah. We got a new maybe potential face of the league. Okay. New pitcher, MKI. Oh yeah. For the brewers. For the Brewers. Yeah. He's sick. He faced off against s skis. He threw 19 pitches that were over a hundred miles per hour skis threw one. Ooh. Not a great look. Fors skis for old Man. Old man S skis. Old man s schemes. Yeah. Okay. That was good. And that's it. I like that update. We should, that's a fucking good update. We Should just, that's a name that we should know though. Oh, I got a, I got a baseball trivia thing that I just saw randomly. I think it's a week old, but it's pretty cool. Did you know that the Tampa Bay raised? It was last week. They finally reached the same amount of intentional walks as Barry Bonds.


That's Crazy. As organization. I know. We've been tracking that. Yeah. That is insane to think about. That's Awesome. Yeah. Barry Bond's also getting a statue in San Francisco, which he deserves. How big's the head gonna be? It's gotta be enormous. They, It should just be his head. It should be like a bobblehead. It should be like the city field. Apple. Yes. Just come every time they hit a home run, he comes out. Yeah. Oh, that would be awesome. Of just a big balco bottle That would rock. It Pops up and down. Yeah. I've got a Colorado Rockies update. Oh yeah, I saw this. And So the Colorado, we, we've given a lot of shit to their owner. Dick Monfort piece of shit. But it sounds like maybe he's been listening to us. Okay. And he's determined to turn the team around, make good decisions, take some matters out of his own hands.


And he promoted his oldest son. Oh. To be Chief operating Officer. That guy will be good at it. Right? Yeah. So that guy's gonna be good. Yeah. Yeah. So they're, they're, they've listened to you. They're not content to, to mi away in the slums of mediocrity. They're gonna fix out by just having his son do all the things he was gonna do. We've Heard you. We, we we're disappointed as well. And now our, my son, my fail son is going to be running the show. We're the worst team in Major league baseball history. I know. It can cure this big dose of nepotism. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, so fuck the monfort. Fuck Dick Monfort. They suck. I had, oh, Deontay Johnson. This was just a funny quote.


He said that he did ask out of that game. Remember that game? Yeah. Where he didn't go back in because he was ice cold. Yep. It was 41 degrees. Yep. And now he plays in Cleveland. He had the weirdest career of anybody. Maybe it Still Going for the NFL. Still Going, but Without a doubt. I think the weirdest season last year. Yes. That was a very weird season I had. Alright, so the last thing I had before we can get to our Mount Rushmore, an awesome interview with Ys and Whitney. We, they told some very, very funny stories. I had an embrace debate that our good friend Tom Ferelli texted me. I think he found this online. But do you think Tiger Woods' career would be the same if he was named Panther Irons?


Panther Irons? I think he would, I think he would've gotten caught for the sex stuff way earlier. I do too. If it was Panther Irons, that's A sex PEs Name. Yes, it is. What, What do you think, Zach? Yeah. I don't think he has the same career. Yeah. No, I think, but what if he gets caught for it early on and then he is like, Hey, you got me guys. Yeah. I'm a sexual deviant. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna let my freak flag fly and I'm just gonna go and keep being awesome at golf. I think that there's a chance that Panther irons, that that almost sounds so over the top. That it could come around the other side and be a Mormon guy's name. True. Right. Like he might be abstinence, stay on The sex deviant thing. What if he just, so if Tiger Woods gets outed or sorry, if Panther Irons gets outed as a sex deviant very early in his career, is there a chance Panther Irons just is like, now that everyone knows, I'm just gonna lean into just being a guy who sucks and fucks all the time.


And I'm not gonna try to cosplay as a Navy Seal and then his back doesn't get hurt. There's a chance. Yeah, for Sure. This is a big time sliding doors moment. I think if he's Panther Irons, I still think he gets one The best. I think. I think he gets one. He gets one major. I think he gets a couple. He doesn't get the, the amount, Not the Panther Slam. No. No Panther irons though. That's pretty good. The Panther fist bump. What if his name was Cheetah Driver? Yes. Oh yeah. That's Cheetah Slam Cheetah. The cheetah slam would for sure happened. Heartbeat, Lion putter. Lion Putter Lion putter.


I, yeah, I think he might be better actually. Oh, I saw. Oh, I, I did see, I know we talked about it on Wednesday show, but Taylor Swift doing a full like private concert at TE was crazy. Insane. Yeah. Yep. And we would've probably been PFT probably would've been playing guitar with Her. We would've done Free Bird. I just wish we had had the opportunity to just be told No, you're not allowed. Yeah. I think they knew It Would've been so funny. They were like, yeah, here's a ticket in the very back row. Yeah. No access anywhere else. Yeah. Please don't look at the stage. I think they were like, listen, we can't bring the PMT guys around. She's gonna fall in love with Max. Yeah. We can't have that Strong Italian boy. The Philly connection.


That's Facts. That's Facts. I've got a, a soccer update talking Soccer. Oh, this would be interesting. I Mbae is suing PSG Still 19 Paris Sangerman. Yeah. Him actually, I, MBAE was probably Cooper Flag's favorite soccer player growing up. That's True. So I mbae is like suing them, I think for $60 million. Okay. In unpaid wages. And he also claims that PSG lofted him. Do you know what lofting means? No. So it's a word just trying to get the ball higher. Yeah. There you go. It's a word that's used in France to describe a practice Way to go Hank That involves isolating or leaving a player out from the main squad for sporting, administrative or disciplinary reasons.


Sounds like his teammates. It's a bad hang. His teammates just ditched him. Wait, Is it, is lofting just as a doghouse? Yeah. He was in doghouse. He's in his doghouse, But also from his teammates. So it sounds like Hank might be right. He might be a bad hang. He might, he he might be suing PSG for being a loser. Yeah. Wait, this is so lofting. So you can do that. Just ice 'em out. I would've made so much money in middle school. Yeah. Just getting, getting iced out and just be like, I'm suing you for not talking to me. Yeah. That that rules. Yeah. That lofting That was talking soccer. You don't like it, Hank That's just, It's crazy to sue for Being a bad being like bullied. Yeah. Yeah.


Like if I were him, I would not, I would not wanna make that public record. No. Yeah. You're basically like, I'm a loser and no one likes me. I'm suing for it. But that also would be such a loser move to do. That is true. True. He's Confirm. His lawsuit actually should be thrown out immediately. Because if you sue for lofting, you're actually immediately saying, this is why I got lofted. Yes. Because I'm a guy who sues for Loft. Exhibit A is the lawsuit. Correct. Yeah. That's, that's the test. So yeah. He, he, he failed it. Do you have anything, Zach? Sports World? Anything on your mind? I got, I got nothing that comes to mind for a second. I apologize for that. No, no, that's fine. You don't have to apologize. Why would you apologize? Fair? Yeah.


Okay. Good, good, good talk there. Oh, Iqua also ran a simulated NBA finals run, which I feel like is just gonna get him hurt. What is that? He kept on training. Like he was still in the playoffs all the way through the NBA finals so he could see if his body could hold up. Got it. I feel like that was so stupid, man. Was he play, he was playing like games on game Nights. He must, he must've been playing games or simulating the physical toll of full NBA finals run. Was it on 2K or in real life? I don't know. But I, that, that doesn't seem like a good idea for a guy who gets hurt all The time. No, it doesn't at all. Al also, we have, it's like the first, the first Leaf falls. It's like the sign of falls here.


The Master's commercial is a sign of spring. We have the first sign of summer and it's Ben Simmons in Wide open gym hitting threes. He looked good. He looked so good. He looked good. He had like four in A row. That's, that literally means summer's Here. I think he's fixed. Yeah. I, I saw somebody say, if you get the hat trick of Ben Simmons shooting in a gym with nobody guarding him, Zion working out. Yep. And then Luca working out. Yep. All on Instagram on the same day. I don't even Think you need Luca working out. I think you Luca just having a picture. He doesn't look fat. Or even just, it's Just a skinny picture of Luca. A report. Like Yeah. Luca Doch has been in the gym. Yeah. One, one skinny picture of Luca and all those other and those other two.


It's Yeah. Yeah. Ben Simmons. It it is like clockwork. Yeah. He does this all the time And we fall for it. Yeah. Every, well, I'm not falling for it. I'm just more like, Hey, nice summer's Here. I'm falling for it. Yeah. He's gonna be good Max. It is. I am watching it again right now and I am kind of falling for it. No, you're not. No. I, dude, he, I've, this video is 45 seconds and he has not missed a shot. Would you, you would want him on The Wizards Fixed. He's fixed. Would I want him on The Wizards? I think WI think that that culture fit would be perfect for Ben Simmons. Actually, I'd want him on the Bulls. I would want him to be interesting to talk about it and make fun of him. I would want him on The Wizards for like a week so I Could He hasn't been interesting in forever. No, but I would make fun of him Bear like he, no one even, like, he didn't, he wasn't making talk About him.


We we're making fun of him. Right now I ge eh, I guess I would want him on the Wizards just for practice. If this Any practice. Like if we had a, there's just nothing to talk about. So we gotta talk about Ben Simmons shooting, like Yeah. No, summer started, Dude. I know, but that's just what I'm saying. Like, don't give Ben Simmons the credit of being notable. Ben Simmons. Bad guy. Bad guy. Alright, well let's get to our Mount Rushmore. We have Mount Rushmore of guys we'd like to punch in the face. PFT. You can do an ad before we do That.

Before we get to Mount Rushmore. Brought to you by Mountain Dew. Nothing better than an ice cold Mountain Dew in the summertime.

We gotta get better. Zach, It's time to rally. We're Good. It's, it's time to rally. I also just wanna say I, Lisa Ann, Rochelle. Ryan, I apologize you weren't seen by one Max Diante who hates MILFs. We're gonna move on. But those women, we can take them. Those women are, well, they're not actually mothers. They play mothers, but They're, they're not actually mothers, But they play mothers. So We feel mother count. They should be seen.


And we want, we want them to be seen. Zach, the ruling was the ruling. Zach, were you, were you expecting first place? Were you confident? No, we fell off at the end. Magic was a bad pick on football. Huge miss. Yeah. You can never expect things, but I felt like we came with a strong, strong Mount Rushmore. But as far as the mill debacle, I just wanna let you know that you guys had no respect for mills. Yeah. We, we. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, mil. It's a long season. It's a long, it's a long, long season. We Went to the end. We petered out. We, we came out strong, then we petered out. Mills kind of fucked us up. We were just thinking about Mills the whole time.

Yep. I'm co-pilot One. One. We're gonna go with guy who cuts you in line. Mm. Okay. Line cutters good. Pick nothing, nothing will get the rage. Your blood boiling quicker than standing in line, which you already don't wanna be doing. And then some asshole just takes it upon themselves to just cut you. Or like, clearly they weren't there. And they go stand up with one of their friends and they's in front of you. Anybody here speak up guy. When you see a line cutter, I'm more of like a try and get the person behind me to speak up. Yeah. Or like, if someone else says something, it's like, can you believe this? I know that's I'll, I'll either try to get somebody else to speak up or I'll make like a very sarcastic, loud comment like I'm talking to somebody else.


Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. And then hope that they get the idea. They usually stay in the line, but I hope that they feel worse about it. It's, it's almost worse. I feel like I, I haven't had a line cutter in a long time. I feel like, I feel like maybe this is gonna, you know what, I'm not gonna say it. I think there's women that do it a lot more and they think they can just get away with it. I, I feel like I've been cut by women more and it's just like, they know that like, nothing's gonna happen. Nothing should happen. But they should not Cut. Well, and it's hypothetical. They should get punched in the face. You're punching a woman Line. No. Hypothetical guys who wanna punch in the Face. Yes.

We would, we would love to punch Hitler in the face. We would fucking love to punch Hitler in the face.


He probably deserved, he's probably a guy who, if he got punched in the face, like got a good beating when he was like 15 years old, maybe he would've just not been a dick. I would rather punch Hitler's art teacher in the face. That too. Give Him a better grade. Yeah. The world would be a better place. But I'd like to punch Hitler in the face. I'd like to shoot him in the face. Zach, you would also like to punch him in the face. I second that. Hitler should have got a punch in his face for Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Could have Saved a lot of people. He also, he'd kill Hitler though. Yeah, that's true. All right. One. One is gonna be people. One. Three. One three. Hour. Hour. One. One, one.

Like if we as a podcast run into Martin Sree, I know that we can like to get sued or whatever. We'd have to. We can go to jail. We'd have to, I I think we have to punch him. Yeah. Alright. Zach, I'm gonna go with 10 here. I think this is a good one. You like that one is, Yeah. 10 is strong. Yeah. Strong is very strong. Alright. We're gonna go with adult autograph seekers that cut in front of children.


They need to be punched in the face like badly. That's that. Those are the type of guys that, and they probably would sue you 'cause they feel like those type of people. That's their dream. Yeah. They'd Be like, oh, I'm suing. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Yeah. Business plan number one is to try to get like Joe Montana to autograph a football for him. Yep. Backup business plan is get punched in the face by somebody who has money. Yep. Agreed. Okay. And if it's Joe Montana, that's actually the best case scenario. Absolutely. Okay. You guys are up, We're up. Kind of a recurring guest. Not technically, officially. I know who this is. Well, yeah, it's pretty, there's only a few people that fit in that category would be fun. Darren Rale. Yep. Yep. Does he fit into that same category? He would also Yes. Sue.


Yeah. He would sue. For sure. For sure. He'd love it. Absolutely. Sue PT tried to fight him the rough row. He didn't you? Yeah, that's true. I did. I I I'm still anytime anywhere with Darren Rale. But he wanted a million dollars guaranteed. Yeah. And then our next pick we're gonna go with the limu. Imu. Yeah. Fuck that. Limu. Imu. I like that. The IMU Sucks. Limu IMU does suck.

Doug gets dragged. Yeah, He does. Okay. Where do you wanna go here Zach? I think, I think going with that last one or the second, last one I actually sent you, which is a personal one, but I think would would play for, for this room.


I think. I think we'd all like to do that. I think we can go there. Alright. I wouldn't mind punching John skipper in the face. He did, he did some shit to us. Kind of just skirted away from that. It wouldn't be the first bloody nose he ever got. That's Facts. That's facts. That's facts. So yeah, that's our third pick. It's a very respectable pick. And I hope that, I hope you get the chance one day. Yeah. For our third pick, we are going to go with people who drive on the median in traffic. Okay. Good pick. Okay. Good. Pick or not the shoulder, the median. So do, when you see Francis, do you like go up and thank him for shoulder Service? Shoulder?


Yes. Absolutely. Shoulder? No, no. He said median. Yeah. Yeah, he said median. I mean this is semantics game, but, okay. Okay. I'll, I'll let you guys have shoulder. Shoulder, but I, It's up to me. It's up to everybody Else. I mean, I think, yeah, you said median, but Yeah, I mean I would, I would give it to you. Obviously we meant shoulder, but that, but that's fine. I would give it to you if I could. Yeah. But it's up to everybody. So it's not up to me. I'm like Ron Burgy. It was, it was written out as median in traffic. Oh. Oh, okay. Who wrote it? So it's the median. You wrote median. I wrote it. I wrote it. Is it median? The shoulder you wrote Median? No, the median is, the median is like the middle of the the Middle.


Median. Middle. The middle. The shoulder is what? Is what? Everyone on China. This room knew what we were talking about. No, I thought, I thought median. But we can go media. We can, we can do the semantics route and go Media. I was ready to give it to you. But then when meme says it's written as median, you guys meant median. I can't help that. You guys don't know words. And We, we'll this is how this season of Mount Rushmore is gonna go Max. So this is how we're gonna do it. Who's Vetoing? How did the vetoing both start? I'm Open the door. Hey, you were also the first person that brought up that MILFs. Our moms. I'm just Trying to, making points. I just, the One who fought it, who fought It, MILFs, our moms. I just think that, I would expect Max to know the word that starts with media. Decide this for us.


What is, what does the median of of a road mean? That just is not the question. Oh, you asked the question. That's just not ask the Question. If you were to say that you don't like people that drive in the median, would you assume that they were talk, that they misspoke and they were talking about people who drive on the shoulder Talking the mic In traffic. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Alright. Well there's the ruling. Alright. And we're coming down to dinner in a minute. We're just wrapping up. That was good. Brian, Whitney, you'll hear him in a second. All right. Last pick someone who FaceTimes or talks on speakerphone on the train. Mm. Okay. Good one. It's bad. Good one. Alright. I think our last pick I'll, I'll tell a story behind it.


Zach. This is where I think Zach and I hopefully will be strong as a team because I'm old. He's a little younger. And what was the first, I think the first person I said to you was, do you remember what I said? I was like, who is that YouTuber. Jack Dougherty. Yeah. So Jack Dougherty's our pick because he, that guy needs to get punched so fucking bad. I, several times I really consume his work. I just see him on Twitter and I hate him. He, yeah. There's no good part of him. Yeah. That's terrible. Yeah. Yeah. And he like goes around with his bodyguards like, like fucking with people. And then his bodyguards step in for him. He needs to be punched in the face. We Had it on the list. Yeah. We had it like he's as far as like internet people go, he he's won one. Yeah. And I said that, I said it to Zach and I was just like, yeah.


Who's that YouTuber? Instantly he is like Jack Doherty. That guy's bodyguards. They they do a bad service for bodyguards. Yeah. You should not work for him as a bodyguard. Yeah. Our last pick, we're gonna go kinda similar to Revel. Just, it'd be fun to hear the sound and, and see the reaction. Although you'd probably get sued as well. Elon Musk. Ooh, That'd Be a good punch. Be a fun. Just the sound. And, and Hank has been anti Elon since like 2017. I didn't know you guys were lib Cocks in 2017. That's when he was a lib. Is That true? Yeah. Yeah. I never had too strong opinion on Elon. Yeah. No. You caught him a dork a few times. You Just said he was the fourth most person you Would want. It'd be fun to punch him. Yeah. He's on your mountain rush war. You wanna Punch in the face?


Alright. What did we miss? Be fun to punch him. Violent. What would, well, I guess I should have tried. We, it was contentious. It was already too contentious. It just would've got more contentious. But what if I said Casey Anthony? Mm. That would've Been an interesting one. We did have some bad people on the list. We had like Osama Bin Laden had Flow from Progressive. Yeah. Yeah. Hater. When You said the evil vmu. I, that's flow from Progressive. My Whitney, you talk, wait, is Flo the ones? No, that's the at t girl. Yeah. No, no, no, No. Are You talking about Lily? My face Lily from at t. Nothing but respect for her. So when we did this list, Hank very helpfully sends out a notes, a notes document. The definition of just That we can both share. Just getting a snowball going. So, So Hank sent out the notes document and it's, it's labeled guys who wanna beat up.


And it only had three people on it and it had three PE people on it for probably about two hours. 'cause I was uploading my ideas to it. And all Hank had was Hitler school principal and Darth Vader. I love it. On the list three. I love it. School principal was, I think that's a good pick. Yeah. Just Get it going. Yeah. Principal. Yeah. Everyone hates who, who likes their school principal? No one. Listen. We got ours going and, and Zach's couple of his first ones were Guy who, wait. Guy who talks too loud at movies. That was a good one. Guys who drive slingshots. Oh, cars. Yeah. I don't Like the Slingshot. Yeah. And then Joe Biden and Bill Clinton. Yeah. Bill Clinton probably should get punched in the face. Yeah, he should. Yeah. Yeah. Should There's, there's always one guy that shows up at the training camp on the Slingshot.


Yeah. For NFL season. It's like, what are you doing man? Also, Zach, my favorite one that I think was pretty niche. You wanna say it? The, the, I assume that's a Call of Duty thing. Oh Yeah. Guys who use Aimbot, they fuck all those guys. I'll say It. That's a good pick. He Said it to me and I was like, I don't know what this is, but I'm putting it on the Honorable mentions. I don't Stand on a lot, but I'll stand on that. Yeah, We had Honorable mentions. Kanye. We had Kanye as well. Okay. Yeah, we had Kanye On there. Jaden Smith? Yep. Aaron Boone. Okay. I Think everybody, even Yankees fans would put 'em on that list. Yep. Keith Berman. Okay. Yep. Good one. Jackson Mahomes. Okay. James Cordon. Yep.


MGK. Carson Wince. I kind of like M-G-K-I-I like him too. Yeah. But he'd be fun to punch. Yeah. Okay. All right. Originally, originally there was one point, it was guys like, I think the wording was guys who wanna beat up. So I'd kabib on there just 'cause like if you could beat up beat, it'd be awesome to say you could beat up to beat, but I don't necessarily wanted to punch him in the face. Yeah. We have, we so some of the other guys that we had, we had Goodell San Dusty. That's a good one. Goodell's a good one. Yeah. Fuck. Osama Bin Laden Putin. King Joffrey love to punch him. Hank had dra Alfo. Yeah. We had, let's see. Oh, blooper. Mm. Loved to punch Bopper Blooper a great one.


Brandon Walker. Al's The ADE's a big mess. Brandon Walker. Miguel. Oh, what? Why are we, why are we squabbling? Jose can Seko I put on the list, but Billy already did that for us. Took care of it. Yeah. Lake also Hardo Bicy bicyclists. Like the guys who like don't follow the rule, like they're dressed like Lance Armstrong. They don't follow the stop sign rules. They don't follow like traffic light. And then they get mad at you. Yeah. They yell at you as they're going through the intersection. Yeah. Those guys are, I, I mean, remember Sean Avery used to do videos in New York City where he would just like get in fights with every bicyclist who would put their bike in the middle of the sidewalk. And I just loved those videos. You know what I realized though, a lot of that it's, we're used to seeing that from like the car's point of view.


Yeah. But when bicyclists put videos out of pedestrians walking into the bike lane, I feel the same way about pedestrians as they do about bicyclists. Yeah. When I'm in a car. Yeah. I'm like those fucking idiots. Yeah. That's a fact. Yeah. That's absolutely a fact. What else? Any others? We had, well me and Max's brains weren't really working, so I, I threw out Stephen Hawking. Oh, that's a great pick. I like that. That's A great, I do like talking about people. You could probably, You could probably Kill him with a punch. That's phenomenal. People forget that Stephen Hawking left his wife when he was a vegetable. Yeah. He's, he's like a huge piece Of shit. He cheated on his wife as a vegetable. He was a sexual deviate And you could just tee off on Him. He also died seven years ago.


Yeah, yeah, Yeah. They had Hitler. Yeah. Remember the, didn't, didn't Jerry Sandusky not Jerry I didn't know he was doing. Jeffrey Epstein built a special submarine for Stephen Hawking. Did He? Yeah. No, wait, Jeffrey Epstein Did. Yeah. They were boys. Yeah. Oh, well. Yeah. We have Jeffrey Epstein on There. Jeffrey Epstein's a a Probably good guest. What do you guys think about Zuckerberg? Punch him too. Yeah, it'd be kind Of fun. I actually thought about the dude that played Zuckerberg and in the movie, like he's a good actor. He a good actor, but like always Michael Eisenberg Eisenberg, what I call him. Yeah. Great actor. No, no personal beef with him. I think he's good. He is a great actor. I just like, he's got a punchable Face. Yeah. Are we at Tony Roll? And I think it's more just probably the character place Too. That's, but you'd have to be doing it like in the middle of a, Ooh, I don't know.


Jet boom. Because I don't really hate him otherwise. Oh, sorry. The, the guy who replaced Adam Richmond on Man Verse food. Oh, yeah. We, that came up on the TV yesterday. I, I had no idea that happened. He Hasn't stopped talking about it. Literally since, since it came up. He's been talking about how he hates the Yeah. Man. Versus, and you get not Richmond. Oh, You're Pissed off. It'd be Brutal. And, and it was like one of those marathons and they, And we were like working and it just kept coming on. Yeah. And he was getting angrier and angrier. Yeah. Like, we, like the next day at breakfast, he would be like, how about that fucking guy who thinks he could be at In Richmond? Oh, I think I would like to punch Howie Mandell in the face too. Yeah. Yeah. No real reason.


Yeah. Blup Man's godfather. Yeah. No, no real Reason for it. Well, I mean, listen, we're just throwing these out there. Yeah. You do. You, do you think about maybe putting Mr. Bing bong on there? Not Jerry O'Connell, but Mr. Bing Bong who broke Your ear down. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I would've loved to stand up and fucking punch him in the face in that moment. And would, that would've been fantastic. What about coworkers? Oh Yeah. Hank had his, or memes had his boss. Nick smokes. You're his boss. No, I, me his boss. No, you're his Boss. Memes had hired. I might Promote you to his Boss. Hank would've played on the graphic Steven Shane from time to time. Yeah. He, I don't think he'd get that Upset. No. He'd be like, What did I do? Cool. Punch Buddy. What did, what did I do to Yeah. I did something. Yeah.


Do you guys have any other coworkers? I, No. Sometimes Hank, but Yeah, usually not. Oh, Shane. Memes. Memes have Shane. Oh yeah. Shane. I just wanted to put Shane in there.

Is he in the Ring? Tampa? Yeah. No, Merl said he is going to Tampa. I don't need him in Tampa. Alright, So w how, how are you feeling after? Because I mean, we joke, but he can't win the big one as of right now. He's still young At, how old is He? 28. Okay. He is still young. He's Got a lot of time. Win the big one. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a lot of time. That was just, that was, that was worse than last year because I, everyone was like, all right. It was the whole, I came on and talked about Crosby beating the wings. Gretzky beating the islanders. It just made, it was all lining up to be exactly as the other two legends had done it. And it wasn't even close. I mean, Florida, listen, like they got ka, Chuck got injured, so then they had all that money that, that's how they got Jones.


That's how they got Marshawn. So like that works out perfect. And then it turns out at the end of the series, Edmonton's being investigated by the league for like abusing the LTIR rule, which is Evander Cain was out. Apparently he could have come back sooner than he did. Oh, No. Well, Matthew, Matthew was actually hurt. Like he shouldn't even probably have been playing the first series. Yeah, no, for sure. But Kane was hurt. Yeah. No, wait, so you're telling I'm, I'm not dogging the Panthers. Are you saying the Oilers cheated and still didn't win? Apparently, according to the league, even though everyone's been doing this for, I don't know, 5, 6, 7 years be Longer than that. Yeah. And now all of a sudden, like, you know, kick a man when he is down, Edmonton's being looked at as possibly, that's bullshit.


I don't, I don't know what the punishment would be a fine or a draft pick or something. I don't know if anything's come out, but I don't picture this guy retiring without a Stanley Cup. Maybe it's not Edmonton. I don't know. But Edmonton's not nearly as like lost or, or in that bad of a spot the way people make them sound to be. Do you think Do now, is it, is it malpractice on the GM for the goalie situation That Yeah, that's a, that's a problem. After I was like, fuck, I, I, I said on Chicklets, like they don't have a goalie that you can win the Stanley Cup with. Now, once again, they were one game, a two, one game away from winning the cup with 'em and then a final trip again. But if your starting goalie is getting pulled and losing his job in back to back Playoffs, I don't think you have a Stanley Cup goalie.


No, Bob, you, I mean, you have Bob. Bob was like, he's gonna, he's gonna turn it on. He's gonna start shutting the door on Him. I think to his point with the goalie situation and everything, like it shows how good Connor is, what he's done for that team, bringing him to back to back finals. That's a good spin zone. I think he is the main, obviously he's got Leon too, as Batman Robin, but he is so fucking elite. It's insane. But we were, we were talking the other day, how many goalies in the NHL would you trust right now to beat Bob in a seven game series? Mm. We like brought up Pat, pat Zel and he beat him this year in five, Probably zero. Andy wasn't even, yeah, Andy wasn't even at his top At like, what he was playing at Bob.


Cut. Bob shaved his head maybe. Well, who's the blues guy? Benning Bennington. No, I, yeah, I mean, he's, he's, he's a gamer. Big games, getting big games. That's, that's, that's a good one. But there's no person in hockey choosing him over Bob. No. Bob, like, I just met, he shaved his head like two days after the cup and at the press cover had said, yeah, a new haircut, new year. I'm starting to get prepared now. Yeah. Back To work. As the Panthers were like trashing the Oilers and celebrating their dicks off. Bob even said, he is like, yeah, I don't really do this. Like I'm, I'm more just appreciative of the Moment and I'm ready for like the next season. So he's a Psycho psycho. Now, here's the problem. Full blown for the rest of the league. Like it's, it's been discussed the past two years, but for all those years, Florida was bad.


It was a sleeping giant because it was like, at some point, yeah, when they get the right ownership and they get a good team, every single guy's gonna want to go there. And it's, it's completely happened now. So This sounds like an NBA problem. This Happens at The lake of the Lakers always falling it's tax problem. So Panthers fans get mad at this too. But biz and I have been, been biz has been on it more than anyone. Biz counting everyone money There, there needs to be like something done because Well, They got biz to learn tax law. Exactly. It's crazy. Yeah, exactly. No, he's like good with like money law. Like he like some that's something right up his alley. But it's not like, it's not like the Panthers are the only team in the league that has that, right? No, no, it's Vegas. You got Nashville.


Nashville, Dallas, Tampa, Florida. Tampa, Florida are the only two in the east Eastern conference. Utah is Utah Low. I don't, I don't know if Utah is a no state tax State. Kraken Is Washington. No. Washington. Like, I think they're, is it? No, I don't think so. But the, the, the cap being what it was, right? It wa maybe it wasn't that big of a deal. And this is not taking away from the cups. It, it really isn't. But as the cap goes up and up and we're talking like in five years, the cap could be 150 million a year. Dude, you're talking about saving. Yeah. You know, $20 million. I Got a question. No state income tax in Washington. Oh, wow. Wow.


Okay. So Seattle. Seattle. I got a question. Why doesn't, This is not warm and nice all year though. That's True. Why doesn't Canada just make a law that no hockey players ever have to pay any taxes? That's a great question. Like If I were running for Prime Minister of Canada, I'd be like, first thing I do, not a single NHL player pays a single cent of tax. Yeah. Let's fucking win some Cups. I I think that, I think Canada is like, I think all those taxes are are similar to like New York, but they're not. They're not. Yeah. They gotta get rid of 'em. So Canada to get a cup again, forget going, forget not wanting to be a part of the media circus.


Like you're then mentioning like, oh, you're gonna save money too. Yeah. It's like, who is gonna sign in Canada? Free Room and board too. Yeah. Throw it all in. Yeah, everything. Like, we'll pay the, the, the government will pay the players. So if the cap goes up, it's gonna become something where like, this is a legit issue. Okay. So in my opinion, alright. Batman's stuff b in a locker room. He did saying no, He did. What about though? We, when we had biz on, we had questions from a first grader and one of the first graders asked, should Conor McDavid just try to score more? Because did he only have one goal in the Stanley Cup final? Yeah, He was, yeah. I mean, it's Florida. It's, it's Florida man. Yeah. Like, they're so good. Do you think he should try to score more? I think he's trying his hardest.


Oh shit. I think he but should shoot more. Like, I think you gotta shoot the p shoot more. Maybe. Like you should, like, I'm not, should you listen to the guys sitting in the nosebleeds and say shoot the puck every single time they cross The whole line? No. Never listen to those, those guys. No. Never. Never. Wait. I, I really, I enjoyed your reaction to the loss. I, I don't want to admit it because I like you, but in my like, you know, sicko, I wanna see what failed back of my brain. Yep, yep, yep. You guys enjoyed, I enjoyed this tweet from you. You said, I'm quietly singing Pink Pony Club and eating apple pie with vanilla ice cream. Trying not to cry. That was mid-game. That was mid-game six. Oh, That was during the game. It was. And we would've gone to game seven. It was In a, so that's the other thing. Now Can I Get a little credit?


I, I Bought. Yeah, that was, I bought a plane Ticket out there. Top shelf You were going too. I bought a plane ticket out there and I really wanted to go, but I couldn't. I Thought you were getting A plane. Well, 'cause there wasn't a game because there wasn't a game. Yeah, I know. Now Dan, I didn't think it would happen. But you, you, he had lined up a jet. I was flying to Chicago. We were jetting there. We were going, All the Chiclets guys, max was coming here. Here's the thing. I wasn't, they would've lost that game. Yes. And it would've been Worse. And I would've been so Mad at you. It could've been even worse. So mad at you because You would've bet what the plane Cost Everything on Edmonton. Yeah. Because I would've been like, I have to make the biggest bet of my life on Edmonton. Yeah. So actually you did save me money. What happened over the course of like the next two days after the cup? How deep was the hole you were in was brutal.


You didn't Tweet for Like a week. It was brutal. It was brutal. I'm, yeah, I'm done. I'm, it's season ended. I'm done. But I, I, I was just, Keith doesn't even have, I was more depressed. Not about the loss, but about like, I don't think Florida's going anywhere. Like realistically they could play again. Yeah. And I dunno, I don't how, how if they get Marshan and Bennett back. Like, I think if they lose Blat, I, I still think they'll be fine. If Marshan and Bennett come back, they're, they're probably gonna win two more. I heard That Marshan was gonna, the le what? I saw Marshan going to the lease. Maybe That's Biz Well, biz Biz said that. Yeah. Oh, I saw a really convincing Photoshop Biz tweeted out a text message. So he, you know, he edited it so he couldn't see the name.


It said Marshan to Toronto, four years, 9 million a year. It's done. And, and I said, who was that? He like some guy, some guy Is himself. He texted Himself. Yeah. Okay. Alright. So I have a que a real question, hockey question because obviously it was talked about with Mc David's press conference after he's got one year left. Yes. Do you think there's any chance they trade him? Because like, if you're, if you think he's gonna walk, you have to trade him. Right? Have to. You can't. I think the only way Oilers fans would ever have a Right, maybe I'm not word, the only way an Oilers fan could tell me they hated Conor McDavid is if he doesn't tell them, listen, I'm not resigning.


So they get nothing for him. Right. John Devar, I get, I get that, I get that. Like, you gotta at least put them in a position to get something like Right. Toronto's getting nothing from Mitch Marr. Like that's, that's crippling. If he were to tell them that and move on, like I would as an Oilers fan, I get it. And maybe it's 'cause I played, I'm like, this guy gave you everything 10 years and it'll be 11. I mean, he gave you everything he had. He was like, I I, that's probably a huge disconnect with former and current athletes and fans. But to me it's like, dude, he got drafted, he went there, he was incredible. They went to two Stanley Cup finals. He wanted to leave. I Yeah, it would suck. But it would be his Yeah, No, didn't Right, because you couldn't do it.


Now, would you, are you prepared for if he asked for a trade where when he gets trade from Edmonton for us to become the biggest Conor McDavid fans On whatever team? I wouldn't really get, I wouldn't really get that. Yeah, but he can too. He, no, he'll stay it. But then we'll just, I Wouldn't, that would be, that would be, that would be one of your worst looks. Well this is, they, that would be like a true, like, wow. They're like real losers. No, but I mean we we're totally fine. Appreciate greatness. What it's about appreciating greatness. Right? I thought you've been trying to educate us about Conor Mcda for the last five years. Yeah, no, I And now we're finally starting to come around on it. Yeah. We're starting to And you're, you're starting to sound like you're a hater, But if you're coming around on it, then why would you not like him an Edmonton?


We did Like this year McDavid fan or a Oilers fan? I, I wasn't Fan. They're biggest both. They're Just rooting them against you. I'm a McDavid fan. They're rooting against Me. Right. So, but if Mc And that saw how the Oilers treat the guy, but I actually don't mind it. 'cause as I said in Chicago, like I now have, my Sundays are like, who's playing the bears and who's playing the red suits? And being able to root against two different teams is so great for me. And like just, and almost, and like you said, hoping that one of your teams get to the Super Bowl and then like, oh my God, if they lose this one, it's even better. All you should just do a, the Fas are never Getting to the Super Bowl. No commanders. No. You should do a boosted DraftKings parlay every week. That's just a fade. Yeah. Is Ryan, Fuck These guys.


Parlay. Yeah. Commanders and fade the, oh, That would rule. Would it be better or worse if you got traded to the Kings? Well, for me, What's the worst? Yeah, what's the worst place to get traded? Like, he ends up on the maple leaf somehow. Fucking, Oh my God. Whoa. That's like the end of the pilot. I didn't even think of That. I didn't think about that either. But that would be, you would actually have to like, break up with Vince. Yeah. Would be, you would have to be like a marriage counselor. It would be, yeah. I Know. I don't think, I don't know if he wants that madness, but he might. No, he wants, he wants it. He wants it. He wants that madness. Dude. Don't even put that in the universe. Oh. And, but David signs a short extension, which like, that's like rumored, like he maybe signs a two year extension. So he is three years left on the Oilers.


Yeah. Then if Oilers fans still are mad when he leaves, if they don't win, it's like, dude, he, he tried everything. That's 13 years he Gave you. Right. What was all that about him wanting to talk to his agent afterwards? That was, he was like, I gotta talk to my agent before making statement. So that there was a quote that we played on Chiclets that was a little, like, somebody asked him about basically the core there and how everyone's young and there's still time. And he was like, yeah, he was kind of like, yeah, I guess like, I guess or something. Something that was like, it doesn't necessarily scream like, yeah, I can't wait to come back with this group. So Now you, you like read so far into that. It was probably Ev everyone's reading so far, there's never been a, I mean there's never been a player like this.


That's, you know, Sid was always boom, he signed with Pittsburgh the minute he could ovy boom, he signs with Washington the minute he could, like there's never been a player that's like coming up upon free agency and, and isn't locked in. Is he the biggest free agent ever, ever? If he gets there ever? Oh yeah, For sure. I don't, not even close. What what Super, what, what, what, what? LeBron generational players. LeBron. LeBron. When he did like that whole like touring, going around seeing, Yeah, we're not talking NBA. Yeah. Wait, you think That's, oh, hockey. It's not even close. He's number one. Yeah. Not even. No, I meant including NBA. No. 'cause LeBron was right. Okay. So respect for LeBron. Yeah. I mean, well he is more famous, right? If we going like, who's In the Us Who's more talented?


McDavid or LeBron? I don't know enough about basketball. I'd have to ask. Like, I would say with like con like LeBron had like, he's six eight, two hundred and fifty pounds. Like he's physically dominant. Yep. Like if Conor McDavid walked in here right now, you'd be like, Hey. Like you wouldn't think he was Yeah, that's a good point. Who he is. So I think for what he has, he's got more out. He's a better, more skilled, more Skilled. Yeah. Like if McDavid was the size of Tom Wilson and this good, it would be like, well he's, he, but he's, he's not, he's like, I don't know what, six one buck 90. Yeah, He's six one. He's pretty, he's taller than you think. Yeah. Yeah. He's taller than you think. Could You kick his ass?


No, I can't kick anyone's ass. No. What literally, wait, Ian, did you ever have an off season where you, you said you had to talk to your agent first? I think the, the whole play, when you say up, talking to my agent is not, if I'm the GM of that team, I'm like, oh boy. Yeah, because usually, I don't know. I mean, he's such a different level. You just don't know. Right. Like, My thing the whole time has been that dry Seidel resigned last summer. So with one year ago you're allowed to resign. And I was like, all right, Connor's coming back. Right. Because why would Leon have signed up if was like, yeah, I am not sure yet. Now Grinnell's argument is like, well he could, he, he knows that he's so good as well, that if McDavid leaves he'll be like, trade me too.


Right, right. So what about the rest of the east? Let's say Marshawn doesn't resign. Where would he go? Fuck. I don't know. Like I, I, I actually could see him going to Toronto. Yeah. They paid him. Wait biz actually might be right. No, That's to Other teams. Like, I don't know. My thing with Marshawn is I think like he was so shocked to get traded and, and not be a Bruin for life. Then he goes to Florida and wins. He's probably like, I'll just stay here. And then I did two teams, but I got a cup with both. Right. I don't see him. It's, he's everyone's like, he's been underpaid his whole career. Which is true like by a lot. But he's still made 60. Right? It's so, it's like, yeah, it's not like he's Still eating. Well What about, did you guys see the 500 K bill at 11 from the Panthers?


Beautiful. That's insane. Yeah, that was on our podcast. Oh, you guys broke that news? Yeah, that was our news. Who told you that? That was ours. Matthew Chuck. Matthew. Chuck. Who fuck pays for We do spit check with Said Dave. It Was comp. They said we had a, they said we had a call. He was like, Marcie went to go back in to pay. Which if you're going back in to pay, you haven't been underpaid. Yeah, but he has. He has. And, but it's, he was going back in and Matthew goes, yeah, I think he forgot that we had a $500,000 comp. Oh my God. Was it itemized? That's incredible. I never saw the It's receipt. Brus had the legendary, one of the receipt of like 110 Giant. Why didn't you go to 11? You were a Panther. I was already, I was up here for the summer.


We So you guys met when you guys were both on the Panthers, right? Who Me? And Yeah. No, we Met when I was like six. Yeah, But then you guys No, we weren't on the Panthers together. I Thought you were for like a Week. No, no. He came, he signed Two years after. Yeah. When you guys were never on an n Hhl Team together. No, never gotta to play together. But we both got to play with biz. So that's the real win, right? Yeah, this is True. We trained together. Together every summer. Did they talk about which, which days on the Panthers? Like when you got there, It was legendary Legend. Yeah, it's legendary. Like you walk in, you see the mural, you understand. And it's, but like he, he downplays it. Like he played for the team. Like he could, he could we'll take him as a fan.


Yeah. Like if he wants to come over, he wore that jersey biz never wore the Toronto Maple leaf jersey. He's light the candles on national tv. Like we will take wit. Wait, you were on the coyotes with biz? Yeah. What was your first, when you first met biz, what were you like, who is this guy? What's Wrong with this guy? So he, I, I called Witt. He's like, he's like, oh, you guys just picked up biz whatever. He is like, mark my words, you're gonna hate his guts the first three days and then you guys will be boys. And he hit it on the head. Like, we almost fought really first practice. Why, Dude, you guys don't get biz at that age. Like he was a fucking Psycho Idiot. Well, I remember he was like, he was daisy smarter Idiot.


No, like, like the loudest person in the locker room. Mario Lause walking around. Mark Rickey's walking around. Yo, yo, yo, Mario won. Grab lunch, dude. Portobellos or whatever. And, And he's not even like, they could just cut him any, any moment. Oh dude. But then like, somebody would be like, dude, that's Mario, like, you don't really like, and he'd be like, whoa. Oh, whoa. You know, see if he wants how up. So like, he doesn't even get like, how, So our captain in Phoenix, Shane Doen, like the biggest warrior ever. The guy was a fucking animal. Animal. Like the trainers used to have to beg him to come on the table to get some work done. So he never would go in the trainer's room. He was just like a fucking pro.


Thor bread. So he's on the table, the f like biz, his first day. Like he like did something to his hip or whatever. And he walks in and he's on the table and biz first day like, oh, donor on the table again. So the trainers are like, No, Like don't say that. Donor gets up. He's usually the like, donor's. Usually. The last guy on the ice, he was the first guy on the ice waiting like skating around. He's like, I'm gonna fucking kill this kid. I, and then I almost fought him that first day. Why? Because I saw what happened with donor. Donor was my guy took care of me. So I like, whatever something happened then I like, kind of like speared him or whatever. And he's like, let's go, let's go. Drops his gloves. I go in practice. In practice. He's about, he's like shaking his gloves. I go, bro, you drop those gloves, the sticks going over your noodle.


Does, does that happen a lot? Are there fights in practice a lot When you're struggling? When the team like the, did they let 'em just fight? Yeah, the legendary one was when the blues were in last place. They had a fight between Bertuso And Bert Bertuso and the kid from Mass, Zack Sanford. Zack Sanford. And, and Bertuso tuned him up. But like it, something clicked. Now whether it was that or not, I don't know, but the team just caught fire and you know, there was, there, there needed to be some release in practice where, but they happened not, not crazy common. I just love the story of biz going into the training room and it's probably this guy's nightmare to be made fun of being in the training room. Exactly. Yeah. And then That's why he didn't go in all his Worst fears come true when biz was, This is when biz was selling his clothes.


I Remember he was like the first Yeah. Selling his clothes teller to get like a million Instagram followers. Twitter. Twitter, Twitter. Twitter. Twitter. Twitter. Twitter. Yeah. He was selling his clothes. He'd like offer guys deals on like t-shirts and shit. He was Wait, so when, when did it click that you became friends With biz? Three days after. What happened? So I used to, I'd never drove to the rink. I'd always get rides. I just hate driving. So I'm there and like the guy that drove me, he was like, Hey, I gotta bounce, find another ride. Last guy there biz. I'm like, oh God. I get in the back. He's got like a Toyota Camry and it's like, there's a, a hockey stick in between like the, the handles in the back with all of his clothes hanging. I'm like, Hey dude, you ever think you need to like back up? It didn't have like a backup camera.


So I'm like, oh my God. He drops me off. He like sees the house. He's like, you mind if I crash here for a couple weeks? I'm like, absolutely not, dude. I got a wife and kids like absolutely not. No I didn't have kids at time. You can see the extra bedroom. But good practice, fight story. This guy Josh Gratton that I played with was a Mutant Nail gun. Like tough as shit. Crazy tough. I love that phrase. Nail gun. So in our best defenseman at the time, his name name was Ed Joe Romanowski who was crazy tough too. But he was our best D man making like the most money they get into a fight and practice and GRS just like grabbed him and just took like 10 punches to the face. We're in the locker bathroom. I'm like, why didn't you swing back? He goes, I hit him. I go to the minors.


Hey. So he took 10 punches in the face. I'm like, oh my. This guy was a, yeah, This kid couldn't get cut. Yeah. Yeah. His skin was like double this thick as a normal person. Jesus.

That's crazy. He was so tough. I, yeah, biz, biz Biz back in Pittsburgh. Oh my, my God. It was. It was. So you got drafted then he came what, a year later? Two. He actually got drafted the year after me, but then he was pro before me 'cause I stayed in college for a couple years. Right. And then the first time I ever saw biz, I walked into Mellon Arena. 7 45 in the morning. I was the second session skating. No. Yeah, I showed up at like say 8 7 45. I was skating at nine 30 and he is middle of the ice squaring off with Dan Carc fighting like maybe the earliest fighting pro hockey history. Boys. Yeah, boys. And they were boys. And I'm like, who is this guy?


And then he came off, I'm b nasty. I'm like, I hate this kid. And I just started loving him. Once you get to know him, what he's The best, what's the, what's the draft process like in the NHL? Like do you guys, did you have a party at your house? I went to the draft. Okay. Yeah. 'cause you were high pick. I was. I was a first round pick. Most pe a lot of guys, I don't know if it's the same, would go like go to the draft. Like even if you were projected third round, they'd go see Your friends. It's not Like the NFL where you see the You there camera's on you. It is like, oh this guy's so sad that he hasn't been drafted yet. Yeah, Well No. Yeah, my draft they did, there was a guy that was like supposed to go first overall for like three years and he didn't.


And they'd pick a guy, put him on camera and then they just panned this kid in the crowd. I remember being like, oh Jay be meister. He ended up doing pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, so wait, so you went to your draft, you didn't go to yours, right? No, mine. Me. Party for Keith. Yeah. We had a party at my house. That was fun. Actually, mine was the lockout year. So only like the top 10, whatever it was, guys went, it was in like a conference room. That was SID'S draft year. And yeah, we didn't go, we had a party at my house. Like my parents had to go out, buy a computer. 'cause then, and then I got like a phone call and they're like, Hey Wayne Gretzky wants to talk to you. I'm like, why would Wayne Gretzky want to talk to me? I didn't know he was the coach of Arizona. I'm like, Hey, what's up?


And he's like, welcome to the team. I'm like, oh my God. And then it was just like a crazy world. Insane mean. That's pretty incredible that you got insane. You got drafted by Wayne Gretzky. Yeah. That's like an all time moment. Did you, Did they, did you think you were gonna go when you went? Or did you think you were gonna go earlier? No, you were supposed to go a little earlier. I Was supposed to go, yeah, like second round. I got in a little trouble off ice and then Yeah. You little dropped. Yeah, Keith was a little crazy. Wait, What? What pick were you? Fifth. That's crazy. Week draft. No, Come on. Draft. Fuck off. 2003 draft after me was Biz's Draft. That's the best draft of all time. What Did biz get picked? Second round, like 45th. Oh wow. Around Pretty high. Because biz is like the greatest.


He was a defenseman. He's a defenseman then. Yeah. And he, but he was the greatest like youth hockey player of all time, right? No, I think he Was this size when He was, I thought he was. No, he definitely wasn't. I dunno who Who told you that? But they lied you? I think He might have been. He was. It might have been Zach. Wait, so wait, what round was biz in Second. Second. But that round. So that first round Was a bust. Oh, is he a bust For that? That, but he's Probably the most famous on the draft. That Scene was drafted after him. Biz Has done pretty well is a beauty. Like Cory Perry I think was drafted great Friend. I, if I'm being objective as a journalist, I'm looking at that draft.


Good Question. Oh, like if we did the redraft, where would you Do? So biz almost made the team at 18 in Pittsburgh as a D man sounds Oh No, he was a fourth rounder. He was a fourth rounder. He was a fourth rounder. I know why. I thought he was a second round Bus proof. He was good. I retract. That's bus Proof. You could be a bus You're in. No, he is not a bust. Yeah. Yeah. Not a bus at all. He the or Second. How many? Yeah, he played over what? Yeah. No, he S 200 games, right? Yeah. He's he's, yeah, he is a, they're gonna do a 30 for 30 on You. So last night we were hanging out. Whitney, you have a prediction that there's gonna be a guy in the next 20 years of the NHL who's just as good with his right as he is his left. Yeah, I, I was thinking about that this morning.


It might be 30 years. 30. But I think we're gonna get The Shhe Ott, The Shhe, Tani ambidextrous NHL player that would Rock and he'll have to have a straight, straight, Straight curve. Like Sydney, Sidney Crosby. Just straight stick. Yeah. Yeah. You have the straight stick and then you'd drive wide and be unreal. Righty. And you'd drive wide and be unreal lefty. And I mean like defending, you could switch your top hand here and there. I don't know. I just think that at some point you're gonna see things that you never thought imagine. Yeah. Yeah. In every sport we never thought showed. Or maybe Aie two gloves. Oh no stick though. No, No stick. Yeah. So we, you just Forgot that a goalie had a stick For a second. I did. Yeah. We had, It's Off season.


Some of us had a couple substances last night when we were talking about this. This prospect. True. I came up with the invention of the double curve stick. That looks like an S. Yeah. So you've got two curves in it. And then I thought about saying, what about a goalie with no stick? And then I realized that's probably not gonna work out. No, it's bad. What about a goalie with two sticks? Ooh, illegal. Illegal, okay. Illegal right there. Do They, this might be a dumb question. Do they actually measure the goalie pads before every game? Yeah. Like before every single. Oh, I don't know if it's, I think it's because that's A really good Way to cheat. So every goal you, if you look at their pads, the inside like the top has a signature on it. It's like J whatever and it's the guy has to sign off on those. Okay. Oh wow. It's like random though. But so like, No, it's every, every pad.


But you could maybe one game alter it A big game. Alter it. Yeah. Game seven Stanley Cup break out the big pads. I know. But imagine if like you won and then that new you got busted after biggest. Oh imagine The Oilers. What would they do If you had a moment where you were so happy and then they're like, Nope. Taking it away. Have to replay the game. The Greatest day of our lives, Everyone fly to that game. We have to fly back in the jet for game game eight. Turn Around. I would happily do that. You said you'd come game eight man. Game eight. Wait, did you guys ever play in a game with an Ebu? No. I had Never had that. Never where they played. Oh okay. But had him on the bench. Oh, I Bass was like an Ebu for like real players.


Yeah. He was just a bug. He, We, we had a kid in New York. We, our goalie left and like our g our assistant GM called me. He's like, Hey, do you know any goalies around? And our buddy Zo was living in New York at the time. I'm like, find some goalie pads. You're a backup tonight. Trying to get him. He, he ended up calling me back. He's like, they found a kid. So you get to the rink at what, five o'clock? Yeah, four 30. Four 30. He was fully dressed at four 30. This kid just ready for warm it all in, just ready. I'm like, guy, we got three hours. It's like, it is the coolest thing in sports. Like imagine if any other sport had that where it's Like, well that's like, some people argue it's like makes hockey look like. No, no. But it's, I think it's great.


Awesome. That's my favorite know of all the Maple Leafs. Embarrassing stats. The no cups in 67. The no conference finals. Like it's that their Zamboni driver beat them in an NHL game. They own, they own. That is the best thing I've ever heard. Oh no. Imagine if all the other sports had it. Like if they were just like picture. Yeah. Or like a basketball players, like everyone, any fan could show up in full gear and like you could just get called on. You just get in. But bi Biz said that as a player, he's like, they should have Ebu players. Like if a guy gets hurt, I'm like, guy, you don't think a guy in like the local union 1 0 8 is like, sees Brad Marshawn. If they're playing against New York, he's gonna two hand him in the face.


Yeah. Right. Like a goalie doesn't really have like a impact. Well my big idea is we pitched it to the, to some of the starting pitchers we've talked to is I think the first pitch in baseball games should count. So like 50 cent goes up and he has to pitch to Like gotta be ball. He had be on the mound, he would pick ball every Time, just every single time. Did catch Joe Burrow was joking around on those. We, I I, we spin zone it. 'cause we're friends with Joe Burrow. I think he got, I think that whole fucking fanatics thing was just like, they basically listed like, alright, what's gonna go viral? Let's make a fake viral thing here here. And they were like, Joe Burrow, we're gonna pay you like $2 million suck at throwing baseballs. Oh really way It looked. I, That's the only way I can, I can stomach it.


I think it might Be he Loves but he's throwing it like a football. I know, but they were like, you, you can, you can do this And we will pay you a shitload of money. It'll go viral. I Think it might be just misdirection. Like he doesn't want people to think he's got a good arm. That too. So he's gonna throw a Bad bitch. I wouldn't Want that. Make your enemies think that you're weak when you're strong. They Knows. Got a of an arm. Yeah. Yeah. But when you see That you've been in the league for like four years, You think to yourself like maybe Joe Burrow sucks. Now What are your realistic expectations individually of your teams this year? I'm talking about football, Cautiously optimistic. Like over 500. Cautiously optimistic. No. Like seriously. Like they're like, I Think they, I think they should, they have a tough schedule and should win. He's a six out of 10, not Nine games.


10 games maybe. Oh, I'll take the under. And If he's, if he's, if he's as bad this year as he was last year. Oh yeah, no. Alright. Right. So here's the only thing. It's over. Here's the best part about this year. I think Kale booms really good. They have set up everything with the coach, with the offensive line, with the weapons. If he sucks this year, it's over. Oh, we'll find out right away. You know what I mean? Like, if he's bad, there's not gonna be like a Oh well they don't have an Offensive line. Yeah. Second year, which Is actually good. 'cause you wanna find out And if you could switch it, you would take his guy. Right, right. Now of course I'm not gonna say that yet. Really? Yeah, of course you can. Oh, I think that's so obvious. Look at Like, look how happy is you have a good quarterback. Like we grew up with the Brady era being New England fans. Like you have a good quarterback Deep down, you know, I can't, I can't say I'm Every face in my life.


No Comment. Every, every minute, every second, every activity that I do is better because I have Jane Daniels. Right. Let's get this conversation. My days are brighter when I wake up in the morning and I'm like, what's your Expectation? Let's Get this conversation back to Connor McDavid. No. What's your expectation? Season's over like Super Bowl. Yeah. You're thinking Soupy. I'm not thinking soupy yet. You because we do have a very tough schedule. We had an easy schedule last year. This year's schedule is way, way harder. There usually is some sort of regression in the second year if a quarterback comes out like that and lights the world on fire. So I I would like to make the Playoffs again. I think we don't make the playoffs. Big disappointment. And then once we get there, yeah, I wanna go to the Super Bowl, but I I I'm not thinking like this, this year right now is the start.


It's Not your window. It Is. No, it is. This is the start of the Super Bowl window. And what is that year? Five years? Pretty much. I mean as long as you have Jayden. Yeah, Pretty much. As long as we have 'em under that first contract. Yeah. So I said after like maybe 10 or 12 weeks last year, like we're not gonna make the Super Bowl this year, but this is the start of the window where everything that we do should be with done with the understanding that this team can win a Super Bowl. So like Contracts, stuff like that. How long the entry level deals for quarterbacks You get, you get four years and then a five year extension on it. So the team can pick up option, a five year option. And any time in that five years you're really underpaying your quarterback. Yeah. So you can overpay for other guys. Yeah. Yeah. So But as like a first or whatever he was It's window isn't it? It's window.


What's he making? 10, 20? No, it's less, I think its less. The second year is like, like Yeah four signing bonus. He gets a Big sign Bonus. Like they make, like they make like 25 or 30. I'll look it up. But they could right Off the bat, but they could sign him right now to an eight Year extension. Oh no, it's it's after the third year. Yeah. You come back Because you guys were right. But it doesn't But you're not canceling the other years. No. Correct. No, it kicks in after. Correct. That's how Mahomes Mahomes won. Yeah. His first two while I'm pretty sure it was his first two while he was still Is that Right? So why would you sign? It's basically, if you look at, if you look at the NFL and, and I've had this argument with people because they're like, well what about this outside of Tom Brady who took less money? Like pretty much every year the, the Super Bowl has a team that is, has a quarterback who's on a rookie deal.


Wow. Like it's, oh really? It's pretty consistently. It might not be like they win, but like Joe Burrow obviously those Bengals teams, like you can go back and it's just, was Jalen hurt Still? No, he's not an extension. But did it, did it kick in? I'm not sure Max. I don't think he kicked in. So Yeah, he was still getting paid like the Eagles this year. Like Brock Purdy Last year, they don't even need a quarter quarterback. The Super Bowl. Eagles don't need a quarterback, you just gotta Oh wow. So you're, yeah. So getting Realistically no, the Eagles max like the Eagles. You guys could win games without a guy. Like he's not, he's not Your player. He's not your Tom. Where would you rank him? Where would you rank Jalen Hertz As like a, As a quarterback in the League start By the way, 10 80. Daniel is making two and a half million dollars this year.


Like that's what it's it's crazy. But He's really good for what he does. Right. Like what he's doing is winning and it's like it works. Whatever Max Like I'd take Dak Prescott over. What do you have Max? Like top five. He said Dak Prescott. So I'm, I'm not participating in this Conversation. Blacked out. Yeah, That's Fair. Yeah, I think it's kind of hard. I Ja Kind Jay's contract did kick in. I'm sorry, It's kind of hard to to definitively say that D Dak Prescott couldn't do it. Jalen hurts his feeling if he had that offense Running, I dunno that much. What the l Like in a bad direction. I'll say That's a for sure. I think say that quarterback Eagle goes to a Super Bowl. Look at Saquon like I think there's enough body of evidence out there with Dak Prescott.


I think we can, he's the 17th best quarterback in the NFL But he's never had a team like that. Eagles team Not That's also true. Yeah. So I'm looking up right now. Mahomes in 2019 they won the Super Bowl. He was making $2 million in 2022 when they won the Super Bowl, he was making 30, which is still so cheap for him. Then this 2023 he was making 60. So like obviously Mahomes like, they'll still be in it, but like that window of when you're paying your quarterback Yeah. Not 50, $60 million is so fucking Huge. But that, that you getting Daniels, it's crazy how it works. Sometimes you're better getting the second pick 'cause you don't have to make the decision. Well I, I Had him first. I had him ranked first. Well, I mean Unless it's like Ryan Leaf.


No, no. Oh yeah. Oh there's, there's, there's probably more times where it's worse but like Yeah you think Yeah but there's times where it's like yeah You get the decision made for you. Yeah. Yeah. That was meme what you did to Max. You wanna apologize. He won. Jack Prescott is the 17th best quarterback. Really? That's what we rank 'em. Max and Ys are the only people who've won shit in this, in this fucking Room. No Mac I'm not like chirping. I think any like Dak Prescott's never had an elite offensive line in great weapons. No, he has had Yeah, that's true. You're Right. I'm more thinking the D got there. I'm more thinking the D The defense was nasty. They d Yeah they did not have that. It like that was before. What's the Name? Who won the Eagles? The Super Bowl. Parson The offense. If you had to give up. I think they both played pretty good.


Yeah, Their offense. Saan Barkley was the best. Unbeliev. The Eagles are fucking awesome. Are The Eagles in a spot where they could get like this? Like are they in like a Yeah. Dynasty back Toback. Yeah. They could easily win it again this year. It's a big disappointment that they don't A lot of work to be done but yeah, they're in a good spot. They lost a lot of guys but you know we next man up. Yes. The next man Really Well. Yeah. Howie fucking Howie. They They Georgia. Yeah, Georgia. They just dropped Georgia. Guys Go fast. Yep. Are you guys wanna do a a bonus Mount Rushmore? Yeah sure. Should we do Mount Rushmore hockey players? Yeah, sure. It seems kind of like just hockey players Lay up. Yeah, the best hockey players, Mount Rushmore are the best hockey players of All time. Okay, we'll go All time.


Well You two, you two start. Okay, I'll go first. Wayne Gretzky. Okay, I'll go second. Connor McDavid. Okay. I can't take someone you guys already took? No, that's how Mount Rushmore works.

And I'll end my, I'll end my, so I, I'll end my team with, holy shit. Where do I go D or forward, you know who I want to take? Keith Strom?


Yeah, but, Hmm. Mark Messier. Oh, that's good. That's a hell of a team. That's how we, that's a hell of a team. That's a good guy. I got toughness like A gold. Can I take a guy I don't know that much about, but he was. Yeah. Obviously I'll, I'll take Mr. Hockey Gordy. How? Okay. Good one. That's Good pick. Can I, I want it on the graphic.

No. We're starting it when it's live on Dingers only I think will be July 2nd. All right, Hank.


Yeah. What's your fire fest of the week? My, my fire fest is my, my Friday fest. My, my Fry Fest. Fry Fest of the Week. Fry Fest. Yeah. That was really the only bad thing that happened to me this week. Tough, tough take. Didn't need to even speak up, said it for no reason. Yeah, You really, I watched it back and it PFT and I were just kind of talking and you just out of nowhere were just like Yeah, It was anti Florio. Yeah. He was trying to figure out a way to get at Florio. It's true. It's a big deal. Why you drop it on a Friday? It was Tuesday, but you know, it's July 4th week coming up. We just have been golfing for three days. I I, there's, there's not, not too much wrong going on in my life.


Yeah, that's great. Yeah. That's Great. You didn't wear a hat this week? No, I didn't. I didn't love the hats that we had for, for the, like it just didn't match my outfits. I guess I wear hat today. You The outfits guy now? No, I just, I don't know, I just, I went color weights. I went no hat yesterday. I wore a hat today. Yeah. But when no one told me that there was a sticker on my hat, which I was upset about after The, the hat that you didn't wear? No, I wore a hat today. Oh, today? Yeah, but I mean yesterday it was sunny today. It was not. You did not wear a hat in the sun. Wait, I'm trying to get blonde hair. You are. We're we were thinking about doing suning. Oh, you should bleach it. Well just natural. Yeah. I don't Like put lemon in it. Yeah. Ooh, lemon. Yeah. Yeah.


Hank you, you wore, you had a sticker on your hat all day yesterday and no one said anything today. Today. You got lofted. I got lofted. Yeah. You got lofted. You Should sue Hank loft. Would will You be suing for your lofted? Yeah, I would like to. Massive Loser. Loser. Yeah. You just fell for that. That was dumb. Walked right into that one. Hank. That is brutal Though. Actually. Does that mean if we don't sue for being lofted, that means that we are entitled to money. Yeah, we are. Whose money? I'm just saying like, if you do sue for being lofted, then that means that you should lose that lawsuit. So if you don't sue then that means that you are entitled to money.


But How do you get it without suing Catch 22. By the way, that, that just made me think of an idea. We should do Mount Rushmore of like minor embarrassments. That's a good one. Yeah. We'll do that some at some point this summer. 'cause Yeah, like that just sucks. Yeah. To, to walk around and just, I had, I had a little Like when you're at Yeah. In a, in a corporate or professional setting and someone's like, your flies down. Like it was one of you guys were like here Whatever. Don't burn them out. Rushmore dude. Yeah. Okay. That Was, that was one one pick. Okay. No, I had this, I had the thing coming out of my hat, but someone told me right away. So Was it Max? I think it was Tom Le actually. Shout out Tom Light. Good guy. Yeah. Huge. I think also with you Hank, when you wear a hat that has a sticker on it.


If I saw that, I would think he's doing it on purpose. Yeah. Like, that's cool. Guy move. It's a cool guy move that I don't know about. So I better not say anything. I I don't like it. Memes does it all the time. Not, I'm not gonna', not gonna roast it, but it, it makes no sense to ever, It bothers the fuck outta me. Yeah. You leave your stickers on your hats. I do. Yeah. What's up with that? I don't know. I think I heard one time, like it makes it inauthentic if you take 'em off. Are you Selling your hats? No, I don't want it to lose value. I Got this 1981 jets hat. Wait, do you think, are you saying inauthentic, like the resell of the hat or are you saying inauthentic?


Like someone walks up to you, sees you in a jets hat, looks to see if there's a sticker and there's no sticker and they're like, yeah, you're not Jets fan. You're inauthentic. Yeah, kind of both. I was looking at, I, I was getting rid of some hats and I have some old PMT ones that just, I took the sticker off and just dust around them Around the, where the sticker was, where The sticker was. Hats do have, They've, I can't get rid of hats or shoes dude. It's got a little problem. I actually How many hats do you guys think you have? I probably have 60 hats. Oh, I got over a hundred. Probably over one 50. I might be in like the three or four hundreds. It's insane. We should do a whole hat On. Well, just in my house. I know you have a bunch at the Office. I, no, I'm saying just in my house.


I might have that. I Need a hat room. I Have, I have a closet that's just hats that I have another closet that's hats that I wear. And are they hung up? I need to hang up my hats. 'cause that's my o My other problem is I just, I actually, all my hats get ruined by other hats. It's just the, a weight of the other hats. Push 'em down. Yeah. I mean if, if you, I pack six hats for this trope. Six. Six. Where do You put 'em? I didn't even wear one. Where Do you wanna put it? My backpack. They get crumpled up in there A little bit. I tell you can combine them. No. Can tell you the trick. Where's my backpack? You gotta do that one. I I I attach it to the strap. Yeah. 'cause if you put it in the bag it's ruined. But if you have two on there, it looks weird. That was the hat talk.


Do you think this is an episode? If we look back, it's like we, we talked about the most inconsequential things. Yeah, I'd Say So. But I mean this is, That's What this Friday is for. This is actually, yeah, it is the traditional Friday before the 4th of July week news dump. Correct. That is Hank was just early on it. Right. But he's right that like when the NFL has bad news to release it is that day. Yeah. It's always like somebody getting busted for some sort of drug. Some, some team owner like siphoning money from everybody else. It's, It's the lowest news cycle week. The year probably. Yeah. It's like this week. End of this week and next week are the lowest news cycle. Draft Draft. What? You just did the NBA draft. Yeah. But that was inconsequential.


Yeah. It was NBA draft is a thing. The lottery's more consequential than the NBA draft mean The draft not True. We don't know who's gonna be good. The draft Has been the Sixers biggest day of the last like decade. And look where it got 'em. Yeah. Process. What? You are a Wizards fan. No. Also we Crushed our NBA draft recap Max said. I know, but I I was just saying, saying guys, this isn't like enough. The whole, there is something this week, I'm, I guarantee there's weeks that are less than the NBA draft Also number one max. I'm not a Wizards fan. I'm, I'm wizards curious. I'm experimenting with the wizards. I experimented back in college now as I get older I'm like, maybe I should go back and check 'em out again.


But for the Sixers, that is like the big thing that you guys built around. Correct. The whole process. I like the NBA draft. We're focused on the NBA draft, so you should be excited about it. Yeah. I like, I like the NBA draft. Yeah. Also my dinner order last night was a disaster. Yeah, We should talk about that. Hank ate Like a 6-year-old last Night. So Yeah, I mean it, it, it boils down to this. We, you know, we had a, we had a good table. It was, it was a lot of good banter. I wasn't, I didn't look at the menu and then the guy came around and was like, what do you want? And I was just like, ah, pizza. And yeah. Everyone else, everyone else got full meals and he just came out and just with a big cheese pizza. Hey, order a large cheese Pizza sitting in front of him the entire Night.


And then I got wicked bad heartburn. Yeah. Like I haven't had heartburn. Like whenever you guys talk about it, I can't relate. And today I was like, oh fuck. It was so heartburn. It Was, I also don't think I've ever heard you say wicked once and it is like the first time we've ever recorded In Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Yeah. It was so funny though 'cause like yeah it was, I I got like a chicken parm, I think biz got a steak or some fish and you just had a large cheese pizza sitting right in front of you. Yeah. It was tough. Looked like it Was your birthday party. It was tough. Sitting next to like You're Chucky cheese Sitting next to Yandle or just chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp chirp every two seconds. It was like, yeah, no this is, it's tough to come back from this. Yeah. Y oh dude Ys was in my head. He said that he's never been out ordered.


So then I tried to tell the waiter to tell. I was like, get whatever he gets. And then he, his order was like 10 minutes long and I was like, you know what just came. He ate half of it. Yeah. Did You? That was for sure. Yeah. Did you guys see business chicken wings last night? Yeah. He doesn't eat. He eats 'em with a fork and knife. Paul Binet eats chicken wings with a fork and a knife. I've never, never been so disappointed, man. But then I looked at the chicken wings. They might have been a little undercooked. Oh okay. But still he went for it. His go-to move his fork knife chicken wing. That's crazy. Yep. That's crazy. Alright. PFT your fire fest. My favorite fest is that my, my back is fucked up. Bad back, bad back this week. That's on me. It might have something to do with my swing.


My swing coach not giving me a warmup regimen. Wait, Is it your fault? It's partially. We went over a lot of, you know, practice technique And we didn't create a physical stretching and, and training program, which is, it's gonna be implemented in when we're back. There Was a moment where someone asked PFTI was standing next to him like, how'd you screw up your back? Was it golf or something else? And PF T's like, no, I just woke up with this. I was like PFT you have been golfing like 700 shots a day. Yeah. He is like, oh yeah, that's probably golf. Yeah, It, it's it's golf related. I brought that to Hank's attention And we operated as a team and Hank's an accountability guy. He goes, that's probably not far from the truth that I might have screwed that up and not giving you warm up, but it's Yeah, the herniated disc and it's been tough to walk around.


I think I have to cancel the vacation for next week 'cause I don't think I'm gonna be able to walk around Yellowstone. But that just means wait, Seriously, that sucks. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause I, I can't like sit down and if I'm hiking that's gonna be bad. But spin zone, I get to just chill in Chicago and not do shit. Oh. And just take a, a lazy Vacation. Are you gonna golf? I Was about to say like, I'm I, I'm gonna give myself a couple days off golf. You're gonna golf get hurt again. I'm gonna take a couple days off golf. But I did, there's something magical about doing like those stretches and then you stand up and you immediately feel better. Yeah. You're like, oh, that's all I have to do. You're fixed. But then once you, once your back gets better, then you forget to do the stretches. 'cause you feel good.


Then your back gets hurt again. There. There's, it's also whenever you get injured and you wake up in the morning and you're like, I feel incredible. Yeah. And then 15 minutes goes by, you're like, oh nope. The injury's still there. Yeah. Yeah. But we got here and the, the people at the club were, they were awesome here at Great Horse. Yeah. Shout up to Great Horse. Great Horse Was fantastic Time. Phenomenal, phenomenal facilities. People were great. I got here and it was like, at its worst I could barely move my legs. And all the people were like, are you okay? Are you okay? And I was just trying to like tough it out and be fine. And then throughout the course of the week, everyone's coming up to me that works here being like, Hey, are you feeling okay? Are you feeling better? They're like babying me as I'm walking. I'm like, yes, I'm good.


I can walk. I can, I can get around. But yeah, nothing will screw up your back or you're weak like a, like a bad back. So yeah, No, absolutely nothing. So It does suck to not go to Yellowstone. The good news is Yellowstone's still gonna be there. So I'll go back at some other point. But I'm very much looking forward to having a vacation where I just sleep in. Yeah. And that's my vacation. Yeah. That's gonna rock The staycation. Yeah. Okay. My fire fest is a combined fire fest. 'cause it's combined with Max. He can chime in on Tuesday night when we finished the show, I got up to go back to our cabin and then all of a sudden I feel a kick on my shin, a light kick on my shin and it's Hank and I look down, I'm like, what?


And he just nods over memes and Max Road games are awful for these guys. So I just wanna say this for all the Awls. I know people were like, where's the show? Where's the show? It came out I think like five in the morning, six in the morning road games. They basically have to work like twice as hard. And it sucks for 'em. I don't think they've even slept. But there was a maybe hour and a half that we thought we had lost the entire recording of the show. I was thrilled including Hank's Friday moment. And it was, it sucked. We were just sitting here like, well what are we, I actually was gonna say, maybe we just don't even rerecord it because we would've, it would've been impossible to do to like, Yeah, I can't, you can't.


I'm a one take guy. Right. You can't produce gold like that twice. But Max, how can you tell me? 'cause we didn't talk after. On a scale of one to 10, 10 it's gone. It's never coming back to one. We're Okay. W where, what was the, where did it get like to the worst? I, the worst for me it got was it didn't work on memes is computer. And I was like some, oh, sometimes cards are weird for certain computers. And then we tried it on my computer and it didn't work. And then I got really nervous. What was that at? What was that seven? That was at like a, well I never got too high because whenever something like this happens, it's just call Quis, call Quis and Shuts called Quis.


And he, the first thing he asked was, can you see the size of the file? And I was like, yes. It's like the, the file size makes complete sense. He was like, that's a great sign. If it, if the file size was too small then it would've been gone forever. But as soon as he said that, I felt pretty good. Memes was freaking out throughout the, the entirety of it. Was it your fault memes when or were you gonna get the blame? It was nobody's fault. It was No, I know it's nobody's fault, but who was gonna get the blame if it had been gone? It was tense. We were just sitting here like, and there's nothing I can do. I don't know shit about any of this. I felt bad for you guys. I, I guess Me It no, it would've, it was just the, we, we were working with faulty equipment that day.


Yeah. Which it's on days like, so to put in, into perspective, we bring this road kit, which is completely different than what we have in our studio. It's like very small show that we can travel and like keep everything together. So we woke up at like five 30 that morning, took a flight, filmed a round of golf, ate dinner, and then immediately it's like, all right, you have, you have to go, you b you have very little time to really test or do anything. So we went And we te we even tested like we tested the card for like five minutes and everything was fine and then we recorded. And for some reason when we recorded the actual show, something got fucked up.


I, I think I slept for an hour Jesus that night. And memes I think slept for what? Two I I got, I got three hours. Three hours. That's crazy. Yeah. And Then we've just been up since 6:00 AM every Day. I saw every day I saw you guys at the golf course today at like seven o'clock. I was like, holy shit, you guys didn't sleep. Yeah, Me. So we're basically memes and I are just basically running on zero sleep right now boys. So yeah, I wanted to more defend you guys because I know obviously people, we have the best fans ever, but they, they're like, where's the show? Where's the show? Whenever we're on the road. Just know it might come out a little later because they also deal with wifi and getting the shows up. We Were the, we also we're always working with hotel wi wifi. That is like a quarter of the, of the speed that it is like in our normal studio.


Yeah. When when Max, when there's a delay putting the show out when we're outta the studio. That's because Max is doing it intentionally to mess with the listeners. Yeah. But we're on the road. He's actually getting it out as soon as he possibly can. Yes. Correct. What was the conversation like between you guys to try to figure out like how you would break the news in terms of whose fault it would be if it was lost? I think it's a fault thing. Pete. Pete, Pete. Yeah. Yeah. Nor normally when it's a, something was fucked up with the, I don't even know what hap like I, we still don't know what happened. I talked to Pete, he, he has no idea what happened and Well it was also two projects. Yeah. It was very funny 'cause Hank's Spidey Sense as a former producer, still producer, but former producer as well.


He saw it before I saw like he saw them just talking and he's like, there's a problem. He knows what The H tones mean down. Yeah. I mean that's happened to me many times. Yeah. And it's the worst. Yeah. So shout out to guys. Shout out to boys behind the, the cameras. Shout out Zack. Shout Zack. Fire Fest. Big shout out to Max Memes. I do, I do have a show, one for you guys. Are you guys familiar with the liver king? Yes. Big steroids. Fake abs, the whole thing. Eat raw liver. Eat the raw steak. We're In the documentary for recurring guests. Yeah. He came on the show to the top. That's huge. Yeah. Did you guys see that he has was arrested for being a terrorist and well not being a terrorist. Terroristic threats. Yeah. Telling Joe Rogan that we're gonna drive to the house, maybe two to the chest, one to the head, maybe a fist fight altercation situation.


Yes. Kind Of soft. My rogan, my fire fest goes to him, you know, bail owe $20,000 Also, he can't be within 200 yards of the Rogan family also cannot own any firearms. So full mental breakdown. Wait, don't eat raw meat. Is your fire fest? Are you like a big liver King fan? I'm not a big liver king guy. I would just like to say don't eat raw meat because of that's what can happen. You might, you can have a psychotic break, you might try to eat more carbs and less protein. Yeah. Yeah you could. That's actually a good point. This Is, it's kind of sad that like, you know, we live in the era of the true philosopher king with Joe Rogan and Liver King, two of our, our brightest minds and biggest health advocates. And to see one of 'em go off the deep end like that, I don't, I don't take any pleasure in it, but I would like to see the fight happen. Yeah.


Right. Like, Like Joe Rogan would fuck about. I think he takes him Quick. Yeah, you think so? Yeah, he's a Black, he Black pal juujitsu. Well the only thing I Liver king smells so bad that Joe Rogan True. Might get choked out by his odor. True. I, I gotta say I did not see the downfall of liver king happening. I thought that guy was really headed all together. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I really, I really thought he was just gonna total package gonna keep being the liver king. There's in no way. When we interviewed him was I like, oh yeah, we Are gonna find out. It was some like weird deer parasite. Yeah. That only exists in like elk that are found in southern Texas. This guy Zach is Right. If you wanna stay healthy, you gotta eat carbs and anything that's been like highly manufactured high fructose corn syrup, red 40, I keep your mind right.


Yeah. I had dinner with the, You had dinner with Him? I went to his, his farm and had shit dinner like the gross at like the gross dinners that he has. Wait, you Had to eat raw meat? It wasn't raw meat. It wasn't raw meat. I for it was like, it was just like very much paleo to the, to the nth degree of like, it tasted like, I feel bad because he has like a private chef that like made the meal. But it tasted terrible. It was when I was working for Caleb for Sunday conver for Sunday conversation. We di we interviewed him and then we ate dinner with him and it was like one of the most bizarre things that were Being liver king chef. That doesn't involve a lot of work, does it?


No. You're a, you're a butcher. He tried so hard to get us to eat the, the testicles and No, no one, no one ate them. Oh. And good thing you didn't, you would've been maybe trying to It's true. Be a terrorist towards Joe Rogan. Yeah. So it could be a dear parasite, but based on one of the videos that he put out the other day, I'm, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say maybe, maybe some methamphetamines might Be involved. Yeah. His eyes were Wonky. The eyes, anytime you got more than two wounds on your face. Yep. I automatically think you're doing B biker crank. Yeah. You got some weird shit going on. Alright. So yeah. Eat, eat more carbs. Eat more carbs. Stay healthy. Yeah. Okay, good. Show boys. Let's finish with lottery ball back in the studio.
