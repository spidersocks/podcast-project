Today is Friday, March 14th.


And this is March because what a day of hoops. We watched PFT, there were so many awesome games. So many a awesome finishes. My my eyes feel like they're gonna fall outta my head. But it was awesome When God made the calendar. He made February two days shorter so we could have more March. That's a fact. And thank you for doing that dear Lord. And also thank you to oldie. He's back. 'cause oldie is back back. He's in the booth right now. Oldie picks. Were red hot today. Yeah. What, five in one? Four in one. Four in one. Fired outta the game. I went four and Oh, we had a bit of a crumer at the end of there. Yeah, we we'll get to that. He knows Ball. Yeah. We'll get to that.


Yeah. Good job. Oldie. Oldie is back. Oldie. What were your impressions from the gambling cave today? Because this was your first time being around us in these high stakes situations. And we should say that if you missed the episode after the Four Nation, or excuse me, after the Allstar game, the all NHL Allstar Game. NHL Allstar Game. Oldie is our Canadian. He belong. He's he's you're you're representing the entire nation on part of my take. Yes. And He kind of belongs to us because the whole tariff Situation. Yeah. So you're ours. Yeah. That's okay. So if you didn't listen to that, go back and also listen to that episode. 'cause oldie is the man. Yeah. But yeah. Oldie. Big cat's question. What was your, what were your impressions of the cave? Oh, the, like I told the guys and girls in there tonight, one of the best ever experiences watching a basketball game.


Ever. Ever. I love basketball now. Yeah. There's mojo in there was so alive. Everyone, I felt like it was tennis match. Left, right, left, right up, down. What, what, where am I at? I get lost. Have so many great games. It's Easy to get lost in March too. When there's multiple games going on. You, you just have to make decisions and say, I'm gonna zero in on this. I'm gonna ignore this game where the second half just started and I'll get back to it. It'll be there when I'm done with this game. Right. And then we just go left. Go right back on big screen. Off big screen. Yep. And what did you think about some There was tempers at some points during the day. Oh, that's good. What did you like that? Oh, I love that. We, should we play the max video? We should probably play the max video. I know he said that his mom's gonna get mad.


Well, She probably already saw it. So what are you gonna do? I mean, it was an all time rant, but this is what March, March is, is gambling with your friends, but also just losing it. And I'll say this in Max's defense, everything that you're about to hear him say was all fair play because it was all in the confines of the gambling cave in March where you can say the most vicious things to your friends and it doesn't count. Yeah. It's between the lines. It does not count. Shake hands later should not count. You can act however you want to act. It should not count. Max. Max. Yeah. It must have been, I wanna say like 34 seconds of completely losing his brain. He lost it. He lost it. He lost it. There was zero. He went and he went. Yeah.


Well deserved though. He also is a nice refresher that for anyone who thought if Max when Max wins the Super Bowl, he's not gonna still be Max. He's still Max. He's still Max. He's still Max. Okay, here it is. This is, this is after the end of the Villanova game, which we'll get to. And, and our friend Rico Bosco said, well, max, at least I He bet you con he is like, at least I didn't rub it in your face. And Max then said this, Max, In fairness, I didn't say a word the entire game. I saw you fucking dancing. Fucking cocksucker. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Actually shut the fuck up. You fucking piece of shit Pussy. Go suck some more. Dick. Go ask. Go ask fucking Danny Hurley. The next time he comes on PNT if you can get his fucking shoelace, huh?


Pussy fucking That would, that sounded like Max. Fair enough. You know what, when in Hollywood they'll be so fucking dancing. He's played it again. He's also so far away from the microphone. Yeah. He was still so loud. Yeah. It it's, it's one of those like TMZ reports. Christian Bale caught on live. Mike freaking out. One of those were David O. Russell. Yeah. Max screams at his, his the whole, I can't even talk right now. The lighting crew. Yeah. The lighting crew quit freaking out on the behind the scenes guys Max. But that was fun. Alright. I I, I honestly, because we watched so much hoops today, I was gonna just literally scroll the scores and just anything we wanted to talk about, any games we wanted to shout out.


And the first one is Cooper Flags turned Ankle. Yeah. That looked belt chair. It looked pretty bad. It looked bad enough where I think he's not gonna be a hundred percent in the tournament. So I have a, a doctor on staff. Dr. Dan. He, he's also a Duke fan. He said that probably out for the a CC tournament. March Madness. He wouldn't be surprised if they sent him out the first game. 'cause he'll win anyway. And then probably a, a Toradol shot, steroid shot. Wrap him up. He could probably go in the second round if needed. They might keep him out both games. They could. I don't know. Yeah. I'm not. And Malik Brown got hurt too. Se separated his shoulder. I think he's gonna be out for the year. And he's, he's not like their star player. But he was a key piece.


I'm not a doctor, but on the bench you can say a sprain is worse than a break. Yeah. It wasn't a high ankle sprain. That's the only good thing for him. Yeah. 'cause it, it rolled, it rolled. It did, it didn't get caught under a anything. His, his foot is gonna just be size of a softball with, you know, very black and blue. But the wheelchair, that was, that was a tough look. That was a, that was a dude look, he might have just shot himself. This is, it might have been a Paul Pierce situation. This is why I, I, I wish better safe than, sorry. I wish players could stay longer. And I know that it wouldn't matter because he's just a freshman. But when Cooper flag got hurt today, might, if that were Grayson Allen or any other, other Duke players that I hated, I would've reveled in it.


I didn't really feel anything because I, I kind of feel bad for Cooper Flagg. He's an awesome player to watch. I hate Duke, but I wanted to have more hate and I didn't have it. Well, I don't think he's that hateable of a guy. Right. Even for a Duke player. It's because he's not there. Like he's, if he stayed a couple more years, you know, he'd start kicking guys in the balls. Yes. That would be very funny. He'd do, we'd see him cry in the March Madness tournament. Like Yes. We'd, we'd get the hate. They're just so, it's so transactional. They're in and out that I just don't even have it for him. I agree. If this was a m Roberts, if this was a plumley Yeah. We'd be like, shout out our guy though. Also now. But he's no longer at Duke. Yeah. So we like him. But Flagg Yeah. It was, it was a tough look in the wheelchair. I get that.


They, it was a long way to the training room. Yeah. That's, that's their explanation for it. But yeah, also, I, I hope he gets better. Hey, I wanna, I wanna send a message though to Cooper. Flagg Cooper. This is why you gotta go to the NBA. Yeah. No matter who drafts you, no matter who is in position to the lottery, you're risking injury. If you come back, I know you, you, you could get NIL if you came back. But this is the chance to earn life changing money for you and your family. If the Wizards get the first lotto pick, don't even think twice. Go to the NBA. Yeah. Don't listen to Andy Staples. Don't listen. He doesn't have your best interest in heart. He's got his best interest in heart. 'cause he's a college guy Also. You could have a chance to play with Weby. 'cause I don't know if you guys saw, but who, who, who got hurt today?


Fox. Yeah, Fox. He, he ha he's having pinky surgery, which is just, just reads. We're trying to tank. Yeah. Just cut it off. We're we're tanking this whole thing. Pinky surgery. Alright, so that was Duke. Duke survived. But I, I wanna see Cooper flag in the tournament. That would suck if he I agree. Mrs. Extended time. But the wheelchair was the story. St. John's rolled. Good job. Rick Pitino. BYU was a shocker. I know that wasn't like a, you know, they're, they're a very good team, but they were underdogs and Iowa State was having a good season. So BYU, the, the Mormons, we also, they were What, three and a half point underdogs. Yeah. I'm gonna get you ready for a storyline. PFT when selection Sunday, we're gonna have to do the whole discussion of where BYU gets seated.


Did they get screwed because they can't play on Sundays. Yeah. Yeah. So they have to move them around. Yeah. Yeah. So did they lose a seed because they had to fit 'em in somewhere They shouldn't have been. That would be fun. Yeah. Also in those two minutes, just play on Sundays. Yeah. Play on Sundays. You just don't, don't drink water. Just do it. Just go to hell. Ramadan just Accept like, I'm going to go to hell. But it's worth it because I get to play in March Also. God is definitely a March Madness fan. So Yeah. He'd be fine with it. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Aldi. The Texas, Texas a and MM game was insane. Yeah. Double overtime back and forth. Those two teams don't like each Other. They don't rivalry. Game buzz going after it.


Yeah. Buzz interesting decisions at the end. Yes, I would say so. But Put it, put it Lightly. Yeah. I, I root for buzz, but sometimes he makes me say buzz. What? What? Maybe your suit's too tight. Yeah, A little bit. A little bit. My Badgers beat with Northwestern needed that just for some mojo Klemm's back. So it feels good. Yeah. We did Also Indiana. Yeah. Yeah. Oldie a oldie was a Badger fan in Villanova fan today. So he went one and one. Congrats. He's wearing the Villanova shirt right now. Right now. But you gotta get the Badger stuff back on tomorrow. Oh yeah. Got a big one. Ready to go. Big one. Big tilt against UCLA. Top Of my backpack.


Ready to go. Alright. Rock and roll tomorrow. The also Indiana might be out of the tournament now. I don't know if you saw that. I did. They were the first four out. Yes. With Ohio State and I guess No Ohio State. I was Ohio State. One of the, they Were one of the first four out today. Yeah. Unfortunately. Yes. Mm. Yep. And then, yeah, let's see Texas. Texas probably played the way in Is Now in Yeah. Yeah. I'm looking at the Oh, he doesn't even update it on Twitter. No, it was, it was on the broadcast. Okay. He was doing it live on the broadcast. Leonardi. God damn. But again, Joe Leonardi is not always correct. Joe Leonardi also is probably napping right now, so. Alright. I'm trying to look to see if he updated it anywhere.


Does he not do a live Bracketology update? I think, I think he, how are you not doing it a minute by minute? I think he only does it on the air. So you have to watch the games for it. Well I know he writes an article too, but it doesn't like this. It should be out there. Should be updates every second. It's ridiculous. Max, don't you agree? Yes. Agreed. Wait, what's today's date? Oh, he did update update at six, six o'clock. My bad. Whoops. Sorry. Joe Leonardi. He did update it. Alright, last four in right now are San Diego State. Xavier, North Carolina. Texas. First four out are Indiana. Ohio State. Boise State. Colorado State. Next we're out. Dayton. Uc, Irvine, wake Forest, Villanova.


Yeah. This is the end of the run for, for Neptune. Kyle. Neptune. We'll get to that in a little bit. Yeah, We'll get to that in a minute. We'll get to that in a minute. Alright. Oh, Marquette. Xavier was an incredible game too. Xavier totally blew it at the end, although Marquette was just hitting every shot. And then Xavier with the, the shot of the day in terms of covering with a, with a half court bank shot to cover two and a half. That's what March is About. Didn't mean anything for the game. Nope. It meant a lot. Meant a lot. Meant a lot. That was real. That that's real basketball right there. Yeah. Jimmy Guard. Deep woods. Boom Boom. Shabo the Broken shaboo, the room lit up, bumping and grinding. Everyone was fired up on the coaches.


People were going dizzy. I wasn't even fired up. I didn't even, I didn't have any gun. The line. Yeah, I was still fired up. Oh, we had two buzzer beaters too. Or might had more, but Ole Miss buzzer beater on Arkansas and then Chucky Hepburn and Louisville Buzzer beater on Stanford. Yeah, Stanford. Which were Chuck, Chuck that away. Yeah. The ball was just flying around and he got it and, and perfect shot at the end. That was awesome. It is great man. This is, this is such a fun time to just sit on your ass and watch, watch sports, Watch so much sports. Oh, we got the Kentucky. Oh, that overdone. Sorry. Yeah. PFT. It's okay. DePaul with almost the upset of the day that they just fought their asses off. But we knew it.


They, they just couldn't survive double overtime. If You're buying stock in any, any program right now, I feel like you could do worse than to Paul. Yeah. If Chris Holtman stays. Yeah. Yeah. Now if he leaves, then that's, I guess that's the risk that you take. They take it out. Yeah. But this is a great penny sock. Yeah. This is a great shit coin to invest in. Yes. We should actually make holtman shit coins. Yeah. Someone probably already did. I also want to give a, just special shout out to Middle Tennessee 'cause I watched every second of that game. Absolute war. What? I, I, I haven't seen, I don't know if I've ever seen that, where Middle Tennessee hit a buzzer beater to end the game, but he got the shot off in time for it to be a buzzer beater. But it was late on the shot clock violation.


Yeah. It was tough. There was one second left. So you had, you had some of the orange on the backboard light up and then a half second later the rest of the backboard lit up. They Started the possession with 31 seconds left. Yeah. And he got it off for a buzzer beater, but it was shot Clock violation. If now, if that was the chief's plane, they would've just turned off the shot clock. Right? Yes. That's how it worked with them. Absolutely. There's been like, good basket. We're just gonna go, just pretend it didn't happen. Also, Arizona looked good against Kansas. Kansas just broken. I they're not gonna be, that's gonna be one of those ones where they're gonna be a five or six and everyone's going to say, oh my God. They're go down goes Kansas. Are Are we ready To say we, we watched them all year. They weren't good. Are we ready to say that Kansas is gonna be the five seed that you should bet against?


I It might be a six. I gotta see where they are. Lemme see. Bracketology. I Kind of hope they're five seed Is 'cause they've, they've fallen down the stretch. Let's see, Kansas six, there's six. I'm taking whoever plays against Kansas to W There you go. W there you go. Oldie. Right now they, Leonard has, its San Diego State, North Carolina as the playing game. That would kind of suck North Carolina, Kansas in the first round. If, if North Carolina won that game. It's a playing game for UNC, huh? Yeah. I mean I know they deserve it, but that, that would be shocking to see. That would be very shocking. Like those aren't playing colors. Yeah. And then the best part is tomorrow is maybe one of my favorite days of the year because, and I know I say that a lot Hank, but it's the, the matchup, sir.


The best. Yes. We got It's the creme de the creme. We got Florida playing Florida, Tennessee. Right. Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama. The big tens got great games. Michigan State, Oregon to start is gonna be great. Badgers play UCLA. I think Illinois plays Maryland. And then Purdue versus Purdue. That sucked. USC got screwed. That was a, that sucked Titus brought up a good point when we were watching that game. And that's, that Purdue still gets the Zach Edie fowls. Yeah. And Zach Edie's not there. Correct. But it's just muscle memory for the rest. It's Institutional. Yeah. Yeah. It's just carryover. But it was a great day of hoops.


I don't know what else to say. Oh, we should talk about the Villanova game Max. That was tough to watch. Yeah. No, that was just the entire season. Except for Eric Dixon played much worse than he normally played this season. That was the only difference. Go up, look good. 75% of the game. Absolute fucking pitfall. What was the run that it ended on? Because it was shocking to watch, I think a T 22 to two or something. Yeah. 22 to two. Yeah. And Dixon how Dix went two for 15 from the field. And how many points did he need to get the record? He Needed 16 points to break the all time scoring record at Villanova. And he is the highest scoring player in the, and He is the leading scorer, leading scorer in the country.


Went two for 15 in a way that ended their season, ended his career. And most likely ended the career of the head coach of Villanova, Kyle Neptune. Which Is good. Not his career. Good guy. His Villanova career. Villanova career. Yeah. But that's good. You wanted that good Guy. So who do you want, max? I don't know. I don't know the coach of Vandy. J-M-U-J-M-U coach who then went to Vandy. That's, that's probably number one on my big board. Okay. I'm seeing a lot of the VCU coach. Which Byington What For the, the Vandy coach? Yeah, yeah, Yeah. You want Spratlin?


The coach of J About Jay Wright. Jay Wright. Would I I miss those days. That's A good point. Yeah. I miss those days. And I'm sorry for every I I am sorry for yelling. No. My mom, I'm gonna get a stern talking to from my mother-in-law morning. She doesn't like when I say, when, when I say sucking dick, Can we wa can we, can we watch it again? Because I think it was the last Pussy. No, we can, we don't have to watch it again. Let's Watch it one more time. Watch it. We Don't have to watch it again. It was the last puy. Have Watch it again. That felt like, I actually think it was the first one that he said That was the, the one that says do the C. Yeah. Oh, the C one's gonna be tough to hear as a mom Sucker. No, I, I think the last pussy was, I, no one's meant it more than that moment when he called him a pussy at the End.


That was a good sign off. Can you also, my mom also does this weird thing of when I do this, she thinks that Max, you Follow campus Cuties. I don't. Oh, no. Campus cut. I don't cut Max. This is four Year. Steve, this is the for You page. Oh, no, it's not based On your algorithm. This Max. We're gonna have to put, we're gonna have to put this in the show again. That's campus Cuties.

I I Max was super upset about this and he's like, he was in here and he was like all down and he's like, I just feel like I shouldn't have said that.


I said, that wasn't for you. That was for all of Villanova's. That wasn't Your feelings man. Yes. The entire, the entire team. The entire fan base. That's not, that's how everyone felt. They just didn't say that. Eric, catch it on camera. Yeah. Oh my goodness, max. In fairness, I didn't say a word the entire game. I saw you fucking dance. You fucking Uck. Suck the fuck up. Actually fucked. Wait for the last pussy. Fucked You fucking piece of shit. Pussy. Go suck some more. Dick. Go ask.

I mean that one. Ask Danny Hurley, if you can get his fucking shoelace, That's better than get Your fucking Shine box. Please. Green. Now it's all fair. Also, shout out Texas Tech and Clemson. They were in dog fights. Those two very good teams that Clemson could, I mean, with Duke Cooper flag being out, Clemson is very live to Yeah. I mean, Clem, I think Clemson plays Louisville next. Yeah. That's gonna be a, a great, great game. And Texas Tech is playing great ball. And we did see, I, I think the most impressive thing I've ever seen on our basketball court tonight. I think it was halftime of Kentucky. Yes. Oklahoma. Yeah. Oklahoma and Kentucky. They, they brought dogs out onto the court.


I think there were two Australian shepherds and one small dog. And these fucking dogs were jumping rope. But it was also two of the dogs that were swinging the rope. Yep. Doing double Dutch. It was the little dog jumping rope. It was incredible. Red panda hot seat. Yeah. Although Red Panda still, she is the queen. She's the queen. She's the she was the big East tournament. Fanta was, was fanning out for her. It was a good time. She's She's been doing it for a long time. She's, she's been great. One of the old time goats. But I mean, I, I'd be nervous about these dogs. No, It was an incredible clip. We should get these dogs to, to the Barstool office here. I agree. I agree. Absolutely agree. Alright, so other things I'm trying to, I'm, I'm just scrolling to see if we missed something.


I, I got something. Something. Oh yeah, Go ahead. Not college basketball related. Okay. Wait, let me see if we have any other college basketball. I think that's it. Do you, Hank did you have a good day of watching college basketball? No. Oh. Does that have anything to do with I did well. Yeah. I might. Oh, good for you though. The fader, Mr. Marsh. The faders. The faders are are having a tough day. Yeah. I's got Trust the process. Hank is doing. Oh, fading me. You Know what Hank's doing right now? He's, he's doing father time is undefeated. Yeah. He's Doing the He's buying the dip. Yeah. Yeah. Just stay, stay, stay invested. Buy the dip. Yeah. Big Cat. It'll Come back up. Fading big cat's at a discount right now. This happens every year. Yeah. The market. This happens every year in the market. Dick, don't panic. Such, Any, any thoughts from you for, I know you're pretty upset about Cooper flag.


Cooper flag. No. I mean, seeing Stanford in the a CC tournament Was weird. Yeah. Well, Stanford Cal was Wednesday night. Yeah. It was bizarre. Yeah. That was my big note. Oh, okay. That's a good big note. And seeing, was it Illinois in the a CC tournament against Maryland? Shocking. What? Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the A CC. He's Marilyn's not in the a c. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. I was confused. Yeah. But we did have classic matchup of Yeah. USC verse Purdue. Love it. I love it. Need it. Need it. Maybe there's, there's not more two polar opposites of Locations.


No. They, they speak different languages. It's perfect. Oldie, did you wanna say something? No, I was just saying like, I, when you said Marilyn, I knew Big 10. Yeah. Yeah. I already knew Max Knuckles on that. Yeah. I knew. I knew. Boom. PFT can't trick you. Yeah. I was like, that's big 10. He Was like, yeah, you're right. And that's where the knuckles went. Knuckles, Boom, boom. Bump and grind. Bump and Grind sandwich. What's the other thing you have? Other thing I had, I've actually got two. So there's, I've Got a couple As well. Yeah. There's, they're doing a, another one of those bracket challenges this year. You know how Warren Buffet says like, I'll give a billion dollars to anyone that can pick a perfect bracket. 'cause it's impossible to do. Yep. Elon Oh No.


Is saying that X is launching, its X bracket challenge. Okay. If You get a perfect bracket, you win a trip to Mars. Oh, can I get the cash instead? They are, they do have a cash prize. A hundred thousand dollars cash prize. If there's, that's it. If there's no perfect bracket, I think you can also take an alternate like $200,000 cash prize if you get a perfect bracket. Okay. Kind of cheapen out. Kind of cheapen. No one's ever been to Mars yet. Yeah. So I, although I would nominate Hank to go, I don't, I don't wanna go to Mars. Me Neither. How far could you hit a golf ball in Mars though? Far, Very far, very far to earth. Very, very far. Yeah. Then the more important thing that I had also, Hank this concerns you, have you seen what's going on at UNC with Belichick?


Oh yeah. Yeah. So Apparently Belichick is telling all the North Carolina officials to copy his girlfriend on any emails that they send him. Hank, are you still there? Oh yeah. Oldie. Go ahead. What? Yeah, So, perfect. That's all I got. I'm out. What, what his 24-year-old girlfriend, she's apparently very smart philosopher, right? Yeah. She is. She's a philosophy major. He's asking his bosses to copy her on all the emails that go to him. Maybe's, just trying to stay organized. He's a busy guy.


So he is got his girlfriend as his secretary. Seems that way. Is she something along those lines? Is she The It's kinda what like, you know, in relationships, you're, you're helping each other out. Yeah. The Shadow coach at UNC. Oh. I think it's, you know, it's a, it's a family. They're trying to build a, a family program and, and this is part of it. Are they family? No. But you know, maybe You're trying to instill family Yeah. Into the program. It's like, Ms. Terry, I can I say something and listen, it's no offense to Bill Belichick. I if they have a kid that's gonna be, they can't. That would be so funny. They can't. They can't. That would be so funny. They can't hank. That would be weird.


They can't, they can do Whatever they want do. That Would be weird. They can't, it's like Robert DeNiro doesn't Robert DeNiro have a kid like every two years? Oh Yeah. That guy fucks, He's, he just keep popping out kids. Yeah. So originally he was saying that he wanted her to be copied on everything that related to social media and web content, which makes sense. Which makes sense. But that does, apparently that's expanded a little bit to other emails, including whether to accept interview requests Oh. From people. So We need to email her. Yeah. Did we get, did they docx the emails by accident? There was one email that got leaked. Let's see. Oh no. From Bill Belichick to Robbie Evans.


Mm. Cc Michael Lombardi. Mm. Thank you Robbie, thank you for the email. I am including Jordan on this email, so she can also keep up with our postings. Can you include her on anything that you sent to me? Thank you bb. Alright, so we, it's on social media, so, well that, that one's social media, but it's apparently expanded a little bit. So we need To email Jordan asking to have Bill Belichick on the show. Yes. Okay. Okay. I had, I had a couple things as well. Rory McElroy is the worst. I don't, I don't really know what's going on. Did you guys see the clip of him taking a fan's phone? No. I didn't see that. I didn't Think that was that bad. Hank. That was some cr golfers are so soft.


So here's what happened. P ft. I'm looking. Roy McElroy is in the player's championship this weekend. On Tuesday, he's playing a practice round. He hit one into the water. The guy said, oh, just like the 11th. The master, just like the masters in 2011. He goes and rets hits it, hits his sec, his second shot. This is a practice round, then goes and takes the guy's phone and just starts walking off With him. I'm looking at it right now. Yeah. Yeah. It Wasn't, that's soft. Hey. Yeah. It's, it's soft. That's insanely soft. Like what do, it's a practice round. It's true. And there, if he can't take that type of heat, I mean, yeah, the guy might be a dick. You could be like, oh, that guy's kind of a dick.


Like, why would you say that? But still, that's soft. It looked like he was also typing something on the phone. I Think he was trying to delete the video, but then he's gotta then go to the next person who took the video of the video. I, this isn't the masters. You're allowed to have a phone at Sawgrass. And it's also a practice round. Like, I would understand if this was a Sunday, he's competing for, it's the fifth major competing to win. Then it's like, alright. Yeah. That's a fucked up thing. It's a practice round. So apparently it was a collegiate golfer that did it. So what They had, Rory had 'em removed by tour security. This Is so soft. I cannot, I I I This is soft. Hank. And then the college golfer apologized.


That's soft in writing. That's soft written apology. What did RR what did Rory say about it? Rory, He doesn't wanna answer questions. He doesn't answer questions. Also soft. They Asked him like, do you wanna talk about it? He said, no, I don't wanna talk about it. And then someone else asked him about it and he said, I'm happy with my score today. Of course he doesn't want to talk about it. He stole. He stole. Yeah. He robbed the guy. That guy should press charges. There's No difference between, between him and Patrick Reed. Yeah. You can't just go and take the guy's phone. No, that's, that's crazy. If you did down the street, what would happen to you? You Get shot, punched, shot. Yeah. Punished. Punished, punched, Punished. Punched. Yeah. Pu punished and punched. Punched and Shot. Or if you want to take a farther charge charge. He stole my property.


Yeah. Yeah. You Can't do that. And he's probably got a a card on there. He's probably got his digital wallet. Yeah. Probably got some nudes. Yes. That's revenge porn. Yeah. Federal crime. Wow. Hank, I can't believe you were gonna defend him. You're too much of a golfer. Yeah. You're not the common man. You're too much of a golfer. I No. You're closer to a PGA tour pro than the common man. I'm not, I'm not completely exonerating this guy. 'cause like Yeah, he's a dick. I think you, you see Red though, like it was bad. Obviously That soft Walk away. He should have talked about it after. I'm trying to get in the head of Hank right now for why he's being reluctant to criticize Rory for being a prick. Is it, do you think that one day you could be a professional golfer? No. And you don't want fans to make fun of you.


No, But Hank you know how the internet works if this Oh my God. Kentucky's about to blow this game. You hit the over PFT. You jinxed it. Big Cat. You, I think you said Kentucky playing today Friday. Yeah, I did. Oh shit. I just heard yelling. Oh, Something happened. Okay. Kentucky's no longer playing today. It's gonna be Alabama, Oklahoma. What a comeback. But wait, holy shit. Kentucky might win. Kentucky also Might be win. This might be A double Jinx. I might double jinx it. Wow. What a meltdown. Kentucky. That's a game that, that that Cal would've, would've Won. Cal would've won. He would've had played, Cal would've won this game. You know what Cal would've had the horses. Yeah.


Alright, well I guess we'll see that people are, I'm gonna get so many tweets about Kentucky playing Bama. Yeah. If, if this ends up being Oklahoma. Alright, back to the, back to the Roy thing. You know how this works, Hank, if this guy posts the video, the internet has like brains and the internet would say, Hey dude, that's lame. Like, he would get shunned. It's, it's kind of like when someone will DM a player and the player will respond in an angry tone and they'll post it. And everyone's like, dude, why would you DM a player after a loss? Like, you're the loser here. Yeah. That guy would've been the loser here. Instead Rory flipped it and now he's the loser. And it's soft.


Yeah. It's definitely soft. He was just seeing, it was a moment of, of seeing red. He should have talked about it after. And he Should've, well, he shouldn't have done it. He shouldn't have done it. He, that, that fan who's been, there's fans there all the time at events, got in his kitchen and he lost his marbles. Wait, but hey, even now you're like, yeah, he should have talked about it afterwards. And then we said he shouldn't have done it. You're like, yeah. I guess what, what is it? What's going on, Hank? No, there's No, no. It's not what's going on, Hank? It's, it's not that serious. There's, he shouldn't have done it. But I like, when I saw the video, I wasn't like shocked. I wasn't like, how could he have done this? I, I could understand how he was like pissed off in that moment. Could you ever see Max Hoa doing this? No.


Max, Could you ever see Brooks doing this? No. No. Right. I would've done It. You would've done it. Well if it was Bo I get angry. But you could, you said Seeing red, he just kept saying, seeing red. I was like, sometimes you see Red, you could easily just walk away. You walk away. And again, if he posts that he's the Loser, you can walk away or you can, you can squeal your tires and drive away outta control. Rory also very good at doing that. Can easily Do that. Yep. Alright. Kentucky's about to inbound the ball, by the way. They were, were up 80 to 72 with one 19 left. Holy fuck. Jeremiah Fierce just took over. Oh. Oh. Got Kentucky. Oh wait, this 0.5 seconds.


Okay. Kentucky Bama. Oh yeah. Yeah. Kentucky Bama. You're Right. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta correct my tweet 'cause I said Cal would've lost this game or would've won this game. Now I'm gonna have to say Cal would would Would've this game. This game. Yeah. That would be fun. Alright. Right. So up and down a couple weeks for Popes. Yeah. Big time. Do we have a new one? No, no. He, he's recovering. Oh, really? Yeah. So he got rid of his double pneumonia. I, it's probably not like a permanent solution, but he's better now. Yeah. I also watched conclave, so now I feel like I'm an expert on that. Yeah, I know everything. Yeah. Yeah. I know everything. What an what an ending. What a day. That was incredible. Jeremiah Fear did it all there in the end.


I feel like he scored every bucket. And then Kentucky. Good job. Kentucky. So Kentucky Bama. That's gonna be fun. That'll Be great. That over's gonna be like 170. Alright. The other, the other golf related thing I had, we had a big respect the biz, if you guys, did you guys see this? Yep. It was, hold on, I gotta find it. It was Mor Cower. Right? Mor Cower basically said, I don't owe anything to anyone. Which is fine. I don't care. Like Yeah. I mean, you, you, you do owe answers. But like, if that's the, if that's kind of the attitude you wanna take, I'm not gonna be upset about it. When somebody says something like that confidently, that's one of the like most key indicators that they've talked to a therapist at some point.


Right. And he's like, yeah, I realize I don't owe anyone anything that said, you don't want to say that about like fans. You can say it to the media. No. Yeah. Yeah. And, and the media. In the media, we, we've, we've been very consistent on this. The media complains about it, but what we, what they don't realize is they're not looking in the mirror. And when a player says, I don't owe anyone anything, or I'm not gonna do media, they're literally just giving you a story. Yes. This is great. You now have a story to write about how Morikawa didn't do the media. So, and it's better than him giving a cliche answer. Yeah. When Cam Newton doesn't talk to reporters after Super Bowl loss, then you just get to write for basically like five years. Cam Newton could learn a lot from any athlete Yeah.


About how to interact with the media respectfully. But I did, like Ian McMillan, who's a senior editor at Sports Illustrated, said, Colin Ikawa said, I don't owe anyone anything. He said, yes, you do professional sports. And the money that comes with it relies on the relationship between athletes and media. I think it relies on the relationship between athletes and fans. Yeah. But the media, he's saying the media. The media. If they don't talk to the media, then no one's gonna watch the games. Then nobody knows who you are. Right. Yeah. So the media is the one. Let's respect the biz here. Carl, you are the media. Yeah. Okay. I also, we Had also on Rory, as bad as that was Rory's round today was very funny because he was just constantly driving the ball into the heart of the woods and then somehow making birdies.


Because it would, what it would do, it would like force him to lay up on a second shot. Right. And not go for a crazy long one and then knock it close. So it was a good thing. His, the worst worry is that driving, at least today, the better he was playing on those holes. Maybe he also put a scare into everyone being like, if he will take your phone Yep. He will rob you. Yep. At any moment. We also had a, this league between Micah Parsons and DeMarcus Lawrence. 'cause DeMarcus Lawrence is on the Seahawks now. And he said, on the way out, Dallas is my home, but I know for sure I'm not gonna win a Super Bowl there. And then Micah Parsons quote to you said, this is what rejection and envy look like. This is some clown shit. And then DeMarcus Lawrence replied, calling me a clown won't change the fact that I told the truth.


Maybe if you spent less time tweeting and more time winning, I wouldn't have left. Mm. This league, this League. That's some good, this league shit. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that he wasn't a big fan of Micah. Even when they were on the same team. Yeah. Maybe not. Maybe not the best of friends. Yeah. Maybe not the best of friends. I have a national sports podcast. Oh, let's go. I might've gotten got on this. I wanna say, I wanna pre preface this by saying I might've gotten got, I'll back you up. But can we, Can we fact check this oldie in real time? It's a hockey story. So can we fact check it? Yeah. He just gotta go. Okay. Go to www Yeah. google.com. There you go. That's the one. Bang. And then what are we, what are we gonna, that's a bang. All right, so here's the story that I read today. Okay. The general manager of the Utica Comets traded his son.


His son is Will McKinnon. Okay. Will McKinnon for future considerations, trade 'em to Cleveland. Okay. Not even for anything. For future considerations. Okay. Plot twist. What's A consideration? Well, it's like to consider them Like a, maybe a player to be named later. Maybe a, a bag of hockey sticks. Another, another like pox. Yeah. Yeah. It turns out bottles. The GM of the comets is his dad. Oh. So his dad traded his son to Cleveland. Traded him away. Right. For future considerations. Good. Fair. Is it, is this a, would LeBron do something like this? Mm.


Is future considerations like a grandkid? It could be. And I want a grandson. Maybe. Maybe his son has a long-term relationship, long distance with a girl in Cleveland. Mm. Trading him to Cleveland. Actually a great dad move. Yeah. That is weird. Also, this could be the mark of an outstanding general manager though. Yeah. Somebody who's willing to Cutthroat. Yeah, cutthroat. Just pure analytics. The coldest examples of sports is a business. There has to be more to this story. Right. Like there he ha his son probably asked for it. Or maybe some of the players on the team were upset that his son was getting preferential treatment. Yeah. Maybe that is. Oh yeah. Wait, wait.


Utica's last. The A L'S North division in 14th Easter. Conference. Conference. The comments will not be making the playoffs. Even a league where 23 of 32 teams qualify for the postseason. The monsters are fourth in the north division. Oh, He's trying to give his son a ring. Yeah, he's getting his son into the playoffs. I like that. That's actually a, a solid Dad move. Great. Dad move. Great. Dad move. Huge. Dad move. But it went from like, there's trouble not passing the ketchup over at the dinner table or something like that to No. I want you to go grab that ring. Yeah. Go. Go get a championship son. Go get it for us. Get a call. Make me proud. Make me proud. Get outta here. Go over to the affiliates. Blue Jackets, Cleveland Monsters and Go Cup. Is that, is that the Blue Jackets affiliate? Yeah. That's How was the, the, the game out at, at the shoe.


Oh fire. It was so good. The battle back before both teams Right. To the third period. And then CBJ just took over and five three finish. Love it. Winner. Oh yeah. What do you think about Torts? Oh, Who? Torts. Tortorella Tortorella. He's not, he's not there. Oh, he is not? No. But what do you think about him? That's real. Not what, what I was asking pf Don't try, don't try to embarrass p ft. Wait, where's Torch right now? Nobody Flyers Don't, I think, is he flyers? Yeah. Yeah. He's Don't embarrass p ft. Ask What do you think about him? I'm not embarrassed. He's, I, I'm consistent. I I'm not a diehard hockey fan. I'm a I'm a capitalist fan.


You You are. He's right. He does. But it does stand to, if you look at the transcript, you just asked what do you think about torts? Yeah. What do you think about torts? He's a hothead. I like that about him though. Yeah. He's not scared to tell people what's up. Yeah. Sometimes things are crazy. But, I mean, you didn't Let me, I was gonna say, what did you think about like tort? Do you wish he was still there? And how's his, how's he doing his job in Philadelphia? He still gives it to the guys too. Yeah, he does. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. He's not afraid to tell him What's up, dude. Yep. Yeah. Who's gonna win the cup? I said my blue jackets from before. I gotta ride on that. So you're just sticking with that? Yeah. I'm gonna have to. I think, I mean, there's obviously a lot of good teams, but we gotta ride with CBJ Fox Boys.


Is is, Is Nasher part of the, he's part of the program, right? Yeah. Yeah. He's Oh, okay. So you gotta Yeah, you gotta, you gotta ride with Them. Hard. My Hard Max. One more question for you here. Paul George being evaluated for, for multiple injuries, you think, you think is it for him? Yeah. There was also a report that they were looking to trade him in the offseason. Oh yeah. Max is struggling with, with the idea of tanking. He said that he can't watch the games. I can't, but he can watch on the, but like, Yeah. You know what? 'cause it's a sad tank. Yeah. Yeah. It's very well, but it's also the most necessary tank ever. But you should be happy because like the Bulls are gonna make the 10 seat. They, they're, they basically have sealed it up. It's insane that they're going to still be in this fucking playing game when they're so bad and they traded away Zach Levine.


And they're still gonna like, it's so stupid. But the difference is, we, we don't need a lottery pick. We need to be top six. Yeah. We're at the six spot. And the Raptors, the Sixers and the Nets are all within a half game. And if we get the seven, the seven, pick the thunder. Get our pick. So Wait, but that's after the lottery, Correct? After the lottery. Yeah. Yeah. So, but like The odds you still odds? Yeah. Yeah. Like You real realistically, we we're trying to get to five. Right. Because if you get to five, then one team can still jump you. Right. And you And we'll still get our first round pick, but we're a half a game back. It it, it's like you have to lose. Yeah. You have to Lose. Here's a compliment though.


This is a very, very fast tank. Yeah. Like mo most teams, it takes some, you had championship, maybe not championship, maybe just deep playoff aspirations at the start of the year. And to recognize halfway through that year, fuck it. Let's just be really bad. It usually takes teams a year or two to get to that, that spot. You accepted being a loser way faster than most teams do. But then this summer they're going, it's still gonna be, they're gonna be back to champion. Like you Think so? Oh yeah. They're Gonna be chip Or bus. They're gonna try and be championship. It's a one year tank. Correct. Unless MBS dead. Not dead. But knee is dead. Knee's dead.


His knee's dead. R-I-P-R-I-P knee. He's already RIP knee A few times. No. If that is the, if that is, If that is the case. If that is the case, the last thing I had was Virginia Tech who lost on Tuesday, which feels like 10 years ago. We had one of the best quotes from a player ever. Virginia Tech's, Toby Law on Virginia Tech exceeding expectations. 'cause they were 13 and 19 and they were bouncing the first round of the a CC tournament. He said they thought we were gonna be ass. I mean we, we were still ass. But you know, we weren't that bad. Yeah. Not a big ass.


It's pretty good. We weren't perspective. We weren't as ass as people thought that we were. They Thought we were gonna be ass And we were but we weren't as bad. Yeah. Suck it Haters. Yeah. Have that haters. Who does Duke play? Duke plays. U-N-C-U-N-C has the opportunity to do a very funny thing, Which is Just beat Duke. Oh yeah. Yeah. That would be funny. Yeah. Yeah. We have some awesome games tomorrow. Old. Are you ready to just strap it in and do it again? I am so stoked. I'm so stoked. I don't even think I'm gonna go back to the hotel tonight. I'm at, I just stay here. Just buzz. Just buzz around the office. Buzz around here. No, we got lot down. And just back up at it again in the morning. No, we, It's basically like getting trapped in a Chuck E Cheese.


Yeah. I can't leave. Yeah, I can't leave. I just, I just keep getting tokens and tokens and tokens. The coins don't stop. It doesn't matter. Like you want this token? Sure. You want that? Okay. Go to that game. You're done with this game. Go to the next game. Yeah. Oh, you want some food? Oh sure. Oh sure. No Problem. Yeah. Oh, you want this? No, I don't want it. Okay. Get rid of it. Send it out. Peace. See you later. Onto the next I'll crush that. No problem. You do seem like you're a little thirsty. Did you have a body armor flash IV with you? No, I don't.

Okay, here he is, Bill Raftery. Okay, we now welcome on a very, very, very, very, very special guest. He is a legend of the game. One of our all time favorites. It is Bill Raftery. You're gonna hear him? He is. He is. March. We're gonna hear him all March. Bill raft. Can I call you Raft? Sure. All right. So Raft, thank you for joining us. It's, it's awesome to to talk to you. We are getting into the best time of year. How, what's it feel like in the Rry house when we get to March and you're like, all right, here we go. This is, this is it. It's, it's pretty much the same as the rest of the year.


I get ignored at five o'clock. My wife says, do you want to eat here or go out? And I always say, well, let's eat here. And she says, well, we eat here. I have to go out and get some food. So end up going out. So nothing's really changed, you know? Yeah, Yeah. For me, it, for me it has though. I mean, it's, life goes on a little bit for everybody else, but pretty much like today was consumed with Zooms. We did a, a media day yesterday. It was internal stuff. So the, the last two days were more catch up on stuff they wanna do and marketing media things they've been working on kind of a deal, you know?


Yeah. Yeah. So other than that, it's, look at tape, the unknown this week is I've got Big East Games tomorrow night, and that's, you know, the, whoever wins tonight plays the winner tomorrow. That kind of a deal. Yeah. And then Thursday leave for Indiana, and we've got Big 10 on Saturday and semi Saturday and final Sunday. And then Sunday night after the teams find out, we find out where we're going. Love it. It's pretty much the same kind of a deal as every year. Yeah. And I, I imagine that you get to know these teams pretty well, especially the ones that you cover in the, the conference tournament.


But I also read that you still do a ton of prep going into each game. You've got like binders and binders filled of notes. Do you still do that? I I think everybody has their own deal. You know, it's just like you guys, you know, you learn how to tee it up and what works for you and what's expedient. I guess the nice thing is with all the travel, even though you're not doing their games, you sort of catch up with other teams. You know, whether it's Auburn or like we even had Duke this year at all. But certainly they catch your eye. You wanna see how good they are, that, that type of thing. So it's, you, you're more into the games you're gonna be doing because they're immediate and then you surface order the rest of them and start to catch up.


Like, next week we'll have eight teams to prep for starting Monday morning. Yeah, Yeah. And probably of the eight, I would guess I'll have had four of them, and the other four you start on right away on Monday morning, you know? I love it. So, I mean, you, you've been doing this for so long and, and like I said, you are like one of those announcers that it, it just feels right when it's March. And I'm hearing you on the call. I have a question about your, your career and, and your famous onions call. I want to get into all your calls, but do you remember your first onions? Do you remember the first time you did it? And what, and what, how it came to You? I work with a guy that's a genius and a pain in the neck guy by the name of Iron Eagle.


And the bird remembers everything. He, he'd be a terrible partner, you know, to be married to because he, he doesn't forget anything. He never gets over the past. And we, he claims we were doing an Orlando net game, and it was one of those bad net years, you know, like a 15, 18 and 35 deal. And Kevin Edwards made a jumper against the Magic, and I, for the first time, said onions. And he looked at me like, like, what? Where did that come from? And basically that I had never even thought of it, said it, but it was, it was appropriate, you know, for the moment.


And, and the interesting thing about it, I used it a couple more times, and ESPN said to me, we don't want you to use that. So I stopped using it, knowing that they were sending the checks, obviously. Right. And then some writers started using it in their articles. And I got a call from ESPN. They said, you know what, you can use that again. So that's how that whole thing started. Yeah. It's amazing, the transformation, but it's, it's a nice way of saying something that captures the moment when these kids just do uncanny things at, at so many important moments.


Yeah. And it, it is, it, it, it is a, a great call that, like some of the most iconic moments you can hear onions in your head. Do, do you have a a, a bar for double order? Like do you have a, do you have an internal Alright. Not, you know, can't do it too early. Can't do it too early in the game. It's gotta be later in the game. It's Gotta be Oh, I see what you Mean. Yeah. Is there, is there like a, a feel? I think the first, like the once in a while, I'll say early onions, but it's pretty much like a big three late in the game that, you know, you could tell sealed the deal. Yep. But I, I, I think the, the one that people have gotten the, the biggest kick out of is Ronald Moore at Sienna, where he made the, the three against Ohio State to go to overtime.


So that was just a, you know, plain hole on. And then he made, he made the three to win in overtime and that became the double order. Yeah. On the double. I love it. It it's great. I watched a three minute long video that was just a, it was a super cut of you saying onions after big shots. I just listened to you say the word for three minutes and it was probably the best three minutes of my month. It was fantastic. Boy, you need, you better get a life. My God. It's The best. It good to ASMR for guys. It's fantastic. Yeah, it does. It just goes in, in your, your sports brain. You just have these things that just rattle around. And we had Mike brine on last year and, you know, talking about the, you know, the, the, the beginning of yelling bang and double bangs and like, they're just as sports fans, this is how we could soon the games.


And when I think onions, it's like, must be March must be a big shot and rap's on the call. That's nice to hear. Of course. Mike's one of those special guys. I remember doing a game with him back when he was doing Mars basketball. Can you believe it? Okay. That's how far back. So what a career he's had, as you well know. Just a class act too. Yeah. Yeah. He is. He is. Do you have, do you have a favorite call that you've ever made? The favorite call is when they put the lights on about two in the morning, Get one more, It called the last call and they double order it, you know. Yeah. Probably eight a day.


That's pretty good, you know? Yeah. But not really. I, I I'm more of a reactionary or spur of the moment, you know, whatever fits. And I, I always say I didn't go to Harvard, so, you know, who knows what's gonna come outta there, you know? What about, what about a favorite player or a player that you can look back and like, I just loved calling his games because the way, the style of play or the moments that he stepped up to, I, you know, to the NBA Jason Kidd. Yeah. I always said that what he did in the Meadowlands, if that was the garden, they'd have a statue in front of MMSG for him, you know, every night he did as astounding things.


Just, you know, just incredible feel for the game, you know, over the years, you know, doing the nets. And then CBS had the NBA years ago, as you guys well know. So you got to do a lot of NBA games and what they could do on a consistent basis, you know, just, you know, magic, you know, Larry Bird, just tremendous, tremendous talents. You know, Julius, in the early days, the eighties, I mean, it was so nobody special, but just so many great players in so many great moments. And, you know, college, they live for a lifetime for these kids that a lot of them, they're great college players.


They don't get a chance to expose or shine on that next level. So it is, it is fun to see them have their moment in the sun. Yeah. Yeah. You, you referenced last call and the, the legends about you are, are fantastic. You, you like to go out, you like to have a good time. I think Jay Billis said that working with you is like going on a three day bender. That might just be more Jay Billis not being able to, a nerd to drink at all. Yeah, But I, I told this story recently. We were in Milwaukee and I, I, it was an in, it was the football championship Monday College, And we had a Monday, big Monday, and Danny Gabit, who's runs the NCA basically now basketball tournament, and Dave's son, who's just a super guy too, but he and I got to the table late, so we had like six or eight of us, and Jay was in the throes of needing glasses, but not, not using them.


So when I walked into the MO'S restaurant, the owner, who's a good, the Aala brothers great guys, I gave the one boy Jamie, my credit card. And so we sat down and, you know, we watched the ball game. The Jay ordered the wine and the check came. Then I went behind to look at it and he claims I almost had a heart attack because he added zeroes and numbers in front of the zeroes. He thought what was one 50 was four 50. Like, anyhow, it sort of destroyed my evening somewhat. But other than that setback, we had a lot of fun nights with McDonough and he over the years, but, you know, Jay's, Jay's a good friend, great spokesman, really for the game that, you know, you, you don't have to agree with him and you don't argue with him because he is too smart to argue with, but he just has a great feel for what he thinks should be the right thing in the game.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it, it seems, it seems like you're a lot of fun to hang out with. I've read all the stories about you, you know, every restaurant owner, you know, all the, the best places to go out late at night, you know, great Italian restaurants, the, the whole nine yards. Do you have a secret to waking up in the morning and maybe have an 11 o'clock tip to Get up? I, I, I guess it's called responsibility. You know, if you wanna play at night, you gotta manage the morning, you know, you got something else to do. But I always say I've lost my game a little, but it's still ahead of a lot of people, you know? Yeah. What are you, are you still hitting last call? Are you still making it all the way to last call? Oh, no, Not, not quite. Not quite.


Not that I've become more responsible, I guess it's just that maybe lacking a little more stamina or just, you know, worried about the next event or getting to the next event. But no, I, I've been really lucky with Gene Good Genes, let's put it that way, you Know? Yeah, yeah. We saw the story went viral last week of, of Eye and Eagle saying that you once came out of a bar after last call with eight beers in your trench coat for everyone. Can you confirm that? I hope it was more like, you know, he got it wrong. It was a dozen beers. It, it, it wasn't eight. It wasn't eight, but there was a couple, you know, it, I, I can remember one night, I think it was the San Antonio, San Antonio net championship series, unfortunately, I think it was for zip as it was with the Lakers too.


But Jay Wright came up And we went into the, the, they had a little after hour, not after, after game place at the Meadowlands. And they closed quickly. You know, a lot of those guys are, you know, other jobs and have to get up early. So anyhow, everybody was really upset, reluctant to leave. And I had the guy go outside and put a, about eight beers behind a bush right by the door. So anyhow, we went outside and they said, well, goodnight. I said, well, we got a little night cap. And I said, the guy threw us out. I said, Jake over the bush and grab a couple of beers, you Know?


That's fantastic. Yeah. And I, I mean, I I, I read a profile about you that you, you know, you would, your move sometimes would be just go to a bar, and then you'd have, you'd buy, you know, 20 beers, have 'em out on the table. If someone came and said hello to you, they have to have a beer with you. That's, I mean, that's a, that's a legendary move. Oh, I don't know about that. U usually they were part of the group, I think, more than anything, you know? Yeah, yeah. But it is, it makes for good fodder, basically. But, you know, you try and always be under control, but it's good company. The one guy that's incredible, you know, over the years, a lot of places closed in all these towns. Whenever I go to any city and I don't know where to go, I call PJ Carmo.


Oh. And PJ knows the owner. He knows the mare d he knows the hostess, he knows everybody. And so he's a great source. If you guys are traveling, give PJ a call. We'll get you. It is, it is utterly incredible. But between the NBA and his college career, he's been all over. Yeah. What, how many restaurants do you think you have a picture of you up in? Not as many as Sinatra. I know that. But you're up there. I feel like I know. I've seen a few of Them. I know I'm about to have a great meal. If I Bill Raftery Yeah, you RAs bin here, then we, then it's gonna be good. Yeah.

And now here's more. Bill Raftery.


If you had to pick one of your, maybe do your top three, it could be any city. Wow. Top three places that you go to when you're on the road. Well, you know, for years it was PJ Clark's in New York. If you were in the city, they were always great to us post-game, you know, stay open and it, it, it's still good. Obviously MO'S would be Tescano and, and Brentwood. What's the other one I like there, the ponies right by UCLA is a good one. Mo mostly Italian. You know, the Ivy and Santa Monica. I'm being West Coast a little because two of our kids are there And we've been going there a lot more lately.


But pretty much you get direction from the coach or, you know, somebody in the athletic department recommends a place and you end up enjoying it on a consistent basis. Yeah. Yeah. It's good for team build. Good for hanging out with the boys. Yeah. Like La Par, LA Pearl down in Washington. I like a lot. It's, it's not a puppy, it's a, you know, fine dining place. But that's one too we go to when we're in town there. And S T's Grill is another one. I don't know if you guys know that one. That's a good one too. Yeah. You got any places in Chicago? That's where we're at right now. Chicago. I, I just told this story recently, years ago, we were at Harry Carey's, right.


And it was closing time. We had all the nets, radio and tv. So we have about eight guys. We, producer, director, et cetera. And it's Harry Care behind the bar with Ernie Banks. There's no, it's closing time. There's nobody there. And I said, Harry, would you sing? Take me out to the ball game. And he looked at Ernie Banks and the two of them sang it. That was like one of the highlights for me of a lifetime. To have those two famous and delightful guys singer of that song was pretty good. That's Incredible. That, that's a great, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I wish I could have gotten to hang out with Harry Terry Gibson. Gibson is another one. Yep. When we went there consistently that we like to go to.


Yeah. That's that's another great one. Good picks. Yeah. I, this is gonna be weird for me to ask you. Do you have anywhere in the country that has Bill Raftery Day? Have you been, have you, is there any towns or anything that have like Bill Raftery? I don't even, I don't even have a Bill Raftery Day in my own house. Okay. All right. That's fair. That's fair. Are you okay, because I found an old tweet of mine, it was from April 3rd, 2021. I said, we don't appreciate rry enough. Someone sent a calendar reminder for August 17th to respect Rry more. So are you okay if as a podcast, our show, if we make August 17th, the official Bill Raftery day on part of my take, are you okay with that?


That, is there any financial commitment on my part on this or no? Oh, wait, do you have to pay us? No, no. You don't have to pay Us. Yeah, we're gonna need need to float. We're gonna need a whole meal. Yeah. So you will have to pay a little bit. But yeah. Are you okay with us making it? Maybe you'll come back on the show August 17th, Bill Raftery day. That's a deal. Okay. All right. So that's official. Pardon? I don't think we've ever had a count a holiday on this Show. I don't think that we have either, but yeah. We'll, we'll have maybe a couple glasses of wine. Yeah. Tell some stories. Yeah. See, maybe go, maybe get, maybe we'll get a metal detector, see how many beers we can get through a metal detector. That would be fun. That would be very fun. Yeah. Yeah. So I wanna ask just a little bit about your past, because I, from my understanding, you got started on ESPN when ESPN was not, you know, nearly what it is right now.


It was kind of a smaller network and you took a chance by going there. What was that like deciding that you wanted to get into media, into broadcasting as opposed to coaching? My, we had started the Big East for two years, and I had said to Dave Gavitt, who was doing the color analysis and as a commissioner too, I said, you know, Dave, someday I might like to do that. Never thinking I'm gonna leave. And I, I thought I was gonna be John Wooden, but I guess, you know, if you look up my record, I didn't quite achieve that. But the, the, I guess I wanna say October 28th of 81 we're in practice two weeks.


And Dave called, and I made, I made this up, but it's pretty typical of what may have happened. Dave called me, said, look, I've watched you coach, I think you should try television. So I, I, I had two days to decide. I met with the team and I left for nine games, $800 a game with four children. Wow. So it was 7,200 bucks and it just went from there. ESBN was great. They gave me 25 games. NBC gave me three or four games at a little larger number. And I went with a bank for almost 20 years, believe it or not.


I didn't hold the bank up, but they let me go any place I wanted to. We were basically the bank of the Giants, the Jets, the Meadowlands, the casinos were big then in Atlantic City. So we were involved there with the roadways, the highway authorities, all that stuff. So we were basically salesman. And that gave me the opportunity. The next year I started with the Nets full time. I started with CBS for the first time in 82, 83. And, you know, that, that was sort of the way, you know, I did that for some 20 odd odd years with the Nets ESPN until two 13 I left to go when Fox started their Fs one Big East coverage.


So I've been really lucky. I mean, you know, not only, you know, career-wise, but this amazing people most of considerably younger. And I think that's the big thing too. You know, you guys are young, young people have juice. And I think it just, it is invigorating for a lot of people. I mean, we get together pre-game, you know, the night before. These kids are all smart. They love what they're doing, you know, they're great team players. So I think all that sort of carries you and keeps you going. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think a lot of guys, when they work in broadcasting as they get older, a lot of guys kind of form, I don't know if it's, they're upset with the changes that happen to the game with the way that things are set up or, or what it is, but they develop kind of like a bitterness to it.


You seem to enjoy watching college basketball more than you ever have. Would you say that's probably because you're around younger people? Or is that just who you are? I Think that's, I, I, I think that's a lot to do with it. And also I, I don't get hung up. They make the rules, so why bitch about them? Yeah. Yeah. You know, the game starts. You may not like a jump ball, you know, a change of possession hour. You may not like the, but you know what, people at home could care less. I mean, they, they wanna, and the other thing too, I, you know, the referees, everybody has their angst over them. And, and I think you have to say things at times, but basically sitting at home, you don't want to hear about every call lamenting this or that, but key calls Yes.


I, I understand that part of it, but I, I, I just think the whole, you know, you, you, you come into a town and the thing is so important for two teams, two communities, And we as a group of TV or radio have to match that. Yeah. I think that's, that's sort of the key. Like that thing is as important to you as it is to both those universities Yeah. And those kids. Yeah. It, it is, it's true. You, you make sports fun. And I think that when we tune in, we want to be, it's entertainment at the end of the day. That's a lot of what our show is, is like, you know, we know that we can't take ourselves too seriously. Sports is supposed to be fun and you do a great job of making it fun.


Yeah. That's nice of you. I just feel very fortunate, really. It's, it's been a nice little ride, as they say. I think it keeps you young, keeps you invigorated. And, you know, the challenge of, of staying on top of it is not, not much of a challenge really. I shouldn't even use that word. But, you know, the, the biggest challenge is getting there. I always say, and you have to be ready when you get there and the coaches button it up or the pre-game practices button it up for you. Yeah. One of the things that you do that I love the most is you, you let the viewers know right off the bat if they're playing man to man, right off the bat. There's no question about, have you ever screwed up a man to man call?


Where you say man to man. Well, behi, you know, am I playing a two three sound? We, the that actually started and I had no idea I was doing it. It was to get out of the play Byplay Man's way and, you know, so I would do it quickly, never thinking I was connecting, you know, the three words. Yeah. And over the years I'd be like, I remember being at Newark Airport and this guy is like a couple of feet away. And I hear him go, wait a minute. And I'm going, geez, what a knit with this guy. And he says it a couple of times, I had no idea I was putting the three words together, but it was more to get out of the play-by-play guy.


Then he identifies who, you know, who's who and, and whatever. So I think everything starts for, you know, just maybe you form a habit, but it just starts because it's convenient or it fits, or you want to be as succinct as possible. I, I do love whenever they come out and zone and you give them the two three zone with man to man principles. Yeah. That was behi. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you had to throw 'em off. Yeah. You can't steal that from me. That, yeah. That was Jimmy. Unbelievable when you think of it and what he did too for a career. Yeah. Who, what, What he loved to tease him. It's, but he's amazing. It, it just, his relaxed way.


They just showed up and played and beat people and he kept getting great players. Yeah. What, what coach throughout the years have you become closest with or is like, you know, they're genuinely a friend now. I I, you know, I I I would say a lot of guys, you know really well and you're really comfortable with, but you, you know, it's not like you're going to dime with them in the spring and summer. Right. But, you know, it's, it's surprising how close you can get and how open they can be about their other areas of life. You know, whether it's a Bob Knight telling you something or you know, John Thompson telling you something that, you know, you would never use on the air.


But you know, you're, you're comfortable making a phone call and checking in on 'em, you know, how they're doing when they retire. And I got, you know, we've competed against John pre Big East and all through the Big East, and I knew him, but the almost 10 years of doing the NCA tournament with 'em, we, you know, we had so much time together. It was probably the best time I ever spent with a coach. Yeah. We really, we, we hit on things that you would never even think of discussing as a, you know, a coach TV person or a radio person, but it was just natural flow of a conversation.


Yeah. Yeah. Which teams are you most excited to call in the NCAA tournament, the ones you've watched this year that you, you're very, very excited to see where they go. You, you mean this particular season or over the Years, like this, this year, what are you looking at? Well, You know, I'm curious to see how Duke manages with all these young people. I, I know, I know they're talented. It's just that, you know, grant was talking about it this morning. It's just a different ball of wax. You know, maybe the first game, war two will be one thing, but how they react. I, I'm curious to see if the SEC can get three teams in the final four, which would be match the, you know, the big East in 85.


Those are, those are a couple of the things I, I, I think the biggest thing is how kids become stars. Dante di Vincenzo comes to mind a few years back. He was really a good player and what he did in that tournament escalated, I should escalate, elevated him to be in a draft pick. And obviously now he's a terrific NBA player. I know he was nicked up recently, but you know, he had a good run in New York and now Minnesota. Yeah. But that's, that's the excitement though, I think where all of a sudden, you know, Dalton Connect is another one that the world got to see after his play at Tennessee course now he's with the Lakers.


Yeah, Yeah. The, our our our producers of big Villanova fan. And he said, he texted us when you came out, he just said, Chris Jenkins, how about those onions is forever ringing in his head. So, I mean, that had to have been a thrill. I mean, yeah, having a buzzer beater to win a national title is an all time moment. The the big smooth, you know, the interesting thing about that play, that that is a play they had practiced and it really never got the claim that it should have. Where Archie Diano drove at the guy on the right wing and Chris, And we couldn't hear it, but he went Arch, arch and then this, I call it a slap back.


You know, it's just a pass backwards. But the slap back and the presence of mind to know, you could knock it down the confidence to take it, obviously. But, you know, those, those are, those make your day. I mean, as a, as a fan, you know, it's Keith Smarts jumper down in New Orleans, you know, I was on that angle. I thought he was behind the backboard when he took that jumper in the corner. And yet as the years went on, I saw it in a perfect line, and then his momentum carried him behind the backboard. But those are special moments that, you know, they, they sort of live forever. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have one that you, that you want back, one that you think about keeps you up at night?


Probably coaching wise more than anything, you know, where you, you know, you had a game one and you gave it away kind of a deal, you know, but let me hold it on one second. That was my daughter called in. But not really. I, I think, you know, maybe some regrets you, maybe some info you thought would've really resonated and you, you didn't get it in, or by the time you thought about it, it was too late. Yeah. You know, you, the play had moved on, kind of, but I, I think I've been, you know, fortunate to work with some of the greatest play by play guys in the world. And, you know, they've all taught me something and I, I think Vern taught me a lot about timing, Vern Lundquist, like, without having a conversation, you know, like I, I always felt like if I have some information that I think would fit at a commercial, I might say something to Verne and he would say, not yet.


Let's save that. Yeah. You know, like his sense of timing was just, in fact, we had, this is a digressing for a moment. We have a Louisville game and I think Butler, it doesn't matter, but I Louisville's upset in this game, the NCA game, and the ball went to the left and we're looking that way. And out of the right I saw an object flying out of the stands, and it ends up being a flask, but a, a plastic flask. So it slid across the floor and it was almost like God ordained it, it came to my feet, you know, so I I, we go to commercial, I said, burn, did you ever see that?


What, what he talking about? And I pick up the flask and I hand it to him, he opens it up, smells it, and he goes, maker's Mark, put back on. So We, we sent it, I forget the name, I should know to the head then of the committee for the NCAA and thanks for the heavy security during the NCA tournament. He really protected our butts, you know? Yeah. Anyhow, that's digressing a little bit. I I got a weird question. Do you remember the first time you were out to maybe breakfast with Jim N and he pulled out a picture of the toast that he keeps in his wallet?


No, but that, you know, I don't know the, the, how it started, but it was like, I I, it was like a joke from Jim that got legs. Yeah. So, wait, does he have it, does he have the picture or no? No. No. Oh, wow. He never showed me. Okay. I'm not saying he didn't have it. Yeah. 'cause the legend goes that he has a picture of, of, of, to the, the way he wants toast toasted in his wallet, and he'll pull it out and he's actually said it. So he might just be getting a prank on everyone that he pulls it. I think he pulls it out and shows the, the waiter waitress being like, this is what I want My money would be on.


It became a joke, I think. Okay, you gotta ask him. I'm in his arena with this. But he is, he's got a great sense of humor and he'll go with the flow kinda, you know? Yeah. Because he, he, he told the story on Dan Patrick. So I like he just Become getting everyone, it's become part of the Jim Nance legend that and given away the tie. Yeah. Have you, do you ever, do you ever consult with him about the tie when you're, when he's, when he was about to give away the tie? Yeah. No, but we, we, we be, we were the beneficiary of ties every tournament from Mitchell's in Westport. Jim had them sent to us every year.


So I, and Eagle doesn't send me squat, but used to step up and get us those nice little ties. I Love it. Do you ever get upset with Grant Hill? Because he is such a Duke homer, you're like, chill out grant, You know, do you feel that way on the air? I, we've done Duke games, you know, no question about his loyalty, but doing the Duke games, I think he goes sideways to try and, you know, just be as even toned as he can. He actually does, I, I don't mind Grant Hill, I, I like Grant Hill a lot. In fact, he, he does a good job playing it straight down the middle. But no matter what happens, there's always gonna be somebody that thinks that you, they hate your team except for you.


Maybe, I don't know. Do people, do you ever get people that come up to you and you're like, Hey, why do you hate Cal so much? Right. Yeah. I, I, you know, people, well, generally speaking, if they dislike the guys, it means their team beat them on a regular basis, I think. Right. Or they got beat in a recruiting deal, or sometimes it's just personality that they don't care for. But you know, they, they, you know, they're fans so they get upset when things don't go their way frequently. But, you know, it is funny to walk out of a building and the people will say, great job. You know, you go, they were at the game, they didn't hear you, but they're team won, so you did a great job.


Yeah, It's true. That's a very good point. But Everybody, everybody means, well, I mean, it's, you know, wide open world out there that, that's made the college game special. Yeah. So on, on Sunday, you're gonna be watching just like everybody else, I guess, right? Or do you get, do you get the bracket before it comes out? No, we, we, we'll probably be in the air. We'll find out. I'm sure like with the iPad or something, we'll pick up something, but we, they let the schools know or, or you, the public and the schools. And then that night they decide where we're going. Yeah. You know, they have a meeting between Turner and CBS, all the execs.


Is there anything that, that you're rooting for? Like any specific like region you'd like to do Over the years? It's like, you can't go wrong. You're going to get one or two teams that are going to get to the semis or quarter, you know, lead aid or, so it's like wherever they send you, it's gonna, you do the same thing at every town you go to. Yeah. You know, it's, you're in the gym for eight teams. You know, you have a, a meeting after to get ready for the next day, have a couple of pops, get up the next day and do the games and come back, sort of chat a little bit, have a couple of more pops and get ready for the next day. Kinda, you know.


Yeah. Yeah. Alright, so I have one last question. This has been so much fun. We really appreciate you joining us. We're, we're, like I said, we're huge, huge fans.

So we are on the eve of the tournament. Do you have a team that you, you've watched and you're like, this team's gonna win at all? I know, I know you're not in the predictions business, but do you have a team? You're like, that that team has everything. You know, I don't know if they have everything, but the obvious chalk I would say would be Duke, Auburn, Alabama. A team that intrigues me is Florida. Yeah. Very good. They intrigue me because they got size, speed shooters, guys. Golden's a hell of a coach. He did a great job at San Francisco. They're one BYU intrigues me.


Oh Yeah. They're good. Yeah. Out of the blue. I, I do think that Houston might be ready. And the reason I say that, they actually have some guys shooting the ball decently. And I think that's big. 'cause you know, they're gonna show up and guard you and beach on the glass and they, they get extra attempts too. Possessions, which, you know, is overlooked frequently, but they're, they're phenomenal that way. But those are a couple. Yeah. And I, They've been throughout, but I, I have a very important question for you because it's been one that I've been, I've been thinking about for, I don't know, 15 years. You're the perfect guy to answer it. Why? Why do we call it call hoops? But we call it NBA basketball.


Oh really? I never even noticed that. Yeah. It's always college hoops, which I love. I love saying college hoops. Right. Oh, never thought of it. Now you will. Now you will. Now you, yeah. You'll have to get to the bottom of that for me. Yeah, I will. That's an intriguing inquiry. Yeah. Thank you. I didn't mind searching for facts. Yeah. Maybe it's an answer that we're not meant to know. Yeah. Yeah. They're keeping it from us. Well, raft, thank you so much. And we look well, Thank you guys. Yeah. I appreciate It. Yeah, we look forward to August 17th. It's, it's gonna be Bill Raftery day. On on. Pardon My Take. No parade. No parade. Just, you know, a nice little get together. Yeah, Yeah, yeah.

Alright, let's wrap up. We got Fyre Fest Of The Week. Henry? Yeah. Oh, oh, you're, You're your Mic's off. Your mic's off. Memes is Sabotaging you. Oh no. Memes doesn't want you to have your mic on. Yeah. Yeah. Now You're bad. That was bad. Producing by oldie there. Oldie. You gotta, you gotta do a better job of getting Hank's mic on, Dude. You gotta get him on line one right away. Yeah. You guys get him on line seven Memes. Change that up. Wait, wait. Memes has him listed on line seven. Oh yeah. I don't even know what this is. We only Have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I'm a first Liner. We only have six microphones. I guess there's a technically another one that would be right there. Wow. Only knows more about our show than how to produce our show than we do. Line seven. Hank Line Seven.


That's Disrespectful. That's not gonna happen again, Hank going forward. Okay, there we go. That's how we fix it. Appreciate It. Yeah, no problem brother. All, let's Kick you. Line seven. No, no Big fire fest this week. It's a great week. The weather's. The weather's turning golf season's approaching. Like, I like walking outside and, and just feeling like, you know, it's golf weather. That happened a couple times this week. March Madness this weekend. Nothing better. I did have, this was, this is just gross. And I, I wish I had something else to use my fire fest, but I'll just say this one. 'cause it's really the only thing that happened this week that was negative. But I, I woke up yesterday, went to the gym in my building, sweaty, came down, dropped Deuce, and then went to Flush, wasn't working.


And then I saw an email from my building. Oh. Like the water was shut down for, to like six o'clock at night. So just hung out there all day. So I just had to like, dry off the sweat, come into work and then come home like eight hours later. Wait, what happened with the, the Deuce? I flush it like last night. Oh. Oh no. And just marinated. It was disgusting. I wish, I really didn't want to even have to say this 'cause it's gross. And that's it. That was my fire. It was disgusting. The, it was Disgusting. The water being shut off. That's such a, And I wanted to shower so bad. I was, was Like, oh. Because I remember like in my old apartment in Brooklyn, they would shut off the water, I don't know, like twice a year. And when they did it, it would be like, how is this possible?


How can you shut this water? I'd go buy a bunch of water and like, gotta get ready. It's like, yeah, there, there's no water for four hours. Dude, you can handle this. It Was literally, and it, it, it, it was 10 0 5. And I'm like, what happened? I see. I open up my email and I was like, from 10 to six I was like, if I was just 20 minutes earlier, I was fine. Did you try to turn on the shower. Yeah. Yeah. And you get the, the air coming out. That's what you get for working out. Yeah. Never again. It's funny 'cause like right after you take a shit, your shit's funny. And it looks like, I know there's a bunch of group chats that people have. They take a picture, look at this gross shit I just took and they sent it that same shit. If you wait eight hours, you're horrified by your own poop. Yeah. Ugh. That's gross. It was gross.


That's really gross. It's gross. There's no, I really, like I said, I didn't even wanna mention it, but That's really gross. It, It was gross. Hank, that's really, really gross. But Hank, you know what I got, I think I got this yesterday. Might even be Tuesday. The first email from a golf course. Mm. Saying it's that time of year. We're opening up this weekend. Yep. No carts though. You can go out there and walk. But we will have the course available for play on Friday. That's amazing. Yeah. I think next week, hopefully if the weather's nice, we'll be the first round. Get back out there. What are we shooting this summer? Gimme some goals. Break 85. That's my goal by Win. Whoa. By when? By July. You, you know, you could just by filling out the card however you want it to.


It's true. I'll break 85 first Round. Thanks a man of honor. I'll, I'll shoot 80. I guarantee I shoot 84 first round out this year. We'll see. When do you think, when do you think your first round will be? Whenever you guys make me do a video. I'm sure that will come soon. I'm sure you'll be like, Hey, we got this awesome sponsor. And I was thinking maybe we play golf and I'll say, I'll say, alright fine. These aren't Hank's idea though. I Do have fun when I go out. I just don't have time to go out. It's not Hank's idea that he gets forced into playing golf for work. Literally. I'm pushing to get Hank into the creator classic. This Yeah. This year that, By the way, shout out Trent. Shout out Trent. Trent out. Trent put out, it was a performance for the ages.


He had the, the best moments of anybody that golfed yesterday. The shot that he took on that hill where it looked like his ankle snapped in half. And then he just created a new bunker and his ball came to rest in that bunker. It was, it was so funny. So relatable. And then his performance on 17 was, it was real life tin cup. It Was, if you're gonna be in that creator classic. And what was the prize? I don't even know if there was, you got Trophy. Trophy. Okay. So like, if you can't win, you know how the old, the Ricky Bobby, if you're not first you're last. That's, listen in that type of setting, if you're not first be really, really last because everyone will remember it. And he had the most memorable performance.


And it's literally the creator classic. Yeah. It was incredible. So he created the best content And the fact that there, it's the day before a real golf tournament, which is happening and there's a non-zero chance that that massive divot that he put in the ground Yeah. Might come into play is like one of the greatest storylines going. It was, it's a new bunker that he made on that hole. And yeah, it's, it's, I'd say likely that somebody will find themselves in or around that divot that he took. Yeah. Can I, that was huge. That was huge. That's a huge divot. Like, I mean you could almost, if you brought in a tree or you could put a new shrub in there. Yeah. Hole was put. Hit right in. But what was the full, full total distance? Like, you know the science facts when they show like the ball, the, the ball tracker, the Tracy thing.


Yeah. Like how many would that be like point? I think he went, he go backwards. I think it was negative. It was negative. Had to have been negative. He lost, I think the ball went backwards. Did He lost? And then it's another stroke. So it just keeps adding up and adding. And how many, I'd like to also see the total distance on every shot that he took on 17. Like how far he, it's 130 yard hole. I think he probably hit like 700 yards worth of shots on that hole. Yeah. It was great. But it was, it was so, I was so happy for him when, when it landed, he said he only had two balls left. The, the guy Grant Horvat, he's not a professional golfer. No. His name is a professional golfer. You're Thinking there's a guy named Horvath. Isn't that Oh Yeah. Billy Horvath or something.


Bill Billy Horschel. Maybe Billy Horschel. But yeah, I thought the same thing for a little bit When I saw it, I was just like, wait a second, how's this guy in this? He's just, he should be a professional golfer. That's a professional golfer's name. I agree. A great golfer Like Grant Horvat. If you see Grant Horvat, he's, you know, 12th in the FedEx Cup standings. I'd be like, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's like the biggest YouTube golfer. Great. He was really good. But I just, I couldn't believe that. And he looks like a professional golfer. He should be a professional golfer. Yeah. I dunno if his game's there, but he checks those drum trending upwards. I mean the look in the name professional golfer. Yeah. Shout out Kyle Berkshire. Sorry that I wasn't on his bag. He asked me to be on his bag. I accepted to be on his bag in the video, but things come up and part of my take.


And we had interviews and stuff this week, so I couldn't make it down there. It would've been fun though. PI, that could have been me. That could have been me on his bag too. Oh yeah. I'll send you next time I a hundred, 1469%. I would go. Yeah, I know. He, he Loved you. You didn't, you started that number. You didn't know where it was going. I Oh no, it ended though. It finally ended because it would've been worse. 'cause if it didn't end, it would be like.zero zero one and six and sevens and stuff. Yeah. Well we'll be on Hank's back next year. No, no, no. There's something brewing. Yes. This is a problem. PFDI don't think you were here for this conversation. Max for some reason is like pushing for him to be in the creator Classic. And I said, well then he has to practice a ton.


And Max was like, but that would be great. He could practice more. Ma. I think Hank paid off Max. I was watching Tre. I Think Max is gonna take ask for like a vacation or something In Yeah. There's something wrong. Something is up. Wind fingers. Granted. Yeah. Wrong. You just saying Hank, I want you to golf more. Either that or he is trying to push you out. No, Yeah. Wrong. Something wrong wrong. Something might, I like what he's saying. But I also am a little Wary of, I was watching Trent struggle thinking how awesome it would be if I was watching Hank's struggle Max. Because Hank would've would've taken it so much worse. Yeah. And so much more upset that like that's, that's my porn is when Hank is playing poorly in golf and I can just look at his face. Why couldn't, why couldn't we get you in the creator classic.


I know we're not a golf. That's what I'm channel. What? We're not a golf Channel but we're the number one sports podcast. We can't be like, Hey this guy should be in it. I doubt it. I bet you we can PT should do it next year. Next year. We're getting Hank in also. Also I'm now putting it all together. Max wants your seat because now he has oldie. Who knows. Who knows. The one through sevens on the Mic. Produce. This was yesterday. Oldie can produce. It Sounds like you're scared. Yeah. The thing is time moves. I really quickly. Yeah, time does move quickly. Quickly. So you're Scared Hank? Definitely. Yeah, He did. He was scared. Sip to drink there. It was like a nervous sip. Why is, what does time moving quickly have to do with it? Well all of a sudden he's seventh line and he shouldn't be the seventh line.


That's true. You know what I mean? That's right. And matter of fact, the last time I was here, wasn't he on holidays? Well, as well. He was not. I was on, I was on holiday. I was on holiday. How much time is this guy gonna get? Like I didn't ask For more time. I just wanted, sorry. I wanted to see Hank fail in front of millions of people. But Hank was here. I was with Hank and you weren't here. True. I'm Talking about Trump. That's True. That's a good Point. They can't, don't let him put, don't let them put us against each other. I think it's already No, no, no, no, no. We're too big. We're on the same side here. We're too big. We're On the same. Yeah, we are. We're too big growth. You don't wanna roll with us? Two B two. Cut Him out. Cut him out. Yeah, cut him out. I'll keep an eye on this guy. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Keep Your hands above also. I love that. One of the biggest storylines in, in the players this weekend is that they moved a tree.


Yeah. It's so cool. Big tree. There was a, an iconic tree that blocked a tee shot on I think 11. And the tree went away. 'cause they had to, it was dying. And they found a perfect tree to take its place. Picked it up and moved the tree into the tree box. And now everybody's super proud of the tree there. Yeah. Check, like check. You seen the tree yet? Check tree yet? My Fyre Fest Of The Week. There's a couple. One is actually not my fire fest, but I think it's a fire fest for all guys in general. Okay. And this comes to us from a, a good friend coworker Hubs. And hubs tweeted this out last night. Did you see this saying? No, I didn't. I Did. He said my fiance just asked me with a straight face. When was the first time I dunked. She just assumed throughout our entire relationship I've been dunking was stunned beyond belief.


When I said done, my friend group can do it. I wonder how fast she thinks I can throw a baseball hubs is probably about my height. And he's bringing to light the, the fact that a lot of women just think that all men can dunk. Yeah. And so it's like, when did you first dunk? Like when did you first learn how to ride a bike? And this is, this is bad for guys, This is bad. This is, I'll tell you what, it's even worse when you, when you have kids. 'cause it doubles where like my, my son has asked me like, did you play with hi? Like he'll meet a hockey player or NBA player and be like, did you play with him? Yeah. I'm like, no, I did not. I didn't play, I did not Play with him. I did not play professional Sports. That's not, that's not what, yeah. I remember when I first took him to a Blackhawks game last year and he got to meet Wayne Gretzky and then he, I told him he was the best hockey player of all time.


He has the most goals soon to be Ovy. He asked me, he's like, how many goals did you score in the NHL? Yeah. Ki kids assume that like every adult guy is either a former professional athlete, maybe a former firefighter. Firefighter, maybe Police officer, Big time firefighter, maybe an astronaut. Yeah. And you're like, no, I, I sit behind a mic and fart. I'm a podcaster. But yeah. So I, dude I didn't know this until hubs tweeted out and then a lot of people replied saying, yeah, I asked my girlfriend or wife. And a lot of women just think guys, all guys can dunk. Yeah. That's bad. That's Very bad Hank. It seems, yeah. It seems easier than it is. Confirm. It does seem easier than it is, doesn't it? Yeah. You were basically a chick a year ago.


Yeah. I'll be able to talk. Well, how Would you answer that question? When, when, when was the last time you could dunk? Would you say? I I almost dunked once. I'm, I'm probably I'd say coming up soon. Soon. I haven't peaked yet. Yeah. Yeah. I would just say like last time I, when was the last time I played 2K like four years ago? I dunked. You just have a trampoline in my backyard. I dunk on Yeah. Little basketballs hoops all the time. Yeah. And then the other fire fest is actually Fire Fest. Fire Fest two. It's happening. Oh yeah, it's happening. And hell yes. Isla Mu Harris, Mexico allegedly. It's happening. I think it's May 30th. And they've got all these package. I was looking on the website. There's one you can buy a ticket for a million dollars.


They have a million dollar package that you can purchase. They haven't announced who's playing. So before I spent the million dollars on the ticket, I hit up Billy McFarland, the guy that runs Fest. I was like, Hey, what does the lineup look like? And he told me he wanted to announce DMX but they wouldn't let him yet. DMX died like, oh four years ago. He was joking. Got it. That was a joke. Got it. That was a joke from McFarland. Got. Got it. But he did say, 'cause I said either I or somebody at Barsol should go to Fire Fest two. And he said that he will give us a ticket. Okay. If we want to go May 30th. I don't, I don't You don't want to go to fire, you don't wanna go to Mexico. It would be cool. Why Wouldn't we send oldie as correspondent?


Yeah. Oldie is our correspondent. Oh man. That you go the side pouches out on the beach. You wanna go to Fire Fest two? Oh man. Oh absolutely. Well, if it's two, that means he's already, one was already rocking and rolling then. So it's gotta be Yeah, That's exactly what happened with one. They're Running it Back. I mean, I know that a lot of people, we Might have to send him as our international correspondent because you are international. Yeah. If I, if I can get you a ticket, would you go, would you go, You can't deny the ticket. That's like you, like My only concern with sending oldie is like he would make it fun and I think people would be like, that was an awesome time. 'cause there was this Canadian dude that was making everyone, you know, go balls to the wall. Yeah. So there's also, there have been a couple denials from the local authorities.


Ah, some people saying that it's not happening. I'm choosing to believe Billy until Does does like, what is, what has Billy done to make me doubt him? Does He still have the dude that will suck Dick for water? He should be there. Yeah. That's a guy that you want on your team. All time Guy. Imagine That giving the guy all the water and then you still gotta give him a, like a heavy gagger That's fucked Up. He thought like, okay, cool. This guy's water, this guy, they're gonna be fine. Now he is like, no, go, go, go, go. You're like what? Yeah, that's exactly how it go. So Yeah. We'll, we'll try to get, if this happens, I do want oldie to go. That would be fun. Wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What I'm looking at the accommodations right now. Part of it, it says the luxury room, which I believe is the million dollar room will contain a minimum of one bed.
