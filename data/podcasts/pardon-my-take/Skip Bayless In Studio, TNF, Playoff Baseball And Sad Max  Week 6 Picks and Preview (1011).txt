They have won the must win game in Seattle. Let's start with the 49 ERs. Brock Purdy's. Just good We.

3 (3m 4s):
Brock Purdy has also never lost the Seahawks. That's, I believe he's now five And. Oh, against Seattle. That's

0 (3m 10s):
A great stat.

3 (3m 10s):
Seattle turned into like little mini San Francisco tonight. A lot of red in the stands. Yeah. 49 ERs. Jerseys. And And. There were 2 49 ERs. Wives That were in the front

0 (3m 20s):
Row. Yeah. Kyle Ek, And, Kyle EK's wife, And. George Kettle's wife, And, They. Were able to, We had a double Kittle. And. A EK touchdown.

3 (3m 29s):
Yeah. We had double kittle. And And They. Both did the Lambo leap into their wives arms. It was awesome. And. Then Usk scored the fullback touchdown at the very end, which was awesome to see. And. Then He goes up. He does another leap to his kind of a simp move. Jumping twice for your wife.

0 (3m 44s):
Love It guy. Loves his

3 (3m 45s):
Wife. Jumps into her arms. And. Then He He gave her a kiss through his face Mask. Love That too, too. Which I've never seen before. That's

0 (3m 51s):
Like getting in a fight with a helmet. On throwing a punch at someone with a face mask. Yeah. Same as kissing.

3 (3m 56s):
Do you think anyone, do you think you've ever done It with the, with a helmet? On It. We. An NFL player. Yes.

0 (4m 1s):
And. Yeah. An NFL player. Yes.

3 (4m 3s):
While wearing their helmet. Let's

0 (4m 4s):
Respect, let's respect our friends. Yeah. Yeah. NFL Player, one of Yeah, for sure. Wearing the helmet. for sure. for sure. Absolutely. But And, Antonio

3 (4m 12s):
Brown. for

0 (4m 13s):
Sure. for sure. for sure. for sure. Probably still to this day. Yeah. Brock Purdy's just good.

3 (4m 18s):
Yeah. He is He.

0 (4m 19s):
He. He. He has wheels. He is moving around. He's throwing guys open. Yeah, he's

3 (4m 23s):
Good. I just hope That Kyle doesn't start doing the thing where it's just all Brock Purdy all the time. We

0 (4m 28s):
They. They They had, 'cause Jordan Mason obviously got hurt tonight. He was having a hell of a game. And. Yeah. I mean, the Fort Nine ERs are good. I, I wasn't worried about the Fort Nine ERs. I am worried about the Seahawks. I think their defense has problems. And, it's got injuries, but it's also got problems. And, it feels like three weeks in a row. We've just watched the same Seahawks game where they're down. And. Gino is trying desperately to get them back in at That Pick. He threw That basically ended the game. That was tough. And. Yeah. It's just the Seahawks are just in this spot. Every, like, if you just turn On the fourth quarter of a Seahawks game, they're down anywhere between five And, And, 12 points. And.

0 (5m 8s):
Gino is desperately trying to get the ball down the field. Yeah.

3 (5m 10s):
I think when We said That, there was a statement loss. That They had to the Lion On Monday Night Football. I think the statement was just like, I think We should quit. On the season. Yeah. And. It's because They, they've, they've looked like a completely different team the last couple weeks.

0 (5m 22s):
Yeah. And again. They do have a bunch of injuries. I do love those uniforms though. Whenever They put On these uniforms, And like, man, the Seahawks. Yeah. This is so much fun. That's a uniform. They should keep. Yeah. They should just wear That all the time. Even changing the logo. I love when teams change the logo. I thought the best part in the middle of the field.

3 (5m 39s):
The, the throwback was awesome. I loved the, the old school Seahawks logo, but the old school Seahawks font Yeah. Is awesome too. It's like 1980s. Yeah. You see That font. And. You're like, I am in the eighties. That's Steve Largen out there. Yeah.

0 (5m 50s):
So as much hand wringing as there was about the 49 ERs start They are On, top of the NFC West,

3 (5m 58s):
And, And, And. Maybe getting Christian back.

0 (6m 0s):
And, maybe getting Christian back. So what was the vague report? Let's go to our, the big matchup next. Week against the Chiefs. The 49 ERs. That's got bet fun. What, what are the walls say?

4 (6m 10s):
I don't know what the walls are saying. The walls say That after Week Six. We'll probably know. But On the broadcast. They said That. They talked to Kyle And. They. Were hoping, you know, three Or, four weeks maybe, but they're not sure.

3 (6m 24s):
And. That's what the walls, the

4 (6m 25s):
Walls talked to Kyle And with an injury like That with the calf. And. He. He said They went out with a calf injury. Week 17 last Week. You Can, you know, figure out the calf. And, Achilles are close. You just never know with That. Yeah. So It was a very vague updated report of like, they're hoping for four to five weeks, but anything could happen. Anything

3 (6m 41s):
Could happen. Wait, I'm confused. Even retirement. Did the walls talk to Shanahan? Or? Did the walls talk to

0 (6m 47s):
A different source?

3 (6m 47s):
A different person? It's

4 (6m 48s):
The original walls. The walls haven't, haven't changed anything from the original reporting. Correct.

3 (6m 55s):
Was this walls in Tiana And Square?

0 (6m 58s):
No.

3 (6m 58s):
During the protest, no. Okay. All right.

0 (7m 2s):
The 49 ERs ran the ball fucking down their throat. I know. That, it's a little inflated from That last run by Gudo. But 6.9 yards per carry. 228 yards is that's, that's, that's bully ball.

3 (7m 15s):
Yeah. It is, yeah.

0 (7m 16s):
And. Jordan Mason was got, I mean, Jordan Mason was On pace. He had nine carries for 73 yards.

3 (7m 21s):
And. The Niners. He's got a lot of weird injuries. Again, tonight though, They had Jordan Mason with a shoulder. George Kiddo

0 (7m 26s):
With

3 (7m 26s):
API. He shot It up at, at halftime. Tried to play, played one play. I believe And was like, Nope, I shouldn't bet playing football with whatever It is. I have And. Then. What was Kittle?

0 (7m 35s):
A pee.

3 (7m 36s):
Yeah. Oh, He had to pee. Yeah. Yeah. To just piss your pants. Yeah.

0 (7m 39s):
Come

3 (7m 39s):
On George.

0 (7m 40s):
Yeah. Deebo. Yeah. With the stinger.

3 (7m 41s):
Deebo With the stinger. Shaking his hand out. And. Then And They

0 (7m 43s):
Lost some offensive lineman. And

3 (7m 44s):
They also lost another kicker. And. They kicker is the backup kicker.

0 (7m 49s):
Oh, That was the kicker. Not, yeah. That was the kicker. Not the punter. Yeah.

3 (7m 51s):
Yeah. The kicker at the end. So now they're They got go find another kicker again. Kick

0 (7m 56s):
Janowski back out

3 (7m 56s):
There. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Get. Get the big pole lock.

0 (7m 59s):
He could fucking kick.

3 (7m 60s):
Yeah.

0 (8m 1s):
He was, He was the He was the original. I Can kicker from anywhere. Guy

3 (8m 5s):
Get Get. Doug Flutie doing some drop kicks out there.

0 (8m 8s):
What? I'm trying to think who, which team has a good kicker that's not playing We. I guess those kind of don't go together, but like what would the, would the, if the Cowboys lose, does Cowboys start losing Or? They trade? Aubrey for like a third rounder.

3 (8m 22s):
Dicker.

0 (8m 22s):
Dicker. The kicker

3 (8m 24s):
Could dicker up there. Get

0 (8m 25s):
Ticker. The kicker That was enough. Football talk We got more football talk coming up with NFL Week six Pick six And preview. Let's talk some playoff baseball. You know what? Let's talk about the other series. First. The Yankees Advance. So We have, maybe We were the problem with New York City Boys because Monday is shaping up to bet an all time City Day in New York City. You got the Mets at four o'clock, you have the Yankees at seven o'clock And. Then you have the Jets playing the bills. Both New York City teams, kind of New York State And. Then New Jersey playing at eight 15. It's the center of the world. Yeah.

3 (9m 4s):
Finally, finally,

0 (9m 5s):
E espn. Finally, Stephen A. Smith. Can. Can say who he's rooting for. Yeah.

3 (9m 9s):
It's got bet fun. I guess if you're a New Yorker for everybody else, we're got bet like, okay, enough New York. Yeah.

0 (9m 15s):
But It hasn't happened in a while.

3 (9m 16s):
It hasn't happened in a while. The Liberty, they're not playing right. On Monday, I, I

0 (9m 20s):
Don't know if they're playing On Monday also, I, We We talked about pins stripes. I think John Carlo gets his pins stripes for this series alone. He basically staved off the Royals. And was like, Nope, it's not got end now. Because He was, He was awesome. The last two games in Kansas City, And We also had the rare, the rare, oh, Liberty. When is That game three? We Sunday. Sunday. We had the rare benches clearing conversation. That was cool.

3 (9m 51s):
Oh, I didn't see That part.

0 (9m 52s):
Yeah, They had, They had a benches clearing conversation. I like That. I I like They. Just They just talked.

3 (9m 57s):
I Did anybody come outta the dugouts?

0 (9m 59s):
Yes.

3 (9m 59s):
Okay. Did They sprint outta the dugouts?

0 (10m 1s):
I, It was kind of like a, you mean to say

3 (10m 3s):
Bullpen? Yeah. I meant to say bullpen. I don't think benches.

0 (10m 6s):
I don't think the bullpen. I think It was the dugouts. So It was benches clearing conversation. It was a, It was a bang, bang. Play It second base. And. Then They just They were like, Hey, that's wrong. And. Then another guy came out, And said, hold On. Wait a second. You don't say That to my teammate. You're wrong. And. Then They all just stood around. And basically were just, just

3 (10m 25s):
Talked

0 (10m 26s):
It out. It's Max put off to It was very funny. I like the benches clearing conversation. Just everyone had to get in. On the conversation. I've

3 (10m 33s):
Been watched a lot of old school, like eighties baseball clips recently. Yeah. It was a different sport at second base back

0 (10m 37s):
Then. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, It wasn't even, It wasn't even like a a, a dangerous play. Or, anything. It was just kind of like, Hey guys, let's all come out. And have a conversation real quick.

3 (10m 48s):
Yeah. I think That guy even said, my bad And the other guy's like, it's okay.

0 (10m 51s):
Yeah. The bullpen came out. Oh, the

3 (10m 53s):
Bullpen. Yeah. I love, I love It when the bullpen catchers Get up And sprint out onto the field. And. But

0 (10m 57s):
They just sprinted to have more of a conversation.

3 (10m 59s):
Yeah. Then They sprint onto the field than They stand at the back of the big crowd. There

0 (11m 2s):
Wasn't even really a shove thrown like It was. Sometimes you'll Get like chest to chest looking like our friend Jimmy Tetro when They have the fights in real bros. Yeah. We didn't even really Get That just a nice little conversation.

3 (11m 15s):
Like somebody said the F word. Yeah. And. Now it's like, okay, We all have to come out here. And say the F word And.

0 (11m 19s):
Then the other two series We have game five for both, which I'm very excited for Padres. Hugh Darvish going to back to la. That's got bet a great game. Do We know who's starting for the Dodgers yet? It was not up earlier when I checked. I'll check again. It was not up And then. I am. I know. College football Saturday is a loaded, loaded slate. And. It's got bet. Great. I'm so excited for Scobel to pitch game five.

3 (11m 47s):
Yeah, that's got bet. Great. But that's,

0 (11m 49s):
That's

3 (11m 49s):
His moment with the Padres game. I like the new wrinkle that's been added to It because We talked about about Ken Rosenthal's column. Yeah. Where He called. Let's see, what'd He say? He was a, a dancing strutting peacock when He was talking about Fernando Tati. Yep. And. Then He said That jerks. And Pro Far is the kid. That pulls the fire alarm. Yep. And then acts like it's a joke again. That kid's. Awesome. And. Then the Padres were like We. Guess what? Ken Rosenthal we're not got do weird bow tie interviews during the games with you anymore. Love That. So we've got a, a big J versus MMLB team Beef going On right now. I love That. I'm also just excited to see the Padres go back to la. Yeah. And piss everybody off.

0 (12m 23s):
Yeah. And. It's We also have It. It happens to every October. People being like, why are They, why are They drinking champagne after winning one series? I love the celebrations. I always are And for the celebrations. You need to drink after every single series. Yeah.

3 (12m 37s):
I'm, I'm, as a general rule

0 (12m 38s):
Play 162 games. General

3 (12m 39s):
Rule of thumb. If you're allowed to get drunk at work, you should Get drunk at work. Yeah.

0 (12m 44s):
It's fun. So two game fives. So excited to see Scobel pitch. 'cause that's just like everything I expect And know from Schobel. He's got, he's got, he's got fucking bet a Hoss. He's got bet a gimme the ball for the whole whole game. But that's got bet. Great. Nothing bet than a couple game fives. We also had the Phillies And, the series end. Max is back. Max. Max. Do you have something for us?

5 (13m 21s):
Philly's lost the game. They looked like shit. It's exact same thing. That went On from 2009 to 2011 of the Phillies And. Then They had 10 years of nothingness. So It looks like it's got bet a lot of the

0 (13m 34s):
Same. But That team won a World series.

5 (13m 36s):
I said 2009 to 2011.

0 (13m 38s):
I know, but, but That

5 (13m 39s):
They won a World Series in 2008.

0 (13m 41s):
I know, but That team, I'm saying That team had won a World series.

5 (13m 45s):
I said 2009. 2009. They went to the They, went to the World Series

3 (13m 48s):
2009. Team did not win a

0 (13m 50s):
World Series. Big I'm saying That team had won a World series. The guys On That team from 2009 to 2011 had won a World series.

5 (13m 57s):
Correct. But 2009 They went to the World Series, lost 2010 They went to the NLCS, lost 2011, They went to the NL Ds lost.

0 (14m 5s):
Right. And. But you see what I'm saying?

5 (14m 7s):
And. But what I am saying, yes. It is the same thing.

0 (14m 9s):
Like They had They had a, like the 2009 And 2011 stretch. Like They had done something. They'd earned something.

5 (14m 16s):
Yeah. In 2008, They They had earned under something. Yeah. But

0 (14m 20s):
That carries over.

5 (14m 21s):
But that's not what I'm saying. I'm what I'm saying is That, like It is just a downhill spiral. Got

0 (14m 26s):
It guys are getting but with no World Series. Correct.

3 (14m 29s):
Yeah. And will make this even worse is the fact That at That First World Series, you thought to yourself like, this team is built to win a World Series at some point. And

5 (14m 36s):
And. Then the other weird part about It is 2011 was supposed to bet the best team of them all. And. Then They had the best record. This is the best record of, of this little stretch. It's the same thing. The guys are getting older.

0 (14m 47s):
And, you didn't win a World series.

5 (14m 48s):
Didn't win a World Series. So many people just didn't show up. It's the same thing as last year is like one game. They can't carry over momentum from one game to the next. Yeah.

0 (15m 0s):
You got screwed.

5 (15m 1s):
The bullpen is insane. The bullpen was had like was a top five bullpen. And baseball this year. All of a sudden We Get to the postseason. And They. Pretend like They don't know how to pitch. JT Real Mutual doesn't have a single hit in the entire postseason. Trey Turner hits 200 Kyle Schwarber after his First home run. He gets one bloop single other than That. Nothing.

0 (15m 24s):
What did you say? Bottom

5 (15m 26s):
Real

0 (15m 26s):
Baseball. What did you was real baseball say? What did you say after He hit That Home Run

5 (15m 30s):
Y You know what? I don't give a fuck. I don't take It back at all.

0 (15m 34s):
I love That.

5 (15m 35s):
You shouldn't like every if like, if you're scared to, to

0 (15m 38s):
Agreed

5 (15m 39s):
Bet. To bet excited over a First, over a lead off Homer against the fucking Mets. Yes. I was the only person in That room. Yes. I was outnumbered And. I tried And. I tried to call my shot And. I missed. I don't give a fuck

0 (15m 51s):
Max. Yes. I'm 100% On your side. There's nothing worse than what's happened in this culture these days of the old takes exposed in the middle of a game. 'cause you're rooting for a team. Or rooting for a game. And commenting in the middle of a game. That's just what fans do. They root for their team. You shouldn't have to apologize for It.

5 (16m 13s):
Yeah. No, I don't. I don't

0 (16m 14s):
Did It, did It go poorly after That? Yeah. Yeah. But That shouldn't bet an apology.

5 (16m 19s):
Yeah. And. it was wor like in the moment. It was like, holy shit. Lead off batter bomb We have our Ace On the Mound

0 (16m 26s):
We. We're not the brewers Mentally tough mentally.

5 (16m 29s):
And And also Brewers fans being like, oh, We We fought them. You did the same fucking thing That We did. You're like, because I kept saying like, we're we're not the brewers. And, And, They were like, yeah, you, you're not the Brewers We at least gave them a, a harder fight. Like, what the fuck does That mean? You lost. We lost.

0 (16m 43s):
Also, you know what you say to Brewers fans? We at least won a World Series in 2008.

5 (16m 48s):
Facts. Yeah. And We would've beat the shit out of

0 (16m 50s):
The Brewers. Yeah, you would've. Yeah. There you go. That's the worst part.

5 (16m 53s):
And The Mets are too fucking good. The Mets are really fucking good.

0 (16m 56s):
They're a team of destiny.

5 (16m 57s):
And. I And. I've said It. And. I'll say It again. Oh man. The only thing That I'm rooting for in this baseball season is Mets Yankees And the Yankees to beat the absolute fuck out of the Mets. Because that's the only way That Mets fans will bet upset at the end. At the end of this run. Would

0 (17m 13s):
You rather a sweep Or a loss in game seven? Want sweep?

5 (17m 16s):
I want sweep. You want sweep? I want them to bet like reminded That one

0 (17m 19s):
Game seven

5 (17m 20s):
Maximum, maximum pain. No, because then they'll bet They Can build off of That

0 (17m 25s):
Bet. It bet Yankees sweep mets. Those probably crazy odds. On

5 (17m 29s):
Cap Gates. Becausecause then, then It won. What Yankees fans should bet upset That. This is what I want to happen. Because

0 (17m 35s):
It won't, you don't, won't happen. You don't. Get That. That's a good point. You don't Get the things you want to happen to happen.

3 (17m 40s):
And Max, you had a tweet yesterday, last night after It was over, you said, I may have to quit this company. I keep the Vikings. I can't have worse losses. On Stream. And. Then They just keep happening. Yeah. So

5 (17m 52s):
The like, the Mets factor of It was like,

0 (17m 54s):
They're just And. They just Get. Every clutch hit.

3 (17m 57s):
But you're not, you're not quitting

5 (17m 58s):
And. Oh my God. If That,

0 (18m 0s):
Oh yeah, that's what I said.

5 (18m 2s):
Foul. Oh my God. Fans. If That foul ball happened, I had every Mets fan. You Can see the strike zone in today's baseball watching experience. They show you where the strike zone is. They still complain about pitches. That are outside of That Strike zone being called Balls. I was fighting with That them the entire Week And. I was like, they're, it's outside of the zone. You Can. See the zone Mets fans suck. You guys fucking suck.

0 (18m 30s):
Alright, so you just turned to memes when you said That, you did block memes. On Twitter last

5 (18m 34s):
Night. He was doing too many memes. And. I was in a bad spot last night.

0 (18m 37s):
Last night. That Fair. That's fair.

5 (18m 39s):
I was in a bad spot. I was looking at too many memes. I That

3 (18m 42s):
I appreciate the fact That, you blocked him. Not because He was tweeting at you. Not because He was tagging you. It's too, too many meme. You just didn't want to see his memes. On the timeline.

0 (18m 49s):
I'm, I'm with you On. All of this Max, by

5 (18m 51s):
The way. I unblocked. I unblocked him in the morning. Did I just la last night I was It. It's good. We're talking about this now. Last night I was in a very bad spot.

0 (18m 60s):
Not having to talk. Yes. Getting a little bit of time is good. And you, you in That moment. It's the worst. You, you I, I I was like, yes, you should block him. He's mem too much. He was doing a lot of memes.

3 (19m 13s):
Wait, memes. Did you follow him back after He unblocked you? Because when you blocked someone, you don't follow them anymore.

6 (19m 20s):
I don't think so, but I'll go do It right now.

3 (19m 23s):
It's nice. See, this

5 (19m 24s):

6 (26m 17s):
This makes all the shitty years of watching Worth It. This type of run. Yeah. It It happened in 2015. It's kind of happening now. Just every time you take their route, They just something special happens.

0 (26m 29s):
I know people don't want, like, it's hard from a national perspective to root for the Mets Or bet. Like, oh, I'm happy for the Mets. I am happy for the Mets. Mets fans are tortured. Oh no, he'd take It off again. Yeah,

5 (26m 48s):
Continue. Okay.

0 (26m 49s):
They are, they're tortured. They're a tortured fan base. So It It is, it's fun to see them have this run. And it It seems like there's just something about playoff baseball. They have just every big hit. Every big out.

3 (27m 1s):
They got some magic going.

0 (27m 2s):
On. Something's going On. Yeah.

3 (27m 3s):
There's definitely some magic going. On. Grima.

0 (27m 4s):

3 (27m 6s):
Grimace And. Also shout out to all the fans. That show up to baseball games wearing the full On Grimace outfits. Yeah, I know they're the knockoff grimace outfits.

But they're doing It. They've got Grimace. They've got, they've got the song Memes. How's That song go?

6 (27m 27s):

6 (27m 41s):
Yeah. And. Jorge Lopez happened this year when He threw his glove into the stand. And said, I'm On the worst team in the league. Yep. And, They, They were 22, And 35 at That Point. And then turned the season around at That point.

3 (27m 53s):
It's it's And Hawk to And Hawk. This is kind of crazy 'cause like Steve Cohen the owner. This team isn't really, does He have his fingerprints all over? It? Or is It. Kinda like just magic in a bottle. Where It got the team got forced into this weird set of circumstances where this is your starting item now. And, They all kind of caught fire at the same time.

6 (28m 13s):
I will say They all caught fire at the same time. 'cause there's a lot of expiring contracts. On the team. It was kind of glued together. Yeah. Then half of our salary is down in Texas with the Rangers.

0 (28m 27s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That

3 (28m 28s):
Was, That was the end the sense. Okay. Yeah. That was

0 (28m 30s):
The end sense.

0 (30m 23s):
Okay, boys. Week six of the NFL. We're ready to go. I feel good. We have a, a good, a good even slate of the early game. Obviously. Bears, Jaguars, And. We're going then We have six I believe. Then four. Then

3 (30m 41s):
One We also have a good slate of buys this weekend. I like It when it's very evenly split between good teams. And bad teams. And the bye Week. So this Week, we've got the Chiefs On a buy Rams On. A buy Dolphins On. A buy And. the Vikings On a buy. Mm. The Rams won the bi Week. Yeah. They're the bi Week winners

0 (30m 58s):
Chiefs. I mean the

3 (30m 58s):
Ch We, they're On never We.

0 (30m 60s):
Just keep forgetting That. The

3 (31m 0s):
Chiefs never count out. Patrick Mahomes.

0 (31m 2s):
Jeff. Five And. Oh, And just rolling. Yeah.

3 (31m 4s):
If, if the Royals somehow do some work during the bi Week, then I will say That the That. Patrick Mahomes And. The Chiefs have won the bye Week. Yeah. But yeah, the Rams need this Buy getting healthy.

0 (31m 13s):
Yes. They did. Big time. Alright, so let's Get into some dates.

3 (31m 15s):
We need to buy from the Dolphins too.

0 (31m 17s):
Yeah, absolutely. That would bet. Fine if They just didn't come

3 (31m 19s):
Back. Yeah. From the buy. How long would It take you to notice?

0 (31m 23s):
It would bet at least a Week.

3 (31m 24s):
If I think I could go a Week. I think maybe when Tua comes back, when

0 (31m 28s):
There are certain teams, That go On the buy And. I forget That. They exist. That happen with the Titans. And, the Chargers. This Week.

3 (31m 34s):
You have to remember the Titans.

0 (31m 35s):
The Titans. You got remember the Titans. But yeah, if the Dolphins didn't play Next Week either. I don't think I would fully realize. It for another Week. Yeah, And. Then I'd bet like, oh shit. Because they're just, it's not even like a, you can't even make the fantasy argument because all those guys stink now without Tua. Yeah.

3 (31m 50s):
So this is, I think this is good. Goodbye Week.

0 (31m 52s):
Yeah, goodbye Week. Okay, let's Get It going Jaguars at Bears in London. The Jaguars. Hopefully everyone's okay from Hurricane Milton. Have some. I think They were delayed by a little bit. So They usually go Thursday. Bears went On Monday. I think the Jaguars are ended up going On, Or are got go later. On Thursday. This is a must win for the Bears,

3 (32m 14s):
I would say. So, yeah. You got, this is, this is the meat of your schedule, right? This

0 (32m 18s):
Is the, this is the, you got make some hay time.

3 (32m 21s):
You got dive into That meat right now.

0 (32m 23s):
I do think the Bears defense will give Trevor Lawrence some issues. I also, I don't know if you guys agree with this, but there's something about like, there's teams when the urgency, when they're, when They haven't won a football game, the urgency gets really high. They win the game. Doug Peterson said, It himself. There's a weight off our shoulders. Now. I'm in. Yeah, I think to go against you, Doug

3 (32m 45s):
Peterson is, he's like black And white when It comes to lying. And telling the truth. Yeah. I think anything That Doug Peterson says before a game, That Week is a lie. Everything That He says after the game is usually the truth.

0 (32m 59s):
Yes,

3 (32m 59s):
Yes. And. So this Week, he's, except

0 (33m 2s):
For again the good conversations.

3 (33m 4s):
Good conversations, And both

0 (33m 6s):
Before And after games.

3 (33m 7s):
He said We. Maybe It was a good conversation. The fact That They had a conversation. Yeah. And. No, that's true. And. It's important to communicate with people. That's

0 (33m 13s):
True. And.

3 (33m 13s):
So this Week, I think he's lying about Tank Bigsby. Okay. Because Tank Bigsby has outperformed at TN at running back And. They're asking him, We, are you got give more Carries? He's like, no, He just had a good game. Like that's how this league works. You don't just give a guy more carries because They had a good game. That actually is usually how football works. Yeah. If you're Hot plays We, then you give him more Carries. So I, I have a feeling That He is lying about That.

0 (33m 37s):
I am a little nervous about Tank Bigsby. And Etsy N because if you, there's One thing, the Bears Defense. It could Get a little bet. On his his run defense at times. But I must win Caleb's. Look. Bet And. it must win. Can't lose the Jaguars.

3 (33m 51s):
Can't lose It. Can't

0 (33m 52s):
Let the Jaguars win their game. Next Week, I have a staff for you. PFT from BET Labs. It's really good. Speaking of the like weight off your shoulders after a win, And, when you Get deeper into the season, you And, you're, you're Winless. So teams in Week, six Or later coming off their First straight up win of the season are 45 And. 82 straight up. So 35% in their next game. Okay. This is obviously a two point line. So yeah, They could cover And lose straight up. But It, there's something to bet said behind the feeling of, oh, We won one. We. Can have a sigh of relief. We're okay.

3 (34m 26s):
Also because a team That waits That long to get their First. One usually isn't That great of a team?

0 (34m 31s):
No, definitely not. Definitely not. So I And, I don't think the Jaguars are very good. And. I'll bet a very sad boy if the Bears lose this game. 'cause again, it's a must win.

3 (34m 39s):
It is a must win. You got, you have to stack your wins now. Yeah. So yeah, I remember the First game. That. That. I went to here in Chicago. You remember That? We went to the fairs. Jaguars game. And. it was rainy. It was shitty.

0 (34m 53s):
We did. You were in a you, you were in It was in a wheelchair. We did a broke my foot. We did a preview of the game. And a porta-potty.

3 (34m 59s):
I think We were vaping in the Porta-potty. Yep. A Hot box to Porta-potty with Uncle Chaps. That That might've been one of the worst NFL games ever to go to That. A pretty tough one. I would put That one right up there with That Jets. Broncos game. That We saw earlier this year. Yes.

0 (35m 12s):
This

4 (35m 13s):
Is, people will ask me like, oh, have you ever been to a game of Soldier And? I tell them That story. I'm like, yeah, t make me never want to go back.

3 (35m 18s):
And We had the worst seats, I think. Yeah, I think We intentionally made It the worst experience.

0 (35m 22s):
Did possible before. Yeah. We did. We tr We were doing That as like kind of a bit. But like It was too not good teams. And. Yeah. You were in a

3 (35m 29s):
Wheelchair. I was in a wheelchair at the time. Yeah. That was, That

0 (35m 31s):
Was because We had gone to the NLCS the night before. And, you walked And further broke, broke

3 (35m 36s):
Your foot. My but my foot. Foot got more broken. We And. Then They dug into It. And. They didn't discover a fracture once They did the surgery.

0 (35m 42s):
But It was pretty much broken.

3 (35m 43s):
It was pretty much broken. It was basically a broken foot. But yeah, I think I agree with the Big. Cat. This is a must win. Week for the Bears. And

0 (35m 49s):
Jaguars Z events is bad too.

3 (35m 51s):
Their offensive line didn't look bad. Last Week, Doug They looked good last. Week Week. In fact the Jaguars. Yeah. But I think

0 (35m 56s):
They have some guys. They

3 (35m 58s):
Got some guys And also. Trayvon Walker. The most forgotten number one overall pick of all time. He had a big Week lack last Week too. So their defensive line Can Get at It. But again, I like, I like the bears this weekend. I'm with you. On. That one. There was a little bit of an update to the Tom Brady acquisition story from the Bears. Okay, so the McCaskey family confirmed It. They're like, yeah, We were in the beginning stages of a conversation. Or We got It. We wanted to bet in the conversation for Tom Brady. But do you remember what the outcome of That of not getting Tom Brady was? You guys got Nick Foles. Yes. Also Jaguar's Legend. Yes. Nick

0 (36m 32s):
Foles. And. Andy. Dalton later. And. Yeah. Yeah. It all worked out. A lot of dominoes. It all worked out. It all worked out okay. Going to the regular slate. Cardinals at pa. By the way, just as an aside, I hate the having your team playing in the London game because not only is It like, 'cause the, usually the eight 30 game. I will, I'll watch On, my phone, half watch trying to spend some time with the family. Like I'm aware of what's going On, but I'm not like fully, fully glued in because I know That, it's a long Sunday. If I'm like, obviously this one I'm fully glued in And. This is a complete, like the risk of losing this game And then having to just sit there all day, all day.

0 (37m 15s):
It's similar to playing the First game. On Thursday of March. Madness. If you lose That, it's so disastrous. If you win It great day. It's, it's free, free football for the rest of the day. It's

3 (37m 24s):
A great day. Yeah.

0 (37m 25s):
But I don't like, I don't like having That. If

3 (37m 27s):
You lose It, you might also, people might just forget about That over the course of the day. Yeah. But It,

0 (37m 31s):
Oh yeah, you That It sticks in the back of your head. And, you're like, God dammit. How We lose That game. So you got win this game. You

3 (37m 35s):
Know, last Sunday, I think It was statistically the longest NFL day ever because the London game And. Yeah. It's a delay And then the, the rain delay at the night game. Yeah. So It was the longest day of NFL football we've ever had. Yeah.

0 (37m 45s):
Yeah. Okay. Cardinal's, And Packers. Cardinals off a win. Packers, they're good. Jordan Love is He fully healthy. Here's what I think will happen in this game. I think the Packers are got win. I think they're got win. Semi easy. And. I think it's got bet because Jordan Love has gotten healthier. And is got stop being in shotgun every single possession. Every single snap.

3 (38m 12s):
Okay. That makes

0 (38m 12s):
Sense as he's good at play. Action. And. I think that's the last step of the Packer's offense coming back. And They also you saw It, On Sunday They. Were getting the tight end involved. They're got run the ball. I just, I the, the Cardinals defense. They played great in the second half against the, the 49 ERs. But I just like a team. That comes off a huge, huge win. Has to travel. I'm got, I'm got go against That team.

3 (38m 34s):
Yeah. I think Jordan loves getting bet. He got bet over the course of the last game. Actually. He's

0 (38m 38s):
Been doing That in every game. Yeah. So He He did the First time First game. He came back. It was three bad quarters. One good quarter. This time It was two bad quarters. Two good quarters. So you'd assume just one bad quarter this time.

3 (38m 49s):
Yeah. So He They went down 14 to seven after That. Hilarious interception. Yep. That like slapstick, interception, And. Then He completed 12 of his next 13 passes. Yeah. Right

0 (38m 59s):
After That And Dobbs I believe is back. Which That was a weird story.

3 (39m 2s):
Yeah. So what's going On with Dobbs Dobbs? From my understanding, He skipped practice, which That fucking rocks in the NFL to just skip practice. Yeah. That's something straight outta high school where you're like, I don't feel like It Or. My buddies are got go smoke by the steps. So I'm just not got go to practice. It's like a very high school thing to just bet like, you know what? Fuck It. Yeah. Not

0 (39m 21s):
Going

3 (39m 21s):
Fuck today. I'm not got work.

0 (39m 22s):
I don't know what's going On because I It feels like there might bet something mental health. I don't know. Because They had to go check On him to make sure everything was okay. And then what? He got. He got suspended for one game. Yeah. And by the, by the team. So maybe he's back. And. Okay. I don't know And. Christian Watson. Possibly. I, I thought I saw a report.

3 (39m 43s):
I saw Christian Watson saying something good about Dobbs being,

0 (39m 45s):
No, I'm saying We.

3 (39m 46s):
We're glad to have him back.

0 (39m 47s):
Christian Watson might play. Oh yeah, He did. Christian Watson came to his defense. And Christian Washington returned to practice. Okay. So the Packers could bet getting a lot healthier. Bet. I think you're got Get barring the weather of Packers offensive explosion.

3 (40m 2s):
Again, I feel like you're the same way as I am about this type of stuff. But has there ever been a game That you've watched between two teams, And then That That game stays in your memory for so long. That It affects how you see all the other matchups between the teams.

0 (40m 14s):
You're talking about the shootout.

3 (40m 15s):
I'm talking about the shootout.

0 (40m 16s):
The shootout. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm

3 (40m 17s):
Expecting a lot of points in this game. Yeah. Because of That. Playoff Shootout was It. Kurt

0 (40m 20s):
Warner.

3 (40m 21s):
Kurt Warner against Rogers. And Rogers. Yep. Yeah. And That was one of the coolest games That I've ever watched. It was just points, points, points. Yeah. It

0 (40m 26s):
Was like 49, 48. Or something. I don't even

3 (40m 29s):
Know what the final score was. When I see these two uniforms On the field at the same time. I just, my, my brain goes back to That game. Yeah. And. I expect there to bet a lot of points. Wait,

0 (40m 38s):
Not That one. Wait was It 26 20. Why did I, oh, I think They played

3 (40m 42s):
It in the playoffs. Right? There's a playoff game between the Packers

0 (40m 46s):
And. Oh yeah. 51 45. Yeah. There It is there. It is 51 45. Yeah. That was the shootout game. That was the crazy game.

3 (40m 54s):
Yeah. So I see these colors On the field at the same time. I agree. And. I'm like, okay. It's got bet points factory. Yeah.

0 (40m 60s):
I'm trying to think if there's any others. That I Can. Think of off the top of my head. Oh, I guess Chief's Rams.

3 (41m 7s):
Yeah. From That Monday night. Yeah.

0 (41m 9s):
That one's a good one.

3 (41m 10s):
That was a great one. Chief's

0 (41m 11s):
Rams.

3 (41m 12s):
I mean Jags Titans. But I'm always right about That

0 (41m 14s):
One Bengals bills for a different reason.

3 (41m 17s):
Yep.

0 (41m 17s):
I just expect someone to need CPR It. It's in my head. It does for sure. Praise for DeMar. Yeah. That. That's just a fact. Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't, I didn't think about It, but you're right. You're right. Points.

3 (41m 31s):
And. And. It's not this weekend, but it's next. That Call of Duty comes out, right? Yeah. And Kyler. I mean credit to Kyler for doing a Call of Duty commercial for doing an advertising. got lean into It. You got Lean into It. Yeah. got

0 (41m 42s):
Lean into It. Okay, next up. Commanders at Ravens. PFT. Yes. This is a very big game. Yes. This is a measuring stick game.

3 (41m 54s):
I like That. I like measuring stick. I've seen people saying passing of the torch game. No,

0 (41m 58s):
I think it's a measuring.

3 (41m 59s):
Measuring stick. It. It's not

0 (41m 60s):
A It could bet a passing of the torch game in retrospect. But I think going into It like Yeah, It could bet We could look five years from now. And bet like That was a passing of the torch game. I think going into It, It has to bet Measuring.

3 (42m 12s):
Yeah. So passing people are talking about passing the torch. Is this the, the Week That. Lamar Jackson finally surpasses Jaden Daniels as the bet scrambling And passing quarterback. I think it's too early to say That. Okay. I like the measuring stick game. I'm still dealing with my PTSD, my post-traumatic Snyder disorder where I still feel like going into every single Week. This is the Week That It all falls apart. Yeah. I do think That, the Ravens offense is, it's the best in the league. Best. Yeah. It's the best in the league. Our defense, I don't, I don't think That what We saw for the last two weeks. Can bet expected to bet the, the defense That we're got see moving forward. But I don't think we're got bet as bad as We. Were in Week one. Yeah. And. I'll bet. Ha. I'll bet. Okay. With That. Like this is a game. This is a potential statement loss for the commanders this weekend.

3 (42m 54s):
It's

0 (42m 54s):
An interesting game because the commanders as great as Jayden Daniels has been And. He's been great. A lot of their offense working has been the run game being so effective. And the Ravens run defense is very, very good. So it's like this could bet a game where Jayn Daniel has to do a like a little more And. I think He will. I also think this is a good spot though. PFT. Yeah. Because you have Ravens off of Sunday night football. Big win against the Bills overtime. Yep. 77 snaps for the offense Last Week for the Ravens And. Then you Get 'em On a noon game. I don't know. I think it's a good spot.

3 (43m 29s):
Now if, if We win this game, I will say all the reckless things. That. I've been the Vikings about That. I have. I've somehow stopped myself from saying, absolutely I will bet the happiest boy That I've ever been in my entire life. Yeah. If We win this game, And. I think it's a possibility. I think We could win this game. Yeah. I, I don't think it's likely, but I think if the Ravens play a lot of his own defense, that's when Jayden has his games. When he's like 90% completion rate against man. He's a little bit less of That. But yeah, we'll see what the Ravens defense does. I had a dumb thought about this game. Okay. And. I texted our friend Chris Long because Chris played On the defensive line in the NFL for a long time.

3 (44m 11s):
He hasn't gotten back to me 'cause I just had the thought. And. I texted him. I was like, is this really dumb for me to say this Or? Not. Maybe you guys Can tell me our past rush is not good. Our defensive ends not great. Our defensive tackles very good for the commanders. Is It maybe sneaky a good thing? That our pass rush On. The end sucks against Lamar because you naturally keep contained because you're not good enough to get Downfield And And turn That corner. Mm.

0 (44m 37s):
I think you'd probably want bet guys

3 (44m 39s):
Though. No It might bet. Bet to have worse

0 (44m 41s):
Guys. I don't, yeah. I don't hate the thought. I don't hate the thought. This

3 (44m 44s):
Is like, this is like 3D check five D chest levels of rationalization. That. I have right now.

0 (44m 49s):
They're, they're so slow. They can't physically give up. Contain. Exactly. That's what Yeah. I hate That. Exactly

3 (44m 56s):
What I'm saying. I don't hate That. It's like if you have a really slow player On your hockey team, it's like We. He's too slow to ever bet off sides. Yeah.

0 (45m 2s):
Yeah. I don't hate That. We should mention, 'cause We have to mention Lamar Jackson is 21 And one straight up against the NFC. Yeah. Which is crazy. 11, And 11 against the spread. So don't bet. Afraid to take the, take the spread And the commanders in the spread. I think I will. But That should bet mentioned also. Fun fact. Couple fun facts for you in this game. Sunday's game will tie the record for most Heisman trophy winners. On the field at the same time.

3 (45m 31s):
So We got Jayden. Yep. Marcus Mariota. He might not bet. On the field though.

0 (45m 36s):
Yeah. We. He's On the sideline. He'd bet. On the sideline.

3 (45m 39s):
Lamar. Yep. Derrick Henry. Yep.

0 (45m 41s):
There It is four. Four. So the other time It happened was the Raiders And bills in 1998 had Tim Brown, Desmond Howard, Charles Woodson And. Doug Flutie. Wow. Yeah. Kind of cool.

3 (45m 52s):
And. I'd really like to draft Travis Hunter next year.

0 (45m 54s):
Yeah. Oh, Travis Hunter. He's playing this Week. And He should bet the Heisman. Another fun fact. Dean Pease is back. He is

3 (46m 3s):
Back. One of my favorite names in the NL ever. Dean. Dean pe.

0 (46m 6s):
Dean PE.

3 (46m 7s):
PEES. Dean PEs.

0 (46m 8s):
So he's a, he's a special assistant to, to defensive coordinator. Zach Orr for the Ravens. Dean PEs is back. Yep. Dean PEs

3 (46m 16s):
We don't know much in the name, but he's back in an advisory role.

0 (46m 20s):
Yeah. The guy, On defense is named Dean

3 (46m 23s):
Pece. His name literally translates to Dean Pease.

0 (46m 26s):
Dean Pease. Yeah. He looks like a football guy. He looks like a football lifer. He's from Ohio. Dean Pease. We

3 (46m 33s):
Credit to the Ravens 'cause their defense hasn't looked as good as They did with Mike McDonald.

0 (46m 37s):
I agreed. I do think Joe Buroughs playing. I We The Ravens Secondary has not been great. Yeah. The run defense's been great. I think Joe Burrow's been On That like he's been On fire. Yeah. Because They did look good against the bills. That's true. They did shut down the bills. That's

3 (46m 52s):
True. They also got off to a nice early, early lead against them. Yeah, yeah. Begin. Have you ever been addicted to watching hype videos?

0 (46m 59s):
All the time.

3 (47m 0s):
This is the First I've ever been addicted to It. Oh my God. I've been watching all the time. I've been watching all of them. I think that's how I learn about 90% of my new music catalog. Yeah. Is just via watching hype videos. Yeah. Oh my God. These hype videos. I am It's bet than porn. Yeah.

0 (47m 14s):
Hype videos are the best.

3 (47m 15s):
I also had another question about this, this game, this Week here for you. The report came out yesterday. That Jaden Daniels gets into the facility at 4:00 AM every morning. Is That too early? Too early?

0 (47m 27s):
I think every quarterback does this. No, that's too early. That's

3 (47m 30s):
Not,

5 (47m 30s):
That's not true. Every, every 4:00 AM team, there's, there is a, there is a story. That comes up that's like, this guy is the First one in He gets in so early. It. Like, I like this. You should bet getting in That early. I like if you, if That is your job.

3 (47m 43s):
I like Max doing 4:00 AM

0 (47m 45s):
4:00 AM Yes. Fine. Alright. Fun fact off That. So I don't know what time every quarterback gets in. It does feel like too early. 5:00 AM feels more appropriate. Did you know That, our coworker And, trying to bet college football expert Brandon Walker, who lives almost in Wisconsin. Do you know That He sometimes. Like this morning, got here at six 30 in the morning to beat the traffic.

3 (48m 8s):
Yeah. And. He just paces around. He just

0 (48m 9s):
Walks around the gym. I know He paces, but, but I like He is now so obsessed with traffic. That He wants to get in here. And 55 minutes flat That He leaves at five 30 in the morning.

3 (48m 20s):
I don't blame him. Crazy. I would think about doing That too, just to avoid traffic. 'cause there's always some asshole off And. He

0 (48m 25s):
Doesn't have to bet here till 10. There's always

3 (48m 26s):
Some asshole that's broken down. 10 On the Highway 10 And And jamming you up. True. True. That's like a That. I mean, he's an older guy. That is like a dad move.

0 (48m 35s):
I feel like He said He went to sleep at seven last night. So I guess That makes sense, but still that's, that's too early

3 (48m 42s):
Update. On, the El Camino That broke down traffic caused a massive tra traffic jam. It was not out of gas. Thank God. It was almost out of gas. Okay, so I'm not That big of an asshole. Okay.

0 (48m 53s):
By the way, this is the best start. Lamar Jackson is It got Get fixed.

3 (48m 57s):
Yeah, it's, it's in the process of getting fixed. It's getting fixed. And. It'll bet. Fine.

0 (48m 60s):
Do you wanna tell him how many, how many miles per gallon?

3 (49m 2s):
Yeah. So I did find out how many miles per gallon It gets. 'cause as They were checking It out. It did run out of gas as They. Were running It at the, at the garage. It gets actually somewhere between four And, five miles per gallon. That's

0 (49m 14s):
Pretty good. That's awesome. That's pretty damn good.

3 (49m 16s):
And your face. Greta Thornburg. That's how

0 (49m 18s):
Many gallon, how many gallon tank is It? 12?

3 (49m 20s):
No, I think it's like six 15 Or. 16. Okay. Yeah. So

0 (49m 26s):
Yeah, you Can drive for like a couple days. An hour. Yeah,

3 (49m 29s):
A few days. I'll not bet. Taking That. On the highway.

0 (49m 33s):
Okay. By the way, this is by, by like advanced metrics. Lamar Jackson, who has two MVPs. This is the best He has started a season Week one through five, which is pretty crazy.

3 (49m 44s):
Yeah, it's scary. It

0 (49m 46s):
Is scary because he's been, he's not fat. Insane. Okay. Colts of Titans. Forgot about the Titans. I love the Titans in this game.

3 (49m 54s):
You do Because Anthony Richards is coming back.

0 (49m 56s):
I don't know if an, if I love the Titans. If Joe Flaco plays. I love, love, love the Titans. If Anthony Richardson plays, I think the Titans are the snake bitten team of the year. And snake bitten mostly means will l us turnovers. But They are, they've been in every game, right? Yeah. Like They could, They should have beaten the Bears. They should have beaten the Jets. Who was their, who else did They play? They beat the Dolphins. What was their third, their other game. They

3 (50m 30s):
Play the Colts.

0 (50m 31s):
No. They haven't played the Colts yet. Packers. Packers. Okay. That was Malik Willis That was the First. Week Willis. This is Week the Colts. Yeah. Yeah. I I think Will Levi is got have a good game there. It is, that's my Hot take. I think Will Levi is not got turn the ball over. I think their defense is really good. They're off a by maybe fix some things. And. I also think the Colts defense is like, remember how last Week, I said the Colts defense were the Get, right. For Trevor Lawrence. I think they're just the Get, right? For everyone.

3 (50m 57s):
It could bet. That could bet. So do you think That will Levi, watching Mason Rudolph go in there? And run the offense somewhat competently. That lit a little fire under his ass. It's inspiration. It might bet a fire under the ass game for Will Levi? Yeah,

0 (51m 8s):
I just, I don't know. Maybe this one is way off, but I, I really, really like the Titans this game. I like teams And. Any team off a buy. I like, I don't know. It's just something about It. It's like, oh, They, they're off a buy. They got a little rest. They feel good. They worked. On some things.

3 (51m 22s):
I, I don't know what to think until I know who's starting this game for the Colts. Yeah. I can't, I can't go against

0 (51m 27s):
Flaco. So if it's Yeah, Flacco. Yeah. No, That. That. That's fair.

3 (51m 30s):
Flacco to me is an automatic over

0 (51m 32s):
Quarterback. But I, but the Titans defense is good. Yeah. That's the thing is like, I, I think they'll bet able to handle either, I would prefer It bet Anthony Richardson. I'd like my bet more. But yeah, that's, that's kind of where I'm at with this

3 (51m 44s):
Game. What's the line? On this game right now?

0 (51m 45s):
Two And a half. On. DraftKings is That, right? Hank. Hank. You bet our line expert got It Bet our line expert. What do you got? Three Colts plus three. Oh, it's gone to three. Okay. Minus one eighteens is That. Maybe Anthony Richardson being called The Starter. 'cause I think He would, I think, which would bet crazy. But I I think he's the only one who would bet named Starter And. That would go against

3 (52m 10s):
Him. That would go against him. Yeah. The line would, would not bet in their favor. Let

0 (52m 13s):
Me look up if Anthony Richardson is playing. I think again, they're stuck in That spot where I don't think anyone in the world thinks That Anthony Richardson right now is bet than Joe Flacco. But you have to play

3 (52m 23s):
It. What I saw is That. He is, he's been practicing more. He's been doing more in practice. This Week.

0 (52m 28s):
Oh, here's a, here's a headline. That. I'll read We. It's paywall. Nobody's lying about cults. It's qb. Anthony Richardson. But nobody's telling full truth.

3 (52m 39s):
Is That a lie?

0 (52m 41s):
I don't know. I can't read the whole thing.

3 (52m 43s):
Any court of law.

0 (52m 44s):
Yeah. Yeah.

3 (52m 45s):
We the whole truth. They make you say the whole truth. The whole truth. That sounds like It might bet a lie.

0 (52m 50s):
And Jonathan Taylor. I don't know if he's playing Or not. But yeah. I, I like the Titans in this game. I do, I do. It's probably stupid. You know what? This will bet my, this will bet my, I'm quitting the Titans if They lose this game. Bet I'm not, I'm not taking the Titans. It is my last, last line in the sand.

3 (53m 10s):
Yeah. I mean, off a buy off. A buy off a buy. If They can't, if They can't compete against the Colts off by, I think that's fair to abandon them. Yes. Do you, do you ever write teams off for the entire season? Yeah, I do. Sometimes

0 (53m 20s):
They'll still come back. Somehow

3 (53m 22s):
And, then I, then I feel bad because usually those teams, That. I write off They end, end up coming back. And winning. Yes.

0 (53m 26s):
Yes. Okay. Hank, you ready? Texans, And Patriots.

3 (53m 34s):
It's

0 (53m 34s):
Mayday. Hank, is there anything you'd like to address

4 (53m 38s):
In terms of No, I'm got

0 (53m 39s):
Your excitement for Drake. May

4 (53m 41s):
I am nervous for this game. I, I, I'm not got say I'm excited 'cause I just, I still, I've thought about It. I slept On It. You know, you guys told me. I should bet. Excited. I'm excited to see him in the, in the throwback jerseys. I'm just nervous. I'm not excited. I'm nervous.

0 (53m 56s):
Okay. Can, I make you a little feel a little bit bet.

4 (53m 59s):
Sure.

0 (53m 60s):
Nico Collins is out. Nico Collins is very important to the Texans offense. Okay. That. The, the Texans offense has felt at times like we're in trouble. Hit Nico Collins. I actually think in a weird way, this is got help the Texans going forward for the rest of the season because they're got have to learn how to play without Nico

3 (54m 17s):
Tank Tell. Yeah,

0 (54m 18s):
But He like They. They're got have to learn how to, how to survive without Nico. There was a mutiny Hank for Drake May

4 (54m 28s):
Was

0 (54m 28s):
There. The Mutiny worked. The the Patriots will have maximum effort in this game. 'cause you have to, you have to have maximum effort after a mutiny. If you say

4 (54m 38s):
How credible was his mutiny,

0 (54m 40s):
I saw with

4 (54m 41s):
One report, one headline. The word Mutiny And it, And That. Wasn't That legitimate? Do

0 (54m 45s):
You know this show? That's legitimate. That's his, that's his source. As It gets Hank. If you do a mutiny for a guy And, then you Get the guy to start. Everyone's got bet like, Hey, We got step up. 'cause We did a mutiny for It.

3 (54m 58s):
Yeah. It's your guy. That. You've installed.

5 (54m 60s):
I I just pulled up. I just looked up. Patriot's Mutiny. There's there's multitude of

0 (55m 4s):
Articles. Multitude of articles. Use the word

3 (55m 6s):
Muti. If you look at Patriot's. Mutiny.

0 (55m 8s):
Yeah. Jared,

5 (55m 9s):
May, may Response to Mutiny.

0 (55m 11s):
Yep.

5 (55m 12s):
Patriots, blah, blah, blah. We won't read That one.

3 (55m 14s):
We It sounds like it's about, it's all these articles are in response to That. One article That said there was a Mutiny

5 (55m 21s):
That. But they're all,

3 (55m 22s):
Yeah. Now they're talking about

5 (55m 23s):
Immunity. They're all talking about, yep, there's smoke, there's fire.

3 (55m 26s):
Good point. Good point, max.

0 (55m 28s):
But you want, you want, you want there to have been a Mutiny Hank, because now the Mutiny worked And. Now they're got play hard for 'em.

3 (55m 36s):
You got some skin in the game. In other words,

4 (55m 38s):
The reporter who said That He got a little carried away with locker room Mutiny comments. On Patriots podcast earlier today.

3 (55m 45s):
A little carried away.

0 (55m 46s):
A little, not all the way carried away.

3 (55m 48s):
A touch of Mutiny. Yeah. They. Dabbled in Mutiny.

4 (55m 50s):
I like, I

0 (55m 51s):
Don't You should bet rooting for the Mutiny though, because the mutiny, like I would understand. Who wants

4 (55m 56s):
Their team to bet. Have a mutiny We. Listen

0 (55m 57s):
To me. Listen

3 (55m 58s):
To me. You ever seen Captain Phillips? Yeah. They. They took over. That show. Look at me. I'm the, I'm the captain now. I'm

0 (56m 2s):
The captain. Now I'm, I'm

3 (56m 3s):
The captain. I'm the Drake. May,

0 (56m 4s):
I'm the captain Now Hank, you don't want a mutiny unless Mutiny works. If It was still in state of Mutiny, you'd bet like, fuck this. This is bad Mutiny. But It worked. They got the Mutiny done. The Mutiny ISS over

4 (56m 20s):
And. What's the end goal of this Mutiny again, Drake race. Keep going over this. It's fine. It's fine. It fine.

3 (56m 24s):
What do mean? What the end goal was? We need Drake ma to play because He gives us the best chance to win. He gives us, He gives me, as a hypothetical wide receiver, the best chance to get more stats.

0 (56m 34s):
Dude, think about It like we've talked about It before. Post ski, post shovel, post Or, like, you know, post ga, game winning, you know, drive tailgate beer post mutiny beers up there. Like the boys are pumped after a mutiny. That worked

3 (56m 50s):
A successful one.

0 (56m 51s):
Yeah. Not a mutiny. That's still going. On a mutiny That worked.

4 (56m 56s):
I'm pretty sure It was Devin McCordy. That said It. But when the news came out, He said, I wish We had let Houston wait till Sunday to figure this

0 (57m 2s):
Out. That would've probably been smart, but you also had a mutiny On your hand. So you kind of had to deal with It.

3 (57m 7s):
Now

4 (57m 7s):
When I would've been a lot more excited if It was like, Sunday, 1130 And. It's like Drake may starting. Yeah. Then I would've been fired up. You

3 (57m 13s):
Get the pop. Yeah, but it's bet the alternative is That. The mutiny doesn't work. It gets quelled. It gets put down.

0 (57m 19s):
We. That's way worse.

3 (57m 20s):
And. Then you're never drinking a beer again. Right? And. Then the season's over at That point, the locker room lost.

0 (57m 26s):
I do think Drake, I think the offensive line will bet, bet.

3 (57m 30s):
'cause Drake may, He, Can run

0 (57m 32s):
And He Can pass. Two things That Jacob ETT couldn't do, which are very important parts of playing quarterback.

3 (57m 38s):
I would say pros for Jacoby. Brissett. He's bet at getting hit. And. He's bet at getting tackled. And, getting back up again. Pros for Drake may at playing quarterback.

4 (57m 50s):
Who are you got? Bet On. On this game. The

0 (57m 51s):
Patriots plus seven. You have a one ch you have a one game chance to, to ride the Mutiny. You have to take It. I don't you.

4 (57m 60s):
It's minus six And a half right now. You

0 (58m 2s):
Don't. IIII wanna do a mutiny On him now. So He Can. See how fucking great It is? I have

4 (58m 10s):
It's minus six And a half plus

0 (58m 12s):
Meme Max. You guys got do a mutiny? On On Hank. Just show him what it's like against Hank. Yeah. Yeah. Mutiny is That memes already.

4 (58m 18s):
Yeah. Memes has a man, memes has like a 25 page manifest. Right?

0 (58m 22s):
And picking up And. And. Okay. So That is a perfect example into these terms. Memes is actively trying to mutiny you. Right? He hasn't been successful. What is He a grumpy guy? If He was, if He muti, you He would bet happy.

4 (58m 36s):
That's a bad example. That's

0 (58m 38s):
Not a bad example. When you're actively in a mutiny, you can't bet happy 'cause you're like, fuck, I'm the Vikings about this

4 (58m 43s):
Mutiny up. I just can't see memes as a happy guy.

3 (58m 45s):
Okay, but hypothetically,

0 (58m 46s):
Maybe He would if you, if you disappear. I don't

3 (58m 48s):
Know if one man Can do a mutiny. I feel like one man is a lone Wolf. Right? But if somehow He got Max On, the side And pug. And And. Shane And me. And Big Cat And We muti. You We got you outta there. Do you think That the vibes would bet higher.

0 (59m 4s):
Yeah. I think We need to mutiny. And. We. I'm saying just to show him just I It We.

3 (59m 8s):
I'm not saying your absence would cause a mutiny. I'm saying That in this situation where We all hate you, hypothetically, then We Get you out hypothetically, then we'll bet. Happy. Hypothetically. This is

0 (59m 17s):
Hypothetical.

3 (59m 17s):
So hypothetically It sounds like That Drake May is got give a little spark to the locker room.

4 (59m 23s):
Yeah. I'm excited to see what happens. I'm nervous.

3 (59m 25s):
Are We still calling It Mayday?

4 (59m 27s):
Sunday Will bet. Mayday.

3 (59m 29s):
That's Mayday. But again, Mayday not a great term.

4 (59m 32s):
Mayday for the Texans may

0 (59m 33s):
Mayday for the

3 (59m 34s):
Texans. Because I, I did look up the origins of Mayday. 'cause I was like, why do pilots say Mayday when they're about to crash? So actually from, it's a French pilot term. Oh. 'cause They would say Aday ed sound. It's a French term for help. So it's just saying, help me Mede

0 (59m 49s):
Mede

3 (59m 49s):
And. Then everyone's like, oh, they're saying Mayday. So fun fact. Pardon my French

0 (59m 56s):
May memes just

3 (59m 57s):
Texted our production chat saying we're starting

0 (59m 59s):
A mutiny. Yes. Yes. And. When this is successful, we're got, we're got, we're basically just got do an experiment. On. You And. Then when They fig, when They Get the mutiny done. You're got see the vibes. They're crazy. You got Ride the Mutiny Pack.

4 (1h 0m 10s):
I just got plug And chain computers. They can't, there's no way they're muttin izing against me. Oh

0 (1h 0m 14s):
Shit. Good

4 (1h 0m 15s):

3 (1h 0m 16s):

4 (1h 0m 17s):
Kind of.

0 (1h 0m 19s):

4 (1h 0m 20s):
Something like That.

3 (1h 0m 22s):
You stole them

0 (1h 0m 23s):

3 (1h 0m 53s):
Super Bowl,

0 (1h 0m 55s):
Super Bowl.

3 (1h 0m 55s):
Listen. Sounds like Max might bet in this Mutiny. He's like, stay over at my house. It'll bet fun

4 (1h 0m 59s):
And then

3 (1h 0m 59s):
Kill him. Yeah. And. Then kill him.

0 (1h 1m 1s):
And

3 (1h 1m 2s):
Kill him. Memes is like, yeah.

0 (1h 1m 6s):
Bucks Saints, Spencer. Rattler.

3 (1h 1m 10s):
Rattler baby Spencer.

0 (1h 1m 12s):
Rattler. So

3 (1h 1m 12s):
I was the Vikings about Saints. Quarterbacks. And. I couldn't remember with the exception of Ian book The last time That the Saints had a rookie quarterback. That They had starting for him. I looked It up And. it goes all the way back to 97 with Danny wfo. Oh. So the Saints are just one of those teams. That doesn't ever start. Rookie quarterbacks ever.

0 (1h 1m 28s):
Oh yeah.

3 (1h 1m 29s):
Mostly 'cause They had Drew Brees for a long time. And then Now Derek Carr, but That That Ian book game. That

0 (1h 1m 36s):
Was, yeah, That was bad.

3 (1h 1m 37s):
That was because of Covid. I think They had both their backup quarterbacks.

0 (1h 1m 40s):
It's a Monday night game. Yeah.

3 (1h 1m 42s):
That was ugly. But yeah. Spencer Rattler. I, I'm excited to watch Spencer Rattler.

0 (1h 1m 46s):
I think, I think the Saints are alive in this game. I think the Saints are alive in this game. I think everyone's got say Spencer Rattler stinks. Hammer the Bucks. I, here's the thing with Derek Carr. Nice guy. Recurring guest. First. Two weeks looked awesome. If you saw him Monday night, It felt like He was going back to Derek Carr where It was dump off, dump off, dump off. Moonshot Pass. Maybe. Maybe Clint AK has maybe He Can mold. Spencer Rattler in his own

3 (1h 2m 15s):
Image. Now is We got bet On the sidelines for Spencer. Rattler. Or.

0 (1h 2m 18s):
I think

3 (1h 2m 18s):
He will bet up in the booth.

0 (1h 2m 19s):
I just think, I think three And a half is a lot for a division game. And, you know, Mike Evans Will Get kicked out at some

3 (1h 2m 26s):
Point. Mike Kevins loves fighting against

0 (1h 2m 27s):
At some point. He's got bet outta this game.

3 (1h 2m 29s):
But That was usually, It usually has something to do with CD Deuce.

0 (1h 2m 32s):
I think Latimore too. Latimore.

3 (1h 2m 33s):
Yeah. Yeah. Mike Evans always gets into a fight. He gets the Saints. Yeah.

0 (1h 2m 36s):
So do you guys, do you guys like the box here? Or?

4 (1h 2m 40s):
I like the Saints. I don't IBO kid We work with here has been saying, don't you know, don't overthink Spencer. Rather Rookie of the year. Offensive rookie of the year.

0 (1h 2m 49s):
Oh wow.

3 (1h 2m 50s):
That's a great way to put It. Don't

0 (1h 2m 51s):
Overthink It.

3 (1h 2m 52s):
Don't overthink That.

0 (1h 2m 53s):
All right. Wait. Alright. Yeah, I'm done. the Vikings about It. Yeah.

3 (1h 2m 55s):
I'm the Vikings about It. If you don't think about It at all, it's a great bet. So

4 (1h 2m 59s):
I'm got bet the Saints this Week Put That in mind if there's any, actually, if there's any way He does It He has to start Hot.

3 (1h 3m 5s):
Yep. Yeah.

0 (1h 3m 6s):
Here's, here's another thing to just throw in there. Just a thought starter Saints defense is still good, right? The Bucks won a game against the Commanders. Not a great defense won a game against, against the Lions. Not a great defense won a game against the Eagles. Not a great defense scored seven points against the Broncos. Very good defense. Yeah. Are the Saints closer to the Broncos Or closer to the Commanders Eagles. And Lions. I would say they're probably closer to the Broncos in terms of defense. Hmm. Just a thought starter.

3 (1h 3m 37s):
It's a good thought starter. When you put this all together. It It It ultimately is got come down to whether Or not Spencer. Rattler is good. Yeah.

0 (1h 3m 43s):
And

3 (1h 3m 43s):
Of course. And We don't know.

0 (1h 3m 45s):
Of course. But It also is, it's just one of those games. That, I, my dumb brains said, Hey, this is got bet the easiest thing ever. I'm got take the Bucks. And. Then I paused. And said, hold On a second idiot. You've been doing this a long time. You've been losing a long time. Maybe it's not That easy.

3 (1h 4m 2s):
Yeah. I I don't hate the Saints at all. Because you wanna bet On the right side of calling Spencer, rattler being good. Correct?

0 (1h 4m 8s):
Correct. Yeah. Okay. Browns And Eagles Max, what are the vibes? Do you wanna do Phillies right now? We did. It already.

5 (1h 4m 19s):
I've already done It.

0 (1h 4m 20s):
Okay. So what are the vibes for the Eagles? Let's focus On. Just the Eagles

5 (1h 4m 25s):
Browns money line.

3 (1h 4m 27s):
What, what? Why, why would you say That Max? The Browns are bad.

5 (1h 4m 32s):
The Eagles are

0 (1h 4m 33s):
Bad. Lane Johnson's back. Do you Dev Devonte Smith's back? That's not true. AJ Brown's back. What do you mean

5 (1h 4m 38s):
They? Never They haven't confirmed That.

0 (1h 4m 41s):
What about AJ Brown? And Devonte Smith.

3 (1h 4m 44s):
I heard They were bad.

5 (1h 4m 44s):
The vibe in That Stadium is going to bet horrendous

3 (1h 4m 48s):
Not if They win

5 (1h 4m 49s):
The vibe in That Stadium, they're going to get booed within one Incompletion. That Stadium is going to erupt. And Booed. That's

3 (1h 4m 56s):
What line.

0 (1h 4m 57s):
He Ego. Philly. That's what Philly

3 (1h 4m 58s):
Does. Yeah. Max Whi is ESPN segment where you're like, oh no Philly's booing too early. No,

5 (1h 5m 3s):
No. It's just That. No one expects anything out of this Eagle's team. We. It's got the Browns are got win. E

3 (1h 5m 9s):
Al also the, the Philadelphia sports culture right now. Damn. After I think That, the, the Eagles are got catch some, some residual anger from Philly fans.

5 (1h 5m 20s):
Why would you say That?

3 (1h 5m 22s):
We? Because They They

5 (1h 5m 23s):
Lost. That's what I'm doing right now. Huh. That's what I'm doing right now. Yeah. They're

3 (1h 5m 26s):
On. They're On. You guys are On edge right now.

5 (1h 5m 28s):
Yeah, but They, but They also suck.

0 (1h 5m 32s):
Do They suck? Yeah. Without wi with Lane Johnson. Who by the way, as of four hours ago, Eagles Lane Johnson to play verse Browns post-concussion.

5 (1h 5m 39s):
I've been On a plane.

0 (1h 5m 41s):
Okay. You,

3 (1h 5m 45s):
You guys also have a, a pretty winnable couple games coming up. So if you look at the Eagles schedule right now, they've got the Browns this Week, they've got the Giants next Week, then they've got the Bengals, then they've got the Jaguars. Okay? So if they're healthy, win some games. If the Eagles are healthy, the Eagles are not out of It.

0 (1h 6m 4s):
Here's another thing for you, max. According to Sports Info Solutions, They They have great stats. The Browns run a majority of single high safety. Guess who dominates Single high safety.

5 (1h 6m 20s):
Why don't you tell me

0 (1h 6m 21s):
AJ Brown, AJ Brown's got feast in this game. All the overs come On Max. I'll bet

5 (1h 6m 28s):
Taking the unders Cooper

0 (1h 6m 29s):
Deje is got play in in place of of Evonte. Maddox. That's got Get. The Eagles fans going come On.

5 (1h 6m 34s):
Sure.

0 (1h 6m 36s):
Did you guys see Deshaun Watson said That when talking about his benching And his bad places. I don't hear It. Yeah, I don't see It. I'm not On Twitter. I'm not On any social media Or things like That. So anytime That stuff comes up, the only time I hear It is either you guys Or bringing It up, Or somebody else outside the building. I just don't know who it's coming from.

3 (1h 6m 54s):
I'm got

0 (1h 6m 55s):
Guess everyone. Deshaun, I'm,

3 (1h 6m 56s):
I'm got go out On a limb. And say That. He's probably heard a few fans. That have said It at games. There's

0 (1h 7m 1s):
No way He has not heard a single thing because everyone is saying It. If He

3 (1h 7m 7s):
Hasn't heard a single thing, then That would actually make me more concerned for Deshaun because That means That. He's just, he's got this attitude all the time. Even though He doesn't know That, people want bench. He

0 (1h 7m 16s):
Would basically bet Jimmy Carter. He's just not waking up some days.

3 (1h 7m 19s):
Yeah, this is, it's concerning That. I don't believe him for the record. I don't think That, I think That, Deshaun Watson walks around knowing That He shouldn't bet. Bet. Starting right now. I actually, I did the math On some of this. Tell me if this is the craziest thing. Okay? If you're a Browns fan, granted this weekend you're playing in Philly, but you've got home games coming up. You're paying Deshaun, I believe like 47 mil. Okay. Right Over the course of this season. And, I don't think it's got Bet 47 mil every year, but I think It was 47 million this year. If you do the math, On, It, And, you do the capacity at the Brown Stadium. I think it's 65,000 people go to those games. Okay? Right. Okay. If They just all agreed to not buy any beer at the games, if there was $0 in concession sta sales at the games.

3 (1h 8m 1s):
But you can't. That comes out to about, I believe that's 40 million a year.

0 (1h 8m 8s):
But you can't ask Browns fans to do That

3 (1h 8m 10s):
Sneak your shit in. I'm saying like, yeah. I'm not saying don't drink at a Brown

0 (1h 8m 14s):
Because They got watch Deshaun Watson. Imagine

3 (1h 8m 16s):
Going to a Browns game. Sober. Yeah. And, no one's got do

0 (1h 8m 18s):
That. That's, that's actually Guantanamo.

3 (1h 8m 20s):
But Bet Creative. Sneak your beer in, sneak your liquor in.

0 (1h 8m 24s):
No concessions whatsoever.

3 (1h 8m 25s):
No concessions. Go On. A concession strike.

0 (1h 8m 27s):
I like That because

3 (1h 8m 28s):
A lot of the season tickets have already been sold for a lot of the fans. So you can't go On like a strike because then you know you paid for 'em. You want to go watch the games. Just sneak your beer in. Sneak sneak liquor And bring plastic flasks into

0 (1h 8m 40s):
The game. Why don't We start with something easy? Let's go like no popcorn.

3 (1h 8m 43s):
No popcorn,

0 (1h 8m 45s):
No nachos. You got let 'em Get drunk.

3 (1h 8m 48s):
Yeah, you got, but I'm saying sneak your shit in. Yeah,

0 (1h 8m 51s):
Because They They can't watch Deshaun Watson sober Can. That's, that's torture.

3 (1h 8m 56s):
You Can do a a a plastic flask. That you fill up from home duct tape It to your body under your shirt. I like the idea. Cleveland Can Do It. If any city Can pull It off. I'm pretty sure it's the Browns. Yeah.

0 (1h 9m 7s):
Come On Max. You guys are got win this game. When you win this game, we'd bet. Happy.

5 (1h 9m 12s):
No.

0 (1h 9m 13s):
Oh dang.

5 (1h 9m 15s):
I I refuse to get excited about any Philly sports teams for the rest of my life. You

3 (1h 9m 19s):
Got care, dude. It's not true. You

0 (1h 9m 21s):
Got care. I saw a tweet. Are

0 (1h 9m 40s):
Last 24 months for being a Philly fan. Philly's Blow. This is actually, when did you start producing the show? That

5 (1h 9m 46s):
Would bet two months before the beginning of this tweet. Tweet.

0 (1h 9m 48s):
Okay. So you started two months before this Phillies Blow World series. After two one series lead Eagles blow, second half And, super Bowl, Sixers Blow Game six, game seven. And Celtics Phillies Blow Game six. Game seven. And, NLCS. Eagles start 10 And ones Crash And Burn Sixers lose to Knicks in First Round Phillies lose to Mets. And. NLD

3 (1h 10m 6s):
Ds. Also, don't forget the, the union lost the MLS cup in overtime. And after They were winning, I think in the 80 89th minute And. The Philadelphia Water Dogs finished second place

0 (1h 10m 16s):
They Stink.

3 (1h 10m 18s):
Which one of those was the worst Max?

0 (1h 10m 26s):
Do you want me to read 'em again? Just so you know. No Phillies Blow World series after two one series lead in 2023 Eagles blow. Second half lead in Super Bowl Sixers Blow Game six, game seven. And Celtics Phillies Blow Game six, game seven in NLCS. Eagles start 10 And one Crash And Burn And Sixers Lose to Nick's First round Phillies Lose to Mets. And. NLDS.

5 (1h 10m 48s):
I think it's this one. There's no hope. There's no hope. And the window's closed for every team.

0 (1h 10m 54s):
Okay, close 'em up.

5 (1h 10m 56s):

5 (1h 11m 15s):
I'm not. I nope,

3 (1h 11m 21s):
I don't believe

0 (1h 11m 21s):
You. I don't believe you either. If you, if the Eagles dominate the next four games, you're got Bet right back.

5 (1h 11m 25s):
They haven't dominated a game in like five years.

0 (1h 11m 28s):
We. That's not true. They started 10 And one last year. Remember And They crashed

5 (1h 11m 31s):
Those games. They didn't dominate any of em,

0 (1h 11m 34s):
But no, that's not true. I'm looking at It right now. Philly's Blow World series after two one series Lead. No,

5 (1h 11m 42s):

I was always told That, Justin Herbert, I, I distinctly remember, maybe I'm being Berenstein Bears. Or Mandela affected. But Justin Herbert at one point was a di a dynamic quarterback with a sick ass arm. Right?

0 (1h 13m 7s):
Yeah. He wa He. I mean, the beginning of last year, I feel like He was And. Then He got hurt. And. Now they've changed the offense. And, they're trying to run the ball. And. He got hurt again. So It kind of just gets hurt every time. Yeah. I think I like the Chargers in this game. I said It. There's another one. That felt too obvious where I was like, oh, Broncos at home. Plus three are

3 (1h 13m 31s):
They got wear the blue helmets.

0 (1h 13m 33s):
If They do, I'm taking the

3 (1h 13m 34s):
Broncos. At some point there should bet there should bet a, a director of common sense for the Broncos. That sees how awesome those helmets were. And, they're just like, fuck It. We're not doing any of the other uniforms for the rest of the year. These were so good. Their uniforms again. Yeah, true throwbacks

0 (1h 13m 49s):
Start of last year. Yeah. He had 300 And, five yards And, three touchdown And, two touchdowns in a game against the Titans. He had 405 yards, three touchdowns in the game against the Vikings. I think that's right around where He got hurt. But yeah, He was doing okay last year. And, then It just kind of fell off. And. He got hurt. And the whole team. Remember? I mean Brandon Staley. Yep. Remember Brandon Staley?

3 (1h 14m 10s):
I remember Brandon Staley. Yeah.

0 (1h 14m 11s):
And We. Remember Brandon Stanley

3 (1h 14m 12s):
He was so frustrating.

0 (1h 14m 14s):
Yeah. I mean, so it's somewhere in there. Put up four touchdowns, 3 23 against the Lions in a shootout. It's somewhere maybe if He, I think they're got try to throw It more And also, if Rashaan Slater And Joel all come back. Like that's enormous. Yeah. Especially against a very good Broncos defense.

3 (1h 14m 30s):
Do you think That That Harbaugh was watching That chief's game. And He saw the, the Travis Kel lateral And He thought to himself, what if We did this lateral, but We pitched It back to Joel Alt. Mm. That would bet Awesome. Rumble And stumble And. Let him carry the ball a little bit.

0 (1h 14m 42s):
Did you see Sean Peyton addressed the bow? Nicks inter exchange. On the sidelines where Bon yelled at. Sean Peyton He said, it's all good. It's the heat of the moment. It's the game. It's competitive. He's fiery. This is basically just a cliche for all of this. We're in the business of passion. Mm. We're looking for passion And. We're looking for people who have passion for the game. Not other things. I think That is so important to him. Again, I love his response. We're On the next play. And. It's nothing

3 (1h 15m 9s):
I like saying we're

0 (1h 15m 10s):
Just, every class, every cliche mixed in with just a sandwich. And in the middle of the meat was, we're in the business of passion.

3 (1h 15m 16s):
I like business of passion. Yeah. That's a, that's a good thing to say about your team. Business of passion. Listen, I, I like watching Bone Next play. He might not bet the best, but God He is fun. Yeah.

0 (1h 15m 26s):
Very fun. Steelers at Raiders. Aidan O'Connell is the quarterback.

3 (1h 15m 32s):
This is perfect because That means He. I could see Antonio Pierce taking him outta the game in like the second quarter. Yep.

0 (1h 15m 37s):
For

3 (1h 15m 38s):
Gardner based On play. Yep. Not because of injury. Or, anything like That. I could see Gardner coming off the bench. And. Guess what? That's how you Get a spark. Yep. You Get Spark Gardner.

0 (1h 15m 47s):
Possibly Russ.

3 (1h 15m 48s):
Possibly Russ. I don't know. He, I, I can't begin to understand what Mike Tomlin is. the Vikings, because He doesn't And. He's got the right idea, which is why would I say anything to you guys? Yeah. Like We handle everything behind closed doors. The Patriots should have done That with Drake May, but I, I understand where He is coming from, but He is hard to read.

0 (1h 16m 6s):
Should, should Mike Toman cut George Pickens?

3 (1h 16m 11s):
No.

0 (1h 16m 12s):
Did you watch some of the tape?

3 (1h 16m 13s):
Yes.

0 (1h 16m 14s):
Holy fuck. He's not trying at all. And Then after Or Or Or this Week in the media availability, He was asked if like how He Can Get more touches his snaps back. And. He said It. Nah, it's not On me. It's all up to Arthur.

3 (1h 16m 31s):
Yeah. I mean this is George Pickens,

0 (1h 16m 33s):
But it's not It would bet One thing if He was lighting It up. Yeah. He's just a negative right now. Yeah.

3 (1h 16m 39s):
This is George p This is, I I love players like this. 'cause they're We We missed the era of the diva wide

0 (1h 16m 45s):
Receiver. But he's not even a, like, you can't even say he's a wide receiver right now. Yeah. He's not even running routes.

3 (1h 16m 49s):
He's just kind of out there. He's

0 (1h 16m 50s):
Just a diva. So I

3 (1h 16m 52s):
Open fucking always.

0 (1h 16m 53s):
I'm just, yeah. I I don't know what And Russ, Russ was. He's fully practicing now. He did the media availability. I wonder if he's the only practice guy ever who does eye black. But He had eye black On.

3 (1h 17m 7s):
Yeah. For practice. I mean, when It, when It comes time for like the road trips, That Russell Wilson knew He wasn't got play in He was just telling his family like, Hey, I got, sorry, I got a business trip That I got go to. Yeah. You'll see me On the sidelines when I go there. Just trying to get outta the house for a little bit. Yeah.

0 (1h 17m 22s):
Great, great uniform matchup. I love when the Steelers And the Raiders play yet

3 (1h 17m 25s):
Is good. So We always talk about Tomlin being when He is an underdog. Yeah. Scrappy underdog. Bet. On. He's also in the last four seasons, he's four And two against the spread when he's aero favorite. Oh. So this is another good situation for Mike

0 (1h 17m 39s):
Tomlin. I I do think even though Nick Herberg is out, I think That, the Steelers pa Pass rush is got bet all over Aiden O'Connell because They can't block anyone for the Raiders. I, I lean the Steelers, but man, George Pickens, he's, he's in my head.

3 (1h 17m 55s):
Yeah. That's, that's what He does best.

0 (1h 17m 57s):
But he's not, he's not doing anything.

3 (1h 17m 59s):
He's so fun though. He's just,

0 (1h 18m 0s):
But he's not fun. That's the thing. He is fun when He is playing And catching, but he's not fun. Yeah. George Pickens is, is if you just watch a highlight tape of George Pickens, you're like, this is the greatest wide receiver ever. Then you watch him in a game And, you're like, is this guy even trying? Yeah.

3 (1h 18m 14s):
And He. If Russell Wilson gets in, I predict That. George Pickens will hate Russell Wilson even more than He hates Justin Fields.

0 (1h 18m 21s):
Although Russell

3 (1h 18m 21s):
Might, I think things will Get worse. He

0 (1h 18m 22s):
Might just try to throw to him all the time just to, to try to get him

3 (1h 18m 26s):
That would bet the smart thing. Yeah. Is Get him involved early

0 (1h 18m 28s):
Get, him involved early best game in the afternoon. Lions of Cowboys. I'm so pumped for this game.

3 (1h 18m 33s):
Yeah. It should bet, should bet. High scoring. I hope it's high scoring. Yeah.

0 (1h 18m 36s):
I think It will bet. I have some, some good quotes from you for, from the Lions this Week We had. So Dan Campbell Frank Rag now heard his peck. Dan Campbell said He was walking through the facility last Week. When outta nowhere someone punches me against the wall. Then I Get punched again. And. I realize That, it's Frank trying to show me That. His peck is great. That's his way of telling me, look how strong I am. It's good. Yeah.

3 (1h 19m 0s):
I like That.

0 (1h 19m 1s):
That's how They figure out injuries in Detroit. I fucking love It.

3 (1h 19m 4s):
I also think this might bet one of those examples of Dan Campbell knowing what people will think about him. Yeah. And then leaning into It. And giving, tossing some red meat out there. Like when He talks about having the lion On the sidelines. Yep. I think Dan Campbell is secretly way smarter than We. Think That He is.

0 (1h 19m 19s):
Oh yeah, definitely.

3 (1h 19m 19s):
And. He loves having people think That. He's a dumb meathead. Yeah. So this might bet one of those things. He's like, I know what I'm got say. Yeah. They're got we're we're got just do injuries by punching. Yeah. And. If I feel, if you Can hurt me, then

0 (1h 19m 31s):
You're good to, you're back. You're

3 (1h 19m 32s):
Good to play football. Yeah.

0 (1h 19m 33s):
We also had, did you guys see Jordan Lewis's the Cowboys cornerback quote? It's one of my favorite quotes ever. So Amrah said That last year when They played That, Jordan Lewis was talking crazy. Like some shit I've never heard before. They asked Jordan Lewis about this. They're like, Hey, this is what Amrah said. He said, I honestly don't remember. Sometimes I just black out, just go somewhere else with It. But if I said anything disrespectful, I'd probably say It again.

3 (1h 20m 1s):
Love That. Stand

0 (1h 20m 2s):
By. It's just like, yeah. I'm got, yeah. I probably said some fucked up shit. And, guess what I'm got Do It again. Yeah.

3 (1h 20m 8s):
Call. It's calling your buddies after a night out. Hey, I don't know what happened at the end of last night, but I meant every single word That. I said

0 (1h 20m 13s):
So good. Yeah. I fucking love That quote. As for this game, I do think with Dallas's defensive line being decimated. So I mentioned em before, but Sports Info Solutions has, so the Lions run the most 12 personnel of any team in the league. The Cowboys ranks verse 12, personnel 23rd against run plays last against play action. I think this is got bet every lion's offensive weapon just going fucking off And. Honestly, I think the Cowboys are got bet able to move the ball too because the Lions run a lot of man coverage. And. I think Dak is got like this is got bet a big, I think it's got bet a points. Fiesta.

3 (1h 20m 52s):
I like That points.

0 (1h 20m 52s):
FIEs. I hope I'm right because I need a Points Fiesta in the afternoon. But I want a points Fiesta.

3 (1h 20m 57s):
Yeah. So Detroit is six in the league at rushing 151.3 yards per game. And the only team with two backs in the top 20 in rushing And Dallas has the 24th ranked run defense. Yeah. And. Then you, you Can drill It down further. 12 personnel Warren Sharp taught us one running back two tight ends. Yeah. Sound like you know what you're talking about. Yeah.

0 (1h 21m 16s):
And And the line. Or. Sorry. The Cowboys defensive line. They're bad against a rush. And. They also were injured. I don't know if Micah is back. He possibly is

3 (1h 21m 26s):
We as, as Skip Baylis will say missing Parsons report. Yeah. Has been

0 (1h 21m 30s):
Filed. He's not, he's not Hap Micah Parsons ruled. Oh no. That's for Steelers. Jerry Jones leaves Glimmer of Hope regarding Micah Parsons status for Lions Cowboys. I love, I love That. Jerry Jones the one

3 (1h 21m 42s):
Yes. It's perfect. Right? Like this is, this is a job for head coach. Instead you've got the owner slash gm slash warlord of Arlington, Texas. It's perfect. Just going out there. And telling the coach what's happening. Yeah. Remember last year in this game, That was a great game. Great game. I think we're in Arizona. Yeah. We.

0 (1h 21m 57s):
Were driving back. We were driving back.

3 (1h 21m 59s):
And the ending of this game was Peak. Dan Campbell. Oh yeah. If you thought That what Dan Campbell did in the, in the NFC championship game was reckless. This was way crazier at the end at That two point conversion. It's so much fun. It gets backed up. Fuck It. Let's still keep going for It. Yep. Yeah. So Dan Campbell's got let It all hang out this weekend. Yeah. This is nuts. Hanging out game. Yeah.

0 (1h 22m 19s):
This is a revenge game. Yep. Okay. Falcons at Panthers is the last afternoon game. I don't care. I mean, I care, but I, I, I'm the Panthers are back. We had the fun. Andy, Dalton, Week, And. Now It feels like we're just back to They. Got some They, got more injuries. On the offensive line. Like I just, I I kind of wanna take the Panthers, but I also, 'cause I just feel like Kirk Cousins is playing above his head right now. But this game stinks. I

3 (1h 22m 45s):
Think cousin's got Get bet as the season goes On too. 'cause he's got Get healthier. He's got bet more comfortable with the new wide receivers. I

0 (1h 22m 51s):
Just, this game stinks.

3 (1h 22m 54s):
Yes. But I'm, I'm kind of got disagree with That. Why It doesn't stink in a way of, you know how On YouTube tv where It says like, here's your moment of Zen during commercial breaks. And, it just plays like butterflies landing, watching Andy, Dalton, And, Kirk Cousins going up against each other in the football game. That's kinda like moment of Zen. Yeah. It's good to have It just there. I don't really care about It, but it's good. That. It's On.

0 (1h 23m 14s):
Yeah. I just think the Falcons are got probably kill em. And. It's just got bet another one of those. Oh man. The Panthers like you had one Week That Raiders win was awesome. Yeah, That was great. I

3 (1h 23m 24s):
Think it's just good. I think it's good for the soul to have Andy, Dalton And Kirk Cousins.

0 (1h 23m 28s):
Yeah. Alright. Sunday night football. Bengals of Giants must win for the Bengals who've been On a must win watch. Basically every single Week They had a players only meeting On. The defense

3 (1h 23m 39s):
Mutiny.

0 (1h 23m 39s):
Nope. Players only meeting And. Mike Hilton said, I know we've been playing like shit. For real. Honestly.

3 (1h 23m 48s):
Yeah.

0 (1h 23m 48s):
He said this, by the way, did you guys know there's a beat reporter for espn.com who covers the Cincinnati Bengals? Yeah. Whose name is Ben? Baby Ben. Yeah. Yeah. I love That Ben Baby. I laugh everything.

3 (1h 23m 58s):
That's his name. Every time I see It Ben baby.

0 (1h 24m 0s):
Great name. Seems like an awesome guy. But yeah, I would say That. That's true. They have been, what's the quote again? I know. We've been playing like shit. For real. Honestly, that's a for real And.

3 (1h 24m 11s):
Honestly. It's for real, honestly. Like shit. Yeah. So I like the Bengals in this game. Yeah. Daniel Jones is one in 13 in Prime time. Oof. Not a great record for Danny.

0 (1h 24m 23s):
Oof.

3 (1h 24m 24s):
So again, it's must win. It's a season of Must win games. It's a

0 (1h 24m 28s):
Season of must wins games. The Giants defensive line is very good. I their secondary's a little suspect. I think Joe Burrow's got keep Hey, Joe Burrow has to do It all Yeah. Until their defense shows up. He's got Do It All

3 (1h 24m 38s):
And. Do We have neighbors coming back?

0 (1h 24m 40s):
I believe so.

3 (1h 24m 40s):
Okay. I like That. So it'll bet fun to

0 (1h 24m 42s):
Watch. Believe it's, it's got bet a fun game. I'm I'm actually like weirdly thi the Giants. If They had lost the Seahawks, we'd bet going into this game being like, Ugh. Or Or. Even if, if the Giants had lost And, the And, the Bengals had won And bet. Like, forget It. But this the Giants are frisky. Yeah. They're Frisky team. And

3 (1h 24m 57s):
Their defense. And their defensive line is good. Yeah. Like no joke. They're good. I think They. Yeah. They lead the league in Sacks. Yeah. They Get. 22 Sacks. So

0 (1h 25m 4s):
This is got bet a fun game. Yeah. I'm excited for this game. Any other thoughts from Week? Six Max? You wanna take back anything you said about the Eagles? He's now this great podcast. Max He shaking his head. What

Right. And, Stephen a And. I, we great That way because He, He wanted to beat me. But, but He knew in the end I would protect him. Yeah. And, And He knew I had his back. And, He knew I loved him like a brother. And we're still to this day, brothers. So the point was That.

12 (1h 47m 50s):
We did That because I pushed for It. And, then you guys took It someplace new And different where you Can kind of argue about sports. But, but you, you don't do It the way We did. We're we're, I I'm not got lose the debate. Right? And, by the way, I never lost a debate to Stephen A. Smith is

3 (1h 48m 7s):
That true?

0 (1h 48m 8s):
You're like Lenny Dyer's stock record.

12 (1h 48m 10s):
Yeah. who lost

0 (1h 48m 11s):
We? who lost one? He lost one. He was like 300 And 50 in one

3 (1h 48m 15s):
And stock Pick six. The thing That I loved about First take, which made It very different from like around the horn. Yeah. Which you guys both had. It It was similar in That. Every conversation was a competition. Right. But the thing I loved about First take is there's no score. There's no score being kept. So

12 (1h 48m 29s):
We tried That once. And, it's

3 (1h 48m 31s):
It doesn't work. And

12 (1h 48m 31s):
And. No. You know what would happen, We. We'd let the audience sort of, I don't even know how, what We what technology We were using to let the audience actually score the debate. On the fly And. I would lose a hundred to one every time because I was the most hated man in sports media. I

3 (1h 48m 45s):
Was the one person. That was voting for you, by the way.

12 (1h 48m 46s):
Thank you for That.

3 (1h 48m 48s):
Yeah. I I remember the ESPN phone And. I would text in afterwards. But the great thing about, about First take was after It was over, the winner of the debate was actually up for debate. Then you got to debate with people about, Hey, do you like Skip? Yeah. Do you like Stephen a And? I always said the perfect thing about, about what you guys had was you took two guys. That were very, very skilled at, at, at screaming at each other. And They were maybe the only two people at ES ESPN That would disagree. On. Both of the two questions of is LeBron James? Good And Is Tim Tebow bad? True And putting That together. There was some magic That happened.

12 (1h 49m 25s):
And, it was magic And.

3 (1h 49m 26s):
Big fan of, of That entire era. Do you And I you actually believe That Tim Tebow's stuff too, right? Like absolutely. You believe That Tim Tely. If He was given a fair shot in the FL, who

12 (1h 49m 36s):
I, I'm got tell you what I said From day one, after I watched Tim Tebow beat my Oklahoma Sooners. I grew up in Oklahoma City. And, Oklahoma fan. I was born into the tradition, can't help myself. After I watched what He did to my Sooners in the second half of the championship game, And, then I saw That video of him at halftime saying, we're got

0 (1h 49m 56s):
Take the ball,

12 (1h 49m 57s):
We're got drive It down their throats. I said, God, I want That guy On my team. So I said, On the air On First take before the draft. If he's available at the bottom of the First round, I'm got take him And. If I run his college offense, I'm got win a lot of games in the National Football League. He'll never make a Pro Bowl. But I won him On, my team And, Josh McDaniels. Then the Denver head coach took him with the 25th overall pick And. When He got his chance, his rookie year after Josh got fired. So He lost his guy. Go look at what happened the last three games of his rookie year. When He did Get to play He put up big numbers, legs, And, arm And.

12 (1h 50m 37s):
They won two of those three games, including one over the Texans at home, which He drove them to the champ, the, to the, the winning touchdown at the end of the game. And, obviously when Elway And Fox took over the next year, They just wanted to get the Tebow thing out of the way when They fell to one in four. Let's just Get It over with. Let's throw him into the fire at Miami. Remember this? Yeah. Yeah. And, let's just Get It over with. 'cause he'll suck And. The fans will finally say, okay, you're right about this. And. All the zealots out there will say, okay, that's enough of Tebow. And. They won in overtime. And They kept winning games. As I kept saying, all He does is win And. So day after day, On First, take We would bring It in a parade of XNFL players, along with Stephen a And.

12 (1h 51m 21s):
Others And. They would all fight me to the death over He. Can't throw And. I'd say We. In the last five minutes of games, He has the best QBR in the National Football League throwing the football. Because as Eric Manini once said to me, you know, you're right about this. He gets accurate when it's time to get accurate. So He takes a one in four team to the division title And. All those naysayers had to keep eating Crow Monday, after Monday after Monday. And obviously our ratings went through the roof. We We did numbers in 2011. On ESP N two, obviously now pretty much abandoned by studio shows.

12 (1h 52m 3s):
But We did Numbers On. ESPN two That will never ever bet touched because of me. And Tebow. Yeah.

0 (1h 52m 10s):
And. You still think, I mean, he's not good.

12 (1h 52m 13s):
We who never got another chance, did He.

0 (1h 52m 16s):
That says He never did the beauty of It He. He's a winner. I Can just basically say That. Yeah. Yeah.

12 (1h 52m 18s):
Seriously. 20 years from today, somebody who knows nothing about what We just discussed, somebody will take the numbers. And say w wait a second. This guy won the division in 2011. And. Then He beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in a playoff game. And. Then He never got another chance to play. Never, never started another game. Nobody ever gave him a shot. Right. Okay. How Can you explain That We, you think he's just not good And. Finally, I guess Belichick chip Kelly And Philly decided We, he's just not good enough. But, but you have to, you have to give him a chance to win the game.

12 (1h 53m 0s):
Because I think He could have kept winning game.

3 (1h 53m 3s):
What about this? What if you just made him a closer, like in baseball, He just He comes in. You Get Dak out there for three quarters. Okay. Tebo comes in in the fourth quarter.

12 (1h 53m 10s):
It's a revolutionary thought. And. It's a great one. And. I do not disagree with That premise. It's just something the National Football League doesn't do because We don't do That. But someday somebody will try That And succeed with It And. Then everybody will develop a closer for their team. Closer.

3 (1h 53m 28s):
That'd bet. Awesome. Get some music playing. Have him run outta the tunnel. Yeah.

0 (1h 53m 31s):
Yeah. So have you, have you spoken with, did, did Tim Tebow ever Thank you for everything you did for him?

12 (1h 53m 38s):
I interviewed him twice. We had him once. On, First take And. Then I went to the Super Bowls in Indianapolis, That year. And. I sat with him for an hour for a piece. That We played On. First take And. I I never got close to him. Yeah. I, I never connected. I do believe in God. He obviously really believes in God in ways. That, I don't quite worship. But We never talked about That And. it surprised me, frankly. That off the air. He didn't say something to me about any connection. That We had. I, I didn't ever feel any closeness at all. So I, I didn't have a relationship. I don't have his contact. I, I just believed in him winning football games.

12 (1h 54m 19s):
Yeah,

0 (1h 54m 20s):
Yeah, yeah.

3 (1h 54m 21s):
So you, you very artfully dodged the Dallas Cowboys S Oh,

12 (1h 54m 24s):
I'm sorry. Yeah. Let's

3 (1h 54m 26s):
Scot I I love That. Yeah. It's what Count

0 (1h 54m 27s):
Is is your, is your jersey in the trash still?

12 (1h 54m 31s):
I threw 'em away. And, my wife burned them. Did she

0 (1h 54m 33s):
Burn the jerseys? Now Wait,

3 (1h 54m 34s):
Wait, wait. Hang On, she took them out of the trash. Can And. She burned them And, then put them into

12 (1h 54m 38s):
The fire. It was an exorcism. Yeah. What,

0 (1h 54m 40s):
What happened with Can Can? You explain to me what happened with the smart trash Can That one video. That was tough. It kept On closing. On you.

12 (1h 54m 47s):
Yeah. But was, was I not deadly accurate? Yeah,

0 (1h 54m 49s):
I know. But That thing was bodying you. Yeah. It was, It just kept On closing. On,

12 (1h 54m 52s):
You I, I know, but I didn't miss a throw because I was, I was going Tebow, like in the last five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Where I'm outta my mind. Yeah. It. It's, it's like pure anger is is manifesting in my deadly accuracy. Yes. Where I'm, I'm throwing with all my might. In fact, It reminds me a bit, if I may, my bad. Commodore We finally beat Alabama. And We kicked their ass. Yeah. We We We beat them. Fair And Square because We outplayed them. On Saturday in Nashville at our stadium, And, our smart students then took the goalpost, And carried It all the way down West End Avenue. It's like three miles to the Cumberland River downtown Nashville.

12 (1h 55m 36s):
And threw the goalpost into the river. It's like a hundred And, 34 years of frustration. Because We hadn't beaten a top five team in a hundred And, 34 years of playing college football. And We took 134 years. And threw It in the river. So I took every piece of cowboy memorabilia, That I own Jerseys, hats, scarfs. And. I fired every piece into the trash. She went into the trash. And, took all of the above. And burned them in a big pile in the kitchen. She Wow. Just set them On fire. So you have,

3 (1h 56m 13s):
You have no more Dallas Cowboys, merch.

12 (1h 56m 15s):
We. I started over with a number 17 jersey because I thought He was the greatest kicker I've ever seen in

3 (1h 56m 20s):
My life.

12 (1h 56m 21s):
So I decided,

3 (1h 56m 23s):
What about 11 from heaven? That's the new goat. What about, what about Parsons?

0 (1h 56m 25s):
That's the new goat. I wish he'd made That kick against the

12 (1h 56m 28s):
Giants. By the way, don't Are We talking about the guy? I have to file a missing Parsons report There We. Go. That's Parsons. That's

0 (1h 56m 34s):
Really good. By the way, you, you're Vandy. I, I I, I said this to you before when We talked for a minute. But you need to bet called to task On your tweet after Vandy won. When you said, if you watched Or heard the end of this week's Skip bail show. I strongly hinted at this possibility, but didn't wanna predict the upset for fear Bama coaches would show It to their players. And. I would do my school. You don't Get credit for hinting. Okay. You got take the pick.

12 (1h 56m 57s):
Okay. But if you listen to the end of my podcast, the Week before I, I whispered It at the end. I, I literally whispered. We have a quarterback.

0 (1h 57m 8s):
You do.

12 (1h 57m 9s):
Who gives us a chance to win every game, including this game. He just knows how to play. But don't tell anybody. Don't tell Alabama.

0 (1h 57m 17s):
Thank God you whispered It. 'cause the Bama coaches They probably can't hear the whispers.

12 (1h 57m 21s):
I don't think They did. Although They did all put, They put mouse traps in each player's locker, because this is going to bet a proverbial mouse mousetrap trap game. Yeah. And. I'm like, yeah, trap shooting like clay pigeons, you know, pull, bam. You know, like that's what the trap's got. Bet. But I, I wanted them to saunter in. I wanted them to bet drained And a little down from, from the game of the year. Yep. The game before And We were coming off a by And. We do have a Diego paa who just knows how to win college football games. It's simple as That. He's played five years of college football. And started every year. Two at New Mexico military. Two at New Mexico State.

12 (1h 58m 2s):
He brought five coaches with him to Vanderbilt, including his offensive coordinator, because We needed him to put us On the National Map. And He did. Yeah. And, if that's our version of NIL, is hiring five coaches. That's what We have to do. Yeah.

0 (1h 58m 15s):
All right. So I got a question. How do you watch all the games, And? How do you have the energy? I know you Get up at like two in the morning to run And Lift all the time. But is there, has there been a moment in your career where you've started to run outta gas Or? You're like, I can't. I mean, It, it's, it's pretty crazy. That. You're able to do It And. Keep this up.

12 (1h 58m 32s):
Big Cat. If you know me, I am obsessed with this. I, I am still more On fire than I have ever been. I, I live for It. I eat, sleep, breathe It. I can't explain It. You Can ask my wife On our First date back in 2005. I told her, if this goes anywhere, you will always bet number two to my work. Because it's not work to me. It's, it's my life. Right. It's my reason for being. I love the games. It's not a task for me to watch the games And. Then you have to figure out the why of what you just saw. So I'm really into processing the why And trying to see things others don't see.

12 (1h 59m 19s):
Not That. I'm a shock jock. It's j These things just come naturally to me. And. Then I'm going to say exactly what I see. Yeah.

0 (1h 59m 27s):
Okay. So is It do, do you surprise yourself sometimes when you're like, oh, man, this take is, this is a fiery one. That no one's got see coming.

12 (1h 59m 34s):
Yeah, but I, I don't think of It as a take, like a Hot take. I hate That cliche. Yeah. It's just me. I don't know. It's just me being me. I, I,

0 (1h 59m 42s):
Yeah. You just think you, you have the ability to think counter to what most people are seeing. And. the Vikings. Like, they'll see One thing. And, you're seeing, Hey, this is actually the story here.

12 (1h 59m 51s):
Yeah. I, I don't think of It That way, but Yeah. But I do think It turns. It's clearly turns

0 (1h 59m 56s):
Out That way. Clearly you have That because you will have, you'll have opinions that's like, oh, I didn't even think about It, That way. Wow.

12 (2h 0m 1s):
That are fresh. Yeah. Right. That, That make you think. And. Then you're got sit back. 'cause you're a smart guy. And, you're a really smart guy. And, you're got sit back. And say, oh, okay. Yeah, That That makes sense. Because I'm not, I'm not shock jockey to the point I'm coming up with something where I say, oh, this'll, this'll stir up the hornet nest. I, I don't have a Hornet nest. I, I'm just me. I'm just seeing And saying exactly what I saw last night.

3 (2h 0m 30s):
So you don't, you don't gamble On the games. Do you?

12 (2h 0m 33s):
Just with my pride, Or

3 (2h 0m 34s):
Like Mountain Dew. Occasionally. But actually, that's a good point because you, in a weird way, you have a lot at stake On every game because Yeah. You're rooting for what you just said about the game. Yeah. You're rooting for, you know, your sometimes your, your takes That, That, Zig, when everybody else is zagged, you're rooting for That to bet. Right. So you Can Get On the air And. That's true. Bet. Like I told you so,

12 (2h 0m 52s):
Yeah. Okay. I'll buy That. Yeah.

3 (2h 0m 53s):
So when you watch the games, are you watching, are you watching multiple games at once? Or, do you have, what's your setup like?

12 (2h 0m 59s):
My limit is three at once because I can't process. I, I have a hard time processing two, but I try to go three. I've got two giant screens. And, then I always have some game. On, either phone, Or, computer. Yeah.

3 (2h 1m 12s):
And. When you, when you wake up, Big Cat alluded to the workout routine. How many hours a day are We working out now?

12 (2h 1m 18s):
Okay. I, I do cardio every day for one hour. Never miss, never

0 (2h 1m 23s):
Miss what Such On a treadmill.

12 (2h 1m 25s):
I used to run outside more. Now I'm confining everything to inside. I'm in la It's just too dangerous to run outside the, the, the trap. The, the, there's psycho drivers in la. Yeah, I know They are in New York. And, Chicago, And everywhere else. But It just got too dangerous. So I'm, I'm confining myself to all treadmill. Or, upright exercise, bike. Got It. So I do That for an hour. And. I do not miss lifting Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoon. Every,

Every single, every single

12 (2h 1m 55s):
Week. I, I don't miss. Wow.

3 (2h 1m 57s):
I remember there was a profile, I forget what magazine It was in, but somebody talked about what a psycho you were in the gym, just like lock. What do you listen to when you work out?

12 (2h 2m 6s):
A lot of times I'm listening to games. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Like, you're asking me how you do It? I try to time It around a game. Like, 'cause They start earlier in California, obviously in the West. So if it's four 30, Or, five, I've got a game. On in my ear. Or. I'm just watching It at home. I got a home gym where I've got a TV in my home gym. Yeah.

3 (2h 2m 27s):
Yeah. You really are just like all sports all the time. Yeah. We And.

0 (2h 2m 30s):
Which I love. Is there date night,

Of the And cheat night. We. We have one slice of pizza every Friday night. Oh my

12 (2h 2m 45s):
Crazy. Isn't That crazy? We Get really nuts.

0 (2h 2m 54s):
You have, I know you've done two. Yeah.

3 (2h 2m 56s):
And, you eat the same thing for lunch every day. Right? Do you still do That?

12 (2h 3m 4s):
I'm happy. Crazy.

3 (2h 3m 5s):
And. Every Monday you sit down. And, you make all your Turkey sandwiches.

12 (2h 3m 8s):
No, We. Have a chef make em. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But I eat white meat, Turkey And, broccoli, And, brown rice, And like beans, like dark beans. I, I I have That kind of combination. Two big times a day. Yeah. Lunch, And dinner.

0 (2h 3m 26s):
And. That's And. Then Friday one, possibly two pieces of pizza. Yeah. And. That's It

12 (2h 3m 31s):
And. We'll, we'll go frozen yogurt On Friday night. Oh, that's,

0 (2h 3m 34s):
That's now

12 (2h 3m 35s):
We. Just there's a big cheat.

3 (2h 3m 36s):
Now's a bad.

0 (2h 3m 37s):
That's

3 (2h 3m 38s):
Crazy. So, when We, were talking about the Cowboys earlier. It always reminds me of, you know, to go back to you And Stephen a having the constant debates about the Dallas Cowboys. You And Stephen a part ways. You go out to the West coast, the Cowboys losing the playoffs. It felt like Stephen a turned up the Cowboys dial a little bit. Yeah. Put the cowboy hat. On. Sure. It always felt like He was sending secret messages to you. Like, this is for Skip. It's for an audience of one. I'm still rubbing It And for Skip. Did you feel That way too?

12 (2h 4m 5s):
I thought He was doing It for his ratings. Just to remind everybody. Now he's the cowboy hater as opposed to me being the cowboy lover. So I thought It was smart. On his part. But I'm a psycho sicko cowboy fan. I'm spoiled Rotten And. You asked me about

0 (2h 4m 22s):
Back. Yeah.

12 (2h 4m 24s):
I'm just not buying. Yeah. I don't believe I've, I've seen enough. I know what He is. And what? Especially He is not He is two And five in the postseason. And. Every time a big moment has come in a postseason game, That is begging to bet won. He's not there. And They played a game three years ago at San Francisco. That was begging to bet won by the defense when Micah was riding highest And And. He was least a defensive player of the year. Candidate. And And He basically took over a game at San Francisco. That, the offense needed one play to bet made.

12 (2h 5m 5s):
And Dak missed five open receivers in That game. And They lost a a close game. And That was as close as they're ever going to come to getting to an NFC championship game with Dak Prescott at quarterback. Wow. And. Yet Jerry has committed to him for four more years, made him the richest player in the history of pro football, because Jerry just wants to sell tickets. And Dak will sell tickets because he's safe. And, you know, he's going to put up gaudy enough numbers to bet somewhere. On the fringe of the MVP race. And, they'll win some games. I got him at eight. And nine, missing the playoffs.

12 (2h 5m 46s):
But, but they'll win enough games. As They stole one the other night at Pittsburgh because of Dak in the end, after He had three horrendous turnovers, two in the red zone, they'll bet just good enough to bet a factor just good enough to, to bet relevant. Just good enough to bet the team nobody Can take their eyes off of. So that's why Dak is the quarterback. I I was praying for Trey Lance to have a sensational preseason to the point That. Jerry would say, We, maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. I should go here. And plunge with him the way the Shanahan's plunged. No.

0 (2h 6m 22s):
Yeah. That did not happen. Yeah. Just

12 (2h 6m 24s):
Did not happen. Sometimes wake

0 (2h 6m 25s):
Up And cold sweats the Vikings about Mason crossbar.

12 (2h 6m 29s):
Yeah. No game has ripped my guts out more than That game did. Yeah. Because That was, That was arguably D's best game of his career. That was his First playoff game. That's when They were the one seed. That's when They had a home playoff game against Aaron Bleep And Rogers, who always plays the best against the Dallas Cowboys. We. There's something who

0 (2h 6m 50s):
And the Bears. But yeah.

12 (2h 6m 52s):
I'll give you That. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. But that's, that's like too easy,

0 (2h 6m 55s):
Right? Yeah. That's also, I'll give you That. Yeah. But yeah, He That was a, okay. That. So That That.

12 (2h 7m 0s):
So they're the one seed at home. Yeah. And. They're not ready to play. And They come out And fall. What, what was It 21 to something behind 21 to three And. Here came Dak And. Here came Zeke And Dak was made possible by Zeke And. I didn't see That coming. I was more Dak at That Point. But Zeke was leading the league in rushing And. He was such a force. And a factor. That It allowed Dak to maximize himself as a fourth round pick in his rookie year. So all of a sudden, bam, bam, bam. He's got Des Bryant We We roll back. And And We tie the game. And. Then It took Mason crossbar hitting two intergalactic field goals.

12 (2h 7m 44s):
That had no chance of, of making It over the crossbar. And. The, the First one was a dying quail. That. That That He missed to the right He He. Actually, It was, It was a near shank. But It was definitely a slice. And, it faded just over the crossbar from 53. Maybe the First one was And. The second one we're indoors. And, go back. And. Look at, I dare anybody call up the video. It hooks badly off his foot. There's no wind in indoors. He hooked. It And. As soon as It left his foot, I won. Yeah. And And. The hand of God comes down. And And pulls the ball back inside the left upright.

12 (2h 8m 25s):
I don't know how a football hooked. Left And then somehow faded back to the right with no wind. I don't know how It happened. It was not meant to bet. Yeah.

3 (2h 8m 35s):
That's probably the closest they've come to That was a a pretty good team too. I We Lemme ask this about this. The new iteration. That We. See, the Cowboys are We still all in. Or Are We. All in my ass.

12 (2h 8m 45s):
All in my ass. I, I tweeted That. And. it blew up. And And. I was like, what? What's wrong with That? I, I think somebody thought It was some perverse sexual

0 (2h 8m 56s):
Yeah, yeah. No, that's exactly what people thought. Yeah.

12 (2h 8m 59s):
Yeah. I I, no, it's just all in my ass.

0 (2h 9m 2s):
All in my ass. Yeah. The why you follow no one On Twitter? Do you ever see any other tweets? Like what, what, what's up with That?

12 (2h 9m 10s):
You know, you asked me about forming opinions. Yeah. I just don't wanna bet influenced by what anybody else thinks. Yeah. So I don't need That. I don't want That. I, I wanna bet completely true to myself. Authentic as cliched And. Silly as That might sound to you guys. I, I just wanna bet me, And, I don't need anybody to define me. Or to help me form my opinion. I don't wanna respond to what the public's opinion is. I, I wanna set the tone And the table And. You know, my, I, I only had my days working with Stephen a And, Shannon Sharp, both of whom I love. Like brothers.

12 (2h 9m 51s):
My, my only grievance with either one of them was when we'd go to break And, they're looking at their phone. And, they're scrolling. Like seeing what, what Twitter said in those days. Twitter We. What did They say about what I just did? Yeah. As as if They need validation. That They won the argument. Wait, And And then in my days with Stephen, a one guy in Alaska would say, you just got your ass kicked. Are, aren't you embarrassed? And And, We. Come out a break. And We, We. Go back. On live tv. And. He's angry at me for reasons I don't know. And. Then He might turn to his camera.

12 (2h 10m 32s):
And say And, I don't care what you say. I'm right about Tim. Tebow, Or, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And, he's out of his mind. I'm saying, what, what are you doing? Yeah, And. It's because there was the one guy in Alaska who, who told him He just got his ass kicked. Yeah. And, I would say, you're so much bet than That. You, you, you're Stephen a freaking Smith. Just stand On your own two feet. You, you don't need validation. You don't, you don't wanna let them creep into your psyche. And, define who you are, On the air to actually have play a role. And, And, how you're got respond to me And, then coming out of the next break. Seriously. So that's, that's why that's

0 (2h 11m 12s):
Commendable. Yeah. I, I I think it's a very human emotion. And instinct being, being out in the public sphere. And looking for That

12 (2h 11m 20s):
Validation. Do you guys look at what people

0 (2h 11m 22s):
Say? And? I, I try, I try not to as much because of what you just described, where it's like, I could see a hundred positive comments. And, one guy And That will ruin my day. So I've, I think I've gotten bet as my

12 (2h 11m 33s):
Career's gone out. You know, I was a, one guy ruined my day guy. I started in 2009, On Twitter And for maybe a year. I, I would look at my ads, my responses, my mentions, And. I would find, I would see one guy who said, your hair looks like shit today. And. And. I would think It does. Yeah. My hair looks like shit. Maybe It does. Yeah. Maybe It does And it would start to affect my concentration. Okay. So why, why would I inflict That upon myself?

0 (2h 12m 4s):
Yeah. No, it's smart. It's a good way to, it's a good way to go through It. So your career was there. I mean, you, you don't lack in confidence. I think that's fair to say. Was there a moment though, where you, not And not a light bulb moment, but it's, let's say a light bulb moment where it's like, oh, I Can do this And. I I have a skill here. And. This is what, you know, I'm good. On Air, I'm good. On radio. Was there That moment for you? Or? Did you just always think, Hey, I'm the best I Can do this?

12 (2h 12m 30s):
That's a great question. Thank you That. Great question. Thank

0 (2h 12m 33s):
You.

12 (2h 12m 36s):
I'm not sure I have That moment. So, quick background story. I began to do things for ESPN in like 1989. I started being a, a regular On, what was called Sports reporters with Dick Schapp back in the day. Mike Lupica, Tony Kornheiser, Bob Ryan And. I found right away, I, I, I liked the medium. It. It was good for me because I could really, I'm more introverted off camera, but, but I could really come outta my shell And. Just bet me And. That's the real me On camera more than off camera.

12 (2h 13m 19s):
And. And, ESPN liked what I did. So They started a show called Cold Pizza, whose remnants are still First take. But They started in 2004. And. Mark Spiro was running. ESPN. And called me. And said, you've done a lot for us. I need you to come to New York. And, try to help us save my show. 'cause That was his signature morning show based in New York City. It was a show loosely based On Sports That was sort of the GMA Good Morning America of ESPN. Not a great idea because if you want GMA And, you're just a casual sports fan, you'll probably just watch GMA right?

12 (2h 14m 2s):
And They. Were getting no ratings. So He said, I love you as a debater. It's what you do best. I I'm got sports up cold pizza. I want you to do four segments a day. It was with Woody Page at That Point. 'cause He was already On the show. You guys go back And Forth four times a show. And, let's see if We Can spike the ratings, which We We started to do. But the First morning I was there. We did one rehearsal for the, the show runner who was not a sports guy named Brian Donlin, who became a good friend of mine. So, We We go into the debate. It was just something We did trick up at That Point just to see how It felt.

12 (2h 14m 41s):
We were going live the next day. And two sentences flew outta my mouth. I went, First And. Brian Donlin came running out of the control room down onto the floor of the New Yorker hotel at 34th And eighth And Manhattan, where We shot the show. And screamed at me. You're Can. I say That. Yeah. Say

0 (2h 15m 0s):
Whatever the fuck you want. Yeah.

12 (2h 15m 2s):
He says, you're way too fucking Hot for morning television. And. I'm like, Brian, trust me, On. This, this is what you need for morning television. And. That was a eureka moment because I stopped him in his tracks. And He shook his head. And, He said, okay, okay, just, just take It down one notch for me. And. We'll bet. Okay. So We finished the rehearsal, And. I took It down one Notch, And. Then the next morning I took It two notches. Back up And. The rest was ratings history. Because They eventually pulled every plug in New York City. On, ESPN. Stephen A is quite frankly, And.

12 (2h 15m 43s):
They had Howie Schwab stumped the Schwab And, Josh Elliot On, ESPN Classic. All plugs got pulled. But They couldn't pull the Cole Pizza plug because We were making money because We were starting to rate in large part because of the debates. Right? 'cause We were actually doing some hardcore sports talk in the midst of the pet segments. And the ballpark food segments. And the cigar segments. That were good Morning America. On, ESPN. Yeah. So from there, They just took us up to the mothership in Bristol. And rebranded us. First take And. The rest is history.

0 (2h 16m 19s):
Yeah. That. So That is the kind of a light, light

12 (2h 16m 21s):
Bulb moment. Yeah. That was a moment. Yeah.

3 (2h 16m 22s):
It was like this. This one segment actually deserves its own show. Deserves to bet. Have other shows even packaged around the idea. That, this is our centerpiece of the mornings. At what point did you First debate Stephen A. Smith And? Did you realize instant chemistry?

12 (2h 16m 36s):
I did. And That is also a great question. Thank you. Great question. Thank you. That was in Los Angeles in 2000. And two We were both On. Jim Rome show On, what was called Fox Sports net. It was the forerunner to Fs Ones Today. And Jim did a show called The Last Word, On. Fox Sports Net. And He would frequently have different sort of sparring partners. On He loved me, And One day, fatefully, I got paired with this guy, Stephen A. Smith And. I got a kick outta him from day one. And And, right away, We got into It about some NBA topic, And.

12 (2h 17m 20s):
Jim became a spectator at tennis Match where his head was just going back, And forth, And back, And forth, And back, And forth And. I knew right away this had magic to It. We just clicked because He has the greatest gift of gab in the history of television. In my view. And, there's something about his respect for me was instant And, you, you have to bet able to respect where He He, let me go hard at him. He's got a big ego. And. I love him. But He has a huge ego because he's earned a huge ego. And, yet He already had It. Then And He allowed me to go right at him, And And to make little jokes about him.

12 (2h 18m 6s):
And And to, to insult him in the realm of the debate. You don't know what you're talking about. No one Can tell Stephen a That. But I, I just knew right away he's going to let me say That to him because He didn't know what He was talking about. Right. So I was just telling him the truth. You're, you're just so wrong about this because of x And y And Z. Yeah, but And, And He loved for me to set tables for him because he's a great reactor. As, as opposed to a Preact. I'm more of a pre reactor. We're I'm got go boom, boom, boom. And, And, He, Can, sit back, stroke his chin. And say We. Wait a second. And He.

12 (2h 18m 46s):
Can. Take my point. D And say, did you just say That? X is Y? Yeah. I said, That. What do you, what do you make of It? And. Here we'd go off On a tangent. That He was comfortable playing over here in That. Might not bet the question That was originally asked by Jim Rome. And. I knew you. You can't teach That. You can't coach It. You guys know It. You have It. It's connection. It. It's chemistry. That, That either happens Or. It does not happen. And, there's, there's no manager. There's no showrunner. I, I don't know what you guys go through behind the scenes, but Hank

3 (2h 19m 28s):
Tells us what to do all the time. Yeah. He's the public master.

12 (2h 19m 30s):
Yeah. Okay. We. That's fine. And And. Yet He can't tell you exactly what to say. When it's time to say It And right away. I'm, I'm in your flow right now. And And. It's really a beautiful place to bet. Because it's magic. You have It. And. I don't know why you have It. You could thank God Or. You could thank, you could thank the gods of Bar stool. I don't know. It, something happened. That connected. The two of you. And. You play off each other. And, you're comfortable with the flow of this And. You don't step On each other. And. I don't know if you ever fight off the air, whatever. You probably do because I did with Stephen a occasionally.

12 (2h 20m 12s):
'cause it's what happens when you're doing this. Although you guys don't do It at the sort of go for the throat level. That. We did. But the the point is just knew right away. That He liked me. That turned into loved me. Right?

0 (2h 20m 28s):
So yeah. And And it all. I I love That answer because chemistry is the most important thing. I We We don't really fight off air. The only time We ever really had was the, the dip

3 (2h 20m 37s):
Spit Spit the dip spit. I accidentally left a bottle of dip spare. I used to, yeah.

0 (2h 20m 40s):
Okay. And. it was all the way to the full.

3 (2h 20m 42s):
But It might not have been

0 (2h 20m 43s):
My bottle. It had no cap. On

3 (2h 20m 44s):
It. But It also might not have been.

12 (2h 20m 46s):
Okay. But real quick. So would, would there ever bet a show where, where Big Cat thinks That That PFT jumped in too much? Or Or, you, you've just We

3 (2h 20m 59s):
We've never thought about anything like That. Like That. No, not, not like to the, to the point of arguing about something On the show.

0 (2h 21m 4s):
It. The, the, I mean, I, I'll say this. We've been doing this for eight plus years. Yeah. There's definitely shows where, I'll walk away And bet like, oh, That wasn't our best. But We consistently are doing It every time. And, there's also a lot of shows where I'm like, We. We'll say It out loud. Like That was a great show. Yeah. Like We hit everything. Okay. We We. Were in the flow. Sure. Okay. What, so my, I'm very curious because what you said was, was kind of beautiful about chemistry. And, I believe in It big time. What We have here is special And. I I don't take That for granted. You're now though, kind of going out On your own. So is there part of you That is got Miss That And. Are you a little not scared? 'cause I don't think you probably ever Get scared. Maybe if Charles Barkley showed up to at your door, you might Get scared We Can Get to That later.

0 (2h 21m 44s):
But

12 (2h 21m 45s):
My, my wife would handle him. Trust me.

0 (2h 21m 47s):
Okay. Yeah. Shout out to Ernestine. Is there though a, a piece of you that's like, I, I don't know if I want to do this solo because I don't have That foil. Someone to go back And forth with play tennis. Almost.

12 (2h 22m 1s):
Also a good question because a good question. I now, ironically, I'm coming after you guys, like, I wanna do what, what you did. I did the linear TV at the highest level. And. I needed another challenge. And, this is It. You were in the right space at the right time. And And. You guys are extraordinary. Not just you guys, but the whole bar stool. Universe is extraordinary. What you have achieved in a fairly short time. So maybe I'm a little late to the party, but I need to bet late to the party because I need That Challenge. And, I found over the last two years, On linear tv. As those ratings start to erode slowly but surely.

12 (2h 22m 44s):
That people want video. They want digital And. I was reaching far more people with my videos, with my tweets than I was On linear television. And. it was an eyeopener to me till this was two years ago. I'm saying I, I got go do this And, yet I got take baby steps because the hardest thing I'm finding right now is to find the right foil figure. I'm still doing my solo podcast. I I just go solo for an hour. I don't know if anybody does That On the internet the way I do It And. It's fine. And. It's, I Can scratch the itch.

12 (2h 23m 24s):
But, but We are now trying to develop three Or, four different shows. An interview show, a debate show. I'm, I'm even the Vikings very strongly. Every time I had Ernestine On Air with me, On undisputed, the ratings went through the roof. And we're the Vikings about she And I doing a show together. 'cause she is a live wire fireball. She's the only one who will shut me down. Yeah. So we're the Vikings about even trying That. But, but the foil figure for the debate show has been very difficult for me to find so far. Right. And We are scouring the, the backwaters for

0 (2h 24m 3s):
It. Yeah. Yeah. So And And And, you, you obviously leave FS one. You know what is It a month? Or two ago. Yeah. The, the ending with Shannon. People talk about, are there any regrets there? Because obviously there was It felt like what you were talking about where Pft nine We don't fight off air. Yeah. But It felt like It was kind of a real fight. On air at times. Yeah. And And viewers Can. See That And feel That And. That's where It might turn a little

12 (2h 24m 29s):
Bit. Yeah, I understand. That. Yeah. Trust me, On this I love That guy. And We. Were together for seven years in a very different way than you guys are together. Because We took It up a notch from Stephen a And. I, because in the end, Stephen a is more of a showman, an entertainer. So our debates could bet a little sillier than the X Pro football player. Now in the Hall of Fame versus me, because I do know football And, I would take It to whatever depth Shannon wanted to go to On X And O Football.

12 (2h 25m 11s):
How wherever He wanted to go, I'll go there because I learned from a lot of great people in this business. I, I learned from Don Shula And, bill Walsh And, Tom Landry And Jimmy Johnson. I I know football. I don't know the jargon. That Shannon knows about 22 men, And bomb blitz, And, whatever the Denver Broncos used Or. The Baltimore Ravens used for jargon. But We would Get into It about football. And He would Get miffed, occasionally That. I would dare to go That deep with him about football when I didn't play football. And, I've said this from day one. My experience debating pro football, Or basketball players is the greater They were at playing.

12 (2h 25m 56s):
Sometimes the less They actually Can explain about why That Or That Or That happened. Because not That They didn't work hard. But It came so naturally to them. That They can't see Or feel exactly why It works. See Michael Jordan as the team builder in Charlotte, who was the biggest disaster of a general manager in the history of sports. The greatest performer, And player in the history of sports was the worst team builder in the history of sports for low those many years in Charlotte. Because He couldn't see why Can He play And He can't. Because He was too supremely gifted at what He did.

12 (2h 26m 36s):
Yeah. Okay. So We would clash occasionally On the football part. Don't you understand? I'm in the hall. Yeah. I Get It. I I understand, but That That doesn't mean I can't have an opinion That's correct. About whether He, Can, Or can't play. So my point is, I loved every minute with Shannon, but We took It to levels of supreme debate where It It went right to the edge. And occasionally, slightly over the edge of competitive. Yeah. To where We got mad at each other. And by the seventh year. It's a long time man. We We had some great runs. We did some big ratings.

12 (2h 27m 16s):
Numbers. Trust me, That will never bet, touched again in FS one history. I doubt God bless him, but I doubt It. But the point was That. Yeah. In year seven, did We fray a little bit? Sure, We did. But I fought for him to stay And. I don't know what happened between Shannon And the people upstairs. 'cause I was not privy. Right. But, but He went before I went. Yeah. You know, And And it It tore me apart. Yeah. I did not want him to go And. I told him the last day I sat with him in his dressing room. And. I said, I envy you because you're got Get to go do what I want to do. Right. I still had a year left. On my deal.

12 (2h 27m 57s):
And. He got pushed out the back door. And it tore me up. And, I missed him.

Molson Coors (2h 28m 2s):
We'll, Get back to Skip in a second. He's being brought to you by Coors Light. There's no sports experience. Quite like the rivalries between college football teams. And now On.

0 (2h 29m 13s):
And. So, so what would happen when you would go I, I like, I like the idea of supreme debate, by the way. It's like a, like, it's almost like nirvana. You've reached the higher path. It's like a ayahuasca of debate. Yeah. You've gone through the wall. True. But what would happen when It would, Get frayed a little, like the, the famous, obviously the Tom Brady That moment.

12 (2h 29m 32s):
That was the moment.

0 (2h 29m 32s):
Yeah. That was the moment. But what happens after the cameras are off is It. Fuck you. Fuck you. Is It. No, don't talk for a while. Like what? Tell, tell us as viewers, what, what, how That comes back together a little bit. Or. Did It not come back together?

12 (2h 29m 46s):
I showed him from day one in 2016. Shortly after you guys had started, our First day was September 6th, 2016. You were

0 (2h 29m 55s):
We. Were March. March.

3 (2h 29m 56s):
Six months

12 (2h 29m 57s):
Old. Yeah. So you were about six months ahead of us. I tried to make him understand, 'cause I handpicked him because I really thought He could do this. And, He, Can do It. And did do It, because Shannon works hard at the craft. He. He was always prepared. And always On time. And always there for me. And, I, I love him for That. And, I will bet forever Grateful for to, to him for what He gave to me for seven great years, Or, maybe six And a half-ish. Because now to these incidents, the the one, okay, so I think I misunderstood some of what He was saying, but what we're talking about Brady And, I'm a Brady fan.

12 (2h 30m 43s):
I don't even know Tom Brady. But And He won seven of these And. I Can make a case. He should have won eight, because I still don't understand why Bill Belichick benched Malcolm Butler for the Philly Super Bowl. I, I don't Get It. I, I've not heard a rational, reasonable explanation of what happened. But He played the most Snaps On defense. And then He doesn't play any snaps in the Super Bowl. And. I don't Get It. Something must have happened behind the scenes. But both Tom And Malcolm said, nothing happened behind the scenes. My point is, It It, it's hard to rip That. It's, it's hard to It. It's, it's hard to criticize That As savagely as Shannon began to criticize Tom Brady.

12 (2h 31m 27s):
And. I just couldn't Get It And. So at one point, He says to me, you, you do understand I'm in the Hall of Fame And. I said, yeah, but you're, you're not in this guy's universe. He won seven Super Bowls. Nobody's in his universe. And. Shannon got mad about somehow I'm disparaging his career. We, no, He won three Super Bowls. And, he's in the Hall of Fame. And, there was some misunderstanding to It, but, but there was no lingering fight about It And When We went to commercial, I, I I, I tried to show him from day one, when We go to commercial, I am letting all of It go. Hmm. I'm passionate about It, but I also know the show must go On.

12 (2h 32m 9s):
So I'm got walk away for a second, as I always did. I walked over to my little desk, And. I began to prep for our next debate, And. I let It go. People who ran the show decided We should maybe sit down after That one. And We did. And We had a great talk about It. And. We hugged And went On to the next day. So We were really good. Yeah. We We got through It. But That was the only day I Can remember where He actually got mad On the air. Yeah. You

0 (2h 32m 37s):
Could see It And. That's where It gets uncomfortable. Where it's like the chemistry

12 (2h 32m 40s):
Kind of. Yeah. And And. I told you. Yeah. Once you cross That line, audience is like, yeah, we're

0 (2h 32m 45s):
Out. Yeah.

3 (2h 32m 45s):
Yeah. So that's the the danger you run when you do supreme debate. That's

12 (2h 32m 48s):
Supreme debate. Supreme debate. And. I needed ayahuasca after That. Yeah. You've

0 (2h 32m 53s):
Reached levels That. No man has ever reached a

3 (2h 32m 55s):
Debate. So, so Shannon leaves And like We talked about. You're trying to find your foil. Good luck with That. I hope, I really hope, I mean, in my own personal dreams, I would hope That, at some point, you And Stephen a somewhere down the line could link back up again.

12 (2h 33m 9s):
You never know. What's

3 (2h 33m 10s):
The percentage chance of That happening?

12 (2h 33m 12s):
I have no idea. We tried in 2020. To his credit, my deal was up after my First four years. So I've been there from 2016 to 2020. And He did his darnedest. And, I did my damnedest to reunite with him. And They did make an offer. And, I was unaware. I had a matching clause in somewhere at the very bottom in very fine print of my contract. That was standard to all contracts. I was told I had one at ESPN That. I was not aware of And. Not only did Fox match, They did sweeten the pot, thank you to Lachlan Murdoch for That.

12 (2h 33m 54s):
So They tried to make this happier for me to stay. But, but I tried everything in my power to rejoin him, because I missed him dearly. Nothing, no disrespect to Shannon. I'd done four years with Shannon. I wanted to go back with Stephen a And. Then ESPN came up with a second idea of a hybrid show whereby I would stay On, undisputed He would stay On, First take. But every afternoon, We would reunite for 30 Or, 45 minutes to do esp n plus together digital show. And We tried And, tried to make this happen. And. It's just there are too many egos involved.

12 (2h 34m 34s):
On both sides. Yeah. To, to have those, I

3 (2h 34m 36s):
Think, yeah. That would bet messy. Two, two competitors. You know, Fox doesn't want to give anything to

12 (2h 34m 40s):
ESPN plus They. They don't. Yeah. And vice versa. So That never got off the ground.

3 (2h 34m 44s):
We. I, I hope you find somebody. I hope you find your, your next foil And. I hope That foil is Stephen A. Smith somehow. Thank you. Thank you. But, but Shannon goes On. He's obviously done. Oh, he's really We at ES pn On his own. Did you, did you happen to see his Instagram live?

12 (2h 34m 59s):
I did not. Did

3 (2h 34m 59s):
You heard about the Instagram Live?

12 (2h 35m 1s):
I, I heard about It, but I'm, give me some details.

3 (2h 35m 4s):
Okay. He was engaged with in an activity. Oh yeah. I thought you We got,

0 (2h 35m 9s):
Actually, I thought We We got reenact.

3 (2h 35m 10s):
It. Okay. Okay.

0 (2h 35m 12s):
Mm. Puppy. Puppy. Mm.

3 (2h 35m 15s):
Oh. And. That. It was like That for about, about 20 minutes. Can't

12 (2h 36m 13s):
Takes straight, takes hard, long form. Bearing my soul, emptying my heart. All the passion spills And. I've been doing It for a couple of years. I kind of did It with my left hand at Fox. Just to have some outlet. Something else besides undisputed And. Yet my greater passions lie in all these other shows. That, We are developing. Yeah.

3 (2h 36m 41s):
Did you, did you find That over the years, you're, you're enjoyment of sports has increased Or,

12 (2h 36m 48s):
Decreased, increased.

3 (2h 36m 49s):

12 (2h 37m 0s):
I mean, my God, I, I watched Vanderbilt University beat Alabama. And And. it was the greatest moment of my sports watching existence On this planet to where I, I felt a joy. That, I'm, I'm getting goosebumps as We speak. That. That lingers. That That continues On through the Week for me, I felt a satisfaction That, I could spill out in my podcast. That dropped this morning. That, I've never felt watching a game. And. I'm still going strong. You know, like, like It, It, It. Those things are happening. They're still out there. I, I was watching the Dodger game last night.

12 (2h 37m 42s):
And They used They, used eight pitchers. Yeah. And. I'm the Vikings We. You can't do That. I grew up in an era with Bob Gibson going nine every night in two hours. And two minutes. And And. I'm watching Dave Roberts use eight bullpen. You know, he's going one inning, 1.1 inning. And. I'm the Vikings. This is absurd. The, the, the way the evolution has changed in this game. So, I'm fast. I I can't, I I can't stop talking about all these things. That, drive your lives. Right,

0 (2h 38m 17s):
Right, right. Is there a take Or an opinion. That, you wish you had back Or one That. You're like, man, That was dumb. Or. Do you just always look forward? Never look

0 (2h 38m 34s):

0 (2h 39m 4s):
Here's one. Mano the next Ray Lewis.

12 (2h 39m 8s):
Yeah. I, I didn't know about the fishing incident. That was about to

0 (2h 39m 12s):
Transpire. Alright. So you weren't familiar? Yeah. Like there was story material

3 (2h 39m 15s):
Change

0 (2h 39m 15s):
Story. Okay. All right. I like how you're, this is good. Okay.

12 (2h 39m 18s):
You're like Johnny Manzel. I, I thought He could go to Cleveland. And take the town over to where he'd bet bigger than LeBron James. Ultimately, because football is way bigger than basketball. And Cleveland, Ohio. And. Yet I said repeatedly On the air And. My bosses did not like It. I said, if He ever has drug Or alcohol problems, That plague him going forward into the NFL. 'cause I had heard lots of stories. I said, I'm out. Yeah. So, He did And. I was out. That

0 (2h 39m 47s):
Was smart. Okay, what about this one long term? Give me Josh Freeman over Cam Bet leader. more consistent passer. Okay. more clutch, more poised under fire. more careful with the ball.

12 (2h 39m 59s):
Yeah. Love Josh Freeman at Kansas State. And. Love you. You know, They went 10, And six at 10 32nd. Okay. He's just wriggling outta I'm not wriggling. I'm, I'm telling you. Wait, what year was That?

0 (2h 40m 9s):
That was 2012.

12 (2h 40m 10s):
Okay. Oh, He also.

3 (2h 40m 13s):
He had, I think you were Skip I, I'm trying to take his side as many

12 (2h 40m 16s):
As possible. He had this, He had some substance abuse issues.

3 (2h 40m 18s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 40m 18s):
See, this is, this is like, this is watching,

12 (2h 40m 20s):
But I, I can't know.

0 (2h 40m 20s):
That PSO Paint. Yeah. No, you can't know That. That's

3 (2h 40m 23s):
Material change. But also also, cam Newton won an MVP in what? 20 did 2015. Yeah. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. Newton

0 (2h 40m 30s):
Kim Newton pretty clutch. He won a Heisman, That was a pretty, pretty crazy year with a He. Won a national title with the, not a great Auburn team.

3 (2h 40m 36s):
But then He started Dabbing.

12 (2h 40m 37s):
Yeah. He won another one at, in On the junior college level. Yeah.

0 (2h 40m 41s):
Yeah. Yeah. He was, He was pretty good. I mean, They, I, I like That. You're able to, you're able to find your way out of all these.

12 (2h 40m 48s):
No, I just, I, I I can't know if, if They have off the field issues. Right. That are going to derail them. If, if you saw Josh Freeman beat Texas at Texas when He was at Kansas State, And They were nothing. Yeah. He was impressed. You're a college guy. Yeah. You know.

0 (2h 41m 3s):
Okay. Yeah. No. Josh Freeman. I like co I like Josh

12 (2h 41m 5s):
And That year. He's a pro bowler And. They're 10 And. Six And. I'm sure that's when I tweeted That. But

0 (2h 41m 10s):
Ca ca ca I am, I am a college. Cam was really good in college.

12 (2h 41m 13s):
He was He had the issue at Florida. That got him kicked outta Florida, right? Yeah.

0 (2h 41m 18s):
But He was really good at,

3 (2h 41m 19s):
He was really good. I think Cam Newton has seen That last year at Auburn. That might've been the best season of any college player of all time. Yeah. He

12 (2h 41m 25s):
Could make the case. Yeah.

3 (2h 41m 26s):
But you didn't see Josh. But Josh dream was also very good. He was second. He was number two.

0 (2h 41m 30s):
What about, so where are We at with LeBron right now? Now, I, I I'm MJ over LeBron. But what, where, what does LeBron have to do for the rest of his career to maybe Get a little bit of respect.

12 (2h 41m 42s):
Respect. I mean, he's got respect. He's got respect. Listen, I still call LeBron the best passer in basketball to this day, to this moment. He's the best passer in basketball. He is the greatest driver of the basketball I have ever witnessed. On any level at any time. The poor man was just born without a clutch. Gene, And, We. See It again. And again. And again. So all of my LeBron debates have always been in the context. That, you started this question with, yeah. MJ, Or, LeBron, stop. It. Don't, don't, don't even go there because it's offensive to me. You would put those two in the same sentence because LeBron could not carry Jordan's sneakers.

12 (2h 42m 24s):
And Mike's got a lot of sneakers to carry. Right. So where is He now? He's played 20,000 plus more minutes than MJ played 20,000 more minutes than Michael Jordan played. And. He's the greatest scorer in the history of basketball. Even though he's a 74% free throw shooter for his career, which is pathetic, given his magnitude as a score as a three point shooter. He's at 34.8% go off, which among active players ranks in the two hundreds And among all players all time ranks in the seven hundreds of three point shooting.

12 (2h 43m 5s):
Yet he's the greatest scorer ever because of longevity. Because He has stayed healthier at a high level. He's obviously supremely gifted as a driver of the basketball. So He leads the world in scoring while he's a poor three point And, a poor free throw shooter, And. The second is more inexcusable because they're called free throws for a reason. They are free shots from 15 feet. Unguarded And, Michael Jordan made 84% career from the free throw line. LeBron's at 74%. Larry Bird shot 89% for his career. 'cause they're called free throws. Look how many points LeBron has left On the table over the years.

12 (2h 43m 46s):
So, That debate ended long ago. And, yet, I, I remind you, we've seen back to back Denver series, LA Denver series, in which in fourth quarters, LeBron has been more pathetic than ever. No

3 (2h 44m 1s):
Clutch gene.

12 (2h 44m 2s):
Yeah. No clutch. Gene lacks the clutch.

3 (2h 44m 4s):
What is the clutch gene?

12 (2h 44m 6s):
It's being able to, to take And, make the shot at the moment to win the game.

3 (2h 44m 12s):
And Jordan obviously had the clutch gene.

12 (2h 44m 14s):
The greatest ever.

3 (2h 44m 15s):
LeBron No clutch Gene. What about LeBron's other titles? What about Cleveland Deli Deli carried him

12 (2h 44m 22s):
We? No. I mean, LeBron's a great player. I mean, he's, he's obviously a very gifted passer, And, And all around player. But He needs somebody else to take And. Make the Kyrie shot. That won Game seven at Oakland. Right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

3 (2h 44m 36s):
So here's, here's an interesting thought experiment. We're not got do LeBron versus MJ one, On one right now. But what about mj right now? How old is He? Is He 55 60? He's,

0 (2h 44m 47s):
No, He is old. His 50th birthday was, he's

12 (2h 44m 50s):
Like 50. I'm not sure.

0 (2h 44m 51s):
Oh, no. He might have his 60th

12 (2h 44m 52s):
Birthday. Yeah, I think, I think might You're

3 (2h 44m 53s):
Right. Might might bet around might 64.

12 (2h 44m 55s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 44m 55s):
Yeah. Let's just say Michael Jordan right now. Okay. I believe he's

0 (2h 44m 58s):
64. Let's see. 61.

3 (2h 44m 60s):
61. 61-year-old Michael Jordan. One, one-on-one against Bronny. Who wins. That's,

12 (2h 45m 7s):
That's amazing. Fascinating. Yeah. Mike would just out intangible him. And, excuse me, intangible him. He would out trash talk him. And. By the way, I love Bronny because They raised him. Right? And, he's such a great kid. And We.

0 (2h 45m 25s):
LeBron's a very good father. Hey. Yeah. Come On, He He. You Can. See It. Hey.

12 (2h 45m 29s):
Yeah. You, you Can it's manifested itself in number one son. I mean, what, what a great kid JJ Reddick keeps saying. He's so coachable. And. Yet it's, it's ripping my guts out to watch Bronny through the Summer League when He didn't even belong in Summer League, let alone G League And. Now, I kept saying, okay, maybe when he's alongside his father, it'll bring out the best in Bronny. 'cause He got raised around all the superstars. Maybe he'll rise to That occasion. So now I've seen 14, 13 minute stints in two preseason games. And And, it's Summer League all over again. Yeah. I've seen him make one basket late And the First game. That He played a little left-handed layup And.

12 (2h 46m 11s):
I'm like, really? Then I watch him again. On the night. That He actually is sharing the floor floor with his father for the First time ever. And He plays 14 minutes. And He turns It over four times. And He scores zero points. And. I'm saying I I don't know if He Can play. I seriously, so It It, it's everything LeBron has lasted for was to play with his son And. What if his son just can't hack It? Yeah. What, what, what if He just He doesn't deserve any minutes with the big league team? And. I know LeBron We enough to tell you it's beneath the family's dignity for Bronny James to play in the G League for the South Bay Lakers.

12 (2h 46m 51s):
I don't think They want That. Yeah. Because it's disgraceful. Like it's, it's below who They their, their stature That they've earned.

3 (2h 46m 58s):
Yeah. I think it's a very cool moment though. For for sure, bro. Son, it's a great story. Okay.

12 (2h 47m 2s):
It's a great story. And are They got

3 (2h 47m 3s):
Manage It for a season. Yeah.

12 (2h 47m 5s):
Okay, then what? Yeah. Can the kid back. It up. Yeah. What if he's getting 10 minutes a night? And, That kid, max Christie, who's starting to come along. We, what if, what if he's going to JJ saying, seriously, what if all of a sudden, Jared, Vanderbilt, Or, Or, any of the guys Cam reddish down the bench, they're, they're going to JJ saying, you, you, you got stop this. It's insanity. You just can't play. Then what happens? Does It start to tear the team apart?

0 (2h 47m 33s):
Yeah. No, it's a fair question. Yeah. It's a fair question. We, I have one La Or, a couple last questions here. 'cause I know you, you're got do something else in the office. One question is, when you were in Bristol, you, you basically renovated a hotel room. And got

12 (2h 47m 50s):
I did.

0 (2h 47m 50s):
Is That, right? And. You got a satellite On top You I did explain this because this is like, I, I'm, I'm obsessed about making sure I Can watch all the games. But this is to another level.

12 (2h 47m 60s):
Okay. So They moved our show from New York to Bristol And. I had met my wife. Stein We weren't husband And wife, but We were together. We were living together in Manhattan. She had a great job in Manhattan. All of a sudden, I got go to the mothership two hours away, up into Central Connecticut. And. I realized the First day I was there as I stayed in the Residence Inn, which is in Southington, Connecticut, just down the street from Bristol, ESPN. I really liked It. So why would I buy a place if, if they'll pick up the tab? And They said, sure. We'll, you, you, you could stay there as long as you, as long as like 365.

12 (2h 48m 42s):
I'll do It. Done. So, I, I made It my home away from home. And, They loved me so much. They took care of me. I was their, almost like their child. Upstairs. I was On the top floor. They. They let me have a satellite dish installed right outside my window. On the top floor of the Residence Inn. That's amazing. I bought my own furniture. I got my own exercise equipment into the room. It was a great room. And. it was some of the most fun I ever had because They came in. And cleaned every day. Yeah. Nice. And, They, They gave me fresh towels every day. Right. I loved It. It. It was some of the happiest days, of course, career wise. Yeah. Yeah. It was the happiest time. All

3 (2h 49m 21s):
That's incredible though, getting a That. That's

12 (2h 49m 23s):
The residents. it And. So, I would go back to New York On Friday afternoon And bet with Ernestine And. Yet she started to like It so much. She started taking my car service car up to Bristol for the weekend. And do a reverse trip where she would stay with me at the Residence Inn because she enjoyed the people And. They're just good, good folks, miss.

3 (2h 49m 42s):
It's nice. Still a vacation from Manhattan. Like I, yeah. I work in Manhattan Monday through Friday. Then I leave to get outta the city. Go. I go to Bris. Beautiful Brist that's in Connecticut in go to Lake Compounds, water Park, And Watch Museum.

12 (2h 49m 53s):
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I missed That's

3 (2h 49m 55s):
Magical place. Yeah. Incredible. Big Cat alluded to It earlier, but have you, have you ever had the occasion to cross paths with Charles Barkley? Yeah. See, He has said, He wants to kick your ass. No,

12 (2h 50m 5s):
He said way more than That. He wants He said, He wants to kill you. Kill, kill you.

3 (2h 50m 8s):
K word. I think He said On. The Dan Patrick show. He said, if I'm ever diagnosed with like a, a life-threatening illness, He just invite Skip Baylis On the show. So I Can kill him. On live tv. Yeah. So you've never got, got a chance to meet him.

12 (2h 50m 22s):
This is the closest I got. But I'm pretty sure this wasn't the genesis of all this, because I was just a columnist in Dallas, Texas for the Dallas Morning News. Or, maybe the Times Herald at this point, Spud Webb. Then Big NBA star won the slam dunk contest. Good friend of mine, players honored him. And respected And so much. That He would put On a big all-star game every summer in Dallas. And, everybody would come. Magic would come, bird would come, Charles Barkley would come. And. Occasionally I was asked to bet a celebrity coach of a team, but I would actually have to make substitutions with the players. So one year Charles was On my team.

12 (2h 51m 5s):
I tried to introduce myself to Charles before the game. And. He was uninterested in whoever the hell I was And. Yet I, I did have to take him in And out of the game. So, true story. Near the end of the game, I leaned over And, said, Charles, you wanna go back in? I'd, I'd like to try to win the game. And He said, brother, I wanna win the game too, but my shit hurts And. I'm like, okay, fine. And. I put somebody else in And. it was, who was the shoot? I just went blank. On, the Kentucky, the white kid shooter. Rex Chapman. Rex Chapman. So I put Rex Chapman in And place of Charles And. Rex Chapman hit the game winner.

12 (2h 51m 46s):
That's a true story. So,

3 (2h 51m 47s):
Sony Cuco, Scottie

12 (2h 51m 48s):
Pipman. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It was bingo. So That was as close as I ever got to Charles And. Then as soon as I started doing this And That for ESPN in the early two thousands, He started On his tirades against me. On, back in the day, Leno And Letterman And Dan Patrick And. I, I have no idea. But It got so bad. That my wife, Ernestine And her mother, God rest her soul when she was alive, started to take It very personally. Because there point to me was there might bet one psycho out there who listens to Charles And idolizes. Charles And decides to do Charles's bidding.

12 (2h 52m 30s):
And take you out. So you've got figure out some way to get him to stop using the K word word He could rip And slash all He wants, I don't care. He And. I used to publicly thank Charles. 'cause He He hung On. Every word I said, On television, And. I appreciated That He was our most loyal fan of our show. But I finally went On my podcast a year And a half ago, And And just beseeched him to please stop using the K word just for the sake of my wife And. Her mom And did He And. I'm pretty sure He has, I don't like Monitor It. Yeah. Yeah. On a daily basis. But you're off the keyboard. That's good. Yeah. I think He quit the keyboard.

3 (2h 53m 8s):
Yeah, that's good. Yeah. That's, yeah. Maybe one day. We Can bury the hatchet between you two. Okay. Because you're right, It sounds like He does. Listen to what you say. Yeah. He gets mad at

12 (2h 53m 14s):
It. I, I I have no idea. I I don't Get what his issue is with me. And. Yet We would have Kenny Smith On had him On a couple times. On First, take And. He would always say, you, you guys are too much alike. And, I'd bet like me, And Charles are alike. But He said, just opinion wise, He wants his opinion to bet the opinion. And, He hears yours. And, maybe He thinks, God, I wish I'd thought of That, Or, whatever. Maybe there's some jealousy, Or resentment. I don't know. But I got nothing against Charles whatsoever.

3 (2h 53m 43s):
Yeah. I, I think people will ask us, because On Wednesday's episode, our guest was Troy Aikman. So He was just On. Where are We at with Troy? Are things bet? Are things worse? Have We

12 (2h 53m 53s):
Have We got to get in in touch. We're friendly He about my book. That, I wrote.

3 (2h 53m 58s):
Yeah. Did you, did you imply Or? Did you say He was gay in

12 (2h 54m 2s):
The book? I did not say you didn't read It. I, I

3 (2h 54m 4s):
Didn't know. No, I don't know. We don't read.

12 (2h 54m 6s):
I understand And. I respect And. Appreciate. Thank you for respecting That. If you, if you had read Yes, my book, you would love the way I portrayed Trey Troy in my book. Because Troy was the hero of That book. I liked my portrayal of him. That. I signed a book, And Hand delivered It, the very First copy of my book to Troy On, the It would bet the camp practice field at St. Edwards University in Austin, Texas. First day of camp practice ended. I took my book up. And gave It to him. And, I was shocked. That originally, He did not like It. But We have come back around. And, he's been nothing but great to me. And We, text And.

12 (2h 54m 47s):
I did catch your show with him. And. I thought He was great. Yeah. He was And. He did It because He loves Joe. Buck like a brother. And. Joe loves you guys. And loves being On. Your show And. So It was clear to me. He was cool with you because you're so cool with Joe. Yeah,

0 (2h 55m 3s):
Yeah. Alright, so I had one last question. This has been great. Skip We. Really appreciate you coming in.

Rollback (2h 55m 8s):

Why did He say Super Bowl? Because the night before the Super Bowl I stayed. What happened in, In Hank's extra bed? Yeah. Super. Because I was Super Bowl. I was too drunk to get back to Your room. Correct. Which was down the hall. No, That was when I was And. You didn't sleep. On the bed. You slept. On the couch. Even though there was an extra bed. That's true. Was all super. I Don't And your puke shirt. And my puke Shirt. And your, yeah. And. The pants. The pants. No, the pants. You put On the next day. Yeah. I think the pants were And. You Lost your phone. I Did lose And. One thing about you is That. You could beat the fuck outta Hank We. Don't have to talk about That loss. We already talked about enough losses Today. What? What loss was That If I looked at the tweet, I have It right here. Do you want me to say? Yeah. Okay. So this is Fire Fest. Let's talk about 2022 Phillies Blow World Series. After two one series lead also They got no hit in That World Series. Yep. 2023. The union lose in overtime. The Eagles blows. Second half lead in the Super Bowl. That's what It was. Okay. Yeah.

Hank, that's your only fire fest is That. You don't know how to get here. On Sunday We. I was, I was also upset about, you know, everyone, everyone hating On, me And, everyone saying, I don't care. And, And, And. You know, just all the hate online. And. Then I watched the, the NBA starting five documentary. Current guest, Joe Missoula was one of the talking heads. On It wearing the Boston And Barcel hat. Love to see It best friend, And They asked him about like, Tatum dealing with hate. And He. His response was very Missoula esque. He was like, you mean He gets to deal with It? Oh, that's what you want. Also, You're just like, Jason, you wanna bet in That situation where you're, where you're getting the hate, you're, you know, On one of the best teams. Like that's what's got happen, man in the arena. He gets the privilege. Yeah. And That, you know, gave me perspective. I also would like to come to Hank's defense here. We've been doing this show for a very long time. I think the beauty of the show is That. We're not all the same. And. PFC, And, I obviously are obsessed with football. Hank maybe not obsessed with all things football, but that's the beauty of It. We have a guy who maybe not obsessed with all football. We have a dog in the booth. We have a guy who's angry trying to actively do a mutiny. And. We have a big baby. That won't talk about his teams anymore. We're From all different. Who also hate Dogs. Yeah. We're from just different, I'm talking, I'm just saying That. They're bad. We're just different. We're different people. That's the beauty of the show. Yeah. It can't, We can't all bet the same. That would suck. So Max, what? What We can't have you do. We can't have you turn to Hank. Where after a loss, you just don't talk. That would bet the Worst. Oh, We already talked about It at the

I got It fixed after It had started to heal. I never got the entire surgery. On, It, the doctor just basically put a rod up my nose. And then punched It back into place as best That He could. But I think it's getting more broken. Mm. As I Get older, you know how like people That Get, old They, their face becomes more of whatever It was, like their features Get more and more exaggerated. Yeah. I think That, my nose is slowly migrating over to the side of my face. Oh. As I Get older.
