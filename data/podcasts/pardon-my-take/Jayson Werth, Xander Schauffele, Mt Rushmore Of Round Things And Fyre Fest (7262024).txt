For us, golf is simple. It's a chance to get out and have some fun with our friends, but inevitably little things have a way of ruining it. The group ahead is taking forever. You can't find the fairway with a map, and the bev cart is nowhere to be found.

Make sure to grab the new Fireball Birdie Shot Club. It's literally a golf club filled with Fireball. Nip, put it in your bag. It'll fit right in that side pocket. Drink Fireball nips and have a great time on the golf course.


On today's part of my take, we've got a twofer for the people. We've got an awesome interview with Jason Wirth in person. MLB legend won a championship with the Philadelphia Phillies. Kind of won a championship with the Nats. Basically Won Did No, he basically did. Yeah, kinda did. Did not. Which team? Retired. Had a, had a ceremony for him to put him in the Ring of Honor. What did you say? Which team put him in the Ring of Honor? Well, your, Your franchise is like five Years old. No, I just think that, I think that's interesting. Also, it's the Montreal Expos, which goes back a very long time. But that's fine. So we have a great interview with Jason Wirth. We have a great interview with Xander Schley Open champion. Now good friend of the show.

Just five bucks only on DraftKings. The Crown is yours. Today is Friday, July 26. Is there anything you'd like to say to me? Big, Cat and Max? Uhh. And to Hank who's not here, What? Happy Uncle's day. Happy Uncle's Day. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yes, appreciate it. Happy Uncle's day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I also an uncle. Oh, happy Uncle's Day. Big. Cat. Thank you. So I should say to myself, happy Uncle's Day. Yep. Huey, are you an uncle? Nope. Okay, so you're out memes, are you an uncle? I Am, yeah.


Happy Uncle's day, man. Happy Uncle's day. Happy Uncle's day. Hank is not here. We are actually on vacation next week, but we still have all the shows. So next week's schedule, Sunday PFT and I will be in Studio Max and Hank will be on a much deserved vacation. Wednesday will be the take, which are phenomenal. Fired up. 28 take I think we're giving out. And then Friday we will have a very, very special guest and we'll be doing a Zoom show. And then we're off to Grit week. I'm very excited about what this, this next like week and a half has in store. Yes, now it is. We are on vacation next week. But to Hank's defense, it's Wednesday of the week before vacation.


Yeah, he, So he left Wednesday, but that's fine. He did do the Mount Rushmore with us. So we taped a couple, we taped three Mount Rushmores that, so we'll all be participating. But yeah, Hank when we were like, Hey, we're gonna take a vacation last week of July, he is like, great. I'll go the second to last week. End of Last week, summer. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. He Deserves it. He's had a tough summer, Which speaking of it's such a shame, Hank's not here because boys, I think, I don't listen. We've been doing this a long time. A lot of the things that we talk about here are from other shows or we we're not claiming, you know, Mount Rushmore. We love doing Mount Rushmore season. Obviously it was a joke when we're like, yeah, we invented Mount Rushmore season.


We did not invent Mount Rushmore season. There's a lot of things out there that we are part of, but we don't take credit for inventing stuff because everyone's got ideas. Everyone's doing different things. I do think we had a part in Jason Tatum or a conversation becoming mainstream. Yes. The Jason Tatum conversation has reached its apex. Stephen A. Smith put out a podcast yesterday and he titled it, you know, you're doing the, the rundown of what the podcast is gonna be featuring. Yep. Here's how he described his podcast. Another horrifying police shooting. Does Tatum lack aura? Ooh. So we're gonna get to the bottom May. Maybe both those things at the same time. Yeah. And So Carmella Anthony also came out and said that Jason t will never be the face of the league. 'cause he lacks Aura.


Anthony Edwards has Aura. I'm actually good on it. I don't think we, I I, I'm, I'm good on the discussion. I'm like, we, we settled it a long time ago. It just was interesting that it's now become like an actual thing that people, the fodder in the middle of July, That's what you got. It is Mount Rushmore season, which we invented as Big Cat said earlier. Correct. But this is, this is an interesting conversation because it's like it's undefinable. Yeah. You can just say like, whether or not you like the guy or not. Correct. And we also began this whole conversation 100% just to piss Hank Off. Yeah. I mean everything. Because I don't even know what aura means. Everything we've said about Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown to a certain extent has been just to piss Hank off.


Yeah. If Hank wasn't here, we'd be like, those guys are fucking awesome. They're probably gonna win multiple championships. And who the hell cares? Who like gets the MVP and who has the aura? All that matters is winning. But Hank is usually sitting here. Yeah. So we have to say they probably hate each other and Jason Tatum has no aura. But Also to your point, they in those two questions, Jalen Brown has both those things. Yeah, he does have a lot of Aura. And the Mvp, he's got, he's got Aura. He actually has overflow of Aura Plus a thousand Aura. Yeah. What do you, what would you say If, you were to do like statistics on Jason Tatum's Aura? I'd say he is like negative six 50. Yeah, that sounds about right. I was gonna go like minus nine war.


Yeah. Aura. Yeah. War Chase. Jalen Brown's like a plus 28 Aura. Yeah. That's the guy. It's hard to replicate. Yeah. Alright, so the other things we have going on, it is training camp. So we are starting to get some of the training camp news. We had Jim Harbaugh welcome everyone to training camp in their new facility. The Bolt, which looks incredible Inspired by Lightning. Yep. It Looks awesome. He said training camp feels like being born. It feels like coming out of a womb. It's comfortable. And then poof, you're born, the lights are on, people are looking at you. Yeah. I mean, being born is a lot like training camp for sure. You put your head down, you hit the hole. You just need 10 centimeters of daylight and then you explode.


And Harbaugh, I feel like he hears the word labor and he thinks hard work. Yeah. So he is like, yeah, that's what, that's what training camp is. It's work. It's giving birth. I wouldn't be shocked if Harbaugh maybe also gives his players some, you know, breast milk. Oh yeah. Just being like, Hey, we gotta get, we gotta build stronger, stronger bones. What's like the, the pre-cum of breast milk? The liquid gold stuff? I don't know The stuff that bodybuilders take. Oh, I don't Know. It's like a special type of highly concentrated breast milk. I'm sure that Harbaugh's got place Placenta Shooting that up. Yeah. Three yards in a cloud of placenta. That's his offensive shit. Yeah. I always get placenta and paella confused and they're very different. Extremely. Especially the taste Placenta's delicious. Yeah. Yeah.


We had also in Cardinal's camp, did you see this? Jonathan Gannon? No. We joke about Jonathan Gannon, but this one had me thinking like he might be in trouble because, and he was kind of being funny, but he said that he and several staff members did a deep dive on the concept of momentum, apparently going back to wars in the 18 hundreds. Okay. And after all the research, when he was asked about it, if momentum exists, he said perhaps, I have no idea. That's great. That's great. So he did an exhaustive research study on it Wars. And it's undefined anytime A football coach comes back from, from summer for training camp.


Been like, I've been looking at some wars. Except for the Browns offensive line coach being like, the troops didn't stretch before they invaded the beach at Normandy. Yeah. Bob Wiley. It's, it is interesting though that he, he is like trying to figure out whether or not momentum is real by doing a scientific study on momentum. Just Ask a sports fan. Just, It might as well just be vibes. Yeah. Like vibes are, vibes are real. Ask A gambler vibes. They're sitting there and watching a game and they feel it going bad. That's momentum. Like I can tell you when a team that's winning is gonna lose the game. Yeah. It's, it's like when they, It's usually when they have a black bird that's on the side of their head and they play in Georgia. Yeah. The, the, it it, it's, it like 10 years ago, 15 years ago when there was that whole discussion like, clutch actually doesn't exist. And like, nah, we've been watching sports a long time.


Clutch 100% exists. It definitely exists. Like there's no way to explain how some people are just better and like rise to the occasion and other people don't. Isn't momentum also clearly defined by Isaac Newton? Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's one of the laws. He's the one Who said momentum is your next day starting pitcher. Yeah. He said first he said, what the fuck is this apple doing? Falling on my head? And ow. Yeah. And then he said, yeah, I don't know if, if I can pinch it for Derek Jeter. Yeah. Yeah. So momentum's real. It's definitely real. And, and also in sports, like vibes are a hundred percent a thing. And war I think they call it, what do they call it? Just when your team's down the, it's a French term, the spirit, the corps or something like that.


Okay. If you, if your army's pissed off and they're lazy and they don't want to go fight, they're gonna get their ass kicked. Yeah. So if you're getting your ass kicked, then that means you're more likely to get your ass kicked. Yeah, Exactly. Other training camp notes I wrote down for you, Dan Campbell has the biggest podium ever. Yeah. I love that they built that for him. They basically built a podium so big that he can't break it with his hands. 'cause I think they were probably nervous that if he gets upset and he like pounds his fist, he'll break the podium. It's a solid podium. It's An indestructible podium. I, I like it's the unsinkable podium. It's Titanic. I like it with Dan Gamble. I would love it if it was like Mike McDaniel behind that giant podium. Yeah. Because it would just be so funny because of how big it would be, how small he would be.


He'd get lost. I I think that might be podium of the year for next year. Yeah. It's just, it is. We we should have put that into the take. He, but it came too late. Lincoln Riley said he's coming quickly. They're coming quickly. It was, think about baseball. Weird. Seeing, seeing like all USC and UCLA and Oregon and Washington, the big 10 media day. We got a lot of media days going on. What Was the context behind we're coming quickly. I think it was talking about like, are they going to orgasm? Okay. Yeah. That's unusual for someone who represents the Trojans to say that. Yeah. Usually that's Lazy. It takes a while. Yeah. Yeah. But maybe rib for her, his pleasure, His pleasure on the inside. Yeah. But, and then the, I I think that was all the training camp.


Oh, we had our first training camp Fight chiefs. No, no. Oh, incorrect. First training camp fight was the Houston Texans. Oh. Which I think we said on the show the nf, the A FC South was gonna be the first Yeah. They always the fight. And the Chiefs had one too. Chiefs had One as well. Interesting. I saw the Jerry Jones talk today. What'd he say? He addressed the media Ai. Jerry Jones or real Jerry Jones. Real, real. Jerry Jones. Not dead. Jerry Jones. Okay. He said he was talking about the, the DAK extension and the CD lamb extensions that he is working on. And then he compared himself to Patrick Mahomes. He said, If, you have an option quarterback like Patrick Mahomes famous option quarterback that we all know. Yep. You wanna wait to make your decision until the defense gets up on you and then you can make your choice.


Huh. And he also said he's all in, he's more all in than he is ever been. Oh. So he is like way, because He's been very all in. He Is balls deep in He's Been all in every single year for the last 20 years to n nothing to show for It. Well, he's been also, he's been distracted recently, shall we say, with his paternity lawsuit. Oh yeah. What ended up happening is he the father? I I don't think he's well either. He's the dad and doesn't have to pay for it, or he is not the dad. Got it. So he's saying because he doesn't have those distractions, he's gonna be able to commit a hundred percent of his time to the team to being all in, which is apparently a good thing in his mind. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want him all In No. You want just the tip. Yep. How mad would you be if the Cowboys got actually good Max?


Would that like, 'cause it, it's, it's kind of a fascinating thing to think about because the Cowboys have not been a threat, an actual threat in a long time. I know that they have had good seasons. They've won a couple playoff games, but they have not been to an NFC championship game since the nineties. Correct. 1996. Right. So, well, I don't know about Yeah, that sounds right. Yeah. That's when they won their last Super Bowl. Yeah. So would it, would it destroy you? I don't know. I got one more year. No nfcs team ever goes back to back. So I'm, I'm, I'm good for this year. You need this, you need this year. Right? P ft. Yeah. No, We just trade off. Yeah. Everyone trades since 2006. I think. It's crazy.


Haven't had a back to back champ. So the Cowboys can't win it. Win the nfcs This year. They can't take them off your list. Take Off your list. Off your list. Not gonna happen. Not gonna happen. Yeah. And the commanders are gonna rise up and, and we're gonna dominate 'em. It's gonna be great. Nothing's ever gonna hurt again. Yeah. Baseball news. So what was the clip that you just showed? The, the Colorado Rockies since 2004 is the last time the nfcs had back to back champions. This was a very funny clip because it was, it was a Red Sox Rockies and the relief pitcher yelled at the, the batter. Yeah. You jerked off in a parking lot. Who was the batter?


I don't know. But I looked up and he did in fact jerk off in a parking lot. Was it killing Winslow? It's, it was, it's one of those ones that you just hope never becomes a viral clip because I didn't know who that guy was. And then I looked it up and I was like, oh, he did jerk off in a parking lot. That's, that's gotta suck going to the ballpark every day being like, someone might say I jerked off in a parking lot and they wouldn't be wrong. And, and it probably didn't happen that much until this pitcher said it. And it was clearly caught on camera. By the way, shout out Bruce McGuire. Shout Out to whoever did the lip reading for it. Yes. Because you did America a wonderful service. Now every fan is going to know. That's the guy that jerked off in a parking Lot. I did not know until that moment. Is it Reese McGuire? Yes. Yeah. Reese McGuire.


He jerked off in a parking lot Confirmed by this Picture. And I think it was, who was the pitcher who yelled it? It was T Troll. Yeah. Cal Quare. There We go. Huey. I Love how you said that. Yeah, I do too. I also, yeah, Reese McGuire. He, he jerked off in a parking Lot. That's interesting. I, the other baseball thing I wanted to talk about real quick, and this is, we don't have memes of Mets fan, but the Yankees, I saw our good friend Tommy smokes this morning. And I've known Tommy now for seven years. And I think for every single moment of those seven years I've seen him tweet, this is the game that Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone are getting fired.


Yet the Yankees will never fire either of those guys. And Aaron Boone even said, after getting killed by the Mets, I think they got swept by the Mets this, this season. He said, one of the things I really liked tonight was how hooked up we were in the dugout in the eighth and ninth inning. I'm not worried about the compete level with these guys. This is talking about a game where they lost like 12 to three, I believe. So I don't know what it is with the Yankees, but these guys stink and they like the, I'm talking about Aaron Boone and Brian Cashman, and they're never getting rid of 'em as a two week Yankee fan. I think, What was the two week Yankee fan thing by the way? I Explain that I was Sold on the, the, the, the the high class and the high.


Oh no, the History, the pin stripes. The, The pinstripe, the Derek Jeters Of the world. When was the two weeks, The first two weeks of the season. Okay. So they were hot coming out the gate. They looked good. And then I stopped Karen. Yeah. And then they started to kind of took Aup, a couple slumps and bumps. But at the end of the day, I think Cashman and Boone are, you know, they're gonna always be on the hot seat. And at the end of the day, the team, you know, it's not even that horrible. We have a two week exit. I, IIII generally think, But you Said they're Gonna be all right. You said once you stopped caring about 'em, then they went to a slump. You, you have to start caring about 'em again. Well, I've, I've, I've, I've, this is what I have to do for that team to, to be great. I, I, I'll walk for them to run. I like how Brian Cashman, how they, they got off to hot start.


You're right. But his strategy is basically sign the best players and pay them the most money. Yeah. Which isn't really the mark of a good general manager. It's just a general manager that's got a rich dad. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, so Hugh, you are, you are a football and a basketball guy. You're not really a baseball guy. Just this season you were like, I'm gonna give this Yankee thing a shot. Yeah. Like I, I, I was watching the playoffs last year and you know, I got kind of sold on like baseball and then Oh, you were not sold on baseball until last year. Yeah. Yeah. It took took last season to kind of be like, oh, this thing, you know, because it moved faster. Okay. What, What about the Yankees in the postseason sold you on the Yankees? Not last, But it was the, the potential Okay. Of like, well look at what this team is in the regular season. Imagine if they're good and, you know, it matters when they're playing.


How, how much baseball had you watched the previous 25 years of your life? Four months. Maybe Four months. Like A game here, A game there. You know, It's Very specific. Wait, four months, cumulative Four months. Yeah. Like if I had to, That's a lot of games, but That's not like 24 7. That's just like a a a day here day There a game here. A game There. Okay. And then two week Yankee fan. And Then two weeks I was, I was watching every game for two weeks. And you just stopped. No, I didn't. I watched every single game. And then you just stopped. And then I Was like, this, what am I doing? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Two week Yankee fan. Yeah. The, the Yankees. I know that their fans are really, really pissed off, but I don't, I think that there's a solution to this. I think that you have to give Aaron Boone an extension and show that you believe in him.


Yeah. And then the rest of the the clubhouse is gonna truly believe in him too. Then you'll be fine. You might, you might have a lame duck otherwise. Yeah, exactly. He kind of is a lame duck. Right. I think he's got like a, he's got a club option for next year. So you gotta do it. So you gotta do it. Extend Aaron Boone, I got a question for you. The Olympics started, how are we doing in rugby? So right now we're waiting for the quarterfinals. We made it to the knockout stage and the US is playing Australia. We won. So Australia good. Yeah, they're very good. Shit. They're probably gonna win. We won a game. Lost a game. Tied a game. Oh, that's Perfect For us. Yeah. And we finished, I believe second in our group, which means that we kind of won. So we moved on to the, the knockout stage. I think, I don't know, I think, I don't wanna make any predictions 'cause we're watching the games right now, but I like both Fiji and Ireland.


Whoever wins this game, I think is gonna win it. Oh yeah. Okay. But it's been, it's been awesome to watch. Like the whole office has been watching sevens and I wish that it had more of a Prime time spot. I wish that it wasn't, I wish It was happening during the Olympics. I wish it wasn't the appetizer for the Olympics. Right. Like, this deserves get this, get this in like a, a Friday night, Saturday night. Right. I don't understand. Oh, by the way, you got the Nationals got no hit today. Yeah, we did. And you know what thing about me guy like me, when we get no hit, I say that we got no hit. Yeah. We got no hit by sea. Whoa. One guy, one guy threw It. Yeah, but they, well no, but they got no hits. We got no hit. Remember when You think About me, what happened? Yours? What happened in yours? Did you get any hits?


Okay. Exactly. Big down. Boy. That's, That's, That's, that's basically we just took out the newspaper and we just kind of held it over the dog's sout. And he is just like, all right, I'm gonna lay down. That's What we call accountability Max. That's as close as you'll get to Max admitting it by the way. It's just, he's Just slinking back. Yeah. He shrunk. Like, I'm gonna, he did. We've had this argument for two years now and he just didn't see the Well, how did you guys get a hit? Yeah. Question coming. Never saw that part coming. It was Dylan cease. Yeah, Dylan cease. Fantastic. Yeah. I'm I Baseball. I tried to, I tried to give, I was basically like all star breaks a nice reset.


The Cubs have been bad and I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give my all for this next week to see if the Cubs can maybe win a few games and get back in this. I went on Monday night. They're so bad. Their foul balls are bad. They don't even hit foul balls. Well, Like not good contact. Is that what you Correct. They suck at hitting the baseball. So when they very important part of baseball. That's Probably the most important part. Yeah. Well, no, they're really good at pitching the baseball. They're just really bad at hitting the baseball. Hitting the baseball is important. Especially when you pitch the baseball. Well, all you need to do is hit the baseball a little bit and they can't even do that. Ideally you'd like to combine the two. Yeah.


It's also So boring. It's boring. That's the thing. Like watching the Cubs play Is so boring. They don't have like, they don't have anything. I I, I've said it a million times. I like when, when we talked about with Aaron Rogers. Oh, what? The Cubs or the Bears? No, no, no. They've grown up into the Bears. No, they won. They want, they won in 2016. Oh No, I'm saying like they their style of play. Oh, right now. Yeah. They're, they're, yeah. They're, they're solid play. But they have not historically. I mean, yeah, they're not good historically, but they did win in the last decade when we were talking to Aaron Rogers about how often guys think about the Roman Empire and how that whole meme started and everyone's like, ask your boyfriend how often he thinks about the Roman Empire.


For me, it's how often I think about Kyle Schwarber still being on the cups. Yeah. That's a almost daily occurrence for me. He's in my brain. He's such a joy to root for. If you're gonna have a, a team that even if it's not that good, having schwarber on the team is just so much fun. Just one, having a big boy that steps up to the plate and mashes One bat. That would make the other pitcher not be like, oh, I'm fine. This is an easy out. That'd be so sick to root for him. Shut up. He also wouldn't tolerate other guys not hitting the ball well. Right. He'd just be like, dude, just do what I do. Just mash Just spank a ball. He'd be Yeah. He'd be pissed off the Cubs in the last, let's see, in the last six games, two runs, zero runs, two runs, three runs, zero runs, two runs.


That's bad. It's really bad. It's boring baseball. And they don't give up runs. So it's like every loss is a three two loss or a two one loss. It's brutal. It It, it's kinda the same in every sport where you'd, if your team's gonna be bad or, or mediocre. You'd rather it be the opposite where they're great on offense. Correct. Defense stinks. Play Softball games. Yeah. Just because you can have fun watching the game. Correct. There's a lot going on. Correct there. I saw a stat the other day. This is back to football real quick. I think the Dan Lebatard show pointed this out, but I wanted to make memes aware of it. Memes, do you know that the, the Indianapolis Colts have more a FC titles than the New York jets do. Wow. Yeah. That was going ffc that was going around this season.


Yeah. A Ffc memes I stand with you. Don't let them do shame statistics. No, I'm shame. Statistics are the lamest thing. You can Do I Thought you guys saw it earlier in the year. No. And we're gonna bring it up, but I would never bring that up. Memes. I've, I fucking live. All I have to deal with every single day is insult stats. Yeah. We gotta stick together. Yeah. Insult stats are not cool. We just gotta turn the insult stats on the Patriots Though. See, see something, say something If. you see someone using an insult stat. Insult them back. I kinda like using 'em on the Patriots though. You can use 'em on a, on the Chiefs Patriots. Any team that's won more than two Super Bowls in the last 20 years, I'd Say. Yeah. Well 'cause then they have something to defend. Yeah. Like I don't have, when people, the insults were about to get to the time of year where the bears not having a 3000 yard passer or what?


4,000? I can't even remember. 4,000, 4,030. It's 30 touchdowns. 4,000 that's gonna start going everywhere. Yeah. And so insults stats suck. Yeah. They're back. They're not, they're not nice. Alright. Before we do Mount Rushmore and Hank is involved in this, I wanted to do one thing. PFDI told you this. I we were, I was gonna save this for you. I got talking to QE the other day and our boy Huey's working on a script. Okay. And I want you to hear the script 'cause I think we need to make the pilot for this. Okay. Okay. So Huey, the floor is yours. How long have you been working on this script? Technically speaking about six months. Okay.


And how many pages do we have? One. Okay. Okay. When you say technically, what does that mean? I Started it six months ago. Okay. And I did one page. Okay. That, that day. Oh, so it all one day. Yeah. I've gone back and edited. They kind of, you know, edited some lines, take, added some subscriptions and stuff. But that page edit Six months Subscriptions. Descriptions. Descriptions. Descriptions. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. You're a perfectionist it sounds like. Yeah, yeah. Want want it to be realistic? Wanted it to, you know, make you be able to, you know, believe that you're in the story. Okay. So, So what was the inspiration for the script? Basketball? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So go ahead. Tell him, tell him, tell him what the, you know, pitch is. Alright. So show's called High Up in the Mountains. It's about two brothers.


One looks very similar to me. The other inspir, the inspiration behind the other one is by a rapper by the name of Shake. Well, who looks very similar to Max Diante. Oh, okay. But so Shake, well, like a milkshake, like something that you'd see on Yeah, like a, a SlimFast. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's a, he's a big goofy guy. Got it. So it's about two brothers, one named Carmelo, the other Anthony. And they were born two days before he got traded to the Knicks. Okay. And so, you know, that's why their dad not, not the best of guys grew up to resent them, you know. 'cause They live in Denver.


Yeah. They Live in, yeah, they live in Denver. Now. He's gotta be reminded of, you know, he is two shit stain kids. You know, Carmelo and Anthony. Yeah. And, and then long story short, life goes on. Dad starts to meet another woman. They have a kid, that kid, guess what? He names that kid? Tebow. Nicola. Oh. So now there's not enough room for Carmelo and Anthony. So they got, they're getting kicked out. So now the story is, you know, these two, you know, shit brains kind of having to figure out life, you know, on their own high up in the mountains named Carmelo and Anthony. I, I'm in. Yeah. I'm a hundred percent In. We gotta make it. There's not, there's, I, I did point out when I heard this, that that the, the years between Carmel Anthony getting traded from the nuggets to the Knicks and Yoic getting drafted by the nuggets is significant.


So the timeline doesn't add up. So No. Well, it's just, that's more room for the script. Well, YOIC was drafted in 14, and then you gotta think, you know, you add another six, seven years before he starts to like really start to be on the final conversation and MVP and takes a couple six years. So by then, you know, they're pushing 18. Okay. So, you know, it's right on, right on that par right there. So, and then the Carmelo and Anthony resent their baby brother. Yeah. 'cause fucking Cola. Yeah. So do they, do they move to New York? Well, I haven't gotten that for yet. Oh yeah. I'm hoping This is actually a lot of script for just one page. Wait, What do you mean? You haven't gotten that far yet? Because they already in, where you've gotten to Carmelo's already retired. Yeah. No, I mean, like, no.


And in theory, yeah, I haven't written all of this. Right. You've only written one page. Page. But the theory, the direction is this. Right? This is where we're going. The end of the episode is gonna, by the end of the episode, we're gonna have all this laid out and we're gonna have kind of the, the path of, Is this all happening in the first episode? Not all of it, but we're, we're the, the, again, the pilot's going to really have to lay down a lot of like Yeah. What these guys are, their story, you know, and then, you know, them getting kicked out. And then that kind of, where that ends. Right. And then we'll pick up episode two, kind of after. So It's a TV show. So you have like a, a season Yeah. Yeah. Many episodes as it needs I a question. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a time jump in the first Episode? Yeah, there has to.


Well no mean, yeah, there's a, the first little like 30 seconds is like, you know, them as babies, you know, and then it's Carmello and Anthony. And then bang, you know, two days later Camilla gets traded and then it's like, all right. And then it just quick chime, jump. He cuts to these kids, you know, smoking weed in the car Was Oh, so there is a time jump. Yeah. But for like, again, 20 seconds. It's the first like 20. Like you just get introduced to babies. All we're in Present day and then boom. Yeah. Now we're in present day. Yeah. These kids are present day. Yes. Yes. Alright, I got a question. I I don't want to completely PPO your s script here. 'cause I think that that's all right. Maybe we should make it. When Carmelo was, was traded to the New York Knicks, did the father think about just changing their name?


No, no, no, no, no. He signed the birth certificate a couple days earlier. So officially, you know, and again, the dad, what we're gonna find out from father is he's not the brightest. Okay. Okay. And that he's, he's at the end of the day, it, it's more about the reminder of what he did wrong. And he, he kind of blames himself. Okay. So when he named the new baby Nico. Nicola, did he do that right? When Yoic got drafted? Yeah. He did that kind of late, late 2019, you know, As he started to emerge as It was like, this is the guy, he Wasn't gonna make the same mistake again where he named someone. Yeah. He wanted to someone Yeah. Make sure he was committed full time. Yeah. This was, this was gonna be the guy. So we're gonna have to find like a 4-year-old actor for Nicola. Correct? Yeah. Yep. Got it. Okay.


Just wanted to make sure that that's the path that we Were going. Yeah. Yep. A 4-year-old for Nicola Hot mom shithead dad. Yep. And Then, and then two guys that look like you and me. It's gonna Be a hard one. We gotta we gotta figure out how we're gonna find two guys that look just like me and Youi. Okay. It's gonna be difficult. Yeah. So I think we need to make this pilot. Every sitcom needs just a, a wacky neighbor too. Okay. Yeah. Put the wacky neighbor in there. Yeah. We could do, there's a lot of wacky people in this office. Bosco plays Wacky. Yeah. W Wack wacky neighbor is named. Hmm. Jr Jr's, not R Smith. Yeah. I'm trying to think.


Birdman. Birdman. Birdman would be a good, Would be a good one would be good. JaVale. I Was just thinking of like, what would an enemy be to like a A nugget Kobe sauce. Kobe. Yeah, we could, yeah, I could, I could Kobe could live next door. Yeah. Well, he shouldn't be in Colorado. Okay. We'll figure it out. All right. We'll work. Yeah. Yeah. So I wanted you to Hear that. It's a, i we won't make a pilot. We will make a, a sizzle reel. I don't know if we have enough For more than like 45 seconds. It might just be 45 seconds of time jumps. Maybe A short film Make Yeah. Make the entire show outta the montage. Let's just time jump the entire show. Like how so like, just Like every minute.


It's like we don't know where we're are in time. Okay. And also it should have a lot of NBA highlights in it. Yes. Like of Carmelo Anthony and then of Nicole Yoki. It should actually be mostly highlights. Should it be like each year of their life. Yeah. Like each time jump. So then it's just like another year of like Carmelo, you know, doing something great in New York and their dad turning into them, these fucking kids, you know. And then next year it's like, oh, Carmelo Anthony, 2013 Nicks, you know, we got something. Yeah. And he's just reminded of his kids, you know, maybe it's something like that. And they could have like a little robot sidekick named ai. It's got, it's got braids like Alan Iverson. Yeah. I like this. Yeah. Yeah. Because who, who doesn't wanna watch a sitcom about like the mid 2000 tens Nuggets?


Denver, Colorado. Yeah. Yeah. Great time of place. Can you tell me how you came up with this idea? Because you're not a Nuggets fan. No. So my, my theory is a lot. Okay. Your theory of how you came up with this idea. Yeah. Well, it all comes together. I think that like, the best shows I'll ever, ever are like, you know, like Simpsons family guy, office friends, normal people. Yeah. Normal people. Normal environments, normal places. So two, two kind of shit. Stain Kids, Simpson And Family Guy are cartoons. Yeah. But They're family relevance. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Okay. There's, there's a talking dog and family Guy. We're not looking at This specifically.


And, and a talking baby family guy is bad. Bad example. The specifics aren't what matters. It's about the fact it's Family, family, regular people that we can all relate to family. Yeah. We can relate to these. And so you can, Maybe you're not a stoner, but you, you've seen these two and you've seen those types of kids around. And now instead of, you know, it being like a sad existence, I'm so confused. You know, What, what types of kids, You know, stoners. Oh, You know, oh, you, you seen Carmelo and Anthony? I still Oh, yeah, yeah. If. you forgot. I was still looking at the family guy. Me too. No, sorry, I was, I'm moving on. Yeah. But you and those type. But you know, the backstory of that's usually kind of sadder and, you know, it's like little bit more like, yeah. But this is kind of funny, you know, it is just Carmelo and it's Anthony. You know, the resentment doesn't come from like, you know, a fucking divorce or something.


Right. It comes from, you know, You're naming your kids Carmelo Anthony. Yeah. And then you're dumb enough to not like, try to change it, you know? Yeah. It's, it's just, yeah. It's, it's the Look, I don't think this answered the question. It's really a story about life. Yeah. I don't know how I, I was trying To figure out how you decided that the Denver Nuggets would be like the perfect, I I just needed a name that had two first names. Got It. Okay. That's it. I knew that that was gonna be it. That's it. And I Caning else around. No, it all Makes sense. Yeah. And, and weed legal in Colorado. So Oh, Two for two and I went with it. Got it. So you kind of started with just a, anyone who's got two first names and we'll just figure out the rest. We'll Figure out the story. Got it. Yeah. Okay. I like It.


I'm in. Thank you. Yeah. I think I knew you would be, I Think this sounds lucrative. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, do you understand the new NBA deal? It's on every channel now. So they Extended with ESPN Disney, right? Yeah. And then Peacock and NBC. This is what's, this is what deletes are Doing. Amazon, I heard that Amazon's getting, this might be rumor Amazon's gonna get one of the conference finals every couple, every two years on Amazon Prime. This is What the leagues are doing. They're just, they're, they're chopping it up and they're se they're cutting it and they're selling a bunch of NBA to us that we have to buy individually. Yeah. So I wanna know, If, you were to If, you were to be able to watch every NBA game and every NFL game. How much per year does that cost you to be a sports fan?


Right. I feel like that's the real inflation in the United States right now. It's becoming expensive to be a sports fan. It's, they're pricing a lot of people out of watching sports. Yeah. And that shouldn't be right. Yeah. And we should do something about it. And we won't. We won't. But I'm just pay For all the stuff they make us pay for. But I am I, I'd like the record to show that I'm upset about it. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like the record to show that I'm mad. Same Mad. We're mad. I'm Mad as hell and I'm going to keep taking it. Yep. Not gonna do a thing. Yep. Not gonna do a goddamn thing. Okay. Let's get to our Mount Rushmore. Let's do our Mount Rushmore. Then we have Jason Wirth and Xander Schley.

But I was like, pizza is just, listen, I love donuts. I love donuts. But If, you had to, if it's pizza or donuts for the rest of your life, you'd have to take pizza. Yeah, I would agree with that.


Like, I'm just being honest, like I love donuts, but you can't eat donuts every single day. You could eat pizza almost every day. Burrito actually could eat More. I don't know. If, you'd be able to eat a pizza every day. That would get old real fast. Yeah. Also. Well what If you took one Bite. No old people get sick of that. You Would, you would never eat. Pizzas are round. I'm not, I'm not objecting. Oh, It sounds like you're objecting But you don't eat like a donut. You eat as a, as a circle. you don't eat a pizza as a circle. What about, what about a, you Eat from the inside of the circle out. What about the, you eat slices. What about the long ones? The long skinny ones? What about, What about in Ninja Turtles?

Birthday cake. Pretty decent pie. Vastly superior. Yeah. You think you don't think pie clears cake? I think I've had more cake than pie in my life. That's not the question, sir. So yeah, I would say that. No, That's Because my personal No, it's One is one is served more. Doesn't mean it's better. You Get force fed cake at birthdays. I would prefer birthday pies. Ice cream is better than cake. Why don't they just do ice cream at every birthday? They do. You just do they They do Both. No, they do, they do cake. Way more than ice cream at a birthday. But you've had more ice cream than cake. 'cause it's better. I've definitely had way more ice cream than cake. Yes. Yeah. Easily. I probably have had, I probably have had a lot of pie, But that's because I, I select the ice cream myself.


I go outta my way to purchase ice cream. I don't get ice cream foisted upon me like people do with cake. Somebody. Correct. I don't wanna talk shit about cake because I, I do enjoy cake, but pie is way better. Mm. Okay. Pie number one. And then back to me. The wheel. Mm Good. Pick The wheel, add it on there.

Before we get to our interview with Jason Wirth, I want to tell you about a great new movie on Apple. The Instigators is a hilarious Apple original film starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. Those are two big names about two amateur criminals who are in way over their heads. I saw the preview for this. It looks awesome. From the director of Mr. And Ms. Smith and the Born Identity, the instigator centers on Rory and ex-Marine and Nita Cash, who reluctantly teams up with an unpredictable ex-con named Kabi to pull a simple 15 minute job robbing the mayor of Boston. Sounds easy, right? Well, when every step of the plan goes haywire, Rory and Cobby find themselves in the midst of a statewide manhunt running from the police in the criminal underworld alike, with nowhere left to go, the pair turned to the only person they know qualified to handle a crisis Rory's therapist played by Hong Cho. You won't wanna miss this action packed comedic thrill ride. Listen, apple TV gets the best actors out there, and this is gonna be a great movie. The Instigators rated r stream the film August 9th, only on Apple tv. Plus go check it out now. Apple TV plus I'm gonna watch this. I know you're gonna watch this. PFT. Oh yeah. Let just try to get Matt Damon and Casey the Aflac on sometime that would be a, a dream pairing. You mean? At the same time? At the same time. So we should try to do it stream the new film August 9th, only on Apple tv. Plus the instigators rated R


And here's Jason Wirth. Okay, we now welcome on a very special guest. It is 15 year MLB Pro Jason Wirth, also horse owner. Jason, thank you for coming. Yeah. In studio. My pleasure. Great to see you. You got the American Century Championship hat on? Yeah. Golfer Still still flying the, the hat there. Yeah. So let's start with, actually, I don't know where you wanna start. We wanna start horse owning. We wanna start all your businesses that you got going on. Wherever you wanna start. I'm just happy to be here. I finally made it, Actually, I'll start here.


Jason Wirth, the, the connection that we have is, we just had David Wells on a couple weeks ago and Jason War's first MLB hit was against David Wells. How, how pumped were you for your first MLB hit? Also, how long did it take? Because I always wonder like, guys who take a while, does it really fuck you up? Yeah, so it's a good story. So I, I was a catcher all like, well, growing up and up until AAA and then the la I was with Toronto. They finally were like the tired of watching it. So they moved me to the outfield and I played left in AAA the whole year. Played like 10 games in center. And I get to the September 1st, I get called up, we're playing the, playing the Yankees in the Sky Dome or Rogers Center, whatever they call it now.


And I go into the, the clubhouse. I look at the lineup and I'm like, shit, you know, nine batting ninth worth nine. And I'm like, the fuck's nine. I'm like, oh shit, I'm playing right field. Yeah. I've never even seen a nine by my name before. So I was like, okay. So, you know, you don't ever play in stadiums with five decks. you don't ever play in domes. You know, when you're a kid growing up, you know, minor leagues, whatever. So my first game is playing right field at Rogerson and they like, we're out there playing catch running sprints before the game and they open the dome. And so I'm like, this is fucked. You know? And of course, first pitch of the game, Alfonso Soriano hits the highest fly ball that I ever caught in my career.


First, first pitch in the big league. But you caught it. But I caught it barely. And then my first at Bat off Boomer, I, I hit a, a bullet down the third base line and Ron Kuer was playing third that day. And he like picked it up, boom dog. And I think he threw it between his legs, the second for a double play. And I'm like, I didn't really get doubled up much in my career, especially when I was younger. 'cause I could move a little bit. And first at bat in the big leagues is like, like a piss missile, double play. I'm still in Stand In the Box. I'm like, fuck, This is, they're doing like Harlem Globe Trotter shit. The Ball between their legs. Exactly. Exactly. Like I'll never get a hit. So I ended up getting a, getting a hit in the game. We won, I think I had two hits maybe that was a long time ago. But that's really not the, the Boomer well story that Yeah.


That I was mentioning. So a couple years later, I'm with the Dodgers and I hit a home homer off him. And, and after the game he texts Jeff Weaver was a teammate with, with LA and he said, you know, what's up? What's up with that word kid? He's like, oh dude, you love him. And, and so he comes over and he is like, all right. He's like, tell Tells Weave. He's like, tell tell Wirth to meet me at this address. And so dream he comes over and he is like, Hey, boomer wants you to meet him at this address. And I'm like, you know, I'm like, I'm a kid. I'm like, well, is this like a Hell's Angels? Yeah. You're gonna get you get killed. Yeah, He's chumps. I'm like, what's going on? He's like, nah, he's cool. So I go, I meet him like, best time ever.


Just the coolest dude. Like he had, you know, a couple friends there and like, just hung out and, and boozed up one night in LA and like, you know, I was still a rookie at the time, so it was like my first experience with, with David Wells, and I've been friends with him ever since and like, sell American Century. I don't know, If, you, you saw a picture or whatever. Yeah, just the greatest guy. I mean, I've ran into him and we've hung out like, you know, 50 times probably. I go to his, I go to his charity golf event. He's like one of my better friends in baseball that I didn't actually play with. Yeah, that's awesome. You know, so he's, he is the man That's a, that's a scary proposition to hit a home, run off him and then have him be like, meet me here. Yeah. Well I was like, what the fuck? You're getting set up? It's like that scene in Goodfellas, right? Yeah. I was getting made, I was Legit scared.


Yeah. I wonder how many other guys that he's like giving up the, the first hit to, and then he texts him afterwards. He's like, I have to be best friends with you. Yeah. He seems like a baseball historian, so I imagine it's probably a handful of guys. He Is. Yeah. I don't know. He's a, he is a cool ass dude though. Yeah. Sweet. Wait, I have a question about the catcher to outfield thing. That's, I mean, you, you thought you were gonna be a catcher your whole life. At what point were you like, this is probably not gonna work out and I have to go play in the outfield and and how long did it take to like actually learn outfield? So AA was oh one with first year with the Blue Jays and they, they started playing me at some different positions. dh. And we had, Josh Phelps was there, Kevin Cash, Guillermo Kiros.


There was like a backlog of catchers with the, the Blue Jays. And I had a big year in double A that year. It was like my kinda, my breakout minor league season hit like 20 Homers And the next year in spring training was been oh two. And the Dick Scott was the farm director and he came in, he and wanted to have a conversation with me. He sits me down. He is like, how, how would you feel about moving to, and before he could even tell me where I was like, yes. Oh, okay. Like wherever you're talking about, I, you Were done Catching. I mean, I was not a very good first baseman, but I would, I would've done that all day long instead of catching. but It, it feels Like catching fucking suck. Yeah. But the only thing with catching is it, it probably sucks beyond belief, but you don't like If, you hit 20 home runs as a catcher, you're one of the best catchers.


Whereas If, you hit 20 run home runs as outfielder. It's like, ah, he is Okay. So I'm, I'm six five. I actually didn't, it's crazy. You caught didn't even like catching, you know, I was like, you're always getting second guessed by the pitching coach and If, you know, if somebody hits a home run, it's your fault. Yeah. You know, I just, I dunno the, the stand out in the outfield and picking daisies that sort of thing's more, it's pretty good. More my style. Yeah. Save Your knees. Save your knees. That's probably the, I mean, as his in your back six five Yeah. In your back. Trying to catch for that long. I played with Matt Weeders in Washington. He was like six four. And I mean, dude, it was like, he'd been catching for a long time and, and you could tell I could just, you know, he couldn't run his knees, his back, everything was slow and I could run.


So, you know, by the time may came around, you know, catching you, you, you couldn't run. I I caught over a hundred games four years in a row in the minor leagues. Yeah, that sounds awful. Yeah. It's terrible. Yeah. So growing up, you were, you were a baseball family, right? Yeah. And everybody in your family played professional baseball. Correct. Was there any, any option for you to not be a professional baseball player? Was it always like, Jason one day he will play in the Big leagues? Yeah. I mean, from the time I was like hitting t-ball or even before that I did, I did sign with the University of Georgia and I was a Allstate basketball player in the state of Illinois. Oh Wow. You know, a hot take. If I went to Georgia, I was gonna try and walk on play hoops. Wow. I don't know if it would've worked, but I don't think I had much of a, of a career path in basketball.


Yeah. Yeah. So I mean that's the classic debate. How many Major League baseball players could play in the NBA and how many NBA players could play Major League baseball. I think I could have maybe sat the bench if I really put a lot of time into it. Yeah. Yeah. Would've been like a nobody. Yeah. So obviously I'm a Nationals fan. Max behind the Glass is a Phillies fan. We had this debate earlier. Do you consider yourself to be a national or a Philly? Who am I talking to? You're talking to me. Where Am I at? That's your not for life. You're also talking to me. I'm a Philly not for life. I got a question. Which team did you retire for Washington. Yeah. That isn't that interesting that, did you do World, world Series for Philly? But it's interesting that he came back to, to Washington, which He paid you more. Washington.


Washington, Yeah. Which team did you change the culture at? Washington. Washington? Which team did you hit more I the best season for The Phillies and, and that, that team I was on in, in Philly, we, I mean we took that we were losing in oh seven. We, we ran down the Mets oh eight, we ran down the Mets won World Series and you know, that, that changed Philadelphia at the time. So I mean, that run from Philly to Washington was, was pretty good for me. Even, you know, being in the east. I mean, there is the whole deal. We're good now, but there was that seven years of, of getting booed off the field every time I stepped on the field in Philadelphia. Yeah. Yeah. There's, I mean, there's no animosity anymore. So we're, we're, we're we're good. Yeah.


Champion. Yeah, we won. What was the w was there any like chance you were gonna stay in Philly when you, or is it Yeah, that's offered me so much money. I'm not trying To stay. Well, I wanted to stay in Philly. I mean, I I, we had a great team. We had, we were all about the same age. I mean, you know, chase and Phil and, and Jimmy and, and Shane and, you know, then they kind of pat left, whatever. But I mean, we had an awesome team. Cole, I wanted to stay, but there was Ryan, obviously Ryan Howard there just wasn't, the GM told me that this couldn't pay everybody. Right. So he offered me some bullshit, hometown, hometown discount, even though I'm from Illinois and, and it just, you know, it wasn't in the cards. I hired Scott Boris and, and pretty much made it known I was gonna hit the free, free agency market.


You Yeah. I think you should get credit for, for the World Series in DC too, because the, when you got to DC we sucked. It was, it was a, a bad ball club. 200 lost seasons. Yeah. 200 lost seasons back to back. Right. Yeah. And then Jayson Werth shows up. They, they kinda asked you to mentor Bryce Harper, which is kind of a weird thing to ask a grown man to do when they're, they're paying another guy a lot of money. But was that, what was that like when he was coming up and it was like, okay, Bryce is the future of the team. Jason is the guy that's gonna change the culture and move things around. But we need Jason to make sure that our, our young guy doesn't screw up too bad. Yeah. I wasn't very good at that. Bri Bryce was a interesting kid. I mean, I I I love, I love Bryce.


You know, we were talking about it earlier, how, how hard it had to been to, to be Bryce Harper or like, you know, like Alex Rodriguez or somebody that, you know, had a lot of fame at a, a young age and He, you're, you're the chosen one before your brain is even like half developed And before you've even done anything in, in the sport or at the level. I mean, I think, you know, Bryce had a tough time in Washington at times. At other times. He was great. He was MVP one year. We were good. We had good teams in Washington while I was there. But you know, Bryce has moved on to, to Philly, which is kind of like, you know, funny that that happened with him and he Yeah. You know, he is, you know, now he is like the face of MLB, which was kind of what was, you know, how it was supposed to go.


Yeah. It was destined for It. And he is an awesome, he's an awesome dude. He is a great dad, you know, great teammate, husband. I mean, Bryce has turned into an unbelievable big leaguer. So I don't, I don't know if I help or hurt, hurt that cause along the way, we had some, we had some good times. We had some tough times. But, you know, it's all part of growing up in the big leagues. You, you, you know, the veterans kind of have a hold of the team and, and the young guys gotta gotta fall in line. And you know, Ryan Zimmerman was there, Ian Desmond, I mean, he had a lot of, a lot of good, good guys. We had good teams in Washington. I, I mean, I, that was one thing that's cool about my career is I've always played on good teams. Yeah. What, what about, so a moment you were a little later in your career, the, the, the famous Papa Bond v Bryce, like scuffle in the, the DC DC Strangler came out.


Yeah. Yeah. Were You, where were you when that was going down and what, like, what was the vibe like in the locker room after and how does that get resolved? I mean, pap was just on a podcast talking about this. I don't know If you, He he talks a lot. Yeah. He has a lot to say. Pap I'll show you a video. He just sent me a video from one of the basketball games. It was interesting. Pat's unbelievable. So I wasn't at the other side of the dugout and it had been building between the two of 'em. You know, we weren't in the playoffs. So like, August is always the month of hate in the MLB. So no matter, you know, if your team's good or bad, you get, everybody wants to fucking kill each other. And it's literally, it's the month of hate Just from being around each other for so much. Yeah.


And then either you, either you fight and you suck and or you fight and you go on to win. Yeah. And there's no, there's, it's, it's coming. It's inevitable. August is is everyone hates each other. It's hot. You're miserable. And this was September and we suck. So it was even worse. And you know, I think Harp just didn't put in the effort that, that Pat was looking for that day. And he was in the, he was in the dugout. I have to go back and look why, why he was even in the dugout in the bottom of the ninth. He either, he either, you know, must have gave up a home run or came in in a, in a tie game or when we were down or whatever. 'cause usually If, you know, if the closer's in the dugout in the bottom of the ninth either, Yeah, it's not a great Time.


Blew save, which b didn't do that very often. And yeah. And then I think, I think the, I think the key words in that exchange were either, do you wanna fucking go or let's fucking go. He gotta read Bryce's mouth and he, you see the fucking head twitch from Pap, you know, like, and it was like, it just happened so fast. And then, then I, I coined the, the phrase the DC Strangler shortly after that. Yeah. So, so what happens in the locker room after something like that? Because I, I mean, shit happens, like you said, the, the the month of hate. Yeah. It's 162 games. You guys are with each other all the time. There's fights. I mean, people get upset. I mean, you know, there, it happens all the time. You got 25 grown ass men that are, you know, work out every day.


They play their balls off every day. I mean, there's, there's fights, there's, you know, there people hate each other. There's shit that goes on behind the scenes that no one ever sees that spilled over onto the cameras, which was a little tough. We had a, I guess according to p's, you know, podcast he did the other day he called the meeting, which I, you know, I just, I just walked in there after getting our ass kicked again. And next thing you know, we have a meeting and they kind of talked about it and, and that was that. Yeah. When he, when he talked about it, was he like, did you guys just see me kick Bryce's ass? Is that what the meeting was About? No, I mean, he apologized and I mean, he called the meeting, I guess, and he was just like, Hey, you know, I'm sorry. I wouldn't, shouldn't have, you know, shouldn't have done this, blah, blah, blah.


Hey, the, the interesting part from a fan's perspective is because we always, you know, fans sit there and when we played the sport, we're watching, it was when you were in little league and like, you're, you, you're all your friends and stuff. So you think in your head you're like, oh, these guys must all be friends. But that's never how it works. How, like in a clubhouse, I Mean, you are and you're not. Yeah. But like, how many, how many guys, like w was there, some guys in clubhouses not even naming names, but like that you're like Yeah, they generally, they like genuinely hate each other, but we can figure out a way to get along. Yeah. You know, I mean, for the most part, everybody gets along. I mean, the Mets do things sometimes that I think would probably fall under that, you know, but they're the fucking Mets.


So that's just what happens. I just don't, I don't get their, I don't get their franchise at all. I play the East for too long and, and played against them. But What's so different about the Mets? I don't know. They guys, they just suck. But it, so, so it, like, in a day to day, how, how do you, were you like considered a glue guy or were you like, I'm gonna mind my own business type of guy? I mean, I would think you'd probably call me a glue guy. Yeah. So was it you, would you take responsibility of like, Hey, look, I know this isn't going well right now. Like just vibes. I gotta figure out a way to, I think you just make it work. And my, I played on mostly, you know, championship teams that won the division almost every year. And you gotta make it work.


You know, you fight, you get up, you hug it out, and you move on. I mean, you, the fight's not with each other. It is with the other team. Yeah. You literally walk on the field. At least you used to, the game's changed a little bit, but you used to walk on the field every day, like with the mentality and the thought is, I might have to fight the whole other team. Right, Right. You know, so like that. And I, and I know that my guy's got my back, you know, so that's kind of the, the mentality at the end of the day when the game starts, you know, you're all in it together. You're all brothers, we're all gonna, we're out there to, you know, fucking kill people. But Because I remember you had, that's the good teams. Yeah. You had a quote about like, the analytics in baseball and just how the people upstairs, they, they read books and do math and bullshit. Like that was what you said.


Yeah. The, and downplaying the twirly Birds. Yeah. That's what you call twirly birds. You Might call 'em super nerds at that point Too. Yeah. I fucked that out. They twirly birds. Yeah. Yeah. But downplaying like, the importance of chemistry, because I do think that gets lost, especially with how the media talks about it, how the analytics talk about it. It's like guys wanting to fight for each other doesn't show up on a stat, on a, in a box score. But it's really fucking important. Yeah. I mean, I think the Yankees have proved you can have all the best players, but If, you don't have the chemistry. It doesn't matter. You know, you gotta, you gotta gimme a, gimme a, a group of guys that might not be the best players, but they get along and they're all moving in the right direction and we'll go win. Yeah. Because There's more of the little things. Right. I would imagine if, if it's something that you actually care about, you care about the guy next to you, you make sure that you're backing him up on, on a, on a throw to third base.


Yeah. All sorts of stuff, right? Yeah. And that's the stuff off the, the field too. I think that that and in the clubhouse, and like how that all all works. The, the 19 gnats, were a perfect example of that. I mean, we had, we had all those things all those years and we just couldn't get over the hump. You know, we get to the playoffs, we're losing the first round, like, what was it in the 19 team? They, they, they were able to put it all together. You know, they brought in Parra and my nemesis Anabel Sanchez. And He's your nemesis. Dude, look it up. It's bad. Oh, wait, no, tell, tell me a story. 'cause I, Anabel Sanchez is a personal hero of mine, just because I had him on my fantasy team the year that he threw a no hitter. That's literally the whole Story. That was, that's my only thing. That was, that was my every game against him.


Yeah. It's something like three for 35 with like 28 punch outs. Wow. Damn. Jesus Christ. And then, like, I faced him when I was hot, when I was cold, I did hit a homer off him in Philly, but it, like, it hit the back of the fence. Like went in the flowerbed, you know, barely counted. Not even, yeah. Right. Didn't feel good. I remember we went into Detroit, I was with the Nats and I was hot. I was like, player of the month. And I was going in there, I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get him. This is it, you know? And it was like two punch outs and a broken bat back to the pitcher. And it was just like, and I got three hits the next day. Oh Man. It's crazy. Didn't matter. Yeah. Yeah. How Psycho is Max Scherzer as a teammate? On the day he pitches? Yeah. From two, like two 30 on Max is great.


He is one of my, one of my buddies. He he'll love, you know, it's like what? You're a, you're a hor you're a horse for one day and you're a horse's ass for the next four. Yeah, that was Max. He's just, he's an idiot. But on the day he pitches you, you want him with the ball. But at like two 30 on, he puts the headphones on and starts listening to like, I don't know what he is listening to, but, you know, and the funny thing is, he, he will, he'll look over to like his, look at his locker mate, and he'll be like, you know, with the squirrely ass eyes, he guys, he is like, see you on the other side. Then he puts fucking headphones on and he goes full psycho until he comes outta the game. It's all, it's awesome. The day the, you know, you come in, you look at the lineup and you're like, you know, you don't really, for the most part, you don't know who's pitching every day.


Just you, you know, you're gonna play every day. Whoever, whoever pitches inconsequential. But you walk in and you see Scherzer, you know, pitching, and you're like, I, me, you're like, fuck yeah, let's go. Yeah. Because, you know, he is gonna be just, he's gonna be fired up for the game. So Yeah. Yeah. Ultimate competi. Ultimate. Yeah. I gotta ask you about the, maybe one of the best at bats in Major league baseball history. It was the NLDS, right? Yep. And you had 13 pitches, and then you hit a dinger, walk it off bottom of the ninth. When we're watching that at bat at home, it's like every single pitch, you get more and more nervous as a fan. When you're in the box going through that at bat, are you like, fuck another foul ball. I hope I don't fuck this next one up.


Do you get more nervous or, or do you get more locked in? No, I only get nervous for horse racing. I, that at bat was cool. So that, that bullpen, that cardinal bullpen that year was the hardest throwing bullpen of all time. Like, and it wasn't even close. And that was like the new age bullpen. Now every bullpen's constructed like that. Everyone's got a, you know, everyone's throwing a hundred outta the pen. Yeah. That, you know, their bullpen was nasty. That lancelin in there, that that was, you know, he had like a 18 game winner. And I start off the, he paints two heaters down the way at 97. I'm down oh two, I always had this thing, you know, the personal thing of mine where if I got down oh two, I'll be like, all right, let's get it to three, two, you know, if I get to three, two, now I can, now I can win the at bat.


So, and it's, you know, it never works out. I mean, sometimes it does, but that's the kind of the mentality We're gonna fight. We're gonna battle and get to three, two, you know, we're gonna be a tough out. And I just kept grinding and I kept grinding and found balls off. But as I, I kept found those balls off, I kept Ty tying them up, and there was like a tutu pitch. I think he threw a hook. And y you know, yai probably the best catcher of all time. He went to frame it and just kind of hit off the bottom of his mit, just didn't quite catch it, you know, if he catches it, I get, I'm, I'm done. So then I went to three two and I was like, I fucking got him. And I foul the ball off And the next pitch. I, I shot him and it was like, you know, a pretty cool moment for, for DC and for me, obviously coming, signing that big deal and kind of sucking the first year, getting the organization turned around the right, right.


Direction. And then, you know, I broke my wrist and that year in 2012, I had all these wrist problems when I was younger. And so then I break my wrist, you know, second year in Washington, it's just like, oh my God, I'm gonna, this things could not go worse. Right. And the team plays great. We're like best team in baseball. I come back off the DL and, and it ended it in like three 10 or 12 or something that year. And then got that hit that. But the next day we, I lead off with a double and we go up like six, seven runs and then we ended up fucking losing that game. Yeah. You know, it was, we were just so snake. But in the playoffs we had that 1880 game against the Giants that we couldn't win. Then we, you know, it's just like, then we go to San Fran, we needed to win a game and like, you know, all hell breaks loose.


We got, you know, it was just, it was weird. It was like, it was like, we just, we just weren't meant to win, you know? Yeah. Everything went against us that the series against the Cubs that year. Yeah. I mean, we had, we had 'em beat and we, we beat 'em up, you know, when they went and played the Dodgers the next round, they had nothing. Yeah. Same thing. The next year we, the Dodgers, we had them beat. They had bring Clayton Kershaw off no day's rest outta the bullpen. And we had, you know, we had 'em beat and they, they end up beat us and then they played the Cubs and they had nothing left. Yeah. You know, and we were set up. I felt like we were, we were just hitting our strides. So it was like, if we could ever gotten through the first round, I mean, I, I thought every time we were in the playoffs, we were gonna, we were gonna win it all. So. Yeah. Yeah. And then, but you know, we got our championship in, in, in 2019. I wasn't there.


But I feel like, like you said, I had a lot to do with, with that team and those guys. Well, the, It's a, it's a big change in terms of what the team was like before you got there. To what the, the way that you left the team afterwards, and you were talking about like changing culture. Is there any, what, how much can one guy do as a baseball player to change a culture in the city? I mean, I, I tried a lot. We, a lot. Zim was a big, big help. I mean, if I ever wanted to get anything done, I went to Ryan. The, the ownership would and the GMs, they, they would listen to Ryan. I, I became white noise, I think towards, towards the end. Yeah. I was asking for so much. Yeah. You know, we, we changed the medical, we changed the food and the clubhouse and, and did a lot of good stuff. And created, created just a really good environment for guys to go and win and be, be successful and be comfortable.


How, how important is the food? I think it's everything. Would you, would you, would you stop at McDonald's and feed your racehorse on the, on the, at Big Mac on the way to the track and expect him to win? Right. Or would you wanna feed him the best food in the world and make sure he is, you know, has, has everything he needs, you know, from a training, you know, you know, mind, body, spirit type type of approach. Yeah. I, I got a question about your time in, in Washington as well, and it doesn't totally apply, but it's more like where baseball's headed. So obviously it was very famous when Strasberg came up and he gets hurt and then they put the limits on him. You see it now with young pitchers. Like Paul Skees had a no hitter going through seven and they took him outta the game.


What do the rest of the guys in the clubhouse think when the management puts a limit on the pitchers and you know that it's not the pitcher's fault, but you're like, come on, like, this guy's a stud. Let's keep him out there. Yeah. This is a tough one for me. 'cause you know, I still, I I still wanna work in baseball ongoing, so Yeah. I can't bury my former employer on this one. Yeah. I, I will say that I, we had a conversation at the beginning of the year, Davey Johnson was a manager. And I said, why, why are we gonna start STRs opening day if we have this this innings limits, why wouldn't we start 'em in May so we can get 'em through October? Right. And I mean, we're coming off 200 lost seasons of 500 season and then that season.


And he looked at me and says, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Yeah. So I'm like, fuck. Yeah. All right. And that was about all I had to say about it. But I mean, I feel like, looking back, I wish I would've said more. I don't think it would've mattered. They don't, no, they don't give a fuck what I said. But, but Are the guys in the clubhouse, like ma, like, do they get frustrated? I mean, I'm sure Strauss was frustrated too. I think we were all frustrated, especially since we lost. But I mean, Straus was healthy. I don't know. Could he have pitched outta the pen? Could he came in and closed games? You know, did He want to, was he like, I wanna be in there. I don't Know. I mean, he, he had having, being injured and not, you know, getting to the point where you've made money is really tough in that game. Right. So you gotta look out for yourself, unfortunately.


But, you know, at the same time it's a, you know, you gotta, you gotta be there for your guys. That was, Strauss was young, the team was, you know, in its infancy. I mean, it turned out he got paid and they won a World series. So I think it all, it all worked out. Would I like to see him, you know, continue to pitch or even start the season later. Yeah. So we would've had 'em, of course, but I don't know, we still had a chance. We were up six runs. I mean, in that game five we had, I mean, we, we should have closed that out. I mean, it's just another one of those weird things when I was there. We just, just You felt snake bit. Really. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it does, that's a, a good point that you made, which is like, if we have him on this innings limit or this pitches limit, whatever the case was, why don't we just start the clock later?


And the fact that he's like, we'll, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. That's pretty much saying, yeah, we're just, we're not gonna do that. Yeah. Just go, go, but Go, go back, go out in the right field. Yeah. Third or second, whatever it was. Yeah. It's the same amount of innings. It would, it would make sense to just push it back a little bit. Switching over to the outfield, do you remember the first time that you lost a ball in the lights? Or just lost in the clouds? 'cause that feels like it must be the most helpless feeling. It's the worst. Yeah. And I like, for whatever reason, I, I wasn't good at it. Sun balls too. First, first one, I don't know. There's a, there's a good one at, it's, it's, you could still find it. I think it was a twilight ball.


So like, for like three minutes every night. Sometimes the, the cloud, the sky goes purple and if the ball goes up, you got, you got no shot. And it was kind of later in my career and we all, you know, we all talked about it. The worst is when you see a outfielder go back and he's throwing his hands up and like, I can't see it. I can't see it. Yeah. And everyone's just running because they know he can't see it. Yeah. You know? So I'm like, why? Well just act like you have it. Yeah, yeah. You know, you know the center field, you know, I don't see it like, get, get over here, help me. Yeah. Right. So Andre Ether was, was hitting for the Dodgers and, and my buddy Chase Uley was on second. And we were kind of like later in the, or later in our career and Andre either hits a ball up and I, like, I go back and like camp underneath it.


Like I, like I definitely got it. And, and I, I don't see it until I see it go over my head. But I, you know, I was just, I was already at the spot. And then I like, act like I catch it and I look at Chase at second base and he looks at me, he's like, I can see him be like, what the fuck? And like, we, he's like laughing around third, I'm laughing like, it was hilarious. Yeah. Because I like, I, you know, I texted him every game. I was like, I fucking got you. But that, that was, there was the gif actually, or the, yeah. You can see the ball goes right over my, you know, and they did the thing where it was like the circle for like MOB the show. Yeah. It's like, you know when your controller stops working.


Yeah. You know, like, I don't know. It was, it was pretty funny. But it is, it sucks. My buddy Sean Kelly, he tells everybody that I'm the worst outfielder of all time. 'cause it was like, there was two times in, in Milwaukee. Now Milwaukee has the weird, the weird glare sometime on day games. Yeah. Like the afternoon game. It gets kind of weird in the fall. And there was two balls that went out there. I never saw, like one almost hit me. I was like, I was trying to like, just catch the sun and then like went right here. I mean, you're fucked. There's, it's not, it's not a good feeling. It's not where you wanna be. But I just always felt like the guys that are running around acting like idiots and like, they don't, you know, they don't see the ball. Yeah. Giving it away. Yeah. I'm like, just stand there and act like you got it. Yeah. You know, but it neither way works.


but it, I got a horse racing Question for you. Who's your goat horse race? And this is a very important question 'cause we have one as a podcast. What do you mean? Who's your goat? Your Goat horse. The best horse. Oh, it's easy. Mm. Dook. Oh, okay. All you can name your own. We, we think Secretariat was Ro up and Flight Line is my personal goat. So I was at that. So I just got into horse racing. Yeah. So I haven't really, I'm like, this is year three horse racing for me. I was at that Flight line race and at the time at The Breeders. Yeah. Yeah. I was there too. Yeah. I, I felt like I was watching Muhammad Ali and Prime. Yeah. Yeah. It was, I I was the coolest. I've seen some cool shit and I, I put that up there. It's number two now after, after Doex winning the, the, the Belmont.


That's like, I put the World Series, the parade and then the Belmont win is my top three. Yeah. That's gotta be awesome. Did you find that that horse racing people have welcomed you with the open arms? Or is it still, is it like a club that you're trying to get into? I don't know. We'll see. I mean, I think winning the Belmont was, was, was kind of like my entry in Yeah. Can't Say anything to you now. Yeah. Yeah. So I know one thing, Saratoga, having doing that at Saratoga was really cool. Awesome. And then, so like the next day we went back on Sunday to like, get some souvenirs and shit and just run by the tracks. Say hi to a couple people. And I felt like the mayor of Saratoga or something. Yeah. Saratoga. I, I've said it Before. The people are so great For people who don't know Saratoga and Keland are the Fenway and Wrigley of horse race.


Correct. Yeah. Like that they are the special, special places when you walk in, you feel like Feel it back in time. Right, Exactly. It's like very old timey and it feels that way. That's A good analogy. Yeah. So, so I mean, that's crazy that you won the Belmont three years in My first coal I bought It's nuts. Like that doesn't happen in horse racing. No, it doesn't happen. Period. Yeah. Right. So are you like, are you all in, are you like, this is 'cause because it's very cool If you If you have the money and, and you know, you can get some success. It's gotta be one of the coolest things to be able to buy horses and win big time races. Yeah. It's addicting. But look, I, I tell people that, you know, running a a Tuesday 16 claimer at Tampa Bay Downs is exciting.


Yeah. I mean it's not as exciting, but it's like, it's like winning a big game. Yeah. You know, winning the Belmont was like, was like win winning the World Series. Yeah. That's kind of the emotions that you feel. I think horse racing's cool for, for athletes in general even, you know, regardless of what level you played. Because when that If you own the horse, I think, I think when you bet on the horse compared to when you own the horse are two different things. Yeah. You know, you're like dealing with a family member that's that's playing. But I, I say that when they come out of the gate, it, I get the emotions of what I, what I had when I was playing. Yeah. And you can't replicate those, you know, you can't, you know, you can't play, you know, anything really.


Golf or whatever, you know, pick up basketball, whatever it is. I mean, you can't do anything anymore after you're done playing a, you know, a sport that gives you those emotions and then all of a sudden I start getting into horse racing, I'm like, damn. Like I'm back on the field. Right. You know, then you win. You're like, fuck yeah. Woo. It's, it's, it's for, I think for athletes it's a, it's an amazing sport. Yeah. How'd you get into it in the first play? Like, was there somebody that you had that was a friend that owned a horse? It was like, Hey, I think you'd enjoy this. Yeah, I was playing golf with some guys. I just kind of started playing golf too. And he That's not fair that you're that good. I Played a lot as a kid. Sorry. I started not fair. I started again. Yeah. How Good. Wait, how good are you? I Mean, he was like plus eight or plus 10 on what?


What'd you shoot? I, I got 10, 10 points at, at, yeah. American century. But I played pretty Damn good. Yeah. It's really Good. I'm a 5.6 handicap. Yeah. Did you see what Aron shot? He was awful. Yeah. I saw him on the range. I didn't need to see what he shot. I think so they cap your strokes per hole, right? Yeah. And you can only go, can only get a bo a double. I think he maxed like every hole His first round, he did his, His swing would, would lead you to believe That's true. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, that's not fair. Griffin's such a great athlete as a bad golfer, But athlete, it's so funny because you don't, when you see athletes like professional athletes golfing, you're like, this is not fair. And then you remind yourself like, oh yeah, they just move different than everyone else. So of course there can be good at golf.


Yeah. You guys just move differently. I think there's exceptions, but Yeah. But I mean it's for the most part, like, you see them and you're like, yeah, of course they are. And I can understand if, if Alex just started playing golf because when I started first started again, I was really bad. Yeah. Because the baseball swing and the golf swing are two totally different things. Yeah. Is there a sport that you really stink at? Well, I don't really play many sports, So the answer is you probably are awesome at all Of 'em. Every sport that you've played. Yeah. Allstate basketball. Yeah. Won the Belmont. Yeah. So far so good. Yeah. The Allstar Seems like you're pretty damn good at all of 'em. I Was, I wasn't really good at long distance running. I actually, that's Not a sport At really suck. I really suck at long distance.


Right. I've, That's a great thing to suck at. I'm a that actually means that you're smart. Yeah. It means that your body Knows to conservative. Why would you do that anyways? Yeah. It's A shitty Sport. Exactly. So the other thing is you're, you're into is you're a farmer and you farm regular crops. Right. And also marijuana. Like that's, how'd you get into that? We haven't actually started farming marijuana. We're in the process. Have a, we have a license too, and we're building the, the concept. But yeah, I got into ag kind of in oh nine. It was more of a, a place just to get away from everybody after the season and, and do some deer hunting. And then it turned into this, it was about the same time I started kind of taking real good care of myself, like eating organically, you know, just doing everything I could to be the best athlete.


And I didn't want 'em, you know, I didn't want 'em spraying all that shit on my land. And, and because I, I wanted to eat the, you know, process the deer that we killed. And, and I didn't, you know, I just wanted to be eating good stuff too. So it turned into this organic farming project, which is, which is cool. I, it turns out I like agriculture. And we applied for a craft grow marijuana license a few years back and we got it. And we're kind of building that all out, so. Yeah. That's awesome. That's Really cool. Yeah. So do you actually get out in the fields and do you, do you like get on the machinery sometimes and you get hands on with it? Yeah, I'm more, I'm more into like, the planning side of it. I've got a farmer that actually farms, but I've done some, I've done some harvesting and kind of get out there and move some big machinery around.


I like, you know, I like driving stuff like that. So I've, I've done it a little bit, but I mean that's, I don't know, that's a, that's a whole different animal. Yeah. I've been saying for the last four years that that weed has gotten too potent in America. It's gotten too strong and we need to bring back like, just good quality, normal weed, regular weed mids. Yeah. Like mids weed that you Can like ditch weed. No, not, not like bad, not like weed. That'll give you a hangover. This is, this is the battle that I fight against people sometimes. I'm like, let's just smoke normal weed. They're like, wait, you wanna smoke shake? No, I, I wanna smoke something that I can enjoy and then go out and, and function and go about my day. But a lot of the weed nowadays, it's like you hit it. Then at least for me, I have to just sit down on a couch and watch a show that I'm gonna forget Anything.


You have a low tolerance. I might have a low tolerance, but I think America needs to bring back mids. Think about it. I Think just Making like, Yeah, average Regular wheat. Just One strain of average wheat. It's An interesting concept. I, our, our normals plan is, is actually built on the opposite. We're going for the, like the super high end, super high potent super potency. Yeah. Yeah. You should just have one plant that's just nor it just says normal pot. Yeah. Just put like one, literally just put one plant outside. I think you could probably do this yourself. Probably now, now that you're talking about I, I probably could. Yeah. I think you Do it on your rooftop. They allow you one, like three plants in Illinois, right? Yeah. Do they really? I think so. Yeah. Fuck it. I'm gonna, I'm gonna grow my own weed. Yeah. I'm gonna show you. I'm gonna show everybody. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm gonna sell it for, since it's only one plant I can charge just an enormous rate for.


Well then that would be illegal. Yeah, You're right. I'm not gonna, definitely not going to be doing that. We're Gonna smoke it and we're gonna smoke it. Yeah. Have a hell of a time. Try it. Lemme know if it's, if it gets popularity. Maybe. We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll change our business plan up. Yeah. There you go. I'll sell you my seeds. Yeah. Max, I'm sure you have a couple questions. Max is diehard Phillies fan baseball player. I don't know If, you saw some of his swings last night. He was the Matt stares of the CAA In college. I I was following around last night. You guys are, you guys are idiots. Yeah. I mean, oh yeah. Way too old to be going out there trying to hit 700 home runs. Well, Those Max is a little bit younger that I'm an idiot. We, when I looked at the, we're talking obviously about the Jerry after dark. We did the Barry Bonds record.


I looked at the halfway through, I looked at the leaderboard and it was the bottom four guys were all 37 plus. And I was like, this might be the moment that we gotta just stop. But Max was a beast and Max is still in his Prime. So Max Baseball got a baseball guy. You got questions about the Phils the G of the World Series Champion. Phils, I have One question, and it's not about the World Series team, it's about the oh seven team and the Mets Collapse. Let's talk about it. What exactly was going on like in the clubhouse during September? Like you were, you guys were so far back and the Mets had such a big lead and like each day, like the Mets kept losing, the Phillies kept winning. Like what was going on in the clubhouse? Well, did you actually think that like you had a shot that like, I catch You.


I, I, I think we thought that there was no, no way in hell we weren't catching them. Like the mentality of that team. And that's what, like, that's what set that run off. 'cause we knew we were so far back. We were seven down with 17 to play Crazy. That's Nuts. Crazy. Yeah. So we sweeped the Mets and I had a, I had a big game. I think that might, that might have been oh eight. We did the same thing in oh eight. We were down seven. We were down seven with 20 to play. You can't Even remember your favorite Mets collapse. They, they, they, There are like five, there's so many of them. They, they come together, but I, there was like, there was, I still second there. Ty game. I like walked off Billy Wagner and then I stole second, we were down a run and I stole second and third and then took Ucci Ucci, I played for the White Sox.


So Tag gci? No. So it was on oh eight. This was oh seven then. Okay, so this was oh seven. This was, this was the one. So still second third, he hits a, he hits a double and ties the game and Chase comes up and gets a base hit to, to win it, to walk him off in a four game series. And that was the moment where it was like, we can't be stopped. And we go, we, we come down. So this is school the last day of the season. Second to last day of the season, I guess it was the second day. God damn, they all run together. Now I, we come out of the, we come out of the tunnel walking down the tunnel to go to do, to run your pregame sprints or whatever. And it's like, it's fucking loud out there.


And by the time we got in the dugout, it's like, it like cranks it up like, you know, it's like full throttle. And we look and it's seven nothing Marlins against the Mets. And they like started at like, you know, 1 0 5 we're like the 1 35 game. So it was like seven nothing to start the game. And like, we like that the place Philly is so fucking cool in this regard. It was going ape shit. I mean, everyone was going nuts. And we had, the game was, you know, we're still 20 minutes till the game. Yeah. And it was like, we're like, we ain't losing. And then so we went in that game. I think it ended like a kind of a crazy double play still. But that would've made us tied for the set.


If we would've lost, would've been tied gonna the last game of season. Yeah. But then we were up, so, and then the next day I, Charlie told me I wasn't playing, so I was like sitting in there. I had my shoes off, had my spikes off. And then Jimmy comes in and says, Hey, you're, you're up. It's like the ninth thing or something like that. I'm like, I'm up. Like, alright. So I throw my shoes on. I got 19 stolen bases on the year and like 24 home runs. So I'm like, fuck, I got a chance to go 2020. And I get a, I get a base hit or I walk, or somehow I ended up on first base and I steal second base, you know, dead cold.


Like probably could have like tore hamstring or something. But I went 2020 that year and like I wanted to rip the base out of the ground, Hold it up for 2020. But I, I didn't, 'cause it was only 20 bases. But Yeah. Yeah. That was, that was a, you know, that was kind of the start of the, the Mets kind of in my mind being the Mets and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, then we, then we did it again the next year, then won World Series. Yeah. It was awesome. I just like, I was 12 years old during the oh seven Run. I think that was the first time like that we made the playoffs that Yeah. I could really remember. Sure. And then that just set up the Phillies to be like such a good, Well, If you Remember like franchise for a little while? Yeah, we were sell out every, every night. Oh yeah. It's like, it's like what it is now.


It's like, yeah. You watch the Philly games now. Like, I mean his place is going bananas, Hank. They're loving it. Yeah. What's the hardest place to play? Is it, is it in Philly? For me, it was the old Marlin Stadium. It was any, anything in Miami was hard, I guess. I don't know. I didn't play very good down there. Yeah. The giant that was stache. Yeah. And what was the other Vol? Volstad. Vol Volstad. He was there too. I wasn't very good off him either. Yeah. He was like, I think he would pitch the next day after I was all fucked up. And then he would be like, he was like six 10. I didn't get any hits off him either. What, what, what's the hardest, like visuals, whether it be batting or in the outfield In the, in MLB. So Any, I'll tell you the good, the good ones are like the ones where they have the flat background that's like close to the fence.


Like Milwaukee, Arizona, Philly. Philly's really good. The tough ones are, are the ones like Boston where it kind of goes back or they put fans out there. The old Miami stadium where it would go back for like a long ways. I think that's why I didn't play good. I didn't see very good. But, you know, San Fran kind of, you know, batterers eye sits way far back. Yeah. LA's a good, good, good place to hit. Yeah. It's funny because you don't even think about it. Like, that matters a lot, I would assume. Yeah. Oh, a lot. Being able to see is, it's crucial. Yeah. Didn't they change that rule because of the Cubs not having fans that are just in center field? Yeah. Cut. Sometimes They, they used, they used to wear like white shirts. White shirts, yeah.


When the opposing team bat and then change into black shirts. Yeah. Brutal. Were Up brutal. Some guys it doesn't bother. It bothered me a lot. Yeah. Oh, what about, what about just velocity in general for pitchers? Because we're seeing, I think in the Allstar game, we had this one guy get in from the, a's last night, he threw a bunch of pitches that were above like a hundred, two miles an hour. Yeah. He's just topped out at a hundred, 3.6, I believe. Definitely. Definitely makes it harder. We've seen a lot of, like, the velocity's been increasing a lot in the last couple years. Did you notice in your time span when you started playing to the end that pitchers are getting faster? Oh, Big time. I mean, when I came up, if guys were still throwing like 80, 89 sinker sliders, you know, like there was none of that left by the time I, I got out of there like my last year when I came off the, the dl, I like put one of those, those flaps on my, my helmet just as like a, a mockery to how hard everybody was throwing.


But I, I made the joke the other day. It was like, you know, I played in like the golden era of baseball. It was like when it was still pure and like, you know what it was for the last a hundred years. And then, you know, now it's like everyone's throwing a hundred and wearing oven mitts that's turned into this, you know, totally different phenomenon of, of, of the sport. You know, no one hits for average. Yeah. You're either striking out or hitting a home run. Yeah. I don't know. It's the game cycles through these things and, and the game is still the game. I did a, I did a broadcast the other night for the Nats and I still love the sport. I think it's, I think it's great. It's just changed. Yeah. The rules have changed. Does it, does it benefit guys? Like I know Kyle Hendricks is on the tail end of his career, but he was always the guy who was like, he wasn't throwing more than, you know, 91, 92 and he was kind of hell A lot harder though.


Yeah. Like, is it, so does it benefit guys like that who have something a little different than just throwing a 101 down the middle? Yeah. I mean, it can. I don't know. So, you know, that's why you always kind of switch up your, your your pitching rotation, so it's not the same guy every night. Right. But I don't know Velocity was especially these kids now though, that's they're used to it. That's like they're, that's all they see. Yeah. You know, we didn't, we didn't ever see that. And then all of a sudden one guy come outta the pen throwing a hundred, you're like, oh shit, this guy's, you know? So it's just different. but it is weird that, you know, batting averages of, of plummeted. Yeah. It's interesting with The velocity. It's like the thing that makes the game fun to watch is actually statistically not proven over the long run to make for the best batters.


So like, home runs and strikeouts, not that fun to watch people getting on base, the excitement, the drama that is fun to watch. But the nerds upstairs, they're like, well, if we model this out over the course of a full season, it's not always the best for us. Yeah. So ba Yeah. The the twirly birds. Twirly birds. Yeah. So baseball's come t this weird place where it's like, do we, do we want an entertaining product or do we wanna win baseball games? I we don't know if this actually proves out to win baseball games over the long run. So it's, it's kind of frustrating as a fan, someone who used to watch a ton of Baseball. Right. I agree. I feel like we're we're losing fans. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, I looked it up, you were actually worse against Chris Volstad. I, I thought so. Yeah. Three for 33. And you were six for 33 against Anibal Sanchez.


Yeah. Equally as awful. Yeah. So, and I'm looking at it right now. You were awesome against Ra Dickey. You just could hit a knuckle ball. Yeah, I hit a, I hit a Homer off Wakefield in, in Boston, and I was with LA in oh four my rookie year. Yeah. And we played a lot of backyard knuckle ball, wiffle ball when we were kids. Yeah. So I just equated to kind of going back to that, but yeah, I, I, I, I killed, I killed a ra Dickie. Yeah. You, you hit 400 against him, so you just Could, you could see And like how many home runs? There's like a, You had, you had two home runs against Ra Dickie. Oh, Was that all? I thought there was more, But still, I mean, you 4 0 6, you, you just, He would throw me, he would throw me fastballs. Really? Yeah. He got tired of me hitting How, how intimidating of a pitcher was Dan Herron and he's a close friend of ours.


Be nice. So feel free to tell us. He be nice. Say how great he was. Dan Dan was nasty. Yeah. I played with Dan Washington too, so I got to know him. He is like the most, he's the best guy. He's like the driest, most sarcastic. Yeah. He's the best funniest dude. Yeah. Yeah. Used to have diarrhea every day he'd pitch, he chug Pepto Bismol. He said that he would routine when he was, when he was last year when he was with the Cubs, he was like, I contemplated retiring every time the wind was blowing out. Yeah. He kind of, he was, that's the type of guy he was. Yeah, he is. I I remember facing him when he was in Arizona, you know, he was just, he looked like he was really mean and like, you were kind of like, you know, he is a bulldog out there. And his stuff was really nasty. But then I played with him and realized he is just a, he's a really nice guy.


Nicest dude Ever. Yeah. Nicest dude. Yeah. Yeah. Who were you the best against him looking it up right now? Do you know The best? That was like, good. Yeah. I was, I had some good games against Clayton Kershaw. Yeah. You also, You I hit lefties. Great. You tuned up Tim Hudson. Yeah. To all the bros, the Braves guys. Yeah. Dlo hit good off them all. Like I, I played good against the Braves and the Mets. Yeah. Played 'em a lot. Yeah. You, you, you hit 3 86 against Tim Hudson with four home runs. Yeah. I remember one time on the bus, Rick Anki was on my team and he was like, Hey, JW Tim Hudson just texted me, told me, told me to tell you to fuck off.


So there you go. It feels good going both ways. Yeah. With Sanchez and then that. Yeah. How, how, this is a dumb question. Just how sick is it? Did a home run? Oh, it's sick. It's like, yeah, it's sick. So it's the best. I mean, you guys hit a ton of 'em last night, so it probably like it be you were so tired, you probably hated it. But Yeah. No, it's, it's especially a big one with, with the, the on the road, you know, in a big game when the place is packed and then like you hit a, you hit it and you can hear a fucking pin drop outta You. Oh, I'm, I'm sure when they do the slow clap, then you hit a home run. That's gotta be the best feeling in the world. Yeah. And Just goes dead silent. Yeah. And then everybody's like, fuck. And they're all leaving. Yeah. And that's, that's, that's a pretty good feeling. Yeah. It also must rock to just know that you don't have to run the bases.


Like you can just try. Take your time. I like to run the bases though. You don't have to. I think that's part of the, the game that we're missing out on right now. No one knows how to run the bases. Yeah. You know, this whole stealing stolen base rules kind of, you know, messing up the, you know, the numbers on the stolen bases and then the guys are making a ton of outs on the bases. Yeah. And it's like a, when I would coach my kid that summer, I coached my kid. I was like, what? Like what, what, who's teaching you guys? What are you guys? I mean, it's, it's like a lost art. Yeah. Really is. I agree with that. Do they have the giant sliding mit? Yeah. And they got all these skits, you know, you got kids 12-year-old kids wearing, wearing the oven. mit like, why? Yeah. Just wear a bigger MIT get like four extra inches.


Yeah. Just flop it out there and be like, I, I stole, Just touch secondary. I mean, I played a long time. I never had any problem sliding into bases with my hands. Yeah. Yeah. Did you ever have a, a rivalry against a pitcher that, did you ever charge the mound? No. No. I, I, I wouldn't put myself in that situation. I, because I saw One on six with a, with a, a guy behind you. It's not, not a really, I guess one on five with a, with the guy behind you is not a great place to be Knocked. The odds. 'cause I, I did see a video, I think it was you and Jose Fernandez where you stared him down and Yeah, he would hit me a lot. Yeah. You guys, you guys locked eyes and, and neither one of you would look away, but then by the time you got to third base, I think things were all good. Well, He punched me out that game and then he, he was like, he's running his mouth at me when I had my head down and he punched me out and he stared me down and I didn't see it.


So the next to bat he hits me and I'm like, what the fuck you got? You got something to say. Like, I was ready to fight then, but he was just a kid, you know, I was like 12 years older than him or something like that. Yeah. So I was just like, what? Why, you know, I got, I got to second base and Dee Gordon was at second base. I was like, what the fuck's what, what's his problem? Yeah. Like, I don't even know him. Like, you know, and I knew d when he was a kid. I played with his dad, flash in Philly and Dee's like, I, I don't know man, what'd you, what'd you do to him? I was like, I don't fucking do anything to him. And when I got to third, he was like, looking over me, he is all smiley, you know? And I'm like, what are, what are you looking at me like that for? He's like, you were looking at me. I was like, whatever.


So I don't know. That was, didn't really have too many issues on the field. We got into a, we got into a lot of fights in the minor leagues. Yeah. But not nothing too bad in the big leagues. I was there for the Bryce Harper fight in San Fran when he throws his helmet sideways. Yeah. Yeah. And it's always, that's a, that's a funny one. Yeah. It, It was, it was interesting 'cause he threw his helmet. One of the, it was like 50 cents first pitch. That's how bad the helmet toss. Yeah. It's, It's hilarious. But Then, but then his, his flow was so good after he took his helmet off, I thought he just took his helmet off to show off his hair. So you had, you had Bryce throwing his helmet sideways with his hair. You had Samia and Mike Morse coming right in between the two of 'em. And they literally like made out.


Yeah. Mikey never played again. Like he had like concussion smore never played again. Yeah. Like ended both of their careers. Yeah. And I was coming in there and I had my hair. It was like the hair Olympics. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that was, that was, that was a good one. It wasn't, didn't end up being too bad. We had a little mix mix up with the pirates one time that got a little testy. But for the most part, you know, there's only been a few really bad fights. Yeah. Most of 'em are just, They just get everyone chest bumps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, you try, you start with a, alright, so I have one last question. This has been awesome. We appreciate you coming on.


It's a Rollback question. R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo code. Take 20% off your first purchase. QIPs polos hoodies, joggers shorts, Rollback dot com promo code take.


You did something that I wish more professional athletes did do and did. It's the coolest thing. You can Do I, don't know why more guys don't do it. You were tired and then you played like rec league Baseball one time And just fucking, but okay. So even that one time, the bomb you hit can't get away from this thing was so goddamn awesome. All right. What, first of all, how sick was that? 'cause like that's, I honestly, I don't know why like If, you are a professional athlete, you can't win. But especially like with the amount of shit talking that happens on social media these days. If I were a sick professional athlete, the minute I retired, I would go play intramurals and just kick the shit out of everyone and be like, there's levels, bro.


All right. So, so full disclosure, a good buddy of mine became a good buddy of mine. Matt Micah was involved in the congressional baseball team shooting in DC when Steve Scalise got shot, he was there, he got shot twice. I went to go see him in the hospital after that whole thing. And that's where I met Matt. And like, you know, he was about dead when I met him. And I was like, Hey man, get, you know, take care of yourself. He played baseball in college. I was like, we'll bring you out to the, brought him out to the Nats park and then the next year he took a little batting practice, but he still, I mean he got shot in like the hand. So it was weird. Right. So years later I, I'm playing with Seattle in the minor leagues my last year pulled my hamstring and I, I quit.


I just like, that's a, I'm done. I retire and I come home and Matt calls me, he is like, Hey man, I'm getting back on the field next week for the first time. Will you come play with me? And I'm like, fuck all I get. Yeah. I mean, I have to. So I'm like, sure. So I go and it's just like, you know, it's probably the worst field that I've ever played on the, you know, it's just a wrecked field. Whatever I ground out, first of all, I'm tuned up for like 95 plus I'm just retired. Right. These guys are throwing like 78. Yeah. So I like ground out the shore bugs Bunny like 1, 2, 3 strikes, you're out, you know, like swing three times at a ball. Strike out my second about.


And then these fucking guys are like mouthing me and you're like, I didn't know this guy is, you know, I'm in DC Yeah. You know, like, there's so, they like talking shit and the guy goes 3.0 on me and then like the catcher's like whatever. And it was like one of those times where like, like the hair stands on the stands up on the back of your neck. And I got like fucking mad. Yeah. And then I hit a ball over the moon and I came in, you know, and that was my last trip around the bases. That's ever really ever. I'll never play that game. That's awesome. Ever again. And I, I told him, came in, I said, that's it boys. I'm going home. And I, I walked to my car with my full uni on, spikes on, got in and left. That's so You proved your point though, like that was a moment where everyone was like clowning you and you're like, no dude, I can, you don't understand the difference between me and you.


Yeah. So that was, you know, and it goes around social media like quarterly and people will send it to me. Like, are you playing rec League? Yeah. That was like 20, that was 2018. So it's been a while. Why you wouldn't, you wouldn't, you wouldn't do it for, for softball. I don't think. You just fucking match. I know. I would not play softball. Absolutely not. I I was If you would've called me and said, Hey I, we need you to come in and get us home last night. Yeah. I mean I I maybe would've, you know, slammed a six pack on the way over there and Yeah. And, and, and came in hot. But it would have to be for a good cause I don't think I'd, I'd lace some up and go, go run around the outfield or do anything like that. Yeah.


For a good cause. Could just be to feel good one day. Yeah. Just Show up to the field just to dominate someone. I'm Not, I'm not there mentally right now. Okay. Yeah. But we Might, Maybe we might need you on a bar stool softball team. 'cause that's also my dream is just doing a bar stool softball team and then just like one week just showing up with like five XMLB guys. You ever see that episode of The Simpsons? Yeah. Homer at the bat. Yeah. Where they get the entire team of just MLB players. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what we're gonna do when we face off against like Bleacher Report. We could just, You know, buy some horses too and Yeah. Go get fired up about it. No, I want to hit, I wanna see you hit doing Hit tanks. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. I'll consider it. Do you have any more horses? Yeah, I got a few. Any, any good ones that are like I at the same level as Doorknob, so Yeah.


Yeah. So I own this horse named Drip. And Drip was supposed to be the, the favorite in the Tampa Bay Derby. Tampa Bay Derby is winning. You're in the Derby? Yeah. And he scratched that week and, but he ran the fifth fastest time of the year on his first race. And we think he's, we think he's really talented. He's with Witt Beckman the trainer and his work mate was Honor Marie and he was working outworking honor Marie by like a length every time he was kicking his ass. Wow. And we joke that Drip made Honor Marie. 'cause Honor Marie got in the, you know, ran the derby, ran like eighth and then ran fourth into Belmont. Yeah. Nice horse. But he's not real big. And drip his drip towers over Good. He's a good magic. Si Same as Dork. And I think he'll, he'll be, he'll run, we're kind of pointing him to the big races next year.


Like, I dunno, I've got this crazy dream. Maybe, maybe he runs in like the UA Cup or the, the Saudi Saudi Derby or something. Or the Breeders, yeah. And then the breeders at the end of the year. Yeah. So he's really, he's, he would be the only other horse that I have. That's really good Drip. Nice drip. It's a good name. Great name. Drip. Do you have any input into the names of the horses? I didn't on that one actually, but I, I do on some of them. DOK was, is a cool story. I was actually in, in Scotland playing, playing Royal Dok the golf course with, with Utley. And, and I came home the next week, I came home and I called the the trainer. I was like, Hey, how's that horse doing? And he is like, oh really good. I was like, did you, have you named him yet? He's like, yeah, Larry named him DOK or something.


I'm like, like the fucking golf course. That's nuts. And he is like, I think so. I was like, when I was just there he is like, yeah. Last week. So literally when I was playing World Dok with, with Chase, the guy named the horse do unbeknownst to me being there, anything like that. Wow. It was meant to be. Yeah. Meant to be. Then he went, then he runs 10th in the derby and wins the Belmont. That's Crazy. That's incredible. Incredible. That's incredible. Well Jason, thank you you so much. We appreciate it. It was great having you on. Yeah. Yeah. Not For life. I finally made it. Yeah. Finally made it. Yeah. I, life, life Complete. You made it before After. you hit that home, run off that random dude in the Inal. Did you pimp it? Did you pimp it? Did you stare him down? Not really. I, I, the, my, my best, my best pimp drop ever was off Carlos Moore Mall in at Nats Park LA when he was later in his year.


Because he would always pimp everybody when he'd put the Cubs, when he pretty good. And I got him a three oh oh, pimped the fuck out. It was my favorite. It was my favorite pimp of, of my, of my career. I wasn't, I didn't pimp much because it wasn't really, that wasn't the thing back then. Yeah, No, I mean it, the, the, the home run against air. I, I do watch it like once, once or twice a year. Just 'cause it's so fucking awesome. 'cause you hit it so far and It's Oh, the rec league one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That was a good one. Yeah. How's it going? Alright. Thanks so much, Jason. Bye guys.


Jason Wirth was brought to you by Chevy. As everyone knows, this is a Chevy truck podcast, the greatest trucks ever built and are good friends at Chevrolet are a big part of the part of my take story. They have been for years. We drove across the country in a Chevy Silverado. We had four people in that truck and it felt roomy. It felt comfortable. It was a great drive. No meca, no mechanical issues except for when Billy drove over to Nail. He, I think he did that on purpose. But that's not Chevy's fault. The truck's awesome. We love Chevy. The Chevy Silverado has also spark sponsored the Lowman Trophy for the last, I believe, four or five years. They're a great partner. We awarded every single college football season to the nation's top collegiate fullback and Chevrolet and the Silverado have been a part of it all. So find out for yourself like so many other awls. Go to chevy.com and check out the all the Chevy truck grit. And you can build your own Silverado for do-It-yourself projects to road trips off-Road, adventures to tailgates. Whatever your thing is, it all starts with a Chevy truck.


Xandr was also brought to you by PardonMyTake, my cheese steak. We all know there's no better game day food than PardonMyTake of my cheese steak. And we've been hard at work in the kitchen adding menu items throughout the summer to prepare for football season. We want to be ready for football season because that's cheese steak season baby. The latest launch that we have is a buffalo tender loaded fries. It's got classic chicken strips that are fried, chopped, and then tossed in buffalo sauce. Then they get tossed onto fries with cheese sauce topped with branch dressing and chopped pickles. They are elite, they are amazing. We also just rolled out the Buffalo tender sub. It's already super, super popular and the fan favorite is still the Big Cat combo where you get a cheese steak fries and a drink for dessert.

And now for something completely different. Okay, we now welcome on recurring guests friend of the program. Now two time major winner. It is the open champion Xander Schley. Xander, first of all, congrats. I I mean it's it's nuts that, that we're at two now, just like that. Got some questions about winning it, but I wanted to start real quick. We watched, obviously the entire open championship we're bad golfers, we're regular golf fans.


Just how hard was that course, especially with the wind, like in regular golfer terms, like how how bad would we be on that course? Really bad. Okay, that's what I thought. Yeah, because it seemed, it seemed miserable at Times. S Saturday was Saturday was really bad, you know, with, with a little bit of wind and rain. It was, it would've been a good day to watch golf on tv. No doubt. Yeah, Yeah. It's much more fun, I would imagine seeing it on TV than being even a spectator at that, that golf tournament because you're dealing with the rain, the wind, the elements, the, the, the patrons of Royal Tru have a, a hard time just like the golfers. Congratulations, like Big Cat said, very happy for you gotta know, your dad said he was gonna drink wine outta the claret jug.


Did you get to drink something outta the jug before he did, or he just take it from you? He is like, let's fill this up with a malach. Red red wine was the first thing poured into it. Yeah. And he, he immediately, I had to go do media after the, the ceremony on the green and as soon as we got in the car, he basically took the trophy off me and then they're like, you know, you should probably give it back to your kid, you know, for the rest of the media run. Yeah, Yeah. I mean, but it, I mean it was his first major because he obviously wasn't there for when you won your first That's right. So how, like, what was it like having him there? First of all, when we saw him, he, you didn't do him justice. He's a hos and I mean that in the best way possible. Like an intimidating guy had the hat on, was drinking out of a flask.


But what was it like, like what was it like after the, the round and just like getting to actually celebrate it with him for the first time? It was, it was awesome. You know, the, when I called him after Valhalla, how he looked on TV was exactly how he sounded on the phone after Valhalla So. if you wanna just put those two together, he's a, he is an ugly crier, no doubt. And it was, it was, it was awesome though. You know, I had to have my whole family there, you know, my uncles my age and my wife was there. Just the people that've been with me for, for such a long time. And you know, my dad is European and this is, he is an American citizen now, but you know, this is like the one he really wanted.


And you know, I'm, I'm not picky, but for me to deliver this one to him in person is probably the coolest thing. And I don't know if I can top that, you know, the gold medal was up there, but this is, you know, right there with it. Yeah. I mean it was, it was, it was an awesome Sunday to watch. You were so locked in. Did you, at what hole? Maybe it was in the back nine, maybe it was in the front nine, but I feel like it was in the back nine. But what hole were you like I'm, I'm, I'm here, I'm locked in, I'm winning this thing After I birded 14, I was able to, there was a huge board on 15 and at 15 is such a hard hole, but it was, you know, like crazy left to right and I was like, you can, I've hit that fairway every day.


And I was like, you just gotta hit this ferry one more time, kid. I was like, just hit the fairway and you're gonna have like a wedge or nine iron or eight iron in. And after I hit that fairway get, you know, I was like a little fist pump inside because I was like, okay, we're, we're dancing. Like this is, you know, this is my tournament to lose. Like I, I only I can mess this one up. So a little bit of added pressure in that moment, but I felt like I really took control after I birdied 14. Yeah, Yeah. Was, did the, did the thought of like a Vanderbilt even enter your mind at any point? Because I feel like if I was, if I was winning at the open championship, I wouldn't be able to stop myself from thinking about it. I'd just be like, keep your shoes on.


That's incredible. Luckily there were no burns ripping through the rest of the property. So I, I really, I took a really deep breath after I hit the 17th green. It's a very difficult hole. After I hit that green, I took a huge, huge breath because I knew, you know, I had a, at least a two shot lead. I was expecting guys to birdie 16 behind me, but I knew that I was in a really good spot and you know, 18 is iron, iron, you know, I hit three iron, eight iron, you know, so it wasn't, it, it's not to have a two or three shot lead going into 18 is a very nice thing to have because Yeah, it is, you know, not the most intimidating tee shot with an iron. Yeah. Somewhat idiot proof at that point. I, I feel like in the open, the, the caddies do a, a lot of great work for the golfers, maybe more so than in some other tournaments because you have to know as you're approaching each green, like you have to hit, you have to land some of your shots.


Yeah. 10 yards, 15 yards short of the green. Are they giving you specific spots and like how much time did your caddy spend studying all the hills and all the slopes that are right at the front of that green? Yeah, so, you know, Austin's my boy, he's, he's been caddying for me since, you know, I, my dad cadd me caddied for me for a few events and he got canned. But Kai Kai's been with me for ever since I've been playing and Korn Ferry up, up through the tour. And he, he's incredible. He, he does a really good job and I definitely feel like he gives me that sort of edge or advantage that you were talking about on properties that, you know, aren't super known on tour. You know, whenever we play us opens or opens or PGAs, there's these big championship style golf courses where more information the better.


Especially If, you haven't played it much. And you know, Kai's, Kai's is, he's good for walking, you know, I mean he has that little Apple watch or whatever and you don, I I think last year at the open, he, he locked like 30,000 steps one day. So geez shit, the dude's just out there walking, trying to, like you said, figure out every little mogul, every little bounce where it can go, can't go, all those types of things. And he's funny, you know, on 14 it was a really big moment 'cause I was kind of like, I might hit five iron and he was like, it's a six iron. And I was like, okay, it's a six iron. I was like, this is aggressive. He's like, just hit it between the bunkers. I dunno, If, you guys remember that part three? Yeah, yeah. Two coffins like the flagstick and then two coffins and the green.


And he's like, just hit it between the bunkers and, and of course I was so locked in, I hit it in between the bunkers, like a really good iron shot in there to like whatever, 12 feet. And I remember after I hit the shot, I looked at him, I was like, just hit it in between the bunkers. Like exactly you Advice. Yeah, Yeah, advice. Just hit it at just whole out. Just hit it at the box. Yeah, Just hit a good shot. That's all you gotta do. Alright, so I, I'm fascinated, obviously golf is so much mental and this year has been incredible for you with two majors and you were going into this year, one of the guys that was like, Hey, can you win the big one? Because he is been so good, but he hasn't won a major. So After, you win the first one, you're winning the second one. Was it easier mentally?


Did you feel like, hey, I've been here. I know it, the pressure isn't the same as it was during the first one. And is it, does it feel kind of like the, the top is off now? Like this is, the sky's the limit. Yeah, I mean the expectations are gonna have to get reeled in here. You know, I don't think I would've won this one if I, you know, my head was, you know, through the roof for too long. But that's gonna be something I need to work on just to, you know, set the bar right and then keep moving along like we've always moving along. But yeah, I mean, totally different feelings for both. I was significantly more nervous at the PGA, just the back and forth holes playing a little bit easier. The style of golf was so different. And then, you know, everyone was so bunched up.


Not that people weren't bunched up at this one, but the back nine at this true golf course is so fricking hard and If, you hit good shots and you make birdies on these holes where no one else is making birdies. You will, you will gain an advantage. And so to me, you know, I I wouldn't have been as calm at Troon if it wasn't for Valhalla, but I was way more nervous at Valhalla than I was at Tru. So it's, it's kind of funny how, how the two kind of paired up and how different they were. Yeah. Alright, so I I got a tip for you. 'cause if we're trying to stay humble, not go, you know, go through the roof. Have you thought about maybe changing the golf shoes? No offense to your golf shoes, but the all black shoes are tough because you kind of look like a server. Like you look like you're gonna ha pass me some like bacon wrap scallops.


So maybe that's, maybe we gotta work on that part of our game. That's the next step. That's humbling. Yeah. You know, when They look like shit, dude, they look like shit, come on, let's get better suit. I got, you know, I got, I got, I got nothing for you. You know, Adidas is my shoe sponsor and they wanted me to wear con contrasting, contrasting, you know, colors. Yeah. Go white and then black stripes. That's easy. Yeah. Okay, okay. You know, I can do that for you. You know what I mean? I just, I figured, you know, I, I was sitting there and you know, I was spending such a long time getting ready before I went to the course. Yeah, Course of course. I Wasn't You look slow. Yeah, yeah. Right. You look slow. My, I want my golfers to look like athletes. Adidas makes great shoes, Dude. I don't give a shit what I look like to be completely Well, alright, see that's, see that's a problem.


You're, you're, you're through the roof. You're, we gotta humble you. I I I don't have to look at me when I'm playing. Okay, well I'm just That's very true. I'm telling you, I Do, I do have to look at my shoes. Yes. But If, you and I Do, I do feel good. So as long as I feel good and then, you know, the shoes are the shoes I wore those black shoes at the fricking PGA and one with them. So Yeah. Had the same complaint. I I'm just saying if we're trying to work on our game, if we're trying to find different ways to get better, oh man, PFT said it. Like what? White shoes look faster. I think maybe go, you know, white with maybe blue stripes. 'cause Adidas makes great shoes, great sponsor, but I, we're just trying to get you better, You know what I mean? Lemme show you Something better and faster are two things I'll definitely take.


So maybe, I mean, Let me show you something. See these, these are black Adidas shoes. I like them. I Can't see 'em. I don't, Hang on, hang on, hold on Hon. He's gonna get him. He's flexible. Wait. Yep. I, Okay. I am not an athlete. I look slow as fuck In these and short shoes. Short and short. They make you look shorter. They make you look shorter. I'm, I'm actually six feet tall, but when I wear these, everyone's like, oh, pf t's five eight. Yeah. Don't be, don't be afraid to, you know, let your body hit the sun every once in a while either, you know? Okay. Yeah. I'll check that out. I'll check that out. That's good. Listen, I'm not, it's good. See we can take it back, you know, better podcasting. I'm really tan and I've been podcasting my balls off. There you go. So who is the fastest golfer on tour? You guys ever raced? Not, not me.


The fastest would probably be, oh gosh, who hits really fast? There's a few guys. I mean, I can't think of anyone right now to be honest, but there's a few guys who just, I mean d Dustin was, he would hit so fast. Matt Jones, the both two guys that went to live are like the fastest guys I've ever played with. There's a few, I'm trying to think of the guys that are unbelievably fast on our tour. Now. I'm Not talking about, about clubhead speed or ball speed. I mean like fast. Like, 'cause what? Speed. 'cause you look slow. Who's the fastest runner? We play golf for a living, dude. We're like camels. We look camels. We're just supposed to just flop around until we get to the finish line. Yeah, we're not running, we're not running up there. Yeah, I not Ricky's fast. He looks like his legs can move pretty quickly. Yeah, think so.


My ca you know, my caddy's a little top heavy, but he's pretty quick. He's got some quick legs. That's a good way to say it. Top heavy. Top heavy. Start calling myself top heavy. Hey, did you have a talk with Scotty after, I know you're friends with him being like, 'cause listen, we didn't put an asterisk on your PGA championship, but some people did 'cause Scotty got arrested. So were you like, hey, asterisks off. I did it And you didn't even get arrested this time. Yeah, actually, thanks for reminding me. I was, I was meant to send a, a bottle of wine to that police officer about how I feel. Good. It's, it, it it for and now the asterisk is off of PGA championship because If you had only won that one. We would've been like despite yeah, Despite my slowness.


Yes. Yep. And bad style. Lack of Speed. Yeah. Yep. Lack of speed. I'm legit now. Yes. Yes. So you got the stamp of approval. You actually actually can golf. You're a good golfer. God, I feel, I feel good. Yeah. This has been, this has been really helpful for me guys. Thank you. Because one can be a fluke. Anyone can win a major. Right. I could win a Major if I just played the best golf in my life. Yeah. Especially when Scotty gets arrested. I could've won that. This This was actually harder for you to beat Scotty because he was naturally driving on the wrong side of the road over there. So he probably felt very comfortable in Scott. Yeah. So I, I wanna ask you about your good friend Patrick Cantley. Do you guys just know going into every tournament, at some point you'll be right next to each other on the leaderboard.


It's always gonna say at some point Schley Cantley and then everyone's gonna be like, okay, I used to think you were the same guy. Well, he is white. I'm tan. I mean he's, he couldn't, he could be whiter than you to be honest. There's a chance. Yeah. Unlikely. But yeah, you guys, you guys just always kind of find your way together. Yeah. Well this is actually the first time we were paired together with Tiger. There was a Friday in quite some time and then we were paired together Saturday and like two or three days in a row we wore matching sweaters, which was not intentional. We, we got to the practice, practice screen and we're like, God damn. I was like, god damn it. I mean, why not? We'll just shine together. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you you we, we will work on the fashion part.


Alright, so I had, I had one. I'll get you guys next time. I'm going out to make sure I'm, I'm, I'm dialed. Yeah, we'll get you, we'll get you right. I I had one last question.

So you're now about to play in the Olympics, right? Yep. So how, what, what is Olympic golf compared to like playing in the majors? Like how do, what's the pressure? Like is it, is it com wildly different? Like how do you, how do you approach Olympic golf? It's, it's pretty different. I mean, you're, you're essentially on a team. Kind of, but it's the same. I mean, I approach it the same way to be honest. It's a 72 hole stroke play. Yeah. And there's 60 guys and everyone's, you know, playing under the country and everyone wants to win. And only, you know, I think the emphasis on second and third is a lot more than a normal tournament. You know, you podium versus If, you, you know, don't do well and you come in second or third or if you're doing well and then you fail at the end you feel like a, you know, one of those.


And I think, you know, in, in the Olympics everyone's fighting to finish in the top three more so than any tournament, I'd say. Yeah. Have you thought about getting the Olympic rings tattooed on you? That's what all Ians do. Yeah. Maybe I'll just do 'em in all black. Yeah, Just look extra slow. Listen, I I I feel like you, you know, you you might not like that we, we came at your shoes, but again, I, I think that you're gonna have a lot of people walking around being like, Xander, you're the best. Xander. Oh my god. Two, two majors golfers the year. Sure. Just remember whenever you want to get humbled, you come back here and we'll find something to nitpick you, You guys, I mean you got, I don't think you guys have ever had a conversation with my dad. Yeah.


So he he can humble you pretty quickly. Yeah, let's do it. Let's have a humble off. It's important. I'd love to have 'em on. It's really important to have haters Would each try. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna think now that you guys are, I'm gonna, I'm gonna draw you two up as haters right now. Yeah. Well you know what? On me bolt's Important. We like you so much that I I'll gladly have you hate us. Yeah. Just because I wanna see you succeed. I don't, I don't hate, I don't really hate anyone to be honest. I'm not really, I'm, you know, I'm from San Diego. We're all just go with the chill, like chill vibes, you know what I mean? Yeah. Black, white or whatever color shoe you wanna wear. It's Not a big deal. Yeah. All we gotta get you to hate us. We gotta we gotta just bolt and board material. I can Do I. I I am very confident in my ability to piss you off From a hit.


Yeah. I'll let you. Sorry, I hate you guys or not. I, I I had one last question for you. What is the shaley way? Hmm. Is that something my dad said? I It probably is. It's it's your training. Especially your Olympic training. I what did he say? I don't even know. So, right. So I've got, I've got a note here. I'll read you what the note says. 'cause this is what, this is what the tour is sending out about you. It says that you have learned discipline from your father and his Olympic training. They call it the softly way. That's what he calls it. You know, it, it's probably, you know, it's that it's kind of got like some kind of weird ring to it I guess. But, or maybe the tour coined that I'm not really sure. but it, the shuffle way is just, my dad's half French, half German.


So growing up it was, you know, my mom is Taiwanese, grew up in Japan. So you know, we have the axis, you know what I mean? I'm the allies. My parents are the axis. But you know Yeah. We're on that side of the world and dis discipline is something that I grew up with so hard work and dis you know, I always watch my parents, they're super disciplined, they're super hardworking and maybe that's a shuffle way. I'm not really sure. but it has to be something along those lines of, you know, how they were sort of raised and they're, you know, countries Yeah. Ethics. It's like, it's all, it's all tattooed in there. I li I like the sh lee Wayly way. I feel like your dad's sitting there watching you win majors and he's like, that's the shuffle way. And you're, and in your head you're like, I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about.


Dad. This is the sh way. I love that. Yeah. Look slower than you are that way. You'll surprise people. Yeah. Softly Way. Softly way. Yeah. Sneaky fast. Yeah, Deceptively quick. Yeah. Yeah. You're, you are deceptively quick. You're, you are slower than people think. Hmm. I like that. Well I'm, to be fair though, maybe I'll just keep wearing the black and white shoes 'cause I am a slow learner. Yeah. Took me how long to win two majors, you know what I'm saying? So, but The lids off now, now off, off, off. Actually I did have one last thing. So when you win this time, it's a little bit different because you had to wait. It wasn't like, you know, you, you make your putt tournament over your major champion. Did you feel like you had to kind of tamper down your celebration because you had to wait for other people behind you to finish?


Yeah, I mean, you just never know when it's over. And you know, the last board I saw was on 15, so, but the way everyone was kind of behaving and I was like, I, you know, I, when I got up I saw that I had a three shot lead when I was on the last hole. And it was like, you know, it was weird. I was walking with Austin, I was just, I was trying to take it all in 'cause that, that walk up 18 with the yellow leaderboards. You know, that is like, if you're a golfer, that's, that's the sickest thing ever. You know, you get, I got chills when I was walking up to the green 'cause I was like, this, the standing, everyone stands up and you know, you take your hat off, you weight, you, you know, you're appreciative of everything. And I'm sitting there walking with one of my best buzz and it was like, this is pretty fricking cool. Like this is sick.


And then I was like, oh shit, I still have to putt. Like I can't yam this 18 footer, you know, four feet by that messed, messed this up. So I quickly kinda locked back in and like, like you said, I, I didn't wanna let my mind wander too much. I was just, you know, it's done when it's done. And, you know, I'm a big believer in that. So, yeah. Maybe I, you know, I didn't really, really feel the need to celebrate or anything. 'cause I, I wasn't sure if I was gonna win. You know, someone could make a hole in one on 17 and hold or hold out on 18 or something like that. So I just, I mean, how much of an ass would I look like if I was sitting there just like, you know, over the top celebrating and then just get absolutely shaft shafted in the end. But yeah. Yeah. but it is what it is. So The big moment of celebration comes when they take that, that last stroke where it's like, okay, they mathematically can't win now and then.


Exactly. And then you let yourself count. Yeah. Once, you know, I think they had a whole out from the fairway on 18 and, you know, after they didn't hold out, it's statistically or mathematically impossible to tie and then it was over type deal. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, well Zander, thank you so much. Have you thought maybe you're just never gonna lose a major again? What happened to this whole humble thing that we're talking about? I'm just saying, I just got started thinking like, 'cause that's how I think about everything. Like, whenever I, wow. Whenever I play anything, I'm like, what if I just, like, if I'm playing beer pong, I'm like, what if I just never miss, like, have you thought about that? Maybe, maybe you just will never lose it. You've already lost your last major. That's crazy. Okay. Yeah. That's crazy.


Us Open was the last major you'll ever lose. Whoa. What If you just retired right now. And John l That, that would be the I'm hottest take on PMT ever right there. Yeah. Yeah. Xander Schley has lost his last major ever. That's Oh my gosh. Yeah. Not my Words. Not my words here. And we're going to bet you accordingly. Yeah. So we will let you know. If, you do not live up to expectations. I'm gonna see if I can parlay all four. This, This is what's great about the media. It's like we spend years saying like, I don't know if Xander's ever gonna win a big one. Then you win two. Who's your Guy? Yeah. Who's your guy Now? We, we, we talked about that last time. Who's your guy? We, we don't need to find that next fight yet. We Don't have to talk about our guy or who might be our guy Max.


But after, 'cause he is a good friend. So after We spend all these years saying like, you can't win a big one now every time you don't win a major, we're gonna be like, what a disappointment from this guy. Yeah. Like, he's off. He's overrated. Yeah, absolutely. You, you swing to overrated so quickly these days. Absolutely disgusting. He needs to change his shoes. Mike it Up. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Well we did. I feel like we did a good job. We broke you down. We built you back. Back up the shuffle way. That's good. All in 20 minutes. I'm I'll feel refreshed. I'm ready to go. Yes. Alright. Thanks so much Xer. We appreciate it. We'll talk to you. After, you win the masters. Oh yeah. And the gold medal. And the gold medal. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Everything okay. Alright. See you man. Congrats.

Go to for the people.com/pmt or dial pound law pound five two nine from your cell phone.


Okay. Fire fest of the week. Hank is not here. That's my fire fest. Now I have a real fire fest, but I miss Hank. I I kind of miss Hank. Yeah. Just whatever his face would be right now. I miss the idea of Hank. Yeah. I miss just having somebody I can get angry at. Huey. You wanna start? Sure. Because Hank's not here. Yeah. Alright. Give us your fire Fest. So my fire fest is coaching softball, particularly me. Yeah, I heard you were a really bad coach. Yeah, No, this was, I was a bad coach. The report was really bad. The report, the report I got was you guys at, they asked Huey to coach 'cause Pug has, Yeah. He needed pugs off the team. Yeah. He needed some time off Because he resigned you guys, well, he might be back in a remote role.


You guys, you signed up for softball and nights that we were like, you have to work. I know. I, I, I I don't, yeah. Yeah. So anyway, what I heard, and I would like to hear Huey's side was Huey was made the coach and all he did was chirp and like be an asshole to his own team. Okay. Hand up. That, that was wrong. Wrong of me, Wrong of me to do everything I've done. I I I can make excuses, but none of them would surmount to anything excusable. But here I go. I, I wasn't a, a aware of what they were expecting of me.


I, I didn't know, you know, I had to keep track of the outs and the score. Yeah. Those are two big ones that I did not, was not aware of. I probably should have asked more questions before I accepted the job. And I think that's fair to say. And I just, you know, I I then we, we went off against another team. They had, they had uniforms and they had, they had drills in between each inning and Wait, They had pre they had pre-game drills. They had at least had pre-game drills. And, and are you, You are not a baseball guy. Like throwing it around. The diamond is four months a drill. Like was the third baseman was the first baseman throwing grounders to the shortstop in third base.


And then they were throwing it back to him. Yeah, that sounds like it was. Yeah. It's not really a Max. What was Just warming up in between innings. What did pug do when he was, he was the coach. Did he have you guys doing drills? No, pug didn't have us doing drills. He made the lineup every day with a nice little graphic. He would do a little pre-game speech. He would keep track of the stats and then he would, he would do a post-game speech after the game. That was basically all he did. He was a great vibes guy. Everyone turned to pug when we needed something. And then to hold's credit, well, Huey, sorry, three hours before the game. Somebody sent the text being like, pug in the lineup.


And then I, I texted knowing Pug wasn't going and said the pugs may be dead. And then he, we got elevated to manager three hours before The game. Wow. Sounds the interim manager maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and he was a dick. Big dick. Slight, slight Dick. Slight dick Youi. I'm gonna take your side a little bit because it seems like this might be a, a millennials problem and a Gen Z problem that they can't take hard coaching. I, I just, I didn't, I wasn't told everything. If I knew how to keep track of stuff, I would've been on my game more. I also had three beers. Perfect amount, but not for me. Yeah. And it was the night that the episode dropped, first episode, I was a little, little anxious little. That's fair. And I was like, all right. And then, you know, gonna have some fun with the boys and all of a sudden we're playing a, a team that had matching uniforms and, you know, drills.


And it was, it was alarming. And I got caught off guard and, and I, I, you know, and I didn't, I didn't keep track of what I should have been keeping track of. And then I got frustrated and I let it out on everyone. If you, If you. And that's not fair to them. If, you If you drink three beers, don't keep track of anything during the game and then just yell at your teammates. I mean, Tony Lar has made a great career outta That. But he, did you notice what he said there when he said three beers? He said three beers, perfect amount. Not for me. Yeah. Yeah. So you overdid it. I should have known my own Limits. You were, were you over served by yourself? Yeah. It's the perfect amount for someone else, but not for the person actually drinking them. Yeah. That was, yeah. Live and learn. And I'll learn from that. Okay. I, I don't think I'll ever have a coaching opportunity again in my life.


You're not an No, they shouldn't let me even allowed it near the, a stadium. Okay. So nevertheless, yeah, they do play in a stadium. What? He's not coaching Night Max. I, I, I don't make those decisions. That's pug. Oh, okay. Pug has been reinstated as remote coach. Oh, okay. So that's how bad he was. Yeah. You'd rather have a coach who doesn't show up than Huey. We're also our, our team name is the pugs. Like we, we need Pug. I think that's more of the case is like, you can't, you can't fill Pugs shoes when you have a dog and your dog passes away. you don't get another dog immediately and then expect it to be just like the other dog. You gotta wait a little bit of time. I was A shelter dog. Yeah. My last, my last owner beat me.


Yeah. Who? I don't wanna talk about that. Okay. I was like, let's go the analogy. All right, well you'll get better. Maybe you'll get another shot. Yeah. There's a Friday basketball game. Maybe. I, I get, I get a coaching job there. You Know, there's still coaching in that. Okay. Well you'll play in it. Yeah. So maybe it'll, it'll help the camaraderie. You know, somebody might let me, We could use a coach. Yeah, I guess we could. I just, I just heard from Hank that he was like, yeah, Huey showed up to the game. We made him coach and he just talked shit the entire time. Nobody knew who he was in there. Everyone was Who is his, Who is his, it was his first day on the, He was just talking shit when I, when I pop up. Right. You should gotten kicked out.


You should have just gave the empire peace of your Mind. Oh, He was much bigger than me and there was no way in how I was gonna, I was gonna challenge that man to anything. Hug energy. Oh, all right. PFT Your fire fest. My fire fest of the week is that I'm, I'm going on the road for a little bit. So we are going to grit week starting not next week, but the week after. Yeah. 10 days. So 10 days. But I'm doing, I, I think I'm doing seven cities in 14 days. Holy shit. Because I got a wedding, then I'm going to Austin for a little bit, then I'm going to Columbus for Pup Punk. Then I'm going to Nashville for Pup Punk. Then I'm going straight from Nashville to Grit Week. Yeah. And our cities that we're gonna be gonna grit week.

And I've only got my tiny little red suitcase. You Do laundry? I can do laundry on the road, but it's also in like seven different cities. Yeah. Packing for all that and a concert that I have to bring my guitar with me for. You're gonna lose at least three things. I'm go, I know myself and there will be one item I will just completely forget to pack entirely. Meaning like, I might not pack pack socks. Yeah. I might forget entirely to pack underwear. Yeah. There will be. I might not pack shirts. I've gone on a trip recently where I just didn't pack any shirts. Maybe you should just not pack And just buy stuff in every city.

I'm, I'm, So, I don't know if that was, I'm So glad that Huey's around because he, there's probably only one guy in this room that has a worse sense of style than I do. Yeah. Although the coat was great.


The Coat was great. That was all my dad. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's great. We'll do, So that's how you turn a fire fest into a fire fi r fest. Yeah. I love that. Now I'm excited about this. Yeah. I love that. Alright. My fire fest. It's simple one. I gotta pull up the text my wife said to me, texted me, she was like, our daughter said poo is a bad word. And I was like, and and my wife said back to her like, it's not a bad word, it's a potty word. Yeah. And she told me that, like she had said that and I was like, oh, that's probably because I, I do swear around the kids like I'm, I'm bad with that. I talk how I talk and I was like, she probably just thinks is a bad word.


She's not actually talking about actual like poop. And then when my wife tried to correct her, my daughter said, no, I'm talking about poops. The thing things daddy does for a really long time. That's good. So she was definitely talking about poops and it is just like, yeah. She's like the thing daddy goes and does for a really long time. I've, I've wondered that about people that have like three kids. How do you shit It? I don't because You can go shit. Then there's only one parent and then there's three kids. Yeah. And they don't respect any type of, like, I'll do the shower. I'll turn on the shower and hope that like they know shower's on, they'll still walk in. Yeah. Yeah. Parents just don't have time to shit. No, it's bad. But she's just, it's, I actually kind of feel like this is like my first, like I'm feel like a masculine dad because I feel like that's a very big dad move for the all the kids in the house to be like, yeah.


Dad goes and takes long shits. Yeah. You, you should do that in front of your son. So then your son's like, my dad has bigger poops than your dad. Yeah. And you can get one up on that guy. Yeah. Oh, That would your rival Big. That would be. But that is like a, a real sense of like being a man. Yeah. Being like, I'm going to the shit or I'll be back in three hours. I mean, taking a shit is one of life's little pleasures where you get some time to think, scroll, whatever website you're scrolling. Maybe play a game while you're on there. Yep. Hang out. No. Yeah. It's like that's, that's what guys do for meditation. Yeah. We just go take a shit. Yeah. I actually kind of wanna put a couch in my bathroom. That'd be nice. Yeah. Just lay down for a little bit. Tv Appreciate, appreciate A bed.
