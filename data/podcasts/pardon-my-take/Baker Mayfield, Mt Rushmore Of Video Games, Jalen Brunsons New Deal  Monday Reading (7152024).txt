It's best ball week only on DraftKings. Today is Monday, July 15th. And let me be the first to say we are, you are listening right now to the only, as far as I know it, the only sports podcast that is 100% against assassination anti assassination. That's, that's us. That's the type of take you get on this program that you don't get on your first takes.


You don't get that on your get ups. Yeah, I, I would like get that on your Ryan s shows. I'd like to see Greenie come out and be 100% anti assassination. Oh no. Greenie will never do that. No Greenie will never in a million years. It's too controversial for too way too controversial. Yeah. That was crazy. We don't really talk about the political world, but when there's an assassination attempt on a former president who's currently running for president, we have to come out and say that we are very much against assassination. Pretty wild. One turn of the head and that's all it took. Missed by inches. Also a hell of a picture by Trump to stand up like that. To have the, the thought, the thought in the moment being like, this is gonna rock.


Did you see some of the pictures that have the bullet actually going by the back of its head? It's nuts. It is crazy. It's nuts and, yeah. Crazy times. We live in, we are an escape from those crazy times. But we had to say anti assassination. I noticed one person in this room has not come out today. Anti assassination. We as a podcast are anti assassination. I anti assassination. So you are Hank personally, I am personally and as a podcast. I am. I didn't know that. The podcast. I double dip. I didn't know that the podcast was gonna be anti, I knew that I was going to be already, it sounds like Hank just kind of followed suit when he heard that we were anti assassination. I'm anti assassination. There we go Max. We go Max Memes anti assassination.


Yes. Chalk it up. That is a consensus, boys. How about, I think that's the only consensus we ever had on this podcast also just goes to show you Nick Castellano's. Tremendous timing. I mean, memes are you like, your, your memes just lives forever. He hit a home run and he also hit his 45th and 47th rbis yesterday. Incredible. Maybe the funniest guy in baseball memes. I thought it Died down there for a little bit and thought it was over. But he just keeps coming Back. Now he did hit it before the assassination attempt, but I still think Nick Castanos, anytime he homers you just gotta look over your shoulder On high alert. Yeah. I regret drafting him onto my dingers only team. Yeah. Feels like it's just every time, every time something good happens for me, something bad's about happens somebody else.


Yeah. Poor Richard Simmons as well passed away And it. No one, I mean, we all thought he might have been dead for years and then when he did die, he's like, I'll just, you know, a random Saturday in July. No, it stinks to have your own death overshadowed by somebody else. Almost dying. Yeah. Instantly. Instantly. Instantly. And I found out that Richard Simmons died because Trump almost got assassinated. Yeah. 'cause You're looking at like the four you Yeah. Yeah. I also found out that Ben Simmons is still alive Because he was probably also Triggered. Yes. I look at the shooter. Yes. The, the there, the four you page on Twitter was, was popping off there. I think there was one headline that was like, from NBA star to, to Trump Rally prankster.


Here's what Clay Thompson's up to. Now it's just like, okay, And we're gonna settle this at the, at the battle bot. That's what tr that's what Biden said tonight, the battle bot. We're gonna settle this at the battle bots. Okay. So, which by the way, that's show rock. We, We also should probably do, I think we've done like Manliest moves Mount Rushmore, but in terms of most badass things, surviving an assassination attempt is one, one. It's Definitely up there for sure. And I, I always wonder at what point do you reach assassination status? Like, plenty of people get killed, plenty of people get murdered or attempted murdered, but at some point then you can be assassinated. I think It's Political, right? Like if Hank were to die, would that be a murder or an assassination murder?


Well, I maybe an assassination. We're anti it. So There you go, Hank. Yeah, we have your back. But yeah, we had, we had to say we're anti assassination. Like you guys would be Suspects one and two. Ah, yeah. They the assassin call the boyfriend kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. That probably, you're probably Right. Does anybody here have a middle name that they, they include in their main name? Because if so that's target number one. Actually, well Just become alibis. Christopher. Christopher Max Diante. Christopher Maxwell. Yeah. Yeah. Maxwell. That's an assassin name. We'll just, We'll just have really strong alibis. Yeah. You Ft and I were doing the pod. That's actually pretty good. We dunno what happened. That's rock Solid. Yeah. We don't know what happened. Okay, let's talk some sports. Jalen Brunson Win Horse meme. What's going on in New York?


Because Jalen Brunson signed a deal for four years, 156 and a half million dollars. He saved the team $113 million. Now, not to take away from LeBron's 3 million that he saved, but this was an insane deal that makes him, I don't know, one, one of like current new New York athletes memes. Would that be fair to say? He's gotta be one, one New York athlete right now. Grima? Yeah. One one Right now. I mean, that is the most, like the, the, he, he obviously still has to win a championship to like, take it all the way. But just in terms of the path and what his last year looked like, and then doing this, I don't know what's going on.


Maybe it's his father who Rick, who is an assistant coach, who's gonna be the highest paid assistant coach in the NBA or maybe because he works in the financial capital of the world. There's something that might make that sweeter. But That'd be, that'd be very funny if there was a New York based name, image, likeness Collective that got together for the Knicks. And so it's like, yeah, don't pay them as much because you know what we're gonna do. We're gonna have just be a spokesperson for MetLife. Yeah. It's is he married to a supermodel? He, I don't, I not think he's married to a supermodel. It's, it, I I have no choice but to take it at face value. I know there's conspiracy theorists and everyone's gonna run around saying he's getting that money somewhere else. Pretty much the coolest move you can do if you're a fan of the Knicks.


I, I don't think players, I think players should get what they're worth, but I wouldn't complain if our Knicks fan right now that he just left 113 million on the table to make his team better and hope and deliver a championship to the Knicks. Yeah. So he, he got paid about 58% what he, what he could have gotten paid. How is that? He just waited until next off season. How is the, how are they gonna allow this? I Think someone, someone is definitely petitioning CJ McCollum right now and being like, this is not allowed. It's probably, it's probably his agent. Yeah, Sir, please, that's Pissed off about This. Please someone do this, Maybe they're gonna take that money that they saved and give it to Jay Wright, which would be a repayment on the loan that Jay Wright paid Jalen Brunson to go to Villanova. Also Not a bad idea.


Yeah. I it, this isn't, this is shocking though. Like when you guys saw this, were you not like, what, because guys take hometown discounts. He took half. Yeah. He Took half of what he's, what he's eligible to take. And he would've been paid every single dollar of that max. And now, I mean, the Knicks have to use that money wisely, but holy shit. Well, there's another element. Maybe he thought to himself, I don't know if I can play for another season under t's watch. So by signing early, he removes the chance of getting injured, not getting that next contract. It's crazy. Does it make you nervous? Hank Max? No. No. Oh, that was that. You just threw that off. It's The Nicks and It's Nova.


Okay. What is Two things I'll never be worried about? Nova won two national championships. That's True. So that's true. But that didn't worry Hank he wasn't worried when he was Losing. Yeah. I don't know why he included, he included Nova in that to try and piss me off even though they won two national championships. Are you like, what the hell is going on Max? Yeah, I don't understand it at all. I, I don't understand it at all. I mean, I would love for a player that I root for to do this. This would be the coolest move ever. And Knicks fan should be over the moon happy. But it's still, I'm just sitting here like, what, what is going on? It is crazy that that a a superstar NBA player is turning down that much money that doesn't happen. Hall of fame guy. It only happens with guys at the end of their career if they want to go somewhere to make it happen.


Ring chase. Yeah. Ring chasing. I guess he's ring chasing at home Also. LeBron did Do it also. The $3 million million. Yeah. Yeah. $3 million under The apron, second apron. But yeah, he could have set a $270 million contract next summer. I feel like this all comes back to the fact that maybe James Dolan is just not around a lot anymore. Because if Jalen Brunson knew James Dolan better, he'd probably be like, fuck that. I want all his money. Right. Yeah. Because like this, like, you can't be like, oh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do you a solid James. I just think he did it because he he might be afraid of getting hurt next year. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it, it's, it's an all time team guy move. And there is obviously, people are like, well, you could have enough money.


There's definitely that limit. But still you're an NBA basketball player in the Prime of your career and you don't know if you'll ever make that type of money ever again. You no one passes that Up. It's also New York. No one does. It's also New York. You're gonna need that extra like $30 million. Yeah. Tom Brady did because he had Giselle Who's Jalen Brunson dating. That's what I'm trying to think. It's like a high school Sweetheart. Geez. Must be rich. Oh, his former high school got Got it. Okay. For a second. When you let off with Yeah. A high school. You made it sound like Yeah. Made it sound weird. I also don't know if that's a hundred Percent true. Okay, well we'll go with it. We we're not a facts show. So Yeah. That was, that was the biggest story to me this weekend.


I know that we also had some Eurofins. Yeah. It's not coming home. Not coming Home. It's never gonna come home. It left it walked out the door, got empty Nest syndrome. It's not coming back. England soccer is just, it's gotta be brutal to root for. Yeah. I I would think so. Gar Southgate can't win the big one. It, It just, it felt like they were the team of destiny this year. Well they, the way they were winning. Yep. And just like, they weren't the best team, but they were just finding ways to win games. And then Spain just late. That was like the 86th minute. Finishes it off some great soccer today. They kinda, they they ran outta luck where it was like their, their game plan. This whole tournament was just kinda sleepwalk after the opening whistle get scored on and then play really hard.


Yeah. And equalize the game then hope that you can win in extra time or at the end or maybe in pks. Yeah. And then Spain was the best team and Yamal is now 17 years old. Oh, he turned 17. Today turned he turned 17 like two days ago. Oh shit. Which sounds a lot less impressive that a 17-year-old won the, won the Euros. Yeah. Should 16-year-old. They should have hurried that up. Yeah. They should have a 16-year-old, got to the final 16-year-old, got to the final and then the 17-year-old took over. Said, I'll take it from here. Little boy. Yeah. He's got it. And then the, the copa, which is going on right now, another sign of we'll never win a soccer tournament because the fans climbing through like the air ducts basically trampling and, and ruining the escalator in Miami.


Those fans, that those are real soccer Fans and we don't know what's gonna happen after the game's over because there are thousands more fans in the stands than there are actual seats. Yeah. So who knows, apparently what was happening is people were just going to the seats and then the tickets were like 1500, $2,000 to get in. So people that had tickets were going to their seats. The seats are occupied and then security can't do shit about it to kick the people out. So people are just losing seats, losing money. Real, you know what, this is a real black guy on the Miami Dolphins. Yeah. The fact that this has never happened at a Dolphins game before. They're not, they're not used to having such passionate fans show up early. That's True. Bad sports. They need to start, they need to start charging the gates. Yeah. It was, the game was delayed like an hour and a half.


That's real. That's real soccer fan. I mean now we have, we have an opening in coaching and, and no one wants the job. I want that now. I want the German butt fingers guy. Okay. That, that low guy, the guy that would stick his hands in his arm yeahs and smell him. That real Freak. I'm in. I'm in. Why not? Because it seems like everybody else we're talking to is just the same iteration of Greg. Yeah. Just Greg under a different name where it's a guy that just kisses us. Soccer federation's ass And it been around, around for A while, Jesse. Marc doesn't want the job. Nah. 'cause he's smart. Fuck. This is why we need to kidnap somebody and force them to be their head coach. We're Hiring bur halter back that would, that Would rock. At this point. I'm, I'm in like, fuck it. Bring him back. Third time's the charm. Yeah. He's learned his lesson. Add another g Hank Oh, you, you look like you wanna say something about soccer?


Well, no. Yeah. Not really at all about soccer, but it iss this extremely regional complaint or concern because this is only happening to people in Chicago. But they've had this weather tornado Oh yeah. Up full screen for the entire game. Yeah. We got a tornado warning. Soccer's in like a lower box. We got a tornado warning means It's gotta be bad. You gotta worry about the tornado tornadoes don't hit cities though. That's good. Like big cities. I think it's something about like the wind or something in the big, In the buildings, buildings stopping it. I don't know. Yeah, that's all right. Let's, yeah. 'cause you would think that a, a tornado would hit like Dallas, Oklahoma City tornadoes at some point hit Big cities. Okay. I think they're tornadoes do not hit big cities.


False tornadoes can hit anywhere at any time. Okay. I, yeah, I just made that up. I guess we just haven't had a massive one. Yeah, I completely made it up. Okay. But Yeah, I, I made a list. Oh Yeah. F three tornado hit the bank one tower in Fort Worth in 2000, 80% of the 35 stories windows were destroyed. Okay. So I did make that up 100%. That was something I just told myself to make myself feel better. Okay. So Tornadoes don't hit big cities. I did, I did put together a list of my top five preferred US soccer coaches. Okay. Let me hear it. And This is for project 2026. That's what we're calling the World Cup starting now. Okay. Number one. I still think we can get that clap guy. Yep. He rebuffed us, but now we need to rebuff his rebuff Yep.


And go back and added zero to the order and be like, yep. Too bad. You're joining our team. Number two is butt fingers. The guy that eats his own boogers. I think his name's low and it's got the lots on there. Pretty cool. Number three. Berhalter again. Fuck it. Number four. I think Dan Campbell could do it actually. I think. I think Yeah, Absolutely. 'cause what we need is we need passion out of our players. Yes. I think Dan Campbell will figure soccer out. And then number five is anybody except Alexi Lawless. I think that's fair as well. I think we can make that happen. I like that as well. Here, here's why I thought this. Maybe Even Dan Hurley. Dan Hurley would be great. Dan Hurley was great. He said that he'd be better football coach than basketball coach. You think so? He No, he Said that. Let him do both. He said that he, he, he thinks he was born to be a football coach, which he could do.


Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. What else do we got? Oh, Wimbledon happened. Djokovich might be old. Well, Spain happened today. Spain did happen Spanish Sunday. We had, we had Alcatraz. Yep. One Wimbledon. Ah, Crushed Djokovich. He's 16 years younger. Yeah. Still crushed him though. Ugh. I think he crush was his straight sets. I just pretended that match didn't Happen. And then Spain won. And also Gio Gar. Yeah. Won the live event. Just Threw himself in there. Yeah. Sergio, what was his tweet today? He is like, we have the opportunity to make this the biggest sports day ever for Spain. Now that I've won After. you said if, if the soccer team wins tonight, it'll be one of the biggest days in Spanish sports.


He's the, he's the Dragon meme. Yeah. Like the, the Spain winning Euros. Alcaraz winning Wimbledon and then Sergio looking all goofy being like live event wherever it was. Yeah. The Big three. Yeah. Triple crown. They Did it. Why couldn't, who would've thought Spain would do that? I do feel bad for, for British sports fans though. I like, I love, I love the fact that you can set your watch to certain things in sports, you know? Yeah. You can count on certain heartbreak and misery. but it does, it looks sad when the shirtless hooligans are like walking outta the stadium, holding their heads in shame after they gave so many great chance to the Germans. They're the Buffalo bills. They're Yeah, they Are. It's sad, but it's the truth. Right. Is there a pit in England? I don't know.


I am watching this one video of this guy he's doing, he's, he's, he's traveling the river tames from source to sea. Okay. Every day he updates it. Is he like on a boat? He, he started walking. Now he's on a kayak. He a really cool guy. Yeah. He pro he did get, he got he fraud alert though, because he was like, I'm not leaving the river. And then like, day three, he's like, thank you so much to the people. Let me stay at their house today. And then he had to correct himself. He's like, look, I'm, I am sleeping other places. But yeah, it's cool. He's doing it. I feel like If, you source to See If, you do that. You gotta just, you gotta either be in a canoe the entire time or you have to walk the entire time. Yeah. Well he's got that back and forth.


He's like one of those chipper English guys like that. Just very happy. Who probably doesn't even watch soccer. That's why he's got a completely different personality, a good head on And All the other English guys. But yeah, he's, I don't know. I somehow got that in my algorithm. I'm following him. He's going source to see Liz. Check Him out. He's in a box. In a box. In a box Box. Liz. Liz. He is in a box. In a box. You Remember when we delayed our kickoff for NFL week one? Because Queen Elizabeth died. That was disgusting. That was what was the point of the Revolutionary War. That was nuts. And we should never have to do that. We should never, ever have to do that. Okay. What else we got in the sports world? We, it's Allstar Break, Allstar break. Christian s not competing in the home run derby.


I am nervous about this because I texted him asking him and he was like, he said, let's just call him real quick. 'cause I'm nervous that he's gonna somehow compete in the home run Derby. He's gotta say that he's not gonna do it ever. Is he? Do we have a dingers only update for All Star Break? I am in second to last place. I'm beating Jerry by two. Oh, nice. I don't know. I don't know who's ahead of us if he doesn't pick up, we'll just cut this. Hey. Yeah. Christian. Hey Big. Cat Pardon. My Take here. You're live to take Wait, wait. Please. Could you confirm that you are not competing in Monday's Home run Derby?


I can, I can confirm. I'm not competing in this year's home run Derby. Okay. I Now it The future though. Yeah. So what, why are you not competing this year? I just felt like you've had a tough year so far. We give you a break. Okay. Alright. So, but, but then you, you are, you are making a pledge right now to compete at some point in the future in the home run Derby. That's the plan. I think that'd be a good goal to have, don't you think? No, I think that's a terrible goal. You're not getting younger, dude. I'm not. So, I mean, it's gonna have to happen asap, I think. Okay. Hey, Christian. PFT comments are here from part of my take. You live to tape on the podcast. Can you confirm the sources that are saying that you were scared to compete in this year's Home Run Derby?


Well, this is some Big J journalism out here from you guys, Huh? Yeah. Are you scared? Are are you afraid of home runs? No. I think, like I said, you guys have had a tough year and I felt it was only right to give y'all a break. And we are, you are right about the age thing. I think we're gonna have to get it done here in the, in the near future when we do it. Not if we do it, but when We do it. Okay. I don't like that Happy birthday, by the way. You're 37 years old tomorrow? I think so. Okay. All right. We're gonna start the rumor that he's really old. That way he can't compete. Okay. Christian, have fun. Are you, are you, you're an all star, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'll just be watching the Derby tomorrow, but I know just be, I'll be thinking of you guys the whole time.


You're 100% not competing, correct? A hundred percent. Not this year. Alright. I'm still nervous that he's gonna be like, ha ha. Just kidding. I'm competing. Yeah. Hey, hey Christian, were you upset when nobody took you in the Dingers only draft? Yeah. Were you upset about the dingers only draft? You know, I didn't see the dingers only draft, but I heard about the dingers only draft. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's gonna be another reason why we're gonna have to compete in the derby At some point. Okay. Alright. Okay. All right. Well, Christian, have fun at the All-star break. You're having a great year. And don't eat any, hopefully this isn't your last good year. Let's hope now, Right? Yeah. That'd be a shame. I, I'll, I'll probably, I'll probably see y'all in Chicago here in a few Weeks. Okay. We, we Can we can hash it out then.


Perfect. Perfect. Don't ruin your swing. All right. All right. See ya. Alright. Bye guys. Alright. Thank God. Okay. That's good. Confirmed not 'cause I was still nervous that there was like one slot open and he was gonna just slide in. But he really thinks he's gonna do it at Some point. I don't think so. I think, I think that one year, the year after we made that bet, that was the danger year for us where he got hurt right before the, the home run derby. Yeah. That would've been really bad. Yeah. Okay. But now I'm not even gonna wax. Yeah, I was thinking about waxing just to be a good, I was be a good teammate. You're thinking about waxing, I was thinking about wiping. No. Waxing and wiping. Okay. Showering. Everything. I, I, I won't wipe. Okay. Any other sports stories before we do? Who's back? Marty Fish won the American citizen.

And, and the game before, I think she had like four rebounds in the last two minutes. Kind of, kind of stat patting a little Bit. She was stat padding. So today she had eight points, 16 rebounds. They were giving her the ball at the end of the game. And the liberty were quadruple teaming her. Yeah. The, yeah. The videos and pictures are very funny. They, they just said, we're not, we're not letting the record happen on our watch. No. Easy buckets. Petty wars. Yeah. And she kind outed herself as a broke girl because she was talking about all the guys that keep asking her to fly them out for games.


And she's like, I'm not flying any guys out for games. I guess she doesn't have it like that. Oh yeah. The, the stat padding is crazy. Angel Reese is a good basketball player. I'm a Chicago Sky fan. It is insane that anyone thinks that Caitlyn Clark and Angel Reese are on the same level in playing basketball. Angel Ree is so much better. Yeah. She wouldn't had dad. Caly Clark is so much better than Angel Reese. Crazy. But she got another, she got another 20 and 10 game. It's crazy. Now the, the rumor out there is that Diana Te Rossi's gonna have to back out Oh. Of the Olympics. And then Caitlyn Clark would be the next person brought in. Okay. Flyer Out there. That would be cool. They're gonna fly Kaitlyn Clark Out. That would be cool. Have they decided Who's gonna be, is it Derrick White officially? Yeah. Who's there?


Yeah. Alright. When did they start? Was it two weeks Olympics? I think it's in, yeah. End of July. I wanna say July 26th is opening ceremony. I Saw, I saw Yoic first. Weby was was yesterday or the day before. And, and just, it's so funny watching like, YOIC looks like a, like he's six feet tall. Yeah. I'm gonna say right now I will not, I'm not okay with just a gold medal. I want domination. I want utter domination. I'm gonna put it, I'm gonna put it out there. I will not be celebrating a gold medal if we win the semi-finals. If the semifinals or the finals games are within 10 points. Either of 'em. I will not be celebrating this gold medal. I want to see domination.


Like the original dream team. That's the state. Yes. Where you don't use a timeout at all. Yeah. I want, I want to see that type of domination. Mow them down. By the way, so the dingers only, which we briefly touched on actually Max is in the last place. Oh, with 12. Wow. Brandon's got 24. I have 20. Hank has 16. Jerry has s 15 PFT 14 Max 12. Okay. That's tough. Okay. Max Can't really long Season. What If you drafted Trey Turner though I would've been doing much better. Much better. I was planning on drafting Trey Turner until Gunner Henderson fell to me. What about If? you had drafted Christian Yellich Or Schwarber? Yeah. I don't know.


I don't, I don't know the math here. Yeah. Okay. You hate your boys Bad math. Okay. PFT or who's back? My who's back the week is also Olympic related. Break dancing is back. Yeah. Did you guys know that break dancing is a sport? Oh yeah. In the 2024 Olympics. I think it was in the last Olympics too. I don't think so. I think this is the first time around. Oh really? Yeah. I think this is the, the inaugural season for break dancing at the Olympics. That one, if we don't win golden break dancing, then I'm out on the USA. I could see some, some other country being nasty. No Dancing. No, we can't, we can't lose break dancing that we need. We need a clean sweep and break dancing. I can't wait to see how it's judged, how it's scored. What kind of music they're allowed to use.


I'm, I'm very excited for break dancing. Yeah. I'm on. Are they B boys? Is that what they call These guys? Just flop All like are you talking about break every two seconds? They're just breaks in the action. These guys are dead and then they hop right up. Come on, Hank have some passion for soccer. No, it's the best. Yeah. No, they do Flo. That was a real, that was real fun. No, that was afu. No, 'cause the Argentina guy flopped. It's always funny when the one guy who, the guy who looks like he should be injured doesn't flop and the other guy does. It was great earlier too. 'cause Messi got fouled when he was in the box. And then he, like, he rolled out of bounds and then he realized he was outta bounds and then rolled three times to get back inbound. Because that way they, they had to stop the play.


Yeah. They had to bring the, the trainers out onto the pitch. Gotta Do what you gotta do. That's gamesmanship. Yeah. Anyone else? I would've called to foul. Yeah. Hank, do you have any comment about break dancing? I Don't know that us is a is a favorite. you Don't? So that's, I'm saying no, dude. I feel like Japan might sneaky be nice. I don't know. There's some other countries that probably are really good at break dancing. Italy. Yeah. Isn't there? No. That's, there's like a subculture in Japan that has like a, they all look like, like 1950s. Like the greasers. Like fonzi. Oh yeah. That's not break dancing. But Still. No, that's swing dance. There's Gotta be something else. It's Like a gap commercial That's in the break. Dancing.


I could see, I could see South American countries be good. Really? Asia? All of Asia I think could, could put up a fight in break dancing. Yeah. But we have to, or those, those Russian dancers, the ones that like bend their knees and get real low. Those dude could probably break dance. You Know, break dancing called, it's called Bboying. Yeah. That's what I I I thought that's what it was. They're like B boys. B boys are doing it. Are They B girls? B women. Yeah. B women for sure. There's gotta be female break dancing as well. Okay. Korea, Netherlands, Japan, Britain, France, Russia, Ukraine. USA. We can't lose the English. I feel like Japan's gonna be fine. Ukraine. I might bet on Japan if there's Odds. You think Ukraine's got it like that?


Yeah, they might. They might. Okay. My who's back? I have two. One is Jerry Rice. Did you guys see him at the American Century Classic. Yeah. And was beat the shit out of a reporter. So the, the, a chiefs reporter, a Kansas City reporter, basically asked if the chiefs have a good enough wide receiver court to win a Super Bowl. Which innocuous question, but could be trolling. Jerry Rice was basically like, you wanna start something like I'll fucking, I'm about this. And challenged him to a fight. And then afterwards said, told the question was like, but he was clearly trolling. I love this from Jerry Rice because a guy going that ride or die with your franchise so far After you played is so awesome.


That's the best Goal. Argentina. Yep. Oh, offside. Argentina Offside should be taken out of Soccer. There should be no offside Side. No, I, I do like that. Why was Jerry, why does Jerry Rice have a rivalry with the Chiefs? They've beaten him twice in the Super Bowl. But it, was it about that or was it about I think so. Going back to like his playing days. No, I think they beat him twice in the Super Bowl. Like that's, he's so ride or die niner gang. Like I fucking love that. I respect that then. Yeah, I do. That's awesome. I gained a lot of respect for Jerry Rice this week. 'cause I found that he was, he was staying at Margaritaville. Yeah. He was with the boys. Which dude likes to get after it. Yeah. You know that Margaritaville Rocks. My other, who's back is the ESPYs. I had no idea they happened. Yeah. It was fun. The highlights I saw were Serena Williams making fun of Harrison Bucker and, and Drake.


And Drake. And then Lamar Jackson winning play of the year for his pass to himself in the second quarter of a game he lost. Yeah. That the home Favorite. That was funny. What were the other nominees for Play of the year? Was it just a bad year of plays? Drew Tranquil Tackle on Lamar Jackson was a better play. Yeah. He was Score in that, in that play. Or how about Snead's Force Fumble. Yeah. That those were better plays in that game. Yeah. It was, it was a very underwhelming play to win Play of the year. But stay woke. That's probably how ESPN gets people talking about the Espy. True. Yeah. Also, we had Steve Gleason, who's a hero. Love Steve Gleason, who's been battling a LS for a long time.


They did. He said I should have been dead years ago. And then the camera cut right to DeMar Hamlin. Oh no. Yeah. Oh no. It's crazy. The the one thing that the ESPYs are great for every year is when I know they're on, I don't watch 'em. But what I do is I go to YouTube and I watched nor McDonald's Yeah. Introductory Roast that he did at the ESPYs. They definitely, and that's awesome. That was, that was not the normal time of the ESPYs. They, they like, they slipped it in on a Thursday when no one was expecting it. I think that's what they do every year. Yeah. I think they, you never expected. But Yeah, the play of the year. That was quite something. Speaking of which the take 'cause EPN has decided, we used to run the techies opposite of the ESPYs. We are gonna run the techies the last week of July.


So get ready. A WL is being your best behavior. That will be when we run the takey. And you guys are up for eight time. Yeah. Eight time. 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 2223. Nine. Nine nine. Pete Guys suck at math. I hate, why is it so hard to count years? Because you have to count the first one. 'cause we did it year one. That's True. Nine times. Yeah. There was year no year zero. We've been doing that shit. What are we gonna do for a decade? Live show? No, that's crazy. With the Blakes. No fucking no way. Yeah. Yeah. You're crazy. Live show. You're crazy Hank Fuck that.


You're crazy live show. But yeah. Yeah. We should A Decade. What about when, when this show is old enough to drive? That's gonna be crazy. Think about that. Yeah. Okay. Any other who's backs? That's some good. Who's backs boys? Let's do our Mount Rushmore. Jordan Addison's back. Oh yeah. Did he DUI Apparently he was parked like in the, in the left lane of a highway next to LAX. Oof. And so he, this is the same Jordan Addison that I think was driving 140 miles an hour last year. Oof. And so this time make up your mind. California Highway Patrol. Do you want your guy driving 140 miles an hour or zero miles per hour?


Yeah. Because it seems like he can't do anything. Right. Jordan Addison can't exist. Think you should get a Jordan, Addison jersey. We're about to find out how many DUIs or how many times drunk driving Kevin O'Connell has under his belt. Why Is that? To see how, what the suspension's like for him. Yeah, that's True. If he's Thousand Times, thousands of times. The by the way, we have, I, I believe the Bears are the first, who are the Bears playing in the Hall of Fame game? I should know this. The Bear Boys, the Bears are, are reporting to camp today. That's crazy. So Where football is so, so close to being back, they are playing the Texan box. Texans.


Texans. That's right. Texans. Why? Who's getting, who's going to the Hall of Fame for the Texans? The Texans. I don't know. Not Aaron. Yeah. Okay. That was mean. That was mean. I'm sorry that Was mean. Let's Andre Johnson. Andre Johnson. Is He? He's going in. Yeah. Oh, There you go. By the way, we should actually mention a couple sad losses. We lost Jacoby Jones. Yeah. That was very sad. And what, what are you looking at? Me, Hank or Max four Jacoby Jones passed away. Raven Legend, obviously the, the incredible catch on their in Denver and the kick return in the Super Bowl.


And then Monty Kiffin. Yeah. All time football guy. So we've had, we've had a string of deaths. Really Sad. Tampa. Two defense architect. Ponti Kiffin. Jacoby Jones also had that iconic play where Mike Tomlin tried to trip him on the sidelines. That's, remember that That's right. Where he accidentally stepped on the field on purpose. Yeah. Really sad. I think he was 40. Yeah. I just gave that look 'cause I didn't, I didn't know that. Yeah. That, that was breaking news to me. Yeah. Yeah. Very Sad. And then Shannon Doherty too. Oh really? Two one. Oh yeah. Damn. Happened like a flurry. This was a tough weekend. I know. Okay. Where? You Know what? No, I was about to say something crazy. What should we just be an anti-death podcast?


Well, we have the still alive person of the year. Award, which we just gave Jimmy Carter another three weeks. Yeah. Jimmy Carter's never gonna die. He's never gonna die. What?

Okay. Mount Rushmore of video games in honor of EA college football coming back. But before we do that, we have tasked ourselves with coming up with Mount Rushmore punishments that we are going to then decide for and then pick out of a hat. Yep. So boys, do we have 'em? I've got some. Yeah, I've got a couple. I got two. I brought two of 'em to the plate. I brought four, but two of 'em are really bad. Hank, how many do you have? One max. You got two memes. How many do you have? I got two Memes. You got one? Memes Has one, right? Meme have one. Alright. How do we wanna start this? Can't watch a single NBA game or highlight until January 1st. Can't watch highlights. How do you please the highlights?


That's not fair. Or Sports podcast. I don't like that Either. It was because of Bulls in The Wizards are gonna be taking It. It is gonna be bad basketball. Yeah. But you literally cannot see a second of NBA until January 1st. I don't like That one. Okay. All right. Well we'll keep working. Was that one of your Good ones or your bad ones? That was one of my bad ones. Okay. Okay. Good. I was hoping that was A bad one. I have a bad one and a good one. My bad one, you have to be locked in a dog crate for 12 hours. Oh my God. That's bad. On Mitt Romney's Car. Yeah. And then, then driven around town. Okay. I had coach seat middle for the rest of the, for the, for an entire year. Every time we take a trip.


That'd be bad. That'd be really bad. Bad. But for the viewers. Yeah. Yeah. There's really no, That was my other bad one. I have 2, 2, 2 ones that are good for the viewers. One is almost impossible. I have two. Yeah, I have two viewer ones. Okay. Here's my first viewer. One Loser has to build a full size Chevy Silverado outta Legos. Okay. I looked it up. It's, it takes like days and days and days. Okay. That's not bad. I mean, it would be pretty bad. Yeah, it's not But it's not bad punishment. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mine was, you have to make a TikTok every day until you get a hundred million likes.


Whoa. Okay. TikTok a day. Wait, a hundred million li like total or, that sounds Like a lot of likes. No, total. Oh. So it's like If. you can go viral a couple times. Okay. But Okay. I don't think That If, you can't Now, does this have anything to do with the fact that you're in last place and you've kept on saying muttering under your breath this past week? I gotta get my TikTok popping off. No, I'm just thinking. You mean like, Okay, you mean on your personal TikTok? Okay. It can be on the PMM T one. So for reference memes, what, how many likes does our biggest TikTok have? Our biggest post, lemme pull it Up. Okay. A hundred million is also like, we could change the number. That seems like a lot. Yeah.


Okay. Yeah. No we, the whole account has 97.4 million likes The whole, So a hundred million Seems like a lot. Yeah. 50 million just to Pop off. Okay. Alright. So is that one going in the, in the hat? I think that would be, because it would be miserable. It would be good for the viewers. But What are they? So what If, you don't get that many likes. What? Just have to keep making Tiktoks every day. Punish. Yeah. What's the punishment? If you get, You can't stop Soul Patch. You have If. you miss a day I guess. Yeah. Well, PFT like would choose to do a Soul patch. Okay. Would I Soul Patch If. you miss a day. Why would I choose to do a Soul patch? I don't know. You Do weird shit with your facial hair all the time.


It's true. Okay. We, we can modify it for PFT. Our most liked one is 1.4 million. Okay. Soul Patch If. you miss a day though, Hank, because I think you would miss a day. I, I think we need to work. The number is is a lot Memes doing this. He's been po posting six. I like it. It should be A punishment today for like years and we're, It's gotta be a punishment. So it's called 50 But even 50. That's a lot. So is so many. Hey, it's a punishment. No one wants to do a punishment. Alright. PFT. What's your real one? That you have to make a swimsuit calendar and be a ring girl at Rough and Rowdy. Oh I like that.


I like that. Yeah, I like that a lot. Compete. You have to compete in the Ring girl competition too. Okay. And then the swimsuit calendar is obviously like the ring girl. I like that a lot. Yeah, I like that too. Okay, max? I have two. The first one you have to lock in a room and get a nine. Nine Darter. Oh man, I like that. What's the nine Darter again? 100. You have to get 5 0 1. But it's three Triple 20. There's, There's com There's different combinations to do it. But yeah, that's a Good one. That seems hard. Nine to harder. Okay. Mine, mine was similar but it Was, that would be impossible. But Bri break, LeBron's all time scoring record.


40,000 points. Okay. So like, and You'd have to do it 20,000 shots. You'd have to do it. You couldn't just stand underneath and and shoot layups. Like we would break it down. We'd have Kirk Goldsberry get us the exact breakdown. You Have to hit every Shot range, three pointers, free throws and you know, dunks would obviously maybe we get a trampoline and do dunk. Yeah, I like that. I like that. The dunks would be funny. Maybe we lower the rim for the Dunks. Yeah. Yeah. I think you have to dunk too. Yeah. Because that would take a long ass time. And. it would be a funny stream. We Think like an eight foot Rim. Yeah, we'd, we'd wheel in an eight foot rim. So you'd have a Dunking Rim. Yeah. And you'd just have to go like we could, we could actually get Goldsberg. You'd probably break it down year by year.


Well Hank will be able to use that normal run by then. So that's, it would take a long ass time. I mean, how many threes has he made? LeBron threes. Alright. And then, so wait, that's, and then memes. You have one. He, he's hit 2,400 threes. Okay. That would take forever. Really long time. What about, okay so one of the other bad ones I had that I just kind of forgot about until just now. Do you think we could get a cast, like a doctor would put a Cast on us? Oh yeah, Actually. So like get your right hand in a cast for, I dunno, two weeks. My friend Dr. Dan Sounds legit. Yeah, he, he, well he actually did this. This was he yak challenge.


Once he put a cast on Ronan, Ronan had to have a cast for an entire week. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I, I forgot about it. But Dr. Dan hit me up and he said, what'd he say? You could do a full cast, full body cast for an entire Sunday would be pretty funny. Yeah. Or for a week. Yeah. You cast your legs and your hands. Yeah, Both. Both legs in a cast would be Funny. Both hands. Both arms. That would be pretty good for an entire week. I think we should throw that in there. I also like the Idea maybe like having to read a a, a script, like a screenplay of a really long movie and act out all the characters. Ooh. That would make you put it on a Performance Like that. Yeah.


I also had another one of a disc golf hole in one. Oh I love that. Okay, so we got some good ones that we put in the hat. So we're gonna put wait memes. What was yours? Loser has to complete the dune hike in Michigan. What's That? I saw this on TikTok yesterday. That looks miserable. You have to go up the dune. Yes. Yes. Do you know what that is? Yeah, I know the dunes. But how Max pull it up? It looks, I watched, I went through like a TikTok rabbit hole of This. Okay. So, alright, so we have fully going into the hat pf t's ring. Girl, my LeBron points with dunks.


The ca Should we do the casts? Yeah. Throw the cast in there. Should We go both, both arms and both legs? Or should we go Both arms? Both legs. For a Week? I think it would be, be better if it was either only arms or only only legs. 'cause if it's arms and legs you can't get around. All right. So A person gets to side. Yeah. Hank's TikTok one. Which Hank, just Hank. Grow your own TikTok. Dude, you Know what, Hank, you can do that. Yeah, you can do that right now, dude. Would you, You wouldn't wanna do it. That's why you don't wanna do it. Yeah, no I, that's why I put it in there. Yeah, it counts. And then the nine Darter. Wait and then the dune hike. Okay. What? The nine daughter might be the hardest thing ever though. Yeah. Those will all be in a hat. And the loser of Mount Rushmore will have to pull it out.


Maybe We can do, maybe we could do I, I think like the details might change, but what we pull outta the hat will be the thing. Yeah. Like we may have to do some stipulations for some of them. Yeah, that's fine. But those will all be the things in the hat. Right. Okay. I like it. Okay. I like it. We all brought one. There's a, there's ones that you clearly wouldn't want to do. And then, and I, I'll say this too, when we do the hat, so there'll be like five or six things. I think you're, I think you're allowed veto, but you have to say it before you pull It. Which one you don't want? Yeah. No, no, no. You have to say veto before you pull it. Oh, veto. Like I'm pre vetoing the first One.


Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. So let's do the Mount Rushmore today. Mount Rushmore video games in honor of ea college football. Best video games ever on our of ea college football being back.

And now here's Baker Mayfield. Okay, we now welcome on A very special guest. He's a recurring guest. It's our chill week interviews presented by Coors Light and Chevy Silverado the a hundred million dollar man. Congratulations. It's Baker Mayfield. It's been a while. It's awesome to have you back on. We were just saying it. You've been through everything since we've last had you on, but congrats on the contract. Let's start there. Yeah. No. Settled into Tampa now. Yeah. Think we were talking about, went through a couple dirty laundry cycles there for a little bit. Yeah. Toss and turned. Didn't come out clean a couple times. But no, we love Tampa now so much that we're gonna try and sell our Texas house and be full-time Floridians.


Oh, okay. Which is kind of, it is a proud Texan. It's, it's wild to say. Yeah, It's weird. There's that natural rivalry. Like there's certain states that think of themselves as their own country. You got Texas, California, Florida. Oh, Texas is its own country. It was. It is true. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And now you're, now you're like a Floridian. You're a Florida man. Yeah, Florida man. Baker. Mayfield. I feel like I have to start wrestling Gators now. Yeah. Wrestling. Gatoring Trust the meth or, or become like a retired WWE star. That's all Tampa. They all go retire there. Eds like, I'll have to wait on that. Yeah, yeah. We just do a cycle and then After you retire. Yeah. And then yeah, you're probably gonna get a test after this. Okay. I can't wait. I can't wait to retire. So. Yeah. Yeah.


Like that, that one comment. It's random. You. It's random. Definitely gonna get a random test. Alright. So, I mean it's been incredible. I, I feel like the story of like, everything that's transpired in the last four years or or three years, it's so much fun to watch because everyone you know is like, oh Baker, he's get cast off by the Browns on the Rams, goes to the Bucks, maybe a temporary solution. Now you get resigned. You're the, the quarterback, the franchise quarterback there. Was there ever a point in this whole long list of things that have gone down where you're like, is this it for me is like, you know, am is the league going to move on for me? Because it happens? Yeah.


No, it does. I mean, you see it quite a bit, but I'd be lying if I said no. Like there was definitely a point in Carolina there, you know, going through a couple injuries there. Team wasn't playing well. Traded Christian McCaffery. I'm like, what? Where the hell am I right now? Yeah. Right. And just needing a fresh start and going to LA just for that like last five games of the year was so unbelievable for me. Like getting a fresh start. Like they weren't making the playoffs regardless. McVeigh was kind of in a, a bad spot at that point. They had so many injuries that year coming off the Super Bowl. And for like, for us to like both come into it at that, the timing was perfect. Yeah. Like I needed that to go out and like say, screw it.


Lemme go find the fun in football again. 'cause the, the two years prior weren't so fun. Yeah. Like the last year in Cleveland as banged up as I was like looking back, like everything I truly believe everything happens for a reason. Played through injuries and whatnot. Like, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't change it now, obviously, but in the midst of it, should I have probably gotten surgery and set out. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. But you know what I'm like, I wouldn't change it. Yeah. And, and so it got me to this point and I learned a lot of lessons about, quite honestly, how damn stubborn I am. Yeah. But then getting to LA was that, that started needed and then going to Tampa last year and just trying to meet everybody, get that chemistry going and it's, it's a great spot. Yeah. I understand. Like how, why people wanna be there. It, I remember what was happening with the Browns.


We were saying it at the time, we're like, Baker's toughness is actually hurting him. Yeah. 'cause he, he's so hurt, but he's still out there. And then everyone's like, oh, baker sucks. It's like, dude, he's so hurt. Yeah. No, I like watching the, watching the film from those games like now because after I got surgery I had to re like reteach myself by throwing motion. Like got with a coach and redid everything. 'cause I, like, I manufactured having an arm stuck to my body leg was all beat up too. It's just so many things and factors that I, like I said, hindsight's 2020, but yeah, I was a stubborn asshole. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's damned If. you do damned If. you don't sometimes Yeah. 'cause If you take yourself out and you say, okay, I need surgery. And then people are like, well, which shoulder is it?


It was your non throwing one, right? Yeah. Yeah. They're like, well, I'm getting surgery on my non throwing shoulder. There'll be people that are like, baker's not tough. Yeah. He should have played through this. Yeah. But then you play through it and you're obviously impacted by it. Yeah. And I think part of it was, was partially like feeling like I was a part of the Cleveland community and like the blue collar attitude of like, we're gonna fight through this. It's not like I'm blaming the Cleveland people by any means, but like, I feel like that's just that attitude that we had going into it and everybody kind of embraced it, but yeah. Yeah. I wasn't able to play to the best of my ability by any means. Yeah. So you get out to la I remember that week because I, I think we were all rooting for you. It was such, was it you had four days to, to learn, five days to learn something like that. Oh, It was less. I got there on Tuesday night.


We played Thursday. That's Right. It was a Thursday night game. Yeah. What was, who Was, who'd you guys Play on that Thursday night game? Raiders. Yeah. Yeah. So that's right. What was the process like? You, you land, you get off an airplane and then you just go straight to the facility or what? Yeah, landed LAX, they had a driver pick me up, got to the facility at like 10:00 PM and I've been on East Coast time. It was in Carolina. So it was, I mean, for me it was late. And we met with OC, who's now Liam Cohen was, he's now in Tampa. Zach Robinson and OC in Atlanta now. And then McVay, we sat down for a little bit, crushed some stuff for about two hours. And they're like, Hey, you probably should go to bed. Like wake up the next morning for practice. And they do a walkthrough and they throw me in there and I'm like, what the hell is going on?


Like, they're actually like trying to get me to play. Yeah. And I'm like, at this point, like I'm communicating Emily can't travel out at that time. So I'm like, you don't need to come to the game. Like, there's no way I'm gonna play. Right. It is like, as hours go closer, I'm like, okay, there's a chance I'm gonna play this game. This might actually happen. And then on, on Wednesday, like we did a walkthrough in the morning lunch, and then went back out to practice and John Wilford, who's with us in Tampa now, his neck was all banged up and he couldn't throw, so in the only live sessions they had, like the short weeks are so different practice schedule wise. But the only live sessions we had, I was throwing to those guys. And I was like, okay, this feels pretty good. Yeah. I think I might be able to do this Thursday morning they make me cram a little bit more study and the day of the game.


Day of the game. Yeah. And like, they let me, normally they make the guys stay in the hotel the night before. They're like, Hey, just stay in the hotel, study as long as you want. So in the morning after ride down with Carter, who's Sean's assistant and McVey, we ride down to SoFi together from Thousand Oaks. And the whole way I'm like, shit, let's, let's just do it. Let it fly. Like what, what do we have to lose here now? Yeah, why not? Yeah. Yeah. But like one of those things that I look back on, like, how wild is that? Like 4 48 hours. Yeah. They simplify the playbook at all. Like guys I know, I know. He's got long names for plays. Right. No, I, I tell Sean he's an asshole all the time because he gave me a, they gave me a wristband. He didn't call one single playoff of the band.


And, but like looking back on it, I wouldn't change a thing. Were, Were there points in the game where you call the play and you're like, I think I know where everyone's going. And then it, you snapped, And it, you're like, Nope, that's, that's wrong. But I'm still gotta get rid of the Ball. There's definitely a few times where I'd say the play in the huddle say it Right. And then it'd be like, okay, what does that mean? Yeah. Yeah. Then I got, we break the huddle, you like fake it till you make it type thing. I'm like, oh, okay. I know what I'm doing now. Yeah. Yeah. There was a few times like that. Yeah. That's crazy man. Yeah. And, and Yeah, it did, it did totally rejuvenate your career. Oh, a hundred percent. To the point where it's like you saw good baker again. People know that it's somewhere inside him. Yeah. And then now you've got teams that want you to be their starting quarterback next year. So Yeah. Brought the fun back and like, that's when I'm having fun, talking trash, enjoying it.


Like that's when I'm at my best. And yeah. I, I needed that. Yeah. And it's also, I mean, again, this is nothing against Cleveland because we, I love, you know, like rooting for the Browns from afar. I'm not a Browns fan, but it's like that city wants football so bad. Yeah. But there is a lot of pressure in Cleveland like, 'cause they are so starved for success. Yeah. That it just is probably a totally different vibe than a LA or a Tampa. It Is, it really is. Like in Tampa, like in Cleveland, you get the stories of like, these tickets have been passed down from my great-grandfather. Right. We've had it, we've done this, we've been partying the muni lot for years and, and all that. And in Tampa they talk about like, old sombrero stadium, like the creamsicle jerseys.


Like it was cool that we brought that back. But you, you get, you get some fans like that, but it's just different when you get like those Northeastern teams that are like truly generational Right. Fans. Right. And the pressure of this whole city being like, you gotta do this for us. Yeah. Yeah. It's, that's a lot. So, alright. So this past year I It was great too, watching you play this past year because it felt like old baker where like you were doing shit where you're like, I'm just gonna run the ball and try to like, you know, run over a linebacker sometimes to success, sometimes not. Yeah. But, and like you were just jacked up in the huddle and like pumped up all the time. So did you feel like that, like you're playing some of your best ball this past year In the second half?


Yeah. Second half of the year for sure. We definitely caught a groove there. Like we started out hot three in one bi week was early, and then after that we, I mean, I think we went one in six, like in a seven game stretch right there that it was, it was bad. But we, we finally turned it around. But yeah, it was like, all right, simple is better. Especially with the guys that we have in Tampa, like Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, Mike Evans, we we're a big Mike Evans podcast. We did a whole thing on it last year where we're like, Mike Evans does not get talked about in the way he should be then. The fact that if he plays three, four more years the way he's been playing, he's a top five receiver of all time. No, he is. It's, it's nuts. Like numbers he puts up, like If he, if he has an average year stats wise for his, like his records, he'll still be top 10 in touchdowns.


He's up there in yards. I mean, he's had 10 seasons in a row of a thousand yards. Thousand yards. Yeah. And I mean, I know he is had some good quarterbacks, but also he's had a bunch of different ones. Yeah. Right. And he's, he's the consistent one. Right. And like, he doesn't get that recognition. And like, I'd be remiss to say like LaVonte David as well. Another one of those guys in Tampa that gets no recognition. The dude is a hall of famer. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He's unbelievable. He is. He's so, so good. It does feel like the Bucks have had awesome linebackers for like 30 years. Yeah. Just nonstop. You've got one guy in there that should be in the Hall of Fame. Yeah.

And now here's more Baker Mayfield. So yeah, it was, it was fun. I remember week, was it week one you guys played the Vikings? Yep. Yeah. So there was one run that you had. You, you tucked the ball, you ran, you ran through someone's face and then you got up and you did the, like you kind of flexed and your teammates on the sideline were just jumping up in the air. They're like, yes. Fuck yes. I felt like, at least from the outside when I saw that, I was like, I think, I think the Bucks are in love with Baker Mayfield. I think they're like fully behind them. Did you know going into the season that like you had a locker room behind you ready to run through a wall? Or was it, was there a point? It's tricky 'cause like the whole off season and, and throughout most of camp, I was still in a battle with Kyle Trash to get the starting job.


And I, I think a lot of the guys knew what I was capable of, but they also didn't know what version they were gonna get of me. And the version they got was the one that truly didn't give a shit. Yeah. Like, I had nothing to lose at that point. I'm either gonna be a backup for the rest of my career, I'm gonna revive this thing. Yeah. So it was like, this is a spark plug I needed was like that game one when I'm the starter. Let's set the tone like a, a third down run or something that we needed on the line. Like let's set the tone for the rest of the year of like what type of locker room we're gonna have. Yeah. Swagger back. Yeah. Grab Baker, grabbing his nuts again. Oh yeah. Do you look back at any of those? You're like, eh, I probably should have done that. Yeah. My grandma still thinks I had an itch. I mean, you, you made co like that's what is the best about college football.


I remember when people were freaking out about it because there's such a weird thing when it comes to college sports where be there were amateurs. You were amateurs then not getting paid. People think like, oh, you gotta be real sportsmen. Like, it's like, no dude, they're fucking playing Division one college football. Yeah. They don't like each other. Well It's, yeah, college sports are different now, but like, I still look back like when the, the clips of that and you hear like Greg McElroy, like frat boy Alabama quarterback on the broadcast saying, yeah, oh NFL GMs aren't gonna like that. Yeah. It's like, come on Man. I actually don't think NFL GMs give a shit about that. I think they probably would like that. 'cause it shows that you're like passionate. You got a little edge in like fuck you to you. It it, yeah. It depends on which like how they evaluate. But yeah, like I'd rather have my guy be like that than just like, like no emotion.


Yeah. No, I like to try and please everybody, like do the political stance and the interviews and all that. Like Yeah. Just kind of fake. Maybe Bring back the nut grab one time. That's A bold strategy Against the saints Tomorrow Might rip my head off. Yeah. Yeah. That is true. Yeah. It's a bold strategy. Yeah. It's not Kansas. The saints aren't Kansas. That is true. You did do it against Kansas. Of all the teams, you're like, we know we're gonna put up 50. That's fine. Yeah. I did pick my battle there. Yeah. Yeah. Is it weird that you're SEC Now? It iss A little weird. It's got like, it's gonna take some getting used to. Yeah. Watching like Oklahoma versus Florida, Oklahoma versus LSU. Yeah. Like seeing, like I get the SEC questions all the time about like, oh you guys have to play everybody all the time.


Now. It's like, okay. But like SEC ball is good, but really the consistent ones, Georgia and Alabama LSU has its great years And it has, its not so great years. And then you have the other teams in the SEC and so it's like, it's still competitive ball at that time. Yeah. And like for Oklahoma and Texas, it's, it's about the physicality aspect. Like that's always been the discussion about SEC. It's like you Get bigger on the big the lines. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's the difference. Yeah. And so, and I think it'll help recruiting wise too. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. You're gonna have to do way more like interlock room bets against your teammates though. 'cause I feel like there's more S sec C players'. We don't gamble. Oh Yeah, we Oh yeah. Well, Bets as in like, oh, Gentleman's like you Have to wear, you have to wear like a T-shirt. T-shirt.


Yeah. You gotta wear a T-shirt to a Press conference and then you show fun Bets for The first like five seconds of press conference. You're like, okay, laugh at me. All right, good. And then you just carry on about your day. Yeah, exactly. That's probably another drug test you're gonna get. They're just gonna be like, how can we get 'em another one? How many times have you been piss tested? Like randomly? When we were in 2020, oddly enough when we were really, really playing well with the Browns. I got tested probably 11 times that year. Random. First of all, look at me. Yeah. Right. I'm not a physical specimen. Right. What are we doing here? Yeah, It's Random. Were you on like a first name basis with the guy that comes in? Yeah. That's awkward. That is awkward. Because they gotta look.


They watch the, do they stand behind You? They're very familiar. No, they, they Look at Your, well some of 'em do. Some of 'em don't. Some Of 'em look at your cock, Some of 'em directly stare. They have to watch the others. The others will make sure that you don't have like a Blue Mountain state attachment. Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. Who's The guy on Ontario? Ontario. Ontario. Smith had that. Ontario. He had a fake dick. The Ator. Yeah. Yeah. Fake dick that he put in. And then they caught him with it. He was going through airport security and they're like, TSA flagged it down. They're like, what is this fake penis? He's having fun. Yeah. Do do you ever fuck with him? Like, like if there was a guy who gave me a drug test and was staring at my Cock, no chance. I would just Be like, Hey buddy, you just gonna stand, stand there. You say that now, but like, You're gonna do something about this.


You say that now, but like, the quicker you can be in and outta that place, it's true. True. The better. True. It's also very funny that a guy probably went to college for probably six to seven years. No. To get a degree to get like, you know, into the biomedical sphere. Yeah. And now your day-to-day job is just looking at dudes pissing. Yeah. Stare at Baker's cock. Yeah. What's going On? Is that, is that it? Well, Listen, the guys here all have my cock on film multiple times. So they have blackmail on me. Congratulations. Yeah. Well, whenever we do golf videos and they, they try to get me pissing and I'll just turn around and be like, now you can't use this. So now they have it all. Yeah, We always say that with with Big.


Cat. It's definitely not plaque Though. They're going like their safe code. Yeah. I Mean it's, it's usually Like box 30 feet away, so you probably can't see anything but it Technology nowadays though, it's What I use. If I ever wanna like Sue Barstool be like, this is my employer, Like flashing Dick at me as I'm flashing dick as I'm trying to do my job. What happens? If, You don't have to take a piss. Oh. Like there's a, there's like a window that you have to get it done in And. It can't be too diluted. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So you can't just say like, I I don't have any pee. I just peed a second ago. No, they'll wait. Damn. What? The whole time they're staring your cock? No. Like you, you'll leave. That'd funny. If they stand for three hours, This is when they just feel awkward and they like turn the faucet on.


Yeah. Ooh. Soothing sounds. Yeah. You try to piss so hard. They just shit yourself. Do they leave at that point? Do they watch you get cleaned up? I do. I do have a old teammate that we had a drug tester that really thought like his job was the most important thing in the world. And this one teammate on purpose would only go do his drug test when he had to shut. That's awesome. Oh, I'm trying to to think who that could be be. That is so great. Oh man, that is so great. It was The first initial. I can't, I can't do it. It Was, it's a good move though. He's a, He's, yeah. That's Funny. He's turned his life around. That rocks. Hey, you saw UFO?


Yeah. Like for real, For real. What? Tell us. Okay, so driving home from dinner. Where? In Austin. Okay. And it's like when we're driving home, we're about to cross the dam between Lake Travis and Lake Austin and we're looking like, basically looking out. It's, and like it's really dark out there. And literally like, we got this, the screen on the car's real bright. Yeah. And so Emily's in the passenger seat. She's looking at her phone, this like, like circle shape object. Like bright as hell. Literally just goes from right here and goes straight down.


She was looking at her phone, you know how it was like if at night, if you're looking at that and your eyes don't adjust to light, it was so bright that she looked up and saw it too And. it just like disappeared. Like completely disappeared. Holy shit. And so I put that out on Twitter. Yeah. People thought I was hammered. No, I believe you. No, I was just driving home. Right. And not under the influence either. Yeah. And you're An Oklahoma guy. Not an Oklahoma State guy. That's good. That's a Big, it's a big Difference. That's a good 1000 times. Mike cte. That's, that's, that was nice. But there was other people that reached out afterwards and said they saw the same thing. Whoa. And. it wasn't like we were facing towards a Tesla factory. They weren't doing any weird shit. Right. We were facing out like out to the country.


Damn. So when you got home, were you like, I I would've just been buzzing. I would've just been talking about the, the UFO nonstop for the next week. Like you saw aliens Well Thought I was crazy at that point. Yeah. It's like covid and you thought it, I don't know what was going on. Yeah. I mean, If, You say you saw a UFO. People are just gonna be like, that's crazy. A vaccine hit him different. Yeah. Right. He's he's never been the same. Yeah, that's, I mean that's pretty cool. I wanna see a UFO. I really wanna see one. Yeah. I've been, I've been telling myself every night I look up at the sky and I try to find one. I've never seen one, but maybe it's 'cause I'm looking for one. Just has to happen to you'll, they'll find you. One day I got a a weird question for you about your time in Tampa. Okay. You're offense coordinator Dave Canales.


Did you ever read his book? I did Not. Did you know that he wrote a book? I did. Yeah. Did that never came up at any point. Came up initially. He owns it. Yeah, he owns it. And like, I respect him for it. Like I didn't, I didn't know anything prior to meeting him. I didn't know anything about him. Yeah. But like the fact that he owns it, he's upfront about it. No, I never read though. Yeah. Do you think it, he could have just done it in therapy and not written the book? Yeah. We were joking. Like if I were him, I would never just, I would never wanna be a head coach. 'cause then everyone would be like, wait, what's that book? Yeah. But I think that like the approach that him and his wife have about it, like If they're open about it, then Yeah.


Like teaching lessons on it. Yeah. And like yeah. It's like it's a part of their story. Yeah. You Know. Yeah. I don't know. How do you think he's gonna be as a head coach? Good. Like he's very relatable, smart guy. He's got, he took our receivers coach from Tampa with him to be the OC Brad Izi really, really good football mind. And I just think like those two guys together, like around Bryce is gonna be good for him. But Dave's got like the definition of an optimist bully. Like it could be the worst day ever. Everything could be going wrong. And he's sitting there, he is like, guys, I got the next play. And like he's got a big old smile on his face and you're like, this guy's full of shit.


Yeah. But no, that's literally who he is. Yeah. Day in and day out. And like, it's honestly refreshing, especially in that industry. It's like coaches are always negative, like picking apart everything. But he's, he's complete opposite. Yeah. He seems like a good dude. I mean it's, it's cool. Anytime like you start getting the wave of younger generation hires, it's cool. 'cause it does feel like that's happening right now. Yeah. It's, but it's also the old school generation's so entertaining to watch. I know. Yeah. You need, we need to figure out who the next like grumpy, like Yeah. We need some more fat coaches. That's something losing You haven't A fat coach in a long Yeah. And Gino back. Yeah. Right, right. Like we got Andy Reed, Mike McCarthy. But like, We can do better. We need some fat guys.


We can do way better than that. Yeah. It's just, It's more powerful football. Get some guys to put on some weight. Yeah. We can get on a strict diet. Yeah. Let's get some fat coaches going. Yeah. Why not If, if the coaches are like, you know, too young, too cool. Too much a player's coaches. Do you ever wish like, I just wish like Bruce Arian would walk through that door and just chew me out. Just like call me a dumb motherfucker. A good ass chewings good for everybody. Every once in a while. I always say that I have always, Everybody needs one. Yeah. Yeah. You might not like it but you need it. You need It. Yeah. You need it. Just a Reset. When was the last time you had your ass chewed? Like really, really chewed? Yeah, really chewed. Like really in depth. Really chewed. Like went in. Yeah. Oh yeah. You thought about it for days.


Todd Haley. Oh. Oh Yeah. That's a classic to Haley. Yeah, he's, Todd Haley had some really good ones my rookie year and yeah, he, he tore me apart. Yeah. Todd Haley's a, he's a motherfucker but like in like a football guy way. Yeah. But he did it to everybody. Yeah. It wasn't like he would pick it it personal unless you just like didn't give a shit. Yeah. That was the only time he would like single you out. But yeah, he would let you know. You're pretty damn stupid. Yeah. He's a, he's a football guy through and through. That's for sure. Todd Haley. That's a good answer. That's probably the last, yeah, that was the last really good one. Yeah. Do You Greg Williams, Greg let the offense, like when they got rid of Hugh Jackson and Todd, Greg kinda let the offense do whatever and Greg Greg's sick in the head.


Yeah. Oh yeah. Like he loved the fact that I was psychotic. Loved it. Yeah. He was like just Yeah. I love that shit. Just keep doing it. I've heard that in practices he, he sometimes to the detriment of the team, if he's coaching defense, he'll just send crazy ass blitzes when the offense is trying to like work on something. Yeah. It's, those are the worst kind of coaches. Yeah. Like the ones that like script read and take all that stuff and try and win and practice. Yeah. It's, first of all, it's not getting your defense better 'cause you don't know what the offense is gonna call in a game like, but yeah, he, he likes to bring a lot Of pressure dial. I Definitely do that. Yeah. Just dial I guess someone who, the minute I realized like in sixth grade that they had half of the answers in the back of the book in math.


It's like that's when I stopped learning math. But Then, but then in the test when you don't have the answers, what do you do? I just Be really bad at math. But It's kind of different in football because you want, you want that confidence. So in practice If, you give your guys the answers. Yeah. Then they feel like they're super human. Yeah. I can see how that can translate. Yeah. Yeah. A little confidence. Does that work for the bronze in Cleveland? Might not have that broad Deal. You know what it kind of did. Yeah. We turned it around. Wound up seven, eight and one. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. They had, they won one game in two years prior, you know. Sure. It worked. Yeah. That works. Do you ever, your current coach Todd Bowles, he's not a yeller. No. Do you ever want to like, shake him and be like, dude just yell at me. No. 'cause he's like, he's got some sly shit talking.


Oh, I like That. Under his breath. Behind the scenes. Yeah. Because Like they'll show Todd Bulls on the sideline and he just won't be talking. Yeah. And I know that it's, He's so even keel. Yeah. He's Like, he, I mean he is one of the smartest defensive minds we've ever been around. It's amazing. Like going up against them in practice. But like then his nature though, he is just Yeah. The whole time. Yeah. And it, it never changes besides when like he's giving the defensive guys a hard time or somebody else, like in team meetings, it's, it's funny. Do You think it would fuck the team up if he like just did like a Bob Knight type of tirade at one point? Like what's wrong? Good. Bobby Knight. Yeah. He throws a chair and he's like, listen guys, I've been holding this in for 50 years. A lot of built up.


Yeah. Yeah. Testosterone There. You know, you guys are the ones that finally made me snap. That One I've never yelled in my life. That Might make me feel guilty. Yeah, I know. I think it would fuck you up mentally. Yeah. Yeah. That so bad. We pushed him to this point. We did this for, I forgot to say congratulations on being a dad. Thank you. Do you feel like you are stronger? I did have some dad strength. Yeah. Yeah. You like have, you can do that if you're like, 'cause I have three kids in like, I, I can like put myself in a place where I think about my kids in danger and I like get that adrenaline boost. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm always one of those guys that like, and I know my friends are gonna listen to this. Like, I always have the conversation about like a pack of coyotes coming at us. We always have the argument about what kind of animal we could take.


Yeah. Coyotes had fuck up like Right now. Yeah. Come on. No problem. They're easy. We saw a coyote like two days ago. Gimme 12 Of them. Yeah. It was a, it was a bitch. Well what you'd fuck up one and they'd all run. Yeah. They'd be scared as shitless. Yeah. I mean you scared the rest of the pack. Yeah. You single the big one out. Yeah, we saw a coyote. I was, I was ready to take it. We were playing Frisbee golf. I called it back. US only, only thing you can do. Yeah. It started to walk away. I how I howl at. Yeah. Little tree. It stopped, it looked at me and I was like, come on, bring it. Yeah. I just walked away. What's your move if you're doing that? A coyote? Yeah. I kick everything in the nuts. I'll tell you what I do. Yeah. And here's what you do. You wrap your, you wrap like your shirt around your arm. Then you hold your arm in front. Make they make them bite your arm. I think you took that from a direct like canine police training video.


Yeah. I've watched a lot of videos of that Detroit urban survival guy. Yeah. So I'm pretty good at that. Yeah. They hold it up and then whack it in the nuts bunch times. No, you, you grab it by the throat and just snap. Its windpipe Right in the trachea. Done. Yeah. Done. Pete is also also gonna be after us, bang after Us. No, no. Coyotes don't, aren't protected by peta. No chance. They're, they're, there's definitely some animal like pigeons aren't protected by PETA raccoons. I don't think. What Like, what's the point of mosquitoes either. Yeah. Mosquitoes definitely not protected by they in Florida. They're starting to really piss me off. Ticks. Ticks are the worst thing in the world. They literally exist just to like kill people. They've ruined the term. Lyme for me. Lyme disease. Yep. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Just like Corona did with Coronavirus.


That's true. A Corona and a Lyme used to be the most refreshing thing in the world now. It's a virus and a parasite. Yeah. Kill you and make you tired. It stinks. What a Shame. Yeah. Real Shame. Real shame. Alright, So has your life changed, like having a kid, do you feel like maybe this is gonna be, maybe this will be your best season yet 'cause you're playing for something bigger. I do. And like, like last year I feel like there was definitely extra motivation but just, I don't know, it puts everything in perspective too. So it's like how do you balance? Yeah. Knowing that there's other things outside of football, but also how am I gonna support this family for the rest of their lives. Like also It's a, it's a mind fuck because everyone tells you what to expect and then when it happens you're like, yeah, well that changed everything.


And Like timing wise, like she was born early April like couldn't have been a better time. Yeah. I don't know how people do it in season. 'cause like you wanna be there, you wanna spend your time, but also you gotta pay the bills. Yeah. Yeah. All my babies were born in the off season. Yeah. I wouldn't, I wouldn't. No Shit. What's true? What's the season for you? The season for us is late August till end of the NBA finals. That's like the very busy season. So it's pretty Much, so that's like, so this is the off season Right now. So that's like till mid-June? Yeah, It's 10. 10. 10 months. Yeah. We're in the off season right now. We're In the off season. We're in the off. We're in show but We're in OTAs. Yeah. This is OTAs, right? Now. It's A long season. Voluntary. You guys showed up for this?


Yeah, we did. This is yeah, phase me. This is us. Yeah. We're we're good to go. She's doing It. We're doing it. There is, there really is. No. Did you plan that out? Like, we're gonna have her baby in the off season? No, I didn't. We didn't plan it. We tried for like a year and a half and she's actually, we think a Tahoe baby. Oh, Chill week We came back to the scene of the crime. Wow. You're more fertile out here. Oh, Elevation. Elevation. Yeah. The the sperm swim faster. Yeah. I Got in the cold water. Put a little Michael Phelps on That might have something to do with it. Yeah. Yeah. But now you gotta think about like your daughter someday listening to this. She'll know she was In Tahoe. Yeah. She's gonna be the chillest baby ever.


Yeah, I'm definitely Tahoe baby. Yeah. Yeah. Because I have that happen creep in my head every now and then. Well pretty much every day. But I just block it out. Like they'll watch everything and it's gonna suck For me. It is scary. Yeah, it's, it's Scary. I'm not gonna be able to tell 'em to like, I'm not gonna be able to say like, Hey don't do this. They'll be like, what about this why You did this? Yeah. Right. Like you did this on camera. You think about that in the game when you're like play, you're getting crushed by the Ravens in Cleveland. One day my future unborn kids are gonna watch this game film. Yeah. Dad, dad stunk it. Football Dad got his ass beat. Yeah. He's a tough motherfucker. I have Do you, are you aware of Steven Cha? I'm not. Okay. Buck Super fan. He actually, they, there was like some graphic that was like the most famous fans for every team.


Okay. Dick Viel won for the Bucks and then Stephen Sha photoshopped himself over Dick Vitale, which was pretty rude of him. Especially 'cause Dick Vital, I think is battling cancer again. But Stephen Shaa, he's, he's a crazy Bucks fan. Okay. Watches film. He's very well known in the Bucks community. I asked him for some questions. He Watches film. He does. He doesn't know what he's watching. So he watches. That's what I love about the super fans that watch the Film. He works, he works for Barstool and when he started working for us, he was doing like ad operations. So he was very much on the business side, but he would still break down Buck's film for himself. Yeah. For Nobody really. For no one. He Had the software, he would like highlight guys and then somebody saw, like one time he posted a a a clip and we're like, why are you doing this Steven?


And he just always has. And He only posts good film like If, you guys get killed. He'll just be like, watch this, watch this guard get off. He's like, wait Steven, the Bucks lost like 30, 33 to two And. it is like, what the fuck? Yeah. God bless you Steven. He's, he's the best. He actually did say, feel free to show him this pick of us from the camp with the Jets last year. So there's the pick. Remember that Guy? Oh he's got a lot of energy. Yes. Yeah, He's, yeah. He's got a lot of energy On. Yeah, he's, he's done Make-A-Wish with the Bucks. He's not sick or anything. He had a who, who threw him the, was it Ryan Griffin threw him a pass. I'll, I'll find the video for you and show it to you. Oh boy.


So anyway, Stephen Shaa, diehard Bucks fan. I asked him for some questions. He said the first one was the Bucks actively sought out your opinion on their open offensive coordinator position this off season. Even though you were a free agent. What did that mean to you and how much did that influence your decision to stay in Tampa? Pretty good question. That's a great question. Yeah. Kind of a loaded one too. Yeah. Yeah. Steven coming with the hard ones. Yeah. Like it was fun during the process but also like, I'm giving them input on like what I think we need similar, like a similar system to what Dave had and to like to benefit my attributes and we go through this process and I feel like it was always a circle.


Like we'd go through that. I'd give him my input. Then also I'd take a step back and be like, wait, I don't even have a deal yet. What am I doing here? Yeah. Right. Like let's, let's do this. But I think part of it was them trying to get input, get the right guy in there that making it more enticing no matter what the deal was that was offered. but it, like it did mean a lot during that process. 'cause that was the first time I had been asked about Yeah. Anything. Yeah. And, it wasn't like they're still gonna make their decision however they want to. They're probably just letting me feel good about it. But That counts. It Does. Yeah. And like and and knowing that I had worked with Liam before, I think that was a big part of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that that it's, it's cool when a team does that because it's like why wouldn't you?


Your quarterback is your most important position. Yeah. Why wouldn't you want to at least hear even If, you don't use it, just hear what they have to say. Yeah. And like and, but just the questions about what type of system, what type of guy I thought we needed. Yeah. Like leadership wise, system wise for our skill players, for our line. 'cause I mean we were so bad at running the ball last year and so like how is he gonna improve all that and like that that input I think, you know like they obviously did their own homework but found out that he was the right fit. Yeah. So During that process, were you talking to other teams yourself? No. Like wound up signing right before free agency started. But like you like all the rumors that go around, like agents talk, everybody talks.


Like you see some things like I thought Atlanta was gonna eventually offer a free agency came but then they signed Kirk before that and I thought Minnesota could be a a chance like that. Like you just never know. Yeah. You never know. That would've been funny. If, you gave the, the bucks, the shittiest offense coordinator that you could find. You're like, yeah, I really like this guy. And then went to Atlanta. That would've would've been an awesome move. That would've been smart. That would've Been a good one. Yeah. Alright. Here's the other question. This one is weird. Steve. All he cares about is, is football. So, okay. He, he only gets his news from Adam sch like when Ukraine and and Russia were going to war.


Steven didn't. Threes or sixes? These are eights. Lucy Breakers four. These are fours. You want one Shout out Lucy breakers. Russia. Yeah. So Ukraine, Russia happened like he didn't find out for three weeks 'cause Adam Schefter didn't tweet it. Like that's the type of guy he is. Like he doesn't know world news unless Schefter says it. Okay. Because he just, that's how Lockte in he is on just football. Okay. So he said I heard a rumor. So Shefter is his favorite guy in the world. He said, I heard a rumor that you and Adam sch are very tight. It's rare in this day and age for a news breaker and a player he reports on to be good friends. How did this beautiful friendship blossom and what are your favorite qualities about Chefy? Did he just do an ad lib, like throw in the adjectives in there? This is A real question. He said what Beautiful friendship Blossom.


Yeah. And also what are your favorite qualities about Adam Schefter? I mean he's a weirdo. I'll say Steven's a gem. Yeah. He is quite something. He's quite Something. No, Adam and I actually are close. Okay. That's Accurate. So he got the rumor right? Yeah. He got the rumor. Right. Favorite qualities? Favorite qualities? I think Adam's, he's just like, as much as they do the breaking news stuff like If, you have a conversation with Adam. If's one of the media members. You can actually trust that if it's off the record Yeah. It's not going anywhere. Yeah. Like he actually will keep it close to the vest. Yeah. I think like, I think a lot of those guys that are like high up there, you got like Rappaport or Pel like those guys.


I think those are the qualities that like, 'cause Adam was doing it before anybody. Yeah. And he's just, he's done it for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we love Sheft. We have him on once a year at the combine. He's a good dude. He is. He gives A great dude Christmas gifts too. Yeah. Are you on The list? He sent us baby gifts too. Christmas gifts, everything. Nice guy. You get the blanket this year, You get the blanket. Oh yeah. Oh Yeah. I was a little confused by the blanket When we got it. I was like, what's Going on? It had a giant S on there and then I thought, did Adam Shefter send me a blanket with his initial on it? Yeah. Like he said he sent that to everybody. But no, yours probably had an M, right? It Did, yeah. Nice guy. Well baby name. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. but it was, yeah, the whole thing. He's, he's the best. He sent us cookies the year Before and he's got his daughter doing interviews like on the field after games.


Like when we with the Rams we're playing the Broncos on Christmas day, she was down there doing a interview for Nickelodeon. Yeah. Yeah. It's Very cool. I mean that, that's also nepotism. Like come on, what are we doing? Dude, Bro. Think it was, it was like Noah Eagle on the call. Yeah. Right. And then yeah it was Adam Sch started Brony was playing quarterback. Yeah. It Was great. What, what about physically, what's your favorite physical attribute about Adam? Adam sch your best friend. How like just proportionally sized to fit in my pocket. He is Just, You can just keep him right in there. He is Like If. you stand next to him. You're a six three quarterback all of a sudden. I feel enormous. Yeah. Yeah. Like Josh Allen. So, so we actually we're on your side about the whole, like you're not, you're actually not as short as people say, but what they should do is they should measure up to the eyes for quarterbacks.


Yeah. 'cause anything above your eyes is wasted space going into the draft. Like I don't give a shit if my quarterback's got a big Forehead. Okay. So Peyton Manning. Yeah. How tall is he? Big forehead. That's true. How tall is he? Six? Not that tall. No. Four. No, he's like, he's like five 11. Well, by the eyes. Yeah. Right. Yeah. If we're going by the eyes, Peyton Manning probably five 11. Yeah. Yeah. Tom Brady. Five, probably five, six feet. Yeah. Six feet flat. I don't know what his forehead Looks like. Right. Now. it changes every other week. Yeah. That Was, that was me. Should have said that. Did you get Tom Brady's locker? I think so. Oh yeah. It is. It is. Do you leave anything behind But like also it's a locker room.


Like you gotta replace guys. Yeah. They can't like put glass over it. Like don't touch this. No. Did he leave anything behind or was it just clean? No, there was no avocados left. Yeah. Was it, was there any weird pressure like stepping into Tom Brady's like this used to be his team A little bit, but also like the team that they brought in around him. Like he had a huge thing on the free agents and like a ton of veterans that Super Bowl run like that. Those end years a little bit. But also like, I'm not Tom, I, I don't play like Tom, I just can't be him. Yeah. That's what I always said. Just be the best version of myself and let that ride. Yeah. That is cool though that you got a locker room that had guys that he hand selected to bring in there.


Yeah. Like, yeah. Yeah. Good situation. Yeah. Alright, well this has been awesome. I got one last question.


Rollback question. R-H-O-B-A-C k.com. Yeah. Promo code take 20% off QIPs Polos. Hoodies, joggers shorts, bathing suits too. Rollback dot com promo code take.


It's been awesome having you back on Baker. Like I said, I think it's been five years we've had you on. I think this is a third time. You are. I I love that you, I feel like you're a type of guy that you have a circle and then there's people who talk shit about Baker and you're like, fuck you. I'm you're out. Was there ever a moment that we were out? No. Okay. Good. Really? No, I thought was, there was just a moment where I was just like, I'm not doing any That's fair. Anything Extra. That's fair. Because yeah, there was a moment where we were like, are we out? I don't think Guys Are Out. I think we were, We're outta the circle. I don't think we ever said anything remotely negative about you. We've always been like Baker Mayfield fans. But the problem we run into sometimes is the Barstool Sports main account. Yes. They will, they'll not our fault.


They'll Fire off. Not our fault. Oh yeah. The the, the Dankest memes left and right after a game. And then sometimes we've got, we've got players that we're friends with that are like, Hey, what the fuck? And we're like, sorry we don't control that account. Dion actually texted me the other day, was like, what's this story you guys are writing? I was like, dude, I haven't blogged in 10 years. Yeah, We like that. Yeah. I think you got a bunch of computer nerds sitting behind there writing articles for clickbait stuff. Yes. Yeah. We got a lot of that. But like my, my approach on it was just not to do any huge interviews. Just like let this whole thing pass over. Let people know that I'm stronger in the end for it and still the same person. Smart Approach. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Good. I feel good. Remember when you beat filling the playoffs this year? It's pretty Sick. That was awesome.


Pretty sick. Oh hey, what happened with your Oklahoma statue? I kind of fucked that up, huh? No, I mean There are really no good statue field. Good story on that. Okay. It's better than If. you can, I don't know if they'll have a picture of it online, but they have all the all Americans plaques outside If. you look up Mark Andrew's plaque. It's the most fucked up thing you've ever seen in your life. Really? It's so good. This is, see, the problem is, I think what they had to do is they had to break the mold of statues and have it be a red headband because If, you look at it from afar, it looks like you just have the shiniest biggest forehead ever.


That's the problem. 'cause they have their, your headband on there. Yeah. That's I think what I was thinking, It kind of looks like you look like a, a player from the 1940s in the statue. Yeah. You look, it's weird having a, a statue of yourself where you're alive. Like It's enormous too. You kind of look like T 1000 from Terminator. That's cool. That's pretty sick. Yeah. All Right. All right. I'm coming around around on the statue. It's a little, it's a little pissed. They didn't make Kyle's miniature, but Yeah, this, this is, I don't know. That would've been great if it was Kyle's miniature. Yeah. Real strong chin in that one. Yep. Ears are flaring out a little bit. T 1000. Yeah. That's kind of cool now. All right. I'm back on the, I'm back on the statue. Alright, well Baker, it's been fucking awesome dude. Appreciate it guys. Love having you back on the show. It's good to be back.


Yeah, let's not do, let's not wait another five years. Okay. I, I'm sure you know what, next time we'll bring Steven with us and he can just Is he gonna talk the whole time though? Yes. Unless we tell him to shut up. If he, he's coachable though. If. you tell him to shut up. He'll shut up. He's receptive. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I do have one more question for you. Since we were talking about babies earlier. We have a theory on this show. Okay. That when a, a player, like a wide receiver, a tight end has a kid, especially if it's their first baby, they're way more likely to score touchdown that week because everyone in the locker room's like happy for 'em. You know everyone's saying like send best wishes to 'em. They show up for game day. Different mood. Congrats on the baby. Does that, does that calculus ever enter your brain For like receivers and setting?


Yeah. You gotta get him the ball 'cause of the baby. No. Okay. It should. Bad teammate. Maybe it was good that he said that. 'cause then it's not gonna change the odds But Now it. Yeah, we know The truth But now it's actually in his brain. That's another pistol for you. Alright, thanks Baker. Appreciate you guys.

Okay, let's wrap up the show. I have two Monday readings for you. One's a tweet, one's a Reddit post that I came across. Someone tagged me in it saying Monday Reading, which I agreed with. The first is a tweet that I want you guys to just give your reaction for. This is from, so Nate was in the World series of poker cashed, congrats to Nate, our guy Nate seven 17. I funded him. He cashed and we're proud of him. It was a hell of a run. But anyway, my algorithm has just been all poker because I was so into his run and just like looking at, looking for everything. This guy Sean Perry, I guess he's a poker pro or something, Sean Perry wins.


He said, did you guys know that Dylan gang runs a very high stakes illegal poker game where he's raking over 50 KA day and there's an illegal prostitution ring happening at the game. The players are paying girls to fuck in the other rooms. And this is Jason Mercer's partner. How alarming. Oh my god, that sounds, that sounds terrible. It sounds alarming. That sounds we should investigate like the worst time ever. I can't, I simply can't believe that's true. Crazy. We should go check it out. Yeah. To make sure that it's not true. It's, I mean, guys are paying to fuck in the, in the side Room in Las Vegas. I don't know where it is. He runs those illegal stakes poker game where he is raking over 50 KA day and there's an illegal prostitution ring happening at the game.


The players are paying girls to fuck in the other rooms. Whoa. Yeah, I, I can't believe that's true. We should go check it out. Scary, scary. Hold On. Can where is it? Can you tell me the address that it is so I can make sure that I never accident? We gotta find it. We gotta Find it. I, I wanna make sure I never, I never accidentally go there. Grit Week, we'll stop it. Okay, so I think we have a spot for grit week. Yep. I think so. Find it. Do some investigative journalism. Alright, here's the Monday Reading. This one is my boyfriend, 26 female. My boyfriend 28 is obsessed with a lantern. He founded a flea market and it's getting weird. How do I approach this? Hello? So my boyfriend and I recently went to a flea market and he found this old style lantern that he absolutely fell in love with.


He bought it on the spot and I thought it was a cute little vintage decoration for our apartment. But now things have taken a strange turn ever since he got the lantern, he's become super attached to it. He keeps it by his bedside and even gets up in the middle of the night to walk around the apartment with it pretending to be an old timey watchman. He'll say things like, all is well or the night is dark and full of terrors and he really gets into character. At first I thought it was kind of funny and endearing as he always had an eccentric style of humor, but now it's starting to annoy me. He does this almost every night and it's disrupting our sleep. I've tried talking to him about it, but he just tells me that he takes his watchman duties very seriously and that it's important for our safety.


The issue is I genuinely cannot tell if he's joking. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How do I get him to tone it down without hurting his feelings or making him feel like he can't enjoy his quirky Interest? That's a great question to ask. Have any of you guys experienced this with a boyfriend before? Guys can't have hobbies. Sounds like he's gaslighting her. Yeah, That's all I got. That's, I love this guy though. Yeah, He's a cool guy. Listen, If, you find something cool at a flea market or you're, you know, out maybe on a Saturday afternoon you ask him to stop into some little quaint antique shop that, that he doesn't really want to go into and then he finds something awesome that consumes his life from there. You should encourage those types of behaviors. Yes. Those hobbies. He's using his imagination Also.


Like playing in the dark is like as old school as it gets. Yeah. Probably get some excellent shadows with the lantern. The dark. What does he say? The dark is night in full of terrors. All is well. Yeah, all is well. The night is dark in full of terrors. Yeah. Sounds like he's doing a good job. It sounds Like he's, he's keeping ghosts away from you, which you be, you should be happy About. I saw, I was just like, dudes rock. This is just, we've gotten to a point where it's like, listen, what would you rather him do like cheat on you or like, you know, go like have a hobby that like completely destroys your relationship with him. Or he could just do his duty as the watchman and check out what's going on at night. At least you know where he is all night long, right? He's walking around around with a lantern in his and if There's, Hey, I bet you If, you heard a clank in the middle of the night.


You're like, you go check it. You're not the one who's gonna go check it. He's gonna go check it. Yeah. He's the guy that's got the Lantern now. He's fully equipped. Yeah. I don't mind this at all. Yeah. So I, I I thought it was a fun little story. Okay, anything Hank are we worried about the tornado Kind of Or to I, I'm trying to remember your like flow truck that you had as to what weather is real. Oh Yeah. You said, did you say tornadoes is real? It was just rain, it was just football. Anything that's gonna, you know, a tornado could affect an over Yeah it could. Yeah. Rain and snow. Never. Not so much. Never. Weather's not real.
