No joke. I think I might have a cane sauce problem. I was act raising canes the other day, getting my box combo, but with extra sauce on the side, like usual, I have an order. When I eat my canes, it goes crinkle, cut fries, chicken fingers, the Texas toast, and finish strong with the slaw. So I start eating and before I know it, I'm scraping the bottom of my sauce. And I wasn't even done with my fries yet. This habit is escalating and I'm 100% here for it. Dip into cane's. Get extra sauce for me, please.

Couldn't be more chill. Extremely chill. Chill. I'm way chiller than Hank. I'm way chiller than Hank as well. Yeah. I think chill is just a state of mind. I don't think that there's a competition. Okay. Well, if there were a competition, we would win. Chill us. That sounds like Being competitive as not chill sounds like something that somebody who's not chill would say Yeah.


Is not a competition. I don't Know this week though, first of all, we we're rookies out here, which has never been more apparent because every move we've made, everyone's like, oh, you did that. Yeah. We're we're leaving the golf tournament before the golf tournament. Yes. But it's been an incredible week. Thank you to the American Century Championship. Incredible host. We've got some awesome interviews that are gonna be coming out in the next few weeks. It was like a dream coming out here. It's beautiful. The scenery, the vibes, all the dudes in the flat brim hats, which I don't know why, but California just does that and they do it better than everyone else. Kids, kids in flat brim hats everywhere. Yeah. We were signing autographs for kids. That was weird. I kept apologizing.


Yeah. Well, we, we, it's funny. I Kept trying to pull away and they kept like, please, please, please. I'm like, you don't want This thi this, this event has a lot of very famous people. We are not very famous people. We're barely famous online and, but everyone's in autograph and picture mode. And if you're walking somewhere with a credential, everyone's just like, who is that? I got a lot of Who is that? Yeah. And then a bunch of kids being like, can we get your autograph? I was like, I don't think you want my autograph. Yeah. They're here to get autographs from like Tony Romo, people that they see on tv, like the, the famous people. And then they see us coming out and then kids come over and I'm like, I don't wanna ruin your hat. Yeah. Like my, my signature makes your hat trash. I signed a kid's Niners jersey, a six year old's Niners jersey.


I was like, dude, you don't want this. And he was just like, yeah, dude. There were Two 6-year-old girls that were like, sign my arm. And I I looked at the parents, I was like, I don't wanna sign your child's arm. Yeah. But here we are. Here we are. Chill week. Yeah. It's been awesome. Okay, we'll talk more Chill week. We'll talk Fire Fest. FIRE. Fire Fest at the end. Because it's been such a chill week. We should start though, with the most important news in sports history. Greg Bur Halter has been fired yet again. We Did it guys. Congratulations. USA soccer is back on the map. We're So back now. As quickly, we're Gonna win a World Cup As quickly as we were back then. We went straight to Clop. The guy that we wanted, the, the great coach. I think he coached, I'm gonna fuck this up. Liverpool maybe. Yeah. Liverpool. Yeah. So he was our number one.


And he has rebuffed us. The United States has been rebuffed by Jurgen Klo. But who doesn't rebuff a first offer? We just gotta come back outta zero. We just gotta go hire and hire and hire Or hear me out. What if we just hire Greg again? Third time's a Charm. He does know where the office is. Yeah. He's, he's like maybe the Jeff Fisher of us soccer. Yeah. This is gonna be the one that changes it though. I think so. Yeah. I think that it can't be worse. No. It, there is something very satisfying. I'm not the biggest soccer fan, but in all sports, when you've been trying to get a guy fired and you finally do it, it's just a very satisfying feeling. Yeah. Because it really is the only way that fans feel like they had an impact, even though he probably got fired.


Not because of the fans, but because he sucked his Coach. No, it was us. It was us. But you can take credit for it as a fan and be like, yeah, mission accomplished. We fucking did it. We got this guy fired. The funniest thing ever was, I think it was late last week, the biggest supporters club of the United States, the US outlaws, they issued a statement officially calling for his firing. Oh no. Which was big. Yeah. Once You lose the outlaws, Once you lose the outlaws, then you're the in-laws. It's over. Nobody likes in-laws. No. It was, it's it's good. It's been a long time coming. I don't know who we're gonna get at this point. What I saw last night when we were watching the Copa America and after the game was over, we saw the Uruguayan players. They went into the stands Yeah. To fight the, the Colombian Supporters.


Yeah. Now's the Palace. The United States will never be great at soccer until our players care enough to go into the stands and fight people from other countries. I had the exact same thought. I was like, we could fire or hire, get any coach you want in the world. It it's, it's the SEC it just means more. Yeah. They, that, that somehow a malice at the palace situation where they were throwing chairs and fighting fans in the stage. At no point was I like, oh my God, they have to stop this. I was like, these guys just fucking care about soccer. This Rocks And. that one dude from, from Uruguay, I think it was Nunez. Darwin Nunez. He was wearing like a sports bra. Yeah. Charging into the stands, just throwing haymakers. And God bless the cops that were out there because they were just standing and just watching.


Like it was a boys will be boys Situation. Yeah. Right. It's sometimes You gotta let 'em fight it out. Yeah. This is how they, this is how they deal with a loss. Yeah. And, and I had no problem with it. And I, I would love to see the us have that type of emotion. We'll, never, we'll never get there. Maybe. So SEC what if we, what if we did the full Ted Lasso experiment and we got like Nick Saban. Nick Sa would be a great coach. Just have him coach the team and then have bring in like an ex's nose guys. Yeah. Have him just talk about football and then have a guy there that's just translating everything that he says into soccer. Yeah. I like it. I like it. Hank, you're Hank. Hank asked if Columbia was gonna play England in their next game. They should. Yeah. Because England did win as well. It's coming home.


They're gonna get killed by Spain. It's coming home though. But it is coming home. But did You see the Killers concert? No. That was incredible. I think that was in London or in England somewhere. And they, they played the end of the game live like on this massive screen behind them. I love that. And then the second the game was over, the killers went into Mr. Brightside and they shot confetti. The entire crowd went nuts. This seems to me like an England team of Destiny. Yeah. I I love watching those videos in England when they just all throw all full beers at each other. Yeah. They're just the best time ever. It's Like the Cubs outfield in. Yeah. Who was it that hit that home Run? Miguel Montero love a good beer shot Grand Slam against the Dodgers. That was one of the most electric moments ever. Yeah. but it, I don't know Spain, Spain's probably way too good for England, but it would be cool to see it come home for once.


Yeah. Yeah. They don't play tick to anymore. They Don't. Well 'cause they got that new guy. Yeah, I heard They don't do that. Yama. This is probably some in-depth soccer. People didn't even know we had in our bag. They don't do the ticky to which Ticky Toka was. That was just like If. you just made an entire offense out of like screens. It Was, it was Phil Jackson's dream offense. It was a triangle. Yeah. Triangles everywhere. Yeah. And it just like bores you to death until they just, they keep passing it until they're standing right in front of the goal. Yeah. That's, that's talking soccer. Okay. Other things. Us men's basketball team played against Canada last night. Bad first quarter, but then we kicked their ass.


It was awesome hearing Bill Rry on the call. It's like Alabama football with them though. Yeah. But Like that with the big Oh, it's closed game first quarter. Yeah. Because the US should never lose in basketball. But there is like a weird thing that can happen with them where they're so talented and the guys aren't like moving on offense. And then you play another team that it's a bunch of dudes that have been playing together since they were in elementary school and they know how to play ball together. I don't think that's gonna happen, but that's what it looked like in the first quarter. And we had Dillon Brooks still trying to be an agitator at even after a loss. I love that he cut through Devon Brooks or Dev. Yeah. Devon Booker's interview just walked right in front of him when he was getting interviewed.


But the big story about USA basketball, Hank Jalen Brown. What About him? Not on the team? And he's upset. He's very upset. He thinks it's a conspiracy by Nike to keep him out. He said, because Derrick White is now on the team. Allegedly. 'cause Kauai pretty shocking news. Kauai got hurt and can't play Well. The Clippers brought him home. Yeah. I think the Clippers were like, we know you, you're gonna get hurt. Yeah. Please don't get hurt. You're not allowed to play. It actually was perfect that Kauai showed up and played in some practices and then as soon as the playoffs started, he's like, I'm out Guys. Yeah. So they brought, they brought Kauai back. Everybody thought Shirley, Jalen Brown. He was not. The first time he did not get the gig.


They're thinking it's because of Nike. Nike because Nike sponsors the US national team. And then Jalen Brown just tweeted out, I'm not afraid of you or your resources. Mm. And then he did, he did the the monocle thinking emoji. He did this one. Hank. Yeah. Yeah. The Monopoly guy. Yeah. Monopoly guy. Or is it the Pringles guy? Monopoly guy does not have a monocle. That's Mandela effect. Yeah. Pringles guy. Yeah. Pringles Guy. He's got the mustache. Does the Pringles guy have the monocle? Who has a monocle Monopoly guy doesn't have a monocle. No. The Pringles guy has a monocle Monopoly guy does. Monopoly guy has a monocle. I Monopoly. I think Monopoly guy definitely has a mono. This guy's talking monocle real quick. Pringles doesn't. Pringles guy just has the mustache. And then Monopoly guy.


What's the monopoly guy's name? It's something like Penny Penny's Monopoly guy doesn't have a monocle. Oh, he does. He does In an alternate logo. He has a monocle Alternate. Yeah. Well like This one. But the classic that's that's, that's a monocle. Yeah. Classic Monopoly guy does not have a monocle. So who's The most famous Monocle Guy? There's no monocle guy. I'm gonna look this up. Ben Franklin. Oh, Mr. Peanut. Oh yeah. Shane, look at that. Shane from the raft. Yes. Mr. Peanut is the number one monocle Guy. Maybe we should bring that back. We should do Mount Rushmore and Monocle guys. I think we just did. Yeah, I think So too. Monopoly guy. Pringles guy, Mr. Peanut, Sam Arnold, Sherlock Holmes. When he couldn't play in that game. Yeah. Sam Donalds. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think Hank?


I mean, I think there's only one ball. I think. Did you Even know this was happening? Totally. Oh, he totally know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're so chill. I didn't know. We've been talking about it for two days. Yeah. We, I have not Brought it up once. Yeah. I mean we definitely talked about it at length yesterday, but that's fine. Okay. Alright. So you, you rewriting history. Oh, That sounded very uns chill of you. I'm not scared of your resources. Hey, just tweets that after every Mount Rushmore, There's only one ball. So I think it makes sense to bring in someone that's, you know, a good defensive player is used to coming off the bench. He's gonna, you know, contribute in ways where he doesn't need to be necessarily a superstar. And I do think there is probably some truth to the, the Nike thing where Kyrie is also, you know, if Jalen Brown's a snub, Kyrie's a snub.


Obviously Derrick White's a great player. I'm happy for him and I think he's going to contribute to the team. But if we're talking on pure talent, Kyrie and Jalen Brown are better than Derrick White. They're both very outspoken against Nike. Coincidence. Probably not. I think not. Yeah. Finals. MVP Jalen. Yeah. Not getting not good enough to make the national Team not Did you see, I I had a, a nice moment. Micah Potter and Nigel Hayes Davis both got in the game, Wisconsin, because it's, so they have the team select, which is like what Cooper flag is on. He Should have gotten the gig. Yeah. They should have brought him Up. Well they, they are playing, they're practicing. But because of Kauai and KD being out, they let the two of them be on the team for the game against Canada.


Pretty fucking cool moment. Yeah. To be like, this is, I got to play on team USA. Yeah. That's like a, that's a Michael Potter scored. Yeah. There was a great moment too. I think it was before the game, or maybe it could have been a day or two ago, where Obama went up to every player on the team. Dapped 'em all up, then got to the coaches. Yeah. And did the very firm handshake. It was the key and Peel sketch to the point where I thought he was doing it on purpose. Yes. Like the handshakes were so rigid and white at the end. Yes. That it was. I it was so funny to watch though. But yeah. Good job. USA you beat Canada. I feel like Canada is, it's gonna be almost as tough of a competition as they'll run into like, some of the eastern European team. Probably pretty good too. France is gonna be good. France will be a problem. France will be a Problem.


Maybe might be suited for the international game. Greece Is gonna be a problem. Greece is a problem. Greece, Who else is a problem? You got Giannis and Fanasis. Yeah. Who else? There's no other problems. Is there Anyone Slovenia out? Serbia? Not in Slovenia. Slovenia didn't Make it. Oh, okay. Wow. Yeah. Lithuania. Luca lost to Giannis. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Spain. Spain. The gal brothers gotta be still doing it. Yeah, for sure. That's for sure. Happening. Cameroon. Cameroon. Oh wait. Oh no, no. We got Are you, are you a birther? What's going on here? You don't think a beat should be on Team? USA? Oh, just, I forgot. Oh, Okay. You think he's ring chasing? He is.


It is. Yeah. Don't You want him beat on team USA though? 'cause like That's, he fouled out in 12 minutes, so it's not like he's gonna help too much. Yeah. It's only five fouls. But that's crazy that he fouled out in five minutes. I didn't realize that. Fucking preseason. Who Cares about preseason? It's preseason. Pre-season. Olympics. Preseason Olympics. It literally was pre-season Olympics. Yeah, but still. Yeah. And Everyone's freaking out about mbi. Who cares about preseason? The game didn't count. Well, I feel like you have to practice like you play. Sounds like you're freaking out about mb dude. I mean, I'm not saying we're chill over Here. You're You're kind coming at us. I'm not, I'm not Chill. I'm not chill. Max, what happened was, Hank just pointed out a fact. Hank is Bad.


We'll put it on a quote card. Hank is back. Bad. Bad. Oh Bad. Maybe bad as in as in Good as in Jill. Bad. I'm bad. It's a bad motherfucker. Bad. Okay. Couple other things. One next week. Ea Sports College football's out Huge. Doug's is gonna come back. I'll release the schedule maybe Sunday, but Sunday. PFT Hank and Max can get in on as well. We're gonna do a little preview stream first. Look five central to seven central, six to eight Eastern on our channels. So we'll be streaming from the office first. Look, you'll get to watch us play the game. I think we should use it.


We should maybe play a couple scrimmages, but we also should like toy around and see what team I should pick. I'm thinking also about like what are roles on the staff would be. Yeah. So I, I want you guys to be like, I, I If you. Anyone wants to be defensive coordinator and actually play the game with me. But also I would love to have a recruiting director so I can blame someone for not getting me the best recruits. That feels like a good role for Hank. Yeah. Strength coach. Strength coach. Yes. That would be awesome. I would like that. Strength coach would be great. Yeah. Okay. So we'll figure it out. But yeah, tune in. We're gonna be doing a stream. It's gonna be a preview stream. Yeah. It's the most anticipated video game I think release ever. It's gonna change how summer's dealt with.


I'm excited to see what the different things you can do behind the scenes are. Yeah, I heard You we're gonna make a burn account. Yeah, we're gonna get, we're gonna guy, guy like that're basically we'll play a couple games, but we're also gonna just kind of get deep into the game and figure out what's going on. Can you choose not to suspend your running back for DUIs? We'll try. Yeah. Yeah. We'll, we'll we will give it a shot, but yeah. Tune in for that. Paul Skeens threw a no hitter through seven innings. So he had what, how many pitches? 99. Nine. Nine Took him out before he got to a hundred. I Get it. But also, fuck that. So Like, dude, he's, he's, he's been in MLB for three months. Imagine if he threw a no hitter. That would be so sick. It seems like they just have Paul s scheme's rules where they like they had the Strasberg rules.


Yeah. Back in the day where it's like If you throws a hundred pitches. That's bad. 99 pitches is good. I don't know why. Okay. So I understand you don't want him to throw 140 pitches, but if you're at 99, put 'em out there for the eighth inning. See if he can get out of it in 10 pitches. And then, then you, you go again. You know, like what, what's the difference between 99 pitches and 110 pitches? There's Nothing. Yeah, there's, well, it's 11. It's 11 pitches. 11 pitches. Yeah. I was hoping that the pirates were gonna throw a combined no hitter. Because that would kind of, that like a weird thing where it's like, oh yeah, you had a no hitter. The team had a no hitter. I apologize for all Pittsburgh fans listening to this, but if I were not thinking about them, I would say that they're saving his arms for when he gets signed by the Yankees League.


Yes. Yeah. So you're saying that, that it wouldn't have been as No, it, it would've is I said a combined no hitter. It would've Been as meaningful. No, it would've been as meaningful. 'cause he would've been like, I was part of a no hitter. But You were, you just said that you were, you were upset that they took him out. I am upset they took him out. 'cause I wanted to see him throw it by himself. But Oh, if I, but if they had, if they had thrown the whole no hitter, it would've been awesome too. a no hitter is a no hitter, bro. You ever think like, there's probably people, I always just think about like the, the, the a hundred people who this is their first episode of Pardon My Take. And they're like, what was that? It's a zero hitter. It just happened. It's a zero. According to Max it would've been a zero combined. Zero. What was that 20 seconds exchange that just occurred?


You don't, like, you can't explain it. It's, it's usually some like deep thing that we have to needle. Some, sometimes people don't even know what we're doing when we do it. Like, like even If, you do listen to the show. Something maybe happened off camera. Yeah. Off screen. And we're just like spending valuable podcast time just making one of our producers lives Miserable. Yeah. Or just valuable podcast time fighting the same fight that we've been fighting for years. Yeah. Just rehashing it because that's what guys do. Yeah. That's it. Is, it really is. The most chill guy thing to do is be like, let me bring up the thing that we fought about years ago and just keep pick it up. Like we've never dropped it. Yeah. I mean, memes have has been on a pip for two years. That's true.


Memes has been on a pip. He's, he, can we tell the story about the David Wells interview or No, max forgot to record one of the cameras and it was great because I was like memes. I was like memes. You're gonna be like, max is gonna be on a pip. The pip's off you. And he's like, no way. This is gonna be hard for me to get big social numbers, so I'm just gonna get even deeper into the pip. He is like, everything just rolls down to me. Kind of true. Like, max fucked up. It's gonna be on me. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it turned out great. That was a great interview. Yeah. David Willis, legendary. He's a, he's a football guy who played baseball.


Yeah. Yeah. Great. Great interview. And then I also had, I found the dumbest hypothetical ever. You guys want to hear it. This was going around the internet yesterday. Office debates. Is Ryan Coh 24 office debate today? Would you rather get handed 30 K right now or play a week in the big leagues? No, pay 30 K. 30 k all day. Like would I rather you What position? Right. You Whatever matter position you would just get. Like if it was, if the hypothetical was you got to be good at baseball and play for a week, but If, you put me on a b on a MLB team for a week, I think it'd be the most miserable week of your life.


No, I, that's no confidence. Dude. You gotta bet on yourself. I would bet on myself personally. You, Dr. Like say they put you out in outfield. You what? What if they put you at third base? Yeah. Bad. You never know. You never know. What if I'm really Sick though? Just every single play. Just being a disaster for you. Yeah. You gotta bet on yourself. You could parlay that into hundreds of millions of dollars. Oh Man. dh. You just have to be dh. Great. No, you have to play the field. No, for this hypothetical dh. I mean, it'd be cool to hang out with the guys, but the guys would hate you after one game. Probably less than than that. But you suck. Yeah. Yeah. Probably less than that. Probably first practice. Yeah. Probably warmups. Yeah. Our, what's my ERA though? If we took it, if we extrapolated what that was against University of Chicago. Oh, I don't know. Oh, I think my era A is what I, I led in two runs.


Yeah. Okay. So over An inning. I have a nine, I have a 9.0. It's two innings. It was two innings. Two innings. So I have a 9.0 ERA. Yeah. That's better than a lot of big league players. There might been an unearned run there too. Yeah, that's true. Good point. Yeah. Oh no, it was a balk shit. Which is probably my fault as a pitcher. Yeah, That is. Yeah. Well it was Jerry calling the dog. Yeah. But I mean, who knows? Just like I, I've got that I irrational confidence sometimes where it's like you never know until you step into a situation. Maybe you're just sick at it. Yeah. ehs, We found that out with wakeboarding. That's good point. Yeah. Wakeboarding video. When is wakeboarding video coming out? Think It's out. It's Out now. It's already out. It is already out. It's already out now. Hank was so chill in it. It was unreal How chill It was. We we're not wakeboarders.


No, we're not wakeboarders. I think we all knew it going into it too. We were like, none, none of us will be good at this. Had no, I I said I think maybe it's not in the video, but I definitely said at 1.0% chance One person is good and it's the last person that any Anyone would expect, Any person is going to expect. But it was very chill vibes. It was. And Hank Hank has definitely got the wake boarding bug. He's, he's like, yeah, he's talking about it. He's thinking about, it might be a Mount Rushmore punishment. If. you have to get up on a wakeboard for five minutes. It'll never happen. Never. It'll never Happen. Hey, either you get up for five minutes. Yes. That, I mean, we talk about irrational confidence betting on yourself.


Yes. I thought I broke my wrist too. Turns out If, you hold on too tight. When you're wakeboarding, you can seriously damage your wrist. I couldn't, yeah. I couldn't open a door. I was trying to open like a, you know, Coors Light can, and I had to ask people for help. Can I? It was tough. It was very sad. I felt like a 80-year-old man. Can I say something? That was very sad. It was probably the most, I've worked my core out in a long time. And last night I googled Which side is your appendix on? 'cause I thought my appendix was about to burst. Turns out my pain is on my left side. My appendix is on my right side. That's good. And it's all just because of weight. Yeah. It's just way. But I was like, there's no way that I'm this sore.


Two days after I must have an appendix about to burst. Well The trick is Hank, you're supposed to keep your arms straight. Yeah. When it pulls you off, you Do have to keep your arms straight And If. you bend your arms and you use too much of your, your forearm muscle. And then you can't open up a, a water bottle After you To keep those arms straight. That's good to know. Straight as could be. Okay. Anything else before we do our Mount Rushmore? We'll get to Fire Fest. Anything else in the sports world? I saw that the Allstar game is gonna have robot bartenders. What? Yeah. Robot bartenders at the Allstar game. If you're a fan, you want a drink, you go up and a, a robot pours your drink for you. Not only does ask The Fox Robot, Are they still gonna ask for Tip? It's not Clus. I would love Cletus. It's probably gonna, yeah, it's gonna spin around an iPad afterwards and ask you for a tip.

I love the Pepsi Wild Cherry. So thank you to Pepsi. We're gonna do the Mount Rushmore sandwiches and every single one of these goes better with a Pepsi. So thank you to Pepsi.


Okay. It's Mount Rushmore time. We're doing the Mount Rushmore of sandwiches. How Have we never done this? I don't know. It's gonna be contentious though. It is gonna be contentious. I think It's gonna be contentious. Well, it's gonna be contentious because I feel like everyone's gonna have a stacked board. Oh. So we're going to have to go at each other's pixel. So it's all time draft. Should We just say right now like hotdog now? Like, Oh, we're doing that. Yeah, That's what I'm saying. That's The only thing thing I Can think of. Like being contentious. I think If, you say hotdog, you deserve what's coming to you. Yeah. Okay. That's a good point. Okay. Free Market. That's a good point. That's A good point. We also need to figure out what the punishment is. 'cause we realize the calling thing is, well, great idea is not gonna work because you're basically illegally taping people.


Yep. So let's figure out what the punishment is right now before we we get too deep into Mount Rushmore season. Or at least throw out some ideas right now. No. Or we at least throw out some ideas that we can marinate on. And maybe we'll finalize it next week. I like, but we don't want to get so far deep into Mount Rushmore that if someone's way behind, they're like, I'm not doing that. I like The idea of sending somebody on a road trip that they don't want to go on. Okay. Like making them travel in the most inconvenient way possible to the worst destination for no reason. Okay. Run a marathon. Fuck no, That's, I'm not doing that. You completely twisted my words on that. Yeah. I'm just thinking of ideas.


Yeah. Walk a marathon. What else we got? Send 'em to the Arctic circle. What if I was also thinking like, what if we all came up with personal punishments that would be good for streams that would take a long time, but also not be like the worst thing ever. So you could like we could all come up with our own punishments. Yeah. And we could modify the other person's. Like I'll put 'em together and then we'll have a group discussion About All And. then we can tweak the punishments and make them all relatively right. Equal. Right. This should be a homework assignment. Right. For Next week, week next. Next week. Yeah. Because I was just, and do Monday thinking About it. Like I would, like if I did like something, some ridiculous like basketball shooting thing that would take me hours and hours and hours.


Like B, f, d probably don't wanna do that. So we should figure out something like specific to each of us. Nah, I think it's gonna be universal. Okay. All right. This is, hey, this is, is no bad idea. Universal Pain. I actually don't mind big cat's ideas. But then we're back. But then we're back to the situation where you get upset because of the hot dogs because Big, Cat and I are larger than you. Yeah. Right. Exactly. You com you're the key complainer of anything. You're always like, oh, you want to do that? Well, yeah, you, I mean, you want to eat hot dogs. I don't want to eat so many hot dogs that I feel sick. I I think we should think about it. You viewers dumb. You've could just been like hole in one stream for yourself. Yeah. We should think for the viewers.


Okay. Yeah. Well you're being really un chill. Your guys. I think Hank just, Hank doesn't wanna do homework. Yeah. And he, he's just, Which is actually to be fair, kind of chill. That Is chill. I mean, look at your hat right now. Oh shit. Not chill Buddy. There we go. Now you're chill. Alright, let's go Mount Rushmore of sandwiches. Who's up first? Max? I'm up first. The standings by the way. Are they are Max is on fire. He's been hot. He's got 15 points. No, Defense is terrifying. I have 14 points. PFT has 11. Hank has 10. Still very close. Yeah. Anyone to Anyone's game? Anyone's game. Anyone? Anyone's game. So that's why we gotta figure out the punishment.


Yep. What if we, what if we did that idea where we come up with different ideas but each person gets somebody else to think of the punishment for Or draw out of hat ideas? No. So like I would come up with punishment for Hank. Oh, Hank would come up with one for Max. Max. You, you, me. Something like that. Yeah. Hank Gold. Two days without complaining Challenge. Impossible. Did you do it? I Think I can. I also kinda like the idea if we did, if we came up with like five or six and we did a buy hat. I like that idea. Yeah. Yeah. We all, So it's like we don't know what's gonna happen. You can't prepare for it. Yeah. We all submit an idea and it's like, 'cause I do think no matter what it is, the punishment should be something that we can easily stream so the people can get involved.


Yep. That's what it has to be. Yep. We should all have one approved idea. Yeah. And it gets drawn at the end of the Mount Rushmore. Everyone Come with two good ideas for Monday's show and then we'll whittle it down to the, the best four ideas. And then those go into a hat. And when we get to the end of Mount Rushmore season, the loser draws out of a hat. Love it. Yep. I love It. It okay. Okay. All right. Great. Alright. Who's up? I'm up. Cheesesteak One. One. Mm.

I had it on my big board as like a break glass in case of emergency. My, my, my board is shattered. You. Wait, did you only have chicken farm cheese taken Italian? I got some other ones, but that was a, a majority. That's Three. That's Three. And. then we will go with BLT. Okay. Alright. Classic. Okay. Never fails. Okay.

Were you trying to make the case that it wasn't a sandwich? I It's 100% a sandwich. I, I haven't said A word but you, you gave us. Alright. Restart the clock. Hank not complaining. I didn't. That's what, that's The gaslighting of America. Hank takes advantage if you're a podcast only listener. Hank takes advantage of you so much because you don't see his face. It's True. There's actually probably someone just who's never watched us. You give Hank hard and they're, they're so mean to Hank. It's like you didn't see his face. Yeah. Go watch the video. It Was a, when I said bacon, egg and cheese, you did A face. I was thinking You did a face when I did bacon, egg and cheese. Okay. I think that's a good pick.


Thank You. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you guys both definitely had it on your list. Yeah, I actually, I, I had that on there, but I also had with the hash brown on it. Ooh. Oh yeah. I like it when you add the hash brown for sure. That's gives it a little crisp to it. Yeah. Alright. This is great 'cause I got, I got my number two overall pick. Wow. On here. You, I thought Banno was your number two overall. I did have Cuban on my list, which is, it's a good, it's a Good sandwich. Banano is A really good sandwich. I'm Also curious. It's not one, it's not first Round. Hey, how many Cubans have you had? So many chef. Are you just in a c banno phase right now though? Because that's the other thing about you. You're a phase eater. Huge phase eater. Yeah. You, when you, I I, I realized this I probably like five or six years ago, I can't remember what it might have been.


Meatball. No, it was steak and cheese. It was steak and cheese. You have steak and cheese every single day for like three weeks. And then I didn't see you with the steak and cheese for the rest of the year. And I was like, what happened? You're like, I like to eat in phases and I just go as hard as I can and then I stop. I'm the same exactly. With music. I find a song I like, I listen to it every day over and over again. And then I just, actually every people are like that with food Too. Yeah. No, I do it a little bit but Hank does it to an extreme. Yeah. Where he like won't look at it for the rest of the year. The movie, I, I watched a movie. It's called Chef right? Yeah. Yeah. Chef. I watched that movie and was in a banno phase for that Makes sense. A long time. So Are you in a banno phase right now? No. Okay. But I'm, I'm open if, if there's good cabs in Chicago, I haven't really tried to venture Out there, but we fall back in. Yeah.


Yeah. Okay. I'm, I'm psyched about this one. Number two peanut butter and jelly. Oh one classic List. Classics classic On in The genre. Yeah. I list and I, I I'd like to stipulate that contains Uncrustables as well. Well, no, no you can't put that on the grass. That's not a sandwich's peanut butter and jelly. Oh It's peanut butter. It's also Not it you and Jelly. It's sandwich and eat two bread piece of Bread. Peanut butter and jelly is so good. Yeah. It's, it's classic. So yeah. Put put that on. Yeah. You should have an crust ball as your pick. A great part of being a parent is getting back into peanut butter and jellies. 'cause you don't make peanut butter and jellies as like an adult. Yeah. And now I make 'em all the time and I'm just little to toasted bread. Yeah. And there's butter and jelly. There's leftovers from your kids. Just grab those pop best We can keep this going. I'm gonna go grill cheese.


Yeah, Same, Same sort of Same sort of. I had those weighed pretty Much equally Nostalgic sandwiches That are really good every time you have, especially chef like you, you brought it up. The Cheese chef, a couple different types of cheese Chef. Ah. And there's different options. You can add a slice of tomato in there. Maybe a slice like that. Was that All melt shop in New York? I used to be That, that Was, that was a big phase of mine. Yep. And then I'm didn't think that this one would fall Turkey club. Okay. Now I I will say a Turkey club has the potential on the low end to be very dry Mayo. I I'm saying on the low end it can be very dry. I I love a Turkey club.


Yeah. Like a Turkey club. I like it more than like, I like a, I Wasn't gonna say I like more than a BLT. Well that's Fine because Turkey, Turkey Club implies that it's got bacon on it. Oh yeah. Yes. That's yes. Yeah. You take a BLT with Turkey club. Yeah, Turkey club club sandwich. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. My turn. Yeah. I love this ice cream. Ice cream sandwich. Oh, dessert sandwich. Nice. We're mixing it up a little bit. Yeah. Okay. Nice. Love the ice cream. So I, I was in a big ice cream sandwich phase for about, I'd say five years when I was in New York. Yep. Good pick. All right. I'll go Italian beef. Love it. Italian beef.


Yep. What is that? Not a sandwich. No, I was, I was, If I could say anything. Holy Shit. I was just making, I, I thought I, I took me a second to process that was different than Italian. Like when I heard Italian. That's, that's, That's Fair. Hey, hey. That's fair. We're not the The spicy jar era. Yeah. We're nothing but fair on this year. We are fair. Yeah, We are fair. We're the fairest guys. We are Fair. I'm gonna go with chicken club. Much better than a Turkey club. Oh, much better than you got BLT at Chicken Club. I love it Hank. Okay. I love it. I mean, I lost this draft but you didn't. Hot dog. Take a hot dog. Let's go Reuben. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I had Ruben on the list.


I had Ruben on the list. I had Ruben on the List. What kind of meats on Reuben? Like what happened in this draft? I think I have a good board. No I don't. What What kind meats in Ruben? Ruben. Wait, you have Banno. BLTA chicken BLT. Chicken club Chicken. Yeah. I wish I could change that last aspect. Where Would you say this draft went wrong for? Rub is good there Matt. Hank what, where would you say this draft went wrong for you? Going last in getting my top five picks all taken. But how did you not know how Good? Wait a minute. Wait a Minute. Cheesesteak, Italian and chicken parm. Were always gonna go. 1, 2, 3. I was Confu. I there was a second where I like there like I didn't know how this was gonna go.


I thought people would think Cheesesteak was a sub so they weren't gonna take us. And chicken parm too, like a sub as chicken parm is better as, as a non sandwich. Like chicken parm is infinitely better as just chicken par. I don't know. Chicken parm sandwich. Like how often do you order a chicken par? Wait A minute. You were gonna pick Italian Mexican Italian? I didn't think, I didn't think it was gonna, I thought it was gonna get, get to me. You Thought you thought chicken parm and Cheesesteak were like underrated low key sandwiches? No, I just thought you guys might've thought them as sub so you wouldn't take them. He Thought you were, you were talking trash and then you were saying how upset you were that they didn't get to You. No, he thought he, he out outsmarted us. We never would've. He thought out, thought you guys were gonna have more or why would Think that Deli sandwiches to start? I thought he had some hidden gems with Cheesesteak.


Why would we ever think that? I dunno. When we did sandwich, I literally wrote down when we, we were like, we're doing sandwiches. I just started doing a brain dump and it was Italian chicken parm, Cheesesteak and grilled cheese. Those were the first four I wrote down and then went from there. So I have my last. I love you Hank. Others do. You're Chill. You're chill right now. Yeah. You're chill. Thank you. You are chill. Not a food. I mean we've gone over this like You're not a foodie. You, You've probably had a hundred times more sandwiches. You, Every time we do one of the, we're we're just gonna to keep doing Hundred times. We're gonna Keep doing food. Rushmore, every Time you order a sandwich, you order two. I only order one. You're 10 years older. A hundred times. Do the math. That's a lot of sandwiches. A hundred times more sandwich.


A hundred times more though. He's he's How how much older? He's 10 years older. 365 times two. So, So Hank wait, you think he eats two more Sandwiches? He's two sandwiches every day. Hank, Hank. Hold on. So how, how sandwich, how many sandwiches do you think you, how old are you? 31. How Many sandwiches do you think you eat a year? 150. 200 let's Say. Yeah. 200. 200. Alright. So And then we will, alright, so let's say, let's say 200. You think I've eaten 560,000 sandwiches. Half a million Sandwiches. Which would mean, which would mean I'll go same, same math that I eat 15,555 sandwiches a year.


Alright. So it's probably closer to 642 sandwiches a Day. 10 times. We all 10 times. Alright, I'll go, that's my pick. Buffalo chicken soup. Yep. Okay. That was, I love it. That was a good one. It's the best. Those are honestly every time What? Nothing. I can't say anything. I can't Even Exist. What? Yeah, I wanna know what's The problem. What's problem, what's the problem with buffalo chicken sub? That wasn't Joke. No it wasn't. No Buffalo chicken sub's. Great. I prefer the Barbara Barbara cuff. Barbara Cuff. Well I knew you weren't gonna pick buffalo chicken sub 'cause you can't take anything spicy, right? Yeah, I was, I've gotten better at that though.


One of, one of my hungover. I'm a hungover spicy guy now since We were Oh really? Yeah. It it does something to me. Yeah. It you sweat it out a little bit. Yeah, it's nice. We, We were talking about doing two sandwiches. My favorite combo is doing a Cheesesteak and a a a buffalo chicken. 'cause it's like a little something different. See, no I don't do that. If I'm doing two I'll go a hot and a cold. Oh. It's Italian's. Like Italian Cheesesteak Italian. Italian. Italian. Italian buffalo chicken. Yeah. I don't hate that. It's a good order. Yeah. Yep. All right. I'm conflicted on my last one here 'cause I've got a personal favorite that I feel like it might be one of the best sandwiches in the world. Go with it. So I'm gonna go with it Bon me the Vietnamese sandwich. It's so, fuck. I, I think it's rated as like the best sandwich in the world.


I read that a couple places. By who? By foodies. People that like food. But yeah, it's like, it's, no, it's A good sandwich. It's Pork, it's cilantro, it's got marinated carrots. It's got some sort of sauce on whatever it is. It's awesome. Yeah. It's, I would say it's worthy of a first round grade. So this is my, this is my You're calling your shop. The delivers the stone. Yeah. If we know anything though, AWS probably aren't gonna, well I've never heard of it. I mean they were, they were upset that I picked duck. Yeah, that's true. But very upset. If Hank has never heard of it, it's probably good. Yeah, That's Oggy as well. Oggy is Excellent. I know Max isn't gonna pick that. No, I'm not. I I have, I was really hoping you were gonna pick one of my two. I have two in my head that I, there they could be two of my favorite Sam.


Same. They could have been my first pick, but I have to Me memes. You decide which one you should pick. No, no. I I I'm, I'm gonna go meatball. I'm gonna go meatball. Okay. Okay. What was the other one? I should just picked The French Rubin. French Dip. A French dip. Okay. Yeah. You made the right choice. Probably. Oh, a French dip is so good though. But friendship is very good. But meatball is, I should have done meatball instead of Ruben. I don't know why I didn't. You and Max was gonna take meatballs Too, obviously. I was Thinking of Actually the second food draft in a road taking meatballs, I think. No. Yeah. And I've, I've gotten great value both times. Yeah. Alright. With a lot, lot of lot on the board. Yes. For me, yeah. Nashville hot chicken would've been good too. I was the too bad. And the bon me at the end. I Thought about a poeboy po Boy.


Po on I had on there tuna. That's what Shane said. A Tuna salad of The century. A tuna melt. I love it personally. Love a tuna melt. That's a good one. But that won't look good on a graph. Like Chicken salad. Chicken salad is good. Is very good. I don't like a chicken salad sandwich though. I, I'm okay with chicken salad. I love it. With some chips in it. Yeah. So good. A crunch. I do love peanut butter and jelly. I also love peanut butter and fluff and peanut butter and banana sausage. Egg and cheese also would be kind of a cheese cop out move. Cheese. It's like doing like chicken club when someone said jerky club, but that's fine. What about a hamburger? I Mean, I did fucking, I did, I did. I didn't PT did sex like it. I didn't do that to you. Hank, you're not chill right now. What?


Okay, so Max says, makes a comment, but then I make a comment. I Got, I got Your back. I Got your Back. I got it. Yeah, you're Right. Got it. No, I was just saying I was thinking about doings, sausage, egg, and cheese, but it was a little close to a bacon, egg and cheese. Yeah. You Didn't do it. Yeah. Beef on weck would've been good too. Yep. Beef on. We That similar first dip, it's a buffalo. You've been to Buffalo with us. Yeah. I've never got, it's like, It's like a poppy seed. When We go to Buffalo, we only get, we go to wing nuts for, for lunch and dinner every day's. Good point. Pulled pork. Pulled pork. Very good. A a Philly roast pork sandwich is like one of the best sandwiches that you can get. Yes. It Isro So good. Broccoli Rab on there. No, not d Alessandro's. Why am I blanking on this?

Well, deandro is like big is a big cheeses. Steaks, but It yeah, it was very good. Sausage and peppers. That's kind of a, yeah. No, that's kind of hot dog. But it's hot dog. I do. That is a good song. Sausage and peppers. No. Sausage and peppers is DI think it's a little different. It's on a Yeah, because the peppers make it more. Ah, yeah. I don't know it. I, I had it on there, but it's too close to a hot dog hamburger. I was thinking about it. It's the same thing as a hot dog. Yeah. You can't, you can't do it. It's not A sandwich tip of the cap. I also thought Like, How different are subs and sandwiches are the same thing. Yeah. You Still on this? What? I mean, I call it a hogie, but I'm not gonna be the One that, but, but it's crazy.


You're still on this because again, because like Hotdog's the same thing. But Again, you would've picked all the subs. I Know. So you're, you agree with us Yeah. That our picks were correct. But now that you didn't get them, you're like, I'm just, I'm an acquiring mine Also. Banno is on like a subtype role. Yeah. You're one, one. Yeah. Well, once, once the, the floodgates opened and I jumped in, Banno was, Oh, If. you Would've picked that if we had done this draft again and we're like, pink. You get the first three picks, you would've gone Italian chicken parm cheese stick. No, I got my one too. Cuban going in the first. I love a Banno. It's a good, it's it's a good sandwich. No. Yeah, that's fair. Sounds like don't seen Chef. It. Yeah, I've seen Chef. It's a great movie. Panini.


Yeah. Panini sandwich is good. Yeah. You gotta, you gotta say, I like a, like a chicken pesto panini. I was gonna say I like a Turkey sun dried tomato pro. That's a good one as well. Yep. That's a good one. I love how animated Max gets about these food Drafts. Food drafts are great. We should keep 'em coming. Yeah. What about the, what's the sandwich with no meat Loaded Ball era? They're, they're serving on meatballs. Not for Hank. He couldn't What's the, what is it? Is it? Well, I don't even know what the name of it is when it's just fresh mozzarella and tomato cap. Yeah, that's, listen, I, that's the eat meat on every single meal. But that's the one time I'll be like, that's fine. It's The Italian grilled cheese.


Yeah. You get the, get the balsamic. Except For it's not grilled, but it's good. It's fresh taste. Fresh. Yes. Fresh. Fresh. Yeah. Ham and cheese. Not bad. Yeah. Look at ham and cheese. Ham and cheese is one of those ones that like once a year I'll be like, man, I really want a ham and cheese. Kind of like bologna. Oh, I thought you were gonna say cocaine. Well, Mor della has changed. Mortadella has changed the game with bologna. You can get a mor Della sandwich and that's the same thing as bologna. But you, it's Every now and it's acceptable. Like, I kinda want a bologna sandwich. Fried Bologna sandwich. Said peanut butter and fluff. I, I said that. Yeah, I said that said peanut butter and fluff and peanut butter and Banana. Banana's. Good. Yeah. Peanut butter And banana is the leaf. Mayo. Just Mayo sandwich.


Just mayo. So you have BLT mayo. Bbl t's a great pick. There's More than that. You can build around BLT. I did. Yeah. Well, What was it again? Banno. BLT Chicken Club. Reuben. That's a great draft. You guys. When's the last time you had a Reuben? Well, Never. Yeah. That, That's the thing. Like I kept, I kept asking, Hey, what meat is on a Ruben? And he never answered beef. It's Kind of right. No, it's corn. Corn, corn Beef. Corn beef. Right. Pastrami is arabi is another sandwich. Once or twice. A papa pastrami. Yeah. Yeah. Papa Pastramis melted Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard. Are there any, we're forgetting. I feel like lot's, There's probably t big forgetting tuna melt was one that I, I actually thought would've gone in this draft.


Yeah. I love a tuna melt, but there's so many people that hate tuna melts. Yeah. I feel like tuna just gets a bad rap because of the smell. And people, like t is complain about It is great because If, you break out tuna. Yeah, it does. Like you should only eat tuna at home. But eating tuna at home is great. Yeah. Like I I, tuna is a great sandwich. Shane gets a tuna sandwich once a week. Yeah. That he's, he should be in prison. Yeah. Yeah. You can't do that at work. Eat at home. He also, there's one place that he's found that doesn't put it, it's only tuna in mayo. They don't put celery in it. Oh. And he refuses to eat anything with any tuna that has like anything but tuna in mayo. Oh no. You gotta go celery, celery, Onions, Sometimes carrots.


Yeah. He, he like, he gets disgusted when he orders tuna and it comes with anything but tuna. Oh. Another one that's like a, every now and then, like every three months egg salad sandwich. Don't I get like A weird craving for it? Like, I don't like the egg salad Sandwich. I love an egg salad sandwich. I, I thought of it. I Love every sandwich. Goddammit. We're we literally are saying every sandwich. What about, What about pimento cheese? Never had one of those. No. I think pimento cheese is overrated. Never had one. That's my take. I like a roast beef. Just like a cold, Like a, sometimes there's better Cheese. The problem with pi pimento cheese is there's absolutely no crunch or like hard factor in there. It's just soft. Right. Just soft. That sandwich.


Right. Any other sandwiches? We love Max. I don't know. I a A, a regular Turkey. Yeah. Well I was going between that, but a Turkey club just adds the bacon. Yeah. No, it's true's. Just a regular roast beef. Good sandwich. I don't think anyone took just fried chicken sandwich, right? Mm. That was big man. Like a chick Chick-fil-A Yeah. That's a big miss. Yeah, that's actually a huge, huge Big taco. Yeah. A taco sandwich. Taco sandwich wrap. Chota chalupa sandwich. I never had a torta. So subs of different wraps. Wraps are not Sandwiches. I just wanted on the record, you were gonna take all the subs, but because you didn't get one, you're mad. No, I'm just trying to figure out what bread to counts as a sandwich.


And what bread doesn't like a wrap? Like a taco is not a sandwich. Correct. But a sub is correct. Okay. I feel like we've been pretty consistent on that. And again, you would've picked all the subs. I Wasn't, I wasn't. Would you have picked all the subs? Yeah, my list was, yeah. Chicken parm, steak and cheese. Italian. Yeah. What about a euro? Does that count as a sandwich? No. No, It's a wrap. Just like a normal chicken cutlet. Like Yeah. That's, that's one that chicken people Set. I guess it's I guess Chicken club. Chicken Club. Chicken club. Yeah. Lunchables are pretty good too. Lunchables are good. It's crazy. It's just, I just find it funny that like you guys rattle off a thousand sandwiches, but the only one that I brought up, max is like, ugh.


Chicken club. Well Took Turkey Club. You just did that. You, you said why you did that? No, you made me think, like you said Turkey Club. I was like, actually chicken club's better, so I picked it. But it's because PFT said during sex The, yeah. The sax thing. That's why You said that you're hold holding onto this. Well, No, that's like, yeah, it's like there's no, you know, there's, there's clearly no, it's not a gentleman's Rushmore anymore. Well, I Lost, Has it ever been a gentleman's Rushmore? I, back in my day, I at least I used to think it was, Hey, what, What are you, I I lost that because that Or you guys started loading the teams together. Honestly, if I could go back and, and do one thing to change the course of PardonMyTake of my take, my answer would be to never do the pizza topping draft from that moment on.


Yeah. Yeah. Hank has been the biggest baby about Mel Rush Sports season. Yeah. Guys Ruined the integrity of the sport. But we were trying, it's A seminal moment in our history. We Were trying to help you Place a love lost so many drafts in a Row. You guys ruined the integrity of this season. Double Anchovies. No double olives. Double Double olives. Yeah. Hank also just said you stack the teams. Your teammate last year is in first place right now. Oh, that's interesting. Long season buddy. Yeah. But, but like, you, you can't just be like, you stack the team. Like That had nothing to do with the person. It was the two hosts. You idiot. They're still, they're still hosts. Yeah. But then now they, they're on the same team. It's different. That's the whole point.


You just threw My points. Okay. Hank, I think the, I think the comments are gonna say, you're being a baby. I don't Give a fuck. Be a Little baby right now. So did Say it every single day Exist. Someone did say that we're getting along. Like they listened to Wednesday show. They're like, you guys are getting along too well. Like, fix this. Start shitting on Hank.

Shit. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Shit, that's good. We'll take that. It makes us feel better knowing that you guys Yeah. We're funny, but you're also ugly as shit. Yeah. We, I think, I think that's valid. That's valid criticism. Yeah. Blake, I saw you're just on our good friend Staves podcast. That was, that was very funny. And you, he asked you what you were gonna plug. Like, were you there to plug anything? And you said, just think about me from time to time. Yeah. Get, man. Yeah. Don't Forget Blake Griffin. We, I, I'm on board with that message. In fact, I'll, I'll go one further. We're gonna plug Blake's top. Was it like top 48 dunks compilation on YouTube. Oh, cool. Cool. Go watch that. Go watch that YouTube clip of Blake. What, what, what about you, Josh? You wanna plug anything? What about all your work in the community? I'll Also plug his top 48 dunks.


Oh yeah, man. Really nice. This is, but We could talk about your work in the community. We could. Yeah. You did. Did you ever see that clip? The bills? When we were at the Bills training camp last year, they came up to us, the Bills pr They're like, Hey, can we do a quick interview with you guys? And we're like, yeah, sure. And they were like, can you guys talk about Josh's work in the community? And we're just like, yeah, dude. Like he's all, the work he does in the community is incredible. Like, we don't know what you do, But it good. You do great. Appreciate it. I'm like, dude, No one does more for the community. I'm assuming it's, I would actually also like to plug his work in the community. I I would assume that it's good work in the community. Yeah. So we were like, yeah, we appreciate it. But I don't know, after Out there like Bulldozing School. Very good work.


Yeah. He's like, Josh Allen flipped me off. Josh Allen burned down a library yesterday. All right. So we're here for the American Century Championship out in Lake Tahoe. The tournament you can watch on NBC. It's gonna be awesome. How are we feeling about our golf game? I'll start with you, Josh. Feeling okay every year? I've come to this, I think this is my fourth or fifth year. Okay. And I've gotten better every single year. Every single year. Yeah. So just gotta keep Going. What, what's the highest you finished? I think I was like mid forties last year. What Was the lowest? Oh, probably like 90 something. Okay. Yeah. So just, we're, we're looking to improve this year. Thirties. Looking to improve you. You gave me in the thirties. Yep.


That's A good good. 'cause that means I'm probably shooting anywhere from 75 to 80 all three days. That's Good. That'd be good. We'll take that stuff. I, I heard that you were actually getting too good at golf. Keon Coleman said that you're so good at golf that you won't golf with him. That's Keon. Yeah. He's gotta earn his stripes. Yeah. He is gotta earn his stripes, you know. Yeah. He's A rookie. That's Keon man. But you remember Keon? That's Keon. I'll tell you what, if I had a nickel every time, Keon didn't want to play golf. He's a clip machine though. He is a clip machine. I'll tell you what, we went to top golf and the dude can actually swing. He swings it hard and it goes a long way. But you don't know where it's going. Yeah. But he is actually got a decent swing for saying he can't play. Yeah. Keon is, you should know Keon Blake because he's a perfect guy for the NBA to N-F-L-N-F-L to NBA thing.


Oh yeah. Yeah. He averaged like one point a game at Michigan State. And then he was an incredible wide receiver at Florida State. By the way, guys who average 1, 2, 3 are getting drafted. Yeah, that's true. That is true. Don't knock him. Why is that funny? Why Is that funny? No, it's off potential. It is. That is. Why is that funny? That's not funny. That's not funny. That's true though. They, they do get drafted. All right. So Blake, how's your golf game into it? I'm more of a Keyon type of golfer. I, you know, you never know where it's going. Range felt good today, but you looked good. Thanks man. Thanks. Yeah. I need that. I need every bit of confidence. This is my first time, so we'll see. Yeah. But you've been playing, I mean, you're retired, so you've been playing golf nonstop.


I have been playing a lot more. What's your handicap? It's a, you know, 12, 13. Oh, 1213. Did you say 12? 13. 13. But you never know. It's 15. You just might step out there and be sick. Probably 15. Yeah. Yeah. You could just be awesome that day. I mean, listen, I'm just hoping to eliminate double bogies. You know, bogey don't kill you, right? Is that what it is? Bogies are fine. Bogies are zero, doubles are minus two. And Then you pick it up after double a Car is great. Plus three for hitting someone in the crowd. I'm starting negative three. Yeah. You get points for hitting people. Oh, oh, sweet. Yeah. So we're fine. You're you're Good. Also just cheat. There's no rules against cheating. Yeah.


Well I think they're actually, I think all of the rules are against cheating. And golf is like the one sport you're really Not supposed to cheat. Think every, every single rule actually is against cheating because It's probably true. It takes away guys like me who shot a 72 at Shinnecock. It's like, by the way, People don't talk about that. That Thank you. Thank you, thank you. People don't talk about that enough. Thank you. Yeah. It was a hell of a day. I was so impressive. I Was feeling it. I was feeling it. Which one of you guys could play the other guy's sport better? He could play football better. I can't. Did You play basketball growing up? A little bit. Yeah. That means no, through My, through high school. Okay. Yeah. So you, you obviously, you can dunk easily. Play camp more. Not not like him. Not like him. Well, I Don't, well, I could. I'm a rim grazer is what They, they say grazer grazer.


Little fingertip little Finger. Well, I could do a two, like a two hand every once in a While. Have you guys heard about Hank is trying to dunk? I have. How's that going? Some's some's gone away from me a little bit. You wanna talk about Mike? Do you have another Mike? What do you think is holding your back? Holding your back over here?

They don't always have to touch the rim. They, no. Do You remember that against the six? It was like two plays in a row where Chris Paul just threw it up to you. Oh, the back to back windmills.

What do you guys say to oftentimes we get some criticism on this podcast that we glaze you guys a little too much. Oh wow. What do we say to that? It's kind of bullshit because we love you guys, but the haters are always like, oh, you're gonna glaze your boys. You're just gonna say they're awesome. I'll tell you what, I'm a sucker for a glazed donut. Yeah. I'm just gonna say, yeah. By the way, glaze donuts, that's pretty much it, right? Yeah. I think that's it. That encompasses the whole glaze category. We Need something to come back at them though. No. What? No, we don't. That's a good one. Why can't You boost your boys Up though? Uhuh. Why can't you boost your boys up? Yeah. It's Crazy. You know what? Next time that happens, I'll, I'll tweet something. Maybe. All right. Maybe. Yeah. Back us up.


We did the, the glazing accusations were an all time high last year. They're Yeah. They're crazy. All time high. Yeah. And I feel like it's backwards when you talk about glazing. 'cause you know glazing, you can understand what that means. No, but when you're glazing somebody, yeah. Explain it to us. Ejaculating. Oh. Oh, got it. So I Didn't know that's what on a donor Yeah. They're saying I didn't know that. They're saying we're coming. I didn't know that. But in reality, we, it would make more sense if we were the ones getting glazed. All we're doing is talking good about you guys. Put on Some nice like librarian glasses. Yeah. Then we're, we're getting glazed by you guys. Well, this ticket a turn. So actually they've got it wrong turn now. They seem like the dumb ones. Yeah. We seem great. Reverse glazer. Yeah. Alright. I'll ask an easier question.


Yeah. Josh, you very much want to win a super bowl with the bills. Bring the bills. A Super Bowl would be incredible. Have you thought this is a new move? Have you thought about retiring? And then the bills will win a, a super bowl because that's kind of a thing that's going around If, you retire the team, you were last on wins. Sometimes You gotta make a sacrifice. Oh, you, you can answer. But yeah, if That's what it took, I would do it. Oh, wow. That'ss huge for the bills. If I could, can I Yeah. Guarantee it. Guarantee. Because that's what Blake did. He guaranteed it. Yeah. Yeah. I Would do it. I did that. I did that easy. He is like, I'm gonna do this. I love how you said I'm going to, we're going to ease your question. You just shit on me. That's, I mean, that's, that's an old trick of the sacrificed Myself to the pit This last year.


Yeah. Do you respect the pit? I love the Pit. Yes. Feed the Pit. So what's going on with the pit? Can you give like a, a background story out to the uninitiated? So the pit was the, the hole that our new stadium is being built on. So they had Oh yeah, I seen that. Okay. Yeah. And people were trying to get some sneak peeks and every game day, someone got a little too intoxicated, fell into the pit. So This is buffalo, But we, we started going on a little win streak when the first person that fell in the pit. So every game. Oh, that's great. Someone miraculously fell into the pit. This off season, I went down to the pit and sacrificed myself. Yeah. You know what, that's by the way, work for the community. Yes. That's the community. Yes. That's Right. I I think you actually mean that though. When you say that If, you would, if it was guaranteed you would retire.


Yeah, I would. To bring the build of Super Bowl. Yeah. That's Selfless. I feel like I would have a part. Yeah. You'd, whether I played or not. Right. You'd be in the, that's Blake Field the same way. I mean, Did you? Yeah. Yeah. They were like, no, come back. And I was like, no guys, I want you guys to win. It's the hardest thing I ever had to do, Blake. Please. Did you think that it was a little bit of stolen valer that Hank celebrated? Like he had won the championship on Joe? No, That's just Boston, man. You grew up in Boston? Not that I grew up there. If, you diehard Boston fan after being there for a year. I know. They take their sports seriously. That's why they're some of the best, they're probably the best fans in, in basketball. Wow. That's a slap in the Clippers. Fans' face. I mean, they're all three of 'em.


They're, they're most loyal. Yeah, that's probably true. They've been through some dark times. Yeah, that's true. Definitely the most loyal. But Boston fans man can't say enough about him. So no, I don't think it was stolen valor. Hank got your bag, dude. Yeah, He did look awesome out there. I disagree. Yeah. What Missoula is really Don's really? You think it was stolen Valor G Yeah. Go off Josh. He's, He's glazing Yeah's part of the Missoula family. He's getting Reverse glazed. That was laid on a little thick by Hank. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about the fact that Hank went to try to take a, a picture with Christop Ingas and it was actually Sam Houser. Joey Houser. Sam Houser's brother. Yeah. Yeah. I was blackout. I mean, honestly, it's better than one of the other guys on the team.


If, you could confuse two other guys. I don't know. Let's say No, I'm actually, it's fine. But they do look alike. You thought you were taking a picture with Sam and you took one with Joey? No. He Thought he sent you a picture with Christop and he went up to Joey. That's tough. I mean, tall white guy. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out Joey. Houser. Great. Yeah, that's, and Sam, that's, That's a good point by Blake though. If, you went up to like Jalen and you're like, Jason, lemme get a picture with you. Yeah, that would be bad. Yeah. That's why, that's why I brought it up. That would've been, that would've been real bad. Great synopsis. Yeah. Awesome. We to come to that conclusion, Josh, last time we had Blake on, we played a really fun game where we found out that he played with, what was it, six Williams?


Yeah. A lot of Williams. Williams. So I did a little research. What is the last name you think you've played with the most in the NFL? This is our, our favorite game. Blake loves it. He actually asked me to do this again. Yeah, That's great. What do you think? It's a pretty common last name. Brown? No. Mm. Johnson Johnson. Can you name all the Johnsons? Second Guess. Oh, Oh shit. Yeah. Johnson Johnson. Yeah. Guess how many Johnsons have you played with? Good question. Who you looking at? Both of you. Because I have The amount of Johnsons you've played with too. How many?


How many is it? It is Six Johnsons. Oh wow. Six me. Can You name them? You, Blake, you've played with five Johnsons. Five Johnsons plus one. Just six. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So can you name all your Johnsons? Still got it. I got one For sure. Ty Ty Johnson. Okay. That translates to Cock Ray. It's a setup. Yeah. Leaving off a teammate. I know I'm gonna do it. I'm not Screwed. But they, you know, there's a 53 man roster. It's just hard sometimes. Defenders Kevin Darrell. Yep. Darryl Johnson. Jaquan. Jaquan Johnson and Duke Johnson.


What about you, Blake? Can you name yours? Tyler Johnson. Joe Johnson. That, that technically counts if they're on like training Camp Roster, right? No. Nope. You actually are. Oh, for two.

How Long are you guys off off the T? How long? Oh. Oh. I mean if it goes straight I could hit it. 300. Nice. Josh doesn't go straight often, but It straight. I could probably have like 300 maybe a little further. Yeah. I was hoping you went 3 0 1. 3 0 1. Yes. So they got a, a long drive hole out here that they're, they're tracking everybody. You win something If, you get the longest drive. They said Travis Kel last year hit it 360 yards bombed. Holy Shit. Off The tee. Oh yeah. Elevation. That's cool. And he headed far. Yeah, he goes and He's strong. He's so strong. Very strong. He's that. He is strong.


He's so strong. A strong boy. Yeah. Yeah. Strong boy. I don't wanna sound disrespectful, but Blake, I feel like you should be able to hit the ball farther than 300 yards. That's Like, I mean I'm, yeah. Listen, I'm gonna try my hardest, but who knows? I have a little faith in yourself. Blake, are you gonna work for JJ Reddick in the Lakers? Yeah, I actually do. Can I make an announcement? Yeah. Happy for jj. Oh, Okay. Had you not said that publicly yet? I don't think so. Okay. All right. That's good to, I said it to some people and I said it to him. You, yeah. It's Crazy that he is the coach of the Lakers. Yeah. It's pretty awesome. I mean if, if he's as equipped to do that as anyone. Yeah. So, yeah. I'm excited for him. Yeah.


But no, I'm not getting into Coaching. I'm also happy for gig. Okay, here we go. That's too big Announcements. Good. Wait, What? You're not you, you don't like Gigi Reddick. Max doesn't him. Max doesn't like gig Redick. Max, do you have a question for the guys? You said you did. Okay. No. Philly based questions. Nothing. Yeah, Go ahead. How to ask you both play different sports. Oh wow. He's got, he said you both play different sports. That really confused. How am I supposed to ask this whole conversation is I think Max, I mean I could just, can I just throw one out? Sure. Do you enjoy playing in Philly? 'cause that And That, that question stinks. Okay. You didn't have one so that stinks worse. Uses his question to tell you that. Your question stunk. I don't have a question.


I think his Question is actually, you guys play two different sports. Yeah. Oh yeah. What's that like sports People. Do you guys like sports? Even though you play different ones? How Does it work? You guys play two different sports. Oh, Blake, I did. I did have a question for you though. 'cause Joe Missoula said that he would send you a ring. He actually did say that. Did he? Yeah. Is this Midseason or? No, This, this is A, I think after they won. Right? Oh, That's in, I, I, I greatly appreciate that sentiment, but I am truly so happy for those guys and you know, they deserved it. And again, did you did your part though. I did my part, but I don't want the ring. You know what I mean? Like I, yeah. Yes. Was I a huge part of the team? Yes. Could they have done it with with me?


No. So, you know, I think that that equals no ring. Yeah. Maybe it's tribute video. That'd be nice. Yeah. Oh That would, yeah. Nice. Yeah. Wait, have you watched the Clipper show? I did not watch it. No. That's gotta be weird having a show that someone, an actor's playing life. Yeah. Everybody asked me if I watched it and I, my what I wa what I wanna say is like I lived it, but that sounds weird, right? No, that's cool to say. I think it's True. Yeah. Yeah. Show. Nah, I didn't watch it. I lived it. There's a show Show about, It does sound like kind of badass when you say it that way, but thanks Man. There's a show about Donald Sterling. What's showtime clipped? It's fx, I think. FX clips. Yeah. It's called Clip. Yeah. So there's a guy playing Blake Griffin.


Dude, That's sick. Yeah. Well, we'll show you. Like no, once you see the guy, you're gonna be like, ah, that's not sick. Sick. I'm Gonna pull it up right now. So you didn't work with this actor to show him how to be more Blake? I didn't, I think he, he sent in like a, probably like a submission tape and they're like, oh, he just dye his hair. Right. That was it. Can't read any lines. Like shoot, I don't, I haven't watched it. Oh Yeah, you haven't watched it. Like I, I've gotta watch it. I've just seen a bunch of like pictures. I'm not Watching it because you're not Watching it. I stand in solidarity. Solidarity, yes. We're not gonna watch it. We're just not gonna do it. Smart. This is, is this real? Is this a real picture right here? Oh my. Is that supposed to be Chris Paul. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. Blake Griffin. Yeah.


I would expected these guys would've met with you so that they could be like, Hey, which, which fire alarm did you pull when the rockets were trying to fight you? Oh yeah, I pulled, yeah, I pulled all of them. Yeah. Getting back. I called the police. Oh, alright. Well we love both of you guys. Sorry for glazing so much. But that's why like, to be sincere for a second, the best part about this podcast is like becoming real friends with some of the guys we've had on both of you are definitely in that category. So we want Josh to keep winning football games. We want Blake to keep not getting bored. Forget about me. Yeah, but Do not forget about Blake Griffin. Actually, you'll be nice.


Okay, here's an idea that popped my head when they do the, my, my cause my cleats. Maybe it's just Blake Griffin on your Cleats just really was like, wait, did he die? No. I just felt like people should We gotta remember him. Yeah. About him more. Don't Forget about him. You gotta do that. Some Sick, like sick art. Yeah. Him dunking and like just throw out some stats. Upwards of 450 million Americans. Forget about Blake Griffin every year. Yeah. PS Angel song in the best. I'm walking out. You can finally cross.

Football or basketball? Oh, Good question. What ball's better? Yeah. And which balls? Which Balls better for football? I think football's obviously a better, and I think for basketball, football's probably also better. But If, you had to take one ball for the rest of your life. Imagine Dunking with a football though. Yeah. Yeah. Right back in the, you're On a desert, desert island.


Well, Here's the thing about bring ball. The basketball is like, you know, you can dribble it, but like If, you don't have a hoop then at least you can play catch with a football.

Okay, boys, let's wrap up. Chill week. It's been an awesome, awesome week with Fire Fest. FIRE of the week. 'cause we're gonna be in the chill mindset first. Before we do that, Hank, how do you think Mount Rushmore went? I thought it didn't go as bad as you guys are making me think like it did. I think we'll let the pole decide for itself. True. But I feel okay. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was very funny. It, it was funny. We didn't Really have a lot of prep time That We only had a couple hours. That's true. Also, I think my prep time was two minutes in my head. It's Sandwiches You eat. That's, yeah. You guys are eaters. I'm, I'm not. So it's, Hank also came up with the idea.


Oh yeah. You, you're the one who came up. Oh shit. Hank also eats his sandwiches sideways. Like a harmonica. I thought it went, I thought it went great. Yeah. I, I think so too. It's been fun hanging out this weekend. I, I personally Had fun. I had a great Time. I know you guys think I'm bad vibes. No, I don't think you're bad vibes. I think you have things that make the vibes turn bad sometimes. Your Face, Your facial expressions. Yeah. When you do your facial expressions, they could, can sometimes turn bad. Alright. Fire fest of the week. Hank. Yeah. I, mine, mine's kind of just like a fire fest of the month. I kind of, you know, I've been doing a lot of, of, of reflecting and just real, like, I realized that the Brady Day was June 12th.


It's basically July 12th. The last month has been one of the craziest of my life. And just seeing all the awls out at all of these events, whether it was Brady Night, the Celtics Parade all week here. It just is very surreal and I know we kind of get used to it because it just happens all the time. But it's like, sometimes when I'm in my hotel or just sitting, you know, at my house, I'm just like this, I, I'm like the LeBron. I can't believe this is my life. Yeah. Big Time. So my fire fest is just, just the awls and, and, and the community that this podcast has brought and it's just, it's insane. Yeah. Think About how far you've come and just like the last year and a half, two years, everywhere you go, people just yell random numbers at you for the lottery ball machine.


And now they're just team Hank. Yeah. It's great. People, people are supportive of the haircut. They're just, it's just, it's, it's, it a Ws are the best. That's my Firefighter. We really gotta get people yelling random numbers at Max. Yeah. That's 'cause He's never, well, max gets the two sodas, which we've seen a few times. That's true. And. that makes me laugh pretty hard every time. Yeah. It makes me laugh every time. Max, where are the two sodas? Where was, where was that? Was That here? Yeah. What? A guy brought two sodas in for Max. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It happens A long week. Every time I go to a bar I get to someone comes over and they think it's like the most unique funny thing ever. It is. And it is. It's funny. It does make everyone around me laugh. Yeah. It makes me laugh every time. Memes, are you getting recognized now? Come on Meme said no. Like, memes doesn't go out though either.


Yeah, no. I'm saying out here, no one said, Hey memes. I wonder if Pug memes, we have been around, you know, with, with celebrities even like, because even like when we're walking around, we were, you know, with Kyle Je, he's a 49 er, we're in the Bay Area. Wind's on him. But like, there's also a ton of people yelling at it's area Adjacent. Let Cook, let him cook. Yeah. Bay Area Adjacent. That's closer than Hank usually gets with his geography References. There's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of 40 diner fans here. Yes. That's fair. We're on the west coast. He has, we're on the West Coast. A ton of fans here. Yeah. But there's also a ton of people yelling at, at PFT and myself And. That's always like, in those moments when we're with actual celebrities and actual athletes where I'm just like, I can't believe. Same thing as the parade when it's like I'm on the boat with, you know, the head coach of the Celtics and I have people yelling at me like that bro thinks he's on the team.


That's, that's the type of stuff that just, you know, blows my mind. Still to this day. We were Talking about it at dinner last night, like we have to compartmentalize it 'cause we have to do our job and have fun and, and bust balls. But like the growth of this show, we go out to the driving range and like a bunch of these guys who's like, we've been looking up to for all this time, like, come up to us or we like, they're, they know who we are. It's like Spencer. Fuck. Colletti. Yeah. Steven Colletti. Jesus. Who's Listening Right. Steven. Sorry. Steven. Sorry. Steven. Jesus Christ. Dude, I bet. Miles Teller and I talked about the sphere for like 20 minutes on Wednesday. It was like, it was just the most casual conversation. You are close to the sphere. Can you, can you feel it? I really want to go right now. Yeah. The sphere's in the Bay Bay area.


I really want to go right now. There is a bay over there that's, It's not base whatever, Not a, it's a lake. All I was trying to, It's called Lake Tahoe. It's a hidden gem. One of the hidden gems Lake of the Year. We gotta get Miles Teller back on the show though. That guy rocks. Absolutely rocks. It's also very funny watching all these super famous athletes movie stars, comedians, golf is like the ultimate equalizer that the most confident people in the world. You go up to 'em in the driving range, you're like, how you doing? They're like, I fucking suck. I just, I I've asked them like, you think you're gonna make a run? They, I'll just go, no. Yeah, God no. Right, right. So it's like you see the weakness of like, the golf brings everyone to their knees. I Think the one guy that, that actually might have a chance that we got to meet is Derek Carr.


Yeah. Derek Carr might have a chance this weekend. I was walking around the driving range and I, I wasn't up close enough to see who everyone was yet and I saw something happen. I was like, oh my God, that guy almost got killed by that other guy. It was about a half inch away from a devastating head injury that would've just like, probably killed the guy. Then I get closer and I'm like, oh my God, that guy that almost got killed, that's John Elway. Holy John Elway almost died on this driving range. Then I get a little bit closer and I'm like, holy shit. That was Derek Carr who Almost killed John Elway. Derek almost killed Derek Carr came about half an inch away from killing John Elway today. Which would've been the craziest sports story ever. That would've been nuts. Also given Derek Carr, like a little bit of bad boy street cred.


Yeah. And the Raiders would probably, Raiders would be welcome Back back. Yeah. Yeah. We also saw that one golf cart crash that rocked. Yeah. That was fun. Yeah. Old guys crashing golf. Golf carts is very Fun. And it was an old guy on the back of a golf cart getting rear-ended by another golf cart. It was just cool to watch. It Was Like, I know that it, everyone was okay. It was cool to watch. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. PFT My fire fest. FIRE Fest of the Week. I mean, I echo everything that Hank said. It's been very cool out here. But I would say my baby's coming home. My baby's coming home when I get back. Wow. What? Yeah. The El Camino. Oh yeah. Nice.


It's, it's, it should be fixed. Holy Fixed. We Had, we had a slight hiccup last week, so it's Of FIRE? Yeah. No, it, it's, it's, the hiccup is over. I think we're post hiccup when I was, I dropped it off before vacation and the guy was like, I'm gonna give you a call back tomorrow. I'll give you the full quote. Everything that needs to happen to it. I didn't hear from him for a long time and I was coming back from vacation. I still hadn't heard from this guy and I called, left a message, no return call. Called again, left a message, no return call. I thought there was an outside chance that this guy just straight up stole my el Camino. Ooh. And I would never hear from him again.


In which case, tip of the cap to that guy. Yeah. Runs a pretty good racket. Yeah. But then he called me back a couple days ago, gave me the breakdown of everything. I think we're back in business, I think starting next week. I think it's gonna be, it's gonna be in awesome August. Hell yes. I'm gonna be cruising that bad boy everywhere. Hell yes. Speakers working great on it. Tested those out. I just can't wait. I can't, I did get a seatbelt installed, which might be a beta move on my part. I just don't want to, I don't wanna die if I get into an accident. But no, I think that's probably also like If. you ever get pulled over, you probably want a seatbelt. Yeah. It's legally mandated in the, in the state of Illinois. But I am, I'm very much looking forward to pulling up to a lot of places that are too classy for an El Camino. In an El Camino. Hell yes.


I just wanna get, I wanna get kicked outta somewhere. Pulling up with just revving that engine. Oh, that's sweet. That rocks and nothing bad's ever gonna happen to it. That rocks ever again. Okay. My fire fest, I just have had a great time hanging with the boys. We just had like playing Frisbee. Golf was awesome. We gotta do that more dinners. We did a team dinner in our suite on Tuesday night. Grilled and chilled. Grilled and chilled. We went out to dinner at like maybe the best vibes ever bar that had live music that was just as chill as possible. Just hanging with Hank PFT. And I spent some time in the hot tub last night. We almost got in the hot tub where the jets weren't working and we then realized that it would just be the three of us sitting in the bathtub together Also chill.


The other one also chill. Yeah. but it was, I don't know, it's just fun being on the road with the boys. Yeah, it is. And we, and we fired Greg BH Holter And we fired Greg BH Holter. And Hank has not had bad vibes except for that one time. There have been fewer bad vibes than usual. Yeah. He's been very good vibes. He, today Hank was like, I don't know what, what got into him today. Maybe he got a lot of sleep, but he was like intern Hank. He was running around, grabbing food, grabbing waters, what do you need? What do you this blah, blah. He's Trying to be an asset. Yeah. It was incredible. I think It's just being on a golf course. Yeah. It brings the best out of Him. That was one funny story was This, this is a mis misconception.


You don't Even know what the story is yet. I do. What Do, what do you think the story is? Blake Griffin? Do you want to, do you wanna tell it? Yeah. So Blake Griffin, we were, me and PFT, the plan was we shot PFT like was with use Jack, you know, shooting a video. I was shooting the video too. I also got to, you know, run it back on the, on the camera. Yeah. You, you said that After you like I still got it Back on the sticks. Yeah. Memes said opposite. Oh no, I I did still don't. Got it. I did hear that Hank had to ask memes all the time. Like how Do I turn the song. Oh no, no, no, no. I just was, it took me a minute to get used to The what happens. It was a learning experience. Yeah. Oh, he had to relearn. So not like riding a bike. Well, no. They just have a different way that they shoot golf videos and I was just, I, it took me a hole.
