And then we have an awesome interview with Forest Gallant, who actually, we had an interview on the old Barstool Gold Days. So a lot of people probably didn't hear it. Really fascinating dude. He basically travels the world searching for animals, extinct animals, animals that we haven't seen in, you know, hundreds of years swims with sharks.

0 (42s):
Really, really cool interview in person. Like one of those ones that you walk away, you're like, damn, that was very interesting. He's in the Naked and Afraid Hall of Fame. Yeah, he's in the Naked and Afraid Hall of Fame. We also have the Red Redo Mount Rushmore Red Redo. After both those interviews to finally put an end to the Mount Rushmore season, we're gonna do the Mount Rushmore, and then we are going to find out who lost right after. And we've already had the punishments as well. So listen to all of that. We're going to do our annual NFL Head coaches draft, where we draft what coaches we think are good coaches, and we're gonna talk a little preview for the season. Maybe pick some NFL awards and our Super Bowl champ.

Today is Wednesday, September 4th. And boys, we are a mere hours away from the NFL season kicking off. We're What if you're listening to this in the morning, we're about 40, 36 hours away. It's back. We're ready. It's NFL Eve. It's NFL Eve, Christmas Eve, new Year's Eve all rolled up into one. I'm ready. I'm excited. I'm so excited. I'm, I'm too excited. Yeah, I'm too excited. I've, I've found that I've been just pulling random people aside and, and having conversations with 'em and they always Rollback to like Jaden Daniels and I'm always saying the same thing. My analysis of Jaden Daniels is identical every time.

0 (4m 13s):
He's so good. Yeah. And that's, that's all I've been talking to people about. And I feel like this is, this year it all turns around. Yeah. And we have the Thursday night game, the Friday night game. Full slate Sunday. Yeah. A great Monday night night cap for Yeah. Yeah. Where we might lose a member of the show. Yeah. Memes. Memes. Have you purchased the bond making supplies just in case? Not yet. Okay. That's probably smart. That is smart. So we have our Pete Prisco preview. We did our danki preview yesterday. We gotta do a preview of our own. Should we start, maybe we, we end with the coaches draft or should we start with the coaches draft? Let's do the coaches draft. You do it right off the bat. Let's fucking do the coaches draft.

0 (4m 53s):
Quick turnaround for starter end. Yeah, because I've, I realized that the coaches draft is fun and we can And it. It's, it helps preview everything. So we're gonna do, we did this last year, we drafted every NFL head coach, basically who you trust, who you, who you believe in. And we'll po we'll post it. It's not a Mount Rushmore 'cause it's eight picks each, but it will be a poll that people can vote on at the end and see who has the best eight pack of NFL head coaches. How do we want to start? Who wants to go first? Max, you wanna go first? Sure. Okay. PFT. Why don't you go first? Okay. I'll go first and then we'll go. Are we doing Max? Are we doing snake? We're going snake. Okay. So it'll be me, max, Hank, Big. Cat, Big, Cat. Then back around.

0 (5m 34s):
Yes. Yes. So this is, this is your number one head coach. 'cause you have the first pick number one head coach. Many would say the best coach of all time or at least in the conversation. Yeah. Andy Reed. Yes. Andy Reid. Good pick. Great coach. Looks good in shorts. I Do I. I keep going back to just, the Chiefs are gonna win it all again. I think, I feel like this is

4 (5m 57s):
All leading towards the same conclusion. I'm not gonna pick the Chiefs.

0 (6m 0s):
I think I'm gonna pick the Chiefs.

4 (6m 2s):
I'm gonna, I'm I will end up betting on the Chiefs, but I don't think I'm gonna take the Chiefs.

0 (6m 6s):
Yeah. I just, they're, they're, I don't know what, I don't know what's gonna stop 'em.

4 (6m 10s):
It's almost like the more distractions they get in Kansas City, the better they get. Yeah.

0 (6m 14s):
And it. And they

4 (6m 15s):
Have the ability to take all the distractions and actually become more focused.

0 (6m 19s):
And the minute you get to the point where you're just saying, oh well they're, they're just tired of winning. That's probably why, why they won't win. That's not a real reason.

4 (6m 25s):
Not a real win. No, no,

0 (6m 26s):
No. Not at all. Okay. Max,

5 (6m 30s):
I am gonna go with,

0 (6m 31s):
This is good that we just, we we're detoxing from Mount Rushmore season by doing a draft.

4 (6m 36s):
Yeah, it's good. It's totally different. Yeah. It's

5 (6m 38s):
Totally different. Way different. I'm gonna go with Jim Harbaugh. Ooh.

4 (6m 41s):
Right off the bat.

0 (6m 42s):
Okay. Hasn't coached the NFL in a while, but obviously

4 (6m 46s):
National Champion three

0 (6m 47s):
Three NFC championships. A Super Bowl appearance,

5 (6m 51s):
Friend of the program. Three

0 (6m 53s):
NFC championship appearances. Yeah. Friend of the pro. Good friend of the program.

4 (6m 57s):
You think he's gonna miss having Connor?

5 (7m 1s):
I, he doesn't know him. That's

0 (7m 2s):
True. I also think there's a chance he could have Connor.

4 (7m 5s):
Yeah,

0 (7m 5s):
We don't know. We don't know. Okay. Hank,

6 (7m 8s):
I'm gonna go with another good friend of the program. Super Bowl champion. Ah, third longest tenured NFL Coach John Harbaugh.

0 (7m 17s):
Oh, I thought you were gonna go with a different front of the program. Good pick. Good pick. Good pick. I was gonna, I was gonna possibly pick him. Alright, so I'll go with the, I'll go with the smart kids in the same division. I'll take Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan back to back I, Kyle Shanahan. This is a big year for him.

4 (7m 35s):
Yeah. It feels like this is, he's got a lot of baggage, a lot of emotional baggage. He's had some tough loss.

0 (7m 42s):
If you want though. You can make the the correlation. Andy Reed is one of the greatest coaches of all time for a long time. Andy Reed was Kyle Shanahan where he was on the Eagles could had a lot of really good teams, couldn't get over the hump. Kind of goes back to what I always think is good as the coach is it's always about the quarterback. 'cause he got Patrick Mahomes and Kyle Shanahan. He took Jimmy G to a Super Bowl that actually might be bigger than a Super Bowl. Yeah. That might be more impressive than a Super Bowl.

4 (8m 13s):
Yeah. Yeah. I, I love Kyle Shanahan. Like, I think almost every team, if maybe there might be one or two teams that would take him over their current head coach if everything was equal that we've already said. Yeah. Yeah. He's that good. He

0 (8m 27s):
Is. But he, he, you know, if he can, maybe Brock Purdy is the quarterback, but that, that really is, it's funny how it goes down. Like Andy Reed, if he just retired after the Eagles be like, yeah. He was a, he was a good coach. Never won anything big. And then he has Patrick Mahomes in his life and he starts winning big. Yep. Okay. Hank,

6 (8m 46s):
I'm gonna stick with hard nose football. Mike Tomlin.

0 (8m 48s):
Mm. Good

4 (8m 49s):
Pick. Nice pick. Great pick. I had him on next to my board.

0 (8m 53s):
We're about to fall off a cliff.

5 (8m 55s):
I'm gonna go with another vet in the game. Hasn't figured out with this team quite yet, but I think it will. Sean. Peyton? Mm.

4 (9m 2s):
Okay. All right.

0 (9m 4s):
Interesting. It

6 (9m 4s):
Was a horrible draft for Max.

4 (9m 5s):
It's a tough love kind of guy. Yeah. Max doesn't really know. Good coaches though. Yeah.

0 (9m 10s):
Bad draft. Okay. PFT got two.

4 (9m 13s):
Okay. I'm gonna go with Dan Campbell. Mm. Good pick Dan Campbell. Great coach. Good pick. Love what he's building up there in Detroit.

0 (9m 23s):
Yeah. Good pick. That's a good pick.

4 (9m 25s):
And we talk about Dan Campbell with Pete Prisco. I think Pete's wrong about Dan. Yeah, I do too. I think we're right about Dan. Yes. Next I'm gonna go Kevin Stefanski from the show. I coach,

0 (9m 34s):
Coach the year twice.

4 (9m 35s):
I think he's, is he because the coach of the year. It's funny, it's like Matt

0 (9m 39s):
May you wanna coach the year,

4 (9m 40s):
You could give it every year to Bill Belichick when he was in the league or Andy Reed. But it's usually a guy that makes the playoffs that you don't think is going to make the playoffs

0 (9m 49s):
Two time coach of the year

4 (9m 50s):
To, which is funny because you could also make the same claim that Kevin Stefanski might be underrated as a head coach. Yeah,

0 (9m 57s):
I, I mean, I think he's a very, very good head coach. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not bias. Did he

4 (10m 2s):
Get a dog for his kids yet?

0 (10m 3s):
I don't know. That's

4 (10m 5s):
A good question. I need to know about that. Follow

0 (10m 6s):
Up with that. Okay. Maxie,

5 (10m 11s):
I will go. Mike McDaniel. Mm.

0 (10m 14s):
Okay. What about, what about Mike McDaniel in under 40 degree weather?

5 (10m 20s):
That's a, that's what's the word I'm looking for?

0 (10m 24s):
You can find it

4 (10m 25s):
A good point.

0 (10m 26s):
Yeah. You can find it. No

5 (10m 28s):
Random. They say it in the court of law. It's random.

0 (10m 33s):
That was the word you were looking

5 (10m 34s):
For. No, there's a, there's a random

0 (10m 36s):
Erroneous

4 (10m 36s):
Objection.

5 (10m 37s):
Erroneous. Does that make, does that make sense? Erroneous. What do you think Mike McDaniel is a Describe what you a fun offense to. He's got a fun offense. Erroneous And. it doesn't end that the the, the cold weather doesn't show his actual coaching para prowess.

4 (10m 52s):
Okay.

0 (10m 53s):
Okay. Okay.

5 (10m 56s):
This is stressing me out. There's too many names. I know there's so many names.

0 (11m 0s):
That's the best part. Okay, Hank,

6 (11m 3s):
I'm gonna go with a guy that they kept around for a reason. He, he must be good. Matt Eber flu.

0 (11m 7s):
Mm. Troll

4 (11m 9s):
Pick. Good pick Hank

0 (11m 10s):
Troll Pick. Yeah.

6 (11m 13s):
What do you mean? Yeah.

0 (11m 14s):
Okay. Okay. I see what you did there. See what he did there?

6 (11m 18s):
They kept him around for he, he has to be good in,

0 (11m 20s):
In the fourth round.

6 (11m 22s):
Yeah. But see what you did there. If. you guys are gonna be winning football. All,

0 (11m 26s):
All right. All

6 (11m 26s):
All. You have to have a good coach. Relax.

0 (11m 29s):
Relax. Troll. Troll pick. Okay.

6 (11m 32s):
I don't understand how you could be selling yourself so high on the bears but not be high on the head coach because

0 (11m 36s):
It's the players. Jimmy's and Joe's. Not X's and O's. You ever heard that saying? So

6 (11m 41s):
Then we should be doing just a, a fantasy draft. Well,

4 (11m 43s):
In, in big Cat's mind what's happened this off season is mad Fl has said, I'm only going to do defense. Yeah. And that's it. Yeah.

0 (11m 50s):
Shane Waldron got the offense.

4 (11m 51s):
He's not gonna do any offense. Game management. I don't know who's gonna take over in that department.

0 (11m 56s):
You won't even have to manage the games. You know

4 (11m 58s):
What, he'll have figured it out this off season.

0 (11m 60s):
Yeah. I got, I have question marks. There's question marks. We'll find out. We'll find out. Hey listen, I wanted Jim Harbaugh. I recruited Jim Harbaugh. My recruiting fell short. Alright, let's go with Matt LeFlore, friend of the program and a guy I am very high on Dko Ryan's. Oh,

4 (12m 17s):
I had both those guys. Yeah.

0 (12m 18s):
Good pick. Yeah. So I'm going with the young guns. Okay. I like that. A lot of the young guns. Hank, this is where we fall off a cliff.

6 (12m 24s):
I don't think so. I I've been sold a lot on this guy. Oh,

0 (12m 27s):
I was saying more just in the fact that we can't remember who we picked.

6 (12m 30s):
Oh yeah. This is another guy. Big expectations. He's a veteran in, in the league. Dan Quinn. Okay.

0 (12m 37s):
Oh yeah. Back, back to back troll. I So Matt Ebra flu's Better coach than Dan Quinn though.

6 (12m 43s):
Yeah.

0 (12m 43s):
Yeah. 'cause you picked him earlier.

4 (12m 45s):
Turn your hat backwards when you say that.

0 (12m 46s):
What do you like

4 (12m 47s):
About Dan Quinn?

6 (12m 49s):
Defensive Hard. Noses. Gritty. He's gonna get the players going. Yeah. He got great offense back. Yep.

4 (12m 54s):
Great offense. Went

0 (12m 54s):
To a Super Bowl.

6 (12m 55s):
Went to a Super Bowl.

0 (12m 57s):
Had a, had a 25 point lead in a Super Bowl

6 (13m 1s):
Against Yeah. One of the best teams of all time. That's

4 (13m 3s):
Very hard to do. Yeah,

0 (13m 4s):
It is.

4 (13m 5s):
How many teams

0 (13m 5s):
Kinda like Kyle Shannon taking Jimmy G. Those actually should be Super Bowl.

4 (13m 8s):
How many teams and and those two guys are not related whatsoever in that Super Bowl. Dan Quinn, Kyle Shanahan.

0 (13m 14s):
Not at all.

4 (13m 15s):
With Dan Quinn building that 25 point lead against one of the greatest teams ever and the greatest player ever. That should actually count as two Super Bowls. Two

0 (13m 23s):
Super Bowls.

4 (13m 23s):
That's so hard to do. Super

0 (13m 25s):
Bowls. Okay. Multi,

4 (13m 26s):
Multi-time. Super Bowl winning. Coach Dan Quinn kind of. Yeah.

0 (13m 30s):
Max is in the booth. He's taking off his shoes and socks to try to count to 10. Here it is.

5 (13m 36s):
It's stressful. There's a lot going on.

0 (13m 38s):
He, every time I look up, he's just freaking out.

5 (13m 40s):
Well, there's so many names. I thought we were just gonna do four. And then all of the names really just got got to me. I'm going to get ahead of Hank's troll picks and I'll go Nick

0 (13m 50s):
Siri. That's smart. You blocked the troll. How are you feeling about Nick Siri?

5 (13m 55s):
All, all in. He's gonna be a leader of men this year. We got good guys around him. This is the year, this is the year that he gets it done. It's

0 (14m 1s):
Actually funny

6 (14m 2s):
'cause the leader of men this year, the five. Yes. He not in past years.

5 (14m 6s):
Last year he didn't do a great job leading men, but leading men. But this year he is back leading men.

4 (14m 10s):
What's the most important part about leading a man?

5 (14m 15s):
Just showing a good example of what it's like to be a man. Okay.

0 (14m 19s):
What

4 (14m 19s):
Such as?

0 (14m 20s):
So would you say Dom is the head coach then?

5 (14m 23s):
No, but having a good guy like that by your side shows that you know good guys to be around.

0 (14m 28s):
But If, you have Dom next to you. Everyone's gonna look and they're like, Hey, there's Nick cii Dom. That's a man, man. Yeah. That's a whatever it is. It's a

5 (14m 36s):
Team. I'm gonna, it's a team game. It, it's not one person. It's just like showing a good surrounding in the organization of leadership. And Nick Siri's at the head of that,

0 (14m 45s):
Not Dom,

5 (14m 47s):
He dom's right there. He's always next to him. Yeah. So like when you're looking at Siri, you're also looking at Dom,

4 (14m 53s):
But also with Nick Ciani.

0 (14m 55s):
It's like, you can't look at Nick Ciani without looking at Dom. He's

5 (14m 58s):
Always

4 (14m 58s):
There. But Nick Ciani can't be a man without a real man behind. Correct. It's like, oh, I have to have my, that's I to have my, my dad follows me around in case I get into any trouble.

0 (15m 8s):
Nick Siri's basically one of those talkers that goes to the mall and tries to fight people and then their security guard steps in.

4 (15m 14s):
It's like Robin Big. Yeah.

5 (15m 16s):
No, but it takes good leadership to know that good leadership should be

0 (15m 19s):
Around. Yeah. That you, you need a bodyguard at all times. Right?

5 (15m 21s):
Right. Yep.

4 (15m 22s):
It takes someone who's very honest about them, not themselves, not being a man to admit they need bigger. That's said

5 (15m 27s):
What I said. That's not what I said.

4 (15m 28s):
Okay. I'm gonna go with Big Dom. Okay. For the next, I'm gonna go with big Dom and then I will take,

5 (15m 35s):
Are we allowing Big Dom? No,

0 (15m 37s):
We're not allowing big Dom.

4 (15m 38s):
We should. Okay. I'll take, I'm gonna go with Zach Taylor. Mm.

0 (15m 43s):
People forget. People

4 (15m 44s):
Forget about Zach Taylor. Right? Me. Do I. Think he's a very good coach. I do too. He kind of flies under the radar in Cincinnati a little bit. And he did a good job without Joe Burrow. Yeah. When he was hurt. Yeah. I think he's a very good coach. Next up, I'm gonna go with Doug Peterson. Mm.

0 (15m 58s):
Super Bowl

4 (15m 59s):
Winner. Super Bowl winner. He won a Super Bowl. Yeah. A lot of people say that it couldn't be done in Philly. Doug Peterson did it.

0 (16m 5s):
Super Bowl winner. Good pick.

4 (16m 6s):
No, that's good. Pick that was and then they, then they ran him outta town. Yeah.

5 (16m 10s):
No. Shouldn't have. Good guy. I'm gonna go with Shane Steichen.

0 (16m 14s):
Ah, good pick.

4 (16m 15s):
That's a good pick.

0 (16m 16s):
Good pick. Good pick.

6 (16m 19s):
Has anyone taken Antonio Pierce?

0 (16m 21s):
No.

6 (16m 22s):
And I'll do that.

0 (16m 23s):
Good pick.

6 (16m 23s):
Run the program. Okay. Gonna have those boys fired up.

0 (16m 27s):
Okay. I will go with, no, I don't want him. Oh, I'll go with the newcomer. We don't know what he is yet, but if we're basing it off of his defense last year, I think he's gonna be a very good head coach. I'll take Mike McDonald. Yep. Seattle Seahawks. Head coach. Good coach. I think he's going to be a very good head coach. And then I will also take, this is where we, we, yeah, I'm, I'm lost. Oh, you know what friend of the program? Yeah. Some of the seasons haven't gone very well at the end, but he's got his team competing every single year. Four A AFCs championships. Sean McDermott. Good

4 (17m 2s):
Pick.

0 (17m 3s):
They've won four AFCs

4 (17m 4s):
Championships. Yeah. And If, you If you look at what the bills were before McDermott compared to with him. Obviously Josh Allen made a big difference too. But he's, he's done a good job when he is not making nine 11 references. He's

0 (17m 14s):
73 and 41 as the head coach. Yeah. That's pretty damn good. In the NFL in the National Football League.

6 (17m 21s):
I will go with a newcomer. Newcomer unknown, but based on his defense last year, I think he's gonna be good. Jared Mayo.

4 (17m 28s):
Oh, okay.

0 (17m 30s):
Nice. You got all the guys. Nice.

4 (17m 34s):
Good. Pick Hank Memes. Just sick. Couldn't but notice that you took Antonio Pierce before Mayo

0 (17m 39s):
And Matt Ebra flu and Dan

4 (17m 40s):
Quinn. Yeah. What's interesting about Pierce is Pierce Act.

6 (17m 42s):
Well, Matt Ebra flu is well, kept him around for a reason.

0 (17m 46s):
And,

4 (17m 46s):
And you

6 (17m 46s):
Know that Quinn Quinn went to a Super Bowl

0 (17m 49s):
So much. I hate you so much.

4 (17m 51s):
And you know, you know that Antonio Pierce, Antonio

6 (17m 52s):
Pierce came on the show. If Mayo came on the show, I would've taken him

4 (17m 54s):
Before. Well, Antonio Pierce is such, he was such a good player that he beat maybe the best team of all time in the Super Bowl. You remember that?

6 (18m 2s):
I do. He did beat probably the best team of all time in the Super Bowl. Well that,

4 (18m 4s):
That means they're actually not the best team of all time. Because he lost he beat. I

6 (18m 8s):
Said probably.

0 (18m 9s):
Yeah. Okay. Max.

5 (18m 12s):
This is where I think, scratch that. I I screwed something up. Someone picked Kevin O'Connell, right? No. No. Oh, we

0 (18m 19s):
Got him. Oh, that's, thats good value. I had him good on my list. I had him on my list. Is a good pick. I think he's a very good coach.

6 (18m 25s):
I, we all have every person on our list.

0 (18m 28s):
Yeah. I'm actually looking at just the Wikipedia of list for an NFL quarterback or coaches.

4 (18m 33s):
We have 'em on our list.

5 (18m 34s):
I, I freaked out. I I just started writing everyone's name down. I've been crossing things. I I I'm like Charlie in from Always Sunny right now with these, this list.

4 (18m 43s):
You're like Memento. It's

5 (18m 44s):
Yeah. I'm, I'm flustered.

0 (18m 45s):
Kevin O'Connell's a good coach. Yeah. And I think if Sam Donald, this is gonna be the year seven year bump.

4 (18m 52s):
We spaced on Kevin O'Connell. Yeah. That's

0 (18m 54s):
All that was. I, I did have, I was looking at his name. But Sean McDermott has done more in the NFL. Okay. PFT. You have two picks.

4 (19m 2s):
I got two picks now

0 (19m 3s):
And then we're getting to the end.

4 (19m 5s):
End. Yeah. We are getting to the end. End right now.

0 (19m 8s):
There's a big fat elephant

4 (19m 9s):
In the room now. I know. And I don't wanna take him. I'm gonna go with Raheem Morris.

0 (19m 17s):
Okay.

4 (19m 17s):
Falcons. I think the Falcons are gonna be spices here. Raheem Morris, he had, he had a 24 5 point lead in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots at one point. Yes. People forget that. Yes,

0 (19m 29s):
That's true.

4 (19m 30s):
So I'm gonna take him and then I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go with Brian Callahan.

0 (19m 36s):
Nice. I like Brian Callahan also a WL Is he really? Yes.

4 (19m 40s):
I like Brian Callahan Callahan a lot. Obviously hasn't done anything as a head coach yet. But it's him. You get him and his dad? Yeah. As a package deal. Both Callahans. Big, big Tom, little Bryan. I don't know his dad's probably not Tom Callahan. No, it's Tommy boy. I'm thinking of

6 (19m 54s):
The off the

4 (19m 54s):
Board, but, but his dad is maybe the best offensive line coach in the NFL. Yeah.

0 (19m 58s):
That's a fact. That's a fact. Okay. There's like three names that I don't want to pick that, I'm just hoping I can play it correctly.

4 (20m 5s):
Just hold your breath.

0 (20m 6s):
Yeah,

5 (20m 8s):
Yeah. I'm gonna go with Jonathan Gannon

0 (20m 14s):
Explosives.

5 (20m 15s):
He was underratedly not that bad last year.

4 (20m 18s):
Okay.

0 (20m 18s):
Yeah. I actually am high on the Cardinals offense this year. I think it's gonna be fun. Watch. Very fun Watch Hank.

6 (20m 27s):
Listen fellas. Winning a Super Bowl in this league is

0 (20m 29s):
Tough. Oh, he is doing it.

6 (20m 31s):
You need someone with Super Bowl winning cowboy

0 (20m 32s):
Experience. Fans stands up.

6 (20m 34s):
You need someone that's had that experience. He is gonna, you know, get the boys through through the long playoff run. Mike McCarthy.

4 (20m 41s):
Long playoff run.

0 (20m 42s):
Good one.

4 (20m 42s):
I don't think he's ever been on a long run,

0 (20m 44s):
Long, long playoff run. Okay. This is fun.

5 (20m 52s):
How are you guys doing this without crossing the names out? This is, I would,

0 (20m 54s):
'cause I'm just looking at who we have. We we're doing it,

5 (20m 57s):
But how do you just remember that

0 (20m 58s):
Listening. Alright, I'm, I'm gonna

4 (20m 60s):
Some guys that we don't want to take and Yeah. We're just hoping that somebody else takes them.

0 (21m 3s):
I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick one of probably the most vocal, boisterous guys out there. Leader of men, Todd Bowles, Todd Bowles, back to back NFC South Championships. Anyone?

4 (21m 18s):
Yeah. Todd Bowles, one of the, he used to be one of the top 10 coaches in the league. Yeah, he

0 (21m 21s):
Did. He used to be. And then, you know what, I'll do it just for Memey. I'll take Robert Salah. Robert Sah bald head. I think Robert Salah would've been fired if he didn't have a bald head.

4 (21m 36s):
You think If, you had hair.

0 (21m 37s):
I think If, you had hair. He would've already been fired. I think the bald head, you just see it and it's like power. Is it too intimidating? It's shiny. Bald, yeah. I just think there's something about him. The aura.

4 (21m 46s):
Yeah. I think that you've noticed this in the off season with Sah. He's, he's had it, he's like sick of talking to people. Yeah. Everything. Yeah.

0 (21m 53s):
This is, he's got a, he's got a win for his own mental health. Like, which I like a, a coach backed in the corner. Yeah. He

4 (21m 59s):
He's definitely in that fight or flight right now. Yeah. And. it seems like everything that's been going on with the team has been nothing to do with actual football. And so he's probably just, he's wishing that somebody would ask him a question. He's missing the days about answering relentless questions about Zach Wilson.

0 (22m 15s):
Yeah. He

4 (22m 15s):
Pisses that. Yeah. He's sick of talking about where his quarterback going to Egypt and a guy that's on the team that's not on the team. He just wants to be able to like, get mad at the media for treating his quarterback unfairly.

0 (22m 26s):
Yes, I'd agree. Okay. Hank last round.

6 (22m 29s):
I think there's a better baldheaded coach in New York with championship experience. Brian Abel.

0 (22m 36s):
Okay.

4 (22m 36s):
You see Brian Abel is taking back play calling responsibilities this year. Oh. Just announced that. Oh, I don't know if this was a thing that happened earlier in the off season they agreed on or if it was like the preseason sucked. So I'm, that would be a panic move if they flipped it up right now. But yeah, he's back calling plays, which is If. you look at the trajectory. I'm not saying he's gonna be fired. I like Brian debell. But the trajectory of a coach who's on his way to being fired, it does involve the play calling duties going back and forth. Yeah.

0 (23m 7s):
Brian Debell has six rings stud, pretty crazy stud. Five Super Bowls in the college football national champion for Alabama in 2017 stud. Brian Abel should remake the MJ picture with his rings. That'd be cool. Okay. There's two left.

5 (23m 25s):
I'm gonna go with Dave Canales. Okay.

0 (23m 28s):
PFT got the stinky one.

5 (23m 30s):
I watched a clip of him on X yesterday talking about whether he was gonna go with a Bell Cow approach or a committee approach at running back. And that's what I, that's what I got on him. That's, that's literally That's good. That was the first time I'd seen the man's face and I'd be like, who's this guy? And then I was like, oh, this is

0 (23m 46s):
The Panthers in the cookbook. Yeah,

4 (23m 48s):
The cookbook. He wrote a book about cheating on his wife.

5 (23m 51s):
Yep. Love

4 (23m 52s):
It. We actually should do

5 (23m 53s):
Wait, don't love it.

4 (23m 54s):
You don't

0 (23m 55s):
No. you

4 (23m 56s):
Don't love him Apologizing for cheating on his wife.

0 (23m 58s):
It was apology book. Oh,

4 (23m 59s):
Love it. Yeah.

0 (24m 0s):
It wasn't like, oh dude, my wife doesn't even know I'm writing this book. Yeah.

4 (24m 4s):
I I read the first chapter of it, which was like, listen, I fell asleep and when I woke up I was in my wife's friend's bed and I don't, don't know how it happened.

5 (24m 13s):
Fake, fake news. That can, that doesn't mean cheating.

0 (24m 19s):
So

4 (24m 20s):
We're taking Dave Canals over Dennis Allen. Be honest. Did you forget about Dennis Allen Max?

5 (24m 25s):
No, I saw I had him on here. I just, I I honestly saw that he was the coach for five years of the Saints and I like didn't even know that.

4 (24m 32s):
Yeah. He's just kind of been, he's

5 (24m 33s):
Like a big nothing guy.

0 (24m 34s):
He's Oh, he's nothing. He's got no picture on Wikipedia.

4 (24m 37s):
He's been, he's

0 (24m 38s):
Just been there.

5 (24m 39s):
He's crazy. Yeah.

0 (24m 41s):
He's, he's a total nothing.

4 (24m 43s):
Can you imagine living in New Orleans for five years and not doing anything noteworthy at all?

0 (24m 47s):
It's crazy. He's just, and his name is boring too. Yeah. It's two first names. It's like, oh yeah. Dennis Allen. Like If. you pulled a hundred people. I think, I think the majority would still say Sean Payton.

4 (24m 60s):
You think so?

0 (25m 0s):
Yeah. If. you did like one of those drunk Nashville videos.

4 (25m 4s):
Yeah. It just kinda seems like they've been 10 guys in New Orleans making the decisions. And then Alan is just the guy that stands on the sidelines. Yeah. Nodding his head. Yeah.

0 (25m 13s):
Figurehead. Okay. That was a good draft. Yeah. Got got me pumped up for the season.

4 (25m 18s):
I'm very excited. I'm gonna read this Dave Canales book.

0 (25m 20s):
Yeah. Alright. So what else do we wanna do? Any other predictions? Book

4 (25m 24s):
Report. I'll do a book report on it.

0 (25m 26s):
I, I like the idea. PFD We should do, we should do a round of just what is, what's the worst thing that could happen?

4 (25m 32s):
Yeah. For each

0 (25m 33s):
Of us. Do we wanna do that? It's scary.

4 (25m 37s):
Yeah. Confront your fears though.

0 (25m 39s):
Or should we do it for each other?

6 (25m 40s):
You want me to start?

4 (25m 42s):
I what if what if Hank just says it? Yeah. For

0 (25m 44s):
All of us. Yeah. Do it

4 (25m 45s):
For all us. Hat or Hank. Yeah. Hater.

6 (25m 46s):
Hank. No, no, no. For no

4 (25m 47s):
I'm not no Hank, you're good at this

0 (25m 48s):
Most devastating thing that could happen to us as a fan for all.

6 (25m 51s):
All No you guys. No, you guys have to do it for selves. Look within, look within yourself. You just want, you want to get mad at me, but you need to look That's true. Deep within. And face your irrational fears that you guys have set upon yourselves for this season. Okay. And I'll start. PFT alluded to it. I think the worst case scenario for the Patriots this year is eight wins.

0 (26m 10s):
Oh you motherfucker. That was such a tricky thing. You did. Oh, you played it well you played that. Well

6 (26m 19s):
It would be, that would be be like, I'm going into the season. We're trying to, we gotta rebuild. If you're gonna rebuild, you guys know Got now you can

4 (26m 25s):
Recalibrate

6 (26m 25s):
Some time. It, it starts with the draft.

4 (26m 28s):
I'm recalibrating eight

6 (26m 29s):
Wins wouldn't get us to the playoffs and won't get us a good drop position. It would just be a little bit of a too much of a tease.

4 (26m 36s):
A tease. Actually that's, that's not a bad point. Except you are, you are rebuilding and you've got a young quarterback. But going eight and nine when you have like an established quarterback, that's the worst thing that can happen. What

0 (26m 45s):
About nine wins?

6 (26m 47s):
It's still not playoffs.

0 (26m 49s):
What about 10 wins?

6 (26m 50s):
If we make it to the playoffs, make it to the playoffs and then anything can happen. Right. You get in the dance. Right.

0 (26m 56s):
So eight wins eight. It's a good pick. It's a good pick. PFT

4 (26m 59s):
I'm gonna say the stadium falling apart and critically injuring Jaden Daniels.

0 (27m 6s):
That's, that would be

4 (27m 7s):
Devastating. Or like having shit come outta the showers and him getting M-S-R-A-M-R-S-A whatever it is. Both, both realistic things that could happen at FedEx Field. Oh, excuse me. Northwest Federal Credit Union Field Northwest. They're calling it the Fed, which I think is a kind of a shitty nickname, but whatever.

0 (27m 27s):
Yeah. Alright. The worst thing could happen for me. I don't think it's as easy as being like, oh, kale Williams is not the guy. I think it would be back on the rollercoaster. Very up and down. And then week 18 chance to make the playoffs against the Packers and he does his nails and then like epically lose and Jordan Love goes and wins the Super Bowl. Yeah, that would be it. That would bad be pretty bad. That'd be pretty bad. That'd be pretty bad. That would be, yeah. But like not, not like, oh he's just bad. It's like the rollercoaster of back and forth where it's like there's just more bad than good Justin Fields.

0 (28m 10s):
If the defense keeps you in games and like Caleb doesn't really sound a ton. Yeah. And then that, yeah, that week 18 scenario would be a nightmare. Like the Packers, maybe it's week 18, the Lions have already clinched the, the NFC North. So it's week 18 for the last wild card spot. And then the Packers get it and go on a run and win the Super

4 (28m 28s):
Bowl. Or what if

0 (28m 29s):
With our wild card spot,

4 (28m 30s):
What if the Steelers go on a run with Justin Fields? I'm

0 (28m 33s):
Root Well I want Justin Fields to play because then our draft pick gets better. Yeah.

4 (28m 37s):
But if it's, if Justin Fields won a Super Bowl with the Steelers, how would you feel about that?

0 (28m 41s):
I'd be happy for Justin.

4 (28m 43s):
I don't, I don't think that's, I'd

0 (28m 44s):
Be very happy for Justin. I'd be very happy for Justin. I'd be extremely happy for Justin.

4 (28m 50s):
I don't think you, that might actually make you log off.

0 (28m 53s):
I'd be happy for Justin.

4 (28m 55s):
I think you, I

0 (28m 55s):
Think I love, there's two things about me. Two things about me. I love Justin Fields. I love Ben the dog. Two things about me. Yeah. You can put those two in the back. I I

4 (29m 5s):
Think you would log off. I think you would actually, you

0 (29m 8s):
Wouldn't even No, no, no, no. You wouldn't even

4 (29m 9s):
Do the fake hack thing. You would, you would seek out a scheme and get hacked on purpose.

0 (29m 14s):
The first one is worse than the second one. Justin Fields winning a Super Bowl would hurt way less than Jordan. Love taking the Bears playoff spot and then winning a Super Bowl. Yeah. That would be way more painful. Yeah. Way, way more painful. Justin Fields would hurt, but I would just be like, I would do the, I'd be the meme with the smiley face crying behind it and being like, I love Justin Fields. He's the, I he's a great dude. I'm so happy for him. That's what I would say over and over until I had a nervous breakdown. Max

5 (29m 43s):
We're we don't actually believe that these things are.

0 (29m 45s):
No. What's the worst thing that could happen for you?

5 (29m 48s):
I think it's simply if Ja Jalen hurts, he can't have an another bad year. Yeah. He has to have a good year. Yeah.

4 (29m 55s):
You think you, would it be worse if he had like a average year?

6 (29m 59s):
You gotta have a good year and losing the Super Bowl or

4 (30m 1s):
Have a bad year. That's what I'm saying. Or, or he gets to the Super Bowl and you lose again.

5 (30m 6s):
Right now I'm gonna say losing the Super Bowl. 'cause then it's like, alright now you know, like he got to the Super Bowl twice. He's a Super

4 (30m 13s):
Bowl then, then he becomes can't win the big one.

5 (30m 16s):
I but can't win the big ones. Not a, a terrible spot to bid.

0 (30m 21s):
Eh? It's pretty bad. Ask Dan Marino that.

5 (30m 23s):
Ask Peyton Manning that.

0 (30m 24s):
Yeah. But then he won the big one. Yeah.

5 (30m 26s):
Correct. But what if he did not, not at this point in his career phase and can't win. We the big this. But

0 (30m 30s):
You think, but what if he could never win the big one?

5 (30m 31s):
We're saying,

4 (30m 32s):
Do you think he enjoyed the phase of his career where he couldn't win the big one?

5 (30m 36s):
But that's not worse than him like playing badly and then you're like, oh shit, this was our guy that we have. Because he is gonna play well enough that you're not gonna be in a rebuilding situation. Like he needs to be good enough to win a win a Super Bowl.

0 (30m 52s):
Okay. This is, I mean this is a big year for this podcast in football. Yeah. Outside of Hank.

5 (30m 58s):
I think he's on autopilot. I think Eagle, this is a huge for the Eagles. It's, it's like a make or break year. Like if they

0 (31m 3s):
Yeah, no, it's a, yeah, it is a make or break year.

5 (31m 6s):
Like at least your two teams. It's like you have young, all, all, I mean, I mean, Hank's team fucking sucks. But like your two teams at least it's like, okay, we're moving in the right direction. Yeah. Like the Eagles could just take it. I, this is, I I don't think this is gonna happen, but we're talking worst case scenario. Like it could, it could, it could be bad of like going in the wrong direction.

4 (31m 27s):
This could be a bad year in Philadelphia if

5 (31m 29s):
I don't think it's gonna happen. But it's, but it's possible. Yeah. And I And it And it scares me. Hank, you're you're going nowhere.

6 (31m 39s):
That's fine. Going to the top of the draft. Just won an NBA championship. Six Super Bowls. We're chilling. We,

4 (31m 49s):
The funny thing is that no matter how bad things get, I think memes has the most rock bottom worst case scenario by far. I mean, he'd become a terrorist.

0 (31m 60s):
Yeah. Memes outside of having to kill yourself with a suicide vest. What's the worst thing that could happen this year? Just

7 (32m 5s):
Him getting hurt at all.

5 (32m 7s):
Because

7 (32m 8s):
I think even if he sucks, it's better than watching Tim Boyle that season. Last year was the worst season of all time

5 (32m 16s):
Tyro though.

0 (32m 16s):
Do, do you know what the craziest thing about like in And it, the eve of the NF NFL season? The craziest thing that can be said right now for this podcast. Because you know what me and PFT think about our guys, you know, max is very excited. He thinks what happened at the end of last year is not gonna happen again.

4 (32m 33s):
I don't know that Max is excited though. I think he's excited. I think he's, I think he's nervous.

0 (32m 37s):
He might be nervous a little bit.

4 (32m 38s):
I think he's got nerves going into this season.

0 (32m 40s):
But the craziest thing, I I think memes is by far and away the most confident person in his team and his team is the New York Jets. Yeah. Is that fair to say?

7 (32m 49s):
Yeah. I mean the roster's loaded.

0 (32m 51s):
Yeah. He, he memes is like, this is going to be an incredible team.

4 (32m 55s):
Yeah. I mean it, it doesn't,

0 (32m 57s):
He might be right. It

4 (32m 58s):
Doesn't sound good though, saying the worst possible scenario is that if Aaron Rogers gets hurt at all because he's 40 years old, basically 41 and

0 (33m 8s):
Almost 42.

4 (33m 9s):
Just banking on, on him. Not ever getting hurt. Seems like you're, you're setting yourself up for devastation.

7 (33m 16s):
No, he's not. He's just not gonna get hurt.

5 (33m 18s):
Memes is the wildest fan at like, memes always thinks best case scenario at all. Like he tells me every single day that the Mets are gonna win the NL east.

7 (33m 27s):
They, they could still come back

0 (33m 30s):
To win the NL East. Yes.

7 (33m 31s):
They play the Philly seven times. They're down seven

0 (33m 33s):
And a half. How many games do they doubt? Seven and a half. Yeah. Okay. So they just gotta win all of 'em. Yep. Okay. Alright. Anything else before we do Hot. Seat Cool. Throne, do you want, do wanna go Super Bowl

4 (33m 43s):
Winners? Wanna do MVPs?

0 (33m 45s):
I have Matt, Matt Stafford. It's off the board. I mean, it's not off the board but it's, it's a little bit of a dark horse. I

4 (33m 51s):
Got Jared Goff, Do

0 (33m 52s):
I like that.

4 (33m 53s):
Do I. So Do I. I got Jerry Goff. So here's a fun stat about Jerry Goff. 14 out of his 17 games are in a dome.

0 (34m 1s):
He's a lot of Dome Dome. He

4 (34m 2s):
Loves Dome. He loves Dome. It's gonna be Dome Fest. Yeah,

0 (34m 6s):
He's, I I like that pick. I like that pick.

4 (34m 8s):
And what, what are his odds? I think they're like 25 to one. Something like that. 30 to one?

0 (34m 14s):
Yeah. He only has like three bad weather game or, or maybe it's two bad weather games. 'cause one of the third, I can't

4 (34m 20s):
Remember. He's got the two NFC North games.

0 (34m 22s):
Right. And they're later in the season. I can't remember what the other outdoor game was, but Yeah. And if they, you know, if they, if they're the number one seed, could you just play the whole season in Dome? Yeah. Which would be awesome for our friend Jared. They ha he has Oh yeah, the other, so the third outdoor game is against the 49 ERs. So that won't,

4 (34m 43s):
It's not bad at all.

0 (34m 44s):
Yeah. Yeah. He plays the Bears in December, late December. And he plays the Packers in early December.

4 (34m 52s):
I got something fun to be honest.

0 (34m 53s):
I'm sorry. Actually the Packers are in early November, so that might not even bad be bad weather either.

4 (34m 57s):
So I was thinking about Comeback Player of the Year. Right? Because it feels like Go If. you had asked me like three weeks ago. It felt like Aaron Rogers seems like he would be the shoe in for Comeback Player of the Year. Now we've got a couple wild cards. Ricky Pearsall from the 49 ERs. Yep. Got shot during an attempted robbery in San Francisco. Got the gun from the guy shot the guy that was trying to rob him. He got

0 (35m 21s):
Shot through the chest,

4 (35m 22s):
He got shot through the chest and then shot the robber and he goes to the hospital, he's out 24 hours later. The next day he's at the facility working out

0 (35m 34s):
Shot through the chest. I don't even understand that.

4 (35m 36s):
It doesn't make any sense. Yeah,

0 (35m 38s):
That seems but that's like, that seems like a, a comeback player of

4 (35m 41s):
The year. Seems like he's a dog. Yeah. Seems like he's a dog. And then I was reminded that Tank Dell also got shot this off season. Yep. And he's fine. So now you've got two guys who got shot battling for Comeback Player of the Year potentially at Wide Receiver. But Pearsall got shot through the chest and he shot the guy that shot him.

0 (35m 59s):
What about a couple other like what about Kirk Cousins?

4 (36m 4s):
Kirk Cousins? Not bad.

0 (36m 5s):
What about Joe Burrow?

4 (36m 6s):
Joe Burrow,

0 (36m 7s):
There's a lot of Guy Stacked Field. Yeah. When we had a lot of injuries last year. Anthony Richardson. If,

4 (36m 12s):
If Anthony Richardson gets hurt this season and I don't want him to, and Flaco gets in and goes on a run, could Flaco win back to back Comeback players of the year? He

0 (36m 20s):
Could. I think he could. Tamar Hamlin could.

4 (36m 22s):
Yeah.

0 (36m 23s):
Still

4 (36m 24s):
Coming back from the punt.

0 (36m 25s):
Yeah. I mean we lost so many, we lost so many quarterbacks last year that there's, this is a stack, stack field. Yeah. I mean, Justin Herbert could he? Why not? Yeah. Come back Player of the year. I'm looking right now. Sam Donalds was Oh, Nick Chubb. Nick ub. I'm Nick Chubb. He

4 (36m 43s):
Probably won't be back until like midway through the season. Mm.

0 (36m 46s):
I heard different reports. Would You

4 (36m 48s):
Heard,

0 (36m 48s):
I heard, I heard from an insider, careful

4 (36m 51s):
Hippo.

0 (36m 51s):
This might be because I drafted him in the fantasy league that he's the commissioner of. But I heard that Nick Chubb, if they, they could have, he could have played as early as week one with a few touches. Okay. But they want, they thought it'd be safer just to put him on the pup.

4 (37m 6s):
So, so you're inside information is that He feels good.

0 (37m 10s):
Could play right now.

4 (37m 11s):
Could play right now. If, you had to could

0 (37m 12s):
Play right now. Report it.

4 (37m 13s):
A couple touches.

0 (37m 14s):
Could play right now. Right now. Like right this second if we're like, Hey Nick Chubb carry this football done.

4 (37m 21s):
Yeah. So I'm still gonna go with the gunshot guys. Yeah. I feel like, I feel like Ricky pe that's just a crazy story. Crazy.

0 (37m 28s):
And he's a rookie so he just has to have like a average rookie season to be comeback player of the

4 (37m 33s):
Year. So Yeah. Can you come back? Can you get Comeback Player of the year as a rookie?

0 (37m 37s):
I don't, I don't know. I don't really.

4 (37m 38s):
I think you can if you're coming back from being shot in the chest.

0 (37m 40s):
Yeah, I think so. I don't think so. I think so. He got shot through just rookie of the year. Through the chest. Through the chest. Alright. What's your Super? Bowl picks. I have Chiefs over Lions.

4 (37m 57s):
I got Lions Over Chiefs.

0 (37m 58s):
Oh, I like that. I'd much prefer that

5 (38m 1s):
Eagles over Chiefs.

0 (38m 2s):
Oh, little revenge.

5 (38m 4s):
It'll be the same story arc as Eagle

0 (38m 6s):
Patriots. Same story arc that Eagle's Patriots tickets. Two tickets that you

5 (38m 11s):
No, that that,

0 (38m 12s):
Oh yeah. That story arc will be different. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That story a no no, no, no, no. If you, if the Eagles are in the Super Bowl, we're doing the same deal. You're gonna get drunk the night before. You're gonna drink champagne. You're gonna wear the pants. We're gonna make fun of you. We're gonna throw your phone in the water. You're gonna puke

4 (38m 24s):
Us. We're gonna,

0 (38m 25s):
We're we're literally just gonna play it back. People love the first version.

5 (38m 30s):
I think the city of Philadelphia would legitimately murder me. I think. I think they would assassinate.

0 (38m 35s):
We made 'em put on the pants. I

4 (38m 37s):
Mean, but what a, what a story that would be. It's like Max has the opportunity to either win a Super Bowl or probably get killed.

0 (38m 42s):
Yeah. That's a, that's a past stake story. Hank, you're a Super Bowl.

6 (38m 50s):
I kind of had what PFT had, so I don't wanna copy it. I'll think of best case content for this show.

0 (38m 58s):
Bills

6 (38m 60s):
Losing to the Packers.

0 (39m 1s):
Oh, you've,

4 (39m 3s):
Why, why is that best case?

0 (39m 5s):
He know? Because he just, he is, listen, there's a, there's a theme. Hank's had it out for me this week. I think what it is is as soon as Hank has is blaming the end of summer on me. I think that's what it is. No,

6 (39m 18s):
That's just a fact. That's the best case. Tyler been digested. I don't think, I don't,

0 (39m 21s):
Tyler, the Matt Eber flu sees

6 (39m 23s):
The Wisconsin thing was coincidence. I just happened to be walking that

0 (39m 25s):
Game. You're, but you're, I I am now

6 (39m 28s):
Ebra flu

0 (39m 29s):
Held around, you're being accountable for, for the calendar changing. I think that's what's happening.

6 (39m 34s):
I don't think the Bears like the best case obviously would be the Bears or the commanders making the Super Bowl. I don't think they're there yet. Okay. A couple years away. What about

0 (39m 43s):
Matt e Both

4 (39m 44s):
Dan Quinn and Matt Eber. Yeah.

0 (39m 45s):
We kept them around for a reason. Right. But

6 (39m 47s):
I don't, I don't think a rookie QB would be. That'd be impressive. But I don't think it's gonna happen this year. So for the content's sake of the show, I guess Eagles losing who, who'd be good for the Eagles to lose to Eagles. Losing to the bills would be great.

0 (40m 0s):
What about Eagles? Losing to the Jets?

6 (40m 3s):
Yeah.

0 (40m 6s):
Oh

6 (40m 8s):
Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Right.

0 (40m 10s):
Means that would be Super Bowl. That would be the two. I mean, we would all have to go to the Super Bowl with them. Yeah. And just sit there and just watch them.

5 (40m 18s):
That would get awkward.

0 (40m 20s):
What do you mean? I,

5 (40m 21s):
I don't know. I like, it would get uncomfortable. That

0 (40m 23s):
Would in the, in the booth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gross. It would be great. Holy shit. Good. We would just flip it. So good. We'd flip all the cameras for like a couple weeks afterwards where the show is like, we're just sitting here. We're the booth and you guys are the show. Oh my God. Oh, that'd be great. Oh my God.

6 (40m 40s):
Yeah. No, that's, that would be great.

0 (40m 41s):
Hey, what a pick. Okay. Memes. What's your pick?

4 (40m 45s):
Jet's. Eagles.

0 (40m 46s):
Okay. Great. Pick that. That's such a good pick. You guys are uncomfortable right now thinking about it.

4 (40m 54s):
Yeah, I'm, I'm a little bit uncomfortable too. 'cause I, you know what Max would do to memes?

0 (40m 59s):
What?

4 (41m 1s):
It'd be bad.

5 (41m 2s):
No, I think meme, no memes would make, memes would make me angrier or

4 (41m 8s):
Yeah. Oh yeah. And then you'd do something bad. We'd probably fight.

5 (41m 11s):
Yeah. It would get, it would

0 (41m 13s):
Get bad. It would get physical

4 (41m 14s):
Max. You know, it would get, it

0 (41m 15s):
Would be awkward. I wouldn't like it at all. I'm gonna say right now, I, I, I don't have the power to do this, but I'll talk to Dave. I think that if the Jets and Eagles play in the Super Bowl, I think physicality is allowed. Like, we'll just, we'll just rip up the contracts in like a, a one week. Like, if one of you punches the other person that no repercussions, physicality allowed or

4 (41m 36s):
They have to watch the Super Bowl with giant inflatable boxing gloves on Yeah. At all times. Or no, like they grease up the light poles in Philly. We will just grease memes up. So you can't really get a good head. Yeah.

0 (41m 46s):
I mean, it would be a good story for the show where it's just like, yeah, remember when the Eagles and Jets played in the Super Bowl and memes and Max got in a fist fight?

9 (41m 56s):
That would be no good.

0 (41m 58s):
I would be, I wanna see you guys fight so bad.

9 (42m 1s):
That'd be no good.

0 (42m 3s):
Oh. Alright.

4 (42m 4s):
Do we wanna do least improved player?

0 (42m 5s):
Yeah. Least improved player

4 (42m 7s):
Dak.

0 (42m 8s):
I like that.

4 (42m 9s):
I just don't think it is, it is not gonna be any different. He's gonna be fine.

0 (42m 13s):
Make a, make a graphic for our whole show.

4 (42m 15s):
Least improved player PardonMyTake of my take D

0 (42m 17s):
Prescott. Yeah. Dak Prescott. Yes. Yes. Perfect. We have five votes. Yeah.

4 (42m 22s):
He's, I mean, I'm not, I'm not saying he's gonna have a bad season.

0 (42m 24s):
No. He's just not gonna improve at all.

4 (42m 26s):
Yeah.

0 (42m 26s):
Unanimous on the ground. Unanim unanimous vote first ever. Unanimous. Fuck yeah.

4 (42m 33s):
Hey, do you agree?

6 (42m 34s):
I was thinking Jalen hurts, but I'm fine with unanimous.

4 (42m 36s):
Okay. Oh, Jalen hurts. Oh

0 (42m 38s):
Dang. He just ruined unanimous.

4 (42m 40s):
He had my, I said I'm fine with it. He had my second place vote. Yeah.

0 (42m 43s):
All right. Let's do Hot Seat Cool throw. And then we'll get to our interviews. We got more football with Pete Prisco. And then an awesome interview with Forrest Gallant.

Hank your Hot Seat qui throne.

6 (43m 44s):
My Hot Seat is the USC Trojans. Oh, college football's back. College football hype videos are back. Yes. Yeah. And USC posted a video before their game where they were in a Trojan horse, but USC was inside the Trojan Horse.

0 (44m 4s):
Okay.

6 (44m 5s):
But the Trojan horse story is how the Greeks used the Trojan horse to defeat the Trojans.

4 (44m 10s):
To defeat the Trojans. Yeah, I gotcha. But they're taking it back.

6 (44m 13s):
So USC did a video where the Trojans were in a Trojan horse going to defeat the

4 (44m 19s):
Greeks. The Greeks

6 (44m 20s):
Or Notre Dame or whoever it was. Yeah. But that didn't,

0 (44m 23s):
L-S-U-L-S-U

6 (44m 24s):
Didn't make anything.

0 (44m 27s):
College football expert.

4 (44m 28s):
Yeah, that's, I mean that's interesting. but it's like, like they learned from their mistake. So now they developed it as their own weapon. Yeah.

6 (44m 35s):
But why would you, why would, why would the Trojans deliver a tro? Like who wants a Trojan gift if you're not a Trojan?

0 (44m 42s):
True. Yeah.

4 (44m 43s):
If, you brought the Greeks a bunch of like a Trojan horse. It'd be like, we've got like seven Trojan horses back there. We use one in each war. Yeah. We know this trick. Yeah. Yeah. That, that's the dumbest prank to ever succeed, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. I'll take this giant horse for some reason that you're dropping off.

0 (44m 59s):
Oh yeah. I want this horse in my house.

4 (45m 0s):
I'll put it right in the middle of our town. Makes no sense. And then we're all gonna get drunk and celebrate and pass out around the horse like Burning Man. Yeah.

0 (45m 6s):
They, the Trojans deserve to, to lose that one.

4 (45m 9s):
Yeah. They got the wool pulled over their eyes. I also, I thought for a long time that the Statue of Liberty was a Trojan horse from France. Oh. And I think that they just didn't find the exit. So there's like thousands of dead French skeletons inside it.

0 (45m 20s):
I like that idea. Yeah. Yeah. I think that might be true. You might be

4 (45m 23s):
On something. I think so. Are you cool

0 (45m 24s):
Throwing

6 (45m 25s):
My Is us Open? Oh, we do talk a lot about how bad some sports are set up. I like the way the US Open is set up where they do it at the end of last week going into Labor Day. It's on during Labor Day, but it's not the big matches. So it's like you can kind of watch as you're going and then it ramps up like it's On today. It's on tomorrow. It's on Thursday. Oh. And the big matches are are this weekend.

0 (45m 48s):
Yeah. By the way. We were But

0 (45m 60s):
We, they, they do play during college football Saturday, which I know you don't care about. But that, that is the final for the women's. So like you're trying to watch Kent State Pittsburgh and they're just, Ugh. That's crazy. Also, correction from Tuesday show the FedEx Cup championship. Yeah. Actually was a week late this year because of the Olympics. So it is usually a week before.

4 (46m 23s):

That makes sense.

4 (46m 25s):
Our bad. Yeah, our bad. Emma Navarro is in the semi-finals, the American, you remember her? She took that p the selfie with LeBron at the Olympics, smiling through it all. Can't believe this is my life with LeBron. I think she's one of the two billionaires that we've got. It's her and then the, the daughter or the granddaughter of the bills owner. We've got just the richest people that played tennis for us. In your face world. Yeah.

0 (46m 49s):

0 (48m 48s):
Okay. What, what Mr. Pear has to hit, hit what? For us to be like

A success? Yeah. I'd say 60%.

0 (48m 55s):
60% is 60 high? Yeah.

4 (48m 58s):
So,

0 (48m 58s):
Okay. Yeah. That's,

4 (48m 59s):
That's for him to be like a legend. Right. You're right,

0 (49m 1s):
You're right. 50,

4 (49m 1s):
56%. You get your money back. Yep. 54%, 56, depending on what the,

0 (49m 7s):
No, 52 and a half.

4 (49m 9s):
52 and a half.

0 (49m 10s):
Yeah. But he, yeah, he's got it. You're right. Because he's, he's up against Larry.

4 (49m 13s):
And Larry was what, like 60?

0 (49m 15s):
I think he was 60. Hank has the tattoo. Do you have the picks? Oh, it's gone. That's right.

4 (49m 21s):
Would you get a Mr Pair tattoo if he went 65%?

0 (49m 26s):

4 (49m 27s):
Yeah, I would too. If

0 (49m 28s):
You goes 65% match.

4 (49m 29s):
Definitely. I'd match.

6 (49m 32s):
I think it was 59, 34 and two or 58. 34 and two.

4 (49m 34s):
You had it, you had it on your leg.

6 (49m 36s):
I know it's one of those 59 and 58.

0 (50m 6s):
A random

7 (50m 6s):
Dude. And then we'll pull up the wood and then he goes to the

4 (50m 9s):
Face. You guys never had a random dude stay over in your apartment?

0 (50m 11s):
I've always known who the dude was.

4 (50m 13s):
I've woken up several times to a random dude in my apartment.

5 (50m 17s):
I, I also, memes is Meme just keeps buying TVs. And he doesn't have any TV stands and he doesn't hang 'em up. Oh,

7 (50m 22s):
Come on.

0 (50m 23s):
What? Yes. He just,

5 (50m 24s):
He, every week he tells me he buys another tv and then he, he, I'm like, where do you put

0 (50m 28s):
'em? Where are you putting

5 (50m 28s):
'em? Mem. He's like, they're

7 (50m 29s):
On the floor. They're on the floor. So

Memes. There's four in my living room and one,

0 (50m 38s):
One. And then none of 'em are

7 (50m 38s):
On stands. One, there's one, one on a stand. It's a nice setup. And what

Are the other things?

7 (50m 43s):
They're all the same size.

4 (50m 45s):
Okay. That is nice.

0 (50m 46s):
Okay. But where are the other three on

The floor means? Are they all the same brand?

7 (50m 50s):
All the same brand? Okay. That's

4 (50m 51s):
Good.

7 (51m 1s):
Have YouTube tv. Yeah. Are

0 (51m 2s):
You, are you doing, are you addicted to TVs?

Know, you, there's so many games. Watch, you can watch it with YouTube tv. You can watch four games on one.

7 (51m 11s):
Yeah. but it just doesn't look the same.

0 (51m 13s):
Okay. It's

6 (51m 14s):
True. I mean, you have a thousand TVs, but

0 (51m 16s):
Are I tv I'm not Listen, but they're all in their correct place. I don't have 'em on the ground. You're right. I shouldn't judge. I was watching nine games on Saturday. It was awesome.

4 (51m 28s):
I kinda love that though. I, I love the freedom of having an apartment where you just put your TVs on. Yeah.

7 (51m 33s):
All right. Just sent it.

0 (51m 35s):
Oh my God. Memes. This is ridiculous. What does your girlfriend think?

7 (51m 44s):
I don't have one.

0 (51m 45s):
Oh, no way.

6 (51m 48s):
This isn't bad. There's stands, there's little stands.

0 (51m 52s):
That's the most single guy apartment ever. Oh, I am jealous memes. That's how you living the life you're sitting there. You gotta put it in the, in the video episode.

6 (52m 2s):
I feel like you're sitting like on a lawn chair too. Make

7 (52m 4s):
Sure I'm sitting on my beanbag chair.

4 (52m 5s):
Yeah. And I, I love, I love the presentation too. Yeah, because it feels like you're, you're recreating like a cinema

0 (52m 11s):
Pug. Make sure you put this in the video so people can watch it when they're watching the episode. It's

7 (52m 15s):
Perfectly symmetrical. Oh,

0 (52m 17s):
Alright. So Mr. Pears of the Hot, Seat and memes has an addiction to tv. I want you to get memes. I might fund you to just get as I might fund your TV addiction. If. you promise to never hang any of 'em.

5 (52m 30s):
They all have to be on the tv.

0 (52m 31s):
I wanna see, I wanna see like nine TVs on the floor.

7 (52m 35s):
Nine. Nine. Yeah.

5 (52m 37s):
You could get a couple little ones and put 'em in like in between the cracks, you know? Yeah. It's

7 (52m 41s):
Be like

4 (52m 42s):
SoCal basement where he has all his former recruits just like leaning up against the wall. Yeah. Yeah.

0 (52m 47s):
Do you, you literally, like, if you're, if you're like, oh man, I'm capped out on TV's, boom. Gonna order another one. Is it like that spur of the moment?

7 (52m 55s):
Yeah, it's like a new toy. Awesome.

0 (52m 59s):
That's so awesome.

7 (52m 60s):
You play video games on one. Oh

4 (53m 2s):
Yeah.

0 (53m 2s):
It me's living his best life. Do you have any furniture in your house?

7 (53m 6s):
I, I have a couch.

0 (53m 7s):
But you're on the beanbag chair. On the beanbag chair because it's better eye level for the TV's on the floor.

7 (53m 12s):
Yeah.

4 (53m 13s):
Do you have, do you have a table?

7 (53m 19s):
I have a

4 (53m 22s):
One table.

5 (53m 22s):
That sounds like a No.

7 (53m 23s):
And I, no, no, no. I was trying to think of the term. An island. Right.

4 (53m 27s):
Okay. Okay. But that's it. You have a, an island, so you don't have a coffee table. What's on the island is, is it like counter height?

7 (53m 32s):
Yeah, counter

4 (53m 33s):
Height. Counter height island. I have two little

7 (53m 35s):
Chairs. I have a, I actually have a pretty nice apartment.

4 (53m 38s):
Yeah, you got a bunch of TVs. Bunch

7 (53m 39s):
Of TVs. But you don't have a coffee table? Don't have, I have two end tables. Okay. This

4 (53m 44s):
Is awesome. Memes. I would love to go over to your apartment. Just house beers on Saturday. Yeah.

0 (53m 48s):
Just hang out

4 (53m 49s):
And hang out. Sounds like a cool hang apartment. Yeah.

0 (53m 52s):
Okay. What's your cool throne? P ft.

4 (53m 54s):
My cool throne. That's a good question. What is my cool

0 (53m 57s):
Throne?

4 (53m 57s):
Me? Yeah. I mean, memes, apartment rocks. My Cool Throne's. Max Hoa. Max Hoa has been named to the President's Cup team. Let's go. It's Captain's pick. Let's go.

0 (54m 5s):
And

4 (54m 6s):
I don't, when, when is the President's Cup hank? Every two years.

0 (54m 11s):
Yeah. It's off years of the Rider

4 (54m 13s):
Cup, Hank. Right. So it's, I think this summer, this summer coming up. So we don't know who the president's gonna be, but good for Max Hoa. He loves both Kamala and Donald Trump. Yes. So he is gonna be excited to represent whoever the president might, or RFK Junior. He's a big RFK junior guy too. Yes. Yes. So he is excited to represent the office of the presidency. He, he did play well in the Ryder Cup, right? Yeah. Max. Max is a, a country first kind of guy. Yeah.

0 (54m 35s):
He did that when we were like, he was the only, he and Brooks were like the only two shining hopes that, that last day

4 (54m 42s):
I kinda like Arage this year. Yeah.

0 (54m 44s):
Alright. My Hot Seat is Billy Napier. We talked about him. Florida head coach. He's already fired per PFT. But

4 (54m 51s):
He's supposed to be sa

0 (54m 52s):
Billy. Billy Napier is on the Hot Seat because, you know, it's going bad for a head coach when he is taking shots at the people on social media in the basements. So he said, if we can focus on those things, talking about good football and not what some guy in his basement in rural central Florida is saying on social media, then we've got a chance to get better. Right. Also, our colleague Nikki Smokes, who is from Florida, pointed out they don't have basements in Florida.

4 (55m 20s):
That's what I was looking up right now. Yeah. And especially not in central Florida because it's a swamp. Correct. The water table's too high. Correct. You can't dig down into the basement. If anything, you're like staying in, in an apartment with your mom. Right. Right.

0 (55m 33s):
So a

4 (55m 34s):
Guy who moved back in with his mom,

0 (55m 36s):
You're in a condominium.

4 (55m 37s):
Yeah. You're, yeah. Yes.

0 (55m 38s):
Yeah. The, but either way, the minute a, a football coach brings out the basement, social media basement, it's over.

4 (55m 45s):
Yeah. Not a good start. It's also early flight tracking season for college football. Yes. Because there's been flights, people are now monitoring flights from Gainesville to Oxford, Mississippi right now. Oh. And they're speculating. I flight tracking season's, the best you guys know, I love flight tracking season, but they're all over it. So now they're thinking maybe Lane Kiffin, but it also just could be any jet that goes from Gainesville to Oxford. Yes.

0 (56m 8s):
Yes. Alright, then Mike. Cool Throne is Jay Cutler, because Chris and Cavalier said that her boyfriend, Mark Estes, Montana boy, who's 13 years younger than her, she's having the best sex she's ever had.

4 (56m 22s):
That's a bit predatory, isn't it?

0 (56m 24s):
It is, but it's also If. you have to publicly say you're having the best sex you ever had. You're lying.

4 (56m 29s):
You're either doing that because you're lying. Yeah. Or you're doing it just because you know that Jay Cutler will see it. Correct. And get angry.

0 (56m 35s):
So J one, because that's, you don't, you don't just come out and be like, oh, I'm having the best sex ever. That's You're lying. And, and J one,

4 (56m 42s):
I'm having the best sex ever. Yeah.

0 (56m 45s):
Lying,

4 (56m 45s):
Lying, lying. Lie. I'm having awful, I'm having the worst sex in my life right now. Yeah,

0 (56m 50s):
That's true. Fuck.

4 (56m 52s):
So you can't, so you just don't talk about your sex.

0 (56m 54s):
Exactly. If. you don't talk about your sex. You can just, people just assume you're having the best sex ever. The minute you say you have the best sex ever, everyone's like, dude, that's a lie.

4 (57m 1s):
I'm having no sex. What does that mean? You're

0 (57m 4s):
Telling the truth.

4 (57m 5s):
Fuck.

0 (57m 9s):

0 (58m 42s):
When he was winning Super Bowls. He's like, this guy's gonna stink at some point when he is like 36. Pete Prisco Pete, we are on the eve of the NF NFL season. There's no better, there's no better time Right before the NF NFL season starts. Let's start here. What's the spiciest take you got right now that everyone's coming after you for that. You think you're gonna be right and everyone else is wrong.

4 (59m 6s):
The Packer's gonna win the Super Bowl.

0 (59m 8s):
Oh, you motherfucker.

4 (59m 11s):
I knew you would love that.

0 (59m 12s):
God damnit.

4 (59m 14s):
Why the

0 (59m 15s):
Schedule

4 (59m 15s):
Of, is this, is this a schedule thing? 'cause we remember last year with the Jaguars No, we looked at the schedule. No, you had 'em at what, 12 wins last year? Yeah.

10 (59m 23s):
13, I think.

4 (59m 24s):
13. 13 wins. Yeah.

10 (59m 26s):
Well they were, they went, they went in in November as the number one seed. You forget about that on a Sunday night. And the quarterback got hurt. Let's not forget about that.

0 (59m 32s):
Oh, okay. Right. So yeah, no, you're right. You're right on that. They were never gonna get to the Super Bowl. But the Packers are your, your Super Bowl champions. Why, besides Jordan, love being what seems like a a, you know, an up and coming superstar with how he finished last year. Why is it so different? Well,

10 (59m 52s):
Because a, I think you get those receivers all together now. They didn't play barely at all together last year. Watson's on the field, he's a big, big play Receiver. You're gonna open things up with that guy. Then you look at the running game, I think they're more physical in the running game than they've been. The offensive line will be bigger and stronger, but more than, you know, we know it's love, but more than on the other side of the ball, they weren't very good. But now they bring in a defensive coordinator and Jeff Halfly who can get after it. They're gonna be aggressive. They're gonna play more press, man. They're gonna attack the quarterback. I love what they've done on defense and I love what they're doing on offense. They're the best team in that division. I don't want to hear it, but they are,

0 (1h 0m 32s):
Are you now counterpoint to what you said. Obviously their win Thanksgiving day was impressive against the Lions and they beat the Chiefs who were reeling at that moment. Are you worried though, that there was maybe a little smoke and mirrors with how they finished the season when needing three wins to get in the playoffs and they beat the Panthers? Barely the Vikings on their third, third quarterback and my Bears who sucked, who I deluded myself thinking they could win that game to get into the playoffs.

10 (1h 1m 3s):
Yeah, but don't, you could flip it forward, say they went down to Dallas and beat the Cowboys. Okay, fine. Yeah. And then went to the 49 ERs and should have won that game. They should have

0 (1h 1m 11s):
Won that game. Yeah. I'm just, I'm, I'm looking at being like that last, that the end of their season last year was a complete fluke and they suck. No. So I understand. That's stupid.

10 (1h 1m 19s):
Yeah. You're hoping, you're wishing. Yeah.

4 (1h 1m 22s):
But Pete, isn't it fair to say like, we don't have enough body of evidence, not enough body of work with Jordan Love.

10 (1h 1m 29s):
Wait, you say that about CJ Stroud too? Does anybody say that about him?

4 (1h 1m 33s):
Mm, I think, yeah, they, Do I mean they, they say he's really, really good, but they say it's it's his rookie year. He just did it once. They're not giving him a, a massive contract after, after that, obviously.

10 (1h 1m 42s):
Yeah. But from that, if they could, they would though. That's true. From that stand, from that standpoint, you're, you make a good point. Both of 'em probably have to do it all over again. But haven't you seen enough to give you an idea that you're, you're a believer in both of, okay. I'll give you, I'll I'll give you an this for you. If Jade Daniels goes out and throws 28 touchdown passes and seven interceptions and Washington wins nine games, are you gonna say that, that he can't do it again?

4 (1h 2m 6s):
No. Absolutely not. Okay. No, absolutely. But that's because I already know he's that good going into in my mind. 'cause he won the Heisman last year. What did Jordan Love do last year?

10 (1h 2m 16s):
He was, he went to the play deep into the

4 (1h 2m 17s):
Playoffs. No, I mean, I mean the year before that, the year before he

10 (1h 2m 20s):
Played, he wa he's watched a lot of football from the bench. I get

4 (1h 2m 24s):
It. Yeah. He So

0 (1h 2m 24s):
Have I He's 32 years old. He's been there for forever. Okay, good, good, good one to start with. That was a good way to to to get it, get it spicy off the, off the writ. I saw

4 (1h 2m 34s):
Another somewhat spicy take that you had. You did your list of the a hundred best players. You had Patrick Mahomes, number one. Overall the NFL players disagree with you. Would they have him? I think

0 (1h 2m 43s):
Two or three. Two or

4 (1h 2m 44s):
Three. Yeah.

10 (1h 2m 45s):
That's mystifying to me.

4 (1h 2m 47s):
That's a hot take by Pete putting him at number one. Crazy.

10 (1h 2m 50s):
He might be the, by the way, if he wins the Super Bowl this year and three Petes, he's in the conversation is the greatest football player of all time already.

4 (1h 2m 58s):
Good point. Good point. Hank doesn't have his headphones on right now. Yeah.

0 (1h 3m 2s):
Pete Patrick wants would be the greatest. Pete, you know how I know the Chiefs are gonna probably be back in the Super Bowl. Is that the conversation now when you're trying to pick them apart is like, they'll just like get tired of winning and it's hard to win three, they're, they might be better this year. They probably are better this year than they were last year because last year they weren't through the body of work of the, of the regular season. Weren't a great team. They obviously got great in the, in the playoffs. They're, they seem like they might be a better team this year. Would you? Would you agree?

10 (1h 3m 32s):
Yes, absolutely. Last year was the year to get 'em and nobody got 'em. I mean it's easy to go into every season and say, okay, I'll take the Chiefs against the field because they're that good. The coach is that good. Think about this. Andy Reed coaches, until he is 70, has a chance to get the wins record. We all thought it was gonna be Belichick, but Andy Reed actually has a chance to get that coach quarterback. Of course they're better than they were a year ago. They have speed now on offense. They could stretch the field. It's a better team. But winning three in a row, it's never happened for a reason. It's never happened for a reason.

0 (1h 4m 6s):
Right. You just did it right there. You did the like this is what we're gonna pick apart on the Chiefs. So if the chiefs weren't to go to the Super Bowl from the a FC, what are your other a FC teams that you're like, this is the year they're gonna take that step forward. Maybe knock off the Chiefs.

10 (1h 4m 18s):
You'll be happy. 'cause I got Buffalo going to the Super Bowl.

4 (1h 4m 22s):
Okay. Oh, I love that. Nice Pete. Oh

0 (1h 4m 24s):
My god. Buffalo versus the Packers. Could

10 (1h 4m 27s):
You

0 (1h 4m 27s):
Imagine I might have to get a Bills stat. I might have to get a Bills tattoo before that game,

4 (1h 4m 31s):
Pete. That would, that would make my day If, if the make my year, if the bills went to the Super Bowl, that'd be so awesome.

10 (1h 4m 36s):
You guys will know this. The whole idea of the window shutting on the bills is this stupid dumb talk that people throw out there when they don't pay attention to what's going on. As long as Josh Allen is slinging the football in Buffalo, they will have an open window period. End of story. Yeah. And everybody says, well they lost all these guys from a year ago. They didn't have most of those guys a year ago. TIUs White wasn't around. Matt Milano's hurt again. He wasn't there last year. The two safeties were banged up all year. The Quan Jones went down early in the season. The best run stuffer. Vaughn Miller was admittedly a shell of himself. And then they talk about Diggs, look what Diggs did in the last 10 games of the season.

10 (1h 5m 17s):
Nothing. Nothing. And it's addition by subtraction. So the way I look at it, Buffalo's gonna be a better team than they were a year ago. And they have a legitimate chance to go to the Super Bowl.

4 (1h 5m 27s):
Imagine all those Bills fans down New Orleans. They're gonna drink, drink so many beers. Oh

0 (1h 5m 31s):
Man,

4 (1h 5m 32s):
It's gonna be amazing. Insane.

10 (1h 5m 33s):
It would be wild. Could you Buffalo and Green Bay and the Super Bowl in New Orleans? It would just be And. it wouldn't be high-end drinking. You know, it'd be a lot of the the cheap stuff. That'd be fun.

0 (1h 5m 43s):
I I think that would be the fattest Super Bowl.

4 (1h 5m 46s):
Let's see.

0 (1h 5m 47s):
I think it would, yeah,

4 (1h 5m 48s):
Wisconsin definitely. Yeah.

0 (1h 5m 50s):
Buffalo. You got some

4 (1h 5m 51s):
Hat have the winter weight. It's

0 (1h 5m 52s):
More power in, in Buffalo than, than fat. But it's, it's power. They're

4 (1h 5m 56s):
Powerful people. You have to insulate yourself from the elements in Buffalo. Yeah.

0 (1h 5m 59s):
Yeah. Yeah.

10 (1h 5m 59s):
Beef, beef, beef on whack. You know, that's the way I love beef on whack.

4 (1h 6m 3s):
Yeah. They just eat food that keeps you warm. That's the trick of living in Buffalo. Yes. Yeah. Wings, all that stuff.

0 (1h 6m 8s):
Okay. So yeah. So, so other a FC teams that I want you to pick apart or tell me what, what your main like bugaboo is The Bengals, we're we're big believers in Joe Burrow. I think that the league has kind of forgotten about Joe Burrow 'cause he hasn't been playing. What, what do you think about the Bengals this season and do they have a team that could potentially get to the Super Bowl?

10 (1h 6m 28s):
Absolutely. As long as Joe Burrow's on the field, they're a contender. They're like the, they're like the bills. As long as that quarterback is on the field, they're a contender. They've gotten bigger and stronger in the offensive line. Now Mims is banged up, but when he's back, they're big physical offensive line and they're gonna have score a lot of points defensively. They need some guys to step up. But they have a lot of talent on that side. Particularly young guys, you know, the young secondary players. I think they're gonna be better than they've been on defense. but it all comes down to Burrow being on the field and availability's the best ability. And he hasn't exactly been there game in and game out, but I'm with you when he is on the field, he's fantastic.

4 (1h 7m 5s):
Okay, what about the Ravens? I know that you don't like Lamar that much because he's one of those running quarterbacks that you look down your nose on. But they, they should have done better in the play if they had run the ball in the second half against the Chiefs. We might be telling a different story. Right now. They got Derrick Henry Lamar is what, like 1215 pounds lighter than he was last year. Which by the way, I'm not so sure that's a good thing that Lamar Jackson is like 15 pounds lighter. The, the knock on Lamar Jackson was never, you know, this guy would be great if he wasn't so fat.

10 (1h 7m 34s):
Right. It was never that. It was, I don't understand why, why he wants to get leaner. You, you should be want that on your, but you know, 'cause he needs to be stronger. He is gonna take some shots. You know, by the way, I like Lamar Jackson, you're put, you're put, I don't like quarterbacks who immediately just run and he's gotten much better at not doing. Look at Josh Allen runs. I like Josh Allen. He runs a lot too. But their problem to me right now is their offensive line. You know, they're actually talking about rotating guys like they did last year series and series at Right Tackle and maybe left guard. I don't like that. I think you need to find five and settle on 'em. And they have issues on the offensive line and if they have problems on the offensive line, it's gonna be hard to rush, rush them, rush the football with Henry or whoever's running the ball.

0 (1h 8m 16s):
Okay. The Texans. The Texans. Would you say it's subtraction by adding Stefan Diggs? We'll say or I mean they'll, they, it is interesting because you, you know, last year was an aberration year where it's like, I can't believe we have this quarterback that's this good this young and they've got stud wide receivers and now you add add a guy like Stefan Diggs. Are you, what, what would be the hole of the Texans If? you were scouting them,

10 (1h 8m 42s):
Doing it again as a hunt team. I think that's, that's, you gotta learn how, you know, that was the same thing that Jacksonville ran into last year. You didn't know how to handle success. And does this team know how to handle success? You think they do, but you never know until you, until you get, you know, teams are gunning for you week in and week out. You're one of the better teams in the league. You have to learn how to handle that. And, and I'm not sure they can, the division's a lot tougher. I'm, I'm a big will Levi guy. I think the Titans are gonna be better. Anthony Richardson on the field. The Colts probably should have beat him in the last week of the season and they might not even made the playoffs. And here's the other thing. As much as we love CJ Stroud, you would've thought, the way we talk about him, he threw 40 touchdown passes.

10 (1h 9m 24s):
I think he threw 24 if I'm not mistaken. I mean it wasn't like it was Dan Marino throwing 48 in his second season. It's just so we gotta slow the role a little bit on this team. Digs, by the way, will be on his best behavior because he's on a one year deal.

4 (1h 9m 39s):
Mm. So he is, yeah. He's gonna make sure that he doesn't completely alienate every other team in the league. Correct.

10 (1h 9m 44s):
He wants to get another contract. Yeah,

0 (1h 9m 46s):
He threw 23 touchdowns I believe in the regular season last

10 (1h 9m 50s):
Year. Yeah, I mean that's, that's not a

0 (1h 9m 52s):
Good, he did miss two games. He did miss two games. But

10 (1h 9m 54s):
That's not a great number. It's not 40, it's not 37, it's not, you know what I mean? It's a, he's good. I I love what I've seen from the kid. But again, you gotta show us, just like you said about George Love show us again. But more than that, this young team has to show us again.

4 (1h 10m 10s):
Yeah. What about the New York Jets? They, there have been a lot of problems that weren't really problems this off season, but they felt like problems a lot of the time. Aaron Rogers missing out on mini camp. The Hassan Reddick contracting, that's still going. I don't know what's is the problem on that? Just he hasn't shown up to the facility to negotiate the contract

10 (1h 10m 28s):
Or they won't give him a new contract or they offered him one that they didn't like it. Or there's a bunch of things that could be at play there. He'll show up and play. There's only so many earning years in your body. Eventually he's gonna show up. I mean they know that. He knows it. He won't sit out the season. Nobody does anymore. It's too much money being left on the table. Trent Williams will eventually show if he doesn't get a new contract, they all show up and they should show up. Because again, I say it all the time, every year you sit out or every game you sit out is money you can't get back. You'll never get it back.

4 (1h 10m 57s):
Well Trent's done it before. Trent Trent's just not shown up for games before.

10 (1h 11m 1s):
Yeah. And he was a kid then. He was, what was that, eight years ago? Seven years ago Now he's an old guy so he needs to get those. He only had If. you have lesser years in your body.

4 (1h 11m 10s):
He'll show up. Yeah. So, so what about the rest of the jets though? What do you expect outta them

10 (1h 11m 14s):
If the offensive line stays healthy? And again that's a big if, if Roger stays healthy, that's probably a little bit of an if they'll be good on offense and they'll score points and they're gonna be a team to watch out for in that division. They're gonna push Buffalo. I think they're the two best teams in that division. And they're gonna push For more than that. If they get a second weapon and you know, you know Wilson's gonna be a heck of a weapon. But who else emerges? Mike Williams coming off a knee injury, never was a birder to begin with. The tight end position suspect. They need to get more weapons involved. So if they can find somebody that steps up, then I think they'll push for a play deep into the playoffs. In fact.

4 (1h 11m 51s):
Okay, so a FC is it it is crazy looking at the A FC because there's really not, I mean besides the Patriots and I don't even know, maybe the Raiders, like there's not a lot of teams that you can be like, we can pretty confidently say they're gonna be bad. Who is the Dark Horse team? 'cause it happens every year where And, it could just be the Jets because they didn't make the playoffs last year. But the team that you don't see making the, you know, didn't make the playoffs last year and now they're in the playoffs and they had a year that people didn't fully expect.

10 (1h 12m 20s):
Whew.

4 (1h 12m 22s):
Can't say the Jaguars.

10 (1h 12m 23s):
No. Well they're gonna be in the playoffs though. They'll be a wild card team.

4 (1h 12m 27s):
Okay,

10 (1h 12m 30s):
Well the Bangals,

4 (1h 12m 31s):
Yeah. You want me to throw another team out there for you? Our guy Jim Harbaugh in LA they obviously have a lot of talent deficiencies, but he's gonna co he's gonna win a couple games they shouldn't win just because of who he is and how he runs that system.

10 (1h 12m 48s):
Absolutely. And, and, but I think they're a year away. I I think they're like your Bears team. I think they're a year away. I really don't. Oh fuck me. Yeah, I

4 (1h 12m 56s):
I didn't know that. I didn't know you had that take. Yeah. What do you, what do you think about the Bears?

10 (1h 13m 1s):
Yeah, I think, I think they're gonna be a, a, a real push for Super Bowl next year, but I think they're a year away from being a, a playoff team this year that I agree

4 (1h 13m 9s):
With. So what does that mean? What's the record?

10 (1h 13m 13s):
Nine and eight. Eight and nine.

4 (1h 13m 16s):
Fuck If you told me nine and eight. Nine and eight's Not bad though. Nine and eight, nine eight's pretty good. Turning around for nine and eight. I don't know. But you also, we, we can get back to the Bears in a second. You glossed over talking about the Chargers. Did you not see the report that Herbert was stuck in an elevator and Harbaugh was extremely impressed with how he handled himself inside that elevator? Like a leader?

10 (1h 13m 38s):
Yeah, I, and I didn't quite get that by the way. I mean, what the hell does that mean you, you didn't pee in the corner like everybody else did. What's that mean?

4 (1h 13m 45s):
He wasn't his sweating. I thought he, I yeah, he didn't sweat at all. But I also thought maybe that meant he wasn't hydrated. If you're not pissing in the corner, that means that you're not hydrated enough for football.

10 (1h 13m 53s):
What If you had to go number two while you were stuck in the elevator. That would be,

4 (1h 13m 56s):
And you got pro. Well Lamar, Lamar would've had to, he would've been the worst. I I I was gonna ask you who you think the worst quarterbacks to be stuck in an elevator with. I think Lamar probably number one because of number two. And probably Russell Wilson. 'cause he do like high knees.

10 (1h 14m 11s):
Oh, he would be annoying in there. Yeah, he'd be, he'd be talk. Yes. He'd probably be number two. He might even be number one. Yeah. If Lamar, yeah, so Lamar did his business in the corner. He'd just move away from him. You know, he would couldn't get away from Russell.

4 (1h 14m 23s):
Kind of an alpha male move though to just take your pants off and take his shit.

10 (1h 14m 26s):
He'd probably go, he'd probably go in his pants and let him sit there for a while.

4 (1h 14m 31s):
Yeah. What, what, how many games do you think Russell Wilson's gonna play this year? Four. Barring injury. Four or five. How many? Four or five. Four or five. He's not And then they're gonna pull the plug.

10 (1h 14m 42s):
You gotta pull the plug. Did he, I mean, what did they see in the preseason or in their workouts that gave you any indication that he's the guy or going back to last year when he, when he held the ball forever and caused so many sacks in Denver. He's done. He's over

4 (1h 14m 57s):
I think, I think what they're just hoping for is that they get an average quarterback because with an average quarterback on that team last year, then it, you're telling an entirely different story. The offense looks a lot better. The defense is still gonna be awesome this year. They got them to the playoffs. Yeah.

10 (1h 15m 12s):
I I mean we need to loop that. Yeah. Theyre always gonna be, they're always gonna be tough and physical and everything else and wanna run the ball. They have offensive line questions. There's, you know, two rookies that are gonna be starting on that offensive line. That's questions. And then again they're where, look at the division. What, where are they in the division? They're the fourth team, right?

4 (1h 15m 30s):
Yeah. I mean I guess I, I the Browns are kind of a team that hasn't been talked about a lot just because no one knows what Deshaun Watson's gonna do. And when is Nick Chubb gonna be back and like they do. The Browns were good last year with Joe Flacco down the stretch. But I have no idea what to expect from Deshaun Watson.

10 (1h 15m 47s):
No, nobody does. He's played 12 games for the Browns in two years. I mean you can't. No. And when he's been on the field, he's been bad at times. And then he started looking good at the end before he got hurt again last year. They're, they're the unknown team. They really are. You're right about them. They have talent on defense. They got an elite defensive player that can rush the passer and wreck the game if Watson's good and the offensive line is healthy. And again, their two tackles, their three tackles were hurt last year. Now they have two of them. They're still banged up. You got problems there?

4 (1h 16m 16s):
Yeah. Okay. So back to the Bears, big cat's bears you, you don't seem like you're buying in fully. You said that they're a year away. They've got guys that can get after the passer on defense. They've got who appears to be a great quarterback in Caleb Williams. You've got all the weapons in the world for Caleb. One of the best secondaries in the league. Love

10 (1h 16m 35s):
The secondary. I love the corners. I really love the corners. They've got the best, they might have the best group of corners in the league by the

4 (1h 16m 40s):
Way. I'd agree. So why do you hate the Bears?

10 (1h 16m 43s):
I don't, I just think this is another team that's gotta learn how to, how to win and learn how to have success. You have a rookie quarterback. It's tough on a rookie quarterback. It's not like they just show up. It doesn't happen all the time. So it's gonna be a process. But the way you look at the division, I think the Packers are really good. I think the lions are really good. The Vikings not so much, but I I think If, you look, they're the Bears of the third team in the division. And, and so I think combined with everything, I don't think they're gonna make the playoffs. Now. Would I be shocked if they snuck in as a wild card? No, but I just think it's a year away from when they're really special.

0 (1h 17m 16s):
Yeah. I mean listen, if I, if I were, I, I'm obviously very, very excited about this bear season. I'm very excited about the future. 'cause it feels like Ryan Polls is putting the team together the right way. And I do think the defense has some insane talent. But I also will admit that if we played the end of the season, you know, game that I did with the Packers, they beat up on some not great quarterbacks down the stretch. And you know, when they played Kyler Murray, when they played Jordan Love, I know we beat the, the Cardinals, but Kyle Murray kind of, you know, passed all over us. So there is something to be said for that where it's like, you gotta show it again this year.

10 (1h 17m 53s):
Yeah. And I, and I love that they're doing on defense. They're building to something special. But again, it's all building and and it's not there yet. You know, got a rookie Receiver you're counting on for big things. He is still a rookie Receiver. He is gonna be good. But he is a rookie Receiver, you know, Keenan Allen, what's he have left there? There are questions there. So I think you add it all up. I think they're a year away.

0 (1h 18m 13s):
Okay. Okay. And then let's, let's do the NFC. So it feels like one of the, it feels like there's gonna be one team that we expect to be really good in the NFC that's just not, and it's like, you know, whether you want to pick the Eagles, the Cowboys. I'm trying to think who else. Some people have said the Niners. The Niners. Is there one of those teams that you can think of where you're like, everyone's expecting them to just kind of do the same thing and be a playoff team, but there's something there that is just not right. That's gonna hold them back?

10 (1h 18m 44s):
Yeah, I, I I think Dallas is gonna win the division. So if, but I also had the Eagles sneaking in So. if you had to, I'd say they both get in. The Niners division isn't very good, I don't think. I think they're, they're, those teams are coming a little bit, but they're not there yet. So I think the Niners won't be as good as they were a year ago. But I still think they're gonna get, you know, one or two seed in the NFC. They're just not as, I don't think they're as good as they were a year ago. So. Okay. So they might be the team but they'll still be in the postseason. As far as the team that made the playoffs last year, that's not gonna get in. That's hard to figure out because If, you look at it. Where do they come from? 'cause I think the Lions, the Packers will both be there again. I think the Cowboys will be there.

10 (1h 19m 27s):
The Eagles. I think the Bucks win the South. Most people are sleeping on the Bucks. Yeah. 'cause they're all in on Kirk Cousins in Atlanta. I'm not. And then I think the Niners will be in the playoffs

0 (1h 19m 37s):
And the Rams. I think the Rams are gonna be good. And the Rams. And the

10 (1h 19m 39s):
Rams. Yeah. So, so where's a team that's gonna come from nowhere to make the playoffs in the NFC.

0 (1h 19m 45s):
But you know, there will be like, we will Yeah, I know we can have you back on like, you know that there will be a team, one of those teams you listed will not make the playoffs. Okay.

10 (1h 19m 52s):
You probably, you, you would probably pick Atlanta maybe, right? To be the team that

0 (1h 19m 57s):
Yeah, I think Atlanta's gonna be very good this year. I actually, oh, I got, I got a, a spicy one for you Pete. Are the saints as bad as we think they are? Because I think they're like perfectly average and in that division, like they started playing okay. Ball down the stretch and Derek Carr kind of figured it out a little bit with the new team. Could, could it possibly be the Saints? 'cause that that division will be tight. Like no, no one's a a juggernaut there.

10 (1h 20m 23s):
Yeah, there I, no it's not the Saints. So I, I think okay, they, they, you talk about a team has major offensive line problems, but more than that Derek Carr can he, can you count on him week in and week out. And here's the other thing. Age is starting to creep in on defense. All their marque, DEMA Davis getting up in the ears. Cam Jordan up in the ears, honey badger up in the ears. And I think you start worried about that a little bit as well.

4 (1h 20m 48s):
Okay. Okay. So what about Detroit? What's Detroit, what's the, what's the vibe gonna be like in Detroit this year? Because they're one of the teams that was the, the hunter. Now they're definitely firmly in that hunted category. The way that the season ended last year. That could be like a big thing to get over emotionally. Do you think that carries over into this year or are you still like 'em

10 (1h 21m 8s):
I think they're talented. Their talent will carry them far enough. But getting back to where they were is gonna be tough to do it. It's hard to get back there. And he even said that after the game, you know, remember Dan Campbell said that, but here's some words of advice for Dan Campbell and I love the way he coached when he had to do coach that way. You don't need to coach that way anymore. Stop with the fourth down going for it all the time. You did. You did that when you needed to do that. You don't do that anymore. Your team is good. You don't need to do that anymore.

4 (1h 21m 37s):
I disagree with that. I think you should do it. I think you should do it the same that he's done in the past. It worked. That's

10 (1h 21m 41s):
It. Cost him a chance to go to the Super Bowl.

4 (1h 21m 42s):
That's it. Cost him a chance to go to the Super Bowl because they had some drops in those plays. And that happens sometimes in football. Sometimes you don't catch the ball. But pick the field ball because I think the team plays hard for him because they like the identity that he puts out there. Yeah. We're like, we got Dan Campbell, fucking Dan Campbell on her side and we can do anything. Yeah. Because we believe in this guy. You

10 (1h 22m 3s):
Okay? Early on when you didn't have as much talent that made sense where your talent is is now there on the roster. You don't need to play that way anymore. You adjust to your team year in and year out. You, you can get away from that. If they had come on, if they had kicked a field goal late in that game, they go to overtime and, and they might win the game and go to the Super Bowl.

0 (1h 22m 24s):
Yeah, I I mean you also say that the field goal is gonna be guaranteed because that field goal kicker was not great. They changed him, right? Like that was a that think they back the guy.

4 (1h 22m 34s):
He but he was

10 (1h 22m 34s):
Good in the playoffs though. He made the kick. Okay. And then, okay then litigating, we go back to Dallas in the, in the regular season. If, hey, if he had played that the right way, he might have had a home, a home playoff

4 (1h 22m 44s):
Game. I need, I need to go back and look at all three of those questionable decisions that he made. 'cause I thought that two of them were good. I thought one of them was really bad.

0 (1h 22m 51s):
I also, IPFC and I kind of agree that like you If you are, if your mo is to play on the edge and you have your guys like that, I do think that there's a, there's a inherent value of it. Like, hey, we're gonna push it all the time. And you can't change, you can't, like if he had been scared Dan Campbell in the playoffs, people would've shit on him for that.

10 (1h 23m 11s):
Not me. I I I mean I I you're different. No, because I just, you gotta play the percentages. You gotta play, you gotta play to go to the next play. And they didn't play to go to the next play. He played to win it right there.

4 (1h 23m 24s):
An analogy that Dan would understand would be that like they're, they're like Metallica where Ride the Lightning came out, their fans were like, this fucking rocks. The black album came out and you're like this, this team's really, really good. And then if they dropped load, you're like, this is soft. They've gone weak. That's what Dan Gamble, he'd be like load by Metallica If. He took his foot off the gas.

10 (1h 23m 44s):
So you guys want him to continue to play as aggressively as he is done. Yes. Even though, even though it cost him a chance possibly to go to the Super Bowl.

4 (1h 23m 52s):
I want Dan Campbell to be Dan Campbell. Yeah.

0 (1h 23m 54s):
I don't want him to change at all.

10 (1h 23m 55s):
You could be, you could be Dan Campbell, but you could be situationally smarter than Dan Campbell.

4 (1h 24m 0s):
Nah, no I don't think you can Then that's not Dan Campbell. Yes.

10 (1h 24m 4s):
Yes. It's he's learned, he's evolved. Can't you evolve,

4 (1h 24m 8s):
Dan Campbell doesn't evolve

0 (1h 24m 10s):
Pete, is there a quarterback that you see either taking a step forward this year that we don't see coming or maybe a quarterback that's gonna take a step back that people are like, Hey we, we think he's this and, and I I disagree. I do not see the same thing when I watch the film, which you do.

10 (1h 24m 29s):
Will Levis is gonna take a major step forward.

4 (1h 24m 32s):
Ooh. Okay. I like that.

10 (1h 24m 33s):
You know who will, Levi is a lot like you follow his career arc and all this stuff that people said about him coming out and the way they handled him and everything else. Josh Allen.

4 (1h 24m 43s):
Okay. Same

10 (1h 24m 44s):
Type of thing. Remember? Oh, he, he wasn't very good as a senior and why was his completion percentage bad and this and that and he's different and everything else. And Will Levi is entirely not the people that he's per person he's portrayed to be by the media when he came into the draft. He loves it. He lives it. He's like Josh Allen. He's a fanatic about it. He goes on vacation in Italy and scouts out fields to go work out while he is there. Three weeks before camp Hops over the fence starts working out, the cops come, he doesn't know how to speak Italian. They were gonna arrest him and he finally got somebody to talk himself out of it. That's how much of a maniac he is as a guy who loves the game. And you have to be that way.

10 (1h 25m 25s):
He's gonna have a monster season. And everybody who mocked that made fun of him and mocked his game going into the draft is gonna be exactly the way they were with Josh Allen. They're gonna be wrong.

0 (1h 25m 35s):
So, so your entire analysis of Will love who he, who we like he's a friend of the program. Is that you think he has moxie 'cause he was able to talk his way out of a bunch of no angry Italians trying to arrest

4 (1h 25m 47s):
Him.

10 (1h 25m 47s):
No. Well, you know, you know how us Italians are, we'll throw anybody collect. That's

0 (1h 25m 51s):
How you, you heard that story and you're like, oh my God, my paan you what a criminal. It's incredible. You know what a

4 (1h 25m 56s):
Criminal you have to be to get arrested by Italians. Yeah.

10 (1h 25m 59s):
Right. I mean, but that was nice. I mean it was funny because he didn't know any Italian and he couldn't, at some point he said he was an NFL quarterback and they went, oh, big deal. You know, they didn't care

4 (1h 26m 8s):
If, if that story happens in France, you are not loving Will Levi the same way you're loving him. No, it

10 (1h 26m 13s):
Has nothing. It it's the fact that he, he he actually scouted out workout facilities to go when you're on a vacation. It's, that's Peyton Manning as that's weird. But it's crazy. Okay, he's, by the way, he is going to be a big time player and it's, its same trajectory as Josh Allen big arm tough kid. It's, I'm telling you, just keep an eye on it. He's gonna be a star.

4 (1h 26m 34s):
I do like that story though, Pete. I would've, it would've been better if he had snuck into the Roman coliseum and gotten down there where the gladiators used to be and then practice down there. And

10 (1h 26m 43s):
Now that, now that would be a hell of a story.

4 (1h 26m 44s):
Yes. That would be a good story. So is there a quarterback that you think will take a step back this year?

10 (1h 26m 50s):
Step back Quarterback. Well, you got the elite. They're never stepping back. Those guys will never step back. So you just eliminate them. You know, there's seven of them.

4 (1h 27m 3s):
Wait, who are your top seven? Oh, you have seven elite quarterbacks.

10 (1h 27m 6s):
Well, I think Mahomes, Alan Burrow Rogers, he still counts. Lamar, who am I leaving off there?

4 (1h 27m 18s):
Stafford Brock, Purdy.

10 (1h 27m 21s):
Stop. Brock Purdy. Brock Purdy's better than people give him credit for, but he's not, he's not elite. Stafford's not there. Herbert? No Lawrence, no two and no. Maybe it's, that's maybe that's it.

4 (1h 27m 32s):
But So top six? Yeah. Back.

10 (1h 27m 35s):
No, he is not elite.

4 (1h 27m 37s):
You didn't say Jalen hurts. He's

10 (1h 27m 38s):
Not, he's not there either.

4 (1h 27m 40s):
Is there a chance it could go bad in Philly?

10 (1h 27m 43s):
I think there's a chance, but they have so much talent and look, you know, everybody wants to point to the offensive side of the ball. That shit, the defense was awful, awful. I mean, guys, guys got lazy and they, they wore down at the end of the season, And. it was just not the past. Defense was terrible and they, everybody goes, Jalen hurts and the coach Jalen hurts. And the coach, it wasn't that. It was, it was, the defense was awful. That was the problem. And they looked by the way, they looked like they were gave up in that playoff game. That's what they looked like.

4 (1h 28m 11s):
Yeah. Big time. So, big time. Pete in in the preseason. Were, we're getting into week one here, but I'm gonna ask you to put coaches on the Hot Seat Pre Hot Seat preheated on them. Okay. Yeah. Which coaches should we be looking at?

10 (1h 28m 23s):
Siri's on the Hot. Seat

4 (1h 28m 25s):
Already.

10 (1h 28m 25s):
Think, think about that though. This is how crazy it is. He was in the Super Bowl two years ago, went to the playoffs last year. If he doesn't make the playoffs this year, he's probably on the Hot Seat. I mean,

4 (1h 28m 34s):
People are calling him a, a tiken merchant.

10 (1h 28m 37s):
I mean, McCarthy's on the Hot. Seat,

4 (1h 28m 39s):
Yeah.

10 (1h 28m 39s):
I mean, if he doesn't win, if he doesn't get up deep into the playoffs or win a playoff game, he's probably out. Right? That's two

4 (1h 28m 46s):
I'd say. So I, but I thought that last year too, and I actually thought that the year before that it's almost like Jerry Jones likes keeping him around because he knows that he can just yell at Mike McCarthy all the time. I mean, we, we do pretend that Jerry Jones is like, 'cause obviously, you know his entire fallout with

0 (1h 29m 1s):
Jimmy Jimmy, Jimmy Johnson in, in the nineties. But like he did keep Jason Garrett around for way too long. That's true. He did. So he, he he is maybe too loyal.

10 (1h 29m 9s):
He is loyal. He is loyal. But I I think this is it. Mike, Mike, Mike probably knows it. You don't get to put, you don't win a playoff game. You're probably gone Abel, Brian Abel probably in, in has to show something or he's gone.

0 (1h 29m 21s):
Yeah,

10 (1h 29m 21s):
There aren't many though. That's the thing. 'cause there's been so many new coaches and so many, you know, teams turned over that there's not that many. Dennis Allen, you mentioned the Saints. He could be in trouble.

0 (1h 29m 31s):
No. Yeah. I mean, who even remembers he's coaching. Yeah.

10 (1h 29m 33s):
I mean, yeah, so yeah, I think there's not that many. Four or five could be on the Hot. Seat, but Ani could be.

0 (1h 29m 40s):
Okay. So we know you have the Packers in the, in the bills as your Super Bowl. I got one last question for you, Pete. And you're the best. We, we always love your takes. So

You're right about that. I mean there's, it's, it's just a fact. They haven't had that signature signature win against a really tough team and the way they played in that game against the Chiefs, like it was a quit thing. It felt like they quit.

10 (1h 31m 4s):
Well, and not just that Mike, Mike McDaniel's, a hell of an offensive coach might be the brightest offensive coach or one of 'em in the league, but he's very tight with his players almost like buddy buddy when you watch their practices and stuff. And it's, that, that always worries me a little bit. I mean, like, guys go in and out of the drills when the, when the commanders and, and Dolphins worked out, the commanders were in full gear and Miami's guys were in shorts and their helmets were off at the beginning of practice. I mean, it's just a different feel and maybe, I mean, that's who he is. So be true to who you are. But I wonder sometimes if that, if that flies when you get to tough toughness and tough games.

0 (1h 31m 45s):
He's too nice, too nice. He's one of those nice guys.

10 (1h 31m 48s):
Yeah, I mean at some point that shows up, doesn't it? I mean, isn't the proof in the pudding so far? He's gotta he's gotta dispel the notion that the dolphins aren't tough enough.

0 (1h 31m 60s):
Yeah, I'd agree with you. I there definitely is it, it's the buddy buddy thing. Like If you, if they don't win a playoff game this year, I, I, I think Mike McDaniel is a hell of a coach, like you said, but if they don't win a playoff game, the the the seat will start getting a little warm because it's like, hey, you can break all the records in the regular season. You can have an awesome offense, but you gotta win in, in January. That's what they, you get paid to do.

10 (1h 32m 21s):
And you gotta win against good teams. I mean, either you play good look at their, their wins last year they weren't against good teams. You have to beat good teams. One is six against playoff teams and two is no different. I mean, two hasn't been good against the playoff teams either. So those two guys linked together have to be better. And again, I go back to my toughness and I think that matters in the NFL.

4 (1h 32m 43s):
So who do you think is the toughest team? Oh, Pete. Pete Prisco's, toughest team.

10 (1h 32m 48s):
Well, the Ravens. The ravens are tough as hell always. The ravens are always tough, physical, nasty. And they replace guys with tough, physical, nasty guys. The ravens, when you think toughness, the Ravens are always right there with it. And, and not because of the style of play either. Just because of the mentality of the organization. They've always been that way. Going back to the, you know, when they had the best defense in the, in 2000, that that group was nasty and it's carried over. The

4 (1h 33m 14s):
Ravens team. They gotta get a murderer on the team. Yeah. Yeah.

10 (1h 33m 16s):
Wow. Tough yourself up. Wow.

4 (1h 33m 19s):
A legend. Sorry.

10 (1h 33m 19s):
And then, and then the Steelers are always tough too. Those two teams, I think If, you look at true toughness, those two teams are tough.

0 (1h 33m 26s):
That's, that's why I think the Chargers are gonna maybe be surprising people, because Har will make a tough team.

10 (1h 33m 31s):
They will, he'll make a tough team. I, I saw you guys fawning all over Harbaugh. You loved

0 (1h 33m 36s):
It. I mean, we love him. He's

4 (1h 33m 37s):
A great coach. We

0 (1h 33m 38s):
Love him. Sorry, you don't have

10 (1h 33m 39s):
Access. He's a, he's a great coach. He's a, yeah, he's a strange man. But he's a great coach.

4 (1h 33m 45s):
Yeah. Yeah. So, Pete, what about my commanders? Tell me something good about my commanders. 'cause I've started to believe just watching Jaden in the preseason. He's so good. He's so good. Pete and Adam. Peter said today, this is me like reading way too deeply into a quote and actually buying the bullshit that they're selling. They're not rebuilding, they're recalibrating. Oh, I love that. So they're in, I love that for you. They're in winnow mode. Yeah. Is what he said. So we're in winnow mode. We're all in in DC That's why we traded Johan Dots probably. But tell me something good about him. What, what's the ceiling that I can expect?

10 (1h 34m 17s):
Eight, nine wins. Eight.

0 (1h 34m 19s):
That's

4 (1h 34m 19s):
Pretty good. I'll take, I'll take eight. I love Jay. I heard nine. I heard nine.

10 (1h 34m 22s):
I love, I love Jayden Daniels. I think he's, he's so good. I think he's the best quarterback in the draft. Sorry. Big. Cat. I thought he was

4 (1h 34m 28s):
So good.

10 (1h 34m 29s):
He, and, and having watched him at Arizona State and then watched him play at LSU and now watching him. Now he's the most improved quarterback I've ever seen in my life. And I've covered this a long time at a SU and I'm a Sun Devil. He won very good what he became at LSU. He was outstanding. And he's only going to get better when I watched him work out, and I hadn't seen him play live, but I watched him work out against the dolphins. He made a throw to the sidelines. And that ball gets on that Receiver so fast and with, you know, it's not, it's, it makes, it throws easy. And that's what you want to see. I think the, I think the commanders have their guy for the next 15 years and he's gonna be a star.

4 (1h 35m 8s):
Don't say that Pete. Don't say that. I love that. I agree with you. I yeah. Love that for you. It sounds, it sounds so good hearing somebody else besides me. Say it. Thank you Pete. Yeah. I

10 (1h 35m 15s):
Love him. I love him. Well, I think I, like I said, I had him as the number one quarterback and K Caleb Williams was number two.

4 (1h 35m 23s):
Well, you don't like Caleb Williams 'cause he cried that one time.

10 (1h 35m 25s):
No, I, I mean, I don't like the crying. I admit that. I, I I've, I I know I will never back away from that. Crying on your mom after a football game should never happen.

4 (1h 35m 35s):
And the pink phone real men should never wear pink. No,

10 (1h 35m 38s):
I don't care about, I don't care about any of that stuff. I, who cares? I, I just think you shouldn't cry after a game. It doesn't, it you just shouldn't. I, I mean, I Don I told Kyle Long, you know, Kyle Long, I worked with him. you don't cry. I never cried after anything when I was growing. Nothing.

4 (1h 35m 51s):
Well, you're a tough Italian man. Yeah. That seems like a personal thing. Maybe you should cry more. Yeah. When's the last time you cried, Pete?

10 (1h 35m 59s):
Probably over a death or something. I cry over that

4 (1h 36m 1s):
Pussy. Yeah.

10 (1h 36m 2s):
Bitch. That's no, that's not, no crying over. Did you ever cry over anything? You lost

4 (1h 36m 6s):
Pussy, did you? No.

10 (1h 36m 8s):
If you lost a sporting event. Did you ever cry growing up, even as a peewee kid?

4 (1h 36m 13s):
I kind of cried a little. Like, not cried, but I cried a little bit of the double Don. Like a little teary-eyed, like, kind of, it was kind of like talking crying.

10 (1h 36m 22s):
No, you did, you cried over a win in the loss of the team you're rooting for.

4 (1h 36m 25s):
Yeah. I I, I cried when, when the caps won the Stanley Cup. Yeah. I'll admit it. I was so happy.

10 (1h 36m 33s):
Yeah. I I Did you ever cry, ever losing anything when you were a kid playing sports?

4 (1h 36m 38s):
No. 'cause I never lost.

10 (1h 36m 40s):
Yes,

4 (1h 36m 40s):
You did. That's true. You just have to be defeated. Pete, Pete understands that. You just have to be so good to never lose that wheel. Never

10 (1h 36m 45s):
Cry. No. You know why I never cried as long as I did my job. And I I got my point. So I got my, I didn't care if we won

4 (1h 36m 52s):
Or not. Selfish Guy sounds like a great teammate. Yeah,

10 (1h 36m 55s):
There is a, there is an I in price. Go. Believe me. I'm telling you,

4 (1h 37m 1s):
Pete, you're the best. We appreciate you as always. Hopefully we see you soon and let's have a great season. Yeah.

10 (1h 37m 8s):
We'll, and Bears, bears will be nine wins. And the, and the commanders might be close to him, so you guys will have happy.

4 (1h 37m 15s):
Oh, how many, how many wins will the Patriots have for Hank?

10 (1h 37m 19s):
Four?

4 (1h 37m 20s):
Oh, okay. He, he's expecting that. I think more, I think more play

10 (1h 37m 24s):
Drake play. Drake may now. Please get on with it.

4 (1h 37m 27s):
Yeah, get on with it. Why do you say that?

10 (1h 37m 29s):
Because if, why are you holding back? The sooner you get on you find out what you have, the better off you'll be. And everybody says, well, If, you drafted the, if he ruined his psyche, then Oh wow. What do you do? Well, you know what, If, you ruined his psyche. You drafted the wrong kid.

4 (1h 37m 43s):
That's true. Yeah, I agree with you. Alright, thanks so much, Pete.

10 (1h 37m 48s):
You got it.

4 (1h 40m 35s):
And now here's Forge Golan.

0 (1h 40m 39s):
Okay, we now welcome on a recurring guest that people might not know of because this was the Barstool Gold era. Yeah. An incredible interview. It is our friend for Gallant, who is a scientist. What, what are the official things behind what you do?

11 (1h 40m 58s):
Wildlife biologist,

0 (1h 40m 59s):
Wildlife biologist,

11 (1h 40m 60s):
Adventurer.

0 (1h 41m 0s):
Okay.

11 (1h 41m 1s):
I like that. And now I'm just singing my own praises over here. Wildlife biologist, adventurer, make TV shows, that kind of stuff. Yeah.

0 (1h 41m 6s):
So a lot of people are familiar with you, but it, it's very funny because we were talking about having you, you're in town, we're like, yeah, let's have him stop by. We loved having him on the first time and then it dawned on us that it was during the Barstool Gold era. Yeah. So this should be new to a lot of other people for sure. So thank you for coming by.

11 (1h 41m 24s):
My pleasure. Yeah. I just thought we were going drinking. So here we are. Yeah, yeah.

4 (1h 41m 27s):
We put your ass on pay-per-view last time. Oh, that's right. Behind the paywall. That's

11 (1h 41m 31s):
Right. I forgot about that. That's right. That's funny. Yeah. It's,

4 (1h 41m 34s):
It, it's gonna be fun to talk to you because I, I've been following some of your stuff recently and I, I listened to, I think it was Mo your most recent podcast where you came up with business ideas. And I, I really liked, I really liked your business idea, which was, was it the toxic masculinity, Jim? Oh

11 (1h 41m 49s):
Yeah. Mm. Yeah. That would do well in Chicago where I live in Santa Barbara, I don't think it would fly Yeah. Out here though, that could be a thing. Yes.

0 (1h 41m 56s):
Wait, why is Santa Barbara Santa Barbara soft? It's

11 (1h 41m 58s):
Soft. Yeah. I, I love it. I'm definitely gonna get some hate for saying this. I love living there. It's a great town. It's a soft town. I

0 (1h 42m 3s):
Don't think you can get, I don't think you can get hate for that because like California, once you go to California, you just become soft. But that's not like a not in a bad way, it's just life is just more

11 (1h 42m 13s):
Pleasant is what it's, yes. That's it. Yeah. The weather's nice. you don't have to be grumpy all the time. Right. But yeah, no toxic masculinity, just a gym where, you know, it's nothing but bros. And death metal and Hooters girls are, are working there. And I forget what else we said in our, there's

4 (1h 42m 26s):
Like a zen station. I think that's

11 (1h 42m 28s):
It. There's a zen station. You know, you mix your pre-workout, like there's a, there's a shaker there. They mix it for you.

4 (1h 42m 33s):
There should be a, a girl that's working out, doing very suggestive stretches. And then you of course, then you approach her and you're like, Hey, don't do that in my gym. My gym's not here for social media. My here's my gym's here to out. That's it. But you're filming that entire interaction for your social media because

11 (1h 42m 47s):
On your end you're like, listen, I'm the hero of the story.

4 (1h 42m 50s):
Exactly. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. I think that's a good idea. So,

0 (1h 42m 52s):
So, so give a quick explainer for the people who might not be familiar with you. You are, you've basically have lived your life outdoors. Yeah. And you are one with nature in a way that we have never been. So you, you grew up in Zimbabwe and California, correct? That's right. Yep. So yeah, tell us the backstory of like, what, when did you start falling in love with nature and animals and being like, this could be a real living here, where I go look for animals that have people think are extinct or for sure do all these videos.

11 (1h 43m 22s):
Yeah. So I grew up in the southern African country of Zimbabwe. My family ran safari businesses. So since I was really little, the only thing I really knew and cared about was wildlife and being outdoors. And in 2001, Zimbabwe had like really bad political turmoil. So my family came to the US as refugees and I came with them, bounced around government, housing, all kinds of things, trying to get our feet under us. And the only thing that was like a common thread throughout my life, the only thing I really cared about was being outside and being kind of feral. And, you know, my sister grew up the same way and she works in fashion. So I think it's just like the way I'm hardwired. And yeah. So went to school, became a biologist, academically graduated, thought I was gonna change the world.

11 (1h 44m 2s):
Wasn't changing the world as a biologist. And then through a whole bunch of weird series of events, I got the opportunity to go on camera and talk about wildlife. And that reached millions of people. And I was like, this is it. This is how I can actually make a difference in wildlife and conservation. And now I've been to, I don't know, 80 plus countries, been bitten by everything. Stung by everything caught everything. Had everything catch me. You know what I mean? Yeah. Just doing it all over the world. And I love it. It's, it's what I live for.

0 (1h 44m 28s):
The break you had was, you were on naked and afraid, right?

11 (1h 44m 31s):
You had to bring it up, huh? Yeah. But

0 (1h 44m 33s):
You, you dominated it.

11 (1h 44m 35s):
I did. Yeah. I did. So, yeah. So the first thing I ever did, I came home from being a biologist, flopped out on the couch, I was exhausted. Spent three works in a ha three weeks in a hazmat suit and like a hundred degree weather spraying weeds. And my girlfriend at the time was like, you gotta go on this stupid survival show. Like, I know how good you are at this stuff. And I went and did it. Went back to being a normal biologist and the show came out and I, I crushed it. Like I, I had one of the highest survival scores in the show's history. I thought it was like a vacation. I had a blast. I barely lost any weight, unfortunately. And, and then, yeah, I was like, this is my opportunity. So I started actually like writing TV shows and putting 'em together, like reality shows, unscripted adventure shows, And, it took three years from when Naked and Afraid came out till I, it, it was wasn't long before I saw you guys where I walked into my now business partner's office and was like, Hey, let's do this show.

11 (1h 45m 22s):
You own a production company, And. it was like, yeah, let's try it. And I was like, holy crap. And then it, it managed to get a pilot and get picked up and turned into a series and another series and so on.

0 (1h 45m 31s):
That's awesome. That is very cool. 'cause you, you have a lot of the reality television people go on reality television and then they're like, oh, I'm talented. And this was, you actually were talented right? Went to reality television for one episode and that luckily helped like spawn what you are now.

11 (1h 45m 49s):
Well, my whole thing is like, I've always just stayed true to what I care about, which is wildlife. Right. So even while I was in Naked, afraid in the jungle, you know, running around with, with my balls out, I was like grabbing snakes and talking to them about in the camera and the guy's like, are you gonna kill this thing and eat it or not? And I was like, oh no, I just wanted to shit tell you about it. And they're like, well, that's weird. So I've just always sort of stayed true to what I care about, which is talking about wildlife and adventure. Yeah. Because I think, I think when people connect to the outdoors, it's the best thing for 'em. Yeah.

0 (1h 46m 15s):
When

4 (1h 46m 15s):
You move to the United States from Zimbabwe, were there any animals that like we take for granted here in the United States, that are around everywhere that you became fascinated with because you're like, oh, this is new. This is interesting.

11 (1h 46m 25s):
Oh, big time. So salamanders and newts are like a new world species, meaning they don't occur in Africa. And I remember, like, we came to Oakland, California in the early two thousands. It was a rough neighborhood back then. And my mom got a call from the Oakland Police Department because I'd run off from our like little apartment building and I was waist deep in the, in the middle of the park catching newts. And they'd come and grab me and pulled me out. 'cause they're like, what are you doing here? Because it's like, you know, San Francisco, everybody's walking around in their North face jackets. Like they're not, they're not like a kid in the mud, in the middle of a park catching Ns. And I was just like, enamored with these things. I'd never seen like a water lizard before. You know? And yeah. And then underwater California's epic. Like there's, there's white sharks and seals and sea lion.

11 (1h 47m 7s):
I grew up in a landlocked country, so all the ocean stuff was incredible to me.

0 (1h 47m 10s):
Yeah. So what's, what's the scariest animal that you've ever encountered? Like, not face to face, but pretty much face to face.

11 (1h 47m 17s):
I mean, scariest animal for me is mosquitoes. Hands down. That's a boring ass answer.

0 (1h 47m 21s):
Oh shit. So we've done, we've kind of done,

4 (1h 47m 23s):
We're adventurous. You've

11 (1h 47m 24s):
Done it. I'm a

0 (1h 47m 25s):
Really

4 (1h 47m 26s):
Wildlife expert myself.

0 (1h 47m 27s):
Wait, why are mosquitoes? Just because they have all diseases.

11 (1h 47m 30s):
Exactly. They carry the worst stuff. Right. Okay. Yeah. But that's a boring answer. I mean, I've had some pretty, pretty bad stuff. Couple stingray stings charged by an elephant. I've had my canoe flip by a hippo. Like we've had some close calls.

4 (1h 47m 42s):
That sounds scary to me. The hippo. I I've always heard the most dangerous animal. Yeah.

11 (1h 47m 46s):
They're the most unpredictably aggressive. So they can be totally calm and then just kind of snap, you know?

0 (1h 47m 52s):
What is that about hippos? Well,

11 (1h 47m 53s):
What it is, is hippos are, they're not actually like a very aggressive animal. They're just a very nervous creature. And if a hippo cant submerge, meaning go all the way under water, that's when they panic and attack. So their fight or flight is almost always fight So. if you trap a hippo in any situation where it can't go underwater, it feels like it has to fight to get outta that situation. So if you're taking your canoe and the riverbanks, you know, on this side, and the canoe stuck between you or the hippos stuck between you and the deep water, he's gonna flip your canoe over. He is gonna try and kill you to get to that deep water. So any situation where they feel even slightly cornered, they're like, time to.

0 (1h 48m 27s):
So that's so hippos aren't really like, it's not, they're ferocious, they're just kind of like nervous bitches. Totally.

11 (1h 48m 33s):
A hundred percent. And people don't know this. They either think they're cute and cuddly or Yeah, they're just nervous. Bitches straight up. They're like, they're like on edge all the time.

0 (1h 48m 41s):
Hips just needed someone to be like, they needed to smoke a little weed and just be like, dude, it's okay. Just

11 (1h 48m 45s):
Gotta start shooting 'em with Xanax. And then they just mellow out. Yeah.

4 (1h 48m 48s):
They're just so big and strong and fast that when they do get nervous, they can kill anything. Yeah, a hundred percent. So there's probably animals that are like them out there that have that same nervous energy to 'em. Right. That just don't have the ability to murder anything. That's it. Right?

11 (1h 48m 60s):
That's

4 (1h 49m 0s):
It. Right. Yeah. What what about that, what about that crocodile Gustav? Are you familiar with the legend of Gustav? I am. Because I've heard, I've heard both sides on Gustav. Some people think that some of his numbers are, are, are inflated. Some people think that they're not inflated enough. So can you just explain like who Gustav is and whether or not he's the real deal?

11 (1h 49m 17s):
Yeah. Gustav was a notorious crocodile that allegedly killed what, like 12 people or something like that.

4 (1h 49m 22s):
I think it was way more than that.

11 (1h 49m 23s):
Was it more than that? And he was allegedly, I I wanna say 26 feet long, something like that. It was supposed to be the largest crocodile in history. You guys can fact check me on all of this. I think those numbers are likely inflated because

4 (1h 49m 36s):
The, the numbers that that are attributed to Gustav are 200 to 300 people.

11 (1h 49m 40s):
Okay. So a little more than 12. Yeah. But yeah. But he was a famous man eating crocodile that was said to be like 26 feet long or something like that. My take on that is definitely a true man eating crocodile crocodiles are one of only three animals in the world that actually choose to hunt and eat people. Wait,

0 (1h 49m 57s):
What are the other two?

11 (1h 49m 58s):
Polar bears and tigers.

0 (1h 49m 59s):
They, they want us as snacks. They,

11 (1h 50m 1s):
Well actually choose to eat people. Like everybody thinks of sharks, right? Oh, sharks eat people. Sharks don't want to eat people no interest. Right. Polar bears, tigers, crocodiles, chew, want to eat people. Oh yeah. Okay. And which is scary 'cause I'm gonna doing 'em polar bears for the first time in like three weeks. So you are, yeah. Just

0 (1h 50m 18s):
Bring them up. Well we, we, we like, we drink Pepsi here. We could bring 'em the other one. Yeah,

11 (1h 50m 23s):
Yeah. You go, here

4 (1h 50m 24s):
You go. Have a focused smile. There you

11 (1h 50m 26s):
Go. Yeah. They're mascot.

4 (1h 50m 27s):
Are are you afraid of polar bears? I, I've heard that you If you are in an area with polar bears around. You just need to be like always awake high alert. Yeah. Because if they smell you, they can smell you from miles away. Right. And if they want to kill you, you're already dead.

11 (1h 50m 42s):
I, I think that's relatively true. I'm, I wouldn't say I'm scared of them because I've never experienced them, but I'm wary because it's a totally different thing. And we're doing it on foot up in, up in the Arctic in Canada, which I've never done before. So I'm really looking forward to it because my whole thing is figuring out all these interactions with wildlife. but it's a little bit different from like, oh, if I touch that snake it might bite me. You know, that's a little bit different from like, oh, there's a polar bear somewhere around camp. So it'll be interesting. But I'm really excited for it.

0 (1h 51m 10s):
What's the, what's the gnarliest snake that you've been bitten by?

11 (1h 51m 16s):
Hmm. The gnarliest one is probably, and to be clear, I don't try and get tagged by any of these things, but Right.

0 (1h 51m 22s):
You've never, you've definitely tried a couple times there's been, there's a couple snakes where you're like, go ahead bite me.

11 (1h 51m 27s):
Oh, for sure. I was doing that at a pet shop yesterday.

0 (1h 51m 29s):
You're a sick fuck. Yeah. Yeah,

11 (1h 51m 30s):
Yeah, yeah. But the gnarliest one is probably, when I was a teenager I got bitten by a little, a little snake called a roic night at her. But when you're a kid, the venom from that can potentially kill you. And it, it did put me into like a small coma for a couple days. So Holy

0 (1h 51m 46s):
Shit.

11 (1h 51m 46s):
Yeah. I, I, so I was, I was playing with the snake down by the dam at our farm. I was 14 years old, 13 years old. And I got bitten playing with it and I was like, Ooh, that's not good. So I circled it on my arm and I wrote the name of the snake down on my arm. I jumped on my little peewee 50 motorbike to rush back to the house to tell my mom. And I just remember like my vision going like this And the next, apparently like some of the guys that were working on the farm saw me just like wipe out and they thought I just like hit a b, hit a bump Right. And wiped out. So my mom came, grabbed me, threw me in the truck and saw that I'd written it and circled it on my arm, rushed me to the hospital and they were able to treat it.

0 (1h 52m 19s):
Wow. So, if you hadn't written that down, you could've died

11 (1h 52m 21s):
Maybe. 'cause they would've thought it was a concussion or

0 (1h 52m 24s):
Anything you got in a bike accident.

11 (1h 52m 25s):
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That was probably the worst one.

4 (1h 52m 28s):
You think that it's because you live in Santa Barbara that you have to go out and seek all these like extreme uncomfortable sometimes behaviors like If, you lived in Youngstown, Ohio. Would you still have that thirst to go out like to the Australian outback?

11 (1h 52m 39s):
Probably more so. Right? I can't think so. I mean, maybe not if I'd grown up in Ohio, but I, I think for me, me, it's not really about like the thrill seeking, don't get me wrong. Like I won't tell you I don't enjoy it. Yeah. But it's more about like communicating to the world. How cool are these creatures? Yeah. How cool are these adventures? Like try to inspire people to like care about the planet and getting outside and specifically the wildlife. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 52m 60s):
One thing, one thing you do a lot of is I guess describing whether or not animals that are listed as extinct are actually extinct. Yeah. Like truly extinct. Because sometimes they get put on the list because they're hard to find. Totally. And they're in these remote locations and it's expensive. It's cost prohibitive to go there and spend all those resources trying to be like, oh, here's a seahorse that I found that nobody's seen in like 20 years or whatever. Exactly. I, I had a thought though. Do sometimes, would it be beneficial if there's an animal that is let's say almost extinct? Yeah. Let's say maybe there's like 50 or a hundred left in the wild. Would it be beneficial to have whatever the governing body is say Yeah. The animal's extinct because that way people won't go and try to hunt it anymore.

11 (1h 53m 39s):
I've thought about that as well. Like from an ethicality standpoint, the problem is If, you do that, it's like turning a blind eye. So there's no protections that can be put in place. So, if you do that in an insanely remote place where nobody's actually looking for the animal or hunting it. Sure. That could be beneficial to let sleeping dogs lie. But without exposure, there's no protections. Right. Right. Whereas like for instance, like with the, the leopard that we found, or the tortoise that we found, if we hadn't gone and found those, nothing would've been done to attempt to preserve it. Yeah. Likely somebody would've come along and just shot it or collected it and you never would've heard about it. Right. Yeah. Because it would've just ended up in soup or a skin or, or who knows what. So I think as long as it's handled the right way, the exposure for something that's been lost to science is really important because then all of a sudden the government can come in and go, let's figure out how to protect this.

11 (1h 54m 25s):
Does it mean building a national park? Does it mean, you know, collecting 'em, breeding 'em in, in a facility? Like whatever it happens to be to try and help And hang on,

0 (1h 54m 32s):
What, what's your white whale animal that you think might not be extinct that you wanna find?

11 (1h 54m 37s):
There's a couple. I think right now the one that's at the top of my list, this is as recent as like three days ago, is I got a piece of information on, it's gonna sound like a snooze, but the pink had a duck, which is a little duck that lives in Asia with a bright pink head that hasn't been seen in like 50 years. And I got You got a tip? I got a tip. Yeah. Got a tip baby. Okay. A duck tip.

4 (1h 54m 57s):
This is a pretty cool looking duck.

11 (1h 54m 59s):
It's cool, right? It's pretty, yeah.

0 (1h 54m 60s):
That's so funny that you got a tip. Someone be like, yeah, I saw him down by the seven 11. My,

4 (1h 55m 4s):
My duck guy in Mon Mongolia hit

11 (1h 55m 6s):
Me. Yeah. Yeah. You guys guys don't have a duck guy. But yeah. So I got, I got a tip for this area in Myanmar. That's a big swamp that this guy thinks he's seen several of them in the last few years. And so, you know, we vet a lot of these things. It could all be smoke and mirrors, but it also could be legit.

0 (1h 55m 21s):
Yeah. So what else, what other ones?

11 (1h 55m 23s):
That one's very high on my list. The, the one that sits on the top reign supreme is an animal called a thine. Do you know what that is? Yeah, that's

0 (1h 55m 29s):
The, the, no, not a werewolf.

11 (1h 55m 32s):
It's like a werewolf. It's

0 (1h 55m 33s):
A W. Yeah,

11 (1h 55m 34s):
Yeah, yeah. Tasmanian tiger. Okay. Is the other name for it. Yeah. So, you know, I've gone to to Tasmania and tracked it there and not found anything. I've gone to Australia twice and looked for it there and not found anything. And because it used to range like 4,000 years ago, all the way from New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania, there are still ongoing reports from like tribes and villages of striped dogs and all these things in Papua New Guinea. So that's the area that I think needs the biggest exposure. And we have this whole plan put together 300 trail cameras, the whole thing to like go out and do a big survey to find this thing in western Papua. So that's like the white whale, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the top of the charts. But it's funny because that animal has now developed a somewhat like Bigfoot demeanor.

11 (1h 56m 16s):
It's from Australia, right. Australians are crazy. So they're all like, they see it like their Bigfoot. So it's a bummer because it's not a made up crypted thing, it's a legit animal. Right. It just, it nobody's seen one since, since the, I don't know, 50 years or whatever it is.

4 (1h 56m 30s):
That's crazy. There's one in in the National zoo

11 (1h 56m 32s):
In Hobart. Yeah. Yeah. Hobart, Tasmania. They had one named Benjamin. Yeah. So this is

4 (1h 56m 36s):
Like a legitimate animal. Oh yeah. And people, when was the last sighting of it?

11 (1h 56m 41s):
I mean, record confirmed sighting. Yeah. Was like 12 years. It was like seven or eight years after Benjamin died, whatever that year that is. Okay. The one in the zoo. But unconfirmed probably yesterday, right? Yeah. You have all these like Australian rednecks out there in the middle of the country going, I saw one at eight, my sheep. Man, they don't sound like that, but you know. Right, right. Yeah. So there's reports coming in all the time.

0 (1h 57m 1s):
That's fascinating man.

4 (1h 57m 2s):
So how, how do you do that? If you If you wanted to go to Papa New Guinea and find the thine. What's your strategy? How do you, how do you go about finding an animal that nobody's seen? Well,

11 (1h 57m 11s):
It depends on the, each of these things is unique, right? Looking for a snail versus looking for a Tasmanian tiger. Two very different surveys and, and structures and everything else. For this, we need a big group of people. It's like a three week trek into the area that we want to go. Then we'd establish a base camp. We'd spread out from there and do baited cameras, drone surveys, sound traps, all kinds of different technology for up to like three months. And then collect all the data and go through it. And some of that's actual trapping. Some of that's sitting in blind. Some of it's just, you know, remote cameras, trail cameras, things like that. So it's a big to-do to put it all together. But we have some real hot tips from that region. H

0 (1h 57m 51s):
Have you ever that, I mean that sounds in incredible what goes beyond what goes on behind, like trying to find an animal like that? Have you ever had luck where you've just shown up and seen it? Like day one?

11 (1h 58m 3s):
Oh yeah. So the biggest find we've ever had is this Fernandina Island tortoise. Okay. Which is, it's literal, the rarest animal in the world. There's only one known living individual and it's the one that we found. And before that they'd only ever seen one before 114 years ago. Right. And we, it's funny 'cause somewhat controversial, but I remember talking to the government in the Galapagos and being like, Hey, we're gonna go look for that. And the guy literally like laughed at me like, you're what a clown, basically. Right, right. It it's like sure. Permit approved, go like knock yourself out. Right. Like quit wasting my time. And we went there and we found it on day three. What? Yeah. And we like had like a whole like massive survey, we're gonna cover the island, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We were just

0 (1h 58m 42s):
Hiking like, was it swimming or on the

11 (1h 58m 43s):
Land? No, it was on land. but it was on land. Yeah. Just we like came over this little like lava rock ridge into the green area and we're like, there's tortoise poop. Five minutes later we're like, there's the tortoise. Holy shit. It was like, you know, I'm getting goosebumps thinking about, but I literally like dove on it. Like it was a Cheeto, it was a tortoise. And I just picked, picked it up. It was like, holy shit. Holy shit. You know? That's crazy. Like the rarest animal in the world. Crazy.

0 (1h 59m 2s):
And how old was that tortoise?

11 (1h 59m 4s):
Probably around 70, 80 years old.

4 (1h 59m 6s):
Wow. Yeah. We have a box turtle here. His name's Mr. Pear. Yeah. Love that. Mr. Perry. He's the only of his kind. Okay. Because he is the only gambling turtle.

11 (1h 59m 12s):
We're gonna go wrestle him after the show. Okay. Yeah.

4 (1h 59m 15s):
I, I was in the Galapagos, this was like 12 years ago. Nice. And I did this big tour and we had a, a local guy that was showing us around every day. And so on day four we were there. He was like, this is gonna be my favorite day of the tour. You're gonna meet Lonesome George. Yes. The last of his kind. Right. Yeah. What was he a Pinta Island tortoise or something like that? Exactly right. Yep. He's like the last of his kind. Some people said he was 80, some people said he was like 170 years old. And everything in the Galapagos, there's just flags and merch that you can buy everywhere with Yep. Lonesome George's face on it. Yep. Or his body. And so I'm all, I'm psyched and we're getting down from the beach. He's driving us back in this little jeep and then he pulls over to the side of the road 'cause he's getting a call and he starts to cry and

11 (1h 59m 53s):
He's like, oh

4 (1h 59m 54s):
No, lonesome George just died. He died probably eight hours before. I was gonna say no

11 (1h 59m 58s):
Way.

4 (1h 59m 58s):
I was so bummed out. But I now I'm thinking like maybe there's another Lonesome George out there.

11 (2h 0m 2s):
Well there is, it's our tortoise fern. Right. And she's the one, like it's a different species of Fernandina versus the Pinta. Yeah. But so the tortoise we found lives in lonesome Joel George's old enclosure. Oh cool. She lives right there at the fa Lorena breeding center now. So

0 (2h 0m 16s):
Now do you have to find a male to

11 (2h 0m 17s):
That's the goal. Yeah. Not so I handed that over to the GPOs government, like, I'm like the hide and seek king. Right. They just bring me in to find it and then I roll out and they've unfortunately conducted three or four more trips trying to find another one and not succeeded. So they're, they're continuing to try. I wish them the best, but so far no luck.

4 (2h 0m 34s):
There's gotta be girl out there. Gotta be gotta, it can't be a sausage fest. So once, once they get this, if they were to find a female tortoise Yeah. And introduce it to that habitat, then you run into the second problem. Right. 'cause tortoises, they don't really like to fuck that much. So

11 (2h 0m 47s):
The one we found is actually a female. So they, they're looking for a male. Okay. If they found

0 (2h 0m 53s):
He's gotta be horny, he hasn't Yeah, you'd think but by himself in the woods

11 (2h 0m 56s):
For probably a hundred years. Yeah. You probably wanna get his rocks off. So Yeah, no, I mean if they found him and put 'em together, I think it would probably happen. And, and the re the truth is that you, because they're all pretty closely related, you could probably take any male tortoise of any of the other species and put it in there. Yeah. And it would probably happen. But that'll obviously muddy the gene pool. Right, right. It's its own species. So I hope they find a male. I really do. We saw evidence of another one, like two or three miles from the one we found. So I think there are maybe some more individuals on that island.

4 (2h 1m 24s):
What's that feeling like when you see something that people thought was going off the face of the earth? What's the rush?

11 (2h 1m 29s):
The first time it happened, I actually didn't believe it was happening. And I was sitting on a bus in Zanzibar looking, reviewing thousands of trail camera footage. Right. Trail camera, like a game camera you put out in the woods. And I was like, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip. And you, you don't film me reviewing every clip. 'cause the odds of finding something are nearly nothing. Right. All of a sudden I clicked and I saw this, this leopard just walk across the camera frame and I like looked around. I was like, this can be real. And I clicked it again, clicked it again, clicked it again, and then I threw my laptop off, ran over headbutted my sound guy. Swear to God, like, I literally like blacked out. Like I just lost control. I was like, pull the bus over, pull the fucking bus over. Somebody thought I was like dying. You know what I mean?

11 (2h 2m 9s):
I just like freaked out. I might've pissed myself. I'm not even sure. But no, I didn't. but it was, you know, I just like lost control. Like, I couldn't actually believe it had happened. And then, you know, since then we've found a lot of really rare stuff. So I'm starting to get slightly more used to it, but the rush never goes away. Yeah, yeah. I'd imagine. Yeah. It's, it's the rarest thing in the world. Like for me, you know, to find that to me is there's no greater accomplishments. Yeah. What

4 (2h 2m 32s):
About here in, in North America, in the United States, are there any animals that have been labeled extinct that you think maybe still exist?

11 (2h 2m 39s):
Yeah, there's one that, did you guys have colossal the De-Extinction Company on one of the bar stool shows? I think you did Ben Lamb, maybe

4 (2h 2m 47s):
He might've been on one of the shows.

11 (2h 2m 48s):
Yeah. Not yours, but one of the shows. I think he was on a, a bar stool thing. But I'm working with him at Colossal Biosciences and we're putting together a survey to potentially go look for the Florida Rainbow Snake, which is a snake that's only been seen like two or three times lives like under the mud, under the water. So really hard to find. Right. And I don't think one's been seen confirmed since the seventies and South Florida Rainbow Snake. Yeah. So I think it's, I definitely think it still exists. I think it's still around. It's just a really elusive creature. That's

6 (2h 3m 16s):
So cool.

0 (2h 4m 58s):
And then what were you doing? You were, you were in Illinois, you, you said you were swimming with the Asian carp, which are, how does that happen, by the way? Can you explain the Asian carp? 'cause Yeah, people have probably seen the videos where they're jumping outta the rivers in the Midwest and they're, they're very dangerous for like their invasive species people. I, I've seen videos where guys are shooting 'em with shotguns and everyone's like, why would you kill these fish? Like no, they actually should kill,

11 (2h 5m 21s):
Kill. Yeah. Kill as many as you can. So

0 (2h 5m 22s):
Explain how they got here, how it works, and then will they ever be gone?

11 (2h 5m 26s):
For sure. Yeah. So in Peoria, Illinois, on the Illinois River, a couple spa places, but Peoria is like the, the HQ of it. There are these invasive Asian flying carp. Okay. And what happens is these carp were introduced I think for food some 50 or 60 years ago. And because they have no natural predators here, like they do, where they're from, their population has exploded to the point that they now now make up something like 75% of the biomass in that river. So 75% of living organisms in that river are these carp. And I, I could show you guys some videos, but because their defense mechanism when their startle is to jump, which is a very unique thing among fish, you can drive a boat through these schools of fish and all of a sudden what looks like this beautiful placid piece of river erupts with 10,000 fish flying into like 15 feet into the air.

11 (2h 6m 16s):
So we just started a YouTube channel about a year ago, which is just a fun thing. Like something we were gonna try out because you know, I've been on TV a long time, but TV's kind of on its way out, like cable tv. So we're like, let's start a YouTube channel and we decided to go to Peoria to look at the invasive flying carp for our YouTube channel and we're filming and we did some hilarious stuff. I was getting towed around in an inner tube with 10,000 fish jumping at like 40 miles an hour. I'm covered in bruises. I don't even know If, you could see 'em fish

0 (2h 6m 43s):
Smacking into so

11 (2h 6m 44s):
Hard. Dude I thought I was gonna get knocked out. I took one to the dick. It was terrible. Like I couldn't breathe for like 20 minutes. It was like jackass level ridiculousness. but it was super fun. And so yeah, so we were there trying to promote that people should go out and harvest these things and try and bring their numbers down.

0 (2h 6m 59s):
Yeah. So do, will they ever be able to get these numbers down? Like Do I assume they shock the river every now and then. They do.

11 (2h 7m 4s):
They do. Yeah. So they put out these big plates shock, the river zap these whole schools of fish and there have been like a government level effort at eradicating them for I think five or six years now. And according to like our guy who was driving the boat who was with us from this Peoria car hunters, he said it's gone down substantially like it used to be. The whole river was exploding. Yeah. So it sounds like they're, they're knocking it down. The problem is these things can spawn an individual carp can spawn a million eggs multiple times a year. Holy shit. So the likelihood of getting rid of them, I would say zero. You'll never get rid of them.

0 (2h 7m 37s):
And how did they get there? They just, someone brought one over, like how does that work

11 (2h 7m 41s):
With a million eggs being spawned, all you need is one pregnant one to get in the river and that's it. Right. And it, it's an exponential growth. So it's like, okay, there's a million eggs, maybe only a hundred thousand survive or maybe 10,000 survive. But then that 10,000 reproduces a million each, another 10,000 each. You know what I mean? So it's exponential growth and they're still not at capacity. Like if the commercial efforts to remove them stopped, probably go from 75% of the biomass to 99% of the bios.

4 (2h 8m 4s):
Wow. That's crazy. Are they, can you at least eat 'em?

11 (2h 8m 8s):
You can. They're okay. I'll be honest. You know,

4 (2h 8m 10s):
I wish they were tasty. That would solve the

11 (2h 8m 12s):
Problem if they were salmon. Yeah. It'd be no issue. Right.

0 (2h 8m 14s):
Are that's fun to

11 (2h 8m 15s):
Catch. Oh, they're so much fun to catch. Okay. Because you should, you're shooting them out of the air with bows and you're on this inner tube with a net and got,

0 (2h 8m 21s):
Can you catch 'em with a rod? Like are they, do they, will they bite like eater? No. Oh they

11 (2h 8m 24s):
Won't? No, because they're filter feeders. So they're actually eating plankton in the water they're going through and like slurping up everything. Kinda like a whale shark. Yeah, like the big gillers and stuff. I mean you could probably snag 'em with a hook or something. Yeah. But they're not actually trying to eat. So you have to come up with these outrageous other methods to catch 'em. And I'll tell you, it is wild. Like it's really fun.

4 (2h 8m 44s):
What about just going on on like, I don't know, water skis with a baseball bat

11 (2h 8m 47s):
Done. No

4 (2h 8m 48s):
Problem. Just swing away as they jump in the air. You

11 (2h 8m 49s):
Can absolutely do that.

4 (2h 8m 50s):
That would be a good fancy football punishment. Actually. Just having somebody in an inner tube just get dragged around the river for like three hours. Just walloped

11 (2h 8m 57s):
With car If. you set that up. I will take your guy who loses it fantasy and get his butt kicked by car for you by car. No problem.

4 (2h 9m 3s):
Tarnish flying into his face. Yeah. What about the, the Mexican grizzly bear? Yeah, that's an interesting 'cause it's like a silver bear, right? It's not, it's not white, it's not brown. It's got like a silver.

11 (2h 9m 13s):
Exactly right. Yeah. They called it, oh, I'm gonna butcher it. But it's like oso, Plato, like platinum bear And. it meant the silver bear. And so grizzlies used to roam, you know, now we think of grizzlies, we think of Alaska, whatever. Right? Way up north. They used to roam all through north, north America down into Mexico. And Mexico had its own subspecies, which was the Mexican grizzly, the silver, silver grizzly bear in the seventies. I wanna say the la last. There was one in a zoo somewhere. And there it died And. it was like, oh, that's the end of the species. Then 14 years later, a Mexican hunter shot one and brought it into town. So the species hung on 14 years after we thought it would've gone extinct And. it was a big beautiful silvery bear.

11 (2h 9m 55s):
And the region that it lives in is still a pretty remote like mountainous region and there are still farmers going, oh, something came down last night and took by livestock. It's definitely not a puma, you know, so there's, there's like a faint shred of hope that it's still out

4 (2h 10m 8s):
There. And that's in, is that in like cartel country? Oh yeah. So that makes it a little bit more dangerous to go hunting for the, it'd be tough to explain to, to the Zetas. Like, no, I'm just looking for a bear. I

11 (2h 10m 17s):
Think you could still do it. You know what I mean? Like that's a thing. So I go down to Baja a lot and I run into cartel guys quite regularly and they're the nicest guys, you know? I'm not saying they're nice outside of when you're having a interaction, but as long as you don't go and get in their way, you know what I mean? Yeah. They're not getting in your way kind of thing of thing. Like, don't cross any lines, don't be an idiot. Just be polite and respectful. I think you could probably pull it off, but it, it is very like deep in the heart of where all the turmoil is.

4 (2h 10m 43s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 10m 44s):
These, I mean I, I love all these stories about all these different animals. What's what? Gimme another one That's a scary animal that you've been like close to the polar bears. I can't wait to hear how that goes.

11 (2h 10m 55s):
That'll be fun.

0 (2h 10m 56s):
But what's another like, whether it be a gorilla snake. I mean I, we're pussies, we're city guys. I, I talk a lot of shit on animals being like, I could take down a bear knowing I'll never face one.

4 (2h 11m 8s):
I mean, let's give ourselves some credit. There was, there was an instance when we were out in southern California, we were playing Frisbee. True, true. And a coyote walked right past us. I was ready to take it. Yeah. And we just yelled at the coyote. We were like, come back here, get some bitch. Nice. And the coyote stopped and looked at me and then I was like, no, you can keep walking and walked. He,

11 (2h 11m 24s):
You thought, he looked at you like, I'm not messing with them. He looked at you like, Ugh. And just kept going. Yeah. Not

4 (2h 11m 30s):
That. But

0 (2h 11m 30s):
Then Coyote, you think I could take a coyote?

11 (2h 11m 32s):
I do think you could take a coyote. They're pretty scrawny. You're a big guy. I think you

0 (2h 11m 36s):
Could, I fucked Coyote

4 (2h 11m 37s):
Up. Yeah. The best Is it, it walks away from us and then we're like, yeah, walk away bitch. That's smart. Like making us feel like we we scared it off. Yeah. You we had a pug with us, so we didn't want the pug to get attacked.

11 (2h 11m 46s):
He would've eaten the pug for sure. Yeah, sure. For sure. Another scary critter, right? That's

0 (2h 11m 51s):
Yeah. Animal that you've, you've gone, you've gotten really close to or seen that's like majestic.

11 (2h 11m 57s):
One of the hardest things we've ever done. Which to me is still one of my greatest accomplishments is two or three years ago we performed the largest, largest elephant translocation in history. So we put together, it's a crazy story. I like sold this whole TV show and I took all the resources from the show and put it into this one conservation thing. So then the rest of the season was kind of fucked. but it was awesome because it was so worth it. 'cause I got a call from a buddy of mine, from Zimbabwe, from when my childhood, who goes forest. It's so tragic. There's this herd of 24 elephants that they're gonna shoot right outside the city of Maputo because they're running through villages and they're killing people and they're squashing crops and everybody's angry with them and there's nothing we can do. And I was like, what do we need to do? He's like, we need like a big chunk of money and we can catch them and move them to this national park.

11 (2h 12m 39s):
It's 300 miles away. I was like, gimme a week. And I like called in every favor, every resources. Got all this money went there, flew into Mozambique, and I won't bore you with all the specifics, but literally like three helicopters, four semi-truck, two crane trucks, a crew of 60 people like this huge operation and successfully tranquilized captured, loaded onto flatbeds, loaded into containment trucks and transported 24 elephants without losing a single. Wow. Yeah. And there was some crazy stuff there. 'cause you know, you're in a helicopter, you're darting an elephant. Then you have three minutes from when you hit it till the tranquilizer takes effect, And, it falls to the ground. So you have to get three minutes, you have to try and herd it with your helicopter. Then the second it hits the ground, you jump out, you run over elephants, suffocate, if they don't breathe through their trunks, so if they land on their trunk, they're dying.

11 (2h 13m 26s):
So you have three minutes to rip its trunk out from it to let it breathe, to keep it stable. Then you cut a road in like literally hand cut a road in, in comes a semi-truck with a crane that lifts it up, puts it on a flatbed, then moves it into a conveyor belt truck that moves it into a transport truck. Holy shit. It was insane man. And we're like, there's a clip of me in one of these shows where we hit one of the babies, but the dart doesn't go in all the way and it's trying to stay around its mom. So it's, it's like freaking out and I have to run over and like tackle this thing to the ground to try and like put it down and then give it more tranquilizer. And there's elephants all around. There's helicopters overhead. It was insane. But at the end of the day, the, the part of it that was so magical to me was it was all like this blur of adrenaline and craziness.

11 (2h 14m 6s):
And like my one cameraman nearly died when an elephant kicked over a door And. it nearly crushed him. Like it was insane. But then we got there like 40 hour drive and we get there and we open the doors and outgo these elephants in this protected national park. And literally the last one like runs out, looks back and trumpets like a thank you. Yeah. And then runs off into the bush and we're like, they're gonna live like they're safe. That's awesome. And. it was just such a rewarding thing to do. That's

4 (2h 14m 30s):
So cool. That sounds, sounds like a great feeling. Yeah,

11 (2h 14m 31s):
It really was. Yeah.

4 (2h 14m 32s):
How long do you think you could make it just doing a nine to five job? Like If, you were an accountant. If, you woke up tomorrow and you're like, okay, you gotta commute 45 minutes each way. You're gonna work in this cube and go home maybe

11 (2h 14m 42s):
Three days.

4 (2h 14m 42s):
Yeah. Yeah.

11 (2h 14m 43s):
I think I'd be on really good behavior for the first day. Like pretty cranky the second day and undeniably get fired on the third day.

4 (2h 14m 49s):
Did you ever think about like when you graduate from college, I don't know how, how your career went right after graduation, but for a lot of people there's like a little in-between time. Yeah. Where you don't know if, if your desired career, the one that you really want to do is gonna work out and you're like, oh, maybe I'll just take a job 'cause I need money, I gotta have a place to live. I gotta afford food. Like was there a moment where you thought like, okay, maybe I will just try to do something corporate for a little

11 (2h 15m 12s):
Bit. For sure. Yeah. I got outta college and I was, I was working as a biology field tech making like 12 bucks an hour and I like moved up the ladder in that because I was good at it. Like, I'd go out way harder, way longer than everybody else. 'cause I loved being outside. But what's so shitty about the sciences in that field, the better you get, the less time you spend in the field. Now it's like, oh man, you're really good at this. Move into the office, start writing ground proposals, manage a team. Right? And so I started moving up. Yeah. And I, I literally, I remember the day I walked into my boss Morgan's office and I was like, I want to go back to being a tech. He's like, that's, you'll make half your salary. I was like, I don't care. I'd just rather be outside in field doing stuff than doing this. And he is like, okay, I guess like, it's terrible for everybody but If you want.

11 (2h 15m 54s):
And he like, didn't understand it. I'm like, I don't want to be sitting in an office writing grant proposals. Like, I want to be out in the field. So yeah, I mean, I, I, I was on that ladder, you know, and then the TV thing happened, And, it was a full pivot. Yeah.

4 (2h 16m 6s):
It's like the, the farther up you get, the more disconnected you get from the actual work,

11 (2h 16m 10s):
Which shouldn't, isn't that fucked up? Yeah. Because that's the opposite of how it should be. If you're an expert in adventure or wildlife or sciences or whatever, you should have to be working with the thing all the time to say that you're an expert on it. And what's crazy is, especially in the sciences, in the bio, in the biological sciences, the further up the chain you get, the less time you get to actually interact and be observational with the creature.

0 (2h 16m 30s):
Yeah. I mean, it happens in sports all the time with coaches where it's like, oh, this guy's a great, you know, defensive line coach and he's so good. He's now a defensive court. Now he's head coach. Right. He can't coach this position the way he used to.

11 (2h 16m 41s):
A hundred. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big rugby guy. Like Razzy Erasmus the head coach of the spring box. He sits in a box watching them all coach, and that, that's like mandated by world rugby. And it's like he's the best coach that's ever existed. He should be on the pitch. Yeah, exactly.

4 (2h 16m 54s):
Yeah. That what Big Cat described is why we don't have Jim Toula anymore. Yeah. Just got elevated to the point of incompetence. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And then Now it hands tight. And it looked down on, yeah.

11 (2h 17m 2s):
Messed up man. It doesn't make any sense how long,

0 (2h 17m 5s):
I know you did the Naked and afraid, but how long could you survive if we just dropped you anywhere? Was it forever? I mean, what

11 (2h 17m 11s):
Would you No, no. I I, survival for me is like, it's a means to an end, you know? And what I mean by that is I'm by no means the greatest survivalist or anything like that that's ever done it. Probably 99% of the people that have done shows like Naked Afraid Survivor are better at it than I am. Yeah. I just have a different mentality. I'm, I like it, I think it's fun. I, I'm not the guy that breaks down and cries about how hungry he is. I'm like, eh, I don't know. I'll just go find some food. So like, I have a different mentality, but I don't have the technical skills that most of these survivalists Got it. Like, I can rub sticks together and make a fire because I've done it a handful of times out of necessity. I don't, I'm not a weekend warrior spends every Saturday training and prepping and, you know, figuring out little fish hooks and stuff like that.

11 (2h 17m 52s):
Like I, it, I'm more focused on the wildlife sciences. Yeah.

4 (2h 17m 55s):
Yeah. So with the, the polar bear thing, what, what's your goal for the polar bear expedition? What are you trying to do? Yeah,

11 (2h 18m 1s):
So we're filming it for the YouTube that I mentioned. And the goal is to show people that they aren't mindless killing machines, you know? Okay. Like, they are really cool animals. So we're doing it on foot, like as a walking safari, walking up on polar bears and, you know, I don't, I don't wanna say anything before it's happened, but the goal is to be not interactive 'cause we don't wanna disturb them, but close enough in proximity to show, like, look at this, these giant white bears, they know we're here. They're choosing not to kill us or eat us. And we're just sitting here observing them. So that's

0 (2h 18m 27s):
The goal. But wait, is there, is there a chance you could be wrong?

11 (2h 18m 31s):
Well, yeah, there's

0 (2h 18m 32s):
Always a chance. What If? you just walk by and they just, all of them charge you.

11 (2h 18m 35s):
That would not be good. Yeah, that would not be good. I, I, you know, I'm working with the, so we're doing this in Manitoba, Canada. I'm working with their travel board. I have a feeling there'll be a guy there with bear spray and a rifle and, you know, all that kind of stuff. But, you know, we're gonna, they've done it before, to be clear, the man Manitoba travel and we are gonna test the boundaries of distance and everything else. So, you know, there'll be a little give and take. Yeah. Yeah.

0 (2h 18m 57s):
I mean, that's kind of scary to be like, If, you were wrong, not killing machines. And they're like, no, we are.

11 (2h 19m 2s):
Oh, wait a minute. Well, I'll tell you this. If I said that about crocodiles, and I'll get some hate from some of my close friends alligators, American crocodiles. Sure. But If, you say they're not mindless killing machines about crocodiles like Nile Crocs or saltwater Crocs. They absolutely, they're mind killing machines. Like they're intentionally trying to figure out how to kill you.

0 (2h 19m 18s):
Yeah, you did. Didn't you like swim? Did you do something where you put like crocodile, you wore basically crocodile armor? Yeah.

11 (2h 19m 24s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 19m 25s):
Can you explain that?

11 (2h 19m 25s):
Yeah, sure thing. So we went down to this place in Central America with American crocodiles, crystal clear water. And I designed the suit that had electro receptive blocking technology. It's called a hex suit. It's kinda like what's in the door of your microwave? You know, you could stare on microwave without frying your brain. And so it had that technology in it. But then to go one step further, we made it all crocodile print and theme and colors and stuff with the idea of it being like biomimicry. Like, look like a crock, act like a crock. And maybe the crocs won't eat you. And then we hopped in the water and dove with these crocodiles, And. it was, it worked like we

0 (2h 19m 58s):
Were, and they didn't, they didn't bother you.

11 (2h 19m 59s):
So look, I'll be honest, I don't think you see this in the little film we made, but I had a broomstick with me for the first like day and a half. And every time they get too close, I'd put the broomstick between me and the Crocs and be like, look like you just kind of approached me. And then after doing that and conditioning them a little bit, they were like, okay, this thing that I think I'm gonna go investigate is like a wooden stick. Like I'm gonna leave it alone. So then I was able to leave the stick alone and actually like swim and interact with them. That's,

0 (2h 20m 23s):
That's crazy. So scary.

11 (2h 20m 25s):
You're

4 (2h 20m 25s):
Also, you're also kind of insane. No disrespect that,

0 (2h 20m 27s):
I don't think that kind of, but think it's very, I'll take that.

4 (2h 20m 30s):
But to like put on a crocodile suit, maybe they'll think I'm a crocodile and then just swim around freely. Maybe may, I don't know, like Big Cat said we're kind of pussies. But when you're talking about animals that like might get a bad rap, like bad pr. Yeah. You're thinking maybe polar bears have been branded a little bit unfairly. Sure. As mindless killing machines. I mean they, they do kill and they have killed. Yep. But they don't kill for fun. Right. They don't kill for sport. Maybe. What are some other animals out there that you think have a bad PR team?

11 (2h 20m 55s):
I think none go more so than sharks. Yeah. Right. Like sharks have the worst pr, especially like Florida. It's like another shark attack. Like don't come to the beaches. Right.

4 (2h 21m 3s):
The news loves it.

11 (2h 21m 4s):
The news loves it. And I know, 'cause I speak on the news about this pretty, pretty often, I'm always trying to say the same thing, which is like, sharks just being a shark. Anytime you enter into the ocean, you are signing a mental waiver of like, Hey, I'm going into something else's domain. Yeah. It's the only time, especially in like North America where we're not at the top of the food chain. If, you are swimming in the ocean off the coast of North America. You are no longer the apex. Right. There are things above you in the food chain that can, that can eat you. And you just have to be okay with that. And sharks aren't trying to eat you that most of the time they're coming around doing, what's it called? An investigatory bite where they're just going, is this food bite? 'cause that's how they taste something. You go, oh yuck. I don't like human. It's gross.

11 (2h 21m 45s):
You know? And that's it. But that bite is enough to kill people. So that's, that's the problem.

0 (2h 21m 50s):
And is there a thing, because it does feel like we'll just hear about, oh yeah, this is a bad summer for sharks, right? Is that real? Or is it just,

11 (2h 21m 58s):
When's the last summer? There wasn't a bad summer for sure. True. You

4 (2h 22m 0s):
Know what I mean? It's always the summer of the shark. It's

0 (2h 22m 2s):
Always the summer there. There was that one, I actually went on vacation right by, I think it was on, on the panhandle in Florida. There was that little like

11 (2h 22m 10s):
Vero Beach. Yeah.

0 (2h 22m 10s):
Rose Mary Beach and all that stuff. There was that stretch where it was like a two week stretch where That's right. Three or four people were bitten And. it was like, what's going on down here?

11 (2h 22m 19s):
So there's an ins interesting thing happening that most people probably don't realize. One is, you might've heard about this this year. Year. Like the water in Florida was like 91 degrees in like May. Right? Right. The water was like too hot. So when that happens, it speeds up the shark's metabolism. So when they get warmer, they need to eat more. Now at the same time when the sea gets too warm, all the bait fish disappear. They go really deep. So now you've got a bunch of hungrier sharks. 'cause their metabolisms are sped up looking for food more, more than they regularly would more hungry than they regularly are in the dead of summer when everybody's going to the beach. So it's just this like confluence of situations where it's like, I'm hungry, I'm looking for food. And then you have guys like splashing in the water, playing football, you know, or a chick with like some jewelry on or something like shiny things.

11 (2h 23m 4s):
And the sharks are just like, oh, that could be bait. Boom. And they go and bite it and that's the problem. It's like this. So

0 (2h 23m 9s):
They're not attacking, they're literally just thinking that it's food. They're

11 (2h 23m 11s):
Just hoping, they're like, oh, is this a food? Oh no, it's not gross, you know, but a shark kind like pick it up and touch it and go, oh no, this isn't good. Yeah. Like their way of figuring that out is a nip. They

4 (2h 23m 19s):
They nip you and they're like my bad. Yeah. Straight up and then leading to death. Yeah,

0 (2h 23m 23s):
Exactly. So people are getting shark bit or bit by sharks are not even being like fully bit by sharks.

11 (2h 23m 28s):
No, they're being tasted. Yeah.

0 (2h 23m 29s):
Oh my god. Yeah.

4 (2h 23m 30s):
It's an appetizer. What about the inverse of that? Is there any animal that has a great PR team that is secretly kind of an asshole and dangerous pandas.

11 (2h 23m 37s):
Oh

0 (2h 23m 38s):
Really? Dude,

11 (2h 23m 39s):
Pandas.

0 (2h 23m 40s):
No

11 (2h 23m 40s):
Way. They're dumb as shit. They will hand you, you could google this If. you go to a panda in captivity, And, it has a baby and it's nurturing. Its cute little baby. And you put out an apple, it will hand you its baby and take the apple. Swear to God, nobody talks about this. They're dumb as shit. They're mean, they they're terrible parents. Bad mom. They're bad moms. Yeah. And we're like, oh, the panda. It's like the symbol for wwm.

0 (2h 24m 1s):
I love it. Was gonna say some videos where they're rolling around and looking dumb

11 (2h 24m 4s):
Because they're dumb. That's it. They they they got the easy street of pr, man. It's crazy.

0 (2h 24m 9s):
That's awesome.

4 (2h 24m 10s):
They're cuddly though.

11 (2h 24m 11s):
Oh, they're adorable. Yeah.

Rollback (2h 24m 12s):
So I had one last question. This has been awesome. It's, it's great to have you stop by the Rollback question. R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo code. Take 20% off your first purchase. QIPs polos hoodies, joggers shorts, Rollback dot com, promo code take.

0 (2h 24m 25s):
So what animal do we need even more? Pe I, we have a a, a colleague who's very funny, his name's Nick. And he has a theory that more kids should have octopus as their favorite animal. That they just have a really bad, they're just not in children's books, but an octopus is like the coolest animal.

4 (2h 24m 43s):
They're so smart. Right?

11 (2h 24m 44s):
They're so smart. I, my, the, one of the guys on my, my podcast is convinced that they're aliens. He Right. He believes it full-heartedly. This guy Peter on the wild times. But

0 (2h 24m 52s):
You never see it in, they're never in. But you know, you got foxes, nothing. You got pandas, you got raccoons. You know, they're always even sharks, you know all that. They

4 (2h 24m 59s):
Got the, they got the tentacles and it's like, there's always the scary music playing straight

0 (2h 25m 2s):
Up screen

11 (2h 25m 2s):
Up straight up. No, I love it. I think it's a great call. I think octopus are insanely intelligent. They can change the color of the skin, their texture, their skin. They can hide in anything. They can make a clamshell their home. They're epic predators. Like they can go out and catch something without each crime.

0 (2h 25m 17s):
I saw a video of one of them catching a shark the other day.

11 (2h 25m 19s):
It's insane, right? Yeah. They just reach out and grab it and pull it in. Yeah, they're awesome. I think more kids, I, I agree with Nick. I think more kids Okay. Should have an octopus as their favorite animal. Okay.

4 (2h 25m 27s):
Up that document you drew a book, the the octopus teacher. Yeah. Blew my mind. It's crazy, right? Like you think I made friends with an octopus straight up. Yeah. They were just buddies and they'd hang out every day.

11 (2h 25m 35s):
Yeah. Just pals And. it shows you that level of like cognitive intelligence where the octopus was like, oh yeah, this is like an actual friend to me and it's, it's benefiting me to have this relationship. Yeah.

4 (2h 25m 45s):
Yeah. They're the best. Yeah. I love Octa. What about, what about Orca? Where do they stand? Do they have a good PR team or bad PR team?

11 (2h 25m 51s):
I think generally pretty bad because especially recently right? They're knocking over boats and stuff. Yeah. Until that orcas have never actually hurt or killed anyone in the wild. All those or cadets have been in captivity it

0 (2h 26m 3s):
Seems that we know of.

11 (2h 26m 4s):
That we know of. That we know of. That's

0 (2h 26m 6s):
Maybe they're actually just the best at covering it

4 (2h 26m 8s):
Up. Like the zodiac. Yeah, true.

11 (2h 26m 10s):
Yeah. Yeah. True. The zodiac orca. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good movie. But yeah, I think that, you know, people are really scared of orcas and rightfully so. Like, I've dove in with orcas and it's the only animal. And I, I might, I might have a different answer to this after the polar braids, it's the only animal I've ever been around where I feel completely useless. Like if that orca wants to eat me, if wants to smack me with his tail, wants to do anything, there's nothing I can do. You're in the water with a big shark, you swim at it, you like show aggressive body language. The shark's like, whoa, you know, you're in the water with an orca. It's like you're a ragdoll. Like whatever they wanna do, they're gonna do. So I think that they probably get like a pretty bad rap overall. But for the most part they, until, until recently, I guess they don't wanna have anything to do with us.

4 (2h 26m 47s):
Yeah. Speaking of orcas, there was a, a situation last summer, I don't know if you're familiar with it, but there was an orca that was in Florida that was like kind of on her last leg. She wasn't doing well in captivity. Oh yeah. The owner of the Colts, Jim Rse was gonna pay like $3 million to fly it across the country and then put it in, I forget which body of water

11 (2h 27m 5s):
Let her go though. Right? In

4 (2h 27m 6s):
Seattle. Yeah. Let her go. Basically let her go into like a, a very large but contained area. Yeah. It was like a natural area.

11 (2h 27m 12s):
I remember that.

4 (2h 27m 13s):
How would you transport an orca? How can you fly an orca?

11 (2h 27m 16s):
So they're like a lot of marine mammals, as long as they stay hydrated and wet because they're air breathing, they're actually, okay. So this is a bad analogy, but you know how you can see a turtle crossing the road and you're like, oh, there's a turtle, right? Like it should be in water. It's fine as long as it's wet and you know, stays like that. So same thing with an orca. You can transport them. They don't have to be in a tank of water. They just have to be wet and hydrated. And so I imagine with that instance, you'd probably have in some kind of a containment, but you'd pick up that container, fly it and land it. And it's not like it'd be a giant fish tank. It would just need to be wet. So

4 (2h 27m 48s):
You just put a big whale onto a giant plane. Yep. And essentially have a bunch of hoses that spray the or

11 (2h 27m 53s):
Hoses wet blankets kind of thing. You know, towels, just keeping it really hydrated and wet water in its mouth and then, then move it.

4 (2h 27m 60s):
Wow. Because our, our producer Hank said that it couldn't be done. He said, you can't move whale.

11 (2h 28m 4s):
He's wrong. He knows nothing. Well,

0 (2h 28m 5s):

0 (2h 28m 43s):
Tell it's kind of like us. We don't tell our parents No.

0 (2h 29m 53s):
Okay, it's time the Mount Rushmore redo to decide who loses Mount Rushmore season. How we got here. If, you missed the dual on Tuesday. PFT won on the votes and then we found out there was maybe some graphic things that happened. I actually, for people who are saying Hank's a sore loser, I do not think he was ready. He was ready to take the loss Was pf t's decision to redo.

4 (2h 30m 19s):
It's my choice.

0 (2h 30m 19s):
So I do not think Hank was in the wrong whatsoever. There also, when you look back, there were some Max asks specifically what should be on the graphic and that did change. So I think we're we're fair for a red redo. There are

4 (2h 30m 32s):
Irregularities. Yeah. So, and, and I accept that. I'm happy. I I am happy to abide by the outcome of this red redo.

0 (2h 30m 38s):
So for the red redo let's, we will Maxwell say, what do you want on the graphic? And that will, there will be no changes. Is that fair? That's fair. Not a single change from the word you want on the graphic, Hank. Yep, that's fair. Okay. Alright. So it's gonna be a one Mount Rushmore redo. Before we do it, we have the hat with the punishments. Ooh. So you guys can pick, and this is actually fun because whoever ends up winning this will not have to do the punishment they picked, which is gonna be a great cancellation. There's four punishments in here. There is LeBron's points, there's winning a natty in NCAA 25, there is running a marathon and there is a nine Darter doing a marathon.

0 (2h 31m 24s):
Doing a marathon. Yeah. Do you're right. Doing a marathon, completing a marathon, completing a marathon, completing 26.2 miles. If I in one, in one setting,

4 (2h 31m 30s):
If I complete the marathon, can I not tell people about it? Well

0 (2h 31m 34s):
You're gonna stream it. So as long

4 (2h 31m 36s):
As I don't actually say the words that's, I ran a marathon. Yeah.

0 (2h 31m 38s):
Alright, so, and you both get a veto So. if you If you If, you get If, you pick one that you, you do not wanna do, you can then just take it out of the hat.

4 (2h 31m 46s):
Okay. Who picks first?

0 (2h 31m 50s):
If? you use your veto. You can't be like, oh, but actually I want to do that. That's fair. Yep. Who would like to go first?

4 (2h 31m 57s):
I'll go first.

0 (2h 31m 58s):
PFT is taken from the hat. PFT What is your

4 (2h 32m 2s):
Pick? My pick is LeBron's scoring record.

0 (2h 32m 7s):
I would veto that. If r were you,

4 (2h 32m 11s):
How long do you think it's gonna take?

0 (2h 32m 12s):
I think it will take you like four days.

4 (2h 32m 15s):
How many points could that guy have scored?

0 (2h 32m 16s):
All right, quick math. How many threes did we say he hit?

4 (2h 32m 20s):
Well, he scored zero points in college.

0 (2h 32m 22s):
How many threes has LeBron James hit? How many threes do you think he could hit in a minute? PFT

4 (2h 32m 28s):
Two, two

0 (2h 32m 28s):
In a minute. So just the threes. So that would be okay. So just the threes would take you

4 (2h 32m 37s):
2.5.

0 (2h 32m 38s):
We're gonna go with two and we'll just see. Just the threes would take you 20 hours.

4 (2h 32m 43s):
Whew. And that's nonstop. You hit two a minute and that's nonstop.

0 (2h 32m 47s):
Yeah, you

6 (2h 32m 47s):
Could hit more than two in a minute though.

4 (2h 32m 48s):
I'm, I'm,

0 (2h 32m 50s):
Let's say, let's say you could hit five in

4 (2h 32m 52s):
A minute. Okay?

0 (2h 32m 53s):
Five in a minute would be

4 (2h 32m 56s):
10 hours ish.

6 (2h 32m 57s):
So we just put a, an un impossible thing on one of the punishments because no one was ever doing this. If, if that's what you're saying.

0 (2h 33m 5s):
Well, no, you could shoot, you could shoot threes that would take you eight hours. If, you hit five a minute. I mean, Hank, you could probably hit 10 threes a minute. So that would take you four hours. Like I, I think you could do it. Hank, I

4 (2h 33m 16s):
Don't know. Is it, and that's total po

0 (2h 33m 18s):
No, that's just his

4 (2h 33m 19s):
Three, just his threes. Okay. Yeah. This,

0 (2h 33m 20s):
But it is just layups. Yeah. Then it's just layups and free throws.

4 (2h 33m 24s):
Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna ick. Okay.

0 (2h 33m 31s):
What pick do you have there?

4 (2h 33m 34s):
I got marathon. Oh,

0 (2h 33m 36s):
Okay. So PFT will be completing a marathon if he loses, give me it back.

4 (2h 33m 43s):
Wait, when is it said marathon?

0 (2h 33m 45s):
Whenever I'd say, I'd say it has to be within the next three months. Is that fair? Oh,

6 (2h 33m 50s):
It's not the Chicago marathon.

0 (2h 33m 51s):
Well we were saying we could do it, but I don't know. If, you can enter at this point.

4 (2h 33m 54s):
I would almost rather do, there would

0 (2h 33m 55s):
Be more hoops to go

4 (2h 33m 56s):
Through. I would rather do the marathon. That's like two weeks from now, three weeks from now than to have to wait three months and Yeah, just have that over my head. Alright, so you want

0 (2h 34m 4s):
To say it within a month? I'll

4 (2h 34m 5s):
Try to do the Chicago marathon if I lose. Okay.

0 (2h 34m 8s):
Yeah. So, so, so let's say buy the Chicago marathon, whether it be doing it on your own or doing the actual Chicago

4 (2h 34m 15s):
Marathon. Yeah. 'cause I don't want to have to spend like three months actually training for marathon. Correct. The worst

0 (2h 34m 20s):
Part is, that's perfect. Yeah. Chicago Marathon is Sunday, October 13th. Okay. So you have to have completed a marathon by the end of Sunday, October 13th. And you could do it, you could do it, we could do a stream or you could actually run it. We, we would have to find someone who'd run in front of you with the backpack.

4 (2h 34m 35s):
Okay.

0 (2h 34m 37s):
Hank

13 (2h 34m 38s):
Juan Henry

0 (2h 34m 44s):
Has picked

6 (2h 34m 48s):
Nine Darter.

4 (2h 34m 49s):
Oh, I would veto that if I were you. Well,

0 (2h 34m 52s):
It's, so we're not gonna do regulation length. We've, we've established that it'd be a, a fair length, but

6 (2h 34m 58s):
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it. Wow.

0 (2h 34m 60s):
Wow. I love, love it. Now I want Hank

6 (2h 35m 3s):
To lose. Yes. I didn't want to do like a marathon would kill me.

0 (2h 35m 7s):
So what exactly is it? Nine daughter again?

6 (2h 35m 10s):
It's 180 points in

0 (2h 35m 12s):
Nine rows in nine throws. So you

4 (2h 35m 13s):
Have to make nine darts as triple twenties?

6 (2h 35m 16s):
No, no.

0 (2h 35m 16s):
You, you can, you can do it in any order, right? Yeah. Is there multiple ways to get a nine darter? Yeah. So yeah. Oh,

4 (2h 35m 22s):
Okay. I thought it was nine triple 20.

6 (2h 35m 23s):
Oh no, nine. No, no, no, no, no. It's, it's, oh my god, it's even worse. It's 501 points in nine darts.

0 (2h 35m 32s):
Oh my God. There's

6 (2h 35m 33s):
A, there's a bunch of different combinations, but

4 (2h 35m 36s):
You have to get exactly 501. Yeah. Whew.

0 (2h 35m 39s):
Yeah. Three. Yeah, there's, there's, there's a bunch of combinations. You get 3 23 nineteens and a double 12, 3 23 fifteens and a double 18, three seventeens, three eighteens, and a double 18.

4 (2h 35m 54s):
Those seem like they might be doable.

0 (2h 35m 57s):
And then there's also three twenties, three nineteens and a bullseye.

6 (2h 36m 4s):
Because what were the, it was marathon.

0 (2h 36m 6s):
Wait, is it, is it, it's three triple 20, right? Yeah, yeah. It's not just three twenties. So we would, we would come up with a fair distance. It would not be the regulation distance. We've established that it would be a, a distance that is fair to having it be a possibility. So are you gonna keep it?

6 (2h 36m 24s):
Because what's the third one besides all college football? Yeah. That

0 (2h 36m 29s):
Are, you could do glitch plays, but

6 (2h 36m 30s):
I don't want Chad would kill you. Don't, I don't wanna risk it. I don't wanna risk, yeah. I don't wanna risk getting marathoner LeBron.

0 (2h 36m 37s):
I mean the nine darter would be electric. Yeah. Like you getting a nine darter would be an

6 (2h 36m 42s):
Absolute mistake. And I think the physical toll on my body Yeah,

0 (2h 36m 45s):
You might actually end up just getting really good at darts.

6 (2h 36m 47s):
Yeah. Which that's a bonus.

0 (2h 36m 50s):
Okay. And then should we just say for, for fairness that you have to do the nine daughter before October 13th as well? That's fine.

4 (2h 36m 55s):
Alright. Okay.

0 (2h 36m 57s):
Okay. And

4 (2h 36m 58s):
If I don't get, if I lose and I don't get into the Chicago marathon for whatever reason, you'll just run it. I will run an alternate marathon. Yeah, yeah. No,

0 (2h 37m 5s):
To that point I think it'll be,

4 (2h 37m 7s):
And then I'm gonna bike around the Chicago entire island of Manhattan.

0 (2h 37m 10s):
I will as well. What? And then we're gonna eat shit if Florida State loses their next game. Yeah.

4 (2h 37m 15s):
That fucking coward.

0 (2h 37m 17s):
It's crazy. What a coward

4 (2h 37m 18s):
That I ate shit for the capitals And. it wasn't even, it was after a win. Yeah.

0 (2h 37m 23s):
This also just reminds me that when I pick my pinky team this year, I mean every year it's in the back of my head, but

14 (2h 37m 29s):
Just

4 (2h 37m 29s):
Deactivate shaft.

0 (2h 37m 30s):
Fucking

14 (2h 37m 32s):
Cut

0 (2h 37m 32s):
Off to my pinky. Okay. Are we ready to go boys? We gotta also odds or evens on the lottery ball. Decide who goes first.

4 (2h 37m 40s):
Hank odds or evens?

14 (2h 37m 44s):
Evens, please. Okay.

0 (2h 37m 46s):
Hank has selected evens.

4 (2h 37m 51s):
Pick a number two. Hank. I'm gonna take eight 40 and If you get it right then you would Automatic win. Yeah. Automatic win. Yeah. Automatic

14 (2h 37m 58s):
Win three

0 (2h 38m 0s):
Means three does not count.

14 (2h 38m 6s):
Oh, 43. Oh, that

4 (2h 38m 10s):
Would've been all time.

0 (2h 38m 12s):
So PFT would you like to go first?

4 (2h 38m 15s):
I would like to go first. Big. Cat.

0 (2h 38m 16s):
Okay. So hit the timer up

4 (2h 38m 21s):
And we're doing a minute and a half. Hank.

0 (2h 38m 23s):
You guys can take two minutes. Okay, here we go. Well, we haven't started, I haven't said the topic yet. It's two minutes. Two minutes. Okay. We're gonna do, because this Mount Rushmore season has been been very fun. And we were thinking about all the moments and what was the moment that stuck out the most? How did you say it on the graphic? What color is cheese? Arguing about the color of cheese. What color is cheese? Yeah, what color is cheese? So we are going to do a color, we are going to do the Mount Rushmore of green.

0 (2h 39m 4s):
The boys are writing the Mount Rushmore of green.

5 (2h 39m 11s):
I

14 (2h 39m 11s):
What?

5 (2h 39m 13s):
I'm just trying to think of who I, who I want to do their punishment.

0 (2h 39m 16s):
I think both, both are great. I'm excited about both. I actually would've dreaded if one of them had landed on LeBron, I would've been been like, this is actually not gonna be possible. But

5 (2h 39m 25s):
The nine daughter could be, could be just

0 (2h 39m 27s):
The nine daughter would be

5 (2h 39m 28s):
Electric. But the nine daughter I like because it could be so long. Or it could, it could, it

0 (2h 39m 33s):
Could be. Yeah. He could just be incredible. He could

5 (2h 39m 34s):
Just be

0 (2h 39m 35s):
A beast. The fact that there's multiple ways to get it too.

5 (2h 39m 37s):
Yeah, but it's not like you can mess, mess up.

0 (2h 39m 41s):
No, you have to be perfect. But like, think about the stream and having

5 (2h 39m 48s):
The, like, once he gets like the first five in a row,

0 (2h 39m 51s):
Right?

5 (2h 39m 52s):
It it, oh it, it would be so good. I, I want the nine darter. The marathon would be funny, but the nine Darter could be

0 (2h 39m 59s):
Like the, the nine daughter's great just because it's, you get the moment. You get the moment and you also get like he'll have moments where he'll get seven in a row and then he's fucks up and

5 (2h 40m 9s):
Then fuck. There'll be so many moments for the Yeah,

0 (2h 40m 12s):
I want the best man to win.

5 (2h 40m 14s):
Yeah. The nine daughter. I wanna watch the nine daughter show bad.

0 (2h 40m 18s):
Either way. We, we figured out, so next year we were talking about it. We'll do Mount Rushmore season, kind of like rivalry week. We'll have dual week where we're all dual each other. So like, like Monday, like I'll dual Hank Max will dual PFT. Tuesday I'll, or Wednesday I'll dual Hank or Max PFT and Hank. So we'll do dual week. That will, it's like the in-season tournament. Dual week will be electric.

5 (2h 40m 43s):
Dual week will be electric. I fucking love the dual. I'm addicted to the dual. Dual.

0 (2h 40m 47s):
I just went to sleep in like dual dual re redo

5 (2h 40m 51s):
Redu. I woke up nine seconds

0 (2h 40m 54s):
A little. I was like a little bra meme. I can't believe this is my life. We're re redoing five. Do you guys need more time? Do you need more time? Time is

5 (2h 41m 2s):
Up.

0 (2h 41m 4s):
I'm good. Okay. Okay. And obviously I don't have to say this, but I'll say it just because we've had controversies. We're taping this, you know, at 1145. The poll's not going up till two Please No funny business on Twitter with any tipping pics or anything. I'm not gonna tweet anything. Okay. Just to be safe. Yes. Hank you agree? No. Funny, funny business. And then we will not, we will all not look at our phones from two o'clock to three o'clock. Yep. And then we will find out live. Who has won the Mount Rushmore? Okay. PFT. You have first pick. What is your first selection for Mount Rushmore of Green?

0 (2h 41m 44s):
My first pick is going to be weed. Whoa. Taking weed right off the bat. That wasn't my one. One. Marijuana. Wow. Greenleaf Reefer. Wow. Jazz cigarettes. Wacky to tobacco. Just weed on the graphic weed. It's good for you. On my graphic, I would just like the word cash. Love that. That was my one. One. Cash is good. Cash is good. Cash is not money. Some would say just cash.

0 (2h 42m 24s):
We gotta have this clear. Some would say cash is king. Cash money. Cash money. Cash money. Okay. Okay. That's smart. That's smart. Alright, so you have just weed, not marijuana. Two. I would like it on top of each other. You want it? You want it. Marijuana or weed. And now I feel like I'm being coached into saying marijuana. No, I'm just asking. I'm gonna stick with weed. Okay. Weed all stick. That's a good one. I, I like it. I like it. I just want, we're just making sure there's no issues when we get to the graphic that whatever is said in these white lines is going to be put on the graphic. Yep. That's no changes. That's, that's fair. Okay. My second pick will be football field. Mm. Good one.

0 (2h 43m 4s):
I thought about doing sports fields.

5 (2h 43m 7s):
No. Football field. Good football field.

0 (2h 43m 8s):
Better is good. It's a good pick. Yeah, it's a good pick. That moment

4 (2h 43m 11s):
We talked about it strong where you're, you're walking through the concourse and you see the green through the, the cement.

0 (2h 43m 16s):
It's a good pick. It's a strong start to distract. A strong start. Both boys have been making Yep. Right. The right moves.

4 (2h 43m 22s):
I gotta say I, I'm, I'm deep in my own head though. 'cause I, I didn't even have cash on my list.

0 (2h 43m 26s):
That was my one. One. Yeah. I'm, I actually, we had the discussion. There's two minutes. Yeah. Beforehand we were like, we didn't want to pick a Mount Rushmore that had like a boobs or something. That, and we were, we had the discussion is money too much of a one? One? But listen, weed was a great pick. Hank your second pick. Oh no, the lights are kind of going out over here. The lights are kind of going out. There's another strong one out there.

6 (2h 43m 60s):
I don't, I don't have a lot. Kelly Green jerseys. Mm.

0 (2h 44m 7s):
Okay.

4 (2h 44m 9s):
Okay. I'm

6 (2h 44m 10s):
In, I'm in a bad spot.

0 (2h 44m 12s):
Okay. Okay. That we were making the right picks until then, but, okay.

6 (2h 44m 17s):
Yeah. I mean, it's tough that I, I I got, I really don't have, I'm, I'm screwed.

4 (2h 44m 21s):
Hank. I did have Kelly jerseys on my list, but it was way down there.

6 (2h 44m 25s):
Yeah. No, I don't, I don't, I my list is, is fucked.

0 (2h 44m 28s):
All right.

4 (2h 44m 29s):
PFT I'm gonna go with Ireland. Mm

0 (2h 44m 34s):
Mm Okay.

6 (2h 44m 37s):
What does that mean?

4 (2h 44m 38s):
Ireland's green, the Emerald Isle. That's what they call it.

0 (2h 44m 41s):
What would you like on the graphic?

4 (2h 44m 42s):
Ireland.

0 (2h 44m 43s):
Okay.

6 (2h 44m 44s):
How is Ireland green? I

0 (2h 44m 45s):
Think we went, we went, we went, we went off. We went off the board here. No, I

Ireland's a good pick. You're wrong about

6 (2h 44m 51s):
Graphic. There's explain

4 (2h 44m 53s):
Green. Ireland Island is known as being a green island. Yeah. It's green. They call it the Emerald Island.

0 (2h 44m 59s):
I can't, I can't speak because I don't want to, I don't want to have anything be changed or any, any, anyone think of things. Well to we'll discuss after Henry your third pick.

Are you outta picks?

6 (2h 45m 16s):
I just don't have any good ones.

4 (2h 45m 20s):
There's one that I thought Hank would've for sure.

16 (2h 45m 27s):
Wow. This is tense. This is tense. The boys are stuck. The boys are stuck. He's got

0 (2h 45m 34s):
Something happen.

4 (2h 45m 35s):
Just went away. It went away.

0 (2h 45m 38s):
He had it, he had it

4 (2h 45m 40s):
Latched back onto that. Hank, whatever that thought was.

0 (2h 45m 42s):
Chase.

4 (2h 45m 42s):
Bring

0 (2h 45m 43s):
It back in. Chase that thought.

4 (2h 45m 44s):
I can just feel

0 (2h 45m 45s):
The nerves in this room. It's chase the thought. Butterflies. Chase the thought. Hank, find it. You have a good draft going right now with cash money.

6 (2h 45m 54s):
I really don't.

0 (2h 45m 55s):
Cash money's a great pick four

6 (2h 45m 56s):
Leaf clover.

0 (2h 45m 58s):
Okay. Okay. Okay. That's not terrible. That's a pretty good, that's a pretty good pick for you. That might be better than I. Don Do. I thought you were gonna go.

4 (2h 46m 5s):
Disagree. Much worse. Alright. I think, I think this is gonna wrap it up for me. The green jacket.

0 (2h 46m 13s):
Mm. That's a good pick the green jacket. That's a really, that's a really good pick. Good. That's

17 (2h 46m 18s):
A really good pick. I didn't think of it. And that's really good.

4 (2h 46m 20s):
That's a really good pick. I did not think that that was gonna last this long.

6 (2h 46m 22s):
That's a good pick. I can't believe

4 (2h 46m 24s):
He went Ireland over the green jacket.

0 (2h 46m 26s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 46m 27s):
Because if I knew that Hank didn't have the green jacket. Yeah. 'cause if he did, he would've said it earlier.

0 (2h 46m 35s):
That might have wrapped it

6 (2h 46m 36s):
Up. Yeah, that wrapped it up. Congrats. PFT. I'll go with Nickelodeon. Slime. Ooh.

0 (2h 46m 46s):
I don't hate it. Yeah.

4 (2h 46m 47s):
It's not a bad pick to just pull outta the air. Yeah.

0 (2h 46m 49s):
So the reason why I was pushing back on Ireland, so that's a final Nickelodeon slime. Okay. We were talking before I St. Patrick's Day. Just picking St. Patrick's Day would've been a banger pick.

4 (2h 47m 3s):
Yeah. I I feel like Ireland. I was,

0 (2h 47m 5s):
I was waiting for that over Ireland.

4 (2h 47m 6s):
Ireland contains St. Patrick's Day, but it's much, much more than that. I'm shocked that

0 (2h 47m 11s):
Graphics St. Patrick's Day would've been a

4 (2h 47m 12s):
Huge hit. I think Ireland just as its own is good. But Hank, I'm shocked that you took Kelly jerseys over Celtics uniforms.

6 (2h 47m 21s):
I was trying not to tip. Yeah.

4 (2h 47m 23s):
Yeah. I also had, I

0 (2h 47m 25s):
Figured you weren't gonna tip.

4 (2h 47m 26s):
I had a J JLo's dress. You remember that dress? Oh yeah.

0 (2h 47m 30s):
That was a good one. That was a

4 (2h 47m 31s):
Great green

0 (2h 47m 31s):
Dress. Snakes.

4 (2h 47m 34s):
Snakes.

0 (2h 47m 34s):
Just snakes.

4 (2h 47m 36s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 47m 37s):
That, that's not a good pick. I'm just saying parrots. I'm just saying green things.

4 (2h 47m 41s):
Parrots are good.

0 (2h 47m 42s):
Avocados.

4 (2h 47m 43s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 47m 46s):
Hank, what are you writing?

6 (2h 47m 47s):
I'm, I'm writing him. I'm writing him out.

4 (2h 47m 50s):
You're see, you're doing a manual graphic.

0 (2h 47m 54s):
What else? What else did you, what memes did you think left

6 (2h 47m 56s):
Off? Green jacket. I mean, that was a good pick.

4 (2h 47m 58s):
Memes thought about the jets. Mr. P?

0 (2h 48m 0s):
Yeah. Oh yeah.

4 (2h 48m 2s):
Yeah. Mr. Pear.

0 (2h 48m 3s):
Mr. Pear would've been good. Crocodo dinosaur. I, oh,

4 (2h 48m 8s):
Dinosaur would, dinosaurs are a big miss. Yeah.

0 (2h 48m 11s):
Dinosaur would've been good. Ger

6 (2h 48m 12s):
I was, I I I didn't want to, I I was gonna be hot sauce all over again. But I was thinking like, like tropical tropical water. Tropical ocean water.

0 (2h 48m 22s):
Yeah. That would've not been for

4 (2h 48m 23s):
Sure. Blue. Yeah, it's blue,

6 (2h 48m 26s):
But sometimes it

0 (2h 48m 27s):
Cank. Oh,

4 (2h 48m 27s):
Shreks a big mess too. Really

0 (2h 48m 29s):
Good wine. Shreks a great one. Damn. Shrek is a great one.

6 (2h 48m 34s):
I think the Kelly Green jerseys and the green. I don't know. Maybe think Philly will show out

0 (2h 48m 38s):
Watermelons.

6 (2h 48m 40s):
I also think the, the thing that if, which I don't think it really played any factor. Like people voting for certain people. But you having weed and me having Kelly Green jerseys might, and you having green jacket might, you know, sway people to think it's me. But I, I don't think that matters. I don't think that mattered in Yeah. Yeah.

4 (2h 49m 4s):
Poles.

6 (2h 49m 4s):
Although except for the hang

0 (2h 49m 5s):
Ninja Turtles.

4 (2h 49m 7s):
Oh, turtle

0 (2h 49m 8s):
Turtles would been been fucking dynamites.

4 (2h 49m 10s):
Damn. That would,

0 (2h 49m 11s):
Yeah. Yoshi, that would've been dynamite. I

6 (2h 49m 14s):
Think I got a shot.

4 (2h 49m 15s):
Cash

0 (2h 49m 15s):
Money is a big one. It

4 (2h 49m 17s):
Is. That's a, that's a good one. One if I had to do over

6 (2h 49m 18s):
And for clover's a good counter to Ireland. Yeah.

4 (2h 49m 21s):
I would've taken it. Yeah. It's luck knowing what I know now. I would've taken cash, money won one over weed. Yeah. Yeah.

0 (2h 49m 29s):
I think it's gonna be tight.

5 (2h 49m 30s):
Yeah. I, I don't, I'm not over.

0 (2h 49m 31s):
Green jacket might be the one that If you had gotten one other solid one. If you had gotten like Ninja Turtles or something. Yeah,

6 (2h 49m 36s):
But football Kelly, everyone loves the Kelly Green jerseys. That's

0 (2h 49m 39s):
True. I had football stand up. Football

5 (2h 49m 41s):
Field. Yeah.

0 (2h 49m 42s):
Okay boys. So we'll find out at the end in a minute while you're listening to this in a minute, but in a couple hours here in real time. Who lost Mount Rushmore season? Good work. We feel good about the redo.

4 (2h 49m 57s):
I think it's fair.

6 (2h 49m 59s):
Same.

0 (2h 49m 59s):
Okay.

5 (2h 49m 60s):
And what we're no graphic changes?

4 (2h 50m 3s):
No. Can you read off the graphics officially? Now

5 (2h 50m 7s):
We're gonna No, I can't do

0 (2h 50m 9s):
That right now. We, the other one we were thinking about doing, which we can just save for next summer was one time. PMT guests. Oh, that would be good.

4 (2h 50m 15s):
Yeah, that'd be a really good one. We'll save

0 (2h 50m 17s):
That for next summer. I

5 (2h 50m 17s):
Wanted to do cheese

7 (2h 50m 19s):
Official graphic team. One brush more of cheese official graphic team. One weed football field, Ireland, the green jacket team two cash money. Kelly Green jerseys, four leaf clover. Nickelodeon slime

0 (2h 50m 32s):
I'd. It's,

6 (2h 50m 33s):
I would like cash on top of money. Yep. I would like Kelly Green on top of jerseys. Yep. Four leaf on top of Clover. Nickelodeon on top of slime.

0 (2h 50m 43s):
Oh, okay. That is

4 (2h 50m 45s):
Exactly how it's, I like, however, however, memes and Shane formatted is good for me. I'm not gonna be a pain in the button. Ask you guys to change things.

0 (2h 50m 53s):
Okay. Let's wait. All right. Wait. Good job boys. Okay. It's time boys.

4 (2h 51m 3s):
It is time. Oh,

0 (2h 51m 4s):
It is time. Before we

4 (2h 51m 5s):
Do it, do we want to address recurring guest, one of our best friends in the entire world? Yeah. Jerry O'Connell last time he was on the show, I think we talked to him. You know, one of the things we appreciate about Jerry is he's, he's our guy and he said that he had said no to all the podcast requests that he had in the past to talk about fancy football. And this morning he was on good morning football, talking about fantasy football. Look the squad now. He was adamant that that doesn't count as cheating. And I agree with him. Yeah. He just

0 (2h 51m 35s):
Did butt stuff.

4 (2h 51m 36s):
I agree with you. Mouth stuff. In the same way that like if his wife Rebecca came on our show without Jerry and talked to us for a long time, just, you know, shot the bull whatever, had a cool hang. That would be her cheating on Jerry. No, that would just be us becoming really good friends with re Rebecca Roma.

0 (2h 51m 54s):
I saw this. It hurt me. I'll be honest, it hurt me a little.

4 (2h 52m 0s):
I'm okay

0 (2h 52m 1s):
With it. I'm okay with it because I love Jerry and I know Jerry, it's, it's, it, it more, I don't blame Jerry. What if

4 (2h 52m 7s):
It keeps happening,

0 (2h 52m 9s):
Then we're gonna have No, you know what, Jerry can do whatever he wants. I'm I I'm not gonna put a restriction on Jerry. It's more that the good morning football just trying to rip us off. That's more what it is. But Jerry can be Jerry. I love Jerry. I'll never be mad at Jerry. I can never be mad at Jerry. And I actually wouldn't have even thought of it if he didn't. You know, it was kind of, it was kind of foreshadowing the fact that he was so proud of never of turning everyone down. Yeah. We should have been like, huh. That's weird. We didn't even, we, I didn't even think about it. Like, of course you can do whatever show you want, you're grown, man. But he like bragged about it and we were like, oh, this is great. He loves us the most. And then he went and did that.

4 (2h 52m 44s):
If he never brought that up to us Yeah. Then I wouldn't, I'd be like, yeah Jerry

0 (2h 52m 48s):
Yeah, of course.

4 (2h 52m 48s):
Fuck fancy football all the time. Whoever you want.

0 (2h 52m 52s):
He basically was like, I'll never cheat on you. Yeah.

4 (2h 52m 55s):
Now he's gonna start suspecting us at cheating. That's what he's gonna, he's gonna go on there and be like, I went on good morning football and had the best sex of my life.

0 (2h 53m 2s):
Yeah. I'm fine with it for Jerry's sake because he is a star and I love him. Yeah. I just wish that, you know, I wish whatever we need to get. Let's see. I know River Phoenix, he's dead. Corey Feldman. I think

4 (2h 53m 17s):
We just get Rebecca

0 (2h 53m 18s):
Corey Feldman's still alive. I

4 (2h 53m 19s):
Think we get Rebecca on I would

0 (2h 53m 20s):
Say some other, some other actor from Stand By Me and just have them be our fantasy expert.

4 (2h 53m 24s):
Key for Sutherland.

0 (2h 53m 25s):
Key for Sutherland. We get key for Sutherland. He's

4 (2h 53m 27s):
Got a great voice. Yeah.

0 (2h 53m 29s):
Is Cory Feldman still alive?

4 (2h 53m 31s):
I think so. Yeah. The other Cory,

0 (2h 53m 32s):
He's in a band. The other Cory passed away. That's right.

4 (2h 53m 34s):
Yeah. Cory Feldman's in a band. They sound like Limp Bizkit. Okay.

0 (2h 53m 37s):
So maybe Cory Feldman's gonna be our new fantasy expert. Yeah, I have no problem though. Jerry can do whatever he wants. Yeah. I love Jerry. Okay, it's time. Let's reveal.

4 (2h 53m 47s):
Good luck, Hank.

0 (2h 53m 47s):
So memes, you're gonna tell us the percentages and then you will tell us the teams

4 (2h 53m 51s):
And the stakes are, if, if I lose, I have to run a marathon. If Hank loses, Hank has to get a nine daughter. Nine

0 (2h 53m 59s):
Daughter. And this is it. This is final. This is the Mount

6 (2h 54m 2s):
Rushmore season. This is final. This is PFT. Bring it on. You

0 (2h 54m 6s):
Think he did it? Yeah. You think he won?

4 (2h 54m 8s):
I think I, I think I did too.

7 (2h 54m 11s):
Okay. Are you ready? Yes. Are you ready?

0 (2h 54m 13s):
Yes. Yes. Alright.

7 (2h 54m 15s):
Percentages. The percentage, 25%. Oh to 75%. Oh,

6 (2h 54m 22s):
Congrats. PFT

7 (2h 54m 27s):
Henry, you are the loser. Oh yeah.

0 (2h 54m 35s):
Hank, he's taking off his headphones.

7 (2h 54m 38s):
I thought it was gonna be closer than that.

0 (2h 54m 40s):
I did too. Where do we think it went wrong? Green jacket hurt Cash money was a great pick. It was

4 (2h 54m 47s):
Great. First round pick

0 (2h 54m 48s):
Kelly Green Jersey. I

6 (2h 54m 49s):
Just didn't have a lot of picks. I really had nothing. I was out Shrek, but like, I don't even know what else I had. Like regular Ninja Turtles. Yeah. Ninja Turtles would've been good.

0 (2h 55m 2s):
How, what's going through your head right now?

6 (2h 55m 5s):
180.

0 (2h 55m 9s):
Listen, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be there at that stream. Not the whole time, but there will be times I'll be there and I'm gonna be pumping you up and, and rooting for you.

4 (2h 55m 17s):
The the fun part is gonna be, we can get some like dart players to come in and show Hank how to throw Dart. Yeah. What if we got Michael Van Gerwin?

0 (2h 55m 24s):
What if we got someone on him on the, on the show? That would be awesome.

5 (2h 55m 28s):
Oh, we should try and get like we did Pete or we got Pete Weber. Yeah. To do a celebrity. He, he gets a celebrity dart. Oh,

0 (2h 55m 36s):
If. you can get what? Yes. Celebrity Dart can't be the last Dart. No, but you can get a celebrity Dart for sure. We did do that with Pete Weber. Yeah. You're gonna do this.

4 (2h 55m 46s):
I don't even think it's gonna take that long.

0 (2h 55m 48s):
I think you might do it right away.

4 (2h 55m 50s):
I didn't know there was so many different combinations.

6 (2h 55m 52s):
I don't think I've ever gotten two, like triple twenties and one out of three. But you

4 (2h 55m 55s):
Don't have to do, that's

5 (2h 55m 56s):
Gonna be closer.

0 (2h 55m 57s):
Yeah. You're gonna be closer.

4 (2h 55m 58s):
And there's the other combinations you can go for.

6 (2h 56m 1s):
Listen, I, I'm, I'm ready. I'm ready to face a challenge. Congrats. PFT. Thank

0 (2h 56m 7s):
You guys. Do you think it's a little bit, just because you were the grumpiest for Mount Rushmore season, this is not me asking, this is the AW Ws.

6 (2h 56m 14s):
Yeah, I mean, I had a bad Mount Rushmore season. I think it would've been a, a miracle if I hadn't lost. So yeah, I was happy I made it to a due to

0 (2h 56m 21s):
A red redo. Even getting to ADU was kind of a, a crazy run. Yeah. Double

6 (2h 56m 25s):
Duel. Yeah. We stayed alive. We fought, we fought until the very, very end. You

0 (2h 56m 29s):
Did any flags you wanted throw?

6 (2h 56m 32s):
No, I didn't even, bitch. I know. Don't understand.

0 (2h 56m 35s):
IIII You

6 (2h 56m 37s):
Did. I wanted to end it last night. I said PFT, just do it. And PFT refused until, no, I You have to do a Do I. I would, I wasn't like, I

4 (2h 56m 43s):
Wouldn't have been able to look myself in the mirror. Yeah.

0 (2h 56m 45s):
PFT had a guilty conscience.

4 (2h 56m 46s):
It was me. It was me. It was not Hank. Hank did not cry and ask for a red redo. In fact, Hank was yelling at me because I was trying to offer the red redo and he just wanted me to stop talking. Hank was wi willing to accept the

6 (2h 56m 58s):
Results. Right. But that's, people listened to that and still were like, yeah, he was crying the whole time. So yeah. It

0 (2h 57m 1s):
Is what it's, but they're just jealous of the summer of Hank, which is over and I'm taking the brunt of the blame. Yeah,

6 (2h 57m 6s):
That's fine.

5 (2h 57m 7s):
I I also, I'm not gonna say right off the, right off the bat, but we there, there might be a situation where Hank may need to earn some mulligans.

0 (2h 57m 17s):
What do you mean?

5 (2h 57m 18s):
In the nine darter? Oh

0 (2h 57m 20s):
Yeah, I would agree. But like, let's,

5 (2h 57m 22s):
We have to say

0 (2h 57m 22s):
That now. Like 10. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I, that's a good, that's a good point. I think there should be, like, there should be, there'll be some hours, there should be some hours benchmarks where, you know, 10 hours in, he gets a mulligan.

5 (2h 57m 35s):
Yes.

0 (2h 57m 36s):
Yes. 12 hours in, he gets two mulligans, 14 hours in. I agree with that. Oh, that's good. 'cause I, I I think a 24 hours should be the cap and we, we should just, we should get you there. It'll

4 (2h 57m 46s):
Be fun if I'm not trying

0 (2h 57m 47s):
To have you there.

6 (2h 57m 47s):
No, no, I'm not having you

0 (2h 57m 48s):
There

6 (2h 57m 50s):
Then you, no, this is the thing. This is where it's like you guys pick punishments. I'm gonna do it. I don't wanna get bailed out. I don't wanna be like, oh, like, 'cause then it, I'm not asking for this. You're saying this and then you go, oh, okay.

4 (2h 58m 1s):
We're trying to think of what would make for an entertaining stream. Yeah. And, and, and maybe like Hank doing a dizzy, doing a dizzy bat. And then if he hits the board on his first throw, then he earns that mulligan after a couple hours.

5 (2h 58m 12s):
There's also Mulligans in the free throw stream. Yeah. That was a great stream. Yeah, I think it's gonna

0 (2h 58m 16s):
Be Mulligans aren't bad. Yeah, it makes Mulligans exciting. It

5 (2h 58m 19s):
Does because

0 (2h 58m 20s):
It,

6 (2h 58m 20s):
But the free throw stream couldn't have ended.

5 (2h 58m 23s):
Yeah.

6 (2h 58m 24s):
Like we couldn't have ended the free throw stream e after 24 hours. We weren't gonna just end that stream. Yeah,

0 (2h 58m 30s):
True. No. Yeah. So the 24 hours thing I'm wrong about. But you should get some mulligans baked in that, that I think is, is fair. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Like we're not gonna do like a, he's saying there shouldn't be a cap on the hours because

5 (2h 58m 44s):
That Yeah, no I

0 (2h 58m 44s):
You're right, you're right about that.

5 (2h 58m 46s):
I agree with that. Yeah. But Mulligans may need Yeah. Mul what

0 (2h 58m 50s):
Happened? Yeah, we'll, we'll figure

5 (2h 58m 52s):
It out.

0 (2h 58m 54s):
Okay.

6 (2h 58m 54s):
If I got the number you'll switch.

5 (2h 58m 57s):
Wow.

4 (2h 58m 59s):
If. you get the number.

0 (2h 59m 0s):
I think it should be, if anyone gets the number they have to switch.

4 (2h 59m 3s):
If you, If you get the number. Hank we'll switch and I'll do the nine daughter.

0 (2h 59m 11s):
No, I think it should be, if anyone gets the number, they have to do it with Hank. If I

4 (2h 59m 14s):
Get the number, I'm

0 (2h 59m 15s):
Not gonna get it till

4 (2h 59m 16s):
I'm in. If I get it, I'll also do my punishment.

6 (2h 59m 21s):
Okay.

0 (2h 59m 22s):
If I get the number, I'll do the nine Darter with you. Alright. Yeah. 56.

4 (2h 59m 27s):
Eight

0 (2h 59m 28s):
Three.
