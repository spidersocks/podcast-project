And boys, we've got it. The tournament has arrived. We're gonna do a little choose your own adventure. We are taping this in the afternoon. I bet. San Diego State. So it'll be a very sad boy if they lost by more than four and a half. But it does feel like you and C is the team now. Yeah. We've had four days of just hearing that they don't belong. You don't belong. You don't belong. They probably don't belong. Yeah. The West Virginia governor even did a press conference. The National Corrupt Association of Athletics. Yeah. Had a big sign. It was a big story for what we said. 24 hours. You get 24 hours to basically bitch about it. And then everyone, as soon as the ball is tipped, everyone's like, okay, we wanna watch the game now.


The ball. He went on The ack, he went on the ack. He did, What did he say on the ak? Not a whole lot. He basically was like, yeah, I know this isn't gonna do anything, but we have to fight for ourselves. We, he came on because Nick, our, our good friends, Nick and KB are both West Virginia natives. Nick is a West Virginia fan. And he, he, he gave the right answer in the fact that he said, we're like, dude, you're not actually gonna get into the tournament by suing. He's like, yeah, of course not. But you gotta He basically working ref Constitutes He's also work. He's working a ref. Constituents. Yeah. N Next year, if they're on the bubble, that's The right, that's the right coverage. Right. They might, they might give 'em a little friendly bump. This is the best thing that can ever happen to a politician.


Right. 'cause it gives you something where you can take everybody under your wing and be like, I got your back as your leader meatball. Ron did this with Florida State. Yep. And then got awful quiet about it when Florida State got their ass kicked in that bowl game. That's true. But it's a good opportunity. Like if you're a politician, you know, every crisis needs a leader. It's a great opportunity for leaders step up and to have everybody support them. So I guess congratulations to the governor. Yeah. Bub Cunningham is also like maybe the most corrupt person's name of All time. So my idea is that we need to change. He, he doesn't deserve to be Bubba. A bubba is a guy you want to be friends With. Mm. Yeah. But also, but Also someone that's corrupt. A Bubba drama. A bubba is someone you hit up to get out of a, a tough Situation. Bubba's walked into a lot of meetings where the other guy brings a briefcase in, of course.


And, and then doesn't take that briefcase with him on the way out. I think though, we should call his real name is Lawrence. I think we should call him Larry. Larry Cunningham. Strip him of the bubba. How About Liam? You could call him Liam. Liam Cunningham. Yeah. I just feel like that's a bubba move. It is To take bribes, But but also like being a bubba. That's kind of a point of pride. You know, you, you, when you're a Bubba, that's cool to be like, Hey, I'm Bubba. So we should take that away from him and be like, no dude. You're Lawrence. Yeah. I don't know. You're Lawrence Cunningham. You're a complete noname. Lawrence cu you remember your Bubbas. I feel like this is, this is on the, whoever the committee is, the NCAA for putting Bubba in charge of everything. You don't put a bubba in the position of leadership. You put Bub Bubba brings the beers.


Well, It's also copied by where they're like, we're UNC will never be on the bubble. Right. And and Oh yeah. We get a hundred thousand dollars if we make the tournament. That's not a conflict of interest or anything. It's bullshit. I think he gets like anywhere between 40 and 60 grand. And the reason why they do it, they say, is because if you make the tournament, then the ad has to work overtime. Yeah. So he deserves to be compensated for that. Yeah. So UNC probably will win. And we will, they'll probably go to the Sweet 16 and everyone will be like, yo, you didn't think they should be in the tournament? And then Alabama State won. Yeah, Sure. I'm just guessing. Yeah. Alabama State, St. Francis. I was looking, I did research into these teams earlier. Yeah. So I've got fun facts about 'em. As fun as they can get about Alabama State and St.


Francis. But yeah. Who they're gonna lose. Yeah. I, I, I don't know who it was. I saw it on x the everything app. So apologies if this was you, but I, I like the take that the playing game should be bubble teams and not agreed. Like it shouldn't be 16 seeds. Yeah. We've, what's The point? We've been saying that on, on this year program. Yeah. That was with John Rothstein on Sunday night. Thanks for subscribing, please unsubscribe and resubscribe. You're welcome. It would be better if it was just the bubble teams that had to play for the right to get in and then give the, give the 16 teams their opportunity to get their ass kicked by the one Seats. Now the only counterpoint to that, our good friend Tom Ferelli did text me after listening to Pardon My Take on Sunday. Something Hank, I guess doesn't do. But he pointed out that they do get a bonus for winning a tournament game.


So, so if they win the plan. Yeah. So if you ask the 16 c do you want a 50 50 chance at a a bonus or a one in a billion chance, I think they'd probably take the 50 50 chance. And for, you know, the kids and the coach to get a NCAA tournament win on your resume is a pretty big deal. So I They might, they might be fine with it. Do they not get a bonus if they just play in the tournament? No, I don't think so. I, they, they might, but they get an additional bonus for every win. Also, I, I appreciate the pageantry and, and the tradition. That is Dayton, Ohio. Yeah. It's fun. It's where we started off. Listen, I I, I want another playing game on Monday night because I, last night, I don't know about you guys, but I was lost. I Do think it's interesting though, and John brought this up, Hank, so if you see it online, it's probably from him.


Yeah. That San Diego State, North Carolina. Both teams that have played in the NCAA championship game in the last five years. Interesting. Fun Fact. It's a fun fact. Really, really very, very fun fact. Should we get to our fun facts? Yeah. Yeah. Let's fucking do it. So we split up the regions. We all took a region. PFTI think you're up first. 'cause you have Auburn's region, right? I do. Alright, So Auburn and PFT, the south One seed. Yeah. The South. Yep. So Auburn is the one seed outta that, outta that division. They are the tigers. We know them as the Auburn Tigers. Yep. But they also chant War Eagle. Do you know why they chant War Eagle? No. So the tradition goes back to 1892.


There was a football game going on. It was Auburn against Georgia. And there was a Civil War veteran in the stands who had a pet eagle that he found during a battle in the Civil War. Don't ask what side he was on. Okay. But he had his pet eagle in the stands. Then the eagle took off, started a circle in the sky as Auburn came back and drove for the win. I love that. Against Georgia. And the crowd started chanting war eagle, war eagle plot twist. Then the eagle just turned straight downwards from the sky. Flew into the field and killed itself. Oh. Kamikaze. Kamikaze. War eagle. That's an awesome story. I didn't know That the eagle might have been woke because he was like, I'd rather die than go back to my confederate soldier boss.


Yeah. So we don't know what happened there, but yeah. That's why they call it War Eagle. Okay. I Like that. I've been to Auburn, saw one of the coolest college football traditions that I've seen. Yeah. The war Eagle flying. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. That. Now if we saw that today, we would say that's a bad omen for Auburn. If the eagle just decided to unlive itself. Yeah. It's like that Central Park Pigeon or whatever. Oh, are you talking about Flaco? Flaco the Yeah, but he was a slut, remember? Yeah. He was a slut. He was fucking everything. He had Herpes al herpes. He also might have been taken out. Yeah. I didn't have eyeballs on Hillary at the time. Okay. That's a, that was a great start. I had no idea about. Is it a fun fact? Well, I didn't know what war, I knew they said War Eagle, but I never looked it Up.


Yeah, it's a fun fact. Okay. And they're playing And they're playing against either Alabama state or St. Francis of Pennsylvania. So Alabama State Hornets notable alumni, two chains. Oh. Also notable alumni. Oh, didn't he play? I think he might have played college basketball there. He might have played ball there. And also Clarence Carter, he sang that song Stroking. Mm. When I start making love, I don't just make love Stroke, I be stroking. There We go. That's, that is a, that is a great, that's a super fun fact. Yeah, that's a great song. It's a banger, isn't it? That is A very fun song. Maybe The best like dynamic duo if you're putting together an NBA jam team. Yeah. Of two musicians that went to any of these schools. Two chains and Clarence Carter are pretty good like That. Clarence Carter. Clarence Carter.


They're always in the first four. Oh shoot. And they've never won a first four game. Okay. And then the red flash. Here's my fun fact about the Red Flash. St. Francis coach Rob Crim has a lifetime record of 171 and 227. Oh wow. So he is been coaching there for a long time. They haven't won a lot of games. Good job. Just keep staying out there and trying. He's Elite at keeping his job. Two chains did play two seasons at Alabama State. Wow. Oh, you think he's gonna be there? Gotta be. He's gotta be titty Boy. He's got titty boy's gotta be there. He's gotta Hank You're adding some nice fun facts to p to his list here. Hey, I, I wanna say, And we should have started the show with welcome back. Hey.

It was your, your nose bleeding and being like, what the hell's going on? But yeah, it's good. Good to have you back. Okay. Next Game. Next game. Louisville Creighton. Mm. Louisville v Creighton. We've got bird nugget. Bird nugget of the week. Ooh. 'cause it's the cardinals against the blue Jays Hit The noise. Hank go. Okay. That was good. That was good. A blue Jay would kick a cardinal's ass in a fight. Even though the Louisville cardinal has teeth, blue Jays are, are much bigger. They're super, super aggressive. Also per stat hole sports. Rain Smith is the best free throw shooter in the country for Louisville.


Ooh. So keep your eye on that. Wait, His name's Rain. R-E-Y-N-E. I believe that's rain smith. But That's still making it rain. Making It rain. Pretty good. Creighton. Fun fact. The Toronto Blue Jays sued Creighton in 2014 over the redesign of the Blue Jay logo. And after three years of litigation it got thrown out because Creighton's name predates the Toronto Blue Jay's name. And also the judge ruled that the Toronto Blue Jay's logo was not famous enough to be infringed upon. Ouch. Yeah. That's brutal. I had to go wild. Yeah. I Went, I went balls deep in reading actual court documents to figure that one out also. Oh, I did so much more reading than I've ever done today. Yeah. Creighton Blue Jays. Blue Jays is one word. It's not two.


So if you see somebody put a space in between Blue and Jays in March, they're casual. What about BJ's? BJ's You can see. Can you do the shirt? I love BJ's. I I hear BJ's. Yeah. Blue Js translates to edging Blue Jays Translates to Eding ing Blue ball. No. PJ Blue Ball. What does the J stand For? Are you saying BLEW Like Bj, but, but you have blue balls. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All bad head and Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Got it. Welcome back, Hank. Yeah. Too much teeth. Alright. Which the cardinals Have like the Louisville Cardinal. Yeah. There we go. Full circle. Next match up we got Michigan and uc. San Diego, Michigan, dusty may literally translates to pollen Season 10 and oh.


In games. Decide by 10 points or less this year For Michigan. They've been very good in those tight games. And 10 of their last 12 wins have been decided by four points or fewer. So play close games. Yep. Uc, San Diego, they have the fewest turnovers in the entire country and they live in heaven. They live in San Diego. So who cares if they lose, honestly. Yeah. Go back to your vacation. Yeah. You probably don't even like sports. Sports is for people who don't have to deal with winter. Right. You don't deserve to. You See San Diego, you just, you just hang out all Day. Also, uc, San Diego, during every finals week, they have a primal scream at exactly 10:00 PM that goes 10:00 PM to 10 0 5. Where all their students can just scream as loud as they want out their window in their dorm.


Wherever the campus just erupts with people screaming. 'cause they're frustrated Like Covid. Yeah, I was gonna say, it's like the Covid, we're we're right in the zone where everyone's doing the five year anniversaries. And I cringe at every single thing I see. Where it's like, you know, videos of people dancing in the streets socially distanced. I was walking To the grocery store during that. It was pretty cool. I felt like I was in a parade. Yeah. In New York. I can kind of see it. 'cause in New York, the hospitals were bad. A lot of people died. Right. Right off the bat. But yeah, there's, I don't wanna remember anything from that game. No, I don't either. It just, it bums me out when I see it. It was a bad year. Yeah. All right. So that's that game next. Oh, Like bad. Like month and a half for us. We went back to work pretty Quickly. We did, yeah.


Got back to work. Texas a and m against Yale is the next one. Fun fact about this one, you could make the case that alumni from Yale have gotten more alumni from their opponents killed than any other matchup in the history of March Madness. Oh, CIA stuff All the, well, all the war criminals that Yeah. That went to Yale. And then Texas a and m has like the highest percentage of military graduates. Mm. So when you look at it, famous alumni from Yale, George. Well, what, what were you say Hank? No, I think, I think you're about to explain. Okay. George W. Bush, John Ashcroft, Prescott Bush, some Nazi ties there. Dick Cheney, bill and Hillary Clinton.


All Yale graduates went to Yale. And then a and m has the highest amount of medal of honor winners of any school in the entire what? An army. Any Oh, non-military School. Non-military school. Yeah. Yeah. Also Texas a and m, not a cult. That's my fun fact. They're not a cult. They're very clear about that. Revel the dog. They're mascot is considered a cadet general. And the highest ranking member in the Corps of Cadets at a and m freshmen are required to address her as Miss Rev. Ma'am, it's a held tradition that if Revely decides to sleep on a cadet's bed, the cadet has to sleep on the floor. Ly has her own cell phone who's operated by the mascot corporal. And she has her own student identification card.


Not a cult. Not a cult. They wear the rings too. Yeah. Everywhere. I got some ring facts for You later. The Aggie rings. Yeah. From a and m. Yeah. Are just, it's, it's a lot. Also fun fact about Yale. Yale played in the very first five on five collegiate basketball game. Oh wow. Who played in the first four and four? I don't know. I don't know what happened before that. Shit. I have, I ha I have that same stat for a different team. Oh, did they play against each each other Compet fun facts. I did not. What? What team? Well, it is spoilers. Okay. We'll get to it. Yeah. All right. You can't spoil the fun facts. Yeah. Can't spoil the fun facts. You're right. I've said too much about class rings. Alright, next up we have Ole Miss against UNC or San Diego State.


There was, I think it was Doyle, who was it on CBS. One of them said that Ole Miss gets a lot of love because they played it in great conference. They had a lot of opportunities. But eyeball test, they're fraud. Ooh. They've been called out as being frauds. The eyeball test seems like a personal shot at notable alumni. Ben Minz, but I don't know. Chris Beard is their coach. Chris Beard is the coach. Coach. He's a very, very good basketball coach. Yes. That's My fun fact. Way better basketball coach than person. I already built up my UNC San Diego State fun fact. Which is what John Rothstein told us that these two teams both played in the national championship game. Love that. In the last five years, Iowa State. Okay. Iowa State. This is a fun fact. I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't.


There is a Reddit user who goes by the name of Zel Berger's Polos Very tight, Put together a spreadsheet of the winningest and losing polos that he wears. Wow. Pretty good, right? Like I, this is Why the, this is stuff you need. This is stuff you need for your bracket. This is why the internet was invented for this guy to figure this out. So the best polo shirts that he wears are the dark red stripes or the, the red polo shirt with the dark red stripes on the front, and then the red polo shirt with a single yellow stripe. The worst that he has is the plain gray. He's really bad in plain gray. And he has never worn a polo.


That's, you know, the, the extra medium size that has yellow as the primary color, even though that is their, one of their primary colors at Iowa State. Okay. So keep your eye on what Berger wears for his polo shirts. Very Important. Lipscomb Lipscomb has five guys who are shooting 33% or more from three. Iowa State is 130 fifth and three point defense. Okay. Fun fact. Yes. Lipscomb. What does Lipscomb mean? Hank Teeth. I was gonna say mustache, but Okay. But you're thinking about teeth a lot. Yeah. Something going on. No, I'm just Is that when you dream about your teeth falling out, you're infertile. It, it's That you didn't say something that you should have said, or you said something that you shouldn't have.


Got It. Marquette. Marquette. Marquette, New Mexico. Marquette, the term the big dance was first coined by Marquette. Coach Al McGuire who said that he would wear a blue blazer because he's going to the big dance. Mm. It's the first time anyone said it. Love that. And they won the title that year. Sha Smart, their coach has a 26 page document about culture that he sends to every single recruit and manifesto manifest. Well, it's a manifesto af if you killed somebody. Okay. But it's borderline manifesto. It's Borderline, it's call it a Handbook. A handbook. But a culture document that's a manifesto. I think that's a coaching thing. That might be a manifesto. I Think if, if you send it to somebody for publicity, it's a manifesto.


I'd like to get my hands on that too. And we can, we can judge if that's a manifesto or Not. Yeah. 26 pages. That's, that's a lot. That's a lot of pages. It's like, Yeah. But if you, they send it and then it's like, if, if, if you don't wanna handle this, don't come. If you have to like click and download. That's a manifesto. I, I like that move. Okay. I think manifestos, they typically have to be uncovered too. Like somebody finds a manifesto. Why don't you do that as a project? A culture manifesto. Manifesto for, Pardon? My Take. Okay. That'd be nice. Yeah. It'll be one Page. Great. Good. Then it won't be a manifesto. It's at that point it's an executive summary. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. It's a table of contents is what you're doing. They, Marquette has lost every tournament team in conference twice, except for Xavier whom they beat twice.


Okay. New Mexico. Richard Pitino is our head coach. Yes. Fun fact. And my other fun fact is we should change the name to New America. Oh. Instead of New Mexico. I like that. That's my only fun fact there. Okay. Michigan State, they have the longest streak in the country in terms of consecutive tournament appearances with 27 next year, they would tie the all time record. So 28 would be the record that Kansas had. Kansas does not, it's not an active streak for Kansas. Got it. Any longer. So yeah. Tom Izzo, January, February, Izzo izo, April. Although he should want, we wanted to be January, February, March. Izzo Izzo would be better because that's when they play the championship game and they play against Bryant.


My fun fact about Bryant is their coach is Phil Marelli Jr. Son of legendary St. Joe's coach. Phil Marelli Senior. Yeah. Also, I believe this is true. Richard Pitino back to New Mexico. I think he's the only coach in this tournament that at some point has lived in another coach's balls. That's also in this tournament. That's Also in this tournament. Yes. Because Phil Marelli Jr. Lived, lived in Phil Marelli senior's Balls. Yeah. That, that makes sense. Okay. Who's up next? That was great. PFT. Thank you. Who do you have coming outta this region? The funnest fact outta this region? If I'm, no, who do you have coming outta this region? Oh, I've got Michigan State coming outta this region. Okay. I got Michigan State against Auburn.


Okay. Hank, are you up next? I think so. Duke, Florida. Oh, max, you're up next. Jesus Christ scared me. Duke. Duke. We're going to the east. We're going across and then, okay. Yeah. I thought, thought, thought we were gonna go to Hank too. Clock. That's Okay. Okay. We can, we can. No, no, I'm good. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to Go. I'm ready to Go. Who's more ready to go? Me? I'm, he said that faster. I've already, I've already told you guys this fun fact. I don't know if I told all four of you. We're starting with Duke and my friend's sister is John Shire's assistant at Duke. Yes. That's pretty cool. So that's, So how close a friends, We played baseball together in college. Do you keep up?


He was in Chicago last year. We got dinner. Okay. So, so fairly like Yeah. You could get us John Shire on the show. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Love that. I could get it. I could. Yes. I'll, I will say yes. Okay. That is very fun. Fact. Fun fact. Fun Fact. What does John Shire translate to Hank? Oh, I got one. What? No, I'm waiting for Hank Bill. Bo's son. I don't know who Billbo is. Billbo Baggins Shire. I don't know. Okay. Is that it? What do you, what do you got? PFTI was just gonna say Sirius XM 2015 bathroom.


Mm. There we go. Bathroom. Because he couldn't piss. You couldn't Piss. Got it. What, What? Yeah, you're on another level then. Wait, what is that? What are you referring to? I, I mean, I've, I've brought it up with Ed Sheeran. I don't think you have. In 2015, I was at the SiriusXM studio and I went to the bathroom. He came in with me and Ed Sheeran goes to the urinal next to me and I start to piss. I'm letting it rip. I'm just pissing like a race horse. Okay. Like letting out gallons. It's a, it's a fire hose. It's like a super Soaker. And then Ed Sheeran's trying to piss and he can't piss. What? And yeah, he's just standing there like, you know, he's shorter than me too, which is crazy. So he's trying to piss, he's intimidated by my strong stream. And then he does the fake flush. Like he pissed. But him and I both know he didn't piss. And then he gets out, washes his hands and leaves.


He went in there to pee. He didn't pee 'cause he got scared. Holy shit. How do you not tell us that story? I don't know. That's crazy. He got scared. Alright, max, back to you. So Duke plays the winner of American or St. Mary's. I have some facts about both of them. Okay, great. The, the American fun fact is, is another personal fact. Okay. In 2009, I hope they're All personal facts. In 2009, they were beating Villanova by 13 at halftime in the first round as a 14 seat against a three. And I vividly remember where I was at that moment and thinking that I wanted J Wright fired in that moment. And then they ended Up How old were You? Two th I was 14.


Okay. I love that. I Love that. 13. I was 13. Yeah. So like, this is why we shouldn't listen to you. You're gonna want every coach fired at some point. Yeah. Yeah. No, I wanted him fired. But then Villanova ended up winning that game by 12. Okay. Nice. I also did something. I started to do something and then I felt like it was mean. I started to do a best player and a worst player from each team. Okay. Okay. I, I don't have to continue with, I don't have to. No. Give us one. I I, okay. American. Matt Rogers best player. 17 points 55%, shooting 40% from three. Pretty good numbers. Worst player. No disrespect to Jeff Sprouse. Jeff Sprouse is definitely an a WL.


He's definitely Listening to us right now. Trying to take his mind off, off the play. Match the guard. Jeff Sprouse from American Plays 23 minutes a game. I didn't want to pick the walk-ons who like never play. He has six points a game, but he is the guard who shoots 33% from the field and 50% from the line. Oh. Just not great numbers. S and Jeffs get those Numbers off. What are the assist numbers like there? Max, I, what's his game like? This is what I Yeah. He might be like a John Stockton. This is the notes that I have. Okay. I don't have the assist numbers on here. Okay. Okay. St Mary's, this kind of got away from me too. You're on your third team Max.


I know, But okay. D two, D two wagon 1962 national champions in the D two five time final five final fours in the D two. Okay. And then I started thinking about St. Mary's. I'm like, I'm pretty sure they have a really small court. And then I looked it up, I'm like, oh yeah, they have a small court. But then it made me think like, is that the smallest court? Wait, the, the court's not regulation size? No, like stadium. Small stadium. Okay. Like high school looking Stadium. Small barn. Yeah. So they have 3000 people in their, like they can see 3000 people in their stadium. And I was like, that's pretty small. I wonder what the smallest is. South Carolina. Upstate. Their stadium seats 800 people in it. Whoa. Like I think I look, I'm, I'm gonna show you a picture of it right now.


Oh, I wanna see this. I think If, if like, we could get more people in our office basketball gym than this, than this team can. I love these small gyms. Yeah. So it kind of got away from me and I started to look, This is why this one, this Ended up being a South Carolina upstate fact. Look how small this gym is. That's really small. Look how small this gym is. That's like a high school gym. Yeah. This is why this tournament is so great though, because it's, it's these type of teams. I know South Carolina upstate's not in it, but It could be. It's why I love this tournament. It's why it's, it's analogous to the, what do they call it? Fa cup. Fa cup, yeah. Where it's like, you know, A-Y-M-C-A is playing against Man.

Also Caleb Love, I think he's been on the team for 40 years. Well, in college basketball for 40 years. He was on North Carolina. Yeah, yeah. In college, whatever.


You know what I mean? Yeah. This is the worst fun fact that I found of the day. I was looking up every team's fun facts and then I found this and it, and it pissed me off. So I had to tell you, Akron is really excited about this, this matchup because he really likes coffee and the game is being played in Seattle. Mm. That was a fun fact that I found. Who, Who really likes coffee? The coach really likes Coffee. John Gross. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And he was excited because Seattle is known for their coffee. Got It. He can't get Coffee in Akron anywhere else. No. Yeah. Yeah. So he's really excited to go to Seattle for their coffee. That's, that's the fun fact that I found from Akron. Okay. And that pissed you off. Well, I wanna say right now, John Gross, if you guys hit the over in this game, I will send you coffee from blue coffee.com.


Love it. I like the over in this game. Okay. Okay. BYU memes is a BYU lever because they play super fast and he likes teams that play super fast. And they also have like the most NIL in the entire country. Hmm. Yes. They're, they have the number one recruit coming in next year and they've given them $7 million. And I did not know BYU had had, had NIL money like that. Yeah. I also read another article. They got stupid money. Yeah. I, I don't know where that money's coming from. Where, how do, why do the Mormons have all the money, but whatever, 10%, you gotta kick it up to the boss. Also, I read an article that they may have that someone predicted Richie Saunders would be the, the, the, the name of March Madness.


So that's a guy on their team that apparently is getting a lot of hype. Okay. Okay. What was that, what was that documentary you told me to watch Max about the Oh yeah. The influencer family was the mom influencer. Oh, Frank. Fuck. Ruby. Ruby Frank. Ruby Frank Frank. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. And then her crazy, her weird husband who I think is just as in on it as she was.

And they will be playing VVCU, who they're head coach is. This will be his, this will be his last time at VCU no matter what I am. That's my, my, my Prediction. This isn't a fact.


No, no, no. I'm telling you this as, as, Oh, My thoughts is that this guy will not be coaching VVCU after this. Is this, are you reporting? I'm reporting this. You're Reporting this That he's going to be Bill Nova head coach Or Virginia? It's most likely Virginia. Okay. It's looking like, because I want him to be the Villanova head coach, but it's looking like he's going to Virginia. So he'll either be going to Vil, Villanova or Virginia after this year. He will, this is his last ride with VCU and what's His name? His name's Ryan Odom. Yes. They also have a player, max Olga who transferred, who said he was transferring to Villanova and then said he wasn't transferring to Villanova and went back to school. I love these fun facts. These are great fun facts.


Okay. Okay. Wisconsin, Montana. Another terrible fun fact that I found that I'm going, that I'm going to share Montana's forward Amari Jenkins and Wisconsin Guard, Kamari McGee are both from racing Wisconsin. Yeah. And they both started at co their college at Green Bay. However, they did not attend the same high school and they weren't at Green Bay at the same time. So it's basically a nothing fact. Okay. That's a nothing Fact. I was, IIII was starting to read. I was like, oh, this could be good, this could be good. And then by the end of it, I was like, why even include this in anything? They, they both know the same Restaurants. They know of each other. They, they like have have been in one area at the same time.


Okay. That pissed me off. Maybe one had the old guy's Old Locker. Yep. Yeah. Well, no. Yeah. I guess at Green Bay. Yeah. Another thing that I found about Wisconsin is that every single article about Wisconsin basketball, the headline is just the coach is not complaining about quick turnaround to Thursday. Love that. Which makes, but it makes me think that no, we're not. He should Be. He no complaining. Might be complaining. No complaining. But everything is just about not complaining. Can't Complain. You haven't complained once. No. About gonna Denver. Nope. The best, the best player also was named the second team. All American today. Yes. John Jaji Ji. He's great. And last thing, not good for Big Cat, Montana has the best name.


The best name in the draft in the, in the tournament. The Grizzlies Money Williams is a guy for What about Danger? Danger, Montana. That's a good name. Yeah. But Mu Money Williams. Very good. Yes. Sounds like a guy who's going to be That's a very Good one star In March. Mads. Yeah. Any fun facts about Wisconsin and Villanova going up against each other in the tournament? Wisconsin once beat Villanova as an eight seed, Or 8, 8, 9 them from a Threepeat. Yeah. Nigel. We were an eight Hayes. Nigel Hayes decided to be, you know, the One year in between their Villanova's championship. Wisconsin's been really good recently. Max, do you know the last team to beat Wisconsin in the NCAA tournament? JMU? Yes. Yeah. It was a JMU Davis.


I also have a fun fact about that game. I was, I was watching that game at my friend's house at Delaware and he had friends that were coming over that apparently had to leave because I was, he was like, I couldn't watch a game with That guy. That's fair. Because he was freaking out so much. Yeah. But you guys were defending champions. I was Pissed And, and yeah. I mean, you won, you won titles on either side, so it's not really a Big deal. Yeah, it's okay. But at the time I was pissed. Yeah. Okay. I like, I like Wisconsin in that game. Okay, now we're on to St. Mary's v Vandy. Oh, this is actually a pretty fun fact. Well, first off, notable alumni St. Mary's. PFD Deli. PFD Deli. There you go.


Fun fact. Their name is the St. Mary's Gale's. And their name was given to them by a sports writer in the 20 who nicknamed them that because they had so many Irish guys on the team. Oh. Oh. So that's where they got the St. Mary's gay's. Australians are just, they're Irish criminals. Yeah. And now they're, now they're just importing from the opposite side, I guess. So good way to look at it. Okay. And now we have a, a contradictory fact from PFT from earlier. Oh. But I think I understand where the Contradiction Came, came from. The contradiction comes from Vanderbilt is the first team to First college to participate in a basketball game. Mm. And that was a nine to six victory over Nashville.


YMCA. Oh, okay. So I think maybe yours is the first to play another college. Yeah. And this is the first college to play. Got it. Okay. Was yours a five on five game? I don't know. All it says is Mine was five. Five. Yeah. In 1893, Vanderbilt beat Nashville. YMCA nine to six in the first college to participate, whatever. Okay. Okay. This is my last game. Alabama v Robert Morris. I have some bad stats about Alabama murder, but I thought that I would phone a friend to, you know, maybe. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. See if he could say, save those facts from being said. Yes. I like that.


That's a good idea. So, So let's, let's phone this friend. Let's see if he answers. I mean, he should, He's probably on the phone with somebody else though. He Probably is. Yeah. He's got, he's got, he's Got Rol. What's up Rico? Thank you for answering the phone. Tell he's live. You are live to tape on part of my take. Okay. Do you have any fun facts about this Alabama Robert Morris game so Much? Yeah, we went to the Final four last year. We're 11 deep. Got a great coach, great fan base friends of the program. So that why, what's up? I I just wanna know if there's, if you have any fun facts about Alabama's basketball program. Yeah. I mean, they came outta nowhere. They were never good my entire life.


And now host five street high seats. Something that's never been done before. I, I was personally going to say that their coach may being involved in a murder allegation. You guys, You're supposed to be an incredible news source. Why don't I just say that you double teamed three fat girls at the ball last week. You Know what I mean? I, I called you. I called you because I, I wanted Wait. Is that true Max? I wanted No, it is not true. Oh, How do you double team three? Wait, I, it sounds like he's, he's at ho I got you a Number two.

Just tell him to let the kids have the Reeses He hung he hung out or he hung out. Hung. All right. The kids have the Reese's. Oh, he might have more followers. He does. Max has 144,000. All right. Rico has 180. So credit to Rico. Credit To Rico. Credit to Rico also. He had that off the top of his zone pretty quickly. By The way, there's a rumor going around that Rico and Max are dating What they left together on Friday night. Well, They were hanging out Next week. That's actually incorrect. They're sitting right next to each other on the couch. I saw you Double team. This is actually incorrect. I actually have video evidence of us not leaving because we were going to go to the bar together and then wait.


You some assistant coach hit him up and asked him to go to a different bar and he was like, oh, I gotta go Here. And you have video evidence. I have video of evidence of him on the phone with this other Oh, that doesn't prove that you didn't leave with him, I guess technically that's true. Yeah. But I, I have him on the, sounds like You guys did make, in fact, make plans for a date. Sounds like you guys might be dating. Yeah. Okay. I wanted, I wanted, I wanted to go on a date with him.

Yeah. His kids were right there. I had nothing to do with any fat girls. They were just happy that they could eat the Reese's out because that's stolen. But no disrespect to fat girls. No. No disrespect. All right. Hank, Hank, you're up. Wait, was there a Robert Morris back in there? I, I thought maybe he would have something about Robert Morris. Oh, okay. All right. To me, Robert Morris just sounds like a cigarette company. I do have a fun fact, but that this is via stat hole sports, is that they have the most losses of all time without a win in the NCA tournament. Oh, Robert Morris. So they oh one eight. Oh, Okay. Hank. Alright, here We go. South region first fun fact actually comes from PMT alumni. This is not the south region. Yeah. West region. Already off West region.

Number one seeds in this year's NCAA tournament are led by Jewish head coaches. Bruce Pearl, John Shire, Todd Golden of Florida. Mazel to on a great season so far. Wow. Fun fact. That Is fun. Fact, fun Fact, also, Love you Jake. Yeah. Love you, Jake. Are All your fun facts and be ripped from other people. No, that was just the, oh, I guess it's not great timing that the first one was, but the rest are all made. Because you Could see how we'd think like, oh, well we all did hours of research. No, I did. I did a lot of research. That was just that I liked, I liked that. That was fun. That was fun. Fun. Jake? I did just call Rico, but that's Fine. No, that's all. Yeah. That was fun. Norfolk State, there's a few fun facts here.


Okay. One, each of their previous games by one point, so they're, if it gets close, they know what to do. That Was the intentional foul game. Did you see how that game No, they, so they tied, I can't remember who they were playing. It might have been, it might like North Carolina upstate or So one of those schools, their opponent scored, got the ball in a press scored to tie it 10 seconds left. And then they intentionally fouled because he just like didn't have time and space. That's how they ended up in the tournament. JR. R Smith. Yeah. Their, one of their most notable alums. Also recurring guests on the show. Maybe smooth. Oh, Oh Yeah. People Forget. And then this is multiple, Multiple recurring Guests.


This is the win horse. This one doesn't make sense to me. I feel like maybe I'm still brain fried. And big Cat's gonna have an obvious reason for why this is. All the other 16 seeds are 101, a hundred to one to make the sweet 16 on DraftKings. Norfolk is 20 to one. Yeah. Well, at least two of them haven't won yet. Right, Right. Okay. And Then the last one, The last one would be, Oh no. Yeah. Who's the last one? SIUE. Yeah. SIU Edwardsville. What is their, what are their, oh, I, I do have the reason they're an Illinois school, So you can't, ah, There, it's, I knew, I knew there.


It's, it didn't, as I was looking at it, it made no sense. It's like, do what, what is, what does Vegas know? Yeah. And, and that's the answer. The other, the other Two have to play in the play. The other, the other four have to play in the playing. And the last one would be 20 to one. But they're an Illinois school. You can't pay Illinois schools in Illinois. So 20 to one. Can you bet the opposite side of that? I wish That's a good investment. Yeah. Okay. Oh no, it's 200. No. What, what is it? It's two 2001. Yeah. Wait, what Saying Norfolk State is Not a hundred to one. Wait. This was also this, I swear to God they changed this in the last hour. Me and Spider were on this earlier. Me and Spider were looking at this order. That's What happens when he doesn't get it from somebody Else. Didn't make sense. Okay. Okay.


Moving on. Because I like, well, that was an excellent one. The opposite of 20 to one for Norfolk State to make. That's The easiest Bet. That's a great bet. Yukon. Yeah. Trying to be the first team to Threepeat. Since UCLA in 1969, they were led by Lal Cinder, a gallon of gas in 1969. Cost 35 cents. That Is a fun task. That's good. And the number one song at the time was Dizzy by Tommy Rowe. Mm. Give us a couple bars of Dizzy, I don't know, dizzy Dizzy. Dizzy. Well not make love, I'd be stroking. And then Oklahoma, this is just some player fun facts. Bryson Goodine is from New Bedford. I that's, that's in mass.


That was, that was a fun fact to me. Okay. And then their, one of their top players, Jeremiah Fierce, is from a local guy. Joliet. Okay. Juliet. Yeah. He said it perfectly. Brother Of Michigan State. Fierce. Yeah. Assists Machine. Another fun fact, Memphis, I am choosing to believe this because it is crazy. I dunno if you guys seen the Memphis, Louisville people are saying that. Yeah. The committee, they Accidentally swapped, accidentally swapped him. Yes. Louisville has a better net. RPI, Ken Palm H lock and higher in the E-S-P-N-B-P-I rankings in every category. Yes.


But Memphis is the higher seated team. Yes. I choose to believe that too. I do as well. Because it makes no sense other than they just accidentally mess it up and they just have to live with it. That's how I choose to believe that they put Wisconsin Endeavor, not making excuses for it, where they're like, whoops. We meant to put 'em in Milwaukee. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot. They Just like mixed up a couple Things over. Yeah, they're moving around A lot of things, things, things get lost in the sh Purdue And Michigan should have been flipped. And then they're playing Colorado State. Who campus is on a 5,011 foot elevation, which is the fifth highest in the country. Oh, and the the highest Or New Mexico, uc. Air Force and Wyoming are higher. Okay. Maryland. Yep.


Interesting. I am inter, I couldn't find the reason why, because Maryland's the biggest crab exporter in the country. They're all about the crabs. I was curious why, you know, the crab five, why aren't they the terrapins and not the crabs? Why are they the turtle? Why are they the turtle, not the crabs? Yeah. I, I don't know the answer to That. I feel like crabs just aren't a great mascot. I disagree. No, in terms of like, There's a turtle though, Right? Well, but a turtle's stronger than a crab. The turtle, you can, you can't like crabs, you just fucking put a little trap out and then you just eat 'em. I think it has something Turtles can at least defend themselves. I think it has something to do with the flag. I think they wanted the flag to be the start of the show.


And so they wanted like a, a less angular cool mascots. They went with the terrapin. And the reason that Maryland blue crabs are, are so elite is because they hibernate in the Chesapeake Bay during the winter, which allows them the luxury of building additional fat reserves that have distinct look and taste. Delicious. Put some old bay on there. They are going up against Grand Canyon, which fun fact is not the deepest canyon in the world. Did you also know? Fun fact, it would take us the entire population of the world. 800 years to fill up the Grand Pan Canyon with piss. I did see that video. 800 Years. Yeah. If we were all just continuously pissing.

I can't imagine the first person who discovered it. They're just like walking through the woods and they're like, holy fuck. Yeah. Where's Grand Canyon University? Hank Nevada? Mm, no. Arizona. Yeah. Yeah. It's in Phoenix. It's also for profit.


You can, I believe you can buy stock in Grand Canyon University. Oh, we should? Yeah. Or short it. That would be nice. I would not be buying stock. I like Maryland in this game. Okay.

Is it It's like the thing in your suits I think or something.


Yeah, it's like the little tiny thing. Oh, the, the tiny hair clips. Yeah. Yeah. That's a fun fact. That is a fun fact. And then Coach Cal's kind of Weirdo. Yeah. That is weird. Yeah. Notable pro golf alums. Gary Woodland went to Kansas. He has six pro wins. One major John Daley went to Arkansas. He has 19 pro wins and two Majors. It would've been funny if you just did all golf facts. Yeah. And then You got one more game. I do. Where are my notes? St. John's in Omaha. Omaha was just an indicator word. Manning explained. It was a trigger word that meant to, you changed the play. There was low time on the clock and the ball needed to be snapped.


Right. Now kind of let my offensive lineman know that, hey, we've gone to plan B. There's low time on the clock. It's a rhythmic, three syllable word. Omaha said Hut Jimbo. Sex positions. Mm. Okay. Good job. And then say John's. I think they're gonna, my fun fact is they're gonna advance outta this region and win the national championship. Wow. Very fun fact tank. That's very fun. Alright. These have been great. Yeah, these have been great. I feel like I'm ready for the Tournament now. I got, I got my region before I do that.

Alright. I am up last region. We have the Midwest. Am I in the Midwest? You are the Midwest. I am in the Midwest. Okay. You gotta get your hands on one of These brackets. I know. These are, someone printed out all these and they don't have any of the regions. It's so stupid. Okay. First big, big picture from my region. Three of the teams in the Midwest are in the top six for most tournament appearances without a final four. So Xavier has been to the tournament 29 times. No final fours. Tennessee's been in the tournament 26 times. No final fours. Utah State's been in the tournament 24 times.


No final fours. Hmm. Utah State, state sneaking in there. Yeah. Okay. First matchup Houston verse SIU Edwardsville Houston speaking of has the most final four appearances without a national title. So they've been to the final four, six times. They've never won the title. The next in line for them is Illinois and Oklahoma. Both have been to five, never won a title. Hmm. Also, little Wayne attended University of Houston for a year in 2005. Majored in political science. So shout out political science majors. I did not know that. Pretty cool. Let's get him talking to some poli sci with Stephen A. Smith. Yeah. Then he had to, he had to drop out and he went to University of Phoenix and finish his degree.


SIU Edwardsville. What? What? I dunno if he finished his degree. But he went to University of Phoenix after Lou Wayne went to Houston. He went to Houston. He enrolled in Houston. He and it, it allegedly was getting good grades. That's what it said. Wow. 2005 to 2005. PoliSci major. Pretty fun fact, huh? Yeah. That is great. And blow your mind. SIU edwardsville. It is the first ever NCAA tournament appearance for them because they became D one. Hank still doesn't believe it, by the way. I saw that letter. It's right there on the Well he was like putting music Out there. Yeah, I know. Yeah. You Can do both. Yeah, you can do both. He probably saw higher education was like I was wildly misled by this title. Yeah. And Left.


They are, this is our first ever tournament. NCAA tournament appearance. They were became D one in 2008. Also, if you want to sound, get a little cheeky at the bar. Say you like the cougars in this game. I do like to get cheeky at the bar. Both Teams are named cougars. I like to get cheeky with the cos. Yeah. So just say, Hey, who you got in this game? I got the cougars also. Houston's win by a billion SIU Edwardsville iss 34th largest college in America by acreage. Okay. Kind Of cool. It's down by St. Louis. Notable alums. Jeff Tweedy from Wilco, bill Ky. And this one I feel like is stolen valer because everyone talks about the big show.


The wrestler going to Wichita State. He finished his career at SIU Edwardsville. That's where he got the degree from. Yeah. And he, he played D two two basketball there. Okay. So We need to put some more respect for the big show going to S-I-U-S-I-E. Yeah. Also game notes for this one I had, Houston has played five teams. 200 or worse in Ken Palm. Here are the scores. 97 to 40 against Jackson State. 91 to 45 against Louisiana. 80 to 44 against Hofstra. 78 to 49 against Toledo. 87 to 51 against Texas a and m. Corpus Christi dead. Not good. Dead not good. Not good. Okay. Next one. Next game.


Gonzaga in Georgia. Gonzaga is going for their 10th straight sweet 16. Which is insane. Yep. That's an insane nine straight sweet sixteens is nuts. Also, I found out one of Mark F's dogs, who you might remember from his Ddu, DUI video. His name Stella. Oh that's fun. And he brings her to practice With a record like that. Mark F could have also gone to Georgia. Yeah, That's true. Mark fue also, he loves fishing so much. He convinced his dentist to shave down a piece of his front tooth so he can better use it to cut fishing lines with his teeth. That's kind of creepy. So he put like a little notch in there so he can line it up.


I think it was like, it had had gotten a little like there was an indentation for where he had been doing it. 'cause it was like wearing down. Yeah. And the dentist was like, we could, we could replace the tooth. He's like, can you just shave it down so I can just keep going? That's crazy. But I, I actually respect that. Yeah. He's very competitive. It was, they, I read an interview with his fishing buddy. He's like, he's so competitive. Even when fishing. Pretty cool. Alright, Georgia, does anyone know the last time Georgia won a tournament game? Did Tom Crane win one? He did not. 2008. 2002. And so this got me thinking and I went down a little rabbit hole of, of just searching because it makes no sense.


Georgia's a huge school of the 10 college football national champions since 2002, seven outta 10 of them have been to a final four. All, all 10 of them have been to an elite eight. All of them have won a minimum of six tournament games and Georgia has not won a game. That's crazy. So you go down the list, like Ohio State, 21 wins Final four, Michigan 25 wins. Final four, Alabama 13, Clemson six wins, lead eight. That was actually the worst. U-C-F-U-U-C-F-I Did not have on there. But they've won games in the tournament. Florida obviously 33 wins. National championship.


Texas 20 wins final four USC eight wins, lead eight Georgia Zero wins Combined 154 tournament wins for all other programs that have won a national title in football. And Georgia has had zero in since 2002. That's kind of crazy, isn't it? Why, why do you think that they've had some decent players too? Right? It's, it's obviously you can do the, like Villanova's a basketball school. Football is not Yeah. But it's rare to have such a, like football when you have a big robust football program, that means you have a lot of money in the athletic department. The basketball school should at least be in the tournament every now and then. And at least winning tournament games. It also means that yeah, you can fund a decent basketball program Yeah. With what you get. And it, you want to have your fan base spend money in the wintertime after football season's over with basketball.


Yeah. Funding a a great athletic department for, for football is a lot harder to do from the ground up. Right. So this is that, that I think that's the biggest disparity. Yeah. I would say so. Between a football and a basketball program. Hank you, you with us? What you doing? Just doing some research. Oh, okay. Nice. Also this game, just game note. I gonzaga's a better team, but Georgia is taller and more physical. So it'll be very interesting to see how Gonzaga, Gonzaga has sometimes been called soft. I Yes. They Have by me specifically. Next up Clemson verse McNee state. So this is Clemson. I I have gone to a game at Clemson.


Pretty cool campus. Nice stadium. Not like it was, it was good. Clemson is also a cult that doesn't get enough credit for being a cult. They all wear their class rings. Yep. Didn't realize that they all wear their class rings. Yep. So they're in the Texas a m Notre Dame camp in there. There's a rule on campus before football games you have to wear orange on Fridays. It sounds like you get arrested if you Don't. Yep. They also do the $2 bill thing. Yeah. Where this started because in 1977, Georgia Tech and Clemson used to play every year in Atlanta and Georgia Tech canceled their rivalry game. And so George Bennett, an executive director of Clemson's Booster Club, said all Clemson fans, let's use $2 bills to show the impact we have on the economy.


Yep. Now it's kind of just they're bragging Now. They don't even make $2 bills anymore. Yeah. They're just bragging though. You, You probably have to, if you're a Clemson fan and you're planning a road trip, you have to go to the bank. Yeah. And ask for like all the $2 bills that you might have behind the scenes. You have to plan these road trips. And they're kind of just being like, look at how awesome we are. Everyone's got $2 bills Now. Yeah. We travel well And then there's also a statue, Thomas Green Clemson in Tillman Hall's statue. You're not allowed to read the plaque until you graduate. Guess what? I read the plaque today, But you didn't graduate. But I, I might graduate and I already read the plaque. But You're not allowed to. I could, I'll fucking do it. But you're not allowed to read the plaque. What do they do? Is there a punishment if they catch you reading the plaque?


I don't know. I asked, we have a, a coworker Kayla who went to Columbus. I was like, did you read that plaque? She's like, I don't remember. I was like, sounds like you, you specifically didn't read the plaque. I Would definitely read the plaque. And she had a ring on. I didn't know. They all wear the rings. Have you ever been They need to be made fun of for the Rings. You ever been to Clemson? I I just said that. Yeah. I went to a A game. You spend any time like in the town. Yeah. Yeah. It's, they've got a gas station. Yeah. They've got a rock. It's small and then they have a hill. Yeah. It's very small. Yeah. The bars were cool. Went to a couple bars there. Yeah. That's the Clemson CL ring. And they switch the sea around when you graduate McNee State, it's all about Amir Kh viral student manager. He's the best. His nickname is Aura.


And he's the first student manager to ever sign an NIL deal. He got a deal with Buffalo Wild Wings, ticks pick tick Pics and Insomnia cookies. And he has the quote, if they kept manager stats for rebounding and wiping up wet spots on the court, I'd put up Wilt Chamberlain numbers. Yeah. This guy Rocks. He's the best. I've seen a bunch of videos with this dude. Yeah, he is. He's worth every penny. Yeah. One note on this game, McNee State actually played two Power five programs this year. They lost by eight to Alabama and three to Mississippi State. So they might be able to Hang fighting with Wade. Okay, next up Purdue High Point. I don't, I got Purdue. I'm gonna keep it clean here. Purdue has produced 27 astronauts and they also have the first and last guy to walk on the moon.


So Neil Armstrong first Eugene Cerin last You mean a sound stage in Burbank, California? Yes. Okay. Also, I found out that 16% of people who've been on the moon are named Allen. That is a fun fact. Yeah. Alan Shepherd And the other Allen. There's another Allen. Yeah. Also over 70% of produce students graduate as Virgins. High Point. This one's crazy. High Point University. I don't know if you guys know anything about High Point. I actually talked to Kelly Keggs, our, our coworker who went to High Point. They're, they have the second longest wind streak in the country right now with 14 High Point University is they basically made like a Sims College because it looks like Disneyland.


There's like 15 pools. There's a max. You're gonna like this. 'cause I know I liked it. There is a ice cream truck that you can, that's free to all students that you can get in between classes. It's free all the time. Yeah. That is an in incred. That's, that's So I think it's part of your meal thing, but it's like you just go, you get ice cream. That is the best perk. High Point also has a steak restaurant that you can go to once a month free. And it is the, the goal of the state re steak restaurant is, it's a fine di Dining Learning Lab aims to teach students business and social etiquette, including how to eat in a professional setting.


They're literally teaching 'em how to eat high point's. Not real world. I, I'm gonna guess that High Point might have outside of like Yale High Point might have sneaky the highest tuition. It's, it's a cra like looking at the campus, seeing all this stuff. The also like the president is from the country Jordan. And he made it from High Point College to High Point University. And then he built all this Stuff, $70,000 a year. It's Insanes like if you look at anything about High Point, it's, it, it basically is like a movie set for a college. That's very funny. They're like, it's $70,000 a year, but free ice cream while you're here. Yeah. And you get to learn how to eat a steak. Yeah. Also High Point, South Carolina is the furniture capital of the world.


Yeah. North Carolina furniture's a real thing. Yeah. So they have like a furniture expo every year. Pretty crazy. My only game note from, oh, they also have a guy, a seven footer, Jolyn, Bodo Bodo. I like that. Just like it. My, my note from this game is High Point plays a drop coverage scheme and, and Braden Smith is probably gonna go over on his points. Andis. Okay. They're just gonna run two man offense. Purdue all game. Okay, next up I got Illinois verse Texas and Xavier, my Illinois fun fact is I have two of them. Tom Ferelli was once at a party with Deron Williams and Deron slept while standing up in the corner.


Oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah. Way to go, Tom. Yeah. So that was, that was a cool one. And then my other one is, was that Just 'cause you didn't wanna talk to Tom or That was really mean? Oh my bad. That was really mean. You don't think that Tom can party? No, he, he is saying that he was, Tom was such a bore that he was sleeping in the corner. Maybe Tom was Tom talking to him while he fell asleep? Well, yeah. It's like, oh no, this guy's Gonna come talk to me. Yeah. Mm. Other fun fact is our guy, Chuck and I witnessed this firsthand. He had a friend in college named Pat Moriarty who would bring a Ziploc bag of Italian sausages to the bar. And I actually watched this.


We, we were out there doing a, a event at Red Lion for the Black Hawks. I think it was like 2013 or 14. And he literally just pulled a sausage out of his pocket. He's like, you want a sausage cooked sausage? Not like sausage bites cooked on the grill sausage. Was it hot? How fat? Pat Moriarty. He actually was in pretty good shape. That's a wild move. Yeah. Pretty cool move though. I ate the sausage. Was it hot sauce? Like did it, was it temperature hot or was it just cold, stale pocket temperature sausage? No, it was like he grilled the sausage in the morning then would put it in the Ziploc bag and then bring it out with him. Boom. Need a sausage. There you go. I think you were there with us. You might have been underage so you might not come to us.


The bar with us. Yeah. Yes. Okay. And then they're gonna play Texas or Xavier, Xavier, Sean Miller, all time sweat guy. Just needs to be reminded everyone. Yep. Also Xavier, Zach Freemantle has been there for about a hundred years. If you're not familiar with him, he's very good. But he's been there forever. And Ryan Conwell, their other really good player, you might recognize him. He was on Indiana State last year, which was kind of a, a darling that didn't make the tournament. And then Texas, Trey Johnson is a lottery pick. You should know his name. And Texas is in the tournament. 19 and 15 is their record. And if you take out teams worse than 200 in Ken Palm on their schedule, they were actually 13 and 15.


Hmm. So they beat the fuck out of Houston. Christian, Chicago State, Mississippi Valley State, Arkansas, pine Bluff, new Orleans, Northwestern State, Texas has good players. They might not be a good team. I've seen enough Texas this year that I would agree with that. Yeah. Okay. I got three more. Kentucky v Troy, Kentucky. Mark Pope met his wife. She was a, a personal assistant for David Letterman. And Mark Pope actually met his future wife's brother. And then the brother called the future wife and said, when my brother met Mark, he was like, I just met the male version of you.


He's you, but he's a dude. He's gonna call you for Letterman tickets. Is that good? I saw White Lotus. Kidding me. Yeah. True, true. And then also Mark Pope Raps. I saw Mark Pope's rap. Well he did Eminem at the credit 10 for trying. Yeah. This one was, he did Hamilton. Do you wanna play it? I don't, there's nothing I want to. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Play it. Do I have a hidden talent? Just in the hopes that Lin Manuel that you're watching, I'm gonna get a scholarship to King's College. I probably shouldn't brag with Dad. Got amazing and astonished. The problem is I got a lot of brains but no Polish. I gotta holler just to be heard with every word I drop knowledge. I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal. Everybody.


Okay, that's Mark Pope. That's Kentucky. Troy. Coach Kel would've killed that rap. Yeah. Yeah. Troy, that, that was tough to watch. Troy. It's their third tournament appearance. They've never won a game. And this one's a fun fact. Their coach recently went on record saying he only recruits guys who like Waffle House. That's not a bad strategy. Yeah. So in the town where Troy plays, it's like 15,000 people. There's three waffle houses. So it's like he said, it's probably per capita the highest like five, 5,000 person per Waffle House. And he said, we offhand ask them, do you like Waffle House? If the answer is yes, we sign them.


If it's no, we never get them. I like that. 'cause if you spend time in a waffle House, you know how to handle yourself too. Yeah. You got street skills. Yeah. Facts. Also, Troy, the game note, I had Lamont Butler's back for Kentucky and Troy is one of those teams that's very analytical. They only show shoot at the rim and they shoot threes. Only problem for Troy is they suck at shooting threes. So they're literally the worst percentage in the entire field of 68 is shooting threes. And they shoot a lot of 'em. This is When keeping his Steph Curry goes wrong. Yeah. Yeah. But they're doing it. They're doing it. Alright. UCLA verse Utah State, this one is just UCLA Mick Cronin. Remember when Mick Cronin basketball almost killed him?


He had a unruptured aneurysm in the back of his head and almost died. Yeah. So I found a very funny, I I went, I went deep. I found a very funny dude's rock moment. There was a story about a man in Minneapolis who saw Mick Cronin's story. He had similar headaches and he went to the doctor and the doctor was like, oh, you have an Unruptured aneurysm. And the guy was like, I know exactly what that is. Coach Cronin's got it. And the doctor was like, who the hell is Coach Cronin? So Mick Cronin saved a guy's life. This Is how dudes learn about injuries. Right. And learn about like illnesses that they might have. Yeah. It's like, oh I think I, I think I might have what that coach has. He literally saw him.


He's like, yeah, I got really bad headaches. He almost died. And he's like, oh fuck, I've had really bad headaches. Am I about to die? He went to the emergency room, was about to die. Good For him. Saving lives. Yeah. Saving lives. Utah State. I just have notable alumni because they have a lot of guys who played football there. Bobby Wagner, Donald Penn, Roy Shivers, Al Smith, Travis Laboy, Eric Hippel and Chris Cooley. Those are all the really good football players from Utah State. They're the Aggies too, right? Yes. They're the Aggies. Utah state also is going to zone the fuck outta UCLA. So I kind of like the under in that game. Alright, last one for me. Tennessee and Wofford. Wilford, Tennessee.


Rick Barnes is his, is in his 29th NCAA tournament. A lot of tournaments. He is fourth all time for tournament appearances. He's never won a title. He's been to one final four. He's 30 in 28 in NCAA tournaments. Not great. Their last, is it their last three years they won. Yeah. So that was my other fun back. Okay. Yeah. Go. So yeah, so 2020 was covid year, no games. 2021. They they, they lost the first round 2022. They lost the second round 23. They lost the third. Third round. 24 in the Elite eight last year. So this year, final four. Final four. And next year championship game. Unless they're a playing team. Yeah. Then that would fuck up the Whole thing.


That would mess. I don't think that they would be, but yeah, that, so this guarantees that they get to the Final Four. Yes. Yes. Wofford, Spartanburg, South Carolina. Notable golfer. Hank Willie McGirt. Do you know him? Nope. Great name. Dirtt McGirt. Two professional wins. Also. They have a live mascot. Terrier named Blitz three. And has been the mascot. It has been interior since, or the live mascot since 2014. Yeah, Those small dogs live a long time. Yeah. I tried to find any other news and I couldn't find any, which I think is a good thing. Yeah. I mean the only I I think that most people learn about geography in the United States via mid-major schools in March.


Madness. Yeah. And so when I learned that this was South Carolina, I'm like, okay, Wofford, South Carolina Terriers. And they had that one good player a couple years ago. Fletcher McGee. Fletcher McGee. Yeah. Aal. Also this game. Game note Wofford 333rd and Tempo Tennessee 346th and Tempo. Gonna be a slow one. A real slow one. Okay. I feel like that was it. Very fun. Fast guys. Max what? What Max? I think that was the longest segment we've ever done. But Was great. It Was good. It was, it was good. It was the funnest segment we've ever done. Yep. Yeah.

He really took down that line. Yeah.


I would like to apologize for my actions on third base. Yesterday I made an immature decision in the heat of the moment. The gesture I made does not reflect my character. The household I was raised in or the block m that I represent in any kind of way. I take full responsibility for what I did.

No. What's your cool throne since Hank left? Hank, do you want to go? No, you got it. I'm sorry. I had to pee really bad. Cool Throne. PF two. Okay. My cool throne is Paul Skees.


'cause Paul Skees, you might wanna sit down Uhoh. He was named the starter for opening day for the players. Wow. And they did a big video production about it too. And they're like, congratulations, you're gonna start opening the dude fucking started the Allstar game last year. Love that. As a rookie. I love that. And they made it like the Yankees don't have to put an announcement that John Carlow Stanton's gonna be injured opening day. Right. The pirates don't need to put out an announcement that Paul Skees is gonna be the starting pitcher. Right. For opening day. Right. My other Hot Seat was gonna be Grift two. The Drake Bulldogs live mascot. Oh yeah, I saw that. You're not allowed to bring your live mascots to the NCAA tournament unless it's the Final Four. Yeah. But they don't allow them in the building. And the Drake Bulldogs, they under Griff two, their current bulldog, I believe their record is at least in the Missouri Valley conference tournament.


Nine and Oh they're nine and oh when Grif two is there, You gotta, if you're a Drake alumni, if you're Drake administrator, you got trench coat this bulldog. Yeah, we you gotta bring him in a trench coat. I don't care. You gotta get the bulldog in there for All the dogs, right Hank? Yeah. Yep. Get 'em, get 'em. Do the service dog. I don't care. Griff's gotta be in the building. Got it Free G Griff. Free G Griff. All right. Hank My Hot Seat is the FBI slash gia slash mafia. Oh, Okay. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Trump announced that the, he's actually finally releasing the J-F-K-J-F-K files. Mm. So he was supposed to release those today. We haven't seen it today.


I hope it happens. I'm su I mean he, he they gotta come out right? They Gotta The Epstein files. That was a big nothing. Nothing Burger. Yeah, no, obviously nothing's gonna come out. Who do you think they, but they like, I like how they keep saying like I, 'cause I'm sure in a couple like weeks or month they're gonna say, now we're gonna release the insane files. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. Who do you think did it Hank The CIA, The guy, the his driver. Yeah. And turned around and got him. Yep. I think it's the dude that was from Illinois. That guy. Mafia guy. Oh Yeah. Yeah. Mafia slash Ccia. Yeah. Who is like, who is in charge of Jack getting Jack Ruby killed? Yeah. That guy did that shit. Yeah. Or Jack or in charge of Jack Ruby killing.


Killing that guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then the craziest part about Jack Ruby, he went to prison and then one of the doctors that ran in MK Ultra went to visit him, gave him like a dose of some medication. Then Jack Ruby went insane right after that visit. Damn. Damn Nuts. Yeah. Makes you stink. Finally. We'll, we'll know the truth. My cool throne is Podcast P with Paul George. Is it back? Yeah. So he, on February 26th said, I wanna let the podcast p family know that after today's episode with Dwight, I plan to take a break from the pod just to focus on getting my body right mentally right. And you know, help the squad make a push towards our goal to finish the season out and gives ourself a chance to be in contention for, to compete for a championship.


And then today the Sixers announced that Paul George received injections in his left muscle and left knee on Monday and has been ruled out for the rest of the season. Mm mm So He's bringing it back. He's gotta bring it back. I mean, gotta bring it back. Nah. When you said podcast PI thought you meant that you just got off the couch again to go use the bathroom during a segment or You were just talking as oldie. I love that. Oldie calls you p Yeah. So Funny. Podcast P Makes you laugh every time. It's a good nickname. PI like it. Okay. My Hot Seat, I have two is my sleep. Because I woke up this morning at four 30 this morning to watch the Cubs lose to the Dodgers. Turns out the Dodgers are still really good. Yeah. And they're gonna win a lot of games. I hate this shit that they start the season overseas.


Yeah. And like, like Soda was pitching a no hitter through four, which doesn't really count through four. He threw four walks and they pulled him. 'cause I think they're trying to be very like cautious with the fact they have to go all the way back from Japan and then there's 10 days before actual opening day. So it's weird. But the Dodgers are really good. Did, did you see any more highlights? Yes. It, they had, so they had a high, they had what I think was the camera we watched from behind the plate and it was just the player, the batter was just totally pixelated every time. Yeah. It was garbage. It's weird. It was Garbage. So It's not one camera, it's, I don't know what it was. It's a combination of a bunch of cameras Every time it looked like your TV broke.


Yeah. It would show this highlight. So it sucked Your thoughts Hank. No comment. Also Hot Seat Aaron Rogers. Because Cam Hayward said I ain't doing that Darkness retreat. And he said I don't need any of that crap either You wanna be a Pittsburgh Steeler or you don't. It's that simple. That's the pitch. If you want me to recruit, that's a recruiting pitch. Pittsburgh Steelers. Yeah, I like that from Cam Hayward. Yeah. He's like, this is what Aaron Rogers is doing right now. Not steel or football. Yeah. And he is like, I'm ready, I'm about to retire. Just fucking, just let me go. Like, just figure it out. I'm not doing this. Also Schefter said that he thinks that the Vikings want Aaron. He's, he's option number one for the Vikings.


Ah. And so now it's up to Aaron Rogers to just decide if he wants to play there. Yeah. So the whole thing is weird. We'll find out crazy at point at some point. Crazy that Aaron RAs is holding up an off season. This will turn out well. Yeah. He really is just, it is Cats in the Cradle with Brett Fav. Yeah. He's just learning everything from, And he hated Brett Favre for I know too. I know. It's, it's perfect. Cool drone. Two of 'em as well.


Get your brackets in still Blue Coffee. We're doing a golden bracket. So all you gotta do is buy something on still blue coffee.com.

And then my other cool throw is Tracy Morgan. He just had food poisoning. It happens. I I, I think this was awful that you're throwing up court side of the Knicks game and the game's delayed like 20 minutes. That sucks. I think it was like in a weird way Good that Tracy Morgan could see how much he's loved because I didn't see anyone counting on Him. Well Tracy Mor he's had this opportunity a few times. Yeah. It's like the world has reminded Traci Morgan like, please, I hope you're okay. Yeah. Like he's had health issues. Yeah. And so everyone when I saw it, 'cause I'm, I'm the number one puke guy. I love puke. I laugh at puke all the time. There wasn't a lot of like joking about Tracy Morgan. Everyone was like, I hope he's okay. Yeah. James Dolan has gotta be furious that Tracy Morgan got food poisoning at MSG.


Yeah. He might be kicked out. Yeah. Also was very funny 'cause if you saw one of the videos, Bobby Bakala was just looking like, get this guy outta here. Yeah. It was a goal. I need my train set. It's very good shot. Very funny. Puke.

And now here's Mark Titus. Okay, we now welcome on a very, very, very, very, very, very special guest. It is tradition, our Good friend. Except that one year when he said really inappropriate Things. Yeah. When he got canceled. It's tradition, mark Titus. It's a lot easier than in years past when we would have to, he would basically get hit up by every single person in the media world this week being like, oh, Titus, you like ball. Come talk to me about March Madness. Now we work together. Now you own me. Yeah, we own you. Yeah. Two years is your two year anniversary coming up?


Yeah. Yeah. I think I've been here two full years now. That's crazy. Was probably right before March Madness. Which I don't know if that was That smart or not was terrible idea. Well, no, it was actually smart because you probably smart you survived it. But yeah, we, we always have you on the Wednesday of March madness of the, of the tournament week. I'm excited about this bracket. Do we need to just say a quick fuck you to UNC and prayers to West Virginia and Indiana for being left out? Yeah. I mean, like, like you said before, you'll move on fast. The second the ball's tipped. I won't give a shit. But it was egregious. I thought, I thought North Carolina, at no point in the season did they look like an NCA tournament team. They, they, yeah. They, their, their, their highs weren't very high. Their lows were pretty damn low.


And I was, I was stunned. I was, I in all the years of, you know, that's how the bracket works. It comes out, we, we lose our minds about teams that got in that didn't deserve it. We, we feel bad for the teams that were left out. This is the most egregious example that I've ever seen. And you know, the fact that the ad is the guy running the whole thing also is, is interesting. But It says Michael Jordan's pause all over it. But you know, when the, when the basketball starts, who gives a fuck? Yeah. Who gives a fuck? Who fuck the, the, the more I thought about it because we did our instant reactions on Sunday night. I think the committee basically was like, we have four historically great teams at number one seeds and the rest of the bracket will just fucking fill it out however it goes.


Yeah. Because it's not just who got left and left out. There's some weird seeding, like Michigan getting a five, Louisville getting an eight, Louisville Getting an eight Green that Yeah. Do Wisconsin going out to Denver in four days. Rest. Like there, it just felt very weird how they put it was Half football thing together. Half. And I think I would've been fine with that if they just like, would've straight up said, all right, so here's the deal. Carolina got in 'cause Bubba Cunningham's the chair. Some of these seatings are off because to be completely honest, we think it doesn't matter this year. Right. 'cause the, it's so top heavy. So who gives a fuck? But the, yeah. So saying like, Tucker Dev re was hurt and that's why West Virginia was, I don't know. It's, it's, it's so transparent and, and stupid. I I didn't think Carolina, I said this to you did, I didn't think Carolina, if I was running the NIT Carolina would not have even been a one seat in Right.


The NIT bracket Mm. Much less in the NCA tournament. But at the same time we move on, we get excited about the bracket we do have And they're gonna probably win A couple and they're probably gonna win a couple games. Yeah. You guys just interviewed the governor of West Virginia, but he also gave a press conference earlier today. Yes. I wasn't able to watch it. Did he do the thing like Chief SHO's lawyer where he made a lot of like bad basketball puns? No. In reference to the miscarriage of justice? No. He actually, he had a good perspective on it. Right. He was like, this isn't gonna change anything. Yeah. Okay. He's like, nothing's gonna change. I just wanna raise a little Hell Yes. I was hoping he was gonna say like, this is an alley. Oops. Oh. Or like, like this is the big dance is now the big dunks. He did that with the sign the National Corrupt Yeah.


Athletic Associ. But he, yeah. The, the West Virginia governor doing that. I, it, he basically had like two hours of, of, you know, everyone's paying attention and then Yeah. I I'm already over it. Yeah. He's just like, I'm showing my constituents like I too am upset. Right. And I'm gonna say something about it. It's The quickest. Like we literally, when Tuesday happens and the first ball's tipped, it's like, what, who was that Governor again? That's what, when, when we, we were signing off, I told him, I'll do anything to help you governor. As long as it doesn't require extra effort or inconvenience me in any way, I will throw my weight behind your cause. But would You change the channel to something else during the play in game halftime show? No.


Rossing. Yeah. That's a good point. Rossing. Yeah, Rossi's gonna to get some nuggets. I can't, I can't turn my back. Can't turn back On Rossing. I'm trying, trying to figure out what I could do. Yeah, no, probably nothing. Do, do We think we're, we're gonna break down the bracket with you in a second, but do we think there is any chance they have the ball situation figured out this year? Oh yeah. I'm very nervous about that. We had the guy from Wilson, there's a guy from Wil. We were doing one of the upfront today, a guy from Wilson was in the office. I talked to him for like an hour about this. He said the, the, the problem they have with this ball and maybe you experience it 'cause we have 'em here. Yeah, yeah. The, the, the super orange balls, they're, they're a little more cushiony than the other evolutions, right? Yeah.


He said the cushion, the, the way it works is they'll pump the balls up and then they just give it a little squeeze to see if it, if it's, you know, you want it like a little bit of give, but not too much, you know? Right. That's just the, just the, you feel it out. It's like, yeah. That, that's how you pump up the ball. But it's, it has so much cushion that they'll pump it up to the max, give it a little squeeze, and feel the cushion and be like, pump It up more And pump it up more. Ah. And he said it's like the, the, the people that pump this thing up are working on, I, I, apparently there's just not a PSI system the way, I dunno. He, he told me this, this was like a, a year ago, he told me all this and I was like, oh my God. It makes so much sense. So I don't know if they solved it. They have to have solved it because I think they just got these like 65-year-old dudes just over there pumping up these balls and they're o over inflated.


And I don't know. I I, I, and it matters. It does matter. We Saw like crazy air balls and weird things happen. Yeah. But hopefully, hopefully that's not a problem. And they, and they've learned the lesson, but yeah. That, that, that first year especially, I think that was the 22 tournament. Yes. I think that was three years ago. It was brutal. Yeah. Guys couldn't dribble, guys couldn't shoot. But, you know, Has there, has it ever gone the other way where the ball is like perfect, like a oh, like a, a great example of ball and it's like scorings through the roof because the guys love this Ball. The guy is a perfect ball. Yeah. Oh, that's a good Question. Perfect ball. We, because I feel like anytime they switch out a ball, it's, it's never for the better. You're right about that. Yeah. No, they, we gotta, we, we should figure out what the perfect ball is. And, and It's, it's a fuel thing. Like know when you dribble it, it's that perfect ball.


Yeah. The exact right amount of bounce that you were expecting. You throw the other one away. Let's go. I Had someone point out to me, something I never thought about, but I was, when Wisconsin was playing Michigan in the Big 10 tournament final, I was like, yeah, tired legs. Like this is what I expected. They just aren't moving. And someone was like, do you ever think maybe the ball is tired? The ball could be tired, the ball be Tired. That ball has pla played a lot of hoops in the last, in the last five days. And On top of all of it, it's too orange. It's like, it's just a weird orange, I think. Very, we gotta fix that. We gotta go back to a more brownish orange. I Agree. So you wanna to get into the bracket mark. Yeah, I Would love it. Let's Dive in. Mark Titus's credentials. He was drafted by the Harlem Globetrotters. That's Right. So that's a pretty fucking impressive thing to have on your resume.


I got a high level bracket before we go region by region. So this is the, the season. And I love it where we get all the analytics and people are like, Hey, this is what needs to happen as a, as a champion. It's the Ken Palm rule where I think it's a team has to be, I believe it's 21st or better in adjusted offensive efficiency in 37th or better in adjusted defense. And both of those cutoffs exist because of 2014 ucon, right? Yes. Like both of them. But so th those cutoffs usually. And and it is like if you look at it going into the tournament, that's where you're gonna find your national champion this year though, it's crazy. There's 11 teams that meet that, which I feel like has never been, it's usually like six or seven teams.


Yeah. Yeah. So there's 11 teams. I'm gonna, I'm gonna list all 11 for you. Okay. And you can tell me yes. That the national champion will be in this group. Okay. Duke, Florida, Houston Auburn, all your one seeds. Yep. Tennessee, Alabama. Both two seeds. Texas Tech of three seed Gonzaga and eight seed. Iowa State, Wisconsin. Also your three seeds and Arizona. That's the List. I mean, yeah. I think the national champion is in that group. Notable Exceptions that have been left out are Michigan State, St. John's. So those are the teams like I I think a lot of people Maryland's, Maryland's not in there. Would you feel comfortable saying that the others are not gonna win?


I would, I I think this year is the most top heavy feeling I have about college basketball entering an NCA tournament since 2015. I remember 2015 was a, it, it stood out to me going into the tournament. There was Kentucky at the top who was undefeated obviously. But I felt like the, the rest of the ones and the twos Duke ended up winning. But, but Wisconsin was absolutely loaded that year. As you know, Dan, I think Virginia and Villanova both had really, really good teams. Arizona had a good team. I think Kansas was a two, they were like a week or two that I, I think ended up losing early. But I remember going into the 2015 tournament feeling like it was kind of a perfect setup because Kentucky was the undefeated behemoth Goliath, but they weren't unbeatable as we learned in the Final four.


But I, I had a really good feeling that it was gonna be a one or a two. 'cause if you watched all season, it just felt like these teams are just way better than everybody else. Right. I feel that way this year for the first time since 2015. I have that same feeling again. I just think the, the, the Dukes, the Auburns, Florida's been coming on strong. Houston, all the one seeds are, are clearly better than everybody else to me. And then the two seeds, the, it's like all the ones, all the twos and then everybody else is kind of how I feel. Yeah. And Texas Tech is like the one team that might be in the mix. That's not a one or two if They got healthy. Yeah. Otherwise I, I just think it's really top heavy and it sucks 'cause I think everybody this time of year gets excited about the Cinderella and they, they want me to come on here and be like, I think this team's gonna get upset early.


I think it's really chalky season. Yeah. I think I have a really chalky bracket. I think. I think this is the year of chalk. But Chalky again, I obviously you want an upset or two in the first round. It's fun. Chalky always does make it great for the second weekend in the final four. Yeah. Because it's like you don't, like St. Peter's was a great story. That elite GA eight game was garbage. It was garbage, it was terrible. Yeah. Right. And and like even George Mason who's like the OG Cinderella story, they got to the final four and got their ass kicked right by Florida. It always happens that way. So yeah, it's weird 'cause you wanna celebrate the fun little, little guys making the runs. But you do wanna see the big boys. I think that's what we're getting this year I think. I think there might be like one or two. Maybe you get like a double digit seed, make the sweet 16.


Maybe you get like a crazy elite eight run. Maybe hell maybe there's like a seven seed in the final four. But I'm very, very confident that your national champion will be a one or two. Which I understand everybody listening is like good job going out on a limb, but Yukon two years ago was a four seat. What I'm telling you is that will not happen this year. Right. There will not be Yukon two years ago four seat. There will not be the Yukon of 2014 being a seven seat. It will be a one or a two and it'll probably be a one. They're just so much better than everybody. The other nice thing that we like about the Cinderella is early on is if there's a like an unlikeable coach or a coach where it's fun if they lose to like a goalie. Right? So last year it was Cal losing to a goalie in the first round.


Is there any coach out there that you think America would be like, be really funny if that guy Lost. It'd be funny if that guy lost. Good question. I mean Todd Golden. I don't know how many out, out of people paying attention to what was going on. Well They did ation. Yeah. And their investigation was, you see the guy Florida's really good. It's always funny if Rick Barnes loses Rick Barnes Losing's funny. Yeah. I mean Matt Painter going, that painter Matt Painter getting over the hump just to go right back to like losing to the first round. Yeah. Would Be kind of Funny. It's also a little bit personal for you. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know Who Nate Oes. You got the, you got the bill self, John Calip, Perry, Rick Pitino little section down there in the bottom left. You know, only one of those guys can come out.


So I don't know if there could be some, some interesting dynamics at play there. Yeah. Alright, let's break. Let's, yeah, I dunno. Let's start breaking it down. Alright, let's go in the top left. The east. Is that right? South I have, I have a South Auburn, the region's Auburn region. You, you think Auburn was deserving of the one overall seed? It is unprecedented lost three or four going into the tournament. That has never, no team's ever done that and gotten the number one overall seed. They, they had a a obviously a dominant stretch up until like the last couple weeks. Basically someone pointed out that their, their tough stretch started when they clinched the SEC.


So maybe if you're, if you wanna believe in Auburn, just say that they have had nothing to play for. Yeah. But it was interesting 'cause like up until they started losing there, there someone I was watching, I think it was Jimmy Dex, I was watching one of the Auburn games and he, he made the point Auburn could forfeit every game for the rest of the season and still get the number one overall. And they pretty much did. They're like, okay, we we're gonna go do that love practice. So yeah, I I I think if you're looking at it in the totality of the season, Auburn's resume was maybe the strongest resume like we, we've kind of ever seen. Which maybe is not true now that they lost. 'cause I guess Kentucky was undefeated that one, that one year. Right. But it was, it was just like an insane resume. They played all the, they played all the other one seeds.


They ba they beat just about everybody. But yeah, I mean it is weird 'cause going into the tournament, the number one overall seed is generally the team that everyone's like, yeah that's probably the best team. And I think most people are like, yeah Auburn is, it feels like it's Duke in Florida. I would not have if, if I'll put it this way, if any of the four one seeds were named the number one overall seed, I probably would've been fine with it. I think all of them have arguments. I think Duke is the best team. I think Florida has, is the hottest team. I think Houston is like a team that, that ripped through a big 12 that's really strong. And Houston, I think Houston only lost one game in regulation all season. Yeah. They lost like four, but three of 'em were in overtime. Yeah. And they just like, they don't go away.


It's, it's impossible to beat them by. Yeah. More than one possession. I think Houston had a case to be number one overall, but I don't know. Auburn, Auburn had a, had a historic run and you know, played, played Houston non-conference. They played in the Maui Invitational. They went to Duke and then they were also in the SEC, which was as good of a conference as we've ever seen. So. Alright. So what, do you have any, any, any upsets in this region? So I'm looking at what everyone else is looking at. 12 five. Yep. How do you feel about this? Because I, I, uc, San Diego, I'll be honest, transparent, I watched one game. It was the big West championship. They did not look good. I know they won the game against a team. That's also supposed to be good. I didn't think they were that good. I was, I was worried.


I'm worried about the idea. Michigan turns it over like crazy. You see San Diego leads the country in turnover margin. So part of me is like, Michigan's just gonna turn it over like 30 times and you see San Diego wins this, but I'm has uc, San Diego face two seven footers running a pick and roll. Right. Do they have the horses for that? I think they're Tallest guys. Six, eight and most of the guys are six. Six or under. I feel like I, yeah, I feel like everybody's hot on uc, San Diego and I, I I'm the other thing, they haven't played a power conference team and that's why I'm worried about that. 'cause it feels like McNee last year, you remember McNeese State last year? Everyone was like, yep. Like they were the hottest team in the country and They lost by a billion. And, and then I looked at their schedule, I was like, they haven't, they haven't literally not played anybody that has a sinner that that's taller than six eight, you know?


Yeah. Yeah. When Did they become McNeese? I don't know when that happened. They just Dropped the state. You know what's funny too about the uc, San Diego, Michigan, like upset that everyone's gonna pick because I agree with you. I think it's uc. San Diego is a very good team. Their metrics are, are like off the charts for a 12 seed for a small conference. They haven't played anyone and they're gonna go up against two seven footers. That doesn't feel like a good recipe. But then right underneath it, I think Yale could beat Texas a and m. Yeah. Texas, Yale is the team. Like Yale completely dominated the Ivy. They played a couple, like, they, they played, they lost by like eight to Purdue. They played a one possession game with Minnesota.


Obviously Minnesota did not, like, wasn't an incredible team, but I, I feel like Yale and they got guys who could rebound like Yale. I, you, your, your point about Minnesota, I think that matters. I wanna see these smaller schools having, having played just, just get a taste for it, get touched in the mouth by, have, have to go up against a defense. Even if they're not the best team in the world, you're actually being guarded by like a six, six guard out there or something versus, you know, playing in the Ivy League and dealing with the smaller and less athletic dudes. Right. And Texas a and m is one of those teams. I like Buzz Williams, I think they're a good team, but they are a team that struggles to shoot they're Bucket basketball team. Yeah. And they're a bucket up team. So if you can't score, that's why as much as I want St. John's to go deep, it's like if you have, if you don't have the ability to get a couple guys hot just because you look at their body of work and they just can't do it, I, that always smells trouble.


Yeah. So I feel like Yale might be my Upsetting. That could be a good one. I yale's I you could get the Yale, Michigan Danny Wolf storyline now. Yeah. Yeah. That, that little, that little thing going. I think New Mexico, when I look at this region, the first round game I'm most excited for is New Mexico Marquette. I think Donovan Dent versus Cam Jones is going to be fucking insane to watch. I think both those guys could score 35 points in this game. It'll be up and down and I'll, I'll love it and I don't care who wins, but I, I that's, that's an upset, I guess, you know, New Mexico beating Marquette that has my attention. But yeah, I I I am gravitating towards chalk in general across the board in this bracket, which is very boring. And I apologize to the, to the awls outta the gate because I, I just Not the first time you had to apologize.


I know, I, I wish I had the balls to pick Louisville to beat Auburn. Yeah. I wish I had the balls, but I don't, Louisville played in Louisville got fucked with their seed, but they could have played in Lexington. I know. Like I would've rather had a five seed and be in Milwaukee. Here's another one that I'll throw out there. And I don't think Brian's gonna beat Michigan State, but it shocked me when I saw this. Brian's taller than Michigan State. Oh really? Yeah, They don't have a starter under six six. No shit. Yeah. Which is, huh, that's a shocking 15 two huh? Where you get that, you get a 15 two and it's almost always, oh, well look, height actually matters in basketball. But Brian again, I think Michigan State's gonna win the game, but that could be a game that's a little bit trickier for Michigan State if they can't out physical them.


Gimme your overall vibe reading on Michigan State and Tom Izzo heading in this specific Michigan state. Does this, does this feel like a quintessential Tom Izzo in March type Michigan State team? Does this feel like maybe they have, they've been punching above their weight class, so to speak? Because I, I'll be honest, like after the Champions classic, I thought Michigan State was, was going to be in jeopardy of missing the tournament. I was like, this team just doesn't have a ton of talent. I felt like last year's team was like a nine seat, if I remember right. Yeah. And, and they lost their three best players. Yep. They didn't really replay, like Jace Richardson ended up being awesome, but at the time he was, I think he was like a four star recruit and it was like, I don't know how they're gonna replace the production they lost and they weren't even that good last year.


I didn't think they would be very good. I was very wrong. They, they, they have, you know, bought into the culture. They've, they've been playing outta their minds. But I don't know now that the tournament is here, is that, is that the recipe for Tom Izzo or is the recipe like sneak up on teams a little bit? Yeah. What I see from izo usually coming like the last couple seasons going to the tournament, izo, he's very transparent. He kinda like lets, you know with his body language and his language language that he's not happy with his team and he is not like super confident. What I've seen more from Tom Izzo is him being like upset that he doesn't have enough reasons to be pissed off at his team. Right, right. Which, which to me I read that as confidence. Yeah. No, I think this is a very classic Michigan State team and the fact that they have guards that wear thick headbands and are absolute dogs.


And then even they throw in the, the, the Kohler bear, Jackson Kohler just a white dude who dude played, who plays basketball. Like he's a football player, Dude. He's got like a Hakeem Elijah dream shape too. He'll just post up and like hit a little baseline turnaround. But they always need one of those guys too. I I, yeah. I like this Michigan State team. I think, I think I'm go, I, I settled a, so I have Michigan State going to the final four because I think Auburn's gonna get tripped up somewhere. So I I I do think Michigan State's gonna go to the final four. I think I settled on, they are on a, a typical Michigan State tournament run, but it just started in November. Yeah. I think that's what this team is. This team was not this, this team started their typical like, like, I don't know, when I think of the Tom izo runs, they're like a seven seat or a six seat or something.


Like Right when the seat is starting, it's not hot yet, but people are like talking about maybe heating it up next Year. And I think this team was that in November and then they just stayed on a run the entire season basically. And I think they might be a quintessential Michigan State team in the fact that I think they'll go, I like, I'm gonna pick them and go to the final four in this, in this region as well. And then they'll lose like 72 to 54. Yeah. In the, in the semifinals in the first one. Yeah. They're gonna play the early one. They're not gonna shoot it all Yeah. In the big dome and you're gonna be like, ah, shit. Exactly. Right. That was it. You made a great point too. The guards that they have, the, the one thing that they have perfected is, is figuring out the exact amount of confidence you should have on a basketball court.


Yeah. They, they have the perfect amount, they talk the perfect amount of shit, but like Auburn's a team that I think they, they've overdone it in recent weeks. Like they, they almost get too much into the shit talking and like pumping up the crowd and all that. Whereas Michigan State is like the perfect level of we're gonna talk insane amounts of shit to you, but also remember that we're playing a basketball game And we need to beat you at basketball. Right. Whereas Auburn, I feel like, yeah. I don't know the last couple weeks, every time I watch Auburn they'll hit like one shot and like just start getting the crowd going and getting just like You're still down four. Yeah. Who, that one guy that just, he blacks out and just gets a technical Just like Chad Baker Mazar. Yeah. He'll just hit you in the back of your head. He Got kicked out the game two weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah. He early, he played, I think they were, were playing Arkansas.


I think it was the Arkansas game where he, he hits a three by Arkansas's bench and turns to them and like pops his jersey. Then like two possessions later he hits another three and like goes like he said, he says something obviously, and the ref immediately texts him up and he just goes, wha what? Yeah. What? And then in the Alabama game, like he, he like clothes lines somewhere. He clotheslines someone in the family game, I think, well last year The to he like hit him and then he was like, no, that wasn't hard enough. And then brought his hand back Again Last year the tournament, he, he, he got the flager against Yale to start the game. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Izzo, this is like IZO coaching a against Draymond if they get to that matchup. Yeah, That's right. That's right. All Right, so you got Michigan State in this region? I think so. Michigan State's offense worries me, I'm not blind to to that, but I think I've doubted Michigan State the entire season basically.


And I, I I think I've seen enough to be like, yeah, they play great defense. They're all bought in. I think, I think J Richardson is a star and I do think as much as I was concerned about throughout the season, like do they have top end talent? You have a guy who can go get you one when you need it. I think he's that guy and yeah. And, and I, and I think Auburn will get tripped up somewhere along the line. And Iowa State, Khaw Gilbert being out is definitely significant. Yeah. Yeah. That was gonna be my question as a, as a college basketball casual, I watched probably five to six games at college ball a week until March starts. And then you, you ramp it up and you feel like, you know more after conference tournament week. I don't know anything about Iowa State. I don't know anything about I know they have. Okay. I know they have a great coach.


Yep. I know that they have a star who's gonna be injured. Tight shirts, Tj tight shirt, really tight Shirt Wear tight shirt. He tight looks like a foam. Is he gonna be thinking about how the Villanova colors will look on his body? Oh, is he maybe mined elsewhere, but also really how, how is Iowa State gonna be able to do without their star? I also will say that TJ Berg, Greg Guard is, is a phenomenal coach and I want him to keep coaching forever. But TJ Berger will be next. He's from Wisconsin, so, okay. So he is gonna Wisconsin, he's already got That on him. Yeah. So you Can't have em. Iowa State, there were times this season Iowa State looked like they could be national title. Good. Yeah, they were, they went to Maui. They had Auburn up like 18 at halftime I think it was. And obviously Auburn's the number one overall seed.


They, they, throughout the big 12 schedule, they, they have awesome wins. They, they, they've dealt with a bunch of injuries. They're, they're banged up. But I guess like the overall thought on Iowa State is they are, they're like a Houston's cousin almost like they, they play insane defense, but they also, even though defense is what they're known for, they have guys that can score the basketball. I loved Iowa State throughout the year. The injuries have taken a toll though. They've had dudes like get randomly sick and banged up and Yeah. And I don't know how healthy they are and I don't know if they've really like put it back together since then. So it would not, it would not, it would not surprise me if Iowa State, I have Iowa State, my three 16, I even play in Michigan State in the three 16.


But yeah, it wouldn't surprise, like I think Iowa State at their best is a team that is, that is national title. Good. All right. Put it that way. So Michigan State over Auburn in the Elite eight and then Michigan State gonna the final four. That's what I have. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I should say the final four, the next region Florida's. Yep. How, how did they print a bracket with No, what is that? South? That's the West? No, west the west Florida. Florida's playing incredible ball right now. They're, they're on fire. I don't know. I I don't know how I like, I it sounds stupid because it's a tournament and anyone could beat anyone. I just don't know how you deal with everything Florida could do.


Yeah. Because they have everything. They shoot threes, they have incredible size, they rebound the fuck outta the ball. It just feels like they're almost like a, a ramped up hyper version of Alabama, of what Alabama wants to be. I we'll get to Duke in a second, but I think Florida and Duke are the two teams that IIII honestly can't figure out how they lose before the Final four without them fucking it up themselves. Right. Like they just Yeah. If They play their best game, they're in the final game. Yeah. It's not even close. Right. They, they, they have answers. Like you said, they have answers for everything. There's no team that says, I like our matchup with Florida because we can do this. And they're not good at this. There's, there's just not, they, they have no weaknesses.


They have guard play, they have a rotating cast of big dudes. They play defense. They shoot threes. Everyone can shoot. Yeah. Everyone can shoot. They have like demoralizing dunkers. Yes. Like Elijah Martin will just shit all over you. And you're just like, well God damn. I thought, I thought we were kind of shut cutting into this lead a little bit. But I guess, I guess maybe not. That's a great point because it is, when you watch Florida, that is exactly what happens. It's like, oh, here's a logo three and then here's like a Yeah. A dunk on your two, your center in Power Forward. Yeah. In back to back Possessions. And then you, I mean the guards are the what makes them go with, with Martin and, and Walter Clayton and, and Will Richard, who's like a, you know, could just outta nowhere drop 30 points.


But then Conden is like, like Yeah, he, he's the dude that, that was at Bama, the Bama game. He had, I forget what he ended up with, but in the twenties or something, he was dominating Bama Florida's is playing insane basketball right now. And you know What else is demoralizing about Florida is when they, they just wheel their seven foot nine red shirt freshman who's not even playing. He Doesn't even play. Yeah. And he's the tallest human being you've ever seen. You're like, we don't need this guy. He Just walking around out there. They get size. They get size like in their back pocket. Yeah. I think that like do you think that helps him? Like where they just come out to warm up and he's just standing there? Yes. And you're looking at them definitely at him instead of the guys you're actually going to play against. Yeah. You're like, You're like, holy shit, this guy is not even playing. He's not even one of their best players.


When he said It's kind of fucked up that he doesn't play. I'm just say, I, we all wanna see him play. We all wanna see him out there. It's kind of fucked up that, that we all saw the video of him in the preseason and then they red shirt him. It's a cock tease. I wanted to see him out there and I Watched him walk. He looks like he's a healthy walker. He looks like he can move for a he Nine guy. The Edie move where he cut down the nets without a ladder. Oh, I love that. You know, he Was the world's tallest teenager. That's pretty cool. I think he was like seven foot four. That's Really cool. Yeah. Wow. But this, this is actually my, so with, with everything we said about Florida, how good they are. This actually is my group of death because I do think Maryland is Final Four caliber. I think St. John's, Texas Tech who we mentioned, and Colorado State's probably the hottest team outside of Florida.


And they're all in the bracket together. Yeah. I think, I think Maryland's probably the best four. Yeah. IIII think Texas Tech is definitely the best three. So in that regard, I, I would agree with you. I I also just think like though, if you're a Florida fan, you're not really worried about any of these teams. I think, I don't know how much, what, what's the read on Yukon? Like my, I'm, I, I, I said that I, I want UConn to win the first game because then I want everyone to be like, oh, watch out for Yukon, Florida will kill You. K. Yeah. I like those of us that have been watching all season. Like, know this Yukon team's just not good. No, they can't guard. And, and, and they don't. They, but the, the, the thing with Yukon though, you'll watch them, they'll be down like 15, they'll go on a run, they'll cut the lead to like six and they, they fucking have it.


And Dan Hurley's fucking chest bumping someone and I'm fucking, you know, Liam McNeely is like going crazy. Caravan Hits a three, Caravan hits a three. Like, I don't know, they, they get the juice flowing and you think that they have something and then you look up and they're playing like, fucking sorry, max, but like Villanova something or they're playing, you're like, what a, they're they're they're playing Georgetown and you're like, I mean, the fact that we're down to this team is kind of concerning boys. I, I don't think UConn. Yeah. Like I, I I was, I was curious though, like PFT what is as, as, as a self-proclaimed casual. Yeah. You see UConn in a bracket, do you think watch out the casuals watch across the country are talking themselves into Dan Hurley knows how to coach. I don't know. It's disrespectful that Yukon is an eight seat mark because they won, I don't know if you know this, they won the last two national championships and I think they covered every single game in both those tournaments.


That's true. And now you're just relegating them to an eight. You're throwing 'em out like the trash. Gimme a fucking break. I No, no. They stink. And caravan the, the, the shocking thing about watching Caravan this year is last year people were saying like top 10 pick top 15 pick in the NBA draft. Yeah. And it turns out he needs, it appears that he needs other guys that he can just worry about getting open. Yeah. When he has four other guys on the court who are better than everyone else's guys on the other side, he looks a lot better. Is that what you're Saying? Well, I'm saying that also like last year I thought that he was better off the dribble. Yeah. I thought that he was a better shock creator this year. He has just not been that at all. They also really miss, do you guys see the Cam Spencer clip of him just barking at kd?


Yeah. Like that's the guy. They don't have that guy who's like a Hurley on the court. And I, I've, I've held out hope for UConn this year that they were gonna, like, there's been moments like when they played St. John's twice, I was like, this is the moment they were up big against St. John's in stores and I was like, oh, here comes ucon. Yep. Even in the Big East champion or, or semifinals. It's like Yukon's going to beat Creighton, they're gonna go take down St. John's. It just isn't there. I have a bone to pick with you about Yukon though. Okay. You don't like Dan Hurley? No, I never said that. I said Dan Hurley's is, is an asshole and I think that's fair. Okay. But I think that's fair. I think I thought that was the whole point with No, that's fair. That is fair. He's like, but you, is Dan Hurley good for college basketball?


Yes. Okay, Good. Then for college basketball, Dan Hurley, when Dan Hurley loses three games in the Maui Invitational and then says, I'm never going back to Maui Invitational, he shits over one of the great things college basketball has going for it, which is the Maui Invitational, which I fucking love. Shut the fuck up Dan Hurley. But That, that's my also, that's why like, Shut the fuck up. But that's, yeah. Like, that's good college. That's why I love college basketball. But like, but that's part of the, that's that's, I'm, I thought this is a, my whole thing with Yukon and Dan Hurley was that I thought this was like a, a dance we're supposed to do. Yeah. Is Dan Hurley's an asshole? And then I, the pundit am supposed to be like, this guy's an asshole. And then UConn fans are supposed to be like, oh, he doesn't like, we don't, he doesn't like your as fair. You know. Fair. I thought that was the whole thing Because I, yeah. All right, so we're on the same page because I, I I'm Doing my job.


I'm A big believer that, like, one of the things about college basketball, because the, the, the, the rosters change every year, especially now with transfer portal coaches matter and the, the like, you know what I mean? Like the asshole coach is kind of getting phased out. Yes. Where we don't have the heim, we don't have the Huggins, we don't have the Coach k Dan Hurley to me is like, he's the torch bearer for that next generation of dickhead coaches. You need them. 'cause otherwise you, you're getting mad at like an 18-year-old that you've known for like two Months. I completely agree with you. I just can't. Okay. I can't. Yeah. You gotta, I I have to play my job. That's fair. Dan Hurley's the heel. That's fair. So I'm going to re react to the heel behavior Okay.


And say we're, we're on the same page And say Yeah. When you tell the ref I'm the best coach in the sport. Yep. You know, we're On the same page. I can't tell your back to me. I'm going to call you a douche bag. And then he's important to the ecosystem. But I do want him to be Yeah. He would've gone to the Lakers, like he definitely was a hundred percent going to do. And that was a very real thing that almost happened. For sure. I would be, I would've been upset that college basketball lost. Yeah. Lost him. So he's A heel so that your face as a pundit, right? I don't, I don't know. Yeah. If He loses, are you gonna take any pleasure in Yukon losing the first round? I, I won't take any pleasure. I don't know. I've enjoyed for as much as Yeah. Like the Dan Hurley antics. I don't always love, I I I do enjoy watching their team when they're good.


Yeah. Like, I think the offense they run is fucking awesome. Like last year's team was like, sex dude watching them play basketball. So, you know, like I I, I appreciate good basketball. This year's team is not good. And I just think like when they lose, it'll just be like another mediocre team dipping out in the tournament. Yeah. He knows how to coach an attorney Though. He does know how to coach in the tournament. I will say like if he, if he goes on, if he can like go on a run to the Sweet 16 Beat Florida, he'll, I mean obviously won two national titles. He has my respect for that. But like, that's a different level of like, god damn, this guy might be a magician. A Wizard. Yeah. You're wizard If you could take Beat Before Oh, if you could take this team and go on a deep run, you actually are. Yeah. That dude, You figured it out with college basketball. All right. So at the bottom of this bracket, we have the, the bill Self cal matchup, which I know people wanna hype up, but like, I feel like it's just a depressing matchup.


It's depressing both these teams. 'cause both these teams aren't good. Yeah. So it's just like, and I, I'm like, I'm closing my eyes. How I'm gonna bet this game is I'm closing my eyes and I'm just gonna try to figure out which one of these two I'm gonna like, visualize standing in a hallway after the game doing a CBS interview being like, we just didn't have the guys This year. This is why the, the Patriots and Giants are playing and they're just showing like Super Bowl highlights of like, you know, the times that they met and this like, but it's modern day Patriots versus Modern Day Giants. Right. Like, what are we, you know? Yeah. This isn't it. So I, I don't know who's gonna win that game, but I, I hope St. John's gets this sweet 16. 'cause I do like Rick Pat and Rick Pitino is going for Rothstein told us he's, he's personally trying to get Kalari off of his resume by taking a fourth team to a final four Cal.


And he are the only two to take three teams to a final four. Okay. So he would then he would be the fourth. It would no longer be Patino and Cal did it. That's right. And he might have to go go through Cal to do it. It would be Patino Did it. Wow. Yeah. St John's is, what a story, man. What a story. They, they are so fun to watch. I can't get enough of it. I I am fully bought in on this team, even though Yeah. Like the offense isn't great. And you pointed, you pointed out the Ken PO thing. Their offense is like, what, in the sixties or something? They just can't shoot. They can't shoot. They Get rebounds Every time They do hit a three though. It feels like it's worth like 10 points. I Know. It's Like, oh my God. They hit one and They got the technical on Saturday night for, for the, for the Pistols. But they're so comfortable they, they know they can't shoot though.


That's what helps them is that they're, they're aware of it. It's not, they're not like a team. Like, like, we'll we'll get to Wisconsin in a second, but like Wisconsin, I, it's a bad example 'cause Wisconsin is a good shooting team, but like Wisconsin, the Big 10 tournament was just missing. And they're just like, we're just gonna keep shooting and keep Miss You're not gonna see that at St. John's. Like if St. John's is brick and threes, they're not gonna put up 30 threes. They're gonna be like, all right. We just, they're, we're not gonna make threes tonight. But yeah, they're, they're, they're comfortable being down 15. They're comfortable with chaos. They're comfortable. I think like when the, when these NCA tournament games go to like the under eight timeout and it's a three point game and assholes start getting tight and like the energy in the room is, is building and there's something here going on. I think St. John's gonna be really comfortable in that environment. Yeah.


So I understand all of the concerns about St. John's, but I I I'm fully bought in on Rick Pitino, the Rick Pitino renaissance. Yeah. And I'm bought in on this being a matchup of Calvers Patino. Yeah. I think it has to be. I I, I'm with you. I gotta rig it. You have to rig this. You have to it. If you have to ensure us of one second round matchup, it has to be Arkansas St. John's. Although it was very funny during the Bracket Busters selection that we took today, roh was on Pat Bev's team. Oh, Arkansas was still on the board. Mm. And then he selected like some random ass team. Then Arkansas went off the next one afterwards. Yeah. Pat Bev's not gonna be happy about that. I have to see Cal versus St versus Rick Pitino. Yeah. Have to seat. I need Pitino wearing the white suit for the matchup against, against Cal too.


What about Drake? What about him? What about Drake? Say Drake. Drake, Here's what's gonna happen with Drake. Certified lover. Boy Certified. I'm gonna bet on I'm certified spread aile. I'm, I'm gonna bet on Drake. And they're going to be up for the majority of this game. Then they're gonna melt down in the last five minutes where they can't score a bucket. And I'm be like, I did it again. Yeah. Yeah. We did it again boys. It Is a completely different Drake team. It is different coach, different team. Same Drake probably Though. I just think that it's really tough when you play games at that pace and then you have like a four minute shooting spell. Yeah. Where you just can't hit a shot. It's like, God damn it, where'd that game just go? What is your plan B is the question I have for basically every team.


But, you know, that's why you get excited about the Floridas and the Dukes and the, the, the top of the teams is they've demonstrated that they can win games at different styles and when they're hot and when they're not. And Slug Fest and, and yada yada, Drake, I don't know. They, they, they, they play as slow. They play the slowest. Right. The number one slowest team in college basketball. I think 15. They a, they're the only team in the country to average less than 60 possessions a game. And Missouri Missouri's reeling a little bit. I'm, I'm fascinated. The SEC very much deserving of the reputation it got this year. But I'm there, there does seem to be a sense that like all these, these middle of the road SEC teams, like your Missouri's and your, your Oklahomas say and your old misses. There's a, there's a thought that like, once they get outta the SEC schedule and they have a little room to breathe, they're gonna just go back to dominating everybody.


And I don't know if that's gonna be true or not. I'm fascinated by, I'm more interested in, in, when you talk about like the, how the, the SE C's gonna do in the tournament. I'm less interested in like, is it going to be Auburn, Florida, Tennessee Bama, you know, like those teams in the Final Four. And I'm more curious like the middle of the pack teams that that swear, the only reason they're losing these games is 'cause they're also playing like other heavy hitter teams. Right. So now you get a Missouri team that has been struggling down the stretch, but, you know, let's see what they're made of against Drake. I don't, I think that's gonna be an awesome game. Yeah. But Drake will probably lose like they always Do. Yeah, I do too. And I, I, I don't know. I want Drake to win just 'cause I keep, I feel like every year I'm like, oh, Drake, they could do this. Yeah. They just, and they're really well coached.

And now here's Mark Titus. Alright, so in this, so if not Florida, is it St. John's or is it Maryland? I mean Maryland. I like Maryland a lot. I think they're super talented. I do think like having the depth that they have does hurt in the, in the NCAA tournament where you can get these stupid games where a guy gets two fouls, you know, five minutes in and you're just like, what the fuck? Yeah. What's the plan? Now? I I think it might be Texas Tech, if not Florida, Texas Tech is, you're so up. They're they JT top and plus shooters is the, is the, is the recipe. I I, I ended up, I filled out my bracket last night on my show live. I, I put St.


John's in the final four because, and maybe you guys can help me out with this. You're better at the content game than I am. I said in the preseason, when I was doing final four picks, I, I picked I think Bama, who was preseason number two. I picked Yukon who was like preseason number three. I picked, I think I picked Duke who was like in the top 10. But you know, Cooper Flagg was going there and I was like, that would I, I I'm gonna pick Duke. So that wasn't really going out on a limb. And then the one like, I'm gonna put my neck out a little bit was St. John's. I said St. John's is the final four in the preseason. Now I'm staring at the bracket and they're in Florida's region. And I'm like, it's Florida. It's obviously fucking Florida. Right. But I said in November, St. John's to the final four, what do I do? Do I double down and say, I said in November it was St.


John's and, and God damn it, I met it. Or do I you double down or do I diversify the tax That are out there out There? No, here's what you do. You Max, what he doing? You double down because if you're right, then you're like, I'm a fucking genius. Yeah. I told you. And you get to claim yourself as being like the number one St. John's believer. Okay. And if you're wrong, then you just find something to bitch about. Like something unfair that happened. They got A bad draw That made St. John's bad Draw lose That, that game. Okay. 'cause that's what I settled on last night. Yeah. I picked St. John's as the final four. I do believe in that. That wasn't just like a, I said a November type thing. I do believe this St. John's team is special and, and You Could also do, this is what Stephen A. Smith is really good at. If they lose then you can turn it on them. Be like, they let me down. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's a good point.


You Also would be, so you also would be going up against another Ken Palm stat that in the 64 team era, there have been 36 teams to enter the tournament as a one or two seed that weren't ranked in the preseason AP poll. And they have a combined zero final four appearance. Oof St. John's in Michigan State Are those teams this year they were not ranked in the pre-season AP top 25. They're one, there are two seeds. So you could be like, you know what, I picked them both. Yeah. But if you get this right though, you, you are The first. I was the guy who believed Yeah, you Beat the Ken Palms. Yeah, you're right. I beat the Ken. So It's even more A luxury 'cause I mean that is how these things work is that you do the no one, you know, you draw the line, you're like, no one below this line.


And then 2014 Yukon happens and you, and instead of being like it screws everything up, instead of taking the whole formula and throwing it into the garbage, you just move the line down. Yeah, yeah. But the, that one is one that's floating around right now. And it, I mean it makes sense like the, I know we make fun of the preseason polls, but it is largely based on overall talent. Yeah. Who's got the talent, right? It's like, but St. John's was like 26, right? Like they were right outside. I don't know. They were, they might've been. And I think Rutgers got in over 'em. I think Ru, I think St. John's was like St. John's should have been ranked in the preseason. Rutgers Had just insane amount of talent at the top. Yeah. Yeah. Two lottery picks. Two lottery picks. Anyway, wait, max is looking it up right now. Let's see, this is Preseason. Where was STS in the preseason Max? I googled preseason really bad at Google Season.


I'm not that bad. I'll just do it myself. You're really bad at it. Alright, here we go. What? He's got it. St. John's isn't there. They're not ranked right. Confirm that. What was the others Receiving votes? Wisconsin, Colorado. UCLA St. John's four. Oh, so they were 29th. It's crazy. Auburn, they 20 Googling. Wait, but Auburn wasn't in the top 25. Oh, They were 27 or they got 27 votes. Wait, wait, Is that this year? This can't be this year. No, I think it is. Yeah. Kansas, Bama, Yukon, Houston. Oh wow. That's this year. No Auburn. Auburn there, There. What the fuck? Why is Auburn at the end too? They Just got extra votes.


They just got extra votes. Oh, There You go. Yeah. Alright. So St. John's and Michigan State are the two that follow under that. Last year Iowa State was, was a two seed not ranked in the preseason. They went to the Sweet 16. Yeah. So I'll all the, I'll stick with St. John's to the, to the Final four and like you said, PFT if I'm right, I just become the guy who believed in St. John's. Yeah. And I think, yeah, I think I need to be part of the you gotta do it. The national championship celebration. I would agree. Agree, agree. So, okay. What about East? East Duke? I'll start with Duke. I, I believe Duke is the best team in the country. I believe Duke has no weaknesses. I believe Duke has three. There's three things you might be slightly concerned with Duke.


It's, it's, they rely heavily on freshmen. It's obviously the health of Cooper Flag and Malik Brown. Malik Brown's out Maek Brown's just Gonna be out. He's not gonna be, he's gonna be out, I don't think. I don't but strap it Up. Dr. Dan said that he just strap it up though having that he's gonna have to have surgery. What about next man up? He's a defender. Just strap It up. I know he's an important defender. Just strap it up and let him. But yeah, Cooper flags ankle like you. I don't know. It looked pretty bad to me, but I assume he's gonna, he said he was gonna, he wanted to play apparently like in the a CCC championship. Yeah. He's probably not gonna play against the 16. I don't know what they'll do for the, the second round game. But then the a CC, that, that is a, on a scale of one to 10, it's like a five of a four or five of a concern for me that the A CC was weaker this year.


I think it's being a little bit overblown that Duke played nobody. I think Louisville and Clemson are better than people realize. I think Duke did play Auburn and beat them. Yep. Beat them pretty easily. They Play Alabama too. No, But yeah, I, I think they, they played at Arizona, I think, and just fucking smoked Arizona in Tucson. They Kicked the shit out of Illinois. I know Illinois was, they kicked the shit out of Illinois Pretty, Was pretty down At that point. So I think this idea that like Duke hasn't played anybody with a pulse is just wrong. But I will, I will at least admit that they have not played, you know, your, the, the Floridas and the bas and the like, you know, they haven't played those teams over and over and over anyway. I I, I have Duke winning the national championship because I think Duke is, I think Duke is in a position when I was taught, when I was making the, the, the reference to 2015 earlier, and I said, this tournament feels like the 2015 tournament.


I think Duke more than any other one, seed feels to me like the, the, the equivalent of that Kentucky team where yes, of course they can lose. But I think that, I think that they're a little bit better than every other team in this field. So I, I'm, I I, I have Duke coming out of the east and I have Duke winning the national championship and I think Cooper Flagg has had, I, I don't, I, for some reason he, the, the hype is somehow there, but it's also, I feel like it's not as great as it should be for this kid. 'cause he is unfucking believable. He had an, an insane amount of hype coming in. He's delivered on all of it. He leads Duke in every single category. He does everything there is to do on a basketball court. Well, Do you know what it is?


I don't know why. I think the hype went down a little because the a CC is not good. So it's like he wasn't playing top 25 matchups week in and week out. And then he slipped in that game against Kentucky. He slipped early in the season and that was pretty much it Was done in the last possession. Yeah. He's a, if you haven't watched Cooper Flagg, he's an incredible basketball player. Guy sweats a lot. He does sweat a lot. He sweats a lot. Yeah. His, and he slips and his mom likes to talk shit. I love that from her. Yeah. That was such an awesome statement. The, the one in Carolina, the Duncan, she's on your fucking head. Yeah. And then when she apologized and then everyone was like, oh shit, she's apologizing. And then she was like two middle fingers. Yeah. For Absolutely nothing. P ft.


Let me ask you this 'cause, 'cause Big Cat is compromised and he can't give a straight answer. I agree. Is it possible, I already said they're gonna win it all, by the Way, is it possible for Duke to be likable? No. No. I don't think it's possible for 'em to be likable. I think it's possible for them to be less hateable. Okay. And this is, this is one of the less hateable Duke teams. Yeah. I think this is a pretty neutral one as far as Duke goes. And that almost makes them likable Because I, what I said about UConns team last year, where I said like, like you asked me what I, am I gonna, am I cheering for their downfall? And I was like, I, I honestly can't, 'cause I enjoy watching them so much. I feel I'm sort of starting to feel that way about this Duke team. And it's very bizarre because yeah. I'm not necessarily rooting for them to win. I am, I'll be honest, I'll be transparent. I want them to get to the Final four.


'cause I think it's great for the sport if they make it there. And we do get the like 2015 Kentucky thing where it's like you have the number one pick and the best player in the country leading this young team and, and you know, maybe they fuck it up, maybe they don't. I think that's fascinating. But yeah, I I I'm slowly like enjoying watching them play and I don't want to, I don't want them to stop playing. But then also, I don't want Duke to win the national championship. I don't know how to reconcile those two Thoughts. Yeah. I want them to give us a reason to hate them. Yeah. Yeah. The problem is they're, they're not doing that. And it's, it's disappointing for the sport. I I don't know if I told you this Titus, but I grew up, I I liked both UNC and Duke when I was a kid. Oh really? In my family. 'cause my parents were from, my grandparents were from North Carolina and they were Tar Heels fans.


And then Grant Hill was my preschool teacher in Northern Virginia. So then when he goes to Duke now I gotta a route for Duke too. And it was a very confusing time until I learned what a dickhead coach K was. And then I'm like, oh, this is a no brainer. U would c better colors, nicer people. Let's root for UNC. And then now that there's no coach K, it's like I need a reason to be reminded of my hatred. But it, but the, if you watch the Carolina Duke game, that was like living in Bizaro world because the, the identities of both of those Yeah. Programs have been flipped. Yeah. Carolina was like flopping all over the court trying to draw fouls on Cooper flag. Duke is the program that now has like all the five stars in the NBA players and Carolina's got these unheralded guys. Yeah. And we don't know if they're gonna make the NBA or not.


And they're just trying to like grid out a win. It was, you know what it is, it blew my mind. We need con k nipple to step up and like hit someone in the balls. Yeah. That's really the only answer. It's not gonna be Cooper Flag Con kniple More shots of Coach K in the crowd maybe. Yeah. You show him like smiling and I'll be like, okay, fuck, this guy Needs to do something fucked up in an NBA game When people that will get me going. When people are like, oh man, I wish we didn't have the one and done rule. I, I'm like, well that's bullshit because kids should be able to go earn a living and if they're good enough to be in the NBA, they should be in the NBA. But part of me is like, I kind of miss, I wish we had three years in college basketball just so I could get my hate up for Duke. Yeah. Because that is, they they're, it's so transient now.


Yeah. You know, it's in and out where, and again, I think it, I think more than anything what you're saying Titus about this Duke team is they just didn't it what's the most memorable game they played in this year? Yeah. They were just so much better than everyone. They, they, they Destroyed Everybody except Clemson beat him. But like, usually you have at least a couple memories from like deep in January or February where it's like, oh, duke went to Wake Forest. Right. And and they tripped someone and then they won a bullshit way or Yeah. You know, Now all we've got is White Lotus. That's it. That's the only, that's the only thing about Duke that's been memorable this year. I Saw that. I I I But I'm not caught up. Okay. I won't say. Yeah, There's like a Duke. Yeah. There's A guy from Duke shot.


Right. He's got a fucking heart And his wife's UNC Oh Yeahinteresting. She's peeled out. Yeah. I mean I, I I think so. What else in this bracket? I agree with you. I think Duke's gonna win it all. I think Yeah. Duke's the most talented team by far in the country. It doesn't always shake out though. If, if this was the NBA in no seven game series, I would bet my house that Duke would win it all. Yeah. Crazy shit can happen. Bets your House game. This would be a bet. My house bracket. Bracket. Yeah. But What, what about the bottom half? Tripped up, I guess Wisconsin is, we got screwed but I I I Montana's ass. That's the Thing. So Montana Certified ass. You're fine. So we got, we got screwed in the location. I would rather play Montana than Lipscomb. Yeah. Lipscomb iss like, you're right about that Kind Of, kind of plucky Montana.


I know they can shoot threes, but they've played two power four teams. They got fucking, they Got fucking smoked. Dude, you're, you're, you're fine there. BYU is an interest. B-Y-U-V-C-U would be interesting. I think VCU Might win that game. VCU might win that game. They're just so Annoying. They are annoying. You're not a BYU lever. I said I I actually picked BYU to be Wisconsin so that's fine. I picked BYU to be VCU in Wisconsin. But I I, I said on my show last night that I-B-Y-U-V-C-U-I want, I want BYU to just play all time offense and have VCU guardmen em and annoy him. Yeah. And I think that, and then if VVCU gets a stop, they get like two points. And when I say VCU u's annoying, I just want to be on the record. 'cause I don't want Dukes as VCU guy to come after me and and prison fuck me. Annoying.


Annoying. In a good Way. In a good way. You Don't wanna play. Like they're just, they annoy they're opponent. They're Not fun to play against. Right. But yeah, BYU Wisconsin, BYU gets past VCU. That's a sexy matchup. Yeah. That's a, that's a very fuckable matchup. That's a lot of offense. A lot of, a lot of threes. I like Wisconsin draw though. I like this Wisconsin team. You know that Dan. Yeah, You do. I think this is not a, if, if you have not been paying attention to Wisconsin this year, this is not your, your dad's badgers. Nope. This is a completely retooled Wisconsin team and terrible showing in the Big 10 tournament. Brutal What? Wisconsin basketball is this Year. In the final, In the final. I meant. Yeah. That's what Meant the and that was the funniest part. I everyone being like, this team is ass. That's what I meant. The Final three Games. But if you, if, if that was your introduction with this Wisconsin team Yes. And you turn it on and they're brick threes, you're just like, like God damnit Not again with Wisconsin, they're a completely different team and I have to believe that they're gonna make shots in the tournament.


Yeah, if you Would take Tanja and just put 'em in just a, like a black jersey with no, no letters on it. No numbers on it. How Long do you think it would take for you to guess what School he went to? That he played it with college? Oh my God. I think he'd probably be like, yeah, 9,364 Teams. I'd probably be well into the one fifties Yeah. Before I hit. But they're, they're fun and they, they have like a solid nine nine guys and you know, Blackwell's awesome Klesitz clutch, you know, I think Crow and Nolan Winter, they got both got called out early in the season for being soft and they played a lot better. I they just need to make it to Sweet 16. Yeah. If they make it to Sweet 16, then I'm on the, then I'm like, I said this before, I said this like a month ago.


Get to Sweet 16. Then there's obviously I'll be devastated if they lose in the Sweet 16, especially to Alabama. But I understand the tournament crazy shit happens. Like once you get to that point, it's like anything can happen. So I, it it, it takes a little, little bit of this sting out, but if they lose in the first or second round, I'll be devastated If, if we get BYU Wisconsin and then we get whoever wins that game plays Bama. That's just a lot of, a lot of fun. Basketball. Yeah. A lot of offense. A lot of fun. I What do you think About Ba BAA's Tough to figure out. Man, they're tough. They, they, they run the Bama shit. They, it's, it's the same old Bama of spamming threes and layups and, and Mark Sears is there and Grant Ellison's there. Although what's what's, what's his deal?


I have an an Update on him. Dunno, he's getting a knee, he's getting his knee looked at as we speak. They can't, they, they don't shoot as well as they need to. They Were so last year, like, 'cause I think, you know, we do that as fans where we're like, oh, this is the same team. Last year they obviously went to the final four. They were 19th in the country in three point shooting. Yeah. This year they're a hundred 14th. Right. And their whole thing is that three is more than two. So we're gonna take threes. Three is only more than two. If you make the three, you gotta make 'em. If you miss the three, it is not more than two. And they, they just, they they get stubborn. And that's, that's always when, when it goes wrong for Alabama in the tournament with Nate Oats, it always looks the exact same way. And it's just them being stubborn, them being like a a, you know, going back to the Plan B thing of like, they don't have a plan B.


It's like, we are built to shoot threes. We're not making threes. It doesn't matter. We're gonna keep shooting them. And Then, and the mid-range is coached out of them. It's completely comes outta. You see them standing there with an open midrange dude and they'll pass it up. I, in 23 I think it was, yeah, that was the San Diego state team. They played San Diego State. They were the number one overall seed. I lost my fucking mind. I picked Bama to win it all and I'm watching them play San Diego State. And San Diego State had the rim protector. I think it was Mensa was his name. Yeah. The seven footer and San Diego State. It was like so obvious what they were doing. They were just running out to the three point line funneling everything to the rim protector. Alabama, if they would've taken mid range shots would've been wide open the entire game. Just would not do it. Yep. Would not do it Wouldn't take a single mid range shot. And that's why they lost I I don't know.


They they, they have the, the, I think they have the players. I think there, there have been moments where Alabama feels like they're turning a corner and they are hitting shots. But I, I don't trust that six games. They're gonna put that together and they're gonna make shots for six straight games. They just, their defense, they haven't been that to defense. It's not that good. Their defense isn't as good as it should be either. So when they, they have that guy LeBaron Lon making shots, then they can beat anybody, I think. Right. If it's go, if it's going like Grant Nelson's playing well and then also Lon is able to step up and score, then they're a very good team. But yeah, there's another team. Is it, is it Baylor? So they're really good from three, but they suck at shooting foul shots. Right. Liberty's that way for sure. Yeah. I don't know if that was here. Thinking enough too. But Baylor might be, Baylor is too.


I think Bay is Like that too. Yeah. Liberty is to to Liberty's comical. I I was, I was like reading up on them. They they are fifth in the country and three point shooting in like 300 something in free throw shooting. Yeah. So it's like exactly what you said about Baylor. But I Kind of like Oregon. I think Daniel Altman's a and and and they have their seven footer Biddle, who's, he's a tough one to look at, but he's good. Yeah. He's, they, they, they play great defense. A Akron is a, was a school that I was excited about. Like, before the bracket came out, I thought, I'm gonna pick Akron to win a game. Arizona is a horrendous matchup. Yeah. Hor they're just, they're just basically better Akron. They, they play the exact same styles, they have the same philosophies and Arizona has better players. Yeah.


So I hate that matchup for Akron. So Duke coming outta this region. Yeah. I like Duke. And you have BYU who wins BYU Alabama. I, I ultimately went Bama, but I think that's gonna be a track me in a fun game. But yeah, I went a little chalky. Okay. I went chalky with the lead eight and then yeah, I got Duke over Bama. All right. Last one. Midwest Houston, they're really fucking good. They're really, really fucking good man. Really fucking, but They also have to play possibly Gonzaga who's a top 10 Kenpom team. And Mark Few has made like a thousand sweet sixteens in a row. Yeah, right. Houston has, I've been like a Houston critic a little bit through the years.


Mostly just 'cause they, they always are, they always look great in the regular season. But there for a while, they're playing in the American now that they've joined the Big 12, they're absolutely dominating the big 12. They stepped into what was the best conference in college basketball and just fucking own that conference. Now I, I think this Houston team's as good as any Houston team's been in this stretch that Kel and Samson had. They, they, they can score. They, they have multiple guys who can score. Like Malik Wilson's like a dude that just is a, is a bucket outta nowhere. LJ Crier is like the best scorer. Yuan's a but, but they like, Wilson's like the microwave guy of like, if you wanna be concerned about Houston, but you're, you're worried that you need a guy that can just go get you one. They have an answer for that. They have an answer for, you know, three point shooting. They have great point guard play.


They obviously play just phenomenal defense. I I really, really, really love Houston. So yeah, I I think Houston finally gets a breakthrough. They, and, and, and makes the final four. They made one in 2021, but I don't count that one. Yeah, I don't Count. And you and, and you were right. So there four losses on the season. They lost Auburn in the second game of the season, early November, which Came down to the wire. It was, it was like a minute left. We need to stop here. Like, I think it was like tied with a minute left or Yeah. Then they lost an OT to Alabama, OT to San Diego State and OT to Texas Tech. Yeah. Pretty good. So they've lost one game in regulation. And, and you remember the Kansas game in, in Allen Fieldhouse? Oh yeah. When Oh yeah. When they were, it was, they were dead. They, they, they are those Houston and St.


John's are the two teams that just will not die. They will, they, when the clock hits zero and you think you've beat them, you better make damn sure you, you've actually beat them. Get the, get the hell outta the arena. Take your win and, and get outta there. Because number, if there is 1.1 second on the clock, they are still alive. They, they, I don't know. They, you can't put away either one of those teams. And I lo I love Houston for that reason. So Talk to me about Gonzaga because a, as a casual Yeah. I gotta admit Gonzaga until the conference tournament, not a team I was ever interested in watching this year and conference play. So all I know about Gonzaga is basically what Big Cat said, which is they're always winning in March. They're always winning in March. They, they always go to the Sweet 16, at the very least.


Never been to final football. They got never been to Final Four. They got screwed on their seating Last year. I remember being out on Gonzaga as the calendar turned to March, really like mid-February, I'd say they put it together, started playing really, really well. They go back to the Sweet 16 by beating the fuck outta Kansas in the second round. They brought a lot of those dudes back and I was really high on Gonzaga entering the season. They opened the season beating the piss out of Baylor. That was, that was night one of college basketball season. That was like the big game. And they won by like 40, I think it was like literally 40. Yeah. But then since then, they've just kind of been uninspiring. They, they had a big lead on Kentucky and squander that in, in West Coast conference. They, they've been just kind of like St. Mary's won the conference. They lost, they lost twice.


Twice. The St. Mary's. Yeah. They don't play, they don't have a rim protector. They don't play great defense. I think the offense, like the shooting comes and goes the three point shooting, they still have dudes that can play. They still have Mark view who knows how to coach in this tournament. They still have, they still have a mhar. I think there is a world where Gonzaga does pull the upset over Houston. I think that's gonna be a great game. But I, I don't love this Gonzaga team as much as I've loved Gonzaga teams in the past. Yeah. Alright. Let's put it that way. Illinois. Talk to me about Illinois. Yep. Because I think from what I've seen at Illinois, they've been really, really good. Or they've been getting the shit kicked outta Them. Illinois is in my estimation, and then there's probably a lot of teams you could say this about, but when, if, if you were to say this phrase to me, I would, I would think of Illinois immediately.


They are the make shots team at the NCA tournament Make shots team Where when they're making shots, you're like, who's gonna beat these guys? They're the best team ever. When they're not making shots, you're like, this team is dog shit. This team is absolute dog shit. So Illinois's whole thing is they they are, they're doing what Bama they're taking the Bama approach and they're like, we're just gonna shoot a bunch of threes. And they just simply do not make threes. They're shooting like a little over 30% from the three point line, but they are just gonna keep jacking 'em up. I I, I went to the Ohio State Illinois game in Champagne and I sat behind the Ohio State bench and, and the thing that stood out to me when the, when the ball gets tipped off, like immediately it was, it was, it was obvious that Illinois is like two or three inches taller at every, at every position.


They just had. Like ya Jonas is their, their, he's gonna be a lottery pickers their point guard. He is like six, six plays like a European is, is under control at all times, knows how to find the open man. They got the seven footer Big Z at, at Arkansas. His brother is is at Illinois. They, they have a bunch of big dudes. They're just like, yeah, they're long and tall and they do nothing with it. And they all just like hang out at the three point line and shoot threes. And I was like, why are they doing this? This is so fucking stupid. Why are they not getting inside and taking advantage of their heights? So that's, that's the report on Illinois is, I think like there was one game, I think it was at Oregon where they were hitting everything and they looked like the best team in the country. Yep. But then, you know, against Duke they lose by 40.


It, I, they are as volatile as it gets. I who, you know, flip a coin and if, if you're someone that wants to believe in Illinois, flip a coin and you know that that's, that's as good of an indicator as any as to whether or not they're gonna be hit shot. The best way to sum up Illinois and I I'm pretty sure the status. Correct. Someone told it to me and, and it, even if it's not correct, it makes sense for Illinois, their average. That's right. Average, average margin for, for a victory is 15 points. Their average margin of defeat is 15 points. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. That's it. Yeah. You know what, I think I'm gonna believe in Illinois And I can just about guarantee you they could do it. Yeah. Every single win look, just go straight to the three point shooting. Yeah. And then it's like, oh, they went 11 for 24. They probably won that game. Yeah. Oh, this game. They went four for 26. They probably lost that game.


Yeah. That, that's really all it is with them. Yeah. Just be a Believer in Illinois looking At it right now, just going down the stretch. They lost by 14 to Michigan State. They lost by 21 to Wisconsin. They lost by like 50 to Duke and they turn around and beat Iowa by 20, beat Michigan. Michigan By 20. That's crazy. Beat in the Big 10 tournament. They beat Iowa by, by, you know, 12, then they lost to Maryland by 20. That's just what they do. I like it. Yeah. They're fun. I want, so they fun. So if I had to, if you said like, what if you could just, you know, snap your fingers and be like, that matchup happens Illinois, Kentucky. I knew that. That would be so fun. So fun needed. That would Be awesome. And then also maybe Kentucky, Tennessee.


Yeah. Tennessee beat Kentucky twice this year. But yeah, if that matchup happens, I think that is, yeah. Kentucky, I, I know that Tennessee already beat him twice, but I, I think Kentucky is, is is another team that like lo they, they don't guard anybody that that's what worries me. And they, they are really injured. They're, they're seemingly every guy that's played for them this year has gotten hurt. But Kentucky's a ton of fun and they, they push tempo and they score a ton of points and, and have a bunch of guys that can beat you. So I, I like Kentucky a lot. So you have Houston outta this region? I have Houston outta this region, so. Oh, What about Purdue? High Point. We, what was the source you had Source inside? Well, I don't wanna say who it was from or giveaway who it could be from, but it was a source. There's a, a source that I have has sources inside High Point.


And they said that Purdue was the one matchup that they did not want. Yeah. Mm. Looking ahead at the tournament, it said, okay, we can deal, you know, with a lot of these other three seeds, four seeds, that sort of thing. But Purdue was the one Matchup nightmare. Yeah. Neither team plays defense very well. I I think it's, it's kind of what I said about the Akron Arizona matchup where it's like, you, you would think that Akron playing against a team that, that likes to play uptempo is a good thing for them. 'cause they play uptempo. I actually see it as the opposite. It's like the, the way those teams win is they bring a style to the table that the other team isn't comfortable with. And I think that's what High Point Purdue is going to be is that High Point is a, that their offense is great.


Their defense is not, I think Purdue's you could say the same thing. Like when their offense gets going, they, they look pretty good, but they're never gonna be great defensively. And I think Braden Smith is just gonna control this entire game. This is just gonna be a Brad Smith masterclass of controlling the tempo and everything. So. Oh Yeah. I just got a text. Breaking moves. Breaking moves. Just count a text. You guys can tell me who this text was from. I'll tell you what it says. Okay. Colorado State is a lineage Play A lineage play A lineage play. Alright. That Seems like Rothstein.


That means that's your entire lineage. Your your your family tree. Oh. Oh, that's finer. That's finer. That's Stu Finer. He just texted me. Colorado State is a lineage play That is finer. That is one Stu finer Colorado State. Your entire Family tree. Oh Yeah, You got it too. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't mention it when we were talking about the West, but Colorado State Memphis is gonna be a fucking banger. That PJ Haggerty versus Nick Clifford. Yep. If you don't know anything about Colorado State, they got a dude that nine of the last 12 games has scored 20 plus points. Memphis has PJ Haggerty who is just a fucking bucket. Like he, I don't know, I don't know how else to describe the guy. He just, he he's, he's incredible scorer that matchup and the Donovan Dent Cam Jones matchup with Marquette, New Mexico.


Those are the two that I circled as like, don't care who wins, but God, that's Gonna be fun to watch. It's gonna be fun basketball. It's gonna be fun. Basketball. Yeah. So Lineage play. Huh? Lineage Play. So Duke, Houston. Yeah. Then we have Did you go Florida? St. John's? You went to St I went to St. John's. St. John's had to St. John's. And then I went Michigan State. That's my final four. Yeah. Copying piece of shit. Oh really? Yeah. That's okay. And then I did Duke over St. John's. Okay. And I think Rick Pitino who said he put the white suit away for the season. I don't believe him. Ooh. I don't believe him. I think if, if St. John's makes the final four, I think we see it. Okay. I hope you're right.


Last thing I wanna do with you Titus Rollback question R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo code take 20% off your first purchase. QIPs polos hoodies, joggers shorts Rollback dot com. Promo code. Take go right now let's do a quick ranking of the windows for the people.


Okay. Yeah. Lemme look at 'em. I, I, I I I'm prep so I'm not just springing on everyone. Okay. I just, it popped in my head that this would be a fun exercise ranking in the window. So obviously we had the first, we'll rank 'em the, the Eastern standard time. The 1215 to 4 35 window on Thursday, the night window. Let's look. Okay. Max fill in with your, with your bracket thoughts real quick. Why are you wearing a headband? I don't know. A DD What Kinda, Well we look, go ahead and fill in your bracket thoughts. You and memes talk amongst yourselves while we look and do our research on this. I Don't have much thoughts. I do have talking Villano Villanova head coaching search. Yeah. What? Hell, if that's what you want. Yeah, let's hear That.


I, Ryan Odom is the top of my big board. I really think that he's gonna be the guy to get Villanova to the next step. There was some talks from Mick Cronin today. I don't think that I want Mick Cronin. People were upset about that. I said Todd Golden yesterday. I still think that there's a chance there. We have money. We have Lots of money. They're upset 'cause they think that have You're delusional. Correct. Is that what you mean? Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Yep. Chris Collins, I think is a blunt. I think that he's probably gonna be the one that gets hired. Wait, he is a What? Blunt? He's just a little blunt to me. I don't think that he's gonna be really exciting. I've heard that Porter Moser is gaining more and more steam, which I think I would be pretty, I think I would be excited about Porter Moser, but I'm not exactly sure.


Because, you know, he is kind of a one hit wonder at Loyola Chicago. He's been in Oklahoma for a couple years now. This is the first time in the tournament. You want me to keep going? Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Keep, keep going, keep going, keep going. You're doing good job. A little petino. That would just, I would like that just because it's fun. Like St. John's Villanova to, you know, OG Big East Basketball Programs. I have my Answers. All right. I'm done. Okay. I think Friday night is by far the best. Friday night you got Marquette verse New Mexico, which we talked about. Illinois versus Texas or Xavier. You got Yukon, Oklahoma, Akron, Arizona. I think Arizona. Well Arizona.


Easily Arizona. But it'll be fun to watch. I think Arizona will be up like seven to 10 the whole game. And then Troy, Kentucky. Like those are some really good, good games Friday night. Yeah. So that would be my one, one. I got, I'm looking at Thursday afternoon right now. I might go Thursday afternoon as well. Really? I good. I think the early slate of, of Creighton, Louisville, we're starting off with a banger. High point. Perdue should be a lot of offers. Offense, offense. That fun's a of fun. That'd be fun. I do think Montana is ass and Wisconsin will win easily. So that one's not good. Houston's not good. The Houston game. I mean, I think McNees Clemson is going to be a great game. I think V-C-U-B-Y-U is a great game and I think Gonzaga Georgia is gonna be a great game. Okay. I might go early. I think the opening slate is the, I think the schedule maker's got it right.


Yeah. I I think that Thursday they bookend it. My favorite window is Thursday through Thursday at like 11 through Friday at like 11:30 PM Mm. That is the sweet spot. That's your, you're God. Right? Well Also, I mean, Thursday night we got Arkansas and Kansas. Yeah. I like though that pretty good. There's, there's some fun offense on Friday night that, that I'm like Yeah. Because that's when you start to run outta gas mentally. And You need to, you need to pick me up. You need some Good, you need to pick me up. Yeah. You don't, you don't want to have it be like a bunch of two fifteens or one sixteens, Although it is electric when it gets close. That's true. That's true. Yeah. Okay. Any last thoughts? I'm excited. I Don't know. I guess I would just say I, I I'm, IIII apologize for going chalk.


I I I just think it don't apologize. You know, I, but I also don't wanna apologize for being right and I think I'm gonna be right. I think this year is going to be the year of, I have a feeling after the first two rounds when the Sweet 16 is set, there might be one or two good stories that we can latch onto. Maybe a 12 sneaks in there. Maybe, you know, there's, there's always one or two, but I think the, the story of the first weekend will be not as much madness in terms of the bracket breaking open as we had hoped. But that sets up for the heavy hitters playing each other down the road. Yeah. I think that's gonna be the story of this time. I agree. All right. There's nothing better. The ball is tipped you. I just want like that Thursday morning feeling.


I just wish I could bottle it up. Yeah. 'cause like, I'm, I'm stupid where I get like introspective where we're once Thursday's over, I'm like, damn, we're Yeah. 365 days. Dude. I've been doing that for, I've been doing that for three weeks. I'll just be sitting there in my, in my kitchen. I'll turn to my wife and I'll be like, you do you realize she doesn't really care? Yeah. Do you realize in three weeks there'll only be eight teams left? Yeah. I'll just say shit like that. She's like, I don't care. Yeah. But it, it hurts. Like I just wanna, I wanna fast Dude. Freeze time. Yeah. In that first window when I was growing up, my parents were both teachers and they, they were hard asses where like, you know, I had to go to school because they, they cared so much about the profession and you, you know, you, you do not skip school for anything whatsoever.


And Thursday and Friday of March Madness were the two days out of the year that I would always get a mysterious call from the office and be like, you have a dentist appointment scheduled for now. Love that. Yeah. And I, it that made it extra special. 'cause my mom and dad not for anything. Not like, I was a senior in high school and I was like, can I just skip the last week of school? And they're like, no. See it through to the finish line. Perfect. Attendance. All this was important, but they respected the game and yeah. Those Thursdays and Fridays, there's nothing better than that. It really doesn't. I can't wait. I can't wait to to watch it. To watch all the ball with you boys. Yeah. Thursday and Friday have our eyeballs bleed. Yep. There's nothing like it. Feel like you got hit by a truck every night. No. Get back at it. Alright. Thank you Titus. You're the best.
