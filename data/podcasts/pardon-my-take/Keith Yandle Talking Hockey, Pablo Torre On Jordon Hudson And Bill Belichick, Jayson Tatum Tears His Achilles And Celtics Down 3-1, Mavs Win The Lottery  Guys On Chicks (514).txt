Today is Wednesday, May 14th, and the Indiana Pacers are in the Eastern Conference finals. They dismantle the Cleveland Cavaliers in five Pacer basketball PFT. That's a good fucking team.

3:
It's fun. It's fun. They, I I felt like they were gonna come back even when they were down early. Like this is a team that, that does not quit. And the Cavs yet they were hobbled. They've got excuses that's good for the Cavs. Like at least you can point to injuries and stuff. Be like, yeah, well we weren't at full speed, but the, the Pacers did look good and they stuck it in ESPN's face. Yep. This is a trend that we're seeing now because remember in the first round, I think it was 10 nothing, the ESPN experts picked the Lakers over the wolves. I think it was 13 nothing. ESPN experts picked the Cavs over the Pacers and I think it's 13 to one Celtics over the Knicks as well.

3:
So there's a lot, there's a lot going on right now at ESPN

0:
And Hand Up. I think this whole show had the Cavs, this whole show had the Celtics, which we're gonna get to. I know a lot of people are probably tuning in for that. When we get back in studio, we'll get to I, yeah, I saw it. Miles Turner tweeted out after the game. All the experts that picked the Cavs, miles Turner was incredible. This series. He was incredible. Tonight. He hit the dagger shot. He, I think he had five blocks. Halliburton was awesome. Playoff Emhart is a real thing. They're just a fun team. They play with so much pace, they wear you out. Rick Carlisle was even like Rick Carlisle might be the most underrated coach in, in the, in the NBA. He was very gracious in defeat or in victory being like, you know, the Cavs had an incredible season, they just ran into a hot team like us.

0:
We're playing great ball right now. And that's a fact. Like they, I, I think so the excuse thing for the Cavs, they obviously had some injuries. Darius Garland, Mobley, Donovan Mitchell gets banged up a little. I still think that this is a really like demoralizing, disgusting way to go out for a team that won 64 games this year. That's the second most wins in Cleveland Cavaliers franchise to go out in five games. And especially the way game four happened. I I, I think you gotta run it back if you're the Cavs, but man, that is, that's as demoralizing as it gets to go out that way. Like they, they just didn't, they didn't put up a fight other than, you know, Donovan Mitchell having heroic moments and yeah, you could turn to game two and be like, Hey, if they could inbound the ball, they could have had, you know, two wins and the series could still be going on.

0:
But that's what the pacer, the Pacers make clutch shots big moments run, like, run fast. They, they just, they have it all. And I, if you're a Cavs fan, I think this is as like dark as it's been for a long time. And I'll say this PFT LeBron, he's gonna opt out. He's gonna opt out. Could he, could he end his career in Cleveland? Could he fix everything?

3:
I don't think he's opting out, but

0:
It's fun. Well, no, he, he might opt out to take less money, but that would be fun if he did the opt out And we had like a day or two of being like, calves coming home one last time, it

3:
Would be fun. It is demoralizing. You're right. Because last year felt like the year where they learned how to lose. Right? Right. Like last year they were too young and

0:
They were injured last year

3:
Together, team on the rise. They were injured last year, but that felt like for most Cavs fans, it's like, okay, let's focus on next season. That's when we could put it all together. They had a great season, so the expectations were super, super high for 'em. And yeah, this is, this is gonna be one that takes a while to get over. But you do, it is nice to have that built in excuse to be like, yeah, we were injured. Yeah, it helps you get through the dark days. Yeah.

0:
And, and they did win 64 games. Not, that's not, you know, an easy task and, but you just can't, you can't go out in the, if you win 64 games, you got, you gotta you gotta get to at least the, the conference finals, I feel like. Yeah. And you gotta, and you can't go out this way unless it's like someone is out for the entire playoffs. But like, I, yeah, it's, it's tough for the cast. Pacers are fucking good. The Pacers are good. And it's crazy because now who knows how the Celtics Knicks will finish, but obviously the Celtics are on the ropes. The Knicks could be hosting an Eastern Conference final. And we have member last year all the, all the ESPN stuff where they just didn't mention the, the Pacers in that series against the Knicks.

0:
Oh

3:
Yeah, Steve a Smith doing the, the Long walk in.

0:
So I, I like it. The Hicks versus the Knicks and, and it's like the Pacers get, they have that chip on their shoulder and I all, the only, the only complaint I have about the Pacers in this run, because they are so much fun to watch, is they gotta figure out the jerseys. That's it. That's the only thing I'll throw out there and I'll keep saying it. They look like the heat at home, but other than that, Halliburton has risen a different, like an extra level. All the other guys are playing big time moments and, and making big time shots. They pass the ball so well, feels like everyone's always getting good looks. And I'm happy for Miles Turner because they going into the series, you're like, oh, Jared Allen versus Miles Turner or Evan Mobley Mobley versus Miles Turner. He's still good and he's, he feels like he's been in the league forever.

0:
How long has he been in the league?

3:
I'm not sure, but I, I, I don't, I saw the look on Hank's face. I don't want to bury the Celtics just yet. Hank got a little bit upset with a presumptive Nick's discussion, but he's,

0:
He's been in league for 10 years.

3:
You gotta, you gotta think about it, Hank that's our job. We gotta look ahead sometimes. And right now it's three to one. So I, my only thing is, And we did find out last night that we have, there's some people in the NBA front office that do listen to part of my take. So I'll make this case one more time. One last time. Free John Halliburton.

0:
Yes. Free

3:
Halliburton's dad. Yes. He did his time. He sat out, he missed the home games. This is Indiana basketball. This is as a state that has Hoosiers. Did they, Sean Dennis Hopper and Hoosiers.

0:
They gotta bring him back. They gotta bring him back for the Knicks. They,

3:
They, they ended up Celtics embracing him. Celtics, they made him an assistant coach. He totally redeemed himself. This is, you gotta let the guy's dad be there at the games. Yeah.

0:
Hank, I know we're gonna talk about the Celtics Knicks And we taped that portion earlier in the day And we talked about Jerry O'Connell. Jerry O'Connell has already gone on to the Pacers.

3:
Yeah, he's moved on.

0:
He's moved. Mr. Bing Bong has moved on to the Pacers. Are you going to be using this as fuel for the Celtics?

4:
Yeah, I mean, it's the playoffs. You should never look ahead like that. It's still game by game. Anyone can come back and, and he's gonna learn that the hard way.

3:
That's what, that's what Hank's always said, Mr. Game by game,

0:
Mr. Game by game. Don't look ahead. Do not look ahead. Do the Pacers scare you a little? Hank

4:
Pacers are good. They're a good team. They scare you. They're a good team. It would be a, a tough matchup if if we got there, I'd I would be honored with the opportunity.

0:
Yeah, there

4:
There you go. We go. But we gotta be New York first. That's,

0:
You gotta be in New York.

3:
Jerry's Jerry's little man bun that he's got going right now is Elite too. Yeah, I didn't know he was capable of that. I didn't know he had that, that shot in his bag. But yeah, he pulls it off.

4:
I mean, the hat that I gave him was like a really nice hat in good condition and he is just like, I don't, he's like bite, chewing it.

0:
Disgusting doing some Fleming. He's Fleming hat. But yeah, I'm happy for the Pacers, I'm happy for Pacers fans. It will be fun to watch whoever it is they play in the next round. There you go. Hank how much they shun them and pretend that the Pacers aren't involved in the series. We will on this podcast be repping the Pacers and, and, and saying the Pacers deserve more credit throughout the entire series. If espn, if they have Stephen A. Smith doing speeches and, and tunnel walks, we'll do a tunnel walk. We'll do a speech. We'll represent for the, for the smaller markets.

3:
We might get a little McAfee, Stephen A. Smith head to head.

0:
Oh, that would be good. How about

3:
That? Some bad blood.

0:
That will be good. That will be good. I don't, I don't have Stephen a Smith's phone number. We know Pat McAfee. So the choice is easy. We, we have our sword. Take our sword in this battle. Alright. And then we had an awesome game in the second game, the thunder and nuggets. It felt like the nuggets were gonna win that game and then they just could not make a shot in the fourth quarter. It was crazy. Like they, they just kept, I mean, we had the Russ Airball, they just couldn't find offense and the thunder that, that felt like one of those, you know how on Friday night they lose that OT game and it was like, ooh, the nuggets just know how to win these games.

0:
Feels like the, the thunder are starting to get up to speed where it's like these crunch time, big time moments. Game fives are always important, especially when it's two two. And the thunder kind of grew up a little bit tonight.

3:
I was going back and forth because it, it felt like it was a Jamal Murray game where Jamal Murray was giving you enough as the number two option where the nuggets usually win those sorts of games. But then the fourth quarter he just kind of disappeared and he, and he quit making his shots. It basically became like, okay, pick and roll at the top of the key and then Yoic do something magical. And he is capable of doing magic shit. Like there's sometimes when even when he gets tired, he's, he plays like a dad just dominating in pool basketball. Right? This dude's hanging off him spinning around using the glass and it felt like that was gonna be, that was gonna be the story of this game. But he didn't have enough help. It

0:
Yeah, it was, it was basically like, which which help showed up because SGA had, you know, his 30 31 Yoic was in, was just bounced back from his slew of like a subpar games with 44. And it just happens that the, the thunder were able to make the big shots from the other guys. Like even Lou Dort who couldn't hit a three to start the series or these playoffs, you know, hit, hit some big shots. Caruso was everywhere as always. And so yeah, it's, it felt like the, the, the rest of the thunder stepped up in a way that the nuggets weren't able to find someone because it was, it was just Jamal Murray and, and Nicole Yoic scoring.

0:
Like, they didn't have, they didn't get much from anyone else. And you could see it at the end when they just had no options and no one could hit a shot for him. And they were just putting like, basically the entire defense on Yoic and being like, anyone else hit a shot And we can live with it. And they couldn't hit a shot.

3:
Yeah. Dort went back to back to back with three pointers. I love when

0:
He does that.

3:
And then, and then the hustle play. Run outta balance. I love watching that guy play. And he

0:
Has been ba like, he, he's had moments where he's al he's played himself off the court. Like they have not been able to use him because his shooting has like the, the way that the thunder are set up, like Lou do plays defense and he's gonna get some open looks. He's gotta hit those open looks. I think he was shooting like 29% before tonight. And then tonight he started hitting those big threes and that's a big difference for their offense.

3:
I wanna see more of the series. I hope it goes seven because I agree this is, this has been a really fun one to watch. And the others it's like, you know, kind of fast forwarding look, looking forward to getting to the next round. This one. I love this matchup. Yeah. I wish that they could play 20 more times.

0:
Yeah. I I need a game seven. I need a game seven. What do, what's that? Look Hank

3:
Hank's mad.

0:
You mad about something? Yeah,

4:
I disagree. I mean, we've been talking about the Celtics Nickers more than any other one. I don't, I don't understand fast forwarding.

3:
Well that's what do you mean? Because you're, you're a big Celtics fan

0:
We were talking about, but we want this series to go seventies is what he is saying.

3:
Yeah. I want more of this,

4:
But we're just fast forwarding through these other series could care less.

3:
Yeah. The Celtics were dominating.

4:
I just, I I didn't think that was appropriate.

3:
Okay. Okay.

0:
Maybe we need an appropriate meter. No, you

4:
Asked what my face was. I I can't, yeah, I just was reacting.

3:
You

0:
Can't hide your face. No. Do you think you should start doing the show in a ski mask? No,

4:
I don't want, I, I feel how I feel. Yeah. If he knows what he's doing. No, I appreciate that. Mean it's not nice. It's not nice. It's not nice.

3:
I'm sorry for being not nice

0:
PFT. It's not nice. Please

3:
Be nice. I'm sorry that I'm not being nice.

0:
Don't

3:
Be nicer. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be nicer to Hank specifically in the future. That's

0:
Nice. You know

3:
What else is nice? I have something nice. It's nice that we don't have to do all the inside the NBA tributes. Yeah. Like I feel like that was the big conversation last year. It's like, oh no, we're gonna be losing these guys in a year. And now it's like, okay, well they're coming back next year. Yeah, that's cool. We don't have to, we don't have to deal with that loss too. Michael Jordan.

0:
Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan's gonna be dude, if so there's a news, I think it was what, Tuesday morning? Or no, sorry, Monday morning. I can't, I can't get my days straight. That MJ is doing m he's doing peacock, right? Yeah. He's gonna be on the peacock desk. Yeah, he's gonna

3:
Be an occasional contributor. So not all the time, but he's gonna, he's gonna parachute in if

0:
MJ has to give picks, he has to give picks if he, but, but no, I, no, I, I, you know, he won't, they won't let him, but he has to.

3:
I think he might, I think he might, I

0:
Love

3:
Weasel it in there. I

0:
Would love if he not only gave picks, but he also like, he's like, all right, we're gonna go to mjs picks tonight. And he's like, alright, I got the Knicks, I got the nuggets and here's what you're gonna want to do if you have 14 in the dealer showing eight. Yeah. Like he gives tips on blackjack too.

3:
NASCAR. I want MJ just unloading the clip. I, I think, I mean, if we're being honest, why do you think MJ is doing this? I think it, he probably had the chiefs in the Super Bowl, right?

0:
He might have.

3:
And he's like, damn it, I gotta get a job.

0:
I think he also like, this is, this is a, a part a legacy is obviously important and like being on TV is important. He hasn't, he doesn't do, he doesn't do media like at all. So I think being in the conversation, like you see Gretzky out there, obviously, like Charles Barkley had an incredible NBA career. He, he is well known far past his, like compared to like some of the guys he played with. He's well known so much pa farther past that because of what he's done with inside the NBA.

3:
So I actually think that's probably the biggest reason why Jordan's doing this Yeah. Is because he wants to come back and dominate Chuck. Yeah. He's sick of Chuck and he got mad at Chuck a couple years ago when, when Barkley was saying that MJ stunk as a gm, which is true. I mean, just objectively

0:
It is

3:
As an analyst. And then I think Jordan got real mad about that. And he sees these guys that used to dominate in basketball on tv and he is like, fuck that. I'm gonna come on TV and just make the life hell again.

0:
I just, I need like, I need all of the picks and I need like, you know, instead of, instead of a race to the, to the screen, like maybe they have like, like wiener dogs racing in between commercials, roulette table. Just what if this table is just a roulette table? I need all of it. Just like, it's just mjs gambling hour. That would be incredible. TV

3:
I kinda look at, at MJ on tv. Like I, I felt about Brady coming to tv. Like it's almost beneath him. That's what I'm saying. It tap Michael Gi. It's on TV talking to us. It's like, we don't, we don't deserve to hear from Michael Jordan. Like, it's, it's weird having that's, he's also

0:
The richest, he's like the richest guy a lot. Like he's so rich. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, you know, Jeter doing the fox. It's, it's Brady doing it. It's, there's like a bubble to like the aura that then when you see them on TV and like, you know, he'll say something wrong or say something stupid and that'll become a viral clip and you're like, Ooh, what's this? You know?

3:
I think, I hope he gets on Twitter. That would be awesome. He'll never do it. He'll never do that. Like Michael Jordan doesn't, he doesn't talk to us.

0:
Hope he gets into meme coins.

3:
Oh, for sure. That's for sure. He, oh, he, he and Reggie Miller might actually get into a fight on the air.

0:
Oh, it, I mean it will be great too because he can just, like, he has the ultimate Trump card on every, like I hope he just shows up in his rings sometimes just to be like, yeah, I'm sure. He'll yeah.

3:
Like they should let him smoke a cigar inside the studio. Yeah. Do do whatever you want

0:
Tequila. Yeah. Yeah. Have the host who's hosting that show? Do we know?

3:
I'm not sure. Maybe Tico.

0:
Okay. Tico to Rico's dressed up like a, like a blackjack dealer and like they're just playing hands during the show.

3:
Yeah.

0:
Just keep him engaged.

3:
I'm in, I'm in, I I'm interested to see what happens. But it's like, with Brady, it's like with, with Gretzky kind of, it's shocking to see the greatest of all time in any sport. Like talking to you and, and commentating on the games.

0:
Yeah. The but the, the one thing with MJ is like, I feel like he, he will have the opportunity to be like a great storyteller that we don't, you know, we don't, we don't hear often. 'cause again, he does, he does, he has not done media for so long outside of the last dance. Like, he has that ability. Like he could tell stories that you're like, I've, you know what I mean? I've never heard this story. I've never heard this angle of this story. Whereas some of the guys who are like very accessible, you kind of have heard 'em all and you, you, you, you've gone through 'em all. So he does have that like wow factor.

3:
Yeah. I mean it's a great move by NBC. Yeah.

0:
Great move.

3:
Yeah.

0:
I had, can I do one quick baseball thing?

3:
Yep.

0:
Shout out Javi Baez, because I'll say this right now. I think the Detroit Tigers are gonna win The al I don't know if they can win the World Series. There's some good teams in the nl Javi Baez has, he basically was a joke for the Tigers the last few years. There would always be these mashups of him striking out all the time. In the last 34 games, he's hitting 3 19, 5 home runs, 27 rbis. Tonight he hit two home runs, including a walk off three run Homer. I'm happy for my guy Harvey. It's like a complete, he was, you know, if you ask any Tiger fan, they did not like Javi Baez. And he's hopefully this sustains, but in the last month, it's like he's recaptured something and, and, and come back to the world as, as what the electrifying Javi Baez was.

0:
Yeah.

3:
He's very fun to watch when he's playing. Well, when he is not playing well, it's very sad.

0:
Yeah. Yeah. So I just, you know, it is a, it's cool to see Javi doing well. Yep. And the and yeah. What did you say? No, I was just saying Justin Turner had a, a walk off hit tonight, which was nice 'cause he, he, he, we needed him to do something. Cubs had a Cubs. Cubs. Cubs are Kyle our guy Kyle Stowers who, who we did an interview with a couple of the Marlins will released next week. He hit a, his eighth home run this year. Dingers only league. He's on the prospect list.

3:
He is for sure. Are are the Cubs the kind of team that would, that would give an extension? Midseason.

0:
They, they, okay. So PFT there has been conflicting Reports. Reports. And one of the reports, so Jesse Rogers, who does a really good job locally in Chicago, has reported they have not talked about an extension. David Kaplan, who also does a good job. Who I, I know, I know both these guys are very good guys. He said the Cubs are wrapping their head around what an extension would look like, which means they haven't done shit.

3:
What does that mean?

0:
It means nothing that they

3:
Own. They, they own a baseball team that's kinda like their only real job is to is to wrap their heads around giving contracts. I

0:
Think it's Tom Ricketts literally looking in the mirror every morning being like, you can do this, dude, you have a lot of money. But then he doesn't do it. But no, I don't, I I think, I think Kyle Tucker unfortunately will, will become a free agent and the Dodgers have already like, put dibs on him. So that's gonna suck a

3:
Lot. Yeah, that's, that's tough. Just do an extension Midseason just

0:
Break rules. Rules. Do do it now. Like you, I I do think there's something to be said when you're, when you're negotiating in all of sports, you can get a little bit of a discount doing an extension in season because that is money in hand. It's not gonna be a big discount. But you can, and you're the only team that can negotiate with him. You will not have that ability once he's a free agent, it makes no sense. It makes no sense. The guy's fucking 28 years old. He's everything you want i, i in, you know, like a superstar player and he's all right. People are gonna to get at me for the superstar thing. Mm. Superstar is a little different in baseball. He's a very good, he's a very, very good baseball player. He's everything you want in a very, very good baseball player.

0:
Sign him right now.

3:
I like that. I know you hate the superstar conversation, but now I'm thinking how many superstars are there in baseball right now?

0:
I think baseball superstars are just different because they aren't, there's no household names. Like I don't do the same thing. Show hey is. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm saying I don't do the same household name thing with the NBA. Like there's like 20 superstar players in in MLBI know this makes no sense. People will say that. I'm just changing the rules. I get it. I totally agree. It makes no sense in my head. But like superstar in baseball, I just, I throw it around a lot more willy-nilly knowing that half of the guys no one will have heard of if they don't play in the market you live in.

3:
I think you could say he's our superstar. Yeah. But I think, I think with baseball there's really, there's probably,

0:
Yeah, it's just show head.

3:
There's probably fewer, there's probably like three superstars. Yeah.

0:
Show, what was that? Bryce Harper?

3:
Yeah. World Series Champion Bryce Harper. Oh wait, no.

0:
If we're talking about name value of Bryce Harper Shho. Hey, Bryce. Harper. Soto. Aaron Judge. That feels right. Kyle Tucker's a star, not a superstar. I've corrected myself. That feels good. Throw Lendor in there. I don't think we're gonna throw Linor in there.

3:
No's not, not

0:
Throw Linda in there. Let's not, you already got one met in there. Let's not throw Linda do in there. Linda

3:
Do's So good shit on the Phillies last year.

0:
Schwarber maybe. Oh, Schwarber. By the way, could he be the MVP? Well, should we start that conversation?

4:
He's playing. Well

0:
Just like, And we listen, we don't have any bias here, but should we start that conversation?

3:
We can have the conversation home runs the most And we can be the ones who started.

4:
Yeah, everyone says that.

0:
Yeah. MLB like any writers listening right now, have a vote. Start looking at Schwarber.

4:
When you think about like, legendary MLB people and people, you know, household names, it's mostly like home run hitters.

0:
Yeah,

3:
That's true.

0:
How Schwarber hits home runs. Okay. Should we kick it to ourselves? What Everyone's waiting for

3:
Any hockey.

0:
Well, we're gonna talk about it with all with Yans, but the Stars won again. Yeah. But we do get into an extended hockey talk with Yans. So we are gonna talk hockey today.

3:
The stars look great and I found myself, I found myself during the game being like, good for Dallas fans, which I have to beat outta my system. You have to beat I have to beat that outta my system because they got the number one pick. So

0:
In both drafts.

3:
In both, yeah. Listen, I originally, I was thinking like, I will feel good for Dallas fans until football season starts whenever anything good happens to 'em. You know, because I did feel bad about the Luca thing, but now after you got the number one pick, I think they lose all the sympathy

0:
A hundred percent. They're they're, they're clean and even Yeah, they it's over. Cooper flag is, is is gonna be a star. It's clean and done. You're you're good. You, you actually, I don't wanna say you could make the case that you upgraded, but we don't know what Cooper Flag could be. But he is obviously younger and is in better shape than Luca. Like, there's a chance you could have upgraded. Yeah. There's a chance you could have ended this season after the lottery's all said and done in a better spot than you were in January.

3:
Yep.

0:
So yeah, we don't feel bad anymore, but yeah. Good for the stars. They're awesome. But yeah, we're gonna talk to Ys. We have Pablo Tori. Really fun interview with him and let's kick it to ourselves in studio where we talk Celtics, Nicks and everything else that's going on before we get back in Studio.

0:
Okay. Nicks 1 21 Celtics one 13. I was wrong.

3:
Yeah, I mean I thought that this was a three one series of the Celtics.

0:
I it felt that way was way wrong.

3:
And the Knicks came to play.

0:
They came to play. They're,

3:
They're a tough team.

0:
Jalen Brunson was awesome down the stretch and the whole game. He ended up with 39. The Knicks like half halftime. You're like, Hey man, this game is probably gonna go the way that it's, you know, game three went, Celtics were up, Jason Tatum was on fire, but Jalen Brunson in the end and they had the, they had the Knicks finally had like the even scoring throughout where the like ka chipped in OG Mikhale bridges. They all ended up with 20 plus and they now have a three one lead. And I was very impressed with the Knicks resolve also Jalen Brunson, like basically calling out the team and them answering that was, that was a leadership move.

0:
Like he, you know, people were like, oh man, he's calling him out after one loss. They're up to one. No, he called him out and they all stepped up to the plate and so did he. That's a leader.

3:
And Kat was feeling spicy last night too. Oh, so ze so spicy. Did you see him after the game? He's, he has a move that I've never seen that he does. He goes in for a one-armed hug. Yep. And then puts his other arm out to the side like he's flying. Yeah. And he does it just everything the guy does. Yeah. I I I love watching him now it was credit to the Knicks, they battled back. They seem to be in the same spot that they were down, but they're a second half team. They've proved that. Yep. You can't kill 'em. They never go away. How much do we put on the Knicks winning this game as opposed to the Celtics losing this game? I

0:
Think the Knicks won this game

3:
Because I think that the Knicks, the way they were playing in the second half, really the entire second half, they, they were the better team. Yeah. For two quarters. Yeah. And, and then the most important two quarters.

0:
And it wasn't like the Celtics shot horrifically bad from three, they weren't great from three, but they were, you know, 37 and a half percent. That's not terrible. So yeah, I think I was very, very impressed with the Knicks resolve this team. The garden was alive. And I think that's pretty much the recap of the game. Hank.

5:
Yeah. Let's talk caps.

0:
Yeah,

3:
He's learning.

0:
You are learning. So what's up Hank? How are we doing? The real story here is Jason Tatum went down with an injury. The Knicks were probably gonna win this game anyway. I

3:
Think at the time the, the Knicks seemed to be the, the better team. But I mean, anything could have happened from that point on. But you can't put the injury, you can't blame the loss entirely on the injury.

0:
Yeah. He got injured with three minutes left the next on the injury, took a nine point lead. The injury was tough because it was a little bit of the Jalen Brown turning the ball over thing that you, it's not his fault that Jason Tatum might've torn his Achilles. We don't, we still don't have a report. I'm sure by the time people are listening there'll be a report. What, what, what do you wanna start with Hank? You wanna start with that being down three One, you wanna start with Tatum? What do you wanna start with? Do you wanna start with Max?

5:
Max has nothing to do with this. Well I think he

0:
Has something to do with this.

5:
He's a scumbag. But it was a, it was, it was one of the worst nights as a sports fan in a long time. Same. It, it, we went from, you know, going into the game. Even the first half we were kind of dominating. They quite couldn't miss, felt like we were gonna blow 'em out again. Rode to banner 19 and then within two hours everything is in limbo. The, it, it feels like this version like the championship team of the Celtics, we might never see play again.

3:
Everything's in limbo.

5:
What

0:
Are you shaking your head Max?

6:
I mean, unless Jason Tatum is Okay. I think we can confirm you'll never see that team again.

0:
Oh, so he's saying that he was shaking his head because you said might and he's saying it. Yeah,

6:
It's

3:
Guaranteed Hank earlier today when he says everything, he means everything. Like he was questioning the entire team. He's like, I don't know if they like Joe Missoula.

5:
I didn't say that.

0:
He didn't say that. Okay.

3:
What'd you say?

5:
I just said every, like obviously the, the luxury, it's more the luxury tax. We knew going into the, the playoffs, like they were gonna have to move people around with the luxury tax. There's, I I, I'm, I think the Celtics organization loves Joe Missoula. I'm not worried about that. There's, you know, Celtics fans that are throwing that out there. I don't agree with that at all. I don't think the Celtics organization agrees with that at all. Where I'm at right now is, is just we have to win this series, like the the our season. Can you win this series? Yes, we can win this series. We have a bunch of champions on this team. We still have the Eastern Conference finals. MVP, we have the finals. MVP we ready to go. We've been up big in all, you know, four games of this series.

5:
So I still think we can win the series and the off season looks bleak, especially depending on what the injury is. Who knows? Might just be a severely rolled ankle. We'll probably know by the time this podcast comes out. But I am just in complete like procrastination, push off all the problems until the off season. So the longer we can go with this season, that's where my my mentals are at. Okay. Is like just, just fight. Win the series, shut these stupid Knicks fans up and then, you know, I think we could, I think this scene, I still think we could win the championship, but that's where I'm at is, is just make it as far along in the season as we can because once the off season comes, a lot of things are gonna change.

5:
And that's very sad. You

3:
Just gotta win one game, not just like one game at a time. Yep. So ga this is a very important game and you're gonna be there in person for it.

5:
I will be there in person.

3:
I need you to turn the series around.

5:
I'm gonna do my best.

0:
Did you, I threw out a spin zone to you earlier this morning. You did not seem to,

5:
I don't even remember what you said. I was

0:
Okay. What I told, what I told Hank, and I actually think this is how you should be thinking the reporting up until this point was that the Celtics and, and just looking at the luxury tax, the Celtics were gonna have to make some changes this off season, right? Like they're gonna probably have to trade the, there's been talks about trading Jalen Brown. There's been talks about, you know, I, I don't know how much left Drew Holiday has on his contract, but like there's gonna, this Celtics, the, the team that won last year is not going to be the team that starts the season next year. And it was gonna be hard decisions if Jason Tatum towards Achilles. Those decisions become a little bit easier where it's like, hey, this is, we, we've lost a year, but this is where the hard reset happens.

0:
Get under the luxury tax. It's almost like the painfulness of, of breaking up a potentially championship team is not even gonna be there because the championship team's not gonna be there. 'cause Jason Tatum won't be playing for a year.

5:
I'm not sure with the championship. That's

0:
True.

3:
Be a ch you gotta keep winning,

0:
But do you not like it almost took the whole like, how could you trade this guy? How could you trade this guy out of it? Because it's like, if this next year is lost, it's gonna be a hard reset

5:
No matter. I'm not thinking about next year. I'm not thinking about the off season. Still are in the Playoffs. We're in a Playoffs series where you gotta, we gotta fight. We can't you can't think about the off season. You can't, we're still in the playoffs.

3:
You can win Can we can you can beat the Knicks without chasing Taylor. Yes we can.

5:
Yeah. Do

3:
You feel, do you feel a little bit bad about provoking the garden?

5:
No.

3:
You did kind of poke the garden though. You

0:
Did poke the garden.

6:
Do you feel a little bit bad about this entire Playoffs? Just saying you don't feel bad about that at all? Nope.

5:
Saying

0:
What? Said

6:
No. Saying that it was a foregone conclusion that they were in the finals. If anyone else were, we

5:
Were onto the finals show.

3:
I, I wanna be fair to Hank though, 'cause I've heard Hank say like six times. I still think the conversation still, still

5:
Think we're on the finals. Oh, he,

3:
He that always, he always says barring injury. True. He has said that a lot.

6:
Did he say that on this past episode? 'cause I don't believe so. I

3:
Don't think so. I forget when he said,

6:
I remember he said that at the beginning of the,

5:
I've been saying that all,

6:
Regardless he's saying they would still be down three

3:
One almost too much, much. Where I, I've been like why do you keep almost wishing injury on yourself? Let's

6:
Also make that abundantly clear. The Celtics lost that game before Jason Tatum got. Yeah,

3:
That's, we said that. Yeah.

6:
But like barring injury, they still would be down three one

0:
To three one. Yeah. Correct. I'd agree with that. Think

5:
We don't, we will never know that. We

3:
Won't. Okay. All right. We won't We did make that abundantly clear though, max.

0:
But it

6:
Is, I just wanted to make sure that

3:
It's abundant her now.

6:
I just wanted to make sure.

0:
So it it does suck that Jason Tatum like got hurt. He's 27 years old. Yeah. It's Achilles injury. That's gonna be a year out. Maybe. Maybe. But it sucks. It sucks for him. It sucks for us because Jason Tatum was one of my favorite guys who like, by all accounts, great teammate, great father, you know, great player. It was fun to make or well it was fun to make fun of him for the trivial things. Yeah. Like you don't like when someone gets hurt who you don't actually hate. You just like to, you know, poke your friends about the trivial things. It's like, damn well I didn't want that to happen to that guy. We were just kind of joking about the whole aura thing. Like that's a who who, what does aura even mean? So

3:
Now I've, now I've,

0:
Which by the way I was, if anyone saw Timothy Chaite without the Timberlands laced up. Yeah.

3:
What

0:
Do I know Aura or do I know

3:
Aura Ika? Do you remember Hank

0:
Hank admit Timothy Chalamet with Kylie Jenner looking so fucking hot. Bonk me Timberland's not laced up. Had Aura.

5:
Yeah. I would say Stefan Digs was right next to him also wearing Timbaland's not laced up. He looked even better. Okay.

0:
Alright. So you agree with that? So, so nobody's

3:
Ever said that Stefon Diggs does not have Aura. Yeah. We take if anything has too much aura.

0:
Yeah, way too much. Will you take back your comment saying like, how could you be the one fashion police and Aura judge when I was spot on?

5:
Sure.

0:
Okay. Thank you.

5:
Whatever. Do you

3:
Remember like a couple days ago And we were talking about high tops on this show? Yeah. And I told you about the study that's if you wear high top shoes, you're actually more likely to get an ankle injury. That's what laced up Timms do. If you tie your, your timms up tight, it makes you more likely to have an ankle injury. Just something to think about. Hank,

5:
I hope it's an ankle injury. So I hope you're right about that.

3:
Yeah, just something to think about.

0:
Do you think, do you wanna say anything about our gracious friend Jerry O'Connell who retired?

5:
Yeah. He is a flip-flopping pussy.

0:
Okay.

5:
He, because he unretired,

0:
He did Unretire, he got

5:
By the internet,

0:
So he said that

5:
No backbone out

0:
Of respect. Where

5:
Is he? Where where's he gonna come on? Bing.

0:
He's, he's actually not. Did you want him to come on? No, he's Tom

3:
Brady retired and then Unretired.

0:
Yeah, he said outta respect for stool, pte Henis and the Celtics and especially Jason Tatum. Mr. Bing Bong will be taking a break for the remainder of this series. Appreciate all you all do. Bing bong. And then he an hour or no four hours later said after some thought if the Celtics win game five tomorrow Mr. Bing bong will will be back.

5:
Flip flopper. Okay,

3:
So hey

0:
Also shout out Jerry who sent me and PFT some very funny voice messages that all of them said afterwards. Not for air. All

3:
Cats. We'll just say that Jerry, he's unveiled a new character. It's a private character that only me and Big Cat get to see. It's, it's not Mr. Bing bong anymore. It's Dr. Bing

0:
Bong. Dr. Bing Bong. Dr. Bong diagnosis was making some,

3:
Some great points last night in the side chat

0:
To like midnight. I was laying in bed and Dr. Bing Bong had another report.

3:
Hank, I, I am a little bit worried about you though because last night you said you weren't feeling good and so I just wanna make sure that you were feeling okay today health wise.

5:
Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't get off the couch last night. Mm.

3:
Yeah. So I was willing to tape an emergency pod. It felt like it Same.

5:
So

3:
Is I, it felt like a time when we should have done emergency pod. If we ever do it last night would've been a great time. 'cause so much stuff happened. I'd even taken an edible, but I was ready to lock it in and try to focus. Hank wasn't feeling good, unfortunately. I

5:
Would've done it. Big Cat wasn't bed asleep. Yeah. Well

0:
No, hold on. I threw out the idea to do an emergency pod right after all of it happened and I got no response. And then two hours went by and, and then it was like, oh should we, it was like, well the moment kind of is gone. They wanted it right away. I was the first one to say emergency pod.

5:
I was down.

0:
You said you were sick.

5:
I was still down. Okay.

0:
I don't know if you did say you were down,

3:
You say sick or down.

0:
I don't think you ever did say you were

5:
Down. I didn't say I was down, but I, if you had asked me like, can we do this? I would've said yes. Were you? I would've showed, I would've answered the bell.

3:
Were you down or were you sick? Were you down with the sickness?

5:
I was sick to my stomach. Yeah. I didn't know what the illness was, but it was just, I just had a, I was just sick. I have to still sick. I have to

0:
Confess. You never said you were down. I said

5:
But if you said we're gonna do

0:
An emergency pod and then an hour after that PFD said for the record, I'd be willing to do one and then you still never replied.

5:
But because you said I'm in bed,

0:
Do it tomorrow. That was at, at 11 o'clock. I

5:
If you said we're doing it, I would've said yes.

0:
Okay.

3:
Thank you Hank. Thank you. Would've welcome said yes.

0:
Okay.

3:
So I have to confess me and Big Cat did hit the side chat real quick because neither one of us wanted to jump into the main chat after the Jason tape. We wanted to give you some space because obviously it's a traumatic thing that you're dealing with. We weren't getting into the main chat and, And we weren't saying anything mean. But what I did say was that you have to admit, it would be very, very funny if the Celtics went on to win the championship without Tatum and then we could just continue to clown on Tatum in the future.

5:
I'm fine with that.

0:
Well I then I I was like PFT Good point. But there'd be a funnier one and that would be the Celtics getting to game seven and then Tatum miraculously coming back and then losing game seven in the finals.

5:
I just, I would love, I just wanna beat New York. That's really where in my mind,

3:
One, one game at a time Beat New York, one game at a time. I do feel like Hank, my future is tied to your future. 'cause I, I think there's no chance that the caps win Game five if you don't win your game. Five.

5:
So let's win game five.

3:
I think the series are gonna go the exact same way.

0:
Hank, do you have anything to say to Max? 'cause Max, well, max, you take the floor, you the, the, the debate that is raged across the country. Imp Bead versus Tatum took a interesting turn last night.

6:
Tatum looked phenomenal last night. Looked incredible. I was like ready to, I mean, I'm, he looked really good. He looked like a superstar last night. And from experience, I know that it, it sucks when, when your superstar player goes down and it looks like they're out for a year. But I can help you. I can like tell you how to maneuver this situation. Yeah, I've been there before. That'd

0:
Be nice that I think that'd be helpful. That'd be really nice. Okay. Can you help 'em?

6:
I'm I'm asking you do you want, are, would you like to receive my help?

0:
Yes,

5:
Sure.

6:
So this is how, this is how you do it. You gotta just peg

0:
Put your headphones back on. He took off the headphones. You don't, you don't get to say Sure. He's your friend is trying to help you

6:
When you have this situation, you, you turn lemons into lemonade, right?

0:
Yeah.

5:
You beat the Knicks.

6:
No, no, no, no, no. We're done, we're done with the Knicks.

0:
Oh

6:
No, we're done. We're done,

0:
We're done

6:
With the Knicks. But again, if the Knicks, if the Celtics do end up winning whatever we, we, we we're done with the Knicks. We'll we'll cross that bridge when we, when we get there, you can use this opportunity to get a good pick.

0:
Right. That's what I told them. It's a hard reset.

6:
If you look, if you look at the past of the Sixers, when Joelle and Bead gets hurt, since Joelle and Bead and Jason Tatum are looking like similar players in this moment of their careers, you can, you can take years off. Wait,

0:
What's the pick up picks? What's, what's the eye roll? Jason

5:
Tatum is a champion.

0:
Right? But that's a team. He's like award like next year both of their statuses are

6:
Up. Well, like MB didn't play this year. Tatum's not gonna play next year. It's, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. I, I hope that he comes back. I want that, I want that on the record. I hope that he comes back.

0:
I don't, I don't root for any

6:
Injuries. No. And and he looked so good last night and people were so mad that I tweeted that he looked good last night. He did. People were so, he

0:
Was the best player on the floor. He,

6:
He was, well, let's not he, Jalen Brunson was on

0:
The floor. I think

6:
Jalen Brunson was on the floor.

0:
Tatum was the best player on the floor

6:
Last night. That's another question. When don't we talk about Jalen Brunson being a superstar. We were doing

0:
Yeah, I think we've talked about that a lot. Yeah. I think that if they go to the finals, that will, it will be, we will get close. I

6:
Mean, he was incredible last night.

0:
Yeah, he was, he was insane.

6:
But I, if, if you ever wanna talk, I'm here for you. I've, I've been in your situation and beat Tatum very similar players. You know, sometimes you just gotta take a year off and reassess, reassess as a franchise and hope the lottery ball works. Right. And I hope the lottery ball works out. You, you could have a top three pick next year. Think about, think about that.

5:
No, we are, we're I'm not thinking about the off season. I'm not thinking about next year. I'm focused on the Knicks. Focus

0:
On the Knicks. So if you lose on Wednesday night with you on the wood, you'll then be ready to address these things. Yep. That's not gonna happen though. Okay. I I actually do think the Celtics is

6:
Probably five. Oh, Celtics are for sure gonna win game five. Yeah, for sure.

0:
So Hank what? I mean, it sucks if you lose the guy in the prime of his career for a year. That's, I mean, KD that happened to him. Like that's, he came back, he was okay,

5:
Kobe came back. There are some bad studies about Achilles injuries and like,

0:
Oh no. Have you been reading? Don't

6:
Look at, don't look at the bad ones. Just don't look

0:
At the bad ones. Bad studies, dude,

6:
Tatum's young. That, that actually, this is like Tatum is young enough that like whole, whole come, whole miss year come back and still be under 30. Like you can't say that about a lot of these injuries.

3:
Yeah, yeah.

0:
It is crazy though because it just shows how like fleeting sports are where it's like the, the window is open but then it could just jam shut and like in the blink of an eye.

5:
Yeah. I mean like there's not the, the Derrick Rose one is similar. Like there's not Yeah, not a lot of, I mean Aaron Rodgers, but that was the beginning of the year and, and a new team like the, you know, franchise. If there's not a franchise future probability, but it's like the, we went from, you know, things looking towards a championship to, like I said, it's like everything. If you were worried about the off season, which I'm not, but when that time comes, everything's up in the air and it

0:
Just changes everything like in a blink of an eye and you're like, what the fuck? I thought it was gonna go this way. And it went a completely different way.

3:
Yeah. The good news is you've got a really good team. Yeah. You still have a lot of good players, right? We, we God guy. Right. You've got some good players, really

0:
Good players.

5:
Agreed.

0:
Right.

5:
I think we're gonna beat the Knicks. Are you mad? And I think we can beat the

0:
Pacers. Are you mad at anyone?

5:
No.

3:
No one God, no one. You're mad at God. God. Okay. Have you spoke to God?

5:
I haven't. I'm, we're in a fight.

0:
Oh, you always, we release the, the, the graphic. Hank and, and God currently in a fight, it's complicated friendship sta their status update. Are you ghost? It's

3:
Complicated. Are you ghosting? God?

5:
Yeah.

0:
Okay. Do you, you like were I I feel like people were pretty respectful online last night because it's like Jason t again, he's like, we make jokes about the aura, but that's such a trivial thing. He's a great player and it sucks to see a great player go down.

5:
Yeah. Yeah.

0:
Was there, were there any scumbags out there? Oh

5:
Yeah. I mean it's fucking New York fans, the biggest scumbag in

3:
The world. I saw some, some Nick fans that had some very classy takes though. Yeah. The first person that I saw that with a take on it was Stephen Cha, who was all class saying, as a Knicks fan, you hate to see an injury like this. Yeah. So I think the the loudest voices were actually the good ones this time. So that was nice to see.

0:
Yeah.

5:
Yeah. I mean, there's no one to really be mad about it. It's a, it's a freak injury. It's a bad injury. Non-contact. He's missed one playoff game in his career. He's, you know, Mr. Durability and to, to go out like this is, is tough, but it's, it's still a team game. We're still in the series. Gotta win game five. Gotta win game six. Gotta win game seven.

3:
Chase says, as a Knicks fan, I hope Jason Tatum isn't really hurt. He's, he's having an incredible game and I want to, what does that say? I want to win this series against a healthy Celtics team.

6:
And then he also went on to say, I think Jason Tatum injured his Achilles here.

3:
Dr. Bingo.

6:
Hopefully not torn. What? That that was a hot take from Steven Sha.

0:
Yeah, I know. He did it like an hour after too.

3:
Yeah.

0:
Are you mad at Rick Pitino?

5:
Yeah. I mean the Rick Pitino. That was, that was a, I I might've lashed out there. I was, yeah.

0:
He is a recurring guest.

5:
Yeah. He is a recurring guest, but he was a fucking Celtics coach, and he tweeted after the game, like, there's nothing better than being in the garden with Nick's fans and watching the Knicks win. Disgusting me. Yeah.

0:
Well, he's recruiting the garden is where he plays a lot of home games. Yeah. So he is trying to pump up

5:
The garden. Yeah. But yeah, I tweeted, fuck this guy. I was mad. Yeah. I was, I was in a tough, I was, I was sick. I was a sick tweet.

0:
Yeah. That was a sick tweet.

3:
You never wanna tell people to fuck.

0:
What would your, what would your take be right now if Tatum didn't get injured? You were down three, one.

5:
Well, we might not be down three. One.

0:
Well, okay, let's just, let's pretend that the nine

5:
Three, if we had lost that game, I would just say it's, it's load up. Load up the clip, get the Uzi ready. Grenades went Celtics and seven we've, we've, we've kind of dominated the series.

3:
Okay. All right. Here we go. Sweet. Sweet.

5:
We're still the better team

3:
On,

5:
We're still the better team. I love it. We're still the better team. I love it. I would still like our chances you dominated. I still like our chances. You've

3:
Dominated

5:
Sweetie. So we've kind of dominated

0:
Oh, sweetie Pie.

5:
But yeah. Jason Tatum wasn't hurt. I, I'd feel great about this series. Yeah. Regardless of what the score

3:
Was, you guys have been owning the Knicks and it hasn't been close.

0:
Yeah. The Knicks are, they're playing. I was very, I Jalen

5:
Bros was a stud.

0:
I thought the Knicks were, were

5:
Kale bridges a stud. Yeah.

0:
They were both

5:
Incredible. You just hit a fucking 10 trillion, like eight footers. I

0:
I thought the Knicks were gonna be dead and, yeah. Very wrong. Last question for you. At any point last night, did you think of Max and be like, I fucking hate his guts?

5:
No, I don't think about Max.

3:
Okay.

0:
I feel like that might be a lie.

3:
I don't know. I see group text when something like,

5:
Well, yeah, you guys were reveling in injuries and it wasn't,

0:
It

6:
Was not. I didn't say anything last

0:
Night. No, no, no, no, no. That did not happen

3:
When something like this happens. I understand that. Hank, you, you have to go into a hole. You have to, you have to retreat into your own hole. I've done this before. And, and just block every, everything's sad. Everything sucks. If you have a superstar that gets hurt, it's not a good place to be in. We tried to respect your boundaries last night.

5:
No, you did. You kept adding me back to the group text.

3:
I did. But that's just because we're we're a team.

0:
I said, did you guys see Shaima at the game? Max said, aura. You left the conversation. That had nothing to do with, with Tatum at all.

6:
No, it did. 'cause you remember Tatum did were

0:
Oh, I guess the aura part. But they, I was just commenting about Shaima.

6:
Yeah.

5:
I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I didn't want to be in that conversation anymore, so I left. Okay. And you didn't respect that.

0:
Well, I mean, we have, we planned stuff on the show and stuff like that. We need you here. Like what if you miss an important text.

5:
Yeah.

6:
Whatever. I think the Celtics gonna win this series.

0:
Think we're win Game five. I know about, I think about game six.

3:
I think Joe Missoula's, Joe Missoula is gonna to get, is like, Joe Missoula is locked in right now. There you go.

6:
Hank fired up.

3:
Joe Missoula is gonna be watching. He's gonna watch Troy. Hey Hank. He's gonna put Troy on nonstop and be like, this is how you respond from an Achilles

6:
Injury. Yeah. Remember when they came back three, two against the Sixers. Yep.

0:
Think about, I do think about Hank, close your eyes and think about the moment that you're on the wood on Wednesday night. And Joe Missoula locks eyes with you and gives you a little nod being like, it's fucking on.

6:
He's gonna come right up to you and be like, we're gonna win this whole fucking thing. Yeah. And then you're And, and then, and

0:
You're gonna come,

3:
Come.

0:
You are. He's gonna

3:
Everywhere. Gonna say for you, Hank. Yeah.

5:
Not for me. It's for, for the city. Believe in Boston. Yeah. That's Give

3:
Up the ship. That's the mentality. You

0:
Gotta have me. You are a Knicks fan. Yeah. Congrats. This

7:
Is it. This is an incredible podcast.

0:
Are you enjoying yourself? Oh yeah. What do, do you have anything to say about the game or Hank or anything?

7:
I just love Jalen Brunson and Mikhail Bridges and og.

0:
Okay. And would you, if you could magically heal Jason Tatum, would you do it?

7:
Yes. Absolutely.

3:
That's huge. What do you think about Hank's Hank's claim that the, the Celtics are dominating the series?

5:
Kind of. I said

7:
Sure. Still three one, but whatever. Whatever floats your boat. Doesn't matter. You were so happy Sunday.

3:
That's mean,

5:
That's, I just want, I just,

6:
That's so

5:
Happy. I just want to beat memes.

7:
I just want that happy guy around.

0:
You are so happy.

6:
I feel like memes hasn't even said anything to you.

5:
I don't care. But

0:
It's, it's the thought of things. He's could say

6:
Memes is the idea of memes. Yes. Right. Because he knows me what memes is thinking. Right. That's what Hank really,

0:
That's why I thought maybe he was mad at you, max. 'cause he he knew what you were thinking last

6:
Night. I had some thoughts.

0:
You share a couple.

6:
It, I, I hate it's, it does, it truly, truly does suck that Jason Tatum got hurt. I'm not, I'm not kidding when I say that. It would've, it was fun to watch. It was fun. It was a fun narrative, but it was really tough that for the past week, I've had a million people say that he's Iron Man and that he's never missed a game. And then that, that's why he's so much better than mb And then literally three days later done. Same thing. That happens to when Mbbi injuries happen.

0:
Injuries do happen.

3:
Hank,

5:
That's It's true. Yeah. There's not, you can't really defend that. It's, he's not wrong.

3:
Do I get any thoughts and prayers for cashing outta my next future? Like, I feel like last night that was Yeah. Was bad time. That was a bad night for me Last night. Yeah. Right. About to prayer. Really bad. I didn't leave the group chat

0:
Though. Although that's kind of the, the cash out. I would give you more thoughts in per 'cause. I already used my one thought, thought in prayer for the caps and the, the wizards. You, you only dated that future for a day.

3:
It was, I think it was two, it might be two

0:
Days. Like if you, if you had been, if you had been married to that future for a couple months, I would've been like, oh my God. PFDI feel so bad. You barely, you, you had a one night stand with you.

3:
It was hot and heavy for a couple days. It was a one night stand with a great morning after. And then, yeah. Just never, you just were like, I had to get outta town here.

0:
What? You were like, watch a mag trick. Here's how I can automatically lose 10% of my money. Yeah. But

3:
It felt in a day I did. It was one of those cash outs where you feel awesome about cashing out of it. Yeah. You're like, that's a smart choice for the future. Turns out it wasn't. So Yeah. Last night, I mean, I, I was a victim too, so I get it.

0:
Yeah. And I was a victim too because like I said, I like harmlessly joking about Jason Tatum's aura was fun. And it's

3:
Gone now. We can't do it. The

6:
Whole debate was fun. Yeah.

3:
It was a fun debate. Yeah. It was a good debate. And it was, it was eerily presion. Yeah. Max. It was, it was you looking into the future and and truly understanding the pulse of the NBA

0:
Here

6:
To the street. Yeah. People are So, I, like I tweeted Tatum looks really good tonight because I was just preparing to like, have to eat my work. I mean, I, I was preparing for this, for this episode and then a bunch of Celtics fans saw that tweet and thought that I tweeted it after he got hurt. Ah. And then I was getting

3:
Check the timestamps and then

6:
I was getting de well, it was half that.

0:
I had a similar one that I muted that was just like, Tatum is on fire or arising. Yeah. It was like maybe 20 minutes before the injury.

6:
And then, and then the other moment was everyone was just like, this is your fault. You, you put his, his m bead st you put your m bead stink on Tatum.

3:
Now you did do that. That's a fair thing.

0:
I under And I understand that's a fair thing. Yeah. And also I understand that like when a injury like that happens, fans gotta find a place. You

6:
Gotta blame someone. I

0:
Happy you gotta go somewhere. Yeah.

3:
I, I saw one thing that was being blamed and I agree with it. We could do with less of the cameras and the tunnels when guys are on wheelchairs. Yeah, I'd agree. And they're crying. I don't, I

0:
Didn't need to see Tatum like in like, probably not only a painful moment, but like a moment where he's realizing his next season might be done. I don't, I feel bad for

3:
The guy he was, he was having a moment where the world was crashing in on him. Right. We don't need to see that. Like, have, have a little bit of respect for the guy at that point.

0:
Because there is obviously, I can't relate at all to a professional athlete in terms of injuries, but anyone who's been injured in anything knows that. It's like the injury happens. There's the immediate how it's pain and then the moment of like, shit, I'm gonna be injured for a while now. That's like, it's devastating. Yeah.

3:
Thinking about what the injury means for your future. Right. It's, it's a, it's a crisis that you go through. I didn't wanna see that. I didn't wanna see him crying and all that stuff. I, it

0:
Was bad. I'd agree. So we hope Jason Tatum gets, I hopefully we get good news because I do not wanna see him injured.

3:
I want to see Jason Tatum come back maybe more than anybody on this podcast so that we can make fun of him. Right.

0:
Oh, if he, if it was just an ankle roll, imagine that Hank I would love that. Yeah. 'cause you would eat all those jokes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

3:
Like when, when Trevor Lawrence, remember when he, he was crying. Yeah. Maybe he was just embarrassed.

0:
Yeah. Like, you're, you're

3:
Fine. And

0:
He's just embarrassed that he was crying. It's like Ricky Bobby fake on fire.

3:
It might be in his head.

0:
Right. That'd be great. Okay. Wolves Warriors. This series feels over. I I don't know

3:
How There's no report though. That makes no sense to me.

0:
Well keep your, keep, keep looking. We'll get one.

3:
He might be fine.

0:
The Wolves Warriors game. The Warriors had a lead at halftime. Again, they just do not have enough offense.

3:
They just, they just run outta stuff. They run out of ideas. They, their ideas work great. Four and a half. And then they Yeah. They, they can't rely on mucking it up and getting mid-range and all this stuff. They can't, four quarters is too much for them to do that.

0:
And Jimmy Butler,

3:
Who they're fighting though, Jimmy

0:
Butler, who I think was under the weather going into the game, it was very clear. The wolves were like, alright, defensively, if we just pack the paint and don't let Jimmy Butler score on floaters and drives the basket and make him pass the ball out to the three point line, they can't beat us. And that proved out to be true because they couldn't really hit shots from three. And Anthony Edwards was awesome again. And Julius Randall was awesome. Again, these two like together, I mean we're a wooing. We're a wooing.

3:
Yeah. Listen, I I a woo, they're a very, very fun team. And then with McDaniels, just cleaning up the glass, just eating glass all day. Yeah. They, they are gonna be very, very tough to beat. I don't see the, I don't think the Warriors can beat 'em without Steph. Not even a single game. Yeah.

0:
IWI wish, I wish we had Steph in this series 'cause it would be a lot more fun. And they, I mean the Warriors are keeping these games relatively co the end of the game again. They almost covered again in a crazy fashion. So like, it looks like it was a seven point game. It really wasn't in the sec in the second half because the wolves just jumped right all over him in the third quarter. But yeah, I I, I'm impressed with, with the timber bowls. I think they're a very good team. I just wish we could see Steph similar to the Jason Tatum. You just don't wanna see Really good guys get hurt.

3:
I'm impressed with Minga though.

0:
Yeah. Maybe Fool's gold.

3:
What do you mean? I don't

0:
Know. He's, he, he's a weird one because he's, he has really good games and he has bad games, but he also has, he's one of those guys, I think he's in his fourth year where he is been like in and out of the doghouse. So it's like, how much is it his confidence? And I, I don't know. I I, I can't figure out Kaga.

3:
He was pretty efficient though. Yeah.

0:
And no, I'm, it, it's not like

3:
He was, he has, was trying to get outta the dog house and then trying to like shoot his way out and be like, well, I'm gonna get my points. Well

0:
He's, he, the doghouse is irrelevant now because he has to play. You

3:
Can't afford to have a doghouse. Right,

0:
Right. I'm saying like, in the course of his career, he's had a very up and down, like one, one step forward, two steps back kind of feel. But maybe this is, maybe this is where he fully steps forward and is like, oh yeah. He can be a, a real option for them.

3:
How many guys did they play last night? Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, I think 14. Nine, 10. Yeah. Yeah. 14 guys. Yeah. 14 guys saw the chord.

0:
Yeah. They're trying everything. And the, and the wolves are down to their eight, eight man rotation. That works. And yeah. Wolves are, are really good. Alright. PFT you are down. Hank are you still with us? You're just looking for Tatum updates. Nothing. Are you

3:
He's locked in on the caps.

0:
You wanna talk with the caps?

5:
Yeah, they suck. Their offense is terrible.

3:
That's fair. These are fair points. They're down three, one down, three one. We talk about it in, in a little bit more depth with Yandel. But it's been no fun to watch this series at all. And it's a compliment to the hurricanes. They just, they they have a way of, of sucking the soul out of you when you play hockey where you just can't get into the zone. That's the most frustrating part of, of watching a team that should be good on offense. Not even being able to get the ball or the puck into their zone. Yeah. It is, it's, it's hard to watch. It's very frustrating. They're getting more chances on, on our power plays than we are. Their shorthanded opportunities are better than ours. So it's looked, it's looked pretty bad. Yesterday was one of the worst days in Washington sports that you could ever draw up.

3:
Yeah. It was really, really bad. Dropping to six with the wizards in the, in the draft and then, and then the caps going out there and just doing nothing for two periods. The caps just need to score first. That's, that's, that's my theory is just take advantage of the early game opportunities. Put a puck in the net, not a ball. Put a puck in the net and then see how the game goes from there. 'cause you can't play from behind against the hurricanes. Yeah.

0:
We should talk about the lottery. So crazy. The Mavs Win The Lottery. 1.8% chance to win the lottery of it was a coin flip with the bulls. So they had the same record. They coin flip the Mavs get 1.8, the bulls get 1.7. Now I don't think I saw some people being like, that was, if, if, if Booz List doesn't hit the buzzer beater against the Lakers, the bulls get the number one pick. I'm gonna say the Mavs Lottery getting the number one pick no matter what. Yeah. That's not

3:
How it works. Like they had a a 0.1% better chance of getting the overall number one picked than you did. But I think 'cause they won the coin toss,

0:
Their numbers would've been our numbers. Maybe.

3:
I don't know how, I don't know if you like swapped numbers at that point.

0:
So we were, they

3:
Probably swapped one. You, they probably get one extra number.

0:
Right. So we were Yeah, true. Good point. That makes me feel

3:
Better. Yeah. So it's not like that

0:
Really good

3:
Point. That determined everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

0:
That's a really good point. The, so we, we got credentialed And we were at the lottery. We might've, we might've gotten got. We're suckers. We're suckers. So

3:
I'm a

0:
Sucker. So shout out to the NBA very nice of them. They let us get credentialed, which we don't get credentialed for anything. Well, you guys

5:
Wanted to get credentialed. That's the only thing I'll say. Yeah. You guys are saying you got used, but

0:
No, we didn't get used. You guys wanted to go saying we're we are suckers because we went, we wanted to go. We got dressed up. There's video coming out. I had to leave early 'cause it was my son's birthday. But PFT and Max stayed for the actual lottery like reveal. But we got there dressed like idiots and suits credentials, which like we are, we are, we're six year olds. They hand us a fucking picture of ourselves on a, a laminated card with a lanyard on. And we all are like, holy shit, this is cool. And I'm just walking around, look at this credential. Hit the buffet. Yeah.

3:
Did the whole thing. Did the behind the scenes tour that made us feel special going into the room. So the way the the draft lottery works out is there's, there's two rooms for everything. One room is where the real shit happens and that's where they have all the numbers up on the wall. That's where the guy from Ernst and Young is supervising everything. That's where they do the drawing. And then after they do the drawing, they, they take the results in like a briefcase and they bring it out to the main room where they announce it to the world. So everybody that is supervising the draft lottery as it actually happens in the real secret room, they get their cell phones taken away. It's like a conclave. They get locked in there. They're electing the Pope. Yeah. And they don't get their cell phones back until after it's been broadcast to the world. And then they take the results out and that's where you see Hakeem lajuan.

3:
That's where you see Bub Kerrington. That's where see Jared McCain representing their teams is when they make that announcement after it's already happened. And we got the tour behind the scenes, we saw the official lottery ball machine that they have. Yep. Which

0:
I wanted to buy it.

3:
I told Max this, but when you looked at that, my first thought was I would love to smoke out of this thing. Yeah, you could turn that into a bong, a sick ass bong. I want to blaze up outta there. That a joke guy. Yep. Thanks Hank. And being behind the scenes, we, we talked to them for a little bit. We started to make some jokes. I took out $80 in my pocket. I was like, I got 80 bucks if you rig it for the Wizards. I took out a lot, Andres and then, and then Pig Kat opened up his wallet, took out some money too. And they were like, okay guys, time for please time for you all to go. You behaved yourself for a little bit. Then we hit the buffet, which was underwhelming to say the least. Yeah. And we had a very interesting conversation before the actual lottery itself. I think he was head of PR for the NBA really nice guy.

3:
She really

0:
Nice

3:
Guy came out and talked to us and explained to us the history of why the media is now welcome at the draft lottery. Because he used to see it behind the scenes. And then he was like, man, we gotta get the media out here because if they really saw how this is done, they would know that it was impossible to rig this thing. Right. It's unreadable. And he was laying it on thick. He was doing a lot of unr gable talk Yep. To us before, before the

0:
Draft. And we were eating it up. I was

6:
Still am eating it

0:
Up. Oh, we were eating.

3:
Shut the fuck up Max.

0:
We were eating it

6:
Up. I'm still like,

0:
And then

6:
How the way this, like how could, how could you possibly, how could you do that? How could you rig it?

3:
It's rigged.

6:
I don't think it's rigged. I, I I believe what that, I believe what that guy

0:
Max eat the most at

3:
The buffet. It was the buffet.

6:
I ate zero of the buffet. PFD ate the most of the,

0:
But we did, we did. It was funny because then afterwards when the Mavs get the first pick, I texted the guys was like, did we did, why were we there again? And then like, oh yeah, we, we

6:
Asked to be there.

0:
I know, but then they had us talking about how unreadable it is and they gave us food and a lanyard and everything.

6:
I'm sure they got pissed off that, that everyone says that it's rigged.

3:
I'm sure they're very happy with the outcome of the draft

6:
Record. Correct. But I'm sure that it get, that it does get annoying if it doesn't. All they put in all of this work for it not to be rigged and then everyone just says, this is

3:
Rigged. Well then they should rig it to make it not rigged. They should rig it. So the worst teams get it.

0:
Here's what they were.

6:
You're just upset because you didn't get it, obviously.

3:
Yeah. Yeah. Obviously I have, well, I thought about this last night because it, it, it sucked at the Wizards. Really? What was on the line for me? I had a 14% chance of becoming Wizards fan last night. And, and I, the, the numbers did not hit. And I was excited about rooting for the Wizards again. So now it's back to the drawing board for me. But then I thought, you know, I got enough on my plate. I don't need to worry about the Wizards. It's, it's just, as Forrest Gump would say, good. That's one less thing. Yeah. So I'm, I'm okay with it. Back to not caring about The Wiz for me.

0:
Yeah. But it was, it's crazy. I'm, I am in one part happy for Mavs fans because they have gone through hell and Mavs fans did not trade Luca. Yeah. It got, you know, so Mavs fans, I'm pumped for it. They actually deserve it. Nico Harrison, that fuck does not deserve it unless it's rigged. And he worked out a deal with the NBA, which you could tell me that you could convince me that not rigged. I'd buy

3:
That GM of the year.

0:
Yeah. GM of the Year. He just knew how this was all gonna play out. But max, it, you have to admit that there have been some interesting lotteries, have

6:
There not. Yeah, no, for sure. I've seen I

0:
The Patrick Ewing, the LeBron, LeBron, the Cleveland, the Derrick rose to Chicago. Then you go to the, the, the 2011. LeBron makes the decision. 18 months later, the Cavs get the number one pick the 2012. The Hornets not

3:
Shopping.

0:
Luca not shopping. Luca a clandestine trade. 2012. The Hornets who are now the pelicans get the number one picks the pick a mo a few months after trading Chris Paul, which the NBA technically owned the team. When they traded Chris Paul, then a new owner comes, they whoa. They get the Anthony Davis pick 2014. LeBron goes back to Cleveland. They get the number one pick. They get to trade it for Kevin Love 2019 the Pelicans trade. Anthony Davis to the Lakers, they get Zion Mavs 2025. They trade Luca to the Lakers. They get Cooper flag. It's interesting.

6:
I also feel like there's plenty of, plenty of stories where it's like the most boring team, like the p Yeah.

0:
But that's, that's what we do here. Max.

3:
Max, max here. Here's where you're wrong. Here. Here's where should

0:
They

3:
Pay you. Here's where you can pick and choose Max. I, they

6:
Were very nice. They were very nice. Yeah.

3:
You're very happy with how things turned out for your Sixers. Very, very happy. Of course you're saying it's not rigged also, but you can pick and choose. He's

0:
A buffet whore.

6:
Yeah. I did not touch the buffet,

0:
Dude. He was inside of that buffet. Yeah.

6:
We have it on camera. The only thing that,

0:
The only

6:
Thing I ate at the buffet is when you fed me

0:
The yogurt out. Who is the

6:
Put it on my face. Who

0:
Is the camera man?

6:
That was me. But you put the,

0:
Oh, interesting. You put

6:
The yogurt in my face.

0:
Who's editing the video?

6:
Pug.

0:
Oh, well you were the cameraman.

3:
Interesting. Now to be fair to max it, he might not have touched the buffet, but they only had healthy options at this this buffet. Yeah,

0:
The buffet.

3:
I didn't anything. It was, like I said, subpar was like grilled chicken, quinoa, cous cous a lot of stuff that Max doesn't know how to pronounce. Much less eat. So he did. Yeah. It, it is true. You didn't touch the health stuff, but when you, when you look at the teams where, or the examples where it has been rigged, quote unquote, you do find a lot of superstars coming outta the tops of those drafts. Yeah. Like you, you might rig it when it, when it matters and you don't rig it when it doesn't really matter. Right. I'm saying I, I tend to believe the guy when he says that it's not rigged. He had a, a great, a great way about him. Good mannerisms. They were nice enough to bring us behind the scenes. But also that shit's fucking rigged and I fucking hate it. And there should be an investigation.

0:
It's every sports conspiracy theory where like if you had a gun to my head and you're like, you have to say yes or no, was this rigged? I would say no. But is life more fun when you can explain the crazy outcomes of things by saying rigged? Yeah, absolutely. It's

3:
Way more fun. And there's just

0:
Yell rigged out loud. It's fun.

3:
It was a big night too for people that don't really have a, a firm concept of probability to just throw out numbers out there. So I had some people telling me that since 2008 there have been five teams that had a 3% chance or less to win the lottery that have won the lottery. So that is something that should happen 3% of the time. But it's happening 29% of the time. Mm. That's not really the case. 'cause there's a lot of teams that have like 3% or less. And when you add up all their odds together Right. It becomes like they actually have, I don't know what it is, 20%, 30% chance. Right. Like

0:
The bulls got the pick that they were supposed to get. The hawks got the pick they were supposed to get. Yeah. And if you have nothing changed with those,

3:
If you have under the new lottery system, if you have a bunch of teams that are like 3%, 2%, 1%, you add up all those percents together and it's like, oh yeah, there's like a 30% chance that one of the teams with bad odds is going to get the top pick. Right. Not individually. Like, not like the, for example, the Mavericks, there was not a high percentage that they would get the first pick, but there was a, a reasonable percentage that one of the bad teams could move up. But it was like every, and you know who really made out like a bandit in all this? We're not talking about them. San Antonio Spurs. Yeah.

0:
They got the number two

3:
Pick. They're flying under the radar because the Mavericks are taking all the heat from

0:
Yeah. But what, what you just said is a good point because I do think that the, the NBA were, they were trying to fix a problem and they've made it kind of worse because they were trying to fix the tanking problem by flattening the odds. Yeah. A few years ago. Which they did where it was now instead of whatever it used to be, it's now 14% is the highest you can get. Odds. I don't think that works because I don't, I still don't understand how a lower market team can get better other than through the draft. And you have to like, I get it, you don't want tanking, but it feels like there's even more teams tanking. Like there was like half the Eastern conference wasn't playing at the end of the, at the end of the season. So

3:
Yeah, if you're, if you're the wizards, how do you get better? Right? How do you get

0:
Better? If you're the jazz you, how do you get better? Yeah.

3:
I think the Wizards may be be a little bit different. 'cause they do have, it is technically a big market in DC but they don't, it's not like a rabid fan base. Right.

0:
But you're the hornets, you're the, like you're, you're the pelicans. How do you get better? Yeah. You have to get drafted.

3:
You have to just hit on Steph Curry in the draft. Right. If you, if you find a guy that slips a little bit and he develops into being somebody that nobody expected, that's one way to do it. But that's very, very rare to do. It's hard to get a free agent. I don't, I just don't know what else the Wizards can do right now. Like it, and if you're a Wizards fan, you're feeling pretty bad about yourself right now because your only solution that you have is Welt. Looks like another shitty year where we win 20 games and then we have to rely on a lottery ball. Right. That's gonna bounce our way to get a player that might end up making a difference for us down the line. Right. There's really not a lot, not a lot that you can do. I, I had the theory tell me if this is dumb Big Cat, if you're the Wizard's front office, do you pick up that phone and do you call Nico and do you say just take a, take a flyer Nico, we will offer you the number six overall pick for the number one overall pick and see what he says.

3:
Yeah, definitely. There's a, the chance isn't zero that he says yes. Yeah. There's a small chance.

0:
No, you gotta you gotta just frame it in a way of like, Hey Nico, if you pick the one, if you take the one overall pick and he ends up not being good, you could get fired. You're dead. If you take the six overall pick, people don't really expect a lot from that player. You could be good dude.

3:
And if he's, if he's, you know, a solid rotational guy Yeah. Then people will be like, damn, Nico knows how to find him.

0:
That's, that's the point. Yeah. Diamond in

3:
The rough point. Anyone can pick Cooper Flag. I could pick Cooper flag right now.

0:
Who, what is the outcome you guys are rooting for the most? I it's, for me it's somehow the Nico trades, the Lakers, the number one pick and gets Luca back. Gets

3:
Luca back. Just a placeholder.

0:
That'd be funny. Also, I think the funniest one, and I don't want this to happen for Mavs fans, but it would be very funny if he's like, Cooper Flag's bad on defense and takes, you know, ACE Bailey? Yeah. It's like, he's just like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm zagging on that. I also, the

3:
Problem, the problem with that is Cooper flag is really good on defense. Yeah.

0:
He's, yeah, no, I, I'm, I'm saying it's not real. It's just, I mean Luke is also really fucking good at basketball and Nico traded him. I do think that the Giannis thing is interesting because Giannis did say that he wants to play in a state with no income tax reportedly. And would that, I I think they, the Bucks would absolutely do that trade right? Yeah. In a heartbeat.

3:
That

0:
Also, I don't know, I don't know what the fair compensation is, but like, if you're the Bucks and you're like, Hey, we're not gonna win with Giannis, but we can get Cooper flag and reset everything. And the Mavs would be an immediate with Giannis.

3:
Yeah.

0:
And Anthony Davis and well Kyrie's out. Did Kyrie have an Achilles too? He

3:
Did. Yeah. Yeah. So little bit old. I could see Eric Adams lobbying the, the state of New York to be like, just suspend income tax for a year. So we can sign Giannis. Yeah. For

0:
Play. Why doesn't a state do that for

3:
Players? Yeah. Just all after. I, I imagine that that would get people very upset.

0:
Not if they won.

3:
That's true. Then they'd be very happy. Alright,

0:
So before we do Hot Seat, cool. Tarone, show of hands rigged or not rigged. Who thinks it is rigged?

3:
Rigged?

5:
I do

0:
Memes. You think it's rigged? No. Oh, so the booth boys,

3:
All lotteries are fair. Oh.

0:
Mm. Okay. It's all sports.

3:
Okay. It's big of you memes. Okay. I wanna give credit to Max though. So when they were announcing the order at one point, Kevin Gandhi, he said that the Sixers are now they've fallen out and they will not get a what? Top Top six

6:
Pick. Top six pick.

3:
Top six pick. And immediately, immediately, the second that he said that Max goes, that's not true. That's

6:
Not true. I looked back at the, I looked back at the footage. I I did not say it immediately. I, I'll hand up. I did not say it immediately because when

3:
The, it was sooner than anybody else said it

6:
Because I was looking puzzled because it didn't make sense. He said that Sixers have fallen outta the top six at like,

0:
Oh, that was a sad cow. Do do

6:
Do do do do.

5:
Tatum underwent surgery to repair a torn Right. Achilles tendon. Catastrophic season ending injury for one of NBA's young faces in Celtics with a long rehab awaiting. He

0:
Did. Damn. They do surgery that fast. I thought they had to let swelling go

3:
Down. It's with the knee. I think with the, with the heel it might be different. Oh

0:
Fuck. I mean, he could be back for the end of next year.

8:
It's

0:
Like a year. Right.

3:
Just worry about the Knicks. Hank worry

0:
About the Knicks. So any statement now

5:
Folks in game five?

0:
How, how many, how, how much of like, percentage wise were you like this, this is just fine.

5:
The longer it was going.

0:
Oh, that's that's mean.

5:
I know they did that. I know because Ingas went down. I mean obviously it was a little bit different, but he went down in the heat series last year.

0:
Yeah. And he was looking weird. Like it was an Achilles. Yeah.

5:
But he was fine.

6:
This is bullshit. If they already did the surgery, they, they must have known like this morning. Why are

0:
They knew last night?

6:
Why are they just reporting this now that that mean?

5:
'cause the, the injury report goes out at four.

6:
Oh

3:
Yeah. Yeah. You with an Achilles, you know, pretty much immediately.

6:
Yeah. But I, I feel like it's just mean to,

0:
Well Steven Cha was the one who really knew it like an hour

6:
After everyone else said it. He said he thinks, thinks he was like, I think this

0:
Isn't, I'm sorry, Hank. That sucks.

5:
Yeah, it does.

0:
I'm sorry.

5:
Fucking a man.

3:
Fucking man. Fucking a man. Don't fuck this guy.

5:
Just gotta beat the

0:
Knicks. You gotta beat the Knicks.

3:
You got this man.

5:
Thanks.

3:
So congrats Max. I'm very happy that you got the number three overall pitch.

0:
Yeah. Wait, so Max yelled out right away. He is like, I knew, well

3:
It, there was upon Max's reexamining of the video, there was like a gap. But he was the first person that I heard say it. And it was pretty quickly after, after they made the mistake on the broadcast. And I kept, I kept making fun of Max. I'm like, no you didn't. You lose her, you dropped out, you lose her. I think he meant to say the Wizards, but somebody in his ear told him that the Sixers dropped and he repeated it because then they cut to commercial and he was like, what the fuck was that? He was like mad at somebody in, in production. He

6:
Wasn't like mad. I think he, but he was just like, what, what the, what the hell just happened there? Because someone was definitely, 'cause he did No, no, it was not the Wizards. 'cause he did say the Sixers will lose their pick. So there's, they were the only team that that like could have happened to. Yeah. So it had to, it had to have been that someone was just wrong about the reporting of like what happened. Which is crazy because he, they said it after like the ninth pick, which didn't make sense because their spot wasn't up yet. So in my head I was like, this doesn't make sense. Unless someone already knew that and told him before they were supposed to tell him. But then when the seventh pick came out and it wasn't the thunder, it was like no.

6:
Then the Sixers keep their pick because that was the only way that we were going to lose it.

0:
Yeah. Alright, well I'm sorry, PFT

3:
That's okay.

0:
Good job. Max coin flip didn't go my way. And NBA rigged

6:
Very rigged. Not

0:
Rigged. I do, I do not think that. Not rigged. I I think that the MAs were gonna get it anyway.

6:
So thank you for the very nice people that showed us around yesterday. Yes.

0:
Very

3:
Nice. Maybe not rigged, but if it was rigged, this is exactly how they would've rigged it.

0:
Exactly. How they'd rigg it. Exactly.

6:
There's probably another team that they could

3:
Have. No Mavs. Not

0:
Really.

3:
Mavs. Do the math. Max do

0:
The math.

6:
Max Bulls. You don't think that they, that

3:
They like the Bulls? No, because LeBron What? Because LeBron, LeBron needed a a, a solid young player. He needed a superstar on his team. So the Mavericks sent Luca over and in exchange the Mavericks, they get the number one overall pick. The Eastern

0:
Conference is gonna be a joke. No, what he's saying is the Bulls, because they want the big market. I think we'll get one eventually.

6:
But you, we've been saying that, how many years in a row have Bulls fans be like, they're gonna rig it in our favor? Well, because

0:
They, because that's the, that's the only hope you can have when they can't tank properly. So I guess we haven't had odds that have been like, I think that if the polls were the worst team, we would just get the first pick. But they just can't. It's, it's crazy. And the, and the Mavs, you know, Mavs fans didn't deserve this.

3:
It's also crazy that the Mavs had won the play in. Yeah. That this wouldn't even be a conversation. Correct.

0:
Correct. I hate the play.

3:
Also credit to pug. He had a great take. He hit us. Oh, that was brutal. He hit us up last night, he said, yeah, but imagine if they kept Luca and got the number one overall pick. How much, how much cooler that team would've been. We're like no pug. Yeah. I had, they would not have gotten a, a lottery pick. It's like they still had Luca. Yeah.

0:
I had to tell 'em right away. It's like Luca on the team probably isn't in the lottery. He's like, oh shit. But it would've been cool. Luca and Cooper Flagg would've been sick. Real sick.

BODYARMOR:
Alright. Should we do Hot Seat? Cool drone. Hank, are you still with us? Physically, He's down so bad. You gotta get to what you, you're sitting on the wood dude.

0:
Hank Hot Seat. Cool. Drunk.

5:
My Hot Seat is the course.

0:
Oh yeah. I had this as well.

5:
PGA championship is this weekend. It's at Quail Hollow. And where's Quail

0:
Hollow?

5:
It's in Charlotte. There has been some quotes from players who are, you know, coming at the course. Pretty, pretty hard. Hunter. Mahan. Mahan. Mahan Mahan. Yeah. Said Quail Hollow is like a Kardashian modern, beautiful and well kept. But it lacks a soul or character

3:
Ish. That's harsh.

0:
Who's more mad? Quail Hollow. The course or the Kardashians?

3:
Mm.

0:
I don't know.

3:
A dishon. This kind of feels like you're provoking the course though. Yeah.

0:
What is the deal with, what's the, what's the issue with

5:
The course? It's a bomber's paradise. There's no real penalty for missing fairways. Like, if you can hit it far, you're gonna be fine. So Rory, Bryson, Scotty, the bombers. Scotty obviously always.

6:
This course sounds awesome. Yeah, that sounds like the perfect

3:
Course.

0:
A bomber's paradise. Yeah.

3:
Well you would say that as a

5:
Terrorist. Justin Thomas gave some other insight. I like hitting bomb. Who's won?

3:
You didn't get it. Max didn't get it. It's okay. He

0:
Didn't get it.

3:
The, the Hamas picture of you at the White House. Yeah. Yeah. A bombers paradigm. Yeah. That's

6:
So, that's so long ago.

3:
So you get, that's so long ago. You get 72 virgins after you finish round. Yeah.

5:
Justin Thomas Also to, to give some more insights, said, I feel like a place like this where it doesn't necessarily require a lot of thought or strategy off the tee. It's generally pulling out driver and just, I need to hit this as far as and as straight as possible.

3:
So Bryson. Yeah. So Bryson's the

5:
Play Bryson Ro Yeah. That's what you would be led to believe. It's also been raining there, so it's gonna be soft conditions. Do

0:
You guys like that? The PGA moved? No. No, I don't

3:
Either. No. It should be us Open. Yeah,

0:
Us open should be right now. Or I guess it would be in a couple weeks, but Yeah. And it is in a couple weeks. It's in June I believe

5:
So,

0:
Yeah. Bother. I like that they finish with P-G-A-I-I, I like that ending. I don't know why they did this.

5:
I agree. So the courses, courses on the Hot Seat, it's gonna be getting a lot of scrutiny this weekend.

3:
The groundskeepers though, they're like Cam Newton like, okay. All right. I see what you're saying. They're gonna fuck with the course a little bit over the

5:
Next, they said that about the, this this course in a Philly. They played this weekend, the cricket club. They said, 'cause it was older that, you know, it was designed before everyone could hit bombs so that, because it's so short, there's gonna be very low scores. But that didn't happen. So

6:
I used to valet at that club. Oh, just cool. Just a little fun fact for everyone at home.

5:
Fun. That is a fun

0:
Fact. I do like though the, the Qua Quail Hollow, the, the 16 through through 18 is called the Green Mile. That's kind of cool. Yep. 'cause it's like really tough, I guess the end of the course. Yeah. Are you, do you have a pick?

5:
I no, Brooks. Oh man, Spieth. Oh

0:
Man, he's so down pat. He doesn't even like golf anymore.

5:
I would like to see, I would like to see Spieth win Brooks, obviously. What's

0:
That? What's that? Memes.

3:
Oh, game five. Hank. I game five.

5:
Oh yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm not, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:
He's good. One, one thing at a time. But

0:
What if game five doesn't go your way? You're gonna have full week in of golf.

5:
Yeah, but that's not gonna

3:
Happen if the Celtics lose. Hypothetically game five. How quickly do you check out on the rest of the NBA

5:
Playoffs? Immediately. Yeah, immediately.

6:
The weather's gonna be so nice. Oh

5:
Yeah. I don't, I could care less. Who wins Care less.

0:
We're golfing on Thursday. We are.

6:
That's not true. You're, you're gonna be so anti Nicks.

0:
What happens if the Celtics lose? Are you gonna golf with me on Thursday still?

5:
We'll see, I don't know. Yes.

0:
Okay. Okay.

5:
This now feels mean. My cool throne is fat. Diabetes cat.

0:
What

5:
Big Cat, what was it? Last show? The show before said you're gonna do what? A full

0:
Reassessment rea

5:
Reassessment on your health. Okay. And then the next, which I have done, you talked about how you eat a box of Lucky Charms every night.

0:
That was one night.

5:
And then yesterday you created a task force of multiple employees at this office to locate and find the best soft serve ice cream machine so that you can buy one and install it in this office.

0:
The cream team.

5:
The cream team. Yeah. It's my cream team. I know. I dunno if that was like, was that, was that part of the reassessment? Like you did the reassessment? Yeah, it was like more soft serve. I

0:
Reassessed my life. There's some things that I can do better. I've already started to like, I did, you know, you you, you comment about the electric charm. Did you not hear about the yellow Cheerios? I eat, I eat those.

5:
Okay. And been eating those in, in at one night. Two nights.

0:
No, those I just eat for breakfast now. It's fucking miserable.

3:
Suck. Also ice cream has calcium. Yeah.

0:
Bones. Yes. I reassessed my life and I realized that a life without constant access to soft serve ice cream is not a life I want to live anymore.

3:
So Hank, are you anti ice cream?

5:
No, I just, cool. Throwing is just fat. Diabetes cat. Whoa,

3:
Whoa. It sounds like,

0:
Whoa. I've already made it very clear too. We're only doing toppings on Friday. We are. We're only doing toppings on Friday.

3:
It sounds like you're anti cream.

0:
Do you like the cream team? Do you think I put a good So it's, it's Zach Jacob and then I've added Ben Mintz as the special advisor to getting shit for free.

5:
No, the only thing you do. No, that's a, that's an elite. Yeah. You've built a great team to, to get us the best software and ice cream machine. You know what money can buy, do it. I don't care.

0:
Really? Yeah, you'll never eat it banned fine. Make the, make the, make the graphic. Henry Locker forever banned forever. Until you apologize and show real remorse. You are not allowed to have a single drop of that thing.

5:
That's good. Keep me honest.

0:
Alright, great. But I'm saying I'm gonna be watching the tapes every night because I know the minute we leave you're gonna go get your ice cream. Everyone else, your obvious, have you thought about it? An

3:
NFL Sunday? If you, if you lose, if the Patriots lose a game, you're gonna want to hit the ice cream machine immediately. Dude. Soft

0:
Serve ice cream doesn't even have calories.

6:
It does. That's suret. Officer

0:
Doesn't

6:
Calories. Yeah, for sure doesn't

3:
Are we gonna have, oh yeah. Are we gonna have, is Ben gonna have his own flavor of minced chocolate chip?

0:
No, I think it's just gonna be, we're gonna keep it simple. Chocolate, vanilla, chocolate, vanilla and twist, swirl,

6:
Twist, twist. Gotta have

0:
The twist and then toppings on Fridays. Cones. There'll be a sleeve of cones. Just

5:
Go on a cruise. Dude.

0:
What?

5:
They have softer machines everywhere on cruises.

0:
I gotta work. I'm trying to make work the best.

5:
Okay.

6:
Hank, you need a vacation. You're,

0:
You're banned. You're

5:
Banned. That's fine.

0:
You're fucking banned. That's fine.

5:
I don't care. I hate tap. I don't care about anything. I also,

3:
I really don't, I think Hank's just gonna plead injury to all this. Yeah. Like anything that he says within 24 hours, they can't be held against him in court. He's grieving. Are

0:
You guys?

5:
I am.

0:
Are you guys all in? Well, no,

5:
I'm not sir. No, I'm not. No, I'm not being New York,

3:
Sir. You're not grieving, you're in denial. That's the I'm focused.

5:
That's the first stage I'm focused on. Game five. Hank,

3:
That's the first stage of grief.

5:
I'm focused on game five. We'll deal with the off season when we get there. Okay.

3:
All

0:
Right. You guys are all in, right? Yeah.

3:
I'll eat you ice cream. All right. Love

5:
It.

0:
Love it. Max.

6:
I gotta put a, I gotta put at least a, some sort of a limit on myself.

0:
Okay. We could do that.

3:
Like a governor. Yeah. I

6:
Gotta, I gotta have, give myself rules of when I can and cannot have ice cream. Got

3:
It. Maybe do like invisible fence. Put a collar on you.

6:
That's not a bad idea.

3:
You're not allowed within five feet of the, of the ice cream machine.

6:
Unless, like certain times because I, I want to have some ice cream, but if I have it, if I have access to it, unlimited access, I will have multiple ice creams every day. Yeah.

3:
Its like, which is with a cat. And you, you set out like a one of those automatic feeders

6:
For it. I should get one of those. I should get one. Yeah.

3:
Also, we should put up a sign. Do not feed this man ice cream. Not so that you can't ask people to get you ice

6:
Cream. Do not feed the max.

3:
Yeah.

0:
Banned.

3:
Sorry for your loss, Hank. Thanks.

0:
We lost ice cream too. I will, I will hear an appeal. I will hear Hank's appeal in court knowing that he is in a very fragile state right now. But he has to clearly at least appeal to get on band. Yeah. That time will probably come. Okay. When you see us just walking around licking a cone, having a time of our life.

6:
The first day of the ice cream, you not getting a cone on, on the inaugural ice cream day is going to be,

0:
Oh, it's gonna hurt.

6:
O opening day has to have, has to have toppings.

0:
I might, oh, definitely.

6:
Opening day has to Well,

0:
We'll probably do opening day on a Friday. Yeah. You can also

3:
Just bring your own sprinkles.

0:
You can bring your own sprinkles. Bring

3:
Own time. Messing

0:
Home. I'm just saying toppings will be Friday only. So that way we keep a little of the calories down.

6:
Yeah.

0:
The cream team is hard at work. Okay. PFD

3:
My Hot Seat.

0:
Look at his face. That's, that Looks like a guy who's down in the dumps and just got banned from ice cream. I don't, I

5:
Can eat ice cream. Just not here. That's fine,

0:
Dude's. Not there's gonna be a soft serve machine. Literally. We might even put it in this studio. Great.

3:
I think, I think what's gonna happen is Hank's gonna sabotage the ice cream machine. No,

5:
I want you guys to be happy.

0:
Okay.

3:
Oh, you don't, that's not true. That's not true at all. Hank. Not.

0:
That

5:
Is not true. It is.

3:
It's not true. When, have you ever wished happiness for us? All the

5:
Time. Yeah. I say it all the time.

0:
Well then you'd let me get an ice

5:
Cream. You guys never, team never do anything. But I root for them to, to do it.

3:
We weren't talking about teams. Why'd you have to go there?

0:
Happiness. I want you guys to be happy. You root for me to be better at eating.

5:
I want you guys to not have kidney stones.

3:
Well, calcium, who knows what kidney stones may,

0:
Calcium could not have anything to do with this.

3:
I said I hadn't changed my diet at all. I hadn't been eating more sodium. And then Mad Dog was like, didn't you just eat 15 days of gumbo? Yeah. In New Orleans. I was like, that's a, that's a valid point.

0:
Yeah. I have changed other parts of my diet. I'm trying to, I'm trying to eat less carbs.

3:
Less,

0:
Less salt. More ice cream.

3:
I'll shoot a diamond outta my dick once a month. If it means I can have ice cream every day. Absolutely. That's, that's a fair trade.

0:
I trade that in a heartbeat. I mean a soft serve machine. It's like a, it's a gold mine. It's a dream of mine. It's the best. I love soft serve ice cream. It's so good. And it's good for you.

6:
Also, ice cream is just carbs.

0:
No it's not. It's liquid. Liquid. Dude. That's just

6:
Not true. True sugars.

3:
You could also

0:
Carbs. Carbs. Here's a list of carbs. Bread, french fries, rice, pasta. Rice. Rice. No rice. I don't even count as a car. White. It's so small.

3:
White rice.

0:
Yeah. It's so small. Think they're

3:
So small. I think the solution is just put up a sign over the ice cream machine that just says frozen yogurt machine. Yeah. Just label it as frozen yogurt.

0:
Yeah. No fat.

3:
No fat. Frozen yogurt. Yep. And then it, but it's just ice cream inside. Yeah. Alright.

0:
PFT. Your Hot Seat. Cool

3:
Trunk. My Hot Seat is jockey's. Okay. Jockeys are on the Hot Seat because the jockey that won the Kentucky Derby, junior Alvarado, he just got fined. He got slapped with a $62,000. Fine. See you later Hank.

0:
All right, see you.

3:
Hank. Apparently he hit the horse too many times with a rice, with a racing crop during it. So he hit the horse eight times sovereignty during the race. And the maximum that you're allowed to hit the horse is just six times. So they find him $62,000. Normally it's just a a 10% fine. And his total purse from the race was $310,000. So he should have been fined three 31,000. But it's his second offense in a calendar year. So they upped it up. Bad boy. They doubled the fine to $62,000. Also kind of the Pussification of America. We can't even hit horses anymore. Yeah,

0:
That is, that is okay.

3:
And then my cool throne is sharks. Sharks are on the cool throne because Trey Hendrickson, the pass rusher from the Cincinnati Bengals give a press conference today. He's unhappy with his contract still. They promised him that they were gonna do a deal, they were gonna work on something and they just didn't do that. They didn't, the, apparently the Bengals did not live up to their end of the bargain when it came to, you know, honoring a verbal commitment to rework something Right. And get him paid. So he kind of rescinded his no trade or he, he had a trade request earlier this off season and he kind of backed off from that 'cause he thought that they were trying to work things through. But then apparently they went back on that. So now he's on the offensive and he said there's provoked shark attacks and there's unpro provoked shark attacks.

3:
And right now he, this is a provoked shark attack that he's doing to the media. Oh. Where he's going after the Bengals and, and complaining about the way that they treated it sounds like he's not gonna play for, he doesn't wanna play the season. He doesn't wanna play. He says that he doesn't wanna play the season. They asked him at this point, do you want to be a Cincinnati Bengal? He said, that's a tough question. And then he talked about animosity and he used the analogy of provoked shark attacks. Okay. That's what, that's what he's dealing with right now. That

0:
Doesn't feel good when a shark, when provoked shark attacks is used.

3:
It feels like that might be the burning of a bridge right there. Yeah. So, I don't know. I guess my takeaway from this is that the Bengals might be the only team that would say, yeah, well we don't give a fuck. We're not trading you. I, I dare you to play, to go the whole season without playing. Right. And so Hendrickson has himself in a tough position. 'cause he does have a contract. He is under contract right now. Huh. And that's kind of the price that you pay when you sign a three year deal or a three year extension. And then you overperform it and then you want to get paid. Now the Bengals are famous for asking people to take pay cuts if you don't play up to your expectation. Right. So the Bengals are gonna have it both ways, but as, as the NFL goes, the teams have a lot more leverage. So I guess Trey's gonna try to just sit out and see if they'll trade 'em.

3:
Yeah. I don't know. I feel like they

0:
Won't. Well, no. They'll trade 'em if they,

3:
If they get a good offer,

0:
They would rather get the asset than, yeah. Alright. My Hot Seat is, is the NFL. 'cause I, we said this on Sunday. I'm so sick of this fucking schedule release week. It sucks. It fucking sucks. Give me the whole schedule. Stop giving me a piece of a game here and there. We found out the Eagles and the commanders are playing on, on, you're not on right now. The Eagles and Commanders are playing on the 20th. Saturday the

3:
20th of December.

0:
Of December. Packers bears. The Eagles and Bears are playing on.

6:
It's just Eagle Schedule Release

0:
Week. Yeah. It's crazy. It's

6:
Just, let's just give another Eagles game in the morning and then another game at night. It's, that's how they're doing it. Driving

0:
Me insane. I fucking hate it. Just gimme the whole schedule. They've completely ruined something that was kind of fun. And now it's just become, 'cause now I'm piecing it all together. We spent, we, we were at the NBA draft lottery, like for 20 minutes trying to piece together what the Christmas Day games might be and like, it's just so stupid.

3:
So it's looking like, yeah, the Eagles have a, a game week 10 Monday night football against the Packers. They are just Yes. It's,

0:
Yeah. They're playing opening day against the Cowboys.

3:
It's been a lot. They did the, the international schedule as well. The commanders are playing against the Dolphins in Spain. The

0:
Vikings are doing in Madrid, the first ever back to back in different countries.

3:
They're going Dublin, then London. Yeah. Steelers. And then the Browns back to back. It does suck. It does suck. Like I, I understand that you want to like each, the problem is it's each broadcast partner that wants to have like their moment in the sun where they get all the attention on one of their games. But no

0:
One asks for this. We're gonna watch the games anyway. Just give us the whole fucking schedule and stop with the leaks and stop with the morsels. Just give us the whole fucking schedule. Yeah. And also fuck you to the people who are like, it doesn't matter. We already know the opponents. That's max how they go matters a lot.

3:
It does. And

0:
Also it also matters for people who are trying to make trips around this.

3:
It also matters if you're like, I really enjoy complaining if you're like the NFL fucked us because we have to play like two games in a matter of six days. Right. You know, like that, that whole shit. Right. Like complaining about getting bad rest when it matters the most when your bi-week is. Yep. It's fun to complain about that. But also you could do all this by just releasing the schedule,

0:
Release the fucking

3:
Schedule, the entire schedule. So annoying. Just mainline it to us. But yeah, we were, we were looking at the Christmas week games and Big Cat and I were like, well fuck, that means that if you do the math, we're gonna be playing each other on Christmas. And then we started planning the part of my take schedule for that week. Yeah. With the understanding that the commanders are probably playing the Bears on Christmas and then all that might be wrong too. So. Yeah. Because

0:
We realized that we were planning it like it was last year when it was Wednesday was Christmas, so they had to, the Saturday games had to be the Wednesday games. This year's Thursday's Christmas. So they can absolutely use the Sunday games for Thursday games.

6:
We also found, 'cause we found out the Eagles and Packers are not playing that Christmas. Right. Which means that, yeah. Right.

0:
So it makes sure that we were, we

3:
Were just

0:
Stupid. We, we were

6:
Just being

0:
Dumb spent. But that's the NFL's fault and all this shit for making us guess Hank still with us.

3:
Nope. No he's not. Hank's been checked out. It's okay. I get it. This is one circumstance. I'll, I'll give Hank a pass. Oh, absolutely. I'll give Hank a pass on this. Absolutely. That's some, that's bad news that he has to do.

0:
It's really, really shitty news. The the long injury thing is, is devastating. It's not. Oh, he's out for two or three weeks. It's, it's devastating. It fucking sucks beyond belief. Alright. My cool throne is, you know what I'm gonna do a reversal. My cool throne is college grads because they're graduating right now. And I see all the pictures and everyone's like, oh, it's graduation. And I'm sure there's some college grads listening right now that are freaking out. Don't freak out. I think we've given this speech before. There's a lot of pressure when you graduate college. 'cause you're like, holy shit, I gotta go in the real world. There's gonna be one friend who's making more money than everyone else. You feel pressure from that. You're 22 years old, you got so much time to figure some shit out. You're probably gonna fuck up.

0:
You're probably gonna ha hate your job. Or you might love your job. Whatever me. Whatever happens. You've got time to fail at a job, hate a job, quit a job, love a job, and then re reimagine yourself a couple years later. You know, you're still 25. You

3:
Know the guys in college that sometimes might not be doing so well and they pretend to their parents that they're doing well. Yeah. And when the in reality they're failing. Do you think there's anybody out there that has told their parents that they did not graduate this year when they did graduate? So they can just go back to school for one,

0:
One

3:
Year. Oh yeah. Definitely. And just hang out in town. Tell absolutely to like, do forge report cards and be like, I'm doing a lot better this year. Guys getting bs. Yeah. Instead of Ds. Absolutely. That would be a hell of a move.

0:
That is though. The one like, 'cause it sucks. Graduating college, that feeling of like, oh shit, my, the four years are over. The one, the one saving grace is when all your friends leave together. Like, I remember going back to Madison like two years after I graduated and I didn't know, I, I knew like a couple people and I was like, well this isn't, this isn't what this college, you know what I mean? My friends aren't here. So you, it doesn't feel the idea of like leaving and having all your friends stay and still doing college. That's not reality.

3:
And you'll be okay. Yeah. You'll be okay. Life gets better. Not worse. Yeah.

0:
Yeah. Right. Hank? Yep. You know what, Hank Unbound Nice. I feel bad for you. No, I feel bad for him. I feel bad for him. He's going through a lot right now. He just privately in, in a moment in the next couple of weeks, just be like, Hey, you know what I was wrong about, you know the ice cream machine? It rocks. That's all I'll ask. It doesn't even have to be public, but un banned because you are going through some shit. Thank you. And Tatum, injury sucks a lot. It does. Yeah. Okay. Game five. Game five on the wood. Joe. Missoula looking You in the eyes. I need

3:
This. Hank.

0:
Come on. Oh no. Memes. Just,

3:
Missoula loves this

0:
Meme. Memes just gave a very sarcastic,

6:
I'm so jealous of memes right now. Just went like this. The fact that he gets to

0:
Be Hank Yes.

6:
So jealous.

3:
When we say that I, I wanna clear something up. We, when we say that we as a podcast don't root for injuries, that's not entirely true because memes definitely roots for

0:
Injuries. Oh, a hundred percent.

7:
No. I had my quarterback taken away four snaps into a season. I don't, I don't wish that on anyone's

3:
What? That's why you, that's why you wish for it now. Like, I want you to, to suffer the way I,

0:
I wish injuries were turned off. Injuries suck. I just don't

7:
Understand why they can't just, I don't understand Achilles. Like why can't they just put it back together?

3:
That's a good point. Yeah.

0:
That's a really good point. Why didn't they think about that? If there's any doctors listening, try that.

3:
Hank would you like just Yeah, I'd

5:
Give him my achilles. Oh,

3:
Would you like to apologize to God?

0:
No, they're still peeing. Yeah.

5:
We'll, we'll see. Later tonight or tomorrow.

0:
What? Do they have a flight you have to take?

5:
Yeah. Shut up. Yeah. So yeah, we'll see you tonight. Yeah.

0:
I'll probably read this, this tonight.

3:
You gotta you gotta make amends. Oh,

0:
You gotta you gotta talk to the G man. Yeah. All right.

3:
Probably do. Also cool throwing all the dead guys in baseball. Oh yeah. 'cause they got unbound. Yeah.

0:
Pete Rose can go in the Hall of Fame. You knew they were gonna do

3:
This. You list Joe Jackson. The, the rule was, I think Manfred said if you're dead then you're off the band list. Yeah. Which is how it should be. Yeah. Like it's a lifetime band. Right. Their lifetime's over. Get 'em off the list. Yeah.

0:
Barry

3:
Bonds also will be in the Hall of Fame one day after he dies.

0:
After he dies. Yeah. He should just fake his death. Yeah. And then show up to Cooperstown. That would rock also. It suck for Oswaldo. Cabrera. That injury was brutal. Yeah. So that's of shame.

0:
Okay, we now welcome on a very, very, very special guest. It is our guy, Keith Yandel. That was three varies. That's better than the none I got last time. You got none last time. I think so.

3:
That's not

0:
True. I always, I always don't know what to do with like our friends and coworkers. You know what I mean? It's, it's a little different because you're, you're our guy and you're, you're our colleague. So it's like Yeah.

3:
A very, very intimate guest.

0:
Yeah. Very intimate guest. It is. Jans. We're gonna talk some playoff hockey. I don't know where we're actually, you know what, let's start with I, you know, we're taping this on Tuesday morning, so the Leafs and Panthers will play game five. But let's talk about that series first because you bang the drum on Sunday night. How much credit do you get for the win? Like dominant win by the Panthers on Sunday night?

9:
I personally took no credit, but a lot of people have been throwing some credit my way. And I am not a guy to sit here and not take it. So I am gonna take it and I don't know how much I deserve of it, but I am taking it. 'cause to be honest, once it like that, once I kind of settled down and was watching the game, I was like, oh shit, if they lose, it's kind of on my head. So then, like, I was all nervous during the game and so it kind of made for a fun, you know, fun 60 minutes. And they played unbelievable the night that I did it. Bob had a shutout. So it was just a lot of fun to be at that at the game. I don't go to a ton of games anymore, just, you know, couldn't during the week. It's brutal going there, but it was, it was a blast.

9:
So fun to be there. And, and they played unbelievably. It was the best game they've played in the Playoffs, especially in this series. It was back to, you know, the way that the peas play. Yeah.

0:
So, so this series, do you, would you say it feels like seven, it feels like we're going seven. Is that fair to say? And is it like, how is, how is you and bi, how are you and biz like, getting on right now because it feels like it's gotten contentious on spitting Chiclets?

9:
Well, we're colleagues right now this week, you know, last week or a week and a half ago, we were, you know, really, really, really good friends and you know, this week we're colleagues. So I think, you know, win or lose, I think we'll be back to where we were before. But I think it's definitely taken a little out of our friendship. You know, the way I just, the way he's been treating people, I've been gracious enough to bring on the show. Just, just this whole antics and everything. He's been foaming at the malt a lot more, so hopefully we gotta get him checked for rabies soon. I know he was supposed to have a doctor's appointment, but knowing him, he probably missed it. But yeah, it's just, he, he, the, the guy's lost in the sauce. Like Whit said, he is lost and you know, he thinks he's a part of the team.

9:
The man never played for the team. He barely played in the NHL. So I don't know how he's claiming another team. He was lucky enough to be on one, so just, yeah, it's just, it's been a lot. It's been a lot of headaches with him this week, but I'm looking forward to the series to be over so we can be back to being and friends.

3:
Yeah. See, I think you're right that you'll go back to being friends if the Panthers win, but if the leaves win, I think it's like, it's even worse if the leaves keep winning. Like imagine the leaves win the Stanley Cup. You might not ever hear from biz again. He might just move into the front office there.

9:
Yeah. But you know what, like I was at the game and even a lot of, a lot of Toronto fans were coming up to me, and I think a lot of them have had enough of his shit. Like,

0:
Oh yeah,

9:
Just a lot of people just, they're like, who, honestly, who is this guy? And then he's taken up our time on, he's sitting at TNT on, on the desk of wearing a, you know, just a being a complete homer. So I think a lot of people have had enough of 'em, including myself. So I think for the betterment of the game and watching hockey, it'll be better for the Panthers to win this series so we can kind of, you know, just agreed, get him off. Talking about, you know, the, the leaves

3:
Agreed. Would do, would you say that you deserve credit for that win? Or would you say that what you did banging the drum was just a, a continuation of the momentum that the Costco guys started when they banged the drum? Mm,

9:
That's what I was worried about. I found out actually as we were going to the game, my kids were like, oh, big justice and Big AJ did it the, the day before. And I'm like, how do I, how do I follow that up? You know what I mean? And then, you know, it, it, it was, it was tough sledding just the, the mental warfare for the 30 minutes leading up. And then, you know, once the puck drops actually during warmups, I could kind of tell, you know, you know, when Bob's in his rhythm, the way, you know, the way he was making saves and warmups seeing everything into his glove. So I knew he was gonna have a good game. So I owe him. I know he, he likes to give out bottles of wine after a shutout, so I'm, I'm actually gonna send him a bottle of wine.

0:
Ooh. I like, so, so in terms of the actual play on the ice, what is it about the Panthers that, 'cause I would assume you're confident that they can win this series even though they have to win at least one game in Toronto. But do you think they're overall the better team? And also, I know we're, we're taping this before the game, like how much justice is, is KA Chuck going to get tonight after that? That was a shitty hit by Domie I would assume. Like in terms of a, like in the locker room, are you guys afterwards being like that? What was that? That wa the game was over and he crosscheck someone into the boards.

9:
Yeah, the tho those are scary, you know, especially when a guy has his back turned and he is that close, but far enough away from the boards where you could go in head first. Luckily Barky is okay, he is a big strong guy. But the best part about it, I, I find is, you know, there's a couple, you know, it's playoff hockey, there's gonna be dirty hits, there's gonna be dirty plays that happen in game one and game two and just everybody in Canada, including biz is bitching and complaining about how dirty, you know, the Panthers are and all this. And then you don't hear the Panthers complaining about anything. They're just all about that business, all about, you know, going to work the next day, getting ready for the next game. But I, I did not like the hit. I thought it was dirty. I think he got a $5,005,000 fine.

9:
Which, you know, it is what it is. But I know Max, I played with him a little bit in Phoenix or maybe he was just there for training camp. But now a good kid, I don't think it was malicious. I don't think he was trying to hurt anyone. He was just trying to get some momentum for Next Game, but definitely didn't like it. But I really liked the way the Florida handled it. Like men, like, you know, the winners that they are and they know what it takes and they'll be ready to go, you know, Wednesday night. Yeah.

3:
Also shout out to Players association because I think that's the maximum allowable fine. Right? They love to say that $5,000 and then they're like, that is the maximum that we can do up to this point. 5,000 c it does seem like a slap on the wrist

0:
Also, by the way, you just said Wednesday night, I'm an idiot. I didn't realize that game Game five is Wednesday night, so this actually all works Yeah. In his preview we're not gonna see another game. Yeah. So, yeah. So is there gonna be, is Ka Chuck gonna go out there and fight right away?

9:
I don't think he needs to. I think they, I think they're, they're gonna play their game. I think the momentum from the last two games at home, they got back to the way that they played the first two games they played in, in Toronto. You know, you gotta give credit to Toronto. They played well, but the, the Panthers shot themselves in the foot. They, they, you know, had very uncharacteristic mistakes. They had four guys on the ice one time to, you know, score a late goal. Bob didn't play his best hockey. I'm sure he'd be the first one to tell you that. So, you know, they lost those two games, but they, they honestly, you know, basically gave them away. So I, I really like where they're at now. The last two games they've played back to, you know, Panthers hockey where they're, you know, just getting pucks and d you watch them play, they're best players.

9:
Every single guy on the team hits, guys run guys through the wall. They're in on the four check. They, they don't make stupid plays when they're playing. Well they did in the first two games, but they haven't the last two. So I just love the way that they're playing and, and they're a team that can, can carry it over and, and, you know, keep building momentum on that and they're gonna be scary on Wednesday. I heard

3:
A, a nasty rumor, maybe you can tell me if this is true or not. Nasty rumor that the leafs hung out on the beach before the game. Mm. And it dehydrated them being out in the sun, that their fair Toronto complexion wasn't built for the South Florida sun. Is that true? Is there any validity to these rumors that I'm hearing?

9:
I did see a picture floating around the internet of, you know, one of the players took a picture with a fan. But I I, I see nothing wrong with that. I'm a big vitamin D guy, as you can tell by my beautiful tan. Yep. 50 shades of white. But yeah, no, no, I, i, you know, it's, it's what you do when you're down here usually, you know, I loved playing, playing down here and then other teams, you know, the teams from Canada, Winnipeg, they'd come in, you'd see the backup goalie the next day on the bench, just burnt red. He knew he wasn't playing. So he, some guys might give it an hour on the beach and, you know, the backup's giving it about three hours on the beach roasting away. But I, I didn't see too many sunburns. So I think that they, they knew what they were doing and they probably rotated, used some SPF, but no, you can't, you, I can't blame them from that.

9:
I, I give, you know, you gotta take in the cities when you go to these cities like you, I mean, you only, you only play in the league so long. You only get to go around these cities. So I I I see nothing wrong with it.

3:
Yeah. It must be nice for the Maple Leafs too, especially when they play, you know, in, in southern towns like Colorado or, or Miami in the United States, they don't get recognized, I would assume, going around town, right?

9:
Yeah. That, I mean, it's honestly one of the best parts about, you know, playing down here and you know, especially now with how good they are. Like the fans are still respectful. They, you know, they appreciate what the guys are doing on the ice, but you know, you can go anywhere you want. You're not gonna get, you know, harassed anywhere. And, you know, I think that's just such a, a, you know, a, a good perk to have a playing down here and you, you still go to the rink. It's the same game once you get in that arena, but you know, when you leave the rink and in your golf cart and, and flip flops and janko shorts, it's nice. Yeah. Yeah.

0:
Alright. So other series I wanted to talk about the Oilers and the Knights. It feels like the Oilers are, I mean they're up three one tell me this though. 'cause Skinner had an incredible, he had a shutout after Saturday night. Was I right in my assessment, like, I don't know hockey very well, but where Skinner was for that buzzer beater was just insane. Like, that was just bad goal. Like you can't be that far out and you have to hug the post there. Is that, is that a correct assessment? 'cause it seemed like something, like how does that happen?

9:
Yeah, I mean, honestly it should have never got to that point. William Carlson, he's, he's, he's one on three dumps the puck in, I think there's eight seconds left at the time where he dumps it in and you know, the, it's one verse three and he ends up somehow getting to the puck and just throwing it to the middle. And luckily Riley Smith was there. So at that point it's kind of just panic time because you know, everyone's, you, you count down the mental clock in your head and you guys, every guy's probably like, oh my God, there's one second two seconds. And then you kind of just, you know, panicking, you don't know where to go. So I'm sure the goalie did the same thing. I'm, I'm sure if it was, you know, 10 minutes left in the game that it would've never happened. But, you know, the panic set in and you know, he kind of just got himself out of place.

9:
But for how dominant, you know, Edmonton has looked like that the win that Vegas got there, like that's the only way that I think they have a chance of beating them right now. It's just like a miraculous win win with 0.4. It's like you can't give Mahomes enough time on the clock. You couldn't give Tom Brady enough time on the clock. That's how the Oilers are right now. You give them enough time, they're gonna find ways to score, you know, whether it's late in the game, you know, clutch goals, they, they, I didn't give them the credit that they deserve coming in. I think I had them even losing first round and they, they've impressed me so much just with their depth scoring. You know, McDavid and Dry Cycle are still playing amazing, but they haven't had to carry the load as much as they have in the past, which is scary for every other team.

9:
'cause I mean, they haven't got going as much as they really could, but, 'cause they haven't had to. Yeah. But I mean, they're still finding a way. They're scoring huge goals. They're getting big assists ga game winners and stuff like that. But you got, you know, Adam Henry, Corey Perry guys just, just, you know, chipping in and, you know, finding ways to win.

0:
Do you believe in Skinner because that was, I mean, that was an incredible, you know, comeback to be like, Hey, here's a shutout because he has, has that happen on Saturday night? I think people, I even saw people tweeting like, he can't play again in this series, which seemed a little knee jerk reaction then gets a shutout on Monday night. Do you believe in him going forward or is that like the, the one, the weak link where you're like, Hey, he's gotta hold up. I don't know if he can actually do it.

9:
I mean, on paper he is definitely the, the, you know, in quotations, the weak link of their team. He, he's an amazing goalie. He's, you know, he's a big guy. He's, you know, he's got really good instincts. But I think last game he just, he really used his size to an advantage and wasn't trying to overplay things. And you know, he, he was just in good position at all times. And I don't think he was tested as much as, you know, other goalies are. I think, you know, even if he plays subpar a little bit, they can still, they can still win this series. But I think it's that next series, whether it's against Dallas or or Winnipeg, is when, you know, when he is getting a lot more pressure, that's when you're gonna really see what he's made of. Yeah. Is

3:
There any chance at all that the Knights have to come back from three one?

9:
Honestly, I, I don't, I don't think so. They look a, I don't know if they, they look a little off right now. They look like they're, you know, just not on the same page. They got some guys going, well, you know, Mark Stone I think is a little banged up. He left, he left game three the other day, came back, he played last night, which was a good sign. But he did, he just didn't look like himself. Jack Eel's been amazing for them carrying the load, but he's just, you know, they're not getting the support that they, that they have in past. And I, I don't think that they can come back in this series against Edmonton. I think Edmonton's playing at a different level right now and, you know, if you only gotta win one more game and you got Leon and Connor, it's, it's always gonna be tough to, to close them out.

3:
Got it. So can we talk about my caps for a second? It's been a, it's been a painful series to watch watching the, the, the hurricanes. Brandon Hockey, it's tough, especially when they're kicking the shit outta you. I mean, it's bad enough if you're just watching 'em casually, but if you're on the receiving end, it's, it's a real tough watch to get through. My takeaway is that the, the capitals, they look like they've lost a lot of the energy that they had at the end of the season and in the first round of playoffs for whatever reason, they seem like they're kind of coming out there flat and we're missing a lot of opportunities early in the first periods of these games. And every time that happens, you can mark that down as being like, that's gonna be the difference in this game because Caroline is gonna get out to a lead and then we're gonna have to press and try to score the third period and then leave things open on the back end.

3:
And their counter attack is so good that they'll just end up scoring if you end up pressing too hard. So my takeaway as just a casual, is you gotta score on the opportunities early, but what have you seen from the series?

9:
Yeah, that, that's a good breakdown of that. I think last night was the first time that there's even been a goal in the first period for either team. So Washington still hasn't scored in the first, I think they only have one goal in the power play this series, which is, you know, if you're a capitals player or a fan, it's, that's how you guys, you know, make your, your bread and butter is scoring on the power play it, and it, it's, it just hasn't been able to get it. I think, I think Washington does a really good job of suffocating teams and, and you know, not only five on four, but five on five, their defense, their defensive zone, they just play really fast. They get on you. Not a lot of teams play the way that they do.

9:
I I, I mean this series is so boring to, it's basically it's like the, the late nineties, early 2000 New Jersey devils kinda sit back in the rocking chair and, you know, not let you get through the neutral zone and then just pressure the shit outta you in the defensive zone. But hey, at the end of the day, it's winning hockey Rod Brenda Moore gets all of his guys to buy in. He gets, you know, everything out of his guys. He doesn't, he doesn't have the one big superstar he is got, you know, guys that just, you know, come in there, check their ego at the door and play, play hard for 'em. So it, it's definitely not a fun series to watch, especially if your team's losing to them. But, you know, if you're a Carolina fan and at the end of the day if you're hosting that trophy trophy in, in in June, it doesn't matter how you did it.

9:
But yeah, this one I think, I think you're a hundred percent right, they have to score early. If I was the capitals and, and you know, Carberrys done an unreal job there, I would, I would just go full. I, I'd pull my goalie in the first period, get a six on five, why not try one in the first. I hear

3:
You. The the canes are so dangerous on that counter attack when they, when they muck up the neutral zone. And I I think our only power play goal is that a five on three situation. Yeah. It wasn't even five on four. And it seems that even when we've got a power play, the hurricanes are the ones that are getting the better scoring opportunities on the counter attack. They're having more opportunities for, for shorthanded goals than we are. Having solid opportunities on a five on four is crazy watching. So credit to the hurricanes, they're, they're obviously a, a very good team. I don't particularly like watching them play, but if there's, if there's a way to turn it around, I think that if the caps win game five at home, it might go seven. That's my, that's my take. I gotta do it one game at a time. If we win at home, then I think we're gonna go into Carolina and win Game six.

9:
And I, i, I gotta give a shout out to and put some respect on his name is is Tom Wilson. Like he's obviously, you know, he's been around a long time. He's an unbelievable player, but I think he is a bonafide star right now. Like he should be on that Olympic team. Yeah. You know, got, no one wants to play against him. He does everything for that team Power play penalty, kill five on five, amazing leader as well. So I think, I think you gotta talk about him a little bit more of how good he is and how much he can impact a game. And also Logan Thompson, he's been amazing. Like, and a couple bad ones in, you know, game three I didn't love, but you know, he, he, he played decent last night, you know, he just, you know, he is getting no run support and you know, but they are a team.

9:
They've done it all year. They've played well. They've, you know, they've, they've found ways to win games and I think, I think you're right. If they can go home and get a big win, get the momentum going. But it's that building in Raleigh too. It's a tough, tough building to play in like the, unless you like, you know, chain restaurants, they get you, when you land, you go into a chain restaurant, you're staying at a decent hotel, not great. And then, then you go into the la the the away locker room's. Awful. So it's kind of, it's a mental game too from the minute you land there to the minute the game's over. Yeah.

0:
It, it might be Loser Talk, so I'm not gonna say it, but I, if I were to do Loser Talk, I would say it's important to remember in perspective this cap season was way better than anybody ever expected. I'm not gonna say that, obviously, because we're still playing. I'll say it. Yeah. Big Cat was about to say it. So I I was gonna say like this cap season watching, like I, it's way like we, we've outgrown the expectations. That's, that's Loser Talk though, focused on winning this series. It's about winning the, the Stanley Cup, but it's been an incredible season. I'm not gonna say that.

9:
Yeah, I mean if it ended today, we'd be happy with it. Right, right. Has fans of the capitols and a puck, we would like it. And yeah, I mean obviously everything with, oh, what, what Ovie did this year, I think, I don't know if their social media team did a, did a really good job just getting clips out of, you know, Carberry talking to the team. It just seems like such a cool tight-knit group of, I've talked to their assistant coach there. He just says like, the guys love each other and you know, every, every coach says that. But like he said, these guys absolutely love each other. We had James Van Reams dike on Chiclets yesterday and his brother's on that team and he said he, he went to his nephew's one first birthday and there was like 15, 20 guys on the team over at the, at his house for the, for the party.

9:
So you, you can tell that they're a, you know, galvanized group. They, you know, they love each other and easy team to root for, you know, I think everybody wants to see them move on here and you know, just, you gotta win one more, just win one at a time. PFT one at a time,

0:
One at a size on the prize, one at a time. We're a GA or our team, we've, we lead the league in being a ga Are you familiar with a ga

9:
No,

0:
That's our team motto. It might, it might be the team motto of death we're a, a ga. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're wide open. Yeah. I I I got a strategy question for you, YZ. Like when we get deeper in the Playoffs, you'll see teams switch up lines later in a series like, like the Blackhawks Quinn used to do like TAs and kain in on the same line when, when it got like to game five, it's like, you need to win. What does that ha what happens in the locker room when the coach switches up the lines in, like obviously you play defense, so he's probably not switching that up, but like what, what is the vibe like and what is like the mentality when it's like, all right, hey, we're loading up the first line and now everyone else has to figure it out.

9:
Yeah, it's kind of, especially in playoffs when it happens during the regular season, it's kind of like, oh God, you kind of like, hey, what, what about us? We can play with these guys too, but when it's playoff time and no one cares about their stats or all you care about is the wins and you know, I think when you're in the locker room and you see like, I could only Ima if I was in the Edmonton locker room as a defenseman and you see on the board before the game, McDavid dry Seidel and whoever Corey Perry, you are just itching to be on the ice with them. 'cause you know it's gonna be fun. You know, you're gonna have, you know, snapp it around the offensive zone, you're gonna, you're gonna be high flying. So I think a lot of it too is just kinda, and especially in playoffs too, like those other three lines have to be like, Hey, we gotta do our job of just, you know, holding the fort down a little bit, maybe pitch in with a goal or two and then we let these big dogs eat.

9:
And you know, that that's the best part about playoffs is nobody cares what happens, like where you're playing, whether you're a healthy scratch or not, if, if your team's winning, everybody's happy. And, but, but it, and especially as a, as a fan watching when the big boys get put on the same line Yeah. And they're playing and, and it's kind of just like all out pond hockey. It's, it's so fun to watch. Yeah.

0:
The supercharged lines always like pump me up when I see it at later in Playoffs. They're like, oh, they're just going, they're going for it. They're just gonna basically be like, this line will win this game for the team. What about in terms of like the, the course of the playoffs? 'cause you had some deep runs. Is there a point where, not that it drags on because playoff hockey in your pump, but where it's like, okay, this is where you have to, you know, focus a little bit more because exhaustion does start to take a toll?

9:
Yeah, it's probably, it's probably right now, like halfway through the second, the second series is you're, you're mentally you're coming down from the high of being in, in the playoffs now you're traveling a little more. You you, you're not getting the sleep that you're getting every night or that you're supposed to be getting every night. 'cause you know, your blood's pumping after the games. You, you gotta be up having meetings and practices and whatnot the next day. So I think right now is probably that time where your body's like, holy shit, what are we doing to myself right now? And like, you know, you really in the fight and, but it's also at the end of the day, it's the best time of the year too. 'cause you're just playing hockey. That's all you care about. That's all you worried about.

9:
You're not dealing with shit at your kid's school or you know, going to the grocery store to pick up stuff for your wife. It's strictly hockey and you know, that's why you play. Yeah,

3:
We gotta talk about Mika Ranon because what he's doing is absolutely insane. Yep. Although they, they did prove that they can score without him. I think he had how many goals in a row was it that he either assisted on? It was 13. Yeah, 13 consecutive goals that he either assisted on or personally scored that that streak came to an end in their last game. But he does have nine goals and six games. He's got nine assists in the postseason. Is this the, is this the craziest one man performance that you've seen in the playoffs?

9:
Yeah, I mean I think just the whole, you know, everything surrounding it too. And with him being traded to Carolina not wanting to get traded and then being flipped to Dallas. And I love the fact that it's almost a little NBA Aish is like he, most hockey guys will be like, oh yeah, it is what it is, it's the trade. But he's like, I wanted to, I wanted to come to Dallas so I could shove it up their ass. Yeah. And he did it and he, and he's got the entire hockey world like flipped on its head. He is got guys that used to play with him, you know, answering questions of, you know, why the hell did you trade him? You know, guys weighing in that used to, you know, play with him even that aren't on the team anymore are weighing in on Twitter.

9:
Naam cadre was like, this is why you don't trade the big boys. And you know, it, it, it's bringing a little drama to the game, which is always fun. But he, you know, he's living up to his nickname of the horse, the Big Horse. And he is absolutely on a mission right now. And to go into a team, you know, I think he only played what, 10 or 12 regular season games with them. So it's not a ton of familiarity with your players. I know, I know he's, you know, country mates with Ru rupe hints so they have a little chemistry together but it's really hard to go in and, you know, not have that much time with a team and to be playing this good 'cause you know, a lot of tend, you get you, you figure out how guys like to play where guys like the puck, the tendencies of, you know, where guys are gonna be in the ozone D zone and the fact that he's figured it out this quick and you know, at the end of the day I think he's just like, Hey boys, hop on my back and and enjoy the ride.

9:
And he is, he is putting on an absolute clinic right now. Yeah. The

3:
Big horse. I love that nickname. The big horse. Yeah, I've heard, I've heard people call him the moose too. I don't know, I've Moose is another one. What's the difference between having a horse on your team and having a moose on your team?

9:
Well, when you got both of them, I mean, if you have two nicknames it's a horse and a moose, you'd rather that, I don't know, I'd probably rather a horse 'cause I feel like they're a little faster. Yeah, I mean a moose is both beautiful animals too, so I mean, I dunno, I'd rather have a horse. What would you rather have? I don't,

0:
I think a moose for hockey,

3:
You gotta have a moose like

0:
Yeah because a moose is like cold weather like Canada. Like that's, that's

9:
He's in Dallas though, so he might die.

0:
That's true.

3:
Yeah, that's a good point. That's good. When I hear people say like, oh yeah, we got this horse. I feel like that's a, a fast guy scores a lot of goals. But you gotta have a moose if you wanna win a cup. I I actually,

0:
If I, if I could do, if I could off script here, I think I'd rather an ox and ox is just built for work. You know,

9:
He, he's legit. He is. Well I was talking to Witt about it the other day, like I remember my first couple years in the league playing against Yme Jager and Wayne Gretzky. I remember in the pre Prec scout meeting he was like, Hey, if he turns his back on you, like you'll never get the puck. 'cause he was just so big and so strong and used his ass so good. And that's exactly how Rantin is. Rantin is the, you know, from when I played against Yagar till when I played against Ranon, like the two of the only guys that you're like, oh my God, if he turns his back on you, there's no way of getting the puck. 'cause they're just so big and so strong and use the Reds so good. And yeah, he he he he's a specimen and I honestly do not know how they traded him.

9:
Yeah, yeah.

0:
It's crazy. It's crazy. So, alright, so in that series, the other question, 'cause that game is tonight, so we are taping before Game four. Hella Buck has been really bad on the road. It's crazy. Yeah, I think they've had 10 games total in the playoffs. 34 goals he's given up. 21 of them have been on the road. So what is that like? What is it mental, is it what's going on and is there a fix?

9:
Well I think the first series he, he got a little bit too much heat I think. 'cause the play in front of him was awful. They, it, the, the games that they lost on the road against St. Louis, obviously he didn't play great. He led in a couple, you know, not so great goals. But I I truly believe that the team was dog shit in front of 'em too. That they were, they weren't playing their best. And yeah, I, I heard an interview with Jesus, what's their captain's name, whatever, you know, and, and he, he and he admitted it. He said that, you know, they, they weren't playing a Lowry and he was like, we're not playing good in front of him. We're, we're not giving him a chance to win. And you know, they were taking accountability for it.

9:
But it, it's something you gotta figure out if you're gonna go on a, on a run and, and win a Stanley Cup, you gotta win on the road at some point. And you know, right now I think Dallas is, is is a team I I I see going further. I see them winning this series and, and it's strictly 'cause of Ottinger too. Like he does not get rattled whether he is home or away. He, he kind of plays the same game. He's not like the goals that he's, that hella buck's given up. He looks like, you know, sometimes like, like Skinner the other night, like where he is way out of position where goal tenderers are usually never out of position and he, he's just not playing the game that he played all year. And you know, when you win, I think this will be his third bena and you know, people just expect you to have a shoutout every game.

9:
Obviously that's not gonna happen. But, you know, I I I think he's also one of those guys too. He, if he gets a road win it could flip something in his brain where he just goes on a complete tear and, and it and it'll be tough to score against them.

0:
Alright, so obviously you're gonna pick the Panthers to come out of the east. Are you, do you want it to be a another Chi do you want it to be a Chiclet Stanley Cup where it's you versus Witt or you think that it's gonna be the, the Stars?

9:
I've said it from the beginning that it, it's gonna be Panther Stars. So I'm sticking with that but, but this Edmond team does scare me a little bit even thinking, you know, don't want to think too far ahead, but if it was a playoffs, you have a revenge tour of, you know, McDavid you know, losing last year, you, you can just, you see the videos of him in the locker room pissed off after throwing stuff around the locker room. And you can almost just see that as like the start of the DVD, the championship DVD for this year. So that, that stuff scares me a little bit. But you know, we're still a long ways away from that. I I I'll still stick with Dallas coming out of the west and Florida coming out of the east and you know, just another, no, no Tax City Stanley Cup finals.

9:
Yeah.

0:
So if, so if the Oilers somehow hoist the cup, are you ready to pick up the slack and come on PMT more often? 'cause I don't think we'll ever be able to have wit on again.

9:
I think wit might move, move to Edmonton and just become like May or or or coach or gm. I think he'll, but the good thing about him, he's not lost in the sauce. Like what, like biz is and and he played for the team, right? Like he was a part of that organization. Yeah, I I I feel like Wit's been very calm this playoffs, which yeah, you know, it, it's Repe. He's got three kids now so maybe he's a little tired perspective.

0:
Yeah. But we just can't like the, the the, he he has been a lot more calm but we can get him rattled up by just saying Connor McDavid hasn't won the big one. Even though I love watching Connor McDavid wa play the game. I understand it's a team sport. I don't actually think like he's a choker, but it's fun to say that to Whit and watch him get upset.

9:
It is fun. And, and I mean anytime Whit's upset is always fun. 'cause he gets really passionate about things and, and you know, he, he'd he'd die for his team. He loves the Oilers. I think he's probably regretting them right now, you know, all year having to watch the late games and be up late and you know, early wake up at six in the morning with the youngins. Isn't that fun? But you know, he, he's a ride or die, you know, even through their tough times during this season, he sticks with them and so you, you gotta give him respect. But I, I'd much rather Edmonton win than than Toronto and see Bizz antics than

3:
True. That's fair. Yeah. Also, just remind Whitney that I think he retired a Panther, right?

9:
I think Yeah, his last year in the NHL was the Panthers. Yeah. Yeah. So

3:
If he goes in the Hall of Fame then he goes in as a panther. Did he

0:
Go to a, a camp with the blues?

9:
He did. Yeah. Him and him and Biz. Yeah.

0:
That's a big white,

3:
Both be blue. Well what's crazy with, with biz, I heard this on Chiclets the other day. Biz has, he's evolved from saying we, you know, with the Maple leaf sometimes we do that on, on, actually we do that a lot on Pardon My Take. We're like, yeah, we, us when referring to the team, he's jumped all the way past that. Now he's saying I, instead of we he's saying like I gotta be better in the next game. Like he has, he's taken on the entire team as him. The the ego on this guy is incredible.

0:
Oh,

9:
Did, did like he's not working TNT and he's going back to his house in Wellen, Ontario. I need to find out where he wouldn't tell me where he is watching the game. And I need to, if I find out where he's watching the game, I will get Twitter just to tweet out where he's gonna be and I will fly any Panthers fan to where he's just to torture him the entire game. I so if you guys could do me a favor and be like, Hey, where are you watching the game? 'cause he won't see, actually he'll never see this. No. No. So he, if you could, if you could do that for me, find out I'll

0:
Text him right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And usually like you don't even need, I don't even think you need a Panther fan. I think you need like a biz super fan that just wants to talk his ear off.

9:
No, but he's so like, he loves himself so much. He would love that.

0:
That's

3:
True. He was seriously like, I I gotta do be I gotta be better on the power play.

0:
Yeah, yeah.

9:
He's got, yeah, he's never played a minute of power plays an entire life. Anything him with, you know, they got five of the best players in the league on their power play, but it's his fault did start, you know, you should do have oldie, oldie should text him, be like, Hey, where are we watching the game?

0:
Yeah,

3:
Good call. Good call. Yeah. Use oldie to get to him. He'll never see it coming. Yeah. Yeah. I think the soul circuit is whiz like, or biz got a, he got like a maple leaf jersey right? Or like a jacket. The team sent him a jacket am and then like a little kid that gets a, gets something from their favorite team. He now thinks that that's his team.

9:
No, no. The reason why he, he thinks he's a part of the team. Yes. 'cause that ambassador's jacket that Brendan Shanahan gave him, but he claims that when he was put on waivers from Pittsburgh, that Toronto, that Toronto and Phoenix put a claim in for him. And the way that it works in hockey, if you know you get put on waivers, anyone can claim you and then if multiple teams claim you, whoever came in a lower position the year before Right. Gets you So in Phoenix they finished lower than Toronto. So he ended up in, in Phoenix, which I still don't even believe that because Toronto, I, I can't imagine they needed a guy like him back then.

9:
They had like Jay Rosehill, they had Colt nor they had tough guys and I, I can't imagine they wanted biz at any point. Yeah,

3:
That's an all time stretch too. To be like they they kind of wanted me I think. Yeah. So now they're,

0:
I

3:
I've dedicated my life to them. Yeah.

Rollback:
Alright. Re has, this has been awesome. I got one last question for you. It's a Rollback question. R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo code. Take 20% off your first purchase. Q ZIPPs polos hoodies, joggers shorts, Rollback dot com, promo code take. So my last question, very important question because you obviously hockey is your life. You love hockey, you want the league to grow, grow, grow. Are you worried at all for a potential Panthers, hurricanes Eastern Conference final and losing the Henry Lockwood's of the world? 'cause Hank has said he's out, he's out. If it's Panthers, hurricanes, What? I mean, that's probably what it's gonna be. Yeah. He's so, he is out. So are you worried about losing the Hanks of the world?

Gametime:
No, I, I, I think Florida will, I think that the way that they play will kind of take away from the way that Carolina plays. They play so hard and fast. I think they'll kind of, both teams will play like each other. Both teams will play more of a Florida style type game. I think they're just doing what they can do right now to, to Washington. It's a good game plan. They're suffocating them. But I think against Florida, you gotta have a completely different, you know, game plan. And the game will be completely different. It'll be a lot faster, a lot more uptempo, goal scoring and Yeah. And even too, when you're in the Eastern Conference finals, it's, it's always must watch tv. So Hank will dial you back in and, and it'll be a fun series no Matter what. Did you hear Hank when we, when we started the playoffs? He said that he, he didn't know the Bruins didn't make it until he looked at the playoffs schedule and didn't see them there. They were terrible. Yeah, they locked off. He said he looked at the schedule, he is like, Hey, where's the Bruins game? Oh my God. Alright. Yeah. And you the past, everyone listen to Spit and Chicklets. They're doing awesome live shows too during the week. They're doing watch along. So they got the best hockey content this time of year by far all year. But especially this time of year.

And now here's Pablo Tore.

10:
And now for something completely different.

0:
Okay, we now welcome on a very, very, very special guest. It is Pablo Tore. He is an investigative journalist. Very good at it. And you can find him at Pablo finds out, which is his podcast, which you you launched what? A few months ago and it's been very successful.

11:
Yeah, it's been less than two years. I believe I have the credibility to quote Hank as a full journalist. So it's it's really good. You

0:
Yeah. So everyone go, go listen to this is where the, the reporting on. Can we call her? Can we keep calling her? Jordan? I know you stopped calling her Jordan.

11:
I I feel like you guys, you guys are empowered to do that. I miss it. Okay. I miss the feeling when I listened to you guys, I'm like, oh, that felt, it always felt good to just read it the way that it's spelled. But when you, when you interview 11 separate fucking people about someone, it's like I should probably just call her the way that she wants to be called. Yeah, yeah.

0:
Could slip back and forth if you're doing that many interviews. Yeah, that's good. You lose track of the bit. Yeah. So, alright, so before we start, I think journalists to journalists, 'cause we are journalists as well. Absolutely. I think we have absolutely to just lay all of our cards on the table and emit any of our bias or any, any ulterior motives. We'll start. We're team Jordan, because Hank told us that if we ever want to get Bill Bell check on the show, we gotta be Team Jordan. So we ride with our queen. Your reporting seems bad and wrong. Which hunt? Which hunt? You have your sources. What about, what about our sources that say that you're just jealous of their love. Yeah. So that's our bias.

0:
Do you have any bias?

11:
Yeah, I strongly disagree with Joshua l Zuckerman, her former boyfriend of some 60 years, sort of an age when he calls, hold on, let me just get the review that I mostly disagreed with, and this wasn't in the episode, but when he called a plavac Molly 2012 quote. So lovely. So perfect. So summary. So red, so strawberry, so refreshing. So lightly acidic. So watermelon, so strawberry. So lovely. So enjoy it. I felt that was a little bit, that was like a, that was a little mush. That's not a five star review. You,

0:
You have to admit though, he landed the plan on that one with the so enjoy it. And he came back. Yeah, he came back to the strawberry.

11:
So strawberry. It was so strawberry most of all. Yeah. Yeah.

0:
Alright, so, so it it talking real here, I guess like from the start, the reason why your, your podcast is successful and I I enjoy it very much, is you do do real journalism on sometimes trivial topics. And I would say this is probably a little bit of a trivial topic, although there is some weird, like, hey, this is the best coach of all time. What the hell's going on? So when did you start, when you were like, I'm gonna go down this path. Like I'm actually going to figure out what is going on here. Yeah,

11:
So my show, the premise is explicitly we take stupid things seriously and also serious things stupidly. And in this case, it started when we saw the Super Bowl commercial. And for those who are familiar with Jordan's, Jordan's internet presence, you're like, oh my god, she's in it. She, she, she, the girlfriend is in the ad and I started making calls around why it is that she was in that Super Bowl ad, you know, the height of American success and commercialism. And it turned out that she had appointed herself Bill Belichick's agent and was the one negotiating with Ben Ale and Matt Damon. And at that point it was like, this is a stupid thing we can take seriously. But what I underestimated is the degree to which it was also like a story about real power dynamics with the highest paid employee, a public employee in the state of North Carolina.

11:
And so really that episode, which we did in February of this year, ended up being this lighthouse where a lot of people behind the scenes were like, oh my God, someone's finally noticing what our lives have been like behind the scenes as Bill Belichick launched, I think like a half dozen media properties simultaneously out of the same New Jersey studio where they do the NFL film stuff. And so it all was kind of weirdly coalescing in a very defined way. And that's when I said I should probably just start making every call that I can.

3:
So we appreciate you doing that because the podcast was fantastic. I learned a lot. It was also fun to hear how you guys discussed it. One of the, one of the more explosive claims from it was the underdog commercial that this was a pattern of Yeah. Of Jordan inserting herself into multiple commercials now where she said, okay, I've got an idea, maybe a better idea for this commercial where it's Bill and her at the pool. She's trying to get, get his attention. You said that they might have filmed it, but they also might have just pretended to film it to satiate her and her request. Have we made any progress on that? Do we know if there's actually any film of this?

11:
I, I am, I am actively working on acquiring confirmation around whether I can get that video that may or may not exist. That's a lot of clauses to sort of protect what, I don't know, just know that this is, this is one of the, look I have holy grails in my life when it comes to videos. One of them was published on the show last year. It was the Nick's recruiting video for LeBron that had the last scene that James Delini ever did as Tony Soprano in it. And also, you know, Jim Dolan's list of super friends, all recruiting LeBron in the secret video. We got that video. This one I am actively working on still.

11:
I can tell you though, that when it came to how that scene unfolded, I mean just imagine, just imagine Bill Belichick showing up. He is this guy, this is by the way a lot of like New England fans on that set, right? So this is people who look up to Bill Belichick and they have to figure out like, is Bill okay with what's happening? And Bill Belichick, I'm told just like had no change in his face as his girlfriend showed up unilaterally deciding I'm wearing a yellow polka dot bikini now and it's time for us to shoot a scene. And it was just like, okay, we gotta make this happen somehow. And I'm tracking down the people who may actually have the answer to my question.

0:
Alright, so, so, so in terms of timeline, you were already investigating what was going on when the famous CBS interview happened. Is that right? Yes. So the CBS interview happens and that was, it's it's, it's crazy because it felt like Jordan was basically trying to not, she was trying to hide something, but it had the reverse effect where everyone was like, holy shit, what is this? And everyone started looking at it. So when that happens where you're like, oh, here we go. Like this is, this is now going to be a huge story that people want to talk about.

11:
Yeah, I was really worried at first that I was gonna be beaten on the story that I was very early on, but what ended up happening actually was that people felt like we were at a last straw kind of a moment. So a lot of the stuff with Carolina, frankly, the timeline of this, that stuff changed when it came to the administration and the higher ups at the university because of CBS. Like a lot of the conversation behind the scenes has always been who's gonna tell Bill, right? Who's gonna tell Bill that this is a problem? And the CBS thing was the number one example to date of just it being forced into a public forum in which every tabloid was demanding answers.

11:
And also CBS itself was saying, Hey, this statement that was released about the agreement that Jordan Hudson and Bill Belichick and CBS had, that's a lie. That's not true. And that is something that I reported as soon as it was happening and I can confirm, yes, there was no agreement, all that stuff, but that was the, it was really the tipping point that actually unlocked a lot of sourcing on this, which was good for me as much as I feared it at first. Yeah.

0:
Do do you have the footage of the CBS interview uncut? Because I would assume there was, from everything I've read, there was more than one interruption during the course of that interview, and obviously there's been reported that it was a a 30 minute walkout.

11:
Yeah, no, I've, I've, I've confirmed that there's like 30 minutes of video. It's a lot of her giving hand signals, you know, again, Spygate style one might even stay. I love that hand signals that there are people who are on set at CBS who are really irritated actually if they haven't released it yet. Because this is, again, you guys, our instincts are the same here. Like everyone would love to see that. But the, the, the comedy of like, what that was is that this was CBS Sunday morning, right? So like they're like, we don't, we don't wanna do that. They didn't wanna do any of this. They handled this, even, even the expose around like here is Jordan Hudson behind the scenes and the way that she didn't realize she was on camera that was handled so classy that it just sort of indicates that they don't actually want to pick a fight about this.

11:
It's just that they were driven to the point where they couldn't do any of the other stuff that they wanted to do. Like what I was told about that day was, and I don't think I, I've said this elsewhere, but like Belichick shows up late because he's on the phone. It's a recruiting thing. And so there's a bit of a sort of like a mess as they show up. It's his old high school in Annapolis, Maryland. The whole thing was that was the Navy sweaters by the way. Like she says to people that she picks his clothes out for him by the way. And so they have these navy sweaters, his is full of holes. People have asked me, have you heard whether those holes are like, you know, if that stolen valor, like the, the the game worn ness of it, is that real? Did she take a car and run it over a bunch of times that was asked to me and I was like, I I don't know the answer to that question, but the thing about what happened was they never got to the part where they like actually say, and we're at the high school where Bill Belichick was and they do the walk and talk, you know, the walk and talk.

11:
Yeah. They never got to do the walk and talk because the thing exploded because of this question that again, as everyone now has, has seen I think the acknowledgements of the book, like one of the first people he thanks is his idea Mill and Creative Muse, who I am told separately did in fact come up with the idea for the book. And so when they asked the question, how'd you guys meet? The idea that this happened in that way is so flabbergasting to everybody that they had no choice but to acknowledge it in the thing they put on air.

3:
Right. Do you have any idea why she didn't want him to answer that question? I know it's been speculated that maybe there's a, a reality show coming out or some show between the two of them where she's like, that's, that's RIP and so I wanna save that. I don't want to give that away on, on CBS Sunday morning. Yeah.

11:
The two theories, the two clubhouse leaders, And we don't look in, in fairness to Jordan Hudson, right? Like I emailed her, she did not respond. I don't know her point of view on these things. All I can do is report as exhaustively as I can around this stuff. But there are two clubhouse leading theories. One is the one that I also Yeah, I I I believe is quite real, is that she, she has this understanding of exclusivity where if she says something in one interview, she can't then sell it to a different outlet for a reality show, for instance. So another subplot of the CBS thing that I was told by the way that the whole thing they wanted to do at first, the original idea for it was not Annapolis, Maryland, it was North Carolina. And that makes sense, of course everybody would, that's like good press. But Jordan was the one, or at least she had a very controlling interest in saying, we can't do North Carolina because we're doing that for something else.

11:
And maybe that was gonna be hard knocks. Maybe that was gonna be the other thing. But that was not, the whole high school thing was supposed to be North Carolina and she was instrumental in saying, we're not doing North Carolina. And so the next theory just on top of that, and I don't think I've SI I'm realizing how much I've spent, it's just, I just, I didn't have enough time in the episode for all of this stuff. So my memory is being jogged out. But the other thing is that she didn't want to acknowledge her actual age at the time that they met. And this was something that we pieced together because we pulled, and this is one of the creepiest things I'll ever say. We pulled Miss Maine footage from last year And we were like, she says Jordan Hudson Hancock 22.

11:
And that pageant was in March, right? Ah, so last year, March, 2024. She's 22 February, 2021. Logically she would be 19 years old.

3:
Okay.

11:
19 old,

0:
Which I like. So obviously there's a big age gap that makes some people uncomfortable. Not gonna disagree with that, but 19 and 20, they are both oh my, over 18. So that's the weird part to me. Why I don't understand why they like 19 and 20 makes a huge difference from their perspective. It's already, the age gap is already what it is. There's no,

11:
I fully agree. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my, my whole thing here is not like, man, now we've crossed a line. It's, I'm right frankly like Bill Belichick's Yums, I'm not here to yuck any of 'em. Like whatever you want, dude. Like I, it's just not my, not my, not my issue. What I'm doing though is trying to figure out a consistency of like how she presents and tells the truth or not around who she is and what she's up to. And when it's coupled, all of that is coupled with this thing that I reported about how there is this staff directory basically that was passed around the UNC wives and girlfriends of the coaches in which she put her age as April, 2000 instead of April, 2001.

11:
Again, the exercise here, and this is, it's just, it's stupid the degree to which we got into detail on this, but look at your keyboard. Look how far apart the zero and the one are. Yeah. It's just hard to accidentally mistype your own birthdate when the difference is zero zero or zero one. And so people are saying combined with Instagram sleuthing, and by the way his Hick's family is, is in, again, in a parallel way, looking at all of this stuff even more deeply than me, you can imagine. And they're saying to themselves, hold on, there are these Instagram posts that used to have explicit like birthday details that have been edited out of posts. That's what I was told.

11:
I'm not, I I'm not, I haven't gone through, I don't have the before and after on that. I just know that people have been noticing that she has been cleaning up what age she says she is. Have

3:
You gone back at all through like the manning cast, all the appearance, all the appearances that like Belichick made in the media from his house or from his studio? Is she like behind the scenes running the camera on that? Is she, can we go back and say like, oh, she's in the room for all this.

11:
What I can tell you is that when he filmed things at NFL Films, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, that big headquarters, like the only media company he's ever trusted. 'cause he is again a football guy in the utmost way. Yeah, in a real way. NFL films was his thing. The president of NFL films, by the way that dude started as, as a guy who was with the oh one Patriots, like doing the behind the scenes footage. So like he's had a deep trust there. What I can tell you is that when it came to when he was filming stuff, those shows inside the NFL, the underdog show, the McAfee stuff, the Peyton stuff, it was all out of this one set. And the people on those shows, dozens of people all say that she was around all of the time. So literally, I don't think she was behind the camera, but physically I think she might've been somewhere behind the camera.

11:
It was just all happening at the same time over last summer, that off season. And she was there always. So

3:
What we've seen since the, since the pod came out and since the CBS Sunday morning thing came out is kind of a, the, the UNC brass is kind of clearing things up or they're issuing public statements saying that she does not work for the program. She's Bill's personal social media person, personal PR person, doesn't have anything to do with UNC football. And then today Belichick said that he's excited to be back in meetings. He's probably the first person who's ever said that and that she has nothing to do with UNC football. And so is that something that's changed in the last week?

11:
Yes, yes. This is, this is my whole thing about the band. This is like, the weird nature of this story is that the CBS thing opened the flood gates as you guys detected. And what happened since is this power struggle behind the scenes from the very top of university, telling the football program in a meeting. She can't be around anymore. We don't want her around anymore. She won't be around anymore. And that message got out around the program and simultaneous to that has been the hiring of a PR guy who is very notably, very different from Jordan Hudson, guy who used to work for the Bears, actually. Guy who used to Yeah. Who's, who's like a legit, just like normal.

0:
He's a friend of mine. Yeah. Normal,

11:
Totally normal, like competent guy who's who I presume I haven't spoken to him. Brandon Faber, right? I I, yeah,

0:
He's he's very, very, like, he's very good at his job.

3:
Yeah.

11:
And I think one of the ways you can be good at your job is to just remember that like, oh wait a minute, bill Belichick loves football and the more he talks about football and the less that he has to talk about Jordan Hudson, the better. And so everybody behind the scenes has, and this is from his family to his inner circle, right? So Matt, Patricia, Josh McDaniels, Mike Lombardi, those guys who did nothing by the way, to stop Jordan Hudson from basically running the show behind the scenes, everybody is now finally like, oh my God, we have our opening to finally make sure that the thing that she was, which is CC'd on every single email at Carolina by ballot check's request. That's what the foyer records were by the New York Times and the Athletic, which they did scoop me on. And I, I, I am still irritated that I didn't get those emails, but that stuff, they're undoing that piece by piece and Belichick saying she's off to the side.

11:
That's a personal relationship, right? That is very different from the statement after the CBS thing, in which of course, Jordan and Bill released a statement saying, we have a personal and professional relationship. And the NB part has always been, wait a minute, does this mean Belichick productions or does this mean Carolina football? Because Carolina football is the place where everybody's terrified that this is undoing the whole, the whole notion of hiring Bill Belichick in the first place. So

0:
Yeah. So this is, this is at its core a very relatable story in that everyone knows a friend who maybe had a significant other who they didn't really approve of. But you can't be the guy who says, Hey, I don't like your girlfriend, I don't like your boyfriend. Because you know that that will just drive a wedge in your friendship with them. And now that all this has come out, they finally have their opening to be like, Hey, just like we've been thinking this for a while and now we can act on it.

11:
Yes. It's the equivalent of like one day, you know, the, the hopefully future ex-girlfriend of your best friend, she sends a text and you're like, I think we have our way in to start the conversation that all of us have been too afraid to talk about. Like, right. And instead of one text, it's been a series of public interviews and behind the scenes Right. Masters that have followed her. And again, I, the whole thing about why is she so bad, I wanna make clear, I don't think she's like a super villain. I don't think any of that. I just think she's a deeply ambitious young person that weirdly like the parallel, the most generous il I can give her is that it's as if your friend started dating like Mark Zuckerberg one day and and that guy just thought he knew how to do everything and the unintended consequences of what he was building ended up costing a lot of people their sanity.

11:
And I think that there is just a, there's an ambition here without a knowledge of how the industries she's trying to take over works. And that, that has been something that people have been repeatedly saying. It's

3:
Like Bill Belichick is, has become a vehicle for her ambitions for, for everything that she, she's just like channeling everything that she thinks she knows about the world through Bill who has a big presence already. And so now she's got a big platform with which to make these mistakes that maybe somebody just starting in the industry might make on a, on a, a low key basis. Yes. And she's the queen and she's and she's very driven Yeah. And successful and well read and people and, and in philosophy

0:
There's a lot of people out there who are business very intimidated by motivated women.

3:
And also the whole part about asking about her age, Pablo, I think that's a little uncooked.

0:
Yeah. That we'd said that. I don't know if you heard that part, but we were, that that actually is illegal. You never ask a woman's age so jail for you.

11:
I did feel checkmated. It was weird. It's weird for me to feel checkmated on wokeness by you guys, but I do feel on that,

3:
On that part. Well that's us. Yeah, that's us. I, I did have a question. I asked this on a, on the last podcast 'cause it just occurred to me with a timeline of everything, is there a chance that she had anything to do with Bill not getting any NFL jobs?

11:
Yeah, it's a really good question. And so the ti and this is good question. This is, this is, this is truly good question. The reason why, the reason why it's relevant to me is because I have been thinking about how to confirm just the timeline of when they started dating. And so, you know, when Big Cat is asking like, isn't this kind of like you have a friend who has this, this significant other that you don't like and are afraid to say. So the other parallel question I have from real life is like, when did Bill Belichick, DTR, like when did he, how do, how does one define the relationship with Bill Belichick? Because what I can tell you is that people started seeing Jordan Hudson in Bill Belichick's.

11:
So there are these outdoor seats he has not in a box, but in Gillette, like out in the end zone, I think it's section one 20, although not reporting that I'm just, that's what I have been told. It's section one 20 ish and in November, 2021, Jordan Hudson was sitting there. Hmm. And so again, but is that, is that, is that having dtr is that just like, oh, a guest, a friend, like Right. Are they friends with any degree of whatever? Like, I don't know, but I just know that it happened very soon after actually they met on that plane in February, 2021 in terms of her showing up around the Patriots actually. So this was definitely during his NFL tenure in a quite noticeable way.

3:
Did she design that stupid fucking lighthouse at Gillette? It wouldn't shock me if she, if she was behind. No.

0:
Whoa, whoa. I don't like your

3:
Tone. If she was behind that fake

0:
Lighthouse, if you No, but then it would be a work of art if

3:
She did. Well yeah. If you know the motivation behind it Yeah. Then you can truly understand the story behind the lighthouse. But as it stands, it's just a piece of kitch. Yeah. But if we knew that she was involved, then you truly under you, you, you greatest to Light House ever begin to see the depth of the artist's brain behind it. Yes. Yes, he

11:
Does. He does love a nautical theme, you know, interest not reporting that interesting. He does love fishermen and stuff, so I'm just saying.

3:
Yeah.

0:
What's up? PFT pointed this out the other day on our, our group text and I did see, I think the New York Post might have reported about it. What's up with the ring camera stuff? So there, there was the famous Bill Belichick leaving a house farting in a ring camera. And then there was an article I read yesterday that was like, the family is now worried that how did this get out? And who might've leaked this? Yeah,

11:
Yeah, yeah. So I I I think I might be the person who inspired the sort of like dominoes of aggregation that got to you guys on the family being worried about this video. So the video I think for most people got got to be a thing because of the Tom Brady roast. So the Netflix roast, Tom Brady makes a joke around how his favorite ring is actually the ring camera video Belichick like shirtless wandering around on a porch somewhere in presumably Massachusetts. The pieces then were reported I think by the Daily Mail or something. It's hard to keep track, but like it was identified as like, this is outside of Jordan Hudson's home. It's important to realize though, that the video first got released on the internet in 2023.

11:
Yep. So this was way before even I was really aware of the story or tracking it And

3:
We reported on it in 2023. Yeah, yeah. We, we broke that. Yeah. Well,

11:
Well then the question I have for you guys is, you know, logically speaking, how would one get that video

3:
Right? That, that's what I was thinking. I, I just, I was driving home from work, I texted the guys, I was like, do we think that, that she released that video? And if so, why would, what would her angle be? And the only angle I could think of and what we know about Jordan would be that maybe she was pressuring Bill to be public with the relationship.

11:
The worries that have been expressed on the Belichick family side, I think should be a little more specific here because just imagine, forget about the parallel. It's like you and your friend who's like roughly your age dating some woman who is just a nightmare in some ambiguous fashion. Think about if now it's your dad and he's almost 70 and he's hanging around with some people who love being online, who are in their mid, really early twenties. Right. And there's this video that shows up in which your dad is shirtless. Like the first question I have is not Wow. That's, that's how did that, I mean really it's not even, how did that get out there? It's what other videos are there.

11:
Right? Right. And who has access? And so the question is like, look, is that, I don't know. So one of the, one of the, I'll confess to you a bit about how my reporting process goes because I get this video, the ring camera video, and I'm like, I, I don't have a good way of like nailing down geographically like whose house this even is, even if it's been identified by various tabloids as Jordan Hudson's house. And I don't wanna take that for, for fact. So what I did before I logged on here is I emailed the manager of that guy a Rainbolt who's the Yeah. The geo guest guy.

0:
Yeah. He's incredible.

11:
And so I'm hoping if Rainbolt listens to this, please respond to your manager's email. I kind of need you Yes. To solve a mystery like where was this camera who had access to it? And again, the nightmare for me purely hypothetically is she's got some friends, again, like if your friend was dating Bill Belichick and you didn't know how serious it was, do you think you would maybe get some images or video sent to you privately of Bill Belichick? That will be the question that I think any decent son, daughter, ne nephew niece would ask about their 70-year-old relative. Yeah.

3:
And again, it, it does feel like a lot for somebody that's Jordan's age to deal with all this stuff. So it, it's, I'm not saying it's definitely her that release it. She could have like sent that to her friend.

11:
She's like, totally no idea.

3:
I'm dating Bill. And they're like, no, you're not. And they're like, yeah, this is him leaving the house the other day. And then that's how it gets out. That's a possibility. I just don't think that, I don't like the idea of Bill Belichick around secret cameras. That's not the Belichick way. No, that's not the same guy.

11:
Definitely not. Yeah.

0:
Listen And we should say all the stuff that Jordan has on her plate right now, it's actually impressive. Like, I don't know how she does it, but she does. Yeah,

3:
She does. And and she stays looking good too while she does it. Yeah.

0:
Yeah. How, how does this end, Pablo

11:
June 1st is the date that I think is the first sort of crossroads, right? And so Belichick as we speak here, having just said off to the side personal relationship, she's not in any way associated with UNC football. Defacto is sort of confirming that the side of the power struggle that has said we need her to be in the background for PR reasons. If nothing else, that side seems to be winning. And so the June 1st date, which was always about this, by the way, it was weird before all of this, right? The buyout clause going from $10 million to 10 times less than that. Like why, why, why would that be? Well presumably it was because Bill wanted an out clause for the NFL. Now it seems like that is an out clause in case he wasn't really in charge in the way that he demanded to be in charge.

11:
And so him publicly going along with this now and saying, listening to everybody in his life seemingly, but Jordan Hudson and saying, okay, she's not involved, that means that June 1st, if we're reading the tea leaves here is less of a red button being pressed. Sort of like this is all gonna fall apart immediately, but looking ahead to the summer, right? Like, you guys know how college football works, they're getting out, they're getting outta town, right? It's the summer. Like no one's really around the building like recruiting sure is still going on. But the whole question is while everybody is off minding their own devices, literal and figurative, in the case of Jordan Hudson and our theories, is anything else gonna happen that would demand some other bit of public crisis management?

11:
And if the answer is no, I think that week one, him being the coach there totally makes sense. But just historically speaking in a very short amount of time, really this statement from Belichick at the ACC meetings in which he said off to the side personal, not involved with UNC in any way, is the first time he's really said that. And so if that is the mode, I think this is a lot calmer, but it's also the first time we've heard it and I've seen a lot of the pendulum swinging towards a lot of people being panicked behind the scenes.

3:
It's gonna be crazy once they get to the a CCC coaches day where the, the media gets to ask questions of everybody like Bill Belichick sitting in front of a group of reporters, it's gonna be huge and they're gonna be asking a lot of questions about her. He's not gonna, like, he might, if I was Belichick, you know what I'd do? I just opened the book on Deflategate. At that point I'd just be like, I'm only here to talk about Deflategate,

0:
Throw some red meat the other direction. Right.

11:
The ideal gas lot. Does wanna talk about the ideal.

0:
Yeah,

3:
Let's revisit all the stuff Yeah. I never wanted to talk to you about Yeah. Or you can just ask about long snappers and we'll talk for like five minutes about that too. So yeah, I mean this is a crazy story. Thank you for, for your journalist journalism on it journalism's. Yep. What

0:
Would you, what'd you say Hank journalism? ISTs Yeah, journalism ISTs.

3:
Yeah. We appreciate, we appreciate the service that you did there. Do

0:
You have any questions for Bobo? Hank? No, he doesn't wanna be. No, you guys, you guys have done a good job. Oh, okay. Hank's team Jordan too. Does

11:
Max have a question? Yeah, I, I just, max

0:
You had a question for, for Pablo.

11:
I think you're doing a flawless job.

3:
Flawless flaw job. Flawless. That's, that's pretty impress,

0:
But Max you remain Team Jordan. Yep. Okay. Yes. String team. Short on team.

Rhoback:
Alright, well I have one last question for you Pablo. It's a Rollback question. R-H-O-B-A-C k.com promo code. Take 20% off your first purchase, QIPs polos hoodies, joggers shorts, Rollback dot com, promo code, take in your reporting.

0:
And again everyone go, go watch and listen to the the episode. It was released on Friday. Pablo finds out what Pablo Tori finds out is the official name of the podcast. Has there ever been someone from Jordan's camp that has reached out to you? Has there ever has, has anyone said, Hey, what are you doing?

11:
I have requested comment from North Carolina, no response. I've requested, I mean 40 different foia, which got annoying, so I apologize. I acted Carolina on that. It got to be just a bit. They replied to none of them. I emailed Jordan Hudson at an address, her email that I got that I know is hers. No response. The Belichick camp obviously him personally. No response if this is our long way of saying, you know, Jordan Hudson, I am looking to maybe have you, maybe we could do a joint interview with her. Mm. Maybe.

0:
Yeah. We we'll take her side. We'll

3:
Be behind the scenes sitting in chairs being like, don't answer that question.

0:
She's actually our boss now. I you probably heard that part. Yeah. She's our boss.

11:
Wait, wait, wait. The

3:
Interview in

11:
Which we recreate the CVS Sunday morning interview. But you guys are Jordan and she has built we're her

3:
Yes, I am. Yes. That's how much we care about her.

11:
Yeah. I

0:
Mean she is our boss though for pardon my cheese stick.

3:
We're deeply ambitious people, Pablo and she is the perfect vehicle for us to cha channel all this energy that we have into. Yeah. So yeah, we we're happy to do that. Oh

11:
My god, if she does, I promise to tell the geo guesser rainbolt guy to stop looking for that house.

3:
Oh, okay. I mean that's credit to you. That's a, that's an ingenious way of trying to figure out exactly where that house is located. That guy's an expert, that guy could testify. And we,

11:
By the way, so we think that guy is just like on the up and up. Right. Because I've also been like, I don't know how this works. I just have no evidence that this is

0:
No, he's really good.

3:
It would ruin me if he wasn't. Yeah. Yeah.

0:
I I I he's really, really good at it. So I think,

11:
I

0:
Think I got this and there are people I've seen, we have some people in this office who are very good accomplished geo guessers. So I know that like, it is a skill that you can hone and like, whether it be architecture, trees, the sun, all this stuff.

3:
Yeah. Types of grass. Yeah. You can study cement Yeah. And figure it out that way. Yeah. Yeah. It's signs.

11:
It's the indoor stuff. Sometimes he's at, he's at like a mall and he's like, oh, this mall is in Nairobi. And I'm like, yeah. How, how does, how does

3:
Photographic memory, I, I do have one more question for you. I had one, one issue with the reporting. You spoke with somebody that said that Jordan is, what was the exact term that you, that you used? The worst person I've ever met and I've worked with sociopaths.

0:
Yeah. I wanna fight

3:
That person. Something along those lines. Has this person ever met Josh McDaniels? Mm,

0:
Good question. I

3:
It might be Josh McDaniels actually. Yeah, that's true. He would be the only person in that circle that could say that

0:
He doesn't have any mirrors in his house.

3:
Yeah.

11:
I, I guess for journal, for journalism, mystic reasons I cannot actually answer that question.

3:
Okay.

0:
That's my whole, my goal for how this ends is we get Jordan on and you just like, pull your hair out listening to us be like, yes, queen. Yeah.

3:
We

0:
Just ask, we don't ask her any questions.

3:
All softballs. How do, how do you do it Jordan? You

0:
Guys do this? Yeah. How, how are you, how do you work so hard and look so glamorous? First question.

3:
Yeah.

11:
My response, my response to that would be to immediately go and buy a bottle of Plava Molly tweet bottle.

0:
Wait, wait, Rita, set review again. The two strawberry.

11:
Yeah, I mean, look so lovely. So perfect. So summary. So red, so strawberry, so refreshing. So lightly acidic. So watermelon, so strawberry. So lovely. So enjoy it. Five stars.

3:
So enjoy

0:
It when we get back to, to the strawberry. That's what I really want it. I

3:
Got, I got one more question for you. Just something you know outta curiosity. I don't know if you came across any of this while you were interviewing people. Do you any details about their love life?

11:
Oh man, look, I don't have journalistic speaking, I don't have those specific details. What I can tell you though is that when it comes to how Jordan Hudson's sort of, and again, not yucking, any yus, like her point of view on, on, on the spectrum of human love, I think is probably maybe helpfully expressed by a certain museum and shop that her mom, Lee Hudson operates as the business manager in Provincetown, Massachusetts. And I don't really know how it is that this keeps happening, but this is an episode that also contains a detail around a 20, no, just wanna get the math right.

11:
A 28,000 year old dildo in that museum. And I keep on having to be the guy to say I don't have the answers to that, but I can point you in a direction where it would suggest that there's a great spectrum of possibility in terms of the answer.

3:
Yeah. Bill is a, he's a student of history. Yeah. Loves history. He does,

0:
He does. Pablo, by the way, if you, if you're next investigation is going to be how the NBA rigged the lottery for the Mavs, we are happy to talk on record. We realized afterwards we were invited, we got credentials. They showed us the room, they gave us a free buffet, and then we walked out And we realized that they just used us, which we, if you give us credentials in free food, we'll, we'll, we'll we'll carry water for anyone. So we were used last night as ponds and we're dumb. We're very

11:
Dumb. I what I would ask you guys is the next time you are accidentally invited backstage into what might be a journalistically explosive room, just text me and I'll be like, Hey, maybe you guys should stay. Yeah, yeah.

3:
Be

11:
Questions, be your ombudsman maybe. Yeah. If you wanted, because now I, I'm mad that we don't actually have the answer to that question.

0:
Well, the problem was PFT and I started pulling out cash and they're like, all right, tour's over. Yeah. So they looked,

3:
They looked the outdoor cat inside and they quickly, quickly realized we still got our claws, this, and they're, And we gotta get this guy outta the room. Ernst and young guy is over here looking over their shoulders.

0:
Yeah. If there's an inappropriate joke to be made, we're gonna make it. And then have, you know, quietly be told that, Hey, this is time to go to the buffet guys.

3:
We will be witnesses though. Yeah. I mean we, we were there. We, I we saw it in person. I'm sorry I saw it in person. You can't, this is rigged for money. Yeah,

0:
Yeah.

3:
It just is. Yeah. I

11:
Once talked to David Falk, Michael Jordan's of course, former super agent about, 'cause he was also Ewing's agent, and I asked him about the whole like frozen envelope theory and the Michael Jordan retirement because of gambling stuff. And what David f told me was, number one, the Jordan stuff is total bullshit. That doesn't make any sense. But number two, the frozen envelope thing, he was like, yeah, that makes sense.

3:
Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does. And what happened last night makes a lot of sense. Makes a

0:
Lot of sense.

3:
It really does. But it's still fucking bullshit. And we'll look into it too. Yeah. We'll, we'll let you know what we find out because I would, I would trust your reporting on this. Yeah. I

11:
Think we should collaborate on an investigation.

3:
Yeah. Okay.

0:
Chief SHOs in jail. So that one's kind

3:
Of Yeah, we, yeah.

11:
I had to cross

3:
Be working on, we have, we got, I'm sure that there's some, there's some theories that we've been working on behind the scenes. Well, we could do,

11:
We could do, I mean look far beyond from me to overstep my bounds as a first time guest, but long time a WL if I may call myself that, which is Yes, absolutely a unilateral decision. I'm just saying I've always been interested in the lost footage around Barstool van talk and I may or may not know a guy who may or may not have been involved in that backstage decision and I may or may not be somebody who actually wants to see that happen. Episode

3:
Two,

11:
Just saying that episode two is another bit of a piece of footage that maybe there's something there.

3:
Yeah, yeah. We'll see. I mean, it might have just been a long, a long joke on us by, by John Skipper. It didn't act like it had just been like John

11:
Skipper didn't turn the camera on for that one. It

0:
Was, yeah, it was the predecessor to, for Nathan, for you

3:
It was Jackass John Skipper's like, all right, these guys totally think they're making a show. We're gonna cancel after one week.

0:
I'm waiting for the, the John Skipper Nathan for you episode to come out for Al Van talk. These guys thought they had a show. That'd be great. Alright, well Pablo, thank you so much. We appreciate it. And now that you've been a recurring guest, you gotta come back on whenever we ask, so Yep, we will. It will happen soon. I,

11:
I hesitate to imagine what my life is gonna be like in general going forward. So anytime. Yeah,

0:
Appreciate

3:
It. I also wonder if Jordan, Michael Jordan has met Jordan. Oh, oh boy. Jordan. Jordan, UNC connection. Yeah, Jordan. Jordan the most ambitious cross over of all time.

11:
Brian Jordan is a meme that available for someone to

0:
Call. Not for our queen. No, no, no way.

3:
Not for us. No.

0:
Alright, thanks Pablo. Thank you guys.

HEYDUDE:
Pablo Torre is brought to you by Hey dude, have, Hey dude, have you tried the new hey dude shoes, yet they're unlike anything. The Wally stretch socks are the ultimate slip-on shoe. They're lightweight, breathable, and ridiculously comfortable. We're talking cushioned insoles that feel like little pillows under your feet on Saturday. I think I put my hey dudes on first thing in the morning, took Blake outside for a walk, didn't take 'em off the entire day, went out, had a beer at a bar, came back home, cooked dinner on the grill outside. All these things with hey dudes, they're the most comfortable shoes that you can wear. Great for wearing around the house. And also they look great when you're wearing them out. You can find your pair@heydude.com Hey dude.com. Okay, let's wrap up. We got Guys On Chicks. Hank.

0:
Yeah Guys On Chicks.

5:
So I heard about you guys doing CRO talks, which is Botox free balls. What's your take on this, Hank? I heard about guys, come on. Can I give you, I I heard about guys, not you guys. Can I give you a little bit of something? Can I give you a note and would you do this to keep things nice and tight? My husband claims he has no idea what that is, but I'm not sure if he's lying or not to say face

3:
Hank. So in the interest of our listeners out there, because first and foremost we care about the listeners. Can we, can we try that with a little more energy?

0:
Just be Hank we've already hashed it all out. Yeah, we're all good at the end of the show. We're good. We

5:
Moved on. So I heard about guys doing Scro talks, which is Botox for your balls. What's your take on this and would you do this to keep things nice and tight?

3:
I, I personally don't care what my scrotum looks like.

0:
I don't either. I do, do girls care what scrotums look like? I feel like girls know that balls are weird. Yeah. Like balls are just weird. The

3:
The, the male body is weird here breaking news like

5:
Guys wanna see girls' boobs. I don't think girls wanna see guys balls. Yeah.

0:
They're like, oh shit, what a pair of balls you got on you.

3:
Yeah. The the female body is beautiful. It's curvy, it's artistic, it's smooth, it's, it's wonderful to look at The male body is just absolutely disgusting.

5:
They don't wanna see B

3:
No,

0:
No. They do not want to see, they

5:
Don't wanna see plain B.

0:
No. A little bit of D not a lot of B, probably not any of the a

3:
I just think that women would probably be cool with it if our balls were inside our bodies. If we just had internal balls, they'd be fine with that. They wouldn't like miss them. Yeah.

6:
Balls aren't meant to show other guys, right? Yeah. That's it's way, it's way cooler to show your boys your balls than anything else.

0:
Absolutely. And, and so under this like do not get cro talk because if you got scro talk and showed your boys your scrotox balls, everyone would be like, dude, what the fuck are those

3:
Balls are for humor.

0:
Which one, which, which, which ball hangs lower for you guys?

3:
My left, left, left.

6:
My left as well.

0:
All left. Is it always left? I think. Oh,

6:
I didn't know that. I think everyone's left ball is bigger than their Right.

0:
Is that

3:
True? I don't know my left. My left definitely does.

0:
Yeah. Minus is left. Left. That's crazy. I thought, I thought it was like kind of a, you know, everyone's different left to right.

3:
I think maybe if you're, if you're left-handed, does your right ball hang lower? Maybe.

0:
And most individuals the right testicle is slightly larger than the left. What? So we're abnormal.

3:
Well no I don't think that matters about hanging lower. Yeah, true. I don't think it's just

0:
Grabbing. Well I would think that it's heavier. Wait, are we all wrong?

3:
You're looking up testicle. Testicle being bigger.

0:
Yeah, we're hang, we're talking about hanging.

7:
I will say this Scro Tex looks kinda lit.

0:
You're looking at scro tex balls right now means

7:
No, no. The definition. Oh. Lead to smoother, potentially larger appearing and reduces sweat.

3:
Reducing sweat is a good cell.

0:
Yeah, that's good. Can I get Scro tex for like my grundle? That's where the sweat is the problem. Alright, so the left tings lower for most people. Is there anyone out there who has, right. That's kind of weird. I don't know. That's like a unicorn. The

3:
Reason, the reason difference

0:
Vari max right now, by the way, max is literally checking. I watched that move. He's checking his balls.

3:
The difference is the reason in the spermatic cord for most guys.

0:
I didn't know we had a spermatic cord.

3:
Yeah. Is that just like the, the thing that it hangs on the rope?

0:
Yeah. I don't understand any of that. Yeah, so don't I I never understood. I always was very confused. Even still am as a 40-year-old man. Like how do you, how do you pee and piss outta the same hole? I, how do you, how do you come and piss outta the same hole?

3:
I, I do find it amazing their valve though. That guys are just like, you know what's really gonna, those two holes, you know what could impress chicks as if my balls were were less wrinkly. Like that's not, it's not gonna work.

5:
There's a little, there's a little there. What? There's a little island. There's two holes. Little bridge in the middle. There's not

0:
Two holes,

3:
There's one hole. Hank

0:
Do you have two holes? Do you think there are two holes? Sorry to, that was a joke but he just, I, I don't know if that was a joke. As soon as Hank said two holes. Yeah, I stopped listening.

5:
Answer for were saying I stopped the, that's the answer for girls.

3:
That is true. The

0:
Girls do have two holes, but

3:
It's part of the one larger apparatus guys.

0:
It's guys, do you have two holes? Do

5:
You have two holes? I, I'll double check but I'm pretty positive I got one hole.

0:
Okay. It sounds like you're two hole guy.

3:
You have an in hole. In an out hole.

5:
I got two side holes.

0:
Yeah, it sounds like you got holes like a

3:
Super, like a, I got a

5:
Cover one up

0:
Like a Trump, a trumpet. I think that's the Lil Dickie thing. Oh yeah. From the show. Yeah.

5:
Hey Kenny Stone Boys. Come on.

0:
Come on.

5:
Not worried about the Celtics. Hank Double vacation Max. I'm having an issue with fellow with the A WL who keeps ghosting me. I met this guy on Hinge a couple years ago. We went out on one date. I thought it went well And we had bonded over our love for PMT, but I didn't hear from him again after that last summer. He liked me again on Hinge, but I didn't really take the bait. Then last week he liked me again, but this time his opener was joking about Max at the White House. So I couldn't resist. After a couple days of messaging and seemingly hit it off, he's gone Ghost again. What's this guy's deal,

0:
Dude, get it together. What is he doing? Yeah,

3:
I don't know, are they? Ghosting has like a, a pretty wide definition these days. I feel like back in the day before hinge, like people just kind of stopped talking. Sometimes it was no big deal. But you have like one conversation with somebody and then you stop. Then it's like a big thing like, oh, I got ghosted. You have to establish I think a pattern of actually talking before you can actually be ghosted. Right?

0:
Yeah. But it sounds like they're talking

5:
Not anymore, but

0:
They were, and then he just went and he's done this a couple times. I think he's just a serial ghoster. Get it together. Dude. You're putting a bad name on Awls. Like, we'll go to this wedding.

3:
I'm gonna pass. No, no.

0:
I shaking my head. Max. Max will go to this wedding.

6:
I'm happy that I was involved in a pickup line. That's pretty, that's pretty cool.

0:
That is pretty

3:
Cool. I mean, here's what you do. Just send him the clip of this conversation right now. Yeah. And be like, Hey, you just respond to her

0:
Shit. Or get off the pot And we will send, I'll, I'll say it this way. We will send a representative of, Pardon My Take to the wedding.

3:
Hey dude. She wants to bang. Yeah. She can't be any, she wants to bang so bad that she, she wrote into a podcast to ask for advice on how to get to bang you.

0:
What do you think the face on these two lovebirds who are gonna end up getting married and having a beautiful life together, what do you think their face is gonna say when Shane walks into their wedding, if we give him a PMT pin? Mm. Well, we sent our representative. What are you gonna do? He's

3:
Got a GoPro on, like, he's live streaming like a surrogate.

0:
Oh. We couldn't send Shane 'cause he would totally dick down the bride.

3:
Same with pug. Yeah.

0:
Maybe wiper can go. Okay.

5:
My husband, 27 and I 28 have been together for seven years and have lived together for six of them. We have two kids. He works full time and I stay home with the kids for as long as we've lived together. He is only ever done his laundry sporadically and other times I'm the one doing it. My question is, do all guys wait so long to do their laundry that they end up having to wear shorts as underwear or no underwear at all? Because they've simply worn all their underwear but won't do their laundry. Yes. Yeah.

3:
Yes. That's a fact.

0:
And jeans, sweatshirts, those can be re worn. Yeah.

3:
Yeah. Now if you're putting on jeans without underwear, then now we're talking emergency. Yeah. That shouldn't happen at that age.

5:
I've discovered that my, my building has a laundry room and it's, it's changed my life because I can just do like five loads of laundry at once. That's

3:
A massive, massive wind. How long did it take you?

5:
What do

3:
You mean? To find out that your building had a laundry?

0:
Wait, you have in, you have in unit

5:
Though. Yeah, but my dryer sucks. It takes twice as long to dry than to wash. Have you? You can't really get in a cleaned it

0:
Out.

5:
No, it's just like the time thing. Like it.

0:
Are you sure you've cleaned it out?

5:
It has nothing to do with cleanliness of dryer. It's just like

3:
The lint trap.

0:
Have you cleaned out the

3:
Lin trap? Yeah, it's the lint trap. You don't know about the lint trap? Oh no.

5:
We did, we've done this before.

0:
Have you taken out the lin trap? Yes. Okay.

5:
That's not the issue. It's

3:
Not, it is there another filter? It's

5:
When you click normal start, it says like hour, like whatever, hour 20. And the regular laundry washer takes 45 minutes. That's, you can't really get in

0:
A cycle. Yeah. That's every,

5:
It's usually like 45 and 60,

0:
Whatever, but that is every, every dryer. It does take longer to dry than to wash.

5:
This is too, too long. What? It doesn't matter. I've solved the issue. Shut

3:
Up. I, I, I recently, I recently made the, maybe the bou geest move that I've made got a, a brand new drying and washing appliance. You

5:
Can't even keep your clothes, dude.

0:
Yes, that's

3:
True. That's valid. I'm on a hot streak though. I re-upped on, on the wardrobe. I got a steam closet, which is like a little, it looks like a, a portable closet that you have in your house. And you, if you have something that you like to wear again and it doesn't need a full wash, like a sweater or like sweatpants or jeans. You just hang it up in this thing for like 20 minutes and you hit a button and it steam cleans it and you don't even have to like wash it or dry it. It's actually great. That's awesome. It's a great thing. Hank,

0:
Anything to say today about my blue shirt? Not black. Yeah, it looks good. Yeah. Looks like I'm doing different fashion.

5:
Yeah, you're matching that

3:
Right in your face. What does that look for, Hank?

5:
I just don't like you.

3:
I'm, you know what, Hank I feel bad for you.

5:
No, you're just not, you know, we get it. You're rich like no one. No, no. Aw L is like, oh yeah. Classic steam

3:
Closet. I, I feel, I feel bad for you Hank.

0:
They're gonna come at you like they came at me for saying that. I wasn't surprised. Tickets were expensive in New York City. Yeah.

3:
Yeah. I mean, they're very upset. Listen, I said I, it's the bougie AST purchase that I think I've ever made

0:
By the way. I I do, I do think that there should be affordable tickets. I just don't know the, how you can do that in the playoffs. 'cause tickets always get crazy. Poor section.

3:
Poor section. Yeah.

0:
Yeah. Poor section and New York City is always, I I was thinking about it more. I think, I think people like to just judge New York City and be like, oh, there's no real fans there because the tickets are always so crazy. You know, where it's like, holy shit to get in price is a thousand dollars here and they're like, there's no real fans. There's a lot of rich people in New York City.

3:
Yeah, that is true. That's a

0:
Fact. Yeah. Like the most in the country by far.

3:
They should definitely have a call it the, the party section.

0:
No, it should be, no, there should be a like, it should be like college basketball. There should be like a student section. Yeah. For NBA games where there's they're cheaper tickets, affordable tickets. I'm all in for that. Yep. I just don't know how to fix the other thing.

3:
Hank, you had more Guys On Chicks

5:
I's just do numbers. Let's, let's,

3:
I I wanna do one more Hank. One more. One more. Come on Hank.

0:
Come on

3:
One

More time. It's just the guys hanging out together.

Hey Hank. So sorry about being down three one to Mr. Bing bong. Anyways. My husband recently tore his ACL and has decided to pick up golf for the first time in his life. I supported this decision until it became his whole personality. He golfs every Saturday now for hours and spends weeknights at the range or watching helpful tips on YouTube. I feel like he's doing this as a way to not spend time with me. He claims it's a way for him to enjoy sport without too much intensity on his knee. What do I do?

0:
Yeah. This guy fucked up. It's hard to pick up the golf after. Yeah. You gotta be the golfer when you meet your wife.

3:
Anything that you want to do that you think you might want to try to do for the rest of your life, you should start before you get married. Yeah.

5:
He, I feel like he's doing this as a way to not spend time with me. You're dramatic.

0:
Yeah. No, he just loves golf. He, he like, if you wanna put it a different way, like I don't think he's deliberately saying, I don't wanna spend time with my wife. I think what he, he's saying, and it's probably the truth. He loves golf more than you. No. He just loves golf. No, I mean he loves golf more than, more than her.

I don't even think it matters. It's like, it's just fun to get out there. They just really need to figure out, I wish golf courses were 12 vols. That's what they need to figure out because I wish there were 24. Okay. If the, if it would be off. If a golf round was like a guaranteed two hours. Yeah, it'd be great.

3:
Yeah. It's, it is too long. It is because what, between driving out there, getting your practice swings in, playing golf, driving home, it's like eight hours. Yeah. You're looking at like a full day. So Hank

0:
Sees no

3:
Problem. She might be like, yeah, he's just trying to get outta the house away from me for a full day. Right. What if you just learned how to play golf? Yeah, like that. And then, and then you guys could watch YouTube clips together.
