Yeah. Looking good. Well, no, One of 'em is not paying child support. Huey definitely looks like a, a college kid going to court for the first time. Yeah. Like you got a, you got a drunken public ticket showing up. Yeah. Open retainer. I'm gonna put on a, a collared shirt, but I'm gonna keep the undershirt on. Probably not fully tucked in. Yeah. But it's a Good look. And the judge is gonna give him a lenient sentence. 'cause he is just gonna look at him and be like, man, this kid doesn't have a lot going on for him. Well, he is gonna look at him and be like, your father owns a business. You seem like a good kid. Let's learn from this. Yeah. Max. Max might might be the one missing out on child support. I can't see memes. No. Max looks like Huey's lawyer. Yeah. Stand up. Memes. Memes. Kinda looks like an accountant. Yeah. Me actually. Looks me. Oh, memes looks pretty appropriate.


Memes. Memes. Looks like a pedophile now that I'm thinking about it. 'cause he didn't have his glasses on. He looks like he's going. Yeah, he, to catch a predator. I Was gonna say, he looks like an Amish kid that went on Rum Springer and had too much fun. Learning how to do like a, like basic Excel operations. Yeah. So he's a former Amish kid that now loves computers and works at a tech firm. Us in here, we look good. Hank, you look like a, a playboy. Yeah. Yeah. You look awesome. Yeah. Whenever you break out the round sunglasses, you know, Hank is either ready to do the take he or took way too many drugs. He, he looks like Fact or fiction. Fiction.


You look like the Beatles drug dealer. Circle glasses play. I, I know squares are too, too big for mine. My little face. Yes. It's kinda like an evil scientist type look too. Yeah. Like you're cooking something weird out. Yeah. Yeah. Look like a tech. Like a tech. I'm in tech, but I'm really just like selling drugs. Yeah. You look, You look like a futurist. Yeah. You look like the guy that sits Elon down. He comes in like the banana boat. He brings in a suitcase of ketamine and then tells him what the future's gonna be with robots. Yes. I like that. Okay. That's a good, that's a good job. That's a good life. We also should have said at the start that in the past we've done cameos this year we wanted to bring it back home. So we have not all the Time either. It's, yeah. We Haven't done it every year.


We did it the last couple of years, but this time we figured let's have our friends of the program, our good friends, recurring guests, present a couple of the awards. So we have some Guest Presenters that will be great for the listeners. See some familiar faces, some friends, and Yeah. Should we, should we do it 28 awards to give out? Let's Kick into it. Okay. So we're gonna start with the take of the year. We're starting off with the bang. Whoa. Yeah, we're starting off with a bang. Set the stage. You would think the takey take of the year would be the finale, but No, no, That's actually the preemptive take. I know as towards the end take of the year. We have a lot, we have a lot to get through. I wanna laugh about a lot of these.


Shout out. Our good friend old takes exposed. He helps us with this every single year. Let's just dive into it. I want to hear what you guys have to think about a lot of these. Okay. A lot of these are takes that were said maybe a couple years ago, but they came true this year. So that's when they, you know, a good take usually takes a a couple years to fully grow and become a beautiful tree, and then we can harvest from It. Yeah. You gotta give it some time until it becomes flaming hot. Yes. So it really reaches the truth. Yeah. So some of the ones that have come true this year that I loved this one is from Neil Iyer on Espb Nation. This was from February 11th, 2022.


The Derek White trade is a disaster. Sorry folks. Brad Stevens made his first major mistake as gm. Oh, that's a good take. That's a good take. That's A good take. Disaster. Disaster. And was the, was the trade a disaster? Because Kyrie Irving was on the team? I I, I don't know what exactly the trade, why it was a disaster. But Derrick White was the ultimate glue guy for the Celtics Championship run. Was it not? And the first year too. The first year was on the team. Yeah. First two years. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it was just, he was saying like, Kyrie Irving will never win a championship for the Celtics with this Derek White trade. Think it was, which might have been true. Think it Was after Kyrie 'cause 2022 Kyrie was already on the Nets. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah. True. But A disaster nonetheless. You know That experiment.


Yeah. Here's one, this will be a theme. Colin Coward is, is featured many times in this one. This is from 2020. This one was beautiful to, to watch Sprout this year. Name the top 100 players ever. Hard to find many that didn't love the game. Passion matters to me. But hey, Anthony Edwards has great measurables. I don't think you could think of one person that like, loves the game more than Anthony Edwards does right now. I I love those takes. Especially during NFL draft season. Yeah. Where they're like, I, he's a great player, but is he really in love with football? Yeah. Would he marry a football? Yeah. Yeah. Anthony Edwards, I would say he, he loves Basketball. He had a, he had a very good year and he, he, he clearly cares a lot.


And sometimes you don't have to care about, you don't have to love the sport If. you just love winning so much that you just don't wanna lose in anything you do. Yes. Yes. Exactly. Here's a good one from Pierce w Huff, this is a call that should happen. Hey, Monty Williams. This is Brad Stevens with the Celtics. I'm about to fire Joe Missoula. Would you be interested in coaching our team? That's a great call. It would be. It would. That was Coward too. No, that was Pierce w Huff. It would Be a very funny phone call. Yeah, It would be. Yeah. Monty Williams. Although he, he's pretty good at getting paid. He might be just a good coach at getting paid. That's True. Yeah. I think it worked out well. Yeah, it worked out great. I want, I wanna do a little game called Who said this quote?


You ready for this one? I'm not leaving until I get a Super Bowl. This is about a player that was drafted to a team. Stefan Diggs. Nope. Out drafted. Mm. Drafted to a team. Drafted to, I'm not leaving until I get a Super Bowl. Get a Super Bowl. I'll say this right now. I I could give you a thousand guesses. I don't think you'd get it. Zach Wilson. No. M Jones. No. Again, a thousand guesses. I don't think you'd get it. That Ray Lance. No. That was said by Sean Watson. Desmond Ritter, after getting drafted by the Falcons, Desmond Ritter is now on the Arizona Cardinals. Oh, that's good to know. I didn't know that. Okay. Yes. That's good. So he did in fact leave before getting a Super Bowl for the Falcons In Atlanta.


Yeah. You should just never say that as a falcon. Yeah. These are, these are all very fun. The, we, we addressed this one actually in February, but it's still one that needs to be revisited because in 2019, the athletic wrote a piece and said, in case you missed it, Patrick Mahomes has thrown 36% of Troy Aikman's career touchdowns in about 8% of the games. And Troy Aikman quote, tweet that in 2019 and said, in case you missed it, talk to me when he has 33% of my Super Bowl titles, he now has a hundred percent of his Super Bowl titles. That was tough now, But Troy, Troy walked that back later. He was like, okay. He did it. He did it. Yeah, he did it. He did it.


This one is from Nick Wright. This, this May, he said, by the time the Celtics adjust to playing real playoff basketball, the Mavs are gonna be up three. One Hank like that one. Yeah. Yeah. That's A strong one. That's a strong, it was Nick, one of the ones leading the charge at the Lakers were actually the the best team in the west. Yeah. He was one of them. Yes. And then he pivoted to the Mav. We get any Kevin O'Connor Celtics Takes. I, I don't think I have any of those. He, he had a lot of, he had some dudes. He did say the war. Yeah. The, the Ugg. Every team that the Celtics were playing was gonna beat them. Yeah. Basically picked Every team to win the championship except the Celtics. He said the nuggets there. There's no chance the Celtics could beat the nuggets in a seven game series. A twofer for Cal Cal said in February we're built for March.


Not April. Not April. They're built for March. Forgot about goalie. Yeah. And then also the ad at, at Kentucky, Mitch Barnhart said, as we normally do at the end of every season, coach Cal and I have had a conversation about the direction of our men's basketball pro program. And I can confirm that he will return for his 16th season as our head coach. Then something weird happened and Some then the chicken, the chicken man And the chicken man gave him a call. Yeah. These are, these are all just fantastic. Again, shout out our guy Old takes exposed. We'll rip through a few more and then we'll, we'll give you a winner. Mason Dodd said, hate to be the only grownup in the room. I like this one just because he's, he's admitting he's the only grownup in the room. Yeah. Never a good idea. Yeah. Hate to be the memes.


Would love that Mason, how he looks. Yeah. Hate to be the only grownup in the room. But Puka Nku has no upside. Fifth round, rookie wide Receiver on bottom. Five teams don't move the needle. I I love the guy having a strong take about a fifth round Receiver too. Like hate this pick. Yeah. I don't think this guy's gonna be a superstar. You're going out on a limb and then when it gets cut out from under, you look like a dumb ass. Not Only that, but just to be the hate, to be the grownup in the room. Like that really sets you up. Yeah. We had You Never wanna be the grownup in The room. No, you never want, nobody Likes the grownup in the room. This one you will, like Hank Dan Orlovsky said in 2021, he believes Belichick will win another Super Bowl with Mac Jones at qb.


And he said Mac Jones is the best rookie QB that I have ever seen since doing this job when it comes to knowing where to go with the football, when to go with the football, and how to throw that football. Ever seen, ever, ever seen, ever seen? Wait, What are the criteria that he has knowing where to go with the football, Where to go with the football, five yards. When to go with football. Yeah. Nope. When to go football. How to throw the Football, how to throw. But he short, but he doesn't specify actually throwing the football. No, that's the big one. Yeah. So Daniel Loki might not be wrong about those three things With when, how Now there is a possibility that, that Belichick will win a Super Bowl at some point with Mac Jones. That's True. Can't close that door. Yep.


Similar to the cow one. Terry on Arnold, Alabama Cornerback said, coach Shaban ain't going nowhere. He's gonna die coaching. That one was, that one was nice. RIP That one was very nice. Yeah. Max, you'll like these. Next two. Congratulations to the 2023 NFC East's Champion Philadelphia Eagles. That was from November 5th, 2023. And also Colin Coward said, he said, let me pull this up. National League just surrender to the Phillies. Nothing to be ashamed of. That was in 2023 fall. Oh, that was fun. Before Max in October. How did those go? Not well.


Personal favorite of mine. Chad Johnson said in September, 2023. All you fucking doubt or all you fuckers doubting Zach Wilson. Don't jump on our bandwagon later. I didn't. And I won't. I won't. I'm not going To. I never did. Not going to Not gonna jump on any bandwagons. There might have been one from the Bears from training campus said Sundays are gonna be fun. And then my last nominee is from Cade McNamara on playing QB for Iowa. Please just keep on saying it's the shittiest offense in college football. Please just think we are gonna be so shitty next year. Please. It's a lot of pleases. Yeah. And they're, I mean, they had a great punting system this year. Yeah. Great. Punting system. Great. Return game. Yeah. Pun.


That's about it. That's about, yeah. Good punting. Do you guys remember any of your takes that were notably bad? I Don't think I had a single bad one this year. Yeah, I Don't think so either. I think I was a hundred percent accurate. I Might've said Justin Fields is the guy a hundred times. But I also walked that back. I might've said, Sam, how's the guy? I might've said that. There's no way the Celtics are gonna lose to Luca or beat Luca. Yeah. Hank, I I had a good year. Yeah. Actually you, you did. 'cause you just, you either won or were terrible. Yeah. So the lighthouse was real. Yeah. Well, we'll get to that. We have a take you for that. All right. So drum roll. The winner for the 2024 take of the year. Takey is Dan Orlowski.


Congratulations. Dan Orlowski incredible saying he believes Belichick will win another Super Bowl with Mac Jones and qb. Mac Jones is the best rookie QB that I've ever seen since doing this job when it comes to knowing where to go with the football, when to go with the football, and how to throw that football ever seen is just something you should not ever seen is crazy. That's what a, it was, it was like the sixth QB draft and it was class. Yeah. It, it was between that and the hate to be the adult in the room where the, where I think the two finalists, because it's not to win the take of the year, you have to really like, do a say something in it that is so absolute that it's like, come on, man. Ever seen the Adult in the room is a tough one because you're, you're already, you're crowning yourself.


Yeah. Right. By, by introducing or introducing your point. That way the orlovsky take about Mac Jones is noteworthy just because of how badly Mack Jones flamed out this year. Yeah. So good. When you're getting, you get benched multiple times for Bailey Zappy. It's tough to say, well, you know what? Maybe he was a great, maybe he maybe we're misremembering. Maybe we're allowing the recent history of M Jones to not remember how great he was. How great He was. Yeah. We'll always have that season. I Also am now thinking about it. I don't think there's ever been an adult in a, in, in a room that has argued about a fifth round draft pick. No, no. That's the exact opposite of being an adult in the room. The adult in the room says, why are you guys arguing over a fifth round draft pick.


Yeah. Hate. This is crazy. Yeah. Hate to be the only one with a level head on my shoulders. But let's have an argument about Puka. Nku. Yeah. Okay. PFT. You have our next Award. Yeah. Next up we're doing, this is an Award that I absolutely love. Yep. We've done it, I Believe every year of the show. Yes. Maybe not the first one, but it's the Lib of the Year. Award Lib of the Year.

Dead is dead. Let The record show. OJ is fucking dead. Me. I wouldn't die. You remember when Hank found out that OJ died because Oh, then that was, that was one of my favorite parts of the year. We Got actually with that clip in, we put that clip in.


That was an incredible, that was, that was in midst of Hank either missing shows. 'cause he was sleeping too late, late or he was all over the place sleeping. Yeah. You actually, you missed O j's death. Yeah. OJ died. Did you know that? What OJ died? Yeah. Oh, nice. We get to break the news. Hank oj o iss dead. OJ Simpson. Dead. OJ Simpson. Dead. Dead. How dead Died by death. Dead. Dead. That's confirmed. Yes. Her confirmed dead. Everyone's been talking about it. Very dead. That's insane. He is Dead. He ain't coming back. That is. Wow. That is absolute insane. I wish we hadn't told him. Yeah. How See, how long could he go without knowing who's back of the week on Monday? Yeah. Wow.


So Hank, you didn't know OJ died. No. What are your thoughts on oj? Bad guy. Yeah. Good riddance. And woke up at 11, 11:00 AM one day on a show day and found out that OJ Died. I hope everybody out there had the pleasure and the opportunity of getting to break the OJ death news to somebody. Yes. That was, that was an honor to do that to Hank. Yes. Yes. I didn't believe it. Yeah. No, he's dead. Won the trophy and everything. Dead person of the year. Dead Person of the year. Okay. We Should get death back on the podcast. I agree. Recurring guest. We gotta Find him. So yeah. What would you say for like, you don't want him to rest in peace. No. In rest. No. Rest in piss. Rest in piss. Yeah. Rest in piss. RIP bozo rest in piss. He won't be missed. Yeah. Welcome to Hell Bitch.


Smoking on that Simpson pack. Hell is your offensive line being 120 pounds and you gotta pound the rock. I don't think OJ would've held up over a 17 game season. Agreed. Especially 18 too. Yeah. Couldn't play in today's NFL Someone Threw out the idea, which I kinda liked. Well, actually, I, I take that back. I don't like it, but it was interesting. 18 game season, every player can only play a maximum of 16 games. Oh, I like that Little bit. But then I was like, I don't like it because it would way too many excuses and it would really suck to be excited about a game and be like, fuck, now we're watching Desmond Ritter. Yeah. I like it in theory because it just, it's chaos.


Yeah. It's, it Would be, it's a wrinkle would be, strategery would be awesome, but Like 17, you can't do two games. Everyone has to sit out one week. Yeah. This sounds a lot like Little League where everybody gets to Play. And I was thinking about, the more I was thinking about it, I was like, alright, I, I liked it at first and then I thought I definitely would get fucked. 'cause I'd like bet a line on Monday and then they'd be like, this is the game we're throwing. Yeah. And I'd get fucked. Yeah. There's so furious. A lot of reasons why that probably wouldn't work out in reality. But it's, it's fun to think about. It's A fun, it's a fun idea. It's a thought experiment. It's A very good green. This is, this is how rule. This is how dudes use our imagination. Yeah. We just think about wrinkles to the 18 game season puzzle. Yeah.


18 games is so good. We Should get like, like what was the, what was the movie where they were cracking the code for the Nazis or they were cracking the code of the Nazis imitation game game. Yep. A movie. We need that. We need a, we need a camp with nerds trying to figure out the perfect 18 game schedule. It would be very funny though to see if, if they did have that rule where each player could only play 16 games, the dumbest coaches would think that they had it figured out. Correct. And they completely screw it up. Correct. That, that would be like Mike McCarthy would absolutely fuck that idea up. Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. He'd like, he'd one week, he'd, he'd sit his entire defense next week sit his entire offense. He'd sit Dak and cd Lamb at the same time.


Yeah. And be like, we're using this as an opportunity to see what a roster's gonna look like next season. Yeah. And then, and then the week that they don't sit, like they, they would sit Dak and CD Lamb and then a different week he would sit the entire offensive line. Yeah. Dak would get killed. Yeah. He was like, God dammit, Mike McCarthy. We got our computer guys, our computer guys told us this is the right move. Yeah. Okay. Next up, Next up we have the Lighthouse of the year. Ooh. Ooh. The Lighthouse of the Year. A lot of good lighthouses out there. This is a huge year. Maybe the biggest year in the history of this show for lighthouses. I'd say they're having a moment. The nominees are to the lighthouse. The book. Oh. Nominated. It's a great, great book.


Was that the book Light Read? We got 'em. I got 'em. I don't know. Did I get you a book you bought Hank? That's the meanest thing you could do. Yeah. Well, it was a children's book. Okay. Was it about lighthouses? It was about lighthouses, Yeah. We read it. It was in the old house. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That, that book is also nominated. Okay. Whatever that book was called Hank. You remember it? What was it called? I don't know. Okay. I remember the book. I don't remember the name. You remember seeing a book? He saw a book and you ran the other direction. Hank's seen so many books in his life. Hank Hank thinks, sees, sees something, say something is about books. Yeah. Hank, do you have any, do you own any books? I do. What books do you own in your, in your home? Hank sees a backpack full of books and he calls the cops. I have a, a Larry Bird biography that I've, I've been, I've read like 10 pages of, at multiple points.


I'm not, Hey listen, I've started over 40 books in the last five years. Not finished a single one of 'em. So I'm, I'm with you on that. I have a book about habit that I'm also trying to read about Habit breaking, breaking bad habits. Okay. But you can't, I haven't been reading. You can't focus enough To No. Nope. Nope. That's a, I mean that I've Read it before though. It's wait, so Like 10 years ago. So you have read it? Yes. This is is this, Why are you rereading the book about breaking? Because it Didn't work. Is This Sisyphus? The the the Pushing it up. Pushing Up Cliff? Yeah. Hank trying to start a book about having good habits that would help him read a book Hank In a Timely Fashion.

Make a Jack Gokey rule that basically we just get to vote on like five guys every March. Madness. That no matter their eligibility, they get to stay another year. It'd be nice because Jack Gke this year would be such a fun story to watch. Just turn on a random Oakland game and be like, oh, Jack Gokey's going off again.


Because the thing is, Jack Gke could beat anybody on the right night. Yes, he Can. He showed that. Yep, he showed that. Okay, next. Award up.

I don't remember. Who did we actually go see death about? Lasorda. Lasorda. Lasorda. Yeah. So it might have been Lasorda, so it might be the Tommy Lasorda Award. Either way, the still alive person of the year. This is a person you can't believe is still alive. The nominees are Joe Biden possibly still Alive. Still Alive by the time this airs. He's Like a, like a, we are taping this a week before we air it.


He's Like step alive. Okay. Or like, he's like a divorced dad. He's alive every other weekend. And We don't want to jinx this, by the way, we don't want any of these people to die. Don't want this to become a jinx thing. Joe Biden's still alive. Donald Trump's still alive. Yep. By inches. By inches. Nancy Pelosi still alive. Physically. Physically still alive. Cannons.

Yeah. And Jimmy Carter, who won it last year. Now this is, this would be an amazing run and still alive for Jimmy Carter because I believe he's been in hospice for like two years. He, We, we talked about it when it happened, but his grandson said that there are some days he just doesn't wake up. Yeah. Which is a telltale sign of being dead. That's true. Not waking up is dead. Or you could be hibernating. Yeah. So some days he just doesn't wake up. But without further ado, the still alive person of the year for 2024 is Jimmy Carter again.


Congrat back to back Championship for Jimmy Carter. He's outlasted the still alive person of the year. Year. He won it last year. He stayed alive for the entire year. Again, we are taping this seven days before we air it. Who knows? I, but he's still alive. Memes just sent the, the picture of Nancy Pelosi in the group chat. Canons right? Respect. Yeah. Respect it. Respect. It's respectful Canons. It's respectful cannons. Yeah. Hey, come on. Yeah. No. I'm guy like you. Guy like you with those glasses on. Looking right. Looking right. She looking right. Okay. So Jimmy Carter wins.


still alive person of the year. Unbelievable. I think he can do a threepeat. I I listen. If anybody can do it, it's Jimmy. It'll be unprecedented. I don't think anyone will be able to top it. I don't even know if anyone will be able to top a two. Pete, has anybody ever, ever been not dead for three years? Ooh, I don't think so. I don't think so. Congrat you. And again, he is half dead. Listen, Jimmy's set up right now. He really is. Okay, next up. Next up we have Scout of the Year. Ooh. The Scout of the Year. Award. Okay. The nominees are Tony Scheffer's cat. Yes. Scouty Scouty.

Connor Stallions out of the year. One of the craziest stories, like we don't give it enough credit. How crazy. That story. I know there's a Netflix documentary coming out. I can't wait for that. I cannot wait for that. And I actually think the person we have presenting is part of it. Oh, he is gonna be in it. He's gonna be in it. Okay. I can I just watch a single documentary about sports on TV without Dave Portnoy showing up. He is, he is. He is in it. And he's presenting this Award. I Now, I texted him to ask him for this. We, we have not, I have not watched it. So we're watching it all together. And I'm guessing he might be ad-libbing a little bit about Michigan.


Let's see. Okay. Here he is. Our presenter for Scout of the Year. Hey, this is Captain Dave. Proudly here to present the 2024 Takey for Scout of the Year. A scout an important, honest, upstanding member of any organization whose job in the military, in the Navy, on the football field, scout the opponent. Give any clues, anything you can give to help your team succeed. Nobody exemplified the American spirit, the marine spirit, the football spirit. The Michigan man's spirit more than Connor Stallions proud to Award him the 2024 Scout of the Year.


National champs. Go blue. Yeah. All right. All right. Congrats. Dave. Looks like a old sailor now. Yeah. He, I don't know what's going on with his, here he is. Got the beard. His beard. Just sunburn the hat. What's that? What There's a logo. What is the logo? Gordon Fisherman. Is that it? He looks a little bit like the Gordon Fisherman. Yes. Yeah. He does. All due respect. But Connor Stallion. Connor Stallion. Great human being. Incredible, incredible story. He is Scout of the Year. Incredible story. Like inspire like you said that like it was an inspiring It is. It's a very inspiring story. Hank, when he was growing up, all he wanted to do was help Michigan football win a national championship. And he set a plan into place where he joined the United States Marines, learned recon tactics.


And then took that, wrote a fucking manifesto, joined his way onto the Michigan football program first as like an unpaid assistant, just like a volunteer. Worked his way up into the point where he was providing actual information about their opponents based on him sneaking into games and shit. With tactics he learned in the Marines. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And they, and they won a national championship also. It's just, it's a great story. It's As simple as this. Hank, he wrote a manifesto and didn't kill anyone. That's hard to do. People write manifesto, those state, they, they kill people. That's a manifesto is a bad thing. Connor Stallion's world of manifesto and all his dreams came true. Yeah. We should be thanking our lucky stars that he is obsessed with college football and not some weird corner of the internet that we don't even know about yet.


Didn't we get a story? Oh, yes. Now this flashing back at beer games. A couple guys who were on the Michigan team said after they won the national title, which was, where was it played? Was it La Houston? No, Houston. They went out after they were out at a bar, maybe a strip club. I'm gonna say bar. And in the corner of that bar, maybe strip club. Connor Stallions was just sitting there and he kind of did like a good job and gave him like a ta a hat tip. And was like, job well done. I love that. And they're like, how the fuck was he here? So he's everywhere. He's everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. Huey as a Michigan man, what is your, what are your thoughts on Connor Stallion?


He's a great man. I mean, just a, a a hero to the community. I mean, I let him watch my kids if I had One. Okay. Okay. That's, that's a ring your Voice. That's huge. Would you watch your kids If? you had one? I'd probably give it To him. Okay. Yeah, he'd give. All right. So there it is. So not only did he just win a takey, he won Huey's future child. Yeah. Any good Michigan man should just volunteer their firstborn to Connor Stallions. Yes. I, it, it really is. Maybe my favorite college football story Ever. It was incredible. It was incredible. Okay. Great. Award, next up we have Gambler of the Year. Wow. Big one. Lot of gamblers This year. So the nominees are ante porter for getting suspended from the NBA lifetime suspension.


Yeah. For betting his own props and taking himself outta games. Yep. He hit all his, all his bets, right? Yeah. I think so. So he was a pretty good gambler. Yeah, he was A good gambler. He was a, yeah. He he had a system. He almost went tout Pro athletes. Just shouldn't be on discord like that. Leave it, leave, leave the discord for the nerds. Yeah. Also, what Was he doing on Discord that He was in a gambling messaging group? And that's like, I think that's how it happened. They kind of like, They had the receipts. Yeah. And they were probably the ones telling them like, yo, Yo, come out of the Game. We got a way to make some money. Also just Don't get more than four rebounds. Right. Crazy. For him to, like, I feel like if you're a, a starter in the NBA and you did this, it'd be very hard to prove when you're gente porter, it's very easy to prove.


'cause he played such little minutes and no one Bets. His Propst was Really where it Was props. Right. Right. And then it's a hundred thousand dollars on his prop in a random February game. And he's coming out with a fake shoulder injury. Yeah. Every other player that is getting the minutes that he was getting would not take themselves outta the game for anything. Correct. It's like, I need, I need every minute. Correct. Give me every minute that, that I'm promised. And he was just like, no, my eye hurts. Yeah. Ow my eye. Great Excuse, by the way. Yeah. Great. Excuse Sho Tani Gambler of the Year. Alleged Great work. Yes. SHO's interpreter also up for Gambler of the Year, not alleged. Yeah. The forensic accountants came back and they said that the, the Ipe, right.


Ipe Ipe. It was all IPE show. Had no idea whatsoever. But I, I hope that at least on the winning, so on the bets that he did win, maybe Ipe broke 'em off a little something. Yeah. Just cut 'em off a little. Something. Dave Portnoy is actually nominated for Gambler of the Year. 'cause he had his stretch where he won pretty much every single bet. Michigan Yukon. Who else? Celtic. He won over a million dollars four times. Yeah. All huge underdogs. Insane. Yeah. The, I didn't have that conversation with him that it was like, th this is the year of the chalk and, I mean, became the hottest gambler. But that's, you know, Results are results. Results are, you don't, you never give back a winner.


You never do. Because it Doesn't matter. Yeah. Because when you lose, people let you know about it. Correct. So you have to let them know when you get one. Right. And you still gotta Put the money up. And he Had the Oilers into the, that wasn't a chalk that he had them into game seven. Yeah. We have all of the Lions If, you remember, it was basically the entire Lions secondary Jameson Williams. They had to cut a couple guys. Now I still think they got screwed because all they did was they didn't bet on the NFL. They just logged onto their gambling account while at the Lions facility. You gotta have an IT guy who's better than that. Yeah. So the, it it's supposed to be like geofence, right? Yeah. Like if you're an IT guy, you block those websites, those apps, or you Just pretend it never happened On company property.

No. I believe in more than this than you're dunking For sure. I'll give him that. Yeah. I think that that's a very fair thing to say. Yeah. I, I think there's, 'cause you can switch out parts on the car. It's way More likely than this get gets done. Than the, than the dunk. Yeah. Okay. For sure. But the fact that you're saying 2025 doesn't gimme a lot of confidence. Well, no, I have, we have to. 'cause you're already, we have to get it fixed. No, it's like we're, I have to find someone. Stop Saying we, It's we who's whose car Who owns it? No one. Oh. Literally it doesn't. Well, that part.


I'm not you, you gotta do the Administrative shit. No, no, no. What? No. Wait, what did administrative, I Don't. Absolutely not. You were, you, You the one that got it back here? I No, I didn't. No, I didn't. I did not. I had nothing to do with it. Getting back here. Zero. The last I had to do with Vanny Woodhead was I was paying like hundreds of dollars in insurance and I gave it to Billy. I said, get it, get it off my insurance and get it off the road and have it go to a chop shop. And he said, done. And then it came back to life. 'cause he just never did that. Shocker. And then everything from that moment, I have not, I have not had anything to do with where have I had anything to do with it. Why, how Did it just spawn here?

I don't know. Registered. That's, that's the administrative, I'm not like, I'm not the most administrative guy. I can figure out getting it fixed, getting it sold and getting it. Like, I'm pretty confident that Huey's gonna be pretty good at the administrative Yeah. Stuff. Me too. Me too. He's gonna be really good. Yeah. He's gonna be running all over the city. Yeah. It doesn't sound, here's my concern. Maybe We turn into the pug mobile. It doesn't sound like Hank's excited about Fanny Woodhead anymore, like I am. No, I am. I just kind of forgot about it.

All the, all the times that it hasn't gone that poorly. And then finally the guy pissing with the weirdest grip ever, he was told that he couldn't use the bathroom upon takeoff and he just started pissing in the middle of the aisle.


That guy rocks. Can I, can I say something controversial? Yeah, I understand where he is coming. Oh, That's not controversial at all. Okay. Okay. Good. I The only, I I Understand There have been times in the past year where we're in the plane, the plane is yet to reach, its cruising altitude, seatbelt lights on, and I gotta go really bad. Like really, really bad emergency level. And I've been told no, go back to your seat. I did not pull my penis out and pee onto the, the aisle of the plane. But I'd be lying if the thought didn't occur to me to do that. Yeah. Did you get up and then get told to sat down? Because I feel like I have If. you really had to go, especially If, you was in the first row.


You can basically just look the other way from the flight attendant and just get in the bathroom. So, and then when you come out, you're in trouble, but you're, you've, yeah. At least you've done it. Like if worst case scenario, like that's only in an emergency situation, but you kind of have to like If you really worst case emergency. Like you could, you could make it happen. There was a flight that Without having to like, you know, I, I know that it out was on this flight with me. I don't know if Big, Cat or Max were, but I remember making eye contact with Hank on this flight and we got delayed on the tarmac for like 30 minutes. I got up after like 20. 'cause I'm like, I gotta take a piss. So I get up and I get told no. They're like, go sit back down. We turn the seatbelt light on, we're about to take off. And so I'm like, okay, I guess I'll just listen to you. I turn around, go back to the seat, wait there another like 20 minutes passes.


Yep. And I get up again and the, the flight attendant's like, please stop. And I was like, it's an emergency, I gotta go. And so I just walked past or went into the bathroom, peed, came out. Then 10 minutes later we took off. But she was trying to, she was holding my piss hostage at that point. That should be included on the passenger's bill of rights. Like If. you gotta go, you gotta go. Agreed. Yeah. I, the only, the only thing that, the only mistake this gentleman made was I would just piss my pants and knock out in the felony. Yeah. The pissing your pants registering as a sex offender. Probably. Yeah. Not good. Not Worth it. Not Good. So to present plain passage of of the year, we have our good friend Jerry O'Connell. Hello, I'm Jerry O'Connell, actor TV presenter and a WLI am here today to name the winner of the 2024 Takey for Passenger of the Year.


Without further ado, the winner is Wow. Tiffany Gomez. To accept the Award for Tiffany is me, Jerry O'Connell, actor TV presenter. And a WL Tiffany gave me a message to convey to the world. But I, I would personally like to take a moment and convey a message of my own to you Tiffany Gomaz. Tiffany, to, to fully comprehend the impact you've made. We, we, we need to start around 3,500 BC with the invention of the wheel. Around 2000 BC humans began using horses for travel.


1783 ad the hot air balloon round 1800, the first sea locomotives automobiles. Later in the 18 hundreds and in 1903, the Wright Brothers made their first controlled flight. There was some space travel after that that we'll skip past because we need to get to that fate. Fateful day of July 2nd, 2023. The day passenger transport changed forever. On July 2nd, Tiffany boarded flight 10 0 9 from Dallas-Fort Worth to Orlando. When a family member stole Tiffany's AirPods and Tiffany told us that motherfucker was not real.


There was a reason Tiffany was getting the fuck off and they can believe it or they cannot believe it. Tiffany doesn't give two fucks. But Tiffany was telling us right then that that motherfucker, that motherfucker back there was not real. We thank you Tiffany. We thank you for warning everyone. I mean, yeah, everyone did have to deplane and go through security again. The flight was delayed like three hours.

The nominees are Jonathan Ross, who said prediction AI will displace social drinking within five years.


Just as alcohol is a social dis disinhibitor, like the Steve Martin movie, Roxanne. People will use AI powered earbuds to help them socialize. At first we'll view it as creepy, but it will quickly become superior to alcohol. So five years, no more beer. We're just gonna be robots. We're Just gonna wear ear pods. Yeah. That sounds awful. Two, 2,600 quote tweets. This guy sounds like he just smashes the AI button for every product. Yeah. For every, every problem that he has. Yeah. 7.7 million views on that one. That one was quite something. This one is just funny because it, it was a woman said, the flex I like to see, and it was a kid holding a sign that said, I read a thousand books.


A thousand books club before kindergarten. So it's a 5-year-old. Yeah. Is that I, I don't know. I'm not an expert on kids. Do they typically read before kindergarten? No. They don't know how to read before kindergarten. But the, the ratio is so, so this person tweeted it. They had 67 million views, 5,000 quote tweets on it. And the best quote tweet was someone said, no footage. Just a piece of paper. He a fraud Like wilt talking about Wilt Chamberlain. I love that. Great. A great, great reply.

You've been there before. 22 million views, 3,200 quote tweets. And one of the best one is perfect example of why spoiled franchises across all sports don't deserve to win. I've celebrated First Downs harder than this. Yeah. There were a lot of people saying like, I've celebrated a, a touchdown for my backup running back in a fantasy league. Harder than this. Yeah, it is. It does infuriate me looking at how much success Boston sports has had, where this is how they celebrated championship. Yeah. So that was quite something. This one is anonymous.

This one is from the storyteller. She said Keanu Reeves would totally shit himself if anyone actually tried to kill him, let alone thousands of evil hit men. He's just a makeup wearing salesman.

That's pretty good. Hank, that kind of blew your mind. Did you? 1600. Sorry. Did You not realize that Keanu Reeves was an actor?

Big Cat. It's because you were acting in that clip. Try selling truth instead. That's true.

Alright. Alright. I'm up for debate. All right. Okay. Okay. Back to back. Back to back. Alright. Next up we have the Ruth Kanda forever. Award take you of the year. This is now this is our, our coworker Kevin, Kevin Clancy started this when we had the famous Ruth Kanda tweet that went viral. I think it was four or five years ago. It, it read, just told my 10-year-old daughter about RRBG, with his Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she passed away. What's this? The first I'm hearing of this? The, yeah. She, she, what? What, what was the song Playing? Fuck.


It was like hilarious When he is on the tarmac. Yeah, it's a great clip. It was like Rocket Man or something. Yeah, it was Rocket Man. Man. Yeah. I think it was Rocket Man. All right. So just told my 10-year-old daughter about RBG. She had tears in her eyes and then she did the Wakanda pose and said Ruth Kanda forever. Which is the sort of pop culture crossover that I can celebrate. I love that. So this Award is for people who basically just go online and lie about what their kids say in terms of politics. 'cause they're too scared to say it themselves. The lowest of the low. The lowest of The low. I imagine having a fictional child say something online. The Lowest of the low. So the nominees this year we have some good, we have three great nominees. One happened just recently, this is from Jojo, from jurors. She said, I told my 11-year-old daughter that Joe had dropped out and she started to cry and through her tears she asked, so who will run now?


And I said, Kamala. And then she shouted, fuck yes. That's so, that's so true. So true. And it's so sweet. So true. This is She's, she's one of those Twitter accounts that she has to be online all the time. Yes. She has to have notifications set up for e every tweet, no matter what Like part of the news ecosystem it comes from. Yeah. If it's politics, sports, weather. She's always like the first reply to Yes. Yes. Wild move. Yes. The nexus from Ellie NYC, she said, or he, I don't know. Ellie S she one L Ellie. ELIE. Ellie Schmidt. Yeah. My kid just said, it's sad to watch a pack of lies beat a good person just because the good person can't speak.


Talking about Joe Biden versus Donald Trump in their debate. That's a fair point. Like you can't lie. If, you can't talk. Yeah. And Ellie replied, I literally just gave him a hug and said that debates don't matter. Turns out debates do matter. They do a lot. They matter a Lot. It's kind of where that kind Of, It's kinda where you talk about things All, all fell apart. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, and then the last one is from Rebecca Hazelton. She said everyone dies one day. Everyone, even wolves. But not books, not words. Words don't die. My son, three who is a lot smarter than I I'm, Words don't talk.


There's the, I have a 3-year-old, I don't think three year olds know what death is. A three year old's never constructed this type of sentence. Yeah. Like let alone the death part. The sentence. Yeah. No. 3-year-old. My son started talking to me about death's around four and a half. My three-year-old has no idea. But again, let me read it. This is from a 3-year-old. Everyone dies one day. Everyone, Everyone, Everyone. Yeah. Let do a kid's voice. Everyone dies. One day, everyone. Even wolves. But not books. Not woods. Woods don't die. What the fuck? Why did this is bad parenting? Why did you teach your 3-year-old that wolves die?


Seriously? And that everyone dies? Yeah. I don't wanna know that when I'm three. No. Hell no. Okay. So Ruth condo of forever, which is a, I'm happy we added this category, shadow Kevin. And the winner is for the Ruth Kanda forever. Takey Award. It's Rebecca Hazelton. Everyone dies one day. Everyone, even wolves. But not books, not words. Words don't die. My son, three who is a lot smarter than I am, Wolves die. Wolves die. But Not words. We, so we, we, we taped the take he over two days. So a little outta order at points. And I tried to coach my three-year-old to say this whole thing.


And I sent you guys a video and she got the last sentence. And it wasn't even correct. Yeah. It was like, I think she said words. Yeah. Words. So it, it do, it proves yet again that this is the most bullshit thing ever. I was saying the words to her feeding her lines and she couldn't get it. If. you do have a child though. That is that eloquent. What a content goldmine that would be. Yeah. Seriously. You can just retire right now. Yeah.

That's, That's a little Just past half. Yeah. Yep. Deshaun Watson. Oh, He might've been worse than that actually. Yeah, he, he was, I think we had him in the twenties. Okay. Gardner Minsu. That feels, that feels about right. Yep. For Gardner. Yep. I feel like he could win this.


Gino Smith and Dak Prescott. Oh, ooh. Okay. And the winner of the first annual 17th Best Quarterback of the year, Award is Dak Prescott. Wow. Congrats Dak. Congrats. Now, we didn't do this Award just so that we could put it on a, a, a logo and, and post it. Did we? No, we grinded through hours and hours of tape. We watched every throw that he made going back to Mississippi State. We watch everything about Dak Prescott. Yes. And we put it in together a a a spreadsheet and a proprietary algorithm. And it spat this out. So Dak is officially the 17th best quarterback in the NFL. Wow. Incredible. Of the year. It's now it's cemented because once you win win to take you, it's cemented forever.


That is what you are. Okay. We got a few left. We're rounding it out. We still got Blake Of The Year left. We still got podcast listeners of the year left. But next up we have the best four win team of the year. Now you might be saying, what the hell? Four win teams, but guess what? Four Win teams are usually the teams that are next up. There were some great four one teams Series. They're building something. First up, the New England Patriots who went four and 13. Huge, Huge season for Yep. For your boys. Enormous Start, started the championship. DVD, right. Hank? Yep. Was Drake May Draft Night Also up the Washington Commanders. Yeah. Four and 13.


Yeah. Now I, I gotta give credit to Hank, his four win team was better. We drafted before them, so we got Jayden Daniels. That's true. Yeah. Did you see the Giants clip? No. From hard knocks. No. The GM S's son, he said, you gotta get Jayden Daniels If. you wanna win, you gotta take a shot. Wow. Yeah. And then he said Ruth Kza forever. He said, books don't matter. No books matter. The Colorado Buffaloes four and eight. Yeah. What a great, what a great start. Incredible season. Dion was college football. Yeah. And then finally the Arizona Cardinals are up for the four win team of the year with their four and 13 record.


So they were better than the Patriots because you drafted before the Cardinals, right? Yeah. So they might, according to my metrics here, they're the best four win team in the NFL. Yeah. That's facts. Yeah. Okay. Drum roll. And the winner for best four win team of the year goes to the Colorado Buffalo. Congrats, Colorado. Incredible. I know the ESPYs probably ignored the Colorado buffaloes, but not here. Not on Pardon. My Take. We're giving it to 'em. The best four win team of the year. ESPN doesn't pay any attention to Colorado football. Finally, They're getting Shine. It's disgusting. Yep. Finally they're getting some shine. We, We also fucked up when we did the Mount Rushmore animals that you'd like to be. Yep. Because if we're taking animal mascots, I feel like Ralphie should be right at the top.


Yeah. Ralph Ralphie's got a great gig. Ralphie lives on a farm outside Boulder. They bring her onto the field, she runs and they don't really tell her where to go. They're just like, we're bringing this buffalo out onto the field. Yeah. And let's just let the chips fall where they may. Yeah. Ralphie's the best. Okay. What do we got next? Okay, up next we have the buyout of the year. Ooh, good one. A lot of good buyouts in 2023. 2024. Hmm. First nominee is Russell Westbrook. Yeah. The buyout King Russell Westbrook. See, two in a row in Utah. He's putting together mini dynasty of buyouts. Hasn't played a single second of basketball.


Practiced with the team even. But he's getting paid. Yeah. Next up we have Monty Williams. Mm. Monty Williams, former son. Double Buyout. Former piston. Yeah. Back to back. And the final nominee for buyout of the year is Jimbo Fisher. Yeah. Jimbo Fisher got the big check from Texas a and m. We saw the big check get delivered onto the field the week before the buyout hack One of the best college football wrinkles, like Texas a and m especially because of all the oil money. But yeah, the, the, the donor donating like a hundred million dollars at halftime of a Texas a m game. And then seven days later, Jimbo Fisher getting bought out was so perfect. And all three of these guys really hats off to them.


Yeah. They're all Winners. Because you've accomplished the American dream. Correct. You're getting paid to stop working. Correct. That's awesome. The winner of the 2024 buyout of the year Takey is Jimbo Fisher. Wow. In Texas a and m, the price of price of oil and gas went up. They were able to afford it. Got him outta town. Now he's just gonna go fishing for a while. What was his buyout again? Shit. What was it? Jimbo Fisher's buyout. It was so awesome. I wanna say he got like $70 million. It's also so funny because when you get a buyout, $75 million, when you get a buyout like that, you get a bunch of people. Oh. 77 million. You get a bunch of people who don't follow college football that like fly in from the crowd and being like, they can't fire him.


The the buyouts too big. It's like no, no, no, no. Listen, there's no buyout too big. When You're the only game in town, if you're especially at a, a big state school that's in a small town, that's where all the money goes. Yes. So they will figure out a way to at least be, now this is actually a sweet spot for, for schools. Like we always say Penn State, but I also feel like a and m could sneak into a college football playoff too. Yeah. This is a good spot for them. Yeah, it is. Move. It is. Okay, next up Max, get off of my my Taylor Swift tweet. You're gonna accidentally retweet it. I know. That's what you're gonna do. It's Up to 40 million views. Get off of it. You just retweeted it. Come on dude. You fucking asshole.


It is funny though. It Was accident. It was accident. I also don't, I mean my fat face Max. You do have just like a, a ace in the hole at all times. You just retweet it every day. Oh, I won't delete it. I'll never delete it. Okay, let's get to our next Award. Can't win the big one of the year. Lot of, lot of, lot of athletes can't win the big one. A lot of big ones out there that can't be won. Yeah. So we had Connor McDavid can't win the big one. Can't Do it. Can't win the big one. People Say almost did.

That's actually a fair statement. Yeah, that's a fair point. Yeah. but it would be about you.

MVPI personally, if I thought they were gonna win the whole thing, I would've, I would've started there. Yeah. That's your, that could be your Take. Who cares about the Eastern Conference Finals. MVP. Yeah. Who does? That's my take. Okay. Huey. The WNBA. Okay. The finals of the WNBA specifically will have more ratings, will have the third most ratings in the fall. Wait third more ratings or third most. Third Most in the fall, the season of fall. So behind college football and the NFL. Okay. There needs to be a third place. Got it.

Oh, interesting. Oh, interesting. And what, what's on your shirt? Right? Lab Conkey. Also Rookie of the Year. What's on your shirt right now? Offense. What's what's your shirt say? What is your shirt? Your shirt? I Can't, oh, is is a charger shirt. Oh, it's a junior sale. Okay. All right. Got it. Got it. It's nicest outfit. Okay. Alright Boys. My preemptive take of the year is that Taylor Swift and Travis are going to get engaged. Oh. And then she's gonna put out a terrible album. Oh. Because she's happy and she doesn't have any boyfriends to complain about.


And then all her fans are gonna start to hate her because her music sucks. Because she's happy with her personal life. Wow. How about that? I like it. I like it. Okay. My preemptive take of the year. I believe Henry Lockwood is going to dunk. Let's go. Not you got knotted. I can't believe you fell for that. I believe. Okay. That's my preemptive take. Henry Lockwood's gonna dunk. Not that's improper English is it? There's a comment in there. Dunk, not dunk.


Not, no, I think you're gonna be able to dunk. I really Do I. Actually Do I do too. Psych hank my preem. Are you high right now? Hank? No. How high? I should rephrase that. How High? 0% high. I believe you're gonna be able to dunk Hank. I just don't wanna say thank you 'cause I said thank you. I got nodded. What type of knot? What type of knot was that? PFT Doesn't matter. I believe you're gonna be able to dunk. Thank you. Psych. Yeah, that's fine. No, I actually Do. I actually a hundred percent believe you're gonna dunk. 'cause you you've been working out a lot. You've been training a lot. Thanks. Gotcha.


Alright. What's your preemptive take? But it wouldn't be the most shocking thing. If, you did? No, I think I'm going to, it's opposite day. Yeah. Okay. What's your preemptive take? My preemptive take of the year is that Drake May in New England, Patriots Oh. Are going to have more combined wins than the Washington football team and Chicago Bears. Combined. Combined. That is the craziest thing. It's wild. That's wild. Hank. That's wild. How many wins? Seven. So we're gonna have se we're gonna have six combined More equal. So maybe few. One that has four. One has three. That's that's wild.


That's wild. Take Hank. Okay. I would you like to wager on that? No, I'm already in pretty deep with PFT, so I'm I'm just Gonna, yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Sometimes I forget. Like I, I feel like I'm a bad gambler. And then I remember that Hank is gonna owe me what, $20,000? I think it was 50. $50,000. No, you were gonna owe me 50. Yeah. I I'm already gonna be up 20. So I think it was 50 to three or 50 to 30. So I think you might owe me 30,000. No, we'll, we'll, we'll it wasn't that. If the Patriots don't make the Super Bowl and how many years now? I think it was 50 to 10. I think it was five years. but it, a year has passed. Think it. There's no way. I give you 50 To 30. So it's four more years. Yeah, four more years. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the, there's always money in the bananas. I got it. I'm rich. Yeah. I'm gonna be so rich in four years.


I gotta make a Super Bowl in the next four years. Easy. That was easy. You love Drake. May I actually do? Yeah, I know. I've seen the T-shirt. We should release that.


Okay. Quick break from the take for the Rollback question. Rollback question for memes and pug because you guys are sitting here with me and we forgot to do the Rollback question, but now we're here. Rollback. Question for memes and pugs. How is the editing of the techies going? It's a great Time. It's a great time. Yeah. It's just so many fun awards. I don't know which one's my favorite Pug.

Okay. It's time for one of the most important awards we give away every single year at the techies. It is Blake, Of The Year time. So here's what we're doing. We've done 'em many different ways for people who are listening to their first take. He, Blake Of. The Year is Blake Griffin. Blake Bortles. And we've added Brooks Keka probably five years ago. He Is a Blake. I don't know what the exact stats are. I believe Blake Griffin is a three time winner. I think it's Blake Bortles has two. Yeah, two. And Brooks has sadly zero. Can't win the big one. He has Zero. So we've done it every single way. We've, we we've, we've done it first to answer the phone call.


We've done trivia. We did the famous lottery ball year, which was painful and I'm shocked that these guys even still return our text messages. This year. We're going old school with a new school twist. It's gonna be similar to the phone call. The first to answer the phone one previous Blake of the years. This year we're gonna do a Zoom link. So I've told all three Blake's a window and it's, we're in the window right now. They're in all different parts of the world. Blake Brooks is in the uk. Blake Griffin is in La Blake Bortles is in Florida. When I texted them asking them what their availability was, Brook said he's playing in a golf tournament in England.


Blake Griffin said that he's got some meetings and shit that he's gotta attend to. And Blake Bortles said he has absolutely nothing. So Blake seems like he would be the betting favorite right now. But Brooks Koepka not on the course now though. Correct. Not on the course, but Blake Bortel iss also probably not the most technologically savvy. So Blake Griffin feels like he could be the leader in that respect. So Blake definitely has practiced. Yeah. He's like opened up his own, he's made, made sure that the app is is up to date. Yeah. That it's the most current version. Bortles might be kinda lounging around, but he might have more technical difficulties just accessing the app. Correct. He might not even have the app downloaded. Okay. And now how are we judging? Is it first to show?


We're screen recording so we'll have it exactly right. If they both show up at the same time, we'll figure it out. But it's first to, to join and we have to hear them and see them. Correct. Connect To, they have to connect to video and audio. Audio. Yeah. So once they join, if their, if their video is on the screen and we can't hear them. Doesn't count. Now are we allowed to tell them we can't hear you? Yeah. Okay. Shane, are you li if Shane is listening, can you, can you say something real quick? Just so the pe people know. Check, check, check, check. There we go. Testing. Okay. So that, that way that the people know it's not on our end. Right? Shane is able to connect the video and audio. Right now. Memes question. Blake. Bortles is his three times Three times three times three.


Threes. Three. Three zero. Wow. Wow. Okay. Either one will, either one will win the best of seven or one will break the, the dreaded streak. Yes. Get the monkey off the back. Yes. So I'm texting all three right this second. I'm saying first person to connect to video and audio on the zoom wins. Blake, Of, The, Year wins. Blake, Of, The Year 2024. I told them all to, even if they don't win, if they feel like they didn't win, they should still try to connect. 'cause we'd like to see 'em all. Big Cat. Real quick sidebar. I know we just laid out the entire rules and we planned this whole thing out. Is it more of a Blake move to not be able to Connect? No. No. To this? No. No. We, we, maybe next year we'll do that wrinkle. Okay. But I've already set this up.


If it was a hell of a time setting up three different time zones. Wildly I've Thought about it. Blake's probably not like, yeah. Ready to go. We Still also next year, next year we're golfing or doing something. Next year we're getting 'em all three together. We'll figure it out. I want to get 'em all three together. Okay, here we go. First person to connect to video and audio on the Zoom wins. Blake, Of, The Year 2024 with the zoom link sent. Oh my God. Okay. What If they, what if they all, all of them just don't join and we just sit here If the Blakes unionized. Oh, we have somebody. No, no way. That was so fast. No way it says bg. No way. Oh my God.


Oh my God. Can we hear 'em? Hello? Oh, I can hear. Let's Go. That Domination. You, you were literally waiting in bed. Oh, We got another one. I know. Here comes Blake Bortles. This is gonna be heartbreaking for him. Oh, Can't wait to talk shit about my wifi. Oh. And I think I we're Into the Blake Of The Year. Think Brooks might have tried to join just now too. Oh my God. Oh. Oh, What's up Brooke? What's up Blake? Oh, Blake's wifi too fucking good. Oh no. And Now I'm not gonna lie, boys, I had my my wifi guy come out this morning. We took the restrictor plate off this bad boy.


Not exactly street legal, but was it Worth it? Ho. Holy. That was crazy fast Shit. That was unbelievable. That was insanely fast. Wait, is Brooks joined or no? No. Brooks is Brooks, you might, you might just not join Brooks. Brooks is just the bad luck guy for every single, every single year. Blake, I Les, we got some, we got some beef to settle. Man, you're out on the streets saying I'm cheating out here. Oh Dude, it's these restrictor place in your wifi. These fucking, these catalytic converters. You're swiping. So wait, Listen man. Not, not street legal, but It's, it's worth it. That was crazy. You joined so fast. 'cause we've been taping this whole thing. I literally, you'll you'll be able to watch it fast. I literally, I went to the chat to check to make sure I was like it was gonna be in this thread and that it came through.


Yeah. So b's Are you out on your porch right now? Yeah, I've been sitting here for what time? Is it an hour? Probably Three minutes. Probably pretty far away from your router. Oh no. And do you know this is Blake B's I I I feel bad saying this to you. You guys probably are aware of this, but did you know it was three three until today? No. Yeah. Is that what the record was? Yes. You have, you are a three time Blake Of The Year winner. Blake Griffin is now a four time Blake. Of The Year winner. And Brooks. Brooks. Brooks, You're still, You might not even join this call. Yeah, this is tough.


Look for Brooks. I'd tell you what, having your notifications on extra loud for an hour is very annoying. Yeah, That was, that was actually shocking how fast you joined. Because we had a moment when we set the whole thing up, we're like, what if, what if none of these guys joined for like a half hour and we're just sitting here like fucking assholes. Just being like, will anyone join? Holy shit. I got a tough question for the two of you. Since Brooks isn't on the chat yet, has, has the word relegation been thrown around in regards to Brooks Kka? It's an interesting question. If I knew what that meant, I would 100% have an opinion. Okay. Like Relegating. Are we gonna relegate him down to the, to the division two?


Back to the Brooks League? Yeah. Drop him down to Brooks. I don't know. I mean, I feel like that's up to you guys. I don't know if, if that's a Blake's call. I, I'll, I'll say this in Brooks defense, he is probably at the biggest disadvantage 'cause he's in England and he said that he's at a, a remote place that has like very bad wifi. I think he just needs to quit the live tour and focus on Blake Of The Year. Yeah. If he was serious about it, I guess, you know. Yeah. Blake Griffin, do you wanna say anything? You want to Acceptance speech. I mean, this is one of the biggest takey awards that we give out every year. Yeah. I mean, honestly, dude, I, Blake you can probably attest to this, but everywhere I go, somebody yells, Blake Of, The Year, somebody yells Blake Of The Year.


So, I mean, this is a big, this is a huge Award. And, and it's, it means a lot to, to all of us. Some of us it means a little bit more, I guess Brooks doesn't, doesn't really care. But you know what, I'm just, I'm just happy to take it home this year. Great competition all around. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like this is a dynasty for you too. Yeah. Yeah. Now I get to do the Clay Thompson thing all the time and hold up four. Yeah. Yeah. This is, are you bad for Blake's? Are you so good at Blake Of? The Year? It might be, it might be bad for Blake's. Wait, who Won last year? Last Year? Boles did. Oh Yeah. So, okay. So this is, there's parody in this league still. Is it over? Was it best of seven?


Please. God, we just gonna keep going. So, Blake portals, what do you, I mean, I, I said the, I said beforehand, before we sent out the Zoom link that the text messages, when I sent you guys setting this all up was very funny because Brooks was like, I'm playing in a, a golf tournament. And Blake Griffin was like, I have some things going on. And you're like, I literally have nothing. So what, what, what is you gonna do to change in this off season? Because I mean, you, you just have to give up the Award and now you have a whole year to think about it. Yeah. And it's especially a tough look when I had nothing going on and I couldn't have joined, I couldn't have joined any sooner and I joined And you guys are in Blake or just in a full conversation already.


Yeah. It's not even like he's still trying to figure it out and connect. He was already in. So I think I'm gonna have to start packing the schedule a little bit and change things up. Yeah. It's gotta be heartbreaking. That's a good idea. And also in, in Brooks' defense, he's the only one that still has like a, a current job True. That they work at. So a little bit busy. True. Both. You guys nod? Yep. Yep. I got nothing going on. I can't wait to make the, the part of my take moving. And we get the actor from Clipped to play Blake. Yes. Blake. Blake Griffin. Blake Griffin year. We'll get, we'll get Sam Houser's brother to play Bortles. Yeah. Yeah. I know we say this every year, but next year we have to get everyone together. We're gonna do it. I I feel like we're gonna do it. We're gonna get you back outta Tahoe, Blake portals.


Yeah. I got dropped from that roster pretty quickly. Did you play out there Blake? I did. Day one was brutal. How awesome Is that? It was self fr Brutal day one. And then I Do, I was like shaking over my practice putts, dude. It's terrifying. And then day two, day two and th Oh, terrifying. The people lined up on, on the tee box. It's like, what, what are we doing guys? And then day two and three, I played a little bit better. But I, I, you know, I had no aspirations of winning. Yeah. It was, yeah. Strictly go out there and don't be lashed. Luckily Arod miles tell Were out there. I heard you saw a bear too, Dude. I was, I was 10 feet from a bear. Yeah. I, I look over and I hear something in the tree and I look over and this bear's just like bear hugging this tree and he is just look looking around it at me.


Yeah. And, and Max, I I was like, max, go get the bear. And then that woman was, was like, Hey, you probably shouldn't do that. Yeah. I went to Go over towards the bear and there was people working there and they were like, don't go near, don't go near that bear. Don't go near that bear. Very aggressive. Yeah. Apparently it was like a ma a mama bear with like three cubs and you don't want to get into Mama Bear's Way. No. That's how we feel about the Blakes. Yeah. Don't fuck with 'em. Yeah. I don't think Kep gets Who, who I don't think he's gonna join. No, I don't think he's gonna join. I think he's asleep. It is like 10:00 PM It Is late there. Yeah, It's 10:00 PM and he's got a golf round the next day. What were you gonna say? What was your, what was your best round Blake? I think I, I, I mean, I'm not good.


I think I shot a 84 day two maybe. That's pretty good Respectable with people watching out there. It's a lot. Having to make every putt Dude's how, how tough are like the two footers that everybody's normally like Yeah, you're good and you still gotta put those. Yeah, it was, they're terrible. One of the first times I played in 'em, my dad Cady for me the first day and after like the fourth time I missed an 18 inch put. He just stopped some, somebody had a crowd come carry this bag. Amazing. Blake, I caddied for Blake Griffin for like, probably four or five holes. And I got a new golf term for you that I'd never seen on the golf course. Blake Griffin shot a shot that went like, I don't know, a hundred feet into the woods.


And the guy we were playing with was like, that was the gr great shape of that shot. I don't even know what the fuck that means, but it was, it sounded nice. It was a terrible shot. It wasn't like a hundred yards in the feet in the woods. It was like 70, 70 80 tops. But it was great shape. It was pretty great Shape. Can you imagine the shape on that thing? I was like, I just turned him, I was like, what the fuck does that mean you? That was a bad Not, But yeah. Blake Griffin can, can fucking bomb the ball. I watched It. Blake. Blake, let's, let's get you back out to Tahoe next year and we'll do like a little, we should do a little Blake thing out there. Yeah, maybe That's we, we do Blake Of, The Year right before the tournament.


Yeah. Brooks probably make him, make him, make him Paris together at least one day. Oh yeah. Yeah. That would be incredible. Brooks has to play lefty. I think Brooks might still win. Yeah, Brooks probably is like, oh, I got a whole job. Probably I'm making like me. No, how about me and me and Bortles scramble. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Versus me and Pft And we play from like the forward tee. Yeah. Yeah. I think I that Yeah, you guys could, that that would definitely level it Out. And then between the two of you, it's whoever, whoever you take more shots from. Ooh. So then there's also competition between the two of you? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Got it. I like that. Oh good. That good? Alright, Cool. Is that Max?


Yeah, that was Max Dude, just dialing assassin over there. Can't see him, but yeah, he's In the booth. Great idea. Yeah, there he is Back Here.

Oh, and that's Blake Of. The Year Our favorite, our favorite Award that we give out. I Love it. I I, it broke my heart to see the look on Blake Bortel face. I know, but that was, he wanted it. That was a thrilling way to do it. You're never gonna say that Blake Bortles didn't wanna win this one. Yeah. Holy shit. That was, he was so Fast. Blake Griffin, what was the time on that? I would, I would estimate it to be under 10 seconds. Yeah, It was that fast. And I, I did now I did give him a three hour window. I was like, here's a three hour window, because they're busy guys. Yeah. But still, I mean, I do feel bad because Blake portal's, like he said, he'd been just sitting there for an hour waiting and still wasn't able to Do it. I mean, congrats.


It's, it's tough to beat greatness. Yeah. And what we're witnessing right now is greatness. Four time Blake Of The Year winner. All right. We have one last Award, PFT and we should just give it out ourselves. Okay. It's a podcast listeners of the year. Award pretty important. Award.

Should We do a drum roll? We can do a drum roll. Okay. Hugh, you want to announce the winner? He's gonna fuck this up. No, he says, oh, he said No. Smart. He says No memes. Do you wanna announce the winner Who won Podcast of the year? The listeners, the Award winning listeners of part of my take. A nine peak. A nine campaign.


9, 9, 9 9 9. Update those bios. Incredible run. You're Running out of fingers. Jason Pierre Paul. Can't count the amount of times that you've won a WLI thought This year was gonna be politicking for real Politicking next year. I'm, I'm looking in my rear view mirror if I'm the AWS right now. Yes. So thank you to the aws. We say it a million times, but I feel like I could say it every show, we live a dream life. We have the best job ever. And it's 'cause you guys listen to this show. Like, we wouldn't be able to do this. If you weren't as dedicated to us through ups and downs. Sometimes you hate us, sometimes you love us.


Most of the time you hate Hank Hank's not even here. That's Fine. That's Fine. To listen to you get the Award. Yeah. At the end of every episode, I say Love you guys. I truly mean that. I love you guys. Thank you so much. It means the world to Big, Cat me, Hank everybody in the booth we really, really sincerely appreciate because there's a bunch of podcasts out there. You don't have to listen to us. Yep. You've got other options and you choose to, and it means so much to us. So sincerely, thank you from the bottom of our hearts and we love you guys. And It, it's also one of those things that nine times, it's crazy looking back. 'cause I don't know, If, you feel the same way. It feels like we've been doing this podcast for like five minutes because I, I don't know, it's like, just time goes so fast when you're having, you know, the time of your life.


But If, you had told me PFT Hank, when we were sitting in your Austin apartment or house, excuse me, I don't want to say it was A house, it was a row house. It Was a row house. If, you told us when we were doing the test episode back in 2016 that we would have this type of success and we'd be doing it for nine years or eight years, but nine times for the take these. I'd be like, there's no fucking way. There's just, I mean, I, I think we're, we can do it, but I don't think that we're gonna reach these heights. We had that, I've told this story, we had that moment when we were driving from the Arizona Bowl back to Scottsdale. And we, like we, it was just two of us in the car and we're like, what would've happened if we didn't do this podcast?


And it was a scary, scary thought. It's crazy. I think it's, you know, probably the best, the best decision at least in terms of our work of our lives. Yeah. And, and it really is, like, it's freaky sometimes to think that there's so many people that listen to every episode. Yeah. I try not to think about that as we're recording, but when I do have a moment where I get to sit back and think about it, I, it makes me just very, very thankful for all you guys. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's like I said, you've got a choice and the fact that you choose us means a lot. You Yeah. It's, it's immense gratitude that I don't think we can act, we can't accurately convey it other than what we're saying right now. But like what we're saying right now is a very small part of the gratitude we feel.


So what do you guys in the booth, anything to for the Awls? Great year. Yeah, great year. I've only obviously been here for two. This is my second take here since I've been on. But every year I meet more and more of you guys and it's a great time every time I meet you. And I'm really grateful that you guys have given me this life and I truly, truly do love you guys. Like PFT always says Yeah, Memes. I took some time to reflect last week when you let me ask some questions. Aaron Rogers, I'm very appreciative of everybody on the show and all the people that listen, I was working in accounts receivable three years ago and that's crazy if my entire life changed.


So thank you to everybody who listens. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm obviously the newest one here. It's been a week. The people have been awesome. They've been really supportive and nice and they seem to be very, you know, very excited for the future and, you know, willing to hear out everything I got to say. And yeah. Yeah, they seem nice, great people. And really, I'm excited to work for them and work my ass off for them. Yeah. Yeah. It's the, we have the best fans in the world. It's not even close. I, I'll put our fans up against anyone else any day of the week. I know there's some other podcasts that have added some strong fan bases. Still would take the awls over them. Oh. And internet war.


Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. Especially since her next album's gonna stink. Yes, Exactly. She's too happy not naming names. She's Too happy. The thing about me and Big Cat is we're always upset. Yes. So there's always something to gripe about for people to identify with. Except actually now we might be entering phase two of part of my take where me and Big Cat have elite quarterbacks. Yeah, true. And you become real assholes. Actually, we, yeah. We might be going down the, the we're two happy. This might be when it, when it, when the whole podcast just submarines because everyone's like, we don't wanna listen to Winners all the time. Yep, yep. Yeah. So at least with Chiefs fans, when they listen to us and if they think that we're doubting Patrick Mahomes or their team, they can at least take solace in the fact that they win something. But if our teams win, yeah, then everyone else is gonna be like, fuck you guys.


But we sincerely thank you very, very much. Thank you for listening to the Take awards and we really love you guys. Yeah. So let's finish up with numbers. Okay, great. Take these boys.

No, I'm not. Alright. No, that's good. You and memes to combo.
