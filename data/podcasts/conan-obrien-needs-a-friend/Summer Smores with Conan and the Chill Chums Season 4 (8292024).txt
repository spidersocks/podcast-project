This is, I I, I like to think of this as the wrap up. Yeah. This is debrief. Yeah. This is, you know, after the event, the commentators stand around and they try and bring a sense of perspective Yeah. To what is happening wrong. It goes Through the plays. Yeah. Right, right. Is that what you're talking, like sports commentators? Sports or else like a political event. Oh, okay. You need people to be able to digest it, say a military Operation. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. This is what happened. This is how many casualties we took.


This is how there were three. Where did it go? There were three. Where did it go wrong? Yeah. First of all, I commend you Sona on having us over to your Thank you home. Lovely house. Thank you, And. it was nice to see in the window. Your little boys. Yeah. My godchildren. Yes. Waving at us out the window to their Uncle Coco. They Really love seeing you. Yeah. And then they saw Matt and Recoiled. Oh. Which I thought was weird. Yeah. As if they, and they said El Diablo, which is weird. That's, that's Spanish.

It's nice to see tack. Yeah. And your parents were there.


They were there. They're, they're watching, you know, helping watch the boys and stuff. Yeah. You only made a few Altadena jokes. We maybe, you know, we should encourage the fans to count them. Yeah. And if there's over a thousand, which I think there are. Yeah. Then you win Ra We're Giving a gift. A car. It's not, it's not a central. We own you. You have to go steal it. We'll point it out to you. But. it was very nice to be there. And I have to say very atmospheric. Yeah. One of the things that stands out to me the most, And Don, don't know how it's gonna sound on the podcast if you're gonna hear it through the mics, but those coyotes Yeah. That we're trapping an animal. That's one of the, the, I mean, I've heard that way off in the distance.


I think this was happening in your kitchen. You can, we heard it so Clearly you can't hear it. I've edited it already. Does it sound crazy? And It's, it sounds distant, but you can hear it. But the listeners should know that it was so much more intense in person. Even though I've, like, we've, we've done all we can to amplify it and make it sound as present as possible. It's nothing like the Real thing. No. It was crazy to be there. Borderline psychotic. Yeah. Because it sounded like they were maybe 35 feet away. Yeah. And madness. Do you, how often do you hear that? I would say several times a week. What are we Sure. It's just not like some Altadena cult, just some human cult members. And. I'm sorry. You think that they're human? What, What's going on up there?


Yeah. Oh. I think coyotes are killing little critters. Okay. What, what critters are they killing? Do we know? There's so many random things around, you know, like there's, you know, little things don don't know. Yeah. You're real good at identifying species. I love it. If Sona I know Animals. I don Dunno animals. I would love it if Sona had a nature show, I know animal. Wouldn't it be great if Sona had nature show I? don Dunno what animals.

Sometimes there's a little, a little dog will go out, sometimes a little cat, sometimes there's field mice. I think It felt bigger.


Like they had to take it down. Yeah. It felt like something, A big bunny or a raccoon or, Or something. It could've been a lot of bunnies, a lot of raccoons. Lot of, lot of shit. Andy Richter's been missing. Oh my God. Oh geez. Yeah. I told him to, yeah. I told him Andy, I told him to come visit us and he, he, they found his car, but they didn't find Andy. Aw. And they found one of his boots and they found a cruelly written note in Coyote that said Andy was D Delicious. Which should clear it up. Well, you know, In Coyote, by the way, I said in Our conversation, you mentioned that next year you would host us at your house. I will. Do you feel, still feel that, that Yeah.
