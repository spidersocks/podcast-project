Where are You? right? Now in this crazy world That we live in. Where are You? I am away from ou. Down in sa. Near in T. Tarica from Oto. Tahi. With is Christchurch New Zealand. Oh, Christchurch, New Zealand. Yeah. Okay. I've never been to New Zealand. And. Well. You should come. I I. Well, I. I. Maybe I would do. That someday. And, tell us a little bit about yourself. James So. What do You do for a living? Well, to pay The rent. I work at a D. The, probably The last DVD. Higher place in The country. If not The World. So. The name is Alice in Video Land. Even though there's No more videos, it's all DVDs. But. That's, It's called Alice in Video Land.


but You don't even sell videos. You sell DVDs. No. right. And. We don't. We just read. We still read them like we're Yeah You know. right. And is There. Next, next door to You. Is There a A shop That sells butter Churns. Well, Yes The I mean this is seen This alive. And Well in Christchurch. So. Yes. So. Wait. So You worked at A DVD rental shop. Yeah And. A lot of customers in And still. Even though So many things are streaming. Well, I mean Yeah. I wouldn't say a lot. But. We also haven two cinemas. With definitely helps keep The Place afloat. So. We've got like two small cinemas that You know people come out to And, then they can rent a Dwe D on their way out if they want. Oh, I. See? So So. There's a, there's an attached cinema.


Small. When You say small cinema, are we talking dirty movies? Like a little room with a couple of chairs? Why, does your mind go There? Well, I'm just curious because I might wanna go. Is not That familiar with The Internet? So still pieces. It's Probably one of those blocks away. Yeah. And. You're gonna go all The way to New Zealand. I. wanna go to one of those places where You, either You know t Little Yeah You know The. Little Peep show. Yeah. I. wanna see a peep show? I never got to see one of those. They shut 'em down. And. it was all online. I. wanna see a peep show? Well. Yeah. We don't haven that, but I guess. I could see What. I can arrange Well, What James. That would make You a pimp. So. No, I.


James, you Right don't. Don't start offering to arrange something. That's a mistake. Okay. So. Okay. James. Christchurch, New Zealand. And. You. Gateway to unt. Good. And. You. What. What. Did. you say to me just then, Gateway. Totax. Good. That's What. We know. Oh, GA. Gateway. Oh, You said it. So quickly didn't It. It was hard to hear. Yeah. You went. Gateway on. Ka And. I thought. The. That was The suburb. You lived in. Where do You live? It's a very distinct accent. The. New Zealand accent. Isn't It. Yes. I. guess So. I mean. You can tell me I'm surrounded by it. So. don. Don't really? It's like a fish in water.


I Can't hear. It. Doesn't. Doesn't Yes. I can hear your accent. I t know. You're like, isn't You your sound distinctive? Isn't The way You talk weird. Well know. Sorry. That's basically What. You're saying Well. can I think that I Amm speaking normally. And. You are saying So. Yeah. And. I. Think anyone in New Zealand would agree with me. Now, tell me about this. DVD. We are very people pleasing. So. Probably. Yeah. Oh, good. I like that. Tell me about The. DVD rental shop. You said. It's called Alice in In Video Land. Video Land. Yeah. Okay. It Was start. It started in The eighties. With is Why. It's video land. Yep. And. It's probably, It was literally one of The first.


And. It's probably The. Only one left hanging on. Now. And Yeah know we've just been in operation for longer than I've been alive. God bless You. Right. Keeping it alive. I. Love it. Yeah. Keeping It alive. do You. do You. We Haven All haven. The. James. Ones for You. Go. So. Ah, Yes. He's A fan. I'll be right. There in. I'll be right. Seven's. Casino Royale with You know or Welles. And. All of those. Oh, Yeah. That crazy one. Oh wow. So. I haven. A question. do You. do You run The store? No. I. Just like a duty manager. There's two owners. Karen And. Pete And. Then there's about four or five staff of With. I. Am one. Okay. So. It's just like a small operation. And. do you get along with your bosses?


I do. but You know there's, Peter certainly has opinions about things like We haven a wall of 500 greatest movies of all time. And. He is continually messing with That. And putting in things That. He likes maybe like What. Like What. Does he take out And? Put in Yeah. Well. Give us an example. You. Don't quite agree with your boss. Peter's taste in in films. What are some of The films. That. He reveres that. You're not So. Hi on Well. If I was to name them You probably wouldn't haven even heard of them. 'cause they're So obscure. And boring. So like Ray And. Liz is a British one.


And I. Don't wanna denigrate these filmmakers. It's just not my taste. A lot of The time. There's another one. Jean Doman. Wish. You might haven know because it, yeah, it tops The sight. And sound number one. It's like just three hours of a French lady peeling potatoes. Yes Yes And It. Well, I like The potato part to me that is pornography. Oh my God. I hate This. That's called Irish pornography. A woman peeling potatoes. I Can easily arrange that kind of peep show For You. Yeah. Yeah. That's The Peep show. I would go to You. Put a nickel in. There's a woman. There. Just You know. Just peeling potatoes can like So. Well, I'm sorry. That's my excited Face. Ha. Oh God.


For that scene every your Face you've made But. Apparently not. t Know I haven always haven. Another Face coming. So. Peter likes really obscure films. He's s your boss. And. You're probably as a younger person, maybe like more contemporary films. Is that correct? What. Is. He taken out of There. That's What. I. wanna hear? Yeah. What are The things. He takes down off The Wall Do The most recent. Well, I mean It was a real effort to even get him to get mad. Max Fury Road on There. He does not like that movie. Wish. How can You not like Mad Max Fury Road? It's a instant classic. I know. It's just, it's like pure action. but You know there's no I guess. 'cause it's pure action. And. There's nothing to ponder.


Like someone peeling potatoes is So. Oh God. Would he look thematic? He was a dork. Would he like What about some of The new They? don can be fired. But. Oh, Well. That's Okay. Please. I'm sure there's another DVD store right around The Corner job. Those things are a dime dozen. You said, that's Okay. Yeah. Don't worry about It. It's not my problem. I'm employed. Hi. I am a sociopath. So. James What about like The John Wick movies. Would Peter be okay with those? What's that? I'm not sure if he likes those there. They're not in The. Five hundreds. Everybody likes The. John Wick movies. I know there like Movies. John Wick used a horse to kill his enemies. Remember that when he put a blanket over The horse's head.


And to aim The horse's ass at his enemies. And then pulled And got It to kick. He used a horse as a weapon. It was fantastic. That's The greatest. Oh, No. Yes. You're right. I. do remember That. Now. Yeah. I was, how could You forget it? Sorry. because Did, you confuse it with The movie where Judy Garland used a horse to kill someone. Wow. Okay. So. Peter I haven. Major issues with Peter I haven to say Mm. Is this Like boss on Boss beef? Well, I I. Just think Peter is maybe herding. It's gonna What could be a very thriving DVD store.


Put The name video in The title I. Think he's hurting it with his obscure taste. And I. Think he needs to appeal to The masses. do You even haven Blu-Ray? Or is it just DVD? We do. But. New Zealand is like, we're still far. We never really properly made The transition over to Blu-Ray So. It's mainly DVDs with Do You haven. Any videos at All? We haven some decorative ones just past around You haven Decorative videos. Oh, I. Love It. Decorative videos. That's The. Only way they can be worth anything. You don. Okay. Tell me about The customers that come into this store. They are You You. know I. Hope none of my customers or my boss sees us. They will. It's fine.


They are older for sure. Yes. I, You. You didn't need to tell me. That. They've never heard of a computer. No. No like to sign up. People where You know haven to get their email. And. The. Amount of them who are like, don, don't I. Don't haven email. Wow. hate this. Alarming So. We do lose a few DVDs that way. 'cause we can just never find them. And. They disappear off The grid. Well, My guess is they die. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of That as Well. Yeah. It's really Someone. Someone signs out a DVD for The movie Flubber. And. Then they don't bring It back. And. You go by their apartment. And You. See them carrying them.


hate this. Carrying their store is how they find out. Most people die. Yeah Yeah was this DVD returned No. Oh God. Help them. Yeah, well track them down. And one of their children. Or Yeah. The. Police must must use You regularly as a source. Yeah. Who hasn't returned to DVD lately? Well, Mr Robinson hasn't on 3 0 3 Primrose Lane. Well, he's dead. Yeah. That's far more frequent.


Some trips are better in an Airbnb. It's just true. Like The trip. You wanna take with extended family. Where You wanna stay close. But not. I'll be sharing one bathroom. That's key for me. Okay. That's Why. Airbnb is The choice. I often wanna make or Or for example, The Couple's getaway, where you'd rather haven your own pool than share one with a bunch of strangers. Ugh. Oh. When I'm in a pool with strangers, I start shrieking. Okay. That's weird. Or that last minute. Local getaway. When You just really need to get outta The city for The weekend. But don't wanna deal with The Airport. You know I haven to say, I've used Airbnb a couple times. And. it always makes me feel like I'm at home even when I'm away. do You haven? That of That. I Do too. I mean I haven. You know I haven. Two small kids who are loud. And So. When I'm in a hotel, I feel a little uncomfortable. Well. you Right allowed too. Oh, Yes. Okay. Yeah. We're all allowed And. Then in a Airbnb. I, just feel much more comfortable Traveling. You're a self-conscious. No Yeah. And. Also, you're staying in someone's home. Yeah. It's got That vibe of comfort, relaxation, normalcy. Instead of some stuffy hotel with a Yeah. I. Don't wanna mint on my pillow. Hey bla You. Use Airbnb. Don't You I do I love It. And And I will say it. It there's Staying in in someone's place really does add a lot.


I'm a huge Stephen King fan. And The last. Airbnb I stayed in had this book from a Buick eight With is one of The few Stephen King books I haven't read. So I Actually. Started reading it in The Airbnb. Pronou And You. know What I do. Sometimes when I'm at an B I often travel with a picture of myself in frame. Oh boy. And I. Take it out. And I. Put it up.

I got as far as New Yeah. Yeah. New I. Don't need to read The rest. That must mean York. This is The script. You're writing it right? Now. This is great. This is fantastic. I. Love that. I'm very impatient. I haven. A D.


D. I didn't read Yeah. I didn't. After. I saw New I. Assumed The. Rest was York. But. it was Zealand. And. Instead of And. After. Three. You thought. You were spending three months on a boat. But. It was Actually. Six months. So. You're probably a little bit antsy by The. Time You arrived. Yeah And. I. And. I would notice That. It just was going south. And South. And South. Yeah. And. I was like, this is odd. Your round Cape Ho through this. Antarctic seas Hate this. How I understood. Antarctic. Okay. Yeah, Well. You. Guys say Antarctic. Don't You You. don. Like your All. right.
