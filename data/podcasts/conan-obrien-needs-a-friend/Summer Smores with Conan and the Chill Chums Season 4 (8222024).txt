You know, that's, sure. That's pretty Good. Sona. Just go a little slower. I did not understand a single Ingredient That you just mentioned Because you just keep, you just keep, you just keep guzzling it. You know why I think I like, It's a sipping drink. It's just little.

So how come you didn't go to camp? I think it was never offered to me. Okay. Okay. What your, your parents were never like, we wanna send you away. No. I think probably they, I bet I, I bet they knew they'd like, this kid's not gonna make it through camp. Aw. You know, Like, you'd miss your family too much. Yeah. 'cause here's why. Because When I, I think others would set on him. I think like Lord of the flight. When I was an adult In my twenties, I went to teach at an improv theater camp. And I called home the first day going, I want to come home. When you were in your twenties, Matt, you were in your Twenties. I get so homesick. It's ridiculous. Wait, you, you called home homesick. I called my girlfriend at the time going like, I wanted to come. I, I just don don't know.


I don't take to camp. Oh yeah. Okay. And this was in your twenties? And. it wasn't even camp. It was an improv class. Probably in an urban setting. It was Prison. Yeah. Wow. I loved camp. Really? I did. I loved, I had fun at camp. Yeah. Anyway, that's where I learned about Chubby Bunny when I was in twenties. Oh, teaching at camp when You were in twenties. Chubby Bunny. It wasn't a camp. It was not a camp that we went to. That's the sad part. I know. I was a counselor at camp once and my little cousin came. And, I lost him at the beach for like 45 minutes.


Where? What? I thought the ocean took him. I was really as both a counselor and as a family member, I was like, I really should bed Did. you say counselor first bed here. But wait a minute, what Did you do? Did. you start looking for him or Did you immediately, everybody Started looking for him. It became like a all hands-on, he was only seven And. it was an all hands on deck situation. I was like, guys, he was there. He's not there. I don't know where he is. And then everyone started Looking Not where at all. Do you know where you went wrong? How, why Did you take your eye off of him. What happened? don? Don't know. There were two kids I had to watch. They were both the youngest kids. You only had two. I Had two kids because they were like, they're the youngest.


They need attention. Especially if they're by the beach. So I turned my head away for a second to look at the other kid. And while I turned around, my cousin was gone. And, I always say that. I turned away for a second and when I turned back, but I know that. If we could go back and look at you, you started talking to some dude. Yeah. And, and doing that face you always used to do when you were single. Yeah. When you liked somebody. I'm not even gonna argue. Rolling Up a right. You, you'd make your eyes would get real bright. Yeah. Making a spliff. Rolling up a spliff. No, she used to do this face when she thought a waiter. Waiter was cute. What's the face? She would do this big and she would ask a lot of questions and she'd, her chin would be way up in the air and it's pretty good.


Yeah. And she would, yeah. You are always a couple drinks in at that point. Yeah. Where, where was the child? He was playing in the Sand, underneath a lifeguard tower. There were two areas. There was the area where everybody was And. then we all would go down to the beach. And there were just two areas. He wasn't in any of them. He was seven. I was like, but You just turned your head for a second. So how could he have gotten that car? Car? The ocean took him. I thought it, I thought the ocean took Him. But the ocean didn't take him. No, I But he, it, it could have. And then 'cause he was out in the sun for so long, he got heat stroke and then Oh. So no. So he was like a Disaster. What a great camp This was how Did you did Did. you have to have any, any qualifications.


No. We were like 17, 18 years old. We were kids in charge of other kids. You are. I had a flashback. I was a camp counselor in Dedham, Massachusetts at the Dedham Community Center. And I'm having a strong moment right now, because very recently I was with my brother Neil. And we were driving around and we were driving through Dham And. I realized, Hey, I think we're near where I used to be a camp counselor and we drove by the Dham Community Center. And so I, it's been years. I mean, it's been don don't know if it's been 45 years or something since I've been there. No, it's got quiet. Like you're telling us a ghost story. No I know, but I'm serious. I had this moment just now of thinking, oh, right.


I just did this. And I passed. And I looked at the place. And I remembered that the guy who ran the camp thought I was, I was a CIT you know, I was a counselor and I was in charge of like these eight year olds. And I. Remember the, this one guy that ran the camp was like, you're pretty funny. You're pretty funny. And then I remembered one year he said, I want you, I got this funny, it's the 4th of July. You're a funny guy. You just always make people laugh. I have a, an Uncle Sam costume I bought, put it on and I'll have you perform for all the kids. And I'm not, I wasn't thinking I was, you know, I don know what I was.


I was 16, 17 and someone's telling me to do this. So I, I was reluctant. but I put on this Uncle Sam costume and he had assembled all the kids in Camp And I came out. And I was like, Hey everybody, I'm Uncle Sam And. I bombed. Like you cannot imagine. No I can, I can easily And I dressed as Uncle Sam. And I'm in this, I'll never forget, I'm in this like, standing next to this big dead lawn in Dedham, right near the courthouse where Soko and TTI were tried. And I'm dressed as Uncle Sam and a shitty Uncle Sam costume that probably cost $2. And the beard's coming off the kids.


I had not, I had put no thought into it. 'cause the counselor just thought you're funny. So go be funny. And. it was a disaster. Conan. Two things. This is first why I never went to camp. Something like that. It's a war crime two. Do you realize you have two Uncle Sam I know sad stories. I know. Remember we covered this and we got that Halloween costume your Mom bought I know my mom got me that co that Uncle Sam costume I know. And yet I, America has Done Me wrong. Wait, no, but I love my country. but I I do. That was the sec. And also, what was he thinking? That a guy with no preparation, who's 16 years old, who's, yeah, he's kind of funny. Can just put on an Uncle Sam costume impromptu and got up in front of a bunch of kids at a low rent day camp and make them laugh.


And you knew you bombed. 'cause even sometimes at that age, you talk yourself into thinking like, oh, well that was fun. I gotta perform. Oh no. Oh no. I'm, I'm quite aware when something I've done has not worked. And this was an absolute bomb. And I remembered. Even the guy was like, what the fuck was that? And I'm like, you Just told me you found like he paid you. Yeah. Like he hired you. Yeah. You, you double as like a cab driver. When you're not running this decrepit camp, you're a cab driver. You found this costume in a trunk. You made me wear it. Which is, you know. Yeah. So I did And. it was awful. And I just was there. Oh my God. And now here I am in Altadena drinking a chocolate whistle pig whiskey drink.

And I'm And I have like all these delicacies and things up in my room. Isn't that kind of a funny idea? No, I think the better idea is we do it at your house. It's the three of us. But you're in an Uncle Sam costume. Oh no. Can I also say, listen, I'm being very serious. When we go to your house, can we go to where, you know, famous people live and can we knock on the door and say, Hey, my pillow flew over in your yard. Can I go grab it? Because there's so many famous people that live near you. Yeah. So I just wanna make sure it's full.


The Level of security they had when you went to get, when you retrieve the pillow, it would be riddled with bullet holes. The minute a pillow blows into one of those yards, it's immediately set upon by dogs and then shot. So yeah. don don't know. Isn't It sad that this is, we gotta wrap this up. I actually, I I don. I just started. I'm having Fun. Me too. I just started having fun. That's, that's called alcohol I. don I know. Why did we wait till this late? Why? I think you're right.

We don't know what they found. And nurture. Come on, we'll take a break. We'll be right. No, sometimes if you say something like that, if people aren't really thinking, people think you said something profound.

But what we do know is that real friendships last. Whether you're gathered in Altadena or Pasadena or a place that's sort of closer to civilization, as long as you have a good drink and good friends, good memories of having to wear an Uncle Sam costume, God entertaining an entire camp with no preparation and totally bombing.
