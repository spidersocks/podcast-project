Oh, can you hear by my, by my speech? I am not good at picking out various accents. Accents, so I wouldn't be able to listen to you and say, oh, that's an Amsterdam accent. Oh yeah. Yeah. But I do, I was in Amsterdam many years ago shooting a project and it was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. The architecture, the people. I was just stunned. And you had good weather. I, I assume otherwise you probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.


What makes you think I don't like bad weather. I like rainy weather. I like foggy Weather. I feel like your, your hair would get a little Upset with bad weather. Oh yes. My hair absorbs moisture and then it gets even bigger. Okay. So, but okay. Nice enough about me, Micah. Yes. It's very nice talking to you.

I started when I was 13 and I'm 30 now, which is, I wanna say old within this industry. Really? So for a very long time. Well, and it used to be normal to be 13 and, and start modeling. Right. Which now doesn't happen anymore. Oh, They don't do that. They, they make sure that people start a little later on. Yes. They're rules now. I think. I think that's, that's probably, that's probably good. Well, I will pay you an obvious compliment that just on zoom.

Yeah. Or I can retire then I would say paint over that natural wood. It's time. Oh yeah, yeah. No, it's just time to change it up a little bit. When you hit 90, just a nice thick coat of pink Micah fashion model.


Where have you modeled all around the world? Have you traveled a lot? Have you traveled to the great cities to model? Yes. Yes. I used to live in New York for six or seven years.

I think yes. I think also nowadays, You know, there's more diversity within age. I think you would be perfect. And you've compared yourself to Tilda Swinton, which I think is the most gorgeous human on this world. Well, I, which one? Me? Or told us when?


Think about it. Think about how long you want this, this interview to go on for. It's a Language barrier. Very nice. Micah. Micah, you should, you should become a diplomat. You should work for the United Nations. It was very well done. Thank you. That's What I'll do when I'm 90. I I am, I'm very Long In The Leg. I think that's helpful when you're a, a model. My legs are very, very long. Beautiful. Yes. I think it would be perfect. Beautiful long legs. Like beautiful. I don't know who sit it. How, how do you find your, how do you, where do you find your jeans or your, your pants? Or do you have someone that elongate Your pants? No, I am able to, it's hard for me to get them off the rack. They have to be quite long. My, very long, I'm just gonna say sensual the legs.


No, no. You eat your legs. Did I say that or did you? Your legs are sensual. Well, they, they're, how do you, how is That Mean? Meaning my legs have senses and they enjoy food. Oh, okay.

We hope that you're welcome.


Micah, I have to ask you a question 'cause it's something that I'm naturally curious about. You are a very stunning person. And what's it like when you're walking around? I'm just, I'm just imagining that guys would bother you all the time. No. And that would be annoying. They don't, they don't. No. At this point, I'm almost, I don't wanna say insulted because I don't wanna be bothered. But also, yes. No, I don't get, I don't get stopped at all. Do you think it's because they're intimidated? No. I don't know. I think it's, I mean, you're six feet tall and you look like a supermodel, I think. And I think it would be very, it's a very confident man, I would think that would walk up to Micah and say, hi, do you wanna go get a burrito sometime?


That was my opening. That was the Burrito. That's great. You're not taking her to like a nice restaurant. This was a line that I tried. You were thinking Of a long food. His legs gotta eat tall Food. Yeah. A man's legs gotta eat. Sona, a man's legs gotta Eat six feet, four burrito. I, I, I just, I would, no, They don't Really. Okay. I think it's intimidation. I think they would think There's no way that Mike is, I don know. I mean, I, that's what I tell myself to fall asleep. I'm not sure. I think so. I also, also, your producer told me you have a resting bitch face. I think I might have the same thing. Oh, You think I have a resting bitch face? Oh, Sorry. Yeah. No, I didn't.

One of the hardest parts about B2B marketing is reaching the right audience. You put so much effort into a campaign only for it to get wasted on the wrong people. I know, like I'm trying to sell my coal miners hat and it goes to a dance troupe. Ugh, that's no good. It's just stupid. That's where LinkedIn ads come in. Fortunately, LinkedIn is a network of over 1,000,000,001. You can't even count that high. I can't, I can't either. Link as a network of over 1 billion businessy people who might actually be interested in your business. You can even target your buyers by job title, industry, company roles, seniority skills, company revenues. Didn't I say job title? I think I did. Mm, just stop wasting budget on the wrong audience. That's just stupid. Start targeting the right professionals with LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn will give you a $100 credit on the next campaign, so you can try it yourself. Just go to LinkedIn dot com slash Team Coco. That's LinkedIn dot com slash Team. Coco trips and conditions apply only on LinkedIn ads.

I think you sounds weird to you, but I, it's Europe, so I, You know, things can get weird. I think the language barrier might be coming over. Does, does Robert speak English? Yes, he does. Ah, but he hasn't listened to you guys' podcasts. Oh, he hasn't. And I'm quite disappointed He won't listen. He, he, he hasn't, or he refuses to listen. You can be honest now. It's okay. This is a safe space. Are you sure? Well, oh no, I'm not. And it's not really a safe space. It never has been. I'll take the risk. Yeah. Take the risk For up until now.


He, he, he won't. But maybe He Won't. I think he can be convinced He won't. So He won't, He won't. He's defiantly saying, I will not listen to that podcast. Podcast. It's a choice. Yes. Yes. An active choice. It's a choice. Wow. Well, is it Because of Conan or because of one of us? Well, it's not because of you guys. Oh. It's 'cause he doesn't know who we Are. Wait, You know, Conan doesn't know who I'm talking to again. It's okay. It's quite clear. You know what I Micah I am a mature adult and I can handle it. Someone is not a fan of mine and I'm deducing No, I know. You take it as a challenge, You know. No, I do not. I I like this guy Robert.


He clearly has excellent taste in, in, in, in choosing you. And so I respect his opinion and I deduc that he is not a fan of my kind of comedy. Is that, is that the case? You can just say yes or no. I declare a fifth. Yeah. Well, I didn't realize you guys had the I don American Constitution. You can't use, you can't use our constitution. You're in Amsterdam and you didn't mean anything. Keep your fucking hands off our constitution. We barely can keep it under control here in America. And suddenly, oh, I know what the problem is. You guys have it. I know why our system's breaking down our constitution's in Amsterdam.


Micah, he's not a fan. Just say it. It's okay. He's Not a fan. I'm so sorry he's not the time. But I feel bad because I think you're you're so nice. Nice. I, I sincerely think, Oh, I mean, I am nice, but I, I consider myself a great comedic talent. Now what is it? He's, Oh, okay. Sorry, sorry. It's not about personality. It's about your talent. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So what are we left with? What is it? I'm gonna, I shouldn't, but I'm gonna dig deeper. What is it about my comedy that Robert does not enjoy? You can just say it's goofy. Can you let her answer the question? Please? You're leading the, I'm sorry. Exaggerating. Maybe Gimme a multiple choice.


Answer. It's, I'd like to get to the truth. I really would like to get to the truth. No. Okay. I'll be completely honest with you. I have discussed it today as well because, You know, it's, You know, You know, you'd be talking to me and this is a big night. Why, Why do I want to meet? You know? Yeah. He just thinks it's too much. It's too much. I'm a little much You're Trying too Much. Trying too much. Yeah. He likes probably more of like a quiet, He likes more naugh. Naughty. I I asked him the word he said naughty. Naughty. He likes naughty. But I think you're super respectful and I think that's where, You know, but I think what he's saying is he thinks that maybe I'm too hyper at times.


The, my energy is too much. Maybe a neediness comes across and he probably likes a, a quieter kind of jacquetta kind of comedy. What I think If you take this attitude, he will be perfect. Yeah. He likes just Keep it This, something like this, which is quiet. This is nice and more relaxed and much less funny. This is, this is What is, this is not funny at All. He just likes non funny comedy. Yeah. I think the problems with Robert, that's what I'm getting. I think so too. I mean, for the rest, he's great. This is just something we don't bond over. Yeah. Well listen, and To be honest, I put up an Instagram post for like, friends, like asking like who have, who?


My friends is listening to Conan O'Brien, You know, needs a friend and no one replied. Yeah. Oh, wow. But maybe I don't have many friends. I mean, The case. But this is, this is, but I'm, I'm sorry, mic. Can I, can I tell you what's happened from my perspective? Micah? Micah. Lemme tell you what's happened from my perspective, I Just think you need better PR in the Netherlands. That's just what I think. Oh no. Maybe you're not reaching beyond, You know, you need to. I don I think I've been lured into a trap by a very beautiful woman. This is how it feels like to me that there's this extraordinarily beautiful professional model named Micah who's charming and, and lovely.


And she's a fan of mine and she's talking to me. And the whole time she's leading me down an alley. And when we get to the end of the alley, she tells me my boyfriend loathes you, my friend. It's like a honey trap for your humility. Yeah. My friends have never heard of you. And everyone I know, You know, same. Everyone I know finds you disgusting and loathsome. You're like the creature. No, you're putting words in my mouth. You're, You're like the creature at the end of the substance. That's true. That's a compliment. And you, you tricked me. You tricked me. You said la la la. You asked me this Question. Let's get on this Amsterdam bicycle built for two and take a nice ride. Oh no. What's happening?


Oh no. Let's, poor Conan, Let's throw you in a canal. Yes, But I'm, But I'm talking to you. Is that not, is that not enough for you? No. Okay. Now you hurt my feelings. You're, I love talk. No, you did. I love you did. No, no, I did not. I did not. Yeah, you did. I did not. Micah, I know your feelings better, but Don't you very direct. You should know that You, I I can take it. I can take it. I'm not for everyone. I understand that. And I That's okay. I do, You know, I paint what I see. I am who I am as Popeye said, a great Nordic figure.


And, and I mean, you're hosting the Oscars, like you're fi you're fine. Yeah. You're fine with that, Robert. Oh yeah. That's a, no one judges anyone in that job. That's gonna be all of Amsterdam saying sucked. We don't even watch worse. Nice. I'm kidding. I'm so sorry. I'm kidding. I'm, I'm so sorry. Why? Why? Hey, listen, I'm not Joe Oscar either. You know, I'm, You know, I was, take it easy. I don't work for the academy. You know, it's a job. I'm getting 200 bucks. I'll do it. Congrats Micah. I do think, how would I win over Robert? I know this is insane because I've won you over and that should be enough for me.


Because again, you're extraordinary. There's a light coming off of you. You're a Renaissance painting, yet still, I'm, I'm obsessive compulsive about Now Robert is gonna be the one I wake up thinking about and his disapproving face glaring at me. Yeah. Three inches below my own face. Send three inches below My own face. You're taller than him. You feel good about that Somehow? It doesn't. No. Well, It doesn't help. It doesn't help now. No. Yeah. I'm taller than Brad Pitt. That doesn't help, You know. Oh, yeah. No, I can see. I see. Stronger than him too. I fought him twice. Once I won once. No, you're not stronger than him. What's that? You're not stronger than Brad Pitt. I am stronger than Brad Pitt.


No, you're not. If I fought Brad Pitt, I would win. No, he would be you. No, he would call a bunch of people. Get in here at security. Help me. That's how he talks to too. What what's Your fighting style? Be Mine Running Away. Yeah. No. My, my hands become like hoses. They're just, they're like whips. They whip. It's a whipping motion. Yeah. You got me off track. It's more like a slapping. It's a slapping. I'm a slap fighter. I slap, I pinch and I bite. I get on the floor. That's good. I get my back on the floor so I'm protected and I kick and i's and I scratch. That's where you pull someone over you, right? No, I don't do that. That would hurt my back. Oh, Micah. Oh, I'm sorry. You and I have a strange chemistry and yet I've never been more in love.


And I say that knowing I've been happily married now Yeah. For quite a long time. Yes. But that marriage is over. I think it's you and I now.

What are you gonna Do to Robert? I'm gonna overwhelm him, him with my high energy comedy. I'm gonna be so energetic and he's gonna be so put off by it that he's gonna run away.
