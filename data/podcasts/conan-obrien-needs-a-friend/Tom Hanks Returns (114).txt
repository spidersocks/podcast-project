My name is Tom Hanks. And I. Feel blank about being Conan O Obama.

1:
You feel blank.

3:
I love it. You don't even like give hint words. Could you just put adjective in there in parentheses or something like that?

1:
What's wrong with that?

3:
I feel blessed to, to be Conan O'Brien's friend. I feel old

4:
Fall here. Back to school. Ring Bell shoes. Walking. loose the fence.

1:
Hey there. Welcome to Conan O'Brien needs a friend. I am, of course, the aforementioned Conan O'Brien famed in song and story. I just threw that in. So, Ian, can I have you here? Yeah, it's good. It's good to hear. Great. You know what, I know what? I love the burst of energy you supply. I can't ever, it pushes us. Yes, it's good. That's And Matt Gorley. Nice to see you too. That's good. Okay. You're clearly on life support. Like someone they've decided just double up on the morphine and get 'em out. Take you down. Let's slide 'em out of this realm. I come from Boston, Massachusetts. I've made that clear many times. What? And Boston from the second you're born. It's all about your sports team. Mm. You know, and you're assigned your sport teams at birth in Boston.

1:
You. Don't get to decide them Now. Eduardo I know in different, like I've, I've talked to people like with soccer, who their father might root for one team, but their son roots for a different team. That's

5:
Exactly my case.

1:
Yes. Right. Wow. That's not the case in Boston. In Boston. It's all the minute you're born, they like brand. Your forehead, hockey, Bruin, you know, baseball, red Sox, basketball Celtics. Mm. Football patriots. I mean, it's just like across the board. Celtic, these are your teams. And it's not open for discussion, which is fine. I accept that. Here's the thing. I've been living in LA for a long time. And, I feel disconnected. Oh

6:
Wait. Because you can't, you can't switch even if you

1:
Move. No, no. I would never, I can't switch. Those are my teams. Sure. You can. Or Boston teams just switch you. You, you, you can't switch. You can't switch. That is just, you can, no, can't. It's just sports. No, no, you can't because I'm from You don't understand. I'm from Boston and you can't switch. And anyone who's from the Boston area will understand that. That's just the way it is. Those are my teams for life. But I'm here in Los Angeles and my team's out of it right now is baseball. And, I. Don't know what the etiquette is. I would like to be part oh, or take part in the Los Angeles sports scene. So you're

6:
Saying you can, even if your team's out of it, you can't do a substitute second favorite team. You're not even allowed.

1:
It doesn't feel right to me. I think because your Boston, it doesn't, Eduardo Eduardo's AG understands Eduardo

5:
Speak. You can't, you can't that that's like kind of front runner ish. If you're Yeah, yeah. You know. Yeah.

1:
You're in,

2:
You could root against the Yankees. That's what you should be doing.

1:
No, no, no, no. That's okay. But rooting against the Yankees. You can't participate in I can't go to a, I can't go to a Dodgers game and be shouting Yankees suck if they're not even playing the Dodgers.

6:
Right. Con you're in an abusive relationship.

2:
I know. This is, this

1:
Is ridiculous. No, what I'm saying is I actively want to, what's the thing you were telling me about Eduardo? Where there's a falcon?

5:
Oh, I, yeah,

1:
Tell me about this.

5:
This is for the LA Football Club. Los Angeles Football Club. Which is part of the MLS. Yeah. It's our home team here in la. Are you

1:
You, you mean soccer? Soccer. Oh. So let's call it soccer, please. One of two. Yeah.

5:
One of two teams. Yeah. But although the Galaxy plays in Carson, which

1:
Let's just call it soccer. Sorry, we just

2:
Wanna piss people off.

5:
Yeah, exactly. It's scary. So they have an opening ceremony. Every game where they have their, their mascot is like a falcon. This

1:
Is the coolest thing I've ever heard of. In case keep going.

5:
It's, it's really cool. And they have a, an honorary falconer. Is it Falconer? Is that the person that usually

1:
Falcon. Isa.

5:
There you go. Falcon Isa. That's kind of kicks off the whole game. And there's a falcon that starts on your arm and gets released and then comes back to your arm. And. it says like this whole hoop law thing. And I think. And oftentimes there's notable figures who are invited to be that person. I think Conner would make the perfect

1:
Wait. Do you think they would let me do it?

5:
Absolutely. What,

1:
What kind of, what notable figures are we talking? Am I in their league? I mean, if it's a bunch of a-listers, And I wouldn't be in their league. That's just teasing me. And that's mean.

5:
So like somebody like Elizabeth Banks. Oh,

1:
I know Elizabeth Banks. Yeah. She's

5:
Been called upon to do it. There's, I

1:
Wait, so I would be in the middle of a stadium. And. I would hold on my arm and a Falcon would come and land on it. Exactly. See, I just, here's the thing. Maybe soccer is okay because I don't, I don't really, you know, Boston Soccer, to be fair,

5:
Like the New England Revolution, which would, was technically the team that you should have been rooting for. They didn't exist by the time you moved over here.

1:
So. Right. That's why I don't think so. Maybe I'm allowed to get involved in soccer. Yes. but I feel funny, you know, rooting I I for any LA team, because I feel like, oh, that's gonna get back to Boston. And the next time I land at Logan, they're gonna be three guys that are with pipes. Right. And it's gonna work me over. I

2:
Don't think, I think it's a problem if you root for the Lakers. 'cause there's a very, can't do that notable. Like, if you can't do that, if you go to Boston with a Laker hat, oh my God, I, can I please be there for that'll punch? You know, it would be, they would brutally be you.

6:
Are you allowed to watch a movie without Mark Wahlberg in it?

1:
It's, you know, it's interesting. You have to get it clearance. Okay. You have to get clearance first. So

6:
That's essentially what you're doing now. You're kind of asking forgiveness before

1:
It happens. I'm trying, there's so many rules when you're from Boston, if you get coffee, it has to be dunking. And if you're seen not having dunking again, guys with pipes work you over

6:
God. You're living in the Soviet

5:
Union.

1:
I know

2:
What is this?

1:
Yeah. It's

2:
Why not Boston? Yeah.

1:
It's like the Soviet Union. But it's where it's guys are wearing a lot of acid wash and Boston caps sideways. They, they listen to that jump around rap song over and over and over again.

2:
But wouldn't you just wanna go watch a baseball game? Can't you just go to a Dodger game?

1:
It's really tricky. You can

2:
Wear your Boston Red Sox hat. Oh,

1:
That's interesting. It's good point. It's weird. See, Eduardo understands why not?

5:
You also can't do that. Why? If your team's not playing in the game, you, you don't wanna be that guy. That's where, or girl. That's

1:
Girl. Yeah. What are you doing that for?

2:
Notably from Boston. They

1:
Won't. That's like going to, that's like going to Temple for someone's, you know, bar mitzvah and I'm wearing a quinceanera tiara. Exactly. And I'm like, it's just my quinceanera

2:
Tiara.

1:
Why

6:
Not wear a quinceanera tiara to the Dodge

1:
That I could do? Okay. but I want it known. I want it announced to the world that I'm going And I just love to watch baseball live. But my heart is with the Red Sox and that's why I'm wearing a tiara. Or is it Tiara? I guess in Boston it would be ati. Okay. Yeah. But. anyway, I Maybe

5:
You could stretch it. For instance, Mookie Bets longtime Red Sox

1:
One. No, he left. Right.

5:
There's some fans who would be like, well, I still love Mookie. And he plays for the Dodgers

1:
Now. So that's doesn't work. No. You can't

2:
Love him once they leave.

1:
Yeah.

6:
This is insane. Listen to

2:
You people. I don, leave him.

1:
You oj great football player. I mean, they go support him and it's trial. It doesn't work that way.

6:
This is insane. I can, I'm so happy that I'm not a sports person because I don't have to.

1:
I like that you're just saying sports person. I'm glad I don't indulge in this folder. Roll of sports is

6:
True. My dad was a big sports person and he took me to all these USC games. And as soon as we get there, I would turn around, get on my knees and play with my GI Joe's with my back to the game the entire time. My God and my dad had his head in his hands.

1:
You know what's funny? Fucking

2:
Loser.

1:
You know what I imagine? USC

2:
Games?

1:
Yeah. Duh. I imagine you're, I imagine Goly going, I just imagine Goly going to a gym. And. It's all equipment that you've seen in the Titanic. It's like from 1911. It, it's wooden pins that he throws around and everyone's gotta have a mustache.

6:
I do like soccer though, quite a bit.

1:
Yeah. And don't call it fba. I won't, we're not having that bullshit. Should all go to a game. We should hook

6:
A a should you do the Falcon thing and we get a box and we hang out and Well, Pharaoh's a part owner. Isn't he your homie or something like

2:
That. Yeah.

1:
He's my homie. I'm try. He hasn't returned my calls in years. And every time I call a Falcon answers

6:
Go go.

1:
I just want to talk to Will. No, no. He's moved on. Moved on.

2:
I. do think it's okay if you wear Boston hat to a Dodge game? Nope. It's, you guys are making shit up. I've seen people wear hats from other teams.

1:
Yeah. It's not, I don't care what you've seen other people do. Especially Oh, flying face of it. See, everyone

2:
Knows you're from Boston I. know what

1:
Are you, I've seen other people throw up on a cab. No, I, that doesn't make it cool. I'm not gonna do it. Okay.

2:
Not gonna happen. Just don't go to, I went to a Game five recently against the Padres. That shit was fun. Okay. I

6:
Turned my back on the USC Trojans at three years old. Oh, you dick,

1:
You'd probably do that now. Those games are, you know what I love is you now going to a game and turning your back and getting out your little Dungeons and Dragons figures and laying them out. I hope people beating you. I hope you are beaten. I hope you are

2:
So badly beaten

1:
Off. Badly beaten. We go to the You are sports people and you know what, you're

6:
Assholes. Yeah.

1:
Yeah. We, we'll, you And it so much so that when we first visit you in the hospital, we're not allowed to see you. 'cause you're still being stabilized there. That's not a mean thing to say at all. What a specific, I hope you're beaten so badly that on our first visit we're not allowed to see you. I turned

6:
My back on you.

1:
Oh yeah. So specific. Oh wow. Oh look, Jesus Fact turned on us. He's, he's,

2:
Hey nerd. Stop playing with your gi I, Joe Toys. You'll get

6:
Yours, lady.

Now you can see him in the new movie here, which is currently in theaters. He's a scholar, he's a gentleman. He's, he's one of the great people of all time. Tom Hanks welcome.

3:
Remember this, this, this thing, this thing in show business happened where no one, this thing of ours, this thing of ours when you didn't have to drive to a studio and work with the segment producer and put, you have your hair, have your bald spot covered and you know, wear free clothes that you know Zenya is giving you. And then you had to go, and then you didn't have to do that anymore. 'cause you do a podcast from your house with a decent microphone. Yep. And now we're back on tv. Yeah. Yeah. Well without Silas. I appreciate that. I agree.

1:
We keep talking about this, how I started this five years ago. 'cause Adam said, do a podcast. And I said, why would I do a podcast when I've been on TV for 30 years? Hmm. We start doing it as a joke. As

3:
A joke.

1:
It becomes big. Then they start to say, is it okay if we put cameras in there? And I said, fine. And then they said, is it okay if we occasionally do five a year in front of a live audience in, in big theaters? 'cause people like it. And I said, okay. And then they said, is it okay if we add a band? They said,

3:
You fuckers we're right back. And listen, we're gonna need a warmup comic. Yeah.

1:
It's going on NBC. Yeah. It's gonna be on NBC at 1235.

3:

1:
Give you a ride home. I know where you live.

3:
I got Hey, by. Yeah. By the way, you have you, you've been to Conan's house? Yes. We have competitions in the neighborhood. Who has the longest house. Oh, you mean as you're driving up the street, which, which house takes the longest to drive past the start of the property line and the end of the property line.

1:
And you guys each think it's your own.

3:
I think you've got like two and a half miles of property line I. do you

1:
Do a Cessna can land and a Cessna has land

3:
On my property now. It used to, it used to be, you know, Jerry Lewis used to live on, on the block. Did he really? Yes. Yeah. Wow. I won't say I won't. Are we on yet? So I won't say what the address is, but at, at one point we were at, because I saw this old thing. And I ran. Yeah. You meet Jerry Lewis and you think, first of all, that's a surreal experience. Yeah. All into it. Hey Tom, you know, my god, Jerry knows my name. You know, isn't that crazy? I saw the bosom buds, you know, and, And why can't we use that? You can go ahead. Go ahead. We're using it. Okay. And I said, is it true or not? Did, you live in our neighborhood. And he said, ma, the number of the, of the number of the house, and it's a, it's a brick, a white, red brick White House And.

3:
it is almost as long as yours is And I. Just think, 'cause I saw this. I, you know, he was really into like, making home movies and stuff like that. And he used to do kooky things. And I saw this one thing. Tony Curtis and Janet Lee drove up and did kooky things on their lawn as they were coming into a party at his house. So he would, would How's that for a neighborhood? He would that he

1:
Would make films. Yeah, he would make films. I mean, start going back to like the early fifties. He would make films with all of his friends. That's right. And but I didn't realize he lived in our neighborhood.

3:
Right there. Right there. And, you know, he had a radio station and he had a, I think he had restaurants and stuff. He had a podcast for a while.

1:
A true sign. Very,

3:
Very early version.

1:
A true sign. And it over.

3:
We were, I was out once. And by the way, you, you find this thing, I, maybe I was at a, I was at like a, a thing. They were showing one of his movies and we all kinda like, went in order to vet him, you know, celebrate him a little bit. And someone, someone got up, he had a question and answered. And somebody asked him about the video tap the world famous video tap. 'cause he was directing movie. He was the first guy, one of the first guys to star in and direct his own movies. And he had to have a video tap, meaning that it, he was the first guy to put a, a TV monitor matching what the camera saw. So there was a cable coming from the camera. Camera and ran into a tv. Everybody thought this is amazing. He said it was. but I didn't tape. What? What do you mean? Well, I had no playback. I just had to look when I was doing And.

3:
I the thing with the stuff And, it looks good and now let's do it. But then I do it. And I couldn't see it until

1:
The Daily Up.

3:
And I said actually, now, if he had invented videotape that well, he would've gotten the Nobel Prize along with everything else. He would've, he would've got it all. Jerry Lou. How did we get talking about Jerry Lewis?

1:
You just, what do you mean? How did we You Yeah. You,

3:
You, because it's the neighborhood.

1:
Yes. We live in this neighborhood. And I. Take a hike. I sometimes go buy your property. Right. I've thought about there's a, there's a wall.

3:
Yes.

1:
I think I could get over that wall.

3:
You know, I, you know what you are too. You could so tall. You could might be able to crawl through the razor wire if you know how to, how to do that.

1:
I, you scared the hell outta me. I was on a bike with a friend of mine. That's right. Won't get into the exact con, but on a, taking a bike ride with a good friend of mine, Brad. And we're going up this pit. Yeah. Maybe. And Brad Paisley suddenly this, this car, like a kind of a Jeep SUV thing starts coming and all of a sudden the, the window comes down. Yeah. And you lean out the window and start yelling at

3:
Me. I did

1:
A yelled at you and you start doing some bit. I was a bit, which was really funny. Doing a bit. And then my friend is like, that was Thomas.

3:
It happens all the

1:
Time. but you know what it was like laughing. Like your head just came outta a Yeah.

3:
Knock, knock.

1:
Yeah. Or it was like Batman when he was climbing up the side of a building and suddenly a window would open and it's, it's, you know, it's Jerry Lewis. It's Jerry Lewis, it's Tom Hanks. I thought I live the most amazing life where at a, a darkened window can come down and a goofy Tom Hanks can pop out and yell at me when I'm on a bike. But think about

3:
Everybody else. 'cause on that, there's a lot of people that come there to, to walk that, that you, it's a long line. And they're all kind of like bicycle weenie geeks. You know, guys with $6,000 mountain bikes and on your left, you know, as they're, as they're going up and coming down. But they're gonna see you. I mean, you're as tall as Big Bird for crying out loud I know. And they're gonna say, I believe I saw Conan O'Brien struggling up the hill.

1:
Have you heard that? Halfway up that ridge, there's this place that apparently in the late thirties, you probably know about this. Right?

3:
Absolutely true.

1:
In the late thirties, some people who were pro Hitler and pro what the Nazis were doing. So Nazis. Yeah.

3:
Okay, go ahead.

1:
They,

3:
As a lay historian, I'll come in and get the record straight. Okay. When the time they were members of

1:
The party, they, what? There were people who were sym sympathetic to that cause in the late thirties before America was in the war and they purchased a piece of land. Am I correct? You are

3:
Correct, sir.

1:
That they, that they thought that they thought would be a place that the furor would like to hang when and if he comes to America, maybe because he conquered it. I don't know the whole story. Do you know the story?

3:
It was owned by the German bo and there was a period of time a German boon. The boon was essentially, Hey, we're all Germans. We all live America. Let's form a fraternal organizations like other nationalities do. Yeah. You know, and be, be, I'm gonna hope that was before, before they found out just how bad Hitler was. Yeah. You know, but there, there, I swear I have seen photographs of like a 4th of July in the 1930s up there with a fireworks thing. And they would have no lie a picture of the founding fathers and a picture of Adolf Hitler. Yeah. An American flag and a Nazi flag. The German Nazi flag.

3:
And they were saying, our country is coming back, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. And I. Just hope that maybe you can get away with that in 1930, you know, But it continued along. And in fact, it is now a scout camp, or it had been for a while. And I have gone there to scout a location and there was like the main lodge. You know, there's tents and stuff like that. But there is a main lodge that honestly looks like, you know, a German alpine chalet. Yeah. That all you have to do is paint it red, put a couple of hawken cruisers on there, and you are right back in Nazi bill USA.

1:
So this is a place that in our neighborhood, you go up this, there's this big hill. And, and

3:
Did I say Jerry Lewis also lived in this neighborhood? And

1:
Why Did you choose to live here, sir. Listen, we have these meetings that are none of your business. Alright? No, but this is my story, which is that they, the, that was something I've always heard. And then occasionally you'll, you'll find that it, it mentioned that this piece of land lives and that maybe, and some people get the story, get they get it wrong. And they think that Hitler spent time there, like in his board shorts looking out at the Pacific. You know,

3:
He did come out for pilot season one year. And it, you know, needed a place to stay.

1:
Six pilots. Didn't get one of 'em.

3:
Not a one.

1:
It was almost a seventh friend But. anyway, but I'm with, I'm with my friend once my, my same friend Brad that you saw, I'm riding, grinding up that hill on our bikes to just try and get to this very steep in parts. We're grinding along these two women like blonde, 22-year-old, I swear to God. Wearing like bikini tops. Very. And they just looked like they were just come from a sorority party. They flag us down like they were in trouble. And I said What Is It. And they went, do you know where the Hitler camp?

3:
There you go.

1:
Where's the Hitler camp about that And I went, oh ladies, well, All, right? Like, God, he, you still pulling in the trim that Addie Hitler,

3:
My god,

1:
Jesus

3:
Still pulling in the I know

1:
What Jesus,

3:
We making light of a very, very dark period. Without a doubt. Yes. So, yeah. I mean, you don't wanna say, how do you get to, how do you get to CO's house? Oh, well if you, you've gone too far. If you hit the Hitler camp. Right. Make a U-turn at the Hitler camp.

1:
When you get to the Mussolini cul-de-sac. Yeah, yeah. Take a left.

3:
Yeah. To right triangle. But yeah, that's up there and Yeah. Yeah.

1:
The, I'm gonna switch gears for a little bit. Let's see how you do this. And I want to talk about the, the Japanese and Jerry Lewis and 1944,

3:
What year, what year did we, the first year I was on SNL and you were back in, we called you the 1988. I called you the boiler room boys. Yes. It was you and Denki and s gel gel in the back.

1:
The guy back in the day when I was working at SNL, who was money in the bank and still is to this day, was Mr. Tom Hanks. Because, because he would show up and caffeinated. There were the, there were the caffeinated ready to go, Hey, hey everybody. What have you got? And he, I remembered coming out once. And I, I swear to God, I think it was maybe two in the morning. Most hosts, they hang around a little bit. They sense the sadness. The desperation. They smell the odors and they leave. And then they come refreshed at read through. I came out and there's this giant in the conference room. Oh yeah. There's this big table. And you were sitting there and you had been working on your own idea.

1:
Oh God. Yeah. And you were lying on, they had shoved all the tables together. You were lying on the tables like, like Christ with some pages over your eyes. 'cause you were trying to catch a, a couple of winks Yeah. Before you woke up and got back to writing at three in the morning. I'd

3:
Always heard that that was the, that was the great power of the hang that you got there an all night Monday and all night Tuesday you're going from now. They kinda like take the hosts around and the but I. Yeah. I wanna get in there and get in there and mix it up. Because here's one thing I learned about maybe the third time I did the show. There is ev you say, Hey, you're the host and say, Hey, I have some ideas for some, for some sketches. And every writer goes, well, that's just great. Oh my God, you have ideas that will rob us of the opportunity to get our ideas.

1:
Oh no.

3:
Read how wonderful And I would like to say. I don't think I, you then learn that. Look, you're the host. Concentrate on the monologue and then walk away. But it's a great hang man. Everybody's, everybody's carrying on and

1:
Yeah, it's amazing to me that, again, I've had this experience at The Simpsons. I've had it at Saturday Night Live. I've had it places where I worked there and as I left, thought this probably has a little bit of time left. You know, I remember thinking that at the Simpsons, like, this is going great. I bet you they got a couple more years. but I think I'll step off now and get a, you know, or the same thing with SNL. I remember thinking, this is great, but when I got there, I get there in 88. I'm there only 13 years after it begins. Oh yeah. And I'm looking at the wall and it's black and white photos of Arod Belushi And. it looked to me like Civil War photographs. Yeah. Right. It looked to me like the oldest

3:
Dero types.

1:
Yes. Like, oh my God. The olden times. Now if someone says, Hey, let's look at Conan's first year, 1988 as a writer, that, that

3:
Is

1:
On a giant one and a half inch brick. Yeah.

3:
Yeah.

1:
If someone has to put into a machine, they don't. Yeah.

3:
There was a period of time when you watch tv, you needed a, a a $8,000 video deck that had more moving parts Yes. Than the cars we drove to Conan Conan. Conan Land. Conan Land today. A ab absolute. But, you know, this would made, I was, I went to the Joni Joni Mitchell Jam at Hollywood. My wife Rita was singing along with everybody. And I sat next to Fred Orison, you know, and Fred's Fred Fritz. We compared notes on how many, listen, I'm a guy who drew grew up in a house without any women. I know four Joni Mitchell songs. They're gonna sing 32 of them tonight.

3:
I'm gonna love it. It's like going to the opera. It's great. but I asked him, you know, because, because No, I mean, no, I, I don't, I completely appreciate, I'm an absolute fan, but I asked them that question that I always, you're trying to say like, anytime somebody has retired, you know, I said, when you left the show were Did, you know, that it was time to leave the show. Or, you know, five, five months later, do you start getting cold sweats at the same time you got cold sweats? Do you start writing things? Yeah. And, I, God, God bless anybody who is a really great thing. And they said, no, no, no. You know, after all my time there it was, it was time to move along because I come from that school of you do not walk away from a gig if they are inviting you to come and be funny, make sandwiches, sharpen pencils.

3:
Have an idea. Yeah. Or I don't walk away from that gig. but I guess after a while it devours you and you and you gotta go along. Or did you get fired? Conan

1:
Did. Leno. Leno came and took my writing job at FNL

3:
Did. you? Yeah. Did you get this? Oh, oh, oh. Here's a note from Lauren. Open it up. Conan, thank you for all your service. We're not gonna Geez,

1:
Do to be. No, I burnt out. I burnt out. Yeah. I was gonna listen and Lauren could not have been nicer. I said, I've got to go. And that's when I went to the Simpsons. I just have to I Wish. I could go back in time. People always say no regrets. I regret

3:
Nothing but

1:
Nothing but I regret being so intense about that job. Ah, yeah. I guys was way too, I was way too intense. And I. Think I robbed myself of some fun that I could have had. I did have a lot of fun. but I think I could have had more fun And I. Think I could have maybe written there a little longer if I didn't make it such a grind for myself. Well,

3:
People have asked me what What Is It about And I think the creative atmosphere of that is the writer is on the floor producing the piece. Yes. Yeah. And that's un that's not, that's not standard stuff. No, no. A guy who wrote it with great passion is over there in between sweating bullets and vomiting out of anxiety. He's, he's telling Sting how to do a comedy bit, you know, at, you know, or, you know, say, could you make, you know, but that's, I think that's a great power of it. you get to produce the thing that you wrote then and there.

1:
The thing that Lauren does that's brilliant. That I didn't exist anywhere else. I'd only, I'd only worked about three years of in television before that, but no one had let me near anything. Mm. you get to SNL, you write a sketch and Steve Martin's gonna be in it and Lauren says, well go in and tell Steve how it should be done and what you're thinking. And then go and talk to the props people about how the restaurant should look. And I thought, I'm 26. I've never been to a restaurant. I don't know. And I. Remember Lauren once saying to me like, what restaurant are we in here?

3:
You you bought fast food. That is soda actually sitting down. Do you remember

1:
You did a sketch that a couple of us did called Mr. Short Term Memory. Oh God. Yeah. And so we wrote the sketch, Mr. Short-term memory. And Lauren called me in and he said, what restaurant are we in? And? I said, what do you mean? And he said, are we an or? So are we at a Lanes And I? Didn't, those are just don don't know what those are. And I said the worst thing you could say to Lauren. I said, it's a, it's a restaurant like in a Carol Burnett sketch. Immediately nine assistants took me out of the room. Wow. Lauren was immediately anesthetized.

3:
Not, not, not that she isn't a legend. And I just thought like,

1:
Oh, restaurant like big menu. Okay. Snooty waiter. Now

3:
I have the buy. You gotta, it's a, you do have to learn how to survive physically when you do the show. Yeah. And the last, the last time I did it, I, I told everybody who was in charge of me, particularly our, our wardrobe and stage manager people, I said, I, I want you to understand that my, my goal on this week's hosting duties is to take as few steps as possible. So I am going to, I am going to come here and you will, I will get dressed. And where can we get dressed next time? Because don don't have to walk all the way back here. I'm going to take as few.

1:
I've noticed that you were, you were sitting in most of your sketches.

3:
I I'm gonna do that. I've gotta do that as much as possible. Because look, you know, it's a young man's game. And there was a time, there was a time that you just, you know, it's just balls to the walls and you just fill up every minute with the activity. No, no, no. Take it easy. Tom,

1:
Just before we started the podcast, we were chatting and you were talking about how both of us having highs and lows in our career, And I was thinking I know what you're talking about, Tom, but no one thinks that about you. I I think you have the career.

3:
Well, let me just, I'm, I printed up my IM db. Okay. Now you notice I'm almost to a hundred films here, right? Yeah. I'm getting, I'm getting up there. But I'm gonna say it's

1:
Really crinkly paper.

3:
I'm, I'm gonna say, well, you know, come outta the printer. I'm gonna, I'm gonna say see it out. All these, I'm gonna say six of these are pretty damn good. You know, the rest of the rest of them are checkered. It's all a checkered career.

1:
Well, that's, no one here is buying it. Nobody's thinking about the time when you were down and out, because I don't think it exists. I don't think that's ever existed. Oh, well,

3:
Okay. First of all, everybody wakes up at three o'clock in the morning, sometimes splashes cold water on their face and asks this question of the zeitgeist, what is happening to me?

1:
Why, why

3:
Can't I rest?

1:
Why

3:
Am I tormented and haunted

1:
Yet again, that's your mattress. I think that's a, that's a, but Okay.

3:
The look, I, without a doubt, I, I really dig my job. And, I go into everything with an insane amount of enthusiasm. Yes. And faith in the collaborative

1:
Famously So, yeah.

3:
Faith, faith in the collaborative process. And it is the, I don't wanna go overuse sports analogy, But, it really is the baseball analogy. Ted Williams hit 400 for one season of his baseball career. And that's about the best you can do. If you're somewhere between 2 82 and you know, three something that they, they will, they will put you in the Hall of Fame. And the, the thing that there is nobody, nobody starts a movie and says one of these two things. This ain't gonna work. No one says that on the third day of shooting. Right. We have made a terrible mistake.

3:
None of this is actually thing all these peoples that are getting paid are liars. They are in, no one says this right. Nor does anybody say on the third day of shooting, we're in Clover Boys.

1:
Well, that's 'cause it's not

3:
1940.

1:
We, this thing's ACEs fellas. Hold on. Hold on

3:
To your quarters. Jasper. No, no one Snow says this. I was, okay. Roger spot us Wood, who is about, as, as facile a filmmaker as I, he, we, we were shooting Turner and Hooch. And this was back when I really put, you know, an import on the reports. You know, you wanted, like, how's it going? Great. Oh, we saw this And, it was great. And that was great and everything's great. How about that scene and how that was a, and Roger Spottswood came back from looking at dailies one day at lunch. And I said, Roger is English, And I said, Hey, hey, how are the dailies? And he said they were not half bad.

3:
And that's all you can shoot for. Yeah. How was it? Well, not, I don't know, you know, may I hope it'll cut. That's all. That's all you can, that's all you can hope for. And so at the end of the day, the, the thing that is now an advantage of is, I talk about this sometimes with people who, as old as I am, we got into this, lemme tell you a story about technology. Speaking of one Inch vh. Yep. Cassettes. The in between, in between the two years of the Bud Bosom Buds, the VHS machine was invented. The first season was in 1980. And in 1981 you could go to Mad Bad Mun or you know, something.

3:
And for $4,000 by a video cassette machine. Right. And that altered absolutely everything. So as of episode, you know, 22 of KIPP and Hendry's Adventures in, in Bosom Buddies, everything has since been rentable, And it sits there for, so I have had Count. And now of course you can watch a movie any damn time you want to, I can't tell you how often I've been somewhere and someone will come up to me and say, excuse me, Mr. Hanks. Yeah. Oh, hi. How are you? I just wanna say, your films have always been a great salvaged for me.

3:
I've really enjoyed many, many times I've turned to you. And I was home at one point and came across and saw a film that you made in 1993 that really, really spoke to me. You played a Air Force pilot in World War II in Israel. And I had never heard of the film before. I didn't know it existed, but I really, really, really enjoyed it. And I said, oh, that movie was called, every Time We Say Goodbye, it was directed by Moe Rahi. And I made it for about eight weeks in Jerusalem, long before the ADA began. Very good. Sur And I also enjoyed Toy Story. Very, very much so all, all of all of, you know, all of this stuff lives, all of this stuff lives.

3:
And, and now, now what what happened is, is that time has become one of the metrics for how these things matter. Yeah. Right? Yeah. In the day, I mean, look, it was just a fist flight. It was a, it was a, every movie you came out, are you gonna make the playoffs or not? And guess what, no kid, you're, you're, you're two and 12 and you ain't going nowhere. Or you got a shot. You used to be, you, you had these, these had these rubicons that you crossed when you came down to, first of all, do you love it or not? That's the first thing. Hey, I read this thing. I love it. I can't get outta my head. Yes. Okay. You have crossed the rub. You have crossed the Rubicon. Right. The next Rubicon you cross is when the movie is completely done a year and a half later.

3:
And you see it for the first time and you might like it, or it might, it doesn't matter if it works or not. You look at it and say, Hey, I think we acquitted ourselves pretty good. That's Rubicon number two. Then the critics weigh in Rubicon number three. And that's always up, down. We hate it. We like it. Oh, this is the worst thing. You Oh, hey. Oh, hi Tom. I I, I saw in a movie. Oh, Did you Yeah, it was, it was cute. Oh yeah. That's when you ask the wife, Hey honey, could you take the revolver out of the glove box and hide it somewhere? Because I think this is saving private ride. And so then, but then this other thing up is how it does at the bo how it does at the box office.

3:
Whiz whi a bona play. Then a ton of time goes by when none of that stuff matters anymore. And the movie just exists exactly as it is outside of loser. Winner status. Thumbs up, thumb, thumbs up, thumb thumbs down. And that's when this stuff comes around where it's like that this thing that didn't work back then kind of does work now. Or, or just the opposite. A thing that was huge back then is a museum piece and doesn't really speak to anything

1:
That thing you do. Oh yeah. You were disappointed when it came out And. it has this whole other life now. It is, it is this cult classic. Okay, I'm gonna, but that's an example of,

3:
Let me tell you something about these cocksuckers who write for about movies. Can I say that?

1:
Yeah. Okay. It's a podcast. My father writes about movies and his name is Cocksucker.

3:
Somebody, somebody, somebody who, somebody who wrote about it is, is that this is just, you know, Tom Hanks has to stop hanging around on with veterans of tv. 'cause this is just like the shot on tv and it's not much of anything. You know, that same person then wrote about the cult classic. That thing you do, same exact person. It's all you need is 20 years between, between now and then And. it ends up speaking somewhere. but you know what, that's the thing we all signed up for. That's, you know, that's the carnival. That's the contest. Right. The,

1:
You,

3:
I, I got faith in that. That's

1:
Okay. You had a moment on Forrest Gump, and of course you're working with Robert Ec, you're working with him on Forrest Gump. You're sitting there on the bench and you just thought, is anyone gonna watch?

3:
That's exactly All, right? Yeah.

1:
What Did you say, is anyone gonna watch this? Is anyone gonna care about this guy? We,

3:
We had already, we had worked so hard, so much, and we were only about 40% through with the movie. We still had a ton of stuff that we had to do. We had shot, we had shot 27 straight days in a row, which included helicopter rides to like, places in America where forest runs across the country, you know, with a beard, without a beard. You know, we'd been all over the place. And I'm exhausted, I'm fried. And we've got like, we've got like 36 hours to shoot this stuff in Cherokee Square in Savannah. You know, I'm their dressed and we have a ton of act kind of actors that are come in, they're gonna sit next to me on, on the bus bench. And we are trying to shoot so much that I said, Bob, there is no way my sad little brain can learn this much dialogue because I, I've got a page and a page and a page and a page and a page.

3:
And that's just up to lunch. I, I, I, you know, if you think I'm gonna be word perfect on this, you're outta your mind. And I'll worry about it, Tom. We'll just put it on cards. Like it's, I

1:
Love Lucid. And you know what, we'll slide the cameras

3:
Around. So is You. Don't wanna have to get vent

7:
Dummy.

3:
We've worked together a lot. Well actually no I know what that means. Now I know what that means. And so we, we were doing it And it in all honesty, you know, you do it twice and then you get it down so it goes pretty fast. And we were, we were midway through like a day. We shot all that stuff in a day. All the stuff on the thing. We, we were little This is you on the park? Bench? Park, park. Iconic Park, park. Yeah. We shot, we shot it in a day. And at one point, you know, I'm just, you know, I'm, what is this?

7:
You

3:
Know, I'm trying to read it. I said, guys, can you make the print a little bit better just for these first couple of takes, but then I'll get it down. Don't worry about it. The other actors are coming in. You wanna run this? Go like that. At one point, you know, Bob is sitting there next to me, And I said, don don't know Bob. And you know, anybody gonna care about this guy dressed up in like a, this kooky ice cream suit sitting on this bench saying, saying stuff, you know, is it, is it gonna cut together? Is it gonna matter? Is it gonna make any sense? And man, Bob, well, that's the thing about making movies, Tom, it's a minefield. It's just a fucking minefield. We don't know if we're sowing the seeds of our own destruction or not.

3:
And that, You know, that is the truth. Yeah. Of every single moment that you're standing in front. Look, I I know I made this movie in that was altered, you know, And I, I always say in, in years to come, we'd be talking about a movie called Cloud Atlas. I made it with the Wasowski. And that was one of the most vibrant, loving, hardworking, magnificent thing. And when it came out, it was just like, oh, oh, hey, nice movie. Meanwhile, the Incredibles are, you know, you, you're, oh, you're, we got lost in, in the horse space. So all you can do is show up and go there. Everybody says, how'd you do that scene? Oh, I'll show you. I showed up that day and we all went there.

3:
Is there any trick to it? Yeah. Here's the trick. Go there, And it. If you, if that means you gotta put yourself through some sort of psychological hell in order to get there, go there. Now you might know this, you show up to work and you're gonna do a convi happy, hilarious scene. Right? The everything works great. And you know, you know what happened the day before that your dog got hit by it. You know, ev every tragedy has happened to you. Yeah. Eight hours prior to show up and just be,

7:
Isn't it fun to be in love and shoot a montage where we're licking ice cream and we're holding hands and we're skipping stones and playing a beach ball and it's,

3:
And then we're dancing

7:
In a gazebo

3:
And it's on with the worst days of your freaking life. Yeah, yeah. Right? Yeah. And then other days where you gotta go and you have to like, go to a place that's incredibly dark and stormy, And it crazy. And all you did last night was laugh like crazy at the karaoke bar with the rest of the guys and the crew. I said, guys, it's, it's two o'clock in the morning. I love to sing another Elvis song, but I have to weep and cry at eight o'clock in the morning. So I think I'm gonna think we're gonna go return. All you can do is go there no matter what. 'cause guess what? You don't know where you're stepping. It's, it's a minefield. Conant. It's a fucking minefield.

1:
Just think about it. You've worked with all these directors Spielberg

3:
More than once.

1:
More than once. Yeah. But you've worked with all these iconic directors and Ron Howard and Ec And I mean the list goes on and on and on. And Nora Ephron Nora, yeah.

3:
Worked, worked with her three times.

1:
You've gotten to a point where, is it possible for you, Tom Hanks, to be intimidated by a director on the setter? But is that gonna happen now,

3:
The, the the the first three days are three days of terror. Yeah. Because it's a combination of everybody else who is there. And also just on the third day, you realize no matter what the movie is, you realize I should have said no. There just should have been something wrong with the d I. don know, Because here we are, here we are. The intimidate I will look, I I've done this long enough so I I now am aware that I intimidate other people. You know? Yeah. Because, you know, 'cause you show up and then somebody said, okay, okay, I'm ready. I'll tell you this story. Okay, here's the show business story. We are shooting perhaps the most scary, intense, truly scary, intense real life scene in Captain Phillips.

3:
We are, honestly, we're overweight, old, middle-aged guys who are gonna be taken over by these pirates. And we have never met the guys who play the pirates. We don't know who they are. All we know is that they are coming. 'cause the way Paul Greengrass shot that, he had cameras on us and cameras on the four guys, Barkov and, and Ab Abdul and Big B, little B all the guys. And we have never met them. And they are firing automatic blanks, you know, machine guns. We hear all this stuff that's going on and the don't, we don't see anything until the camera outside the bridge of the mayors, Alabama. We see the camera backing up with the guys pulling the cable.

3:
And then four of the scariest human beings I have ever met come in and they are screaming at us. They are slapping us. They are hitting us. They're pushing it down and they're holding, they're real guns. You know, they're holding them in our faces, screaming at us and And, it was, honestly, we are all bug-eyed with some form of terror. Even though we know it's a movie that is removed. Because guess what, we all went there. All, right? Yeah. Yeah. So we're all there. This initial scene went on for about 20 minutes. 'cause Bob Paul does this thing where he has a secondary and third cameras that don't start shooting until later on.

3:
So film is always rolling and then one camera will go quickly reload, and then join back in the scene. So this is, this is gonna be,

1:
You've gotta stay in that space. And

3:
We are right there because the camera's on us And it and it's working. So four of the skinniest, scariest looking guys, their eyes were all bloodshot. They all had this teeth. They were all built like wires. They've had muscles like rope. They're dressed in rags and they're holding AK 40 sevens on us and they're screaming at us And. it went on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Relatively unrehearsed When it was finally done, Paul says, All, right? Alright. Okay, alright, alright. That went well. That went well. Why don't we, and well like this. And we said, why don't, if we can, what I'd like to do is just take it back and come back in.

3:
And. I said, okay. Yeah, All. right. Okay, good. And then one of the actors, Mahat was his name. Mahat says, I, I can't believe I'm working with Forrest Gump.

1:
He just tried to kill you.

3:
So a yes. So countenance right. Comes along with, with the whole bit. And, you know, once we got that done, we were just guys making a, we were just guys making a movie. And. it was fantastic. But, but that's an example of, you know, there was a moment where you have to do all this suspension of the reality of, of, you know what it is. And all you can do is all you can do is go there.

1:
The only thing I have that that's a little similar is for years, occasionally we would have a band on like Slipknot for the first time, guys, you know, with skulls, you know, just, and they would come out, or a band would come out and they were literally like blood capsules out of the mouth and fierce. And the song is just like, you know, and then you'd, I'd come out and I'd say, we'll, take a break. Death kill murder, baby. We'll take a break. We'll be right back. And, I would always be a little intimidated. 'cause I'm in a suit. Yeah. I'm the late night host. I'm the, whatever the, the game show host And. I'm just saying, okay, we'll take a break and these are the guys that are from Manchester.

1:
Oh yeah. Or whatever. We'll take a break right back and the person would always go, just lovely meeting you. I really enjoy. There's just, that's such a nice sensibility. And you are like, Slipknot, I can't, can't handle that. I can't handle All. right. The psychic brick.

3:
This is why so many of us go stark raving nuts. Yeah. Because that surrealistic divide Yes. Between why you are there. Yeah. And what are you creating. Yes. Begins be it's too malleable after a while. Yes. Yes. And yet it starts And it finishes within, within the wink of an eye. You know, it's that, it's that type of thing where the massacre is over and cut and all the dead guys start getting up and moving around, you know? And you move on and you, and you get the other shot. It, it, it's I. Wish. We could just keep it all secret. Like the Coca-Cola formula. I Wish. We didn't have to remember, but I, I I, I don't watch movies that I'm in.

3:
'cause they, they haven't changed since I saw them. So I know how they I know how they end. Right, right. And, but every now and again, like, you're blown through the grid or something like that. And a minute comes on or a scene comes on. And what I remember is what happened just before we shot that scene. That's all that I, that's all I can recall. I look at it, And I don't remember doing the scene per se, but I said, oh, it was cloudy that day. And you know, I I, I dropped a script in a, in a mud puddle. And then

1:
That's all. Then I had some flon. Yeah. And then it was time to go.

3:
Yeah. What do we have? Oh, you know what, somebody made Reen sandwiches that day. That was, that was really great. I remember craft service made Reen sandwiches that day. Yeah. And I. Think it was Annie in the accountant department's birthday. And so we all sang Happy Birthday in the catering tent tour. There you go. There you go. That was that day.

1:
I wanna talk about here. Which I've never seen a movie like this. I really loved it. I was riveted by one thing, which is the camera. It's, it's hard to explain. Yeah.

3:
Yeah.

1:
It's, but basically it

3:
Has a cinematic technique to it that is very unique. Is that what you could say?

9:
I, I love the graphic novel. And the graphic novel is it's one shot. Yes. So you open the book and it's one shot, and then it's everything that's happening that's ever happened in that one shot.

3:
You the entire, you have done our job for

7:
Us, by the way.

3:
And you haven't even seen the movie. No,

1:
I love,

9:

3:

7:

3:

We're talking about everything he brings up, we're talking about The Godfather and bla leans in mid-interview and says, I read the comic book And it Startled Pacino. And he said, I gotta go. And he left. Oh, wow. And they ended their interview early. Thanks

3:
Blake All. right. There you go. Sorry about

1:
That But. anyway,

3:
But, but you, you talking something because I was talking to Bob. Bob, Bob And, I get together all

1:
The time. Bob

3:
And I

1:
Bob. So everyone's clear All, right. Robert Meki. He, he co-wrote this and he directed it. You

3:
Are right, right? Yes, yes. I And I I did Forrest Gump with Bob. I did the Polar Express with Bob. I did cast, cast away, cast with Bob And. I did Pinocchio with Bob. I played, I played Edo. Thank you. And while we, while we were doing that, I always say, you know, we had seen this, we had seen this movie. I had, he had talked about this movie a long time. Be we got time to talk about this stuff. Right. We don't have to hurry through this. No. He had talked about this movie that he had seen and he said, hi, And. I said, I guess the most amazing thing last night, I would say, I couldn't figure out where, how they got this shot. How did they get this shot? I said, what was the shot? He said, well, it was in the back of a Jeep. And the Jeep's going down this, going down this bumpy road. And all you see is the window and the cage of the Jeep and the driver and the back and the, the, this camera's whipping around all.

3:
And then the Jeep stops. The guy gets out. And I tell how, where did they get this? Where, how did they do this Flat? Where, where's the camera? What, what was the rig? How did they mount this thing? And then they opened, the guy opened it back, and then suddenly you are in the grass and you're going through the thing. And I realized they put the camera on a dog. The name of the movie was The Truffle Hunters. It's a great documentary. Wow. It's about, I don't know. It, it's, it's fascinating. It's about essentially the relationship between the people who hunt out truffles and the dogs that find, sniff the truffles for that. Yeah. And then his examination, also the sociological, the business of Truffle and also the, the people that do it. And a lot of the movie was shot from a standard, what we call static POV.

3:
The camera never moves. And yet the scene will go on for 8, 9, 12 minutes. And I was talking about. 'cause I ended up seeing, I said, God, there was some stuff in there that was one of the most evocative moviemaking I've ever seen. And. it was a documentary. There was no music, there was no score. It was just people behaving. And I was fascinated. And, I wonder Bob, I wonder if you could do that in a, in a feature film. And he looks at me and he says, buddy, you should ask that Tom. Then he hand, then he has the screenplay that he wrote with Eric, Eric Roth, who did, who he did Gumbo with us as well. And I said, you need to read this. And then he also handed me the graphic novel by Richard. I can't remember what his name is.

1:
Bla you're allowed to speak. don don't know his last name.

3:
I'm sorry. Fuck you. Great.

10:
I blanked out. I blank. I, I'm having a stroke. What,

3:
What did I call those people who write about movies? One word. Did I use cocksuckers? Don't make me say it again. So, but then he gave me that. And honestly, I had to read the graphic novel about three times in order to figure out what, how it was gonna translate to this thing. And then when I got it, I literally said, ow. My God. This is a deep throat baby.

1:
Just to inform our, our listeners or if you're on YouTube viewers That's right. I know how to play the game. Or if you're an alien and you're in space, the the camera is locked. You are looking at one point of view. Time jumps. Yeah. You're gonna see Tom and Robin and their characters. You're gonna see them at

3:
17. 17. Yeah. Yeah.

1:
19, 20, 30, 40.

3:
Into our, into our eighties. Yeah.

1:
It is absolutely mind blowing because it's you. It's you. When I, yeah. Before I first met you, but it's you. When I first met you in 1988, I see no trickery. I see no sleigh of hand. It's you.

3:
Yeah. The tool that we, everybody, you know, everybody's like, what's the, what's this mean? You used AI in order to make boo ai is evil. What? What's it gonna make? The movies

1:
You used sang around a lot of hysterical people.

3:
It's over. It's all over.

1:
When Tom Hanks goes to a donut shop, you want a donut.

3:
Donut tell you want a donut.

1:
You have this effect on people. It's you.

3:
Yeah. It's my accountance that, that I bring in her. We, there is a, it's called Deep Fake. All it is is a moviemaking tool. In the old days, and by old days, I mean 2019

1:
Before

3:
It all changed, we still had hours in the makeup trailer. 'cause they had, we have to have wigs and hair. And they like do things like what? Jennifer, Jennifer was. She, I'd sit down in the chair, she says hello. She's very lovely lady. Said Hello. Hello, Tom. Hello. How was, how was your evening last night, Tom? And as she's asking me these questions, she's grabbing both of my ears, squeezing them, lifting them up on the side of my head and gluing them up higher on the top of my head as I'm going. And, I said, is that gonna halt? Oh, it has to Tom, because as you age, your ears grow larger and they fall down the side of your head.

3:
And today is the scene where you're only 22. So we have to raise your ears and glue clue them. Clue them to the side of my, and by the way, it works, it stays glued. It's like after I say you might need a staple gun there. No, no. It all, it all works. You go and you do a data scan and then they match it with every photograph that exists of me. And they go back and find as many photographs of me at the age of 17, 19, 20, 20, my entire life. Then they jam those in using, are you ready for the scary word when I say it? Can you guys like, like the work? Yeah. And and they use ai.

1:
Yeah.

3:
Right. In order to do all the work and make it happen faster, you used to have to put a dot on your face, glue it so the computer would read it and then match it later on. Now it uses the pores of your face. Oh my God. Just to match it like that. So we would, oh my God. We would have two monitors as we were shooting. One monitor was the way we really looked. And the other monitor with just about a nanosecond lag time was us in the deep fake technology. So on, on one monitor. I'm a 67-year-old man, you know, pretending he's in high school. Yeah. And on the other monitor, I'm 17 years old. That's

1:
Unbelievable. So the, the big question would be, you talked earlier about how you are hesitant to watch your own work. This sitting and watching this movie for you is watching you at 1767 and everything in between. How is, have you had that experience yet? Are you prepared for that

3:
Experience? I've seen just enough of it. And seeing me at that age, And, it has finally answered the question for me is, which is no wonder I never got laid

1:
The original title of the film. Well,

3:
I mean, I had a lot of energy. And. I was And, I was loud. And you know, I could, I could, I could make it

1:
Laugh. Well, you just described anything. I've occasionally been forced to look at myself in 19, from 1990, every day of my life was televised from 1993. Oh. Up until about. And I'm not happy with any of it. And I always watch it. And I. Look at my wife, And I go. Why? Well,

3:
So what, what we did actually have to examine this probably more than you ever do on a movie, because we had to literally go right? And we had technicians that were looking at our skin and stuff like that. But we also had to look at the timing and the cadence of what it is. because there is, I don't know what the actual name of it, but there is, there is a factor, I can't remember what it's called. We thought that we were speaking at a very realistic cadence, And, then we would go watch a playback And. it was as slow as molasses. It just took forever. but I always say, it's like the cinematic time slip.

3:
It seems like it's fast But, it plays in real time. So that's one of the things we discovered about it that didn't make it any more fun to sit there and look at ourselves in, you know, dressed up as as as we were. It

1:
Just occurred to me, I know that I've talked to you and you've several times where you've slipped into a, a Ron Howard impression. You've, you've just, you've, you've destroyed Robert Zuma's career

3:
And yet he comes back for more.

1:
Is anyone who directs you, you know, is liable to be impersonated by you.

3:
Some, some are a little, you know, some I guess are little

1:
Bit more don don't even know what a, what a Spielberg impression would be. I don't even, I don't get a sense of this.

3:
This would be, oh, I don't care what you say. We, on every, on every movie I've done, I've, I think I've worked with Steven five times. Let's see Ryan and the Terminal, and catch me if you can. Bridge of spies. Bridge of of Spies. Yep. Is there another one in there? don? Don't, I can't recall my, is there another one in there? DB And he always does this thing. I I wake up And. I. See, you know, Steven uses the screenplays of Steven's movies are the most basic blueprints. They are not, they're not the Rosetta Stones.

3:
They're not like set down. So it'll come and there'll be a lot of dialogue and you know, you do this, you explain this and you get there and I'll go, they say, oh man, there's an awful lot of stuff in there. I think I'd like to cut that. I'd like to cut that And. I'd like to cut that. And then I get to work and, and Steve will say, okay, here's the shot. We're gonna start here and the camera's gonna be right here. We're gonna be following you and you guys will be saying all your stuff right there. I said, well, I was thinking that maybe we don't need all this. Oh, I don't care what you say.

8:
I,

3:
I doubt the la the last couple of gigs, the la the last couple of gigs that I've had, I said, I said, when everybody is in town, we did this on Bridge of Spies and also about mostly just on Bridge of Spies. I said, look, I'll get, we'll get together with all the guy. Oh we did on the post. We did the post together. Did the same thing with the post. Get everybody together and we'll read through some of the scenes and I'll just explain. Say, listen everybody, there are some days that we will come to work and we will have all of this stuff memorized and we'll be hot. We will have read through it. We'll be prepared and we will get to this, to the stage. And Steven will have done all that work for us.

3:
We don't have to do anything except inhabit the space because Steven is telling the story from the cinematic perspective where the camera is and what he's doing. It's not gonna, not even gonna matter. But then there'll be other times my friends, when we will show up and we'll know it all and we need to know it. 'cause we have to get there. When we, when we shot this stuff on Thea Bridge, on Bridge of Spies, which was the real place where the spies were exchanged crazy. We, we were, we were freezing to death. It was very, very cold. And Steven came up to us, said, Hey, I hope you guys know all your lines. 'cause I haven, the slightest idea how we're gonna shoot this

1:
And

3:
I, And I just turned to all the guys and said, what did I tell you? And then, then he's the most malleable guy. Well, what if we stand here, Steven? What if we come out here? What if he comes out? Great, great, great, great. Oh, that's a great idea. Because they're not gonna come to that. He's very excited about all that. Cut

1:
Crap. I do have to let you go because

3:
That's too bad. We were in a good time.

1:
I know, I swear to your people that I would,

3:
This is your job.

1:
I know, you know what, no one, I stepped in shit when this thing came along. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Can you, can you believe that? No, I trust me.

3:
No. Okay. I lemme ask you a question. What now, outside of like celebrities, what is the, what is the hardest amount of research you had to do before someone came in and, and talked for it? Where, where, where Did, you guys all have to get educated on what they're, what they gonna be talking about?

1:
The, I'll tell you this, I'm

3:
Just gonna guess Pacino was a bunt. I'm gonna say, because you know, well I read his, I love the Pacino. Right. Read his

1:
Book. but I would say the funniest part of my day today was coming in and David hopping handing me my research on Tom Hanks. And. I was like, first of all, no one needs research on Tom Hank no whole country. And also you don't need like Yes. More about this Hanks tell me of him. Ah, yes. You know, it was a funny moment to me that I would, that I would need that. But no, there are people who I'm not as familiar

3:
With. Well had like somebody like come into like an astrophysicist or something like that. Oh no,

1:
I am an astrophysicist.

3:
Yo, you're not gonna, you're not gonna work that hard. An astro, is that what you're saying? Well,

1:
You had Robert Carroll, but you were so versed on him anyway.

3:
Oh, okay. All.

1:
Right. I didn't really need to, I mean, you know, the thing is, I have people on that I love to talk to. It's

3:
The author Robert Carroll who wrote, you know, the, all the,

1:
The porn star Robert Carroll. Oh my God. Yeah. And you had to do no research on, I had seen it all for Robert Carroll, the Lyndon Johnson historian. I needed to bone up and I do mean bone up. Bone up. All he

3:
Had to do was go to that web browser history. And. it was All right there.

1:
His favorites tabs. I mean that tabs just always open. No, I, that's what I love about this is that I'm talking almost exclusively to people that I really enjoy, that I want to talk to. And so there are occasionally youngsters up and comers, And I feel like I need to educate myself on what's happening with the new rock and roll. But other than that, this is slip not, I was gonna say slip not. Yeah, yeah. But for the most part it's just, just a joy. I mean, this has been a joy, this I know, I I have to say I've, you're not just one of my favorite actors of all time. And I think that that's true for many people.

1:
But as a person, you've been unfailingly nice to me. Ah, kind of be over the years you have been just a mensch to me. And so has Rita, your lovely and talented wife indeed. Who's by the way, an amazing, I mean, I enjoy watching her perform. She's fantastic.

3:
She just had a, she had dropped a new, dropped a new record as the kids said last Friday. She records with all the time.

1:
I mean, you know, I, I've actually seen her live, but she's recording with these incredible

3:
People. Yeah. She did a, she did a bunch of duets from the seventies with Eric, excuse me, with Elvis Costello. Yeah. And Tim McGraw and, and Jackson Brown. Yeah. And oh, and smokey Robinson now. And no, I, she blows me away. What I i I love is that I love going on stuff with her jobs. You know? 'cause don don't, don don't work man. Yeah. The most, the most that is expected of me is to carry your lip gloss. You know, I'm not working just honey. Do you need your lip gloss? You know, that's about, that's about all I that's all about I have to do, you know, And I. Then I get free tickets to the show. It's pretty great.

1:
Well, when I heard you were coming in today, I was over the moon and I really did enjoy here. And I. Think you guys would love it. And and you'll watch it on a real screen. Yes.

3:
Yeah. Okay. So this, this is a problem. This is like striking terror in the, in the hearts of anybody connected with marketing, you know, with the studio or even my crack publicity teams. Essentially the, the ladies who work for me part-time that are outside right now. The idea that this is playing only in theaters and you really do need it, it's best to watch it on the biggest screen Yeah. Possible. because there is so much stuff going on screen. It's like, oh, oh my God,

11:
This is the worst thing. How are we gonna do

3:
That? I said, I believe people understand how movies work.

11:
No, but you don't understand the whole side crisis has changed. We don't have what social significance and motion pictures have anymore. Do they go to, I hope they go to Alamo Draft House. I hope this place is normal

3:
Dropout. You know, it's like all, all you have to do is put out there that playing only in theaters and let's see what happens. Yeah, we'll go on from there. Right. But this is what we do down at the office. And it literally we should do. I this is, this is all we do. I mean, every show business atmosphere I'm in, we sit around like we're on a podcast and say this story, that story, what's the man, how'd that happened? Do da da. That's essentially how we work in show business. And it's been that way since I was in high school. You know, it's all we

1:
Done. Well, it's also you, I I can attest to this, having met you all those years ago and watched you work up close, you bring an energy and a, hey, we are all in this, we all have to make this work. That is not common. Not everybody does that. And some people have walls and insecurities and you have always been someone that I, I And, I saw it in 1988. I've seen it when all the times that you would come on my show over the years, all the times I've interacted with you, Hey, we all have to do this thing. Let's all pitch in and make it work. And that's a beautiful quality to have. There really is. And it's rare.

3:
Oh, well, God, listen, I I it was best said to me by Darlene Love. Right. Darlene Love. We all don't Darlene love. Sure. You know, from a, you know, from all other records, she, I was on the Letterman show for the Christmas Oh yeah, the Christmas show year. She does that every year. She would come on and sing It's Christmas that fabulous, fabulous, fabulous song. And I was there and it's like, oh, oh, you, you can go into hair and makeup as soon as Darlene Love is Darlene Love is here. You know, it's like, oh my god. Yeah. What am I gonna say? I gotta go, gotta go meet Darlene Love. And so I went in and she was sitting there and said, oh, hi. Hi. Hi, miss Leva.

3:
