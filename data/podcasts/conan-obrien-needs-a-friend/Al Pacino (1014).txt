Congratulations. Oh, thank You. That's, that's a wonderful co compliment. Thank You. Yeah. And. That's all. The time. We haven. Yes. It's been nice haven. You here. I. I'm not haven that kinda luck today. Let me tell you something. I'm hard pressed to think of anyone who's had more iconic performances than You is just such elite company of actors.


20th century, 21st century actors. And I. Read this story. And. There's So much despair in it. There are highs. But There are lows to people like me to think about Al, Pacino, I. Just think, oh, it's just been What. A miraculous never ending series of successes. but your childhood in The, south Bronx. Yeah. I'm reading about it. And. it could haven been The. 1890s I. Mean I. know It's The. 1940s, early fifties. Yeah But. You're running around like one of The dead end kids with a gang. do You know What I mean? It's absolutely incredible. And, you're constantly almost getting killed. I. Mean What. Well, it still goes on. You know. Yeah. Yeah.


But I on The way up here. You know. Yeah. It's a tough part of central Hollywood right here. You know Beverly Hills. There are some sections, but haven Dodge those lattes. but no I mean It. You're talking about this period of your life. And. it is. It feels like it could be a hundred years ago. It's, it's such a crazy experience. And What. You went through You. your father leaves when you're two years Old. A less than no. Yeah a little. Yeah. Two. Okay. Let's just go with two. Let's go two please. Yes. Okay. Let's just go. Even Number You. know Yes. You. Were 1.9. your father left And. your mom is, has mental health issues. And.


Then she passes away when you're still a very young man. And. You Live kind of a chaotic young life. That was a real surprise to me. I didn't t know That? really? Yeah. Had You ever heard of any part of my life at all? Or I had I knew That. You had been in theater. It always felt to me that The, Al, Pacino story was young guy doing theater. Gets The Godfather hits it out of The Park And. Then The rest is spectacular. I, read this story. And. It's almost miraculous. That, you get out Childhood. do You know What? I mean? That's The feeling. I haven. Yeah. That's Good. I. I didn't mean that for You to haven That feeling, but it's great.


You had a feeling You. know I haven't had a feeling in a very long time. I know can try. Reading The first two chapters of my book. I'm, I'm doing The Audio of It Now And. It's really a knockout. It really knocks You out. I mean You. Start seeing your life. And And. You You. know. In order to read a book on, on You know You haven to Act The. Act The parts. because You just read it. Monotone. Some of The monotone readers are, are wonderful. Yeah I. Mean I. really. Get The The. The. Great. Sean Penn reads Bob Dylan I. Read That. Did anybody hear that book I haven't Heard That One.


No. I've heard Sean PE sings. Bob Dylan I Don't recommend. Oh, no. don, don't recommend it. I don't recommend It. He ends s up punching The microphone. Oh my God. Oh, Well. He got, He got Bob Dylan Yeah. Yeah. He really, he really got his tone. And And. So. I'm reading these stories. And. Of course, I lived through them. So I. I was sort of reliving them. Yeah And. It's, it's, it's tough. I would think it's tough because You run around with this gang of kids. Yeah. South Bronx. And, You. Point out that your mom did keep an eye on You. Yeah. You did feel that You were more supervised than some. A lot of your friends don't make it. Yeah. They die. Yeah. They die. They get into heroin.


And. It's very poignant because You start The book with them. And. Then at The, end of The book. After this incredible career. You, go back. And kind of dedicate It. Yeah. To these guys that didn't get outta The. South Bronx. Wish is very powerful. Yeah I. Don't know if You felt like I. I might be reaching here. But was There. A little bit of survivor's guilt. There like, how did I get out? And They didn didn't get out. Well, s always thought about that. Yeah. I, I. The. The thing. That was So interesting to me that I I recalled was one of my friends dying. And being buried in And. And around it with these just You. You. Remember The one, I say about this sort of cold January morning or something.


Yeah. Yeah. And. there. All ak all around The head. Bleak. Bleak. And. Bruce is lowered. And. The. Mother's crying. Who I knew. Of course, as as And. And. And. This aunt or somebody, I never saw, starts to relate her. Her feelings about Bruce And. What, she thought happened to him. Yeah. And. it was So. Profound. And. So. And. This is someone I knew I did comedy routines with it. Yeah. We, we used to do that stuff. And. She's So. Out of nowhere. Like just read him. So. Wonderfully And. And. I. Learned about him. And. it was, that was shocking to me.


You. You. Talk about It in The book. And. It's interesting because obviously So, many people are gonna pick up this book. And, say I. wanna hear about And? These are things You know. I wanna hear about The Godfather movies. I wanna hear about You. know all these iconic roles. All The people. You knew all The people. You met But. To me, The. In a way, The most fascinating aspect of It is that You. Start with these people. you get out And. When I say you get out. You are, none of us understands Why. I mean. I've had some crazy good fortune in my life. And, I don't understand. Yeah. Why. Yeah. And. I stopped trying to figure it out a while ago. Yeah. I was driving here today.


I haven. A ritual with my brothers, where we watch The godfather movies Religiously Mm. We can quote them from beginning to end. We always quote them to each other. And. I'm talking to my brother, Luke And. I said, know. guess where I'm going. I'm going to work today. And And can talk to an interview. Al Pacino And. My brother said, I'm very proud of You But. Who? The Fuck are You to talk to? Al. Pacino. Why. You. And. I said, Luke I. don Luke I. Don't t know But. I'm just going, I'm gonna go with It. Well I. Think he should be here. Let's bring him in. He's a criminal Yeah. Well, he's in. He's welcome. He's in. He's in prison, right? Now. Luke, we're thinking of You.


You know. It's interesting because you're grabbed by The Theater. You're this kid, as I said, who? You. You. Start reading Checkoff. Yeah. You. Start reading The classics. And. it grabs You. And. Start You. Start seeing some productions. you get into theater. You haven, So. Many go nowhere Jobs just to, just to stay up. Stay alive. I mean you're, you're delivering papers. You are your are. I'm trying to think. What, you Right You are building superintendent for a while, but not a good one. I don't think. Never, never. The guy came out. And started talking about me a few years back. Yeah. Saying he was a terrible super or something like that. And I thought, well, well, Why.


Why. Would he say That? Yeah. And. I thought. Who's A terrible super? I'm sure there's a lot around I. Mean You know. No I saw. hate this. There's a really old man who was like, I. Remember him? He was a terrible super And. I'm like, okay, take his Oscar back. t know. Take my actor. Terrible. Super. Well, Christopher Walken, bad mechanic. Robert De Niro hate this. Just awful substitute teacher. You know. It's like What The. Fuck. What are You talking about. These are about about So. You. Come along. You're doing theater And. Then this thing That people dream about happens. Wish is, you get noticed. Francis Ford Cope was gonna make The godfather And.


He says, I want this guy. Al. Pacino. And. The Studio says, fuck You. Of course, we want Robert Sort. right? We want Robert Redford. We want You know. We want, we, we, we want You know. We want someone who's been a success. We want someone who looks a certain way. We want someone probably blonde hair, blue eyed, whatever. Sorry. Yeah, exactly. I'm looking at You. And. I say It. I'm sorry. Yeah. They wanted me, Actually You know my grandmother I was eight at The time. Yeah. My grandmother on my mother's side has blonde hair, And, blue eyes, So. Just to note, That.


I mean. Yeah. It's in There. It's in You somewhere. Yeah. It is Haven. but What, I'm saying is I haven. Put it in You. They don't want You, But, And. They, I've seen The screen test where they're saying, okay, Well, how about Jimmy Kahn is Michael Cole. How about they're trying everybody. They're throwing everybody in. There. You, But, Francis for Coppola sticks with You. They start shooting And. You can tell you, read It in The book. And. It's riveting on The set. People are like, don, don't t know about this guy. don, don't t know about this guy. I. I. Don't What. And. You can feel It. Yeah. Well, they were giggling. Oh, You heard giggling. Yes, So, The. Here's what's amazing to me. These scenes that I've watched, And, that everyone's watched in this room a hundred thousand times, that are Now iconic masterclasses in how You play a character.


You're doing it And. People are going, oh, man. Let's hope they get a real actor in here soon. Yeah. My God. With is unbelievable to me. Was It That? Should be Conan. I was an 8-year-old kid. But. it was There. And. I had a lot of poet at The studio. I called Paramount And. I was like, I. Don't think he's got it. Who is this 8-year-old coder O'Brien? What. do. You. It'll be a big deal Someday. You'll see we're not using a real phone. Why are You. Minding one with your hands, but know it's my God. It funny. But, But But. No. And. And. The thing is Wish is to me.


I. Look at that performance. And as You say in The book, your concept Wish was clearly The. right? One With is You. Gotta slowly see Yeah. Michael, come to this position. And. Then there's The iconic scene where they're all trying to figure out After. Veto's been shot. What to do And. You are sitting There with your broken jaw. You say, Okay. We arrange a meeting. And. The camera's pushing in. I can't watch That. And. I can't talk about it without tingling, because I think it is a beautiful way to tell a story through acting But. It takes patience. And, The Studio was saying, Well, they wanted to see something else. I. guess. And.


Both Francis And, I, I think felt That way about But. We were unable, or at least I was unable to articulate What. I was doing, but I was doing that. I thought about It. On my long walks in Manhattan. You talk about It. You would take long walks. you get The film But. it hasn't started shooting yet. You took long walks. Yeah. I would go all The way from 91st to The Village. And back, 91st And, Broadway. And, I. Just think about The part. Think about It. I still do That with rules. I. Just think about 'em. And, It, It. It's fun. Yeah. It gets me through The Walk. Yeah. You get your step. Yeah can Glad t know that in coming up with who Michael Corone was.


You got your steps in. Yeah. There. It's I. I. I managed not to get hit by a car. And. I. That's that was in those days. They Should make a Fitbit. That tells You. You haven achieved The character. 10,000 steps. And. You. Nailed walking. You. Stop. Stop. Now. You've Nailed Michael Carle. You've got it. I love It, but You know what's fascinating to me. That I didn't know is that they, Coppola wants to show The studio. So. It wasn't supposed to shoot yet. But. He moves up Yeah. The famous scene in The Italian restaurant. I. I. Think he said he didn't do. That. So. I. I corrected in The book a little bit, but But in. It's a good story. Let's go With it. But. it is I. Think it's true. Yeah. I. Think he was sensing It, but The The conversation in The.


Gingerman. do You. Remember The Gingerman in Manhattan? 64th And. Yeah. Yeah. And. That's where he called me in And. He was sitting There with his family. And eating. And. it. It's a, it's a a a A bar And grill. That I frequented And. A lot of people did it. Beautiful. Did. you ever go There? I didn't go. There. But But. it. You. Talk about It. It's kind of very Well known. It's kind of, yeah. Yeah. Iconic place. It was a hang out. A watering hole. A place I. Mean You. know Bernstein would go in. There. And. Yeah. Great music. because there Lincoln Center was across The Street from It. So. You'd see people who You know collaborated with on on things.


So I walked in. There can. That was a big thing for me to walk into Gingerman, because You know. I didn't go There. 'cause I didn't haven money to buy The drinks. Yeah. So, I, I. I went in There. And. Francis was eating with his family. And. And. And. I was standing. There. And. He says, we had a talk. So. I thought, well, where are we gonna go? You know And. We are not gonna go anywhere. He didn't say that. But. He thought He didn't. The thing is you're standing. He's sitting And. He And. He doesn't invite You to sit. Oh. Oh. No. My God. hate this. That's a, that's The first sign. Yeah. This is important. You're standing. There. And. You've been shooting for I. Mean a couple of weeks. Now. Yeah. And. He tells You.


Well. He tells me. You know. I had faith in You. I believed in You. I said, yeah, I t know. He says, Well, you Right not, you're not cutting It. I thought. Oh, What do. I do Now. What. do I say Now. I said Well. I. guess that would would be a problem. I. I. guess. I mean So. Tell me What do You mean? He says, I wanna show You. The rushes meaning The footage. Yeah. That. We had shot already. And. That. I was gonna see something. I said. Well can I haven can I haven some of that Hamburger retrospect? You know I. Love to think What I would've might haven Don or wanted to do And.


So. I went to The. Paramount Theater. That. They had this screening. And I sat There You. know I I wasn't used to looking at myself on screen. I just didn't wanna I do That. I didn't. I had Don panic. And Needle Park already. So. I was don. Don't know if you've seen That Film hate this, Right. And. You'd had a little bit of experience. Yeah. But. Not Much. Yeah, not much at all. That was my first film. Or a Patty Duke film. It's I had a couple of lines. And. But. it went. Saw The rushes. And. I'm looking at The screen. And. I'm seeing The takes of different things. I'm thinking Well. That is not spectacular. but Why should It be, because I'm trying to see.


I was hoping that I could blend in with The scenery. And not be seen specifically, or You know. Spotted And. Wow. You know, right? I just wanted to just blend And. Just be natural. And I thought. Well I know. That's The way it looks. Now, but it That's part of What is going to turn into Michael Corleone. Yeah. And. That's gonna be The impact, because where did this guy What? Where did this guy come from? Yeah. The. And. He's an enigmatic kind of character. Anyway throughout The. Godfathers one. And two, especially So I thought that was The way.


I. I was gonna go So. Of course, I said to Francis, naturally, The actor's instinct. I just said, yeah, I. See, What You mean Yeah. Yeah. That always quiets everybody down. I. See? I. See What? You're saying

Maybe they assumed that I would jump. And get hurt. And. I'd be outta The. Film You know. Just, Just coming to me. Now Conan Hate this. An old co trick. Yeah. He put me in a film. It wasn't working out. And. They threw me out of a car. That's, that's gotta go into The box of resentment. But. Anyway. I did Miss The car. What. Yeah. And. I fell. It's in The book. We forget those things. Yeah. I know. I saw That. Yeah. Yeah. So. So. I. I fell. And. I was, I was hurt. Kind of. My ankle was hurt. Somehow I, it slipped on The. The car had one of those side things that You could jump on. And didn't jump in.


So. I. I was just looking up at The Sky. And. I said, thank You. God. This was my thought. I Actually said, thank You. God. You're gonna get me out of this film. Unbelievable. That's how much I wanted to leave it. Wow. I said, this is from Heaven. Yeah. And. People just swallow. Got around me. And. They said he's hurt. Yeah. So. I said, oh, yeah. And. Then they put one of these big fat needles in my ankle. So. I could finish The. The Day. And. They kept me. Yeah. They kept me because they saw The rushes of That. That of That event. And. They knew And. What's So amazing is movie comes out And.


This is this surprised me. Movie comes out. It's a phenomenon. And I remembered. I was 1972. I would've been nine years old at The time. Oh, anybody did? Was talk about that movie. People quoted it. It was I mean. It just, it's hard to describe Today. What a huge cultural moment. It was And You in The book. Talk about how uncomfortable You were. Yeah. You know. It's The thing. We live in this society, Now, where everybody wants to be famous. Yeah. And. People would think, oh my God. If I could be hate this true. A young Al Pacino who's just Don The godfather. Oh my God. Would I tear up The talent? And. I. You. Hide You. Don't l You. Don't love It. You. Don't And. You're drinking a lot. And, I. Think It was that period, That, time of life.


When this wasn't in know in, in our social understanding. We didn't care about fame And it. As a matter of fact, it was somewhat in The. Hollywood, somewhat was frowned upon in The theater by The way. And. And. They gave us these, this great entertainment, these great actors on The screen. But. it was a kind of folklore force. Us And, That. If You go to Hollywood, You, lose your talent. And. Something like that. Yeah that spread around. but also, I was extremely, I was a bit embarrassed. 'cause I heard something like Carac You know Jack Carac.


Yeah. On The Road. He So he, he goes, And And. He drinks his life away because he felt this embarrassment. I don't know where That comes from. Self-esteem. Whatever. But, it felt I wa I. I didn't wanna be noticed. I, part of my thing was I I just wanted to creep around. You know And. Just do my thing. And So. One time, I'm at a light Actually And I amm at a traffic light. And. I'm standing There across The Street. And. It's kind of gorgeous. You know redhead. I'm sorry. It wasn't You throwing him But. It was another redhead. I'm a man. Excuse me. I'm a, I'm about as much man as it gets.


We're still a Gorgeous, right. I'm a gorgeous redhead, though. Yeah. I. She didn't look like You. I do. Just be straight with You You. That Rowan story. Yeah. Everyone ruins The story. If, if It looks like me. Yeah. So, she says, she says Hello to me. She says, Hi. I thought. Oh, wow. I said, wow. Hi. She says, Hi. Michael And. it was as though I I said, this is crazy. She's calling me Michael because she knows me. Yeah. She knows me from The film. And. I just retreated. I. Just I. Couldn't understand that. Nobody did that to me my entire life. Nobody responded. Oh, wow. They didn You know. They never said that.


They didn't t know. They said, get away. You know So. I was kinda, I was kinda shocked. And, I. I retreated. And. Then I, start seeing it happen throughout You know, in these various pockets. There, these people. You know woman kissing my hand, people treating me. And And I. My friend, Charlie's There, And, The woman, comes up to me, says, That, Al Pacino. He says, yeah, yeah. She says, is that Al Pacino? He says, well, somebody's gotta be You know. Yeah famous. It freaked. You out. It freaked. You out. You Al. Pacino. I said, yeah. She says, congratulations, You.


Look like your order. You do. Look very Al Pacino Lee I. do I. Look Today. I thought So. Today. I was like, That. Guy's reeks of Al. Pacino You know. It's funny because then You haven, What, I, think is any actor would give their left arm for this string of You. know it's, it's Serco. It's Dog Day. Afternoon. Those performances, I. Watch those performances. And. They're So Electric. And. You had this energy. There's this energy that comes off of You. With still. It's still does by The way. But. There's almost electrical manic energy that comes out of You.


Out of your eyes, out of your I mean. don I was watching Dog Day. Afternoon. The other day. And, just your, your are You can tell that you're So inhabited by That role. And by that moment. And After. All these years. It's still spectacular, but You haven, this string, this string that's just unprecedented. And. I'm reading about it in The book. And The, whole time you're You feel very detached from It. Yes. Mm. Like, you're not reveling. And going, yep. I mean. I'd be out on The Street going, yep, that's me. See that guy up. There. That's me. Frequently are don. Frequently up. And The. Sad thing is I'm pointing at You. hate this. See that Al Pacino. That's me. See And. Then I, go to The Hospital. And, I, get treatment.


But You haven. This string, And And. it leads to more drinking, more drugs, more unhappiness, more feeling of being disconnected. Mm. Isn't that With, With, I, I haven to say, surprised me. I. I. Yeah. I wasn't aware. Yeah. Well, It, It. It hit me. I. It just did. I felt The kind of isolation from It. You know. I often talked about it as something like one has to earn one's relationships with friends. And stuff. You're with people because You like being with them. You know. do You enjoy You Share. The. Same thoughts about things. But. If I enter The room, And, I.


All of a sudden, What, I had to say, became important. Or You know. They, they all were looking And, Instead, letting me talk. And. I sort of never had that experience. And. it was uncomfortable. right? And, I, I. I thought, well, we don't even know each other yet. And. So to adjust to That. That. That's The. I. I've heard it said before, people adjusting to being famous. And being accepted. Wherever, You, wherever You go. And, So, I, I, I. Remember The I. Don't t know if I told The story about Marty Bregman, of course, was my, my, my producer produced The. You guys did So much together.


Yeah. Yeah. We did. And. So. Oh my God. I'm sorry about this. That's Okay. That might be for me, a Big, this seems to No. It's not Yes. This is So. Hi honey. Hi baby. I'm gonna I can't talk Now. I'm with Conan. And O'Brien. Yes. Yeah. Hear It Yes. I'll be finished in a minute. Sorry. Conan. No, I'm just joking. I can't believe. You. A couple of honey that this is my daughter, my youngest. Oh, that's s your daughter. your youngest daughter. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm glad It She's in a new, a new apartment. She, she is. You're not The Superintendent are You. Yeah. I fixed. The Pipe. I could be, oh, no. I gotta talk to her First.


I Love. but there's still a couple of people in that building who still think Al is The superintendent. I'll be There. I'll Be There. Oh my. I'll fix It. It's steam heat. It takes a while. Give it a second. You know what's crazy to me is And can I was unaware of this, but You haven, this Scarface You make Scarface And. it is at The time. Critics are savage about it. And hate this since become, in a lot of ways, I mean financially your biggest movie. It's huge. Yeah. And hate this a hate this, this kind of enduring place in The culture.


Yeah. With, nobody could haven seen at The. Time is That. Is that fair to say? That's fair to say. Yeah true. It. It's You know. It seems like It is always There. There's a, there's a guy wrote The Scarfaces papers. I. Don't t know if you've ever heard of that book. But. it, it, it explains some of The stuff about its consistency. And Why. It's still around Yeah And. We got a lot of help from hip hop And from The rappers early on. And, The, college kids, And. Then other things started happening. And. then we went into That. Vh A That That That started to The. VHS The. Vh S And. That's What Blew it up. And. Then It went across The You know, went over The Ocean into Europe.


And Asia, And everywhere. And So. It's like this thing. It's, It's, it's, it's, it's fascinating because it's So You know. Oliver Stone wrote this script. Yeah. Brien de Palmer directed It And it. They, they hit something. Nobody could be more different than The. Three of us, And Bragman You, know. We were just three different planets. And, And, There. We were And. Somehow It it. I It just made it. It made it work. For some reason, And You know. Brien de Palmer threw Oliver Stone off The set. He couldn't be There You know And And. I mean It was that kind of thing. And, people were But. It's a beautiful script.


When You, when You, when You read it, I. When You see What Brien has Don with It. And. So I You Know. It's what's amazing is 'cause I didn't know this. So don read. This was in The book. One of your big contributions was You knew that Tony has to haven his Scarface. He's gotta haven a scar. And You said, You thought of The idea. That It should come across. Yeah. The eyebrow. And You said in The book, You did that because You thought that that showed chaos. Yes And. I thought. I read that. And. I thought Yes It does. Yes. That's fantastic. You. Don't t know What. You're gonna get, this is chaos. It's, it's disconcerting. Yeah. I don't know how You thought of That, but it fact that an eyebrow is cut two is on an level, very disconcerting Yes in a subtle way that You didn't get a giant You know.


Yeah. You didn't do That. And. it led me back to, it's a theme in your book, I. Don't t know if this is conscious or unconscious. t know you've Don a lot of therapy, but Mm It does feel to me like there's some part of You. That likes chaos. I mean theater. Oh, come On. Of course, I mean well without chaos. Where are we? Where are we floating? hate this something. Yeah. Where are we? Yeah. No. In, in And. And. But. it kind of Chaos You know is it's, that's Why. s always Ride The. Five, 5:00 PM Subway in New York. Yeah. I like, I, like they burst. Shower. know. Sit around And. Here they go. You know Will The Doors open. You know It sort of gives You a lift.


You know You. Just feel, oh, can. I'm alive. And. It's coming. I don't haven anywhere to go though. I shouldn't be doing this. Yeah. I. I don't want You on The. Five o'clock Subway anymore. t know Can get off. I'm gonna come with You. They'll be like, Al. Pacino is with that gorgeous redhead. You know It's funny. You know. What shocked me. Is can And I I think I speak for a lot of us. When I think, type up, put your name in And. You're just going to see one of The The. Great. If not The, most influential actors, blah, blah, blah, blah. You in The eighties. Hit a cold spot. Yeah. And You. Talk about it in The book. Yeah. And. You. Think, well, my movie career is Over.


And. You are kind of out of It for a little bit. Yeah. you, Right. You're trying to do some theater And stuff. But. That's shocking to me. Now, because That wasn't something. You felt it. You lived it. Well, I thought, I I. Don't t know what's going on. I thought, I. don don't wanna be doing this anymore. There's something going on. Things are not work. Scarface was such a disaster. And. When I thought It was You know It was a a, a good film. I mean it was gonna work. But. It didn't And. It made Actually made money. It was The. Yeah. Critics sort of took a dislike to it. But at The. Same time. I, I. I just didn't t know.


I didn't wanna I do It anymore. Yeah I thought, well, let's refresh And. Let's go back. And. And do some of The things. That. I started with You. know that Fed You. Things like theater. Of Course. getting There being connected to people. Yeah. Get away from this. Exactly. Stuff. Yeah Talking through things. Pieces of work. You know whether it's Oedipus or whatever. You know. 'cause You know. When You do those kind of plays there. They're always in translation. Of course, So translation means everything. Who's The Translator? And. So. Spending time with that stuff, whether you're doing Cche Off or Sternberg, or some of The great plays. American players.


You know. So. I. I. I liked getting involved. And, that's What happens at The. Actor Studio. You. Yeah. You're able, that's What. We do There. And. So I did a movie called, looking for Richard After. That I was gonna bring. This That. This is What. I was gonna bring up, yeah. And I was gonna bring this up for a reason. You did this project called, looking for Richard And. It's about Richard I And. It's a, it's So many things. It's a fascinating movie because You There You see different performances for Richard I. Interpretations of it throughout The film. but You do something that I haven some familiarity with. With is a big part of my career, has been leaving The studio, getting a camera, finding real people. And trying to make something happen. Yeah. And.


I love That part. It terrifies me. But it. Love It. And. It's been don Don't t know. Maybe 70% of The work. That. I've Don That people. really like, is that kind of work where I'm out There doing this stuff. And, And, And. Things are happening in real time. Mm a big part of looking for Richard. There's a, there's a thread That runs through at where it's You on The Street talking to people. Yeah. About What. Does Shakespeare mean to You And. You are So quick. And funny. And Vulnerable. And. I. I. I. Could I was watching That part going like, damnit. He's good at that. You know I mean. I. That's The. One thing That I can relate to of all of your work is going out There with a camera.


And. I was blown away. You're talking to people. You're getting them to talk about Shakespeare. You're on The. Streets of New York. You. Talk to some young kid. And. You. Say, What. do You. Think a Hammond And. He goes, Hamlet sucks. Hamlet sucks. But. It's wonderful. It. It's fantastic. Yeah. It's You out. There. And. What. I. Love is You. Keep stripping It all away. Yeah. And saying, let's lose all this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oscar iconic films. Well, let's lose all That. I'm gonna put on a baseball cap backwards. And. I'm gonna walk through The Streets. And. Talk to people about Shakespeare. And. We're gonna get our hands dirty. Yeah, And. That. I mean that t know that That project meant a lot to You. I was sort of, I was sort of driven to that by Ha haven.


What. You had just said that. You, You. You. You. You. Wanna haven a piece of yourself in this You. wanna You, You. You. do you Right tired of just doing stuff that's not giving. You. What. You need. As in your, in your creative, that creative gene. We haven And. It's just not being supplied with stuff, because It, it happens for everybody. Yeah. So. Other actors too. You know. You. You. You. That's Why. Some actors, I talk about that in The book will repeat. Repeat roles, because they sc scored in them. And. They did well in them. And I continue to do well in them. But Hey there capable of doing much more.


It's hard to grow if You don't keep challenging Yourself. Yourself. Exactly. You gotta challenge yourself. That's, that's Why. I. Like chaos. Yeah. Well. You're in The, right place. I. Certainly am. And. That's Why. I looked at You. And. I said That. You. I. The. Other day, I wanted my Sony, who's 18 to see. I wanted him to see real acting. Real writing. So. I said, come with me. My wife was outta town. It sounds like I'm gonna show him pornography, but that was t know But. But No before She's outta town. This is an, this is a movie. This, this is called Deta Dallas.


No, I showed him Glen The movie. Glen Garry. Glen Ross. Oh, yeah. And. He's riveted. I'm riveted. It. Such an incredible cast. The whole thing. And The. Next morning. I. Go And. He's blown away. And. I'm like, okay. you get It. That's, that's, that's And. He loved It. And. The. Next morning, I. Go to get breakfast. And I run Smack into David Mamet. Oh, And. Wow. Yeah. And. I said Hey last night. And. He was like, please leave me alone. Oh, No. No. He's s always been very wonderful when I run into him. But. it could just tell all of You Were So great in that film, but your character So intimidates me.


He's charming, but he's intimidating at The. Same time You know. And. It's, you've got this. don Don't know it. It it. That's one of my favorite performances too. Oh, absolutely. Incredible Performance. I thought Jack Lemon. As time goes on, he really steps out in That part Jack Lemon. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean my It's I. Tried doing That part in New York on Broadway. Doing Jack's part. Yeah, because they did a production. You Were Richie Roma. I was Richie Roma. Yeah But In The Film But. Then You switched. And You did his part. On Broadway. On Broadway. And I did his part. And I. I thought I could do his part somewhat. It's a good part. Let me try That. It's So totally different than Richie Roma.


So. I I started it But. it didn't realize. This is Mammo And You haven to haven Time to You know ac acquire The. Taste And. Be able to live through this part. And. We had three weeks rehearsal. And I didn't haven any lines that I was able to say You know So. but at The, same time, I realized how great Jack Lemon was in this role. Yeah. And I thought, wow. I I should haven watched it before I did it, but I I didn't t know where I was on Broadway. And. That's, that's a tough, that's a tough thing to go through. but I did. I did remember that.


I said, look, I, I t know What to do here. 'cause there's times I. Don't t know What. The lines are, this is mammo Now. It's like rewriting Shakespeare. Yeah. But I. I did. I did The. I started saying things that came to me. That's my new thing. With You know. We go through various phase with You. You start. We go a little nuts. Yeah. And. then we start doing nutty things. And. Sometimes things come out of that You know You. Oh, I'm familiar. Yeah. you get a little Cherry You. Know So. But You. Start Adlibbing. Ma Mammo. Yeah. Ma. So. Now. Yeah. I thought I. don. Don't t know Why. I can't get this monologue at all. I I can't get it. And. It's don. Don't know. What how I it's written in a certain way. So I said, I can start saying my own words here.


Say The. Arch. The. Actors with me was So. Great. I mean they were, yeah. right. With it. And I. I didn't even say things on The Street. Then I started dancing on The Street. Oh my. It You started doing soft shoes. Soft shoes. Middle play. And. I. because I'm a real believer in We haven things with acting that all of a sudden, The, unconscious comes out. You free yourself. So You, your unconscious starts to You. know Express itself. Yeah. And I was walking down The Street. After. I realized that I did What. I did. I said, What. Why did I do that? And. I. Assuming Why do And. Then I said, wait a minute. My dad at who? I. Didn't t know much? And. You know that I do.


He left early, but he was a salesman. He was a salesman. And. He was a great ball. Ballroom. Dancer. So. You. Think You maybe channeled him a little bit. I channeled him. Of course, I did. Don't yell at me. How Come You don know that You. See, What. I mean You. Gotta get out. There Colin. Oh My God. Express yourself. No. But. It was interesting You know But. There's another thing I'm doing a a, a play at Shakespeare. Play at The Public Theater. And. I'm tired. And You. know. All of a sudden you're doing a performances a week. Who invented That? That's The. Worst thing that can ever happen to anybody.


Yeah. Yeah. It ruins all actors. And. I'm doing a performances And. I'm not doing really Well. So. I'm doing it, but I'm getting through it. And with me. Everything is time. I believe it's, that's Why. I love The Theater. So much because it's time. I mean I did American Buffalo over four years. I did movies in between But by The. Fourth year I didn't haven to do anything. When I went on stage, it was it It. It had, it was in your Bones. It Was in your bones. Yeah entered The. Bones. That And, I, But. I'm doing Shakespeare, And. I'm doing this haven, this huge monologue, talking to lot of people. And. I'm And. I'm tired, but it's, it's don.


Maybe a matinee on Saturday or Sunday. don don't know. And. I'm talking And. I'm talking And. I. Start thinking, wait a minute. I am repeating myself. Every line I'm saying, I've said right before So. I'm saying it twice. And. I said, oh my God. And. I'm saying The lines. And. I to me. I'm saying 'em twice. And. I'm thinking, The audience is being friendly. They're sort of scared because they think, I think this. Actor's losing it. I think, right. We're gonna haven to carry him somewhere. Take him to a hospital afterwards. He's crazy. Yeah, And, I, I got really scared. And. Then It It took me a while to recover.


I. Don't t know if I ever did But at The. End of The show. I didn't, I wasn't doing That. But. It felt like it. Wow. Oh, this is What Exhaustion on The stage means, yeah, it's You know. I mean. It really was. Especially with The. Big roles. You know So. I. Just I. Just refuse to do that. And. Then I just said, don't pay me. Don't pay me And. I'll do six a week. right. I, can Now, I do like three, right? I. Just didn. Don't tell anyone. You know one of The things. There is a thing. That happened where? because Robert De Niro came along at The. Same time. And. He's in Godfather too. And You. Talk about It. In The book, There was always this Pacino De Niro, de Niro, Pacino.


And. You said You guys were always friendly. Yeah. You admired each other's work. Yeah. You boosted each other, but of course, The Media likes to try And. Make It something. And. You say in The book. I think it's just because both of our names ended in a vowel. That. They, They That That would help. A, they, they should So in Dustin Hopman. but his name didn't ring a bell. Well, they changed it at Ellis Island from Hoffman know. Oh, Yeah. Yeah. But. I'm just curious. Like You. Finally, The. First time You worked together. You haven. It is in heat. And, You haven. That scene. And I. God. That's another movie I've seen a thousand times. And. We'll see a thousand more But.


You haven. That Scene in The Diner. Wish is such a great idea. Where You just pull over. De Niro. He's The bad guy. You're The. Good guy. You're The cop. He's The. Robber. Let's talk And. The. Two of You. Sit down. And. It's such a spectacular scene. And in The book, You reveal that. De Niro said, let's not rehearse It. Let's just do It Yeah No rehearsal. Yeah And. It's a, it's one of my favorite scenes. Wow. No. He was right. Thinking That way. It was, it was perfect. I mean to, to, to do It That way. These guy, yeah. And. And. What a great idea to haven The two characters. Let's take a second. Let's sit.


Sit down. And, tell each other who we are. Yeah. And. then we will shake hands. And go back to trying to kill each other. Yeah. Yeah. With is a beautiful light. You know What. I mean Yeah. Yeah. It is a beautiful idea. Yeah. That I thought was just, yeah. And. The fact that You just did it. That's Is That The one take or do You did it many times. Oh, many times. This is Michael Mann directing it. So. Oh, okay. right. you get to do It many times. Yeah. You were There for six years. Yeah. Yeah. Every You had long beards. At The end, they're doing a take Later. I'd like to do this. can when I come in, can I do it? Yeah. What Is that. No. As Michael Checkoff said, The great acting em Rio. He was he The actress comes in The door.


And says, oh, Dr. Maestro I really wanna be an actress. You know I really want it. I wanted It. So much. He says, Yes, go outside. Come in. can And do The? Same thing. And. I'll will tell you, if You could be an actress. Wow. can You do it? Yeah. I wanna slap him in The Face for doing that. That is So. Pompous And. Holy I. I. Don't do That. But. Somehow I was thinking, yeah, Yeah I mean Somehow. But. I'm kind of an asshole. No. Somehow it works. don, just asshole just came in my head, just Now. While I was saying it, I I said it sounds, when I, when I first heard It, I thought a lot of truth in that But Now.


I'm an old fella. And. I. Don't I think it's disconcerting. Yeah. Be honest with You. Well, You, I've gone So far this in my brain. Are You able After writing this book Now To write another? No. I'm really with it. It'll be about this show. How could I not? Yeah. I'm just curious if You are able to Now. Look back. This process had You haven to be able to look back. Now. And go.

Well, Al Pacino was just here. Let's just, That was incredible. Yeah. He's my favorite actor. Oh, he is an Actor. Oh my God. you Right. Like, who is this man? Oh, no. He, this guy. He, he is my favorite actor of all time. And. I was just So electrified that he came in And. He was So. Fantastic. It was So. Much fun. And I remembered. Just before The interview, we had this big talk. 'cause I think people were a little on edge today. Yeah. Well. It's a big day. Yeah. Day. It's big day. You don. know What. You're getting easily, easily. Aaron Blair wore a blazer. Whoa. And. Look at him. Thank You. Wish is And. And. And. And. To be. It's listen, to be fair, I read his book.


And loved It. I was rewatching movies. I was thinking a lot about Mr Pacino. Al I was, I was really preparing for this. Mm. And. Yeah. It's called Preparing some. I was gonna say, Can Preparing You. Familiar. Okay. Yeah. You didn't just walk in here. And. Just wing It. Okay. It depends. I. can I like to be prepared? It depends. You know who it is. You know when it's The. Cast of selling. The. Oc, maybe I Wing. It. But. Can't wait for That, but Shocked You know That. Oh my God. You haven. No idea. What I know. but when it's Al, Pacino, I I. don don't need to prepare. 'cause t know I. Feel like t know his career. Cold. But. it really was.


wanna read The book? And? Think about it. And. Everyone was a little, everybody was in a slightly different mode. Today. I could tell There's also 40 more people than is ever here. Oh, too. Oh, Yeah. Yeah. It was really something. Suddenly, people are here. Who haven never here before. Like, I'm here to fix The cigarette machine. Yeah. We don't haven a cigarette machine. And. That was De Niro. Yeah. Yeah. It was De Niro. And. So. We But. Then we get in here, And. We start talking about like, let's not make him wear head. You. know. Yeah. Headset, like we always do with people. Let's just But. Then we get into this classic conversation that we've had many times with Eduardo, because these are directional mics. Eduardo I. Give it up for You. You are a brilliant guy.


You built this place. Thank You. You did a wonderful job. Sometimes you're a little And for a reason. These are directional mics. Correct. But. You want. Everyone has lips to be on Mike Yes. No. He just wants people to be on Mic on. hate this, right? Yeah. He Right wants a podcast. hate this. right. know I. The. Microphone. I. Understand But. Thank You. Guys, When The police are trying to bug an apartment, they put a little bug. You know up in The lamp, And. Then they hear them saying, Yeah. Yeah. We'll kill him. Yeah. And. Then they arrest 'em. hate this Why. It's, it's very hard's. Admissible in court. 'cause it's like, well, I, they put plenty of mobsters away using The. Same technology. Anyway, we haven these microphones. That. You really need to be close to them. And. The.


Fear is that maybe You know any of these actors. That We haven on. Or anybody might just be talking And. They may lean back. They may drift from The. Mic. Philly Eilish. It's it Philly Eilish. It's happened plenty of times. So. You were saying that if they wear The headsets, they know when they're wandering away from The. Mic But. it didn't want That. So. I was trying to think of a way that we can wear headsets, because don don't wanna I. Don't wanna talk to Al Pacino while he's wearing What. Like a submarine Sonar guy would haven in a World War I movie. Yeah. I. wanna talk to Al. Pacino. So. I was hoping, let's not do That. Let's just not do That. And. Then I came up with an idea for a fix. No. With we thought was a real idea. When You were, forget And. I told these guys.


You set this up. Clearly. I set it up. Well say, guys, guys. I haven a way to fix this. It's a technological fix. And. I thinking. And. You. Guys. Were Actually looking at me like, Well. He probably does haven something. I. I. know. You were You. Probably knew I. Knew You were not serious. Okay But. it think Eduardo I was intrigued. Yeah. Blake, a thousand percent. You thought And. What about You. I just wasn't listening. Okay, So. anyway, I said, no, no. I'm really serious guys. This is What. We should do, we should get a little, just like a little clip. And. We haven. It is tied to a nylon cord. And. We clip It to them. And. It's got a, it's really secure. And You. Guys. Were still looking at me like, where's he going with this And. Then The clip attaches to like a little wheel right here. And. Then It runs underneath The table. And. Eduardo has it.


If someone starts to drift off, Mike, he can pull on It. And. They're like, Anyway. I just need to And. Suddenly we should do That. Him So. Al. Pacino would be like And. Then I was saying, You know. I was talking to, when we shot The, godfather put two I. Go. hate this. Oh, ah. Oh, And. Then Eduardo would slowly let It out. Oh, eh, Eh. But. Anyway. I said to Coppola, I. Hope It works. 'cause I'm a little worried. Now. The. Funny thing. You gotta remember about Diane Genius. Oh, oh, And. Then I'd word a lesson out, just a little bit.


But. Then T to remind him who's boss? I love The idea. So. I. Think we do this idea. can You do That? but it Actually pulls him away from The. Mic. Even better. You know What I'll haven. So. Great. You'll all haven Wires. Yes. So. I'll start Yes So. I haven. No Wires. but I'll be like, Yeah. And. Another thing. Sono Woo. Yes or, oh, well. Goly I. Think I. Love it. But. I'm just getting You. Guys are just yanking me around. Oh my God. And. All The people here is Wing Hawaii. Can we just talk about how personable he was too And, how he, he would talk.


And You know. Listeners don't know this. But There are two types of guests on The show. Those that just kind of come in. And there. Tunnel vision. They look at You. And. Then those That are like, really talk to everyone in The Room. And. He was one of those people that would just make eye contact with people. I don Know if You could tell, but I started to build a brick wall. So. That. He couldn't see You guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And. I haven. 'cause I. Keep Bricks here. Yes. I know That. And. I haven. A lathe. Yeah. And I was just quickly as a No. He was, honestly, comes from The fact. That. When You read his book, Yes, he's an iconic film star. But in his heart. He's a guy who wants to go to The theater. And work with everybody. And. Figure it out. And You can tell. That's What. He loves is he loves this kind of communal. And. I. I.


Think that's his instinct. Yeah. Is he's not here just to talk to me. He's here to haven an experience with us. Well, You know how You can tell. He is a man. The people. When his phone rang in that interview, I looked over And. His phone case is, is all Shrek heads. It's Just, yeah. Printed. Multiple sized. Shrek heads all over his Yeah. Yeah. He's a, he's a dad with Some kids know I. Love it. You know And. Iss got new dad. He's Shrek heads. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unbelievable. Yeah. And. Then his phone went off. Yeah. Yeah. Midway through The interview. That. Is that a, that's happened before. Maybe can I don I know If it but, but when it rain or My heart dropped because I was like, please don't Let it be my phone. It's usually Sona when it's Happened. Oh yeah. What. The. Fuck Is this No? No. To be fair, It was Al Pacino's phone.


But. It was Sona calling Yeah Yeah asking Who are You? Who? Well, yeah. Like can You just tell me who You are real quick? do You What Did. you act in Wish. Wish reality show. Were You in. Well keep at it, buddy. I'm sure you'll make it. I. I definitely Had You.

I'm s t know who he is. know t know You. Guys are making big between know. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we We know you Right because Matt, Matt looked at me like, Sona. do You know What? The.
