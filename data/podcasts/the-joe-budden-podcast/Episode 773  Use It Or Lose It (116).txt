I didn't have to go headed toward North Carolina to vote. I didn't have to see my cousins I grew up with to vote. I mean, I voted in my hood. You. know what I mean?


Joe button here with a few people that we gotta see where we stand after today. To my right. No voting sticker. Oh my God. Not registered. Just been having a voice. Part of the problem, not the solution. How I didn. I haven't told anybody to vote any specific way. That's the problem. I have just encouraged people. That's the problem. To exercise their constitutional rights. That's the problem, Girl. Hmm. That's The problem to vote. That's all I have said. Who Have you endorsed? I didn't endorse anybody. That's The problem. I gotta pick a side. They said using your platform the Wrong way. Oh, I know whose side I'm on, but because I can't vote. You're not on no side. Huh? A non vote is a vote for the opposition.


SI Heard Mark Lamont Hill talk me that Mark. Come on. Hill is joining us today. Hey. Yes. Yay. Moving. Right the fuck along Brother Mark. Lamar Hill is in the building. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. He got his voting stick on sir. We good? We good? Hey now whoever you voted for is your business. Me? Yes. Oh yeah, for sure. Like as long as you voted. I'm not asking what you did. When you go in the booth, you close the curtain. It don't matter if you got a pan to one side or another, you could go in there and pick somebody that nobody thinks you'll pick. And that's all right with me, my brother. So I won't ask who you voted for.


I appreciate that. Who'd you vote for? Oh. Shit. You asking me That is gonna cause another divisive fight with my man? No, it's not. It is why? Because that's where our beef comes from. Our beef or other beef comes. We got Mad Beef. There's another one. Our beef. I don't have any beef with you, but okay, I I said he think that you voted for Trump ice. Don't think that. Well go ahead. And then I said I think so too. You didn't look at him ice, you looked at me. Correct. And said, wow, you really think that? And I said yeah. And then you said you think I voted for Trump and now Mark Lamont is sounding like he think you voted for Trump.


I have questions. Alright. Get 'em off. No, no, that's the question. I mean it wouldn't shock me is all I'm saying. Why? Because I'm hearing a lot of people say they gonna vote for Trump. It's not you personally. I a lot of dudes, especially black men, I talked to, I was in the barbershop just yesterday and at least three dudes said that they voting for Trump. Oh no, no they didn't. They said they're not voting for Kamala. So I'm, I'm assuming they're voting for Trump. They didn't seem like Green party people. Was it the lemon trick? Lemme what's that? Was that the Nah, I don't know. I don't know. That. is that like the lemon tree? Is that some fancy like no suburban shit? I just moved there. I just moved to Jersey in the mall. It's the white people shit. Oh that's like the Haircuttery and some shit. Okay. Super. But super cut.


I was, I was, I, matter of fact, I was in the barbershop and they was, they asked me if I knew Ish, Oh, Shit Oh Shit. And you. I just spoke to him last night again. No, that's what I texted. That's what made me text him. I was at the barbershop. They was selling Ish stories. They was like, yo Joe podcast yo. I was like, yeah. They was like, oh you know, tell Ish I said what up? I know Ish. I know Ish was back in the day, blah blah. Telling these fucking hood stories about Ish. Well you drove to Virginia to get a haircut. That's what the fuck what's going on. I was at seven's barbershop in, was that South orange? South orange. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Nigga said they was voting for Trump. So you wouldn't be surprised if I said I was voting because you've heard other black men say that. Yeah. Yeah. More than normal. I'm not dumb. That's true. I'm not dumb.


I look down on them. I frown upon them. You know what I mean. I don't know much about politics, but It is bad. S not point. I, I mean like I'm not here to have the political back and forth but dumb. I just can't, I drove, can't I draw the line somewhere? Yo, you stupid. Yo, sorry, sorry, sorry. So you think that's my bag? That's what the R word. You think That's my bag. I can side with them. I think that you have a love for, how do I say this without getting you to attack me for re not conservatism.


Yeah. Thank you. I don't even know what that means. I think you have a love for conservatism that I don't, again, I can't even reply 'cause I don't know what that means and I don't know how to explain it. So we're at impasse. Cool. Do you believe in like traditional family values? I think that's bullshit. I think that the tradition, the traditional family values that people speak of, they sway him at their convenience. Hmm. So I don't think that shit is real. So he might not be a conservative, you know, I'm not a conservative, you know, tough one. The economy, big military, all that kind of shit. I'm not conservative at all. So why is he, why is he, why? Why does he do that to you? I ask him again my brother.

You know, not that the, not the therapist when this weak but the like the kind of therapist that You know what I mean. Four For married couples, four Months actually will have to leave.

I think somebody could say that to you and get you, they can't. I'm smart enough to know better one, they can't lower my taxes. I'm not into 1%.

When the police rolled up in Brooklyn to take the pond that they, that the hood niggas made. Oh, that Little co pond. They cemented over that shit. Them police went over there, scoop them little dead fish out. Them white people came and just started filming you a cement on the pond, huh?


Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, what? Yeah, That's correct. They cemented up the Koy pond. Yes. White people were Like in Brooklyn. This is terrible. Brooklyn in the Bronx somewhere was a Beacon of hope for our neighborhood. It was a big deal. It was a big deal. Mad fish. They was coming out the hood, niggas feeding them every morning. Oh, white people killed This shit out them fish. You can't, niggas have no joy in the Fuck that you ain't giving you. They came back and rebuilt it bigger and better. Some bigger fish in there. And hopefully the cops don't treat the fish like black people. Damn. Going there. Throw a little side nine in the pool. That's how Central Park was built.


Well, you in your bag. You in your back. A political park. You in your bag today. Yo. Got you. Yo. Who taught her that one? That's hell what? Forget it. It's quality land right here. You niggas got what they knocked on the door for. They game option. Yo. You better get outta here by seven. So that's option. Okay. You can leave now. Don't be here when we come back. It is guys, It is a fool, fool. This is not fun at all. Yeah, we ain't shut. Oh my Lord. Did I introduce people? Yes, yes. No, you stopped their parts. But it's okay. Oh. yeah. you say gang, the gang is here, man, everybody's here. All these niggas. Corey ain't voting, ain't talking to him. Ericson. I'll keep it quiet.


He doesn't have on a sticker. Oh. That's all I'll say about that one. There's a lot of non-ST stickers over there. All of all of the fucking black people that have been screaming Trump, Trump, Trump. All of my niggas. Y'all ain't gonna vote y'all. Y'all just been talking that Trump shit. And y'all buddying buddying up with the white non voters as if it's gonna have the same effect. Y'all, the niggas gonna get killed. Them white niggas gonna be Chilling somewhere. Soon as Trump get in, I hate to tell you, they bringing out the new bow and arrows and everything. The asshole in me kinda want 'em to win. So I could look at every person I argue with and be like, now what, what changed for you now? Now what? You fucking idiot. Now what? By the time y'all listen to the, to this podcast, we might know something.


This is gonna come down to a tiny little town. Shaq, Chattanooga, no, Pennsylvania. They saying it's gonna be the one. It's gonna be Philly. They said Pennsylvania's gonna, or maybe Virginia. That divide. That really sets it though, still. Even with Meek's endorsement, endorse of the day before. That's good though. You know? That's good. You don't want people to forget. I was about to say, the people who would listen to Meek are probably not gonna remember two weeks later. That's racist. That's true. That's a good point. So that's definitely racist. It is young. We prisons in the moment. You know what I mean. We don't even remember who won. So I'm glad Meek said something. Shout out to Meek. I'm glad he said Somethingm glad he spoke out. And I'm glad he made his voice heard. 'cause now I think there are a lot of people who weren't gonna come out and now they, they're gonna come out to the polls.


That's a good point. Yeah. I, I respect that. Pennsylvania's crucial. Pennsylvania's crucial. And Philadelphia's crucial because white people don't elect Democrats. Black people do. Brown people do. Like no Democratic president. No Democratic Democrat has won the presidency with a majority of white vote since the 1960s. So if you win the presidency as a, as a Democrat, you gotta get a lot of black people and a lot of brown people. So, so come out. So in Pennsylvania's Pittsburgh, I'm, I'm just pointing. You just steal his face. Pittsburgh. That's Philly and Ohio. It's gonna be places like Columbus Cleveland. So you gotta get people out in mic in Detroit, you know, to, to win Michigan. So I'm glad I want all, all the rappers should be coming out telling people to come out and vote. I agree. That's exactly who we need to hear from during this critical time.


Nah, I agree with that. Unfortunately, they, they have some influence. Yeah. That's what they, that's what they listening to. So yeah. I don't even want them to tell people who to vote for. I don't need know political analysis. I just want them to tell people to show up to the poll, to vote. To show up. Yeah, just vote. Yep. Just get out and show up. I agree. I agree.

Mark was answering. You shouldn't do it in anyone's home. So I mean we have enough bathrooms that I, I don't have to share my, my toilet with nobody. Okay.


If it's brown, you flush it down always. But to say to preserve water and to be good to the environment. Yeah you, you could. You could get a few. A few if few nigga. So that water bill used to be lower. Niggas used to rock out. Yeah. Just flushing shit into I don't have to do that. Oh, you all come from the real thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They come from, I must have had a good, they come from the ghost face. All I got is you popping some cereal box. That was my song too. But some of the shit in there I could not relate to. You flush whenever you wanted. You flush when you use the bathroom. Just willy nil, witty, just yes. Yeah. Wow. Mike give a courtesy flush if I'm in there fucking it up bad enough. Again. Ships are a whole other thing. If you do a courtesy polish, We're just talking.


They're just talking about urination. Just Urination. So like sometimes I flush it and try to finish piss. I be racing This shit. So Do you like flush in the middle of the night too? Yeah. Because that could be a time where you just like, kind of let it rock. You better let that thing rock man. And let your entire bathroom smell like urine. Well close The lid. You Close the lid. You think that stops a urine smell? Where you got your, you got as toilet so wrong. Where you get this doctorate from? That don't quite work like that guys. It do man. You get a little spray, you good. It ain't never flush. And then try to hurry up and finish before the water go down. Like you race the shit. Yeah, but I was six. I ain't 12 ice. Yes you are. Yes you're, yes you're, it's the six year roses that you gotta remind to flush the toilet.


If you don't use it, you lose it. Alright. And I read a little meme 'cause that's where I get all my info from as a 44-year-old. And I read a little meme that said men are supposed to sit down and piss because of how the pisses up. And it targeted the four spots that men typically aim for in the toilet and how the piss bounces up. Shit. Nasty. Nasty. It looks like the, they cut the blue disgusting. They cut the blue lights. The the, that shit is nasty. That shit was nasty. Your as you supposed to close the lid before you flush the toilet. Why are we not civilized? I never do that. I wanna, you supposed no supposed to. I wash it because they said the, the fecal matter and all that shit jumps out the bowl too.


The same way sprays just sit and pee. I don't know if I can do it. Yeah. Oh, try it. Oh I do it Do you? Oh. Oh. I it I do it. I I know the jokes. I know the jokes. Gonna, you never sat and pee?

You what? Oh my. Alright. So Hot Boys reunion. Hot boys. Big time. Tossing it to our number one hot boy. Number one starter right there. Take it away. Take it away buddy. Yeah.


Over the weekend. Wayne had his, I forget what year this is now, but it's It is, it's 2025. No, It is not. And it's not, it's not even that like how many years he's done it. I mean, but he had his Louisiana festival out in New Orleans. The the advertised part part was the Hot boys and the big timers were all reuniting on stage. You know, y'all know BG came home last year. Mm. So he's missed the previous festivals. They had the little shit at Essence Fest where they had a hot, a hot Boys reunion without Wayne. Mm. So now this time they all came out and they were doing old records from the Gorilla Warfare album.


From Juvies first album from bg. Early albums. Like this was, they all used to be in a group. Shut up, you know, big timers, albums. This was shit like me, myself, I was in the crib going crazy. I loved every minute of this. They went through the hits and then, you know, they left the stage and then Wayne came back and soloed that shit out and he smoked it. Mm mm Unpopular opinion. What? That he smoked it. But he smoked. He did a good Lil Wayne job. But. yeah. It feels a little bit disrespectful of a carry on. Look, I, I enjoyed it. 'cause I, I'm a Lil Wayne fan. Don't sound like it. And I enjoyed the reunion.


I thought that was the best part. Even more so than the Lil Wayne thing. For sure. Absolutely. I think where it went off the rails for me just a little bit is that people started talking about, you know, this is why he should be at the Super Bowl. This is proof, this is an epic. Before it wasn't an epic performance at all. It was, I mean the sound was kind of bad. You know, he didn't forget the lyrics. But. yeah, the teleprompter. There was a teleprompter there. I don't like, I I saw everybody. Yeah. Ice. You said he can't remember his lyrics there. There's a big ass teleprompter that did. It was karaoke for the most part. Not, not a shot at Wayne. Not saying that he stood there reading the lyrics, but you have that reminder there in real time. So you could look at the screen and you know, keep your pace. Yeah. It just, nothing wrong with that. I'm not talking about none of that Super Bowl.


I'm just saying for this show, for a a was it a good performance? Did you just like the songs he, he wrote? Yeah, I was gonna, I liked both because I thought he, I just liked the songs. I liked the songs. I liked everybody there. I li I the moment I liked Master P coming out on stage being one of the ones to, after the mayor gave him the key to the city master P. So you do know who gives away the key. He did, he did get a key there. He did get a key. He got key. He got a key to the city. Andy got a day. He gotta keep to the, he and he got two days. He got, he got two days. Oh, Wayne, whatever. Yeah, they gave him two days. That's what's up. So I like these moments of I don't have a day. I was about to say, do you have a day? Oh you got a good day, can you vote? I was say, I'm gonna let you rock.


But what I'm saying, he killed it. The song selection was great. The, they sounded like I rapped along with the songs. I ain't miss a beat. He picked mix tape records, album cuts, hit commercial singles. Like he touched everything. Pause that you would wanna see from Wayne. Yeah. So I say he killed that. Now when you enter that Super Bowl conversation that everybody has, I say if you look at this and still think that he would've done great at the Super Bowl, you're lying to yourself. Why? It's a contradiction. No, no, no. It is, this is great for this stage, not that stage. It's like saying somebody could do something real good here, but if you put them on another platform or something, it won't translate the same.


Yeah. So Regionally it works nationally it would not or Internationally. This was great for Lil Wayne. This was great for New Orleans, this was great for his festival. This was great for this moment. I don't think that this same moment translates to the worldwide audience that the Super Bowl brings. Right. Which has been my critique about Wayne's Super Bowl from the rip. Does he even have the He does not have the records. That's what I was about to ask you for the Super Bowl. Now remove the Super Bowl. I can still acknowledge that. This was great to see this was a moment. This was historic. Well, and I loved it so culturally it was dope. But you said he smoked the performance. He smoked that entire Louisiana Festival concert. He smoked the sequencing. I want to know, it may be tough for some people to remove the Super Bowl aspect when he's up there doing his Super Bowl speech.


And I'm gonna play that now. I hated this but go ahead. First during my lifetime, the first Super Bowl was here. I made sure I bought tickets at the beginning of the season. And you know, I did the same when I moved to Miami. And I was wishing my team make it. And guess who made it that year? The Motherfucking Saints. No joke. They won't make it this year. Don't worry about that. And that's not his team. My mama that he's a ERs fan. Nah. Ain't ERs fan. She's Able to bring my family and other people from New Orleans and they had a fucking ball that moment. I said to myself, I want to be on stage for the Super Bowl one day in front of my mom.


And I worked my ass off to get that fucking position news away from me. I hate this But this motherfucking moment right here. They can't take that man. They can't take that from me. Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for yourself for being amazing. I hated everything. I didn you. I hated every minute. Minute. Why didn't you like that moment? You playing a victim role? Damn near. What if he feels like a victim? How would you feel like? Well, there's one part we don't know.


'cause I don't like when he keep, when he says this was snatched from me. Right. I don't like that. We haven't seen anything. Now whether he had a conversation behind the scenes with Ho or somebody who told him he might be in in the running or considered for it, we don't know. We never saw the shortlist of what you're saying. We never saw anything where they said you had the Super Bowl. Right. So what is snatched from you? It was assumed by you and a lot of your fans and a lot of the public. Like I told y'all right, last year after the, the game when they announced New Orleans and everything, we started to see the memes go around. Oh, they gotta pick Wayne. They gotta pick Wayne. I think a lot of people, I think Wayne himself believed that.


Yep. Yeah. They gotta pick me. Yeah. But I don't think that, that, that's not snatched away from him. That's entitlement. I don't believe. Well that's all I'm saying. He may be entitled. So I don't want to sound like I'm arguing that, and maybe I don't like this announcement either, but I don't think he's operating off of what fans and memes said. I agree with that too. I mean he could believe the, the same I think that he had. No, but I think it's based from something. It's based on I feel like me, I ain't spoke to nobody. I ain't got no facts. I think he did. I think he definitely spoke to HOV or somebody on that board that's committees in charge of that. I think they may have told him, laid out a guideline of things that the person they pick has to accomplish and do.


I think he might've went and went about trying to check some of the things off that list. And maybe he didn't like how that he found out the news that Kendrick was performing. Which is maybe you found out when the rest of us found out. And if that happened then I could see him feeling like, or feeling bold enough to say, Hey, it was snatched from me. I don't think he's just working off of this was in New Orleans. I'm me This shit happen. I mean, I think that the Dr. Dre la situation got people starting to associate artists with town, with the town. But that's a ridiculous way to, to pick somebody. You want to pick the biggest, hottest, most important artists at that moment. Or a legend. I don't want somebody, 'cause damn, if somebody comes to Philly, I don't wanna assume Pink is going to be there or Beanie Siegel or you know, or Meek Miller, whoever.


Right. I want if if whoever the biggest person is, that's who I want. And I think we shouldn't even start to think about associating the artists with the town, especially for the Super Bowl. And I feel like amongst artists, I mean, or in entertainment, a lot of things can get lost in translation. A lot of things could get, it's the phone game by the time this message get to you, how it got to you versus what really happened. There's, there's a chance for some slippage. True. Very true. Happens every day. I'd like to see Wayne part of a performance in New Orleans. I think that would be amazing. I don't think he should be headlining a performance in New Orleans. And I feel like all the speeches and monologues It is taking him even outta consideration for being part of any of that.


But I feel like that's a deal breaker. He's not gonna be a part of the performance perform. He, He has to be the headliner performance. Yeah. And that's wild to me. Kendrick was gonna bring out Wayne, he should come out. I mean, that'd be a, to me, a crown in achievement. Kendrick was not bringing out Wayne. It's It is a for example, you know, he wasn't, but It is, It is a, for example, although it would be kind of Ill, I I think Wayne wouldn't come out. I think Kendrick might invite, but the same way Wayne is documented in interviews saying, if I get my chance to do Super Bowl, that's my spotlight. And I'm not, I don't plan on sharing it with everybody. I think people feel like that. I don't think that I don don't kenrick, like Kendrick already shared the stage with all of these millions of people in LA That, but that's, that's my point. It's my turn. It's my time to shine now. So I It's almost like paying your dues a little bit. Not saying Wayne has to, but if Kendrick had that mindset, there's no, there's no saying that he gets this shot where it's, nah, I'm not letting, I'm not letting nobody bring me out.


Like I'm, I'm not sharing the stage with nobody. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? So yeah, I'll play this role today. I'll sit here and let y'all bring me out today. But when my time come, then I can do that. Yeah, that's a good point. But if, if, so you're saying if Kendrick would've had he played the game mental? Yeah. Yeah. He's saying he played the game. I think he had no choice. He did have choice. You do mean you have a choice always. But if Dr. Dre, you're from LA and Dr. Dre and Snoop call you and say, yo, I want you to perform in the Super Bowl with us. That is celebrating in highlighting Los Angeles. You get your ass on that stage. Right. It so now it's not as simple as that though. But, but let's just, let's just for this sake. Now. Now, alright, great. Dre and Snoop called. I accepted it.


Now they gotta go run it up a board. That board says yes to me, Kendrick. So now I have the opportunity to do that a thousand percent. We don't know that that's the case with Wayne. Oh no, no, no. I know. I'm saying we don't know if there's even something, some something or somebody blocking him from that door being opened. No, we just, don Dunno, I'm not, I'm not even speaking to him. I'm just speaking to us saying that Wayne might have the mindset of I don't wanna share that stage. I just want it to be me. Like we said, if Kendrick were to even invite him, he may not go. I say that's a mistake. I say, Hey go. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? Show that you play your Super Bowl might not have to be New Orleans. So what? You might get the Super Bowl two years from now in fucking Detroit somewhere or something. So still fire. Yeah.


That's my thing. It is just, people attach the city to that because like Mark said, because of the LA situation, people attach it. Okay, it's New Orleans, it has to be this. Oh, next year is Atlanta. It gotta be somebody from No it don't, it ain't, it ain't never been that until then. And that's not how it goes. Yeah. Yeah. That's all traditional. And it might just not be that. 'cause I think everybody wants this to be a conspiracy. You know, this is the philosophical principle. Sometimes the simplest explanation is the, is the, is the most likely one. Like maybe people just don't think he'd be good. That's what I think That is. I ain't wanna say that. But. yeah. I wouldn't necessarily say that Kendrick just had the best year. Damn hell outta any musician out. But take Kendrick off the table. Do you think Lil Wayne will put on a good Super Bowl level performance?


I think he has. I say no. I think he has the ability to do so. I think the Super Bowl is 13 minutes and I think that if Wayne took the, the Super Bowl performance seriously as I think he would, I think that Wayne could put on a 13 minute performance. That would be dope. I don't think the time is the problem. I think again, the per the performance aspect for the Super Bowl and the records that you need for the Super Bowl. I don't think Wayne has that for the Super Bowl. For the Super Bowl. Right. We get agree This shit, I have to just, we had to reiterate, especially if he bring on the pop stars because he got some features with pop stars that you can bring on. But then you gotta bring the pop star on. He has a, he don't wanna do that. Who said, I just don't think the juice is worth the squeeze to continue to shit on the Super Bowl.


Yeah. You act like this is the end. Like my nigga, you could get a Super Bowl next year or the year after or whatever the case may be. Yeah. I would want to keep the door open no matter how much you I'm, I don't I wanna burn that bridge right now. Yeah. Not now. It is burnt. Not while, not while they re-upped hold the fucking run the decision making for the next however many years. Nah, I I think I'm still at that dance game and, and and we don't know how true It is or not, but I take that in this conversation too. What the dude said that was with the Grammys. Like, yo, we had Wayne, he didn't show up for the rehearsals. He didn't like, once you start to get that type of reputation reputation, you performance this big people and, and yeah, this is the performance Super Bowl. Right. So once That is attached to you, oh yeah.


Nah, we can't fuck him. I just don't like this because It is borderline of shot. Not that he would be shooting personally. I just think it, it kind of discredits what Kendrick has done all year. That's why I don't like it. Well that's important too. That's why I don't like it. Like dog Kendrick Lamar had a hell of a year and, and we want to highlight that. I just think that it, it discredits that. That's what I, that's what I really like about it. Like I see, I see Wayne doing all this. He's gonna put himself on the Kanye list to me when it comes to the Super Bowl, Kanye would, the Kanye would smoke the Super Bowl, but they would never give him the opportunity because now it's like we don't know what we are gonna get. He got the music, he got the show. We know that. Yeah. But now we don't know what else we're gonna get with you.


And when with Wayne, we don't know you're sitting here. You, you, you, I don't think he's a victim yourself. Yeah. Kanye's a whole other level of over there putting it over there. You you get on the wrong side of them. People you will never get that shot. Different Reasons for unpredictability but still the same outcome. Yeah. But One's like It is, I'm just one. You know what that show would look like. That's why I don't like it. Yeah. You know what, that Kanye Super Bowl show would 1000%. It would be one the best. It would be one of the best ever. Well, oh, you said one of the best. One of the best ever. Yes. He don't have a purple ring. He, he might not need it Joe. No. That's why I agree he won't eat it so he'll be one of the best.


But per ran Purple Rain when he was doing Purple Rain on a purple guitar. Yeah, that was definitely top three. Yeah. Yeah. It was top one. No. No. Oh. What's your number one Madonna? What happened? What's your number one king of pop? Michael Jackson. The who? You heard of him? The king of pop when he had the whole fucking stadium singing. We Are The World had fucking kids from Africa floating in, dropping down Pan Pando. Alright, that's Michael Jackson Got it. Here you go. Michael Jackson. Don't get him started. Michael Jackson was Panda King. We're not doing that today in Quincy. Yeah, we're not You know what I mean. We're not, we're not. That's terrible idea. No. Imagine how Michael would've sound without Quincy. I tell he sounded without Quincy. I'll tell, I'll tell you what Quincy Jones told me about that. He said, can you see him stutter on us real quick? Love it.


No, because he was, he was 15 when that album dropped. I was still two. What'd you say, mark? I really don't like him until I started working. I didn. I actually don't like him. It's crazy. That's what happens with everybody now. I understand. Now I understand. That's crazy. What he said is bad was Michael Jackson. He he said that, he said, this is exactly what he said. He said on on Thriller. I sorry, on Off. the Wall. We were in the studio together and that's why it sounded so good. He said with Off, the Wall, we were together. He said with Thriller, we were in separate, we were, we were in separate studios, but we were still working together. He said bad. Mike had his own thing.


And then I was following up and he said the reason bad didn't sound, didn't have the soul that the first two had was. 'cause that's what Michael sounds like without me basically. No bad. That is my favorite. I'm y'all about to say s not bad was your favorite? Yeah. Oh bad. It is a lot of people. My favorite Prince turned that down. Y'all are crazy. Prince didn't want I'm okay with being crazy. Yeah, I'm fine with that. Y'all think bad is better than Off? the Wall, I like it more. It's my favorite album. God. Absolutely. I'm just surprised. I've never heard, I've never been in a room full of people that said that before. I heard people. I get that thriller is overrated to people. Like Thriller is not the best one. Thriller is not overrated. I mean, I'm talking in terms of it's ranking among Michael's album. Okay. A lot of people say it's number two, not number one. Yeah. To me it's Off the Wall thriller and bad. Okay. I'm I'm going with that.


There's nothing wrong with that. Opposite, opposite direction. But I don't think there's an incorrect answer out of those three projects. That is true. That's the problem. You think there's a wrong answer? I do. I think bad is always the wrong answer. I think there's some people out there that need to go take another peek at that bad track list. Bad is amazing. Even the title check. Do you like listening to the song Bad? The song Bad? Have you ever wanted to hear the song Bad? I do want to hear bad. No, y'all don't. Yeah, but that don't change anything for me. You really wanna hear Dirty Diana? Yes, I do. Crazy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No on Big Dog. Big dog. Big dog. Whoa, whoa.

Listen, listen, listen. Now we read 'em. I'm ready Y'all How y Bad is a better album than Off. the Wall. Y'all say this. Maybe I show my age. Put the songs on Off, the Wall that hit hit way harder. Songs on the songs Off the Wall that hit Hit Harder than all other songs from any other album ever made. That's the conversation. That's Off the Wall. But that's my argument with the Usher Confessions versus 87 0 1. I'm a 87 0 1 dude. But the songs that On Confessions that hit, they hit My Opinion.


You get what I'm saying? Arguing. That's a good, those those songs on Off. the Wall. I take confessions. I take confessions. But I see your point. But there are people that say that so I won't shame him. People say that like Dog, the 87, I mean the the the songs on Off, the Wall that hit, they hit bro. Like It is more than five. It's a, it's a good seven. It's a good seven that are really just, I feel like Off the Wall Timeless Smashes Bro. Illmatic versus it was written. Yeah, A little bit. A little bit. It kind of It is, I'm sorry. Where do y'all land on that? I, I'm late to the game. It was written Matic. Y'all All Take It was written. I take it. I take it was written. I take matic. I'm I'm Matic. Me too. It was Matic Thank. you. I'm Matic Thank you. But alright. It was why thanking him for having this. It was written thank him didn didn't wanna be isolated.


Them little late Night Talks been working on said the same thing I did. Don't album. I don't listen. If, if you would've didn't Vote Today, album Shaming Me. I don't like it. Yo. No, you album Shaming Me. It was written You Deserve album. Classic album. But Illmatic was just time. It was just Illmatic is one to me. One of the five or six best albums in hip hop history. No, in music in other 20th century for me, I Mad had changed Hip hop. I Got, it was written as a better album. It is, it's a much better album, huh? To me. Nah, I mad is no, it was written. I mad had cut off. I mad had cut off before my shower was finished. Illmatic works if I'm in the shower. You gotta start Conserv some water buddy. I count. If I look during the water, drought, the drought watch then.


Yeah, it's just, it's just, it's It is the best EP ever made to me. I think if you listen to most of the better albums of the 20th century, they short. They're short. They're short. Yeah. I disagree with that. Love Supreme. A lot of these, most of the classic Albums are under like around 30 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. A record used to only be able to hold 35 minutes, bro. You just named so albums that had 11 songs. What el Well these mic albums. Yeah. Like and they're some of the best albums ever created when they started doing the 18, 19 songs. I think you, you throw, you throw some filler in there. Prince was Low. A record could only hold 35 minutes and instead sound good. Yeah. You could max it out to 40. But that was like really bad quality. So. Gotcha. Most albums were 30 minutes or under on vinyls, right?


Yeah. Yeah. And if all albums were single albums except for a few and Then there was like a side and B side. So like they put like the lesser known records I guess like on the B side? No, not necessarily. That's a single s That that's Can I ask, can I ask the expert, his opinion? The B side thing comes from singles not from albums. Okay. Stupid. Y'all bullies Manall. It is this, It is not y'all. It is not y'all. But now I don't like Mark. He called us bullies and nobody said anything. It is just implied the silence. He's a doctor. You just Know if going, he, he Watched.


We Gotta shut up. He watches the, that's all. That's all. Oh, he think the same thing. He just ain't wanna say it. All I'm saying is yeah, all I'm saying is Illmatic don't include him in your bullshit. Don't, don't fucking include him in your bullshit. He, He, He still fresh and critically thinks on his own. Okay. He, He said some shit though. Yo. She was like, no, I think he was like point exactly like, yo, that's a shot. But it's cool. I didn. Listen, we all been watching the game and like how many plays is the touchdown? Like alright, six girl six just six. I never asked that fucking question. Don't put that shit on me. You Knew it. Oh you opened yourself up for another Yes.


Y'all dog. I'm skipping it. I'm skipping it. I'm skipping it because they gonna call me a bully. Mark gonna say I'm doing some shit. I'm skipping it. That was a good shot. Good shot. Skip the shot Mel. You gonna leave it? What Else? You skip it too, nigga. Shut up. I'm telling her to stop. Oh. Alright. Just that one particular question. Yeah, I know the fucking answer to that question. Just the Left. What? Just go the left anyway, but Oh, just Signal Horn. Are y'all done with your thoughts on the Wayne Fest? Yeah. He, so yeah, shout to Wayne Man. Shouts to Wayne. Shout to Hot Boys, big timers, all of that. That was really the Hot Boys. The hot boy. That felt good here. What? That did feel good to hear.


What? come on Dog. I ain't here. Huh? You ain't here, huh? I didn't hear. Huh? Didn't do. Yeah. Wow. Niggas ain't doing Huh? Not Hot Boy record. That's shit. So it's a juvie record. Juvie record. It is the Juvie record. Everyone have full solo moments. Yes. It's the juvie record. No it's not. It is not the juvie record. Yeah. It is, you are outta your mind one of two. Everybody is not a no Limit soldier like you and a and a and and a new y'all. Y'all, y'all are aware that back that Ass Up. It is a juvenile song. Right? That's what I was say back that ass up is the juvie song. Alright, so that's the ju record right before That is the That is the production record. That's right.


That is first record. But when you say the juvenile record, it's back that ass up. It's not close. And That is a, it's not close. It's by Yeah, It is, It is nowhere near. It's not close. Okay. It ain't better in slow motion. I'm trolling you. Sorry. Don't fall. Don't fall. Yo y'all too easy to make Fall for the tracks. Cool man. I didn't see the stream. What did y'all think about Jermaine Dupree and everybody else tweeting during the stream that Drake missed out? I would've, yeah. Drake had business to handle. He was in Toronto standing on business one day. Y'all niggas out there is gonna gimme a legit definition for stand on business.


Boy. It changes Literally standing like the whole game like It was the corn shut up seat. Let me say this first. Drake's not wrong for feeling a way. Right. If I think we are cool. And then the next thing, I know you Crip walking in the video that calls me a pedophile. I have a right to feel a way about Thousand percent about. Absolutely. For sure. However, at the point that I'm going to do something about it, I gotta actually do something about it. I can't just show up to the game and mean Mug you the whole time. Except it's not a mean mugging. That's him doing something about it. And his view, what's his view? Is he doing his mean mugging Then he walked past Pussy ass nigga.


Oh, that was the worst part. Really? Because you would think from the me because first of all, all the, all the, the Drake Botts put it out first as if like he, he said that shit to homie me like in front of him. Like, yo fuck outta pussy. That's what I thought he did. It was like, fuck runner punch. Like dude was always a half court by the time he said that shit. That dude was at a concession stand by then. Yeah. Like that's, to me, that just made This shit look worse. And you already look like you overthinking this. You already look like you feel a way about this too much. You already look, already look over emotional about this and going to the game, trying to be fucking bird, bird from Butter Rim. Like don't, yo, I'm not mad at Drake feeling the way about this. I'm not mad at Drake feeling way iur and just being over emotional. They resurfaced the clip where DeMar de Rose was on Club Sheha and he's explaining how Drake was there for him when nobody else was Drake held him down.


That's my mans, that's always gonna be my man. So with all of that going on, if you step on the other side, especially with, with what they were calling him and you take part in that, you in the video and you, you doing a a little bit extra. Yeah. Like Russell Westbrook, LeBron, they were at the pop out show. No. Yeah. They wasn't in the not like Us video. You went to Drake after you were trading. What, what, what did you guys talk about? Man, we just, we just really sat there and, you know, the, besides basketball, everything, just the reassurance of like, you know, that was my, that was my, my partner that was a friend that was a friend of mines that was like, man, get away from everything.


I know. It's crazy. I couldn't even turn on TV that day. Phone was going crazy. I just went over there and we, we sat, sat and talked for hours eight setting and talk. And I think more than anything, just him being there for me as a friend. Right. First and foremost, you know, and, and no matter what, you know, when it come to him, he'll forever have a friend and me and loyalty out of me because you know, he, he cared. Yeah. He was there for, for you. He was there for me. When, when, when everything was just going crazy. Right. You know, it kind of just got me settled in a sense of like, you know, you gonna get past it don't even work. So what had happened. Right. That's so if I, if I have that relationship with somebody and you popping out over here, yeah.


I'm gonna have a problem with you and it's gonna, I'm, I'm gonna forever have a problem with and he's a thousand percent accurate And I'm gonna climb up to the rafters and pull down your little banner. That's the shit I ain't like man, nigga, I'm the mayor. Shit. That's what he, your shit is never gonna get in the rafters. Yeah, that's he's saying. I promise you it will though. That's like some over my dead body type shit. Shit. It will be over his dead body. Hey listen, you know the power I got out here. Y'all ain't doing that. We sports fans. Right. I remember when DeMar DeRozen got traded, he was fucked up. He said, yo, they betrayed me. He went publicly like, yo, y'all told me that y'all wasn't trading me. He felt betrayed all that other shit and he was kind of distraught. So if that's true, if, if that's true, It is true.


And now I'm I know. I'm just going put the Joan ain't Got it if it It is true. Yo. So now you come to me, you fucked up and I'm your real friend. Like you, we don't know these niggas coulda had mad social interactions with off, off camera off the court. This is my man, man nigga. I'm in Toronto. I'm in Toronto. This nigga's the mayor of Toronto. Basically. I'm one of them niggas in Toronto. This is my man, man. So Doug, we that's, I that's where, where I wanna push back a little bit. We from, and maybe I'll just do it for Cory. You have not one empathetic bone in your body. You have not an emotional in your fucking serial killer. Holy shit. Just, just for shits and giggles. I'm gonna try to do this back and forth.


True. I'm not saying I feel like this Don't attack me. No I'm not. Yeah. So all of that's true. Yes. I do believe that Drake and DeMar der Rosen had some form of a real relationship. Gotcha. Like a real, real friendship. Friendship. Yeah. Not an industry. You saying man, no, no, no. Gotcha. You saying Man's man's cool. What happens when my man's times three pulls up though? Like, like you like understandable. Lemme talk. You sent ice to Burlington Coat Factory when Danny pulled up. I did not. That's not true. That's not true. I don't think. That's not talk. That's a fact. Lemme finish my That's the joke. But let me joke. But we not joking, we being serious. No, that's, I'm being, I'm joking even I'm serious, but lemme get my shit off fact I to steal your man.


But he had to take that walk to the, to the store and get you some jeans. Car y talking about. That's not what happened. But nigga went to the car. My premise is, all right, that's your man. But you from Compton, you go on songs with this dude you have videos with. That's my, maybe that's my man man man. I understand. What'd you say to that? Still stay neutral. Right? Stay out of it. I'm gonna stay neutral. You don't gotta stay neutral. I'm gonna stay neutral. He asking my but my opinion is Got it. That's it. Don't have a follow up question. Look, it's niggas that if one of my friends wanted to beef with ice, right? If I can't mediate it, like yo, that's my man. Like get the fuck outta here. Y'all not beefing. Y'all not arguing.


At the very minimum I'm gonna be neutral in that, in that situation. I'm not gonna show support for one of the dudes. I wanna respond to that. And when the one dude that, like if, if, if Kendrick had a song not attacking Drake, right? But they still beefing and I'm in the song that's talking about some girls or some money. It's one thing my nigga you are in a song. That is calling me a pedophile. In our, in our culture, it's the worst thing you can be. I think in every culture. I think in every culture think that's over. I think that part is over. You're bugging. I do. I think there's worst thing somebody could call you than a pedophile. I'm listening like what snitch in our culture. Maybe a snitch. No, no not snitch. There's nothing worse. It's probably not worse. No, there's nothing worse.


Yeah. Pedophiles for Kenny it kind of It is pretty Yeah but it's number one. But stop. But this is where my pushback comes from. Not mine. I'm just arguing on we're objective. I think that Drake takes not like us really, really serious as he should. And I think that's him and his people spreading that, hey y'all niggas is dancing to some shit that's calling me a pedophile. That's not him and his people. Joe. Just hear me out. I think him and his team look at it like that. And while it could be true, I think a lot of West Coast people just took a West coast pride in that song.


Agree. I don't think some people take that song as serious as him. I would agree. So I agree with all that. I agree everything. You more dero didn't know the extent of which Drake felt. It don't matter Maybe. Maybe he didn't look at it like some big crossing of the line. Ice has always stayed neutral in my beefs. I'm gonna give you all of that. Lemme talk. Ice has always stayed neutral in my beefs. When I beef with his brother. He tweeted one morning. I think A got him and maybe they could be, I don't know he did, but he tweet I No he didn't. It don't matter. I just tweeted that and they brothers mean he was supposed to tweet that. But that's not neutral.


I also don't think it's that serious enough to like, what am I beefing with my man about it. That's and a called me some nasty things. Two things. D totally two It is different. Two. Two totally different. I know I'm just shooting you. No, I'm, yeah. Two things. If all of that stuff you're saying is true, if you know now in hindsight that your man felt like that, then you pick up the phone and you address that with your man. I would. Right. Cool. And I think if y'all had a conversation amongst adults and amongst men, then Drake don't still feel like that. You get what I'm saying? Like if we having a serious conversation, then Drake don't necessarily feel like it. I also think Drake is the type to not answer the phone after I hit unfollow on LeBron and all these niggas.


It's possible because I do think that some people that really love him, IE LeBron and some other names, I'm sure they tried to reach out to him. Why didn't he show up to LeBron's game him the night before? He do the same shit. What Missy, the Lakers game. Was the Lakers playing Toronto? Yeah, it LeBron was in Toronto the night before for that game. That's what I'm saying. Well I don't know that Drake was there for that game. He was might have been relationship been DeMar Rozen who lived in Toronto for mad years could be different than my relationship with LeBron James. This nigga lived in my city and it like, like, like Joe just said, it might not have had to do nothing with DeMar. It was Vince Carter Knight retired. That was That's true. That's true. He might, yeah. I don't know that that was about, I'm assuming he showed a fan.


I'm here for this and you're here and you here. I don't fuck with you bro. And I'm, and I'm giving pushback now. I'ma sound like a hater but fuck it. They know me as a hater. I'm giving pushback to that whole, it's my city. Shit. I don't want to hear that shit. I'm talking about we both fuck my city. What year was the Rosen drafted? I don't know. But he played for Toronto for a long time. I don't think Drake was Drake when he got there. Nah, Drake was Drake when he got Hold on. Yeah, he was. Even if it wasn't he got there. That to be true. Look, even when he got there, I might not have been Drake while he was there. I became Drake. Nah, Drake. But he was, I mean, okay, but you, while he was there, I became Drake and me and you had a bond and a relationship and a friendship. Okay. You became Drake. But I became DeMar de Rose and I'm the franchise leader in every statistical category I'm on.


I'm not Drake. Ain't Drake in oh nine. Listen to what I'm saying. You're the goal post. You're moving the goalpost. Yo, I was just, nobody is saying that know Drake was Drake when he was, he might not have been but I became But he became it and you became DeMar. I was. Which means you became my man. We out in the clubs, we doing all This shit. We fucking girls. We doing I I yeah but stop making it sound like not my social status said status. Nobody said that. Didn't saying that. No, I'm not talking to you. Just listen to me. Stop making it sound like my social status in this town is because you are who you are. No, nobody's saying that. Hold let me listen to more. No, nobody's saying that. You are my man. So then what is the point of saying it's my city if you're not implying any of that?


I I think it's more how close they bond was. Like if he, if he was saying in La It is you flying through twice a again it's different than every single night you hit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you living in Toronto. I'm living in Toronto. Bro. If you in LA it's mad people's things this multi you in Toronto fam and this nigga's in Toronto, y'all both them niggas in Toronto, let's say y'all, both them niggas in Toronto add Kalari in that mix. We the three niggas in this town. So we might have a bond that's bigger than if you just lived in LA or if you lived in Atlanta or if you lived in New York City. Right. There's a a multitude of niggas that could say I'm that nigga in Toronto for the Blacks it might have been just them three niggas.


That was him. So yo, we might have bonded on some other next level shit that me and LeBron James May not have reached any of my mans that don't wanna be my man no more. 'cause I did a video and we can't have a conversation about it and progress and move forward then I'm looking at that for ball. It's not just that he was in the video minimalizing, he was he dancing his ass off in it and his presence. He was, the video was at the concert. He was that's what I meant in the video. He was present. But my point is, It is not just that he was in it, he was punctuating a point that he was making. It would be like if you were battling somebody and they say when you get to Philly you getting fucked up. And at that point I'm sitting in the video, I'm not just in the video. I meant the video, the part where they said Philly niggas gonna fuck you up. But, but I like that point.


He's literally in the video when he says, glad Dro glad D Rose left from over there Y deserve or whatever the line is. Right. So, so D Rose who felt a way back to Ish's point when he was trading It is sitting there by the trucks looking cool on some Yeah. I'm glad my niggas outta there. No, no, but but it, that whole point was in response to Drake saying to to Kendrick that I get more love in your town than you do. Yeah. So he's responding to that part of it. So he's saying LA niggas don't fuck with you. So then Kendrick's saying, lemme show you how many LA niggas fuck with me. And that's why he is mentioning all these LA people. So to me at that point, he's actually taking up Kendrick calls. He's saying, yeah LA niggas fuck with him. I fuck with LA niggas. Not you.


If you assume that that was in response to Drake saying, I get more love in LA than it was the next song. Yeah. That don't mean nothing to me. That entire stanza, that whole paragraph of of and not like us. I think he was driving home a deeper point than replying to, Hey, I get more love in the city with you than you. The Serena point, all of those LA points I think was just connecting the dots to a bigger picture. And even if it's the bigger picture, I don't think it was in surface as Oh you said that. But but here's the thing. I'm glad we got, we took Dero from you and we did this and Serena's over here and we got I'm you're wrong. But I'm gonna pretend you're right on that point. Right. Even if you were right on that point, that speculative that I'm wrong, you can't prove that I'm wrong and that's why I'm moving past it.


That's why I'm moving past it or, or continue the conversation to be fact based. No, no, no. I'm I'm going to the next point, I'm, I'm conceding your point and I'm saying if you saying all right it was about a bigger picture. If the whole picture is you not like us, it means that all everybody's video's us means D Rosero is part of us. Right. And you not it. So now D Rose is saying, I'm not like that nigga who I've been calling my friend for the last 10 years. Wait be clear. Let me clarify my position. But then you not we not that's why I fucked. How do you know that? But wait, let me clar lemme, how do you know that? Let now y'all arguing court. Please let me clarify my position. I do believe that Drake should feel however the fuck he wants about it. I'm not arguing the other side. Drake should 100% feel a way nigga. I talked you outta depression on my couch. Yeah. You know he made that nigga soup or something.


Char charcuterie. You know he ordered some shit and a good hook too. Grapefruit seltzer was sad as hell. He, hell yeah. Good drink. Do you eat Hoggies? Would you like a hogie? How about some things and hook? How about a hogie and hookah? Mel you can't, you gotta mute up on our Drake topic. Yeah. Oh my God. Because it's gonna sound like a shot. They already say you'd be shooting. I'm not shooting. I'm just don't sound a conversation. You might wanna go back home thinking I can go the fuck back home whenever I want to. You can vote there. Eh? You can vote there. You can vote there. Yo. So I'm not mad at him feeling he should feel the way. Sure. It is It. It's never the conflict, it's the inability to navigate conflict.


It's never the conflict. What he did with the conflict is where I'm like eh, and not even 'cause I've already came to conclusions I need to come to about him. But all that standing at the game, the ice grilling the face, the so out of the two of them, the mumbling under their breath like we niggas and we respectful so we ain't gonna say it but you a bitch like, like it ain't, I ain't even about to try sit here, do a bunch unpacking you. Like he went to the game and cut his eyes and sucked his teeth.


Yeah he fucking duck lipped his way. Ooh. These are the duck lips and death. Ooh. Ooh. Talk about Ducktails. Yo don't come to my game and cut eyes at me my nigga. I'll throw this balling at your fucking, so I'm not mad at feeling the way, go ahead and feel the way. But what he did with It is, eh, and to your original question though, like how, how do we feel? Like what Jermaine Dupree t tweeted and stuff like that. I ain't wanna Drake at that festival. No I'm talking she should have been at that festival. Yeah, I'm just saying in response to them, like all the people saying, Drake, you missed your opportunity.


You should those days this was not for, this was not that era Empire fans that was born in oh five. Yeah this was not A-Y-M-C-M-B thing. I don't want none of them niggas there. Right. Well Jermaine Dre is different. I'm talking about the fans that were saying that. Yeah, Jermaine Dre is ahead so he probably really wanna see Drake over there. Some nigga just wanna see the show. Yeah. He just wanna see a great show. Nah, this hey So I mean if you would go, I as a fan, if I was signed, if you did a show in New Jersey, I would come to your show in New Jersey and not sit courtside to mean mug. My hops Thank you. You Know what I'm saying? Like Who's play who's playing The Kings? Oh Yeah, no and and it's Vince Carter retirement night.


That matters. Yo, that's, he ain't been at a bunch of other games this season so it's like oh this is one of them nights. You gotta be here for this. That's like the unveiling of the D Wade statue or some shit like that. Like no you not gonna miss that. And Vince especially being in ambassador for the Raptors from Toronto, he's going to be there at that game no matter who they played that night. And Vince shouted him out in the speech. He was like yo, getting my speech. Shout to Drake right there. He threw me a Gatorade once when I was thirsty. These niggas be having the most fickle French in yo Drake. You was there that day man, he fucking grabbed my towel for me. We such a bond. Yo Miss card if you knock the fuck off just met these niggas.


It's like when I'm watching the boxing match and they let all the rappers come backstage like they know 'em. The boxer be like nigga can move man. Just sing these little slap. No the new shit is Colorado locker room after the game. Yeah, Dion locker room. Yeah. Everybody be in that motherfucker man. Man that's the new shit though. All the rappers. I hate it. Who y'all go to the locker room or to the game? Going to the game? I'm not going to the locker room. I ain't gonna the locker room. I'm not gonna leave. I'm Not going to no locker room. It's Definitely not going. Y'all too cool to go to a locker room. I I don't wanna be in the locker room. I the locker room. If I got invited I would go to the locker room. Yeah I'll do the sideline. I ain't do the locker room. Y'all could shower in peace me afterwards.


It's cool. Damn. Oh you got some type of like dick phobia or something like you thinking you gonna walk back there? Everybody she gonna be swinging around. It might be swinging around. I'm not afraid of the dicks. I just don't. True. There's other things I can do. There's other things I could do at my time And look at sweaty dicks that's all like I'll beat you at tomorrow. You link up after this. Y'all Got it Yeah man it's hilarious. Do y'all think DeMar Deros and you know why the other part know why that shit is shady too. They didn't ask that nigga one question about DeMar Deros jersey being racist. No that was not the question at all. No he was drunk.


He was super drunk. He was pointing shorty on the sideline talking about how bad she looked, like how good she looked, whatever. And then he was like yeah And if that jersey ever goes up to the top, I I'm gonna say something right now. What? I won't please do. What was that lady's name? Jesse Re She's fire Musical Oh. yeah you know that was somebody Yeah, yeah, yeah. I won't say it. I want to clarify my position on this Drake DeMar de Rosen topic yet again. Because a lot of podcasts listeners are stupid. Drake has every right to be perturbed like I don't even think it's called anger when he gets it. I think I Brought it.


Tea hot making This shit. Rick has every right to be destroyed over things. Perplexed. Yes. P flummoxed. Wait what's that? What? Plummed p Flummoxed. Plummed with a F. Drake be Plumed. Drake be plumed. He has every right to be plummed again. This is Oh they having some like Harvard laugh. Yeah, no she educated laugh. She just disrespect. She dropped out. I swear to God I did not. You did what you, you ain't disrespect us? No. What you just say what you thought it was? Wait, what did she say? didn didn't hear it. Told her what you said. No, she said Flemming and Mark said oh Flemming. And then she looked up at Mark and said, I'm so glad, glad you're here. Oh. Shit. Damn y'all did that like in unison we heard it.


Wow. Headphones good. Wow. But Mark is smart. That's the point. We supposed to not be smart. No, not everybody's not at all smart. No, you missed his joke. Everyone's smart in their own ways. You missed his joke. That's what you say this little kids. Oh you own special in your own way. A better average slice. This room was this room before you got here. Damn. I was making, I was closing my Drake point. I was closing my Drake point. Oh it's not about the conflict. Inability to navigate conflict one. And I'm still pushing back on that shit. DeMar DeRozen is from Compton Compton.


That ain't what I was thinking. But he's from Compton too and he is from something else that I won't say where he went to school. U-S-C-U-S-C-U-S-C. Same place Brony went. Wow. So I'm just saying like when it's time to ride, You ride with who you ride with. Cool. And that could be a revelation for some and it could be a hurtful revelation. So I understand that. I do understand that when you think somebody is your man man and you see 'em doing some shit that proves to you that they not your mans the way you thought they wasn't or, or you might have helped somebody at a point in time and that was forgotten.


Know why I don't like that one. Not talking about Drake even though they're gonna think I am but know I don't like that one. 'cause niggas just be groupies for people. That's true too. Niggas just be groupies for famous people and then when some shit go on, you start thinking it's a friendship. 'cause you was a groupie for niggas. I'm not. I Yeah, but you know what I, I don't know my motto. None of these niggas is friends. Yo, lemme tell you something. If you loan me money when I was down, right? Let's say you loan me, never Got it back. I left the strip club early. You wanted to stay a little longer in your single days. Last, last honey too, right? Yeah. I gave him my last, I gave him my last, guess what Issu came on, he never gave it back. Guess Whata came on 80 of that.


But anyway. Have you have you, let's say you loaned me a hundred grand and I was down by it. Oh I didn't do that. I was down crazy. See now you ain't even got a door in Newark who don't got a door. you right. Yo, I should have never brought, I've never bring kids to this motherfucker. you right don. don got no doors in Newark. You don't I'm flm fl I know I'm comics now. But have you have, you have, you helped me at a point and then when the opportunity came around that I could potentially help you or and I didn't You feel a type of way or just to that shit on you? It's human nature bro. I don't know why that nigga ain't weird fulfilling type of way. I don't think so either. Yeah. Like niggas is looking at him like he crazy.


He not crazy for, okay, let's try this a different way. Alright. We talk air. We won't, we won't try this a different way. You the best podcast in the world. Not that good. No, I'm not that good. That's not true. I'm not that good. I tell you it's Rogan. I promise Oh Shit. Hey, do y'all think Kamal Lou was 100% correct and not going to Texas? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to Texas. Yeah. To sit with Rogan after she sat with Trump. I mean after he sat with Trump, they wanted her to come to Texas. They wanted and because they was trying to kill her because listen, I was in the New York streets when that, when that jet made a left and landed on Saturday night and we all, we did assume it was Saturday Night live because why else is your jet making a detour to land in New York on a Saturday at 10 o'clock, whatever time it was.


And I liked that bit and I, and I did like that bit. It was a good bit. But that brought, sparked the conversation again of should she have done the same thing to go to Joe Rogan? No, I'm with you. I say no. No, I think it was too little too late. I think if he would've invited her first, I think I would've sat with him if I was her. But I'm not sitting with you. I, I got campaigning to do, we got a week and a half left. I got more important shit to do. But what they said, if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, they were like, we could do it over here somewhere. He was just like, no, come to Texas. Come to Texas to my compound and we're gonna do it here. I no, I have this, I'm campaigning to be the president of the United States. I'm not Yeah, I'm busy not coming to your shit. I'm busy and I got SNL coming, I got Oprah coming, I have Beyonce coming.


I'm also going to sit like she wasn't sure. There was no shortage of humongous platforms. Yeah. And for the, you know, Rogan It is huge. It is, I'm not Rogan, Rogan is huge, but Rogan and Elon Musk and all the whites that don't wear cologne, you know where they stand. I was about to say. And he came out and endorsed him. Stink White. Basically he, he literally endorsed him. Said you know what, this is an endorsement after he was straddling the fence or Right. Or or posturing. As if he would. And I told niggas that when they was like, oh Joe never, Joe Rogan never endorses, he just straddles the line and he wants to see both sides. Nigga stop it, stop it. Joe Rogan act. And I think they evaluated, oh I think they evaluated his, his fan base in the odds of me winning his fan base over It is not worth for me going there and spending a day there.


Nope. Trump interview was three hours, three and some change. That's without the edits my nigga. So you, they would have to make all of these arrangements to go there and sit there for 6, 7, 8 hours. I'm, I'm good. I'm gonna go over here where I can potentially get some, some, some voters on my side. Elon Musk. 'cause I was trying to figure out why his dick ride game is so hard. OnlyFans Ish like that nigga Dick ride with the best of them. Boy I was trying to figure he's a bad, I hate them billionaire niggas that just dick ride when other men show up it's like I hate this. I'll talk about that. He ain ain't dick riding. He strategizing he ain't dick riding. What's The Strategy nigga if Trump becomes president, I got space X guess where they gonna funnel all that bread too?


Well and he said on Rogan that if Kamala wins that he's fearful that X can potentially be shut down and then all advertising and yada yada yada yada. So it's like all right. That's why you dick Rod he got, he got a lot of weight riding on this thing. He look like he stink. I ain't gonna lie. He look plastic. Yeah. Nigga look funny to me bro. Like he, he fake. He's had a lot of bro talk chill. I gotta, I gotta go out where I'm, I'm going. I don't even know where he knows from. I don't know nothing about you. I'm going out south to Peep Neuralink Musky ass nigga. What? I'm going out there a tour, the Neuralink facility dope. Super dope.


Oh they Got it. Oh y'all, hey i's gonna come back with the Neuralink? Nah, no Im not getting it. I'm not getting, it's just, it's just a sticker you got. Hey your vote is your vote. No for real. As long as you voted. I voted, I voted. That's how long as you voted. I voted That nigga voted and hit the Neuralink facilities. Oh. Shit. Oh my lord. Alright. That's dope. I ain't mad at you yet. You come out here talking, you come back talking funny on some robotic shit. It is, It is all, it's all yeah, I'm good. Nah and skip the next Subm Mercer ride that part.


We got a Bluetooth shit right to Ice Brain. See billionaires be too bored. Man I had have shot that idea down from the rip the sub Mercer with six of my buddies that's controlled from a joystick from the Xbox. Yeah, no I'm cool. Hey y'all go ahead. You ain't got no window nigga. Yeah, you can't have a window screen. Nigga. I coulda did this. Don't get me started bro. I randomly just sit and think about that shit like me too. New thoughts come into my head like nobody said put a GoPro on there instead. Yeah, we gonna stand up here. Let's just sit that down there and we can just watch it. They did it first. Allegedly. I don't have, I'm good. Go ahead. you right. I'm good. I'm good. Shit. I ain't over the missing Malaysian plane.


I keep saying shit about that. That's bigger than, that's bigger than the Chase CoBoat to me. I'm about to go to Chase. Lemme shut up. Yeah, that yeah, we'll save that for the conspiracy. Go to Chase. I got a lot of them. Yeah. Tenfold day. What that mean? Chase private you? I got a lady. You always got a lady Not for Amex. I did. I ain't had nobody for Amex. Well Mark did. I mean that's my man Mark networking baby Mark came through that card just gonna give motherfucker my girl more reason to pocket watch. And it's a shame that it's so bad now. I gotta have that talk like I can't shop in front of, you know you don't need that bag.


Shut your, if you get that bag then I be Girl shut your ass up. I'm get in trouble. Yep. Hey, one of y'all saved me for myself. What we got, what we got that's coming in. Well, come on. What's up I? hope we Got it board. You said something earlier and I wasn't sure if you was joking or not about Joel and b when we was talking about him hitting the reporter. It wasn't a girl, not the girl part Oh that shit was sending the soul. No, I'm talking about the fact that a reporter Mark Marcus Haynes's name, who's a dickhead, right? Everybody knows a dickhead in Philly. Right. Good friend of mine. Yeah. I could s that totally tracks.


So, wow. I'm joking. He, he wrote a piece about Joellen Bead and he mentions Joellen beads, dead brother. Dead brother who his brother died in a car accident and his toddler now son who we named him after. And he basically was saying, you, you named your, your, your kid, your your kid after your, your deceased brother as a way of honoring him. And then he basically saying you're not honoring your your legacy. It was a hit piece. It was a hit piece. And it's like if you wanna criticize Joellen bead for not playing or whatever, although I think he needs to sit out. I think Joel m bead plays hurt all the time. He does the best he can. The new Ben Simmons. Nah, yo, yo, night, night and day, night and day, night and midnight.


Dusk Night, night and evening. Joellen B is the totally different. Fuck. Yeah. Totally fucking getting out. That's what I'm saying. Fuck outta here. Fuck outta here man. Joel MB was the MVP of the league. What I'm, come on man. Joellen V is a beast. And if, but if you wanna criticize this game or like any athlete you can, but you don't mention his family. So he goes to the, the press room and when they have a argument or they have a conversation, he's like, yo, if you do this again, I'm go, I'm gonna react and I'm willing, I'm willing to go with whatever consequences, whatever, whatever, whatever. Come with it, I'll take it. And Marcus Haynes being the dickhead, starts going back and forth with him and at some point and be pushes He ain't punch him. The initial reports that he slapped, he punched him. He just pushed him. I'm not saying that it's a push is better than a, a punch or a slap.


Especially if you seven foot two three plus pounds. Yeah. Seven foot nigga smack you his whole hand be on your whole face. I'm definitely, bro, it'd be a beautiful funeral. Oh man. Yeah man, come on man. Yo, I I was like, you know what, I'm, I'm a nonviolent. I I I'm an advocate of non-violence. But if you start doing that, I understand, I'm just, I understand why Joel MB would do that. What say you and you about what the, the topic just presented about Mark? I I also understand I wouldn't have done it, but I understand. Yeah. I wouldn't have did it, but I'm not mad at him for doing it. Like, because again, the fact that he even said, yo, listen, I'm with whatever comes with this. Like I am, I've assessed that already 'cause he didn't wanna play anyway.


So he'll be back. He told You right? No, back to back. I playing. He'll be so the so the gig is not the gig. The gig is not the gig. I think all bets are off when you start talking about my fucking gig. Yeah. My dead brother. That's not my point. I'm not saying that. I'm still saying it's on all the shit y'all be saying. Yo, the gig is the gig. So don't say y'all 'cause you hear what I'm saying? No, I've heard both. Both of y'all say the the gig is the gig. The gig don't hold on. Let, let, lemme This shit off the gig is absolutely the gig. Meaning that there's going to be levels of criticism, whatever the case may be that's going to come with that. That's the gig. Now the person that's running they mouth saying if they decide to cross lines, you have to be prepared to whatever comes with that too.


True. Right. And this wasn't the first time either, which was Joelle's point. This continues to happen and this writer in Philadelphia is known as a writer. Nobody likes, like nobody comes to his funeral kind of. Nobody likes Yeah. It is not like, oh and Beat is out there just running around smacking the anybody that got something to say about it. But that's the gig being the gig. If you are crossing a line over here, I'm, he felt the need to step to him and I respect it and doing it with the purpose of being antagonistic. Yeah. Yeah. Because even in the press room, he was antagonizing him more You know what I mean because he was like, look, I don't care what you think. He's like, yes you do care. You know what I mean. He was trying to get a rise outta Joel LMB. And a lot of people, you know, a lot of reporters don't report fairly and a lot of 'em, especially sports reporters and a lot of 'em, they make it personal.


And all I'm saying is as, as is even when I used to write music, it's like, don't make it personal, make it about the music. Wait, what'd you say back what you wrote? What'd you say? I was a music journalist. Oh no, no, not a, not a musician. I'm that's not writing music. That's writing about music we're talking about. I I thought the context was obvious. I was talking about journalism. We were talking about journalism. I thought you were composer. I was plumed. I thought bars is something that you No, no, no. Mark had a demo out there. Hey, honor Quincy Jones. Nah, no demos, I'm just saying. But when I would do music reviews, there's a, even if I don't like the artist, I'm not going to, it shouldn't come through that. I don't like the artist and I shouldn't mention your family, I shouldn't mention these personal things, but some people do it and I just, I never, I never liked that.


And people do it to get a reaction outta you or to get a rise out. You okay, well you got the reaction right now. You, you, you looking, looking for a nigga. You found a nigga. Right. Is there nothing somebody could say to make y'all go past that line? Because I know y'all saying I wouldn't do it, but what say what's the line Say who said they who said who said they wouldn't do it? Well Joe, I said that Oh yeah, say and I said that there's nothing nobody could say to me to make me get physical with her. N no deceased relative. No, not at all. Nothing about your kids. And and depending on what deceased relative, I, I had smoke with some of you might be rolling with him, you know that nigga was a piece of shit. What he owe me money still. No, there's nothing, nobody could say verbally, verbally to make me get active the world.


But but you gotta understand where they coming from. They coming from the black Twitter, they coming from vlogging and doing all of that stuff where that shit was cool. It was encouraged, it was cute. That shit ain't cute. So you could get punched in your motherfucking face if you say the wrong thing and if you do that, be prepared for what comes with that thousand and, and, and that's all I gotta, you just gotta be prepared for that a thousand percent. I come from the elementary school era of your mother and when you said it before you got the, the out a nigga fist was in your motherfucking face. And then the one nigga who mother died. Yep. That was always said to him, what's mothers was alive, killed the substitute nigga you said a nigga mother, they mother was alive and you was getting punched in your face.


I mean I've seen these internet niggas don't get punched in the face and so that's why they feel as if they are shit. Well where do you stand on that? I agree with that. A hundred percent. Fuck outta here and punching nigga in the face over the comments. Not exactly. This is what I'm saying. Yes. I'm I'm saying be prepared for what? Come with it. There's two people deserve to get punched in the face. I I agree with Joe that we don't necessarily sh we don't necessarily need to be the imposer of the karma, but they deserve to get punched in the face. And if more people got punched in the face, they will be a lot more careful with things that they say and do I look at that shit as a scale? Is it worth it? So yeah. Cool. People have said a bunch of shit that they deserve to get punched in the face over now go punch 'em in the face. Is it worth what comes with that? But you don't look at it yo, you type that ign shit.


Hold on, hold on it punch in your fucking face. Let me finish. I play things out. Yes. It is worth, It is, you should get punched in the face for that. Now I go punch you in the face. What happens next? Is all of that worth it? But, and for, let me finish for me, majority of the time, 99.9% of the time the answer is no. That's a high number. It is a high number. It's not worth, again, mine is higher than It is. Mines way lower than that. Mine is way lower 100% of the time. I'm not putting a hand on you over nothing. You said, I'm not saying you that everybody don't feel like you We talk zombie yo dog. Sometimes the relief of punching you in your motherfucking face felt good nigga. And I take the community service I agree with, with you preach things that you that you not about who not about it.


You out your fucking mind nigga. The nigga that said something about my family, I invited him to the park to put his fucking hands up nigga. I am about it. Listen to me. What you talking about? No, listen, hold hold one second. Stop. Stop. Listen to this. But I'm not trying to be funny. Him inviting somebody in the park and him driving to the park to get this done. It is not the same thing. It's not the same thing. But if that nigga would've gave me his location, I was going to the park. But ice you was a troll. And you used to say mean mad shit about people. So you not looking at it from they perspective, you looking at it from yours. So the same thing that somebody could say, yo, when you sit behind that computer and you type your fingers away, be prepared for what comes along with that. You only looking at it once a nigga get punched in the face. Let me finish like you said, like when, when you, when a nigga punch you in the face, you gotta be prepared for the, the consequences or whatever that recourse may be.


When you sitting behind a motherfucking computer and you typing shit and the nigga see you in person, you gotta be prepared for what comes with that. Hey Ish, who you talking to? I have been prepared for that. You wasn't prepared. I was prepared. He wasn't. What are you talking about? I sat there, there's a particular rapper that I said yo, when I saw him we had a conversation and if he felt like he still wanted to take it there, I had to eat that. I know that's prepared, that's understanding what comes with what was said. And and That is 1000%. And I wanna offer, it's it's other scenarios. I wanna some more, more pushback. I don't, I don't care that Ish is yelling at me and think I'm not yelling at you. I'm not trying to offend you. I I don't, I don't even take it as a offense. I think that and but can I just ask him one question real quick before you go real quick? I wanted to ask you go ahead.


That person that invite you to the park or or that you, you invite to the park because of you didn't like what he said online. He gives you that address. You show up at the park, you punch him in the face, you feel relief for doing that. He go press charges and you miss time away from your daughter. Was it worth it? Yes. Then we are two different people. Are you just took my point. We are two different people. You just took my point yo and God bless you sir. So look, I do not believe y'all have the one. Go ahead. How am I fronting? Because when you was online saying XYI don't. Alright. A she was online saying X, Y, z about niggas right? I was online saying no, no, my trolling outside of two people only came from critiquing y'all music and y'all didn't like it. But go ahead.


You were online saying shit about people. Yes. Saying things that were mean bro. You were saying more shit about niggas than that was just about music too. You fronting I'm not fronting you are fronting. It was personal. You saying Yes about one in particular very personal. I was wrong. Very personal. Go ahead. Go them niggas was looking for ice. Correct. So if you was, so if you was built on standing in what you were saying when the niggas was looking for you, you would've came outside and said I'm right here. I was still outside Ish, they showed up at a spot that I wasn't at at the time. And guess what you I was still outside. I still went back to that spot. Did I not? I didn't know they was looking for you at that time. But did I still go back though? Yeah, but if you was in, okay, so what are you talking about? So if you was in there on that particular day, you walk outside, if I was in there on that particular day, probably not.


I'm outnumbered. What the fuck is you talking about? I know it's also a thing called moving smart. True. If I'm outnumbered and yo them niggas is outside in a van looking for you. No I'm not going. I'm right here. Which means you ain't really ready to stand on what you were saying and do that. But if they force me, I have to stand on that and I accepted that, of course I'm not walking into the mouse trap. See that's, I get what he's saying. See that's why it said we need clear definitions on what stand on be. Meaning we just need clear definition. And you saying, yo, I did ask, I'm not going to look for it but I did X and whatever. Come with it. I'm ready and prepared to face it head on. That's standing on it. If I said this about your mother, if I said this about your kid, if I said this about somebody and when I see you I'm ready to stand on that.


That's what that means. I'm standing on my square. It ain't mean that when them niggas pull up, I could go hide in the bathroom or I could go out the back door. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not saying you did that. Oh okay. Clear that up. I could go hide in the bathroom. If you was there, you wouldn't have came outside. That's not hiding in the bathroom. I'm still sitting there at the bar. You wouldn't have, you wouldn't have been at the bar when them niggas would've came. I wasn't there. He'd been behind the bar. I wasn't there. I wasn't there. I wasn't, I'd have made a phone call to take the truth. He'd really, what happened? I made a phone call in, in closing girl. Well in closing for me, get up here now in closing for me, y'all could fight about it a little more. Ain't what I'm saying is this. What separates me from some of the street niggas that I refer to is simply risks that we're willing to take.


True risk reward assessment. That's it for me. And everybody can answer this. This may be already answered it with you. For me. Shit, I just had a scrap and in the following weeks was doctor's appointments. It was my wrist feeling funny. It wasn't worth it. I couldn't pick up bags a certain way. That was him defending himself. Wait, hold up. No. And that was me not pressing charges. Yes. That's s that's not, that's not who I am at my court. Shouldn't be. But if you get into some of that, like I said, charges could be pressed, you could end up going to jail, you could have time away from your children.


I don't believe It is that for a stranger on the internet, you are gonna have time away from your daughter. I don't care what you said. I don't either. That's fine. You could with, I don't, I'm not telling you to believe me, but It is level still to me the internet. And that's, and guess what? And that's where them bitch ass niggas thrive because they know you got something to live for and you got too much and so they keep doing that shit and It is sucker shit. And that's how suckers thrive because they know you got something to live for. So I can say and do whatever I want because it's too valuable for him. Punch me on my motherfucking face, which is what I deserve. I'm agree. Hold on. I'm agreeing with That's true. Cool. But they're not doing you said say and do. They ain't doing shit. They just type words. I'm not, I'm not, I don don't don't sticks and stone.


don don me and my whole life have been the same. Say what you want my nigga, you lay a hand on me now it's different or anybody I'm with and live It is different and we live all that I respect. I never been the guy that's going and initiate or set off and you and you. I wouldn't give a fuck if the nigga in front of me clearly wanna fight. He gotta do something for Bobby. Yo no you standing on that, you've been standing on that for decades. That's my, my whole life. Like I ain't lying. So I don't think you fronting, I'm not saying that you fronting, I'm not saying that you lying. I'm saying that that how you choose to handle some shit and now someone else and how somebody else chooses to handle some shit. There's no right or wrong in that matter.


It's a personal preference and a personal choice and I agree but there's wiser. I agree with you. I think there's wiser choice and less wise choice. Like for example, I'm not going to, if people write shit about me every day on the internet, right, I would lose my fucking mind if I responded to everybody. So I'm not inviting nobody out like on some meet me Temecula shit. Like I'm not gonna be like, let me like I'm, I'm not doing that shit. Right. Because you could be also, you could roll up in a situation where you go to punch a nigga in the mouth and and that nigga put pull out of Roscoe and pop your fucking head off. Right? And then it's like yo, you was arguing with you know so and so. Right. You ain't annoying. I'm not doing that. However, if I see the person I would do what Joel MB did. I would approach them and have something to say to them about it and make it clear not to do that again. If it was crossing a line now again you could say a lot of shit I got a high threshold but I'm saying if it's in that zone of shit I don't fuck with a hundred percent of the time I'm gonna say something about it.


That's all I'm saying. And then whatever comes from that, you gotta be prepared to deal with it. Gotta be prepared. That's it. And when I'm on the other side of it as a writer, I make sure that I never write or on TV say anything about anybody that I couldn't stand on when I saw them. Well I follow that too as a broadcaster. I'm not gonna say and in life I ain't saying nothing behind nobody back that I got a problem saying to they face. I just won't say it if that's the case. Right bro, you know my shit us up here. I'm sorry No go, go. You know how much shit up here and y'all are way more liberal than me. And, and and how, what y'all are say so you did vote so you ary aint that what you say in this chair? We got him. No. Yeah. And speaking on some of that shit. Yeah like dog, I'll reserve my right to to, you know what I'm saying because we, we just had a conversation about something else.


I have a opinion on it but my opinion would be more hurtful than harmful. I mean hurtful than helpful. So I'm gonna shut the fuck up 'cause it don't deserve to be said. That's how I feel about some shit. You critiquing somebody performance or some shit like that. When you start getting personal it's different. And I don't believe that the gig is the gig when you start bringing niggas families and niggas friends into that. I think that's a cop out for the bitches. I think that's pussy to talk about anybody's family, especially children. I also know that somebody's saying something about my family or children don't make it true. True. As long as no, are we affected That? is somebody gonna get Hurt? I feel like sometimes it's the audacity though. Yeah bro. That's the aud that's the part that will get and We sit up here, champion running around trying to police these niggas like this of just off of what they saying.


You don't every day, every day. They said it also might just not be the fucking day. I might, I might 364 days outta the year I might be like, alright, I let everything fucking slide. It's that one day you got me and you talked about the wrong Shit. It is It is motherfuckers doing life over that, losing that one Time. I totally understand All the rules in control that one time. See that's It still makes but it still makes you a human being, I could tell. You can be like you never did. Scared straight. Go listen to Beanie Siegel. What's your life like off of the truth album? Let him break it down for you. The Toilet plunger sword. Yeah. Yeah. That's it, bro. It to her. Push raw toilet sword. That's the shooter. That's my shit.


They played in schools in Philly. They should. Yeah. Don't you spend no time away from your daughter? 'cause that nigga line y'all niggas again, y'all encourage that. Y'all welcome that shit. Y'all engage. I don't engage in that. Who's y'all? Welcome. Wow. Welcome, welcome and engage. I don't, I I don't like those words. I just don't care. And you are you and maybe there's things that you care about. I don't care about the vice versa. I'm, I been the welcome part. It's welcome. Maybe that's, It is welcoming. I don't care what them, I care about what y'all say and my parents and my loved ones goes to mind. Don't matter. Those that matter. Don't mind the fuck them niggas. Nah, niggas can't say what you gonna say. They, they can't say no. Nothing worse about me.


I would agree. Well, a pedophiles bad. Yeah. And don't y'all support it While we're on the subject of bullshit, we should send prayers to Buckshot real quick. Oh. Yeah. Yo. Does, does anybody know the, the, the, the, He came out and said some shit. We still don't really know the full details. Got. it looks like he got jumped Broke. If we knew the full details, I wouldn't say it anyway. Yeah, true. We seen what we seen. I watched fucking rock. Same shot rock. Blog. Blog on it. 'cause I didn't even believe it was real. Me either. Like that's how old school I am. I think that the hip hop pioneers and the legends that I love, we love and if the old heads don't get health benefits or some type of pay increase or nothing from shit, the la the first thing they should get is the respect for what they have done throughout their lives.


So I can't look at no video of the buck shot shorty in the condition that I saw him in, in that video floating around. Shit. It is crazy. At first I thought it wasn't real. I thought it was ai. Then it was confirmed. Then I heard this happened in Brooklyn. Brooklyn, Yeah. Yeah. Money that recorded that video. I imagine your commentary is just as bad as, as what was being done. Buckshot. Shorty. We love You. right? We praying for you. We hope that you are safe. I don't think anybody needs to experience that or go through that. That shit is crazy. And like Rock said, right, because that's the other side of punching people in your face.


We're punching people in the face. We'll both go home from that. What happens after we get home? Now who's ready for you to go make phone? Calls me to go make phone calls for niggas to be hiding in the bushes. Hiding under cars, niggas buying expensive fucking ammo. Rock was like, yo dog, we in, we 50 for like, the days ain't there when niggas was living like that. Looking for that's why. Or trying to respond to that at, that's why I try to respect everybody fucking years old. I try to be respectful to everybody dog. Exactly. Like I don't try to disrespect nobody. I don't. That buckshot shit really, really disturbed me, man. I don't encourage any of y'all to go watch no videos.


Just if you love hip hop, send a pre up for buckshot, man. That's it. That's it. That's all. I Got it. That's it. That's all I got on the subject. Mel, you wanna lead us into Quincy Jones? I'm real mad that I ain't get to pick with Quincy Jones. That I ain't get to interview with Quincy Jones. That I ain't get to shake Quincy Jones hands normally when all y'all be doing that goofy shit and posting texts of the nigga that died and picked. I don't be feeling the way I be judging shit outta y'all this time. This one hurt. This one hurt. And now come clean. 'cause I'm black. When we lose a great, my immediate reaction is gonna be, no, not them.


How did you take Quincy? And he say Quincy was 91. And then my brain got to work and I was like, that was his industry age too. So Quincy was probably 119 and I don't expect nobody to still be here. He did a lot. That 91 or 190. That's what I'm saying. Yo, if there was ever a fulfilled life matter what he had it. He did it, did it on the pop Is the fifties at the highest levels. I did everything I ever did at the highest levels. Word. Everything I ever did was live long, long, long way after me. It's Mortal World. Quincy Jones. Arguably the greatest to ever do it, man.


I think 2024 is ending just with, you know, know where my brain goes. What's up? Who do we have that could fill those shoes? Nobody. Nobody. Like, or even when I say the next or You know what I mean. Next generation when when like greatness leaves, you'd be like, yo, who do we have up and coming? Like political greatness. You be like, yo, who the fuck could step into those shoes now? Nobody. Like, and that's what I'll think about. Like, who are the next up and comings? That's, that's legends and icons. My, my brain went to, if, if Quincy couldn't hold the position of Ellucian or Lyor Oh, or Sylvia or, or any of these people. Todd, Julie.


Yeah. I have to imagine some of that would be he didn't want them. I. hope so I hope he wouldn't say that way. I hope. He, he didn't, I mean, remember he was the first African American VP of Mercury records in, was that, was it fifties or, but been in fifties and sixties and that he said that wasn't for him. That wasn't the world he wanted to be in. I accept that from Quincy. If that's what y'all are telling me, then Stevie or any black, any black great mogul with the best ear for music in the world, it would be nice to see them in more of a position of power Or at least some of their contemporary, someone that they fuck with. Smokey. You know what I'm saying?


Baby face. Any of them. I mean, I'm face kind, well facing with that kind of shit. I just, I just, I he Kind of had it. I, I feel like that's a good point though. I feel like we should do a better job letting people know his legacy. And, and I don't think people fully appreciate just how much Quincy Jones touched in over the course of the 20th century. I mean, it, there's just so few things that were good that Quincy Jones wasn't connected to. Whether it's Color Purple, whether it's Oprah, whether it's Vibe Magazine, whether it's, I mean, bad thrill, all the, all the albums we argued about Quincy's is, is has his hand on it. You know what I mean. Whether you talk about theme songs to TV shows to, I mean, everything. Everything he did and, and I think the thing that I always am struck by with Quincy Jones is the fact that this wasn't his first love.


Like he was a trumpeter word and he had this brain aneurysm and the doctor said if you ever play another note, you're going to die. And he had to figure out what to do with the rest of his life. Oh. Shit. I mean, can you imagine being your twenties being told you can never do the thing that you've been wanting to do your whole life chasing Ray Charles around trying to play and he turns it into like the greatest shit ever. One of the greatest composers. One of the greatest writers, one of the greatest producers. It's like, it's a reminder to me that like even when you, a door gets closed on you, it's not the final word on what you can be. You can't stop greatness. Yeah. Adversity is a Yeah, true greatness. You just, you can't stop it. You can't. You can put a roadblock up. It's going to find a way around and still gonna find its way out. Yeah.


This is Mark's third day on the job. If you let him out shine you on this topic like you were supposed to, to have a memorable little, like you supposed to get into that trumpet shit dude. Like how you feeling? He Told I appreciate him sharing a little factoid with him, with us because I did not know that We're a team Joe. All of us here. I mean we're a team. One thing that I just learned very recently is the fact God damn Mel It is what you learn. I learned that he put his foot down when it came to don't stop till you get enough.

The A side got B sides. Good one. Did you know anything about Quincy Jones or I know I was at his house hanging out party. That's all. That's all we got. Mm Yeah.

Did you read the walls at all? Did you look at the fucking plaque? One plaque said, yo, lemme tell you this trumpet fact. Oh you were there so you know what's on the walls. I guess I didn't make it to that room. Oh Shit bang Connie. That was solid. Who? Who? Good K Joe.


Quincy Jones with me and Mel in two different rooms going back and forth is nuts. I would've kept the relationship man. Hey young man. He kept calling me sis. Fuck you talking about? What's wrong with you? Yo, Quincy Ammani said he was just wanting to go cry Quincy. We love you. Yo. I can't think of somebody who did more in music anyway. My nobody clues. I can't think of it. That's real. Hey, if you, hey, I watched the we are the World doc. If you wasn't in there, Quincy, that white spiky head boy, all that screaming, that white boy would.


Yo, him and Cindy Lauper would've went too crazy. Thank God for Quincy. For real. Thank God for fucking Quincy Jones, man. Oh my Lord. That's not too much in here nigga be 91. I'd be like, why? Why did you take him? Take me so young? He was so much life to live. I hate to be that guy to do it, but I always think of it. But when Stevie go, I'm gonna be fucked up. Oh, I'm done. I'm gonna bewi I'm calling out. I'm not coming in here. Oh, I thought you'd come back in with news.

Like you said, when Stevie go, you ain't gonna be no good. Like it was Prince and Mike for me. Anita Baker I'm sure is on it. I'm gonna cry for a lot of people.

Huh. Barry go one of them too. Barry Gray. I-I-I-I-I wouldn't, I wouldn't cry. I mean I, I I respect the legacy, but shit, I wouldn't miss no work. Whitney Houston. I cry. Whitney Houston was tough. I cry I didn the whole funeral. Yeah. That shit was right there in Newark. That shit was, it was Whitney. Houston was tough. 'cause the whole family started going, going like dominoes at that point. Yeah. Like the kids tragic. Even prior to that, Whitney was just tough 'cause of circumstances. Just how we found out and how that happened. That shit was happening. That shit was at New Hope. I was, yeah, come on. I know Clive was fucked up. Yeah man, that was rough. Luther Vandross was rough for me. Jaheem was fucked up.


What? Jaheem was fucked up? No, I'm sure Clive was Who? Jaheem devastated. Jaheem. I'm sure Nice. Jaheem is alive. No, I'm saying he was fucked up. He was upset. I was. I didn't know. I thought no. He was saying no. No, he said he showed Clive was, was fucked up. I Saidhe is alive. Jaheem was fucked up at. Yeah, Whitney. Shit. That's what I'm talking about. Everybody. Yeah. Word. That Whitney funeral was beautiful too. Man. It was powerful. Did you go? I didn't, it was in Jersey. I try to avoid that. Some doctor. Oh wait, what's wrong? I had an invite. Hold on. Okay then. Good. Get bad. What you say? Huh? He was in Jersey trying to avoid that. He ain't want come to Newark. I ain't see that. Right. You peeped it. Yeah. I ain't, that's why nigga Uber eats from Kings.


Yeah. I ain't gonna lie. I do. I know. Think they killed niggas and killed Malcolm X and Kings. Yo. What man killed Malcolm X and Kings? The the, the I gotta rewash the guy. I don't remember that part. I thought it was in the Autobi. No, but the, the, the people who killed Malcolm X, they plotted it in Kings. And for weeks Kings is, King's was like the centerpiece of the Newark Mosque. And you still gonna eat there. That's crazy. It has new od. I'm joking. I'm, it has new od that, that macaroni and cheese be hitting Nigga. Let me see. While We are here, can anybody unpack the Young Thug tweets for me? I don't. I I don't, I don't know. This was a topic that I was like, you know what It is cool to podcast and say I just don't know.


Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I'm waiting for music. I talked to some Atlanta niggas. They're like, Joe, you know, I said no I don't. I'm not a street nigga. They say, yeah, but you understand the street lingo. I said, I promise you I don't. Not today. Not currently. Yeah, I don't get it. Then they read me the tweets. Yo Peter Wham is coming to Bam, pray up, load it up, down Boogie. No, no Boo. And all of the street niggas, man. Oh, Shit. He talking about Gunna. I don't know that he's talking about Gunna. I get he wants to work with Lil Baby. I get how Lil Baby feels about gunna. They saying the ti feels the same way about Gunna. I don't know that I'm staying outta Atlanta business.


None of my business. I don't know. I don't know. Release music. I heard him tell the judge I want to do music with the, with my guy that's signed to me. Which makes sense though. That makes sense. This guy is signed to me. Yeah. I am profiting off of this. Who's Peter? I don't know who or what. I don't know if that's, I would like to know Peter Metaphor or something, or Wham Wham is Lil Baby. That's his, that's his like nickname on him. Yeah, nickname. He's wham How the fuck do I know that as a consumer of music? He says, has he been saying it? Wham, wham, wham little baby. I thought that was George Michael shout outs. No. Alright. So he's wham he's wham. Alright, wham.


Let's, so they got the billboard. What, what, what is and Thug said before, whatever Wham says goes. Okay. So I guess that's where they're, if where, if Lil Baby has been the one that's been calling gunna a rat and Thug is kind of stamping that by whatever Lil baby say is what's happening. I don't know. But that's where people are saying, yo, you know what he mean? I think that thug could go do music with Lil Baby 'cause that's his man and go do music with gunna 'cause he's his artist. And it don't have to fucking intertwine. But maybe I'm old fashioned. There's a lot of people out here that are waiting for thug to tell them whether gunna is a rat or not. That's just That is true. That's what I'm hearing. Yeah. That's it.


Everybody's waiting for th we have been waiting for you to tell, we to tell us to say or can we fuck with him or no? That's true. Okay. I'm no street nigga. But didn't thug come home? Yes. Yes. Without Ratting. Thug did come home. He's home. Right. All right. I'm lost. Who you trying to say? How could he have been a rat if thug is home? That's not true. Yeah, that's not true at all. The the, especially with the prosecution right next, some of the stuff that the, the prosecution fumbled the ball a lot. They fumbled the ball. So, and not just that. If you told, and I don't know if he, y'all are saying what I'm saying.


No, listen, but that prosecution fumbled the ball. They asked that don't mean that, that don't mean that you didn't give evidence. Listen, he could have given adequate ratting and they listen, listen. Oh, if he ran the part of, of part of gunner's what he had the cop to, in his plea, what he had to acknowledge, there was a car that him and thug were in and there was a gun. Gun and some drugs in car. The, some drugs in the car gunna is on record. Now this is where, I don't know street nigga lingo, but he's saying it's not mine. To some folk they're saying and the fact that yes, YSL are gay to some folks that's ratting. If it's me and it in the car, it's not ratting.


I again, that sounds like ratting. It's not. And this is where it gets gray at because you got some people saying that's routing. You have other people saying, no, it's not. It's like down the middle in this room. It's not ratting. If me and ice in the car and it's guns and drugs in the car, It is yours. Ice is supposed to say, yo, it's not mine. I'm supposed to say it ain't mine. And there, there you have it. But when he got on the stand, that's not how I was raised. When he got on the stand and said YSL is a gang, that's the rat part. That's more Ratt. That's the part I was talking about. 'cause the point is they have proved already now, if, if, if your artist and people close to you are saying this is a gang, all we now have to do is prove you are the head of said gang. And if I prove that you are head of said gang, then the Rico charges now are applicable.


Yeah. How is that not right? I don't understand how that's not ratting. How would you, you said that's not how you was raised with that car scenario. What happens? You, you, you and is in a car, guns and drugs and y'all get pulled over. Well first when we get in the car, first thing I was taught first thing, let nigga know you're dirty. Right. But past that. Exactly. Y'all in the car and, and, and y'all and we, and we carry our own case. So whoever gun It is gotta say It is theirs. That's And what happen if he say it's not his, I'm not saying anything, but the problem is if he, if he don't say nothing and then I say it ain't mine. That's like saying it's his that. And that's where the people are saying Gunner is. Right. Right. That's the problem. Now everybody saying it ain't mine. That's different. But if it say I'm not saying shit and I say, well it ain't mine.


That's saying it's his. Now, if it's his, he should say it's his, he shouldn't put the case on me. But it's not that, it's not ratting. See why just mind my business's lot of rules. Shit. Yo, I don't give a fuck. I feel like I'm the spider. I don't give a fuck you home. He home, Woody home. All these niggas is home. Everybody home and I'm home. I yeah, but you still don't want, but you don't want, I could understand not wanting to fuck with somebody who put me in jeopardy. Especially if that wasn't the game plan. And we all in this together. There's this, these aren't civilians. I don't, that's cool for this rap conversation we have. And there's nobody else that's gonna put me in jeopardy. I put myself in jeopardy. Everything in my, everything that happens in our life. Yeah. But we willing to. No, that's bullshit.


That's bullshit. I'm telling you, I live, I'm not telling y'all how to live. If I get in the car and this nigga was dirty and now we go to jail, before I get to all of that rat stuff, I'm getting to, well how did I get in this car, Joe? If I, me, I'm telling you what I do. True. Not telling. That ain't, that ain't the scenario here. The scenario here is we both are committing crimes together and one of us got caught and now I'm putting it on somebody else that that's, that's, that's allegation. See I know them committ, that's lost. That's the allegation. I don't know. I don't, that's where I get lost ain my business. I'm just saying that's the allegation. It doesn't mean that they don't commit crimes yet. Only they know the ins and outs of their relationship and the ins and outs and intricacies of their particular dealings. I wanna see the thug tweet when it's time to go to studio with Gunner. That I just want to hear. I don't wanna hear no thug tweet that.


That's my tweet. That's my issue. Go ahead and just put your shit talk. I wanna hear it. My thing is, if you home and you just ducked a trillion fucking years, don't put no tweet out that could implicate you or that suggests that you were involved in anything or get you right back the bullshit again. Just don't say nothing. That's the crazy one that to me, I, we should be having this conversation if I just came home after I ain't tweeting shit. But if I do, it's gonna be like where the ribs at, where, where, how do I get the Kings You know what I mean. It's gonna be some shit. Ain't got nothing to do. Nothing to do with crime. Yeah. Fuck no. Or any street shit. No street, nothing. That's true. I agree. I'm up with that a thousand percent. And that's why I said some of that shit, especially a tweet that's like leaves up to, you know, interpretation.


Exactly. What does this mean? What does this mean? Especially knowing they gave you this stupid long probation and they just waiting. They are dying for you Salvan and they do anything so that they could come grab you and bring your ass back. And again, one of the terms of his, one of the terms of his, of his probation is he can't hang with known gang members and they've already acknowledged that he's a gang. So now it's much easier to track who you're with. So if you're with somebody who's a known gang member, got him, they got you again, was it not for the purposes of music or was it period? Two people, the two exceptions are for music, brother and gunna. That's it. Yeah. Nobody else. Nobody else. Yeah. You, you can't, it's brother and gunna. And that That is a common tool that state uses to lock people up.


Indeed. They cast this real wide net in, in California they got civil injunctions against gangs where if I hang with any known gang members, if I hang with a blood, a Crip, whatever, I can go to jail. And they don't have the exceptions. Like if I'm at Thanksgiving dinner with my cousin who's a Crip or my, you know, Christmas with my brother who's a blood or whatever the thing might be or bigger than that, a nigga might not be active. And he could have been right in a gang when he was 13. Yep. He's still a known gang member. You get what I'm saying? He's a gang member.

So Not right there in Hackensack. That's a good point though. I don't Know where he is. Tell you, I dunno about Georgia. But lemme tell you the few places where you can park schools. I know personally. Hey, hey, they got parking, they got the where? I bring you up. Hey Inglewood right there.

Now this new age shit they doing since the NBA got TV rights. It is not coercion. You're just paying now. It's in the video, it's coercion, it's a service. Send the video. It's notion, if I'm paying you for something to convince you to do something that's not co No, I'm not convincing you of anything. Yeah. I paid you and you did it. That's a job. Yeah, that's a transaction. It is coercion at all. I know what you're saying. It's not, it's not legally coercion. It's not not illegal. It's just you're coercing somebody. But it's not illegal. Maybe it's not coercion, it's incentivizing Shit. Money is the biggest motivator. Incentivizer, I don't know the coer coercion, Incentivize. I don't Know.


Coercion. Well I think coercion is the right word. I just think if you talking about coercion, like in the literal sense, It is coercion. But yes, but legally it's not coercion. Coercion is the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats. That's Why I said, that's why I said incentivize Not CO's not coercion. Anyway, I'm hiring you those y'all wondering. It is a buck 50 and up two 50 if you sold a million records, Two incentivize Two 50 is crazy. What? No it ain't no the fuck. It is not. No it's not.

If anybody here had the situation where a side got pregnant and were threatening to expose you or tell your family or just keep it and raise that little ba two 50 is too high of a price to pay. No, I'm asking.

But yo, this nigga is a dy. It's so fun to be able to pull from history with your coworker. All right. Shout out to Maria Miranda. Scientists for sure. Shout out to Young thugs. Y'all to gunna too, nigga. I don't care if you ratted. I don't give a fuck. I ne I never hear the word rat again in hip hop. I don't see what they have to do with music. Nothing. Nothing. Yeah, I don't care. I just don't care. I'm gimme the slaps burn. That's it. Make slaps. Yeah. And gunna got 'em. So go ahead and act like you don't wanna go to that studio. If you want Lil Baby been with Central C and all these other, Hey, hey, you better get updated since you home now on the temperature who's hot and who ain't shit done changed a little bit and I'm talking shit.


'cause I do think baby is baby still Lil Baby. What you mean stop it. I'm just asking what you mean? I think Lil Baby is still Lil Baby. What does that mean, Joe? That Lil Baby could get in the studio and put out a hit. I think he could make one. I think he could come up with one. I think his name calls for a certain, I think when you say the name Lil Baby, it sits at a certain tier. There's a tear there. He ain't off that tier because he's off of his hot streak and has been, he's not off that tier. But the music, I think that tier has dropped. Maybe if it hasn't dropped the notch, it's trending downward. Like It is about to drop his show Price ain't dropped. His show price ain't dropped. It went up. His show price dropped. And I think he was preoccupied with what was going on with one of my closest friends.


Yeah. And if he, he couldn't make nothing hot, let Thug walk in the door. Oh no, for sure. Like they, they, like I said, they're teasing a record now. So, or whatever. They teasing. Absolutely. There's something coming there I'm sure to, I'm talking about got more beats. I'm just talking about Lil Baby ain't Lil Baby today that he was during that run. He's put out saying baby it ain't even, he couldn't put, it ain't even like, he hasn't put out shit. He's dropped saying well Now that he's back th is back that he, he might be him Fan. My man was looking at life. I'm running around doing all the political posturing that I could possibly come up with to keep my ass from going to jail. I get all that. I'm running around with Stacey Abrams and everybody else doing I'm music is the last thing on my mind at this point.


I I, and I agree. I'm just saying if you were doing that and not still dropping music, I would subscribe to that. He still dropped and everything that he's dropped was mid, was mid, mid the midst of mid. But again, I, I think that might go back to I'm not putting forth my best effort in the studio. I'm just doing, I'm in here on some You know what I mean and I ain't gonna crucify him for that. When everybody been mid, with the exception of fucking 6% of rappers, everybody been mid. Yeah, but you're, you've in mid time, you're in that 6% of rappers who ain't been putting out mid Yeah. But until you, until you were alright. But now that I'm in the mid class, nigga, I'm the best of the mid class. Don't none of you mid making niggas look at me a certain type of way.


Mid making niggas mid makers. Yeah, the mid makers you mid make can't look at me. I I, my last joint may have been Smith, but you niggas can't look at me like that. That's funny. The nigga, the niggas up there and above maybe could say, all right, He ain he off his name. I would agree with that. Hey, and I, I I'm a fan. I just want, and I just think that the niggas, niggas got a synergy that all 'em, Atlanta niggas got Thug is home. I think it's a fucking family reunion down that bitch in Atlanta right now. I wouldn't hear Posse cut. I wouldn't hear. I I wouldn't, Ima I wouldn't be surprised if ti I was in there rapping. He said he retired. But I wouldn't be surprised if he went in there. You know what I mean. Like I just think everybody Yeah bro. Now I'm gonna get mad. Everybody then I'm gonna get mad man.


Nah, can you get mad? You can get mad at that. Just the fuck. I can't Why I want people that say they retired or retire. That's your business. And he was asking me if I could get mad. Everybody retirement don't necessarily mean it like yours. Some niggas would be like, y'all retired. He retired three weeks ago. I know I retired from making my own projects. It was the other day. I I might do a verse doing features. Yeah, I might do features. What he said. He said, I don't feel like jumping around on stages to entertain people. Oh, I took it different. I took what? That's what he said though. He was like, yo, I'm just tired of jumping around on stages performing in entertainment in context. I mean he said that after his, he retired from performing is what his retirement was from performing.


That does not mean I'm not still dropping. I stand down there. Mm. What does retirement mean for you Joe? What's retirement for you? Do you you never gonna make any songs and you stopped, done, served, served My Time. What does what it mean when they, when they, when they leave the fucking Honorable, honorable. I've served my time. Honorable Discharge. Got you. I I've filled my requirements. I've done completely out Got it. Yeah. There's no song somebody could give away. Like when niggas talk to me about my retirement, granted whole different ballgame. But when niggas talk to me about it, I put 17 albums out. I put 17 albums out. I've toured, I did the big, the big places as an opener. I've did the small places. I've I've traveled, I've on all the girls there, all the girls. I stood on couches. I did the unattractive gig.


I did the good gig. I got a a nice publishing check. I got a horrible, I I did everything there has to do in music. I did it. I left the Fulfill. I didn't leave feeling like there's something more that I wanna do. There's nobody that can call me. Niggas call me all the time for features. There's nobody that could call me and get me outta what I'm saying because it don't, I don't have it. I don't have that desire. So, so, so I have that desire. So you gotta tell me Hold and you about to say hold now. Go ahead. I was about to say, I I I'll say hold, but more like I'm thinking about songs like Reservoir do like songs that like you look back on 20 years later and it's everybody and Imam was on it and it was Fire. Benny called me for one of those a few years ago. Oh. yeah. you know about that. Benny called me for one of them with all of the rap rappers. My type of joint, my style track.


No, I'm retired. I would've loved to been able to play with you. It's like when the OG ball players see the nigga say, yo, if me and you was on the same team, man we'd have got busy that I ain't going to look for sneakers. Got you. And I didn't, I didn't take what Tia said that way until you just said it like winning a $71 million suit or however much it was. And then saying I'm done hopping around or being the fish performing. I took that, I took performing. I mean I'm done being the fish in the fish tank now. Yeah, that's, I don't to succumb to the rules and regulations of music. I don't have to tour for a check. That's how I, that's how I took it. See, I forgot the tour But. yeah, I put it all together. Right. But okay, I, I received that 'cause I like what three stacks does. Except for when he grabbed the flute.


But like a surprise verse here and there, that shit he did on Kanye shit. That's still probably incredible. That might be the best verse since it happened. Yeah, probably. I don't know if I could think of a better one, but I like that. And at some 0.9 figures I'm coming back. I'm gonna give him something. I'm gonna give him something I am. Oh yeah I am. One verse, one verse or one EP or one project. 10 minutes. I am gonna give him something my time, God forbid. Unless God, you know, has a different plan for me. But if it's up to me one day I'm coming to to a couple months from now. That's not what I said. That's what I heard said nine figures. What time do y'all be having talks?


It be 10:00 PM I'd be awake still around 10:00 PM I can get into that. I wanna announce to all of y'all out there that Fridays has filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy. And I told them niggas when they took the Jack Daniel shit off of the menu, that that was a bad idea. That was the only shit in there. That's it. Shit. But they put it with everything. Yeah. Jack Daniel shrimp, shrimp jack chicken steak was the shrimp steak chicken Jack Daniel. They put Jack Daniel with everything. Hey yo dog. I ain't gonna hold you on on on one of 'em off nights. I call the motherfuckers and get some Fridays to go right there by Cole's.


Fridays is my favorite Of the poor places. Yeah, the poor shit. Yes. Fridays is the best poor place. I'm from Philly. We're we're just the greatest Fridays in the, in the country. That is true because Allen Iverson was there. Oh yeah. They ain't had nothing to do with nobody. It had nothing to do with the food. It nothing to do with the other food. They used to call it Club Fridays. I remember they had a velvet rope outside. I remember like it was the biggest Fridays in the country. I'm talking about Fridays for me the eighties. When, when Allen Iverson Iverson was on the sixth. It's this one specific TGR Friday on City line. City line that the whole entire Philly IE every batty in Pennsylvania would line up to go to was a club. It is a club, you call it Club Fridays. And so if at my young age, you know, you waited for whoever Allen Iversson was going choose.


And then it was an open field for the rest of the night for every other dude in there. And the options were better than any club in Philadelphia. Wait, what? Wait, wait. No, no, no. So wait, if you were in there, I've been there. They was in the So y'all waited. That shit was in yo bro, don, don. Alcohol don't don't alcohol disgusted and foreign nigga That is what everybody does in every club in America. That shit was different. Hey, if y'all had to wait till he left, then cool. I had to wait till he left. You still found the love. I had to wait, I had to wait till he chose and you, ooh, that's what I'm saying. Hey yo dog nigga, if you, Alan Iverson was outside, you talking about Quentin Richardson, who else would he be talking about? I talk about Allen Iverson too. Yeah, when he was outside and I was 19, nigga wasn't him.


I don't know if it was, y'all don't have to explain that to me. I know. So when you said Allen Iversson was in the spot in Philadelphia right after the six, my nigga, he was clearing any and everybody out. So you didn't get a shout up, yo. I mean I don't really, that's, I'm saying shoot the ball. You know I don't shoot the ball much. You didn't get a shout up. But when he left it was open gym then I get what y'all saying, it was open gym. Ain't nothing wrong with I was, I was on the court. I just, yeah, I mean I didn get there, but once he leave he, I be talking again. Right. Once that nigga leave you live, all your moves come out now handles Off. the Wall hoses off. Nah, that shit was, it was a different game. It was a different thing. We just different but nigga you pardoning, I'm not pardoning you.


I'm telling y'all, you saying there's no dude in no world that could get you up outta there. That's not what I'm saying. No, he won't say that. And they, some of the niggas that he saying, that's what I'm saying. When I was 19, now Iver got me up outta here. I give respect to way too many men out there. He was 25 back then. Alan Iversson is getting you the fuck outta of it in Philly. Y'all not, y'all not arguing. What I, y'all not responding to what I'm saying? Saying y'all just saying facts and I acknowledge those to be facts. Okay. I'm saying I'm putting a shot up. Oh, while he's there. But you know I don't shoot with him and Im have to learn. I'm gonna have to, he, I'm gonna have to respect him that way. True. And that's how I un understand you. You're not scared I out nigga. I'm shooting ba ba and I learned Ain't nigga Allen here. No, no, no. Don't do that again. Okay. Well that, that's, that's what I'm talking about.


That ain't what you said nigga. We wasn't sitting on our hands. But you know, he had, if if you he said it That is what I'm saying. It's a room full of women in in there. Right. Anybody you hollering at that's came in there to see Alan Ivis and she cutting the eye the whole time to see if he gonna choose if, if he's doing something else. I, I like my chances, the number two option in the, in, in, in the Fridays. But until he's made that choice, it's all speculative. It is all up for grabs. That's all I'm saying. Listen, you found, y'all found the love of your lives. So it worked out. It worked out. It worked out. It is best to not in front. Hey It is best to not shoot it every basket. You right. You such a frontrunner. You would've been there. Right. Nigga just standing there. Oh hey I left. I got a ball, I got a ball, I got a ball. Whatever. All y'all would've been there doing the same shit. Eating your three for all the case potato skis waiting.


Never the case. I'm getting a shot up. I'm not saying you, we all got shot up. Maybe two or three. We all got shots up and I might Iverson jersey nigga this bitch might be too drunk. Fuck talking about, yo, I'm Bubba Chuck number two. Oh Shit. Yo, they stink a fucking fool. Yo. I hope that Fridays is just doing the Red Lobster repackage I. hope so. Yo, it was, they said it was 600 Fridays. I haven't even seen it Fridays in a minute. It's 163 Fridays now. And them shit is dropping. Yeah. It is one near like yo dog and that, that number's probably going. I wonder if I could buy Fridays. Don't do it. And bring back Club Fridays. We Allen s that you get by five.


Allen Anderson. It's us. Oh, I'm shooting. I'm Bernard King of this business. Oh man. Like, nah, that shit was, that's fucked up. Has anybody here seen the Kodak and Kyat stream? I I did, I did not. I personally, I ain't like it. That was a trick just to get ice to talk shit. I'm not talking shit about it. I actually, I, I watched quite a few clips. I even jumped in on the stream just to see how it was going. I, I like what he's doing, but the Kodak part, I ain't, I didn't really, Kodak was clearly fucked up.


Like he got fucked up as the stream went on and you can see it. He went from looking like, well we know Kodak has, you know, he's been vocal, he had problems, whatever started looking like Polaroid. But you start to see it like he was like, I I'm not even, I'm just doing it. I'm not doing it. Go ahead. Yeah, I'm not doing it. Yeah, I was fucked up. I'm really corny. You're better than that. I'm not saying Yeah, that was low. I think in forties it's time to be corny. That was a little go ahead. But But, yeah, once he got to the point where he, I mean he was damn near looking like dude out on the corner like Mr. Wendell. Like it was bad at that point. It is like, come on dog, we somebody, I felt like somebody should have not stopped the stream because I know that's the goal.


It's, it's, it's like this marathon thing for, I think he's doing 30 days or something. But I do think somebody should have just came in and, all right, come on, let's get him outta here and let's just keep this going. Like I just, I ain't like it personally. I hate that shit. Didn't like it. That's too much of that. He was slurring. He was, he looked back. I don't like seeing, I don't like seeing Kai s not Kai Kodak under those conditions at any time.

So he started the stream seemingly sober and they said it was even one point during the stream I don't know if, how true It is that he threw a perk up in the air and dropped it? Like they said he basically got high. No, they said he did a trick. He, well not, they said I seen that part. He did the trick like with his mouth taken a perk.
