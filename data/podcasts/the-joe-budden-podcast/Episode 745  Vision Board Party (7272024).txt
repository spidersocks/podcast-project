I wonder if you guys should call your bro, call your bros over and do a Vision Board Party. You guys Should absolutely do That. You can get a whole bunch of magazines and cut shit out. I would never want y'all energies by my vision. Vision board is totally an energy thing. Never that, never that vision board with my friend group. So what is a vision board? A vision board is where you create a visual of all of the things that you wanna manifest into your life. Oh, Affirmations and manifestation. Well, I mean like, let's say you want a yacht that's, let's say you want like a $10 million home.


These are the things that you Put on your, For vision. Like your vision board was kind of what you was trying to explain to ke last week. Like When, you was like find the fans. You Got pictures of niggas face Profile pictures on this vision board. Where is this person? Show me where? Location. Yeah. Chicken nuggets. All Right. You don't need a vision board. Should look like the B board. Yeah. FBI board. You skip it. Yeah, You can skip it. Wait, so wait is you never did a vision board? Nah, I never did one either. And Flip never did one. I I've never done one. But I'm not opposed to They dope though. I've Done words I've never done like cut out magazines. You did one For real. A Collage. I've never done a Collage. That's how L got here. Oh Shit.


Oh, you did say that? Yeah, you did say that. So Wait, wait. Actually all actually all my kind of dreams came true off that one vision board. I ain't gonna hold You. Why? I didn't do another one. I won. All right. So you started again. You fuck up nigga. You crazy. No, no, it ain't time yet. I gotta finish on my path from the last vision board. I'm kind of enjoying the shit. Got it. Last vision board. I ate. I did my big one. I was up there. Hey mad shows fucking success. Cookouts, bitches. Fucking I anything Yo. My next few years was the latest. And here come her baby on the end. I love you baby.


And here comes a baby now. Oh. Letting this away. But it's cool. I'll get to another one. I'm 45. I'll get back to it. Mm. When I'm 45 I'll get another one out there. Yeah. I ain't against the vision board, shit. Nah, I'm sure this is fine. I'm just, I like, I was referring to the, the parties. 'cause girls will have a party, there'd be 20 of them. What's a Vision? Board Party. Well, When a bunch of girls get together to do to their, their vision wine and drink wine. And it's an Excuse to get on the same board. No. They make their own boards. No, they make their own like the little court boards with the and and they share it with each other. Yes. That gotta be the most stupidest shit I've ever heard my damn life. Why am I sharing my vision board with you bitch? Not like that. Not calling you a bitch. I'm saying to the people like why am I sharing my vision board?


And on top of that, my problem with affirmation and manifestation, no disrespect to anyone that believes in it, is you gotta work for what you want. So are you basically motivating yourself? Is that, is that motivation? Yes idea. But it's a clear cut path To where you wanna be. Like it's, it's a, it is a clear cut path. Got see. You Can work a lot without a direction. You've Never read anything about the law of attraction? No. He is never read it. Never. Okay. All well, All our Questions. I read 40, I read 48 Laws of power. You Need to balance that shit out And 50 these laws of power. Right. That Too. Exactly. Balance that shit out. But yeah, it's like the, it's calling that shit to you. Got it. So basically saying that if you have to, The universe will conspire with you. Got it. Whether your shit is negative or positive, that's the whole point of it.


Alright. I'm the universe and I'm conspiring against this. That's, it's over there Because he ain't gonna go do a vision board. No, I know he's not at all. So we just explain. Read a book.

No, I support all the New York girls for the most part. That's a fact. Yeah. Shout out there. She's from New York. I ain't going shit on the young girl from New York. Well, in the next topic, I am in the next topic I am gonna show. Not album wise, I take it back. Not album wise. I want, I want her and her album and her team to flourish. That has to be a dream for a young girl from the projects in the Bronx to get shit popping in a matter of three years. She just came out when the Covid happened. Work. That's a fact. So I. That's a fact. So I mean why Shit on somebody so early. That's a fact. Now She gotta get a couple more years older. Now I think that she need to leave Cardi alone. I got that the same way I had Doja and I mean, not Doja.


Whoa, Whoa. Slow down. Whoa. Sorry about that. Whoa. That that, that's another hypo racist. That's another hypo racist. She Got slap some of these racist got got some fire. Little glitch of the Matrix. No, I'm talking about Bia. Bia. I got it the same as Bia and card ice fight. Especially after listening to this album. Should never, she shouldn't be thinking about, she shouldn't say nothing to start with a C. She shouldn't say Cardi Barbie Barty. That doesn't start with C Marley. She shouldn't sayi Dotty. She shouldn't say none of that shit. Did she discard? Did she say something about her? I don't know. I don't know.


All right. That was the word out there. That was word on the curb. Of course. Ice. Do you know? I don't know for sure. It was very vague. But the internet gets the internet And. it says, oh, she's talking about Cardi and Subs and, Okay, the thing about a sub is, excuse me. Even if it's not about You, if you take it and respond to it, you've made it about you man. Made it about you. So the subs happen and Cardi said something already. Yes. So when that happens is even if it now, it's about you regardless. True. And the bar, the bars are pretty vague. I don't remember exactly. They're very vague. What? They were very, but you, you fell off kind of shit. So, I playing with trees. Really? Yeah. Yeah.


Where's the thing I a jiggy. I Got it here. There we go. Think. Let's see, let's see. She pretty, but bitch, pick up your, it was funny. I be likes, I'm a sy bitch. I really do this light-skinned. I'm black You can all my hair, I get money. And then shortly after Cardi Tweets might throw a Couple dollars to that. I ain't gonna lie. Good. Throw my way after the podcast, after that. Cardi Tweets, these bitches have absolutely lost their mind. I'm getting all my lick backs on my album though, on each one of you bitches.


And then she said, these bitches can't see me in numbers or status. Y'all had way too much time to catch up. Can't see me in money. Can't see me in real estate fashion and can't see me in person either. I'm not in a rat race with none of you bitches. And I'm gonna show y'all So. I agree with that. Me too. It shouldn't even have to say that. I don. Yeah. That's why I don't get why she gotta keep saying it to the newer crop of chicks. And I guess that was part of her problem with me is bunching her with the new crop of understand Chicks Because this is sick. Like you gotta pick your bags a little better than this. Yeah. That that shot wasn't direct enough to be jumping out the window for, to me, maybe So I ain't even gonna stand on that Ice Ice was talking to her.

I love Jim Carey, but don't fuck with Yes men. I need honest ears. When in the studio turned down the movie road to finish the album, I pray the album is good. Clayton nigga outta the hood carrying water, chopping the wood. But you gonna always have motion if the product is good. Lord knows it's crazy how I can just text ho. Alright, I see what he did. Yeah, I sold the internet, got into a little bit of a a hubbub wondering if Wayne, who's featured on this record was Dison the boy don Don't know if he was but we can give it some analyst ears.


Here we go. Love mean like a face mask. Gimme real love with that. Like alo O I'm gonna need love from your hat. Real love, love Mary. Need less. Yes more. Amen. I'm gonna need more real prayers and hands. I'm smoking straight gas, no brake pads. You smoking Bubba Nigga. Straight trash. I get more a deep the whole dick but couldn't take half. I take a nigga life before he take the stand, take some drugs and take off.


Take some businessman bear. That's what they were thinking was the dream. Yes. Yeah, Because he shut Teddy Graham gram. You gotta be kidding bro. The internet is internet. They looking For everything. He's not dressed. He's not distancing Drake. He's not. No At all. No nothing about that. Sounds like a Drake dis to me. Nothing. And it's fire. He was floating. It is fire. He was floating. I know Cord A got some heat because every, at least I bumped into him outside at least four times. And every time he says come to the studio, I have heat.


It's the strong indicator. Yeah. So he probably has heat, having heat. He probably, because everybody says that, but When you persistent in it. It means, oh alright. He might really have heat over there that he want people to hear. Shout to Corde. Shout to cor hear Yo. you know what was on my mind. We talking about Wayne, you had said something on the part a while ago, When, you was saying, I know how Wayne feel about Jay-Z And for a while I've been thinking because I meant to call you and say, how does he feel about Jay? Because we were talking about if who's the greatest or if Wayne's the greatest. I forgot what it was, but that stuck outta my head. When you was like, I can't comment on Wayne or compare them. 'cause I know how Wayne feel about Jay.


And I wanted to ask you, did he feel that he was better than him or he respect Jay as like, I didn't understand that When you said that like I know how Wayne feel about Jay. I didn't understand what you meant by that. Everybody feel like they're better than Jay until Jay walk in. Yeah. So he feel that he, okay, so, okay. And even if you do, that's what you meant. Wayne, Wayne Wayne knows who Jay-Z is What you think. Do you think or you feel Wayne feel like he's better than Jay-Z or he or he respects Jay-Z I think every rapper feels like they're better than everybody. No, come on. At that level especially, Seriously, I answered it. If Jay-Z's not around, Wayne is thinking I'll kill him. Really If Jay-Z is there, the the proper hierarchy is in place. It's like LeBron on the Olympic team right now.


Ah, everybody on the Olympic team on the E-S-P-N-A hundred player, top player ranking is better than LeBron James. Everybody there until it's two minutes left in the game and we all on the court, like looking at these games, You can see that LeBron is better than some of these people. You, if you have eyes, You can see it. There was a span though where Wayne, even if I respect you as who you are, Wayne thought he was better than Ho and Wayne. Wayne. Yeah, of course he did. Wayne fired at him. Didn't know. I didn't know. I don't believe that Wayne fired at him. He, he stuck stake his claim. He was like, Yo, I don't gonna fuck about none of that. I Still don't believe it. It Was, it was in beef. It's Rapper's, it was in beef time to have false bravado and say all of that slick shit on records, what you believe will show over the course of your entire career.


And there's never been a phase in Wayne's career where he is not publicly saying, Jay-Z is the best rapper in the world. Yeah. And and I, he is, I model some of my skill after him. Well he definitely said that. Now, now Jay gave Wayne the same praise when he was on that run After Melii came up, When he was on his mix tape run. And When Wayne was on his run, he gave, He said Yo Wayne was from a different planet right now when Wayne Was on his, I'm the greatest rapper Alive Run. And he treated it and he really believed that. He, at that point, I don't think he thought Jay-Z was better than him. I think he has such a respect for hov, especially when it came to what HOV did to get his business right for him. 'cause Wayne was fucked up and whole got, right. So now when a person do you like that, it's like I could never even publicly, even if I feel, even if I feel feel that way, I'm never gonna go against him in any way.


Now I believe that I don what Niggas do publicly when they go to bed at night. I do think That Wayne, They know what the list is. I believe that there was a point when Wayne thought, can't none of y'all fuck with me. I'm the greatest even with him. Do you think that I must be LeBron James if he's Jordan? So that's what Wayne said himself. And if all y'all wanna call him that, then I'm the newer version of that and I'm better than that. I, I i is Jay, would Jay still be considered a top rapper or it's like a legacy act? He's just a top ledger. He's always Gonna be a top rapper Compared to anybody, Anybody, anybody. Everywhere. So nobody was able to knock him off of that. I mean it's, it's, it's, I mean Drake Drake came the closest. Okay. Drake came the closest I think to Knock and hove off the top rapper.


I disagree with that, but I passed my Drake quota of for the year. you Know what I'm saying? I said it came the closest. So how can you still be a great rapper with so many new rappers? If You on a metric, if you on a metric level, then, then yeah. What was I just talking about? I was just talking to somebody about this. The problem is most of them metric people lack the respect and most of the respect people lack the, The Metrics. Ah. So yeah, Drake comes closest if we keeping the metrics. Yeah. But, But, but the respect drop a little bit for Drake because again To Yeah, to Got it. Those who really do it wants the right and stuff gets Drake Walking and knocks you down. Like Your peers can see your holes when Drake walk in the room.


His peers are not looking at him the way that they will look at Jay-Z when he walks in the room. Facts. That's what I'm saying. And that's not a knock, that's not, Ain't got nothing to do with I records strictly Rapping to the Parks in closing. The reason why I said that Joe, is because I remember when Biggie was, you know, when people came from the Biggie era, they consider him the greatest. Right? And then Jay-Z came along and then now he replaces that. But we're saying that Jay-Z been around for a long time and nobody has gotten to that position. It's kind of crazy to me. I gotta listen to more music. Well that's, that's to us because we was right there in that whole era to those who came after us. They don't hold ho they don't hold, hold that high.


Okay, got it. Okay. So. I got it. It's all generational. It's all okay. you know, there's people that You can argue And. it will fight you over that shit. Like Bro When, you say Jay-Z they laughing like, but I look At you guys as as as music buffs, So I would think that you guys would even if, you know, put the bias aside and say, well I can see how somebody would say Wayne is the best So I guess the Generation. I say it all the time. I say I I completely understand when they say Wayne, I'm never mad at them for saying Wayne. He has a lot of stats and accolades and proof to back up him being on somebody's or as someone's greatest rapper of all time lists. If at number one it makes a lot of sense to me. It's just, I don't mind, I still got hold there. Got it.


Yeah. Ended like that listen ended like that I was on your ass. That was perfect. No, that was perfect. Was coming right for him? No. No sir. I wasn't gonna get, I was, I was, I was gonna get him. No sir. Ain't nothing To get more music. More music. What else, what else happened in music? Oh, we Rock dropped and I haven't heard of yet. He Did. You dropped a I think it's like seven songs. I wanna Say you have to hear it but I hear it's nothing. But he, I Played the master killer record on, on the Positive. That Sleeper I Like it. It's all, it's all like posse cuts. Oh great. I haven't listened to the whole thing all the way through, but what I've heard is Dope still gotta be awake when Rakim walk through the studio door. That's true. Can't that's Absolutely Truet. Give a fuck how old you think he is. Go in there, let the old nigga at the park start giving you buckets. Start cleaning you up, shooting that overhead jump shop.


Yeah, you better be careful. That shit don't miss that shit coming playing bitch from back here. That shit be Water. But he don't rap Old though. Nah, he don't. I mean he rap the same kind. Yeah, The same. Was there anything else in music that I'm, I'm missing the DJ Premier Shout Supreme. You put a record out with Wayne Ross and Big Sean. Yeah. Oh, this was the other one that had him thinking that there was some Drake and Wayne stuff. Yeah, because, because Wayne is featured on the Ross and And Ross is featured. Yeah, that's it because he's again, they just trying to make something outta nothing. Did you, you heard the of course. Oh yeah, of course. Stupid question. You Worked on the record. Yeah. I was gonna play his sleeper book. My bad Bro.

Why Did that to my face Paul And Yo? you know, he'll work with anybody. Alright, so now, now I got an opposite view of how they look at the Ross and and Wayne feature together. Maybe this was fucking Wayne handling business for D Drake. Why the hell did Ross jump on there? Oh, I gotta talk tore. Yeah. Oh, I'm gonna talk tore. I'm gonna find out the story behind this session. Why would Ross leave that verse? Did did he know Wayne was coming? Get on anybody track pre Wayne Dre Preem normally tell you who wanted the way to the studio.


He don't normally let it be a surprise. And it's an intercom. Yeah. Yo Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo was Ross. Was Ross by the intercom. Ross left that session early. He left. Oh, you wanted, you left after your verse. He He mailed this one. He emailed it. What? What? What little Sean did Big Sean did. He did The damn. Oh yeah. Smart. See Big Sean ain't no dummy When. you hear one of the greats just doing something like that. See that's why I'm not mad at nobody that got Wayne as number one on their list. But what I'm saying is you Go Back to it the best can you everybody could be the best.


I'm talking about the people that's of a higher pay. Right, right, right. You are the best until the best comes when that Grammy shit came up. And this is respectfully of course 'cause I have Wayne High on, on on my list as well. But when the Grammy episode, when the Grammy performance came and they had to do, God's did.

I ain't get dark. I didn't get dark. He told about he was God and he was Joe I think that Oh well you know honestly, maybe it's because the performance is still in my head and that was Ah really?


Yeah, like the black stage, the fire, the brimstone like it was, you're right, it sounds they had brimstone. Well that's what it looked like. The imagery was just, was very, I don't know, almost biblical. So it's like, I guess that kind of bleeds into the sound and the perception of the song being kind of Christian esque. No you didn't never work for the source. I Ain't lie. I love her. How many mics? Yeah, She's, You know what's so crazy Source with Mel is fine. I like it. Mel would be in the zone mentally.

He don't give a fuck about Democrats, gays, the trans people. Oh, his son slash daughter replied. I got that too. So you know what Elon is on. So if you're buying a Tesla, then I feel like you're putting money into the pockets to support that. So if you're a Democrat in a Tesla, it's just, it's just funny. Huh? Just funny. But Elon said he's not donating that money. Yeah. Elon a Elon is a liar. Oh. But if You, if you, Elon Musk is a liar, but Then you're still trying to quote unquote protect the environment.

It's the world of marketing, bro. Yep. That's it. That's what we living in now. That's where we at America and the presidential candidates remind me of record labels and signees.


Yeah, That's What it reminds. It's crazy Me of like you cutting a red ribbon or something. When, you buy a new building and you get a Yeah, this shit is crazy For many, many reasons. But that's all Ikea to share at the moment. Hi, You're Both here. Hi. Oh, it's good to hear you both. I, I, I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl. Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic. We called to say, Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and, and into the Oval Office. Oh my goodness. Michelle Brock. This means so much to me. I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both And Doug Getting out there, being on the road.


Don't put that white man on the road. I Just wanna tell you the The words, you got the black vote now. But don't put that white man out there with you now. Now she could do that. Doug could stay home. She could do that. You both. It means so much. And they can do that. We're gonna have some fun with this too, aren't we? There it is. That is Barack and Michelle endorsing Kamala Harris. My mind is not, my brain is not all the way fully developed. So now that I'm seeing nothing but Kamala Harris, everything Kamala Harris reminds me of Melfort. Why she do Look like you? Y'all have the same bop y'all have the same, like she could be vibe the same, could be an older sister rhythm, the same Mercy or muscle soul cold.


Like the same facade. It's like the same. Okay, so does this make you regard her fondly? Of course. Come on now. Come on now. I couldn't be fond of you. I'm I'm just Checking. So I gotta be fond of her. I'm just checking. Yeah, they got, y'all got, there's something going on there. There's something going on. The, the support she's getting is really, really fascinating. I mean, there was a call white women for Kamala and over 150,000 participants on these Zoom calls. Like I was On there, I Was not there. I was not there. Alright. Only half of her, I'm sorry.


And they raised like a million dollars. And now there's some man named John Cooper. He's like, okay, come on white boys. It's our time. It's time to shine. Yep. They send, they send me the Email. I haven't gotten the Okay. Nah, I'm sure it's, it's Gonna, if it was 150,000 women Participants. Yeah. It like you only Raised the male At the moment, I guess. I don't know. Come on, Come on, come on. Damn. It's just good Bro. No it ain't, nigga that's $7 a head. Don't do this. Some of 'em are, some of 'em are pregnant. Yo on bro. The Messies thing on the planet. You can't help yourself. You can't help yourself. Yo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


$7 a ahead. Yeah, don don't think that. I think that's great. I think that's great. Okay. Now, and also Trump is saying that he's reluctant to debate Kamala Harris now. No, They're saying he completely backed out. He shook. No, he said he's still deciding. Well, They released a statement. Yeah. Oh, and the statement says, The statement says, oh, here we go. From the Trump campaign statement on general Academic debates. Okay. Oh shit. It's from All State Statement. From act. No, it's from Trump in Vance campaign. Okay. Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party general election debate, details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee. There is a strong sense by many in the Democrat party, namely Barack Hussein Obama, that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat Trump.


And they are still holding out for somebody better. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds. And this is from his Campaign. That doesn't mean he, that doesn't say he backed out from him. He's just saying that he's leaving it up on them. When you guys, And this is already from, I think he foul, he filed some type of suit. Two, about two suits, about the money being transferred from the Biden campaign to the Kamala Harris campaign. Oh, for real. So When I heard this. I was like, okay, I can see people saying that he's afraid. I think he's too stubborn to ever realize that. He's afraid. Agreed. So I'm gonna lean into, he's really mad about spending all of that money he spent thinking he was going against Biden.


Agree. And he just wants to wait until the Democrats decide that she's the one. It's been a week almost. She's the one. Well, well first it been official. Yeah. Yeah. She's not official yet. They didn't officially say she's the, not The official. And right this second, she is 1% behind Trump and the who's gonna win the shit. Really? And she just got a massive donation from the ex CEO of Netflix. He donated like 7 million to her super Pac. Not that massive. I mean from one person, one donation. That's not, that's true's chump change. That's true. What's something Alright, Well when them niggas over there is sending 45 a month over that, that's seven.


Look a little bit. That's why I said that. When. you said you look a little chump Dog. I said 150,000 people and only a million dollars. Y'all looked at me like I'm crazy. Where does all this money go To The campaign? the Obama. I mean the Obamas Podcasters Fucking the new Beverly Hills cop. I See Eddie Murphy. They moving with a whole team of people. Yo from state to state to state to state market and all the other shit. Rallies. Got it. All the events on the trail. Oh Joe. Law enforcement. 20 year olds that just gave up on life. You get 20 Over cheap though. Never got nobody. I don't know. don don't know them. Niggas might wanna make sure that they siblings is taken care of.

I wanna know how they pitched the shooter to think that there's a chance he would live afterward. I know they did. I know they did. They didn't tell 'em Yo after this. We gonna blow your fucking brains out. They didn't tell 'em that. No, you Can't tell 'em. They gave him some hope. You doing it for your car Yo? No, they Tell we will leave The ladder On the side. Climb down like they told 'em something. That's be, there's Gonna be a car running. 'cause the parking lot right behind it, it's a car running boy. And if you get caught, we'll, we'll we'll park.

I can't get away from it 'cause hard knocks is such an amazing show. But I'm really mad 'cause the giants look totally incompetent on the show. They Look crazy. They look nuts. They look nuts. They Look crazy. Anybody with half a half a brain is saying why did, did, did they not know that cameras were there for some of this stuff? Oh shit. Damn. Like they went a look crazy. But anyway, the new episode that I watched really makes you feel like football is modern day slavery, new slave type shit. Like I have a problem with hearing Brian de ball say attaboy and there's a lot of attaboy. I get it.


Football, it's like that's like the slap on the ass on the basketball court. I do get that part. And it And it's really, But hearing them say that and then hearing them at the draft combine and on shit watching these players, that Shit is bodies. That was the one, the combine is that was the one when they were sitting up in there and the bleachers and just looking at these boys running jump. I was was like ugh. At a boy. It is nasty. Crico on Up. The combine's always been a little, it's always been gross. Yeah. don don't like That shit. They should do something to make it look like less racey.

If we're gonna do political clip, that's all I got. Oh man. This is Gerald Ford shit in 1989.


This is Crazy. Mr. Ford, what advice would you give a young lady wanting to become president of the United States? Well, I hope we do have a young lady at some point become president of the United States. But I can tell you how I think it will happen. Okay. Because it won't happen in the normal course of events. Okay. Either the Republican or Democrat political party will nominate a man for president and a woman for vice president.


And the woman and man will win. So you'll end up with a, a president, a male and a vice president, a female. And in that term of office of the president, the president will die and the woman will become president under the law or constitution. Okay? And once that barrier is broken from then on, men better be careful Because They'll have a hard, hard Time Ever even getting a nomination. God, hey I feel 'em. I say that to these brothers before every pod.


Be careful y'all Yo. What? What year was that? 89. Well, while we here, fuck it. Would you rather have the black president or the white president who got 1.7 billion off the price? I think they want the White guy show him down. Wait, that's real. What? He said that's real. But these did he too, is that real? Did he really say that? Yeah, he really said that. That's not ai.

She went, you know, ah, also a good move. It was like, Eh, eh, I'm tired of the move. But it's been very effective for the past Five, six years.


Yo the state of your mental health. The one place we don't give a fuck about that is during the live tour. The live tour, your mental health, you have to stay home now. Yeah. Yes. But that's a difference. We are live in front of a live audience. This audience is live stop. We did meet and greets. Some of these niggas have drove from other states. Some of these people have flown in, right? We don't go on tour so often. These people want to see who they wanna see. You get up there with your mental health off. That's on, that's on the stage now. That's on the crew. That's on us. And that energy is gonna affect the rest of the people on the show. Let's not make it about us right now. Let me hit the clip, Bobby to death. Bobby's a good person.


Start with love. I feel like everybody good. Let's be real. Like don don't have shit bad to say by nobody. But when people pay they hard working money. See he's saying the same thing I just said. I don really Care about that. So when I'm on stand up tour and I'm selling out these tours and then me and Bobby be able to come together and people are paying they money to come see us, I really want that to get better. I don't want it to be the same. don don't want. That's a fact. I don Take nobody money. You can't get it again. Let me, let me start. He lemme say that if you can't get the money again, you don't need to be doing don't it. Don't. That's like anything with promo. If you're doing promo, don't be out here trying to scramble for money and take people hard work money to just do it and use your platform and then go about your day because it's about long like relationship important.


So the fact that I feel like I was, I did stand up before and I'm still doing it. So, I understand. I'm learning how to entertain a crowd. And, it is not the same thing that you get on Instagram. This is real life where people are going to look, I love Bobby and they want the energy and they want the feeling. Slide it over. And I feel like Bobby was stiff a little bit, you know what I'm saying? And I'm like, Hey man, let's, let's really, really work on this. Like, and I, I paid script writers like let's really get him a show. Mm. He's killing us. And when she told me that's not me, Bobby was like, my comedy is me not talking a lot. And I'm like, shit, this is different. Like You can do that on the podcast, but in real life this is different. So her comedy was different from what she said from what, what she wanted to bring to the show, which I could respect.


you know what I'm saying? There's not nothing about me getting mad. I'm not saying you doing nothing. You get the point. Listening to, listening to funny Marco, I mean this is the very polite, nice PC version of what he wanted to say. I thought he did an amazing job explaining that. I will toss it to Bobby so You can hear a little bit about what she had to say before we discuss. Are you recording? Yes, we're recording. Bob Mark Go. I guess this is, this is how we're doing this now. Oh there's chops in it there adding to I Video. I video. Not gonna lie, I was a little shocked. So here's my, my version of What Happened. Last year we were supposed to go on tour. Okay. And I, what's t backed out last minute?


Because backed out. My husband had just left me. I just had surgery and I was super nervous going into this because I was not prepared. And I text Marco and I said, Marco, I'm so sorry to do this but I'm so depressed right now. I literally wanna myself, he doesn't reply to me. And then he unfollows me. I Woke up from surgery actually to him unfollowing me. And not only that, in the coming weeks he would go on multiple podcasts and talk about how much he didn't fuck with my style of humor. Fast forward sometimes. Yeah, come On, get to the t, get to Thet. I'm Like, I actually felt really good about it. I felt like I really got outta my comfort zone.


I really felt good about it. And he's like, yeah, you killed it. It was great. Fast forward a couple more weeks and I hear from my team that he canceled it and I'm like, what the hell? Marco canceled the show. Like why? They're like, don don't know So. I'm like calling him, calling him, calling him doesn't answer me. I'm like, okay, congratulations on the baby. Doesn't answer me. He just won't answer me. But then he is tagging me in post to Taylor Swift dancing and being like, that's Bobby. And I'm like, okay. At least is so cool. Fast forward to today. And I get tagged in a video of Marco standing by a pool talking to everybody about why he canceled the tour and like, Mm, You didn't play the rest of the part was She's, because she's too long-winded.


Too many words. I got it. It's too many words. I got what she later went into. I, I am socially awkward. I have social anxiety. So that wasn't my bag. And I explain tour to Marco Flip. You said that they were on tour before. See I don't like that. No, she, they weren't on tour before, but they were supposed to And she backed out. Okay. She backed out because, so they never actually went, did any dates with each Other? No, not before. No. But this time they did a couple of shows and Marco wasn't satisfied with how she was on the show. Like see now wait, slow down, slow. I'm sorry to cut you off lip. Yeah, because they never did any shows. Don't mean that work for the tour didn't start yet because tours have to be set up. That's true. That's true. Worried about that weeks and mumps in advance.


So if we set all these dates up with all these people behind the scenes figuring this shit out and then when it's time to rock and roll, you pop up with I'm depressed. No, just silence for me. Yeah, yeah. No I got it. And no, there's plenty of podcasters out there. And also my question y'all, 'cause I'm all over the place now is what is divorce etiquette When work is involved, when you know that your coworker is going through a divorce and that could be a strenuous time in their lives, but work gotta get done. The work gotta, because in this moment I don work still gotta get done. Y'all don't give the fuck that you going through a divorce. If we have a tour set up, don don't.


Yeah, that's me. That's me. You gotta, You have to be able to check some of that shit at the door unfortunately. But that's easiest said than done for some people. That's true. Based for some People, based off your experience in life like this, we don't know stay Home or don't agree to go on a tour that like I I, I watched Marcos grind. So I understand he he come from where we come from, you know what I mean? So he understands the struggle and you know, just being determined to Get to It. To get to it. Yeah. With her, she probably not, I'm not judging her, but she probably had it easy a lot. you know what I'm saying? And, it is just easy for her to just back out of the tour. And for some niggas that put a lot of work in that shit, like When I give you a second chance 'cause you backed out before When I give you a second chance. I'm expecting you to be on your A game.


You know what it sound Like. And now in the second chance, yeah, you bringing that internet awkward type of comedy to our live show and it's not really translating, it's not resonating. And then I'm telling you after every show and you like, no, that's what I do. Wait. Now the first time I hear that should not be on tour. True. No, But I agree with That. you know who fault that is too though? Hers Both Because from what I've, you guys can correct me. Mm. You've never been on tour, but some of this stuff should be rehearsed. Some of this stuff or the direction at least of the content should be rehearsed to where We know the direction so she can't even get up there and pull the quiet shit. I I tell y'all all the time, Hey actually when we were doing tour rehearsals I said 1 million times there's really no such thing as rehearsal.


Yeah. We could be as prepared as we want to be. Yeah. We could have our segments totally different. But When, you get out there under them bright lights and somebody drop a ball, you just drop the ball. Gotcha. But also, But you gotta pick it up. He come from Why But Why was he thinking that she was going to present any other way than what she has presented as like I I'd never seen any other version of her other than that quiet, awkward kind of weird staccato style of interviewing. So I do think that there is a little bit of fault in trying to book fucking don don't know Griselda for a club tour. Like if that, like it is the wrong, it's the wrong fit F first to respond to to respond To you not the right person for the right gear. Right I don, I don't like that Grisel the example, like I agree apart, If you book a Griselda for a club tour, you know you off.


Like there is not saying to them we're going on a club tour. Like that's your bad, it's nothing that deko alter to make that their thing. If you, if you're a comedian and funny Marco come from standup grind out tour, so he know what that goes into that. And I assume that Bobby Altoff is in that same vibe she said because they've had those conversations. Yeah. When she agrees to go on tour and we go work on a show. 'cause I I'm sure that they went and worked on something for the collaboration. No, they, okay, hold on to answer you. They come from more of the improv. Yeah. Right. So that's where they come from. Gotcha. So he's treating it as such and he has conversations with Bobby behind the scenes.


So he's expecting that to translate on stage, But, and she's Comfortable. That's what Said. And she's comfortable with Marco. Yeah. She may not be comfortable and Yeah, True. No shook A wall, Minnesota and You go home. And that's What she's saying. She's saying that I suffered a level of anxiety that I didn't know was gonna Come with No, but no, but he's saying that. No, but no, he's saying that You can act like that on the podcast. But of his meaning that he has engaged with her, like you said, it's a comfortability thing. So he's expecting it's, he's sitting here, you sit there, let's get into a conversation. So if I'm throwing something at you, I'm not expecting you on stage in front of man people to Clam up to freeze up, Clam Up. That's dead Drops dead hit. Hit your line. Yeah. But podcasts are like a controlled environment.


The stage is the complete and total opposite. So this, this might have been a little bit of her not really truly understanding that Or Herb not being as invested as he is. That's what it sounds like to, To its both can Be It sounds be true because for her to be able to just say, Yo, I'm not, this is who I am, this is my style of comedy. I can't do this. Meaning you don't have much to lose here. You're not invested as he is. But he, he putting this together. So like Yo, this is a tour. I got XY behind the scenes shit done. I've invested in here. He sold, we gotta make this work And Wait, hit a minute. Hold up, hold up now. Yes. Yes. Because It's easy for that person to walk away. To me, this is the same conversation that we see with, with the viral streaming artists trying to go do real shows.


It's not the same world. This is a internet world versus trying to do shit World. World, right. Like as an actual entertainer. Performer. That's right. All right. But Look, these kids aren't necessarily built for that shit because they're used to just pressing the upload button And reading the comments, re replying to which comments they wanna reply to, et cetera. Et But You can say the same thing by yourself though because you please you, you come over one sided on here. But when we did another show, you showed a different side to you. Yeah. You didn't, you wasn't the one liner. You were more involved for sure. And then I, I was aware of that because behind the scenes we had the conversation. Right. So what I'm saying is that I think Marco did the same thing. He's saying that put that character away, that shit's not gonna work here show me, show them the Bobbi Althoff that we know. Right. See and I feel like that's not even Marco's job to relay this information to her.


Got it. Like that's on her team. If, if this is her second time trying to set up a tour, I'm gonna assume that her team has expressed to her the importance of hard ticket history. Ooh. You might be trying to build hard ticket history. And if that's happening, then when somebody comes to say to you, Hey, what we doing out here ain't getting it done, that it is time for you to fix it. Right. It's not time for you to say, that's just what I do. You know why You can say that is because I don't, I don't feel the same risk. You feel I'm not as invested in this as you are. So it's easier for her to say Yo, that's just me. This Is what's wrong. Time to learn that in real time. I, I agree.


Wrong, wrong time to figure that out. Somebody could say before the tour started Yo, I'm not feeling it. I'm not rocking with it. Hey the money ain't right. It don't feel good out here. Yo do it without me dog. And even that's fucked up because now I've set all these venues for our audiences, not for me. Like he come from stand up, he could have easily went and went, did his a 300 seater and been fine. Right, Right. Shouting on both. But I just thought that was a really interesting beef. Yeah, it is interesting. I, and I tagging her and ignoring the phone calls is definitely a little bit strange. I'm hot. True. Yeah. I'm fucking heated right now. Don don't, I don't think that's So. I don't So I. How do you respond to that when Somebody, she's grinding my gears but I have to promote and make it seem like we're cool. We're on tour. Hey look y'all, anything that I got hot, I'm adding my people.


But in real life, bitch, you know what's, you know what it is with me. I just talked to you this morning. That's True. The show gotta go on So. I gotta make it. I'm with you on that. I gotta make it seem like shit. Is O okay over here? Yeah. I put up that gang picture of us. I still had smoke from my head from the Last nigga. I hate Joe. Hate Yes. Oh just me. It is Just me. Crazy Yo. That was that nice. Was that, was that nice to say that your t As I was writing hold A lot of, anyway what's up?

Just severance. Oh Well yeah. Everyone take a backseat for a little bit.


They put, the problem is they put the money into the shows but forgot to promote 'em. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody knows that Apple TV has no fire today outside word Of mouth. You do not know that Apple TV has this much fire sitting in there and We do not have an Apple deal. No, we don't want one. 'cause it sounds Like we do one. I'll take Them. I tried to get one.

She was titanium. But back to Presumed Innocent job well done.


Really creepy ass family to any of you guys. Who guessed who the person was? I won't say y'all did a, y'all did a phenomenal job. I was half right. I thought I had it. I thought I had too until the very last little two. Yep. They had to put little twist. That was my guess initially in like episode one. I said Yo, it's this. Yeah. Yeah. I had it and I was like, oh You motherfucker. Yeah. Curve ball but high take, high take for me. Let's go. Carolyn Palus deserved that shit. Oh shit. Jesus crazy. Whoa. Carolyn Palus absolutely deserved that shit. Why are you sitting? She was talking crazy telling a 16-year-old girl. Yeah, she was talking crazy to her.


Well bitch, I'm gonna be here for life so tell daddy get ready. She's pregnant. Oh shit. Call back. I get your call back. I get your call back. Alright, well no pregnant lady deserves that. Obviously this, but we're talking about fictional television. I'm saying No, no, no, no, no. Mel don't Get out. Don't do Don. If you wanna fight for women's rights right now, get out because that's not what I meant. Oh. you know, that's not what I was saying. didn didn't hear what you said. No, I said she's pregnant. I meaning m hormonal. That's yes. So. I just don't want them to kill me for saying that the pregnant lady should have died. Okay. But in terms of the fictional show, I'm saying her saying all that she said to the 16-year-old daughters like, well what do you, what did you expect?


She was talking not to die. Well, Well that's your bad she rock. That's your I know Actions, actions have repercussions. You can't just do and say what you want in this world without there being repercussions. Mm. I know Me and you don't know that life. No, No, no, no, no. This is the same fucking argument that I had when we were talking about love and death. The same, what is love Death argument. Turn I don Dunno what you're Talking about. It was about Kandy Montgomery and the a being the axe murderer of her former lover's wife. The, you are literally saying the exact same argument. No, I Don't remember the argument. My argument was basically you were like, oh my God, he what? So she deserved to die. I was like, there is consequences for everybody's actions and that affair could logically have led to where it did.


That was my exact argument, Man. I don't even remember. Don't even remember what that, what you're talking about. The lady that killed you, Don. Remember Jane Montgomery? The lady that, the neighbor, all the HBO show, the neighbor that killed That. We were all obsessed for those seven episodes. Okay. We were in that. Y'all remember? Come on. We were fucking in that A neighbor killed who? The neighbor he was. He was fucking the neighbor. He fucking the neighbor. They made a deal, deal. The charts, the stipulation, the charts Of it was set up in like the seventies. Oh, I remember this. It was, and And it was coming back to me. And what was I arguing? What you're saying is that was my, you're you're, you're basically giving me my argument back to she Can't wait to get shit on. That's Who cares. Like what did you talking about? Don't do that to her. You care.


What you get your argument back, man, Shit from 500 episodes ago. Don't anybody even remember this. Alright, go ahead. You was right. Your, your Memory. You was right. Your memory is very selective. No. Like, whoa. Your memory is very selective and very convenient. Yes. How do you think I've succeeded for 43 years? What? You, you're not surprising me with something here. I got you. But okay, so, all right. What she said was fucked up. But I mean, does that warrant, like her getting an, getting a poker to the head On the show? I guess. Yeah. Yes. Okay. In real life? No. No. Okay. Like you can't say that type of shit and not expect and turn your back and turn your back.


Not expect nothing. Turn your back. That's kind of what she turned her back. Not saying you deserved it, but if you speaking to somebody that way and then turn your back Lil Powow. Why you getting at the bare minimum? Why are you getting sassy with a damn kid? And why you trying to keep the kid of a nigga you hating? Want nothing to do with that one. True. Hello? Hello. Wake it up. Bring it to the register man. Say something now. So say Something now. No. So we're, are we, so are we spoiling? Are we just gonna go ahead spoil? Are we just gonna go ahead and SPOILER ALERT? Because what I wanna say is being protected by the spoil. So if we're gonna fucking do a whole SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT, okay. Fucking SPOILER ALERT the show.


This ain't the first time we spoiled the show. Spoil spoiled fat. Fast forward then fast forward about don don't know, 45 seconds, maybe like a minute. Fast Forward through this product and I pay cash. You say the same thing. Does he not say the fast forward? No kidding. Okay. Okay. But you Was right. And Tory's in jail. You still making slaps The part that was so farfetched to me. The series itself was fantastic. The way it was shot, everything, acting, et cetera. The part that was the most farfetched to me was his reaction. Him cir, you know, circling the block, coming back to the house and he finds her fucking dead. And then all of a sudden he has the wherewithal to make it look like, to disguise the scene.


Like in that moment. And it's limited time that he's got to be there. That boy Thinks on his fees. He's a lawyer. That shit was just, it was quick. It was just too farfetched. It was just, it was just, it was too farfetched for me. I was like, wow. Wmp, wmp, wmp. What, what was time period? Didn't, he didn't like it? He didn't like the ending. N not that part. Really? I didn't Like it. Like how, how much time did he have? I thought it was clever. Didn't they? Didn't specify how long it took him to come up with you? That that was my question. Like, was it, did he have five hours? Did have No. How much time? How much time do you want to spend in a woman's home that literally you just saw alive 10 minutes ago and now she's brutally fucking murdered.


How much time do you wanna spend in that house? I thought something Gave it away to him that he thought that upon who or what I'm trying to cover up as much time as Needed. You, you've, you've literally been to the house already. You guys had your, you know, your exchange with one another. You leave under the, probably the pretense of, you know, you guys are, are not in a very good place, place with one another, which is what we come to assume. You come back, you spin the block, you come back and now she's murdered. And it's been like, what, maybe like 10, 15 minutes. And inside of that time you're like, who the fuck was here? And now you're assuming it's your wife. So it's just like, how much time are you spending in the murder victim's house? But he didn't assume it was his wife. In his story, he knew Yes.


That it was his wife. I saw the car, I went back. He saw the car. Yes. I went back that night and I know what you did. So he wasn't assuming So he had to wear it though. He Said he didn't see the car. He said to something about putting a tracker in her car. Well, same, same kind. Same thing. Yeah. If the tracker's in the Vicinity, no, but I don't think that he'd had the tracker in the car prior to all of this happening. I think he put it in afterwards. No ma he knew that his wife went there. That's what he told her. He Knew his wife's car went there. Yeah, he knew. He knew that the car was there and His wife's When. I won't. And that's when shorty came and said, no Dad. Oh. Oops. It was me. And listen, this ain't so farfetched to me. Sometimes you be in the middle of a good six to eight month cheat.


You think you love her, that's your baby. And then your fucking girl do some shit or say something And it snap you back into oh shit. And I wish I You're right. Never man her. No, you're right baby. I, I love you. I bugged out with her at all. I out. I thought I wanted to be with her. But home is where the hardest, even though. And now you gotta cover up the body. I feel 'em. I'm not mad At her either. The daughter is a weirdo For sure. She's a weirdo and she needs therapy. It's funny that, wasn't they in therapy? Yes. The fa Well no the daughter Wasn't, the daughter was never in therapy. That's the other part that jumped out to me. Couples therapy. Then the wife stole the therapist. Hey, I needed alone therapy. The daughter never hit therapy and she's sick in the head.


I couldn't believe it. I told y'all Yeah, you said it. I said it too. I ain't watch one happen episode. you know it took that shit Where you get it from. You saw the movie. Same as a movie.

Like, and my drug dealer shit, they would've known that dude was informant from episode two and killed him.

Do it for 19 more years and then I'll talk about Tucker Carson in the same breath as fucking Joe Rogan. Until then, sorry. And Joe Rogan's been on a tear. He has been on an absolute tear. What else? What else? What else? The TNT crew. TNT has officially, the NBA has officially divorced the N-B-A-T-N-T team. Yes. Yeah. Okay. After This season, Amazon made a offer. Yeah, Amazon made a offer.


TNT did intern match that offer. The NBA chose the Amazon offer as we knew that. I think we said that on the last Patreon. Amazon been doing a lot though, man. Throwing boxing events. They been doing, Amazon been Taking NFL on Thursday. Yes. Oh really? didn didn't know that. Yeah. I think they had a playoff game too, if I recall. I, I noticed that And, it looks different. Amazon shit look a little bit different from ESPN shit. I've been watching it. They Do. They do. I got a quote from Barkley that says clearly the NBA wanted, clearly the NBA has wanted to break up with us from the beginning. I'm not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money. But the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future.


The NBA didn't want to piss them off. It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks. I just want to thank everyone who has been at Turner for the last 24 years. They are the best people and the most talented and they deserve better. I also wanna thank the NBA and its fans, the best fans in the world. We're going to give you everything we have next season. That is from Charles Barkley, Judge Charles And what and what the deal consists of. Amazon will now have weekly regular season games. NBA playoff games. NBA conference finals, the SoFi Play Tournament Emirates NBA cup.


It says a new Black Friday game. WNBA Commissioner's Cup Championship. WNBA postseason and Finals Global Distribution and the NBA and WNBA league pass for the next 11 years. Wow. Oh shit. Big bang. Take little back. That's, that's exactly what that is. There still is ESPN and a bbc. Yeah. And NBC's got a new deal. I think it's Sunday night basketball. I wanna say NBA on BNBC theme song is back. That's All I know. That's my shit. Hey Marv Albert. I ain't gonna lie. They used to smoke the pre-game intros a little better than TNT but Chicago Bulls have been on top of the Eastern Conference for seven years.


They start showing some clips, some background music. Will this be the year Reggie Miller overtake them or will Pat Ewing yet? They smoke that shit. Nostalgia Would want me to have that as a afternoon game though. That's how it used to be. Yeah. Sucks. It's nothing to Watch. T and t puts out a statement. It said we have matched the Amazon offers. We have a contractual right to do uhoh and do not believe the NBA can reject it. In doing so, they are rejecting the many fans who continue to show their unwavering support for our best in class coverage delivered through the full combined reach of wb. I can't see is that O or DD Full combined reach of WB D'S video first distribution platforms including TNT Home to our four decade partnership with the league and Max.


Yeah. Our leading streaming service. Yeah. I Watch a lot of Max. We think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 25, 26 season and beyond. And we will take appropriate action. Mm. We look forward however to another great season of the NBA on TNT and max, including our iconic inside the NBA end quote. Oh Shit. Fight Max fight. This shit ain't over. That's what it sound like Max. It's over. No, It's over. They done fucked the wall. Fuck about that. Listen, Take us to court. Okay. Hey Yo dog, them different lawyers. This, this ain't SEL and Barnes nigga lawyers.


Turner's got Selino and Barnes fucked up Toos. What you think? What you think Big Jeff got? That's what I'm talking about. Oh okay. No, I'm talking about Big Jeff. Oh yeah. Big Jeff. Big Jeff. Yeah. J Jay Money J yeah. Ted Turner been rich for a long time. Very. That's cool. Yes, yes. That's cool. That Bezos money different though. But it's cool. Yeah, no doubt. Nice little slug fest. I don't want everything on streaming though. I will say that like I do like the fact that on on TNC as a fan, I could watch it on TV if I'm somewhere with this tv. If there's not, I can put it on Max and watch it there. Being completely restricted to only Prime is gonna be kind of whack for the average user. That's true. And for like the bar business and stuff like that. Like That's true. Nah, they just gonna subscribe to the package. They subscribe. Yeah. Maybe the bar, it's the same way they did with the BA Sunday ticket that moved over and you just have to subscribe to a different platform now.


Yeah. But yeah, just coming in the house and turning on the tv. 'cause you know the game is on you man. A lot of people don't. It's the fourth quarter you was driving you, you know what I'm saying? And you just cut it on that. That's gonna ass bro. A lot of folks, myself included don't even have that. Me too. Where You can turn on the tv. I don't have a cable boxing on none of my TVs. But you're in the minority. No, I'm, I'm, I'm a minority of course, but I'm, that minority is growing. There are a lot of people this, it's just like having a home phone today. Pause. Pause. Your Minority is growing Yo. That was Minority report. Oh That Was, I'm trying to give us that minority. I I'm Pay it. I pay it, I pay it. But yeah, that is that that is, there are more people joining that side.


Gotcha. Listen, when everybody's money is like that, it comes down to vision and foresight. True. Right. So what does the vision look like with t and t? What does the vision look like with Amazon? And like Charles said, When, you think about the Future in tech, they been wanting to get their money gonna be crazy. We going, we Gonna double up the NBA is not gonna continue to watch what Roger Goodell did last year in the last two years, which was go get money from anybody with tech, anything. Amazon, YouTube, whoever Got it. Peacock cut The check. True, True. Adam Silver, who everybody says is one of the best lawyers, he ain't playing that shit. Cut The checks. I don't know that there won't be games to come on the way that y'all saying 'cause I don't think he's finished.


True. That's a good point. That's A good, I think there's gonna be plenty of carve outs and he gonna put the NBA games anywhere that he's able to put 'em. Just not TT. Depending on how ironclad that That content Content. And I might even come back to TT after I'm done moving around saying I don't need this amount of money from you and I'm not offering you this, but I'll give you such and such games for the year. I'm going through that now with the Knicks. They don't have no fucking season tickets to gimme so they gotta pick packages. Yeah. I gotta pick some shit packages. So they gonna pick some games and yada yada yada. They might, they might come back and do that with TT. They could. So we'll see. I don't think this is the end of this. There are also reports saying that whoever purchase Amazon and ESPN would like to hire the team from I'm sure inside the NBA.


Yeah. Inside the NBA. I'm sure Barkley has been, has been, has been, has been solid. And if we're not on TNT, I'm not doing it. I'll retire. True. But things may change. Barkley also Like that money Is one of them. Yo, listen, they made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Yeah. It's no such thing. Stop. True. There is a such thing. No, it's true. I'm saying no, no, no. It's No such thing. What? Well, yeah, you're right. There is no sustain. Yeah, You can. But what I saw floating around was that people were offering 20 million and I, and I paid attention to this just 'cause pocket watching and this is my field.


20 million for the cast or the show Each? No. Okay. I think Barkley's smart. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing right now. To Do what though? Yeah, the show Run that up. So now if that's accurate, don don't know 'cause research. But if that's accurate then You can see Charles Barkley saying, Don don't think it hit the same. Like just on a That's a very expensive show. I know. It, it's, it's, it don't sound a lot because of the people that we're talking about, but 20 million for a show. I just think that Yeah, but If it generates that, yeah, I think that I think that their viewership is the way it is because of them.


It is like Yo. It could be a bum ass game. And you again, you just at home, you ain't doing shit. You'll cut that shit on to hear the dialogue from them, bro. I, I'll go two halftime and not watch the rest of the game. Yeah, That's, I'm saying that's what I'm Saying. Post game because they have good games that come on with Steve Smith. No disrespect to Steve Smith, Jamal Crawford and 'em do some games. You're right. But I can assure you that the N NBA's not looking at it like that. Maybe not The, the NBA rights is where the package is. True. Part of why they looking at TNT like is because t and t just keep pumping this, Hey we have the inside, the NBA. True. True. They going a whole different route.


Not only do we not care about that, but there's 20 million athletes now with a microphone giving their opinion and having a bold take. True. And That's true. That's true. True. We could get this figured out. We could get it figured out if we have the rights to the game. You could take your show somewhere. Yeah. 'cause don don't think I But see don don't even, don don't even, no disrespect to those gentlemen. I don't think their show would do nearly as well without that PM slot. Again, you just get comfortable at your house, hearing them make you laugh and jokes and shit. The white people's gonna divide and conquer Dog Charles, you wanna retire or go down with the ship. Now I'm giving more money to Ernie if I can get Ernie Draymond, CJ McCullen. I'm just freestyling Now if Ernie is sitting there, I can get another show.


I can get another show like this. Gimme two of them. If I get Ernie and Kenny or no, Kenny, Ernie, and Shaq. Think You can get, you Think You can get, I think, I don't think You can without I. don know if You can You think You can get another show like that with just two of 'em? Yeah. Yo, I don. I don't know bro. The comedic pieces are the important pieces to Me. Wait, I'm not saying just two of 'em. I'm saying if two of them are seated there. No, I'm saying You can build around It then You can build around and that will be the new version of this show. Maybe that's what they're gonna feel like. Maybe I don. I think you know chemistry though. That's true. I think you need, I think We need, we don't know what NBA players have chemistry. That's that's What I'm saying. Until you throw 'em in the throw Until you throw 'em in the pot. Pot, it's a gamble. That's true. So you throw 'em in the pot. Listen, I'm gonna miss, I'm gonna miss it.


Word. I think it's one of the best shows ever created. Absolutely. Ever. So we'll see. We'll pay attention to it. I agree with that. Next season is the last one. Let's make it a good one. No, They gonna make it Cr Yo watch. Yeah, because bar his mouth is, wow. They gonna, if you know this is my last year, he'll say some shit. What they gonna do? Fire me. Right. He's a wild boy.

Oh man. From someone named J Daniels 0 94. What's up JD What's happening Daniels, can you believe there are people out there that were born in four just getting born in 94? That Shit is crazy. Like how you was born when ready to die Drop you missed a slaps nigga. Alright. J Daniels says Politics, privacy and peace. Over the years I've slightly judged Joe's approach to dubbing. Serious. Lemme go back. Over the years I've slightly judged Joe's approach to dubbing serious slash educational and or political topics with bird talk and jokes in order to keep the pod air quotes fun.


Yeah. Given the current times I see the importance in our platforms having these type of talks. But boy oh boy did I get learn on IG real quick? I saw a post from DL Hughley, which is where it can get tricky if you know, if you know, you know, shout out to dl. I saw a post from DL Hughley and on the photo it said Trump praised project 2025. Without thinking. I asked a genuine question out of curiosity stating, can someone please clarify when and where Trump praised project 2025 up your Toast buddy. You are boy fish food. You are fish Food. Because my sources are showing the opposite.


Boy, why did I go and do that to his ass up? These niggas called me everything under the sun for asking a question. LMAO. Oh this heard under the elevator. I was called a slow child illiterate, a fourth grade Trump supporter. I am not a Trump supporter, et cetera. Only two people sent me in the right direction. And everyone else was just spicy and mean. Never will I ever engage in a political convo via the internet against smart man. The wolves and political gang members learn me political gang members. I see why they, are They banging too? They be banging shit. Oh Man, that's, well they the real gang members facts.


I see why Joe stays away from it on his platform. But why do political conversations have to be so aggressive and argumentative by design amongst us, by design? Anybody wanna help j Daniels 0 94 out? I mean a lot of it has to do with the social media sites encouraging that type of behavior because it raises engagement and gets people to comment. Yeah. Like rage baiting. Correct. Yeah. That's a big part of it. I I think that politics and religion were two things that you were just taught not to discuss. And this was way before social media came. That's true. True. s true. I think with the politics and the religion, you start to question somebody's Moral code.


Moral Rules there up. you know what I mean? Just a bunch of personal shit. So if I'm looking at you and I'm judging you negatively on, on a personal light, we can start beefing. you know what I'm saying? Like on some Oh you did that, you, you follow him. But then that means that you're, it's some bullshit. Right? So, I think that people have been taught to stay away from it. 'cause that should be breaking up friendships and families and all of that. But Only recently it's only since, No, that's not true. Maybe it was more prevalent. I'm My whole life. No, my whole people Have been saying do not, you always discuss politics, religion since we were kids. No, I, no, I I get that and that's absolutely true. But I would say that the conversation, your child who was before mine?


Hmm? Your child who was before mine, Your childhood who was before Shut your ass up. Both of y'all. Y'all niggas childhood was different. That was in fact, you know, just basically the common thought. But I'm saying in terms of the last couple of elections with Trump entering the fray, that's where people started to, you know, kind of like whoever you aligned with. It was like a personal alignment. you know what I'm saying? So that is what I feel like in terms of like friendships and family members starting to like I think he bought the mud slinging. Yeah. Right before we've ever like 'cause this has always been two sides of the aisle. Yeah. Right. But When, you think about like when John McCain and Obama were running against each gentlemen.


Exactly. Gentlemen and John mcc. McCain lost like a gentleman When they would boo Obama at McCain's, he'd be like, no, no, no we're not doing that. This is my friend. I've known him for a long time. He's a good quality dude. We just disagree on certain things. you know what I'm saying? When Obama won and they started booing McCain, he was like, no we're not doing that. You get what I'm saying? Like we're not gonna do that. Trump is out here inciting people to call people names and to bash people and to do all of that other shit. We've never really seen that in politics. pre-Trump. Especially on a on a, in local politics. Yeah, but on a big scale. Yeah. I mean big stage. No we've never seen that. And then sprinkle in the fake news shit that you brought. So now When you bring down don't believes anything. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I think they they learn you something.


Yeah. P like you already said, politics and religion have always just been divisive. Uber Divisive Made for you to argue if you bring it up and as you get older, you don't want to talk about fucking religion once you learn how many Christians there are out there, nigga it's Christians. I ain't know them niggas were deep. I thought it was just St. Ish up the street from All of Yo. You go to jail them 5% of niggas. I thought it was just St. Al's. The St. Mary's, you know you talking about. Nah, mention the other ones. Yeah. Which other ones? Any of the other ones. Christians is number three on the list of The ones to Worry about. Oh I didn't know that. The Catholics. Nah, no, I'm cool. Yeah. Oh you Talking about he even scared to say him. Yeah. Leave the but no you like even When, you go to jail.


Them five percenters will learn you something. Quick, quick, quick. Nah, this the science. Lemme tell you the threads. God. What Gang are you gonna get down with if you go to jail? Me again. Whoa. Your jails Chill out. Nope, I back. I'm good. Are you gonna be solo? Do oh you gonna be a Muslim now? No more dope gain Because We was one. Yeah, That's exactly, I don't think we helped JD Daniels at all. Well JD Daniels now you know how he they learned He, it it's, he learned Observ observation that he wrote that in there. He Learned and them niggas be mean bro. Call him shit. 12th grade Trump supporter. Take that shit down. I, I play. Yeah, I don't think I'm stealing issues sleeper this week 'cause I'm playing a Joe button and Imani record.


Okay. And. it has never been that supportive of a friend. Even though when we used to be on our way to strip club and I would be playing like a record that I was working on or something. He'll gimme a, nah nah, I see you killed that shit. He would gimme that That would be the, that's what's That would be the extent of it. That's my man. That's what's up. And then he would say Yo, I'm telling you Yo, if Eminem fit that same shit. No Yo, that was Yo. Any, any song I ever played for his show. I waited to stripper Yo. If you was white nigga you would be Eminem. I'm lying, I'm broke as hell going to the strip club nigga. Talk about the man with no feet. What's that song? Yo? It was broken in my sleep.
