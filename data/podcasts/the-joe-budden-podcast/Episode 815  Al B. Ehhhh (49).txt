You asked me, does this count Muslim? Yes. It fucking Count. Yes. This count. Oh man.


It was actually I, they, I'd been supposed to go a couple years. I didn't go for a variety of reasons. The location is secret. They don't tell you where It is until like, maybe like less than 24 hours before it actually turned out to be dope. I thought it was gonna be like super like conservative and staunch and like boring. But it was actually really, really dope. And a lot of cool people were there. Including some people I didn't know were Muslim, who I don't think want to be known as Muslim. I was gonna say. So since it was a secret location, you probably can't say who was there. I mean some people were there. I could say like hot Sun Minhaj was there. You trying to get on again?

I had no idea that See, see, that's, that's what I'm saying. When I shake shit up, it'd be legendary. Yo. That's what I'm saying. Sent me a video from this guy named Joe. But Talking about now this guy hometown, Gary, Indiana and his mayor like a dog.


You don't know what you're talking about. You have no idea what is going on in Gary at this moment. The, the things that we are doing to raise our city when we have people like you talking about it, instead of supporting us and trying to see our city bloom and grow. If you don't have anything positive to say about Gary, Indiana, my hometown and my mayor, Eddie Milton, I am encouraging you to shut up. Take that, take bars. I need, I need that with the ether. You right. You don't wanna be part of a Solution, nigga. Shut up. Shut Up. Mm.


That one, that one, that one. That one over there over there. Well, first of all, respectfully, we gonna respect the legends. Always. No doubt we gonna respect the legends. Always. And I don't think that was as bad as Can extent Viga Race. That wasn't bad. Denise Williams is just uninformed. She's a newer, we are. Well maybe I was. But today we are actively working with the mayor of Gary Indiana to bring awareness to what is currently going on out there and help all of the fucking people that are raising money and fucking trying to get shit lit out there. So we, We on the same page. Nice. We both could have been uninformed. So let's give it up for some maturity.


Go Denise Williams. Shout out to her. Hey Yo dog. If I find out you gave 55 cent to Gary, Indiana instead of giving 55 cent to Jersey City of Newark, Oh Then that means that I support causes that are different from the ones that you support. They all the same causes. I don't give a fuck about these prom kids outfits. I don't give shit. Just, I'm not even talking about Dumb nigga went in fucking Salvation Army fucking drug. I wouldn't give, I wouldn't lose an ounce of sleep. However, if there's some more pertinent issues that need addressing, need my attention and my donation and of course I'm always there for Newark and Jersey City.


I don't ever play with me like that. Ever play with me like that. Okay. All shout to Denise Williams. Shout to you Joe, for maturity. You wanna move on? What, what's, What's, what's the Gary, what's the Gary issues that you're supporting? There we go. Cool. What are the Gary issues Yourself sometimes. Well, it's not about, it's not about the issues I'm supporting in and what I've learned from the mayor. Oh, it kind of echoes what she's saying. Whatever was going on back then. There are different people in charge now and they are trying to do things differently. And it's a black dude. All you need to tell me is a black dude. There's a black dude's in charge and trying to do something now. It's a black Dude in charge of Newark, ROS Baraka.


Mm. We are well aware of that. What do they have to do with them kids? Tuxedos? I'm just, but y But y talking about Newark, I'm down to do that in Newark as well. This is not a Gary verse. It is not. I know y'all be looking for the gotcha moment. I'm down, I'm down for Newark. We look for that. I'm down, I'm down to support Newark as well. Why don't y'all do some real supporting instead of these dirty ass tuxedos that y'all are Talking about. You can't say that to me. Huh? Why not? Because I've given conventions on helping black kids in Newark. Ooh. For free. Oh Brown. You can't Do that to me fan. Alright. You Can't do that to Me fan. Alright. You got it out my own pocket, Nigga. We, we never saw I, we Never seen fellas fell. We just freestyle you. I never seen that fellas. We talked about it on the show. I never saw It.


We talked about it on I know, but you ain't come support your man. Oh. You know, and I'm never supporting You. We know. Just so we just so we're clear. Lemme take some of this st thing out the room. Yeah, we know I'm never supporting you. Give a Fuck that shit. That that shit stunk a little bit. Yeah, he lemme take it up. Fuck about you niggas boy. Anywhere y'all wanna go, anywhere y'all want go. Let's have some fun in here. Well, we've been having fun. It is kind of fun. Yeah. We been, we been bucking freeze. What's up music? What's what you saying? Freeze music. Y'all wanna start with Dreamville?


No. Oh, okay. Well I'm start with Dream but nobody went. Yeah. And it, it's not really over. Right? You saw that? Yeah. It's not over. It's not over. They're They're, they're Just branding. They're rebranding. Rechanging the name. What's interesting about that? Oh, They pulled a fucking Horrible decisions. They got another four year deal is cold bill now. My God. They got another four year deal with Raleigh. What was interesting though is in the statement he said that we're gonna try to keep it basically saying we're gonna try to keep it hip hop. Yeah. Try to keep it. Well What does that mean? Does that mean that sometime something in the contract Indicates? Well I heard in that is we getting ready to turn it up and it's gonna be a little bit more, it's gonna be different.


It's gonna be inclusive. Yeah. More inclusive. Yeah. I was about to ask you why, why the rebrand? Does anybody know? No, I think it's also to take Cole from having a headline every year. That makes sense. But if you called the Dreamville Festival, he don't gotta headline that shit. But he's Dreamville so it's like he has to be physically there at some Oh that that's sure. Now this takes, he says he'll still be hands on but this takes him off of the stage. Yeah. I don't have to really need it. Nice. I was just tight. There wasn't no stream this year because I really wanted to see Wayne set. That's A crowd of shit. What? Whatever you just said. What you mean what? That nigga could stay home now that and if I asked for his ass to come out, alright.


I shake Not speak. I'm just saying it could stay home now as it been the Dream Bill Fest or whatever It is right now. But a Lot of Like, you don't have to be there. Yeah. But it's match Depend match Sales. Yes. Just like when Travis do the Astro world fest. It is, It is. You, you are expecting To see Drake doing OVO Fest. Wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're Expecting to See that? Who's The replacement headliner? Don't make me argue against Cole right now. But I don't know that they lose sales if he just goes and books the headline. Yes you would. Yes you would. And so if he went and got you Can't say that for a fact. Yeah, I Agree with that. You cannot say that Travis headline.


Yeah. I don't know. I You can't say that you, you're Right for fact. I cannot say that. That being said, of the dozen or so people I know that went to Dreamville this year. And if you want to add on every year dozens of people I know that have gone to Dreamville, they go cold, they went to Dreamville for Jake Cole. They go for cold. They ain't Go to see to see, they see everybody else there, but they go for cold. And if they Put whoever I'm shutting up 'cause it's not important how many people I'm not shutting up 'cause that's not what I do. How many people are at Dreamville currently? I don 40,000 maybe. Yeah. I don't know. It's a lot. 50 thousand's a lot. It look, It's definitely a lot. I'm not, I'm not on the side. If it's not a lot, I'm not on that side. I Think it would still be successful without him. I don't think it would be as successful without him being the headliner.


Currently The part I agree with what you said ice is whatever they doing in the next four years, I'm sure they will try to eclipse whatever they have been doing. Absolutely. This is the upscale, this is the upscale it. Yeah. Have we wanna make it bigger than just Dreamville, but but still do it for North Carolina, for Raleigh, et cetera. And, and he owns it, right? I I don't, I don't know the logistics. I think so. But, but outside of that nigga, we got rolling out j Cole not on rolling out. So if you replaced the people that that, that's them niggas. You replaced j Cole with them. You could do rolling loud numbers. To your point, if you replaced a headliner with another monster headliner Yeah. The people gonna come.


Maybe. You get what I'm saying? Yeah. But there's also like fatigue from, you see the same artists at all these different festivals. Like there's, there's mad festivals and there's only but so many superstars. Back to our conversation that we've had the last two weeks. There is a a, a uniqueness about Dreamville that is j Cole being the headliner. It seems a little authentic. It feels more grassroots. It does. It does. And his whole label and squad like that's a thing. I agree with that. If you just throw in, I don't want to say anybody his name. It's gonna sound disrespectful. You throw anybody name in there, it's not gonna ring quite the same. I think they might look at us, they just maybe hit a ceiling. Like this is as big as its Paul can get Cole's on his way out as Far as we could go with you. Earthy ho.


And now we, we got, we gotta Upscale Sonics band. Yeah. Me. Yeah. That might be. And we'll Try to keep it hip hop That. Well I saw that And I said, Aw. Oh man, my room five. Come next week. Be prepared. Put them fucking incense away. Y'all shower now? Yeah. Who Performed? Come on. Somebody give us something that actually happened from this, from this thing. I again, because there was no stream, I couldn't really see much. I saw Wale, I Saw Absol, I saw Wayne saw, I saw Ludacris in the clip. Like oh shit. Saw Lu. It is ludicrous. Yeah. I saw Luda, I saw Wayne Saw Eric Idu. I saw a juvenile. Yeah. Yeah. But I, I didn't see a stream.


Why they Decide not to stream it This year. They didn't say but they did put it out early that there will not be a streaming shit. I'm sure it's Business. Are we too old to catch flights and go to fucking the the hippie shit? Yes. No. No we not. No, no we not. I was struggling to Sit it certain festival just didn't really work. Not for the festival shit. If It is a, if somebody's doing a one, one-off show somewhere and it's like, okay in they hometown, you gotta be there for it. I'll catch the flight for that. I'm not going Went to the Kendrick shit. That's A one off show You would go to. That's A one off show. I wanted To go to D Dreamville. I just had something booked this weekend so I was not gonna, if Jeezy does a show in Atlanta for the 20 year anniversary of 1 0 1, I'm going, I feel like this broadcast is too big Doug to not have a presence over there.


But I ain't going. I wanted to go. Tanner went. Yeah, tan Tanner went. Oh yeah. Oh, we gotta call Tanner then find out why Mandy went, went, I forget it then. Call, Call Bandy man. You picked up, you call and tell me how I was Check nigga. I don't call and check on people. That's not my bag. That's y'all bag. Just humanism. Just humanism is Our bad. I'm joking around 'cause We on air. I'll get to my human spirit when we get to selfish versus selfishness. Selflessness. Mm. That's when I'll get serious about where my human spirit lie, but okay.


Go Dreamville. Yeah. That Because said didn didn't see any major headlines and announcements. Any he super big special guests. It seemed like it was just a, a, a good weekend from everybody I saw posted. Got it, got it. Alright, well shout to everybody that went out there. What I do love about Dreamville in the weekend is that there's never any hints of violence or word Gunfire. Facts. Facts. Yeah. Or Overcrowding or just bullshit. You never hear any of that bullshit. Which is dope. You don't hear none of that. Yeah, because the hippie niggas, they just wanna smoke some weed and get humped on. No, because North Carolina is a great place to be right now for black people. Honestly, Why you say that?


Just how black people are doing in North Carolina. Charlotte specifically Charlotte. It ain't cheap neither. Yeah, It is. It is that It is moving. I've Heard c it's one of the fastest hard with Atlanta and DC but I think it's in that It is similar conversation. The growth And It is growing. Yeah. Tremendously. Hey, Charlotte. To Charlotte. That's dope. Shout to Charlotte. Yeah. So that's just a lit time to have hell yeah. Out there right now. So shout, shout to them. What else? What else. Anything else? Send y'all, y'all. Y'all see this billboard list? Oh, I saw it. It wasn't the worst of lists. I didn't see, I didn't agree with it, but it wasn't the worst. You know, sometimes they'd be so egregious. I'd be like, y'all shouldn't even be allowed to talk about this. What was the list? The top 25 women rappers of all time.


But we always let 'em do it to us. Fuck. Fuck That part. Our job. Fuck It. Yeah Man. And this is early in the show for it, but I saw the list and then I was like, fucking, here we go. And then I said, if you know what, fuck it. We'll talk about it. Why not? What did you think of ice? I saw some old, old names that were there that shouldn't be there. And some names that were not there. That should have been there For, for me it was also the, it was more the order of, I'm trying to pull up, list up now. It was the, it was the order of I got it. You got it. Read. It was the order of the people for me more than who was on it. Although there were two names I thought should have been on there. 25 is Tiara Wack.


24 is Doci. Okay, 23 is Gangsta Boo. 22 is Lady of Rage. 21 is Gorilla. 20 is Mony Love. 19 is lotto. 18 is Remi Ma. That's some bullshit. Heck. Keep going. 17. Is Rhapsody some more Bullshit's bullshit. Yeah. 16 is Doja. 15 is Meg. 14 is left eye. 13 is Trina. 12 is the brat. 11 is Cardi Tennis. Foxy Brown. Whoa. Wey a little low too, but carry on Tennis. Foxy nine is Eve. Eight is Roxanne CHANTE. Seven is Salt and Pepper.


Six. Mc L five. Queen Latifah four. Lil Kim. Three Lauren what? Three Little Lauren Hill, two Missy Elliot and one Nicki Minaj. And before we react, let me give you their criteria. 'cause it's always because that's Important. Yeah. Alright, so the criteria is Body of Work slash achievements. And they put that as charted singles and albums. Gold, platinum certifications, cultural impact slash influence, longevity lyrics and flow. That's the criteria to come up with this list. I'm not mad at Nikki being number one and Nikki being number. Nikki is number. I'm not mad at that. I'm Not mad at that.


I'm not mad at those two. I'm not mad at that. Lauren. You know, I love Lauren, but I'm not mad at that. Okay. Because look, look who she sits behind. Okay. So I just think she's more, got more singing songs than she's got rap songs. Way more. I wouldn't put her necessarily way more that high. I would put her on the list. Of course She'd behind the singer's list. But with that same criteria, Her album that she rapped on went Diamond, Two of them, She has three album. She wrapped on Two Diamond albums. Right. Hard to argue against. It is all I'm saying cultural impact. And I feel like we've done that here. I would have her on there. I would just have her a little bit lower. That's what lower I'm Saying, I'm not saying at the end of the list That five read the two right after.


I'm not gonna hold you. It is not a about Five Kim Queen Latah. That's what I said. Mc, light, salt and Pepper. Roxanne CHANTE E Foxy Brown is 10. I would've have her Foxy Brown goes way higher. But that top four, if we, if I'm, I would just put Foxy in the top five. Really? Foxy 100% I agree is a top five. You can't, you can't. 'cause who you gonna take out? You gotta take out Missy. To me. Missy's too high, but Hell no. Missy is, you get what I'm Saying? To put Foxy in the top five. 'cause again, we come from the Foxy era. Who do you take out that top five? I'm taking Lauren out. Who? Who's Five? Yeah. I'm pushing Lauren Back. Nick Nikki is one. I didn't ask you that. I said who's five? No, I'm about to tell you Nick is I know who's number five. Sorry. Queen Latifah.


Who is number two. And see, I can't take, Can't take Queen Lafa out of that. Well I Can't 'cause I'm from New Jersey. No, not just that. The cultural impact that Queen Latifah, it wouldn't be a bunch of these people if it's no queen. Right. And charting singles. And I mean the, to me it's just that the same criteria that pushing. I'm Long Jersey so I'm not gonna do it with you. That's fair. I'm from Philly. I'm happy I can I Can hear what you're Saying though. Yeah. Yeah. I, I just feel like whatever criteria pushes Lauren down would also push Left Eye down would also push Missy down. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not against any of those people. I think they're extraordinary. But I'm just saying, if we're saying Missy's the number two woman rapper of all time, a lot of her influence was not from the bars. It was from the song she made. Missy's an extra is like a all around amazing artist. Miss Missy deserves all that shit that y'all give Lauren Y Yes.


Yes. I I think that's right. I think that's right. I don, I just don't dunno if I'd have her as number two on my rapper list. Missy ain't done enough rapping at all. All that y Yeah. With respect to her pen and her albums and her artistry, creativity, that's where she gets to that creativity. Artistry. The rapping part. But she raps. Raps. She Does rap but not enough to be the number two rapper. Long time. Not exactly. Is is she, is she writing with a pen? That's a good point. That's a good point. If she's writing with a pen, you want her before the other rest of them. Yeah. Just maybe not as a rapper. Right. I don't have no problem with this top five Shit. My argument comes later in the list. I'm looking for Bohamadia. Like I say Rod is the MIA XI said it before, laugh at me about it.


I'm looking for the defeat. Philadelphia female MCs. I don't play about Thank you Gene Gray rapper in half. That To me, gene Gray should be on this list and no name should be On this list. But When you start looking At the rest of the criteria I understand, I understand why, but that's why I don't like the criteria. 'cause Gene Gray to me, we just talking about pure talent. Now this might be another wild take, but no, She could rap with, I don't know, on list that could rap better than Gene Gray. Quite frankly Rhapsody that I wouldn't, I wouldn't fight that. But I, but I'm saying they in the same conversation. Gene Gray, different Gene Gray, there's nobody that write better Gene Gray. But with the criteria I get outside of bars, you don't have nothing else that's gonna meet the Criteria. And And that's why I don't love the criteria a little bit.


You know what I mean? Because now I got now somebody who's an extraordinary rapper, like Jean Gray is not on the list. Monster. She's a monster. Like who would you take off the list? I would take off, I hate taking people off 'cause then it seems like a dis not really. I don't know the girl I'm taking do off the list. I'll say it. It's too early. I'm not taking too Early. I'm not as hundred percent as to be off the list. Ti Wack. I'm not mad at that either. It's too young was too early for these people. It's too early. Yeah, too early. It's too early. But you can't take Doci off and leave Lady of Rage on. I was about to say yeah. Wait, why not Name Alright. No, no, no. Hold up, hold on, hold on, hold up. Somebody name Three Lady of Rage songs. Not fair Name Two Lady of Rage songs. That's Actually fair.


That's not fair. Fair. We need to be aware of Lady of Rage's contribution, which was more than just I know verse, but I know one song which was more than just tell me what it was Lady A Rage. She solo songs Was she was the female representation of the whole West coast at one point. That's A contribution to hip hop that some of these people have not paid. Yeah. That's why I think she should be like number 26. I think she Lady of Rage make the list just off the Steve Harvey show Uff Rock on with your bad about say Everybody knows Afro Puffs shit. So you can't name another song. Shit. Yo Yoyo not on here. Is she from Farmville? Huh? She from Yoyo is another one. Yoyo Not on here. Yoyo not. This is what I'm saying.


How the fuck if you, you talking about West Coast representation of women. It's not Yeah. Lady Of Rage. It's Yoyo Name. Me two Yoyo Lady Rage got up there because of Death Row. Let's let tell The Truth two name me two Yoyo songs. You can't play with my Yoyo And Don't try to play me out. Fuck. Exactly. Now she on the can't she on the I wanna be Down Remix. Yep. That's a Classic verse. I'll be your hotel. Yeah, That's a classic verse. That's two. Rage is on Twice as Rod Dig. Rod Digga should Absolutely be on the list. Rod Digga should definitely be On list. Rod Digga definitely needs to be on Remy because She actually has some platinum singles. Whether future or whatever you want to say.


Where do you guys think that Remy should be placed on this list? Because higher, higher. Higher than. Yeah. Higher than 18. Like top 10. No, but higher. Maybe 11. I was gonna say maybe around 13. Somewhere in there. Is Rex definitely higher than that list though? Is Rex and CHANTE too high? Yes. Yes. Respect? I hate to say that, but yes. Respectfully. You think she shouldn't be? You think Foxy Brown should be lower than her Major? What I'm Telling you bro, not Spending up five seconds on Roxanne CHANTE. There's 2025 almost 2026. I'm just telling y'all. Fair enough. If that's the case, that's why she should be the list Though. But listen, if that's the case, then you can't say salt and pepper should be seven. I don't think salt and pepper should be seven. I do not think the salt and pepper should be above. It's fucked up to say, but you're asking me and I wouldn't go to Billboard for mine.


I would have the argument with people that know the shit. But I'm putting Foxy bear. I'm a force on pepper. Your fuck. I know you can Love it. Ask y'all. I know that It Is Not appropriate to say can't. Yeah. Show Me. It's not a crazy take. But I I don't agree with it. That's not crazy. No. Nope bro. Without some of these people there is no Foxy Brown. There's Kpac Right there that well, I'm not, and never taken away from their impact. I don't think that Foxy Brown is is off the salt and pepper, salt and pepper lineage. I don't. She definitely is. How, what are you talking about? Just what's the difference? She's a girl rapper. What, what other way is she off the salt? Embracing and Sexuality.


Sexuality. Yeah. Shoot nigga. Shoot. You got what? A man before that, before even before that Push Foxy You talking about? I agree. I'm joking. But no, I don't think they're the same lineage. I think, I think there's a very clear Foxy brand. Like we know who the children of Foxy and Kim are. Right? Like It is very clear. We know who the, the children of Latifah are. I don't, I don't see Foxy and, and salt and Pepper being the same lineage. But there is a way that they just open door for everybody. It is just pioneers. And I'll admit that I'm, I'm probably way more of a Foxy brand, Foxy fan than Most, most, I love Foxy Brown too, bro. But I think she should be hot. She Commercial smashes in the early fucking eighties dog where females in hip hop wasn't a thing.


Yeah. I mean nigga she got and They longevity list. Yeah. Like What we talking about Ain't no, ain't no hit better than shoot shoot with man. They still play that shit on TV now. Push It. What Tramp they got? They, Yeah, no, they got a lot of records. Got the song Pepper. Let's go. Let's go man. Say Tramp. Yeah man, they love that song. But Phil, but Philly's well represented on this list. Man, left Eye. I agree with you Tara. Wack Foxy. I'm happy with that. Foxy need to be at least five. I know it's prize big time, but I just wanna have a good time for let's, I'm coming Paul.

That's why I also, and I already stole one. That bothers me. I was About to ask you do that, do that affect anything for y'all on these lists? Well, 'cause that would change a lot of these rankings by how long, If you say Pin game changes the list, then there's no list.


Yeah, I wouldn't say No list. Pardon me. Lemme take that back. The list is drastically changed. Yeah. Because Half that list got written for it and a lot of men get written for it too. But half that list got written. Herbie wrote half a whole bunch of stuff there, but wrote stuff on there. Fucking JD wrote stuff on there. I mean you could Yeah. Anyway, though, that's the shit right there. Oh, oh, hold on now. Yo, hold on now broke the Go ahead. I'm not sick. No more tear. Listen all that. Hey yo, that's this one. Broken Silence is great.

And then that's great. And then Ish was great. I'm trying to lead and segment properly. Yeah, Lead properly. You want, you want, you wanna tell 'em where we went? We, we've been having an ongoing debate about who could lift 2 25 in here and there has been a conversation about it and some people are like, I could do it easily. Some people said they couldn't, et cetera, et cetera. And so it kind of got tabled for a while, like a lot of our debates. And then me and Corey started talking about it again and Ian Schwartzman decided that he wanted to weigh in. I'm not sure why, but he said that he could do it.


And I looked at Ian and said, yeah, I'm doubtful. But you know, Felt his tricep. The tricep You felt him up? Yeah. Oh. Because like if, if you have no tricep then there's no chance you could do it. You know what I mean? It's, It is a RO and tricep thing. So I'm like, if you have no tricep, he, he had a little tricep. I was like, okay, maybe he does pushups at home or whatever. That weird shit he does in the SA is getting his arms strong. Yeah. I said cool, let's go do it. And sure enough, Ian went down, down, took off his shirt, did his, He-Man things, Hulk Hogan thing. He put up the, in the blank bar, he put up 1 35, we put the second plate on. He got it to his chest. He was able to lift it off the bar. And then what, what would you, how would you describe, how would you describe the next 10 seconds Joe? Get, Get the shit off.


A lot of shaking and trembling. Lot of shaking and trembling. A lot of red, pink face. Yeah. Lot Of, yeah. A lot of Red pink. Yeah, red and pink face. Lot Of getting up saying damn, I think I pulled something. He, he seems to have left too, so yeah. Nah, he, he really said We cleared him the fuck Outta well that's the other thing. I told him not to go down here and get involved with that hoo nanny because Ian done broke his clavicle or something. The shoulder. Oh yeah, he had a couple shoulder shift. He said he had three shoulder repair surgeries. Yeah. So that was an instance where the risk is just not worth the reward. Not at all. Right. There was no point in doing it. You don't, men don't Fuck that. It is not over every And He pulled so, and he pulled something. He's fucked up. Now you got a baby on the way you married. It's like what are you doing buddy? Yeah. Men don't care about none of that. You gotta know your work.


Well It'd be a different thing if he like lifted weights regularly. Not to say that I don't, I think he runs and stuff like that. He Said he lifted in college. He said he Ain't lift weights consistently. If you Haven't done bench press in a long time, jumping into 2 25 is Crazy. So after that Dr. Mark gets on, gets on the bench. Yeah. Throws it up. He threw it up and then after that then it was a line now. Yeah. And after that freeze went, I went, I did what I said I was gonna do. You Put it up but then come down, put up. Oh I'm sorry. Before Mark Corey went, I'm sorry Corey count Corey went And then mark Prison. Shit if you hold it with one arm you can adjust the rack with this.


Corey Started curling and shit like, yo man, put the part down man. Fuck doing. So it was Cory, then Mark then freeze and then I had to go 'cause freeze threw it up to me with what looked like the ease. Like freeze just looked like he had that. I've been in the house strength nigga just mowing the lawn Free. Put the 180 5. He didn't get to the two? No, no, No. I did the, I just picked He picked it up. Oh he got, I told you He got it off the, I always gonna, I can put it up. Right. But when it got to, it got to your chest. Nah, No, no, no. It did get to, Oh yeah, no, no I respect that. Yeah. You was like I'm not, I'm not putting, I told everybody off the rip. I just said I can put It up. Yeah. I thought him throwing up the 180 5 was pretty impressive. The 180 5 was impressive. That was impressive. Especially you Don't work out.


I did that a couple times. Yeah, okay. Freeze. Got that head strength like you just pulling from his dome. That's where It is. All it's all up top baby That nigga. It's all the top. So you binge pressed the 180 5? Yes. Yeah, but the 2 25, 2 25 I just, all right, that's enough. Put that back. He got that mama. See if I can get it. Take the chicken out the freezer shrimp boy.

No, no, but It don't matter. No, no, no, no. Let downplay it. Lemme pretty good. It don't Matter. It wasn't just that you, you did what you, what you, you didn't try more? You probably, I think you could've done more. 'cause you, I think you had like a kind of reckless strength. I I don there's another one word for it. The like the hawk. There's a way Tasmanian devil. Yeah, sure.

How many times he did? 180 5. 1 35. Hold Up for a second. You didn't go down. How would you Oh no, I I figured you started with 1 35 and then went up.

Like he'd still be there if we weren't, if he did it by himself.


That's the worst. Getting caught under a bench. Yeah. Nolo. Yeah. We ready? Yeah. That is Not fun Shit. Good times though. Yeah, That was fun. Great Times. I'm trying to find this smoke that I have for Mark Lamont. Here It is. I think it's Right on at Mark Lamont Hill. Now I got it right here. I got it right here. Oh this is something that Mark Lamont retweeted from a friend of the show. Jay will we fuck with Jay Will up here. That's my guy. That's my guy. Absolutely love Jay Will, Jay will said if LeBron and Steph dropped 61, 10 and 10 in the game this time of year, we shut down the internet. Yada yada yada yada yada. Lemme get to the end.


ESPN would talk about it for two days straight. But when Joker does it, It is just another night. Why? Because he doesn't look the part, he's not flashy, not loud, but make no mistake skill for skill. He's already outpacing Shaq, Hakeem and even Kareem. Whoa, whoa, whoa. He is, we're just afraid to say it. Joker isn't just the best player in the world. He's quietly building one of the greatest legacies we've ever seen. And media is still acting like it's a fluke. And Mark Lamont took that and said facts. I Would agree with that. And I couldn't believe that that you said that. I agree with some of the Parts of there. So, so I will say in fairness I didn't read all, I wasn't read all that I don I was really facting the first half of it. The, if he dropped this, these big numbers, LeBron bragging and talking about it.


That I would say to the second part though, because I was ready to argue about the second part with you out. I Don't think he's about the second part. I don I just don't think it matters. Like statistically he is outpacing Shaq in, in in, in e lajuan. I just think it's a different era and so it doesn't mean the same thing. Yeah. You know it means absolutely. I give a perfect example is rebounding rebounds are a lot easier to get in today's NBA because a lot of teams bigs abandon the basket and go up the court. That's why you see a lot of point guards now averaging eight, nine rebounds a game. So yoic rebounds are not the same as Shaq's rebounds. If I had to pick a a, a guy to win me a game right now, I'd still go with Shaq. Of course, of course not Yoic. Of course you would. Right. But I do think that Yoic is so great and so extraordinary that now we act like the shit is normal.


'cause it's just like when James Harden and, and Russ Westbrook, we getting triple doubles every night. We started acting like a triple double wasn't a big deal. And it's like if if they're that easy to get, other people would get them. Exactly. That's the league changed. It's easier than in in the fifties but it ain't or the eighties. But Shaq, Shaq averaged 23.7 points a game in his long career and 10.9 rebounds per game. If I'm reading this correctly. Joker at 20.9 in 10.7. So where exactly is he on pace to out? I I I don I don't think that's right but but if you look at their prime, if you look at their premieres, I think if you looked at their premieres it'd be even worse for Joker. No, I think, yeah I think we, I think I think Mark and Jay will and a few other people and his You Throw says may fallen for just modern day recency bias with this joker shit because like you said, we in a different league and he's doing some shit and today the term two-way player exists.


I like joker too though. I'm talking about a day where that era, that term didn't exist because you had to play on both sides in dream, Dream average 21.8 and 11.1. Lemme look at The Joker to me is too obsolete on one side of the floor for me to start putting him in the same ballpark as Shaq and Hakeem. I like, I like Kareem. I think the him not looking the part of being an overlooked thing is absolutely bro. Bro, lemme ask you a question. No, you Don't fuck with Kareem. Why? Why you mean that? No, No, no. Kareem for me is Kareem is my goat. Lemme ask You a Question but lemme say this real quick before you, I think the thing about yo Kish that people are forgetting one, his efficiency is crazy. Oh you've never seen, you've never seen a a center put up those numbers that he puts up and shoot the three ball and give you and damn near lead the league and assist.


So you might have, even if Shaq averages four more points game him, there's 20 more points coming out of assist that that Yoic has given you. He he directs the floor, he's the point center. He's the pivot. He's he's the ball. He can't jump high enough for you to put paper under his feet. Yeah, he's slow as shit and he's running the brakes. He's, we've never seen a center. There's, there's nothing like Run fast brakes bro. Well we weren't allowed to See that but that's part of the era changing. We weren't allowed to See that Wasn't a thing. No. Nobody was talented enough to Do that. That's not true. That's not true. Not true. That's not true. Name them. That's not true. What you saying? I'm asking y'all Wilt Chamberlain, Wilt Chamberlain was talented enough to do that and he Did it. Wilt Chamberlain did not handle the ball enough to handle the ball in the He Led the leaking assist. Exactly Bro.


The assist is different. If you wanna talk about rebounds is different. The assist was different back then. Yeah I think they were harder to get. Yo, I think Shaq played point in high school. You are wrong. Shaq handled the ball and passed the ball in high school. I am not wrong. So find another. So he played The point. Alright so maybe you didn't play the point he handled the ball and passed the ball in high school. David Robinson flew like a fucking David Robinson. Robinson another day. David Robinson would be in that. So I, David Robinson wasn't a David Robinson grew like a foot in a year. So it's like saying ad is now a four. That's Our cat was, He wasn't a four when he was growing up But David Robinson was very athletic. Move around. Yeah. I'm just saying those people would not be allowed to. That Derrick, there's a lot of guy. It is a different era, different style. I don't like to compare eras because who knows what Kareem would be if he played in this era with this style of basketball.


Who knows what Giannis would be 30 years ago. You know we See that debate all the time. 250 Points bro. Stay in this era. Stay In this era. But but what I'm saying is Yoki what I'm saying is the particular skillset that he has in this era, Yo. So We haven't seen before. Sir that's fine. You still can't come in this room with your one ring having ass. You can't come over here. Your name ain't even to be mentioned with the Shaqs. How many he need before he can be in the conversation though. More than one grand because we Only got two and he's in the conversation. Right. Dave Robinson only got two and he's in the conversation. So I'm just saying if he has one more, is he in the conversation? Yes. Hey yo fam, if you are a center and you averaging a triple double that It is something to be said about. Absolutely. And think choker's incredible like yo. And I don't think we say that enough is all I'm Saying.


And and y'all LeBron crazy. He's incredible And he stat pass Y'all how Broh, I don't think he's stat. I watch just, I watch basketball too much to say he's stat patterning. 'cause he not he's not stat patting stop. Okay. He doesn't play defense. Yeah. I don know. Listen, that's the knock on him. To me. If he's not playing defense, don't see nobody kill him. Yo. If he not playing defense, the nigga that he's guarding don't get points. Yo let No that's not true. And B gets busy on him. That's Not true. Yo, Nobody can stop Joel and bead. Keep going. If there somebody says there Aren't that many good centers in, Listen, if somebody's a defensive liability, today's NBA will exploit your defensive deficiencies. I've seen Mad Game winners on the nuggets happen on Jokers. Watch. Mad Em. What I'm telling you is niggas not exploiting them.


But I don't want to listen. We'll get to this later. AD wasn't exploiting them. We'll Get to this later. We'll get to it. Got No ad, wasn't exploiting him and ad's offense is amazing. Okay, we'll get to this. We'll get to this. No, I fucking do That escalated quickly. Yeah. Yeah. Not at all. We having a sports conversation. That's what men do. I'm saying that niggas don't be willing to give A lady, there's a lady here and Flip is here. Like we don't want, it's okay now we fine. No, no. We he's got toys. He pulled out the toys. I got my toys, Got dinosaur crazy. Thank you To wear the sew. That's funny. That's crazy. Yeah. Y'all keep making fun. Y'all gotta stop that man.


What else is in music? That cars that needs our attention. Do y'all want to talk about the Drake leaks at all? Can we, can I hear it please? Drake leaks at all? I didn't listen to him, but please let's play. I don't trust leaks anymore. I don, I don, I run from Leaks just because I don't know what's real anymore. He back On the, he back on the wagon.

I listened to it once. I heard it all the way through. He was going. Yeah, I'd be scared of leaks. You Think the Leak was intentional though? Yes. That could be my question. Of course. I don't think so. If they struck It, I think that's his new trick. It is to leak it and strike it. Leak It Leak. Leak it. See what Happens. I think get some market research. Yeah, that's what I think. I think you throw it out there and you see if the current, the current climate is coming back around to receiving you. 'cause I think at one point it didn't matter what he put out facts, they was just shitting on them. Well I mean the leaks were cool. I wanted to talk to y'all about and one of them, he said Cade left his Crocs. Cade Cunningham left his Crocs and I fucked you in them.

Get the Questions out. Super Max. Super Super max. You know what a super max is? Yeah. You know a dollar amount on the super max. I think that's Like 3 million. I don't think that's fair when men do that to women.


Yeah it's, Thank You. It is not, I don't think it's fair. Women do that to I agree. Lemme tell get get in my mark back. I don't think it's fair. I'm now I'm doing it still. So you're doing it for I'm doing It content purpose. I don't think that's fair when niggas do that. Got it. That's not right 'cause it's like projection almost Like we want that It's like, it's almost to say like we would do it. So you would do it Very much so. Very much so. You guys really act like if you had vaginas you would just be lit letting the lips just flap all over the fucking place. Like you wouldn't have any respect for it. What's so fucking ever? Well wouldn't that be totally fine? Do I get to do it? Well first of all, I already said I'm doing it. I'm, I said that already.


Two, do I get to do it under the same guise and veil that most women do it where it gets to be like unspoken about like secret society where nobody could talk about my wholeness and how many mouths I put in my pussy. 'cause if nobody could ever say nothing about it, then You're definitely doing it. 1000%. Are you crazy? The same rules apply And if I catch one he is a little young anyway. I'm projecting again. What were we talking about? Fuck Super Max. No we weren't talking about that no more. No, we Talking does the Drake leak and he mentions the guy name Right ain And we can't talk about it but I just thought that was and Freeze. He can't find freeze get find it. You can Say I'm sitting in K Cunningham's locker in the, in the, at the palace or whatever the shit is in Detroit now out to the D and Cade left his Crocs in here.


So I took him and now I'm fucking this girl in the Crocs. He said it was in the locker room. He, yeah he said he was sitting in the locker. I guess he had a game in there or whatever. Who knows. And he said was sitting in C'S locker and he said Kade left his Crocs. So he said he took them. I Gotta hear it And he then he fucked home girl. And I'm not putting sauce on it says weird verbatim. I just fucked your bitch. Yeah that that ain't that flops. That's different. I just, I didn't, I fucked your chicken in another nigga Crocs. It's not the same as I fucked her in some flip. I thought you said she put the Crocs On. No him. See what I'm saying? It is A little different. Is she That's your man That's different. I don't understand why I would want to tell somebody I did this unless I'm fucking Cade's girl.


That's The only way it makes sense to me. How do you explain This? Because why do this other girl kid what Crocs you got on and why you got Crocs on? That's Funny. That's Funny. Were they in sport Mode or not? 'cause that's important. You Find it, you know what? Find It. It matters If, if he pop K girl and put it in a song, I think it's corny. I think that's horrible. But if he, how old is his girl? I don't know Cade's girl. I don, We just gossip. We dunno nothing about know k got a girl don't know if he pop Cade girl. Got it, Got it. Okay. Okay. No you said that like I know. Yeah but no, but we don't know shit. I'm just theorizing the why this line would make sense. This is, I Gotta hear it. 'cause to me it might, it might be funny.


None of the circumstances make it make sense to me. Yeah it might be funny. I can't think of no condition where you should say that out loud. But It is a good sign if you a Drake fan, It is a good sign. If you're a Drake fan, I'm not gonna lie to you.

Why? Why nigga don't my it's on, it's on our joint album. My name ain't nowhere on this. Yeah. And this is the record that's shooting up the charts. It is going crazy Nigga. You stealing my take Say that a couple damn ponds ago. You said that? Yes. Oh my fault. I'm sorry I don't be listening when you talk He ain't getting Spanky. He not getting spank You for it for that song. Yeah. Is He even in the video? It's his album. He gotta be in some spanky for it. My bad. I ain't know you said that but I was listening. I saw the shit yesterday. 'cause it's number three. Would you be mad? Your song, your song, your album, you not on it. It is shooting up the charts. If I was Like in real life, if you, If I was getting paid, Would you be mad if I'm Him? I think he should be mad.


Hell yeah. If I'm him artist. Just because of how it's always been the whole damn dog. I I do this, you steal it from me. It, it's always been that narrative around him and his music with dude. So if I'm him I'm very tight. I don't know. We got a joint project. Do I got Points and This is on that song? Yeah, that's the point that I'm talking about. It's, you know what I think that, I think that's, I don bro. I think it's a personal thing. Everybody, some when he got points on other shit that he wrote that he got already and he might not have been Mad. I was mad when m took me off the Slaughters intro for the second album. Fix that though. I was, I was mad though. Yeah, that was fucked Up. I believe you. It's little different. That's A little bit different though. Hold up, hold on Hold. That was a rapping Song. Now had that song made $10 million.


That was our Album. True It Intro. And it wasn't the single Album, but it's the first song album West play on when you put the slaughter house. That's what made it insulting. It was a very Joe button song, but, And Joe Button made Slaughter House. Look It. I Hates real shit. That's why I got so mad. Yeah. I got mad like I got taken off that record. I told them niggas, I said, yo, I'm not gonna hold y'all this. The day that that album drops, I'm putting out the verse with the, the version with Joe's verse on there. And I did that shit like album maybe like four hours later. Yep. Here it go. I don't care. Sick. Yeah, that'd be sick. What was the response?


No, what was the rationale behind taking you off? Song Was too long. I think right was Like too long. Maybe I was whack. I don't know. And you Quality bars, You can not look like a team player. No. You right. I get it. So don't matter. You can't go. Hey, why was it me? It don't matter nigga. It was you. I don't remember. Did they leave you little ad libs? Like, like inspector? Yeah, I think So. Inspect the duck at the end of the Tupac song. You trying to make me mad? I'm Nah, that was bullshit right There. That was bullshit. I'm with you. That Was bullshit. Damn. I was heated. If I'm party I will be mad. Yeah, you, you as an artist, you can be mad a little bit. I I But What if Drake comes in with a song, it's already done. But I wanna put the on this album and you'll still get points Because you notice like you don't Have nothing to do with this song. It is like a gift.


Maybe you all be mad but you'll still be, it's Like a fourth person coming in and taking somebody out the threesome. That's what It's like. Not if they my two. This is your threesome. You in here, you and two other people, y'all about to get busy. Here comes somebody, executive producing a threesome. They coming in, eh, this would be better without you, But look to You get the fuck out this rumor. But to Park's Point, let's say he already had this song done and I just wanted to put that on this project to get it out to the world. And you're getting your points Now. It's like, now it's a threesome where they both my means and I'm just letting you come in here and get, and it's still my work though. Yeah. And it's your first number one or top 10 or whatever And you not even on it.


That's the hard, that's all I'm saying. That's, that's they talking about this because you Know, if you're one, they're Talking about Nokia got potential to go number one in the next couple weeks? Nah, that's tough. That would, from, from an artistic standpoint, what I'm, that's tough. That's all I'm saying. That's tough. But actually, maybe if I'm party, I'm not mad. But some niggas don't, some niggas don't care about playing Robin bro. Everybody don't gotta be bad. But The difference between my slaughterhouse situation and his situation is like, like Par said, it was an intro. This is a, a hit single that potentially can be remixed shortly. So I ain't gonna go, I ain't gonna go piss the nigga off. That's true. That's true. I ain't gonna go piss the nigga off or fight with him over what could be a bigger bag potentially. I'm not even saying about fighting or nothing like that. I'm just saying sitting there at home by yourself, you probably feel a way.


Oh no, I would Feel away. Oh no. If I'm sitting home mad, that's all I'm talking. You feeling away by myself. When I wake up tomorrow or the next day, somebody's gonna feel it with me. No can See that. I'm not gonna be the only one feeling this way. That's Shortsighted. Like you said, baby, he knows, yo, we could do this. This could happen. That could happen. So let me not fuck nothing up. But behind closed doors, I'm a little tight. Well, I said somebody I might not tell to Drake. Okay. You Don't think that they had these conversations prior to the song even coming out? I'm with what? With what? The, It depends on How the song, what the additional plans are for it. Tell Us, tell us. I I don, why, why don't you let us know nigga Talk question. I don't think that he thought that. Don't think It is from the that at first.


Don't get me. Don't get. I think everyone thought That. Yeah because soon as we heard it True. That's not my first album. I don't think he thought it was gonna be a hit first. Same thing with the got me and my finna Kiki shit. Like he Show Me these songs. I don't think he thought that song was gonna go like that. I think you're wrong. Think okay. My thing is, if I'm home and I'm party and my points are coming in Yeah. And I got paid and I'm in some big ass house. Yeah. Eh, I can get over it. Nah, but sometimes like, I mean I'm not an artist but I, I notice sometimes when you, when you contribute to things, it's not you. Even if you still get paid for it, It's the look. I agree. You know what I mean? What I'm saying from an artistic standpoint, but also now this is a part of my resume.


So now the look that this has afforded me makes my price go up on everything else else. And now I could be a part of other shit and I can use this as the, You know what I mean? Said wherever he was at recently party, that he did perform Nokia like without Drake. And remember that party is a writer first. Yeah. So he might look at it. That's a good point. A little different. He might take the writer stance and be like, I wrote it. I wrote It. Although he said, I don't think he's credited a songwriter on this, but he may be some I, you know, you know I wrote this album. I'm on this album. Yeah, for Sure. It's your album. You did this.


I did Joints with Rihanna. Like I'm Chilling Bro. This song goes to number one for seven weeks. Then what dance, what dance you gonna do? Summertime Party album. Yeah. Yeah. But that's just a song And party's not credited on this at all. Even under the song like that. I remember the thing when they were talking about Drake's number ones. Right. And people saying why didn't sickle mode count in his Yeah. List of number ones because it's not, it doesn't even say featuring Drake. I don remember that. But the but what You're talking about one side of the record and there's two sides of a record that generate money. There's the, the master recording and there's the songwriting and publishing. Even if you're not getting any points on the songwriting publishing, 'cause you're not on the song, you may still be getting points 'cause it's on your album. You're a featured artist or you're not featured artist. It's, it's on your album.


So if the song goes number one, just the song, I'm not talking about the album already did. Its number one on release. See that Number one song is gonna continue to drive people to my album. Yeah. And I'm gonna get points off the sales of that record. Off That record. Yes. Alright. See I didn't know that that's, that was my question. It's his album. So I would say Because I look at even when I don If you contract, If you go on the anywhere and search it like It comes up again, there's two sides to a record. Just Drake, there's publishing and this master. I got you. So if you're getting points as a artist because it's on my album, he's still getting money off it. And I still want my question. That's more money than Me. About what dance you gonna do when it comes on in the summertime? The one leg with the one leg. You fresh off the bike? Nah, fresh off the bike. July. Nah, nah off the bike.


You gotta do the hill. Talk to what? Just because you off The to You got to. I don eh who do you think you talking to? I Think you should do wheelies. Fuck who's going on my phone And that shit bad because you love, you love to talk on the phone. That's his bad. That's funny sir. Just gonna be like tell me where's the funk show? Where the fuck Yeah. That's funny. Yo. Yeah he always thinks Somebody trying to be funny. But You seen me dance to a song before. Yes. You be doing that. Sure. I You be getting crazy. It is. There's nothing wrong with this. Look at you. You can dance but wait, You right. You see me dance To a song. You did say that.

I'm now you trying to out and now you trying to out people and you forcing the angel and off niggas. Oh wow. I'm not trying to out them. I think when they just had to have an underwear comparison on set, that was kind of them self outing. So you think only gay men do that? Yeah, yeah, yeah I do. And I'm comfortable saying that it's not true. If they had sex with each other, it should be ashamed they would be less gay than what they do on set. See that's why CNN in the end of his, he he went in there with strong opinions. Yeah, that's exactly And I think they should burn that. Oh yeah. Come, come. Lemme show you.


Lemme burn this. Lemme send this fiery email to fucking walk about the side door courtesy of Mr. Hill. Yeah. Fuck. Speaking of gay men, what were we though? Why do we got speak of Okay, go on.

Number eight was Mark Parentheses, depending on his haircut, could move up Parks depending on his hair day he could move up and then Ian could move up depending on what he wears for the day.

Am I wrong? No, they Didn't. They were sex workers. Yeah. I I guess there's still some level of kidnapping there, but yeah, They were still, there were sex workers that were being targeted to be kidnapped Parks Killed. Yeah. They were being murdered. Were murdered. Murdered. See, I didn't get that far. Yeah, yeah. I don't, yeah, I, yes. Yeah. I don't like that. Y no, I'm, I'm, But you Watch the fucking, you watch all The murder.

I like, when I talk, I say that to say I used to Love, it's not just watching something where someone is murdered. It's how did this person get, how did we get to the point where this person is being targeted, murdered?


Who is this person? What is his relation to the world, to family? What's his thinking? The motive. Not like prostitutes getting kidnapped. That's Towards the end of the series. When they started to explain who he was and Yeah. And what he went through. But in the beginning, I mean, yeah, it's crazy. I feel like this is like every series. It's because one, it's, I'm weirded out now. It's because of one girl who tried to escape, who was on the phone with the cops that exposed this man's whole thing. Operation. It's crazy. You gotta watch it. Okay. Okay. When I muster up the stomach, This nigga was a fucking a had an architect firm in the city. Midtown Nigga was wild, bro. He had an architect firm, right.


And then he did a, a blog before somebody interviewed him. He like, yo, he was hiding in plain sight. Six foot eight, hiding in plain sight. Huge ogre. Like it's really good. Oh, y'all can still cover it if you want. Y don't have to. Nah, we Don't to cover it. No, I want you to see it first. There we go. Cover it. Since we talking about watching stuff, did y'all, did y'all watch the, y'all watching hoop, the basketball stuff? We had the final four in the, in the NCAA championship for men and women. Y'all see? Of course. I'm so mad. I'm, I'm so mad. I I saw the final four. I saw the women's championship. Me too. I'm tight about the final four. Shit. Which part? Men, men's or Women's? Men's? You A Duke fan too Fan?


No, I'm diehard Duke fan was Duke clearly by leaps and bounds the best team in the final four. Yes. Absolutely. So what happened? Gambling? Yeah, gambling happened. Yeah. Now it was The bad calls. It is a mix. Yeah. Duke Didn't play their best game. They clearly didn't play their best game. So I'll say that. I don't wanna just put the onus on the refs, but that was a horrible over the back call. Yes. That was a gambling is happening. Too much money is on Duke call. That was a phantom call. Oh, that's interesting. Now they shouldn't have been in that position. That's What, that's what I was gonna say. They shouldn't have been in that position.


Yeah, but you, so you leave it in the hands of the refs. But that was a horrible, horrible, horrible call. But cool. They earned that. That's Houston. Houston. Houston. That's Houston. Houston earned that. They was tough. Cool. I'll take it. The Auburn game. And in the Duke game, nobody knows how to inbound the ball. That was this takeaway of the entire final four. Is that none, none of these four teams on the inbound, the ball? Nah, My, my take this Happens a lot differently if teams inbound different Auburn. I thought the refs had something against them and that made the the racism pop out of me. Yeah, they, the nicotine Not the racism, but I'm support. Come on my, my black brothers. No they all looking real white out there. Come on, let's go. Auburn has the stigma of Yeah, The niggas, the nicotine And Auburn Played the better game for most of the game.


Yeah, For Sure. And I said this earlier, what this Final four showed me is that none of these coaches could really coach 'cause down the stretch, the final two minutes of all these games. Yeah. The coaches just lost the, like it was no guidance. Horrible shots, horrible shot selection. The Auburn game, they wouldn't go down low. The bro, he kicking they ass the whole game. They wouldn't give him the ball down. Niggas are shooting 45 footers. It was just bad coaching on my, my perspective. Well I'm not gonna put Houston's Houston shot attempt in the last second of the championship. No, in on coaching. I'm sure you didn't draw it up like that. But They had a two minute stretch that Houston, they had a two minute stretch, three minute stretch where they was just missing doing like field goal working for the best shots they could have got.


They last field goal was like three minutes on the clock or so, shit. Yeah, I saw the sta. Yeah bro. Like that's just, it wasn't good coaching. You gotta last four positions. You gotta run a play. You gotta run a play to get us a good shot. Go to the foul line. You gotta run a play where we can get something going to the basket, we can get an offensive rebound. It's just you And that championship. I don't feel like Florida should have been in that game at all. I feel like when they was down 12, that easily was supposed to be 16. Go Go. Yes. Yeah, A couple plays That lead was about that. That building was about to get crazy. But gambling, if you're asking me, I looked up two seconds later these niggas up. I'm like, wait, watch this going on here. Yeah. I Thought it was a laugher the first half of the game. Yeah. I didn, I didn I didn't expect it to to, to even end the way it did. I stopped watching.


I was more interested in the women's this year. But yeah, once, once Duke was out, because I'm a big Duke fan for Men for a second. Hold on. This is Joe button from the Joe Button podcast and I'm live on air, so please don't say anything to incriminate you or I What's up brother Joe, how you doing? I'm really well we, we have the mayor of Gary on the phone. We have Eddie Melton on the phone. Make some noise. Eddie Melton hold up. He called us up. Yes sir. Hey man, I'm just hitting you up baby because I, I'll hit you a couple times man. We've been playing phone tag man. Listen, I'm trying to come On the show, but I want to invite you to Gary man to show you what it's really About. I'm under a lot of fire for my remarks.


They they on my ass. We got They should be. No, come on. No they shouldn't. Gary was a mess when I was out out there. It was a mess. So I'm I'm Saying respectfully though. I'm saying Respectfully. Oh well yeah, they should be. They should be. I'm not, I'm not mad at that. Denise Williams cursed me out. We covered that earlier in the pod. But listen, I, if, if there's some good shit going on, I'm with it. I'm with it. Like ja ru said I'm down when we off air I'll return this call but I look forward to it. Alright man. I appreciate you man. Look forward to the opportunity and let's set it up Soon. Definitely, definitely much love. Thank you bro. Alright, peace. Alright. Damn the love oh is easy to achieve.


No. Fuck y'all niggas. Sorry Mark. I thought that was big after the Denise Williams cursed me very. The on the air. Very big. Okay, Good job my man. Solid work. What we talking about man? Oh, we talking about the, the final, I mean again, shout out to the team that won. I just was rooting for Duke. The women's was the most disappointing national championship game I've seen in a long time. I mean obviously I was rooting for Dawn Staley, I'm rooting for for South Carolina. But I just wanted a better game. I just wanted to see a competitive game that wasn't a competitive game. I mean Yukon is a legendary team. You know, coach Gino's a legend, but like they were, I mean they weren't in the game after the first half or maybe even the first quarter. So to me that that's not the kind of national game I wanna see.


Especially after last year when Kaitlyn Clark, you know, was, was was squaring up against or the whole team Iowa City Square. She wasn't did it last year? She was She was in championship Last year. Yeah. They lost to to South Carolina before. That was last year. Last Year. Last year. 12 months ago. 365 days ago. She was in the finals. Yeah. Know what It is nigga? No. Y'all said two years. I ain't saying that, do you? I'm saying Nah, I think, I think it lost this lost luster once Juju got hurt, I think they were gonna market it up against, again, magic Johnson, Larry Bird. Right. Juju versus Page. And I think everybody's plans, all the marketing plans, all of that shit got scrambled once Juju got hurt. I agree. I agree with that. I think that's right. I I think I grew up and I think it would've gotten, 'cause they, they kind of criticized them saying that it didn't do what Caitlyn did last year.


Right. Because Kaitlyn was the star, Juju was the equivalent to Kaitlyn of this year. And I think they, they they fucked up. I Also hate that they put it at three o'clock on a Sunday. Not Me. I think when women's basketball gets prime time, they do. Well even when they win against football, even when they go and not, not finals football, but not, you know what I'm saying? Yes sir. Yeah. I when they go against football, when they go against NBA basketball, they do quite well in prime time. They put up big numbers three o'clock on a Sunday to me. Doesn't give them a chance, a fighting chance to, to succeed and put up the big numbers and they'll be like, ain nobody watching Will you put it at three o'clock on a Sunday? Whereas the men's is on, was it eight o'clock on a Monday? Monday? Yeah. I mean it's just a, It is apples and oranges, the comparisons. That's what I don't like, but that's just me.


But what pissed me off the most was just the Kim lajuan shit on, on the final four. They didn't allow Akeem e lajuan onto the floor after Houston won. Yeah. Fucking Joker fans. He's a, he's Akeem E lajuan. Yeah. And the nigga that's working the rope might be 22 years old and don't know the dream from the night that somebody else and Houston you talking about. Is that what stopped him? Like somebody at the rope didn't know who he was, didn't Know who he was. First of all, that old ass man at the desk was not no 22-year-old. He, he No, I'm just, I'm just joking. No, I'm with you. I'm saying if, if it was a young man, I'd be like, all right, this dude look like a deacon at the church. You know what I'm saying? And I'm making $16 a hour.


Big fella. I don't know nothing. You can't come in here. You don't, you ain't got one of these. You don't got one of them. That's some ice shit. Ice wouldn't let that nigga ice de Ice would've called the police. What Ice would've been like, yo bro, I ain't letting you win your dog. Yo. You, you got, sorry, dream. I hear you. Wake up. I getting this motherfucker. Yo. Is is there anybody, I guess the reason I'm asking first, do y'all have an expectation in certain places, cities, whatever, that they should let you in with or without a pass? Yes. Yes. If you are akeem the dream. Oh I thought you meant me. You are supposed to. No you personally. Yes, like like for example, if I'm in Philadelphia I expect, I don't expect to have to need a pass on a whole lot of shit Is man. Right. Alright.


No, no I would assume you feel the same way in Jersey City. The west side of Jersey City or wherever. Right. Oh. Oh shit. He need a pass out. Yeah he need a pass over there. For real. He said he gotta check in. He Gotta, he gonna pass on Playing with you. There's a lot of places. My face card is good though. Like on its own without Mandy a lot of places you just need me, not nobody's plus one. Not to be confused with Mandy getting me in a lot of places. Just my face guard is good. Wow. But y'all was saying That shot, it took me a second to figure who that was for. It just took me a second to, to calibrate. I still don't know who was Me neither. I have no idea.


It Is Mandy a are you Mandy plus one a lot. Never Do y'all go places a lot. Does Mandy think you are a plus one A Lot. That's I say when y'all go in do they do they dap both of y'all Yo Joe that yo, both of y'all stop Like that. He podding. He podding. You know what I mean? I bet you ain't seen that Dairy Queen in about 40 years though. It is cool. But anyway, But like I'm saying, y'all expect y'all face. I know I've seen you outside. I know there places you expect to go if you walk into any place in Queens. If you walk or you go any ba anything on a battle scene, I would imagine you walk up in there, you ain't asking for no pass. No But sometimes people require a pass. But I would I I'll feel away as well. Yeah. Depends on where I go.


And You go where you invited. Yeah, That's what I'm saying. Even if I'm not invited I still go too. If I'm not invited I still go nigga. But we not talking about when you I came outside Yo, stop playing. Watch me outside. Stop playing. Yo my nigga ain't Bro You you ice Man Bro. You see how how I am outside B. Alright cool. But we not don't Use me to throw a shot at my man nigga. No I'm gonna keep shooting. Don't use me to throw a shot at, throw My shot to you Is separate being the plus one. No I'm shooting at you. Yeah, let Mirror it. I did it. I'm not invited to places. No he No I'm trying to say you go where you invited, that's Where you go.


There's nothing wrong With that. You go to niggas idiot. No there's no reason Hakeem Aju shouldn't have been all the time carte blanche and that bitch like I built this house. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's college And NBA. Yeah like and in Houston and em lajuan should be like, I mean that's say Michael Jordan in Chicago Chicago you don't need no damn pass. I agree. So how did they, did they rectify it? Did they fix it? They send his ass home. That's Like when Kevin Hart dream shake your ass. It's like when Kevin Hart on on at the Super Bowl. Right. But at least with the Super Bowl it's different. Yeah, I'm asking though. The Super Bowl wasn't in Philly though. You get what I'm saying? Like I feel and everybody knows Kevin Hart Right. And and the Super Bowl celebrities of celebrities. I think they should have let Kev in but at least I understand the logic a little bit of saying you can't go on the stage with the team.


They wouldn't even let Keem lo on the court. Yeah, that's crazy in Houston. The court he Built like fam y'all might have this whole gymnasium. Quick question because Of me. I don't care. Y'all heard y'all just keep going so I'll just take the other side of it for fuck's sake. Why should he be letting the court? It's the house he built Because he built the house and he, I think some people are so famous they should be allowed to do whatever they want and yeah, I know that sounds crazy But what was he going to do? Congratulations. Congratulate the team that just won a national he wanna to stay on. They haven't won a championship since them Just five slam a jamma. So he went to go in there and just say what's up? I flos Fobs slam a jam. That's what it was called. That's what it was called. I know that's Just funny the way you said it. So Alright. So if you, if you went to, if he Built it, if this the house he built, he know where the locker room is.


I don't Joe stop It is stop. I'm asking You a question. Does he know where Locker he Yes he knows The locker room is. Yeah. Why Didn't anybody else know he was there? They all knew he was age seven first he's seven tall. He's seven foot Tall. And so I'm still confused as to how the rope stopped him and he gets sent home. I don't get what Somebody did say he didn't go home. Yo, that's Again, I don let him on the fucking court. I don't think he went home but when the dude stopped him but didn't Everybody Else, he was outside the court doing this shit. You ain't see what Vernon Maxwell said? Nah, You know Vernon Maxwell's crazy. So Verna Maxwell like a month ago was on one of the sport podcasts and talk about he disrespected Vernon Maxwell is a part of all the smoke now. Yes. Is he? Shout out. Shout out. I ain't know that. Shout out to man. That's good. That's amazing guys over there. So Vernon Maxwell talked about one time he disrespect Akeem and Akeem smack him.


Who was the way this asshole was that you? Who? Hell yeah. So that story Was fucking Hilarious. So Vernon just writes, Hey yo dream you gotta forget you Muslim Tums Hos show these niggas with the hand does to the face. What the hands said to the face, yo dog, he can't smack the rope dude. But he could, He was so respectful. He he basically looked like I can get past you if I want to. Again I'm saying I ain't gonna make a big deal outta it but I'm, I'm, I'm gonna respect your job. Which I appreciate respecting. I think you did the right thing. No he absolutely did the right thing. He did the right thing. Class act. Class act. Yeah. I respect people who are just doing their job. I just hate the fact that that happened. Certain people, shit Trumps if you were at a slaughterhouse reunion, you happened to not perform that night but you standing there, you should be able to walk, you should be able to come on stage.


You know what I'm saying? Like some shit like you should be able to do. I think Did they do their Trump? Oh yeah, that's true. Yes. Y'all ain't shit man. Yes, I agree with you. I also think that if you're a celebrity then it should be in your toolbox to know how to handle the situation when it's not that way. That's fair. And he did. He did. He did. And he did. He did it right. And he Did. He now you know, some other nigga are gonna Make a big deal deal. You yo you know who I am and all that extra shit. Yeah. That ain't how that's done. He didn't Do that. So, So, so my last question, I never understood Celebrities getting offended by that too. Like you want to kind of be in places where they don't all know you Introduce yourself to people. Ego, make your fucking network bigger and expand. It is ego Bro. It is. Don't make any sense. It's stupid. Is there anybody who's face card is universal in this country?


Like is there anybody who like, like Snoop? Hey yo. No you be po. No you are a potter. You the best Cleo. Y'all what's up My nigga? I've been with you. Will you tell a nigga y'all don't need no id my face is a ID at the doors of clubs that they wouldn't. Yo you got ID on you. No, I don't need no id my face is a id. How's that? Negate what I'm saying Because you ain't have the same respect for that guy that's doing his job. Oh wait, as a celebrity sometimes you Need to introduce yourself to people you know they're not gonna know who they are, who you are. I said one B one and she better How, how, how.

I appreciate that. Yeah, don't let none of these niggas stop you. Okay. They can't appreciate that the queen. Alright, alright, Alright. Alright. Listen. There you Go. Nigga up. Alright, Any whos Mel? Tell everybody about the topic that you wanted us to start with in block A. The first one before music. Before Drake. Before anything. Okay. We were commenting on the fact that it was kind of a slow news, you know, day, week or whatever the case was. But I was like, there was national protest in every state in the country. And that's when my ignorant ass said, I didn't see nothing but sun shining and coffee. I didn't see it was beautiful outside. I didn't see a protest. No, honestly, Mel was like, that was like, yo, nobody's talking about all the national protests that happened.


Protest. It Feels like the media's suppressing it. Protest even on the News. Didn't see about protest. It feels like the media is, is intentionally suppressing the fact that there was national. I did not know there was protests in every single state. All what are they protesting about? They're protesting Trump and Elon Musk. They're protesting tariffs. They're protesting the fact that people's savings in retirement and 4 0 1 ks are dwindling. That's what they're protesting. They're protesting just like a fucking hijack of the New York, of the fucking US government. You Know what I would like to know? And I know there's no way to really find out who all these people voted for. Yep. How many of you protesters voted for? I would love to Just be able to. So how can We confirm before stop? Because that's why Kamala's under fire now for She said, I told you so for doing whole.


I told you so and I do, I do think it's a horrible time to say I told you so. It is Not even I told you. So what I'm saying It's just, but that is how it comes out. But how is It horrible that she said that? Why is it horrible for to say Yeah, she said it. She told you ahead of time this is what's gonna happen if said It. I think It's horrible. It is horrible. It Is. I don't, It is. I hate when Hillary did it. I hate when Ka does it. Yeah. I don I don't Let somebody else say it. I mean I'm, I'm not saying they're wrong. Let somebody else say it. Yo Dog. Sometimes you gotta let somebody do the dirty work for you. Especially when it's fucking obvious. Honestly, I disagree with that. I disagree. I don't agree. The Democratic party has lost all their fucking balls, balls and sack for the past Cowardly 15 Years. So someone should be box. Someone needs to speak up and say some Shit. I agree. Okay. But the Democratic party also has been having trouble with a farm system and a candidate that the people can get behind, which means that I'm finding a pro, which means that they have a problem with messaging.


Yes. So even if you were correct, how you made that palatable to the public was very off. It was very off. So now you wanna sit and say, I told you so. Yeah, but you didn't deliver it in a way with that helped you at the polls one and two. Now when everybody is suffering, ain't the time to do that. I'm gonna say this, it ain't the Time to say when people are suffering. Y'all know I people just fucked up about You. Y'all know I said she ran a shitty campaign. I did. She ran a shitty campaign, but I watched some of those debates and she outlined what's about to take place. She said it, yo, you get in bed with a nigga that don't respect you and he gonna fucking eat you for lunch. She said that to him face to face.


We not ar I'm not arguing whether she's right all. So now I think to Parks' point, yo the Democrats always doing what's quote unquote politically correct. Yeah. The high rule, the things that we should and should not do. Now it's the time to go away from what the fuck we've been doing and start playing this dirty pool game that the Republicans have been playing. Here's, Here's why I don't like that. Here's why I don't like it. The only thing I don't like about it's if the Democrats had said the right shit and people made the wrong choice, I would be like, fine. Gimme I told you so. But Democrats spent, I mean you said yourself, they ran a shitty campaign. I think they spent way too much time not talking about economic issues. Way too much time focused on these little cultural issues. Stupid shit. Yeah. And so now to be like we told you so if I was a voter, I'd be like, you didn't tell me shit.


At least not enough. No, she she did. She might not have said it enough. That's my Point. Cool. That's that's why, that's why I'm like, don't, don't get on the high horse now. Like y'all were so high and mighty riding this out. Yeah. I don't see You get what I'm saying? Just, just because I don't think de the Democrats messaging was strong enough for them to justify saying we told you So I think that you can't I agree with that. No, I I I agree with you as well. But I think that this, I think that when Donald Trump's message was I'm gonna fix shit, the Democratic's message might have been, yo, this is what we're gonna do, blah blah blah. Don't nobody want to hear that. So it's not like she didn't say it. And again, I'm saying she outlined the plan and he just said I'm gonna fix it. Like broad stroke saying yes true. And so now I did outline what we were gonna parti possibly do. He just said, yo eggs high, I'm gonna fix eggs and gas.


Yeah. And y'all motherfuckers ran with that. I think going back to the initial point is Republicans, especially Trump and his administration and his people have are punching people face successfully been saying yes, whatever the fuck to get people to get up Side and punching you in your face. That's it. And the Democrats are going and saying, nah, yo, you know, actually actually the cheek. Yeah, you gotta turn up the cheek. It ain't feel when you smack a motherfucker, Donald Trump run around like, Well, but here, here's the Other, you can't keep playing this politically correct cool game. I agree. But here's the other thing tactically, I don't know if it works because when people are catching hell, nobody wants to hear. I told you so. I told you. Yeah, I think But y'all arguing is totally separate from that. I told you. So we getting away from the voice. No, I disagree. I think that, I think what's gonna happen is I told you so.


I told you so I told you so it's gonna now start winning in the, the congressional primaries. I told y'all motherfuckers what's going on. Aha. And now niggas gonna be like That's more like bitter rubbing in your face. No, that's I'm Saying I don't even take it as an ahaha. No it's, but what's gonna happen is that we trying to win the Congress back or not we, 'cause I'm not necessarily, But you know what people do. I think solution based like you, you supposed to, yes. That's not true. That's true. It should be solution based. Not So what Right now Time at a time like this is at a time like this, it gotta be solutions based. How You win the primaries back in Congress told this what gonna happen? So now when we come back to motherfucker do the right thing, Nobody wanna be talked to like that or feel like they're being talked down to at a Time when Donald Trump telling, calling niggas fat and all this other shit and the world resonated with his message.


So now y'all gotta start. That goes back to me talking about the Democrats don't even know that party don't even know how to speak to the voters. They don't know how to speak to The voters. They're doing a terrible job. I can't speak to the economic, the tariff fisher issues. I haven't studied this enough to, but I have spoken to a lot of voters on like the Middle East, just as another example. And as the bombings are continuing overseas, people are doing the same thing. We told you all this is Trump was gonna be worse than common alone. We told you, we told you, we told you. And this people shit is being set on fires. People's children are being killed. Nobody is Feeling good about hearing that. I told you so. And voters are saying it's not gonna make them more likely to vote. Now tariffs are a different issue. I, I, again, I don't, I don't wanna speak on something I don't know enough about. But what I will say is history, historically, voters don't always res, voters generally don't respond well to I told you so.


They tend to respond to this shit is broke, why don't you try this thing next time? You know what I mean? And, and that's where I would want to hear more from. Like, if I, if Kamala's gonna be the head of the party. 'cause Hillary Clinton did this And she's not. But this, that's the Other thing. And I'm agree, I'm disagreeing with Mark respectfully. She's not. I'm disagreeing with Mark, I'm disagreeing with you because what, what Donald Trump did was I told y'all, so look at what Joe Biden been doing. I'm gonna do something totally different. Yeah. If today, when you hear him talk, they don't talk about what the Republicans are doing to get things right. You know what they keep saying, yo sleepy Joe did this. Anything That's wrong. It's no. Yo Kamala did this. Y'all, y'all bugging the fuck out. Joe Biden did this. Here's Why I don So it worked. Here's why. I don't think it's a fair comparison. One, they, it wasn't in a moment of crisis.


Right. Part of How You think we had the same economic crisis under Biden. Well, No, that's my point. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me finish. Okay, let me answer you. I think that shit was fucked up under Biden. Why I didn ask a question. I was, you, you asked me how IIII was saying, what I'm saying is it's easier when you're in a moment of relative stability to convince people that shit could be better. And part of what Trump comes in and says is look at sleep. Like, look at sleepy Joe. You could be making so much more. We were so much better under me. Even though there's no crisis. At least domestic. Well, no, let me, and I want to add, add to your point. The Republican party has found their errand judge. He could go out there and say whatever the fuck he wanna say, they found their superstar person.


And that's the second thing, right? That Whatever the cockamamie message is, the majority is gonna agree to Democrats don't even have that person. Right? Nope. So a lot of this, they lose on just sheer personality before we get to messaging. And Trump and Trump has a cult like base that doesn't care about issues. They, they're not funda fundamentally. They're not voting based on Trump's policy. Yeah. They're voting based on Trump. Trump could, like he said, I could go out on Fifth Avenue, shoot somebody. I think Democrats need their Dwayne Johnson, Stephen A or whoever the fuck Stephen A, I don't even like hearing this. Like did all of this shit just said, oh We on the wrong. Right. We ain't about to win in 2029 either. If we talking like this. Yeah. Nah. They gone again. I think, I think everything that we saying, I don't think We on opposite sides of the spectrum. No, it's just, I think what you saying is, yo, we don't have a representative.


Right. Cool. And I think that the old, the old way of doing democratic shit has not worked. So I think that it, there has to be a new way and you following these old politically Correct. I'm gonna just be the good guy. Turn the other cheek trends, they have proven not to work. Okay. But the Democratic party is almost like the radio people finding out about the internet. They are the last people to find out that their way and how they've been gathering metrics and speaking to people is not in the wrong. The Republicans have been ahead. Right. I mean Right. So the Republicans have just been ahead of this particular issue for a little while. True. And now the republic, the, the tongue twister and now the Democrats are looking for their But they started late.


Yeah, they started Late. I agree. We all agree. There needs to be a, a different response to this moment than they've done historically. I just think the first time I got locked up, my brother, the lawyer came to get me out. And while I was sitting there, I was, it was helpful too. I still had to stay the weekend. But he, you know, you know he let me stay there for a long time talking to him until he went to the club. And anyway, he said pissed me off. But anyway, he said, I told you so he started breaking down to me all the shit I did fucked up and why I shouldn't have been there. I didn't wanna hear that shit right then. All I want him to do was tell me how I was gonna get home. Once I got home he could tell me all that shit. But right in this moment, I just want you to get me outta here. That's how people feel right now. That's a great example telling people in this moment of crisis what they did wrong. Nobody wants to hear that shit and they're not gonna be able to hear it. They're gonna get defensive mad.


Yeah. There's plenty of people that voted for Trump that are looking at the state of things and saying, I made A mistake. I may have been wrong on some of the reasons why I didn it. It don't matter. We didn't think of things. We in the thick of things, who cares? So what now? So what? Now we all gotta get on the same page. Yeah. And this is without me knowing that they was protesting anywhere. So please well see. Well, so CNN just released an article about the tariffs. It basically says tariffs on China are set to rise to at least 104% on Wednesday, which is fucking mind blowing. So he set to impose an astounding 104% in levies across Chinese, all Chinese imports on Wednesday. And this comes on top of Chinese tariffs that were in place prior to. They're going back and forth like it's How do y'all feel about the terrorist plan?


I'm sorry Mel. Yeah, no, it's long. Long term. Long term. I guess Every major, what's long term major? Every Long term is his administration Four years, five, Let's Call it five. I think it fails. They're calling it an economic winter and they're calling it a recession that rivals the great Depression. Every major economist is sounding the alarm that this is the absolute worst thing that can happen. They're world leaders from, I don't know how many countries are saying this is you. He, you gotta stop him. They had seven Wharton economists, right? Wharton is they grad, like they business school. And they said, yo, the shit that he's doing, none of them agreed with it. And they all ousted it. I think that the message behind what he's doing is resonating with the people more, which is we lost the country.


Right. And we gotta get it back. I'm not disagreeing with that. Theoretically. How you going about doing that is nuts. My nigga like, yo fam, you can't just go in the house and say, yo, y'all live here. Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna remodel the whole house at one time. Get out with nowhere to Live. So y'all just gotta sleep in that corner while we No, I'm gonna do the bathroom first. Okay. And then I'm gonna do this room first. I think it's a slow process and a slow burn. Burn. I wanna preface anything I have to say in this conversation with, it's not necessarily reflective of my thoughts and views. I just want to try to have the conversation. The Objection. Yeah. Why can't he do that? Because you hurt so many people in the process that People are gonna get hurt. See, I think he look at people as collateral damage and I think he don't look at people period.


I think that he look at he Just his destroy and rebuild thing. Right? That's why I just have a hard time when y'all get to talking about the world leaders and their response. 'cause whatever the fuck their plan was and what been going on, I'm not even talking about It ain't been popping. No, I'm not talking about it. I do think that you need somebody with radical views to do something totally against the grain and get shit popping to see real change. I think that lemme just land. I'm not Disagreeing. And I think that part of why he feels so empowered to do so is because we are the biggest consumer. So if I'm the biggest consumer and I'm doing all of the spending, then yeah. When I walk in Louis Vuitton, I'm putting my dick on the table.


But there's a this No. Am I off? No, but no you're not. But this is the thing, right? It's It is too. I'm sorry man, go ahead. No, I was gonna say the larger problem here is not necessarily, it's not necessarily what Trump is doing, even though it's fucking huge. It's the fact that Elon Musk is in, is in office. He's a problem. What? He's, that's a problem. He's got, he's got this, he's got this agency That's a big problem. That's shrouded in mystery. He has access to everything. Carte blanche fucking authority to do whatever he wants. They're firing federal employees, gutting federal agencies. This guy's a fucking foreigner. He's, he wasn't elected into office. Like what the, this isity Said she's the cutest What's, I just thought the foreigner part was funny.


He's coming from a foreigner, but yeah. Oh, Well I shouldn't be allowed to do shit either. You know what I'm saying? And as a foreigner, you should say foreigner, cooler Foreigner. It should Be a cooler way to figure Thater. Foreigner. Foreigner. Yo, listen, You right. I think, again, I'm telling you, I think his mindset is right. When you are in government, your job is governance. So you can't take your constituents and say, fuck y'all, I could care less how y'all get along. I'm gonna do X. Because now the people to Isis point are collateral damage fam. In DC I read a report that over the last three months, 8,000 houses went up for sale. DC is one of the highest cost of living in the country, fam.


So now you just gone wipe out that whole, fuck the houses we talking about, the gas stations, we talking about the cleaners, we talking about the nightclubs, we talking about the Wawas restaurants, all of that shit. Shit suffers. So if your whole thing that you ran on was economic progress, you are now saying, fuck y'all. I could care less about progress. And some of the shit is egotistical. Lemme lemme, lemme ask you a question today. Just, I'm not saying I agree with it either. What if my goal is economic progress, but the road is gonna be bumpy for a while. I think you roll it out Slow shit. Gotta get real Fucked up. I think you roll it out slow. I think you roll it, I think you roll it out slow for the humanity piece. I think you can't just say fuck all of these, in my opinion.


I agree. You can't. 'cause what's happening is he, he But I think y'all agree in there. I I think it contradicts his Trump point and his broad scope of what's going on. I think he don't give a fuck about the middle class and under. Exactly. And what, what makes up 90 something percent of the country? Yeah. Okay, I'm fine. Middle, middle class and under. So cool. So now you're gonna have this, this, this, this 10% that It is cool, but now the rest of your, 'cause again, we in government, this is not a corporation. Even though the United States is a corporation, but you can't run it like that. But for him, if he's focused on the ecosystem, then yeah, I need to incentivize the people that actually run the ecosystem.


And I wanted to address you. I'm not agreeing, necessarily agreeing with You. Yeah. We just having a conversation. Got it. Yeah. Louis Vuitton point, yo, if I spend mad money in Louis Vuitton, I could put my dick on the table. Yes. Cool. Chy can say, yo, I'm supplying 80% of your goods, 70% of your goods. You need me more than I need you. That's a fact That, that's a super important point. That's a very point. China, China Is the Joe button in this example, not the United States. But that's a temporary point. If, if I'm on some build and destroy, it's not, it's a temporary point. How long It is it gonna take you to build? Well, we don't know that part yet. And, and in and in your building process, let's, well let and in your building process, okay, but if you, your people are suffering, We got that part.


Gotcha. But he's already willing to make that. He don't care about that part. So if I'm just trying to change the shit, I have to start somewhere. Sure. So even if that says when they was talking that build the wall shit last turn, like I was like, well how the fuck long is that going to, he ain't care long the wall go up, it go up here. If it take five to 10 years, he started and now his administration goes down as the one that's responsible for changing how the shit goes. And I, and I think you've, He's on some America to great. We could do it here. We'll build the shit ourselves. We don't need these niggas, yada, yada yada. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. No, I I again, I'm not, but I do Understand the thinking. I'm not totally against what he's saying. I'm not totally against what he's saying.


I'm not totally against what he's saying. Me personally, I'm not totally against what he's saying. 'cause I think theoretically he has a good point. I think we've leveraged our consumerism and we made all of these countries around the world strong. If you look at India, if you look at China, if you look at some of these countries, their fucking whole GDP is predicated on us giving them money. Whether it's outsourcing telemarketing jobs or outsourcing economy like accounting, Manufacturing and Shit like that. Manufacturing, all that shit. Cool. When we wanna get these jobs back, it's a slow process. You understand what I'm saying? You can, in my opinion, this is my opinion. It is. I think it's slow possible. I don see it's possible To get them jobs back. Like it's, That's the problem because Americas are not doing it for what they Do it for.


Over there got point that may be true. But what I'm saying is whether it was Trump or somebody else, the person that comes in looks at hundreds of trillions of debt and says, you know what, I'm gonna attempt to get this together and then pulls out the accountant and just starts, alright, this don't go here no more. That person's gonna be looked at as the bad guy. You know what, this also doesn't address what this also doesn't address. Because what he's trying to talk, what he's doing is he's saying that the US no longer manufactures their own goods. Which is true. It is true. It is not Wrong. But what he's also not an like addressing is the fact that we also don't have the skilled labor force that would be able to occupy those jobs.


Because guess what? He just shipped them all out of the fucking country. He Didn't do that. No. That's part of his pitch. His pitch is I'm creating more jobs. He didn't Ship it out, But with people who don't have the skills, China just literally made like an ad and it was all of these, you know, regular Americans sewing, you know, sewing bras and sewing like, you know, and like making all of these things that we use for our daily lives. It was basically China saying you do not have the skilled labor force to occupy the jobs that you say you're bringing back to the country. I think That's, oh finally, let's have a real talk about stereotypes. I, that's insulting. I tell you all the Americans that I don't want working for me, I think that's insulting Uhoh. No, that's, that's the, because that's the insinuation of Me. We could have the labor force to do anything around the country.


The problem is the people that are over here are gonna make $22 an hour or $17 an hour. So now where's that? Because we Count these And say they cant make sneakers. Where's that gonna, where's that gonna, where's that gonna fool? So It's true though. That's guy. It is true. He's absolutely right. Where Fucking ling these 10-year-old. Exactly. They little laugh work the fingers. Hey, hey, Jordan's gotta come from somewhere. You guys are ridiculous. That is horrible. What's the price of them? Jordan's gonna be, what's the price of them? Nike is gonna go up. What's the price of the iPhone? I was just joking. What's the No, I know. What's the price of the cars? And so that's the shit that we gonna be bitching about. So even if his plan works, what's gonna happen when, 'cause the greedy as company owners are not gonna take less of profit profit margin.


No dog. Right now, right now, today the, the new Nintendo switch was supposed to go up for pre-order. Yeah. Yo, yo, that's his Shit. God's point. Lemme fucking land. There is a point here to what you just said. No, a good point ahead. It was supposed to go up for pre-order. Nintendo canceled it for America. You cannot order it because they said, yo, we don't know how much it's gonna cost due to terrorists. It's not made here. So sorry y'all, we we not releasing yet. This is, you know why? That's just one little piece. Like It is gonna start happening with everything else. I heard Corey was saying earlier, Mercedes say, yo, no, there's no more cars this year. I Just got an email that said all, all your little parts, they going Up.


I just, that's happening to me. This my, They come from overseas. Yeah. And the companies are not gonna take the loss. If he gonna charge us X on the tariffs, we gonna charge our X in the Es. So we copping Genesis now, nigga that that's American. Japanese. Japanese. What's America? What's the American called? Nothing. Couldn't tell you. A Buick. Oh, I like Buicks. You wouldn't drive one Cadillac? I wouldn't drive one. I drive Buick. You're crazy To the store. Yeah. You think I'm some party I'm not today. And you manipulate the airwaves to paint the picture of that nasty person. I would drive a Buick and if you hung out with me today, you would know I would drive a Buick. Buick Cadillac. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah, yeah.


Ford. Yeah. And I manipulate the Airway. All he does, that's all he does. That's what he said. That's all he does is all he does is manipulate the airways. Oh. That, That's what we, that's what I, this guy has a Nutcase and you can manipulate if you build it. Shout up nigga. This is the one thing I would add. True. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. Can't argue with that. Yeah. Shut up man. This is the one thing I'll add to the conversation. I, I just think empires fall. Every empire in human history is falling. We're Rome. Yeah. They just, yeah, we're Rome. We're Rome right now. And from 1945 until now, maybe about five years ago, the United States has been the superpower. There was a moment we were the shared superpower toward the end of this empire. But we are in decline.


Trump's plans are based on this idea. It's like a rapper that thinks they can make the comeback. You know what I'm saying? Or or athlete that think they can make the comeback. That's a good one. We can't make this comeback. The nations, the basic nations, Brazil, South Africa, India, China, they, they're on the rise. We don't have the military power to defeat these nations. We don't have the economic power and we don't have the diplomatic power because we lost the other two. You can only, you can only negotiate when you, so the idea of going to Louis Vuitton, which dick on the table, Dick on the table is a great example. It's just China is, is, I don't see is the person with the moderately sized penis? I don I don't see you putting it on the table. I don't see you or anyone else convincing America of that of those things. I don't think America believes that at all. They, They don't. Whether they believe it or not, but they believe in it based on some egotistical ideal of what the country Well that's part of the propaganda.


And watch the rapper don't think that he washed up. But you Know what he, the watched up Ballplayer don't Think he wash up. But you know when they find out, you know, when they find out, when they get back, when they get back, when somebody drop 40 on him or when the record don't sell. Yeah. But in the same example, I like that example. The watch up rapper does have a shot. Maybe He does have a shot, But then you say, Sorry, it's not a good example, but Well Well because they're not really wash up in, we're Playing, we're playing probabilities. No, no. We talking about a washed up rapper. And the chances would be even what? Put it at 3%. It's a shot. Right. But the problem is what's the, the difference with watch up rapper is if the other 97 plays out, nobody loses anything. Nobody. You plan, you plan a 3% probability with the lives of millions and millions and millions of people, There's a 97% chance It is gonna end up disastrous.


Come on, fan. And, and again, I don't know, hundreds of millions. I don't know enough about e economics to speak to it intelligently. So I try to, I don't try to talk about things I don't know about. But what I will say is, every economist that I've spoken to, and I did an interview on Al Jazeera last week with Richard Wolf, who's one of the leading economists in the world. And he brilliantly laid out just like these Wharton economists that this can't work. Yeah. So for me, I agree. I think we all saying the same thing. We needed a radical alternative. We need this a departure from the status quo. This is just a bad one. It's just a bad one. That's all I Think. Or It is just done too abruptly. I also, not to sound Trumpy again, I also don't want to hear niggas come tell me my idea is bad if ain't nobody else got an idea. That's, That's not true. I've heard that before. I think, I think what happens with him is when a nigga come with an idea that don't coincide with my idea.


You got fired. Yes. Or yo, Mr. Trump, I don't think we should be doing it this way. You fired fam. He sat and told the Republican niggas in Congress. If y'all don't like Elon Musk, you could get outta here. People got kids to raise in college tuitions to pay and mortgages in high ass DC I Don't fuck with Elon Musk boy. So I'm, I owe one of 'em cyber trucks. I would write Toyota on the back. Like them niggas doing, doing, I would write fucking Buick or some shit dog right on the back. So, so that, that's the point. Like, yo fam, I'm gonna get along because I got bills to pay. Mm. I don't think the Republicans fuck with him. Here's a stupid question. Five seconds or less. Where do y'all think humans come from?


Monkeys Adams. I have no idea. Humans were created it. I always say that buy another species Got some Adams, we got monkeys, we got a different something. So created Us hybrid like, like the sea monkey shit they used to have back full of kids and shit. We was, we were an experiment. And then left Ish flip. Listen, I don't do it. I don't know how to answer that. Yeah, I, I don't know. We've been talking all his political shit. Stephen A Smith announced yesterday on his Twitter that he is now open to running for president. That previously he said it was off the table, but now he, after looking at the country and the state that it's in and after looking at the lack of candidates, the lack, the lack of a bench that Joe talked about, that he is considering a run for president and that he'll let us know in 20 26, 20 27 to be Sure in 2027.


I'm gonna let you know how the public looks at all that Max Kelman shit in hindsight. Trumpish, That's all I have on the matter. Trumpish. I don't have nothing else in the matter. I don I'm not saying nothing else in the matter. Stephen A is a friend of the show. Same. I fuck with him. I see what he doing. If you had 2% of whatever, maybe you do the same. Some of his actions over recent years will be called into question if he ends up on, that's all I'm saying. My advice to him, and I love Stephen A he's my friend, is you just signed a hundred million dollar deal. Keep that for five years, that's 20 million a year.


Do not jeopardize the brand. 'cause once you run for president, half the ES PN audience don't fuck with you one side or the other. I don't care what what you want. Yeah. Half of 'em don't fuck with you. And I don't know if you can ever recover that. So unless you're sure you're gonna win. And I'm sure he is not. That's not safe to say What? That you lose half of the ES ESP n audience. You will. You don't know that. Okay. Well how about that? You don't know that ES espn as a whole is not really covertly a right wing channel altogether? It Could be. Oh, you said it could be more. Yeah. Oh yeah. I I'm I'm saying it could be worse. Yeah, no, he's running as a Democrat. That's the thing. He's gonna run as a Democrat. So he's running against Maga, he's running against JD V. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying all them NASCAR watching motherfuckers ain't going. Yeah. They suddenly not gonna think that Stephen A is all right with me.


They're gonna start saying we don't fuck with him depending On what he says. And ain't no way to run for president and not say something against them if you run to win. I don't know that to be true either. Mark. I don't know that that's true. I think this, we just said the Democrats have had a problem with messaging. Oh you said if he running, just don't say shit Or say something That appeals to all. Or he could get up there on his OJ shit. I don't see color. He could, you don't know what he might say as A black man Running. That's fair. I mean, I would say based on his, his recent press run where he's been given political opinions but nobody, they still think it's cute 'cause he's still mainly talking about basketball and he could pivot. 'cause people pivot when they run far. That's fair. But if he don't pivot and he stays the track he's on, I don't think it's worth it.


I, you know, I was asked to run for Green Party Vice President in Oh in 16. And the reason I didn't run slow down for a minute. What? Just slow down. My BP looked like me. He be saying shit so smooth. You got asked to run for Green Points. Green Party. Green Party nigga Green Green nigga. I thought that's what he was talking nigga Green Party Party Brooklyn Party. Yo, The Green Party. Jill Stein was at the top of the ticket and she asked me to be her running mate in 2016. And she called me in July, July of 2016 and said, do you want to run?


And I I I had the same consideration. I mean obviously I I I wasn't gonna win. But I had the same considerations. Like what? Assuming I don't win what's at stake? Are you single in 2016? What hours is this in the show? Three. Three. Oh yeah, I was single enough. Yeah. Yeah. I was outside. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Got it. And but here's what I thought, I thought a couple things. One, if Donald Trump loses that's not true. My, my first thought was financial. When you run for president, you have to leave all your journalism jobs. You cannot have a journalism job and run for political office. So they had, they let you out of your contract to do it. Now if they fuck with you, 'cause it happens on CNN all the time, all those political commentators that run for senate, they CNN lets em out their contract or MSN M Ms C or whoever.


They let you outta the contract. And then once your run is over, they just give you a new deal. But if they don't like you, they use that as the out clause and don't give you the new deal. They don't have to give you a new deal. 'cause that's in all the clauses. Stephen A would be banking that after his run is over, that ESPN would welcome him back with another deal. And they might, you know, and I'm speculating on his deal, he could have a very unique deal. But this is 99% of deals. But if you say the wrong thing on that trail or something gets exposed or this, you know, all these stories come up from the past. I'm not talking about personal stuff. I'm talking about professional stuff. You might be in a worst negotiating process. You rolling Dice. Dice. Yeah. There might, you could be worth 200 million. I'm on the other side of that. Or you could be worth, I think this is the beginning of Stephen A kissing ESPN goodbye as a whole.


Altogether. I think that he may have learned some things during this negotiation process that left him a little peeved. I don't really know that that 20 million number is a number that he was happy with. And if you do this presidential shit, win, lose or draw, draw, what comes from that? The numbers that these niggas get on the book, tip on the speaking tip. I don't think he's looking at 20 million a year ever again. Peace. That might Be true. I think this would be the proper propelling of his independent career If it goes well. And now I have a podcast. I'm don't wanna tell you about the money that the Obamas have gotten in podcast world without releasing a thing. That's True. And you did say it also one and Look that that's two.


It is, that's a two part thing. You did say also if a journalist, they let you out your Contracts, right? Yeah. They force you outta your contract. You, you have an out Who says it's not consistent Ish? The the Obama's got mul. Multiple podcast bags. Yeah. Oh yeah. They got huge podcast. They got, I know they got, I know they got the one big One. No, they got multiple big ones. Multiple, not just one. Okay. Yeah. They got, you know, they, they getting crazy, right? Yeah. They got some some different Shit. But again, shit worked out well. When Is, is there gonna be a time when Michelle or Barack can't walk in the office and say, I'm demanding eight figures to talk X There's not gonna be a time where that don't happen fam. You could go do a commencement speech for a university and get seven figures.


Yeah, but but that's because they won you. We wouldn't say that about Howard Dean. We wouldn't say that about John Edwards. You Right. I mean there's a lot of people who, there was a moment where they were the shit. John Edwards is rich though, But Yeah, but I'm saying but he can't, he can't get a speech at That's true at, at Kings in front of Kings. Right. Like there's a way that you just can't, I wouldn't risk it if I were him. And then the other thing is, how does your core audience feel about you? The reason I didn't go on the VP ticket was if Trump wins and I didn't and I thought Hillary Clinton was gonna win. I did too. But I said if Trump wins and we are the spoiler, black people are gonna hate me. Oh yeah. Yeah. So I'm just saying if JD Vance wins or if the wrong person wins and, and, and he's part of a ticket that took away votes, people are going to resent the shit out.


People, people hate tweet me every day for just voting green. Right. They send Joe Stein death threats for being the candidate. I'm just saying Stephen A has managed to make a wonderful brand. There's no one like him. He's the best at what he does ever. I don't know. I I, it just seems like too much of a risk with too little of a reward. Alright. Yeah. We did it. That was a real good, we killed it. We killed that shit. And I let it rock. I didn't step on it. We did our mature thing. Tariffs president. We did it right. Did it. We did it.


Alright. I got that shit in me like fucking like flip, flip. Say you can't sit still for too long. I can't be mature for, for too long. I can sit still. That was a great run. Yeah. Too long of a run for me. I can't, I'm sorry. You did good though. I'm, yeah, when I'm 47 or 48 maybe, but not right now. You Said that about 44. He sure did. I'm sorry though. I changed my mind. We know 44 came too close. I'm too lit still to be mature. Okay. Sorry. Alright. We do have a Part of the Show from someone named Deron P What Up Deron? What's that? Dp. Deron P says, Hey entire JBP cast.


I have a difficult question I need help with. I found out some years back that my mother's father, my grandfather was not her biological father when I brought up the topic and wanting to know who my biological grandfather is, she doesn't really give any details and tries to ignore the subject. There's one sensitive subjects here. I only want to know because for one reason her stepfather passed away 12 years ago. Which led me to wanting to know who my biological grandfather is. I always wondered growing up why my mom was treated differently from her brothers and sisters were. And my grandmother always tried to protect her from the bad treatment from siblings and my grandfather.


How do I approach this question and express to my mother how important that that information is to me and my family? A little backstory, I'm in my late thirties and have had some health issues arise and family medical history has become more important to me in the past than in the past. Mm. Thank you all for your help. I think that's A great question. I think that's the, the approach Yeah. Is to know what the actual family medical history is because you know, otherwise you're just kind of like flying blind. Yep. And at that age you really want to know, you know, what might be coming down the pipeline on you. Yeah. But it sound like he's tried that and Yeah. And they've avoided the Issue. And I think we doing best case scenario, we don't necessarily know how this lady was conceived and it might be something way more That might be why she's hiding Exactly.


Like why she's hiding the story. Exactly. Because she doesn't have all the information herself Or the information is embarrass Or embarra Painful. That's true too. I didn't Think of that. Yeah, that's what, yeah, I just, I, I always like to give, as awful as the story sounds, sometimes when people don't give information or something happens, I always try to give a personal benefit of doubt. Especially women in this situation. 'cause there's a lot of factors like shame and pain and all this other shit that we don't often think about. I agree with Isha on that, but I think the good thing about this moment is, and obviously I've been through this, so I understand there's other means. You know, a lot of people find out who they, you who their parents are through 23 and three ancestry. Yeah. Yeah. Like I would say try and find other means if your mom doesn't help you, but also approach it from a place of not saying, why is my mom so being so stubborn or awful about this thing, but saying like, why might she not wanna gimme this information?


That was great. By the way, question to all of you. Do you guys think that your immediate family sh do you guys think that you should know your immediate family's traumas? Yeah. Yeah. I, I don't. All all, no. Maybe Not all. No I don't for, for the, I don't necessarily agree with that. But for the people agree with what? That you should know their traumas. I Was asking this Question, but for the people that subscribe to your trauma, It is genetic.


Then If it's genetic, you gonna find out when it's in. You're gonna find out. I wanna send you nigga. Yeah. But you wanna know why you are responding with to certain shit the way you respond. Mm. I think my family is very open about that type of shit with each other. And I think we've, at least I'll try to speak for all of us. We help each other 'cause some of us go through similar shit and if my sister or my mother or whatever is going through something that I went through or vice versa, we can help each other out. I think it's like crazy to not share that. Now granted there may be some things that you want to keep private So you stand on the side of Yes. Yes. For the most part. Gotcha. There are some things again maybe you don't wanna share. It's funny, when I was doing the human series, some of the white families I was meeting, I found that they were keeping things secret because they couldn't go to dad and talk about depression or, and then dad couldn't go to his dad and talk about depression and things that I was struggling with.


So it's good to hear you say that about your family, but when you say that, I think equally like mom and dad, y'all are good talking about that shit just all around the board or there's one better. My mom is Way better than my Dad for sure. And that's what it I typically find. Yeah. Yeah. The men. Men, we suppressed a lot of shit. Yeah. Me and my mom could talk about whatever. I don't know if I really know anything that my dad is traumatized about. Yeah. Man, I don't know shit. Men suppressed that shit. Both monetary. I was grown when I found out that my pops wasn't away of college was in prison. I didn't even know that. Like that was his story that he was telling me writing letters and stuff and telling me he was away of school. And I believed it until it that that was let slipped to me when I was what, 21 years old. Wow. I was like, wait, what? No, no he wasn't.


And then I had a conversation with him and that's the truth. So it's, I don't know nothing about that side of the family like that. Got it. Shit that trans, you know, medical shit. Nothing wasn't Penn State, state Penn. Hey. Got it. Got it. All right. I don't have anything else for y'all. I didn't mean to make anybody sad. Nah, nah nah. We good? We good? We still good? Sorry. We still good? Let's roll Straight. Alright, now we can do sleepers One. Hey let's get to it. The sleeper king has returned Ish is here. I want to hit the round of applause button for Ish.
