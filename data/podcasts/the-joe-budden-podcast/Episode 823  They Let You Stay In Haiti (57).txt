Niggas don't never have that. And we gotta start this part. Niggas don't never have that conversation. Like when you in a relationship with somebody or got a relationship with somebody and, and you help her with the business, do you don't ever stick the terms right? No, no, no. That corny to do. Yes, I think so. Okay. But I think if it's the other way around, they women. Women. But women, I think it's corny. Women take the terms though. That can't be corny. I seen women taking Terms. If I give you a hundred grand to start your nail salon and your nail salon, get the rocking in year three, bringing in 600 grand a year.


Good. I'm not supposed to. Oh, okay. What, nevermind what, what's The relationship? I was about to say, what kind of relat This with your lady? Does it matter? Yes. Yes. Tell me more. I don't know if it does dog. Yeah. I I don't think it does either. What Do you mean? I don't think it does either. If you are in a relationship and you invest in your girl, you, you investing in y'all, in y'all. You're not investing in her. You investing in y'all. S That ain't necessarily true. Not true. That's not true. That's not necessarily true. It Is. If that's just your girlfriend, then that's a whole different conversation. Your wife is different. Yeah. If it's a relationship that's going to end and you need some terms, but if it's lady, You think it marriage can No, no, but I'm saying if you dating somebody that you know, ain't it.


I'm saying I'm, I'm writing some terms. I'm not investing me either. But if I do, I'm writing the terms down. I, I'm like doing it with my wife if she wanted do some For business. But mark, even if, you know, it's it, a lot of, we see situations where nigga you in a situation, you, you get a beauty salon, a nigga you on the outs. It ain't nothing wrong with trying. It happens. I tell people get turns. You Go turns. Yeah. I don't know if how I've seen that shit in all the time Dog. Yeah. Half Shit. Shit. Time out. Time Because now you fronting time out because I had a situation where a nigga wanted to borrow some money from me and I told the nigga to put me in the deed at his house and you castrated me for it. I remember that you castrated me for it, but I think he did. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you, the person that you lay with, that you have raw sex, lemme finish.


Please cast the person that you lay with, that you have raw sex with you, you, you'll write some terms for them. But your man or somebody else that want borrow some money. A hundred grand. It was, I think he was, I think it was right Terms. Antoine, you are misrepresenting what my point was in that earlier conversation. So let me tell it to you. The first premise was your man was in a bind and needed a hundred grand. Your friend was in a bind and needed a hundred grand. Okay. That's a friend in a bind. I'm talking business. I'm not talking about somebody you love being in a hard spot. If, if any one of my friends is in a hard spot, they could come to me and get the money, no questions asked. If you come to me and say I need a hundred grand for my business proposal, I'm gonna do the same thing that the bank do and ask about the fucking business and state my terms.


That's not the same at all. It's not the same at all. Let's start the part. I I It is crazy. I kind of think It is the same. I think we, I don think It is. I think we should just start get back to, Because it's the same level. I kind of see where you at though. Y'all Got it? I I Well Listen, be clear. There's no right or wrong here. It is just what you would do. Yeah, Yeah. In the situation. I, I I see a diff I see, I see your point. I see the difference. There is a difference. But I think y'all were wrong to follow him about that. 'cause at the time, his point was, because I, I heard that when it was like, look, it's relation to how much money you have. Like, I can't afford it. I can't afford to just get somebody a hundred grand because if they, if they, if they don't ever pay it back, I'm fucked up being, to me, being on the deed of somebody That that guy wasn't included in the premise.


The guy that can't afford to do It is not, wasn't in the conversation or this was somebody first. You can't afford to lose it. Okay. Like you might, you see what I'm saying? You've got it. But like, I, I can't afford to I'm it if I, I'm gonna feel it if I don't get it. 'cause because y'all were saying you could afford that and he was saying the hundred to me might be like a million to you or or two, whatever. Thank you. What? I'm so, so, so yeah. Like if somebody borrow, if somebody ask me right now for a thousand, you Stating terms don't change that then. But that's the security that he said by putting But being on the deed is the Why I'm stating, That's why I wanna be on your deed. That's the collateral Stating Terms. All of that's fine and dandy. But if a nigga take that a hundred grand and go blow it, then you're in the same Boat till you sell your house. No you're Not. How not? So, because The collateral that you put up is my my recourse.


Right? The house. The house. Him being on a deed, you go blow that money. I still can go Where did the house an asset About his man's Example? He was, he was saying before he remember he said, I I will put, I'll give you the money, but I'd put my name on your DEA house and y'all were kill. That's collateral now as collateral. That's some example that fits what he's saying in that. I agree. And that what I'm saying, the person that's your friend don't have a house. You don't have the Scenario that we were talking about. The person had a house. The scenario that we were talking about that happened on this show, the person had a house And I said I needed my name to be on the deed. And you said What? What you put your name? Yes. I don I don't recall it that way. And in that, in that I would agree. I don't remember that. I'd have to go listen to it.


But in that, alright, that would be your terms. I'm talking about a nigga that's your man is just coming to you that needs some money. He don't have nothing. That's probably why he's coming to you for some money. But, but think about, I'm not stating terms to that person. That's in a time of need. Are you gonna ask when you gonna get it back? No. You ask that question. No. No. What, what if it's a million dollars? That's me. But what if it's a million dollars? If that's a million dollars, that's outta my tax bracket. I don't, I don't have an ancillary million dollars to loan someone more. That's not, I'm not in that. And, and and that's what there's this, there's a number where like you can afford to give it, but you can't afford to eat it if he, if you never get it back. And I think that's what the terms afford. Just like with me, for me it's the same thing with the business. Like if it's my wife, I'm not, first of all, ain't no dude giving his wife no terms for no money to give it.


If they say that they lying. They, they, that's what they just said. Yeah. I know. I I don't believe it. But if it's somebody other than my wife. Yeah. You getting some terms because I'm worried about what happens if it, if it blows up or what happens if it don't work either way. If, if it blows up and you leave me, or if it don't work, I can't afford to eat a hundred. Yo. I kind of don't even care if it blow up. I just want my money back. If I loaned you a hundred grand and you make $5 million Offa Me that you Don't want none. You don't want none of it. I don't necessarily have to get that. If it's a stranger. Yeah. But if it's somebody that I fuck with, oh, I I just want my money back. My money back. Take the word Wife out of it. And does your, does your stance change If it, if it's a woman that I'm just dealing with and fuck with? Yeah. It don't change.


It, it, wait, what? It all comes. You said take wife. Like if it's like my girlfriend, like long term girlfriend, you mean? Yeah. I, it don't change. It don't change. It don't for Me. It don't change for me. I feel a lot more courageous asking for them terms. But I don't know if I would. But I don know if I would do It. All right. Let ask let me ask you before, let me ask you, so what's your stance on like putting, putting your, if your significant other wanted to go to school or something? Mm. That's a good question. What's your stance on that? That's different to me. No. Why? It's not different in, it's still investment. It's Still an investment. You're investing in them. You put them through medical school, you're investing in them. Now they go and become a doctor and they making whatever much a year, but they leave you.


Yep. It's the same thing. It's the same exact thing. Nah, I don all look it the same way. I Don't agree with It. Okay. I don't look at it the same way. It's the same. It's not to me. But You're investing in their business the exact same way? Sort of But not really. It's not the same. It's not the same. I Don't, I don I don't look at it the same either. Yeah. Okay. And why you fucking bitches that want ambition? How Old, How old is this person she wanna Read? How old is this person? I'm just saying bro, niggas go back to school.

This broadcast is brought to you by a few By Power. By PrizePicks. PrizePicks gang.


And before we go any effort, oh, Clear out. Boy, it was a lot of chitchat from the experts, the analysts, the retired NBA players. Oh, Okay. Here We go. I gotta do what Parks. Yeah, you gotta go. No, you I was going, I was gonna call Jerry Jack still Just to see what you pissed the niggas is up to. But yeah, everybody on ESPN and FS one and anybody with a microphone. The conversation seemed to be what? What had the greater odds? The Knicks getting swept or this going to six?


I thought that was offensive. I did Brian Hurst, he said the Knicks Jho. And I quoted ticker tape parade. If this indeed gets to six games. Y'all were talking like the Celtics were the 96 Bulls, the 2017 Kevin Durant Warriors. Whatever year that was, y'all was talking like these was just, and It is a great team, really expensive team. Can't wait for them to break up after this year. Wow. That's awesome. But all we did is go into your building, get down by 20 I turned the game off.


I was tight. That was, that was, I was tight when I went on Twitter at the End of the night. Let y'all partake every three in the world disgust. Let y'all grab every long offensive rebound to clang off the front of the rim. Let y'all get us in foul trouble. Let y'all get called Anthony. I'm not even gonna call him that 'cause he was straight cat for most of the game. The best ability is availability and he wasn't even on the floor. We let y'all do all of that only to come back and steal game one. And still the next day. They don't say, Hey go Knicks for stealing game one. They say the Celtics gave it to you. They Did. You Disagree. Thanks.


So thanks Hit. That's true. Thanks. I mean, you win is a win. You Can't all, you can't gimme something if I don't extend my hand out. But I don't take it. I gotta do my job and you giving me something. Yes. They blew it and he literally took it. The Celtics blew it. Yeah. Okay. Also, Jalen Brunson is the NBA's clutch player of the year for a reason. So in the event that this game gets close in the fourth quarter, you feel good. We ask some. Yeah. And say what you want them Celtic nigga, them Celtic niggas is injured and Dinged up. Get these old ass niggas the fuck out of the building. See now I'm just talking nice. I don't wanna talk Stats no more.


Jayla Brown, James Brown, Antonio Brown, Bobby Brown. Round up the fucking brown. Nick said six Nigga, I ain't talking stats No more. Fuck is you talking about? You really Think that Nick's gonna win the series? Huh? You really think the Nick's gonna win the series? Who Knows Because he, you know the next question's Gonna be a bet. Zaire hit me immediately. Yo, I still got the Celtics. You want to Bet I got the Celtics? No nigga, get off my phone Because you know God damn well the Knicks ain't gonna win this series. I Don't know that. What I saw last night was a dinged up, a dinged up Boston Zynga left early Drew Holiday for as great of a defender as he was on Jalen Brunson.


He wasn't himself. He wasn't himself. Jason Tatum. I think a large reason for the Celtics making the jump this year is his consistency in his superstar role. Yep. If he's gonna go back to being inconsistent like last night and if Jalen Brown and them niggas are gonna act like it's just a cakewalk or read your own press clippings then Yeah. Nigga Nixons in six Ns. In Six I I think you over. What The fuck is we talking about nigga? I think you overthinking it. Yeah. I think that Celtics plague the worst game nigga possibly play. So Did the Knicks. That's the worst coaching event. So Did the Nicks worst coaching and, and and so did the Knicks. And you still need a overtime to win. I think Celtic, we Didn't need overtime to win that little layup at the end of the game is a make 99% of the time.


Stop it. That's don't be stupid. That's not, That's Get, let's not get Foolish If he made what he missed. Well yeah, if the Celtics made the threes that they, I mean all I'm saying is the Celtics are a better team. I Also don't say you need overtime to win if you come back from however much they were 20. Yeah. I don't want a Celtic just Difficult. It is hard to match again is all I'm saying. I don't think that Celtic is gonna play that bad again. And I don't think y'all have the, the talent to beat them in in six or seven games. Hey, Hey buddy. It's the Celtics that are in a must win situation right now. This talk doesn't align with that. Here's another piece of it. Are you going to the Knick games game three? Oh yeah. I thought Celtics. Oh you should stay home man. Celtics in five or six now in the back. You ain't won a game. Ain't won a game. Y'all couldn't be Rice High School right now.


But you fucking Don't do that to Rice Race man. Nah, I don't want hear all that shit. I don't want hear that shit right now. We up one. Oh. Must win for the Celtics. Hey and that building sounded a little Nicky last night. Sounded a little Nicky last night. Yeah. Fix your fucking faces. We in New York. What's up? I'm down nigga. What's up? I'm with you. We won. Fuck is wrong with you. Niggas Keep that same energy at game four, game five. When y'all down three to one. He Won't. And when they, and when they go out four one, he gonna be like, yo, we ain't even look forward to winning. I said in the beginning that we wasn't going win. Pu gotta do rebuilding, blah blah blah blah blah.


That's Exactly what he gonna say. Pussy ass boy. Exactly. What's gonna come? What niggas the puss ass boy, pussy boy? They'll say they don't say pussy puss as boy. Yeah we ain't, we don't want hear none of that shit. One, nothing. Indeed. You drop the ball later done. That's it. You're done. That's it. I ain't even gonna dmt we talking before the game. Fuck that nigga. Nah, don't do that though. Yeah, don't, don't don't Do. Please do it. No talk shit. Talk crazy to him. No, No, no, no, no, no. Think 60 That yo. Leave that One alone. I blew my prospects bag yesterday. Don't talk Funny Brunson. There's nothing much to say. Lose Spanky. Go Knicks. What a win. Feels great to be up one.


Nothing. With the Celtics in a must win situation. The man Knicks Nicks up too old Next game too. Old next game since they won Be Soft. I felt like such a bitch Since they won. Be soft about it. I turned on that game song score and I was like, fuck. I guess we watched the Met Gala. Yeah. That some socks. Lemme go Look at the gowns. I put the game. Yeah. I put the game on the the phone. Yeah man. Congratulations to the Knicks. I'm certain that we'll talk about this a little later on. Oh for sure. Where do you guys, where would you guys like to begin? We can start with the Met Gala if y'all want. I see you were in your fashionista bag last night. You know I was gonna be in my fashionista bag. It is story. I felt bad for you. 'cause I was like, I wish Sade was here. 'cause that was like my favorite shit in the world is sitting around with my girl who was the nicest human being I think I've ever met in my life.


And just shitting on people for three straight hours. Even though a lot of people were super fly, but the people that weren't Yeah. They were getting it. Yeah. I have to say man, well actually I won't start. How, how's that? Did any, did anybody else see some of the outfits, some of the red carpet I saw we saw some of the outfits. Yes. 79% of white people looked a mess. Yeah. Yeah. It didn't seem like they didn't really get what the theme was. They thought that, what was the theme? The theme was super fine. Dandyism Dandyism. But the, the theme, it was called Black Tailored Fly Shit. Yeah. And Ode to Suits and Ties and just, and Tailor Taylorism.


Gotcha. Black the fly shit. Yeah. So I think that when they heard super fine, you know, you know black tailoring, they Just thought wore Black. They thought wear Black. The stitching itself should be black. Yeah. And it's like you No, that's not what they meant. You Know, it was bad. Yeah. 79% of white people looked an absolute mess. Agreed. Last night. Who were some of the ones that looked The worst? So, well, first, that's what I, it was co-chaired. It had four co-chairs. It was asap Rocky Louis, Hamilton, Coleman Domingo, and, and Pharrell. And all four of them looked incredible in, in all their, you know, various different things. Coleman Domingo's first outfit was like a nod to Louis Hamilton.


Shit was fire. It was, are We not gonna talk about people that we thought didn't nail it? Let's absolutely shit on people. Oh, we got to a thousand percent we shit on people. What? Pharrell nail it. Hmm. Pharrell didn't nail it. I didn't Like the people that Pharrell dressed like Doche. I love Doci. I didn't like the way I thought Louisie had an amazing night. So I'm not shitting on them. I'm just talking about Pharrell specifically with the 10,000 pearl, 20,000 Pearl Blazer, Superfly. I just don't think it did what it needed to do in pictures. It was very calm in pictures and I just Oh, I see. I'm looking at it now. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. But I like it too actually. I like It.


I like it. The thing is, I think that it translated too calm. It probably translate translated a lot better in person. Like, he's like the creative ambassador for Louis Vuitton. So Zendaya, who was one of the best dressed on that carpet. Oh, I Disagree. What? She, she's usually way better dressed than she was last night. But It, but she re she, that was literally the theme. That was it. You know, she had like a Louis Vuitton tailored zoot suit. That shit was fucking incredible crush. But there's a difference, I think between nail the theme and looking like spectacular. And she looked great. Like, she always looks great, But I, I guess agree to disagree. I thought she looked spectacular. Well, Well, she, I thought she nailed the theme and looked spectacular.


Zendaya. Yes. Yes. Diana Ross is another one that shut down the car. She what? The massive train. And it had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on it. Smoke Rihanna, of course. Always shut down the carpet. Soft launching baby number three. Congratulations. And a Mark Jacobs a outfit. And just, she killed it as well. Mark Jacobs had a good night. I mean, Mark Jacobs had a real good night too. He, he really did. What'd You think it Coleman Domingo? I, I, yeah, He wore, he wore several though. Okay, so the first one was a nod to Andre Leon Talley. The, the big, you know, the electric blue? The purple, yeah. Yeah. The, the purple blue. Whatever color that was the shawl. The long over. Yeah. The ornate Decor.


And I wanna say that that was Valentino. Oh. I believe the first look was Valentino. Yes. Okay. And that second look, I, you didn't ask me. He killed both those looks. The second look was Valentino too. The great, the great you talking about the gray with the J, the black. That was the fly. The black and white shit was absolutely fired was Valentino. That shit looked crazy. I think that also, I think that everybody that did the, the two look thing crushed do Mango Damon, I Idris, when he came out in the race car, shit was fine. Smashed it on The, the shit underneath. It was first. I was like, what is this bullshit? And then once he took the shit off that suit underneath, damn, what did Woo Suit was fire. Damn. No, I gotta find out who that Was.


Tessa Thompson was another actress that really killed it. Looked, because she smoked, she looked great. She looked incredible. And I really liked DCI's outfit. Cardi. I didn't care for that. Cardi. Cardi. Cardi amazing. Yeah. She cur Washington. I like, I Love Carrie Washington. Janelle Monet. But she, you know, Expected It is super simple, but I liked it. Yeah. Who was Usher wearing P Ralph Lauren. Ralph Lauren. Which is probably, I thought Burberry had, I thought Burberry had one of the best nights. I'm not gonna let y'all just smooth over Cardi like that. That was a Burberry look amazing. Cardi looked incredible. She did, If I'm not mistaken, her manicure took like two fucking days.


Jesus. God damn. Yeah. Like, I mean, it, it, it's at least six figures per outfit. Like, that's how, like, that's just the whole production for each person that goes there easily. You know, Jody Turner Smith was my look of the night. She was Burberry also. She looked great. Was that Was the burgundy shit. Jody, Jody Turner Smith and Tiana. Ti Taylor. Tiana Taylor. Yep. Oh Yeah. Tiana amazing. Oh, Tiana also Wilson. We, that's what we were watching was the Vogue strain, which was Tiana and I can't remember the SNL actress's name and Lala. And it was great. Yeah. Tiana Taylor is a fucking Tiana. Taylor was natural At this shit. She Is, she was dressed by Ruth Carter. Ruth Carter.


Exactly. Who's like an Oscar winning costume. Costume designer. Costume designer. Exactly. Like from Black Panther and a myriad of other films. But Tiana Taylor, I love the outfit. Tiana Taylor probably has to get outfitted the night for me. 'cause of the duality, right? Like with the theme being Fly Men suit, tailoring and all that. She did that to a T but the Heel was feminine. I wanna say that was Mark Jacobs, the Durag under the fucking, under the hat, the layers, the texture. She absolutely smoked it. I expected None less from Tiana Taylor. And again, a great hosting. Big Harlem, great, great hosting.


Big Harlem. Big T. Who else I wanna talk about? Louis Hamilton killed Louis Hamilton. Yeah. He killed Lewis Hamilton. Saw was And Wells Bonner. Wells Bonner. That look. That clean aesthetic. That hat. That hat that hat. Oh my God. Yeah. Park's your boy. Bad bunny. He, he looked, oh, Oh, he, he looked, He incredible. He Smoked. He went crazy. That hat. Yeah. I want to say that he was Prada. I know. Yes. It was Prada, I believe, I want to say that was PR bad Bunny looked amazing. Did that, that custom custom hat that they put on Him, which was like a traditional Puerto Rican hat thing kind of goes in the theme with the album he is doing and the tour he is doing.


And the bag smoked. A lot of people I thought went wrong in their choice of bag. I don't recall who it was, but somebody had a briefcase of roses. I didn't think that was necessary. Some of the bags were just off. But that bad bunny bag. Oh, Was that a bag on the back of Andre? 3000 shaped like a piano. I we're gonna hold that one off to the end later. I just, I was just, let's save. We're talking. We'll, we'll save it. I just save, that was the bag. Let's save him for later. We'll save that for later. But yeah, the, a lot of the outfits that we're describing, they were like, it was, it was really sensational and they really stayed on theme. And it was such, it's a dramatic turn from the people who didn't stay on theme. I think. I think the men were smoking the women's boots a little bit. I Would agree with you. I would agree with you a lot.


Which I guess the theme lens into it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like the whole, you know, dandy choir. That was really interesting. You know, I haven't really still settled on how I felt about it. Wait, a Dandy choir? Yeah. You didn't see the choir of black men singing? Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean you don't know how you felt about it? I guess it was kind of, it was in theme, but then it also kind of, I don't know. It almost had like a, I don dunno. Like a, like a male, like a I don know Mel. Yeah.


What? No, I'm, I'm just, I'm trying to find the words. I'll, I'll, I'll find the words. But it just had this like, kind of haunting kind of quality to it. I don't know if that's the right word, but I think so. It Looked, it looked Jack and Ish to me. Alright. Neither one of y'all would be the allegations. Let's go. That Was scary. That was scary to you. Ma'am. Y'all No, Y'all From Y'all. What? Just be aware. No, I'm, I'm not saying anything bad about it.


I thought that they, I thought it was great and I loved the uniformity of their outfits. I loved all of it, but it just kind of like had a haunting quality. And I don't know if it's because I'm thinking about the history of Dandyism, like the original, like the history as far back as it goes. That that was what they were trying to convey. Or maybe that's just something I was picking up on. I think, what is The history of Dandyism? So if I'm not mistaken, lemme look. The history of Dandyism, the original, like the origin point is like, slave masters were bored as fuck. And like to dress up their slaves in their clothes. You Dunno. You're doing anything. Okay. I don't, I don't know. I can't comment on It. Okay. It, I, somebody can correct me, but if I'm not mistaken, this is something that I read somewhere.


Black Dadism sort of, it it, yeah. That's not wrong. It, I mean, dandyism goes before slavery in a certain way and the, the stylized figure. But the black dandy is like an interesting person 'cause of how he got stylized during slavery, but also after Yeah. Like when black people could buy their own clothes. Yes. Yeah. We got fly as shit. Yes. To me That's the, but it, and it was also reflective of just how much economic, you know, security and power we had during, after slavery, which was, which we were robbed of. Yeah. You know, Black Dandyism is a cultural practice in a form of self-expression where black individuals, particularly men Sure. Got to use fashion and personal style as a tool for resistance, identity negotiation and the challenging societal norms.


It's just not about dressing well, but also about using satirical choices to assert agency, reclaim narratives and push back against negative stereotypes. Exactly. And limit limitations. Exactly. Reclaiming the narrative is the, the origin point. And then the fact that they continue to do it. So my my point was it kind of resembles a little Jack and Jill, you know what Jack and Jill? Yeah. Right. And I guess maybe it's in line, you know what Jack and Jill is, right? Yeah, yeah. Rebellion Jack and Jill is like stereotype Jack and Jill is like a, a, a wealthy black organization and they have cotillions and balls and such. And so that's what I attributed it to. You know what I'm saying? As opposed to something haunting.


I looked at it like it was a, a almost an ode to that. Yeah. That's how I say black Songs. I mean maybe I, maybe I still got sinners on the brain, maybe where I'm thinking about like, you know, just like the historical context of what we watched. You know? I feel you. I feel Yeah. That I, I guess I just still have sins on that. I Think that's the beauty of it, right? Yeah. Like, you know, we, We got it's art and it's up to interpretation. Yeah, For sure. Yeah. And we, and we, to me it just reminded me all those moments of black people who thought history got fly when we could. Because a lot of times what happens after slavery, they were saying, why are these black people spending their money on clothes? Exactly. And it was like, well, because before when we were enslaved, we couldn't wear what we wanted. Right. Today. Now we can't today. So they like, why they, why would they buy these parasols? That was one of the big, why would they wear parasols? It is because white women were wearing them and we had to take care of these white women. And now we can dress ourselves, use our money for our thing.


And we got fired, but we looked way flat than they ever did. And so when I saw last night, that's what it reminded me of. S like a re a rebellion against stereotypes. So, you know, that's what Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And a couple, a lot of people like couples, it was their date night. So they dressed similarly. Like, Just real quick, Just real quick. I know, I know, I know. I see. If So, 'cause we can't make that all that slavery dandyism point and just move on to couples. I don't think I, I understand what you're saying, But most people having watched the Met Gala throughout the years, it's white as shit. Yeah, I Was about to say That too. Like, it's another one of those events where shit, in years past, it's felt haunting for me.


Looking at how white It is. What some of the old fashioned houses stood for and how they parade out black entertainers as if we're do and pony. So I'm I'm with you there this year. I didn't tend to didn didn't feel like doing the deepest of dives. It felt great that that shit was Ultra black. Yes. Extra black. It looked great. Everywhere you turn, beautiful, black, glowing, glistening skin, lathered skin, hair, herring, the extra pieces niggas was on they coming to America bag. Yeah. On this day, everywhere you turn, it was just black people looking beautiful.


The choir I thought was a great touch. Me too. I felt like somebody asked the black person, Hey, what should we do here to make this extra black? Go get a fucking choir and have them sing. Wave in the water. Listen, we've seen pictures in the past, not a lot, but we've seen pictures of some of the food they, they have eaten in the Met Gala This year was the first year it felt like Collard Greens was in there. Yeah. This year is the very first year where it felt like, oh shit, them niggas is going to eat Turkey wings and fucking just mad black food. Yeah. Like that was great. Yeah. People, people that are, and, and The food was from Right Rooster?


No. Wasn't it Chef Kwame? I don't know if Chef Kwame. Chef Kwame. I thought it looked great too. I Think he was the chef. I could be wrong about that. Ti Let's go. So turn it Up. Tiana mention that. That's Some so lie. Come on man. I could be mistaken. I would've thought Melba was in there. Chefing it up. Chef Kwame. Perfect choice. Hey. And eh, That's where I was on Saturday. Sorry.

Look at the Met Gala. Yeah. However, as much as I love fear, God, It is one of my favorite brands. I'm not certain that I would show up to the Met Gala if fear God asked me. Because I'm not showing up in this environment with this aesthetic. This aesthetic fits you more than it fits me. Well, I guess it depends on what the theme would be. I thought Tom Brown had a night too, by the way. He did. Oh yeah. Tom Brown is Janelle Monet. Tom Brown was that One.

So who, who A chapel Rone dope guard Cleaned up at the Grammys. She and she had that and had that really great speech. She just, she's mad colorful. And she said she looked a mess. She didn't really look a mess just, it just didn't seem like on brand, on theme whatsoever. Just looked like a continuation of what she consistently wears for her stage performances and stuff like that. So I just wasn't impressed with her. If we're talking about people who just didn't do the theme, but maybe looked amazing.


I'm Sydnee Sweeney. I don't know. She, she looked great. The big, she got the big dough eyes and the nice boots. The and shit like that little white girl. Yeah. Beautiful dress. You know, beautiful gowns. As you know, Aretha Franklin would've said, but I don't see a, another white person that just pro just thought mis athe. Let's wear black. Yeah. Yeah. That's, That's what came from that. She did. She just wore black. Okay. That Slow down. No, she didn didn't, I didn't like it. She didn't just wear black. That was custom Chrome hearts. Fair, fair, fair. It was a statement on, in that environment to wear custom chrome hearts. You like the car, San Diego hat her, her accessories? I love the hat. I think so.


I'm not gonna say I necessarily love the look. 'cause I'm not a big chrome Harts guy. But I love that Kim is always the one to make a statement like Lady Gaga used to do at the fucking, like, I like the celebrity, the make a statement. Celebrity Kim should try something different. She's one of, I just didn't Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah. She should try something different because she has been doing that silhouette look forever and ever and ever. It is tired.

You did turn it up a notch. I was like, damn. Not really. I didn't, I didn't like that outfit either, but, oh, that's not true. I'm, I can't critique without it being personal. But do y'all have a history is all I'm asking. I wouldn't say that. Yeah. That's not enough. Have you ever met? Yes. Have you ever been in the same party?

You know the tfl I do flip. I'm not gonna let him say it because he always fucks it up. So Times what happened? Kim Kardashian told the lady that invited you there. She, she tell the story. Tell the story. Okay. The first time this story was told was on my old podcast, I'm here for the food and I never wanted to say it. There's way more millions listening now let's get to it. But I don do that.

It's super, it's about 7 million out there now. You sure you wanna reshare it? Yeah. Man. You know, I am thinking, No, give it to it to us. Okay. This was in 2011. The, I believe it was 2011 the year after that massive earthquake. Earthquake. Okay. So humanitarian efforts, a lot of people going over to Haiti. And I was, I was invited to go and I was there with Marcia Dyson. Mm. Marcia Okay. Shout Marcia. Marcia was like my, you know, like my, like a surrogate mom to me.


You know, very protective of me. And this was maybe like a few weeks after she had annulled her marriage to, what was that boy's name? Chris Hump. Hump Humphrey Hump. Right. That 72 minute marriage. Right. And it's so, it's Hate, it's hate. Go Ahead. It's not, it's just a fact. It's just a fact. So what happens when you But That's not a fact. It was more than 10. It was it bad Stephanie, two days, D days, something like that. Okay. Okay. Anyways, so she was catching a lot of like flack for that. And so what happens is a lot of celebrities go into crisis management during that time. And so crisis management oftentimes looks like charity and humanitarian missions and shit like that.


So she ended up in Haiti and I ended up in Haiti. And why were we there? We were putting on a Christmas party for children from six orphanages. I also went down because I was working with this company called B Condoms, the only black owned condom company. And I brought like, no, I'm gonna take all that Get get That to you. It Was the black owned Con girl. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Anyways, so we met Fucking sneak a little ad in there. She sneak girl We, because it was part of why I went down there as well. We got that. Okay. So we met and she was, she was cool. That was, you know, hi, nice to meet you, whatever. And then her mom went over to Marcia Dyson and she said, yeah, Kim's uncomfortable with Melyssa being here.


Can you send her home? And Marcia was like, sure. That might be your daughter. No the fuck she did not. She was like, that might be your daughter. But that's my daughter. She's not fucking going anywhere. They Let You Stay In Haiti. You said it like she was Steve. Like she, I wasn't there for her. I was there for the, I was there for the children. Didn't let you stand. That was, that was why I was there. So Wait, did you, did you go on a plane and just chill for a little bit? Did you try to act like you wasn't did No, she, in the Four Seasons Port of Prince, did she, did you go to the She's a whole lot of soccer that we in. And here's the thing, shame be one orphan. Here's the thing is, I don't necessarily know if that was in fact true. If that's why, if, if she was in fact uncomfortable.


But that is what she said to Marcia. Marcia relayed this story on my podcast. It was, it was, it was just Did y ask, why did you ask why? What were you wearing? Mm. You don't ask those questions to a lady. What was she wearing? Hmm? What Was she wearing? Ohoh. It had nothing to do with what We were wearing. Exactly. What were you wearing? I mean, did you have it on? I had on like a lovely summer dress. Oh yeah. You got yo go outta Haiti please. We were, we now We were around. Dig Mary, You Hey.

Well all the Kardashians let you stay in Haiti. Whatever, whatever. Wasn't it nice to you after that? We didn't have any other contact. Of course. There. I reiterate. So you Were blacklisted. I reiterate she was whitelist was there for the kids. That was why I was there. And to bring, you know, In a nice dress to put on, you know the decorate? Well, no, this was the, there was like multiple things going on. So we were like at a dinner with dignitaries and shit like that. Okay.


Go ahead. Go Ahead. We jogging the memories And Girl short. Alright, Mel, this is my question to you though. Go. You, In the event that the Kardashians wanted to kick you outta Haiti and then wore Chrome heart dress to the Met Gala, you would be able to say if that looked great, even though she wanted you nowhere around in Haiti, right? You're that type of objective. Yeah, I think that she's had amazing outfits. Okay. In the past, before Haiti? No, I'm just in general. Like other Met gala appearances that she's made. Okay. I think she looked great. This particular outfit, take her out of the outfit.


Put somebody else in it. I have the same criticism. All right, here's a question for you. You talking about body. Here's a question for you. Why do you think the bitches always say that about you? Like, why do you think they'd be wanting to Get her outta here? What do you be doing? Why, why do you think they wanting to clear you like That girl? I don't know. I mean, like, I Oh You be you. I mean, listen, let me tell you something's you, you nice, the bitch's husbands. There's, there's no, there's, Hey Chris, get out. There is no, Hey, hey Dway. Gabrielle, kick your ass. Don't don't even Start. Don't even, don't even start those narratives. I'm sorry. That's nasty. That is nasty. That's nasty. I take that back. Back. That's nasty. But you're extremely nice to people. Yes, But I am, I am a very nice person.


Person. You Are. But Just, but let me just make this clear. I could not, I just don't even understand like how woman, another woman could let you know that you have her shook like that. Like I could never do that. Like, the way that these ventures be letting me knowing I got you shook. That's weird. Oh, now you're shooting at Ken. That's, I know. Not Her. Not her. You. So, but I mean, like, if it don't Let it Apply. Right? If it doesn't apply, let it fly. But that, does that make you feel good that people may feel intimidated when you're there? I, to be honest, I feel fucking uncomfortable. Okay. I feel fucking uncomfortable because it's weird. It's weird behavior. Fucking get yourself together. Oh, okay.

I I, I don't think he'st, I'll tell you why It is announcement on Instagram. He even said like, this was initially supposed to be titled the worst rap album ever.


'cause there's no bars on it. So, so he was preparing to audience say, look, there's no bars. Don't expect any bars. I don Title the worst rap album ever is what he Said. Right. That's what he was going to title it back then. But he held onto it and decided to put it out. Now that Wasn't been trolling. Had he done that, I think that would've definitely been trolling. But I think he decided not to do that and just put it out. I, I think it's more just the arrogance of an artist that thinks that no matter what their thoughts are, no matter what they do, we we want them like that. And the world's entitled to hear 'em. Like, I don't, this sounded like I remember being a high school band. Yeah. And we would just, you know, we'd mess around and make little songs. That's what it sounded like. The, the level of keyboard playing. No, man, This shit sounded like when I got the one, the keyboard when I was eight, like Cassio, I was just Yeah. The little Cass Caio shit that you could make it be the drums if you want you, you switch the instruments on it and you just start fucking around.


You'd have no idea what you're doing or ya It was bad. It that was was real. There was a couple good chords there. And I, I feel like this was him learning how to play piano in real time and just release it to people. No, this was him before he decided to learn how to play piano. Nah, this is like, he learned a couple chords from someone and it was like, all right, I can put this together and sort of did. But it was, it's bad. Like the dynamics, like he's hitting shit too hard. Yeah. He didn't, doesn't know how to play the piano. How to play the piano and the cover knows minimally how to play the piano. And I wouldn't be mad if he took this and was like, Hey person that is really good at piano. This is my idea. Can you make it good? And that might work. But him doing it, bro. Yeah. The one song that didn't suck was the one where there more they, they all suck.


Yes. The ones, the song that sucked the least was the one that had the organ, I think it was track six or so. It had like the organ playing blueberry Mansion or some shit. Yeah. Number. It had some mansions, had some other things going on with it. Nah. And I still didn't like it. And then the one chord, the one sort of chord progression that sounded good was just super derivative of, of of a very famous jazz stem that's escaping me right now. But it just, it just wasn't good. I've never seen an artist put out something where they're just bad at the instrument. Yeah. And say, Hey, watch me play this instrument. Badly, badly, badly. Yeah. For 15, it's only 15, 16 minutes. The whole album, It was the worst 15 minutes of music. I've said down a long time. I listened to it for hour. Just do it on the drive up here. 'cause I was like, it's only 16 minutes. Yeah. And I hated every, like, I, I played it again hoping it would get better.


Yeah. I didn never play this again. I'm never playing this again. Ever. Oh my God. Man. Never. I hate all these Niggas. Why? Why? I'm going back to what I said dice at, at this point, if you're buying these projects from Andre 3000 expecting good music, I think you bring that a point Yourself. Oh, time out. I just, I ain't pay for this. Okay. He don't get a purchase. He ain't, he's off that list. I need to hear this and say, oh shit, he gave me something. Let me go support and buy that. My What? But still what I'm saying is this, y'all are having a blast unpacking Sonic how of It is. Right. And great. I didn't buy the flute album and I won't be listening to this. So I can't, flute album was fine.


I can't join that. The Flute, I didn't hate the flute. The flute album wasn't, I won't buy another one. The flute album. He, he earned my, my respect enough didn didn't like it felt like I was getting a massage. Yeah. But at least it was solid music. You know what I mean? But part Of art for me has to be the messaging and the intent behind it and, and what it symbolizes. And I think in mu music is the only place where we condense art to just say, Hey, it sounds good, sounds bad. It's trashy. I don't know how that shit sounds. 'cause I don't wake up on the re and put flutes and pianos on. So I ain't about to break my, I'm not about to break tradi the, the tradition doing that with him. However, I think that he is, this is back to my point in our Patreon combo with his album and how it wasn't no rap on it.


I think he's one of the artiest of the artsy for sure. Absolutely. And I think that now more than ever, we should be encouraging artists. You may not agree with how he did it, but we should be encouraging artists to not only do what's near and dear to their heart, but also to find a value in it. I Will say this right. What what it made me think of was, hey, it's at least nice to hear humanity. It's not heavily quantized, it's reprogram. No. On the piano shit that we just listened Jay and all of that shit. Yeah. It's, This is definitively not ai. And that part I like. Yeah, It is definitely not ai Ai but it's Fucking bad. AI couldn't do that. To your point.


Yes. And artists, we, we do want artists to ex explore and, and put, put their art out. But art is also subjective. So I could go to a museum and a artist who bust they ass painting that right there. I could still look at that and say, Hey, I don't like that. Yeah. And that's, and I'm entitled to that as, as a Consumer. And nothing in nothing in what I'm saying is trying to strip you of that. Right. So I don't, I don't want you to reply to that. I think anybody who's trashing him should trash him. I'm all, I'm just saying what if he finds who he's looking for? What if As a patron have At it, whatever It is that he's searching for and putting out these very eclectic abstract projects. Right. I Don they think it's that. Deep said, that's good for him if he does that.


They said, I'm not mad at that album. They said the flu album, the whole entire album was at like 400 and something megahertz or 432 Hertz, 440 Hertz, something like that. Which has been quote unquote proven to have certain healing principles and healing power. So if that's his bag and that's where he's in, then the flute shit might have had a purpose for Him. So you believe that, but you don't believe the Kendrick people looking into lyrics and shit If the, the, the flute people, if it's moving at a certain megahertz, then that could be proven. I don't know if that was his intent. And again, I'm not, That sounds, that sounds, I'm not saying that that is it. I'm saying that intent intentional i's what people are saying. But if that is the entire album is really operating on that frequency, then that might have been his purpose in his fan base.


I think that that was intentional with the flutes. But with the piano and his outfit, it's like the cart before the horse kind of thing. I feel like the release of this album was simply just To prepare y'all for this to To Yeah, exactly. The Cover is that, I mean Exactly. The Cover is literally him with the sketch of the same shit. He wore the Macow 'cause and also look at the timing. Yeah. You know what I mean? Of course. Like that's that's exactly Said wanna say he has over 25 years of being intentional. True. And highly You don't, you don't know him to not be true, intentional. True. All True, true. But this is still intent. But not for the purpose of you. So that we know. We don't know. We may Purpose.


I'm just saying can't. What I'm saying is don't no, I, the consumer can say whatever they want that we, one thing doesn't negate the other. I keep saying that like shit on them. But the music business today will do everything they can to keep you confined. Yeah. Or in a for sure. Or in a box. They'll incentivize you, they'll pay you, they'll bring your friends along or take you to a game to give you a card. They fucking want you off your feet so you can stay in the box. So the very few times did we find somebody that's gonna say, you know what, nah, I'm gonna do what I want. I find value in that. Agree. I'm not, I agree with not gonna knock the nigga for that. And as a rapper, you know how frightening It is for a rapper to think, I can speak to this, yo, you know what, I'm never gonna rap again.


Or I'm just not gonna rap at the clip I used to rap. I'm gonna put, I'm gonna take the thing I know how to do best on the planet and put it on the back burner that's provided for me and my family. Now find something else dog that is so bold and fucking courageous that It is like at that point, why do we care what the retired firefighter is doing with his time? If that nigga finds solace and being in the garage and sewing and selling it on Facebook. Yep. Who are we to fucking say, yo, that's trash. That's, and and my thought is, I'm say It Is trash to not art. I got you. And, and I get what you're saying. Right. That shit's trash. I think for me it's that Andre has 25 years of being intentional. That's 25 years of putting a high quality art. Right. Whether it's visual art, whether it's the cartoons where everything he does is high quality.


So I had a, a faith in him with the flu. Do that would be high quality. Flu do wasn't for me. Was it not, I didn't listen to it. The Flu do was high quality. That's what it was. High quality. It was high quality. It just wasn't for me. That's different. Right. It's high quality just wasn't for me. This is the departure for me. Not because it's not for me, but because it's actually not good art. It's not Good. I don't really think that it's a departure though. I think in my interpretation, you know, because, you know, art is subjective. I think that this was literally being treated as an accessory to his fucking outfit. See that? Because, because Oh Interesting. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Good job. He had it for 10, 11 years and never did shit all with it. Except Text it to his F Friends Said it's, yeah, exactly. It's only 15, 16 minutes long.


It's unfinished. Whatever. But he happens to release it around the exact same time that the Met Gala comes out and he has this outfit. I just, I'm looking at this as simply just an accessory to the outfit. There's a really, really weird accessory Then it's, then I would, nah, I think that's super fly and artsy again. Yes, yes, yes. If that's what's happening. Yes. Unless it sucks. Unless it's a Bad brace, it's bad earrings. I'm not Yeah, exactly. Right. But I mean Its thing, it's put on a beret. Well Be clear. The outfit also kind of sucks. So it's consistent. You Know, I have a different reference for Andre. I love and Andre's Creative Of all time. Andre, I think we all up here love Andre. But the love Don't mean we can't say, Hey, we love You.


But That ain't it. No, that's true. That's all I'm saying. However, know that the person you're talking about every step of his career since the beginning has been people saying, Hey, whatever you're doing is not it right now. Joe, What do you, what are you, what are you not good at? Name something you're not good at. It's math S not a math album. Okay. Right. So like if you said, look, I I'm retiring from rap 'cause I'm not going to do rap anymore. I'm gonna do something else. You podcast it, you're great at this. Like the shell method and the disc method. Right. I think podcasting is the perfect example. I just don't want to fucking take it there right this second. But It is the perfect example. Yo, I'm gonna not rhyme. I'm not, I'm not gonna produce high quality art. I'm gonna just talk.


Yeah. But but you but you, it's a little, that's a little different because in your rhyming you were still expressing yourself. You were talking, you're a Communicator. You were just doing it rhyming and on beat. You still Talking. I'm only talking about from the POV of the person that has to make the change. Right. But Right. But I'm saying as the consumer of that change, if you decided to say, I'm gonna now make, I'm gonna start web, web streaming math, math tutoring sessions and all your math problems are wrong and all your equations are off, it's different. As a consumer, I'm like, yo, that's, this is what I, this is what I expect. It is not a perfect comparison. My point is just, I like, I like the comparison. It's bad. And stay here for a second. I don't like it. It's a bad comparison because, 'cause you could prove the math. You could prove the math to be correct or Incorrect.


But I'm gonna talk. Oh, Lemme respond to 'em. Yeah. Lemme respond to it. 'cause I like it. Leave those things. I like those things that y'all trying to take out. I went and started a math club and all of my math was wrong. Yeah. And bad and sloppy and defied all of the things that math, yada yada, yada, yada, yada yada. I then go to a mass following of 10 million people, let's call it year one. Not only are they going to come up with a new name for my math, but this bad math is about to be a thing now because I've amassed this audience.


So who is it on me? This, why is it on, why would it be on a person to say, well we shouldn't start that person. So fear-based, we shouldn't start that person with, Hey, everything you about to do is wrong, so you shouldn't do it. Right. And I'm not at the should level. I'm, I'm saying it as a consumer because I, I I take what I It is just saying seriously. Right. You right. It's not a good comparison. 'cause it, there's an objectivity to whether math is right or wrong. But what I'm saying is, as a consumer, I have a right to say, look, I expected great things from you 'cause you've given me great shit. True. And, and now this is shit. That's all I'm saying. And when I hear the flute album, I'm like, this isn't for me. It's great. It's just not for me. When I hear the piano, I'm like, this is actually technically, it's not quite math objective, but this is technically bad piano playing. I can Also just say It is someone who produces music and who is not a world class musician, who works with other people that are not a world class musician.


It's okay to say, Hey, I have this idea. I can't fully execute it. Let me get someone who does. Right. And that's only, he can't, I think that's fine. He's still a composer. It could still be his album, but it's someone that is really good at piano. Or at least better than him executing his idea. Like, Yo, like yo, if HOV Tomorrow put out a album and it's him singing all singing, no Auto tune, none of that shit. But he's singing and he just sounds bad. He can't sing, he can't hold a note or nothing. It ain't gonna take away from ho's greatness. But we gonna be like, yo, my nigga this don't ever sing again. Don't s like, like we can't tell him that a thing. Probably gonna buy that shit. I don't want to hear you sing it anymore. And I would be like, objectively you're off key. Yeah. Like there are things about technically that are just off for me.


Wait. And I'm saying y'all should totally be able to say that for sure. Just leave some space for the people that who wanna support that, wanna see how HOV distributed this album, what his intent was behind this album. Because if HOV put out a album farting on his, on his title shit. Yeah. 'cause he just closed the deal with Roger Goodell. 'cause he knew something was coming down the pipeline. And now on all commercials Then, Then I'm gonna say was genius. He's a genius. He put beans on the, so all what I'm saying is allow space for the people. We, I don't know what Andre's intention here was, but he's been a I'm genius.


I'm say a little bit more to that. He's been a genius as long as I've known him, so I'm just allowing space for it. And if not that's fair. We could call him a duck. No, he's still a genius. Even with this album and the flute album, it's still genius. Shit. We just don't gotta like it. That's why I, I'm not trying to Genius. Lemme ask. Yeah, no, I'm Offa Me that. But lemme ask you something. If, if, if back in the day, if you were great friends with Al Al Einstein, right? And then I'm leaving this, 'cause now I'm just coming up with shit. Sounds nuts to you. If you was best friends with Al Einstein, sounds Ridiculous. Sounds nuts to you. Yeah. But you know him to be the genius. But let's say he gotta get a hangover one day and now he just started talking something that sound like gibberish.


It don't, it don't sound like himself. Would you discount it or would you still listen? I would listen. Why? Because he's earned that cachet with me. He's earned that. He got that equity with me by being such a genius that I know him to be. Same thing with Andre. We run to listen. Soon as the shit dropped press play. He's, Andre is an immediate cop. Well, immediate Listen, I ain't paying for it. But once you hear it, it's like, oh, all right my nigga, you on bullshit. You just doing whatever you want. Yeah. You doing what you wanna do? Okay, cool. This wasn't for me. Respect. I think There's, there's some people think need more artists that do whatever, some people are. I agree with that. Think need more artists. Do. Some people who may not like what he's doing.


I, I end with, I think we need more artists that do whatever the fuck. I think we all agree on it. The freedom to do whatever the fuck Here is, is disagreeing with that. We all want to do that. But you ain't never getting your Rihanna album, nigga. Take them flutes and pianos and enjoy it. You're never getting Rihanna. We want more people to do what they want to do. But at the same time, if it's still, we want people to do it and equality still be good. That's it. That's a good, some People are invested in the art freeze. That's It. Is art. A thousand people be a Hundred thousand people. There May be a hundred thousand people that love, love this Andre album. What Scripts do y'all live by? What, what, what scripts do y'all live by? What does that, what do you mean by scripts? You mean quotes? No. Oh, just what, what, what script for me.


If I had to say it's probably only my mom and my girl outside of that, I'm on my own fucking time. Whose script are you living out? Nobody's, nobody's On my own. That being said, I will listen to someone around me and I feel like someone around him must have said, Hey bro, What you doing? That's all. Yo, what's this? I Don't understand. Maybe you could try like, do it now that you're a better musician or something. That would've been interesting to me too. To hear what, what he played, what he sounded like. Now he Probably ain't play it to nobody. And just, yo, this is what I wanna do. He said I sent it to his friends on the text. That's that's why I, that's why I'm, I really lean into this was an accessory to the outfit and know and, and who's ever used music as an accessory to an outfit.


Lemme give you, Hold on, lemme give you a quick example. You were recording mood music four. I remember this. I walked in the crib you were writing to inception. I walked in the kitchen and I heard you going. You was talking out loud while he's writing. Yo, let's warm it up microwave shit about to get hot summer. I said, what the fuck you doing? Because that's not you. You're too good of a rapper to do that. You was like, yo, don't worry about it. I'm doing something with this. You'll get it cool. So you could hear something that's not the person. Ask them what they doing and they just say, yo, I got this. Like you said, Andre could have told them, yo, this is just something to accompany, accompany my outfit. Don't worry about it. I got it. And you let 'em cook.


Yeah. Don't charge me fat. Quick question beyond Andre, You say something slick to this, to this nigga with the funny flutes and pianos. He gonna bar you to death. I'm just telling you. Well, Maybe whatever you take it to give him to rap. Yeah. I'll take I'll take that. I'll take, I'll take it. Bar me up please. And I'm a fan. Y'all selfish fiend. If, if y'all, if y'all could do something completely outside of what y'all do in your life to take a risk, what would it be like? You know what I mean? Like I I I sometimes think about like writing a book of poems or doing, You know what I mean? Like, you know, you think about some shit that's just complete outside of your wheelhouse that you would do to take that kind of risk. What, what would it be For you? I'm gonna be honest with you, this was a risk for me. 'cause I hated cameras. I, I never was a fan of none of that shit. And he was, I hated attention. Ugly. I hated cameras And all that. I still got though. And I still got him though. Mm. Well that's facts. Mm. Okay.


We gonna put a couple things to bed though. Say do that big freeze, But Come on big bro. But yeah, like that was a risk. That was a, I liked the tension. Never liked cameras and all that shit. So this was a risk. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. It makes sense. It makes sense. And he was ugly as hell. Yeah, he was. No, he was blowing ants. Offa Me the microphone. No, he was though. He was. That ain't stop nothing though. You saying? But everybody Else could answer. Everybody else could answer the question though. Let's keep a conversation. Phil Wood it be film, Answer film. Like on onscreen or at, no, I don't know actually. I'm not sure. Something in visual arts though. Like film though. Photography Or speaking Visual arts. You didn't mention Jeff Golum.


Sure. Oh Yeah. He looked Good. We used at film. I had a Jeff Go. I was, I was cooking Clean. Clean. She clean. Jeff Muffin. That's wash your dishes. That's A pet. 72 dishes. That's A, that's a good one. Wash your dishes, shout him out. Nah, Still the s Not he's a smooth dude though. That's the level of smooth. You can only hope to aspire to get at 72 years old his feet. But he's been way for a long time. Yeah, he was floating. He's always been that way. So swab and de. I want to answer Mark's question. That was a good question For me.


It would be gaming and anime. Huh? That's so far outside my realm. I know nothing about it. It looks cool. It's intimidating to me. Nah, you know what you know About that. Yeah. You know a lot about gaming. You know, ain't Fool it up. I mean, I've been in video games, I've been characters in video games. But I mean like, you know that market, What You was in like Grand Theft? Def Jams, A couple of them, but Def Jam was one and then another one. I can't fucking You tried to steal your thunder bro. My boss. That was crazy. That was crazy. But yeah, that was, that would, that would be what what I would do that I would you flip probably dancing.


Hmm. Yeah. Twinkle Toes. Yeah, I can See that. Any particular genre of style? Ballet? Yeah, the waltz. The waltz. He like, he like that old school shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's True. You never thought about dancing with the Stars? Nah. No. Would you do it? I would really Like the wrestling shit. Oh see What about the wrestling shit? Oh, wrestling. Oh, nothing. I don't understand the comparison. Saying wrestling was something you said you wanted to do early on and then because of fear, you quit and was scared to put the work in your Door. But did, did you listen to your white counterpart? Did he tell you that? No. Because that's what you like to do. You like to listen to the white man?


Oh shit, I don. So that's not what it was. You know, that's not what it was allowed you. No, I didn't allow, I was comfortable with the narrative being put out, but that's not what it was. He had an idea. I didn't ask you to clear it up. Oh Yeah. I, alright. I cleared up on, I cleared up on, on Twitter when they started talking, they flipped. So she said if they brought the mask dancer back, what character would you be? Barney? I'll be Barney. Yeah. I mean, you know, listen this shit Just To continue to take risks. He threw that right away too. That was great. Just to continue to take You thought about that. You thought about that. He thought about that. I'll go back to comedy.


That's funny. It's comedy for me. That's a good one. On stage. Stand up On stand up. Stand up. Traveling the world back to touring Chitlin circuit. I can that, that's interesting. Comedy. I'd be able to say all the things that I wanna say on here, but I don't because they would attribute to me Every time you think about, it's a big Aris though. 'cause you don't pay the audience to laugh. Mm. You know what I'm saying? Like it's scary when you go out there. Have you ever done like a standup Set? No. You thought about it? It's I've, I've, I've never done a standup set, but I've like just warmed up crowds, you know? 'cause I've hosted comedy shows that shit. The moment you tell a joke that nobody laugh at that shit crumbles just like getting punched in the chest. Okay.


But hold up now when I say comedy, I don't necessarily want to be good every night. Interesting. You can't be, you can't. I would Love, I would love to stand there in a tank And go out there and bomb. Bomb Have to have to fight Bomb bomb and work through a bomb to, to improve. That's the real shit. Build character. I wanna see how it makes me feel. I would wanna stand in the tank. I don't just want to be Mr. Perfect. Whatever shit Is That's so you almost don't do it, Joe, but do it as like pre. Yeah. He talked about For so many years I didn Go to one of Little local comedy joints and just Why? Yeah, why do you I algebra ask that. Why, why every time You think it, you stop. Like even with that or got raw material or DJing and you know, getting on DJing the front of the crowd.


Like why do you stop? Why don't you do it Plenty of times you talk about doing these things and you haven't done it. You be a great dj. You be a great Yeah, we say that all the time. I, I don't know, but Sometimes. Oh shit. No, no, no. That's not enough. Oh, you think sometimes the music you hear in your head, they responding to it. Same thing with comedy. You gotta be able to get through that. When you throwing some shit on that you think you jamming and they like ain't, nah, this ain't it. Yeah. Yeah. It don't necessarily mean because you can play music well, don't mean you can DJ well and mc a Play. True. I just think you're comfortable. That's True. You gotta be a risk taker. You think you're too old to take risk? No, I just think in the answer mark's question, that's something that I would want to do if, like, if I was calling the shots not living by a certain script.


But to answer your question, why I don't do it right now. I'm a bitch. Nigga. Don't, don't take this shit out. Listen buddy, are you dumb? I'm sorry I don't have time to stop what I'm on right now and go, go to follow my heart. Yo. It is money or passion.


I'm just playing. I'm not at the point in life where I'm living. For me, Let's Experiment and do this over here. If I was living for me, let's go have at it. Sobs we back. But What's your answer? S what would you Anything public speaking related. Wait, what? You tried that already though? That's what, that's Not really about that. But don't you already do that though? No, I Don't do that much. Y'all so dumb man. Well, When, Why Y'all can't let him share Be vulnerable before y'all come. No, just I know what he's saying. He's saying like a pub, like a, like a motivational speaker, like a public speaker, like a, like standing up in front of large crowd speaking is hard. But Isn't that why you went to the dr. That's, that didn't S not need It is clarity.


That's not why any man listen on this cover story. Yo, just so y'all know, this is not the DR broadcast. Yeah, it's not Dr. It is, It is Dr. Just Dr. Here It is Dr. Okay. I sorry. Not the D the Dominican. Yeah. Yeah, please Dr. But yeah, I mean like, that's what I thought that was, it was like a whole con con convention conference that you were speaking at. I don't like that you stuck on Con that long. No, No. I'm, I'm being, I'm being serious. Like feel Like you do. He should be a public speaker. Don't Do that. No, that's what I'm saying. It's, it's, I feel like it's already in his wheelhouse. I Feel like we were Yeah, he's good at, he's good at speaking to motivating people. I don't saying I feel like we Were talking about things, things that were like that so far removed from like who you are.


Like My nigga. I don't know what to tell you. I answered like, I don't know what to tell you. You like okay, I say poems, you know, I actually thinking might well be something physical actually. 'cause poems ain't that far. It's Too late. I've already started thinking of what a Mark Martin Hill poem book would sound like. Sorry, that's going to happen. So you know the pyramid and the scheme. But I didn't scheme when I built the pyramid. Yeah. Nah, he About to get off. But I see you in the eyes of the come on by the body. A poem book. Go ahead, mark. Yeah, Like that. I think you'll do it.

I'm confused, but, Okay. Many years ago, I hate I be trying to protect y'all from yourselves was You mentioned, you mentioned Rasheed Wallace. You wanna talk basketball players and Paul Pierce.


Oh, we can do that. Alright. Paul Pierce has a, trying to get outta that. Paul Paul Pierce has a clip floating around. I I sent it to Parks. You got it? I do. Okay. Where he's, he's speaking on marriage and who my favorite everybody's thoughts on it. That's My favorite. You know what I'm saying? Like, because I feel like every relationship should, shouldn't be based Offa Me sex. But every relationship is based Offa Me. That that's what I don't think so. 100%. You can't tell me nothing different. This is what I feel and that's why I'll never be in another relationship. 'cause it's always based Offa Me that. So you're not gonna be in another relationship. You No. No. For what? Because it's gonna be based Offa Me sex. Once that wear down, you gonna go find somebody else that's better. Wear down. That's Yeah.


That ain't gonna be based Offa Me. Listen, listen the thing and listen carefully. I'm listen carefully. Listen. Relationships. Losing A smoker jacket. Lemme say what marriage is and who's marriage for marriage is for old people and poor people. Okay. So let's get into that. And why? Because when you broke our parents, like my moms and all them, they, they married on a marriage of like, okay, we gonna put our incomes together, have all these kids. And then with our kids, we're gonna have five, 10 kids back in the sixties, all them, they gonna have five, 10 kids so they can work and bring income. Yeah. So you poor.


So you married for that. And now when you get old, somebody got to beat by your side to take care of her. Right now my, my mom got married. My mom never been married in my lifetime. She got married when she was 70. Wow. It was perfect. She asked somebody by her side the whole way through. So do you I really believe that It is worse than I thought Outside of that. It is no advantage to a man. Why is marriage advantage? What advantage? What what, what, what, what, what does it do for a man when things go south? Like we gonna have to give up half our this pave child support pay. But what do the, When does he stop talking To a woman? He's almost, we could stop it.


It's Real talk. But what if you meet A, I don't know. We shit, I want to hear more. Yo, he drunk Paul Pierce is one of my favorite people to listen to. Not saying he was drunk here, but he sounded, you know, he said than he read it. But I think he put that out. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. He, I want to let the audience know and I'm toing to ball to y'all. I wanna let y'all know Paul Pierce is on the list for me of people that I don't listen to one word that they have to say unless he's talking about basketball. Even though He, if he's not talking ba I wanna hear him and Kevin Gardner. I wanna hear that basketball shit. He's one of the greats. Can't take that away from him. Anything outside of that scope. He's on the list for me. He sounds like he's speaking through trauma. That's what he sounds like he's being, first of all, let's go through the statistics about men down.


Oh, first of all, he married men are healthier than their single counterparts. That's just a fact. That's just a fact. I've definitely heard that. Okay. And there's a reason for that because their wives take care of them. Whenever you guys, oh sorry. Your wives do your wives insignificant. Others do a lot for you. You know, they do a lot of the emotional labor. They do, they do a lot. Just hold on, don't it cook. They do a lot of stuff, but they also make sure that you go to the doctor when shit is fucked up because they need you. So married men are take, are taken care of by their wives. So they're healthier than their single counterparts. That's number one. Number two, in terms of marriage being for fucking poor people, the majority of CEOs of fortune 500 companies, almost every single president, millionaires, multimillionaires, billionaires, 95% of them are married.


Why? Because that indicates stability amongst a whole host of other fucking things. So there you've got that fucking wrong taxes To your point. Yes. Yeah. Taxes. It, it's mutually beneficial to be married rather than being a single person. I can speak to that. Yes. And then furthermore, your reality is fucking skewed. You've never been married, you've been living in a bubble. Your reality is completely is not the norm. So if you are associating marriage with just sex that you know, the desire dries out and then the woman is just gonna take you for half your worth and your, your and and sue you for child support. Well you are, you sound mad, bitter actually. Like that's a really, really skewed way of looking at love and companionship.


That's, that's fucking wild to me. I'm with you. Yeah. So I will defer to the gentleman in the room to To the married people. Make your points room and the married people in the room. I'll de refer to the married people in the room. Yes, absolutely. I mean I do, I do agree with Mel. Stability is I is important. Taxes, understanding. Somebody did. Why you keep saying that? 'cause you got married young, you didn't have money when you got married. That's not true. You had money when you got married. I did. I had a Tmobile. I had a T-Mobile deal. So I did get married but I spent the Who woke up? Who woke up? Look who woke up laugh at my expense. Keep going. Look who woke up. Fuck that. Fuck outta here nigga.


You had this I didn sidekick deal. I did. Look man, look, look, look, look, look at nigga's man. Look, look at the hate Had a T-Mobile deal hating you nigga. I'm hating. You did need to protect on T. He said he made 70 grand from his T-Mobile deal. You need to protect the funds from the T-Mobile deal from you at at. Okay. Your wife would've been looking at you like the lick. Actually I wasn't, I wasn't married yet. But at 20 years old bro. $70,000 at 20. And when I was 20 it was a lot. I didn bullshit with it, but it was a lot for me. Yeah, it was. It was shortlived. I bought two watches like an idiot Gucci car In a Gucci cat. In the Gucci Gucci cat. No, no, no. That was before. Thank you not listen.


Reparations list. Oh yeah. Right. I'll fuck up. No worry. Skipping. Skipping your house. You talking about my family? No, I'm talking about y'all not on the reparations list. Because what we could, because We on that list. I'm sorry I on list. You're not, I'm not writing list. I gotta you I don't have that much power. You report me. Look, it's a find out amount. Money for sure, for sure. We gotta bust that down. I got to, lemme ask a question. Honestly, if you found out your man was on the list, but he was, we gotta split this money. Was he, if he he was Caribbean descent, would you really report it? Yes. We got to split this money. Are you you taking money from black people nigga?


Yeah. You take away. Are you crazy nigga? I'm down with you. No, no, no. Ain down down then you Jamaican. But that's only you have We gotta, we got nigga that was me, Joe King. I don't care what's mama's side of the money? So man, that was funny. Oh, oh man. Please stop. Freeze. Okay, all Are you finished with your points because we're moving around the Room? Oh yeah, Yeah man. Yes. I'm finished with my point.


I'm just saying like marriage taxes. It is taxes. Taxes. But not only taxes though. But I do agree with Mel, like your wife takes on a lot of responsibilities. Like it makes you more comfortable as a man for you to go outside and get to it and provide. But she's doing a lot of the inner stuff in the home that you don't realize it's a lot and there'll be a strain on you if, if she wasn't around a lot of things. And Also discipline. Yeah, discipline and also discipline. Yeah. Like I have, like I have bills. They take care of a lot of shit that you may tend to forget. Focus. Yes. You know, removing like you all the distractions of the streets so you can focus and like become a better version. Oh you be Outside and be a hoe. Go go cook some carrot chicken. You can be outside and be while I go outside and put some have no fucking dick discipline and shit.


Go ahead. I mean if that's the life you aspire to live, I mean hey whatever float your fucking boat Nigga. You watch your fucking Yo you marriage does take a different type of discipline. That's why I'm deferring to the married people. I want to hear from y'all. Yeah. But the discipline it take to look at somebody in the face, like every day they face, you ever just see the shape of I Don every day ain good face date either they look a little different. Right. Every day they face like Shape Shit. Like, yo bitch, look at your, you gotta stand at you until one of us die. Okay, Mark. It is a beautiful thing though. This is what I say. He, Paul Pierce said a couple things though. First he said like, mar relationships take marriage off the table. He just said relationships are about sex.


I just think that's not true. Sex are a big part of relationship. Romantic relationships ain't the only thing. He's Speaking through his arrested development. And that's What I'm saying, like there's plenty of people even I even know niggas that cheat, that be, that have a great healthy sort of friendship with their partner and, and sex is somewhere else. So what I'm saying like sex ain't always the thing that keeps you in a relationship. You know what I mean? Right. There's lots of things that keep in relationships other than sex. In fact. Yeah. Like you could actually like the person. Yeah. Like around don't, like these Niggas don't like women. These niggas don't like women, not these niggas in the room. But these niggas that we talking about, they don't like women, they just wanna sleep with them. But in terms of liking them and seeing value in them, they don't do that. That sounds like what you're talking about. Yeah. That is what it sounds like.


That's how he sounds that that's, that's how he Sounds, that's how he sounds to, I mean, I I just don't think, I mean my, my wife I, I just speak No, what the fuck, what? Don't get I'm on male side. I agree. Watch your step buddy too. You're encroaching in my territory. Whoa. Wait, hold on. Don't even try it. No, keep Going Mark. No, no. Keep going to be clear up nigga. We were talking about the It is not our three boy. No, no, not Mel. We're talking about the discourse of feminism. I just want you to clean it up my nigga. Thank you. Because You're gonna get back to that motherfucking shit. Yeah. All We have to have it. Boy, I was telling Joe was playfully in using the language of feminism.


I was saying that's my table. We No, no, we know. But now that you said that, now That you said that we gotta make, I gotta make It clear. I'm trying to hold you down. Look out. That was not holding me down. That was holding you down in the tunnel. Right. Under the water. Right. No, but so I I I disagree with that point. There is an interesting thing he said that I think we have to be sort of critical of or honest about marriage historically has been about money and it ha marriage was really a, a contract. It was about ownership. It was a business arrangement. Right. For sure. And men were giving their daughters to other men and that's why we gave Dowries and land and all this. I mean it was a business arrangement. So I don't wanna pretend that that history doesn't exist. But I think there's lots of reasons to get married other than security or safety or money.


I'm not saying people don't, there's good reasons to get married. Having somebody with you, you know, having a better financial situation, you're, you're stronger financially if there's two of y'all making an income. All that is true. But there's really good reasons to be married. And I didn't know this until I was married. Even being with my wife before we were married, living with her before we were married, I still find greater value in the marriage. You know what I mean? Like I actually enjoy being married and if your wife, if your partner is your best friend, if it's somebody you really fuck with, marriage, not that shit is a whole other level of joy. When you get to be home with that, don't mean they don't get on your nerves. Don't mean all the other shit is true. But like, I wouldn't trade it for anything. And I think a lot of married men I know wouldn't trade it for, I don't wanna say most, but a lot of married men I know wouldn't trade it for anything. That's all I would say. Agreed. I think that, I think that we've kind of discussed all the reasons why marriage is good, but I also do think that there are people that maybe shouldn't get married.


Absolutely. Maybe he's one of those people. Yeah, absolutely. Like if you still wanna run around and do shit, you probably shouldn't be married. Well I think that when I meet people that make a lot of money, have been with someone for a really long time and aren't married for some principal reason, I think that that's a little foolish because of the tax benefits, because of the security blanket of being married. There's a bunch of reasons to be married if you make a lot of money, especially if you are committed single or committed to a single person. That being said, if you wanna run around and fuck a bunch of people, you probably shouldn't be married. Well my my thing just about Unless You, unless You had That arrangement. But What I was saying to his point, he's saying, you know, you get, you break up, she take half everything. You can protect yourself against that. That's true too. Yeah. Like you act like it's this or that.


You could always structure your marriage however you see fit, get a prenup, whatever you need written in there and now you're protected. So those things you sitting here complaining about won't happen to you. Exactly. Oh yeah. Get that little cheating clause outta there. Infidelity claw. Crazy. Are you crazy girl? Lemme get this straight. Try to sneak it in there and come fuck one little incy girl, you get to take it off. But I, I don't think only Mary, I'm Joking right now by the way, because my girl be listening. I'm joking. Married people shouldn't be the only people weighing in on this Paul Pierce not even married. I mean like what, what do Joe and never has been. Right Joe Ish. What do y'all think about this? I Couldn't agree more with with UML.


Like I, it's Paul Pierce talking. I'm not paying him no mind, but I can't wait to be married. I cannot wait to get married just for the structure of it. My girl just helps me to be palatable. She helps in my word decision making. We better, we find the same shit funny. We enjoy the same music, we enjoy the same shows. Her skin is soft. If that changes, we'll reevaluate. But like there's lotions. I, I love Yeah, I love i I love all that shit. I'm with that Shit. I have a friend who, you know, was, she met her husband and he was a playboy, but the Sun Rosen set on the cracker of her ass a according to him, and they ended up getting married.


He was a playboy. He was out in the streets and he was get, he, he was doing very well for himself, you know, very well since they've been married. The structure and discipline and just everything involved in and and, and her support and love. He recently just sold his company for like almost a hundred million fucking dollars. I don't necessarily know, I can't, I'm not a fortune teller, but with the way that he conducted himself and just had girlfriend after girlfriend, after girlfriend, a girlfriend. And then what he ended up with having a structured relationship with somebody who loved and cherished him and he felt the same way back. And she raising their kids and stuff like that. I don't see him getting to that point without her.


You know, and that's just saying like, just when it's, when It is a good marriage and It is a good partnership with people who like and love each other, that that is, that's the kind of thing that it affords you to become like the man that you can become. I wanna Also add, by the way, growth, Evolution and the last, However, let's call it two years. We have seen some amazing, prominent, rich, powerful wealthy single men get absolutely destroyed by running around the streets doing whatever the fuck they want to. I good Point. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree with that. Good point. Is there anyone here that has an opposing opinion on this? On what? On what He said on on his book. We on the We on the mayor topic.


I think, I think, I don't oppose what anybody's saying. I think Paul Pierce is just speaking from a skewed perspective based on his career and his experiences though. So I don't necessarily think that if he was an accountant he would feel that Way. You know what the problem is he ain't get with them Cape Verdeans, he was over there for fucking Yes he did. That nigga was in Boston a long time. That nigga what he got with them, he might be the, I don't know if he did Prime minister of Cape Verde. Fuck you talking about. That nigga was in Boston forever. I don if he did, there's some other shit in Boston. He might have been around Jo Jojo. And then if you was in Boston, that don't mean you was with the Cape Verdean. If they came across as palate, you had a choice. No, they came across and that might not be his bad, some of his views.


Listen, when that nigga was on SN or wherever he was playing poker, I was in Boston for two days and in my prime I found a few kick ver Nigga, nigga, nigga. What? Yeah. Y'all, y'all, y'all don't know if that's what make his tea hot. Yeah, he might not be. That might not, that might not did it. They killing one of these athlete dudes now because they caught 'em in Vegas on the, on the, on the party bus and they let like 20 white girls out. Two of them it was, it was two cam from, from the Saints cam Jordan. And I forget Tyler, I tell you it was Cam and somebody else. It don't matter. We just in a funny place where you can't even let the white girls out there. Party, party bus. Trey Murphy, Murphy, Trey Murphy, Murphy, Trey, Trey Murphy, Trey Troy, he nice Too.


Troy Murphy was nice. Trey Murphy nice too. He wasn't better than Troy. Yes he is. He wasn't better than Rey Murphy. I'm telling you Joe Rey Murphy's a big white Boy. I know he is nigga he went to Know the name now Tre Murphy's real nice. Trey Murphy's tough. Rey Murphy's real nice. But I just think that his, his view is just skewed based on his experiences. Like when them niggas been rich at a young age, they might think every girl in the world want they money and then they looking at girls as sexual conquest or sexual toys. And so now you bla placing everything on a sexual relationship. And if you look at women like in in that light, I don't expect you to understand none of this marriage shit. Exactly. Right. Or want to be married. Exactly. Because didn't you get that from anywhere, anytime, any place without having, If you looking at him and the other side is Yeah, and the other side, he said his moms was never married, so I didn't even see it in my household.


That Was also because Mom did get married. So she was 70 that never saw it coming up. And now I'm out here on my own. I'm rich like you said, like that's The part that I thought was Sick. Yeah, no that's not true. That's the part that I thought Was sick. That's huge. In, in in, in our demo especially. Absolutely. That's really, really big. Biggest thing is normal to single motherhood is really, really big. And so we don't necessarily see the importance of marriages because we've never been around a marriage or just a fruitful man and woman. Healthy relationship. Yeah, I was about to say not even marriage, not All of us. Well that's why I'm saying it's sick. You don't know why? Because had he had a conversation with his mom and asked him and asked her, you know, what would you have preferred struggling as a single mom raising us on our fucking own?


Or would you have preferred to be in a loving marriage with a supportive partner who could raise us together? I think she would've gone with the ladder Has nothing to do with what, what he saw as a boy growing up. I Under I understand that. I've never had that conversation with my mother. Me Neither. He's He's single kid, parent kid. He is never had that conversation. That's I'm saying mother. What I'm saying is it would behoove him to have had that Conversation to ask that question. I'm if you 45 and 50 and 55, we talking about like adult, adult real adult people now I, I think that you too old for the, hey, this is what I saw growing up. So these are my views. At some point you have to come up with your own fucking views. True. I'm not disagreeing with you, however what I'm saying so to Say, but wait, let me finish.


So to say that you pleased with your mom being alone or not finding the one that she deemed appropriate for marriage until 70 years old is sick. If you spoke to your, Didn't he? He didn't pleased he said it's not what he said, but what he's saying is she didn't get married to 70, which is why he's saying it's for old people. She got married to have somebody by her side to ride it out is what he was saying. So that's what he was saying. He's like, oh, so for me, marriage just means, so he may not feel like nobody at this Time. Comprehension is great. Do you think I'm I'm under the guise of his mother. I'm with Mel. His mother may have wanted some company before she was 70 years old. Absolutely. I Think companionship is human And, and if you recognize that then your mom not be married till 70 shouldn't reinforce your thinking of marriage is only for old people.


But it should say the opposite. I see what you're saying. It should say the exact opposite. And if your mom met a nigga that she felt appropriate for marriage and he was in the house a little more or around you was a little more, you would no telling how that would affect your thinking today. Agree. That's What we saying. I just think at 1555 that's, That's exactly what we're saying. Yeah. We're saying that if he grew up with a man and a woman in a household and his mother had a man, it would've affected his outlook on relationships to how he sees the, let me finish Joe, but What we're suring me finish please. It is different. So what I no, we're really not because if he had been a, he had a man in his household, his whole outlook and his whole view on relationships could potentially be different.


He looks at it that way based on the environment he grew up in an environment he was introduced to at 17, 18 years old, which is being an all American athlete. Y'all repeating and all of the things that come along with that. Y'all are repeating everything I said. If you, if you I said it first then how do you get to Yes. Marriage is only for old people. It's All, it's almost, I'm sorry, that's what I'm asking. Let me just say this and then you, and then you clear it up. It, it's almost like he said, he stated it to say she waited until she was 70 with intention to wait rather than that was a desire that he never knew she had maybe the majority of her life and it never happened for her. And I mean, my views on this, I've had this talk with my mom, I've spoken to my mom about marriage, the lack of marriage when you was married, how you felt about it getting older without somebody wanting somebody to be there.


I've had these talks. I don't think that nobody is signing their mom up to fucking live life a certain way. And then at 70 at your later years meet somebody and then yada yada yada. And, and we gonna paint that It is the fucking party city that ain't party city. If you witness that, then why the fuck would you get on a platform talking like it's party city? I just don't understand that part. If y'all do, that's great. I disagree with the nigga. So I I think yeah, I don it's crazy. I don I disagree with him too, but I I understand why he may think like that. Can I ask y'all something? Why Have, why, Why haven't, or why wouldn't you have that conversation with your mom? I have my, Do y'all got the kinda moms gonna have that conversation? My mom don't talk about stuff. Yeah, Me and my mom talk about a lot of shit, but I don't need to have, I mean if you're able to I'm not No, No.


I'm saying some pa parents, dumb women don't like to talk about their, I mean in the sense of like, my mom don't talk about bad experiences. She don't talk about love Life. I just, I don't even need the conversation. Sex is A rumor. Yeah. Personally, I don't need it. I saw it. I was there. Mm, I saw, I saw my mom's being with the wrong person and this is what she will say to this day. Like, my mom's not married now and she, my mother was married for 20 years to the wrong person and eventually got divorced and she's like, now I value my peace over anything else. I would much rather be alone than go through what I went through before with the wrong person. So I get that. That's real. But I watched the struggle going, But I think there, So it's like I I I see I don't have to even tell the shit. Even that right there, even that right there, there's a value in that.


So let's just say ice, hypothetically watched his mother be married to the wrong man for 20, 30 years. Ice could be dead set against marriage based on just viewing. That's everything in all of our environment shape how we see the world. That is true. That's A possibility for him. It's true. But but, but to Joe's point, but but to Joe's point, when you are an adult, adult, adult, 40, 45, 50, you now have the responsibility to challenge those long held beliefs and maybe go to therapy to kind of like fix the way you're thinking. And the reason why I said something about him having a conversation with his mom is because I know something about this. I, it took me a long time to see my mom outside of just being my mother res, you know, just like unconditionally love me, I'm your child.


And that's how I saw the relationship. I never bothered to ask the woman any questions about who she was outside of me until it was almost too late. And that's something that I always encourage people to do and it would behoove him to have that conversation with his mom because it might change his skewed view right now. Like that's the the point that I'm making. Unless her, unless, unless his mom was Paul Pierce's mom was just happy all those 30, 40 years. You know what I mean? She could have been, Mr. Earl could have been coming by down laying pipe and can you put your Yeah, yeah. Like she could, she could have had a great life experience and just decide. But part of that is because he's rich. Yeah. Wham like, Like she and frankly she don't need a 70-year-old man a marriage right now 70 to be taken care of.


No, you might it now. You might need it now. You might need it now because the money doesn't play as big of a part in your life. That's true when you start to get older. But when you 50 60 running around, my son got a hundred, $200 million. I might not need the things that, or the securities that a, a marriage bring Marriage that's Yeah. His whole to that point, his whole, his whole understanding is skewed by a whole bunch of stuff that's not replicable like true. Nobody. Very few people are gonna have his life and his opportunity and his access. And I, so I hope men, a bunch of men don't follow His men and Paul Pierce might just be un marryable. That's possible. Yeah. Could Be that like the same way we talk about women that are of certain age that may have missed the boat 'cause it was too many options or they was playing around and why won't blind for men, this nigga might have been un marryable for the peak, the prime years of him where some of the women he wanted didn't want him 'cause he was on fuck shit.


Some of that fuck shit. You could still hear true in his verbiage. Yep. And, and and the good women are outta here. So now you just left, he stuck with this like Mel said, the fucking, what, what did you call it earlier? The feast of the, the whatever you call it. Some nasty shit out there in the, in the single streets. The dumpster fire. Oh the dumpster fire. The dumpster fire. And if and if you there then yes, these are your views. But tell us, yo these are my views because I'm stuck out here in a dumpster fire and I didn't find nobody to sort of value in me and I refuse to do the work so somebody would find the value in me. Say that that could be true. Very much so. Word. I mean it's under, It is, It is understood that there is going to be a certain better though there's a certain type. I'm not disagreeing with you. I just, I'm not disagreeing with any of that.


Oh, I I I believe all of that to be true. And again, I'm, I'm just basing it on the environment that this guy grew up in. Nigga I'm rich, I'm living in Boston. I'm the man in Boston is mad single bad chicks in Boston. I don't wanna settle down with none of them 'cause I'm selfish and I'm running around. Rich Niggas gotta stop doing that. That shit is lonely, dark, Sad. And guess when you realize that Dangerous, depressing, dangerous, dangerous word. Risky road. Most nights, most nights. I'm not talking about the night that you went to the club and Vanessa del Rio was in there with a free cousin and they both sucked your dick all night long.


I'm not talking about the night that you went out and had the time. The that's the tiniest of times. No, I'm just saying when I think about my single days, Four nights a week, five nights a week, you in the house by yourself and when you come home from the club, the club be cool and when you come home from the club until that next It is lonely. Especially if you got some money, It is lonely. Yeah. Nigga, that next day you just sitting in the house doing nothing 'cause you're self-employed until nine o'clock at night and know when nine o'clock at night come nigga start hitting your phone. Yo, what you doing yo such and such popping on Wednesday, da da and you repeat the cycle, nigga we used to be in greenhouse four and five nights a week. You just be repeating the cycle. I'm not saying that. I'm telling you that the environment And in in, in repeating of the cycle because it gets deep.


At some point you niggas with money go home and you have everything you want there and that high is going now. True. There is nothing that you could go out and buy that you didn't buy that you didn't purchase. So now that euphoric feeling gotta come from doing something nice for somebody else. That was what Will Smith said a couple months ago when he was like, yo, I I I bought everything I could buy. True. So now He smoked that interview and I agree with everything that He said he is. So now you have to find out how to be happy internally. True. Yeah. And a lot of niggas don't even wanna look inside. They can't look in the mirror, let alone Look inside. You know how many times in my single days when I had a couple dollars to spare, you just wanted to buy a fly pair of boots for a lady, but there was no lady because bro, You single thinking about yo, you, you, you, I would, you see, see a banging ass location come across your thing.


You know I'm a travel dude, so you single, you see this dope ass location and you like, damn, I wonder who I could go there with. I wonder somebody I could take there with not no jump off bitch that I'm just fucking somebody that I like and I want to spend time, time serious experience my nigga. When you go on vacations, I don't know about everybody else. When you go on vacations, it separates who you like from who you like. You in that room for six days, seven days, four days, whatever the fucking duration of time is you sitting in that room. It ain't no she gotta go home. You don't have no time off from this girl. You ain't going to work tomorrow. Y'all in this room for four days by yourself, 24 7 y'all. And if you don't like this bitch and you just looking at her like a piece of ass, that shit is whack. That shit gonna wear off quick.


Ain't no sunset. You don't care about no sunset with Keisha. Tie your backyard dusty. That's all. You know what I'm saying? You done nut it as much as you could. Nut. Yeah. And at some point, pardon me, at some point, your, your brain and your eyes could fuck more than you can. Too. True indeed. A thousand percent. Thousand percent. But good luck to Paul Pierce. Whatever works. Listen, I'm in my, to each its own era in life. I'm trying my best not to judge most of y'all out there. Whatever y'all want, do totally fine with me. Everybody gotta do what's best for them for sure. With their brief time on earth, whatever that is, that makes you happy. Judging Is fun. I love the judge. I like a good job. You know? That's what another thing a wife is good for. Yes.


All your judge shit. What? You know what I'm judging right now, please. Lars Pip. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm not judging Lars Pippen. I'm judging dude. About You late. You late on this Jeff Kobe? I, yes. I'm I'm judging him. Why You judging? Who The dude is? Ming Lars Pippen. Who? Jeff Kobe. Jeff Kobe. He's a, that's her new boyfriend. Shocked to old former basketball player. No. Who announced that? They're they're getting married in November. Okay. Tell me more why you, why you feel bad for Jeff. Kobe found the person he loved. I have So when I could be wrong, when people demonstrate a certain pattern, Oh yeah, you're wrong. Go ahead. I might be, I might be. I'm open to this.


I want you to tell me how I am. Lar Pippen seems like somebody who's there for the moment. She seems like an opportunist and she seems like she's obsessed with young basketball players. I don't see this lasting and I feel like for some, and I don't get what draws a 30 year. What's he 30? He's 31. 31. 31. A 31-year-old man today again, And she's 50. Do what you want. If you wanna marry a 50-year-old woman, that's fine. It's not, It is not her age. It's the fact that she's got a pattern and a type and she seems like an opportunist to me. And I could be wrong. Do you think opportunists don't get married? Yeah, they do. They do. I'm just saying I'm, I'm, I'm judging them because I'm like, bro, you don't see this. You don't see the play. You know what I mean? I watch her get married, I watch her do the reality shows. Like she, It is like she's making money off the marriages, off the relationships.


And what makes you think that he doesn't see the play? Oh, He might. That's what I was gonna say. Well, that he might see the play, the Play school. Me. That's what I'm saying. Some nigga see the play and just be hype with the shit. Some niggas know the play, see the play and fuck it. All right. I'm here for the ride too. Yeah. Okay. That's a good, that's a good Perspective. And if, if he know that and is signing up for that, then yeah, you're not a victim. You a volunteer at that point. That's, That's a great point. I I always, I assume everybody's being earnest, so I always How do you, How do you, how do you feel about Brittany Renner and Kevin Gate's marriage or alleged marriage? I haven't thought about it. I, I'm fascinated by it. Think about it. I'm fascinated by it. I Wanna see if, if, if there are parallels for you. I think the difference, and again, I could be wrong. She's been on the internet, there's a pattern of behavior, But she seems to have interrupted her pattern and made like a very very, yeah.


A very like stark like, look, I'm changing my life. I'm going to be somebody else Against Lamont Hill Again. I could be wrong. I'm just saying I I'm a sucker. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm starting by saying I believe people will be Earnest and, and, and, and she may, I'm not saying I'm not calling a name saying that that's not true. Yeah. I'm saying that most times when these women get married, they've shown that to the person that they're marrying. Not to say that it's true or not. Like whatever Brittany showed Kevin Gates, as far as I'm turning my life around, I'm willing to adopt this new yada yada, yada, yada. I don't know what Larson Pitkin Lars the same thing in this, in this guy's ear. She might be saying, I'm gonna turn my life over to God now. And I, and I'm not saying it's about Brittany Renner, 'cause I don't know this to be true about her, but sometimes also women look at that clock like She's, Again, I'm not saying she's older or anything, but they start to realize, yo, it's all like what I was doing, being the it girl.


Yeah. That time might have passed me a little bit. It's a whole new crop out there that's, that's running around it. So it's, it's almost settled downtime. Let me find something that a little bit more stable now. I can't run the life that I used to or I get to that point. Like Joe was just talking about where I am, quote unquote an un marryable because I bullshitted all this time and now I don't Nobody wanna take me serious. You've convinced me. Yeah. You convinced me to give to to, to not be so skeptical. That's fair. Yeah. And thank God there's, there's plenty of women that there, there, there's plenty of women that find their identity in whatever their role is in their partner's life. Mm. Also, so, right.


Like, who am I to say that Brittany is on bullshit. She met somebody, this is his belief system and his religion and yada yada yada. She's rocking with that. Niggas can't come and say, listen for weeks now I've been wanting to come and talk about all the, I can't talk about it, but the new women that are turning in faith and covering up and just, it's a lot, it's a lot of being converted. Oh, Didn didn't. I didn't know that. It is. Oh yeah. So It is a wave. It is a wave happening currently. What do you do? The wave is, and I but who am converted To Islam? Yes. Dope. Women that Live That life. It's outside. Who am I to come say, there's nothing I can say.


I think that's At some, you can say at some point you look at yourself in the mirror every day, mark and you and you wanna change. Yeah. You wanna change it, whether It is converting or just following God, you change your life. Some of 'em just look at it like, yo, what I been doing ain't working. It ain't like if you keep doing the same thing over and over, get the same results. She like, yo no, it Work not, It's not, it's not working for the long term for what they want. No, it may not work internally, but it may work. I mean, I Instant gratification is a thing. Yeah. Until it stops. Until, Until It stops. Until you get 77 pocketbook. Until you have every car that you could drive. Yes. Until you've been to every restaurant. Until you have all of these material items. And none of that shit's when you go home at night and lay down on that pillow makes you happy. You still feel empty inside.


So now I gotta look for something different. And I agree with you on that because there's a lot, a lot Of people that's who make you feel better, the post office nigga that you shitted on for the last 30 years. I agree with you. There's Some people that, that I know personally, but Larson got her a baller that that Hasn't, he ain't, he ain't that go look at his career. He, he, his her net worth might be higher as Probably is. I mean, especially with Yeah. Is he a current player? Former. Former. Okay. Played Overseas and shit like that. Oh yeah, no, yeah. No. I mean he, he ain't no Scotty Pippin or, or Michael Jordan once removed. But I, i i, I think for me part of it might just be my reality show meter. You know what I mean? When I, when when I'm around her, I just read her, I, I read everything as a setup for something else. But what they were saying when you worked out was like, there's also the possibility he's in on it.


That he's not a sucker but he's, that he's going with the play too. Like maybe he knows exactly what he's walking into and he's okay with it. And if that's the case, Yeah, go for it. Come on. Could be chill. Chill man. It could be. You can't do that. You can't do that to Larson is I just, Larson rubbed me the wrong way man. Oh yeah, me too. That's All. But as a man, she Might be rubbing them the Right way as a, as a man. She probably is Every, every day on the internet as a man. You have to find the restraint to not do that. Right. Yeah. Like Do What? Too many of us know too many women. What's that though, for year, what Marcus just did with, with Larissa, like I'm saying on the internet, the skepticism, you gonna see oh To, You gonna see the lady that you knew for the last was 25, 20, 15, 10 years.


And you know, her Carfax just based Offa Me how she been moving out there. And then one day she gonna bump into a nigga and they gonna profess their love and be married. You have to fight the urge to say, damn nigga, like you marrying that this bitch done been in the street. Done fuck him. That's true. You can't like, we Can't, you know why niggas, you know why niggas don't though? Because, and Then you learn that niggas don't care it either. Well not just that, But we've seen what happens when that goes separate ways and she's right back to what she was doing. Two things. But I'm just saying it's almost a slide Evaluat. Yeah. You still, you still that. Yeah. You can't do that. It's Like just put on pause for a minute. Like If you see a slide fell in love or getting married or Yeah.


You gotta just kind of wish him the best. Yeah. Maybe She can't, can't rain on anybody's parade. If she Married a dude from the post office to use example, like I would probably be more inclined to be like, oh, okay, she's, she's Settling. I mean she might have a physical type though. That's true. Her physical type could be tall. Athletic building I think is always find empathy when she's dating a nigga from the post office Because it seems more genuine. But to who? To the masses. The people that are judging And the message for anybody out there is not to live your life based on what the masses think about it. Mm, true. Yeah. I think that's fair. Yeah. Yeah. Especially when it come to your love. Who fills, who fills you up?


Who make you feel good? Who's sucking your dick? Who's rubbing you down? Massaging the CCBD oil, all that good shit. Yeah. Mind your business. I don't give a fuck what you think. Hey, like I used to say to niggas back in the day long, long, long, long time ago. Hey, hey nigga, if you had it and you see me with it, nigga, you should be a plug. Hey, you know what I'm going to do? I'm having a slice and if you still watching, I assume that you had a slice too. I miss that slice. If you still watching, you miss that slice. That's the part. If you still watching, you miss that slice. So don't come tell me. Oh yo. She used to be in the halfies, yo. She used to be behind the dumpster with rah rah. Guess what? I cleaned all that up. Hey, I hose it down.


I put that thing right in the dog bath. Little Purell. Come on now. Light song. Got the got the dog. Hey, I said that thing to the hair salon, the nail salon. The the grease. The refurbished pussy salon and every other salon I could find cat daddy. That is a rescue dog. Now don't even look Daddy aint same. It should be a little different. Yeah, different hairstyle. I don't know that dog. Different fabric breed rescue Dogs be loyal to Come on now. They hated where they was at. They hated that last home. Come on now. Nasty. Any who's nasty? That's nasty. Nasty. I don't care. That's nasty. I don't care nigga. I don't say rescue dog nigga, but yeah, well, you know what I'm saying. Not a rescue dog. Clean up, clean it up.


I'm just trying to help rescue bitches. Yeah. You know, we know though Rescue, they usually meet niggas like you and you clean them up and they end up, I I clean them up nigga. Yeah. Do they end up going back to the other nigga? Oh, I don't know. I don't keep tabs when I'm done. Oh, you don't care about that. I don't care what you do when I'm done, done. It is done, done. And you asked me about a life I don't even remember man. I've been my girl six years. I'm only looking forward. I'm only looking forward. I don't even remember these times that we speak about. These are the times we all wish for. I don't remember. I'm sorry. And that's what I respect about you. Holy man. That's why I respect about this room. No, for real. Everybody here. I don't know if I could do this pod with a bunch of single   Seriously.


Come on man. We not doing this serious. Yeah, I know. God damnit. Anyway, alright, moving on. So which of our Newark residents is is gonna tell us about this Newark airport? Shit, I was just looking it up. It is freeze. I mean It is. I mean we, we talked about it a little bit but This shit is bad. Nah, It's expanded since we talked about it as much before. It was just like, oh it's just fucked up over there. No, the New York Times Wrote article on it. That's It just went, went public. That's All. No, not, it just went public When we spoke about it, there was construction and that was it. I I didn believe that I said it wasn't, I said that that wasn't construction. I said that from the rip it wasn't construction because the construction is easily Remedied. Alright. Be clear there is construction.


True. Okay. But that ain't the reason for the shit. That's my back. That might be what they telling y'all is the reason for this shit. You got ah my nigga. If you own one of the biggest or most important, not biggest, but one of the most important airports in the country, international airports add that in the country or maybe in the nation. To Isis point my nigga, if construction is your issue, you have on the clock niggas working around the construction issue to remedy it, right? Yeah. LAX has been under construction for God knows how long and it has not stopped. You know their Flight, I was flying out, they told us, yo, it's only one lane open Y y'all are number 39. It, my plane was leaving at six, nigga I left at almost nine O'clock. That's not construction. That's that's not construction.


That's Short staffed. Yo, y'all. And so a lot of the staffing issues they're saying because they said that the FAA that regulates Newark is out Philly. Didn't they just fire a whole bunch of didn't There you go. Trump cut everything. There You go. Trump. Yeah, you're Cousin. So that's, that's Be clear. So so they said it's a combination of things. I think nobody really has the balls to blame it on him. Yeah, that's what I really think. I think nobody has the balls to blame it on their administration for fear of losing their job pushback or being found out. And so now they're blaming it on a multitude of things. Construction, layoffs, et cetera, et cetera. Fair. If it's only one lane open in the airport, that's scary bro. I left, I left on one day they hit us with the one one lane situation.


Back planes though. They're talking about one, excuse me, not one lane. One runway. Yeah. Runway. To accommodate, to accommodate all flights incoming and outgoing. One runway. Oh I didn't know that. For an international, for for Newark International Airport. I didn't know that. That's already crazy. That's insane. But what was interesting to me is on the return they told us we were delayed because of an issue at Newark. But they never said it was because of construction. They said it's windy, it's windy, it's wind conditions. So, so when I so if it's, if it's, it seems like you're given a bunch of different reasons bullshit to just say something or anything that is anything applicable at the time. So two weeks ago, three weeks ago I went to Virginia.


That Monday I was coming home. They said it was the rain. Right. So they postponed my flight. I flew out Tuesday morning, I came straight to the park. Remember remember that boom this Sunday when I was leaving they said it was the wind to ISIS point. They said it was windy in New Jersey. Okay. Right. I'm like yo my nigga, it's been windy since we was kids. Right. Like what the fuck are we talking about? So is it the, the, the elements, is it construction? My flight was leaving Sunday. This Sunday. It was supposed to be at six 20. The second I returned the car got to the gate. They said nine 40 while I'm sitting there and negotiating. They said, 'cause I was trying to find another airline. They said 1105. Yeah.


I took my dumb ass downstairs, got me another renter car and drove home all the way home. That flight did leave at 1105 and it got to something after 11. It got here at like one o'clock, which means the runways cleared up. It ain't get less windy. The runway's cleared up which allowed for more traffic to come through and that's really what Happened. And not only that, they're also diverting flights to, to other areas. Like some people who are supposed to Newark land, They're saying about Newark LaGuardia now. Yeah but some Exactly. I encourage anybody listening if you can avoid EWR Newark Airport till the end of June. mid-June is when they said come on. They said Corey, They said July. Huh? They said July. They said yeah they was in July.


The middle of July. Man if you Could have voted Jersey Whenever and just do it. Yo Mark watch fuck crazy fucking store. The trains don't work. You get Shank in the fucking train station man. You be at the train station. You know the fucking, the Penn station. No you said you go all the time. This nigga act like Philly as fucking guns and rainbows And roses.

They hose it down. Yeah. LaGuardia LA you can even shopping that motherfuckering now Donald. But LaGuardia and JFK are really nice. Well JK always pretty good for me. I just don't like the distance for JF K one of them shit JFK before I'll go to Philly first. JFK before they redid it, I remember they just redid it first and then LaGuardia took ages for them to redo and then they did red redo some of newer 'cause shame. The Newark is going Through this. It Is amazing. Is gorgeous. Well neither one of them fucking airports better than Newark.


That's not true. Newark, you got hours to shop 'cause your plane ain't never gonna leave. So you get a whole meal and Shit. I got JFK is a much better airport than Newark. It is a much better airport than Newark. Yep. It got better shops by far. By far. Everything about JFK is better than Newark. I fought that shit one time. It's Just far. I don't know. I just don't go. So I'm not going there. I like I said, I'll go to Newark Camp and Newark. Newark is the United Hub. You can't even catch, you can't even catch some of the fly flights from, from Newark. Exactly. Jersey. Shit. You like, Shit, I'm not doing this too anymore. United is the hub. Atlanta got like Delta, You know what I mean? Philly got America. Y'all got United. Come on. There's S that a government thing. Don't put that on us. No, I'm waiting to hear the problem with this. Yeah, I don't understand the problem.


I like the, I like the United A of city location. You got connect and shit mean. It is fine. It's a fine airport. I just find living in Jersey, y'all like the armpit of the East Coast coast. If you Had to pick up, if you had to pick a saying United, well he might be troll. I'm dead at, I'm dead. I would take Delta. If I had to pick a, You would definitely take Delta. You would probably take a a couple more before you said United as your preferred hub. Yeah. Why that's y Yeah. But then again I'm, I'm, I'm United y'all Level. Yeah, I'm united all day. I like United too. That's on brand for you. Yep. Sure. Shocked about him. Yeah. Yeah. You know that means No, you talking about me? No, you said me. No. Oh, you talking, you said that's on Brand for now, but you got some of that Aisha in you too. So both of y'all now I Don't know what that means.


What else? Speaking of shit that trump's fucking up for the country. Does anybody have any thoughts or insight on this movie? Tariff, foreign movie Tariff Here. Fuck. Why Donald Trump send us in the World War? He's gonna put a hundred percent tariff on all foreign movies because Hollywood is struggling. That's what he said. And we supposed to be making our own movies and we watching other people's movies and they bringing their movies into the country and nigga this shit is on. Like what? Help me, help me understand. Do we watch that many of other people's? I I I'm not a movie. No, it's not that. He's talking about filming. He's talking about filming outside of the country. Oh, that's true. I I see what you mean. Like, like Centers was filmed in Canada, right? Or Australia, excuse me.


Was it same place? Yeah. Yeah. Australia. It might As well be. I ain't Know. Yeah, I don only because at the end of the credit I remember looking and being like, oh shit, that shit wasn't this, you know, because It is cheaper, it's easier. Yeah, I guess. I mean, got a point. I just don't know if that's the right solution. I tend to just, it's not my default is to say that ain't the right answer, but I don't know. It is not the right solution. It's just All you gonna do is make movie ticket prices go up. There's also just like certain like shit that you can't find in America.

Yeah. I don't fuck with him. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's it. That's it. He's just trying to punish the people that just don't fuck with him and have never, you know, invited him into the fold. I Think he's just waking up in the mornings seeing some shit. Shit being Like, I think he trying to make, I think he just keep trying to make distractions to go against from the real shit he's lacking Cru, which is real policy crumbling. Yeah. And we gonna make a diversion. We're gonna throw something up in the air, make it blow up, it's gonna distract the people and we not really doing the work that needs to be done beneath the scenes. Well did you, since we, since we Talking back to the Escape.

He's talking about getting rid of Section eight and saying that they're gonna put a cap for able-bodied adults to two years. Okay. Seriously? Yeah. You gonna get rid of section eight at the same time. Half of the country, not half of the country, but a a a large portion of the country are losing their employment. Yeah. How's that work? And we, and we at record house prices. How's that work for the economy that you're gonna rescue? Oh, he doesn't give a fuck. I think it goes right back to what you said. He's just, he just sending signals to his base. Distract. He just talk this, this is the real killer paid for anybody.


No. Yo, but, but this is a real killer. A huge part of Donald Trump's base is section eight. Yeah. We keep looking at it like, yo, it's just a liberal outside states. No, a lot of Donald Trump's base in the inner America, they poor white people. Yes, but they're S that are on section eight, my nigga. So when you drop Section eight, what happens to them now? Billy in the trailer, he Fucked up. Yo dog. What are we talking about? It's gonna backfire my nigga. And they don't got jobs out there. This nigga is crazy. What am I saying? That's wrong. Can't do that. Hey flip. Fuck you talking about? You sound good. You sound good boy.


What? Yeah, Yo. Oh look, please. No one here has a Thunderbolt review. I saw it and I hated it. And they killed You saw the movie? Yeah, I saw it. Oh, I didn't know It's not Thunderbolts. It's The new Avengers St. Straw Ice. It's the new I know they changed the billboards. That's That's what they're doing. That's part of their Marketing. Can't But that's not the name of the movie now, right? Well the movie was all, It is all part of the marketing. The movie was always Thunderbolts. If you ever looked at how Asterix next to it, spoiler alert at the end of the movie, they are announced as the New Avengers and the new title comes up and couple day a day or so after the movies come out, they're up there ripping off Thunderbolts and now putting the new Avengers up there. Really? Oh, that's disgusting. Marvel must have a new owner.


We're Stan Lee. Rest in peace. Rest In peace. Where is Stan Lee? When you need, you're Doing whatever the fuck. But the movie Thunderbolt are not the new Avengers. I don't care how many people put up. I agree. But I I'm not gonna get, I just did not like the, the way the trailer portrayed who the protagonist was in the movie. They didn't really show it. So it was kinda like, oh shit, this motherfucker's powerful as hell. He's this, he's this, he's this. Again, I don't follow the comics, I don't care. I am an MCU viewer. I just follow the movies. It was a new Avengers in the comic books. No, I'm not saying nothing about that. I'm talking about the movie itself though. It felt like a letdown. Like once you found out, okay, this is who these niggas is fighting and this is how y'all beat this nigga.


Are you serious? So it wasn't Well oh wait, so it's the so they're the good guys. You're talking about the The Suicide squad. But a but a, that's What I was gonna say. It looks like Suicide Squad, but that's The Anta. But Suicide Squad was bad. But that's the antagonist. I I don't wanna spoil it. So it wasn't Well No. Rather than protagonist it's the antagonist the evil. Oh, excuse me, I said that wrong protagonist. Pardon me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Mel knows the words, not me. The evil. The evil. Yeah, it was, I was like, really? I'm cool. It didn't look like I'm So cool on Thunderbolts

Your friends and Neighbors. Your Friends and neighbors. Apple, What is it about a man that go broke in? Yeah, super, super rich. Yeah. Yeah.

I absolutely love him. But it's a great show. Mad Men, if you haven't seen it, please check it out on Apple tv.


This is not an ad, it's just a really good show. You were saying Mark, I was going a whole different direction. Please. No, go ahead. We didn't talk about Diddy. This is the Diddy trial opened up this week. Well Just, just jury selection Right now. No, but it, what I thought was interesting about the jury selection was how they're deciding how they're getting rid of people. Did you, did you see this? So they questionnaire, they interviewed 150 people. Yeah. They gave all a questionnaire. This is a normal voir dire process. You know, they're trying to get through, you know, to see if you can, if you can be impartial, impartial to see if you've had bad experiences, whether you've been experienced sexual assault, et cetera. But then they gave them a list of celebrities that they had to know or not know. And the list was interesting.


They asked him if they knew Michael B. Jordan. They asked him if they knew who Kanye West was. They asked him if they knew who Mike Myers was. They asked him if they knew who Kid Cuddy was. I thought the list was interesting. One, it's a window into maybe whose name's gonna come up in trial. Yeah, Yeah. The Mike Myers thing was kind of a, a bit of a red herring for me. I was like, I I don't know that Mike Meyer's name won't come up at trial. Like, we don't know. Right. We don't know. I was just surprised that, that I wasn't expecting, you know, Wayne's world, but like well, well Puff's fucking network is, we don't know who might pop up in this motherfucker. But I was also thinking like, who would be in a jury pool That has never do, I never heard of Kanye West. Yeah. I was like, I don't know if I want a jury pool that doesn't know who Kanye West or Mike Myers is.


I think that's a test though. It's A Tactic. It's a test too. Because in in the jury selection process, you should be removed from the story. Right, right. Because if you watch the story on the news, like during the OJ trial, they told them don't turn the TVs on. Yeah. Like you are not supposed to have any information already or have heard of anything. So if you Kanye West comes across your algorithm Yeah. F Kid Cudi comes across your algorithm, then more than likely Sean Combs has come across your algorithm. And you might've already be impartial. But I'm just saying like, if you've never, if if you're a juror and you've lived in America and never heard of Kanye and you've never heard of Mike Myers and you've never heard all these people, I'm like, are you a normal person? Like, I don't know if a normal person could go at this stage in 2025 and not know who any of these people think you Adults upon 12 people that not know any of them names.


That that's what I'm saying. I don't, I don't, it's possible. I don't think it's possible. I get, I get your point to people being, being disconnected from the story. But I think this one of 'em cases like OJ where we not even gonna pretend you disconnected from the story. We just wanna pretend we just want somebody who can be impartial despite knowing the story. Or, Or kid Cudi. Like if you bring King CU kid, pardon me, kid Cudi into the, to the fold, you know the rumors are surrounded Puff and kid Cudi. Right. You get what I'm saying? So all of those things, you, You, there ain't even a rumor because Cudi said that shit, we didn't say it. Nah, I feel you cut said that shit. You know what I mean? I ain't indicting nigga. I'm just saying that you kind of want to try Yeah. And attempt like it's no grownup person that really don't know who Sean Combs is. But you want to attempt and in your best efforts to have it be unbiased.


Yeah. I think unbiased is the goal. I, I'd be skeptical of a somebody if somebody told me they didn't know who Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West, Mike Myers was, was there anybody else on the list? I think they were lying. Was There anybody else on the list other than those Four? There were a few. Dawn. Dawn from they, they raised Dawn. Okay. From Dirty, dirty money and, and can, that's what I'm trying to think of who else I'm trying to see. I'm trying to pull up the list now. But Don have a, those are the big ones. I have a question for you, mark, when you finish. Yeah, go ahead bro. What do you say to someone that the closer this trial comes right, that actually starts to get nervous and feel bad for him. Right? Do they express that publicly or do you feel like because they'll be judged, they have to internalize it.


What do you say to that? Like, just feel bad and now I'm nervous. Now It is looking like he's about to go forever. And my relationship with him was this, regardless of what the people See that you feel like you talking about potential jurors or just people in general? Just a person in general. Like somebody who's connected to him. A friend of yours. Yeah. You talking about like him? Oh God, not me. No, not you, but people like him. Like him. I mean one of the people like you nigga one, but, but I wouldn't have no problem saying that. I want him answer because you not gonna, you, you not gonna, I want him to answer it. 'cause I don't think you're gonna answer the question honestly. Okay. I think you going to, I I pussyfoot around. Yeah. 'cause I, I and you mastered that and I understand why like I have to move like that. But I want to know when you express this, you think Mark has more empathy than me?


No, I just feel like it's hard to, I feel like in the world that we live in today, It is hard to express that. But you would get judged for expressing, you know, your, your concern for a person who might have done bad and like, damn, I just hope everything works out. Like how does a person, I think they should be honest about that. I mean, I, I think even if they get judged, I mean that's, that's the risk of telling the truth, right? I mean Got it. You know, I, I work with people, I do a lot of work with prisoners. I've been working with prisoners for decades. Some of them did the crimes. I just think they got too much time. Some of 'em, I don't believe, some believe some of them I believe are innocent. Others. I believe like you shouldn't get 30 years for doing X. You know what I mean? And it's tough to say when someone's been harmed, you know? Yeah. He did it, but he still shouldn't get life.


You know. So when it comes to Diddy, I think, I don't think anybody's defending what they saw on tape that we know Diddy did. I think the question becomes for people, for some people, the people you're talking about is one. Is he, has he done everything that he's accused of? Because once, once the floodgates opened, you had thousands of people accusing everything He did some of that shit. Some of it I'm confident he didn't do. Right. We don't know. That's what the trial is for. Yeah. And then the second question is, will the punishment fit the crime? You know, there's rumors that, oh no, it's not rumors. He confirmed that they rejected the settlement. Right. I don't know what the settlement offer was. I've heard five years, I've heard other numbers. I don't know what's true. But that puff rejected the puff rejected the settlement. Yeah. There's a plea deal on the table. Deal and rejected.


I I'm saying, I'm sorry I said settlement. I mean plea. I'm sorry. They, he rejected the plea deal. So we know that there is a number out there that's, that's tangible that was offered for some people. It, the fact that he rejected that will take away their sympathy. Like you had, you had an opportunity to get a lower number. Now if you get roofed, that's on you unless you think you're innocent. Right. So all these, all these things play out for me, it's gonna come down to what's in the, in the trial and what comes out. I'm confident that Diddy did some of that shit, but I'm not confident at what the details are until I see you need to answer my question. As far as the people I'm saying, they should speak out and tell the truth despite the, regardless. Regardless. I think that's, that's always the right answer. And I think we have to be more honest about that because we're in a culture now where we only defend people who are innocent. True. And part of the, the criminal legal system and part of the, the, the structure of it, in my estimation is not just to protect the innocent, but also to make sure that people who do bad things don't get excessive punishment.


That's why we don't have cruel and unusual punishment. You know? So, so we have to think about all those things. And that means sometimes taking a tough position to get. And I, I got burnt by that last week. I, I, I wrote, I was working with a brother who was locked up for 22 years for, for murder. And I worked with him. I mentored him, I talked to him. He's been home for two years and he, he, he, he just got arrested last week for murder and somebody else. I don't feel, I don't feel that I was wrong for, okay. That has to affect your part or the mom standard. You getting desperate man. It is. Okay. No, that's all you can, You defended What? I didn't defend him. I'm joking, but I want him to come home. But you know, because he, he was reformed rehabilitated.


He, he was, he became a journalist in prison. You know, all these Wow. Thought reform. Yes. That's something that, these are the things that he said. You Talking about the brother. There was a story recently. Okay. Last week. Got it. Yeah. And, and so those are the moments. He came home and killed somebody else. Allegedly. He's accused of it. He's charged with it. Yeah, he's charged with it. He got arrested last week. I knew him well how did you feel when you saw that? I was heartbroken. I was heartbroken for the, for the woman he allegedly killed. I was heartbroken for all the people, all the prisoners who we work with to get rehabilitated and to get to do the right thing and to get sentenced. You know, because this sets everybody back. This sets everybody back. When you fight for bail reform, when you fight for prison reform, it's hard. Or when you fight for abolition, It is hard to say that. 'cause they always gonna say, what about him?


Had he Served his full sentence or did he get some I think he did. The whole he did. Nah, he did. He did, they gave him the whole thing. Okay. He, he ate the whole thing and, and now he's going back. So, but all that to say, so for me, I understand the challenge of standing with people who are quote unquote guilty. Yes. But that's all part of the process. And with Diddy, we got this Cassie tape, which he fought to get suppressed. Suppressed because they said, well prejudice the jury. And I'm seeing mixed reports on that. Yeah. Like sometimes some, in some reports they're saying they will allow that video evidence. And I've heard they do in my recent reports, I'm saying they're saying that it's undecided and as of now they will not yet. Mm. So I'm uncertain of that.


I'll answer your question anyway. Even though you looking for my answer. Fuck you bitch. No, no. Because I feel bad when I look at his kids. Yeah. Because when we ask you this question, I I, I seen you, I you gotta remember what he wasn't here when the shit was first going on. I'm gonna be mindful what I say. You know, like I seen you battle, in my opinion, your true feelings and how you have, how you want to come off to the masses. I seen that in real time. And that's no disrespect to you. You just have a Job to do. No, don't don don't, don't paint it wrong. I'm, I'm battling the person that I knew versus the person that people are saying they know. Sorry, That's what he said. That's what I'm, that's what I'm saying. But lemme clear It is because it wasn't a battle with what I wanted to say and what didn Didn't want say.


No because when the first, when it first happened, especially When you've been to the party Hold On. Wait, wait. When it first, when the yeah, when it first happened, Everybody just didn't have that view of punk. But listen, I don't give fuck what they say about 'em. Now the niggas the best hostess, host, host, hostess, depending On the night Yeah. That, that hip hop is ever seen. So Can we, sometimes you want the truth, but sometimes we can't tell the truth. You Can say the truth anytime you want and if it's too much truth, we'll edit it out. All, all I'm saying is that I watch people in real time. You have feelings and once the information came out was battling it, battling with those feelings internally.


'cause then now, like you said earlier, like the person that I know and the person that the public knows it, it, it's an internal conflict and it's irresponsible for even me for a person to come up here and say something and it comes insensitive to others who may have suffered. So that's, that's, that's just, yeah. A hard thing to deal with me. I, I'll just go off on the ledge and I deal with the ramifications, but sometimes that's irresponsible and, and I appreciate you guys bringing me bringing it there. Hold on. Now you don't have to do all that. You just don't have to do it. But I also feel like, And on the flip side of what you're saying, well to add on to what you're saying, yeah. There's tons of people out there that believe he'll be back on the street shortly. Yeah. You right. People, There's a bunch of people that that yeah. I mean there's some people that don't feel they have the strongest case against him and you know, per the reports they're saying he was in the court.


Eight lawyers deep eight lawyers strong. The most recent lawyer is homeboy that hip hop his crown best lawyer in the universe. Thug Thug's lawyer Brian Steele Was Brian Steeler or was it Drew? It was Brian. Brian. Either way. Both of them. Cri de la crimp. Right. So if you got, if your money is long as trained smoking, it's just words and you're sitting there with eight of the best attorneys in the universe, you Feeling good and you feel like, you know They said, he said he was nervous while he was in the Said today. Said. Said yes. He said that as should he said he had reading glasses on. He's now playing the game. You know what the game is. Yeah. I'm gonna appear to be, you know, you know, Not arrogant, not I think no, none of that stuff.


I think it's Also okay To be wait, hold, I'm sorry hold over quick. 'cause he's gonna make them make the prosecution or the feds or whoever this is draw a very distinct line between the difference in being a swinger and being a sex trafficker. That's what it seems like from from the reports. Me even thinking about that. That does muddy and a little bit Yeah. Yeah. Now and let what Muddy It up in what we regard mud, muddy it up as in It is gonna be your job to have all facts i's dotted Like in the OJ case. Yeah. Like in the OJ case, you dropped the ball on how y'all collected evidence, what evidence you got, how y'all handle things, fucked it up.


Who cares if he did it or not. Yeah. He's putting the ball in their court to make sure everything that you have collecting the evidence says I am a sex trafficker and sexual abuser versus I'm on some other Yeah. Some freaky wild shit. Yeah. And in addition to, it's a great defense. Yeah. But in addition to that, apparently the phrase coercive control has been stricken. It can't be used. Which is Huge. See Yeah. And he tried to use the drug defense too that failed. Right. Because they were trying to, they're trying to, I didn like that defense. Yeah that was horrible. Wasn't even made that Go point. That was a mess. But you gotta throw it up there. But you gotta throw everything out there. Right. Because if you can establish the idea was basically saying that to criminal, to get a criminal conviction, you have to criminal conviction, you have to show that you had a criminal mind.


We call a mens rea a criminal mind. And his point was, I was so high, I don't know what to Fuck That I didn't have the intent to Yeah. I didn't have a criminal, A Criminal act. Exactly. Exactly. It was just fun to me it's An affirmative defense. Like I did it, but I did it because It is just like, And I thought that everybody was a willing participant, right? Yeah. So they were like, yeah, Fuck that. Then he played the race card with the man act saying basically the, the man act has been used mainly against black men. Tra you know, like Jack Johnson, all these people's been used to basically to to criminalize black men for all kinds of shit. Right. Wasn't the most persuasive argument. Jack Johnson is the boxer. The boxer. Right. Because he a white woman and basic that Yeah, I remember. I remember. Yeah. So then he's establishing this third piece, which I think is the best argument, which is, look, I'm a freak ball, right? Like I do freaky shit. I do wild shit and I do wild, I'm rich.


So if you do freaky wild shit with drugs and a lot of people, you gonna be traveling across the country. We got escorts, we got this, we got that. This wasn't sex trafficking, this was just regular fucking, and because the jury is supposed to invoke what they call the reasonable man standard, the idea of what would a reasonable person do under this situation is quite reasonable that a juror, even if they can't, even if they didn't live that life couldn't relate to it, they assume that rich people do freaky wild shit. Understood. So I, I think that that actually might make a juror say, you know what, Puffy's not a criminal. He's the freak Or or the other side, we got di we got dialogue that says yo blah blah blah blah blah. Can't wait to do X, Y, Z. But you live in California and I live in Florida. Right. So when you got on that plane and me and you have a dialogue saying I'm gonna eat your ass out like crab bay, you get on a flight and you come over there and you did it.


I heard That. That feels like real dialogue. Exactly. You didn't just make that one up. Your Right Do search. Right Crab nigga, what the fuck? Come on Man, you freak. I don't even eat crab y'all Nigga. Stupid. You might eat crab Dialogue, whatever the dialogue might have been. Double crab. You know what I'm saying? Like yo dog, we, we've all not for nothing had women come from other states maybe to visit us. Yeah. And if y'all got into some shit then that could potentially go Left. Right. And he, they're gonna like, that's what he means. But they're gonna blur that line. Yeah. They're going, It Is just interesting. It took him that long to pick this as the defense.


That might have always been their their their their go-to defense again. You throw everything out. Yeah. You throw the shit that's exculpatory first you throw out the shit that's going to make, make them say you didn't do it first. If you can And I'm not in a rush to release my defense to people that are about to prepare Against that can prepare their own defense. Right. Yeah. No, I don't know. I'm not doing that. Yeah. Just for the record, because I forgot everyone here, here. What is everybody staying here? Y'all feel he's going down? Y'all feel he is coming out? I think they're gonna get him because they want to get him. I think they're gonna get him. I don't care about none of what the evidence they, they wanna get him. So they're gonna get him. I don I Don think It is gonna, I don't think it's gonna be forever. It's gonna be a couple years, five years maybe. I think he's gonna, I think we'll do five to seven. You say time served. Nah, I ain't time am Back saying Time served.


Nah, no time served. We good now? Not we but there're they're getting him. Yeah. I would like to know what that plea was. I mean I know I won't but 10 To 15. I'm 15. 10 to 15 come home in seven. That's A good point. What 'cause right. 'cause the question is what is the number that he would've said yes to? They from three years? You take it right after you've already done a year. So it had to be at least five five like you said, five or So. It depends on who your arrogance is. And I'll just say yeah, it depends on who your your what your, what your team, what your law team is telling you to do. Your team of these niggas that they are. Thug lawyer was like didn didn't want him to take a plea. I told him no period. The ASAP s situation now Different case You Right. Because that was not the feds, them niggas offer count ASAP what, six 180 days? Yeah. And we, and we was kicking his back in like why he ain't take that shit that's 18 months or six months or some shit.


And he was like, no. And, and I did come in and apologize to him. Yeah, Me too. I was, I was absolutely wrong. You see what I'm Saying? Out to Rocky again for his Work last day. Shout to asap Rocky. Shout to Rocky like dog. We, we came in here like yo fam six months nigga you take that and, and unfortunately we don't. Well fortunately we don't have the loyal lawyer teams that they got and the legal teams that they got saying Yo, we about to kick these niggas asses. Yeah. And again there's another side of that bro. We see niggas wear the plea deal look like it's something that they should take. They take it to trial and get roofed. We see Tory, we all s saw Torry was walking Tory, A Lot of Tory, Tory, Tory out Tory's legal team wasn't to the fuck out and his legal team wasn't that true.


That's if his legal, that nigga's legal team was not, not above The fuck out. He, he told bunch of missteps with Tory but water under the bridge. Yeah, Water. Exactly. I remember somebody else, they offered him, they was like, yo, take 20 and guess what? And his lawyer wasn't Themm. No his lawyer don't get me started. His lawyer wasn't Themm neither. I know who you're talking about. His lawyer wasn't them. His lawyer was playing the internet games and all that shit. Yep. These niggas right here are professionals bro. Yeah. But These come there with $4,000 suits on looking the park. Playing The park. But there is a world in which the jury looks at this dream team and it turns them off. Could be There is, It is a world where that happens. Absolute. There's a world where they say the common Man can't get a fair Can. Exactly. But this rich motherfucker can hire this.


You know? I agree. Lawyers with their $4,000 suits and he'll fuck you. You know what I'm Saying? I Agree with that. You right. I totally agree with That. So we don't know what's gonna happen but with, we dunno, Cassie being a witness for the prosecution, even if they don't have the video, just her witness testimony and per her testimony alone is going to be really, really, really hard. I, I Think I could, I think her testimony is gonna be pivotal but I al I think that cross Exam is gonna Be pivotal. Thank you. I think that cross Thank you. Cross is gonna be a Monster. Thank you. Run the risk. And I heard you Do run some risks putting her up there. Do you see Him? No. And they said even with the tape, even with the tape, they said they got other tapes of Puff. Yes. They would have to have other Tapes.


No, and they said, and there's other tapes. It displays a whole different narrative. Well if I believe that Puff is is is freaky boy, camcorder man, then yeah, niggas got tapes I was recording so the same shit is some shit against me. I got some shit that kind of proves what I'm saying as well. And there you go. What you again muddies the lines like you said, Do you think he takes the stand in his own defense? No. No. He Better not. You think they never let him Take the stand? No. No. Okay. Absolutely not. You don't pay, you don't pay those high price attorneys for you to have to get up there and please your case No. For you to have to get up there and get cross examined. Yeah. Nah. Right. Ain't doing that. That's The last thing we want. No, we not doing that. Last thing we, we want, Listen, did you See what y'all think about the lines of people out there?

It's like first come, first serve type shit. Crazy. People are lining up at God knows what time. What is the second 6:00 AM What is the second craziest trial that y'all have ever witnessed or been alive for? I say second 'cause I'm just gonna put OJ on One. Oj. OJ Menendez. Oj OJ goes at one John Gotti for Everybody. John Gotti, Robert Blakely. I ain't never Followed none of That shit. Phil Specter. Phil Specter's a good one Because of the, because it was two trials. First one was a mistrial. Second one he gets convicted for. But when I speak on biggest trial, yeah, that was a real good one.


But when I speak of biggest, I also mean Jeffrey fucking Dahmer. No, No, sorry. I'm also talking about your reaction, your relationship to It. Your, yeah, like, because these, these are huge. For me, it was Michael. For me it was Michael Jackson, but for me it was only two Jackson. Michael Jackson, and OJ were the only two that I feltman. George Simmons. George Jim was close. Might been it George Zimmer. But Michael Jackson for me was bigger. No, Mike White, second Michael. I second. It was OJ and Zimmerman for Me. Which case gave you the biggest, maybe I, let me reword it. Which case gave you the biggest aha? Like wow, like holy shit, I can't believe what I'm seeing. Rodney King. Rodney King. Rodney King. I, I was about, say Rodney nigga King. Rodney King. Yeah. That Rodney King, bro.


Rodney King. We saw these cops beating this man on the ground. Right. So in our brain, and I was younger. Yeah. But in our brain It is like, it's no way that they could possibly argue this. You get what I'm saying? Shit. It's no way that they could possibly justify these, the Imma Shit. We didn't see it. Rodney King. We saw these men beating this man on tape, kicking them in the face, beating them with batons, and then none of them niggas got a day. Got it. So that was something that we had to Yeah, that was heartbreak. That was heart For me. Right after OJ would probably have to be Aaron Hernandez. That was a big trial. But it didn't, I didn't have the aha from That. I don, I don't care about the, the, the, the trial. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I care about Wait, what?


Because Of the gay stuff. No. 'cause this is a four watching of down. Has he? On my fantasy team, six bodies has six bodies. I'm like, wait, he was doing the gay stuff. No. Fuck that air. It is, It is killing everybody. But it, I guess I went into the trial knowing that already. So I didn, I wasn't shy. I didn't have an aha moment the way I did with, well Wait. They learned about new bodies in the trial. That's true. Once you killed two, six, don't really lie. I'm not like, oh, he killed even more people. He's a killer. It was, the fact that he was a killer was the shocker for me. I ain't know that If you jump from two to six, you a serial killer. Now. That's true. Two could be serious circumstance. Right? I know niggas in the hood that killed two niggas. You killed six nigga, you in the hood hall of fame. Them same two niggas. You, you think they only killed?


They might got four more. Fuck we talking about The hood don't know. Right? We talking about the ones you know. Yeah. Like, God, that nigga For me, one of the most impactful trials I ever watched in my entire life was Paul Bernardo and Carla Homolka. Yeah. Do you know who they are? Did y'all, I thought you say Martha Stewart Tell you that your to h and B. Oh yo. I'm joking. What? Hear Carl Manko. Let Me Manka honey. No, Carl Bernardo and Carla Homolka, they were a married couple and they lived in, they lived in Canada. They lived in Fuck St. Catherine's. It's like the suburb that's like about 50 miles outside of Toronto. And on the surface, you know, he's this good looking guy.


She's his good looking wife and everything is perfect. Right. Come to find out they're murdering young girls together. So the first girl was named Leslie Mohay. She goes missing, nobody knows where she is. Her body's later, later found like, you know, dismembered in encased in cement. The worst part about that is, the worst part about that is, is that she kept leaving. You know, she kept sneaking out at home and one night her mom found out that she snuck out. So to teach her a lesson, she locked the door. And so that was when Paul Bernardo found Leslie, Leslie Mahaffey. That was her name. And so then their next victim was this girl named Kristen French.


And they, why did you Know this case? So well Know these. I'm telling Did did you do a wait, Did you do a movie of the week reenactment of this? I did not. I don. No, but this I cadaver Is, This is one. This is one of the biggest trials. Mark, Yo, you and itch. Gotta stop. Are y'all crazy? Oh shit.

They're called the Canon Barbie killers. What, What year was this? Like 1992. And you remember their names? I remember that's what broke me up 14 about this. Because it was so crazy. Because their third victim was, her sister Was, her name was the third, his name.


It was Carla MoCA's sister. So Tammy, her name was Tammy. Yeah. You good boy. You need a ho. So wait, so hold on. So wait, hold on, hold on. No, no, no. So let me, let me tell you the aha moment. Different reasons. She needs a whole, Lemme tell you the aha moment in this trial. Let Stop. I'm going hear a fucking story. Do you? No. Really? No, no. He not. I I don shut up Because this is a really interesting, this is a really interesting story. Extremely Story. Interesting. What happened, man, about immunity. Mm. So they know that they've caught him. And as a matter of fact, he was also the Scarborough rapist. He was rape. He like raped like 50 women. Okay, so hold on. So she, the prosecution basically, you know, has her as a witness and they offer her immunity.


And she's like, I'm, I was a battered woman, I was forced to do all these things. Whatever. So they, she gets her immunity deal like 11 years or something like that. Then they find tapes inside of the ceiling of the house. They looked through this house like torn it apart four times and never found these tapes. Somehow, some way on the fifth time they found these tapes, when they view these tapes of them torturing the girls and murdering them and but performing sex acts on them. They realized that she was fully in this and was not a battered woman at all. And, but they'd given her immunity. She got off, she got off 11 years. Now she lives somewhere. Husband, kids, you know, living the whole like fucking trad wife life.

Show. Just seeing if we got a part of the show for sure. Oh, for Sure. Just checking to see if we got one. I'm gonna read this. It is my first time reading this long pause. This is from Theo Culture or The Culture. This says I Met Big Pun once by Chance. Let me know if you think I was an asshole. Well why do I care about That? It might be Fine. I'll read it. 'cause he paid. Might have been an asshole. First and foremost, shout out to the old JBP cast. Shout Out to you. Longtime listener and supporter. I tie, I tie dye clothing for a living, which takes hours. And the P truly holds me down while working. Oh, okay. Let me paint the picture. It's 1999. I'm 19 years old. Nas had just released his album. I don't wanna read this shit.


Nas had just released his album. I Am and had an in-store signing at NYCA Tower Records of Virgin Records Mega Store. Me and my boy being big fans drove down an hour from Connecticut in hopes to meet Nas. And by the album we get there and there's a long line outside the building for the signing. So long, so long that the record store eventually comes out and tells the people in line that they were no longer accepting anyone else inside. That was obviously disappointing but parked on the street nearby was a gold big body Benz. We looked closer and it was Big punt. I recognized the Benzs from the John Blaze video. We decided to go up and meet Punt as we were big fans of him as well before we approached the car.


I thumbed through the XXL magazine I brought with Nas on the cover for him to sign. Knowing damn well pun would be in there somewhere. Sure enough, he was featured in one of the sections with a photo of him and a thought bubble that had a cheeseburger inside it. I did hesitate for a second, but did bring the magazine for him to sign. He dapped me up, saw the magazine, said something to his homie in Spanish, chuckled a bit, signed it and gave it back. He was so cool and cordial. I always felt a way about it. In hindsight, I probably wouldn't have had him sign that. But I always blamed Double XL and their editorial staff for making fun of him in that way.


At the height of his career. You Hear That Elliot? I was just, I was just a 19-year-old kid who wanted to get an autograph from one of my favorite MCs. Alright, that's a nice wholesome part of the Show. Oh yeah, that was wholesome. You wasn't an asshole. I don't think you're an asshole. You wasn't. Yeah, yeah. You didn't, you you didn't know. You knew not what you did. You, you were young. He was a great sport about it. That's the part. And he signed it and gave it back. Now plenty of fans are dicks and we'll have you try to autograph a bootleg cd. Yeah, Bootleg merch. Somebody else's merch. Oh They'll, they do. They do all they have. You try to autograph your, like the team you Yeah like, like if, if a Knicks player they run into him, you'll sign this for me and then they move it at the last minute.


It's a Celtics jersey. Yeah. Some shit like that. So fans could get on some dickhead shit. Fans not understand. I don't think that that applies to, I don't think it was puns. First time seeing that. Picture the culture. Rest in peace. Big fun. Rest in, rest in peace. And shout out to you again if you join the part of the show tier on Patreon and pay that fee.
