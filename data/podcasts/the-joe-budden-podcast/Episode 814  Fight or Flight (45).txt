But Thank you guys for being my cheerleading spot. All right. So please tell us. Okay, anyways, back to the scamming. Tell, Tell yourself please. Okay, so 20 years old, I was unemployed. It was a tough year. That was a fucked up year. And somehow, some way, somebody that I was loosely associated with presented this option. To me it was like an all expense trade or trip to Europe.


And all I had to do was just take some money over there and then collect something and bring it back. All you had to do everything. And so I remember just this clandestine meeting happening in a car outside my house. Three People that size is the word of the day. Three people in the car that I don't know who they are other than the guy I loosely have an association with. This was At your house? Yeah. Can I ask a question? Were your parents home? Don't do it. Well, my, my, my mom maybe was there. Yes. I don't know. Yo. Well, did your mom stop, stop, stop.


I said don't do it. Go ahead. What's wrong with you? Come on man. My mom, my mom had a lot going on in her own life. You know, she was a single patient. She, she was a single parent at this point. Come on. So it was hard to keep track of her 20-year-old daughter who is like, God knows what, what she was getting into. So I'm outside in the car. It's like up the block from the house. So my mom doesn't even know where I'm at. I could be at the store. She didn't know he was at, I could be at the gym. Stop it. Joke. It is like, when, when my, when my dogs used to escape, I just had no idea. They was just at the gas station. Just like, yo, yo, your dogs are now, they left. Yo, Mel was just roaming free. I was roaming free. So we're inside the car, it's snowing, it's the dead of winter.


And they're just explaining the whole situation of how we're all gonna travel together, you know, with this, with money. And all we have to do is collect these packages and then bring them back. These Packages, We got a, we got a couple of days in like Amsterdam and whatnot. And I don't know, something about the whole situation seemed a little shady. So I something Yeah. So I didn't end up going through with it, but it was tempting at time because It was this post nine 11. Right? A pre This is pre Got it. Yeah, this is pre 'cause I was, I shoulda got It off. You got it. You could've got I was 20. Yeah. Yeah. You should've did that. Oh yeah. I mean, I might not be sitting here talking to y'all about it. No, You'd have got off. You got Off. Yeah. So anyways, I didn't end up doing it.


I, I got like this time, this time, yes. This time I didn't end up doing it because I feel like this ran across your desk a few times in life. Maybe one more time. Maybe one more time. But that was definitely like go to Mexico, you Know, and, and free my girl. Free my girl Rocky who, who used to do their youngberg demos, who was taking that little drive across Free the highway. And then they pulled her over, they got her with the pill. Her story just wasn't the same as her homegirl. She just had, they got her with all, all, all the work. They got her. Oops. Unfortunate Rocky. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What's the update on that story? I don't have the update. Oh, I thought you said 'cause they both got locked up. Rocky and the other girl got locked up.


Up? Yeah. Okay. They both did because you said the story was different from the home girl. No, because that's why they, when the cops pulled him over, they said, where y'all going? Oh, the stories didn't match. Got their stories. Got it. Didn't. I thought you talking about the outcome. You gotta go down, you gotta go free Rocky. Yo. I was just speaking that too before you, I don't know. Sometimes you gotta, Rocky is fire, super fire. That's a lot of talent in jail. Super flame on sometimes, sometimes music shit gets tough.

Yes. Yes, yes. I mean, listen man, we need you to go into your movie bag because I, me, I watched a few, but I'm familiar with who he is. You know, I'm a Batman guy, but gimme something else. Okay. Little known fact. Oh, here we go. There is a movie called True Romance. Great movie and it, yeah. Great movie. Movie. If you've never seen the movie, you gotta watch it. I remember that. It came out in 1993. It was written by Quentin Tarantino, but it was directed by Tony Scott. Okay. And it has everybody in it.


Like a typical Quentin Tarantino movie. I mean, it has James Gal Feeny, it's got Brad Pitt, it's got Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette. It's got everybody in it. Val Kilmer's in it. But you never really actually see him. Huh? Because he plays the role of Elvis. Oh His. His guardian angel. Right. Wow. And most people never figured that out. I Didn never knew That. Get out. Wow. Yeah. Get outta here. Just a little tri little piece Of trivia. Let Gate Tri back. Yeah. I never knew that. Yeah. Whoa. Parks. Did you know that I didn I Never knew that. I haven't seen True Romance in a long time. You told all of us something. Alright. Val Kilmer was Elvis Val Kilmer played the role of Elvis Christian, Slater's guardian angel in True Romance.


Mm. No. Yeah. Like I feel like Val Kilmer, I would've to pull up his fucking movie Graphy. But I feel like in his later years he was like, just in some off Spur d movies that I Love. It was like, oh shit. Look at Val Kemerer right there. Like, and I don't remember the name of him more so than his blockbusters. Later on, let me look. I have his discography up. Top Gun Maverick. Of course. We said that I don't see Much because in 2014 he was diagnosed with throat cancer, throat cancer. And he had two tracheostomies and it affected his vocal chords. It did. Right. And so basically he just, he really couldn't perform.


So he did this, they, they put out a documentary called Val and it really kind of showed, you know, just kind of all aspects of his life and you know, kind of his eccentricity and stuff like that. But also just how difficult the cancer diagnosis and just the treatment was. Oh Lord Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. So, but that's actually not what he ended up passing away from. Pneumonia. Pneumonia. Mm. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So 65 years old. So rest in peace. Val Carol Murphy. Rest in peace. He was peace. Rest in in peace. Val. He was a wonderful performer. Lots of tributes coming in from, you know, the Hollywood community. He was dope. He was dope. He was dope. Yeah. Rest in peace. Val Kimer. We love him. We love him. Absolute legend.

Oh, Happy Birthday. Happy birthday Jill. We love you. Wait a minute. We love you. All right, all right, all right, all right. All right. Slow Newsweek. Not much to get to but Man you Didn't Waste any fucking time.


Alright. No, that's not right. His finger, he was like Parks, it's not working. Make That's right. I'm sorry. Take it back. That was crazy. No, I take it back. 'cause I didn't know where y'all wanted to go from there. Like, I don't know. I don't know. So, and that's true. It might be some other important stuff. Oh, whatever. Anywhere in the world. Anywhere in the world. Y'all want to go? I'm down to go. Si. This is the remix. This is the, this is remix. This is the re minute.


So we have this little tradition here that we do when content creators take a fall. Like Parks on an Astoria street, not looking at the sew. We have this thing we do where when any of our peers fail, our contemporaries fail out there. We play this little jingle by Queen. Another one Bites the Dust man. Not to highlight the failure but to highlight the mistakes. To highlight the mistakes you want to avoid making so that you don't fall to the same fate. It's more so, it's more so about that.


Sure. Our good brother Adam 22 recently put out a video and I will pull the video up in a second. He put out a video recently talking about the state of no jumper. No jumper is or was. Or has been a large part in the content creation community. Has what? Right there. Right there. There you go. Yep. There you go. They have been an instrumental part in the content creation community for quite some time. That's true. We had Adam 22 on our show somewhere in what? 2021. 2022. Yeah. Back somewhere around there.


Oh shit. My bad. You good at Parks is we pressed him a little bit. Got a lot of backlash from the audience. Left it alone. Time will tell God don't play about me. You know what I mean? Hey, there's opinions, there's internet fodder and then this what happens when God starts just making shit happen? These niggas fall flat on concrete every time. It never fucking fails. And I don't want to even talk about Adam too much. I want to talk about all of the Adam cheerleaders that had they pompoms out a few years ago telling me about all the money that Adam made.


Oh yeah. It was a bunch of y'all remember they had a list? Yeah. Then a list went out. Yeah. A list was out. Yeah, a list went out. A list. A goddamn list went out and everybody had adamant and just like some wild number. I was like, all right. All of a sudden all of my black friend content creators was fucking experts on what? What white porn Dick made. All of a sudden these niggas was, oh hold on. You selling dicks though? I don't know. I don't know Joe. He show his wife, he tells the porn show psych he's fucking on camera. Shut the fuck up. What the fuck were y'all talking to with all of that hoo nanny.


But anyway, Adam, It is put out a clip and this is like friendly smoke. This ain't real smoke 'cause I hate to see. Nah, that's a lie. Let not lie. Lemme not lie. I don't hate to see it. I thought it was trolling. That's not true. Honestly. Thought out. So too. I thought some April bullshit. Well let me be clear. Adam ain't broke. Nah. Like I don't want niggas to, to misconstrue what I'm doing and what I'm saying here, I'm just having fun with one of the people that I like to have fun with. When they hit they head, you know like when you tell your son don't touch that and then they touch it and you walk in the room and they got that stupid fucking face on.


Did they touch it? Yeah. You touch the shit and you sit there. I told your ass, didn't I just tell your fucking dumb ass not to touch that? Good for you. This is like what I'm doing with Adam. There's not a real beef. Actually Adam hit me when he was in New York to say, Hey, me and Wack is in town. Maybe we'll come through and fucking chop it up. I dubbed it but there's no beef about it. So Adam put out a clip talking about how he's closing no jumper. Which again, I don't think Adam, Adam is far from broke. He just doing some rebranding finagling and moving some monies around. 'cause his lawsuit's happening. Yeah. The feds was just at my door. Like I got a lot of life shit going on.


Restructuring these content creators never show you that part. I hate 'em all. I hate every last fucking one of them. They never show you the part about when life just get to going around them. They always want to disappear for a little bit. But the cam cam down. Mm. That's when they want to cam down. Press the button. Yeah. For a few months. I can't. Nah, nah, nah. You following through. So Adam put out a little clip and I'd like to play it for y'all. See right there. Perk head motherfucker. Somebody sent me a clip of Joe Biden claiming that no jumper's doing real bad in terms of our views and everything.


So let's do the science. Oh shit Joe. It's clip. It's the wrong clip bro. Oops. No jumpers. Main channel plus our clips. Channel has done about what's wrong with 26, 20 7 million views for the past month. Hey, two times by far what you have going on. And on top of that we kill it on Facebook. We kill it on Snapchat. We have 3 million Yo. He did all that dirty BMX white boy. Let me tell you, let me tell you like I tell my 50-year-old black friends.


What for the block. Once Facebook enters the conversation, you got it. I am leaving Powell. That's for mom and dad. Yeah. Aunts and uncles to fight about politics. I know you tried to make that shit sound fly, but in real life, the second somebody say to me, yo, this is what's going on on Facebook. I check out. Yeah. Yeah. It is fucking Facebook and Snapchat. Yo y'all let these niggas get so shut off. Let's keep it going. Followers on Instagram and we make a huge amount of money on there Joe button. I don't want to hear shit.


You are running a chop shop. Oh you Might have the whole hip hop media gassed into thinking that you're really killing it like that. But trust me, when you want to talk about who's really doing business out here, it's not you. There's a big three and you're not in it. It's Melad and that fat motherfucker. You were serious. Oh my god. Oh my Lord. That is how he spoke to me. Savannah. I missed the, I missed the end. That is how he spoke of royalty. That's what I'm trying to say.


Yeah. Like a black God. Is he eating those words right now? I don dunno why he did that disgust he thought your God played about. I'm not even, I'm not even Adam. I'm not your fault, but my God still will see somebody that we don't know where It is at with him. Mm. And fix him up. Fix him. Fix him up. Hey newsflash Adam during the pandemic, everybody's numbers was up. Everything was up. Yeah. Stupid ass.


I'm gonna play the real video now. He talking about some day. Yeah. We went and bought a $4 million building because the numbers was up and we continued to think that they would project it, yada yada yada. It mistake. It was a mistake. And that's my problem. It'd be too many niggas speaking on shit. They don't know what they're talking about. That just is out here making my fucking mistake not easy after mistake after mistake. And I can't come in here and say it 'cause I'm gonna look away and the they gonna say, Joe, button you on some bullshit again. So I shut up. But I could have told y'all, hey, when 80 and all them niggas left and we found out that Adam didn't have contracts with nobody, I was like, okay, business is shady over there.


You said it. Shout to ad. Beginning of the end. Shout once we started talking about the Snapchat and YouTube and Instagram checks. Yo, I check out when niggas start talking like that too. We've built this thing in a way where the paranoia and trauma from leaving our fate in somebody's hands won't allow us to leave it in somebody's hands. So clap to you. If you leaving it in somebody's hands and it's going great for you, but one day Facebook wake up and say, Hey our vission shit, we're not doing it no more. That money you was making is outta you. Done. We're finished. One day YouTube wake up and say, hey, you're not in our little creator fund program where we're sending shit your way.


You're done. We're not even putting you in the algorithm. One day, Snapchat, TikTok one day they all wake up and say you can't plan that way. That's true. It's tough to look the fucking estate people in the face, the tax people in the face and say, Hey, I don't know that I'll make that next year. I don't know that five years from now these companies will still hold me in such high regards. They leave fast and then you get niggas sounding like this. Let's play it.


Let's fucking play it. Addition to that we have, There ain't no addition to that. Nigga Rewind November is going broke. I know that might sound crazy. It don't. In both of our YouTube channels, last month we got over 25 million views. Mad is none. We're doing Well on Facebook and Snapchat. Yeah. We employ quite a few of the hottest content creators on the west coast Means nothing. And We pump out an insane amount of content on a weekly basis. How could we be going bro? Well let's tell us we expanded too much during Covid at just about the exact moment that our revenue streams all took a hit. Yeah, No you Did. We hired a whole bunch of editors and other employees and we bought a huge office building that cost us almost 4 million thinking that the growth that we were experiencing during the pandemic was gonna continue.


Why Would it That unfortunately that did not happen. Our YouTube numbers which had doubled or even tripled, gradual Returned. Lemme pause this. My fingers are stupid. So it takes a sec. Lemme pause this. Why would you think that Adam or anybody for that matter, this is the same thing I told the stupid clubhouse people. A lot of people got gas during the pandemic. They did. Yo, a lot of people thought it was up. Some of y'all were smelling y'all own shit too much during that pandemic because you survived. You stretched your little PPP money or saw spikes in areas where you didn't normally before. Niggas ain't just survived niggas, some niggas lived thrive.


It was a little different here. Now some niggas live made money they never made before in their life. Fuck girls. They never fucked before. Drove cars. They I saw it. Yeah. Yeah, I saw it. It was a lot. And it was inflated by that. That was the time where streamers were getting extra bumps from all the different everywhere spots. You know what I mean? Why would you think that things would continue that way once people were allowed to be outside? That's a big, that's a mistake a Lot of people with too. Put too much faith in this internet shit. So in 2020 it or 2021, it did take a lot of discipline to say, whatever I made this year, I may not make, may not make it.


Or yeah, following that this may be a a a peak or a spike right now what? A year after next. Or people just didn't plan that way. Niggas is used to spending money instant before, before instant, instant burn the hole, instant hole in their pockets. Instant, instant gratification. And Also the optics, you know, he wanted to show the optics of extreme rapid growth. You know, so expanding to the bi the purchase of the building and then the huge staff and that sort of thing. Like the optics allowed him to, you know, kind of like be as boisterous as he was towards you and everybody else Exploit And the content shifted too. Nothing. Nothing. Well, yeah, and then that part, yeah, content changed. It's not just the world changed then the economy changed.


Content creation changed. The young streaming niggas came in and, and they kicked ass. They kicking ass. They they, they just released. Yeah. What Kyle made from January to February. Yeah. They busting the ass. They making it tough. Extremely tough. Tough. I ain't gonna lie. If I see this speed nigga do another back flip across my phone, I don't know what I will do. Well that nigga just job to speed, he killing it. Every time I see him, he just doing some shit that's out, out worldly at this point. Every time I see him, he doing some extra shit. He's doing a fucking flip. Nah, I just seen him walk up the, the, the endless wisdom. Some shits the love steps and the love steps in China. Yes. I'm like, yo, he just doing it side missions around the world. That's what it look like.


I mean that's, that's the wave, the main, that's the fire shit. That's, that's the wave. Yo and every field, everybody that's getting to it, getting to it, no matter what field you in part of that getting to, it has to include how you'll maneuver and function once the new kid on the block pops up. That's a fact. Nigga's never playing for the new kid. That's the problem. We never talk about that. That's the problem I'm talking about in any field, whether you in the tech world, it don't matter whether you dealing drugs, whether you in content music. Like my example of that is when the fucking rappers ran around getting the hosting brown bags in 2000 6, 7, 8, whenever that was. And then the fucking Instagram girls or the models started taking that same brown bag and bringing out a audience.


So now the rappers, why would we pay you four or five and six grand to pop up when these girls will take five, $1,500 to pop up? And I get the same s like, oh shit, what are we gonna do now? Mel can speak to it. Yeah. From, from from videos. Once them girls popped up and started taking lead roles for pennies, it it, it changed the game for y'all. Absolutely. Absolutely. Speak to it a little bit though about Well, but she didn't get pennies. You got No, no. I'm talking about they were getting pennies on a dollar. There were, there was so much change. So then they Shifted Mel out of the game. No. And didn't Mel except the exit ramp because Mel was now a television correspondent at the time. Okay. Talk That shit. That shit Mel Fuck happened.


Fuck that. I retired My motherfucking as Big Bang. Once they give you that 10 piece, max Mel saw the come in and got the fuck out. Yeah, Exactly. But the Mandy, stop it. You ain't never did no video. What was also happening at the same time was there was a dramatic restructuring of shit. Yes. You know, the music industry took a massive hit where they no longer controlled the output of their product. And so videos was the first place where you saw the budgets go from like super inflated $600,000 to like fucking $50,000 for like a Nas video, you know, a Nas in common video. It was crazy. And so you gotta get, you gotta get, you gotta get 505.


Oh yeah. You gotta get the $500 girls. Yeah. Yeah. What? Or you pay Not to say that they weren't beautiful. That is not to say, say that they weren. I'm not talking about from Dr. Well War. Oh yeah. Other places. Oh yeah, they can't, you can get the whole Dr for the five passport. Went over there and took up his music up. He took his both the Dr. Hey, come on, come on, come on. Go in the basement house. You hear from little, you hear from little X in a Y After that, after that Dr.


Shit, he took, Do I need to reiterate my last point? All right. Sorry. Sorry man. You better start playing with big mail boy. She's a legend. Yeah, she asked for 10 piece. I said, oh man, 10 piece at this time, the market is, It is looking a little shaky. So It is a little Fucked Up. Yeah. Anyway, back to my Adam clip. No Jumper Or rewind? No, we don't want to hear Rewind. Hold up. It's on our account. We got taken down one day and we still have absolutely no idea why. We've had no Luck getting I No, I fast forward far. Sorry. I'm sorry. Hold up. You jumped the line. All right, here We go. Normal. Our Snapchat and Facebook numbers, which had exploded during Covid, sometimes even hitting six figures a month, shrank by about 80% or more. Our Patreon, which was absolutely killing it for a year or two when we were doing uncensored.


AKA nude interviews with up and coming superstars like Kazumi and Sky. Bri fell off quite a bit with the launch of Plug Talk and a decreased interest in seeing us interview stars. In addition to that, you might recall that the channel took quite a hit when approximately eight of our hosts left the platform in March of 2023. Although we definitely largely recovered and managed to build up a very healthy roster of talent since then. That certainly took a toll on on our business for a while As well. It would have to, All that stuff hurt the business, but we were still solidly profitable. Tell Us how that is until the last few months where we experienced two major Ls that we never could See. Mm. L Man. First We lost the No Jumper Instagram after almost 10 years of building it up and essentially no strikes on our account.


We got taken down one day and we still have absolutely no idea why. How Could they Do that? We had no luck getting it back. Despite being in contact with what seems like every Fucking paid my light and water bill with the, with that one We were bringing in a very solid amount of cash monthly. Come on man. Keeping us afloat via selling Bought Tide die t-shirts with that Instagram. And that mostly vanished overnight. And while we've been growing the new No Jumper LA account up ever since and managing to sell sponsored collab posts using my Instagram and the No Jumper LA account dm. Oh my god. Yo. Did you say you were selling sponsored ad posts? Which is nothing wrong with you just can't look at me and fix your lips a certain way, which I don't think he knew a little a few years ago.


Hopefully he knows it now. Sponsor Jesus. There's nothing wrong with that. No, No. There's nothing wrong with that. But I would be shocked if I ever saw you do a Sponsor. No, you would be more than shocked. No, I'm gonna call you. I might come to the cri. You would be more than shocked. You need something. I would get an emergency text, a wellness check. Facts would need to be done. What is going on? If you just looked on my shit and seen, sometimes I go to skims. Skims is a really great place if I hit the little button on that thing. Also, if you're listening out there, the other day I went to Skims, I was wondering in the mall, yo, I went from Apple where It is nice and quiet and then I was doing some shit with my girl.


I'm like, Hey, you wanna go check it out? She was like, yeah. So a couple doors down we walk in skims, which is not quiet at all. No. Their atmosphere in ambiance is very different from Apple. It was like Anos in GSP. Yes. If you walk in there, be prepared. They don't show. We was looking for shit. You maybe need earmuffs and it by the Egg store. Yes. You walk in there that she said, Don, Don, Don. Don't, don't Don. Are you fucking crazy nigga? I'm blow hoodie it lot, nigga. I'm here for some drugs. It's a lot, nigga. Yeah, It is like a cave built in there.


Mm. It's mad workers that like look like they could be a Kardashian. Maybe one lone black security at the top. You ain't there with your girl in the humbug. They like Don Don Don Young dog. I'm just want some drawers. A lot. We doing a lot a lot in there, nigga. Anyway. Does it make you wanna buy? We we Left. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like A lot. We left you didn't, real quick side note, you didn't See that Walgreens of seven 11 were playing classical music to keep blacks from homeless people from sitting outside. And they said it worked.


That's crazy. Hold up. They played opera outside. Usually they play classical. Usually they play classical music and opera music to keep like the kids from loitering. Nah, Nah. 'cause Canada did that with our, like our, our transit system. Like the trains and shit like that. Yo Mel, I couldn't believe that shit worked. Toronto, they played something regular. The homeless man was sitting there asleep. They play opera music. That shit was clear. That whole shit was clear. That's a I didn didn didn't know shit like that worked. But yeah, Joe, I'm sorry. And no, I'm, I'm following your lead and fuck y'all cities out there that are voting to put, to have to be anti homelessness with spikes. So y'all are building spikes?


Yeah. All throughout your fucking ecosystem. That's ridiculous. They got a dark. Yes. They remove, they just putting spikes up in places where people would lay or could lay. Yeah. Cement spikes. Cement bench. I mean Spike benches put on A bench. Yep. Yeah. Or they'll put the spikes. So you know how a bench, it'd be like, like three people could sit on the bench, right? Yeah. Yeah. They'll put spikes in the middle. So just two people could sit. Right. Basically nobody could lay down On it. Wow. So like you'll sit, somebody will sit here, spikes in. Yeah, I've seen all that shit. They got that shit in Newark right off the highway. Are they making alternate options for the homeless people? Because I don No, they're not. They're about to start criminalizing it. A lot of people, a lot of homeless people don't want to go into the shelters and place that the provided, they said they don't wanna go in there.


They don't, whatever's happening there, they don't want to go. They prefer to sleep in the street. They don't want to go. I Mean, they wanna go underground in LA in that little tunnel shit. I'm about to go there. They wanna go underground. That little secret whole shit that they stay in. They want to be, they wanna just roam free. And then when they provide shelter, they don't want to go in there for whatever reason. Well, when you go to la, why don't you ask that? Because I think that there's a reason why a lot of unhoused people do not wanna go to the shelters. We, and I think that for like women, I think that a lot of, you know, sa happens in there. So you know, there's definitely Took it to a Dark place. No, I'm sorry, but there's definitely a reason why We're talking about, you just can't. I'm Sorry, we're talking about homelessness then Gotta Talk about all the back.


But back to back to kicking Adam's. Do you know we was talking about homelessness? You trying to slip it into trying to talk. That's What she said, by the way. Anyway, A lot of women get girl. Okay. Anyway, this is a family happy Show. Back to kicking Adam's back in. Go ahead. Okay, but no, before we get get to Adams kicking Adams back in and before we get to our prize prize, gang, you coming? I'm coming, I'm coming. But on the topic of homelessness, I must continue to spoil the show. Good American family.


For anyone that's listening, go ahead. If you are not caught up, hit the little 15, skip 15 second skip button a few times. If you don't care, then listen to what they did now to this little dwarf bitch. Because the show was so great. I told y'all I went back and watched the real shit a few times. So I'm all the way caught up. But in a new episode of the show, they got the girl re aged was re aged. Re aged is when we adopted her. All of the paperwork that we got was faulty. It was fake.


Okay. Yeah. So we think that she's older than what she is, which is part of the scan that she's running. She's in here saying that she's fucking nine and she's 21. Alright. But she has dwarfism and she's trying to kill us. So they got her re aged. So she's 22 now. And now that she's 22, now that she's 22, you can live on your own. Oh yeah, you gotta go. So we're, so they rented a home. Yeah, I remember all this from the dock for her. They rented a home for her. Yes, she And put her in there. But allegedly. And they didn't get to this part in the show, but in real, in the real story.


It wasn't a disabled friendly home. Like it was like in the hood. Yeah, it was a really bad crib. That one was too. So they put her in there. I ain't mad at this so far, but they're still the legal guardian of her. Why she an adult now? Because they getting a check because she's still disabled. Oh, okay. Okay. It's for the check. Got it. They, they get the check and she's still disabled a little bit, but they in there letting the water go off. They let the electricity go off. Since my girl is confused about how these people ended up going to jail or, or getting charges. Okay. You can't do that. You cannot, you can't do any of this. Do that. You can't. So that's it. Watch it and remember that it's not funny or very funny.


Potentially something. It is the funniest shit in the world. But It is time for my favorite part of the show. Pride Space. All

She do need to follow up with a, with a A proper vision.


I'm offered, I'm offered a Sexyy Red bandwagon. Oh sorry Larry. I'm phony. When they talk about fickle fans, it's me. It's me. When did you jump off the bandwagon? What? What was the last record that you know how like you, you know how like if you lose your phone and you stay without your phone for like a week or two? No then you start to feel it. Yeah. When you get your phone back, all that shit seemed like degenerate shit you was doing. Yeah and that's where I stand with Sexyy Red currently. Again, I may not be the demo them other songs was kind of a little undeniable to me and Momentum just builds right?


Yeah. I think today people take for granted I think they treat it like a light switch almost. And I think that the entitlement with some certain artists, y'all shouldn't treat this like a light switch. Y'all should try to continue to build and build and build. So Sexyy Red kind of killed then went away, tried to cross over like they all do with that Bruno Mars bullshit. It didn't connect. Disappeared. And now you back with the ghetto degenerate shit. Nah, you sleeping on my fan. Fear for me. Me because Bruno should have Ang nigga for me. You sleeping on my fan Fear. Yeah, I right this second where I'm at, where the economy is with what I'm trying to do. Again, I may not be the demo. That ain't what I'm trying to hear right now.


And again I'm not expecting substance from her but gimme something that when me and my girl call some bitches over like I could do it. That ain't going, that ain't gonna do it Fox. But See it, see it will do it. It just might not be for the type of chicks that y'all are calling over. That's kind of what I'm saying. Like I don't think this, it's not a bad song. If you listen to Sexyy Red, if you're familiar with her catalog. No, that chorus is disgusting. It Is Right. That chorus is disgusting. Think her saying her pussy pink and a booty hole brown wasn't disgusting. No I thought it was fire. I thought it was fire. That's because it was new. I thought it was artistic. I thought it was eclectic. I thought it was creative. Yeah because that was, I thought it was different Because it was new and different. Now I'm a artist. You asking me, I'm giving you my artist take on it. I thought it was all of those things that I just named.


I didn't think it was disgusting. But now if you repeatedly keep chasing That this ain't, this ain't fire. See I think simple shit can be fire. I think simple shit that has no business. Being on a song could be fire but we ain't about to just blurt a line. Y'all can't just throw shit at a wall now and say Hey this is my hot chorus. That's like my other hot chorus from a person that don't know how to write choruses. No, go get your same writing team. Go get whoever the fuck was helping you before. But nah you're not about to play with my fan Fear like this, play that hook again. Play it again because my voice and my tone and my just how I speak always sounds like I'm on bullshit. But play it again. Play it again.


Turn it off. I'm telling you that a few years ago when I went to my step kids' Sweet 16, there was a Sexyy Red playlist. Right. That tore the night up. This ain't going in there. This ain't going in that for me. I don't see it. You, You, you. I don't see it. I get it, I get it. I see this going in that playlist. I'm also old and I can shut the fuck up too. Like I don't need my opinion. Like I said, I just, because I don't like the song, I'm not on the Sexyy Red bandwagon anymore. Don't mean I can't acknowledge that she's making music for a specific demo. Who really fucks With this. See I look at that different as a musician and I ain't, I'm here to talk today 'cause my brother called out.


Yeah. I'm here to talk about some shit as a musician. I have to start looking at the people that aren't musicians. Like they aren't musicians. Oh then you, that's so it ain't, it ain't your ear, it ain't your palette. It ain't your eye, it ain't your taste. It ain't your your juice. It ain't your feng shui that's doing it. You are relying on whatever you're relying on. So if you don't have all of those same variables with you, whatever same shit was working in the universe on your next go, I just can't rely on you to deliver me the product that made me a fan of you because you're leasing it. She's leasing it. I get that. I'm going a spade a spade.


She's leasing it. Whatever this is ain't from them. I ain't, I ain't seen a credit. I can assure you it ain't from the same people that was there before. And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong but just off hearing it. Ah nah. Okay, now she fucks with my people so I, I hope that they do well. But enough of y'all just force feeding ghetto bullshit to black people because we fucking listened to it and this is our hood and this is our shit. 'cause when you cleaned up, when you went over there with Bruno Mars, I'm a little mad at her actually. I'm a little mad at her. Don't come back over here with this degenerate shit. After you tried to go clean up with Bruno Mars and it didn't work. Don't do that. Nope. See I I get that. I get that. I ain't doing it. I'm not mad at that. I ain't doing it Because if it, I gotta go back to What works I got, I tried something different.


Like I always say about artists, I want you to try My fan Fear is not second tier. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not mad at nobody trying my fan Fear is not second tier. So you feel like she abandoned her core group? She did what everybody did to good to she did what bitches do and what And what artists do. Nah, you gonna make me cake for her now. Now I don't want came For. But that's what she did. She did. I could see if she did a whole project of that. She did one song. So I tried something. So that don't mean I abandoned everybody with one song. No, there's a lot of numbers between zero and a hundred. There's a lot of numbers between zero and a hundred Bro. She kept her image the same. She kept her, she was still doing all the ratchet shit in her pictures. She did not. Well we Clean up to say that because we didn't see a successful image built around that song with Bruno that blocks it didn't work.


But I know but the intention remains the same. The intention remains the same And no, as a artist, listen, I'm not telling everybody else how to view it, but niggas that make music and niggas, that's into the artistry of it. No, you don't get to just treat the audience that built you up as some abandoned foster kid when you have other motives. No, you Don't get to do that. I don't see it anymore. Sorry. Sexyy Red again. We, we going to disagree on that. I don't See that she did that. Yeah, But we done, it's not here for us to disagree because what I'm stating is facts fuck how I feel about it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. The facts of the matter is you started at Zero, built your shit up with ghetto black classics and your image was having everybody look at you like, did she really just put that bullshit, that ghetto, nasty fucking hood project shit in a song.


That was her image. That's that's a fact. She tried to go a different route. I say altogether, if y'all hear that Bruno song and think that that's in the same vein as what she was doing and not at all, I'm not at all she But she tried to do something else. Correct. It did not work. This was her Starship Nicky moment. Is it Starship I'm thinking about? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Everybody get a wake up call. This is hers. So granted when you come back, it gotta be with heat. It can't be with that. I'm back to farting on the record. It go fart on it. And now we just did it, eat it up. Now my dollar today in this economy and this system, my fan fear is worth more than that. So what You, you for me? Go ahead. Go ahead. You Have an issue anyway with, with, with people pushing that type of agenda or on or thinking that that type of ghetto talk applies to black people in my forties all you had an issue with that in the beginning when you first started talking about the situation with Red, you expressed that like, yo, why, why does it have to be like that?


Or why do they think that we gonna consume this because we black or where we come from. It is about black people. We built, we built this shit and then you started to like murder records and you started to, and now you back to what you were saying again where It is like, yo, you came back over here and then now you wanna do this ghetto shit because you think that it's aligning with black people or how we live. It ain't, and honestly it's a lot of ghetto hood booger chicks that like this shit. That's what I'm saying, that see themselves in Sexyy Red. She's speaking for into a group and they exist and They Love it. Listen buddy, I don't, I ain't, I ain't the old hater at the party. I'm minding my business. You are. I'm just telling you how I feel about what I'm seeing from this.


So what do you say? But I'm minding my business. So lemme ask you a question. Get money. What Do you say to the artist? But just know that that's where we at now. We at a bunch of people that nobody knows diddly fuck about just coming in because there's no gatekeepers, there's no barrier of interest. Of course. It's just a bunch of people coming in, getting money. So can't nobody be mad anytime a musician step up and say, Hey this is funny. It don't matter because we not in musician land. We in Jake Paul exhibition land. Mm. We in exhibition land. So I don't have nothing to say. I don't have nothing to say Get what The times we get what the times. Like I said, I I I, excuse me. I asked from a lot of artists, I asked that I want to hear you try something different.


You get what I'm saying? I've said it about people that I am big fans of. Like, all right dog, you you making the same song or the same album over and over and over and over. It's almost unfair because the second you try to do something different and it don't work, we ready to kill you For it. So it's like, which which way? You can't have it both ways. Either you want somebody to stay the same, never change and just stay here or you try to evolve, try to adapt and then you have to have a fallback in case that don't work. I encourage everybody out there listening to not listen to me when it comes to matters pertaining to music. I am old and grumpy. You might be lit trying to have fun.


My ears just don't hear it that way anymore. I'm sorry, lemme ask. So, so, so when, when the, when the, when the rapper tries to go into the singing harmonizing lane right? That It is still along the rapping lane to you. Like I was just thinking about something I may be off like when I was thinking about DMX just now and then I, when he, he was rapping one way and then he went to politicking with the chicken one in there. If I could creep a little hood, red Chick 25th, like is that along the same lines of his repertoire, that type of, or like when he started to harmonize and sing you could like say that he was trying something new. He always, He was always izing and singing a little bit. But from where my dog's at and all that stuff, it, it wasn't, it wasn't because I remember like hearing that, hearing the Ruff Ryders anthem and then going into that and like the pain song and catering to the women and stuff like that.


So like is that, is that trying something new to you Joe? Or that's just, if I understand your question Correct. Rogers Got some harmonic melodic shit happening in it too. Not for nothing. I don't even, I don't even want to offend DMX by putting him in the same Paul. No I'm not boat as you today. Niggas y'all ain't that. I understand. I y'all, none of y'all are that. I don't think they expect that much of a departure. Absolute megastar. Yes. Yes, Joe. So to Mel's point it did, it never felt like a departure because get at Me Dog was a club song in Jersey City. Yes. Stop Being Greedy was a club song also Melos In there too. Yeah. Look, look through my asses on that album. Got it. Okay. No, I'm just, and the first couple tracks on, that's the, when he dropped two albums in the same year.


I think the first two tracks on part two is fucking club records. That's when Swiss was in his Ain't No way you're doing this. Yeah, That's, that's ain't No Way. So second album, he grew and evolved into that. But it, IX never felt forced to me. No. Wasn't forced. Okay. No, I know you never felt but I was just, I'm sorry. Yeah. And I still, I still want that megastar smoke with Parks. I listen to episode that shit don't sit right with me. Why? Because it ain't no megastar and it ain't no superstars. And all the stars that you named were stars from the era that I'm talking about. What You said Beyonce, you said Drake, you said Kendrick, you said Cole, but you said you said Jay-Z The argument that we had was that you don't stop, no one stops None of world.


I'm saying none of these niggas are stars or have starlike qualities they fooling us Into of the new of the new generation. Yes. What Cardi is the star from? What year are you counting Playboy. Cardi is the star From What year are you counting when you say this? 2010. 20. Well if we be in technical then you probably saying 2015 and beyond. 'cause that's the last 10 years. Okay. But, but we owed, so I'll put it to 2010. Drake is from 2010. He's, He's pretty Kendrick Cole, all that big three shit is from yeah, 2010. If you want to claim Travis. Travis, yeah, for sure. 2016 plus he's That. Yeah, at 15 plus really The weekend future Might be The weekend future.


His stardom came, he started three. But my point is, we about to start struggling In music. Three more names. That's my point. Yeah. And whatever the superstar is today, it just don't mean or have the same, You're talking about just hip hop Or overall Well I'm talking about hiphop. Okay. I'm talking about rap. Rap superstars. Because we should be, we should be allowed to have, if you're talking about Just rap, then Yeah, I'm just talking about rap. Yeah, It is. It is. I'm just talking about rap. There's, There's no superstars like young superstars over the last 10 years. And I mean how much faith do we have in the farm system? None right now. None I any right this second. None. Because anybody that's lit in popping is gonna just do it on their own, which is gonna bypass the superstar system and There's no longevity in it.


Now you hot, you lit all of that today. Nobody's getting the, the People ain't really playing for longevity. They not, no, not at The company's not Either said that or it ain't. Even just The artists, the companies are not playing for longevity. We want You right now, If they are playing for longevity, they're playing independent or independent adjacent longevity. Which is not the superstar model. Right? Well we talk. Yeah. Like no, I'm gonna have my fan base, I'm gonna rock out, make x amount of dollars per year and I'm good with that To, to me, to me it did not even building stars anymore or building the artist. That's what I think that's missing. When I was watching it as a child or as a teenager, there was, there was things leading up to an artist and it was like a buildup that you can see.


Photo shoots, different things going outside. Being being a part. Different programs. Yeah. There were things that were going into building the artist now because of how internet, the internet has taken over in social media. Attention span. It's just that and attention span is short. It's just like that. Yep. Everybody Wants everything right now. Yeah. For free instantly. So A and s come on, come back outside nigga you can't, they can't go to the ai. No jobs led. There's no build. I don't give a fuck. Nigga come up with your own shit. And who wants These artists nigga go find a nigga from 40 projects, build them up, let 'em rap, clean them up.


Who gonna hear 'em? We are How? And it's just gonna be tough. 'cause whoever they build up shout to 40, It is not gonna necessarily give a fuck about music. What? What do you think they're gonna care about? Street shit. Whatever they want. It just won't have to be music. Like Cardi. I hate to bring her up 'cause she'll shoot at me, but Cardi was the last person that I looked at like, okay, they building a star. Yes. But when the star is just a star, not necessarily a music star, they could say, fuck music, I'm a star already. Right. Well that's And not really have to rely on music to be a star. She's just a star. That's the other side though. A lot of people look at music as a stepping stool to the stardom. Yeah. So it's like I can do this In music, get hot enough to where I could leave.


Not saying Cardi, just in general, music ain't the end all be all. No more. Like now it's I want to have a brand, I wanna do this. I It is exit they they in the exiting just a lot faster than we used to. For sure. That that that's, I'll say that. I Will say this has been a slow year. Last year was a great year for hip hop music. It was, this year has been Like me and like Joe said the other day, nigga rock and roll coming back. Rock and roll pop. It is over. Pop is coming. I mean it's early. It Is. It Is. Only April. Usually you get a spring something by now. I think they about to start dropping. Personally I think if you want to have something to run through the summer, now's the time. So What run through the summer, why That was a thing bro.


You see the pop artists are still getting developed. Yes. There's still money being put into the artists that build them up. I'm seeing them everywhere. Yeah. So what happened to hip hop? So how can where the A andrs that's putting together for them something that something is happening with them. When I watch, for me to even come up with this opinion I came up with, You know what I mean? There's money being put in them. They're being billed, they're being everywhere. Their faces are shown. They're doing things that make it look like there's something behind 'em and make you interested in not only the music but the person. Right. Nowadays when you become interested in the person in hip hop, it lacks, they lack the, the music is lackluster. You don't become interested in the music.


You become interested in the person and then, and then when they not able to show who they are or keep our attention, then it just falls into the side. It seems like you underst I'm saying Paul, they Wanna follow with developing the person connection that you're talking about in the past 10 years is someone that's gonna wild out online or be violent or have some drama going on in their life. And that doesn't lead to a long life, let alone long artist career. True And shit. Going back to the no jumper, like all the people that they kind of brought out and put a face to, that whole infrastructure is taking hits. Yeah. Yeah. It looked like he was hiring a lot of niggas that couldn't even ponder a different brand company to get their white tees from.


Yeah. Like somebody, sometimes you just been wearing your white tees for so long, you say, you know what, that's try this other brand right here. It's $3 more. You just stay in your little fruit of moon. It is the nigga. It is the one from the pack. It is the one from from the store. Some of them niggas can't get the five one from Chinatown. Some of them can't get the five pack is what it was looking like. I can't say it 'cause it's mean. But some of them look like nevermind shout to no drum man and you don't play. You niggas failed thoughts and prayers to them. But you just said it ain't fair. You say he's switching it up. So let's see, let's see the play. Well not this thing as a failure because of failure. We not counting failures.


Like Gianni said, every failure leads to the next success the feds get. But until you find that success, yeah we not gonna get crazy. Failure is a part of the game when you're trying to succeed. So we not highlighting bullshit but until you find that next thing that succeeds, don't keep pouring me to death. That ain't gonna get it with me. That worked on nothing nigga. Yeah, but here's here's the thing that working on them that ain't working on me. That ain't working on them no more. I never thought you and your fucking queen was reeling them in from around the corner at the line wrapped around the block. I didn't think that. No I didn't. Yo you gotta be more in tune than just trying to get niggas off the street or that's actively inside outside just to get a story.


I stay all the time. It's hard to sell one of anything. Yeah, you gotta be more in tune. See if you was in tune, see when I did that whole stink of the gang life on flip the script, I became in tune. I knew when to go in and back out because you become in tune with what's going on outside. See, a lot of times niggas just try to present the story because of the clickbait. But that goes by so far. So now when the Fed is kicking the door and questioning you and now when you're a person that's not from outside, being involved with niggas is that's outside. It is gonna hurt your pockets. Now you have to restructure and redo things. This hey get it done, get it done off your own back. Get bitch ass nigga. Not I really a bitch ass nigga. 'cause I ain't gonna be for him but I'm just for dramatic. For dramatic.


He head this us get. Yeah, but it's not about that. It's about get it done on your own fucking merit. I say that all the time about you niggas out there that can't stand alone. And every time I say it, nobody know what I mean. You need, It is pretty cool now we went out together the plus shut the fuck up nigga the fuck up enough now of niggas. You niggas pass me them bullets man. When you don't have good looking a gang member to just start spilling gang tea, like this was not a fucking game plan that was gonna be affected for long.


What's the nigga named? Young Loch? I don't know where he is loose Kenny. But I heard a story from him about everything under God's son on the internet for the last two months. And when you don't have Dak you gotta figure it out. See that don't disappear now that the fucking feds come. That's the part that make me mad. No dirty BMX white boy. No. You figure out how to get it going without the gang members making it hot because let me, which is the point we were trying to prove when the fuck you came up here. Let me tell you something. The niggas that stood around God rest his soul, Irv Gotti that stood around when the Fed come stood in it in the thick of it, nigga in the thick, you gotta be made from a certain cloth nigga quilt.


I told you all these niggas was down bad. Is Terry cloth good? They ain't bought a new fucking pair of jeans, shorts and ages. All them little cool hippie la stores that they buy vans from. It ain't been a new pair of vans on Adam 22 in a long time. It is bad. It's bad. And while he may not be broke, there are signs that, but yo, you know what, there are signs that we making sure we fixing some things so we cannot go. We we gotta highlight the niggas that end up doing it on their own. Like, like like the fig immunity niggas, the adss and shit like that back on Fig. They went did it on their own and they keeping the numbers up and they keeping it together. I'm highlight, I'm highlighting Shout out to the brothers. All niggas that that yes that can't be pushing that didn't have nothing dirty to say about the platform, about Joe Button on the platform highlighting anybody.


Yeah, we love y'all. It's tough. Yeah, it's tough at what's up. I say it all the time. The shit is tough out there no matter who you are. Yeah It is. So we want to handle everybody like we are aware that shit is tough. It's not. But the niggas that be talking a certain way that we applaud when they learn how this thing goes. That's all. That's a little slow clap. It's just a little slow clap. That's it. I do think he'll get it together. Some niggas know what they're doing. He'll get it together. But it truly does. Oh man. Sorry. Shout to him. Sorry. He'll figure it out. You got it man. Niggas had a blast when I was sleepwalking naked.


They thought they thought that was gonna get it done. No nigga, y'all know better than that. I go, I go out and get it done. You gotta go out and get it done. Resilience.

I'm saying lucky in the sense of they did not revoke him. His Attorney's response was, let's assume everything that the prosecutors are saying is true.


It's still not a violation of any parole or probation. My thing is, you're bringing unnecessary attention to yourself by doing this. That's all. What if he, what If he's just in his crib being the law abiding citizens for, I don't know, probation. He just wanna get shit off his chest. And what if he made a phone call? That's me. What if he made a phone call prior to posting that? Asking, Hey, is this in violation? Like most niggas would do? No. Cool. I'm not. Listen. So if he made that call and his and his lawyer says, nah, you good. You can post it. You're not in violation of everything, then post it. That ain't for me to come and say, all right, you're threatening the line. No, I'm, I'm not, I'm not saying he's threatening the line. I'm saying even in po Even if your lawyers say, your lawyers should say, why do you wanna do that?


Why do you even want to Attempt fate? Yes. That's my point. Why poke the barrier? Poke the the bear. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. I in this instance, why do you even wanna go down that road? Yes, you can do it. You can get away with it. They're gonna try to revoke you. I can beat it. Let's say the lawyer said all of that. Why do you then even want that attention? I don't. That's what I, I just, I don't understand. When I heard the story and I saw the tweet. When I first saw the tweet, I said, why the hell would he, was he hacked? Please be hacked. Please be hacked. Sometimes You just wanna fight the system, yo. Yeah. I ain't gonna, sometimes you just rebellious. You're not thinking of it that way. Okay. Cop was looking Fight when I was 33. I was like, this is where I'll be fuck y'all for even saying y'all was looking for me. I'm not hiding.


Like it was just rebellious. Just stupidness. Like sometimes you can not fully think out the fucking repercussions for your actions. I got, I guess I I I, because I don't wanna feel like I'm arguing with you. He has been moving in a way where it's like, Hey brother. That's all I Saying. Like I don't want to That's true. I also don't want to have to put it on a lawyer to then force somebody to behave a certain way. Lawyer's job is to protect me no matter how I'm behaving, whatever I'm doing. Yeah. So if he's like, you're not in violation, lemme go about my day then, then that's what It is. And listen, non story here, he's not in violation. Yeah, yeah. True. It is over. True. They're gonna, they're gonna keep trying to get him.


They are. So It is not the last time we'll talk about this, I'm sure. Yeah, Yeah. True indeed. What else? What else, what else? What else? Lemme see. Lemme see. Lemme see. You wanna do John Marette? Let's kind along the same lines, kinda along the same lines. I don I don't understand again. Me neither. It is a story. Just don't get it. What happened? Who, who were they playing? Who cares? Yeah. Yeah. Don, about Okay, We don't Care. Celebration heat powow Pow in the air. Hit the game with her And, and, and sprays the bench With And y'all don't have to do it on this show. Oh Pardon. Okay. But yeah. Does does the, Does the gesture? The gesture. The Gun Gesture. Gun hand gesture.


Oh, got it. Okay. All right. And then the NBA told him to please not do that. And then the next game, he did it within the first four minutes of the game. Yeah. That's what the story is on JA Moran. Yes. There are other players that are doing some variation of a gun gesture, But, but they didn't have The NBA didn't have that same talk with all of these players. I do think that at some point the NBA needs to take a stand in it like the NFL did and say these are the gestures that are not, not allowed until they do that, they're gonna have this problem of why can't Austin Reeves do it? But I can't do it Be because we've, like you said, Because we told you told you you had cases with the little white Boys. You had real guns And you have real guns twice.


Yeah. Like you just got suspended last year for this. Yeah. But people that have real guns still have rights. So if it's not okay for me, then it's not okay for anybody else that does it. Well that's a mistake that people think the rules don't always apply to everybody the same. Well that's true. That's a fact. And the sooner we understand that, The better can can be. Listen in in my story. Yeah. Ja Morant is mad and has been mad about his, what is the term? The, I don't wanna say erasure. His Decline. Not decline. 'cause he's still one of the best players In the league. They shifted the focus. Yeah. But we, We talking about the but the NBA clearly has shifted focus and are not thinking about him.


Ain't trying to make you a star. You're not the story. We barely get an interview from him that Hold the face of the NBA stuff. All of that stay off. It is the first In my brain. He, Ben felt away about that. Okay. So his Behavior for me is kind of on par with someone that is mad at the league. Even his response to the league. Yeah. It is like, listen, other people are doing this. If I, I'm gonna continue to be talked about negatively no matter what I do and I'm sick of it, so, so let Me do negative shit. Right. Listen, I'm just telling you what he said in his reply. I'm too old for this shit. Yeah, Yeah. I don't, That's all I'm understood. Like I just, I I hear this shit and I'm just like, dude, why The grizzlies was sexy when the league was pumping y'all.


Now that they not like I don't give a fuck about what Zach Agni Agni is doing. Sorry. I don't care about what the grizzlies doing. Oh yeah. And they just fired the coach. Yeah. Like they got shit going on over there. That's not my business. Right. Not my business. Then he tweets out J this J that. Do we want to talk about Aisha Howard putting out a statement? Yes, we do. Yes. Yeah. And I want to hear my sister's opinion on this. You wanna talk about Aisha Howard putting out a statement. Let me pull up the statement. That was, damn Corey little soup smell good as hell. Whatever he Over man Corey smell the fuck is that nigga Is that men? That's, that's Progresso. Think Corey got Progresso in the can.


All right. Aisha Howard is little baby's baby mom. Also the young lady that is Anthony Edwards baby mom that the whole Anthony Edwards debacle gate has been going on about, about, there was a rumor going on on the internet saying that he paid the million dollar plus in child support all up front 5,000 per month. She came out and debunked that at the same time she was debunking it. I was talking to my girl debunking it too. No way that the girl is agreeing to that buddy. That is not how this works. If any of y'all out there think that Anthony Edwards would be able to just pay the million dollar plus whole 18 years upfront, you got this game all you did not factor in the swimming classes buddy.


Oh, you did not think about karate. Fuck That. Not only Didn't think about Insurance, did you think about school daycare care. Hey, in four years the girl get to come and hit you back up. And then in a few years after that she get to come hit you back up again. And, and I'm gonna shut up. Hey, hey. Because I'm blessed In the supermax, Tom, Listen, I'm blessed. So I want to shut up about it. Just know there is no world that she was letting him pay a million dollar 18 years, $5,000 a month upfront at one time. That was never happening. I don't know if it changed, if it's like different state to state. But like I've heard guys say when they tried to pay more than the monthly, they wouldn't, they wouldn't allow them to do it.


No. They have to every month this amount until Use their shoulder to lien on What's that? To shoulder the lien. You don't wanna talk about it. They they were, they was confiding in you. No. They were Upset at they child's mom. No, They were not confiding in me. No. Hey, big mail I don't wanna talk about, I don't wanna tell who the source is, but Big mail. That's just, that was to my understanding. So I Yeah, Sometimes they don't allow it. Where's Where did this information come from? But he paid it all in one shot. Just on the internet. The internet. Cohor. Okay, got it. Yeah. Cohor. Yeah, but let's hear her. She Deb bumped that fast. Okay, what'd she say? Oh, alright, let me get it. I order some big mikes, some Jersey mike nigga. What nigga you want me ordering fool while we broadcasting?

I've also station that there are just certain allegations that I will never, ever beat with you guys. Talk to him. I came into the situation with the status because I have a child by a very successful artist. You've been her, right? What's her status? A little Baby, baby. From then I, That's, that's the status I'm viewed as I'm someone, a certain type of woman because I'm beautiful and I have a nice Body. That's true. You see my body.

And now that I am in yet another situation where a now have A child about some successful man With another successful man. Come on, talk To Him. There is no telling you guys that I'm not a gold digger. No. You guys, it It is it. I've also come to realization that there are just certain allegations that I will never, ever beat with you guys. You beating those allegations at all. I don the only thing that irritates me is Talk to Aisha.


She about to go off the ledge. I read comments that say, Oh, you're Old dig. Or you Can't always stop from the comments. Here it comes. She about to go off. She Should have said this. What if I came to y'all's pages? Right. Oh, that, that's a mistake. And I compare aboard the men that you have children with what? To the men that I have children with. What? And I said, Hmm. Oh shit. You saying this, You were digging for poverty. No. Said that You kept that baby for a extra income tax credit, didn't you? Or you kept that baby holy shit for a couple extra a hundred dollars.


I shocked in food stamps, didn't you? Or you No beating though, or you kept that baby for an extra section eight voucher is that you kept your baby. You cannot say that. Now If that was triggering, that's how I feel. Every time somebody says, do you even love that baby? I got a headache. I'm too old for this shit. Yeah. Cliff, was that the video you were talking About? Yep. Disgusting. What do you gotta say, man? The fuck About her? Not, not, not, I mean that's disgusting to me.

She's pretty, I'd never seen her before. I was like, oh wow, she's really beautiful. She does look good. I mean, so like that could be part of the allure. What You think it could be. Why it keeps happening. You like Her voice? Hmm. You know, we like the voice That, that voice is very, that baby voice. That's What get 'em. That's seductive in the boys whispering in your ear. Does anyone else have anything to say? I say this shit is on this matter.


Disgusting bro. It's disgusting. That's What I, that comment I said commentary was, was that was nasty. Wild. Like, you know what you're doing, huh? You know what you're doing. Why is it nasty? Come on calling, Calling other people's progeny, fucking section eight babies. Like that shit was fucking so out of pocket. She's basically confirming what we all thought a a lot of. But she's a gold digger. A lot of us thought, You know what I mean? She's confirming that. And you didn't, you haven't, you have, even though they don't wanna say it, you having the baby for a reason, period. That's it. And that's what she confirmed to me. At the same time. Like, this woman is 38, this kid is 23 years old. A lot of people were on this case saying that he wanted to pay up front and he wanted, he didn't want to have anything to do with the baby because, and, and rightfully so.


And it's her choice to keep it. 'cause you know, her thing is, I'm 38, I'll never know when this miracle will happen again. Cool. But then she just doubled down on bullshit that niggas confirm and niggas just don't stand with that. I'm not gonna say rightfully so. As if he should continue the behavior. I'm, I'm not gonna say that right far. So meaning that hi. It is rightfully so. Meaning that he's allowed and entitled to feel how he wants to feel. And the same thing with her. Yeah. I'm not shaming his right. Yeah. He does have the right to not want to be a part of. I just don't think that's a right. That he should continue to exercise. I agree. 'cause like I love kids and things. Yeah. Because kids, at the end of the day way my dad should be around, I'm a father. I'm not a daddy, I'm a father. I, I'm mean my children's life. So Amen. They live with so what I'm saying, that's not what I'm saying.


I mean these things come up and when you hear about these, but look how she responded. Right? He probably was familiar with the situation from the jump that this would be the reason that she wants to keep the baby. Right. Why you like busting raw pu inside a chick like this pu pussy be good and you think that, but you whisper already have a track record of doing this when they whisper in your ear the baby to oh come in. All that freak shit splash. That's literally splash waterfall literal, literally he could have avoided all this bullshit to me by not dropping Dick off and seed as well. Yeah man. All I'm gonna be respect we could, I'm just, I'm saying y'all know my sticks. You the game.


No, you Don don't even know the game. You know the game. No, I don, I was never part of that game. No, I didn't say that. Stop it. You ain't tell nigga off. You ain't tell nigga Splash motor ball. Niggas was trying to trap nigga about that. We ain't talking about niggas was trying to trap that big thing nigga. Of course man. I'll stop it. Mel. Niggas was trying to trap you. Mel.

You're not talking about me. I don't want you to do no more video shoots. I'm gonna take you from here to there.


Fuck sake. Join this. Okay. You're, this is what I want to tell this young lady. She's not young. Yeah. Young is subjective and I fuck with her. But hearing people speak it'd be like, all right, all right. I hear that thing that, you know, we listen and we judge facts. I hear that thing that makes us judge right. Where it's like, okay, we a little, let's handle with care and Grace and treat this person with some sensitivity. That's what I heard in that one. Two, the gold digger comments came up with Lil Baby two for reasons that, I won't say It is a little 10 year age gap there, but it was some other reasons to where that came up at.


I'm not gonna say 'em three. It never pans out when the pretty girls say It is so tough being pretty, it doesn't, it never pans out. Well when they say that it doesn't because the response to yo I'm pretty so I'm gonna get a successful millionaire dude. Is there are successful millionaire dudes in your age range as well. So if you're that pretty, if why are they off the table? Like it's dismissive to what people are saying about why they're calling you, what they're calling you.


Which is you seem to be targeting. Targeting and crediting. Praying. Praying. The wording. Anding. It is crediting. I like crediting. It's not a, It is not a word but okay It is now. We got now. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. You seem to be crediting in a way where like double down. Yeah. It's like, come on Ma, come on, come on. That's all I got. I'm minding my business as kids involved. But she's just stop replying all stuff. But then when the kids get older and See that, you know, hopefully she paid the money to erase all these videos off the internet. She won't be able to do that. Nobody ever does that. What you talking about Video ain The internet. Just explain it to the kids. What you talking, there's a lot of niggas that scrubbed the internet. I can't say it. What nigga got caught with a from?


Well nobody but Terrence J. There was another nigga, there was another nigga that that from the town. That's my shout to Terrance. But that was on the internet. He got caught with one of them. That shit is gone. That video's gone. Mm. It's gone. You can pay that top dollar to scrub the internet. Mm. Y'all ever had to scrub the internet of anything? I wish nigga shit, I wouldn't scrubbed from that. Hell Yeah. Old tweets nigga. I had to scrub it. You paid? No I did it myself. Oh yeah. Alright. Here's a few things that's really unimportant but it's the weekend so I gotta get it off my chest while I can. Okay. Okay, Let's Hit. Yes sir.


Take number one from me. I think that they should let Tani gamble on sports. Okay. Why? Why? Because look at him. If you're that good you should just be allowed to do what you Want. We made the mistake with Pete Rose. This nigga here listen In peace He doing Did you happen to get a glimpse of Dodger games? We should let him do what he want. He should be able to gamble. He bodying them shit. He's the best. He's the best. He's the best player that you ever saw. Really? He different. He's the best player you ever saw. He hold Me down with that hit of fantasy score on He's the best player you ever saw like with your eyes. He is.


He is Japanese dude. Yeah, yeah. Yes. He should be able to gamble. His man gladly went and did the gambling bid down too. Supposed just let, That's how you supposed To do it. They just let him do it. It is what It is. My take see go. What you think about them Yankee bats? I think it's brilliant. And let's not say Yankee bats, it's 'cause people, other teams in the league are using these bats now. Homie don't even work for the Yankees. I think he works for the fuck. I'm not looking it up. I won't ask right now. But he don't work for the Yankees right this second. But the dude that came up with this is some genius from MITT. Yeah, It makes sense.


It just makes sense. If we're not violating any, any rules in the rule book, they change the shape of the bat. They put more of the wood in a certain area of the bat where, Where the ball makes contact at, Where the ball makes. If you study your team, some players may contact there more than others. So everybody on the Yankees is not using this bat. But some people are and it's working. The Yankees have like 19 home runs in their first four games or wow. Something. Something ridiculous. So I think that the league is gonna stop this at some point. See I'm gonna, I think they don't. Why They shouldn't, they Shouldn't because the league wants excitement. It's the same reason Expectator shit. Exactly. It's the same reason why they turned they head during the home run race years ago. Got it. Yeah. Like you know what they was doing but everybody watch it because we wanna see the, the home runs.


So now we found a way to do it without the drugs. I I would say for business and for viewership. Let that shit rock. And if it's league wide, if y'all want to use it and y'all don't, that's whatever. And nigga I wish I could just take one of these bats and just get drafted. Just learn how to play it. Just some magic shit. I be watching too much movies man. I want to become like remember angels in the outfield or whatever that picture with his hand go shoulder up. Yeah. I don't give a fuck. I want that to happen nigga. Lemme go try and hit one of them bats so they can just draft me. JBP Queen Flip is here and knock it out. Well wait, hold up now. If you get drafted you can drop the moniker. You can. You can. You don't have to say JBP anymore.


Well I don't say JBP at all now. I'm just saying it now nigga. I'm my boss. Admit that you get drafted. You don't have to say it. I don associate with you Could just be flip from flip the network. I don't shut my man out. No you don't have to. You disgusting ass nigga. You disgusting you Adam 22. Shit. Huh? Tweet it up. Erase him. Erase him. He was never here.
