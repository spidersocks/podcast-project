Like we, what, what topic do y'all want to talk about? Is there a topic that needs our attention?


How about that? Yeah. A lot of topics need our attention. Real quick, it's before we get into the, the, the substance. This is pride month. Not that, that it's not substantive, but I mean it's pride month, happy pride. So we should say happy pride to Happy Pride Month GBTQ Community. And I have a, a challenge to all of us. How many months I niggas get? Just, just June? No. Oh wait, what else is it? I may be wrong. It's Men's Health Month. Yes. It's also Men's Health Month. That is true. Yes. But in terms of the Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, sure. I'm not dismiss I'm not doing it. I was thinking how for this episode, 'cause we, we, we say pause a lot for this entire episode.


How about we see if we go the whole episode without saying pause. I paused. Yo yo and the first person that doesn't makes a donation to a, to LGBT organization. I think that's great. 500. I don't, I don't agree. No, no. Just a suggestion. I'm down for the challenge. I think it's, I think it's an interesting challenge. No. Can we still snicker? I'm insulted by the challenge. Yeah, It is. Do you think that we can't not say Paul? I I No, I don't. Seriously. As, as an entire crew. Well, yeah. They just directed the flip. No, I don think it's flip. I'm saying as a crew, who else do you think can't say? I don't say pause a lot. Cannot say pause. I tell the truth. All, all of us myself included, I that means everything.


Like ao all of you. You go take you go take the challenge. Yeah, It is. I, yeah, I don I don't view it as such a challenge. Have no problem. Not saying pause. So let's, can we still laugh if we say pause and I'm gonna say a bunch of gay shit. It is my, my lucky challenge. I'm waiting for this one. Yeah, I think it's, you know. Yeah. No, I'm, I'm cool. Alright. Done. Anyway. Happy pride month. Happy happy Pride Month. Yep. And Happy Men's Men's. Men's Health. Health Awareness. Oh, it Men's Health Awareness Month. Men's Health. Yes. Oh, happy Men's Health Awareness Month. For sure. Yeah. We should, we should definitely talk about that this month too. Dope Joe, we talked about the bet, but what we didn't talk about was how you actually feel about the Knicks breaking your heart like that.


They didn't break my heart. They didn't break my heart. Let's not get, let's not give, that last game was a little heartbreaking. I want let you have your Nah, I mean you were pretty intense about this. Nixon let have your fun six Nixon and seven, you know, would be the first team to come back. Well I'm, I'm a I'm gonna die our Knick fan. Yeah. When when It is over. It is when it's over. Okay. So no bitterness No until it No, no, no, no, no. Listen. Well I think, I think that was a winnable game. Let me, lemme start there. That I do think that that was a winnable game and there's a lot of people that didn't show up on the road. A lot of, damn, I'm not transition points. I'm not bro. Damn. And that's the story of it. When you give up that many points in transition, just in that many points off turnovers.


Turnovers, yeah. Seeka was just, there's nothing you could do that side of the, so my takeaways, if I'm being serious for a second, I think Jalen Brunson needs to find ways to impact the game outside of scoring. And I think that'll happen. I think there's a lot to be said about Kat. I think us and the Timberwolves kind of traded headaches a little bit. You think and we watch that come to form with, so I think y'all got the best end of the stick though. Same. There's a lot to be said about Kat that I won't say Mikel Bridges fadeaways in, in exchange for layups. I think that needs to be talked about at some point. The way Josh Hart disappeared, I think needs to be talked about at some point.


I'm not so mad at Tom Thibodaux Leon Rose or any of that. Even though I'm, I could see how he has questions coming his way. They could utilize the bench a lot better in the game. You wouldn't fire, you wouldn't fire Thibo? No. What? Hell no. I Thank you Mike Malone's available. I think that's foolish. I wouldn't fired Thibodaux if Phil Jackson was available. Well we should have never hired Phil Jackson in the first place. Yeah. Not that Phil Jackson. Sorry. Subject. Oh the good Phil Jackson like yo dog. I don't think Thibodaux did a bad job at all. Not me neither. I think it's easy in substitute to, to look and see where somebody could have done better for the people that say that Thito had an 82 game season to get some type of chemistry with some of those ancillary parts on the bench.


You wouldn't be wrong when the Knicks were holding auditions for either Sham it or what was gonna be Marcus Morris. Marcus Mark the good one. The Morris s the good one though Marcus. It is Marcus. Marcus. Marcus Morris Jr. Like I thought that those would be important pieces for a player front. Like them doing that. I felt like they identified that too and just didn't for some reason. I'm not with all of the reports coming out after the fact of Nick's locker room problems. I'm not with that. I don't wanna harp on the negative because this is as, as a lifetime Nick fan. This is the first time in my life where I have attended a first round series, a second round series and an Eastern Conference final series in person.


Yeah. Like that don't fall short on me. This is back to back 50 win seasons. They just did a lot. Good. So I don't want to be the guy. I think they were ahead of schedule. I don't think they planned on this year going like this. I think they'll tinker around in the off season and we'll see what happens next year. But my hat off to them. Congratulations. I think all Knicks fans are truly happy. I was a little tired of seeing Tommy Chalet, Timmy Sham, whatever homeboy's name is. I love ZI was sick of it too. I was sick of it too. Now he had the fucking pacer games with the Jenner girl. You had the Knick game. Yo get this move. I don't care about these Orange and blue Pro marts.


Move. Move yo dog. It is. I got hate in me sometimes. No dog. I don't wanna see all of that shit. Hate's fun. How much, what else? What else about the Knicks? I, I didn't wanna see for a little bit some of the Oh my God, I think the Knicks did. It had a great season. They did. They did for sure. I think they overachieved gotta start real hard. Most you did, did your best. Yeah. I think most fans would be pleased with the season. I don't think anybody had y'all getting outta Boston. Yo. The see started and listen, let me just say the better team won. I agree. I think that the Knicks. I think that the Knicks, yeah I don I think that the Knicks, I don't know that I don't Go ahead. Go listen buddy. Go ahead. They played, I think that the Knicks are a more talented team.


I think top to bottom coach on down. I think they proved to the Pacers prove to be a better team. Listen niggas sleep. 'cause we don't know all them fucking Hayward Workmen head ass niggas. Them niggas is monsters. Nate Smith is a sixth pick in the draft. Yep. The nigga that comes in after him, Rin was a seventh pick M was a seventh pick in the draft and he had a series. Shit. Tj I'm happy. I'm happy for Miles Turner, I'm happy for aka I'm listening to fucking Tyler Hound Burton talk. I like how he's talked. I like how he speaks. Yeah. So as some of them black brothers over there, I remember when Indiana wasn't looked like that. So I'm happy for them too.


I'm happy for the Knicks. All of that is awesome. Hope we have an entertaining finals. I'm happy for Halliburton. I'm happy for them. After that, after that shit came out that they ranked him like the most overrated player in the league. I like him getting his lick back on these nicks. Yeah, no I'm, I'm, although he did look real salty where he thought he was gonna be an MVP. Oh my God. Is that not a great moment? He starts stepping up. Like you gotta be kept, don't spend the money before you get it. That's true. Facts. Even though he had a case, he did a great case. He had case he had a great case. But I might have picked him if he, if he was that then the Knicks win. If AKA don't go off like that. Yeah. In all of those games, the The Knicks win. Yeah, the Knicks win.


How much of this current iteration of the Knicks is making it into like next season? I know there's free agency and you know, off season acquisitions and trades and shit like That. Don't, nobody knows. Yeah. You won't know Bridges. Bridges. Y'all got somebody that's Bridges is up for an extension. Okay. Eligible for a four year, 150 mil somewhere around that. But with Greek, Greek Freak and Kevin Durant lingering. I don't think anybody is safe. That's facts. So let's just see the Knicks are said to want to be aggressive in in free agency. Indeed is available. I'm just letting you know I can speak on behalf of my city if you want. Indeed I'm happy. A nice little package to broker. Yeah. Yeah. Who would y'all give 'em back?


We'll take this about two or three Spike Lee some give, give us some seats. S and a Twix. Right, right. Exactly. Fuck. Nah, I think, I think the niggas did a great job. I don't think they got anything to hold their heads over. Agreed. And I think they played the hell yo. One thing which you can't take from them. They play hard dog every single game. They play hard. I think the inconsistencies come and Indiana was inconsistent. See AKA was having 40, then he'll have nine then 15. Yeah. Yeah because that that, that just speaks to the depth of your team that other niggas could step up on different days. If Rin get hot or if Naysmith get hot or whoever get hot, they just gonna carry the load on that night. I think that's dope. We do have a live reporter that went down to 34th Street to hear from Nick fans after the loss.


I may have one, but y'all come from Indiana. Like that's kind of weird. We're from New York so we really take the Double, you know that part I wanna come back to that lives in Indiana bro. We can lose to Philly. We can lose to Chicago. Fuck it. Loose LA in The final. Indiana has our numbers for years in the Midwest decades. Shit is not good. I don't know why anybody is smiling during those dance game. Tyre Hallberg. I Hate your dad 'cause yo Adam, what is his name? Adam Silver. Suck my fucking dick. The Knicks are losing because of Halliburton selling his soul. Man. Big seven. It ain't over yet. During The dance games, I see people smiling and doing nineties disco. Are you fucking kidding me? We're Down 20. It was a lot of bullshit and questionable calls bro.


Yeah, these devil magic Ass threw. This is some bs. How the fuck you call four fos in nine seconds? That was crazy. Reps. I don't know what they were doing tonight. The rat were cheating. Listen. Enough for them. I'm tired. Four seconds. Listen on one hand, congratulations to Indiana. We got a show to do. So I don't wanna harp on this. I do wanna hit the round of applause and say congratulations to Indiana. In order to learn how to win, you gotta learn how to lose. And they've been here before. This is the Knicks first conference final. The Pacers have been here for a few years. It's their turn. Now you wanna tip your hat to those guys on the flip side of that to Mike Epps, Zaire Teague, any of the rest of you niggas.


The Jacksons. Yeah. It is still y'all. It is still Indiana. You stupid. Yo. Oh my God. If I, if we had the trade and y'all got all the Accola basketball accolades and we got none, but we get to be in New York and you get to be in Indiana, like it's still tumbleweeds and soybeans out there. Oh it's still corn starch. What else is happening out there? That's milk. Probably. Y'all are the least known sport out there. It is the cols. WNBA, the Indy 500 High school basketball, college basketball.


And then you niggas. So let's just type taper it down. Relax. Y'all are still y'all, but y'all still y'all Rick Carlisle talking about something. What the fuck did he say? And then we can move on. He said in 49 states it's just basketball in one state. It's just basketball. Like a shut up. Shut up Rick car. I love that. I like that. He right though. Shut up. That's all the niggas do. Shit. That's what Indiana is. Anyway, congratulations in here. Y'all still It is still Indiana though. Niggas ain't even got a Shake shack out there.


Niggas ain't got no bodegas. Niggas got them. Bland bitch. Anyway, alright, lemme shut up. Yeah. Anyway, moving on. Got a mail on your phone again. Moving on. Yo, the, the internet is, has been crazy last couple days about this Vanessa Bryant story. I know y'all ever heard it at this point. There was a rumor going on for the last like three or four days that Vanessa Bryant, the widow of Kobe Bryant was pregnant. Mm. Then there was another rumor that she was not only pregnant, but potentially pregnant by a young baller basketball player. A young baller. That was the quote that was in the, on the in news. It said a young baller, I'm assuming they meant basketball player. And fortunately earlier in the week, Vanessa came out to clear up the rumor.


She said, I'm enjoying my summer not pregnant. You know, basically like I'm ignoring the rest of the rumors. So we know that part's not true. What's interesting to me though is people's reaction to it. Like people were bent outta shape, especially dudes were like really, really bent outta shape at the idea that Vanessa Bryant could be pregnant. I even saw I flipped, I I seen your your tweet. Yeah. Where you were like, it, it better been if she's pregnant it better be from like some, like some old, I mean it's Kobe man, a frozen egg. Right. I mean It is a, It is is an unspoken rule, you know, amongst in, in the, in the community. I mean what's the rule? What community? Listen, the community that I'm from. Okay. And that C and It is community. Yes. And the rule is, I mean of course in in life she can, she's supposed to move on, she can live her life and stuff like that.


I mean it's been five years and all that and, and that's her choice if that was true. But nigga, when it comes to morals and principles and our minds nigga and whatever mental world that I'm in, nigga I'm not that's Kobe nigga. But what's the moral I don see, I don't wanna see her move on. I don't wanna see Laura London move on. So she's, I don't want to see y'all move on, do that shit privately. So they're supposed to walk around in public with black veils and black dresses and just be for life a constant state of mourning for the rest of their lives. Well that's extreme. But I would want your business to be private because we still hold these guys in high regards in our mind. In my mind. Even though they can do it, it's just like, oh damn girl, you did that and it's been five years if that was the case, but it's not, you know, that's how crazy.


Right. That's insane. And dude, I'm crazy. Hey, what the fuck can I say? I'm crazy and I, this ain't some, what's interesting to me is that it's not just some like flip shit. Right. It is not just you. I know It is everybody like It is a big chunk of the internet was saying the same shit. They were like calling her all kinds of hoes and Jesus Christ. Yeah, but I don I don't agree with that. I think that, you know, that's not what No, I know you not saying that, but I'm just saying the idea that she did something wrong and she's violating some cool, I wanted to kind of know first when Kobe died again, 2020, Like January 26th. Oh hey dog. Yeah, Dog. There's a lot of people that have problems with Stop with widows moving on for some reason. Come On. I've seen that hot topic. I've seen that in non-celebrity circles. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's just my sister lost her husband and people in the community were weird when she got Well his Boys like, how dare she?


Right. Listen, This is a million little things and Landman. Yeah, Yeah. Well I've seen Landman but it's a million little places for sure. Yeah man, Landman was so good. It snacks on my list and, but yes It is. What'd You say? I I don't remember that happening in the landman. In Landman when dude did work. Oh yeah. The the, the shit died and his wife, my nigga. That's different. How shit was a week later, two weeks later. It didn't take that long in a million little things either. I think in most cases I'm familiar with it happens because somebody is there to console you over your loss. They become so it happens, It is different too though. So it happens a little fast.


How a best friend, yo I'm a pro. Is that, is that a no for you? The best? Yes. It is not a no for me it's, I don't know if that's a no For me it's not a no for me. A lot of times that is exactly what happens because the best friend was close the closest. Yeah. You know like or If It is your best friend typically nigga he got some of your same characteristics or he shared some shit. I'm laughing. I'm with him. He's right. Funny. It do sound funny. It because in in the nigga's mind It is the best brand was was thinking about this while you was still here. Possible dead. You ain't got no mind. You dead as hell.


I'm just talking about nigga mind, nigga brain. The nigga, nigga brain. True. True. You saying nigga brain outsiders, You right free. Yes on look, I want my niggas to set it off on you Nigga. It is right though. You Saying nigga saying Stevie J was wow for marrying faith. Why? Because 'cause he worked with big before because of the, the whole big Relationship. But usually in friend circles and that's crazy to me. You have like the same kind of political beliefs maybe, or just general view of the world. At least to some level. Niggas uphold a lot of stupid beliefs. Yeah, facts. Some of this, some of this shit is just stupid. Man, move on. Don't move on with my best friend. I don't fuck what y'all talking about. Somebody else. If your best friend is the person that, and I'm not, I'm not advocating for this. I'm just No, I'm just saying.


But if your best friend is the person that makes your, makes the wife feel better and is the best option for your family moving forward, then why would you be so against it? I'm hoing all you niggas. Let's go freeze. I'm there. Every dream, every dream. And Hold on. Not listen. I have a friend talking about I have a friend who Way and It is happening in your friends and neighbors and It is happening in your friends and neighbors. What's the, what you saying on, on It is a show on Apple. Where Is that good? Yes. I'm gonna watch it. Where the main character, his baby moms is in a relationship. Oh yeah. With with his best friend who happens to be a athlete. They all still alive. Oh, that's different. And they a, a blended family.


It is a blended. I'm with blended families. It is. I'm with blended. If I'm still here, don't fuck with my man's if I'm gone different. I think I actually encourage That because I, I think that that, wait a minute. And I think that that could happen organically. I think that you, your man's could pass away or your, or, or, or your wife could pass away and you are being the nigga that they leaning on. 'cause you think that's your duty. Like, yo, you need some money, you need this, you need that. Exactly. I know he would've done those things. You a pussy. You can do all that without fucking my girl. You trying to step up to be present in his absence. And that can be an organic thing where she starts to like you or he starts to like her. I hear you. I don't think that That's wrong. I have a friend whose father passed away when he was six years old and his mother ended up marrying his father's best friend.


I don't know what the length of time afterwards, but it wasn't that long. He's carried this inside his head for and resents his mom as a result. I was like, so you've been sinking with your 6-year-old brain trying to figure out the decisions that this woman who was left widowed with young children yet it's like, there's also like a sense of support that this a woman was, I Wouldn't want my wife or baby mom to go out and deal with all the f fuckhead in the street like that too. There's a good man. Like don't, don't mess with my like wild friends though. Like pick, pick the good one. Like pick the good one, the solid one. Y'all into some different shit. I got it. I respect it. But, but every, because it was a thing back in the days I heard, like back in the days it was a thing where the husband died. They're married at the brother, the brother I read.


But yeah, I that happens a lot too. That makes sense. What year you died, man, you died five years ago. Who? Me? I slapped it nigga just saying, has it been five years? You died five years. Nigga, lemme tell you, lemme tell you something. Don't listen. I gotta come on. Damn. Got whatcha talking about real quick because you know you talking about me nigga. I'll kill you nigga. I'll punch you in your face. I don't give a fuck nigga. J will fix you, nigga J will fix you nigga jr be happy to see a familiar. Never JR will fix you. I'm joking man. It just, it just because we know some niggas out here are able to help the family without getting in the bed with the, with the, with the girls.


Wait, so well 'cause I'm, I'm fascinated by these rules because even Parks got a rule. You're like, you you are okay with it as long as you're dead. No. You Don. Yeah, if I'm dead and have a blast. But if you're alive, you then know she can't change it. We got all these rules about what women can do with their bodies. I got rules. Listen, you would listen to what I'm saying. We'll not let you. That's what It is though. That's exactly what It is. You saying. You can fuck him. You can fuck him. You can fuck him. What the Fuck that I don with? You gotta talk it over each other. No, listen what I'm saying. Listen what I'm saying. Let's attack mark one at a time, one at a time. I'm I'm fine with that. Hear me out.


Lemme point for you. Disagree with it. Don't talk over this. I'm not saying I don't have those rules too. I'm saying that they're fucked up rules. I'm saying I don't want my wife to fuck my, my brother or my best friends. We're all I'm saying. But thats finish. That is about controlling what women do with they body. Yes. We talk. Yes. Using an example from a woman's, I said the men and women. I said both. You think that's wise? No. 'cause most of us don't have the same rule for the other side. That's not true. I said for both. I think, I think it's the same rule. I'm saying most of us, most dudes I know have fucked up their, let not say. Yep. Many dudes I know have had sex with they with they girlfriend's best friend. Or if they wifes died would fuck they best friend. They they their wife's best friend. And you know what? He was plotting on her while she was here. Right. Which is the same shit that I'm saying that don't make it right either way.


Is that against your ethics and morals and principles and be clear a lot? Is that against your ethics and morals and principles? What's the question? What is the question? If, if if, if you don't for it. Flip. I got it. What's the question? Don't fall for it. If, if you were to mess with your wife, if she would've passed away, God forbid her girlfriend Yes. Or her best, you know best, what would that be? Against ethics and rules And principles. Yes. Why? It's still wrong. Why? Yes. Because that was my wife's best friend. Oh yes. That's crazy to me. It is still wrong regardless of, listen, it's wrong double. It is double standing. Whatever we believe it's still wrong at the end of the day. 'cause how would she feel? Would my wife want me to move on? My wife? I, but she's, you wouldn't slide your wife's best friend if something happened to her, bro. This is not a gender, gender conversation. Careful thinking. Which careful, I'm think which one is the best friend?


No. No. Hilarious. I would not, I would not. 'cause you live by principles and, and and, and certain principles and morals that was instilled. Well, even though you don't wanna identify it as principles and morals, that is instilled in us. That's what we live by. An unspoken rule and an unspoken respect amongst, in a relationship amongst your partner. You're not supposed to fuck if your wife passed away. You're not supposed to fuck her best friend. Because that's just, that's just what It is. I'm not disagree. Even when she alive, niggas doing, doing, doing that part. This is what I'm saying. I personally would not, because anybody who my wife considers a best friend, I look at like a sister at that point. There we go. Me too. So for me it's, it's, It is. That's, and I don't, it's just like anybody in this room, any of y'all ladies, I look at like family at that point.


I stop looking at the network. There's only one lady, what'd you say? There's only one lady in the room. I said any no y'all's ladies. Oh ladies. Copy, copy. Like I, I look at y'all. So I wouldn't even think like that. And after they go in, I don't start thinking like that. Like, oh, now they freak you. I get that. But what I'm saying is if I were to make a different choice or if you met, you met this lady, I'll sleep one of y'all niggas right now. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. Oh, okay. Mm. Just checking. Yeah, but the the right Yeah. I make it uncomfortable, nigga. I don't care. Nobody's scared. I just told you about all, but, but the point is, it's about ultimately it still becomes about control. And I, and I find that I, I find that we want to control what people do.


But Mark, this is what we saying to you, why you always speak like you done found some epiphany while also admitting that you're guilty of the same shit. You know what time It is because, so why do you, it's called self-awareness. Why do you So we can start, man. Oh hell no. Hell no. It's called self-awareness. Being able to acknowledge that you have fault, but also, You know, and wanna be better what work through, through it. It wanna be better. Exactly. It's called Self-awareness. I know, but you could do that while you could also sound like you identify with that side because you lived that. Right? I'm, I'm not hearing the identification in terms of Yeah, I understand how that can happen even though it sounds foul when we verbalize.


Yeah. And I'm doing that so that I don't seem like I'm talking above the fray. Like I'm like, I'm taking a moral high ground. I'm saying I struggle with that too, but it's a, it's a dumb ass position to take that I might work with work struggle with too. If my wife told me right now, mark, if you die, you know, I could end up with your best friend. Right. Or, or some, somebody, you know, that shit would drive me crazy even though it shouldn't fucking matter. Yeah, I know. We then we need to address why she's telling you this. Yeah. That's the thing. That's fair. That's fair. So you was thinking about this now it's a tough hypothe. It's a tough hypothetical. I don't mean it in that way. I just mean if she, if she initiated the conversation that hits different, but Right. If hypothetically she said, yo, if something were to happen to me, wouldn't mind if you sought a relationship with such and such and that could be her best friend.


You received that differently for sure than her saying, yo, I fuck Keith. Yeah. And I said that wrong. I put it like this. If, if my wife were to ask me, mark, is anybody off limits? If you die for me to date in my brain, I gotta a list of people. Same way everybody in this room do. But in real life I would say no I wouldn't. And that's what I'm saying. I would say no. I would say my list. I'm saying my list. I would say my list. Why would, why would you say no? Why would you say no? This is also a clip from Modern Family. When they was on the plane, they had this exact conversation. I, I would say no because I don't, because even though I have a list, one of the greatest shows ever. Yes. This shit is my, my list would be friends, some family, some of my favorite rappers. It'd be a list. Okay. I'm not even joking. Why would you not? And Idris Fuck that guy. Mars, Chesterman Morris Mars ain't worried about.


But, but that, that, that Idris, what's the name? The dude Don Timothy Damson. Who? Which one? Whatever that dude that was at the Muslim banquet thing. Yeah, he's Mahers. Mahers. Yeah. Maher. Top of the list. Right. Fuck that guy. But well, you just named three guys who are very happily married. Idris, but I'm dead. They wife could be dead. Whatever the point, you know, all the niggas is happily married. Yes, I do. I had no idea though. I absolutely do. Alright. The, the, the point is, I'm in that age range where I'm looking for who's getting divorced anyways. Gone. Anyway, enough about me. Holy wait, hold out. Holy sh Who is looking to get on their second marriage?


She said I'm here for seconds. I told you, I told you I'm not editing myself anymore. Go on. All right. I love that. I love that. So, so, so tell me who is on your, so if your partner comes to you, says right now, who's on the cannot fuck with you, cannot fuck with them list after I die. Who's on the list for you? Everyone. No, you pre male. I mean, I wanna go back to why you won't tell her the list though. Because I don't think I'm right. I I think I'm being selfish. She's asking, asking you a question. Yes. And I'm saying I don't think it's a, I don't think it's a reasonable ask. Even if she does. I disagree. I'm saying I have a list, but I don't think I'm right. So you'd rather lie to her. You freeze, freeze. No. You'd rather pander and play politically correct. Pander to who is this two people in the, that's not what pandering means.


I'm just saying I don't want, I wanna do what I think is right. Even if I think that It is a popular opinion. Yo dog that's pandering you going, you going, I want to do what is right even if it's pop. Did you see what I'm, I want to do what's right? Yes. You're screaming for no reason. I apologize. Listen what I'm saying, what I'm saying is no, no, that's not pandering. No. Hold on. I said if doing what you think is right is not pandering. Pandering. You're lying. No, I said you are lying to your wife. She asked you a direct question. You saying what? You think you gave a politic as opposed to telling what's not lie. Listen to what I just said. That's not a lie. Mark. You said I have a list and I'm telling her no, there's no list. That's not what I a lie, that's not what I said. Gonna sell her my list. Lemme tell you what I actually said. Oh, y'all got, she asked me who the ropes, if you just lemme talk, you hear what I'm saying?


She said, who is off limits? Not who do you want to be off limits? Who is off limits? And I'm saying I have a list of people who I want to be off limits, but I'm not going to share that list because lemme finish because I'm not saying a word using people do like this as an interjection. So I'm, I'm saying I wouldn't share that list because I don't actually think that's the right list to share. I'm gonna do the right thing. Even though it's difficult for me. That's not pandering. That's me saying I'm gonna make a principled decision despite the fact that she's gimme another option. Margo. Yeah. Oh, you said when she asked you this question, you're gonna say nobody even though you have a list this long. Yes. That's a lie. It's not a lie. He trying to get off, off on. He's semantic. It is not a semantic, It is not a semantic thing.


It's not he, if you, if you say who's off limits versus who you want to be off limits is what you're saying. Yes. I'm saying semantic semantics. I'm saying, I'm saying I don't want, I want the, like, I want the whole world to be off limits, but that's not fair. It's not fair. So I'm gonna do what's fair. That's not a lie. It is a real conversation. It's not a lie. Joe. If I said You right Joe, if I say to You right now saying, if I say to you, Joe, right now, who's getting fired, Joe, if I said who, who are you? Who are you, who are you firing? Right? And you gotta handle a list. A list of people who you wanna fire, who you wanna say. Right? Not here anywhere. Right. And you ultimately decide that you don't, you ultimately say I'm not, you know, let not use exhibit. I understand. I'm doing it for, I'm doing because understand. I don't feel like thinking it through though. And you do too. We just think he's lying.


I don what's lying? How is that semantic? I don dancing. I don dancing. Lying. That's called nuance. I'm saying there's lots of people I would want, I want don't want my right to fuck. But I don't think I have a right to say that. You can't correct yourself in real time. She's giving you the right to say that by asking you who are the people you don't want off limits me to fuck with. Who's off limits. That is her saying, hey. Right. You, even if you don't think you have the right, I'm giving it to you. 'cause I would like to know the people that you think and limits. That's fair question. I'm saying I And you're gonna say there's nobody off limits even though in your head there's a lot of people. I would say so he's lying to himself. He's lying to her because he telling her I'm lying to her. How y asked the direct question. Yeah, but he just omitted, he not telling this is what I'm saying. If she says to me, mark, I'm leaving them are that niggas you rather not purposeful omission is a lie.


I'm not, I'm not lying. I don I don't want you guys to be circular. I got what I will say in terms of what I think you're saying is I take you at your word. I believe you. Yeah, yeah. I do believe you. I think that has to do, I think I believe you more so on what that stance does for your appearance to your wife versus what saying no, I like when you said, I feel when you say to your wife, nobody, here's the thing, if, if I were to ask my wife that same question, she would have a list that mean it and would tell me that list. So it's not like she's expecting me to say nobody. I just think that she's wrong and I'm not gonna do to her.


What, what what she might, I'm, I'm not gonna pose a rule on her just 'cause she's imposing the same rule on me because I don't actually think that rule is okay. Listen brother, I don't ever aspire to be as mature as you. You two, you too damn mature. No, but you can't correct yourself in real time. You can't what I Correct. No, I'm what I'm saying. I agree with you. You can't have a conversation and in your in inside you can feel one way. But when you talking to your wife, you just don't wanna put that 'cause it's wrong. There's a lot of shit that I have that conversation with Linky all the time and I be dead wrong. But I don't wanna, I don't admit it. Admit it like Exactly man. Like I be, I know I'm wrong. In my mind I, but I don't wanna have that debate. I don't wanna put that on her. Yeah. And I don't want her to put that on me. So lemme ask you a question in that line, if, if I were to say or flip in ice, if I were to say, if she says who's off flip, I say, well, you know, I got, would it be honest to say, look, I got a lot of people in my head that I don't want you to fuck with, but I don't actually think I should say that to you 'cause I I don't wanna put restrictions on you.


So do what you, you know, do what you want. That's like meeting in the middle of the, is that more transparent? That's middle pandemic. I'm asking is that more transparent? That's you being honest, that's you being honest saying yo, there is a list. I don't, but I don't want to tell you the list instead of saying no, there's no list. There's no list. Didn didn't say there was no list. I do you understand the difference between saying there's no list. Alright, let's we That's not what I'm saying in closing, none of us are leaving our partners. No. And hopefully our partners not, but be hit by bus and none of us are having these talk currently outside of me. I ain't going the bars. Baby. Before We close, I just, I had, I just had one question from Mark because I didn't see the chatter obviously. But was there a separation in the attitude towards this question between men and women?


Like did was, did women have a different stance? Yes. Did Collectively, yes they did. They attacked me. They said, oh you want to control her pussy now? All type of crazy stuff. Women did this women is this Yes. Women, they, they and some men did too. Some women do that too and some it It is probably middle. Yeah, It is probably middle to me. I saw a lot of women on the side of she can do whatever she wants she life. Yeah. Her level, her life. Women can be very judgy in these situations too. From my personal experience. They absolutely can. So for them to say that when, If you sleep with them collectively every time I fuck what they dead friends, they start judging me. I'm with you. Clark wants to apologize, know time It is right? Yes. Now it's time for my favorite part of the show.

Alright, the Clipse did a GQ interview. Really good interview by the way. Yeah. Yep. They did a lot of interview, long read, long read a lot of interview, but certain clips started making the way around. One being how Push feels about Kanye currently, how he feels about the Drake lawsuit, yada yada y Which part do y'all want to unpack first in this push shit? Oh and the Def Jam. The Def Jam. How they on Rock Nation now? Because the Kendrick verse, the Def Jam wooden clear it. Let me lead off. Go ahead. Def Jam ain't been Def Jam since I was at Def Jam. Def Jam has always been Def DEAF Jam.


I call 'em Def Jig or that I like that. I've been calling 'em Def Jig now I try to chill because I, I used to know good people working over there. I don't know who's over there now. I know they broke down consolidated and picked it back up and they made some type of new group now with all the Mercury and Island and yada yada yada. We'll get to that. But Def Jim did Big Shawn wrong, Tiana wrong, even though she's still over there. Who else they did wrong? Cri Joe Button. Def Jam without Ludicrous and Ja and DMX and LL and Nat Def Jam ain't Def Jam. So why everybody get all of that?


The record player with the needle on the post that I have fucking tattooed on me. Them days are long gone at long. Why? Anybody is surprised that Def Jam did some anti hiphop shit? I'm shocked by it, but I'm not, they've done a good job with marketing themselves as the hip hop, hip hop label and that just has not been the truth for quite some time. So it don't shock me that they said in the middle of litigation, Hey no Kendrick, even though he is a universal act. Well I think they wanted to censor him and they refused. So they wanted to take the song off and they refused.


So they came up with, hey, just let us go. And that was problematic because Pusha is also signed there as a solo artist. So, Well that's where I want to reserve some of my Def Jam vitriol. If that story is true, that means that they released them. They did, they did release them. They did release them. Yeah. Which is, I mean, so We wanna applaud Def Jam for 'cause I wouldn't have done that. No way. No way. I I wouldn't have released you. No way. You'd have just had to find another way with your little verse. But did the Kendrick verse say or It's not out? No one's heard it. It's not out. Okay. We haven't heard. Only Rob Markman Has heard it. I mean no, as a, you know, from the interview, was there a subliminal against Drake?


Was there From what I was told, no. He didn't make any subliminals about Drake or anything like that. I don't think that matters when litigation is going on. Yeah. So they're just afraid that any mention, everything is subliminal, Everything is open for interpretation during litigation. The mirror appearance on, on there, I guess scared them off. Just Kendrick's appearance alone Is we gonna do So Kenrick Kendrick would pushing Gotcha, gotcha. Who are the two people that It's in San Diego defeated. I understand. In the battle, Like Yeah, I understand, I understand That. And we, we in the middle of a potential 10 figure lawsuit against this man. Yeah. I'm going to proceed on the side of caution.


You're gonna cost us money. Yeah. They are already literally, supposedly some billions is being tossed around as a potential settlement nigga. I I'm not playing 'em games. So you can feel how you wanna feel on a, on a, on a sentimental side. But this is business and sometimes we get the two conflated, like, fam I'm making the best decision for our business, not for your project and your art. So they left Def Jam and went to Rock Nation? Yes. Yes. That's interesting. They, they left Def Jam. They were shopping the album around and eventually partnered up with Rock Nation for distribution. Got it. So it's like a distro deal with them.


Thoughts. Yeah. What do we, I mean I think they landed in the right place. Honestly, Def Jam hasn't been Def Jam to your point. I agree. So Roc Nation is still Roc Nation and they've got a bunch of talented people over there and they're building it so they landed in the right place. How normal is This in the business that, that a label is stepping and do this step in and what like censor. Censor? Yeah. Yeah. Till somebody take you off the verse. Yeah. Demo more verse. This is not from my era or hip hop. That just didn't happen then. This artists didn't have that much power back then. That's not true. I I, I got some firsthand. Some did. Very few. Some did, but that didn't, some do today. That didn't go on. Well, yeah, it still only is, I feel like usually these type of things would be like an a and r decision. This artist isn't hot enough or whatever reason we don't want this artist on there.


I this is might be might be the first time I've experienced or witnessed them censoring for a huge art. A huge, a huge a big artist. Yeah. Yeah. Taking a big, a bigger artist than the album is. Yeah. Nobody's respect's ever heard of you having the biggest rapper in the game feature and the label you're on saying no Thank you. Nobody's ever heard of that. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. That seems to me that's new. Okay. Could be. That's new but I understand the position. Yeah. And I think from the position stand push even standpoint. Yeah. I think push even said something like that. Yo the lawsuit shit is bigger than hip hop now. So it sucks that you got kind of gotta acquiesce to this thing. But It is here and, and It is a real thing.


So you have to treat it that way. So I understand Def Jam's position. Thank god that there is a juxtaposition, a alternate, right? Yeah. I don I just hate it. I don't know if it's just a Def Jam position that this is coming from. And I say that because I've heard firsthand that there has been edits made to or versus taken versus removed came down strictly from a certain artist. Yeah. Yo, I need y'all that that can't go on that album. Yeah, well They mentioned it. They mentioned the, the Rick Ross, It, some other, there's some other records that I was told he did the same thing too.


Yo, this can't happen and if you don't do this, I'll make it up by doing something for y'all. You scratch my back by by getting this off of this album. I'll scratch your back. You're saying It is Drake? Yes. That's what you're saying. Yes. That's what I'm saying. Do do you think that I think it's UMG but that could be acting from him, which it's still Yeah, I could, I could pick up a phone call and call a head over here yo dead that I'd have more respect if his UMG though like, 'cause then it feels like a business move and you just have to do it. If another artist just calls you and says like, you know what I'm saying? Like take this. I don't want that verse. I agree. Yeah. I don't respect that as much. That's all I'm saying. I agree with that. I just think that's power. I agree too. But I, I was just about to say I think that he's an anomaly or he's one of a selected few groups of artists where he ain't moving like a artist no more.


He moving like a business and like a brand. And if you gonna say some shit that could be potentially disparaging to me, I got the big boy power to shelf your shit. Remember back when? I don't think that that's new. Remember back when 50 was beefing with the locks and he said one more word out your mouth. I pushed style shit back like I had power at university. He was saying that, I mean, excuse me. At Interscope. Yeah. He 50 used to say my name is Curtis Interscope Jackson when I lean the building leans. So Drake has that power, not just at uni. I think it's further, well I don't know today. Today it might not reach as far it before. I don't think it was just at Universal. I think he had that power across hiphop period. I could make a phone call.


I don't like that. Fix it. How many artists have that power now? Now? Yeah. If we say Drake's one of those people, who else is one of those people? Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift, yeah. Oh for sure. Well that's what, and again that's something else that Drake was sitting there saying on the Es with, with Kendrick, where he's like, yo, you gotta coordinate your schedule with Taylor's people you can't drop because she's dropping the music industry coordinates their schedule with Taylor's people. Yeah man. And she just got her shit back. Just so we're clear. Yeah, yeah. So, but, but from a a business perspective, if, if Joe says, yo, not that you would do this, yo don't go over there and be on that podcast. I would, I would do that. Come here first. Right.


Come here first. You have to now look at a risk versus reward thing that if Drake is saying, I'm a, I got you my nigga, I'm gonna give you two free verses. Right. Those verses could take you outta here. You gonna get more spins than you ever got. You might get more streams than you ever got. Versus this artist like, yo dog, I know you my, I don't even know if they got personal relationship but you not as hot as Drake. Right? Right. So if he tells me, yo, do me a solid, I'm gonna do you a solid, it's a business decision that might have to be made. It's the black ball. It's, it's, it's another way to do it. And I don't think he's the that's what I'm saying. I don't think he's the first figure that's doing that. The, I think it's counterproductive. I mean I want to hear the verse more now.


Yeah, absolutely. From whose perspective you to be a fan fan. You talking about from a fan's perspective? Oh, I'm not talking about perspective. And that's what happens though. I want to, now you've put, I wasn't necessarily checking for this song. Right. So now Kendrick can just drop that, that verse himself. No, that verse is on the album. Come on. Yeah, it's coming up. Oh, okay. Because the album's not over there. Oh right, right. Because he moved right now with the other one. Like the, the verse we were talking about was Mayback Music six. It was a raw song featuring young thug, excuse me, excuse me. It was a raw song featuring Lil Wayne push and Pusha T Originally whatever calls were made pushes verse was removed from that. It went out as Ross and Wayne and then with the power of the internet.


No, I'm gonna upload this verse. Right. Somebody's gonna upload this verse and you just mix it. Right. I like Kendrick clearing his verse for this Clipse project, no matter what label it comes out on. Yeah, yeah. I like that. Yeah, he's big. That's not a given. So that's why say that's thing that's not a given. I didn't know that I could be clearing you because you over there the second that you go over there, I could put a nix to all of that. That's true. So he cleared it twice wherever you end up with it. So now imagine that I get to negotiate my new terms again with this, with a Kendrick first. Yeah. Yeah. And you know if everybody gonna run to it now, now they really, that's the best promo for this. It's like when Wayne looked out for me when she don't put it down, boy, I was talking to E one, like my dick was 30 inches.


I ain't gonna hold you got Wayne feature. I was talking to them niggas. Boy that's nice. Yeah. You got a nigga verse who's fucking better than you doing? Doing a little better label. React a little. Yeah. A little different. Yeah. I wanna progress the conversation. Joe, you've been one of the guys that gone against the, against the machine. And then now they're saying no, not now. They're saying as you being the person that did it, now they're saying that we up here may be afraid to speak on Rock Nation and the things that's talked about that's going surrounding it. What is your outlook on that as far as speaking on things?


Do you reserve? They said that nigga academics said that. What? Some other people. What weird you talking about? It's not just, it's a lot of people. So I wanna know 'cause you my man. So I'm down. I'm gonna say type of time you want. So meaning I don't speak on shit if I have a relationship. Me, I can identify if I have a relationship with somebody. I'm not speaking on it. 'cause I don't want to. Right. Regardless of how egregious it may come off, I'm not gonna speak on it. 'cause I, I respect my relationships. So like, if there was like a festival where things didn't go perfectly, you wouldn't like bomb shit on, I'm gonna fuck you up. Okay. No, I But I want to know when, when people say that towards you, that that's good for you though, as you being the guy. Five tickets to the tone deaf girl. You, you tried to distract me as you being, I'm not, let me tell, lemme try to, I don't, I I saw Ax say that I didn't see nobody else.


Couple people saw people saying, is there anything people follow like responding to that by saying no. I'm gonna be honest. I saw it was people tagging Yes. Post before he posted that. Like, yo, y'all not gonna talk about this. Y'all, I saw it. There was, there was specific topics that they feel like, ma'am we waited. Yes, ma Yes, yes. Yeah. Yes. Rock Nation. And I, I just wanna hear from you how you look at that, Joe. That's a good question. I, you know, maybe I be far removed from shit. I be, my brain be so different what the internet is saying. We don't know if we in my brain shut up. I was about to your cheerleader motherfucker. I'm talking to them too. Oh, okay. Okay. In your cheerleader fucker. What I'm saying is the, the Desiree story broke while we were still recording to me.


Yes. That's that story. But there has been is is the other Rock Nation story that people have run from up here quickly. 'cause we wanna advance this. There's there's been talks of Tory and stuff like that. Yeah. That the the the shit that Desiree herself is that, that can't possibly apply to this podcast. No. 'cause he talks to That's what I'm saying. That part would, that's what I'm saying that cannot possibly apply to this broadcast. But I think you speak of it over. I I don't, but I think what they're saying is that you don't identify that Roc Nation may be playing a role in why Tory Lane's in jail. That's the angle that they're taking. You never say that. You just say you're free. Tory, I said it but you never say, yo, I can see Roc Nation playing a part.


You never and well one, I don't have no proof of that. True. And it's bonkers. Just my take speaking for myself. Got it. I won't go that far. Got it. I don't think it's bonkers, but I don't have any proof of it. One and two, that's ho's company and I do have a certain respect for him. There we go. I don't know, I don't have a relationship with Desiree. I've never met Desiree. I don't like I don't have any, I don't have any equity there. Okay. So she's in the news now in a story that I'm sure we'll get to at some point. But that story just broke. But why? But, but why but Joe and even that I do have a a certain type of Pardon mark. A certain type of sensitivity to speaking about any story with anybody's children.


I agree. What's I was gonna say like why would you report this story? I want to be very clear on that. That's not a Rock Nation thing. Anybody story that include they kids and how they going about parenting or not parenting. I let that play out. I don't rush to I don't rush. Yeah, I don't rush to get to that. I can't let you do that. Do it. We ain't do that with Brian McKnight kids. Stop it. You didn't stop it. That is the truth my nigga. Do you have another, do you have another example? I'm just giving you an example. You said any story with anybody's kids, you just let it play out and we did not do that. Brian McKnight and Rest in Peace gets two later. I hate when y'all do that. When we making like a profound point and y'all bring up something that's just ass cheek stupid.


Brian McKnight denied kids and wanted nothing to do with his kids. I have a stance on that dog. We came, I I'm just telling you where I stand. I have a loud stance on people that want absolutely zero to do what they kids nor do I grant them the same rights and privileges as people who were trying to raise their kids. I'm lost. Do you have another example outside of I don't have another of this game one you said so now lemme get back to what I'm saying about how I carry it with people and their kids. And then you could announce how you carry it. I hate this gotcha moment shit. Nigga got moment bro. Shit. It don't make no sense. It ain't no gotcha moment now. Brian wanted nothing to do with his kids.


Ain't claiming his kids even in death freeze. Please leave me alone. Right now. I'm telling people about how I carry people with kids. I I I see, I see what you're saying. But I also see how it's different. Like, like another always be different when he tried that shit. Ain't trying nothing, bro. What you talking about it? Brian McKnight and Desiree Perez are not the same. I didn't say they're the same. Then why the fuck we talking about m sometimes we don't even want that feeling. Like, come on nigga. That's hilarious. Go ahead. I think that's h what do they have to do? Fuck I saying nothing to do with nothing. Joe. Go ahead. Mark. Freeze. I I I think you're right. I think we do talk about kissing tone. I think You right, we do. That's all I'm saying.


Right. I think it's important though. So I think a better statement might be that It is certain kinds of conversations we have and certain kinds we don't. For me one thing is, is it just about this person's business or does it advance a bigger story? Like for example, the only reason Vanessa Bryant was interested in me today was because it it we had a whole conversation backlash that was bigger. Right. That was bigger than her. Got it. So that even after we knew the story wasn't true, it was still worth talking about. To me, Brian McKnight's story is worth talking about 'cause of all the shit that comes with parenting and children also, he's on social media talking about his kids too, which is different than Dez who's not on camera saying, Hey, this thing happened to me. So I think that's different too. So for me, and, and, and the Dez story to me is only interesting if we're gonna report on it.


On it. I agree. And I don't think that's what we do here. You know what I mean? So, so I do think there's a distinc there, but there's a conversation there. How far, how far you willing to go to protect your child. Your child or to protect your children? That's a conversation. Yeah. We could have that conversation, but I'm saying I don't think it's, but the narrative on the internet is like, y'all are running from that story. It's like, well that's not a story that I think needs to be told me personally. The narrative, the narrative on the internet is anything ho slash Rock Nation. That's the narrative related. We won't touch ho Got You. Right. Right. That's just not true. That's not true. But that's the narrative. They make it seem like we, we all up here, we claim Avengers, we love Hove, et cetera, et cetera. So we're afraid of ho we can't say anything. I I'm that's The story. But is the story like something that should not have, it's not meant for public consumption and just it got leaked or whatever the is No, it's on the news.


No, it's on, it's on the news. It's out. It Is. I understand That. But the daughter sued her. It's out. Got it Said. Yeah. I just, I just don't think it's, to me it's not about the music business, it's not about black culture. It's just a story about this person who happens to be famous. If were she not famous, we'd have no interest in that story. That to me is why we don't talk about it. Only particularly the only reason why people care about It is 'cause she's affiliated with Rock Nation. I'm she's not, she's not Famous necessarily. Famous. She's an exec somewhere. That's that's true. That's, that's the only reason why they care. Yeah. Right. So all these conspiracy theories, y'all afraid is if like It is not Cove calls in and says no, we're not talking about that. Right. It is bullshit. That's the part I hate sometimes just working here for a short period of time, is I'm now being introduced to all the conspiracy theories about this show and all the stuff that people think we do and don't do.


You know all the people who call in and tell us what we can talk about, what we don't? Yeah. All the segments that get cut out that I never knew even knew happened. No, I let flip do that. 'cause I know how he fucks with the algorithm. Them narratives would die where they was birthed at. That's right. He's right to me. I would never respond to somebody that's saying, yo, you running from a nigga. No, he's right. Or the the real ice answer is, so it's my show. If I want to not speak about it, I don't have to speak about it. That would be an ice answer. Yes. 100%. Like, yo, you wanna talk about it? Go on your platform and talk about it. Platform talk about it. I agree for you. We reserve the right to say whatever, talk about what we want to or not talk about what we don't want to appear. And to flip's point, if I do have a relationship with you and it's some shit that's potentially disparaging or could get you jammed up, I reserved the right not to talk about it.


That's the real world. Right. And we're transparent about that. Yes. That's the real world. It's not like, we're not saying that that's the real world. Right. Go off, get off the internet, go outside. That's the real world right there. Yeah. Everybody got relationships. You hear something about somebody that you really fuck with. You might not talk about it. True. Or you might talk about it in your close circle, but you might, y'all ain't online and eh, fuck these niggas. And honestly, I just honestly don't really care about some of the stuff that the internet people are trying to spread about the Desiree lady. Yeah. Like some of that stuff that they think is real important. I don't care nothing about that. Like when I look at what's going the, the people that I know like in real life and love sing that lady's praises.


I never met her. Yeah. I do not know her. I know her and she's cool. Skip. I've only known about what I read and the people that I love that love her, they say that lady turned water to wine. But you know, you know why they saying these? Why they looking for somebody to have these conversations about her? It's a hip hop talk. If hip hop claim, we don't fuck with informants. We don't fuck with rats. We don't fuck with snitches. We don't do all of these things. And we apply this to certain people. Everybody's ready to ostracize gunner when they accuse, accuse him of being a snitch. And we don't even really know. So now you turn around and see Roc Nation and her shit is black and white. So people are saying, yo, what, what side of the fence are y'all on with that? Well, I'm not ever letting the internet help me form opinions.


One, two, I'm always with a redemption retribution story. Same here. Okay. So when I picture whole, it adds something to the whole, the Lord for me, I'm only speaking for me that Emery is next to him. Facts. I don't know Emery, to have a unpolluted pass, it means something to me that Tata is next to him. Like the people that he surround himself with, bigs whoever the fuck is over there. That means something. And if the internet go search, you're gonna find some unscr, what's the word? Unscrupulous, scrupulous things. Unscrupulous things like that ain't, that's not how everybody gotta learn.


How they form opinions of people. You being next to somebody that may have been unscrupulous in the past that don't just turn me all the way off from you. Especially if there's a redemption story involved. So that's just for me. Got it. But I've never gotten a check from Desiree. I hear that. She get 'em. I hear that. She get 'em going though. So that's the other take one. Now I'm telling y'all something from the people I, I asked, I asked, Hey man, what's up? Hey, what's up? What? They told me a few people. So what you want me to do? Sure. You got it.


Stupid. That's bad. Nah, hell, it's not bad you asking me. I just said yeah, It is it bad? No, no. My face was doing the water and the wine thing. She get it done. Multiple people have told me to add me to the list. She, I've seen her do some amazing shit. Yeah. She, She's been a part of hope team. Would you do business with for a very, very long time? What'd you say? Would you do business with her? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Interesting. The kind of business both to not do business with her 'cause she was part of some cartel in the eighties or some Oh, that's what you talking about. It's interesting. I'm asking about that. I asked him specifically. No, not that I know where i's going. I don't, I asked him in specifically because she's documented as an informant. Yes. With the cartel. Like that's what he just said.


Oh, but I'm that part the the the snitch part and what his stances on that. Oh It is issue. I thought that was, I thought that wasn't confirmed. If it's confirmed then No, no, no, no. That was confirmed then. Then I wouldn't. Oh, okay. There you go. Alright, cool. Yeah, that's why I said interesting. You said that we need a whole section of the game called Gotcha. No it ain't, It is just yo, this pod love a little gotcha moment. The Internet loves. Gotcha. Yeah. That's a very, I think Mark Lion again, I think that was a documented I think Mark Lion again. So the gotcha don't be mean niggas of lying. Joe. Now heads up that DocuSign will be over in five minutes as promise.


Oh yeah, right there. So Pusha also said that Kanye is, he doesn't look at him as a man. And he did say that he did 'em right by giving him his proceeds from the Def Jam contract. I don't know what the falling out was there, but it seems pretty, pretty deep rooted. That one I have no idea about. He expound. Yeah. Not particularly. Just A couple sentences. Yeah, I mean it was interesting. He didn't need to. Yeah, I mean mentioned the KKK hood and it looks like pro wrestler shit. And He had, he said this on, on the interview we did just nobody realized that. That's what he was saying.


Mm. But shit like the ear. Here it go. Ain't no Kanye, ain't no Kanye drama. I mean now the bromance That they had, this is in 2017. You know where they cool and then he shoot him in a verse or some shit. That's weird. Push bro. I Don understand bro. That's them. That's them. I can't be in the studio when Drake's there. I Can't. What do y'all think? Not like us, us means When listen, listen when, listen, when they go to Wyoming, I'm there from the first of the seventh. Alright, alright, alright. I catch you. I'm gonna catch you da da da. Next thing I hear on the eighth, boom. Drake here neither here for da, da da.


These many days, I don't know this, I'm not allowed. Everybody else can be there. I can't 'cause I don't play neutral. I don't do that. You don't get to shoot my homeboys and so on and so forth. It's not happening. Just not what I do. But I feel like Kanye should be taking that same stance. But he don't do that. Like, everybody not built like me, bro. What Do you everybody not meant? And you can't make people be built like you. That's, you can't make people. You, you, you Can't. This was the nicest way to I'm and this is the music Industry. This ain't the streets. Right. That's it. So I don't, I don't carry people like that. Right. I don't, it's like It is what It, if look, when I was growing up, if I wanted to go to the mall, if you couldn't fight, you couldn't come to the mall with me.


We could come back home and play ball all day. Oh, you was that guy. Yes. I probably You can't Come if you can't Come to the mall. I disagree with that though. If you can't, if we at the mall and I'm getting jumped, nigga go get help. But you can't fight. I'm gonna hate you forever. I don't wanna hate you forever. You're bugging right now. You bugging. I totally disagree with that. You're bugging And then his I disagree with that. His, his actual quote from the interview. No. Oh go ahead please. It says he knows. I don't think he's a man. He knows it. And that's why we can't build with each other no more. That's why me and him don't click because he knows what I really, really think of him. He showed me the weakest size of him and he knows how I think of weak people. And there's another part where he's talking about Kanye is too intuitive.


So he sees through me being fake. That's What that was the beginning of that quote. Let, let tell you something, he's a genius and his intuition is more, even more genius level. Right. That's why me and him don't get along. And then the finish of the quote, I really, I love that. I really like this. Push a guy, push his grace, Push it To you. I never met him, but for those that never met him, right. When you talk about principle Yeah. And morals. Loyalty and ethics. Respect being high and just carrying it a certain way. Like just being both sides of the coin. Peaceful but eh, You know what I mean? No peaceful, logical, but convict. I can go there. Push a T is one of the best humans in rap.


I never met him, but I like that. Not rappers. I like that guy. He's one of the best humans. Good dude. He carried it. He got a lot of that voice shit like just honor. That's how he sounds. So when he said now they attacking him now 'cause they're saying, which I disagree with, but they're saying, well nigga the fuck you was around him for, for so long if you felt that way. I disagree with that. I disagree. I disagree with that too. I totally disagree. I think, I think Kanye, I know what box to put you in. No, I think Kanye has displayed more of himself as the years have gone along. I don't necessarily think that back then Kanye was exemplify, I mean Con Kanye evolved into where He's now.


Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So I don't think evolved. It was the same. Sorry. You're right. Devolved Yeah, absolutely. To, to what he is today was devolved Regression rather than progression. Huh? You being scrupulous right now. Yeah. I think of con I think if Kanye was the man that, that he is today, 15 years ago, I don't know if push fucks on him like that. He says he, he's sick. I do believe that much. You're sick, but you're also very calculated. If I take your sickness in how calculated you are and disruptive you Ben and try to try it to me, then it cancels itself out I can't look at it as sick. 'cause you're detrimental. You're detrimental to everything. And shout to Push being the only guy in the world that could say fuck Kanye and then turn around to the Pharrell batch.


Right. I'm just gonna go hang out at LV for the next two years with my brother. When you talk about privilege, see niggas be trying to skip over push privilege. He got so much privilege. That's pretty fly That, but you get that privilege by being solid. Stand up. Yeah, that's true. True. You know what I'm saying? Like that's not an accident. I think Pharrell and Kanye admired that about him. Yeah. Yeah. How could you not? Yeah, I knew he was you. You could tell a standup person when he was saying how dude was calling around trying to pay for dirt on him and the people was telling him like, yo, we not even, no, nobody's, nobody's doing that. Same thing with Kendrick. I'm trying to get dirt on you. No, I wish I could tell you how I know that he was such a solid standup dude, but I can't Why not?


Can personal. Yeah. Illegal. Whoa, whoa. What's a form? No VLA 44. You good? Oh yeah. You said my last 44. What's up? I'm really looking forward to this push album. Yes. Clips, album clips. I mean I'm saying Push clips. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hey, I'm seeing the Malice, the no Malice Push talks back. I like It is back. Yeah, me too. I like it. Me too. I like it. What's wrong? Freeze. Learned him. He learned him. I got learned. Yeah.


I told y'all. I ain't saying that shit no more. I mean we, if we only judging off the song that they just put out, there's a conversation to be had Nick. Yeah. If we are only judging from that song, bam. You can judge Go to push last album. It's almost dry. The last song on there, malice is on there on the Nico album. There's Eclipse record. This one, there's like four joints just of recent. They talked about it in the interview. They said Malice is whooping ass all over this album. So. Oh word. Okay. Yeah, he definitely got busy on that track. I was, yeah, pleasantly. I was pleased doing This's always been nice. I think people are shocked at how nice he is coming off the break. But the break is why I won't never look at him like I look at Push.


But they also said that they were working for a while to get back in shape, I'm say but yeah, he might not have just, y'all just seen him. He might have been off the break for two years. He might've been off the break four years. If you lead a game and go play baseball for four years and come back, I ain't looking at you as the same as the dude that had to go and fucking fight. But you how for four years? But you know how many years I've been at Open Gym? You don't know how many years I've been at the pro workouts kicking these niggas asses. I just stepped back at MSG right now. We've also just seen so many instances in hip hop specifically where someone went Leaves and just falls off. Go, well not even leaves but maybe goes to the jail. The No like the the Christian Row or takes a different approach to lyrics and it don't Off Double Up sound real different than Harlem World.


You ain't lying. Ooh, That's a prime example. Yeah. Double Up sound very different. And I'm talking about the rapping, I'm talking about the production and the, I like double up. It ain't Harlem wasn't in Harlem World. No you didn't. Yes I did. You like double up for real. Yeah, it was cool. I ain't You would the second person. Did y'all hear Malice? It was, I pray you verse Double Up nigga, same nigga Niggas y fucking me up. It was Same Niggas and that's it on Double Up. I hated Double Up but Me Too. Shout out to me. I love that. I love making music. But that Double Up was trash. Hated that album. Did we hear what for? I pray for you on the, on the push his last album, him and Malice. No, you hear that verse because It is like people I acting shocked today and I, it's almost dry. It was like another critically acclaimed album of pushes.


I'm like, maybe y'all did not hear Malice verse on that song. I think a lot of people maybe didn't hear it. Yeah, Do do You think that that when, when like the fact that you took a break or not a break that you retired and you decided to jump back in. Would it be Rusty for you? How long you been retired again? 4, 5, 6 years. Rusty. When before people hurt. 10, almost 10. 10 years. Almost 10. And I told it'd be 10 years. Dang. So what I'm saying is that if you, that's crazy, right? If you decided to come back right. Would you fall on the rusty side or you fall on the side where damn Joe fell off. I would go brush. I would go brush out. You don't have to. Whether It is, I'm not just popping back but what back, what does brush up look like with you? Are you going into a camp? Are you getting up with some of your homies? Are you I'm getting with niggas.


It is gonna look like a writing camp. It is gonna look like the Dreamville sessions again. I'm going to get with rappers. Got you. Yeah. I need to See that feeling of niggas that come in the gym and do it. I thought about that last week. Right. And we can move on. But the fans' perspective of certain rappers, like from what you hear from the completed song to rappers perspective of rappers just when they walk in a studio, it's just a different vibe. Diff, dif different energy. Yeah. I think that's why a lot of the music suffering today too. Just because niggas ain't doing that. Yeah. Getting in the studio together. And that's true. And and feeding off each other. Energy writing. Now it's, I do it over here. Email it to you or no you said that.


Yeah. Let me ball this paper up and throw that shit over. Yeah. Rewrite some shit. You hear somebody say, oh nah hold on, this nigga bugging. Hold on. Nah, nah we ain't doing this like you heard Jim talk about the welcome to New York City shit. Yeah. And he was like, yo, them niggas was having like a oh he said that. Oh and throw that shit away and start from scratch because nigga in there kicking on your ass in the studio. It is a, It is a competition thing. Like Fab will never get the respect from fans that he gets from rappers who was in the studio and he walked in. So it's not gonna happen and it don't take him that long to do it. Does it when he get, when he go in there? Nah, he's special. Yeah. Game is another one.


We'll talk about him in a second too. Yeah. He ain't never gonna get the fan respect that he should have. Facts like the pressure from being in there with him or being in battle with this nigga. I was playing Spade when he fucking responded. He almost fucked up the speed. Where do, where do you think that come from? Right? What do you think the lack of respect. 'cause like when we think about Jadakiss, we give him the respect we think about pusher T he gets the respect. Where do you think that some of the lack of respect come from today? Today's again 'cause game is fire. But then do you think that, I don't wanna say shenanigans, but some of the things he did outshine absolutely 1000%. Got it. A lot of people care more about that outside shit than your actual And they'll let the image of you outside affect how they even receive your music. Yeah. You hit that on the head.


Yeah. That's what we have because when these people come in the studio, none of that mattered. When Wale come in the studio, whatever he did on Twitter ain't gonna matter. Like you gotta deal with this poet in the studio now or you Oh no, niggas didn't even come to the studio when I called. I know, I'm just saying. Or you didn't even play with me like that. Niggas might be like, oh Joe Button out here doing the stupid shit on Joe Button tv. But this nigga is a real rapper. All the niggas who say had something to say about job being corny or whatever. Whatever it was. Yo. But that nigga you busy though. Yeah, it was always a, it was always a caveat. Little Always. I don't care what anybody said it was. Nah, that nigga, they know what time It is. That's why I felt so comfortable rebranding and starting my career on the couch speaking to my friends. They know, come on, stop playing.


We didn't go down that road. We ain't even gotta go down that road. It is not about me. It's not about me y'all. Anyway. Stupid. Where were, where were we guys? The fuck was there any other points? It's about music. Oh, oh No, no. I was just asking was the, the was the Cliff notes of the article There? Any other points? Points? The hot topics. But it's a really good article. It's a really good read. Go check it out. It's in gq. Got it. Nice. Shout to journalism. Bringing it back right? Yeah like a good well-written article. It is like, oh shit. This is not like the blog. You said it was a long article, right? It is. It is a long read but a well-written read. It is good and long. It'll hold you nice try Yo's got me. Yeah Mark Yo's got me.


We not saying that shit Unpause. That's how I like him. Pause play. Whoa, whoa. No no, no. Now we playing now fuck it. We getting carried away. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was just a heat check. Pride.

She's, she's showing she's, I don't know who's behind her or what It is but At this point she's behind me. She's behind. It is gonna matter. She she got the Baker roll now. Yeah, she's behind. She's got the baker roll. I'm Behind me. You put a plan together and execute it. Who you gonna go get me? I'm gonna go home and get me. I'm the only nigga behind me.

Like oh shit this could be half of a new album. Yeah. Yeah. I don't usually like the deluxe but this is actually good.


Yeah, you anti deluxe. I'm super anti deluxe. I mean I will say I by the third version of MUTT it was like that. I wish they would've put a different beat or something in here. Mm. I wish they would've combined them more just Yeah. Fred Gibbs. I got Chris Brown already done. Big Sean, whoever is On there. I got you. Leon Thomas man. Yeah. Salute. I like when niggas come sit on this couch and then leave here and go turn bonkers. I mean he was going off before he got here. I'm not taking credit. Yeah. But nah, you know what I like when, when you meet him and some of these people are really just genuinely dope ass cool people. Like he sat on the couch, he was just very humble, kicking it, mad humble dope.

So how was, how was the OG able to convince you to not go out? Like what, what did she, what was the wild call you pulled out? Like, you know the wild, It is only one wild thing that needs to be Pulled. It's, I mean but what I'm saying is it's the biggest of jokers saying if you, if you're going down with a fight, so there's only but a little bit of ammo that like when my wife, I argue with her, there's only one thing that she can say. She has to catch me dead to rights with me. This, ah, you got me. But if she don't, if you just speculating, nigga, I'm, I'm going down nigga I Tyson. So don't you just Busta Douglas don't you pick a bow battle?


You pick battles? No, I'm every battle. It's all war. Every battle is me all the time. Everybody. I mean now I do because now I pick the battles 'cause my children are older like Prince Jordan, princess and Nico and Jr. They older now. So they checking me like, nigga you sound, they checking me in the kitchen in conversations yo pops you sound like an idiot talking the ball. See but see but I feel like if you can't sound stupid talking to your your girl, then who can you sound stupid talking to? I agree. I should be able to throw some wise at the wall. All and now let me just hear your response. But now don't get tired like you intentionally are doing now don't get tired, exhausting. Don't that shit sound like a headache and don't, I'm listening to you and flip. But you gotta see if your wife head is on a swivel.


Nigga. What you gotta see if you understand. I disagree with what, what he's saying. I I no him, I don't know why he's just saying. Yeah, I, no, It is not tiring. You gotta understand. You gotta understand the formula. It is crazy. Yeah. You don't think it's tiring to her. You bought a whole new iPad for your girl's car. That was, that's hell freeze. Shots freeze 12 years ago. Don't talk to me you shit what I talking about old shit. Wait 12 years ago? Yeah. This nigga mad about a bet from four years ago. You bringing up, well hold up. I'm old enough. 12 years ain't that long. That's 2013 nigga I was outside. That ain't that ain't he on to go like the kids make it. I'm talking about picking a fight. I'm talking about just, just no, no, no, no, no. Not picking a fight. You said throwing some wild conversations.


No, that's during a fight. We didn't pick a fight. Your girl brought the fight. So we end the fight already. We in the fight. I'm trying to explain shit. Yes. So you may say something that is a little out. Like when I was trying to defend shorty cooking for me, I just walk out. He better than me. That was, I can't talk. I got threatened. I get a comment on that. Got I got threatened, I get caught with a gang. You get your, and then my girls, you try to be fucking, fucking a psychology major and when you go sit over there, that's when you start yourself start smoking again. And that's when you, that you Mr. Gym and your whole life, your whole life. When you make one wrong misstep, that's where all your missteps line up.


She was cooking. Oh God. My girl is a psychology major. I don't put, you know, I don shout, they check everything around this nigga if she can, she gave me a look. Yo. Hey so to answer your question, I submit when the only thing I have left to say is y'all wanna do what I want. I agree but I feel bad after because that's it. Like in the relationship. That's what It is in the relationship. It sounds bad. Yeah. Sometimes you just wanna do what the fuck you wanna do. Man, I told my wife, I don wanna have do that from time to time. I don't wanna have to consider you all the time your ass nigga. You should be allowed to do that from time to time. But hold on folks to say, to say it you should be, but hold on to say it to your significant other.


That's one of your semantic keys right there. That's one of your se keys. I'm, before I say that on girl, I'm, I'm gonna apologize. Say I'll correct the behavior because that's when you can't say to your partner, y'all wanna do what the fuck I wanna do. I feel bad after I say that. And how would you feel this nicer way to say it. How a nicer way nigga. How would you if that, if that was said back, yo, I just wanna do what I wanna do. You can't say that back to me. Sometimes I need space for myself. Well that's the part where I know that I'm wrong too. Like at the part in the discussion where I say if you was doing what I'm doing to you, I would be gone. True. I think she knows that. But then she replies with like feelings.


Hey how do you think that makes me feel when you say that? Oof. And then I'm like, oh you actually saying some shit like that Joe, have you met Joe button? Joseph Anthony button is what's born with y niggas Ish. You could say he's a crazy person. Yes. That's being honest. Yeah. No, my partner, my girl holds me accountable and she will hold the mirror up. When I say some nut shit again, I feel like I should be able to be my unadulterated self with my partner. If my wife did half the shit I did, nigga, nigga I might fucking fall into a tunnel. Nigga. I tell her that. Tell my girl what the fuck would I wanna be with me for. So if knowing that if you wanna be properly, you wanna be politically correct, get him flippy pandering.


No, he's, I don't think he's pandering. He, I think he believes he's a great man. What I'm saying is that you say things like that, I feel bad after I say it. That's what I was trying to tell you. I won't say that. Yeah, they're called intrusive thoughts. I wouldn't say that at all. You're not being honest. S not if you think about it, you're not being honest. It goes back to his point. Ooh. If you think, if I think to my wife that yo hey you smell something. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not cooking. That's my man cooking. But I like banana bread. No, not at all. Nothing. It is cooking. If I felt this way, your your theory earlier was it say how you feel. True. So I feel like I can do whatever I want. Don't tell me what to do and you can't do what I do. It is saying this because way not a relationship. Relationship.


That's not what I said earlier. I said when my girlfriend asked me a direct question and I give an answer contrary to how I really feel. That's a lie. That's what I said earlier. Got it. But I'm saying this, if I know that something I'm doing, I wouldn't want done to me. I don't now tell my girl, look, if you did all the shit I was doing, bitch I'll leave you. I don call that bitch. Oh yeah, I didn't do it. Fuck the bitch part. You could take that out yo, I would leave you. That means basically I I would've have a power and a control over you that you don't have over. I'm over me. Do you know my wife that power and control? My wife say fuck you. We on air. So get it off. Yeah. Get it out your system. You think I'm lying? No, I don't think that you are lying.


That would be he thinks You're omit facts. No, no. No one fact or omitting facts lying. I don and thought long enough. You think it something that you do to your girl that, that I wouldn't want done to me. Yeah. True. That's all I'm saying. Wouldn't my girl it you're not being honest. He's think you would keep it in his head. I'm not gonna say like I would've my list. Got it, got it, got it. The shit that I'm doing, you corner yo no. When somebody ask you a direct question, you omit what you really, but your wife would ask you why lie? Your girl would say, why did you do that? But, and my answer to her would be, but wait now do you preach this to 3 75 word? Is it possible that he looks at that list as an intrusive thought? Which is what you're trying to omit from the conversation. What One was asked a direct question?


Come on. Wasn't that, is there any chocolate chip? I'm trying, what are we talking about? Put the bag. Wait, who get muffins? You say freeze. Niggas just starving is starving. Flip is cooking donuts. Your girl could, your girl could still say to you, why did you do this? And the truth would be I did it because I want to do it. But the the the real thing to do is not to tell her that It is to keep that to yourself. 'cause it can hurt her feelings. So how do you answer that? Why did you do it? Well I answered it the way I just said it and my wife cursed me out and then I, I feel bad 'cause she don't give up. She not with none of that shit. Now I know you, when you was broke, you was a bum. She start talking her shit and she's telling the truth and I have to eat that.


So I da fixes it. So now in, in the future because of my feelings. That's a good one. It was. Yeah. Say it again. Him. Nothing. It wasn't against you keep going. Yeah, because of my feelings. I want no problem. No, no, no me, We good because I don't want my feelings hurt because what she said, I I don't go down that route unless I'm ready to hear that. I gotta prepare for that. I don't like to hear the truth from my, my wife. Yo nigga you was nothing nigga. We sleeping on the floor nigga you couldn't do nothing nigga I gave you my checks nigga and all that shit to, she don't say nigga but y you was flipping the income tax. No I gave you all that to put to get where you at now look how you talk. He was just straight then you got, then you got your chi, then you got your children listening. So my daughter would come like, yo, I heard that. That sounds crazy. I don't believe in that. And I, and my daughter's telling me this. I don't believe in that.


I would never want to date a man that thinks like that. I don't believe in this is my daughter. So then now there are real things in your life that's happening that makes you have to feel to yourself. And while in the moment I'm just being a dickhead to my wife just to win an argument. 'cause in all reality I may not feel that way but I do feel that way. You just wanna win. Yeah. Yeah. You just wanna win. And I do do what I want but it's not good when you are in a household full of people. So I learned that when I do what I want, the worst case scenario lies ahead. So true. It is best for me to just do what she want me to do. Nigga, you mad. That's what till you get your daughter, you ain't wrong. Wait till you, that's what I'm saying.


It is the safest choice. That's what I'm saying. So I'm Chilling, consideration and communication bro. You knows what's best for me. I don't really sometimes. So we don't know what's best for ourselves. Yeah. It takes somebody else from the outside to look. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It it's true. That's true Caribbean shit. You right. Also in music, Tiana Taylor announced that her album is coming in August. I wasn't gonna report on that 'cause that's my friend. So I ain't wanna look like, I'm like hey Tiana. But the name of album is Escape Room. That makes me want to report on it now because I tried to tell Iman ass and now see that's why I don't date girls that could write a song.

Like her first two albums.


Incredible Cult Classic to me. Total Playthroughs. Yeah. Cult classic to me. No excuse. It is phenomenal. The only person still giving us some of that. Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson vibe. Can't wait for it. That's all I have in music. I don't have anything else in music that needs our attention. Let's go Mel Speak. You know, just speaking of like, you know Lenny Kravis? No, not, oh, sorry, not Lenny Kravitz another very talented female vocalist. Money Long made the blogs this week because she went live and I guess somebody was in her comments trolling her and she made a couple of comments about black women always seeming to be the ones that disparage her.


Like I have the clip lined up so I don't wanna like speak for her. Can we play it? Do you mind? Oh yeah, but go ahead. You don't, you can't, can't say this. You wanna do it. Of course. I don mind feel like now you be asking the trickiest questions to You. But I just, I I have like a, a lead up question for all of you to this. I, that was crazy. I feel like I know where ICE stands on this, but I'm just gonna play it. I stand with ice. We know careful Only ever black women that say they don't like my personality. You notice that because I'm being myself. I'm like, just like your rag mom and your aunties with them. Ashy can. That's how they act.


There's something wrong with my personality. You don't like me. Exactly. Take a look in the mirror. Ho you don't like you. She sounds charming. She's great. Who are you? They be like, oh, she's so what you want me to do? You, what It is, is you're a bully and you used to people living down, letting them do whatever. I'm not that. It's never gonna be that. Okay. So basically she says like in the, she compares it to your raggedy mom and your aunties and shit like that. So a lot people Ashley Kinkle. Yeah, Ashley Kinkle. Yeah. So she's, she's, it's divided in terms of like criticism. People saying, well, I mean if it, if it don't apply, let it fly kind of thing. And then other people are like, yo, this is your fan base. You're talking about black women and you know, now you're insulting us so you're canceled, et cetera, et cetera.


Who's criticizing her? I'm, I'm, I'm In her lives. She's basically saying the only criticism that I receive is from black women. I see. Being a black woman. You know. And so people are just like, well that's your fan base. So what do you, I guess in no, in certain terms are basically saying you can't respond to the criticism of the people from your fan base. What, what was the question? I'm sorry man. You said you had a follow up question for us. Like in terms of being forward, what, Wait, Are you ordering food right now nigga? I ain't do the same shit. She, I fucking hate when I start talking DoorDash. I didn what?


Outta here. I mean responding emails and all. Y'all ain't shit. I'm listening. We're listening. Disrespectful. Ain't shit bodying that shit. Like you give us killing that shit. No Mel, you give us such a long runway killing that shit. You give us a long runway so get your shit off. They just take a long time. Yeah, I'm just, it takes like an hour to it. It is like the Newark runway, you body that shit. Go for real. Hold the question about how we please man. Ma'am please. In terms of being forward facing and responding to criticism. It's just What do you think? That's what that's, that's why I be laughing. That's why I be laughing. I don't want no smoke. I just wanna know what she think. What do your back hurts. Today's why I Oh yeah, your ass.


Finally think of, what do you think as a black woman? I love Imani. Lemme just, I think your opinion is the most important. That's I'm asking. I I contribute too. More room full of guys. Yeah. I wanna contribute too, but I just wanna know what you think. I have thoughts something I think that, I think she's absolutely right. I think that there's a lot of times mo Some these black bitches. No, I would never say that, but I would say that the majority of criticism that I have received over the course of my career Yeah. Has been from black, From women. Hello hella Buffy. Lemme ask a question about that. Shut up. Oh shit. Lemme ask question with that. That's totally different. Totally Ish. Watch your fucking about. That's totally different. Not you ma And can we can go, we could go back to that. It was, It is totally different.


Why are you talking to me? I didn't say that shit. 'cause you, you looked at him like he was cooking right now with that fucking gun. I didn't laugh neither nigga. He said thought was about to laugh. I'm not cooking at all. Just in case nigga. Come on, nigga. Starting shit said crazy. That was your laugh breath that you took. Don't laugh about, boy. Anyway. No, I'm taking this topic seriously. I want, I wanna engage seriously about this. Don't wink at me my nigga. I I know It is true that we can be the hardest one each other. Right? But I'm also wondering, I mean this with all due respect, like is It, is it possible that white people just don't know who you are?


I don't mean you. I mean like money or you or who like this is the audience or black. Shut up Courtney. No. Stop. No, that's not funny. Corey, Are we really gonna act like people don't know who she is? She Knew Sat right here. No, That's not on one of the biggest platforms in the fucking world. That's not what I mean show so seriously. That's not what I mean. No, I'm, no, I'm not even you. I'm addressing the fucking room giggling up a storm. Like, you know, is it possible people don't know who the who she is? If people didn't know who she is, Joe Button would not have had her up on this fucking platform. Let's Go, let's go. For sure. I'm saying the primary basis Is very choosy about who the fuck comes up here up Here's true. You know what I'm saying? I'm just saying the primary base black people, I'll let you anybody up here? Yeah, exactly. Squashing with that nigga. Yeah nigga. So like for example, if Kanye West up, you had them people on your stream, nigga fucking performing nigga Mark was just sleep on his dream again.


Caught your ass. You'll not stay awake man. What you want me to do? Get so rest. You want awake at night, you'll be awake at the daytime. Go brother. I'm sorry. No, I'm just saying like, it it, I'm sure money long is, is right to the extent that like we're hardest on each other. And I'm sure she's gotten some unfair criticism, but I'm saying part of the disproportionality of it might just be that the bulk of her base is black and probably black women. That's true. In the same way your primary audience is gonna be black people. Right. The same for me. You know what I mean? So yeah, most of you know. So there's certain criticism I'm gonna get from certain kinds of people. It'll be like me saying most of the people that criticize me are academics. Oh yeah. 'cause that's who I've been talking to for last week. So I'm just wondering how much of, how much of It is that The numbers game? Yeah, it's the numbers game. I'm just asking. I, 'cause I don't know enough about money long to know. I'm asking like how much of It is that you think ml, to your point, a lot of people outside of black people might know her music and not know it's her.


It's Possible. Yeah, That's what I mean. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say. Yeah. Like she has certain songs that's like, oh I know that record. Oh it's her. Oh, didn didn't know that. So that she get a lot of that to her. Do you feel like there's any validity to money long statement? Probably. I don't know enough about her to have an opinion. No, I'm just talking about people in your field that look like you dressed like you. Oh yeah. As I said, we the hardest for each other. That's we do. So what I'm saying is that shouldn't the real question be how do we navigate through that? How do you handle that? That should be, that should be the question instead of One of the things that I noticed when And why are we so quick to, to criticize people who look like us? I mean I think that's another, yeah, That is a very real question. And one of the things that I thought about her when she came up here is she was very no nonsense. Like she was very like, I'm, I'm her and I am and that's it.


Like you can't, you can't tell me nothing about myself kind of thing. So she looked like the kind of person that would buck back at criticism. You know, for me personally, I've always audited. Okay. I'm not, I'm not doing this ball Fish. I'm listening to you. I hate when you, I hate when you two do. It is new fricking fry Shit. In fairness. This time calling You out on your shit. It had nothing to do with you. Man. I swear this time Joe Flip Joe wasn't even listening to Flip. He was. He was still trying to Yeah. And I'm trying to, trying to get Wasn't Express trying get Express. I was trying to get the phone from him. Mark. No, I know you're trying to get the phone and he was, I order to order phone. He was trying to do priority delivery. He trying to get here between where LA is fucking shit. I would order something. Please go ahead.


Go ahead Ma'am. I was just basically saying that she has a different stance on shit. She seems like I'm not gonna take criticism, I'm not gonna keep, have people disparaging me on my fucking platform and I'm gonna come for you the same way you're coming for me. That's not the way I personally would've handled it because that's, I'm, I've been conditioned by this industry to always be like, you know, perfect and poised and hide how I'm truly fucking feeling. Yeah. But I felt the exact same way that she has felt. I'm like, yo, like I can't, I can't fucking win for losing. There Was a moment when you, so why haven't you voice that sooner? I, listen, what was it two episodes ago? I basically said I had a whole, you know, kinda light bulb epiphany moment as to how much I edit and audit the things inside my head for years and years and years.


You were, you were sitting right where Mark was. I remember, I remember. And you were like looking at me like I was a fucking science experiment. And I literally said that, you know that I'm not going to do that anymore because I'm just, I'm, I'm sitting in who I am and I'm and I'm just like gonna adopt a not give a fuck attitude that I never really had before. I acted like I had it, but I didn't. You know? So I always aired on the side of caution And She's no longer filtering herself. Neither. She's expressing how she feels. Yeah. It feels better. Better. Which I appreciate. Exactly. It feels better to express how you feel rather than feeling like you can't, you can't express yourself for fear of retribution or people canceling you or whatever the case is. Oh shit. These niggas got a Stro bowl. Yo, stop.


You know what? Order that for me bitch, You do order. Bring my fucking Lunch. I had it with your shit. There We go Mel. Order me the goddamn Stro bowl. Yo, why you Yo, why you press the order nigga? Aw extra Beef Bitch. Why you order it nigga? Thank you. He clicked the order I wanted to put my order in man. I got send it back. God Damnit should see a Stro bowl on a menu. Alright, forget it. That was a big a big thing. Anyway. Disrespect. It really wasn't, but okay. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead anyway man. Oh Tommy's Place. Oh my God.


I love her. Did You have anything you wanted to add to this? No, To Corey. You don't have a mic? Shut the fuck up this. No, I did. But I think you said everything. I said Everyth. You said everything. You wrapped it up. Austin. You said you said it. What's, what's the nigga from the Apollo? You said man, honestly that's, there's no way to fire man. Yo. If Mel leave this show an integral part. Walk out that door with her. Mel, I'm not going anywhere. Listen, I move out the way when I could tell Mel got a topic. 'cause somebody said something she wanted to say but didn't say it.


Facts. When, when facts got a topic, 'cause somebody said something that she wanted to say and she could use them to, I got clear. I could use them as like a battering ram. Not a battering ram. No more like plus the ventriloquist as a voice. Ooh, I like that. Yeah Girl. What lastly in music, I seen the LA rapper list. The complex list. Yeah. It is not my business. Okay. I saw a game reply. I saw him create a new list. What number was the game on that original list? I wanna say 11. I think wherever he was, he disagreed.


He didn't care for that. Yeah. And he put out a list. What I do like about his list is their list. I saw one to 50. His list was one to 100. I like that. Like you know more LA rappers than con players or, or I included more niggas that didn't necessarily get their props. Yeah. So you get to it. So it's not you just highlighting you on games list. What number, where did he fall? He was number five. Five on his list. He put himself as number five. Yeah. How do you guys feel About that? I'm not mad at him being, I gotta see who the four four are before I respect just not putting yourself as number one. Pac, Snoop Cube, Kendrick Pac. I have some Criterion questions. Criter and the complex list didn't have PAC on it. Yeah because they didn't put Pac for example, on the complex list because he is not an LA rapper.


I mean in lots of ways, even West Coast rappers to me is is more of a, It is more palatable. It is more plausible. But that's a stretch. I he moved to Marin County when he was 16. But we could say the same thing about people who grew up like what's his name? Grew up in Philly. From Philly but to West Coast. Correct. Corrupt. Right. So I get it. But number five for me, he would be higher on my list. Would he be? Yeah, he'd be, he would've been three on my list but, but four. I'm sorry. Four on my list. But I wouldn't have had Pac because I don't consider Pac a la artist. So I'm gonna give you the top 10. I'll give you complex just, I'm just gonna do 10 and then I'll give you games. 10 Nipsey Hussle.


This is complex. List nine. Eazy E eight. Be real. Seven Ice-T six. DJ, quick five. Tyler the creator. Four. Dr. Dre, three Ice Cube, two Snoop Dogg, one Kendrick Lamar. And then on Games list, top 10 is Exhibit Eazy. E, Dr. Dre, dj, quick, corrupt the Game. Kendrick Lamar, Ice Cube, Snoop, Dogg and Pac. Yeah. Nah, that's in off for me for one. I think Easy. E is too high. I think Eazy e's too high. Mm. E even forget about the fact that he, I'm not even talking about the fact that the Ice Cube wrote everything.


Right. Which is a big part of it for me. And that's not like a, that's not urban legend. That's just a fact. Right? That's a fact. You right. It's just a fact. Eazy ain't had the best Eazy ain't had the greatest float or delivery certainly to me, not enough to be above exhibit. Not to be above Nipsey. Not to be above J Rock. Not to be above schoolboy. I mean there's a, there's probably 30 people I put in front of EZE as a, as a rapper. And I, I, I give him some credit because of the time and the era what he meant to that era. Yeah. That's a lot of credit. That's a lot go there though. That's a lot. But he didn't write it and he didn't deliver it. Well neither did Dr. Dre. I think Dre's too high for the same reason we going. I don't like the, although Dre was a lot better rapper to Easy to say who wrote and who didn't. Easy didn't deliver it well was like last. Yeah it's kind crazy. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? You think it, You think, you think Zy Flow Ont beat for example, you go back and listen to Easy's music go back to listen.


It is what of my personal easy rapper a lot. Yeah, but we, it sounded good though. I don't think I don, I don't think he's terrible. I just think there's a lot of people better, You know what I mean? He wouldn't be, I don't think there's only people in the world go listen to Straight Outta Compton and all that, that in the, all of that shit. Oh shit. It come them mother fucking nothing about that was nigga like the verses I know him from in 90, 91, 92 when my older brother was doing it. NWA what he was saying on those joints. I think his voice is too instrumental to hip hip hop as a whole. Straight outta Compton. Another brother that smother your mother.


He wasn't offbeat. I can't shit on him. I think what you're saying is like in hindsight, in hindsight we could say whatever that came after that voice and the flow and all, but in it time he was the shit nigga. I, and again, I'm outta my business. I'm not telling LA people how the feel about no LA people. I know my list would go differently. My list would go different. 'cause when they do these lists, that complex list said LA's best rappers. So I guess it's impossible today for people to put names on a best rapper list without mentioning your accolades and how much you achieved in rap and rap music. Yeah. Right. See for me, I don't always do that.


As far as rap goes as ability. When you do the, when you talk about best rap I I, my my list be more so the You have ears. Yeah. Ra Cast and I wanna say, I'm glad you said that up that list bro. From the Athletes, the Athlete podcast today when they mention players and how great they were, they go to what version of them they're talking about. And I think that should happen more in hip hop. Like when they talk about Dwight Howard is like 2012 Dwight Howard in hip hop. Like you say RAs Soul on Ice. Raca, you're not naming 20 rappers. You can't rapper a bunch of nigga you're not naming a bunch. You still rap screen bro.


You're not naming 20 West Coast rappers that rap better than Crook Facts. True. You're not naming, I Don Don't Care whose list you're not naming 20 Corrupt is on that list for sure. Yes, for sure. And it still sounds Good. Yes. Like Kup was something different back then. Death Certificate, Ice Cube shit and Ice Cube Predator and Death Certificate and America American Ice Cube Excuse Ice Cube. Ice Cube should be solidified Regardless. Yeah. Ice Cube is number one for me. Ice Cube. But then top three. So my thing I think, I think criteria comes into play. Oh, Kenrick now probably. Right? I think criteria has to come into play because when you start talking about Snoop and what Snoop meant to hip hop and I can only imagine what he meant to West Coast, California, hip hop then Ice Cube to me raps better than Snoop.


But that don't still mean Ice Cube would be higher on the list. Ice Cube raps better than Snoop Ice Cube has a better discography than Snoop Ice Cube. But still markers nothing. Yes he does. I don notice he does his own. Personally. Yes, personally. Personally. Personal Percentage wise, but I don't know about overall. Overall That's tough. I mean if you take, if you take Ice Cube's, three biggest albums, right? I love Ice Cube. And then you take Snoop three biggest albums. What are Snoop's three biggest albums? Oh, we gotta go. We gotta Style Style by name. The other ones we gotta go, we gotta go to one with the one with, you don't know the name names de dropping like his hot on it. Rhythm Gangster. Yeah. Yeah. We gotta go there and then we gotta go. What would the third one be? See that's my point.


We go Ice Cube Murder Murder album. That was just the soundtrack to the movie soundtrack. It's not his sound. Discography by way. Lord Was the Case is a song on doggy style discography singles Too. Disc includes singles too and features. If you go to someone's discography, it doesn't just show their albums. That's Where Snoop, that's where Snoop catches up I think. And actually Pat, he does it. He passes them. He does it because you look him on a crime, you look at Snoop on a crime, he doesn't because now you gotta bring NWA A into this argument. So you mix NWA A and out cube in this argument. He's gonna Ice Cube lead snoop by mile I don disagree with. I disagree with that. I mean, I don know if that's true. I think the answer is Ice Cube too. But I don I don't think it's, I don't think it's, I don't, I don't disagree. I just don't know if it's true. I'm saying I don need to hear more. Think Snoop is bigger on the list based on his impact in hip hop and West coast hip hop.


See, I, I have a, but if we talk about Ice Cube as a rapper, bro, Ice Cube is one of them and he don't get the credit. There was a time when Ice Cube was considered one of the top two or three great rappers ever. He was top rapper in the world at one point. Oh, I'm gonna fuck it. Y'all, y'all suit me up. Y'all suit me up. I got enough up. I thought you was about to spit a freestyle when a beat dropped. You got instrumental.


He can't Rap, he can't rap over that temple. No, he gimme Something, gimme something better. Gimme an instrumental formula. Snoop Dogg is the West Coast version of Busta Rhymes. Yeah, I See that. I'm not bad at that. I'm Not bad at all in that Bust. Ain't got no doggie style but Carry That's true. No. Huh? No, he don't. He don't have doggie Style. He don't have, don't Even go. He don't. He don't. Oh yeah, I agree. Agree. He don't have a dog style. But I think both of them, I think most best rapper lists are made without either one of them in the top 15 when it comes to rapping. Yeah. Yeah. I would agree with that. Like they both have accomplished and as far as songs and features and they did all of that shit. But when people are putting these lists together, I think niggas misplaced Snoop the way they misplaced, bust the rhyme.


I don't hear that happen with Ice Cube. I never hear that happen with Ice Cube when niggas named a top 10, top 15 Ice Cube named both Coasts. And the second is in that mode. The second is not up there. Like you said, both coasts. Somebody saying, yo, where's Ice Cube? Where's Ice Cube? I agree. I agree. Down South. Yo, where's Ice Cube? Yeah. East Coast. Yo, where's Ice Cube? So that's why I said I don't know what the criteria was. I don't know what the criteria was, but it's not a bunch of niggas that you could just say flat out can rap better than Ice Cube. Bro. I don't want Dre, I'm 50. I personally exclude Dre into Mark's Point. Easy. Just 'cause it's like the rapper. Did you write your Rhymes thing personally for me. Gotcha. Gotcha. See I don, I don't Put, if we count that out, then Dre has to be somewhere in that top something.


What? Top what though? Anybody Top 10? Somewhere in the top 10. Just from the chronic alone. I mean, you gotta be in a conversation. Don't wrote 100% of his rhymes. No. He had other people writing. No, he said that that to him. Oh. Of Snoop's. I don know. I don know. Snoop has never, Snoop has talked about people who rhyme. No, he's talked about people writing his, he picked up about Jay Wright brought some shit fan talking about the the Jay. You not Talking about Talking about. No, but Snoop Snoop in his most recent album, he did an interview, he interviews with me where he said, I asked somebody to write on my album for me. He's, he's told me that personally on the interview. So I I can, it's not rat. He's documented saying that. Yeah, but but that's new shit. He didn't do that in his prime. I mean he's he's 50 now. Yeah. I think a lot of rappers at 50 55 say, you know what? I'm cool. Just making music now in his prime.


To my knowledge, Snoop did write all his rhymes. Listen, I won't, I won't say nothing bad about none of the people we talking about. It is all great. No, they're all great. And again, I think that's LA business. I wouldn't want LA niggas chiming in talking about a New York list. Even though WAC 100 and a few niggas jumped out there talking about Game is better than Jadakiss, I guess when they were doing their equivalency thing or trying to help people understand. So then that conversation tried to take off for a minute. I wrote it down just in case anybody here wanted to try to make a compelling argument that the game is better than Jadakiss or should be ranked higher on all time rapper list. I'll, I'll entertain it. I'll entertain it. I think if we're talking about strictly like if we get back to the technical rap shit, I, I would absolutely hear that argument.


I think Jadakiss as amazing as he is, rhymes fairly similar for the most part. What do we Care Game can wrap a whole bunch of different styles and, and fast slow tempo doesn't really matter. What About what's being said? They both got bars. They both, yeah, they both, they both got bars. I can, I can understand the argument. I'm not, I don't know that I would Kiss would be higher on my list probably, but I don't, I don't think it's a bad argument. Some if somebody said the opposite, I wouldn't argue with him. I wouldn't fight that wouldn't that wouldn't be the Hill I would die on. I I think Game is an underrated rapper. Very much so. Game Is really good at rapping. No, but he's highly underrated again, based on we looking more of a personality or a public figure. Yeah. Or you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like more so than yo this nigga could really, really rap and it and it became this thing to say he name drops all the time.


All the verses. Which I always thought was an unfair criticism. One, all rappers have their own tics and their own things. But I think that's dope. I think it's a dope style thing. I mean it'd be like saying push all you talk about drugs every song. I mean like people do things and I, I don't think that that's a problem. But I hear a lot when we were, when we used to write a lot about him, we would, it became a thing for music journalists to say all the time as if that was like a, A DeMar against not. Yeah. And I'm like that's how he raps. See I think they both are great rappers. I think where Game Edges Jadakiss is Game can make an album. His songs No. An album. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's not bad. Jadakiss, as much as I love Kiss, kiss is a great 16 bar rapper. He will give you amazing verses. But when it comes down to making an actual album top to bottom, he don't have it now.


50. Oh but 50 would step in and say neither this game. That's not true. You could take documentary off the table. He still has. Yeah he does other great great Not Good Ice is Right. His third album is great. You right, You right, You right. Ice is right. His third album was really great. Jesus piece. Amazing album. I love piece really good. That's Love. L la amazing album Doctor's Advocate. Amazing album. He can doc two. Yeah. Especially when you put 'em both together. Two and 2.5. Yeah. Game can do that over and over and over again. So you keep Game Game as a better mc on on the list anyway than Jada? The overall Yes, I would have 'em but if we just talking about lyrics. Lyrics because Jada kids got more classic verses right? When I was about to say that I wouldn't even dignify her conversation with anybody that has Game rank higher than Jada.


'cause you're my friend so I'll do it. I just said overall, like I said, I I, when we talk about I do sliders. Yeah I agree with I. Who's y'all. I'm not saying that you so raspy you can't talk. I'm with your talking about Imani. Well he made another good point. What did he say? What Amani say? I can't hear Armani. Iani signed the J So Raspy Jadakiss is labeled. It still is and it's still there for Lifetime Watch out Boy. Like the 10 album deal. I got that perpetuity. I I agree with you. Game makes a better album than Jadakiss. I won't argue with it. Okay. I want to but I won't. What would be your argument? I mean if you took so DE's argument to have that Jadakiss makes better albums than Game.


I don't think that Jadakiss is first album is as bad as people say It is. His albums aren't bad. I wanna be clear. I don, I don't like that name. I think Jada, he has that classic album. He might not have the alright but I don't think he, that's not that need it to be. Yeah, I don't care about that. I think it's tough to make a good album and Jadakiss to me has good albums. I agree. Now I may like a game album more, but when we talking about impact, like you said versus over the span of your career, Jadakiss comes out more impactful than all of the games albums put together. See I'm calling just solo. 'cause again a lot of the Jadakiss stuff, once we do that, if we just saying rapping, it's, you gotta count the lock shit in there.


You gotta count a lot of that. I'm talking about just solo Jadakiss, everything you've done solo game, everything you've done. I could see the argument where game would be and it might be one spot. It ain't like it's leaps and bounds. It is. It is. They're definitely on the same level. They're close. They're not anywhere near on the same level. They be on same tier of the list. I'm saying on the same tier of the list. They're not on the same tier list. Really Jadakiss is a top 25 mc no matter who you talk to, game is a top 50 mc. And I think, I think that's too low ranking. Yeah, I don, I think if you got him, he ain't top 50 to me. Alright. Where is he? Right? Like I said, him and Kiss are right there. So if you got Kiss' top 25 I No, no, no, no, no.


Fuck have him have I'm have to really sit down and do this list and you know we talk about this a lot. It's hard to do these lists. See I'm talking to somebody that's done this list a million times. It is gonna be tough for you to put game higher than 35 on an all time list. But you told people would have Jadakiss top 25 all time. He'd be toward the bottom of my top 25. So I mean I guess if if what I'm saying then you're right. A 10 slot difference. That's what I'm saying. Maybe It is not the biggest difference. That's what I'm saying. Game ain't 56. Yeah. No it's not. It's not that far. Yeah. See I think 10 slots is enough. Jadas just The Ed slots too. Huh? They're weighted slots too. Like the NFL draft or something like.


Yeah. Yo I think, I think there's a lot of people that could be in the thirties there's a lot, not a lot of people that could be in twenties and tens. And I think once You Right, interesting point. Once you itemize the criteria that you're picking the list from that matters. So if you go into is' criteria to say yo, the albums that you put out over the tenure of your career game moves up that list. Yeah, sure. I don't like albums. We soul Not if you watch Not Soul. Not Soul. Not if you watch the J verses when we start talking Greatest of all Time you watch the Jadas verses you don't think nothing about the A game. And that's, that's the thing with the, that's an interesting point using the album as a higher weight in the, in the discography. I know but look, let me finish my thought.


When you hold the album in a higher regard than singles or verses, it's not realistic because if you're doing a show or you're doing a battle, all that album shit don't really matter. If I got 20 absolute fucking bangers. Yeah. Parts Game came in, wait, hold on, game came in, didn't have no crew So he had to adopt a crew and then we got solo game and whatever g and shit came. When we are kids we gonna make it ain't a lock song. Fucking Niggas done Started something ain't a lock song. When he start just popping up on, on all of these different artists Joint Benjamin's ain't a lock song. Like it's classic records that he was able to hop on because of his affiliations that they stand the test of time.


We gonna make it as a Kiss song. Okay. It ain't lock song. I'm just saying taking the locks out of it. He popped up in enough places to where I'm, I'm all of these verses count I did real songs were big. No no made up shit down. That Holds some weight. Yeah that holds weight. I'm not, I'm not disagreeing, I'm just saying that I think it's just, and Game don't have a, when you take 50 cent out the picture, and I'm saying this with respect game, please leave me alone please. I don't want no trouble. But when you take 50 out the picture, gimme the classic game moments. Songs Or Moments or moments. I as a personal favorite. Would he Beat dude up?


Me personally. Oh you mean music? Oh yeah, I'm with Bark By the Bushes. Whoop do that and narrate it and Recorded Musical moments I think. I think like kisses on Usher Throwback. Yeah. That that's, that's when You l said you ain't got joints for the girls. We now had a whole nap pot. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Maria honey. Yeah that was crazy. That whole that was outside of the documentary. What are the classic game music moments? It's his albums. It is disrespectful. So they are not, It is his albums. I'm saying. But even those in that regard, even albums we talking about The Red album I love. I think it's a phenomenal album. Ain't nobody talking about that album.


True. But but what's this other one? Documentary two. Love that album. I think Game makes better albums than a lot of people. But ain't nobody talking about these albums. And I think a lot of that, that could come Off disrespectful It one game. No, I don't want no Smoke. But look, I don't want No Smoke, Joe. What you're saying could come off that way. What? All you niggas could come off that way and that could be true because of where we are. You saying aint nobody talking about them albums. That's true out there. They could be talking about them albums and we just don't know. We don't know because we not there now asked them out there. I didn't mean to say nobody's talking about it. 'cause I'll play one of 'em shit. I play them shit. I play shit regularly. I'm saying what are the classic moments? And if they know what out there, then they'll text me and tell me that's possible.


Same way them niggas text me to tell me Joey Badass won, but they won't publicly say it. And West Coast niggas ain't dumb. There's logical Killer Nigga though bad. Like they'll talk to you before they kill you. They'll you Yeah, You right. Anyway, not to be circular. I'm now I'm done with music. I'm absolutely done with music. I'm sorry. Yeah, I've been saying that I'm, there is no more music for me. Done. We need a little more music. Joe. I I haven't heard another one Bites of Dust today. Who Joe knows who Bit the dust. I was talking with Ian Schwartzman at six in the morning about this very, this very topic right here.


Mark Marin is ending. Who's that now? His, his podcast One of the more, you don't know Mark Marin? I don know Mark. No. Okay. He's a big name for people in the podcast. Anybody here podcasting business? No. Y'all know Mark. What's the name of his show? WTF It. It is, It is big among podcasters. Six, six and a half million. Fuck you up Mark. Fuck you up. Yo. I know Mark. Man, I never watched this podcast. We're In the business. Never heard you got it. Big six, six and a half million listeners. So it's a, It is a pretty big one. And one of The Wrongest running, oh shit. He's from Jersey City. I see where I see 16 Years.


Yeah, It is, It is a beast. One man is a comedian and like writer. I'm, I'm aware of his comedian career. I just didn't, I never watched his podcast. Oh, so you know who he's, I know Who he is now that allowed to look at his picture. Spec Mark. But he is from Georgia City. Okay. Nobody's perfect. Nobody's perfect. But yeah. Joe, does it seem like, it seems like you got a lot of music smoke for the Black podcast to go down, but, but the white man pop up with his No, that is the absolutely disgusting. And now you ain't got no music. Oh that's, that's the white man now. That's right Now. Oh yeah. It's og. Oh no. Yeah. No, my mom is on a cruise so I gotta make sure she's not drowning. Oh wait, hold up.


'cause she know if somebody know it's Tuesday, It is her mark. That was really disgusting, ma. Hello? Oh, she probably do. I don't even have no bubbles, so that alright. You're such a dick. Stop it. Yo. Sometimes when people butt down, when people butt down me, I still listen to make sure they're not being murdered. No, no. I'll listen. Or they might be on to some other shit. They would be fucking Yo Mark Marion. I didn't feel like I should play another one. Bites the Dust for, because he's a, a legend and an innovator and I don't think he got ended.


I think this is him choosing his like quest. Like Quest love. He said, we're burnt out. This is his, this Is his quote. We have put up a new show every Monday and Thursday for almost 16 years. And we're tired, we're burnt out and we are utter, utterly satisfied with the work we've done. So Quest love, who's a legend and an innovator who ended his show, we played the music for Do we retract it? Not as long running. No, no. But your premise was if you're a legend and an innovator and you didn't, you ended it on your own terms. Innovator long running. Oh, I mean, I know you got the scholar so you sick boss. If innovator means something different. No, no, no. Just sound like we sick. Could we we matter boss, we tap dancing.


You know what, you know what's up. John took it. He man, get the fuck outta here. There we go. I mean, we, you, yeah. Yo, just to show you the power of peer pressure, right? What if I had a gig lined up with markers or a check coming soon, now I gotta play this song. Said Look what talking about get the cork out nigga. It's fine. Don't you feel better now? No. Little bit. This hurts. This hurts a little bit. But you're right. If we played it for Quest Love Yeah. Sorry, mark, Then Mark May can get it too.


Yeah. And I mean I didn't listen to the five, but it's Mark Marin. I love Mark Marin. I absolutely love Mark Marin, but can't change the rules up. 'cause you know, accountability system, That's kind of another gotcha moment I guess, too. You know what I mean? We love those up here. For, for me it's like we love those up here at the Joe Button podcast. I I I like doing another one. Bites to Death with people above us or on our, on our same level. Not people below us. I, I'm down. I'm Oh, that's when I Love it. I I got, that's my favorite time to do it.


Punch it down. Yeah. It is so much easier. I don know. It just means more people gotta chill though now Colin coward to hand out these checks. Yeah. Yeah. You better shut your fucking ass up. There you go. Witty. Right? Anyway, What else is going on? What else is happening now? This shout to Mark Mart. Yeah. Yeah. I have have a real uncomfortable homophobic story in my phone, but I don't know if we should get to that here. 'cause it's been good vibes. I mean, home is pride month. It is Pride month. Yeah, it's true. I don't know if this is, this is like kind of of goes against it, but at the same time it's just probably important to, because Pride Month we're celebrating L-G-B-T-Q-I-A And, but I think it's important to highlight Yeah.


Bad shit that happens to let people know that it's still not, it's not Okay, great. For everybody. Fair. And then that's our way of celebrating. You know what I mean? Fair. Take it away, Joe. Well, this story was so disturbing. This story was absolutely, let's see here. Do, do do do do, do. Look at my cohost helping me out. Do, do, do, Do. Okay. So I want read this. This is from Tristan, the surviving husband of Jonathan Jaws, who played John Redcorn on King of the Hill. Okay. And he was murdered. So I'm gonna read this because this is how I first learned of it.


This says my husband Jonathan Jos and I were involved in a shooting while checking the mail, while checking the mail at the site of our former home. That home was burnt down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done throughout that time. We were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic. When we returned to the site to check our mail, we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in Clearview.


This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw. While we were doing this, a man approached us. He started yelling violent, homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired. Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired, Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life. Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our life, in our time together than most people ever get.


We were newlyweds. We picked Valentine's Day. We were in process of looking for a trailer and planning our future. He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other. I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved to everyone who supported him. His fans, his friends know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family. My focus now is on protecting Jonathan's legacy and honoring the life we built together. If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice or being ignored by authorities, then you never truly cared about my husband.


Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built. Wow. Signed Tristan Kern de Gonzalez. Jesus, whatever your sexual preference is. I don't know how you cannot feel that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's there's nothing to say. It is disgusting. Some wild shit. And it's a reminder that this stuff still happens. Where, where, where was this Texas, I believe I'm looking this Yeah. San in the San Antonio area. Wow. Could you imagine that? No, no, no. I can't. I can't imagine that somebody killing my dog. Yeah. Just a, a dog skull in the leash in your mailbox. That's a sick person. And then killing my husband as we're grieving.


'cause we found our dog skull in the mailbox. Right. So somebody did that. Somebody that don't know us and just squatted and waited for y'all to come discover. Yeah, exactly. Right. That's a level of sick that I, I can't even comprehend. Did they catch that person? Did, did they make any arrests? They did. I just read this this morning. I don't know. They did somebody. Yeah, they did. Thank God I think they arrested. But they said that it wasn't a hate crime. Yeah. What? That's bullshit. It's still first degree murder. Yeah. If you put hate put the dog in there, you waited for the motherfuckers to come do that. You plot and planned that. And I think they burned the house down. I'm not positive, but That's what they said. It is. It was insinuated in that, in that letter. So the suspected shooter, his name is Sigfrido Alvarez.


Seha, I believe. Forgive Pronunciation, I'm mispronouncing it. But yeah, that's him. They got a mugshot of him and up and whatnot. You grime out. That's fucking horrible. Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. That's, and that statement is just, it's heartbreaking. I Got it. No, It is. And it's just like he just said like, we're newlywed. So it's like you think that you're gonna spend the rest, like how it takes so long to find your person. You find your person and then not only do they die, they're murdered in front of you and literally all you can do is say goodbye. Well no, they push me out. They push You say they push And in the course of that they Say while we're grieving our I don Christ for nothing.


Yeah. We didn't do nothing. I ain't do nothing no more. Yeah. You mourning your dog. Now you're about to mourn your new your hu And they did what anybody would do. Oh, this neighborhood ain't it for us. We're out. Exactly. Went somewhere. It was his family's house. They built it like his dad built the house for his family or some shit. So like, It is generational that they were in this neighborhood And motherfuckers just forced you out. Right. That's crazy. Mm. And that's one of the reasons, there's certain places I just could never move or Yeah. I just could never move for a tax break. Y'all got lack of humanity like that. You don't even know me and you just smoke. You smoking me at the mailbox, nigga, the bigger issue.


He said, why did he show up with the gun? No, no, no. The threats that they got, they reported to law enforcement there multiple times and nothing was done about it. So it's like everybody's just, Oh yeah, It is what we do out here. Go ahead. That's what they do out there. Yeah. And I know money, I know money doesn't bring people back, but I hope a huge civil suit comes on that department. Everybody who ignored everybody. The the complaints, the, the, the reports, all of that stuff. Man. That whole police department is guilty in that person's death. It won't, whoever else didn't listen, it won't. I know. Ain't nothing. I ain't saying it's gonna happen, but I, I hope it does. That's the problem. That whole system gonna happen. Yeah. Something needs to happen. And it should be a federal investigation too. This is crazy. I agree. This is awful. And that should be a hate crime. It is. Yeah. It should.


Yeah. I'm not necessarily rocking with the, we didn't find a hate crime. Yeah. I that's the textbook definition of a hate crime to me. I don't give fuck about what they charged em with as long as the motherfucker get convicted for The Wrongest amount of time possible. You know what I'm saying? Because the first degree murder might carry more weight than the hate crime. I don't know. I think we need some when hate crime gets added onto the Oh yeah. So that'll just be another additional charge. Gotcha. Like you get 30 if it's this 40, if it's, I don't always love the hate crime thing, but this is is blatant this. Yeah. Yeah. It, it makes, Oh yeah. I got you guys easy to just live in your own world and be ignorant to the things other people are faced with.


You know what I mean? You Do some sucker shit like that during fucking pride month to send some type of sick message. I don any month. I don't any month that that shit. I don what month for this dog? That shit don't, that shit just shit Don't matter. Know I agree with you way you didn't do it last month and you didn't do it the month before. You don't know how it leads people to believe you. How often. You don't know how long that motherfucking skull been in the mailbox or how often they check the mail. Yeah. You right, You right. Rest in peace to that man. Man.


Let's keep this rolling. I got more bad news For you. Yeah. More bad news for more RV for you. For me. For Knick's fans. I consider myself one as well. It is making me happy. Tips. Tips is, Wait, hold up. Not yet. Nope. You being sent Sentel Loop it. Loop it. It's from, It is on the ESPN app. I saying a tweet Hold up, Bark up you. Yes. This is on the esp n app. Told y'all he gonna greet that motherfucker bark's man thirsty to tell us to relax.


We gonna get to you. We'll get to whatever you say What is happening Man. Be excited. I'm excited. You know I'm playing the bounce version. How about so you that New Orleans bounce you, you know I'm playing the New Orleans bounce version of Outstanding now, I'm not gonna lie. I was at a cookout Memorial Day weekend and they played outstanding and s like, man, it's kind of fucked up. This song makes me think of someone died now. I was like, damn, I didn't really think about that. Listen, what are you telling me right now about the Knicks Tips is out man Fired.


You're being Sentel. I'm not being sentel. Is that Really true? That can't be true. No, this is real dog. This is from the ES ESP N app. CBS sports everywhere. They're reported. And he gone like I told you, he is gonna be gone. Man. Trash. I think that's a bad decision. It's horrible. You saying? You saying that fan? You're trying to be funny. No, I'm not even funny. I told you, I think, I think the players is from Mike Malone. I'm telling you. Is it New Yorker as story? Let's go. Yeah, I think that's, I don Tom Tim Timbo is absolutely crazy to It is. It is. I've seen worse. There's something that we don't know then. I Don't think so. No. I think it's just something that bad organizations do. As a Dolphins fan and Knicks fan. I can speak to Nobody had the Knicks go into the conference final.


Nobody. Yeah. But you know how that goes once you go Wait. And not only that, no, nobody had beaten Indiana more than once the whole season. And they played pretty good. Everybody last, they end up in The playoffs. Well, nobody beat Indiana more than one time. They Yeah, dog. The Bucks had one, the Cavs had one. I don't think the Cavs beat them. No, the Cavs, the Cavs beat them. The one game three. Oh, I was talking about during the Oh yeah, gotcha. Talking about playoffs. Gotcha. Gotcha. This is crazy. Nuts to me. Nuts. That's Jalen Brunson's godfather damn near. And dog. Even when you start talking about Indiana beating them, those games weren't blowout games.


The Knicks were in one. One Was, yeah, No one of them. The Knicks were in most of those games that they lost. Yeah, they Were. There's there's a, there's a couple things I've heard. Two from a beat writer and one just from the scuttle, but, but two that I can rely on. And that is that there was some concern about Tibs long term wearing out the locker room, which is the, what they always say when they get rid of coaches. Right. That, that he's losing the locker room. I think there's credence to that. It is just too early. And I think he's an old school coach and these new school players don't necessarily adhere to what goes On. That's another one that we hear. But He's a, it's another one that's popular now. Nah, he's a defense first coach. But there's something very specific. He's real hard noses bro. He's not. And it's also the rotations. People feel like he's too hard on the stars. Too many minutes on the stars.


And he had the same problem in Chicago, had the same problem. I mean, everywhere he goes, that's something that trails him. He, he's plays, he plays guys 42 minutes ship late 35. And then when you get in the playoff time, one they're worn out. And two, it makes it rotations very stellar. Everything that y'all are saying is absolutely true. I just have a hard time treating somebody like that. But It is business. I guess that The headline from CBS sports says Tom Thibodaux resurrected the Knicks, but firing him might be the only way to get to the next level. I think I disagree with that. It might be a Raptor situation. Remember Dwayne Casey goes, Nick nurse comes next year. They win the championship. I didn't agree with that. Dwayne Casey was coaching the year, that year was coaching the year. David Blatt You end up with, with Tyrone Luke Cavs win the championship. I you say Jackson, Steve Kerr. I, it happens.


I think that these, the, again, as a Dolphins fan, I see this saying they're trying to fire Mike Ano, the fans in the press are trying to fire Mike Tano. I think it's stupid like this guys are delivering winning seasons for the first time in 20 years. Y'all ain't been shit just because they didnt do Exactly What you wanted. I don't even feel like the Knicks should have the cache to move like that right now. I don but now's the time. You gotta, you got, you got who they perceive to be a better coach on the market. And I do believe he's gonna be the next coach. And you gotta do it now if you wait till next year, I would love Mike Malone. Yeah. I just don't like firing Tom Thibodaux who came here. Why would you love Mike Malone? Oh, I like that Mike Malone's a coach. New Yorker. Lemme ask you a question. I like Mike Malone's, coach Aer I if you knew, if Mike Malone, if Mike Malone were the coach, you'd still be playing basketball right now.


Would you feel differently about firing Thibodaux? Say that again. If you knew that if they had Mike Malone instead of Tom Thibodaux, the Knicks would still be playing basketball right now. Would you feel differently about firing him? Would you be able to get over it more? Yes. Huh. I think that that's not an unc. I don't think that that, I don't think you guys win this series no matter who's coaching this. But in general, I think there's a people in the next Nick Brass who believe well See that, that that part. See I just, I think that's, that's what they said. But fuck what they say could win this series. The Knicks should have, I'm just trying to picture this from the Knick's Brass. Yeah. The Knicks should have won game one. Like I said last pause facts, you lose game two then you'll go back, you'll win game three, you'll lose game four, you'll go back home. You win game five, you lose game six.


The thinking is you come back home and win it in seven. Right. It, the cards didn't fall that way. I'm not so mad. 'cause we beat Boston like that. Boston laid Exactly. Boston laid the egg. Exactly. They laid the egg. Get home for two games. It's the playoffs. The lights of bright. Yes. Shit happens. Yo. Yeah, I agree. But to fire a coach that, that that, yeah, I'm against that. I'm yo fam I'm against. I'm not, I'm I'm gonna say this right, I'm not And I said Boston's coach, I would've fired quicker than I would've fired Tom Thito. Mike No. Let, yes. Mike Malone can make Kat play defense. No. Hold on. Let finish, lemme finish. Lemme finish. Go ahead. The things that Boston or Jalen suffered were coachable things.


The shit that the Nick suffered, some of those were player mistakes down the stretch that Tom Thibodaux did. Had nothing to do with nothing about it. Right. Yo, the boss, the Boston shit fam, y'all up 20. Y'all up 20 game one, your team starts jacking threes. Okay, cool. You lose game two comes. But that's on coaching. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm agreeing with you. Even the fact that when they push in the of they come back, y'all don't call a time. I'm gonna, you you supposed to say, Hey, if y'all gonna let 'em score, then let 'em score twos. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen. Cool. Let's say the coach, we going, we gonna forgive you for that one. The very next game y'all up 20 and a third again, guess what?


You do mental breakdown and you let your team start shooting nothing but threes again, they going a 23 to two run. You don't even fucking call a timeout, bro. You just saw this in game one. You gonna let deja vu happen in game two. That's bad coaching and bad point guard. I agree. All that in my opinion. So the shit that Tom Thibodaux and them just experienced, that shit wasn't all about coaching. Some of that shit was was fatigue. That's where the coaching part could come in. Yeah. But a lot of that shit was bad shot selection by the team. Mm. Jason Brun bad decision making. Brunson is a vacuum. Some of them niggas have better ma matchups that he wasn't getting them the ball like Yo Kat. But that, but that's the other coaching part. No, but but that's the other, that's the other thing I was hearing I didn't get to is that there are a lot of people feel like Brunson plays that way because his dad's on a coaching staff and his dad has kind of been assigned Jalen Brunson duty and that he needs to be separated from his father.


And you can't, and that's why, another reason why they wanna get rid of that coaching staff. That's just what I've heard. There's the coach has to go before we give rid of our $50 million player, which to me is Kat. So I guess I do understand it from that thinking. One, something's gotta give two this move just tells you that they, they felt that Indiana, they felt about Indiana like US fans felt about Indiana. Yeah. Like y'all couldn't be, they can't beat y. There's no excuse for y'all to lose to the Indiana faces. And I disagree. Yeah, but this not, no, but there's some credence to that. You should not. There's a large group of people that felt like you could see him getting out coached by Carlisle Carlisle's a really good coach. Carl's a top coach top that has nothing to do with the fact that Mikel Bridges told you halfway through the season and he's our iron man.


He is our Cal Ripkin Jr. The league basketball. I'm not talking about the Knicks. He hasn't Mr. Since middle school. Yeah. He said, Hey, don't you think we playing a lot of minutes. That was your sign to incorporate some of these niggas that you may have needed later, which is a sham at, which is a Delon Wright even campaign. Like see how these people operate in different lineups. He didn't do that. And now in real time you're trying to figure it out in play off. So I see why they mad. I just didn't think it was such a fireball offense. Yeah. From where he took us from. I don't, he took us from nothing. Yo, you want me to read the list of the point guards of the Knicks for the last 30 years? We've read 'em. Yeah, we've read him. But the prob the problem is tip doesn't change. He does it everywhere. And there are people who just feel like it's not gonna get better and you don't have a lot of cap room to maneuver.


So you're not gonna get you, you, you likely won't get one additional player. It's gonna make you you so much better. And something's gotta give. And if the, if the players don't believe in you, you may, you may retreat. I'm just saying I understand why they would do it, especially me too. Especially when Mike Malone is on the team. I don, the only reason I kind of like the move, I'd hate this move, but I like it because it lets you know that the organization is somewhat serious about the window that they have to win. Yes. About winning. About winning. Right. But that's nasty. I don it better be low. I think that's, it's not, if it's not Mike Malone then then you drop the, they're fucked. Doc River comes in. That's what I'm hoping for. You just fucked me up with this shit. I would Love it. I think's It is a great day, isn't it? I think it's horrible.


I think, I think I, I'm good with it. Oh, I gotta get to the comment streets. I gotta get off this spot. I gotta, you know, sometimes when I'm home I just like to read comments on y'all. Fire Tim. Yeah. It's crazy to me. This article on CBS sports is really like well written. It said expectations are fluid in the NBA Tom Thibodaux took over the New York Knicks team in 2020 that had just spent two decades wandering through the desert at the time, achieving a baseline degree of competence was all the Knicks could ever ask out of a coach on God. Since he was hired for, for his first top job in 2011, he's the only person to win Coach of the year without earning a a top three seed. And so it says five years ago, that's how low the bar was in New York.


Getting the Knicks home court advantage in the first round series seemed borderline miraculous. Yo, the Knicks, Thank you ma'am. This is crazy. I don't think Mike Malone's the answer. Mike Malone's the best coach out available. I don't know. Yeah. He's about far the best coach available. The Knicks. The Knicks ended the season record wise as the fifth best team in the league. That just sound crazy. Insane. They in their playoff run as the third, the third best. It's not a large my nigga. Y'all are still, it's not a big discrepancy. Y'all didn't fall off. Y'all are still ascending. Like what the fuck. Come on. I understand why wasn't finished. I think, I think we up Mike Malone.


Y'all know, I, I love, I think the Joker and I think a lot of them people over there in Denver, I think a lot of times coaches could get maximize their players. Right. And then I think sometimes your players are just so good that they make the coach look good. Right. We saw that in Golden State when Steve Kerr got hurt. Fucking Luke Walton came in and went nuts. Yeah. And got a fucking LA Lakers coaching job off of the Golden State Fucking offense. Yeah. Offense. So I don't think, and we saw Phil Jackson at the, at the Knicks like yo dog. So I think this, I think that, I think that what Tom Thito did. Yeah. You can learn from that. Let's have a stern conversation with him. I also think that we are exaggerating how deep some of these NBA teams go.


A lot of coaches only play eight niggas. Yo, most of the NBA team coaches, but not a regular season bro. Well that's not true. I want us to move off from this. But my fear is that Mike Malone does have a little bit of that Tom Thito juice on him. I mean, he's accused. He just got kicked outta his locker room. He's accused of losing his locker room three days before the season was over voice. The Nick Starters led the league by far in starters minutes played second place. Denver. You guessed it, Denver. So I don't know that your problems are just solved by bringing in Mike Malone unless Mike Malone's open to to, to changing that. And I don't know if he is or he is not. And know Tom Thito consistently has not been on every team he's ever coached.


I don't even like how they did that. Why not keep him on as some type of consultant? He's family to y hold on. But that's this interesting, the the read that I got from Shams and from ES ESPN did not say he was fired. Say he was relieved of his duties as coach that often lang that language is often used when they are gonna make you a consultant or something else. Promote you the president or, yeah, because they said relieved of his duties as head coach. They were very specific. Yeah. I just have a hard time believing that the Knicks as an organization would treat tips like that. And somebody that been in the games all year. Like Leon Rose, worldwide, west Rick Brunson, Jalen Brunson and Tibs is a committee. Yeah. Like It is a squad. But if they saying that they had to separate Brunson. 'cause a lot of times when the head coach get fired, the staff gets fired almost always a lot of times.


So Yeah. Well they not getting rid of Rick Brunson says who, because you're not getting rid of Jalen Brunson, you stop. So I'm not doing this. I'm not doing You gotta show me that. No, I'm not saying that show they are. I'm just saying nigga Rick Brunson is contracted to be a coach and if Mike Malone gets hired or another coach get hired, a lot of times they bring their own assistant staff. They don't have to keep Now Jaylen says this is a a deal breaker for me. What he gonna do quit, do whatever other player do threaten to ask for a trade. Be unhappy. You don't want an unhappy player either already unhappy captain of your team, you something. He has the best contract in the NBA. He could change his. Oh true. He's a very player friendly his mind. No, he has the most player friendly guy. He could change his mind or team friendly, I should say. He has the most team friendly, I'm sorry, I meant say team friendly.


He has the most team friendly contract. What I'm saying is this, bro, you close us out. If y'all, if y'all gonna talk about winning and the team is committed to winning, then you can go get some motherfuckers for Jalen Brunson. No you can't really because it's contract. Because of the money. The money thing. Yo, gimme Greek free. There's nobody gimme such and such. Gimme such and such. I, I'll take 'em down in Philly on behalf of Philadelphia. We're willing to make a sacrifice. We'll give you Paul George. In fact, now I'm gonna steal. I'm not doing it you because I'm going through it right now. I'm my feelings and that's why I'm happy. Think that's hard. I'm in my feelings. I think it's hard Now I'm not mad at this. If tibs as a 70, however a year old says, you know what? I'm retired. I'm done. Nobody says that shit after being a stone stone from the NBA finals.


I guarantee you tips ain't want to be nowhere but right where he at. Yeah. Word that is absolutely. That's hard. Crazy that y'all did that. I'm going, I don't what else y'all got? You got any other breaking news? No, I think I, I think I'll do it. Shit. Fucking Broken news. Broken news. I Love it. Alright. It's sleeper time. It is sleeper time. So give me, oh wait, we didn't talk about division being unsigned and then signed. They were independent and then now they're on Soso Def. Now they're on Soso Def and Jermaine Dupree announced yo, after seeing the energy and seeing them on tour and working with 'em, once I found out they was unsigned, I had to sign him.


That's awesome. Jermaine Dupree. What the fans are saying is when the fuck were they on sign and why didn't they tell us? Right. We wish we would've known. I had no idea either. But congratulations to division. I absolutely love them. Sometimes when I'm home searching for entertainment, I do a few things. I go back to old history that makes me laugh or some current shit that's going on. There's a guy on Instagram right now, I forgot his name, but he's a basketball nigga. He's showing you all the loopholes in the travel rules in the NBA. So he's just out there taking 29,000 steps, hopping, gathering steps.


Shit, I hate them videos. I he, I hate him with a passion. But guess what? He makes me laugh when I'm feeling down. He makes me laugh when I'm feeling down. Another thing that gives me joy when I'm feeling down is remembering that we called Division to tell him about that stupid ass song that him and Jermaine Dupre made. He told me that that song was gonna be a classic and around for the next 50 years if I get called cheated. Dad don't me, I don't love you. And I know I cheated more than division and I was saying, hey, if something's wrong, if a nigga that cheated more than you is saying, Hey dog, I don't know if this the guy anthem that we needed to be so division.


Anytime you wanna talk about that. What else brings me joy? Oh, when Aisha Diaz talked about how she fell in love with her boyfriend when he kidnapped her and hit her passport. Y'all remember that one? We can move on. Yeah. They said I didn't even Know that story. That's wild. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That was the best. That was, that was one of the, you talking about the content. That's one of the best stories to ever hit the internet. Steven Victor said that push paid seven figures to get out of the def. That sounds like that's how much they owed three album. Well he owed three albums. That sounds, that's How much he stood on, on on business. Keeping that verse in there stood on Business. I respect that. Well my verse is worth more than seven figures. The Kendrick verse. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My Kendrick verse will be worth more than seven figures if I'm allowed to put it out properly.


Yeah, he's on fish grease now. I got this deal this way with Rock Nation where we probably got it split a certain way now they probably already hate Drake. We outta here. Yeah. Say something wrong. You pay that seven, you pay that seven figure tab quick. Depend on how high the seven figures are. Well he had it was able to get it. Seven figures is long range. We don't know that he had, we took nine as big different. That's what I said was able to get it. Steve Victor got enough Ferraris to fucking pa some of the off. Hey, one thing for sure if put didn't have it, him and Steven Victor was gonna have it. They go get it, push it. Steven Victor push is a fucking, I cough for push is our, our eras version of Vince Staples like that nigga's parading around out here like a underground mc.


But he ain't, he ain't, he not going to. He don't act under. Yeah, you don't write the McDonald's theme underground and see and Arby's, right. Yep. And Arby's, I am going with Gion. Who to me is doing, I know we all enjoyed some of that music. That Silk Sonic did. It sound like Gion is doing that. Okay. Like it sound like he and his make my shit sound like the seventies bag.

You could speak for yourself Sometimes she up speak up. I didn Just don't whisper. Speak up. Don't let Mon Long speak for you. It went from you just hilarious. Speak to you Sam. Have a voice. Shut the fuck up. Why don't you? I was anyways. Nah, I'm it's not. Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan. I kind of like it. I think he's body in this. I'm gonna play a Gion record.

Mood. I can, I wonder if they would've fired him if he lost to the Celtics.


No, no, no, no Because This to me sounds like they just wanted to fire him or yo we we like everybody else in the world underestimated Indiana and knew this was a shoe win and I think that Indiana just outplayed the Knicks and had a deeper team than the Knicks. I think if y'all lose the ball then nobody says a thing. I agree with you. The problem is just that it don't seem like the Knicks felt that way. If y'all losing seven games to Boston, nobody says a fucking thing. They congratulate him. In fact, yo brand new music, it's my man Trey songs. Not to be confused with Trey button. Even though I did and kept calling Trey songs, talking to him like he was my son. Brand new music.
