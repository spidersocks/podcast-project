Some sexy songs for you, for you Party Next door featuring Drake. I felt like He Wasn a little bit more of a Drake. Yeah. A little more featuring Party next door. But yeah, 21 songs. I'm just talking about the way they labeled it. Yeah, sure. You know? Sure. Circumvent certain shit. Think He Wasn a Drake album. He Wasn a Drake. He Wasn a Drake album. Tried to get around Universal. That's it. That's what He Wasn He did. It did. And he did. Yeah it did 21 songs. Yeah, 21 songs. So let's, let's get it like 15 of them. You said you like 15.


I said I heard like 15, 16 of them. I listen to the whole thing. First off, I couldn't find this shit. Yeah, He Wasn like extremely hard to find. Like when it dropped Stroke of Midnight, I'm in the stores. Don't say stroke. Stroke of midnight that you talk about Midnight. Midnight. A good time to stroke. Yeah. Oh, Don't buy a album at the stroke of the midnight stroke. Sexy songs. That might be the album. Buy guess. Talking about A stroke of He Wasn right there for me. But, But yeah, He Wasn just hard to find. He Wasn really hard to find. And people was complaining and saying that they couldn't find it. Huh? You bought it before you laid down? I was seated when I purchased it. Weirdo, He Wasn sitting On it at my desk.


Hey, yo. Get the fuck outta here. Are you good sir? Get the fuck outta at my desk. At my desk at the stroke of midnight. Yeah. I, I went to bed. I went to bed like an adult, like the old nigga. I am watching Very scary people on Max. Okay. Good show. Okay. I started A Paradise. A Great show. We'll get very scary. Yeah. I would've never watched that by the name, but that is a great Yeah, it's dope show. Went to bed, woke up around four. The album was right there, right at the top. First album on iTunes. Copped it and walked to the kitchen. Huh? Left, left of sleep in there.


You know what I mean? Took a little walk, see what it's getting. It's cool. I thought He Wasn cool. I think if you're a Drake fan, you're probably really happy to hear this. And It is good to see the moment. Right? It is good to see the fans just have something to for sure cheer for and have their time. I think if you're a party fan, you might be disappointed. He, I, I feel like he was underrepresented on the album being that He Wasn built as a party album. That, that being said, I'm not, I I like Drake more than Party. So I wasn't really mad at it. And most people do. And that being Said, this genre Drake, Drake is a bunch of different genres. This is not my favorite of the Drake genres, the slow r and b spacey shit.


But I think it's solid. I think it's solid. Yeah. I thought He Wasn cool. I like the album. I like the album, but I see some people are complaining about it and I wanted to hear from the people that actually listen to the music or listen to Drake to see why people may not like it. 'cause I like the album. I think that the album is dope people Oh, go ahead. I mean, music is subjective. Yeah. Like, so you could like some shit that ice not like, and Parks might be in the middle one. I think sometimes we be listening to the other motherfuckers to tell us what to like, but then if we are waiting for Drake and Drake comes into me that he, you know, he delivered. And then I hear people that I look for look to for music saying, well, I don't really like it. I wanna know why. Like, what's the reason? What are we looking for? What are you guys looking for in music?


You know, when you say sometimes it could just be expectation, like, like people could have expected, even though they, they build this album as sexy songs. It's, it's, It is songs for the women. It is that. So you kind of could go into it ex you, you, you kind of know what you going get. Got it. There's people that's like, I know Drake gonna give us one where he just going bar crazy on it. Oh, he didn't do this. Oh, he didn't do that. So he he gave us A bar record. No, he did. I'm just, but I'm talking about damn near timestamp. Yeah. Record because Okay. People expecting he has say Montage Drake. Yeah. Gotcha. But this ain't that. So, so a lot of times when people don't like something it's because they set their own expectations and it didn't meet.


Right. Or they just got an outright bias or that Yeah. It sounds like or Drake and Party have produced way outer music than this. Mm. So back to your expectation point, right. Drake A full, a full body of work? No, no, no. Never a full body of work. Gotcha. But just in, in every feature on both sides. Right On party side. Fucking from, if you're reading this, like the people that are fans of both of them, when they get together it's like, alright, so maybe this didn't meet that mark for party fans, Drake fans. I see. Ecstatic. Yeah. Yeah. And rightfully so. Like I, I'm happy for them, them like, I'm not a Drake fan, but I'm happy just to see I like that.


It, it looks like he's putting that shit behind them. And It is just going now, now I'm just, I'm, I'm off that this is where we are. I'm giving y'all music. The the warm weather coming, this is what I'm on and the fans is eating it up. I Kind of feel like this album could have came earlier historically, Earlier time. Like in years like Yeah years. This could have came like years Ago. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You Know what I mean? I think it would've been a better move then. But It sound like old Drake. I do like him getting just back to doing Drake shit and leaving all the battle shit and all the other internet shit alone. Even though he is still doing it. But I about to say that's what y'all got from that For the most part. I got y'all, I'm back in the booth. I'm gonna put out a music project, but I'm on y'all niggas ass in the summer. Yeah, I like that. That's, that's what I got from it.


I'm, I'm, I can't wait to see what's next. Yeah, that's what he's talking. Yeah. This summer we'll be back. Well I'll be back man. I ain't forget nobody. I like how you said they not like us on one of the records. He did. I thought that was funny. Yeah, I thought that was funny. Do y'all have standout tracks that y'all fuck with more than others? Like no, I'll be remembering their names. I like the Alyssa Ford joint. You more hugs. Gimme a hug Number 10.

He didn't respond to me. Drake is making music. I'm the last nigga on Drake's list. It's a coincidence that he said that. Well what do you think of his explanation for never wanting to be married? I Think that or settle down. What? Man don't really want him. Let me take that back. Yeah. I think Drake would like to be married.


My personal opinion. So you forcing marriage on a nigga? I'm not forcing. He just told you what he, how he felt to your question. He asked.

I was like eh, I don't know. But in the car today that shit Was Shit. Who's calling that shit? That shit gonna sound all outside too. Shit. I can see how, who's calling, I can see how this would be potentially. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. O your sound. 2025.


77. 77 commercials. This is definitely gonna be a A TikTok. TikTok. Oh yeah. You know what this is for? It made me think of like roller skating. I thought he was trying to follow the line of the metro and future type way. You know they was doing all that funny ass sounds that they were doing playing around. Okay. I didn't even think of that. Yeah, that's why, that's what I thought it, it gave me that feel at the time. You know what I was thinking? I mean you went Metro Future. I was thinking of Kanye T Song. Ah, got it. What you think Joe? You like? No, not at all. I absolutely hate it.


He put that bass song. I absolutely hate this song. I mean no qu no doubt. I thought he was going on to make Joe Hayden run between Now see this one, This is horrible me man. I almost threw The laptop. This this one is horrible For me. This Meet Your Padre into Nokia back to back is almost as egregious as what did HOV do on Kingdom Come? What did he do? He Wasn that usher song into that Beyonce Song. Hollywood. Oh my God. Sorry ho. Anybody? I love you Ho. And then Hollywood and I forgot the other one. Dog. This Is horrible. Can I meet you by today? Yes. Friends. Pasta.


Yo. This Bad. That's the shit with a guitar. I think that nigga chasing some spank. That's what I'm saying. That he chasing money. Yeah, but dude, he trying to hit every base. No it's not. It is not. But guess what happens, $38. They in here spinning Nike Tight. No, no, no, no. Nothing. Nothing. Combo. They got the Nike Titan, the $38 on. They might, I kinda like this one too. It is a little bit more poppy too. I kinda Like that, bro. He, he kind of hit on a bunch of different bases. This one's super poppy. It feels like a nineties offspring or some shit like This.


The one he tried to call Scissor for, but he forgot. He definitely went to Texas. This shit came back. Green S like, oh. Oh, come on. Yeah. I, I like the first half of the project I think is cool. It's records on here that I like. I'm not gonna say I ain't even finish the first half. Like the feel like the first 11 records. No, like 10 records. I like the vibe of the first half Got. I understand people out there saying that it might get repetitive a little bit. Got you.


That's your bag though. This is, this is your like chop. It is sometimes it's not wrong with if I, if I like this vibe, I like this sound. All right. Keep doing it. Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that Shit is working. And again, good to See that them have that moment out there of, you know, it been, been a, it's been rough. It's been Rough. It's been rough. 12 Books. True. This feels like a reset or Like at least he back to making music again. Yeah, yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And, and taking some chances or being creative. He in his little creative process I guess. And this is all, this is all trickery. You know, he try, he trying to figure out, You know what I mean, get, get through what he got going on. You know what I'm saying? With the whole UMG situation and I mean we can read through it and we see it, but it's clever.


Let's see where it goes. I like the project and I'm looking forward to more reception on it. On one of the joints. Didn't he say Lucia hit me and told me to piece it up? Oh, he might have. I don't know. I haven't done Lyric Deep Dive. I think he said that on one of the shit. What do we, what do we think this album does per week? Mm. Two 50 to three 50 Mm I'm with that box. I'm with you. I'm with that. Mm. It's a big gap though. I'm, I'm, I'm going lower. Yeah, pause. Low low. How much lower? Let's hear it. One 20. Really? Nah, you tripping.


I'm just, that's that's my number. What you think If if it come back one 20 something is is very, very wrong. Very wrong. It is very, very, very, very wrong and very wrong. And then they gonna say we can't account for the direct to consumer sales. If you come back at one 20, they're gonna say we sold 200 in direct to consumer. 'cause He Wasn a early, early link for that. Oh He Wasn. Okay. A couple days. Really? Some type of, yeah, that's I didn. See that Where you could find a digital footprint or some shit? Don't gimme the line outta here. I waited until it popped up in iTunes. But if you think, if you think they do one 20, what's wrong?


Like the, the fix is on or off. P four only did 37. I'm not grading this as Party A Party album. Well the Only reason why I'm is 'cause it's listed as a party album. Yeah, but UMG is under here. Yeah, but so Party when he drops it's under that Santa something Music. Yeah, Santa Ana And Drake. Well it's OVO under Santa Ana. OVO sound under exclusive license to Santa Ana. Label. That's party OVO and OVO under exclusive license to Republic Records. A division of UMG. And That's Drake? Yes. That's what it, It's, it's saying that It is party, but it's saying both of their deals.


Okay. I just can't see one 20. Yeah, it seems that would be frighteningly low in my opinion. And I think this is the way I think, I think Drake could sell one 20 of a CD full of farts. I believe he could, but I think also, So if this comes back as that something's off. I'm saying but expound on what, when you say something's off, what do you mean by that? They're buried it or It means It is just not going to be, it's not, it's the beginning of maybe, maybe independent Drake. If it comes back at one 20. Is this what independent Drake looks like? I'm gonna say no, but yeah. See I think this is the safety net.


Dropping it this way, if it does come back, if it, if It is not typical Drake numbers, they Can use it as an Excuse. Exactly. Got you. It's almost like we're preparing ourselves for it to come back a little lower. There's no single, there's no, there's been no nothing leading up to this. True. So now this drops, we know it's not gonna do typical Drake number, so let's make it party featuring Drake and drop it this way to cover ourselves so that now we are shielded against any type of backlash from Hey, why you didn't do this number, why you didn't do that number. Well it's because of that because Word gonna get around that. It ain't but so much party on here. And I think if that word get around, like I said, I think he could See that boy could sell a CD full of farts. So if I'm gonna agree with you, I I agree.


If, if that's not happening, then is this what It is this his version of Big Sean after he left wherever he left or Meek after he left wherever he left. Is this what it begins to look like? I I, I don't, I I still Say no, I still saying I'm, I'm saying no too. Which is why don't think at one 20 That matters bro. The fact that It is listed as party Drake, like that matters. I'm going To who? I'm going between 180 and and two 50. I think two 50 is fair. I think 2 50, 2 70 Okay. Is fair. Yeah, that's what I think. And we're Only talking like in the United States first, First week.


Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we just doing the first week number. Okay. Yeah. Us But Canada's the us So you legend first of the US Gulf of America. Yeah man. When The last time you been back to Canada? Like 79?

How often do you have to update your legend in the sixth card? I think that it's set in Stone. You don't set Talk about it. That's all. That's alu. I don dunno that's a AlleyOOP right there. That shit is cemented.

Where? Up here Of the Head. I do both. Yeah, I do the top of the head. Oh no, I do the forehead. Because bitches killed the, when when they killed the good morning text, they kind of killed the forehead kiss. Wait, Wait, wait, wait. How are the two tied in with each other? Because you, they were, they were very sweet, Endearing, Sentimental. No, the problem women were having with the good morning text is that He Wasn sent to like 20 other fucking shit group. He Wasn a group text, He Wasn a group text. That was the issue women had. We do not have issues with affection. But why y'all Were supposed to know that?


I'm, I'm sorry that y'all are fucked up at hiding your shit. Oh, I have a totally different look on that. But I, somebody could send in Group, group text and get caught. I know I'm a sicko. So a group text. Yes. I'm shutting up. I mean, not a group text. I know. I actually wanna hear your, your your, your sick mind. Sometimes It is very, very fucking entertaining. Please go. You were thought of, Oh, for Christ sake. I agree. Do it matter what order you were, you were thought of in my morning. There's a sea of women that were not so, and you might been first if you got the good morning text. We talking about the semi-finals. Hey yo, I'm not even gonna hold you. We good. It's some sick shit that you saying That that that shit that sound, my brain would've never, Yo, you said yo dog, you mad about the one girl.


I fuck. But you don't know about the 9,000 that I didn't fuck. Mm. And then my brain and I should be then my brain, I was like, yo, this Boy is a sicko. But I just never understood why. Yeah. That was some nuts. So shit. The good morning text. If it go out to five of y'all, we in the semifinals now. One of y'all. Hey, one of y'all. Hey, good attributes on ke on all Keisha ke Katrina. Yeah. And hold up and keep the playing field even How many good morning texts was y'all receiving? And I want to see how all of y'all respond to the good morning texts. That's not The point. Ah, I be, it's I bet it's not the point. Yeah, that's a good one, y'all. Yo, you a sicko.


There's only one person I wanted to get it from. Oh man. But what, what If it wasn't that nigga? Well, the wa want want, So why you mad about the group text fist? Fuck you nigga. So the one from him and then all the others can Just, and he and he sent it to you To y'all it to Keisha. Y'all Tisha Max. Yeah, exactly. Mel, you up to date with this Anthony Edwards story? I've seen the shit in the blogs. I read the text messages. Oh Boy. This is Anthony Edwards of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Aisha Lil baby's oldest baby moms thinks she's, I want to say 38. 38.


And Anthony Edwards is 23, 2 3. And she had a baby. Yes. I gathered that from the text messages and It's His and it looks like he wants nothing to do with it. Yeah, He didn't want nothing to do with baby. He told her didn't want nothing to do with it. I thought that this was deja vu 'cause of the last story that came out where he told the girl, just send me the pictures. Send the video. Yo, just send the video. The yo the video, yo one 50, whatever. Yo, send the video. So now Aisha has replied to the backlash that she received over the text messages being released because I guess a lot of people were on her head saying, well, you had a baby with a 23-year-old.


He told you that he wanted nothing to do with the baby and you went ahead and had it anyway. So good for you. Let me find her response. She says, and I quote, you have all become so numb, ungrateful, and disrespectful of the ability to reproduce and give life that abortion has become desensitized. You are so accustomed to seeing, hearing, and being raised by women who had to be, had to be the village after abandonment. That society has normalized cowardly behavior. Now the blame is placed on the woman on innocent babies while the man continue is continuously protected.


Hmm. Let me fix that. It's not your fault, sis. It's your body. Your choice and your voice still matters. Although you may have seen your mother, aunts or grandmothers handle this on their own. They were never supposed to and neither are you. To the men who have lacked and continue to lack male representation, influence, and accountability. Being a man doesn't start and stop with an erection. Being a father is not optional. After bypassing the preventative measures available to you beforehand, don't become what your fathers were to your mothers. Conceiving takes two in that moment.


Both male and female have choices that determine the outcome of tomorrow. It's everyone's responsibility to make choices they can live with. She goes on to say, I'm happy with mine. My daughter is a gift, yada yada y distinguished panel. She's right. She's absolutely right. She is. I mean, a lot of people can look at that, you know, before she says that and ask, why would you have a baby with a man who doesn't wanna have a baby with you. But that is not the question to be asked. I mean, It is a logical question, but that's not the question Exactly. Everything that she stated is what the point is, you know?


And also, if he's already found himself in this predicament more than once, then maybe he should be a little bit more responsible so that he doesn't wind up in this position every single time. You know, we talk a lot about how men like him are targets, but if you don't take the moving target off of your back with your own behavior, like you don't get to, you don't get to, you know, kind of like throw the relationship or sorry, responsibility off of your shoulders. It still is there. And I think that she's absolutely right. I think the question is always posed on the woman. The burden is always placed at her feet. Rather than asking the guy, why don't you just strap up?


Why don't you get a vasectomy? They're reversible. Why don't you do something to be a little proactive about winding up in situations like this that wind up being stressful and then spilled all over the blogs for us to know all your fucking personal business. It's, I don't agree with that. Yeah, I don't agree with a lot of that. Yeah. I don't agree with a lot of that. Oh yeah, you go first go you got first she said, or first of all, we didn't have to know none of this. We didn't. That's, that's for starters. You put this information out there, so yeah, people are gonna comment. That's one, two, I, he doesn't, not saying right or wrong, and y'all know how I feel about parenthood, but he can literally walk away and just pay for it.


He, he can be on the hook for whatever the state say he gotta pay. And he might be fine with that. It's why the, the question of why is it always the woman is because y'all the ones that have to actually carry the child. Y'all the ones that have to actually go through the birthing process. Men can have, he could have five other girls pregnant all at the exact same time. Right? Now, again, I'm not saying none of this is correct, I'm just saying It is easier for the, if, if he wants to be a piece of shit and walk away and not deal with it, he can do it. Now I think she's asking why is society okay with that and that that's a whole bigger, But, but that, but that's what I'm addressing is that she's, she's acknowledging the societal issue.


That's number one. And number two, there's a woman who would end up in this situation and be like, I am definitely not having your fucking child. I don't know you, you don't know me. That's gross. Whatever. But then there's other people who that offends everything about their sensibility, their sensibilities, their morals, et cetera. I won't. And so if she, they feel like life needs to be protected and regardless of how it happened, like there's people who have been, you know, sexually assaulted, understand who, who keep the baby Correct. Because of their views on abortion. Yes, I agree. So the fact of the matter is we don't know why she's, you know, she's making the choice and it's her choice to make. Absolutely. But we, she's also highlighting the fact that this is not, this, this is, this is extraordinarily common.


And the response is what's common. And the response is what needs to be the thought process around it needs to be reframed. See how different, hold lemme just, lemme just please one. Lemme finish. One second finish. And then, and then yeah, we saw this play out with him before publicly. So she now see that's so she saw that. I agree. So my thing is, why are you even fucking this dude that moves that way? That's why. But that's why people, both things need to be acknowledged and that's why people are coming at her. Okay. You notice is how he moves. We've seen it. You still fucked him, got pregnant and he did it again. He just had a documentary where he has a family and a girlfriend and all of these other things.


So he doesn't have any respect for his family and his girlfriend to stop sleeping with other women, unprotected His. So she didn't have respect for his family and her femininity. I don't, I I, here, here's what I gotta say about this. Excuse me. First and foremost, we, we are missing a point that he's 23, she's 38. Exactly. That's a huge point, huge point. We, we, we, we don't wanna acknowledge that sometimes when a woman reach a certain age, if she gets pregnant, she wants to keep the baby because she doesn't know if she's gonna get pregnant again. That's true. You know, that's the mind frame that they go through through. But we have to acknowledge that he's 23, she's 38, he has a pattern of this and she should know better. Meaning like, she should have made the decision to either not sleep with this young man or make sure he wraps it up.


What do you expect a 23-year-old who's just getting all this money to say, especially if he shows a pattern of not wanting children. I now you become complicit because you think in your mind I can change, either I can change him or I'm looking for a come up. And that's what a lot of people tend to think. That's that's what a lot of people, if we seen this story before with this same individual, it's not like you caught him out outta nowhere. We don't know it. We seen this pattern. And if you see a pattern and you become part of a pattern, you're complicit in the pattern. So, so to your point when you're saying that my thing and, and 'cause I agree with a lot of what the lady said, me too. Me telling me this, why is the onus on the man to be the person for protecting?


I think it should, the responsibility should fall on both parties. But that's what she said. That's what she's saying. She's saying the onus really, the, the, that's she's responding to the criticism, largely being placed at her feet and saying, you guys, nobody ever puts the onus on the Guy. And I said, I agree with You. Right. But when you started to speak you said, yo, the dudes are having unprotected sex. No, the parties are having unprotected sex. No, I know that. So, So in that, the same way she could say, yo, fuck you, you, you had a baby with me. Unprotected. He can say, not saying that it's right to Isis point, he could say, fuck you. Yeah, but I told you I ain't want to have a baby.


So I don't want nothing to do with it. And the only thing it does is leave another father in the child in the streets. Right. So she's really not speaking to the societal issues. Because when you laid down with that dude and decided to have unprotected sex with that dude, y'all both knew the potential consequences. But I think in her 38-year-old brain, she also knew that they were never gonna be a family and they never gonna be in a relationship. I don't know what So you are lending to the societal detriment of fatherless kids. I have no idea what she, what she was thinking when she was, when she got involved with him. I have no idea what he was thinking when he was getting involved with her. I really don't know. But by using her age against her, you know, she's this age and he's that age. We can look at who, which Jalen is it that's with Drea.


Ja, He, he seems to be very happy with her. He posts her all day long. Like they look like they're in a very involved relationship. So I don't think that the age factor really actually plays a role here. Because it's not just that he's 23, he has a girlfriend and he has a family. Right. So he's, he's mature enough to have created the family with the girl of his choice, but he's still outside screwing other women. Unprotected. Wait, who You talking about right now? Talking about, you talking about Anthony Edwards? I'm just going based off what he, what he just, what just said about having a family. I just want to correct. It doesn't take maturity to at all. Come in somebody Zero maturity. Trust me. I know, but Hold on. But if He Wasn the other way around, I was gonna say that we, we blame the men of I was gonna say that.


You know, would the woman have been enough mature at 20 years old, fresh deal, fresh outta college to be dealing with a 38-year-old man? We wouldn't look at it like she was mature enough to be making all these responsible decisions. The word grooming would start floating around. Yeah. Double. And once you factor in how they say that women mature faster than men and all of that. So she's ain't even 38, she's way older than that. And he and a mine. Yeah. Okay. It's even bigger gap up. I want to take the time to shout out the women out there that be like, listen, if I come to my man and say I'm pregnant, I want him to be just as ecstatic as I am Word.


And if I don't get that response, then it's a sign and I'm gonna go ahead and yeah, this ain't for me. Yeah. Yes. Those are the ones. Those are the ones. Fetus delete Jack Aren, magically delicious fetus. Delete, delete us. Did you just Sayign nigga said delete fetus delete us. Yes. I mean, oh, Those are the ones that walk straight past the niggas in front of the, the clinic. They walk straight nigga like they in the army. I gotta shout 'em out. Hey, hey was Written no love Up my face. Hey, She ain't have to say y'all.


She don't let, she don't let them stop us. No, but they try to hug her in the beginning. Bitch, if you don't get the fuck out my way, lemme get inside. Some girl tweeted yesterday, she was like, I'd have been, he'd have been calling me. I'd done already argued with white people out front. I'm inside way you meet me would beat me here. They applied pressure the white people. But we talk about the ones that get past them. Yeah, that's what she saying. Determined. They determined, they determined to go inside motherfucker. They determin to go inside. Motherfuckers like the jackal, they gonna get they bitch. I just feel like the double standard play a role in this show does. And that's the thing, like I can see, I totally understand and I think that the lady has a ton of valid points. She does. She does. She does. Right. So, but I also think that a lot of that blame is on her as well.


I think that it's a two, a two party thing. I don't think that it's just him being wrong or her being wrong. It's both of them. But when you put your shit out on front street to the public, people gonna jump. Then the criticism is going to be Yeah, that, that's my take on that. I do think it's both of 'em. Oh yeah. That, that's why I'm kind of just on mute and letting y'all have the conversation because, And I put a little more on her than I normally would. Not saying it's all her fault. Mm. Put a little bit more on her because A, you're older and more mature than you, you know, and B, we've seen this with him before. She has too. No, I'm saying when I say she got a baby, she got a baby with Lil baby, right? Yes. How old is Lil Baby thir 30 now? Something like that.


I don't know the status of none of that. No, I'm just saying No, but what I'm, I'm just saying and I'm just talking about what with Anthony Edwards though, if you seen how this person j it, it ain't, it wasn't five years ago he did this. This was last year. Anthony Edwards is a kid, bro. We gotta call her with a T Is because I thought she handled herself well in her text messages to him. But you're texting a 23-year-old dude that's 300 s up that You can see. You could tell Don't want kids look at his responses, Look at his responses. He's like kick rocks. So look, lemme ask. So look, he Laughing. She said maybe this, this could be a learning experience. He said I don't wanna learn. Like let me ask you this. So imagine You kind get, So imagine with their, their conversations with like over dinner. Ah, I'm with you. You get what I'm saying?


Like imagine what their conversations were like when they were in that quote unquote getting to know each other phase that Joe is, Joe is Which leads more to, I saw a lick. Oh my god I saw a lick. Not saying that's the case. It might not be, but it leads more to that than I was really building something here with this guy and I thought we were gonna be together. No, I got pregnant and now you're leaving me. It it don't, he it don't look like that. Yeah, but it's worded right. Like she had an encyclopedia. Gotta be careful about them girls. That chap. GBTV your oh no that that shit nice. I heard that chap GBT is the truth. It is the truth. Yeah. That's pretty great. You judging us, huh?


Are you judging us? No, Not no. Fuck. I've used Chad GBT for not To not, not for a response. I meant what We said meant other stuff. The other stuff. Come on you a legend. You come on. Yo. I ain't gonna lie. We be saying bullshit next time Canada. We don't a whole legend. Legend From Canada from the sixth. It is It is it bullshit. I mean the only time it becomes It is not bullshit. Right? Like we have to, Mel's the only lady here so women here. So we, we understand her sentiments and we respect it. We have our thoughts as well. We seen this play out before and when it be, when it's the other way around, we heard what people said about the men that look predatory, that that look like they're grooming the younger women, you know better.


You know she's young, you know she just come out, came outta college, she grooms, you know, you know that, you know she's not capable of being a responsible mother. Like I've heard so many excuses when it, when it's the other way around, I just want the same grace e to be extended to when it's, when it's this way as well. Yeah. I don't and I don't think it's a gender thing. I don't think it's a gender thing. It ain't Because if He Wasn me I would just come out. I caught a lick, Got Got got one. Got you. Shoulda known better. Yeah. Everybody ain't everybody ain't Dre. I wouldn't have worded it all pretty Societal. Yeah. Standards that you Looking at it Nigga.

What else we got that's important? Unimportant. Anybody have any idea why the Big Meech concert is canceled? 50 said don't ask him about it. He wish everybody the best. He has, he has nothing to do with it. He was the first one to post that shit quick and then got more powerful than yo think or something like that. 50 fuck around. Went down there and told the venue niggas like, yo double your amount to buy out the venue on that night.


Can't, I mean, I mean this is, you can't fight these niggas that got money like that yo. Hey I ain't gonna lie. This is a shit show. What I mean is that like when you first heard that 50 took on a big me project, I mean it He Wasn exciting, you know the success of BMF. You like damn. And then now these guys come home, you see it with T Southwest t when he first came home and that situation happened and you like, ah, maybe it'll be different with Big Meech. And then now this whole Big Meech thing. I mean 50 is a petty guy and he feels like if you take pictures with anybody, he got beef with what's up, you got beef with him. That was a good show too. He Wasn yo, that's the, that's the really bad part. Yeah. Like some of us, some of us and I love fifth, some of us are so in tune with our morals of what we believe in that we'll destroy the whole building. We don't care.


I and nigga if you do that, I'm gonna ex this whole shit. I ask this whole shit because we don't want to go back to what makes us think that way. But that's just what It is. And I don't need the money. Yeah. But all what's unfortunate is how many people lose in the situation Act? Actors. Actors. All the actors. No, all the crews. Writers. All the writers. Everybody attacks the gaffers. No one thinks about the gaffers. Nobody ever thinks about the fucking gaffers gaffers show can't be done without the fucking gaffers. That's true. What The gaffers? No Like lighting. The lighting. People behind the scenes. Oh them lighting. Like dog cash doll. You know what I'm saying? Like we had her up here, she was killing the role. She was shout the cash, do like dog, like all of those people. That was her opportunity. Even for little mech. Yeah dog. That was an opportunity for him to now potentially take that and run with it.


Like he could have been in the movie next year or two years or three years, whatever the case may be. I think it's just unfortunate. Do y'all think Lil Meech iss acting career continue to goes up, continues to go up even without the show BMF? Yeah, I think so. I think he's shown Range. No, 'cause he has only had one role. I think he's shown his ability to act on screen and I think that you can expound upon that. Like we've seen a lot of people only do one movie dog. We saw Michael K. Williams, you know what I'm saying? And his range was insane. Yeah, yeah. But people still call him Omar today from the Y you get what I'm saying? So we didn't think that he could necessarily pull off Boardwalk Empire or pull off some of these other potential roles he did.


But Lovecraft country, Meech. Yeah. Like Meech could potentially do that. I'm not, you know what I'm saying? Michael K. Williams was a really talented dude. He was So I'm not putting mech at his level. I'm just saying with some more No I wasn't doing that. I didn't have to jump in. No, no, no. I'm just saying that with some training or with some experience with little role here, little role there. The shot fa we see fucking Joey Badass, he's doing his thing. Yeah. B'S had roles other than he's had other roles. But I'm just saying his range is there. But I'm just, I don, I Don't see a big dog. He, Like I said, he needs selling Shit. He needs a good agent. That's what It is. He know real good agent. He has to get a good shot. I don't even know that acting is this guy's passion Was gonna say it depends on him I What he wants to do.


I don know he wants to continue to do that. There's the story of 50 playing, paying for the acting classes and the acting coach. And in this role where it's my dad and this story, it's my honor, it's my, it's my legacy here. Yes, I'll do this but I mean I've done seeing him carrying a lot of groceries in the time that BMF the show has been out. I know what it's like to carry groceries. Like he's been carrying groceries for his cousin. Guess What? Took one. Guess what took him to the Acme? That what BMF might have got him to the Acme to get the groceries. Yo. What? What? Yeah. Alright. But we saying the same shit. That's like the nigga that put out the hitch single and now I'm in the club every night shaking my ass. Yeah but that don't tell me that. That don't tell me how folks you can make another one on your Craft.


You are. You are. But guess what them niggas do. It tells me that's when they get back in the stu when that money start, when they back against the wall wall. When that money start going away and when shorty don't know who you are. Now I'm go back in the store if do it again, if Im ain passion though, Whatever the case May be. I'm just saying I don't know that his passion is there. I've seen too many BMF scenes where he had a in ear and like I'm not That's nuts. The field is tough. Like Joey Badass I know put in the work. Right. And it shows And you gotta compete against all these London niggas that they taking over the black, they taking over. Boy They the, yeah I think he'll get another shot because He Wasn a role that people are familiar with and if, if he wants another shot he'll get it.


But I think that will be the test. You Saw him with the IFB in his Ear? Yes. He had an in ear in multiple scenes on NB. That's crazy. Really? Yes, Yes. At some, some of them points they wasn't even trying to hide it. Did they play it off like He Wasn a hearing aid? No. No. Okay. No. So I just don't know. I hope the best Trump it can if in the 50, if we list in the 50 then you already, y'all ran through the money. He said that. That's what he's saying because 'cause they was been, they was basically saying Meech was doing it for a bag. The shit with Ross, they were saying that he was doing it for the bag until the new seat. Big Meech. Until the season started and then, you know, I guess they would've got that.


See to me if all of that is true, huge misstep. True on whose behalf? Theirs, theirs theirs. A thousand Percent on mech and them thousand Percent. If I'm waiting for my bag, You not even know my brain going, if I'm waiting for my bag and for the next season. So this can continue a certain way, I'll pass on the, I just came home money from all the rappers. Yeah. Like if it's time for me to fasten my belt, I'm fa I'm gonna tighten my belt. I'm not gonna play both. I don't think that he thought, I don't think they thought it out. I just don't think that they thought that 50 would respond with such vigor. I don't think they thought that.


You get what I'm saying? Like I don I think that they had to do it all over again and knowing what was at stake, you don't make that same choice. But I don't think that they were, they thought he was gonna respond like that. Why A lot of niggas that I don Why? So then that's two stories in a row where adults don't do their homework. A lot of nigga I don, I don't See that because he just saw it happen with his brother with t it just happened. So if we saw how he reacted with a picture with somebody I don't like over there, maybe I don't take a picture with somebody. Them og, He Wasn the recourse them OG drug dealer Niggas think that they feel like they're bosses and nobody could, you know I'm self Yeah. Nobody can't tell me that. Nobody can tell me what to do. Yeah, that exists too. That is it.


I mean It's an ego thing. I'm, I'm talking through the lens of Joe button but I also An ego thing. I also wanna say this, it comes down to the people not knowing how to preserve their money. Like we seen the same thing with with ba, you know, shout out to him. Like we just seen people that you know when they get in bed with 50 and 50 will give you the money and you Go through it, you know, you run through it quickly and then now when it's time to double back you might fuck up. And he said, yo nigga, like I gave you the opportunity I gave you had the bread and we don't know how much money they got paid too. I mean what 50? I'm only going by what? 50 said 50. I don know nothing. How much money you got? He said y'all ran through over five legal legal money. That's Crazy. If that's true, how long do you think, how long do You think it would take you to run through $5 million?


It depend on your circumstances. You I'm y'all run through. I ain't gonna run through y'all. I ain't gonna run through it. That Would sustain me for the rest of my Life. No, you're not trying to run through it. Oh, about to say am I trying to run through? I could. That would sustain me for the rest of my life. You say ab Absolutely. Absolutely. I've this business today is feast famine. Feast famine. I have gotten adjusted to the feast and I've gotten adjusted famine and I can su in the middle. I sustained on $10,000 for six fucking months at certain points in my life. So yes, 5 million be fucking amazing. We're not even, we're not even gonna get into that O Tea cookies sometimes oval tea salt. Sometimes the kindness Strangers plays a role in this Stop.


Lot of dates. Oh You right some My bad. You don't have a mic. Stop it right now. Okay. Free Food. I'm glad you did call free food because I was about to save 5 million for life without pretty girl perks. I could do no but shit Just probably a good because that has to be accounted for Mandy man. The fuck you talking about? Yeah man. You go boss man. Man shoot. No, Mandy didn't shoot man. Well I guess I don't know if she's shooting now or not, but I just saw one tweet which she said to somebody I make more than mail. And I was like, well either you mail's tax lady or there's a few things that you're not accounting for.


I guess maybe. And it Could still be true. I guess maybe she's talking about it still be up here. Yeah. But because she don't know what the fuck's going on in my, my life and what other revenue streams I have. She is, you're right. She's not my tax attorney. But if she's talking about up here compared to being on her podcast, It is entirely possible that she's absolutely right. Yeah. But You respect gotta factor in what happens when both of y'all walk into Leo DiCaprio's house? What's that? Why is that a conversation? Oh I don't know. I don't know Leo di. Alright but Leo DiCaprio Lee. Five mil five mil. I won't never, I won't never. That matters When they both walk in Joe's crib. Not Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo. No. Leo. No, no, not not Mel Leo.

You are so dramatic. She Got the fuck In hindsight, like You Could have stayed. That was a lot. I mean, you did a lot. You know, I, my, I I stood by my convictions. You know, I think that there are times where I think that certain people should not be made fucking famous. And I was like, I'm not contributing to that fucking shit. That was, this was also you. That was my con my conviction at the time. I do believe that there's certain people that we make famous and they should not fucking be famous. It's, it's a couple people that I, I told him that he wanted to have before And I said, yo, if you having them up there, I'm not coming here. Flip Steve said, I didn say Steve. That's, we said flip. No, no, no.


Not flip. Oh yeah, we said flip. Yes, nigga, I told you that before Flip came. Yeah, well back at the old spot. He was like, yo queen flip, wanna come up here? I said, yo, check this out.

That's when you was grabbing and you telling you play too much. Got you. Got you. I love y'all still came here. I feel like that little landman segment went perfect with that fucking shit that you just said about standing on your morals or whatever with Coach Floyd. Oh, that was a good one. Yo. That I, I'll and those shows, like even what we was just talking about, it'd be the little side conversations that be hitting so hard pose.


Like even in the, the Paradise, the little side conversation. I finally started Paradise. That shit is fine. And the side conversations. Are you caught up? I didn't watch the last episode yet. I watched it Tonight. Probably a, I still think we could have that convo though. We could After the fourth one. We could. Yeah. Okay. Because the fifth one wasn't nothing. We can have that conversation. I think that was a good conversation. The one that I Yeah. Yeah. He Wasn a scene in in the last episode. Where Cal, who is the, the president? The P we're talking about the television show. Oh yeah. Spoiler Paradise. Whatever. Where is Paradise? Where can they find it? Hulu. It is on Hulu. This is what's my man name? Sterling K Brown. Sterling K Brown. That's right.


And Kyle was having a young, young cow, spoiler alert. This is the fifth episode that we about to talk about, which is the newest one out young, younger Kyle Cow, excuse me, was having a conversation with his father and his dad was basically like, he was telling him, yo, I don't wanna do with any of this. I wanna go to school to be a teacher. I wanna go be a teacher in school. And the father was like, nah, you come from a long line of men who have accomplished things. You are going to accomplish things. You can pick either this school or this school. You're gonna go here. I'm sorry. No, you can pick either this senator or governor, Senator or governor. He Said you could pick governor, but you're going Into Politics Or senator for the Democrats, but you're going into politics.


And then after that we're, then we'll look into other offices. So you are going to accomplish great things. Even if I have to drag you there to get there. Like, Fuck that. You're not gonna live a mediocre life in some teacher teaching them catcher in a ride. No. This is what you're going To do. And your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren will Thank you. Well, Thank you. Said done. And He Will. So really powerful scene. He Wasn a really powerful scene. And then even the scenes that proceed, I mean, that came after that. That were based on that. Well, yeah. 'cause now we understand why this guy has been depressed. Yep. Drinking like a drinking and miserable And yeah, it explained a lot. And It also, the other powerful scene in that was the grandson. The grandson, when The father mistakes him for, And now that he's had, they're both having a conversation with who they think is cow.


So we, we left out some pieces. Yeah, go ahead. Well, we wasn't trying to explain the show. No, no. Yeah, yeah. The conversation, the portion that we were focusing on was the legacy conversations. Yes. And the one that came after, well, He Wasn really well, go ahead. It's three. But in that same thing, the old dude told his son, I'm gonna make you do this. You don't have an option in your path. I'm gonna make you choose this path. The subsequent, the next scene, he tells the son, when the son said, yo, were you ever proud of me of anything? And he tells the son, no, because everything that you got, I got for You. I did it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So you made me choose this path. But then you still condemned me because you made me go down this path that I didn't wanna fucking go down.


Yeah. And then you penalized me when you said everything you did, I did for you. You get What I'm saying? Which is, which is fucked up because it's not true. He had to execute, you know, and he, and he could have messed up along the way. He executed the plan and ended up in the direction because he could have fucked up. He just, He might not have let him fucked up. I, I don't think So. Our conversation let's about the about legacy. Legacy, yes. Yes. I think the father's right and wrong. I think that sometimes for our kids, I, I did a job one time for this rich couple and their son wanted to go to school to be, he wanted to major in psychology. They told 'em they're not paying for it. They said, we'll not pay for your college. If you go to school to major in psychology, we won't pay.


What do you think about that? I agree with them. Okay. Right. So for me, if a field just takes psychology, no disrespect to nobody. If you go to school to major in psychology, if you're not gonna go be a psychologist or a psychiatrist, then I think it's kind of a waste of money in many instances. Because it's a lot of what if that's what in that instance would he want it to be? I just said it, It also would be applicable if you wanted to be like a marketing person or something like that. There's other uses for it. But if you don't have a plan for it, it's stupid to pay regardless. Right. So a lot of times our children, Trey, you might know something that Trey don't know because you necessarily maybe not walk directly in his footsteps, but you have experience in the world that he has yet to encounter.


Right. So you might see Trey making a life changing decision that might alter his trajectory. And you know that he's making a mistake. He ain't living up long enough life to know it's gonna have consequences. So you might try and course correct. I I think it's both. I think That's not what the father was doing. The father wasn't trying to course correct. He just, he was just like, it's all about the name. Yeah. That he even, he even talked about his first name. He was like, your mother wanted to name you Arthur. Yeah. Bullshit, not strong. A weak ass name. Not strong. You needed to be a cow. So it's like Brad, he didn't Bradford, Bradford is they last name? I think Bradford. Yeah. Something like that. So the father was basically saying, you are t you're literally just going to be a figurehead in anything that I position for you.


So it's just like He Wasn such an, He Wasn such a, He Wasn such an empty exchange. But Where do y'all stand personally? Not, I'm, I'm, he said both. I'm against it because I think no matter what, you can try to steer your kid, you can't walk, you can't walk that path for them. Like in the cow instance. Yeah. Pops put you up. He made this, you ended up being a president and he was miserable. He was drinking his life away. 'cause he was miserable with that. So yeah, he achieved what you wanted him to achieve, but he didn't want that. So I think you have to, you give your your child all the information you can, you try to guide 'em the right way. You try to steer them to the right way if you can. But you have to let them still make their decisions the same way we made our decisions.


And down the line also Think you could make these decisions for the, there's a parallel right in the show, right? With Xavier, his father was the pilot. He want his, his father before that was Tuskegee Yamen. And he wanted him to be a pilot, but he couldn't 'cause his vision or whatever. But he went up being secret service and guarding the president. And now he's super proud of him. It took him a long time. But It is right there go in the show. I think. I think it's not a right or wrong. Yeah, it's not. Yeah, because I think it just depends on how they pan out. Let's say the father forced him down that road. He went on to do great things as the president of the United States and accomplished a lot and fell into the role as he got older. It just turned out he didn't like doing it when he got older. But with pushes, we've seen, I don't know if you've ever seen a video of Jalen Brunson's dad.


Y'all never seen the video of Jalen Brunson and his father's just pushing him and pushing him and pushing him. I saw the video like almost like, damn, damn near, you know, like too much. Look what he turned out to be. Right. You get what I'm saying? So sometimes it's a, it's a, It is a bright, the injustice means, yeah, sometimes. So it, it just depends. A lot of people wanna preserve their legacy. And if you think about the great grandkids and the great great grandkids and the great, great grandkids, let's say some of the Kennedys didn't go the route that they went, let's say set some of the bushes didn't go the route that they went. Like you set in the stage selfishly for maybe not even selfishly for everybody to follow behind you. Sometimes it's still selfishly to me because it's still that, that person's life to live.


You can't live somebody's life for them. Good point. But then, so the second you try to do that, great. You are being selfish. But if they, if they, if they go down the wrong path, they look, they lean on you to help them get out. That I think that's your job as a parent. That's, yeah. Yeah. Okay. And It is also your job as a, as a parent to protect your children. It is also a job as a, as a parent to make sure they preserve your legacy and you put them in position so they could benefit or become, they could benefit later on in life. A lot of times kids or teenagers or young adults go in the past of what's in now. Or convenience. Yeah. Or convenience. And then you may have a wider vision for them and say, well, this path is good. I know it's gonna be good for you.


I know you're gonna excel in it. And sometimes there's nothing wrong with pushing your kid in that direction. Hey, you know, I can speak from, from from example. I don't think that JR wanted to do anything with cameras. But it's like, yo, I, I'm able to watch you. I'm able to know that you're okay and I'm able to put you in a position that can benefit you in the long run if you stay in this field by meeting new people and building relationships. So, you know, it's important. Give you a stance, nigga. I Think that never works. I'm, I kind of agree with most of the things that ISIS said. I, I, i, I think it's no wrong answer honestly. I I, I don't think it's a wrong answer. I see both. I think the dad doing that is wrong. I see both. Me too. I Think pop doing that is wrong. What, what if the son didn't turn out that way?


So ain't turned out to be the best president in the United States history. He just needed a nudge. Look at Joe Biden's son. You get what I'm saying? Jalen Brunson wanted to be an athlete. We don't know that In the video. He's sit he's sitting there allowing himself to be pushed. He's not allowing himself to be pushed. I want to quit. You not going to quit. Yeah, but I quit After I go run full speed and get the ball, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. But that's Different. Jalen Brunson wanted to be a athlete. Athlete making You play basketball. You push Me past my limit. It's like when you go to the gym and the trainer pushes you past a certain point. That's not what was happening in this instance. Just gimme, He wanted to be a school teacher. Just Gimme an Example. In, in this specific instance, I disagree with the dad completely.


All the way. All the way. Got. And if your, if your name, if your name is powerful like that the nigga skip me. Yeah. The father. Yeah. The father was basically the father was basically saying, your life is my life to lead. Yeah. I'm not. That's it. That's, you don't have a choice in the matter. I'm Not, and again, I don't want drag this because this is a new episode. See that, that we talking about This is not an ad. It's just a good show. It's good Show spoil Paradise. Check it out. But yeah, I'm not, I don't, I don't fuck with dad. I see both. Okay. I See both. Don't, don't ruin my well shit. You can try it with me. I'm gonna show you what rebellious is Because it's a lot of pressure. And that pressure, everybody can't take it. It some, some people, kids especially some of them can take the pressure. Some of them can't. And, and in Paradise, the the last name was a successful clout having last name in real life.


Everybody is not blessed with that type of wealth and riches and power and clout and legacy. So in real life it'd be the dad projecting his failures onto his kick. Yeah. But do you know not the rich ones. Not the rich ones. Those rich people see the world from a real macro standpoint. And they know that this name carries power. I don't give a fuck what you talking about. You could be a alcohol, you could be a failure my nigga. Your name is your name and you gonna carry on a legacy of this family. I think a lot of them look at it like that. I think they marry like that. I think they do everything with that in mind. My son said he going to ringside for a pre Valentine's Day, day ringside in Jersey City.


That's not the vision I had for the legacy. And you see what I Did, however, that's how he carrying it. What you want me to do? Uncle Ish talked him out of it and steered him another way. What is ringside? I'm sorry. You ain't got, ain't gotta worry Legends from the six little Lady. You ain't gotta worry about it. You Don't worry about that Legends from the sixth stone because You know what's gonna happen the ringside when you go some somebody gonna pull up on side of you and be like, Where's my hug? No, how much? Yeah, how much you want? Yes. Right. Right on the corner. Oh yeah, Exactly. No, no, no. Well Mel wouldn't be Yo, No, no. You fish. You fish. I thought you want, that's what's gonna happen at Ringside if you go over there.


Okay. Yeah. So I'll want Tre going over there. Thank you. Got you. Puff is suing NBC Universal and a company called Ample, I wanna say over that for defamation a hundred million dollars over that piece that they put out. I saw That happening. Good, good form. Good. Yep. Good form. I I, I came in here and said it when the doc came out, I said, yo, regardless of what he did, I think he still deserves his fear day in court. And I think that those documentaries, it's like five of 'em out right now. Yeah. All these docs that come up before anything has been even they know what they started in court is nasty. I think that's crazy. Like you basically are making a case for the defense, right?


I mean for the, for the prosecution. I'm sorry You're making a case for them and you're tainting the jury. You tainting the jury fam any jury. We didn't pick a jury yet. Right? Right. So any jury selection that goes in there and you think this dude is a piece of shit. So when they do jury deliberate, I mean jury selection. Selection, yeah. They'll say, Hey Mr. Val, you ever heard of Sean Combs? Right. And you supposed to be like, nah. Right. Or what do you feel about Sean Cole? And you supposed to say no, I don't have a feeling I didn't see any docs. But if you got it in for him or somebody did some shit to your daughter Yeah. You like, yo, I'm gonna send this piece of shit away then that could taint the jewelry 'cause they've watched four or five docs on this dude. Right. You get what I'm saying? So you may be, may be taken away the fair court process that everybody's entitled to.


Agreed And Oh go ahead, go Ahead. I saying and they were highlighting the suit was highlighting the fact they had Alby sho in there basically insinuating that he killed him. Insinuating that he's a murderer. Yeah, he did. They did say that. And that's part of what they're highlighting. That's the bigger part of this I think. Yeah, absolutely. So I Be clear, I think Pub did a lot of fucked Up shit. Yeah. Word for sure. Word. I'm also with him suing them over this dock a thousand percent. The two things could be True at the same time. Yes. Yeah. Yesterday was also the finishing touches on the closing arguments in the ASAP Rocky trial. And the jury should be deliberating Today right now.


Well it's the weekend. I don't know how it works. True, true. I know there was some fuss about Asaps attorneys saying that in his closing, in the first part of his closing that the prop done did emit shells or some type of casings that came from it. And that was supposed to be like a Oh, he slipped up moment. I don dunno. We gotta see. Yeah, We'll see. We'll we see Brianna Rihanna in court with two babies makes a difference. Yeah, it does. Yeah It does. It does. Hell Yeah. Yeah. Don't say I think any mother It is right And wrong way. Detain a jury. Any Any subtle real look.


Real Subtle. Yeah. Yeah. Real subtle. Nose running a little bit. Yo like I I think that any, any, when you go to court, they'll be like, yo, bring as many family members as you can. Bring as many friends as you can. That sways the judge and the jury. Like my little cousin, they just told him like, yo, the fact that your whole community is here, it says a lot about your family and what, how solid your family structure is. Like that, that that weighs on the judges. Are you in there by yourself and nobody in there? You like this. Don't nobody care about this piece of shit thought when we were at, when we were at for surf sentencing. That's what the judge said. He was like, you know, between these letters. She said for a lot of people that's that came through here.

They do. Nah Yo, that ain't true. When That you Mean when they profit from It? Is that what you're saying? Okay. Depending on who getting hat on. But go ahead. Nothing Kanye said is new. That's my thing. So you you he's Been saying this shit for Years. You, you get what I'm saying? This ain't brand new. So all this tells me is okay now the bottom line is starting to get affected one way or another. Either it's somebody I'm working with or wanna work with. Something's happening where the, the noise is getting too loud. Now I have to come out and say something. It's kind of like the conversation we had before. Where you talking about people looking the other way about Puff. Yeah. Yeah. True. Like no people will rock with you until it starts to affect them.


Them True. True. Like I don't think it's no picking and choosing or none of that shit. Everybody's in self-preservation mode now. You fucking with me or my money is being fucked with my business is alright, I gotta say something. And even what he said, He Wasn still. I ain't gonna piss him off though. Right. He Wasn still very, very, very soft. What he said he didn't condemn what he said? He just, yo, I don't rock with no haste. I ain't on that side. Yeah. So, so, so now y'all can stop saying Talani ain't say nothing. I said something leave me alone. Let go back over here. Let's hope it go away. 'cause the last nigga's, the condemned Kanye speak speaking, he completely shut them niggas down. Everybody that went against him, he cut 'em off. So I don't wanna fuck up that relationship.


Yeah. I don't wanna fuck, but I don't wanna fuck up these relationships either. That's all this is. It's self preservation. That's it. I agree with that. It's getting harder and harder to stand next to 'em I would imagine. Yeah. Yeah. It's tough to stand next to anybody and you don't have any idea when they're gonna wig out. That's true. That part. Yeah. Like if you dealing with a wig out then, You know what I mean? Especially When the wig outs are that like When them niggas was talking about, I think I came in and told y'all when Harmful when he was talking about y'all coming to Japan for an interview. He Wasn like yeah that might be cool but in the event that I get on a plane to Japan and land and you wig out. Yeah, Yeah. We got a different problem. And Even if you wig out a year from now, it's still not great, eh?


No. It's a little different. It is different if I'm, if I get on a plane in Japan and that's when you decide to work out or we do a great interview. I get on a plane on the way back now you out shit. Drop my shit editing. It is, it's competitive right now. Or I dropped my interview today and you wig out today, next week. Y'all niggas that standing next to him, y'all know what time It is Ty specifically because you a artist. Y'all doing the music. You on his album, y'all got this series of albums. It's like yeah you affect him more than just yourself. Yeah. Not Ty. Yeah. Yeah. Not Ty. I guess he gotta say that you Have to But it looks away. You start getting uncomfortable phone calls from your family and shit like that. Like when you got those who, those who really matter to you now that's like, you going to do that.


Let's say you running around with Ye and then pop calls you like, yo, what's up with you? Yo, how you feeling about that? You see what he doing? Well Joe Button wouldn't be running around with nobody. Nah, but I'm just giving. I know, I know. But let me let the audience know. Just so we clear. I'm not one of the run around niggas. I think that's Controllable. There's a bunch of people out there that's a run around nigga. You could spot 'em if you look hard enough. That's a big thing going on today. Put me on the record. I'm not running around. Right Smart Now. I think the family stuff is controllable. I think the secret owner of the company that you doing business with that fill a certain type of way that that's something you can't control your family. You could control. I think these niggas be having partnerships and you don't be knowing who own these brands and some of the people that own these brands or is the silent financier and some of these brands be the people that's getting pissed off and they'll start pulling those buttons.


Pushing those buttons. Yeah. Now you got it. Yeah. Are we all buying the Kanye album when it drops? No. No. You not buying it? No. Really? Why? Can I ask a question like before it dropped and like the snippets came out, were they heat, yes or no? They were all heat. Do you need the snippets were heat? Yes. Hear 'em first. Yeah, I need to hear 'em. Really? VV vultures two is trash. So So if I go by just, it's Kanye, I'm not gonna run and buy it and you put out it's some trash. I'm might Stream it though. That's I'm saying if it's some heat, I'm not gonna sit help sit up here on this platform and lie and say I ain't listening to it. I'm not copying nothing. I'm not gonna see here. I'm not at that time.


If It is heat, I'm going to get, I'm gonna stop trying to put, I'll illegally download it. That's what I'll do. There you go. There we go. There we go. I'm not gonna spend my my 1599 for it. He can, he can have my 0 cents Now. I won't be buying nothing off his website. Well he no one will Now They took it down. They took it down and he wrote a handwritten note up there that says Yeezy store is coming soon. So he says, I guess he's trying to like, brick and mortar gonna fail. I don't know. It's All online. It's all online. Shopify. See you start playing with the people, start playing with the people. So I mean he, he, he got enough money that he could pay somebody to generate a platform that does all of that shit.

My organization is a cultural group for L-B-O-O-L-G-B-O, Nigerian American Professionals. We have chapters all over the country. But I wanna focus on the tri-state because you all definitely have your finger on the pulse of New York. Oh, Thank you. Our chapter is entering their 10 year anniversary and we are killing it with the programming. But we still see a lot of the same issues as before.


Unpredictable attendance and memberships coming and going and It is still very hard to get sponsorship. What can we do to get more eyes on us? And more than that, more than that. People from the greatest city on earth are hard to pin down. What can we do to make our events, the the events, the it, the IT promotion or change our visibility? I, I'm assuming that's a typo.

I can't see if I'm misspelling anything. Don't read this out loud. You definitely misspelled some things.


Alright. We got a young business owner here inquiring about branding. How do I get more I on my mission Invest in Dr. Omar nigga. Let him come up there and, and, and, and do a speech. They go that's, you gonna bring attendance In general investing though is, is investing in having somebody come and speak or have somebody with a name that believes in your same rhetoric. Come up there and speak and you know. Alright, so you don't have any help for this person. I that's, I think that's pretty good. Why? Why you don't think that's helpful? You want this person to have Dr. Umar come up there. They said that for the Nigerians. He's okay. Not even Dr. Umar. I'm saying somebody who's popular, who has a following that could bring visibility to your program.

Yes. And have them come up there. Or you could find a superstar that may not be that influential in their sector, but that has a little cache with y'all that that could come up there. 'cause he said he'd been doing it for 10 years. Yes. So he's definitely did some trial and error. I don't think I said it's a shortcut. I think after 10 years you're not really taking shortcuts.
