Do I don't really check my Instagram dms.


Well first let me address this. Lemme address this. That little Chelsea Pier Court. I've been there quite a few times. Me too. Okay. And very quickly learned that that was for athletes. Yes, I've seen plenty Of them there. He's like the professional. He's right, he's right. No, it depend on what day you go. But last One I saw There was feel like for feel like I never went on no day where it was always Joe Johnson in the GNX. I'm like nigga wait, y'all got him? Yeah. Yo, that's the 40 and up league. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No that no way. I, I'm want like a little YMCA type of athlete level but not gym. I just want a nicer gym.


I don't wanna see no professional athletes. You wanna do it inside? Right. We're doing it inside. Okay. I, yeah, I ain't playing outside. It's December. We're not playing outside. What you talking about? I So you went to your dms? What happened Joe? You said you I continuously curve pause all of them. Lethal shooter dribble too much. Who else? All of them like the Instagram All Stars filet. And they, they be wanting do content. They, they hit me up. They nice. Yo man, I'm in New York such and such. Let's go to the gym, get some shots up, da No. Nope. I ain't, I I'm scared. Are they trying to send you a message? No, they just wanna do some content. Them some some dope shit. Shout to y'all wanna do it? Shout out to Lethal Shooter.


Yeah. Yeah. Remember a few years ago they asked me to shoot a free throw at the Houston Rockets game. I was like no, you wanna do a free throw? You wanna do a free throw at the Houston Rockets game? No. What jersey would you wear? I wouldn't valid question. He wear three headbands this time. Cool. I'm cool. I'm cool. I'm cool. No, I wouldn't do that. Really. I don't want to volunteer to go stand in the center anywhere with 20,000 people looking at me. I don't wanna volunteer to do that. What? Why? Because he ain't doing for the money. You worried about he's himself. That's what I'm saying. You worried about missing? I just said would you throw out the first pitch outta a Yankee game? No. No.


That is what? Transl I wouldn't volunteer to do that. That's crazy. If they asked me to do that, I probably would turn that down. I don't. Why? Why? Because it's fun. Well most people are doing it also for the chance to win the money. It's an experience though. It's an experience. I'm sacrificing some fun just asking. I don't want to go anywhere where the entire universe is watching me do something. Weren't you a rapper on stage? Nah. Yes. What's the difference? You know what I mean. People watch this. What? There's Oh Shit insinuating. Nobody watched him on stage. No. And I'm not saying that at all. He say I won't give you the old pod back watch. It was a rough start. Go ahead, get your shit off. I don't, I don't care. But to that point, there's probably more people watching the Houston Rockets game than have ever watched Joe Button rapping Joe button rapping.


I wasn't the biggest promoter of myself. And that's didn didn't have any other skills or traits to do. That's how I fed myself. Yeah. That that was my way of Got you, got you. But you didn't, you didn't get, you didn't feed off the crowd once. Well when you on stage. Yeah. That's as though maybe sitting there making that free throw throw at the first picture. I give you that same energy. I gained absolutely nothing from hitting this free throw or missing this free throw. I'm just under scrutiny as an introvert. That's fair. That's fair. You would do it sports? Yeah, absolutely. I've done it before I go on six court and shot. Yeah. At halftime? Yeah. Once like maybe years ago. You, you would be on a kissing cam with your, with your partner? No.


What's the difference? I had a really good joke but I will say that one. Yeah, you gotta go home. I miss playing basketball in front of crowds. I miss hooping. So like that that, that brings me something different that I, that I would kissing your partner. I do that every day. Got it. When any of y'all do the kissing camp? Yeah. Parks definitely. At what game? Atlanta. Is it all game? I'll do it in like the fucking you the quietest game. Go to Nuggets game. Even the magic, the Orlando.


How the Wizards doing? Like I said the Arizona State. Nah, I ain't doing the Wizards game. Volunteers at the Wizards game nigga. A Warriors game? No, a Lakers game. Sorry I'm talking shit right now. I would do it at any game. I would do it at any game. Okay. Kissing. Kissing cam and kiss cam is a lie in DC at the Wizards game. Sorry, I was sorry. Sorry buddy. You get, you get a Raptors game out of me, you get a Raptors game. You just give her a dap in those games. What's up? And you gotta sit next to her not, and not even acknowledge nigga. I gotta beat your phone nigga. Who the fuck was that? That Chris Brown left at home to go to the Carucci.


Carucci. Yo, that's wild. Christmas morning he be back. He go to the store, he'd be back. Yeah. Gonna get some cigarettes. A nigga went to the Laker game with Rihanna. No ice. You can't do that. I guess a relat. Yes you can. Can. You're mad. You cannot do that. Wouldn't none of us can do that. He can't do that. You can't. He can do that. We don't have to argue. Just the ignorance side of it. I heard but you about to say you understand? Yes nigga, everybody in here understand. First of all, Rihanna, you can't do it. But what you doing Rihanna was his ex is number one. Number two, you know you gotta clean it up. Sometimes your ex is better than your next. He had to clean it up. So he went and I'm gonna get some cigarettes and went out there and didn't give a fuck who saw how it was seen.


He knew what he was doing. Man, y'all niggas can't really talk about it. But I have telepathy. I could read y'all minds. You can't read my mind nigga. Sometimes you got tickets, good tickets to a game and the list got shorter about who you could invite. What? Yeah, you got, I don't like what you talking about. I was like sometimes you were in a relationship but got tickets to a game and maybe didn't want to take your partner us you saying. But the list was very, very short on who you could go to that game with. So you think because there was a chance that that camera would pan that way.


Right. And now you are centered screen with this bitch. Nigga, that shit happened to me, had the fucking, I'm with Kareem, my nigga. Right. Hey Mark got took us to la, me and Mark on the floor. I don't know what the fuck you talking about. This shit was happening to me at like a McDonald's game or some shit at the Barclays for like the high school All stars like Oh, Shit. So these niggas get press up in here, they spot playing with cameras. Boy you crazy. Yeah, they'll spot your ass. Gotta stay away from the anyways. Anywhere in the world. Y'all wanna start. What I will say to y'all is the other day in New York City, not to region regional US out here the other day in New York City homeboy that killed the Michael Jackson impersonator on the train, they had closing arguments for him.


For those of you that don't remember the story we reported on it. We talk about back. Yeah, that was a couple years ago now. Yeah, it was happening in May last Year. Yeah. Something like, was it? Oh yeah, I thought it was longer than that. No, but guy came on the train being quote unquote unruly making some people feel quote unquote uncomfortable. Some people felt quote unquote threatened. So this ex-Marine dude got up. Oh yeah. Put him in the choke hold, got him on the ground, continued to choke him. Other passengers came there, didn't break it up, they just huddled around him. As a matter of fact, one of them held the dude's arms. Yeah, Yeah. While he Was in the choke hold. So Exactly. And that guy died.


So closing arguments was the other day. Not to start us off. Ont his morbid, A rest in peace to that man as well. Huh? Isn't his somebody, the ex-Marine, isn't it like his father? There was something his father worked for, like the chief of the police, something like that. He took him. So he turned himself in on charges. He turned his himself in. They let him write out we, I just wanna know where everybody here stands on what they think should happen to that man. That sounds like at the very least manslaughter of some sort. Yeah, I think he Should get some negligent homicide or That Yeah, I, I don't know. I think definitions all he should, I Think he should go to jail. Yeah. I think he should go to jail because one of the prosecutors' witnesses was the, was his instructor who actually taught him the choke hold.


And so he has an understanding of what that can do. Like over the course of time. A period of time. Yeah, exactly. So there's a point in which he knew that this guy was no longer a threat and he was probably out cold, but he still held him until he passed away. And so to me that's negligence. He held him for six minutes. Yeah. Which is crazy. You, you lose oxygen for eight seconds, you can nod out. Exactly. So The teacher that karate, if you choke somebody for eight seconds, they could go to Sleep. That was excessive. All four Minute Mel. Sorry, Thank, you. Let's get this bottom of this karate class. Were you 36? My man, take karate nigga. Leave him alone bro. You go to Tiger show karate before outside. Yes, of course he is. What belt you get?


He's a yellow belt. We not gonna get into all this bro. I'm, that's my last question and I'm I'm white bro. You not gonna tell us what belt I'm yo, listen, so he, he had to be begin procrastinator, This shit out that nigga. Yellow or brown? White. White. You still Yeah. Yeah. I got one. Oh, you gotta come in the pod. You po got karate shit. Stupid But. yeah. So if you choke somebody for a minute, once they lose consciousness and you keep choking them, you gonna kill them my nigga. If you choke 'em long enough. How many bricks did you break? Nigga was in there getting slid.


He had to get up outta there. How old you when you took how old last year? I've trained a few times. Oh wait, what saying trained. Yeah. Yeah. Don't say that to us again. You fuck you up nigga. You got belt don't trained us. You got belts then. Damn belt. You Got it. Hoodies and clay ain't no damn belt. Oh you gotta come out with the Ish karate suit. Now you got Ky. I don't even know if I fit that shit. No, but you gotta make your own I. gotta. So why you was so scared when that nigga was trying to kill me over there by heavens? Then if you knew karate nigga fix Ish. Bring head into the stance. I'm not, yo not style.


I'm not gonna tell you. This stupid nigga had a fucking crocodile dunk D knife in the middle of queens. I'm ready for This shit nigga. They got guns. Fuck you talk about nigga. I agree with Parks and male can't wait to hear the rest of you guys' stance. I think you, I think you're down with this dude. Go to jail. You need to go to jail. I think that absolutely if he don't go to jail, you set a precedent that anytime you feel like somebody being a vigilant irate Yeah. That you could put him to sleep. No nigga fuck is you talking. But then hold on. They could have just held dude until, if that was the case, they could have just held. I think excessive holding is, is is what did it. But sometimes we do want people to be vigilante. Sometimes we watch motherfuckers out there carry on and nobody's helping the women.


Nobody's helping the children. Niggas just on the train do. And sometimes we hope when we watch a video we like, yo, why they're not doing anything. And I why those men are aren't helping. I just feel like he, it was excessive. He just went too far. Cool. And, and I I'm with you on that. You be cool with that. I, I jump in on people's shit sometime when I see like, you know, I was in Brooklyn like a little while ago. I saw a young boy, like he was arguing with his girl, he's about to hit her whatever. And she's like in his face like pussy, you ain't gonna do nothing. So I stopped him, made even go the other way. Then she tried to follow him up the, she was like, no, no, you're not gonna do that. You go the other way. Very good mo stop. Right. That that's, that's my mom does the same thing. Yeah man can't, I couldn't watch him do that. You're bad mother fucking business nigga. And then what happens? I'd have been like, you got, you know what my bad she is disrespectful.


Oh. yeah. you turned quick, right? Oh yeah. But that don't mean, but I'm still not rooting for nobody to go to jail. I, I'm, I I I'm an abolitionist so I don't a prison abolitionist. So I don't actually believe in prison. I don't believe in prison as the solution to these things. It's tough on a case. Like wait at all for yo you ostentatious. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's ostentatious. He is not ostentatious. Quite the opposite. In fact, yo dogs. So you don't believe that Take it to the extreme. No, no. No you don't believe that you're gonna say child molester rapist. No, I'm about to say for any reason that people should be removed from society, everyday society. There are times where people need to be removed from society, but, and where do they go? Well that's, it depends on the situation.


So for example, most people who are in jail, in jail, jail for nonviolent offenses. True. Right. So most of what we have, we don't need that for, you know, I, people need drug treatment and rehab. They usually don't need to be in jail for a drug addiction. I got so many people who I agree with that You know what I mean. So that's one. Then you got the serial killers, the child molesters, you know people like that. I don't know anybody who is a serial killer or a child molester who does not have a mental health, health issue. I don't know anyone who, who. So you think they should, should go to therapy? No, I think they, I think sometimes people need to cure confinement but not in a prison. Sometimes you need, for example, an actual mental health facility until you're better. Until you're well so like ark of asylum back To your Batman shit.


Or if you lock a door on me and I can't get out of this particular, whether you call it a room, whether you call it a cell, whether you call it whatever. If you are locking me in here, it's prison. No, but prison is punishment and mental health facilities aren't, you know, there are people who get put in who get committed to mental health facilities and they're not like prison. Now some of 'em are and those ones don't work. My whole prison doesn't work. That's the problem. Prison doesn't work. It doesn't, you think you don't believe in prison reform because we don't need to, we have an example here. What do you think should happen with someone like the ex-Marine? Dude, this is, this is the example that that's, that tests my theory the hardest. 'cause I have no sympathy for him. I'd have to know more about him. I have know why he did It. is he some marine combat that has PPT s that thinks he every incident is a death sentence for everybody else.


Now in his case, he might need mental health treatment. He, I think there needs to be some kind of restitution to the family. There needs to be something happen and a good old fashioned ass whooping it might be fine. But what I don't necessarily think is that put him in the cage for 10 years is gonna make him better. So lemme ask you my last and final question and then ice you can get to this and, and then he can close us out. Where, what do you think they should have done with r Kelly? That's a, that's a perfect example right now. R Kelly is, there are a few things with r Kelly. One is what he was doing actively was being funded by our money. So there should have been injunction civilly to stop him from being able to have a damn cult in his house. That would've stopped a lot of This shit. Second thing is he, there should have been orders that not to not allow him near children or at McDonald's or these other things to keep him away from people.


He obviously has a mental health issue. He obviously was abused. He obviously had trauma. I'm not making excuses for him. I'm saying we need to, he might be somebody who needs to be outta society for a little bit just like the Boston Marathon Bomber. But the point is that's a very small number of people. That's like, maybe like one or 2% of the people in prison. Most people in prison do not need that. Most people in prison need something else. That's all, all I would agree with that. Okay. I I you, you, you answered my question. I'm ask you about Derek Chauvin. Chauvin, same thing. And it's hard 'cause I I, I'd be, I don't be rude for these dude. I mean Dylan roof. I didn't want Dylan the roof to go to, to get a, to get the, the, the death penalty. I, I hate the death penalty, but I ain't lose no sleepover. I'm not, I'm not death penalty Stupid. Yeah. I'm not gonna march and pick it for that shit. But I, I don't want it to happen.


You know what I mean, honestly. 'cause what happens, it happens to us more than anybody else. That's true. You know what I mean. So that's why Yeah. You did a good job. Yeah. A good, good job explaining Thank, you explaining that. However, I I would not agree with you on the serial killers having mental health issues. I feel like vast majority of 'em have personality disorders, but I don't know enough which isn't Vary a which isn't the same as a classification of mental Health. That's fair. I don't know enough to have, I don't know enough to argue with you that I, I literally don't know enough about psych psychology to know. But I know they need to be some, there are people who need to be away, just not most people. And I think we use prison as the answer to everything. You on drugs, put 'em away. You homeless, lock 'em up. That's true. You, we, we lock You. right. Everybody. I've been home absolutely stumped over who killed JonBenet Ramsey.


Same too. Me too. I hate that. I done watched This shit. Me too. Hated Their family. The mom and dad dirty I think Very much so. The media. Yeah. That was crazy. The shit they were putting on them, har Geraldo and them that Should, who the fuck did that? Who did this? I have no Idea. I think it was some, he was making a lot of money and I think that there was probably some connection or I think it was actually, it also could have been, there was like a dude that was assaulting a bunch of people breaking into people's houses in the area. Around the same time there was the other PDF guy that they, he admitted to it, but then the DNA NA didn't match. So maybe there was a, a discrepancy. DI think I was like, who found was found in Thailand or something like that.


Yeah, Yeah. He Was, he should be locked. The shit that he was saying, he should go to jail. He Was, he was a teacher and shit like that out there in, in another country. Yeah. Yeah. I just think it's crazy that we still obsessed with missing white women. Like I, I JonBenet Ramsey. Wait, well she wasn't, wasn't blessed enough to be a woman. A woman. I'm sorry. I don't mean to use, I mean I meant women like gender wise. Not, not women versus girl, female. Yeah, sure. What I, oh, this is such a bad topic to do that on. I think all of us as a community should be concerned. I am concerned happens to children. I am concerned. What I'm saying is it's been 30 years and I feel, I wish the media did equal attention for everybody. It's not that I don't want JonBenet Ramsey, I just don't want it to only be JonBenet Ramsey. It's a, it's a hell of an interesting case. But like Latoya Figueroa in in Philadelphia was missing the exact same time Natalie Holloway was missing.


We look for her. We don't look for Latoya Figueroa. It's like missing black girls don't get, they're not missing. They're just gone. And I just, I just want us to make documentaries about them. Them too. You little girls of color. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. I just, I want 'em both. I Got it. Yeah. Because they, what they did to her was terrible. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Like I learned a little bit more. Yeah. About what was, Yeah. It was. That's terrible. It is awful. It seems like it was someone that was a Familiar with the family. I don't wanna say professional, but like the little tool shit that he like Who makes a garot? Like Yeah. That, that thing It's just, it's a ran, it's so random. Like who makes that? Yeah. I mean that's someone that's like done some shit before. Yeah. So that's why like them thinking that at one point it was her brother. Like bur that seems Courtesy.


Yeah. So nice. You're basically be careful 'cause he's suing people. He sued CBS. Well no, but no should. It's basically He won a lot of money. So Let's not No, I'm basically saying it's insane that they could think that a 10-year-old would sophisticated know how make a garage. I understand. you know what I mean. Like that's just very fucking weird to me. I'm looking for That ice. Alright. Thank you. Oh, A garage. Oh, okay. Yeah. It's like a choking device. Yeah. Trigger warning. Yeah. Probably to anybody that's listening Or Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. It's okay. Thank. you bro. Thank you. It's all right. Y'all appreciate you. Let's just bring it back in. Everybody looks beautiful. Smelling good. Let's give it a second. Our apologies to anybody that You know what I mean.


We started with some sensitive subject matter, but when you organic it happens like that sometimes. Alright. Alright. Let's just bring it back in, man. Bring it back in. Rest in peace to everybody. Rest in peace to everybody that we lost. I have a question for you. When you have time, I always have time for you. You crazy. I just have a question about, maybe not the time, but about therapy.


Last time we had a conversation about therapy and then I watched the clip with you and Shota. Mm. And I just felt like therapy could be used as a crutch because when I watched it, I felt like you were still in your manipulative tactics when I watched your response to her. So you think he weaponized it? Yeah. I What was the, what's the point of therapy or keep going? I feel like some people just go to therapy just to say they go to therapy. I think it's a new, it's a new thing to do. It's like Gucci. Yeah. To me. And I watched it. I said, you know, I watched it and you, I do see a difference. But then I watch you say, I watch you go back and do the same thing.


Like, I watched you weaponized. I watched, I like, damn, this nigga is good, but why the fuck is he going to therapy if he's gonna still do the same thing like the, the Uch, You know what to do and what not to do. Right. It's facts. You know what to do and what not to do. So it just, it just fu that part fu I thought about that shit on my whole trip. So you was in Puerto Rico? No, because I wash it. I wash it around. Nice ass. No, no, no, no, no. Hot weather We on this mission. 30 degrees. My man came out yesterday. That mean he had the plane wifi on Patreon seeing what's going on. No, because I watched it and I thought about, I'm like, damn. Like he's so adamant about how important therapy is. Right. And Therapy's supposed to help you change and identify your issues.


Right. And then, but why are you still going back doing the same thing that, that you went to therapy to address. What was the same thing? Just to manipulate. Being dismiss, being dismissive. That's not manipulative. Huh? That's not manipulative. That's just dismissive. But then, but then don't your therapist tell you not to be dismissive. Then you go to therapy to identify your dismissive behavior and to correct it. So why go back to it? You just gonna keep doing it. To go back to it, it's spend money. But the therapy is for you to properly internalize something yourself and then showcase that change in real life. So I think you're looking at that wrong on camera. We able to discuss it like that on camera because we already got through it and we got through it.


Got it. Okay. Because there was extensive therapy, extensive communication, understanding where you was coming from. Where I was coming from. By the time you see it on Cam, it's old Got it. Okay. Okay. I see. Does it reignite the fight when you see, when y'all look, go back and look at it or when your lady goes back and look at it? Like, does that, does that bring back the anger? Not for, not, not for us. Okay. Not, not for us. That shit was fine. But she makes valid points sometimes. Oh yeah. She was, she was. That's only feed you to look at your, your partner and say, all right. You was right about that. Maybe I bugged out. Yeah, it was, yeah. It was, it was a good episode. I I loved watching it and seeing y'all all up appear doing your thing. Parks came out. I mean, I know it's not com a competition.


It's, but he won. He absolutely won. He got some, he got some unspoken rule, unspoken understanding. Like it just, it just, it blends well. We just blend. Well that's saying, that's what I'm saying. No one's loved the same. That's true. And how it's expressed That's true. Is unique to each relationship. That motherfucker had a triple double in that kid that shit. And he know how to digress at the right time. Oh yeah. Well, hey. Yeah. I watch it. Yeah. Fox, do y'all Intend on participating in The No. She gonna pull a gun outta every, everything. Women No. Behind the guys. No, no, no. On the pod thing. No, No, no. It's too much.


I'll do it. Okay. I turned my wife's Patreon off. She doesn't even know the show exists. I saw Imani tweeting. He was like, yo, it'll be dope if me flip. I saw an Ish, but we would never do it. I was like, how? You know? You don't know that. Would you do it? I would. Okay. I didn. I know you're very private, so I didn't know. It is different. It is, It is. I would do it. I just would, we would, we wouldn't try to argue on there and try to bring our fucking dirt to This shit. Gotcha. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm not looking to go here and expose This shit. Yeah. That's what the plan should have been for everybody. Just Shada or fucking like, we not gonna go up there and try to, yo let's, let's but however you've been, let's have it out here.


Doesn't make for entertaining TV if you don't. See And that's where the It can, yeah. It is not entertaining if all of us are sitting there being Parks. That's the point. Yeah. Somebody had to do it. And again, it's, it's my shit. I edit it out when I was really bugging. Oh yeah. About to get this, this is the very clean version of boy. And I watched it back, back to your therapy point. I watched back the full edit, said I look like a complete jerk and my energy is off. And what a dick. And you see a partner trying to do everything right and you just a dick. I called her and apologized again.


That's real. Like, wow man, I didn't know. I know she's real. That's real. I didn't know I looked like that. How do you even deal with that? I'm so sorry baby. I love you. And sometimes that's what it take it, it takes seeing it. Seeing it. Yeah. Yeah. Like they'll tell you something like, my man, my girl, we already talk.

I have a, I have a football question. Shoot. What's up? And I mean they, they're not able to explain. Oh they explain to me but I'm not understanding. So a lot of people are on that guy's case Aziz for Yeah. Hit on Trevor. Long Trevor, right. Three games suspension for him. Yeah. So he got three. So what I'm saying is That is that it's that move that he did. Is it, it's illegal. It's illegal. It's illegal. But is it practicing football? Do other people do it And could he avoid, could he have avoided doing that? Not like is It is this excuse that's not today. Today's football. Okay. It's not. Okay. That's not today's football. Today's football. You cannot do that under any circumstances at all. I think they were playing two different footballs. Trevor Lawrence slide is today's football, Aziz is hit is old school football.


Right. Welcome. So I I agree with both. I think we should teach quarterbacks how to, how to stop the play and not slide. So protect yourself. Maybe head first. Aim for the knees down. I heard a couple of the retired players say that and some of the coaches and I think players need to not do, but the problem, the problem with That's a tough play. That's tough. That, that was tough. That play was tough. 'cause the problem with That is they showed a couple of 'em, pat Mahomes highlights where you think he's about to, that reaction time was, it ain't like he was in the slide and didn't do it was bang bang you if you think he's gonna slide. 'cause you still wanna stop the play. Right. So if the way, the way football, you still wanna get paid.


Well yeah. The way football is, is the second the quarterback goes to slide, he's giving himself up. You don't touch him. I want to get paid. So I'm I'm not doing it Got. it, it's, it's, it's tricky. It is a slide. Joe It is just six points. Oh darn it Joe. That shit was tricky bro. It is the slide a easy way out? I don't understand. Submit you submit, you're giving yourself up to so that you don't get hit. Yeah. So you could Oh Got it. If you running the ball, if you running the ball, Got it in football, you could just submit. You don't gotta get hit. You could just kneel down. Oh, Got it. Okay. Okay. So I see why everybody, people are mad. They calling for him to be out the league and all that stuff. Nah, don, don wasn't dirty. It ain't, it wasn't that dirty. It wasn't really that dirty. It did, it wasn't bad. I they dragging it but it wasn't illegal hit. It was they dragging it because he got hurt.


I think they dragging it. Yeah, I was about to say they dragging it. He was time. You see that hand go up? Yeah. It's like too much for tv. Turn the TV off. Turn the TV off. Get the camera off of him. Turn the TV off. Turn. Yo, why won't allegedly Drea get outta this man's house? She feels like she has. I'm asking y'all. She, she feels like she has an equitable stake. She remodeled the crib. You not arguing on the stand on the side of squads. I'm asking you why the, I'm answering you. Why she remodeled and she felt like they had an agreement. Yeah, she yeah, she was renting the house and he was supposed to sell her the house. She put an 3.8. Well that was his counter offer. Are you on? Pardon? No. No, nigga. This is what you just asked. Why this is the why. No, no, I I'm with him.


I know the real reason. I'm on his side. I know about their argument. Hey, I want you to buy his, I don't care about that. I'm on his side. Your new, your brand new baby daddy. That's why you gotta go has 500 s or 300 s or something coming his way. Crazy. Get out. That's your brand new baby daddy. Y'all are actively together. Just get out, get out, get the fuck out. Yeah, I don't, I don't. Y'all telling me but, but, but YI thought you was asking. No, no I'm asking for the nigga, the nigga side, but hold on. How about nigga side? Obviously there's a thing going on in the industry because Ari just stated that G Herbo still pays her bills while she's with what's the nigga name?


Money back, money back. Yo, she just said that Yo G Herbo still pays her bills, which I think is crazy to even, he, I want to be careful with that. Yeah, because saw, because I didn't fact check that and she came out and tore the blogs a new asshole for saying that. She said that. Okay, so she didn't say that. I don't know that she said that, but she reacted as if she didn't say it. React, react didn't say that. I'm gonna respect that. Okay. God let's respect and, and I ain't gonna hold you. That woman is solid. I don't know her. Yeah, she is. But how she represents for them. She should teach a class in. Absolutely. So I don't think she ever getting on no interview to say with intent. True or false. Yo, my baby daddy is holding and then she ain't do that.


She ain't don't, she gets the benefit of that from me. 1000%. That lady solid. She's a a, a textbook image of how she no she is how she should go? She's from Chicago. She so she, she, she moves accordingly. I don't know where she from. I learned about her from him and how she holds them down. I understand. And I agree Fucking Parks. But but to but to your question, you're a little sloppy to your question. I'm I'm with you. You gotta go. Yo. Get out. come on man. Get out. You got a nigga new baby all that. Get the fuck outta fuck outta my house. No, not just you got a new nigga. Your new dude is all the way up like Fat Joe and Rim. I don't care. You get out.


You are his problem. You have to go yo. You go. I agree. She she's out. Pack it up. What boy is she? I be feeling like clunking the shit outta you sometimes you can't beat me. Who's that dog? Me. He can't, he does karate. He can't you buddy. I went and quit the same time. Yo. I gotta a white belt somewhere too. Dogs tell me why. Why, why can't she just stay? Oh, come on. No, no. Chill out. I'm going. I just told you. Why why? Because her new fa because her new baby daddy got money. That's part of it. That's his argument. That's part of it. And this, it ain't no like secret relationship. This is the relationship you're in privately.


Publicly. What that guy do? He's staying here. I live here. Why don't the new baby daddy buy the house? I live here. Yeah. Why isn't the new baby daddy buy the house? Because I live here. He should for free. We don want you to live here. I know. Move. And, and when I came in here and said the same exact argument, y'all niggas looked at me like I had 15 heads when I said niggas is out here stealing people money, staying the niggas shit and won't move. And y'all said so I wouldn't move neither. You conflate two different things and you always do that. No, I am con no just the the cause is the only difference nigga. We and and without Drea and her rich baby daddy, we support the squatters nigga. Yeah. That's his money. Your landlord head ass That is trying to trap somebody. No, that that's his money.


Fuck and all that landlord shit. We support the squatters. Now if the squatters got s then you know you should not wanna stay anywhere where you're not wanted home. Don't even feel like home if you, if you not wanted D It is not your home. What's the's? The mansion. It might, huh? I might not give a fuck if I'm one than it ain't man my home. It's not a man. It your, it ain't your home. It's my home. I gotta a question. Don don't know the story but Ty Taylor don't bother nobody. Shout out to Ty shit together. What, what's, what's her argument for why she should stay? That's the part I'm not following because she decorated the home and she, she said because she put a Christmas tree up. She a her argument. She said she a couple hundred grand on renovating the house and they had a verbal agreement. That's her argument that he was gonna sell it to her.


She was sell it to her. She was rent to For a set price. For a set price. Yes. While they were together. While they was together. And she put a couple hundred grand into the house to renovate it. So she said she feel like, yo, I did these renovations under the guise that you are gonna sell it to mere. come on, let it go. I mean if everybody to me in this case, just hearing what you just told me, I she gotta go. But I would give her, I would reimburse her for what she put into the house and just tell her she gotta go. Wait, what? No, no owner has done that. No landlord doing that. No owner has done that. Not as a landlord as an x. Stop touching me. No owner did that when the renter made upgrades. No, no. I'm I'm not talking about as a landlord. I'm talking about as an ex how I would resolve a conflict with an ex. They cl they are, they didn't have amicable exits. No. Clearly Mark. No, I get that.


I'm just saying what I would do to resolve this conflict. If, if everybody's up, if money's not an issue, then I would just look, I get this ain't about money dog. You went and got with some 22-year-old extra wealthy ass nigga and we wasn't on the best of terms after the breakup. I'm not paying you for none of upgrades. Good. Get out. Good looking for upgrades though. Even if we made an agreement that you gonna sell it to me. Yeah. What agreement? What agreement? I'm saying if but if if there was where's the paperwork? Show me y'all. Y'all dirty. That's where monster, he he feel like he was done dirty. The truth is It is a big con. It's, it's, it's It is a deeper conversation to, to be had is that us as niggas are more emotional than women and nigga we are petty. So fuck outta here bitch, you gotta leave.


Period. Leave. I don't give a fuck what I said when your pussy was good when I was fucking you. Yes. I said I get I told you the world nigga, I'm gonna give you Aladdin's carpet. What? What? I lied. What did em said? Fuck what I said. It don't mean shit now. Yeah, it don't. Wow. Your word gotta mean something though. That's what I'm saying. No it don't. No it don't. We have feelings Mark. We not, we're not your word gotta mean something emotionally mature. Like you ain't not about being mature. Mature. This is my word is my word. I'm saying I'm not saying she should squat. I'm saying she needs to go. I Wait, wait, wait. I agree what your word should mean something. I also reserve the right to change my word when you changed behavior. Mm. But once you, but if you've already made an investment Nope. And you've already given me consideration.


I can't, I should have thought about that before I invested. You did that on your own. We didn't have that talk. The look we was fucking, I was enjoying it. I said some shit when I thought this could go somewhere. You clearly had a different plan. So now get out and I'm keeping the granite absolutely Thank you. Then I'm calling my friends, y'all I gotta some extra grand. S not my favorite grant. This ain't really my bad because you got a nigga that may be up than me. I'm gonna be petty and give it to somebody else. Yeah. That's yeah. That's how we go. You have to get outta my house. You gotta game of life. That gotta go 200 more million than me. Yeah.


Sorry. That's, that's hate y It is hate. So what men get to hate too sometimes. Right? That's hate a breakup. We can hate a little bit. Yeah, exactly. What that gives you the privilege to hate Mel. Man, I wanna hear for Mel. Hmm Hmm. Don't dog pal either. Okay. I agree with you to a certain extent that she re I don't understand wanting to stay like I understand the principle. Let's go fuck it man. I understand the principle of I invested all this money under the pretense that you were gonna sell me this house, but shit got acrimonious. I think he's fouled for going back on his word. I do, I do. Damn respect.


I think he's foul for going back on his word Foul. That's right. You come back in the section Oh. yeah, you would, you wouldn't have stayed. Well I'm thi Honestly I Mel would've stayed. No, She would've had no, honestly, I'm thinking if, you know, we're talking about who my current man is and how much money he has and also the fact that I just had a baby. Why would I wanna stay in a real stressful environment like that? Go man. Like that's that's what I'm thinking. Let's go man. Is why would I wanna stay in a, in an environment? That is like, That is full of strike and Contention. The Brooklyn bartender shit. Exactly. That's just my final thought on that. It is a weird principle. It is a weird he'll he'll die On fire. Yeah, exactly. Because now he's instigated like legal proceedings and this is going to get fucking messy and he's probably going to win because it was a verbal agreement and there's nothing on paper.


True. That's Not true. Okay, well Verbal agreements are legal, But if there's no recording of the verbal agreement, It's just harder to prove. But verbal agreements are illegal and binding in New Jersey. I know that for at least. But my thing is who says it's stressful? I mean it might listen, It might not be. Hey listen, She might be with the shits and she might be like, okay, this is fucking fine. She's definitely with the shit. The cops ain't gonna call nigga, when you go file the eviction, go downtown, you pay $45 for some paperwork and they bring it to your door. The cop, the cops, I'm Chilling the cops were called. They were called. The cops were called to the house and the cops couldn't do nothing. Well exactly, but I'm just saying you asked will have a good day, officer, the police showing up at your door attempt telling you that this person's filing to try to get you outta their house.


Exactly. It could be stressful, could be. I like, I like, I like Drea, but at the same time it's like she had she been through a lot of breakups, I I could assume, right? And on top of that, she should know better than to get into a situation and not have her own or not have it down on paper. She should know at some point. I'm not, I'm not disagreeing with nobody. I'm gonna say that at some point you should know better if you've been around the block. If niggas know you, you know, like you been with a nigga that's up, you break up the nigga kick you out the crib or you no longer. She might have never, she might've never experienced that. She might've been with niggas that was Ish a she might've been with niggas that was up that did what they said they was going do or after we broke up, the nigga still might have been hitting you with some little severance.


Yeah, I mean like don't act like these niggas don be true. She from the hook. come on, stop Ish she from with she's the top. She has been long removed from Philly. Understood. But what I'm saying is that she went through the steps that a lot of those girls go through. She went through the steps where a nigga take it back because she's either done with the situation. We don't know that. Yeah. This behavior Don't say that. Yeah. I'll tell you one thing. I disagree. You don't think so? If I'm her new ex, I mean if I'm her new dude, I'm her new ex. Look, look what you that her new ex, if I'm with her, she predicting it. If I'm her new dude, I'm concerned that she's spending this much energy and time fighting her ex. That would make me wonder. Either you still got something for him or are you crazy as shit? No, you are not. It, it Would concern, I mean no, you no, you could dig your heels in because, because were were 22-year-old. Shut The principal of the situation. You But if I had That and it was her because let's not get it twisted.


Yes, she dates men of high net worth, but Dre is no slouch. She has her own money. She's Not a slouch. That's what I'm saying. So she yes, she's, I don't think she's, I'm not saying that she has anywhere close to what her man, her current man has. I'm not saying that, but she has her own money broke. Her swim line is extraordinarily. Well We gotta start, we gotta start auditing y'all girls to say I had my own money. Yo, what's wrong with you son? What is wrong with you? Nothing. Ain't nothing wrong with her. Forget it. We gotta, so we gotta, she that Joseph To me, she, We already a hundred percent agreement for what's on This shit. But we have to audit them yo, because I all of that. She's got, I mean, hey, my experience has, what does she, where's she getting money from?


Survey says she has a really homie too. She has a really successful swimwear line. It's called Mint Swim. Mint swim. And It is very successful. Nice. Okay's fine. I think she has like a couple of other companies, but she shout The Dre, she's not a slouch. You know what I'm saying? So little bit further, the, the judge in this case ruled that the verbal agreement was unenforceable. Gotcha. But allowed her to seek reimbursement for the $270,000. That's all I'm saying. Give it 270,000. If you that rich give it two 70,000, seek it as you pack. But I think that she would leave if he fucking reimbursed her. Look, This seems like easy problem leave regardless, you gonna leave, you leave On my own time because the eviction process takes like about six to fucking nine months.


So It depend on where you at. But you can get out. The only reason why, the only reason why she didn't get evicted this time is because she she wasn't served. Yeah, she wasn't there closed herself. Man. That's it. She wasn't served. It seems like this from what I'm reading here. It seems like she's gonna be getting, she's gonna be getting outta here just now. It is, It is a pattern of who the nanny was there wasn't there. Okay. She was never served. I didn't get any, any record of this filing or nothing like that. So we don't have a court. But the process is lengthy. Hey, when I say ice closes out, I mean like it's the end of it All. Right, fine. Because I've been through it. So in, in California you squatted? No, I was not the squatter. I had to serve somebody. God damnit.


So then I just ended up, I just wanna know If I got squatters amongst me. That's it. I mean I, I resorted to other means in order to get the motherfucker out. And on that note, we're close. If the squatter rules existed back when I was squatting then yeah you would have squatting rules and squatters amongst you. But it wasn't, the rules wasn't with us back then. I would just break some shit in the house. Hey buddy. Oh you didn't fix this yet? I cancel it look like I gotta hold this myself for a little while. What a crack as. Oh man, rough. Oh man. Oh man. All right. And other news. And other news. I do want to get to these Kendrick numbers so we could argue about 'em.


But I'm enjoying a Kendrick and Drake list pod so far. Roddy Rich homeboy got a storage unit, had a bunch of clothes and Roddy rich items including a Grammy posted it on the internet. Yes. For some strange reason. It seems Like that's his content game. Yeah. Judging by the way he was talking in the Video, his content is he goes to storage like storage wars, that shit. He goes and buys storage. He does it on you three. Cool. I think he got another phone call after he posted that 100%. 'cause his language verbiage and voice tonality, everything changed two more, two more calls. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because the first one was the offer. I'm gonna give you 50. I I'll give, I'll give you 10.


I'll give 10. He wanted 50 Grammy. Get the stuff back. I'll give you 10. And he said nah 50. Nah 50. No. First he said he wanted to ap. Gimme an ap, gimme a AP watch and then nah gimme 50. Oh you gonna get AP appropriate Pumbling. That's what the second call was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The second call was, it was real quick. So you're being nice by offering you 10 grand. Second call. Second call. The second call was Yeah second call World fast. Yeah. Hey pow. No no. Yo. You live at he said his address, his family. That's it. So then they put this second video out where he gave the Grammy back.


It is very polite. Not only was he extremely polite, he had the security there. Task force. The people that worked in the building, it was at the police station was Yeah it looked like the police station. Yeah they Were at the police station. I think he said What a pussy had his phone out. Hey I just want y'all to know that it's, look, I gave it back. Said one piece piece. Nothing's been done with it. Here, here you go. And they shook 'em up. Yeah. What about them clothes? The Roddy want the clothes. He was like, no no, nobody said nothing about the clothes. I just brought the Grammy down. I only, I only had the Grammy. Please just said one please, please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Wow. So yeah Yo, most of you content niggas be pussy man. I ain't gonna lie. I ain't gonna lie.


Bring back the days of game. Chasing my man down with the camera in one hand. Whooping as with the and beating ass with all nigga is fucking chunks and narrate. That was all you niggas want to do is walk in the CBS and lean over some muscle bound nigga to get something. I saw that. Yeah. Then when he him yours, it's a prank. It's a prank. It's prank. It's a prank. It is, yo, everybody ain't on your prank rules nigga. They was just bitch ass nigga. They was just shooting in one of them shits. Nigga jumped out the car. He had a banger on him. He was like what? And this man was over there with the camera. He like, yo bro, put that fucking bop bop. Put the fucking camera down. Like everybody ain with prank. Everybody not playing that shit nigga. Hey you niggas need to go to karate class.


Nah, for real. Y'all just playing around out there. That shit Donna. Shit ain't no joke. It is crazy. It is crazy. come on Dre. I mean do we have a take on this? I mean there's no takes, no takes on this. Not really Shouty Roddy Rich friend of the show, he got shout to Roddy. He got, he got his Grammy back and shout to Storage Wars. It's a Great show. And shout out the niggas that could get their Grammy back. Yeah, yeah. Got that cleared up quick, fast. And the niggas that get got their chains back, Hey some of y'all got your chain, your chain back man. What they had to pay went on a quick little one city tour. Are you gonna, are you gonna pay for the chain? What do you do in that instance? Depending on how much It is.


I pay for it. You paid a quarter million for your chain. Yeah, I paid to get it back. Niggas court. Yeah. Niggas one 50 on the walk. Send 50 cran right now. We'll bring the chain back. So I mean well sometimes it depends. I'm asking situation Church, I just make dangerous situations. Yeah. It depends on who took the chain. Who It is. Like it depends on your image. Yeah, it depends. Yeah. What nigga It is saying you tough. Y'all crazy, you tough. Y'all have insurance on this chain. No, no, no. I got insurance. I'm, I'm talking about all that to these rap nigga you got insurance on your chain, it's not your rep. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Not just that. If you got insurance on the chain, still gonna take Yeah. Whatcha you talking about? I'm gonna pay the, they gonna pay me out the claim. If I paid two 50 for the chain, of course I got the appraiser to say it's worth 300.


Of course. So now they gonna gimme my $300, 300,000 and I could go buy my chain back from a nigga for 50. Where's the loss? Good plan. True. That might be insurance fraud. Dude. Not really prove it that I Got it back from Kit Ka. I mean Fuck, that chain. A lot of niggas pay conspicuous. Lot niggas be up here just lying man. A lot of niggas pay for they, I ain't talking about the hit that your reputation takes and, and and what happens? What's when a nigga sells you your chain back, they may not ever tell any fucking way. No, it already went online. The internet know already everybody knows how they know. Yeah nigga. But how they know you bought it back. I'm not buying my chain back. You know what niggas do when they get your chain? Hell yeah. They go right on there and start put they video up and all that.


My question was how do they know you ain't just go buy another chain versus buying it back to the nigga? Because homeboy still has the chain. Yeah they don't Joe. It's some street nigga that's nondescript nobody or ain't like he popping on the social. He's popping because has chain media. That's why he's popping bro. Shit up your chain is the only reason he's popping on dog. He gonna, he gonna post This shit on socials and start tagging blogs and shit. World Star and somebody's gonna pick it up and it's going to go this rest in peace every time. Got it Now what? So now that that goes on for a week or two, I buy my chain back two weeks later. That guy ain't no social media darling. That story goes away.


I got my chain, I got some insurance money back. That's the only reason it went away. Why could you pay to get it back? No. Or even if paid you Got it back even if you didn't pay to get it back. Not nobody gonna keep watching that shit for months and months and months. It's not concept some nigga. Yeah. But your career changes. Some nigga. And some nigga, depending on who you are, you career change depending on your, is gonna change regardless. Bro. That's that's not true. That's not true. All y'all not being realistic. Y'all saying that. What's, what's the solution? Gotta track down and get your chain back without no money. I'm gonna give you example. The y the YBN dude, the one that got his chain snatched in the Bronx and, and they and they cut him for it. The one that Jay Prince was called and they called Jay Prince. They called Jay Prince his, again, it depends on the image you're putting out because he wasn't putting out that type of image.


It, it, it, it was okay for Jay Prince to go get the chain back. For him it was okay for these things. He didn't really take a hit. Now if you one of them dudes who walk around like it can't happen to me. I'm the toughest nigga in America. That type of thing. And they get your chain. Now you're taking a hit. So now's control. So how do you handle it at certain it's damage control. Niggas try to reach out right away before the nigga could go live so I could buy my shit back. So it stays quiet. Yeah. And nobody knows it's happening. Yeah. You right. And it happens a lot too. Yeah. And a lot. Yeah. You have the other side of that of of you know, if you friend of the show, a lot of nigga you get the other side of that friend of the show not trying to take a shot at him. But what happened with Berg when they took the transformer chain? That be, that's still a punchline in hip hop today.


Got you. That damaged him so bad that he changed his name and he had to go do a whole one of the biggest and best rebrands that exists. Shout to Berg. But so it can, it can, you know what I'm saying? It can, it can hurt you depending on it happens a lot. Yeah. Like Park said, a lot of niggas buy their chain back and on top of that, niggas also build a career off of robbing nigga taking their chains. So when it said it's gonna go away, it would not go away. 'cause now nigga got your chain. He's wearing it, he's doing blogs and it, so that shit lasts for about Alright, somebody close us out two months. Yeah, two months. If you want your chain back by your chain, man. I'm not buying no nigga, I'm not giving no nigga money after you just rob me. I'll take I I I'm sorry. Game is the game to something.


Niggas understand that man. The game that's part of cost. The Door State Farm. That's it. That's, that's the only motherfucker I'm calling. Y'all talking called Chris Ball about change nigga. I come from last decade when the iPhones was popping and these little goofballs used to be online at seven in the morning at the mall and boys roll right up away from walk out and five, Hey P Pew. P Pew gimme them PP gimme them iPhones. Yeah they was doing that with sneakers. Yeah. PlayStations, ps all that shit. Walking out with that bag starter jacket killing niggas in DC over Jordans And what's the other shit that the DC niggas be wearing? Foams foam positives. Yeah.


Was killing niggas. I remember when niggas getting killed over the eight ball jackets out here too. Yep. Yeah I remember that. Remember that DC claim phone But? yeah. I ain't say that The mid Midwest, the the, the Midwest niggas is trying to claim Air Force ones. Yeah I saw that. They bought out they mom, we ain't gotta talk about it. Yeah but they are trying to claim Air Air Force ones away from New York. I saw JY was killing them niggas online about it. He was okay in other news. In other news. What's this here? Kendrick Lamar has been named Person of the Year by Time Magazine. I never know the Time Magazine had a person of the year. Yeah. Yes they do. They do every year. You've always had around this time of year shout out to them. Yeah. Thank, you took yourself out the runnings.


Yeah I did. I say that I'll be, I'll be persons of the year next year. There you go. come on talk That shit Flip Fuck, that shit come on. There's nothing about me. About Kendrick. Yeah. Persons of the year after what you did. Kendrick Kendrick killing it. Time man of the year we were about to get into, he announced his tour That. is that real? Is that real? Because it's not, I don't see it nowhere else. This one It is nowhere. Okay. That seems like a stretch to me. They got mail you, you get central. We told you about communicating with fans. That's trolling man. You got caught up again. It wasn't me. Didn't you wanna come in here and say I'm well read. I'm well read But you know every once in a while something gets Slip. Get you Kendrick.


Kendrick Lamar. Let's get to some real news. Kendrick Lamar announced a tour stadium. Tour Stadium. Tour Tour. Very important. Yeah. With SS a I want to hit the round of applause button and then I want to toss the ice to tell me why that distinction is so important to make. Let's hit the applause button for Mr. Kendrick Lamar. Absolutely. We gave y'all 90 minutes of Kendrick and Drake free content, but we here now it's time to get to, it's time to get to the moneymaker, man. Yeah, we hit now. Alright. Why, why is that an important distinction to make for you? Well, one, it's not many rappers that can do a stadium tour, even with support. Like it's, it's, that's a very short list.


It is, It is a different world from an arena tour. So just the fact that he's pulled off a stadium tour is commendable. It's, it's a very, very, very short list. Eminem, Travis Scott, Beyonce, rapper, I'm rappers, he's not a rapper. Rapper. Rappers Drake, Kanye Drake can't do a stadium tour. Really? Yes. Really? I mean, why do you think that? Not discounting right now, but No. Period. Why? Why hasn't he done one? That don't mean he can't? 'cause he didn't. Yeah. You kind of can't. You can if you can But. yeah. 'cause of the money. I just thought he could, I I I thought Drake was the kind of the bottom, like the dog. Jay-Z can't do a stadium tour. That's true.


That's true. Rappers. It's hard. Kendrick. You see, he had to go, you have Eminem did a stadium tour with Rihanna. When you, again, stadium seats are different. We talk about an arena that holds 18, 17, 18,000 to a stadium depending on how the stage is done. Anywhere from 50 to 80,000 people. That's crazy. Hmm. It's, it's, it's, it's apples and oranges. So when somebody say Stadium tour, it's a big deal. So it's like a 2021 City stadium tour next year. How did it predict that he will sell out the stadium tour? How do, what do they gauge this off of?


Because he could just do the tour and, I mean, that said Scissor, right? He said he was doing it with Scissor. Yeah, but how, how do we know that he's going to put as in seats? Well, if they didn't think he wouldn't put as in seats, they would've had 'em at an arena tour. They wouldn't have took it up. They would've took it up to Stadium. It's a, it's a projection. They're projecting that. Yeah. That's any, any tour? All tour is projection. All, yeah, all towards projection. I know I Got it. I Got it. How many tour dates is it 21? 21? Something like that. I'm not gonna say that. Drake is not, what are we talking about? Stadium? Stadium Tours. Stadium Act. Let's deal with facts. He hasn't done one yet. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's where I would be if the nigga did six shows straight at Madison Square Garden.


Yeah. I don't know what it looks like if he tries to do a stadium tour, one and two. I don't know that he's just trying to circumvent the fees that come along with Stadium tours. I don't know. Again, above my pay grade. But It is a flex that Kendrick is doing stadium tours one and doing the stadium in Toronto. June 12th. June 12th. The biggest venue in Toronto that Drake has never done. The The Rogers Center. The Rogers Center. What's that? Where the Argonauts play. Who the hell, the Argon. You were fucking arguing man. Who the fuck is That is hell this you gotta flex on us.


Is that where Lou Mel don't know what the argument is? No, that's, that's where the Raptors play. You speak. No it's not. No, no. You just speak girl. Yo be my girl. It is my girl. You just have been blending in your whole, your whole life. Just who the fuck plays there? One of fucking chameleon. The Toronto Blue Jays play there. Oh, gotcha. Really? Yes. That's what, that's the Roger seven smack. Kemp never played for the Toronto Blue Jays. That was great. Drink shit. Girl, go ahead. Don't give a fuck. I don't care. I thought they replaced. Okay, nevermind.


What do we think that's gonna be anything? I'm sick of it. I want to go back to talking about Kendrick with Kendrick and Drake. With Drake. I'm tied of the conversation. Intermingling now everything's gotta be related. You know what I mean. It's over. And then that brings in Stan culture from both sides, which I'm sick of. I'm just sick of that same, I'm very tired of the staying. Now, mind you, if y'all, if it's gonna stay like that, then I'm down. It's staying bro. It's staying like that. This is, yeah, it's gonna be big. And Pac Jay and Nas to an extent. Yeah. Yeah. They're married at this point. This is way worse than Hovan Nas. No, but I'm just saying in terms of we have the internet then You. right. You can't have say one name without the other being born. This might be the worst one ever. Internet the time is the Stan culture.


Well, second I got Biggie and Bach first. Obvious they both died. Yes. Yeah. But it's one B. Yeah, I, I think, think when, when, when Jay and Nas was going at it, they said fam niggas was leaving they jobs. I remember this niggas left they job and was sitting outside in the cars because flexing them said they had some new Jay-Z shit. Niggas was in they car. I love that shit. Remember that? Like went outside in corporate America. Me and my man sitting in the car lot, man, I was mad as hell. I was sat by the radio for super ugly Bird. I was mad about it because they promoted it like it was a new song. Yo. He gay win the studio. They did a new song. They said Irv Gotti produced it like they was just bigging it up and it was like, or somebody huge produced it.


It was like word the internet nigga talking about it was a mix tape. Kendrick had all Kendrick had all 'em gang members on stage and Drake shout it. Steve Lacey. Yeah. Smart. Yeah. How we know Steve Lacey and a gang member? I listen from the eye test. He took appeared be easy talking. I thought knew, I thought you knew I wanted you. Do you want me Shout to Steve Lacey? Man, Steve Lac is fine. Nigga made a fucking get some nigga to suck my dick. Anthem. Yo. What the fuck is wrong with you? What he did? You think that niggas don't want Anthems? It ain't just us.


They looking for some, they looking for they slap when they trying to bag This shit. Drop watch me do my stuff them nigga. Alright. Forget it man. What show y'all going to Jersey? I I wanna hit one of these LA shows. Man. I want to hit one of these j Cole niggas. Hey. Hey Cole. What's up man? come on or let us in. You See they had 150,000 people in queue for the tickets I saw. Yeah. I wasn't in there. But It didn't get you to pocket watching a little bit on Secondary Oh Shit.


Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Because I, in order to get the, I got season tickets To the Knicks. Oh, you might get a little special pass. I get Perks. But the, the, the tickets in the Knick game. The tickets were available to people that subscribed to the podcast. I thought that you would have pocket watched. I I don't. I pocket watched different from y'all. Oh, okay. I stop once people get to a certain level and then start just trying to ask the questions of how j Cole is past the point of pocket watch and you can't pocket watch him. True. It's gone. Yeah, it's gone already. He's outta here. He's way outta here. I gotta see Pockets doing some numbers for him though. That's all I'm saying. He's smoking that shit. Yeah, it's great. It's a great listen.


And you know what he reminded people of and we'll get back to Kendrick in a second. He said he's just the most likable dude. Yeah, he's most relatable. He's the Parks. The fucking big three S a good one. I'll take it. What a Great way to remind people that I'm likable. I just didn't want dude didn didn't want to do that. That ain't me. If y'all killing me for it, fine. But I'm never gonna speak on it. I'm just going go on with my life. It is so North Carolina of I, he Taught, he taught whole to not order steaks. Well done. Apparently he said that. Yes, If Jay-Z was ordering steaks well done, I'll never look at him the same. Me either. Apparently he was At the time he met, met Cole, he was cold. Told him not to. Cole might be lying on Hove baby. Don't lie on Hove Cole don't do that.


Cole might be trying to get his shit off. We don't know the nature of that relationship. Eat that red shit bro. Like come on. Actually everybody does be bread Jay. Shit. If Jay-Z Jay-Z's still a Brooklyn nigga Carter, he's still a Brooklyn nigga. He ain't eating no Sean Carter. No he's not. He's not a what? Not anymore. He's a billionaire. Hez Brooklyn nigga the heart man. I ain't even know he ate meat still. Jay-Z calling me. I mean this was years ago. Yeah, I think It is. Yeah, this is before he hired the chef to take care of his diet. Crazy. I refuse to believe at the time he met j Cole, he was still eating steak. don, you can't eat your steak like that. Right. He said Yo, you made how much money you can't eat that kind of steak no more.


But everything well done nigga. What are we talking about buddy? But Then he started getting medium rare. Apparently He learned. He learned. Right. This shit is disgusting. It's uncivilized. It is eating, the blood is civilized. That's not blood. You saying That is uncivilized. The taste of it, the taste of It is I just had seen niggas eat rare steak. It's not blood. It's not blood. You do medium or medium rare. It's not blood. So what is it? The steak I had, it's not blood, it's just pink. Don't say that no more. It is not. Yeah, it's just pink. Just say you like your shit. How you like it? Yo listen. Yeah. Y'all like tires. That's cool nigga. We ain't matter. And Puerto Rico, I tried it. That shit's disgusting. That taste is nasty.


Disgusting. The taste of It is nasty. Did you put ketchup on it? No. Just tastes nasty. Some shit like Miracle Whip, right Mustard. Some just obscure and ob obnoxious barbecue sauce. I don't need to do that. What? That shit Peter Luger. I don't need to do that. I'm just saying like well done is what is what It is. A lot of niggas eat well done. That's it. Yeah, they, they you they mature. Yeah, you speak, you get your own audience to this audience. That's why I like you. So no, I hate what niggas get you speaking to. Like I just hate that man. Like nigga like It is okay, well done. State. Wow. It's a combination of water and myoglobin if you want to.


Yeah, we good. Not blood. Not blood, not blood. Ish. It's okay. Oh man. Thank, you Ish piss of Ish off these niggas. It is crazy. I ain't gonna say nothing. Y'all Got it. Cole also said that, that he was at one of the functions, him and Eve and Future and Drake was there and they're really close. So they all got together and they was talking, having a good old time, exchanging jokes, laughing and shit. Having a time of they lives. Sure. And then Hove got there and he seen them all together and he walked over to them and he was like, oh give him one. Talking about Drake should give Cole a hit and then he walked off and left.


So disrespectful. Yo. Who's a asshole bro? Hilarious. That's funny. Yeah man, that ain't foul though. That's, that's fo, that's foul. Of course it's fos foul. Cole hadn't had a hit yet. That was part of the problem with, they were still trying to find that one hit. Yeah, exactly. J give him one yo. Give him one then leave. Yeah nigga, I ain't even talking to you niggas. Yo, give him one. Did you listen to the episode with all the No Id beats that he ra on that he didn't use Tears of Joy was the j Cole song Stay by Nas was the j Cole song. There's another one too. I think it was a Luda record or something around that time. If he had tears of joy. What happened? He Rapped on it. He played It and what happened? It wasn't tears of joy, but it was still fire.


How did he lose it? He didn't want it. He Didn't, he he didn't pick it. He said that at the time he didn't really, he made all his own beats I guess at the time. And his manager, whatever. I don't think it was Ebo, it was someone else. I think it was Mark Pitts actually said, you know, if you want these beats you gotta pay. No, ID shout To Mark Pitts shout out to no Id. And he was like, oh, I didn't realize I had to do that. And he didn't wanna pull a trigger on nothing yet. 'cause he was still looking for the hits like we just said. And he didn't think those songs were hits necessarily. I heard about that, that that EP they were talking about putting out with Kendrick. Him. Oh, big Sean. And I think was Meek. Hold on. I'm sorry. I don't remember. I didn didn't get, maybe I didn't get to that episode. While you, while you do that, Hove is very blunt.


He is very to the point. Yeah. Meek Mill and Big Sean and J Cole and maybe has some sociopathic tendencies that nobody knows about. I don't know. Just amazing sarcasm. And this was even before, is it sarcasm? No. If I really want, no, but like I remember one time it was Howard Homecoming, this was before he was like, Jay-Z and they was at this spot and, and and it was like some hood shit. Howard Homecoming drug dealer convention. And and he walked up to the, the, the, the security dudes and the manager and was like, yo, who, who's the manager here? And he was like, yeah, I just want to ask a question about security. And he is like, oh, oh yeah, I'm the manager. He is like, I just want to be clear.


You're doing a horrible job. Like horrible, horrible job and just walked away. And it was just like me and my man was sitting there like, yo this nigga is nuts. Like yo you mean it But who says that? I appreciate it. I tell the story very direct. Yo I respect the blunt. I tell the so what story yo Tommy get him one yo. Yeah. The so what story? I tell the so what story all the time up here It was life changing. What's the so what story when he fucking, 'cause I don't wanna say he dis me 'cause maybe he didn't and he might be listening. When he utilized my first single beat said things that could sound like it was a dis called and asked me if he could use it on the mix tape.


Not him personally, his people. And then years later when the first iteration, second iteration of the podcast was going, we saw him at one of the, I wanna say one of the Henny Palous, one of them Douce Pale Palous joint. We saw him at Webster and we approached him and we was like, Yeah man that fucking the the dis You know what I mean when you took my beat, my biggest single, he like changed the whole trajectory my career. He was like so what? And we all had a big laugh and that was it. But I went home and internalized it. So what made you a better person? I think so because at the end of the day he's right.


And no that's your view on shit now. Well my view on shit before, I just didn't feel good when it was done to me. Yeah. Buddy's right. This nigga is crazy. So what, who gives a what? What happened? Yeah. Right. I left D and was like that guy's fuck him. Fuck him. I mean retired at that point. So it don't matter but it's just how you say sir? He don't give a fuck. He don't care. Yeah, he don't give a fuck. Gimme that beef fool. Was he wrong? No. To say that to Drake while Drake is next to, and Drake had given him, Drake was Drake and Drake had given him.


Can I hit it in the In the morning? Yeah, in the morning. That ain't one. That ain't one. That ain't what he was asking for. That ain't what Jay-Z was asking him to do. He was asking for him to give Coke. I'm all one. I'm feeling I'm on one. Yeah I gimme, I ain't felt this way since I was 18. I'm one. Yeah. Yeah. Gimme one of them some on ones hot. Gimme a on one. Yeah. Gimme a Marvin Drew anything nigga. Nigga hit it in the morning. It is one of my joints. I mean if y'all cool Jon Freestyle is my joint. If I walk over there, he didn't give one. If I walk over there and see y'all cool. And he the hit maker. Oh Shit. Y'all yo. Give him one. One. Yeah. Give him one. He needed one. Look him out. That's your man. Oh nah.


He played the shit out of him though. No he didn't. You could have walked over like yo, why don't y'all collab man y'all put something to get Not yo give him one. And he just walk. He walk. Not nigga. Nigga walk over to the crowd. Whole problem is, I mean he is a billionaire or maybe it ain't a problem but when he was running Def Jam, that was a lot of the artist sentiment like yo dog, you are an artist so you gotta feel some of This shit. We saying like not really. Not really. I ain't an artist no more. I'm over here now. I really don't have to feel none of This shit. I don't feel none of that shit. Y'all saying 'cause I'm over here. No. And I didn't come in like y'all are. Y'all are didn't come in like I come like y'all. I was never where you was at. I want to not speak so much for ho. I wanna focus on Cole and then we'll get back to Kendrick.


The competitor in Cole is supposed to feel away. It is supposed, he's supposed to feel a way. Don't do that to me in front of him. That's my peer. Right? Yeah. Your son. That's my, that's my classmate. I agree. We came in at the same time. That don't make us peers. Well we also do different shit though. So I No, tell me privately I'm signed to you You. right. Tell me privately to ask. I should use my artist to artist relationship. Relationship to try to get a joint. Don't embarrass me in front of the dude early in the career. Exactly. How would you I disagree. Welcome here. We could just be cool enough where yo nigga, that's your man. Help your man out nigga.


That's how We talk in the hood. I don't think Cole felt We not in the hood. We not in the hood. We still use Hood. Hood. We, we in trillion dollar business. I know. And we all come from the bottom and so we have a rapport out. I'm done with that one too. I'm done with, we all come from the bottom. Everybody come from the bottom. Everybody in that equation didn't come from the bottom. Drake didn't. The bottom can't be something that's subjective. We come from the bottom. Don't do that in front. A front of a lot of people say we didn't come from the bottom. Nobody says that. That's not true. Who says that? What's the your mother. If my mother gets to talking about her origins and how I came to be on this earth, it's the bottom.


I'm talking about you. You said we all come from the bottom. Your mother would beg you. The fact that I didn't come from the bottom is a testament to what my mother did from the bottom. That's what I said. You said we all come from the bottom. You included yourself. And I'm saying that that's relative. 'cause some niggas that didn't have no house and no heat and no food, they bottom will say, yo nigga you didn't come from the bottom. You always had a refrigerator. But you don't know what the bottom is. I no I don't like him. That's the truth. Honestly. Because that makes, that's the truth. No, because you make sense in like reasonable ideal circumstances. And I've known you long enough to know that you wouldn't respond that way.


If you make songs and your best friend or your one of your better friends in hip hop is slapping them out the park. Even if you felt like you needed one, you would not want the head of your label to do that to you and in public wouldn't. Not in, no, it depends on the report that I have with the head of the label. Clearly if I look at the head of the label, like he's my cole some type of way. My big brother. Yeah. Cole felt some type of way. He is telling us that's why he's telling the story. That's, it's just a funny story and I'm a podcaster now and I know it's gonna be compelling content. It ain't funny 'cause he never gave me one. It ain't funny 'cause he never attempted to gimme one and and outside of that there was rumors of a circum. There was rumors of a cold. No you did not. How didn't he? He's labeled as the big three. He's rich now.


No, he is labeled as three. Alright. And for some people that's content with him. It seems like he's content with that. Cole keep telling you he don't want number one. He's, he seems to be content with that in terms of what that big three shit means. He's saying that today. Today back then workout plan happened. Yeah. That other record that my shit I Love it can't get whatever that shit is. I love that. Can't get enough. I love Can't get enough. I absolutely love can't get enough. But he don't make that if he's not trying to get one. He was trying to get one. He the whole, he was trying get one the be four episodes of the podcast is talking about him trying to get one. Yo yo that's that. But that could also be yo everybody that come in from that could be the label making me do that back then being established myself.


I hate to break it to you. You have, if you're going through the major label system, you have to succumb to that relationship. Yeah. Listen, it's in the podcast. You guys haven't listened to it. So I'm gonna try to, I'm gonna try to, I'm Gonna try to, I'm not sum it up, but he was having conversations with Hove and other people in the industry and he was on some, no, I wanna just make a classic record. I don't care about hits. I'll do that later. But then he would go to parties and see, or I think he was talking about he went to see a Hove tour or something like that and saw all these records and he was like, oh no shit I do want a hit. Right. I need to find a hit. Yeah. And so he spent the next fucking however many years trying to get a hit. He don't become who he's become without beating the hit game. He beat it. He did beat it. He made enough to go where he was trying to go but Drake never gave him one.


I don't know that they ever tried to make one but shit, I'm carrying that professionally and personally. If it's me, if it's me, I'm not hugging niggas on stage. I'm not doing all of that. Depending on who Cole is. Jay-Z's comment could have been why I don't even want to try to get one from him now don't tell me that public now I'm gonna go do it or I make outta my way. You might have tried to gimme something and I didn't like him. You might have gave me some sure five shit like we hear all the time. Like you just said, he had this beat, he had that beat, he had this, he had that. Drake might have sent him some shit like yo, I want you on this. I think it, eh, alright fuck it. Let me go get such and such and put him on it now. Or it could just be, I'm not about to have it could, I'm not about to have my success attached to my peer like that.


Yeah, I understand. No I don't want to hit from him. I'm gonna get there on my own. It might take me longer. I might not reach that peak. But you are not gonna be able to say you only got here 'cause he did it. Right. No, true. I'll take that. It could be the also, it's still nice to have a a line to us. One of the greatest hit makers of all time while he's doing hits for other people and try to get one. Well he still, I mean shit. He still got the line to him. No. Well they Got the hit. What's the hit? First Person shooter went number one. Oh yeah. That ain't it. That's about to say man, that ain't one. It's technically, it's technically a hit. It is by definition of hit.


It is a hit on whose album? Onm Drake's album. You. right. Give me one please. Please. I don't want it. I don't or I don't want it. I'm the only nigga that ever said I, I'm the only nigga that ever said that. You keep your hook. Okay. Idiot. Stupid. That's dumb. Wait a hook from Drake? Yes. You gave back a Drake Hook? No, I never received a Drake hook. Oh. Oh, okay, okay. Like because you didn't want it. I didn't want it. I feel like it's something missing story. It is not making consistent. Why didn't you want it? It's not the type of record I wanted to make with him. I wanted him to tap in his rap bag. You want in didn didn't want to hit. I wasn't chasing hits at that point in my career.


My career was rap shit. So if I get with the certified Hitmaker, I want to put him in my world. I wanna rap. Like rap. The second you get to LA then it's gonna make it look like it's something that I didn't want it to be stupid. Stupid For sure. Or Jacob. Why couldn't Cole JCO could have had the same sentiment. Yeah. Stupid or not. Look at where he landed. Stupid Cole sounds. That's it. Nobody's turned down a hit. Just like he said about money. I said that if the dude sends me the record with the hook on it, I'm gonna go. I might keep it, I'm gonna go.


Because then you look at it later. Well then you look at it. I also caught him before his entire run too though. I caught him twice. I caught him twice. I caught him right off comeback season of MySpace days when me and you was Yayy ya. And then I called him at Bernice Bergos birthday party in stocks. I was there too after he was You was with me. What happened to us? Thank you at? At where Yo Yo where, where did it James? He's right there. He's right there bro. He's not there no more. He not no more like a white girl that came between. Yo, come on man. No I say that.


I don't do that. I'm coming know that that does you think it's him? Yeah. It is him. He just grown up. Yeah, his whole ideology changed man. Nigga matured on me, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's why I don't fuck with y'all today. You one that's immature nigga. Listen man, y'all are right. What's for what It is what It is to be and what's for you is It is for you and will be for you no matter what. So they all But you didn't say the second time you caught 'em, you caught 'em at Bernice. And what happened? That was the conversation I'm talking about when I was like, I don't want the hook. I don't want to hit, I don't want none of that. Just rap. What did he say? Well he the one that offered it. Yeah man man lemme do the hook too man.


All that phony nigga shit that nigga be doing. Got you. Hey yo. Then I went to the producer. I was like, we got why we outta here. He ain Never said why would I'm saying you solid. Hold on. Listen. You don't want my That's how he did Cole. He did Cole and Joe. But the same. Well not really. You got a Joie freestyle. Oh do you think, I'm sorry. No, go ahead again. I was just Do you think Drake's narrative is that you that you'd be hard on him because you didn't get the hook? Maybe I I just don't think it's That is It is. I don't, it's because of the hook mark. I don't think that's what It is. I'm just wonder I don't got hook question mark. I don't think it has nothing to do with it that I think, I think he, Drake might think Joe was hard on him because he, like he said in in the war record, he became It is outta jealousy.


You think it, it's pure jealousy. Like I'm better than you. I rap better than you. Like basically who you are It is, It is almost like Joe's DNA is in him. Pause. Whoa. Yeah, I paused it. That's fair. Just in terms of the type of rapper type of rap styles that he does, yet Drake has achieved a level of success in rap that Joe never touched. I see. So he might look at it as, yo, you're just envious. It's what people say. And South Star achieved a level of success. Did Joe never touched It is a long nigga. Cool watch. Don't talk about them niggas like that. It's kind of, it's kind of the ll cool J thing. Tell me what You think it is going on. Tell me what your think is going make it look. You think because I you a rap nigga, you think that Drake rap better than him?


No. You don't think Drake rap better than Joe just rap. No rapping better We. talk about the hooks and all we talking Don't think he rap better than Joe button. Okay. We trying to go to shit. Hold on. Check, check out check check out. Because aint write me down man. Ain't write me down. I'm getting outta this. You wanna just have a flag for I'm getting, I'm getting outta this. Yeah, I'm gonna ask you a question 'cause you, you are historian when it comes I am not. Stop saying that. I'm almost done. To your knowledge, to your, to your knowledge. Because when I do my research, I see that, you know, Drake saw the nigga, he looked up to the nigga, he said all This shit. And I'm like, damn nigga Joe was really that nigga at one point in my head, You know what I mean during my nigga during my assessment. Damn high school was the man.


Right? From your perspective, like where did you see it? Where did I fall off? Fall off. You didn't fall off. Where did it go downhill? No, I fell off between them. Not that rant. It's okay. You can say views, rant that rant views, views, rant. So, but then get the end. That means Joe, that means Joe would be the one that would be in the wrong. Right. Because depends on how you look at it. If Joe, if you, if you, if if you look at Joe as, yo you my man, you cool, I I gave you all this credit. I I followed my style after you at some point in my career. I said it and then Joe goes on. It's like if you look up to and Joe goes on and shits on his album or whatever Joe did then Drake has every right to feel the way he feels and to act funny to Joe because Joe wouldn't like if somebody did that to him, a nigga that you could u unless we are actually putting more salt, putting ketchup on the spaghetti sauce by saying they're more cooler than we think they are.


Yo, life gets a lot easier once you learn it. Everybody's right. Yes. Saying we all gonna pretend ketchup on a spaghetti sauce makes sense. Just because, because because it's tomato sauce. Right? So you you, you wouldn't put ketchup on spaghetti sauce. So it's It is, It is just a, it's saying Got it just saying. Yeah, you wouldn't put ketchup with cousin and cousin It is good soup. Yeah, cousin. Yeah, that's what they said. I'm so cool bro. But then Joe. Joe, yeah I just wanted to put together because I know you'll tell me. Nah, like I said, the views rant is where it went left. If you ask me, I think at one point Drake absolutely looked up to Joe and then when the person you look up to shits on you or shits on your, your, your product, your craft, whatever. It is something that you put your hard work into.


It's like damn dog, you you but what but what You all right And now you start to rationalize, okay well why are you shitting on me? Oh right. It's because you wish you got here But. yeah, that's that's why I asked you that question. But usually when niggas do that, It is like, what if he had proof that Joe probably tried to reach out to him beforehand? 'cause you know niggas, we only respond to negativity. Right? Joe could have been reaching out to the nigga like, yo, what's up, how you doing? Nigga could have just not been responding or Joe could have been trying to, yo, let's let's sit down and have a conversation. But as soon as Joe do the views rant, now nigga want to pay attention as far as well the other side of that. The other side. Well once the views ran happen, I'm not rapping no more. That and the other side to It is, but you could've did an interview with him though Joe.


But look, once I retired and got to Podding, didn didn't give a fuck about none of that. Oh so so you left your friendship with him in hip hop? I'm so don't say friendship. Sorry. I kept saying it was you don't say friendship so I apologize rapport. Once I retired I couldn't do this gig the way I'm supposed to do this gig. If I was still trying to maintain industry relationship. Right. Got it relationship Got it. I was no longer trying to do that. So now some people will look at it like, yo, you a phony ass nigga. There's people today that look at me like a phony ass nigga because I'll see him offset said that shit off a couple weeks ago. Yo, this nigga's man fly when you talk to him and then he get on that pod and say some shit. Yeah. Right. Yeah. No facts.


The end you still rap Views came up by the way technically. Well the views right came up. Really? Yeah, because that's when you start. Yeah. Yeah. That's when all the shit started after that. Yeah. Oh, because then he dissed you and then I kamikaze myself though. Yes. Yeah you did. I knew I was on my way out. I was done. I was done. Yeah, you just, I was done. I'm leaving with bank. This nigga with bank. This is how you, just this last question for me and close this out please. I'm sorry. Last question for me. You just genuinely felt that way. It wasn't any malicious. Like you didn't, it wasn't a situation where you reached out to the nigga before he ignored you. So now you hurt, heard the shit on him. Like it wasn't from a hurt place, it was just like, I genuinely feel like how I feel about this album. It was just from a genuine space. That was it. Well here go to the other real quick.


Wait we done alright? Yeah the main like, yo, you could praise a nigga a million times on the pod way to go. Yeah. He is only gonna hear that one time that showing. But when that one negativity piece goes viral that it gets us here. Got you. On a different particular of rappers. Yeah, well we wasn't done with Kendrick. Yeah, that's what I'm going back to. Oh thanks. There we go. When Kendrick goes to Toronto, are we expecting fireworks? Are we expecting drama? Are we expecting Drake to use his muscle to like shut down the not, not, not with him. I don't expect any of that. I expect business as usual. He gonna go, he gonna smoke that show Pless. Really? Yeah. People, I don't, I don't expect a thing to go wrong at that show.


I'm not saying It is, I'm just curious because I feel like everybody's gonna be looking at that zero. I mean That is, people are asking about it because we had what? Schoolboy Q Exactly. We had let's say Schoolboy Q and RB, singer Q. No, no, no, I'm just saying there's been TDE acts there has affiliate acts that went on tour but did not get to perform in Toronto. This is different. This is different. This is totally different dog. We are putting businesses in there that day. Yeah, we are selling alcohol this day, man. Luxury box suites. Yeah, there's a bunch of other gates that they're not letting this, this is happening. Good. Mind you, this is coming off of the Super Bowl. We not even announcing this if it can't happen happen this is happening.


But I, again, I don't think it'll be a people, I don't that that Drake would be in Toronto or say anything about it. I don't know. I think it's business as usual. Again, I just think that Kendrick, when, when he went up to that whiteboard with whoever he was there with, anything they wrote down has hit with 100% efficiency. That's what, that's what I think. And I think this, this is part of that. Everything that's happened since all of this is a part of just a great plan coming together better than you could have scripted it. I agree. I agree. Like he's put on I, I keep saying it. Every time he does something he's put on a true masterclass and just shutting the fuck up and letting the art and everything work. Like Kendrick ain't on Instagram posting nothing.


He's not subbing. He needs to, he not liking shit. He's just dropping. I drop music, I drop an album, I drop an announcement, I drop this, I drop that. I'm just working and getting out the way. Which is what sometimes we say we wish a lot of other rappers did. Like stop talking so much. Yeah. Rap and just go rap. We missed the days when rappers felt something and went and rapped about it and rap about it. Yeah. And that was that. If I have to think about Drake, it's not even in relation to Kendrick, it's scissor. Oh They do have some slaps. Is Scissor going on tour with Kendrick But you just got no Ma no matter what y'all relationship is this brings it right back to two side scissors on.


She just said it publicly, she was on a stage last, last week and was like, yo, It is TDE over everybody and That is the person that he, she said it publicly could have tapped to go on a stadium tour with. If you were to ask me that was that was the one. That's the thing when we go back to the stadium tour thing, the people that Drake would be able to get to go on a stadium tour with him, It is over with. Now it's up. Kanye, Travis, Rihanna weekend Kanye might have to If catch about a good, can you trust it? Can you trust it? You can't trust that shit. Can you trust booking a tour with Kanye today? No that shit going go, I don't think on Kelly don, I don't think he needs another yo.


There was Mason. The crowd nigga shit gonna be best nigga pointed a be he pointed a beam at me from the crowd from the, from the, from the fucking third man. Yo. Jay-Z said nigga who got a, who bringing a gun inside Madison Square Gun. No it's Notz. He who said that? Jay-Z said if the nigga pointed a gun at you, you supposed to come tap me and be like yo, that nigga over there got a gun look out you, you just knock. No he said who bringing the gun inside Madison? No, he bro the nigga said yo, you supposed to come over there and be like, yo nigga over there son. He got the Tuuli stay for over there but y'all, he said the nigga was in the upper level with the gun. I remember that from the state. Y'all old as hell. Yeah that was, that was, that was one though.


That was crazy. But But. yeah I don't, I don't see there's anybody that he could even Pop Pop X. Congratulations. Yeah I don't but I don't necessarily know if he needs another mega ball. Bad money can do stadiums by itself. Can't. If I can do stadiums by myself, I'm not partnering up with you to do a stadium tour. Fair. Although there's probably places where them together would sell more than, Is this a Live Nation thing? What country? Yes. Yes. More corporate Wars La Nate Shit eating on both of them. They on his, they on his, they on his new tour too. That Drake just announced. That's The clap album. We should've got Drake Bad Bunny missing that at that time. Oh That Would've been, I never would've hit em 10 niggas shit never went to nigga that Mia.


Shit. Nah I wouldn't Y'all let me tell you I wouldn't mind Wash the Throne too. Them $40 Hills will be spinning around in circles with a Drake Bad Bunny project. Oh man yo, we might go buy melodies just for that album. I don't release anymore. Bring that old DJ back. Go buy melodies nigga. You crazy. No we wouldn't. Romeo, Santos and did 19 shows in New York and we ain't been to one of them and it's the same effect. I went three of them shit. Parks went and had us jump. Y'all. I might be with you.

We just, your rosters there. This is funny. You ain't, your roster ain't there. Yeah you wasn't there. We just had this Friday we leave here we go to the spot. Oh wait real quick. Shouts out to Mel. Why Mel is actually fun to hang out with I didn think hey I ain't gonna lie Big man.

Mel didn't know who Romeo was. I did not. Huh. So we like what? So then we started talking about the comparison of who Romeo is versus Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny. He was Bad Bunny before Bad Bunny. That nigga was the bunny ranch still, still is. Fuck is we talking Not was not, no, was was not was.


So I I like we were trying to give a fair comparison there Imani and I trying to give a fair comparison of who Bad Bunny is in relation to who Romeo is and I'm like yo, when the DJ come we gonna make him do a Romeo set. Bad bunny is Venom to Romeo Sanchez a Spider-Man. Okay. Not mad at that. That's how I look at that. Michael, Mike and Usher, Mike, Chris Brown and all and all of this in relation to your era would be Daddy Yankee times 2 million. Mm And that's not to sleep another one. He was. Yes he was. He was another one. Hell he was that nigga and Sean Paul you took the words out and Sean Paul that Ayo and whatcha youma call it.

Where you hanging it up on your bathroom door? You can hang your robes up. I think when that broke you brought like the bolts or something. Like something. A bathroom hook. What the hook? Yeah. Wait, why would you need somebody to put a bathroom hook Joe? Stop playing my man. I like that bro. Nigga, this nigga put a hook on your bathroom. What? What did you fix in this crib? Rid her meal. I changed Oh. Shit. I changed a power vent hot water tank before. Oh that sounds, that's sounds some real shit.


That's real. Alright. Tissue. Oh brother. Some shit in the electrical panel before. Some leaky shit. Before some bathroom shit. You lived in a piece of shit. Oh. Shit. What I'm hearing is you lifting a real piece of shit. Nigga changed right? Nigga changed the hot, the hot water shit. Yeah. Yeah. Nigga power vent. For the free. For the free for the free. He's a good friend for the free ski. It wasn't, it wasn't free. You got back my adoration because he work here right? Huh? No listen, because he work here. No, this paid him in escorts. No, I'm saying I That is out.


Stupid y All are dumb. Do we care about Kendrick's? First week numbers? Three 19. Three 19. Three 19 final number? It's good. That is the internet has been ablaze with these numbers. I'm tapped out In a negative or positive way? Both. Both. Both. You got one side because it, it's nowhere near what Drake, like Drake's for all the dogs, anything like That is done. Even his surprise project of if you're reading this, it's too late. It's just not near those numbers. He's a pop star. Correct. And then you have the other side who they feel like now that the numbers were low, 'cause at first when this dropped, everybody was saying up here too, everybody was running around 400, 500, 600 just throwing crazy numbers around when it didn't hit those.


So now people are trying to, well, numbers ain't important. And it's like, so people are getting called out as being pretty much critical. So when you win in numbers, It is the numbers. Exactly. Numbers are not important when you're having a goat to goat conversation for All the dogs in four older. They were that crazy. Far off. Yeah. My question is what the point is to their point. Something to their point, which I completely understand. Not saying I agree, but I do understand had he did one copy more than for all the dogs, all the Kendrick stands would be going crazy right now. That's true, right? That is true. So the fact that said he sold the most units still for the whole 2024. He said he still sold more units than homeboy. But I think anyway Well he's Anu the the to have what, three songs at the top 100.


He killed it. He got the top five. Top five, right? Yeah. All five rec. The first five records are are his. To me, what's interesting is me and the only artists ever to have every entry in a year debut debut at number one. Yes. And he got three number ones number one album. Like there's no lost here. Yeah. No. He ain that nigga, that nigga that nigga's on. He's a escalated nigga. Different type of legendary shit. Well what does week two look like to me That's what's interesting. If the numbers dropped, that's the most important. If they dropped a 50 or a hundred, then that's different. I think he's gonna do one 50 in week two. Same. I don't have the biggest drop off. He might. Yeah. I think a lot of People, I think, again, I still think that, I think that with regards to now, if he do under a hundred then them stands got every right to come out and, and kick his back.


I don't, I don't think he's gonna do under a hundred. He ain gonna do under a hundred. I'm bro, I'm hearing like Luther is on the radio in rotation regularly now Squabble Up is still a number one record, which I think just their plan just was so dope because that was a tease song that everybody's been waiting for from the not like Us video. So people ran right to that. You put it number two on the album, like all of that shit just is genius. So I think the, the numbers are still gonna be pretty high. A little too genius for me. But that's another what's why too genius. I think it was good for the marketing. I don't think it was good for the sequencing of the album. I didn't love the sequence of the album as much as, but I understand why I was number two. Tell Bahama, do you YYY Y'all love the sequencing of the album?


No, I, I just said last night I have it Resequenced. Oh, okay. So I love the sequencing. Oh, I don't have a problem with sequencing. Last night I fired, accidentally put the two SSA records at the end. 'cause I did it by artist and it says Kendrick and csa. Yeah. And that actually flowed a little bit nicer to me. But. Yeah, it flowed much better. That's just moving one record to the end. Changing the sequencing One one song. But. yeah. I don't hate the sequencing though. I don't hate it. I just, it's, it interrupts the flow of the album. If you got energy from, that's what I'm saying, intro, then you go to squabble up and then you down to Luther, then you come back up to hey down. Then you go down to this record dodger man in a man in No Man in the Garden. Then you go up to don't know her TV off. Like it's, it's doing this.


That's what I didn't like. But don't know her like that again. Let her finish her sentence first. It's okay. Before you just jump out. No, you know, you my dog. We we good. It's we good But. yeah, yeah, yeah. Y'all must have really had fun. Yeah, we did. We had a good time. Why was Mel so fun? Yeah, she's cool. Just watching Mel. Just Chilling let's cool outside.

She's mad different. All that shit. She be saying on here is not, how is she? What she standing? She's just cool. Like she's cool. She understanding when she come in here, It is like the Pepticides have rotted up. She look at the camera, she did something. Women's rights landed on me outside.

Eric, Eric was nigga Eric was having all this fucked up. Holy shit y'all. This is a house. Love. What else is important or unimportant? Speaking of important ll Cool. J says that he believes one day the kids will wake up and realize that he is indeed the most important rapper to ever live. They won't. They will not. They won't. But he's right. He's he's, he ain't wrong. He upped it. No, he is right. He upped it. He ain't wrong. He's the first superstar. Solo superstar. He's the first rap superstar. Yeah, that's true. He's right. He ain't wrong. I just say it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't argue him on it.


Like, but I'm saying for some kid it depends on what your criteria is for important. I mean, the shit he laid out first Love song first, all that shit. Everything. He made the transition between TV and radio. He transcended the the demos. Yeah. He was doing street music and girl music. He, he invented the term goat. Yeah. He again, he TV star. He got a case for it. He was the, he was the first in the longevity. He was acceptable. He became an acceptable rapper. Yeah. Commercial. He was, he was him. I am not arguing that I, I love Cool J he saved, saved Def Jam. Yeah, absolutely saved Def Jam. He did what Magic did to the Lakers for Def Jam. Yeah. No, he's a legend. I I think LL cool J doesn't get mentioned enough.


I don't even think there's another argument. I I think there is another argument. Who, who, who, who? Tupac. And I'll tell you why you can't say that after saying Cassidy was better than Tupac last week. Okay. Alright. First of all, let me correct the record 'cause there's a lot. That's not what I said you did. That is cool. This is what I said. You think Cassy RAs better than Pac? What I said was not that he was a better rapper and Mac and cheese is bad. Mackin cheese is bad. That's just I I'll I'll die on that hill. What I was saying is you can be a great rapper and not a great lyricist. And what I was saying was, Tupac is a great rapper, but he's not among the greatest lyrics. Chuck D is a great rapper. Chuck D is a great mc, but I wouldn't call him a great lyricist. That's all I'm talking about. I was talking about Pac as a lyricist, not as a rapper. What, what is a lyricist? It's a lot of different things. What is it to you?


For me, multi slic shit, I'll have Not necessarily, I'll have this quick one minute one B one with you. 'cause That is not the biggest a deal. But what is a lyricist to you? For me, it's about, it's about, it's about rhyme schemes, complexity, vocab. It's, it's, it's also about the storytelling. It's about all those things. You know what I mean. Although when you get to the storytelling part, that feels like more like the mc than the actual lyricism of it. I was specifically talking about the complexity of his rhyme schemes. See that's that. I I think you, you a technical aspect. I don't think I'm talking, I don't think there's a right or wrong in, in this because it's subjective. I do. Well yeah, Because if if that's the case, then we gotta put RAs cast and Chino Xcel rest in peace and all these I Would say ass elite, other People as the best rappers of all time.


Sure. But but you But I don't think rest. No, no, no, no. You, you're missing my point. If They're great rappers, I'm not Disrespect. No, but you're missing my point. I'm saying being a great rapper is more than just being a great lyricist. That's my point. So I'm saying if you check off just that box lyric is great, but there's other boxes that you have to check off. RAs, cz, even Royce who I love. Right? Great lyricists. But, and but sometimes that rap rap shit isn't the only thing that makes you a good Mc Q-tip is, is one of my favorite MCs of all time. Not nearly the lyricist of Royce, but a better overall mc. That's all I'm saying. So I'm, I'm I was just saying on that one category for Tupac as a lyricist, it's not that, but he's got a great voice. He's got a great songwriter, a great storyteller. It's like 2K for slider for the, the, the slider for lyricism. You would have it a little more. That's all I'm saying. Everything else has to be still high.


Yes. It's one box. Your overall It is still high. But that one overall Tupac is a strong b plus for me. He's just not an, it's only one problem with what he's saying. What's that? With, what have you wanna tell it with rappers, lyricists, MCs, maybe all with the exception of artists because that gets into song making realities. Right. But those three, the most important thing for a lot of people is what are you sing? Yeah. Far greater than what words you can rhyme. True. How many multi syllables you use. Like we get into lyricists and we, that's what we get into. How are you rhyming? But the main thing is, what are you saying? It's A vague message.


I agree. And that's where Cassidy should never be mentioned with Tupac. He said too much. Even if he rhymed Hennessy and Enemy, which he put 19 albums. Right. What he was saying between those things, you can't even prove. But that's not different. That's not different than what I'm saying. I'm not mentioning him in the category for what he's saying. I'm only mentioning him in the category. Just you saying it takes him out of the lyricist. No, you it take him out. Ric saying lyricist conversation and he's saying no. Because the complexity of your lyrics don't matter. The content of your lyrics matter more than the complexity. Right. And what I'm saying is content for me is a different category. It is, It is why 50 cent is a top 15 rapper. Yes. But what I'm saying is mc artists, however you wanna chop it up, 50 cent can't lyricist with none of none of us.


We we're, we're, we're, we're we're. But what he said and how he said it, he's conveyed one. But y'all, y'all are putting content in the lyricism bag and saying it's all part of lyricism. I'm not. But that's your mistake. I think it's subjective. It's just my scale. Oh yeah. I said it's no wrong. I got different. So for me, Tupac at the top for, for content at the top for songwriting at the among the top for voice, all that shit. But in terms of actual lyricism, I'd say no black thought top for lyricism not as good a songwriter. Not as, not, not you. But the content piece should, content should make you unable to say that Tu that Cassidy and Hamad D are better lyricists than Tupac. So you're basically saying no, nobody could be, they couldn't be better at Tupac.


At anything. At something. Right. And I think one of 'em is having complex rhymes more, more ca even though again, overall Cassidy's a c plus. Let me ask you Tupacs and a, let me ask you a question. So you can have complex rhymes, right? Because you're taking hard words and rhyming them with other hard words. It's not just that let me No, I'm saying no, that's not my, I'm rejecting that premise. I'm not. Okay. So you have hard words rhyming with other hard words, but your message ain't shit. Like I'm all a koala while I wait with you. While I don't want to hear that shit, bro. Shit. And I want add on to that me in my heart, all of that shit is as opposed to this complex 14 sellable shit. I agree. That's why you can't just have lyrics. Wait, lemme add to what he's saying. And all that shit is new.


When we get to talking about Furious Five and Mely Mel and all of these niggas. It's what they was saying. That's it. Arguably the message is the best rap song ever in history. It is them going outside, seeing some shit and talking about that's, I wouldn't go that far about Phil what you said. But, but here's the thing. When Rakim comes along, when G rap comes along, they modernize the flow and suddenly the message was important. But also the, the mode of delivery was important. You all, you're naming two more people that said things. Yes. That's, that's why I just said message. They said this. You say, that's what I'm saying. The message was still important. And then Nas came along and they took from him and then, and then It is the evolution. Yeah. And then Nas came and said things better than them and then HOV came and said things. It's a, but you still gotta say, you have to say, I agree something.


Content for me is the most important thing. I don't know another rapper since Pac maybe that can make changes. I don't know. You think Kendrick Kendrick, you think Ken Kendrick all, maybe Ken Kendrick is what I would say maybe. But like Pac got too many of those changes moments. That's the thing. I, I love Tupac. I I really like Tupac. I gonna say I love, I really like Tupac. I think he's an extraordinary mc, top shelf elite. I just don't think when it comes to lyricism that he is among the top 30 or 40 or 50. I think he trumps everything else. It's just like, I'll give you a perfect basketball example. Athleticism is really important in basketball. True. Steph Curry's not the top 50 ale great athletes in the NBA, but he's still a top 10 player because his other skills trump the fact that he's not as athletic.


That's all I'm saying. I'm saying Pac is that he's great. That's not the thing that makes him great. It's the other things I actually like your step cur. I agree with him. 'cause that's how I feel about, I don't, I put Jeezy in this. Yeah. A perfect example. I love fucking Jesus. That's my favorite ever. And I'm quick to say he ain't the most lyrical fuck up. He'll tell you he's not the most lyrical. Same thing. Pop not It is what he's saying. And, and relatability. That's a difference. That's my point stat. I'd rather listen to Jeezy than a whole bunch of lyrical motherfuckers. Same. Now that's just disrespectful. Why? I like the song Get the patrol and Jeezy is another one that was saying something. Absolutely. Yeah. Like I don't, that's what I'm saying. I don't see y'all, I think we going around the circles.


Yes. Don't see how you can say somebody is not lyrical. That is saying, conveying a message or conveying some shit that niggas want to hear and they like the way they saying it because I'm think about it. That's a part of lyricism and that's not, and I'm saying I divide the categories differently. For me, I'm, I'm I'm thinking about purely from a technical perspective. Got it. That's all I'm saying. Got it. Got it Got it. That's peace. I hate you. I hate so much. Some days just I love you. I really look forward to the days you come in man. Thank you. I appreciate that. I do. I enjoy coming. We all do ball. I just still hate y'all by this fun. We all, we, we all do nigga.


Because you know what It is, nigga tell the how you nigga we all do Dan, you all I can hear This shit from one of these young whipper snaps. You old good. I I'm, I'm old. I I acknowledge it. Yeah. I I'm old talking shit. Nah, I'm still right. But You know what I mean. You ain't you terribly wrong. Internet be gassing This shit. Now I I get like 50 tweets now. Mark said Cassie's greatest rapper of all time. It is like, they want hear It is cool. Well I mean they're still on. Your whole men can have babies thing, which is the dumbest shit ever. That trumps all the other shit because people again, people want to hear what they want hear. I was a hundred percent right on that too. It's just people want to hear what they want to hear. I didn't, I didn't look for the truth. I was just clowning. Yeah, we were talking about trans men. It was a conversation about trans men. She said can men have babies? I said, yeah, trans men can have babies.


And because people don't actually know what trans men are and they think that means men with penises, people born with penises, they think I'm saying that everyone in this room can have a baby when it's actually the opposite. I'm saying that if male with male right now were to become, I understand what you're saying. A trans identify as a man. She could still do whatever she could do before she became a man. Unless she makes a has surgery. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. That totally makes sense. Fuck this guy. I how do you do this? How do you No, I feel that I let him, let him let him. Yeah. Got it. I was right. But that's the real you right in my book. But no matter what I, if I be like that nigga still think men could have babies. That's a realm that we don't want to even y'all still don't think he's ostentatious. He's not ostentatious This shit.


He walking, he walk in the party, walk right to the fruit punch and say, Hey don, that's not ostentatious. Yo. If me pulling my laptop out the strip club It is ostentation. That's fucking ostentation. But it's fine. Pull your strip club, pull your laptop out. The strip club is wild. It is ostentatious. Oh it's totally ostentatious. It is, it's it's surreptitiously ostentatious. Right. You are actually Oh Shit added words. Pancake. I love ity. Surreptitious. It's the shit you do to make it look like you not surreptitiously. What does that mean ma'am? It is surreptitiously what That I don't know what that means. Kind of sauce. I'm asking Mel is well read, wordsmith what kind of syrup?

He just asked for everybody to pray for him. And, and I love Randy But. Yeah. We also another, he also said another message within that message he implored that all men go and get your screenings.

No Corey, you don't mind me telling this right? Yeah, he he he doesn't want to get a prostate check 'cause he doesn't wanna get a prostate check. He doesn't want the doctor to do the the digital check. You get the Halle Berry s right. You know what I mean. Hall berry nowadays they start with your blood.

But what I'm saying, I'm not a, I'm gonna get my prostate checked because of the concerns y'all saying. But once a year It is just, it's just when I'm ready You know what I mean.

I don't know if Malcolm on Ice is coming back to yo but staying against some lobster tails or some shit that's going on man. Do you think that any wo woman or any of the women that you dealt with before, do you think that they get they I don't even remember nobody on. Now listen, this is what I'm about to ask you. It's a great fucking answer you guys. Nigga don't have no listen, you did. That hurts.


You did that hurt because they see how you and Sade is they see how much you know how you guys over. They don't see it. 'cause I'm not, not ostentatious, overcame whatever you overcame but this but this summer I'm dropping Lex off in Ferrari one week and fucking they think they doing something out there. Nigga chase you out. They chase you out. The other shit. You don't go back to that spot. You going back to that spot. Oh. Shit. I love that spot between me and freeze. I'm just saying do you think people get this, something is happening. Do you think people get show? Do you think people get jealous though Joe? For real? Do you think people jealous? Like not jealous but like damn look how, 'cause hopefully It is a different, It is a different You, you're up.


What just hit me now. I was thinking about the spots. Yeah you had a little episode at the spot and then my man told me he seen you at the spot. So now I know who you was talking about that seen you at the spot that said him frugal. I think he has been thinking about this. No I didn. No I wasn't thinking about that. I was just thinking about Flip's question. And I remember you had an episode at the spot. So now that was the day you got the Maybach. So now you go Oh Shit.


Fuck This shit up out there. Right. They gonna jump the dog shit Uber here nigga an this is an audio adventure. Yo. You got me Oh. Shit. Where's he going? You Fuck that. Why you looking at me hot? Who called your anyway nigga?


Nigga throw hot. Who called your ass yo? Oh man. Speaking of women, speaking of women, speaking of women. Did anybody see that shit that Travis Hunter's girl pulled the other day? I didn't. No. What happened? He had a hell of a game. Okay. Yes he does. Hell of a game is understatement. Yeah. Well yeah. Let me find the stats. Yeah, he's incredible. Either side of of game is either side of the ball. Had a like had a hell of a game. He's just different. You wanna find the stats first? Go ahead. You can keep talking it. Yeah. So they show after the game is over they're walking I guess towards the off the field. Yes.


During the game when he made one, when he made one of 'em sick ass plays, he went outta bounds toward one of the, toward the cheerleaders. So he gave a look the cheerleader 'cause he made a play and he was like okay. And then he went back on the field. Okay. They are assuming that that's what the girlfriend's reaction hold a cold ass hug. That's what that was over. I don't think so. Yes. Nah that could've been that. That's what they, assuming that's what they are. I didn't see that part. But that better not be what that was over. But, but, but at the end, like just so everybody knows, like he tried to, he gave her, he reached in to give his lady a hug and she gave him the like the Yeah the stiff body. The stiff body. Like I don't want you anywhere near me. And clearly had an attitude and this was every camera in the world was on him. This was his last home game, right?


Yeah. And he went crazy. Over a hundred. Over a hundred yards. Touchdown. He had an interception. Interception he had like that's was nuts. He had the game of a lifetime and all everybody could talk about afterwards 'cause the camera was on. The girlfriend was damn. He had just had the game of his life right when he needed to have it. And you make his moment about you. I was, I watched soon to be ex-girlfriend. I watched this this weekend. I wrote that. I wrote that right on topics Travis on a soon to be ex. Yeah. Oh she might be the ex by now. Oh he might be for sure. I watched this this weekend. I showed it to with my wife and I said to her actually I said this is why the dude's on the pod say I pander. 'cause when I saw the video the first thing I thought was, damn, what did he do to her so bad?


Are you on ice? Nigga ice ain't think that shit you on ice. That's an ice. What did to her so bad react that way? Well maybe don't put me in that bag. No. Or maybe nobody reacts that way before the game. He did the go ahead. I'm just trying to tell you nobody reacts that way unless they mad as shit about something. Nigga, it ain't about you in this moment though, right now. Depend on what he did. Mm. It depends on what he did. Wait till we get back. Don't it. Don't depend on what It is. Wait till we get we what if he fuck two of her girlfriends before the game? Right? So talk about stay home. That's not for that moment. That's for when y'all get home. But while these cameras is on, while these scouts are here and I'm projected to go top three in the draft and I just had the game in my life, let's put that to the side. If you love me, be happy for me and share in this moment with me.


You here, you're here. Hold on. Mark. Mark. If he fucked to homegirls before the game and you knew that before the game and you in that mode, don't go to the fucking game. You don't come game, go home don. Don't make that moment, moment about you. We deal with this later. You taking this moment career game of a, of a lifetime and making it about you in this moment. Here's the thing. If I did something ignorant This shit to you, something disrespectful to You, right? And I usually stand on the side of the brothers. Eh? If if, if I came in this room right now knowing I did something fucked up to you and the camera's on, I'm not gonna, and I'm shaking every by hand. Maybe I won't come over and shake your hand because I know I'm putting you in a position where now you have to shake my hand even though you don't want to. So all I'm saying is that if he did, I don't, and I don't know what he did. She could be totally wrong. I'm just saying I don't assume the worst of either of them. But if he, if he did something fucked up, don't try to hug me in front of 50 million cameras.


If you know I did something, if you know you did something fucked up, mark, you be losing the plot sometimes. I ain't losing the plot. Yo. I honestly, I Hunter had 10 for 116 and three touchdowns. I don't care if he scored 12 touchdowns. If, if you did something fucked up to me, your touchdowns don't erase that. If you feel like that, mark you the game. If that's how you feel, you should lead. I'm, I'm not because look at the flip side. If he'd have walked off the field after the game and not embraced you at all, you gonna have a problem with that. Exactly. You are 1000% gonna have a major problem with that. If it was because he looked at the cheerleader and then didn't embrace you, you're gonna have an even more problem with that in that point. Aal, you know what I hate to introduce, like I hate to do this but there's levels.


He's not a second round. He's a first day. Top three should Pick top two. Yeah. Top. Yeah. R the first two they got him. And going back to back top. I'm, I'm saying when, when you, when you are of superstar status, you'll have to go to the game and hold it down at some point. I'm sure that Steph Curry wife, LeBron James wife, all of the superstar wives when they come to the game, I'm sure they was mad about some shit. LeBron wife, they be saying she will on the face sometimes, but sometimes you gotta hold it down and, and we'll deal with our private shit in private. This is the pro that was probably the biggest moment of that young boy's life. Okay. In the most important moment of that boy's life.


Not the time to make it about whatever the fuck you mad at over this cheerleader. I'm, I'm not or whatever you mad at. I'm not disagreeing with you, but you just said LeBron James wife wears it on her face sometimes. Some people say he's in year 22 and she still might wear her emotions on her sleeve. This girl, no she and they say she just started doing that but this girl is roughly 20 years old. Right. She won't there, she won't be there to draft. You get what I'm saying? She's roughly, don't worry about it, she won't there. That's his fiance. That ain't his girlfriend. Yeah. I don't care what she is today, but we don't know what happened. 'cause even during the hug, she's like pointing in the stands or some shit and he, he copping up. Oh you talking about wasn't me. It was, you know what I'm saying, he doing shaggy shit. But I just think that and that camera that got him was a camera that was from a far away.


That's the other thing she might known she was camera. It wasn't right. It wasn't right after the game. Like they up in the stands damn near coming down type shit. It wasn't on the field where the cameras right there in your face. She might not have known that they had the zoom on dog fix up. Those lessons will be learned. Don't fix up and don't do it again. Those lessons will be learned or somebody new will be in your spot. But the conversation then led to significant others that step on your moment in your spotlight. CD Lamb drive. That's the one. That's the one CD Lamb drive. Yeah. He took that phone off the couch. Nah, she took his phone. He that shit Back. You are outta here.


I'm not saying she didn't have a, she didn't have. Now I'm I'm not saying nothing happened to make her want to go on the phone. Not now. Not right now. Not now. That's it. We not trying to invalidate her feelings, Oprah. No, no. But in the in the second example, I, that's an easy not now what I'm saying, I'm not saying she's right and he's wrong. I'm saying and the first one it was an easy not now. And I'm saying it depends on that. That behavior is so extreme and so, so unusual that it makes me wonder what happened ahead of time. And all I'm saying is I, to me, who's right and wrong depends on what happened before the game. That's all I'm saying. Not in the biggest moment of my life. Not not, yeah. That's what, not in the biggest moment of my life. Whatever is on your mind, get curbed for the biggest moment in my life and you wouldn't want me to do it to you in the biggest moment of yours.


Or if It is that bad, leave and let's deal with this later. Don't even have it here at the game. You can go home if it's that bad. What, let's say something did happen that don't go. I can agree with that. You should I can agree with that here right now. I agree with don't go to the game. You shouldn't be here. Right Then I I don't know what happened. Yeah, I I think what happened is definitely needs to be considered prior to, to judgment. But and again, I I just think that where the, where it was, it wasn't down on the field, it was up in the stands. They, she might not have known that camera was on them. Yeah. She's new at this. Get the camera. It ain't about the camera. I just had the game of my life. Let's just celebrate this right now. We could deal with whatever we got when we get home.


I don't care if no camera saw it. If no camera saw it and she did that to him and he felt the way, like he would still have that comedy dog. You doing this right now? Yes. Depending on what It is, depending on what he did. Okay. That's all I'm saying. It just depends on what he did. Okay, well then you will not marry the top one or two pick in the NFL draft and that might be the price. Hey, do it your way. Not just that do it way and not just that. That's the he he might miss out on the love of his life too. Absolutely. Nah, won. Probably not. Yo, y'all probably not. You never know. You never know. Nah, y'all crazy. You never know But probably nah. I mean you might be right. You might be right but in his instance he might be, there was 900 billion people waiting for her to do that so they could be in the spot and not do that.


They might not be a lovely Love it and and that don't mean that the 900 billion people are gonna fulfill what she's fulfilling. She's special. Yeah. We'll see, we'll see how special she is. Y'all be bugging. Put up bookmark this one. We'll see how special she is. We'll see how special she is. Everybody's replaceable. I 20 something Sometime You wanna keep the 20 something you replaceable. If you stepping on my moment, don't worry we'll get You right the fuck outta here. Okay. We shall see. I feel, I feel like that after a good pod s not right now.


I smoke that shit This shit. You talking about wedding again girl. Girl, don't let me go get two touchdowns to a hundred yards at an interception. Yeah. What I feel like that for way less. Anyway. That's crazy. Travis, other man, congratulations. And and hey love, love wins. Yeah, love something. Yeah. I just chalk it up to her being really young and unsophisticated. It's cool. Just It is what It Is. You know what? Not to come full circle on something that we talked about a million pods ago. This is why the young athletes go get the old vintage Pussy. Yep. 'cause they know how to react shit. Like shit Alice, There been, there's been so many times where like I'm furious right before we're about to walk on a red carpet, but you seen it and as soon as we get out the car, it's all smiles and lovey fucking dummy.


Yeah. And I'll handle your motherfucking ass later. But right now you Hit your Ben pamphlet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. But time and you know, experience teaches you that Big Ben, shout to Ben number one for the town. Number two for going girl number three. I got going girl. Go girl. The best movies ever for me. You got good. I absolutely love Go Girl Love it and the book. I ain't read the book and the book. Me neither. But the niggas that say that killing shit now the book, the book, the book is way better. Oh my God. If you read that book, the movie would be nothing. I'm just lying. I'm in my mail.


But anyway. And three word on the curb is spun that block again. Yeah. He Spun that back to White C. Wait, which one? The Other one. The other one. The other one. Garner the other. Jennifer Her the other Jennifer. She looking good in Capital One. Commercials just ain't put up with them headaches about they good headaches. See everybody ain't replaceable. I, excuse me, everybody not replaceable. A lot of people are. There you are. That's true. This world is full of mediocrity. That's true. World is absolutely full of mediocrity. Here's one I got for y'all that wasn't in my notepad and it's not on the board 'cause I was too pussy to do it.


But these last two topics, leave me here. And since this is y'all take on Travis Hunter, I would love to hear your take on what the word on the curb is about Meghan Markel spending Thanksgiving by herself because she's going through a separation with Prince Harry. I had no idea. The internet is saying you fucking bitch. Why they saying nothing about her? Why like you to him away from his family? Because he chose, he chose her over everything. Okay. And for it did not work. It didn't work. That's a badass bet. That don't mean that one. So they blaming her. Right. Which is Crazy. She gonna blame for everything at this point. So why not just tack that on?


What you talking about might, I'm being so sarcastic from what I've heard, he ain't the most fondest of his family. Yeah. So that could wrote a whole book Called Fucking Spare. That could have been an ideal prior to her. But it came to head with, with her because of her. Because he chose her with her and because of her and the way they treated her in the chat. And again it, it may not be because of her, it could be because of the ideals. So you're all on the girl's side with everything. No, I'm not, no, I'm Saying I'm, he watched the way that the, the press and everybody else treated his mother and that there was a direct parallel between that and her. And so he's an honorable man and he decided that he was going to be her man and protect her.


And I think that there was real issues within the family, which is why he wrote a whole fucking book called Spare. So there was already existing issues that just kind of got exacerbated by the woman he fell in love with. True. I'm, I'm not on the woman's side on this. I don't, I just don't default that she's wrong. Yeah. I'm saying I have no fucking idea whose fault It is true. But I don't assume that if he went through all that shit and they don't stay together, that that means that she did something wrong. Do you believe that two people that entered the same happy loving relationship voluntarily make the same exact sacrifices? Or do you believe that one person may sacrifice more than the other person? One person De It is never, nothing is ever 50 50. Okay. Nothing's ever 50 50. But I'm so I think think continuously 50.


Think the internet response is only because none of us know. And I'm with you, we shouldn't assume anything. But the internet response is only because they believe him to have sacrificed more. Like they calling her shit like b b-list Actress who, what? What are they calling her? Divorcee or whatever was suit. All of these words were Yeah, but then she dipped on suits. Yeah she was great. And then she absolutely Dick dipped off suits. Why? Thanks for the spoiler alert. I'm on season three, but cool. Damn. But wait, and not only did she dip spoiler alert. Damn they hate when I do that. But her, I'm not saying this has anything to do with anything. This is just the happenings of when you're together, her rate shot through the moon.


So what it looks like is she Used him. It just looks bad come up, come up. Maybe not, maybe not using, I don't wanna say use not using, maybe not using but, but marriage is the better or opportunity or the worse. I feel you. They might Be taking a break Until death do what's part. They Might be taking a break maybe. And sometimes the person makes all the sacrifice. He took all the risk. Still is the person who's wrong and fucks up. He could be wrong. That's all I'm saying. He could, I'm not saying that he's right because he's Prince Harry. Right. I'm not saying that but but I'm saying a lot of people on the internet that are, they love royal people. Right. And so they're like, they love Yeah. Yeah. And they love celebrity and love Royal and they love the Palace intrigue. So they're like, whatever happened, she ruined our family, she ruined our shit. They've already thought that and they're looking for an excuse to be pissed at her again.


She could be a thousand percent wrong. I have no fucking idea, but I just don't assume that. Yeah, but tell me you're gonna be a thousand percent wrong before I leave my Warrior family. And the So-called come up Can, she can be a thousand percent street price too. Right. And and the internet court of public opinion because it's, I was about to say don't work out. She's wrong. How about how Thousand just Harry could be sold Coke off two ho right now. Right. And he got, she got a grin of barett because he worth for more bread, right? Like you, you don't know. Are you asking me? Yeah. Oh no, I don't think that. So I'm just saying, not saying that we don't know what necessarily took place in that relationship, but I'm sure, and this is the part that people won't not getting because we always put money above any and everything else.


She's lost a bunch of shit too. Love comes before money for me. Like she's lost a bunch of shit too. Like, like what? Like her anonymity shoes. Right. Like no mad shit. My nigga, she lost mad shit in fucking with him. Wait. Nah, that she did lose a lot. She lost anonymity. That's true. The fuck outta here bro. Everything anonymity, everything. Black lady. How you view shit, everybody else view It is different. I ain't saying nothing. It is tougher if you're an actress. 'cause you probably don't want the anonymity anyway 'cause you probably want to be famous my nigga. Not that level of famous, not that kind of famous Different Level of saying you might not wanna be anonymous, but you definitely don't want to be yo on the bullseye. You thinking about it from an American perspective also like yo dog over here, the king and queen and the royal family and all that shit.


Ain't nothing. Yeah. When you go over there my nigga, that shit is a totally different ballgame's. Why they, that's why they left. They her over the came over this way. Yeah. Brought the baby over here and everything. Like yo no, we not even fucking with y'all. Yeah. They r her over the Coles consistently every single day. Do do, do you feel like that Mel, do you feel like she should have, you know, for the sacrifices that he made in order to be with her, do you feel like she should have at least put her best foot forward? I not saying that she didn't, but at least try to make it work. That's what She, I think under the, I think under the most normal circumstances that marriage and relationships the biggest Fucking hard he made the biggest sacrifice Than her. That's, but that's an assumption. You are Assuming that what's what's sacrifice. You are assuming that And we don't know the, we don't know their dynamic.


What sacrifice. We don't Know what you think. Well I'm saying the shit he lost, he might not have wanted. I mean there's evidence that he didn't want to be part of Royal family. No, but but when you're a part of a royal family and you choose to go against the, the, the, the, the soul, the family and all that type Of shit. Yeah. The institution. The institution and everything that, that, that comes with a lot. That's not easy. And he's been in the spotlight. Mom It is been a lot with him. So of course we are gonna say that he made more of a sacrifice than her. But what if I fought with the family from the jump? That's what I'm saying. I think he hated This shit then before Met Could be it. Okay. And be clear like This shit. Yeah. But you didn't act on it until she came. I could got with her to spike the family. It didn't get publicized until she came. I could've got with her to Spike. I could've been acting on it all along, but just nobody knew about it until this situation presented itself again over there.


The news that they getting over there about the royal family is not the same news we getting about the royal family. Bro. We've seen instances their mother have passed away since they had mad shakeups in the whole fucking hierarchy over there. So all of those things could have been happening at a time that was so we, we've seen instances where somebody don't fuck with the family and they'll go date outside or date the one that they rebellious the family wouldn't rebellious be rebellious. That's true. He could've, that could've been that for him. I know they're gonna hate her. Right. This will piss him off. Yeah, this will do right here Fuck that y'all the ultimate fuck y'all. Yeah. But then that's and we gonna have a baby then he's a piece of shit if he did that. And all of It is not necessarily somebody close us out, please. Yeah. Well In Closing, we don't know what the fuck happened but we wish them well.


Prayers and thoughts and prayers. Thoughts, thoughts and prayers. There we go. Can't go wrong with thoughts and prayers and she fired. Woo Lord. Fucking you smoke. I didn't know who she was. Ready for some Harry leftovers. you right on up. Right. Clean up on I five. No he wouldn't not, he would not fuck Meghan Markel. You think so? If he was single, should knock it should be the Prince of Wales. It should come here. Walk in a slow motion nigga. We got 10 minute sit down Ish. Yeah, you be the principal, you be that nigga man. You don't gonna fuck Ish man. Bring her right to Mr. East. What's wrong with you? That's a flex.


Mark. Mark and Mel. Do y'all have anything on Biden? Pardoning his son bullshit. Nepotism at its finest And abs. He should. That's exactly what the fuck he should do on his way out the door. What you talking? Pardon? Your son? I Love it. No, but hold on. People are but he just took a play outta Trump's book. Thank You. Exactly. Yeah. Because now he's blaming the Republicans and other people saying that reason There was a Witch hunt. The reason why my son had got into all of this situation or witch hunt It is because he they Wanted Yeah, they wanted What? Step on her and asked for help. No, she was doing it. And then you stepped on it. Now that's, that's hay. That's, that's you person.


You said what you personation was straight quirky from life goes over. Yeah. And, and and on top of that, that's hate. That's hate. 'cause I'm trying to participate in a topic and I'm like, yo, Mel. And that's the thing. You're not helping you no more. That's, it's over for that my nigga. I'm you, you not saving you more. I'm gonna show you soon. I'm gonna show you. I got so for you next week. I'm you soon. See didn didn't want to stop. It is I fuck the bonuses out. So you I just get it all out the way. Yeah man. I'm sorry. Yeah. Help me out. Hold me down. Hold him down, ma'am. Oh, You know I said what? I said he should 1000%. I'm done. What the fuck he did? He's taking a page outta of fucking Trump's book. Yes, exactly. Yes. Fucked up. Pardon your fucking son on your way out the door.


I I don't know man. I I think every mark was passionate about this. Every critic. Yeah. I'm very passionate. I mean every criticism that was made from both sides I think is correct. I think Biden pardoning his son was the right thing to do. It was a witch hunt. He, they had a, they had a plea deal and the Republicans came in outta Congress and jumped into a proceeding and said, this isn't, this isn't a tough enough sentence. The sentence he got It is the same sentence that everybody would get. And then the Republicans came in and changed it. What was the sentence they were offered? No jail time. There's gonna be no jail time. That's not sentence that everybody get. That's the sentence. I should say that sentence that most people get and black ass wouldn't have Got it. And the people, that's not a sense that we don't get if our family is not well connected in the political form at disagree with that A little bit. But my point is, we shouldn't be mad at Biden for giving his son that we should be mad at Biden for not making sure everyone else got that true.


That's all I'm saying. I'm not So the two things could be equally true and they are synonymous. That's what I just said. I said, I said, I said I agree with all the arguments. Right. They synonymous you living in a real world. You're same motherfucker that wrote a bill that called the drug, the drug addicts, this and that and the other. Now your son is one of those drug addicts. And that's what I'm saying. We, I think people are mad at the wrong shit. So, so your son is one of the motherfuckers that you was critiquing back in the eighties. Yep. It is now come back to, to, to haunt your ass. And the chickens came home to Roos. Your son is one of the niggas that you was calling to be locked up. Lock your fucking son up nigga. No. And that's why I wish if you, it's my fucking son first You. right. I listen, you know, we'd all do it. I'm gonna say no, just saying the criticisms toward him. Oh go ahead. And his actions are definitely valid. Criticize the way and that's what I'm saying, Lie also if you're criticizing me for something from that did in the eighties to something that's happening today.


Yeah, no, we talking about the ideal. I get it. I get it. Understand talking the ideal nigga. Black families were destroyed based on the shit that you wrote. Exactly. Let's destroy your fucking family. My my my funny, my shit about this is everybody that's criticizing if y'all pops was the president and y'all was in, where do I sign? So shut the fuck. But he lied. He also said he he lied it. I did this. That's the part I had to issue with. He also said he wasn't gonna pardon his son. He also said no one's above the law. No one's above the law. Because I was supposed to say that at the time. What? Say on camera. What the fuck is wrong with you? What you gonna say on camera? Yes y'all, I'm gonna pardon my son. He's above the law. But the rest of you are going to gotta go to jail. What? No, I'm gonna say, I say all politicians get in front of the camera and say what they think are the right thing.


You say now you Want me to read part of his statement Now address That contradict that shit. Next week I'll Fix shit A little bit in the glass house. That niggas is crazy. The charges in the charges in his case came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then a carefully negotiated plea deal agreed to by the Department of Justice Unraveled in the courtroom with a number of my political opponents in Congress. Taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would've been fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's case and he wouldn't have gotten involved. Man, I don't care about none of that. My kid coulda got caught with 16 dead hookers and three birds.


Where do I fucking sign? He's right. This is how the world works. The real world. Not not, not the ideal world where it makes sense over here and for over here, the real world works like this. True. Where do I come home? You know, that's where, do you know who my dad is? Do you know my father worked? That's what all that shit means. There's another piece to this too though, right? He didn't just pardon him for a specific Right. This is a very I'm partying. No, but That is what I'm saying. This this is a his, this is a unusual pardon? Usually you pardon somebody for a thing that they did. Right. He pardoned him for no listens. What I'm saying He pardoned him for any crime committed from 2014 until the end of this month. So that that, that's such a wide net that that sounds like he's trying to cover something else up too. It not just for his son but for himself.


For anything he's tied up in. Might be that just the parts ference shit they didn't even do yet. I'm the president. Right. I'm just, I'm just saying it looks suspicious. It is suspicious. It is very suspicious. And I'm saying people have a right to be mad about that and the people today, the powers that be say so. Yes. Lions don't give a fuck about the opinion of sheep. There you go. That is a quote and it's a quote for a reason. What I'm saying is fuck all of them. I would've done the same shit. But I can still point out that Joe Biden is on bullshit. It is on bullshit but he's been on bullshit. But just to be clear, this ain't new. No. He's been on bullshit. Every president also, just to be very clear, every politician fuck fuck every politician.


I'm just talking about for the pardons though. Every like Bill Clinton, pardon his brother Roger who got caught with Coke. There was no political witch hunt. There was no listen. Lemme, he just said you got Coke. I don't want you talking. Check this out. Check this out. Pardon him. Check this out. Let my father be the president. Hey yo. What? I'm doing it all. Yeah. Yeah. My father the president. I don't gonna fuck what y'all talking about. And This shit has, I'm driving This shit has happened since the beginning of That's the real world. His legacy fucked up though. Who? Legacy, who Bidens over? I don't think so. I don't think so. Tell me why. Because nigga, I'm 160 years old. Right. Tell me why. Because he to to the people he didn't do the right thing.


It is It is George w Bush's legacy fucked up? Yes. I got a whole, I don't fuck with George W but I just asked about that Saddam Hussein shit on Twitter Le C and 20 years flip and 30 years. Remember that shit? Nigga ain't gonna remember that shit. All that shit. Yeah. See that's, that's, yeah, that's in hindsight. But what I'm saying is that that's legacy. Yeah. That's legacy. Big But. yeah, but what I'm his right now, as of right now, niggas ain't putting respects on Democrat's name or Joe Biden name for the state. No, that's the fucked up One. Well I think it's, I think that his legacy has, you know, got a stain on it for a completely different reason than this. This is whatever this is Ken side. Yeah. There. Yeah. Oh Shit. And, and y'all are optimistic in that. What do you mean?


That y'all think that that's gonna stain his legacy? 'cause it ain't no, but it should. I agree it won't but I think it should. I think that's what's pissing me off to see these people outraged about Right. Pardoning Hunter Biden while 45,000 people and guys are dead right now. Yeah. Or like I think yeah, there's a really big difference between George W. Bush starting fucking I like it in a, in a country against a country that, that had nothing to do that never happened. The fucking towers. But this was 2000 and what, 2002? 2003. This is really when the in internet was kind of, its in its infancy now at 2024. This will result in a stain on his record in, you know, in comparison to George W. Bush and you know, Iraq and all that shit. But don't take your eye off the ball.


That's something I'll tell everybody. Don't take your eye off the ball because while we're outraged about Hunter Biden, Donald Trump's about to probably pardon all of January 6th. Crazy people for sure. But that was happening regardless of Exactly. But he's gonna use this as an excuse. Well they're not playing fair, so I'm gonna do, he was gonna do that shit anyway. And he already, Paul Manafort Rogers, I mean Yeah, yeah. All all gang. Yeah. He, he part of everybody gang. Yo Donald Trump comes y'all old school rules down. That's how you, that's how it go. Donald Trump comes from old school rules and they do too. Yo, you my man. Right. I don't give a fuck you go sit up for eight months. I got you. Yeah. When you come home, I got you. You good? Yeah. And you know what? His man go sit up and his man went and sat up and got pardoned shut and it's still filthy rich and I still got a, a fucking ally in the White House. Which One are you talking about?


Who are you talking about? All half of them. Yeah. He, he pardoned his, yeah, his crew. He pardoned gang when they wouldn't rap. So, so, so, so thinking about that then it makes me thinking of YSL trial because that's finally over true now. And everybody's home. Except for, except by a couple people not home but You. right. Everybody but a couple people pleaded out but, and it ended in acquittal my man for ya, Gotti. Yeah, exactly. Yep. Which was major not guilty. All charges. Is this the biggest rap victory ever? I mean they, they kicked the state's ass. Yeah they did. I mean this is like some movie shit. This is like the state kicked they own ass. That's true. Let's keep it real. That's true. The state beat they own ass in this whatever. Which I know I've seen some people was a rap. We don't care about the details.


Yeah, that's true. Yeah we celebrate This shit. It almost look like gonna keep it up was a rap Victory dog This shit look like they threw the game way. Getting paid was a rap victory. Right. This shit. Look but I mean the actual like, you know they threw the game but we don't care about the details as long as we like we want. Oh we talking about people that kicked they ass, shit. DJ Drama and them kicked they ass. That's another good one. Murder Inc. Kicked they ass. Like these are you don't beat Murder Inc. Shit was a big one. That's a huge Oh that's, that might be one that But. yeah that was a fake. That's a major one. And DJ Drama and their ass. I'm just talking about Rap Victories. Yeah, rap Victory. Okay. I Love it. I Love it when I, a nigga don't believe in jail. I definitely love When Niggas Murder Inc. Was a big one. Was a big one. Murder Inc. Was Murder Inc. To me might be the biggest one because I, I just knew Irv.


Lemme ask it. Yeah. So the victory in kicking the ass is two different things. That's John Gotti kicked their ass. Murder Inc. Just won. Won, won. That's fair. That's fair. Gotti kicked their ass it Crippled Murder Inc. Yeah and they haven't repair and they did a lot to Murder Inc. Man. Like they cut murder Inc's old money off. They couldn't even help Preem like this. The Feds really? You ain't even hold him down won by here. Huh? Talking all that queen shit. Your name Queen Flip. That's crazy. Ain't even crazy. I ain't know who.

Listen, I got a great Part of the Show y This is from somebody named chicks up. Chicks says here. What up everyone here? This question is for the guys but male you can answer too. Thanks. So I guess it's for everyone then Anyway.


I've been with my man for several long years. No, we're not married or live together and that's, that's peace. Not the issue here. As of recently, he's been working more trying to make moves and leveling up and I 100% supported. That's right. Let's get down to the problem. Oh, sex has diminished drastically and it's bothering me. I've tried to set up dates and be understanding his schedule, but it's still not enough flashback to three years ago I randomly met a man. Not my man. We were together already. Ah, but I randomly met a man at a function and had immediate mutual attraction to one another.


Bitches. Yo Lord new guy is also in a relationship. Oh that sounds, that's a couple of moves up here. A little standby piece with some chemistry. New guy is also in a relationship, but over the years we flirted a little something light. Nothing too crazy. Fast forward to today. New guy is still flirting with me, waiting for his opportunity to beat it. And I can't lie. I've thought about letting him get something in my heart and mind. Bitch, It is shady. Boy this, I don't wanna cheat on my man lying on the Part of the Show. What fuck is lying you guys, y'all are stepping over chicks. She's almost done in my heart and mind.


I don't wanna cheat on my man again. But my kitty cat is screaming something else. My question is, how do I convey to my man in a way that he gets it, that we need more sex Follow up question. Is he fucking someone else? My woman brain says no, he doesn't seem to have the time. But I'm not naive enough to believe where there's a will. There's a way. Let me know what y'all think. That's a lot. I'm tossing it to the best fucking crew in the universe. Man. That man faithful as hell. You out there, you projecting your, your bullshit on him.


He trying to, he trying to make your life better. Yeah. He he working for y'all to try to put y'all into a better situation. Exactly. You out here trying to get a box away, get a rose. And if you giving the box away will lead to him being able to successfully level up in peace level, you both up, then go fuck him. Or if giving the box away will lead him to break up with you and then he can go and fully level up. Level up. Yeah. Now that's do that too. Now that's, that's gonna hurt. Yeah. So ask yourself prepared chicks. Is the risk worth the reward? Reward? Because that's the problem with you and the new person you flirting with. Both having somebody they don't, y'all don't usually break up at the same time.


Never. Never. And then some he might not break up at all. Yeah, that part He Ain. He might not be going nowhere. Yeah, he just wanna hit. That's it. Very much so. And then you get to falling in love and thinking y'all got something over here and guess what? He going home and don't tie the two together. If you want to have a conversation with your partner about you being sexually satisfied or your intimacy, then do that and come new. Some type of conclusion before you give the kitty cat away. Two thoughts. Because the girls go out and fuck the nigga and then the dick be bad. And then they come back and then the nigga find out be mad. Leave, blow up, level up, up. She gonna find another excuse to fuck another nigga. Whatcha talking about? Hopefully not. I'm gonna take out a word that she really wants to be able to do.


I, and you know what, when your dude is leveling up, that comes with you making some sacrifices as a partner. It does. I hate to break it to you. I we not gonna be able to fuck the way you, we once did. We won't be able to go on the dinner dates that we once did. Your man is, your man is busy shorty. Do you want him to have time or money Word You I I feel like me and Ish won't say the same thing. Go ahead. No, you Got it. Go ahead. No, somebody gotta pander first. I mean somebody gotta say it. Fuck. It's not even pander. It is a couple things. I mean she's definitely looking for an excuse to fuck somebody else. 1000%. That that's a, that's a fake one. I think she fucked him already. Oh she's definitely, she's fucked him. She fucked him already. She's at least done. So to They kissed. Yeah, they did a little, little moochie. They kissed. She she threw that nigga some neck.


Grab the flirting, fade into grab Kiss. A good hug or slapping ass something. She's saying that he keeps flirting with her and her kitty cat or something is ready. Can't deny it. He It is purring but she ain't say nothing about her flirting back. Mel. Can you talk to us about what happens when the kitty cat purrs? I agree that something's already transpired between them. Yeah, it's the word. Yeah. And it's on her mind like 24 7. She's Trying to justify it now she's trying to justify, You Know what I'm asking? Justification is the fuckery. Yeah. Y took the chicken. No Thank. you yo I'm actually interested to find out, sorry, how old they are. That chicken shit To see if she need a Holli berry lube or not. No. To find out if he might need some ed meds or She could need the holly berry lu.


Or maybe he just tired of fucking her. That's, that's why, why? I gotta be why I gotta be him. Let's go mom. Let's go mom. That that, that's the part I was getting to. It wasn't pander is he might just be tired of fucking her. Let's go mo maybe. I mean, leveling up. I never leveled up so much that I didn't wanna fuck I did well that I don't wanna fuck somebody. Oh, that's, that's different. But I'm also, And I'm saying he might be tired. That's what I, he's tired of fucking her with with the level up. Right. Right. Came to level up like, oh wait, it's up This shit. I wasn't trying to throw shots at him. I wasn't. I really am just curious because That is a factor. Her libido, if they're like, let's just say they're in their forties, her libido is gonna be up here.


His might be like down here. That's that's true. It is, it's it's just one scenario. Everything she said Is true. It's Just one scenario. If that's not the part, if that's not the scenario so much, Nah, it's all true. But fucking, if you're in love with your man, don't even fucking entertain fucking somebody else. Oh, she been there. Don't she do it. And if you've already done something, then fucking stop it. If you really care about your relationship, I think they need to sit down and have a conversation. I suspect they both fucking somebody else or not. Or not, but I'm just saying they need to have a conversation about what they want and if it's being open so that they can both explore this other shit, do that. Or like, what the fuck are we doing? But they need to have open what Relationship? Open relationship. Open relationship. That, that might be the answer to this. Let him level up, like Joe was saying, let him level up. You go fuck this dude.


Like he could go do what he want. I wish he gave us more information on what, you know, what his answer, what leveling up looks like. Yeah. I wanna know what he's doing. That's gonna be Yeah, if the leveling up means that he's like taking on more hours, you know, like overtime and shit. We don't know what he does. I just want to know what he's doing with the hour. What his field is. Yeah. Excuse. Like getting it, getting it Show up. I would like to hear that. So I could gauge how much time he got fall and we shoulda had we should called. We should Called. That's what I mean. Like, so if he's like leveling up by taking more hours or whatever, like trying to like, you know, fast track. He might be an hourly employee. I think What we don't know that's what we want. Or it could be at McDonald's and he's fucking somebody else. Yeah. Yeah. But she and that's what I, this yo her I would've called Yeah my nigga this.


But she didn't leave a number. She didn't say she want an intimacy. She said she wanted a dick. The kitty cat is perming. It is purring. That nigga can roll over and fuck you 10, give you some pussy. That's what I'm saying. What he talking about. That's what I'm saying. He just don't wanna fuck her. You or he is true to his word. And It is really trying, trying to get to it. Yeah. Listen, me and my partner having are having the talks about like living together now. Nice. And I made it, it very, don't clap for that, that's corny. But I made it very clear that whatever our sex cadences now don't expect that shit when you get up here. Oh That's, that's Definitely's real. That's that's Thousand percent.


That's very real. She look like they Move in like, oh we're not just gonna lay around and fuck all day. It is like, No, no, no, no. Every time I see you I'm not fucking you. If we live together. Right At all. At all. Sorry. I'm still Newly long distance. Shit is a fucking honeymoon ass. It's a Mirage man. Time period. It's so much fun. Anyways, chicks, good luck. Don't wait. That wears off. Which part? What y'all talking about? Of course. I don't want that. Oh, do y'all vote that chicks should fuck the dude or not? Chicks has Fuck that dude already Chick fucked. Assuming that she hasn't Yes, yes. Fuck that nigga. Just tell I I vote for talk to your dude about what you wanna do and then fuck the nigga. If you don't like what he says, be transparent.


Yeah, yeah. And let him know. See that's the part I don't like. And her saying I'm gonna talk to him about me not being sexually pleased. She's not saying it's to the point where I'm outside and I found somebody I'm attracted to and we have chemistry chicks is fronting bro. See those are different talks dog. It's been, chicks has already entertaining this nigga. She's been entertaining the nigga now for years. So even before your man started his level up, you was already on the phone flirting with the nigga. Exactly. And you liked the nigga. You information with the nigga. Exactly what we talking about.
