Don't know how you call this anymore. It's Instagram Drop Oh. That might be a That is it's a new category. It's s not a leak. It is That might be a drop. Yeah, let's hear It.


It's been a long time coming. Yeah I cut It off There because I thought It was Ford Real Ai. It's a few things I'm overcoming Yeah sounds like Think About It every night to stay Don. I'm sitting Here trying to redirect I. Think About It every to stay. It is been a long time coming. How much longer Ish this?


It's Only at minute 45 and we're 45 through It is we don don Got play the whole thing though. I don't think it's s like no deep dive Ish a beat drop. No. Trying to redirect Alright. It is kind a reminded me a the old Kanye. Yeah it is a college dropout. Yeah. Yeah. I I let it musically He go back to that let Bag. Yeah. It don't sound bad. Don't sound bad. I. I'll wait. good I. don don Love. It sounds good. I'll, I'll, I'll wait till it's done. Yeah, Same. Yeah. She make me want go turn on Sam Cook. Yeah.


Shout yeah though. But but I do like the war going on between labels in the DSPs maybe or artists in the DSPs. But someone In the DSP can't be artists better than the dp. It is Spotify. Spotify We isn't the fact That, they're dropping on IGN kind I let a a step into, you know, defiance Yeah against these Dps Yeah. They can't do, they can't do shit without the label. So this would be like It could be label versus DSP or something. You I don't think this Ish just the artist saying Hey we going to do something different over Here. Whoever It is versus the DSP I. let it. Yeah something need to Change you Don think it's a test Yeah They're saying That, they're saying That Gorilla released her album D two C Really?


Let Let me see should do you Don I think we should be paying more attention to this I I Also saw act. Say That or somebody say that. I didn labels. we pretty upset About That j Cole Track not labels DSPs. We upset About. How That j Cole Track was released. I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah. Doug I think it's a test. I think it's a test that everybody's seeing how we could circumvent them 'cause they taking the lion's share a the bread. I would hope so. I would hope. That is already in partnership with the labels though. What people aren't talking About enough. Ish the beef That Tim Cook and Zuckerberg have, Ooh tell me spicy to Ford. The s like Ish. This a tin foil hats situation. This Ish real shit. Okay. So When Zuckerberg got them little curls and shit and then went to that world conference him and shot to metal We That nigga ain't gonna fuck his like shout to metal.


No, Not at all. Shout to Alvin Martin. Everybody. There. That's the next territory. That that they want to dominate. Ish the music industry. Mm. So Daniel at Spotify, Zuckerberg, Tim, they all got a little clash. a the Titans ego shit going on, right? Now. So Zuckerberg has been Doing incredibly. we turn This shit around two years ago. And if everybody's on ign, why? And everyone's promoted on My platform, why not circumvent and move some a y'all over Here give you a little exclusive deal. Universalize some shit up. TikTok drop the ball to the moon. Genius. I was About to say it sounds like the TikTok shit all over again.


But We play y'all not Yeah Like and It ties into the Google add our trust shit 'cause a you YouTube, which I don't think will happen. But if they become publicly traded Now it's gonna be Meta versus YouTube. YouTube Ish gonna be bigger in the tv. I don't know if you saw it. You can let make a real TV series and upload It on YouTube. Now What, Yeah. Yeah. So it It is a real battle. a who's gonna run the music industry in the television industry like in the next decade? Huh, you can't count. Count Zuckerberg out man. Nah. He he a Different beast. A think he a different type a thinker. So Apple been dropping a fucking ball Ford the last three years too. Who Has Apple? How so? They've been re rocking the same phone.


Ford. Oh Yeah, they've been Doing. That. Ford. That is That is 15 years I. Don't think Apple cares. They have to. They Don. Why weren't they trying to put they feat in it at one point? They have to. Why? Tell me why. Why they have to care. About the phone. Oh Shit. I'm sorry, go ahead. Why do they have to care? About the phone. Why do they have to care? About anything? Watch time. Listen time. You guys know that shit's incredibly important and Ford the first time in our adult life, Microsoft has become more popular than Apple. People are falling at Love with the phone. They are. Ywe has a fucking trifold phone and 4K Yeah Give me some innovation. That's true.


Even the Apple fanboy are like Yo When. Are we going to get something new? Ice I. let didn say It. I said It Apple Vision Pro I get 33% a all y'all's business through that, through the app store. Why do I care? But they're trying to fight This shit. It's s not enough. And how long can you do that? It's s not gonna sustain itself. Ford a decade. I do think they're gonna, you Got come out with a New Pony. Yeah, That fight Ish going come To the United States at some Point it's already hit. You already took Care a it in Europe And Tesla may not be the one to do It, but in 2011, meta was supposed to release a phone Ford free. They didn't wanna do It, Ford, whatever reason. Shout a Ford coming up with the idea. But let's say if open AI or chat GPT gives you a free smartphone, but I get to get all your data and upload It and improve our algorithms, that's going hurt the market share.


It'll kill Them. It is going, damn It is Hurt. I don't want to panic. When shit gets rough. I want to see When I a decline. The they said they're not gonna release a phone annually anymore. Yeah, that's big. I. I. I was thinking That let at once we got to the 16, I was like so Ish it gonna be let every single year. So we're eventually gonna get to the number 25. It is notice That every other year they're gonna start releasing the phone. They're gonna gonna stop releasing the phone annually. Yeah. Yep. So that's going, that's a revenue hit. Yeah. And When so much a, your revenue Ish tied to one product. Yeah, It is, It is It is tough man. It needs some more innovation at That is true. talk to Everybody breaking news. Gorilla drops her new album, glorious direct to consumer and cuts out the DSP middleman leaving them Feeling some type a way that from tracks this morning.


I mean in a very smart move. I mean artists Don are starting to realize they don't need a label anymore. I mean a lot a these labels are farming everything out and they're just banks. So why do you need 'em? I mean in the DSP thing. I mean you get lost in the sauce if We talk album dsp right? right. Now Like That is you Don know What. He's talking About. Yeah, I. don don know What. He's talking About That album Ish 1000% on the dsp. Maybe physicals We D two C. That's possible. Gorilla can't cut the label out. Yeah, the Labels signal get to Cut. Oh. She. I was Wonder. I was wondering What the direct a con consumer Ish let let a physical album. It can be. Yeah, it Could be a download. It could be a digital download. A download too.


You can do digital rest In peace. Brownsville co actually who just passed away. He's been pioneering That Ford a while. Yeah Rest in peace. Yeah, That was horrible. It was, that was a really Sad story. It is rest in peace. Caught It is rest in peace. Caught didn. Somebody else pass I just heard him Got it it That I know off that top a My head. Got it Got it Got it. I think I. Think Everybody. Just testing it to see What could What, What could stick. You know What I'm saying we gonna throw shit at a wall. If something stick then we gonna run with it. I think everybody's really trying to get a away from the DSPs. I think Everyone should in the in, in this world where they're constantly evolving the algorithms and constant, constantly evolving the pay rates. If you have a method to reach people directly, I'm Doing that Even if you reach 'em on a smaller scale, your your profit margin could be Exponential.


Higher Expon not even close. Not even the problem. Ish When a lot a, y'all are signed to the label who got the deal with the DSP. True. True That is, that's where the problem falls at. So you Got get some type a leverage to either get at a that deal. We work that deal something to where Now, you got some control a your music. 'cause the label don't give a damn that You s not making no money. We, we I agree we cooking over Here no You. right. right. But even If you don't do It with the label You, it gonna have to pay meta Ford the push Yeah. If You it a big enough, but if You it a big enough artist, do you have to Yes? like if you, if You Kanye Brought it shit At a you, I'm just saying if you Kanye or if you drape or if you Taylor a Swift bro and you go direct to consumer and you sell a million units. If you sell 2 million units and you tell a Swift I. Don't know. What her deal.


Ish. 'cause I've heard her deal. Ish amazing at a label. But I'm just saying you could potentially have the same revenue stream. That you didn sign with the label. But look you so he talk, we talking About with the meta situation. let using Instagram and all a That He that it's on My platform. Oh, you right gonna pay me Yeah. You it gonna pay You. it gonna pay me or they won't. You pay Ford This shit. You it gonna pay me. We'll hide you with with a button Yeah. That's a fact. Yeah. It's all above My Pay grade. Although There Ish a lot a leverage though actually if you talk About, Taylor Swift or or Drake. Drake Or any a Drake major artist, If they release all meta, they might not need a cut because we're getting all the data from all the traffic you're gonna bring Ford this one song or whatever, Yeah that you know what I mean. like before It might be a loss at Facebook or whoever. Meta Ish willing to willing to take Gotcha Don I.


Don't think the labels are gonna take this line down though. They're gonna come up with something. a course That is the cat and mouse game. Soon as somebody something new come up, they gonna find a way to infiltrate and take it over. And you just gotta keep going. Yeah, I'm happy you got a lot a music yo Me too This. shit. Nasty This shit. Ish It is Music business. Yeah. Absolutely I want to enshrine this fucking podcast I Feel let It is just About to be the culmination. a everything this podcast has said since inception. Absolutely. like you could just predict When shit. Ish About to get bad I feel Ford the artist out. There Yeah I too. Again, I do feel Ford the artist Yeah It makes it confusing too. let It, if you don't know where it's going, What am I aiming Ford, you know what I mean?


like that's a good point. Where Ish, the money getting made. How do What do? I do let Yo if You it a artist today, right? Do you even know? let in any business let, if you own a a restaurant you could say, yo I sold this much. You jerk Chicken I sold this much oxide like I know where My revenue streams are coming from. So Now, I'm gonna put more focus over Here. If you are a artist, do you even really understand how you get paid I think they just get a check in the mail or You know what I mean. let do they really understand how It is that they get paid. It is all Meek spoke to it bro. Forget how you get paid. They don't even know What. They selling as a artist. You get told a number from them. Which Ish crazy. Hey, you didn this. You had this many streams.


You don't know you, you don't know What. You Doing I put a song out. I don't know What. That song didn all I know Ish What. Y'all told me didn What. Y'all told me This shit coulda sold y'all. They just told y'all Pump It up went go 20 years later. That is Don make no sense. Chaka Ka, I beat Chaka. KY Sense I beat Cha a Khan. That Is Everyone. Song on purpose. Bye the music industry. 'cause if I own 30% a Spotify and got Daniel's hands behind his back, Now, I can take My hands off It and say it wasn't us. It's them. True. While I own that True while some a the music industry shit Ish falling apart. It's crazy. Sorry. Same as Bacon. This shit. Ish interesting. I Love. It really Ish. I Love it This shit.

That, you have beef with facts because yeah, people are watching to see if then the unfollow happens. That's a big thing. So you just was emotional and hit the unfollow on your coworker. I knew nothing. About any a this part Yeah.


That is how I found out. I. I'm following this out. like let What you. Doing was I. I was quiet. About It, I mean you, you mentioned that, you know, you threw little jokes out. There and I told her that like Joe would say you can't do the same shit that you didn the other day as the all dude cats. You was throwing little seeds and stuff. But I, When, I went home.

It you we not nice to me. Yes you. We not nice. I know. And so I packed up and walked the fuck up at a Here. You didn What.


Do y'all think About men who move off of hearsay? That's a good question. Think it's a mistake. Here, But not if it fits. That's how I feel. That's What makes it. That is That's What you. That's What. What hurts at some level. You right. You gotta confirm. I'll move over Here say if it fits me. let, if if if I hear somebody say something that he said and It fits him, I'm gonna be mad at him if fits him. didn What. If he didn't say That, I'm gonna be mad. Why don't you ask first? Yeah, because some confirmation they gotta fit the character a people. No, because sometimes people can tailor some bullshit to s say True. True, true, True. You know, I've had people say That I said things and because it was a, it was sarcastic or whatever.


It was kind a intelligent and witty. They We like Oh. I could see Melyssa saying That. I'm like, but I didn't. So I think it's hypocrisy because I wouldn't want anybody to judge me off a anything as We. I mean. It's just It is, It is it's a thin line because I exactly. I wouldn't want anybody to say that. I would just complain. About That recently Flip her some shit in the street And got his panties in a bunch and got All mad. Oh Shit came back totally barked on Mel. That's s not didn bark. not in a loud and aggressive way, but totally got went off on Mel.

I could argue That a lot a these crime shows kind a stole Matlock's. Sauce. Sauce. They didn. Really? Yeah. didn. didn in in terms a, the way he solved the crime.


The way way They saw them. Yeah. That is What. I was the last two minutes. Hey. He dragging That to the last two minutes. He gonna see the hair pin on the floor connected to something earlier.

And I thought I was a genius. When I told a producer, yo, try to flip this. Matlock Ford Me. Yeah, Yeah. Fuck y'all. Let's see, What else. Ish important or unimportant out There Life.


Jennings says That. He tried to do a Tiny desk. Tiny desk. Yeah. Tiny Desk says That. He s not a big enough act to do. Tiny Desk. That's S not fair. That's Fucked up. Where does Everybody stand on That? That's s Not fair. They've had smaller artists on their bunch. Yeah, Let Who let, I'll bring it up. But you Don I. Don't know off that top. 'cause s go to look at 'em. I'm let I don't really know. What That is And and let I how many records like Jen had let Two or like in another genre, That you just might not have been familiar with. No, that Life Jen's album was amazing album. Classic album, right? There Hood Classic, right? There It is right. There It is right. There Ford Everybody Ford Now Hood Classic Ford sure all About the city and and Come on music. But tell me What That first. like Jen album.


good. don don The Classic and I Love. like no. I said It's right. There I said it's a hood classic. That That first like Gen album. I I won't argue that. But classic I Don't Know is s not a classic. And maybe the smaller acts that didn tiny Deaths. 'cause I'm sure Parks s right. About That. Maybe they we relevant current smaller acts That may be true. Like life Ish from My Day Our Day or When didn. They Didn s go Away. Ford a while Life. Yeah, but I don't think he ever returned. Yeah. With, Because he just went on tour. We. He Ish on tour. Currently I. Think We. not just That, When didn. Those smaller acts do it like What Tiny Desk was then. And maybe Me Down. No, there's still, I'm I. I'm not gonna I don't wanna sound like I'm shitting on nobody. So I'm not gonna Names Now, but There's a bunch on Here.


That. They have 8,000 views. You know, What, I'm saying let, like they're not the biggest a artists Gotcha. Okay, But we, they like artists that had something kind a going on at a time. As Someone who keeps tabs on shit outside a even hip hope or whatever. In the music industry, I'm not familiar with a lot a, these artists Got it and some a 'em I am familiar with it. It's s like they don't really, don don't know how they got up. Here got no disrespect. Got it, Got it, Got it. I'm on the fence. I'm on both sides. a this argument. I do I do agree I think Tiny Desk has had smaller acts and Let life come up. There that platform looks let Life Live Band a guy that could really sing and he's got enough music to where if you're unfamiliar with some a these maybe you gain some new audience.


So Now, it could be a situation. I'm sorry to cut you. It could be a situation where It maybe just didn't come out the greatest and they just used that as an excuse. You think they taped It? He made it sound like he reached out and They didn they turn It down. That Wrong, sorry. Now on the other side. I do think that I do think That companies reserve the right to run how they feel like running Ford? Sure. Or, or I'm on that side. They do a Great job over There or just evaluate the return. It's lot a artists that be trying to come up Here and Yeah. I mean there's no nice way to say It. But no, you're not big enough to come up Here.


You either Got be big enough to come up Here, which I don't wanna sound let, that's that That part a. The criteria. So, or you gotta be liked or people gotta want to get, we gotta want to know. You want to get to know you liked your song or something. let that. But other than that, I'd rather pour into My cast than pour into one a. Y'all out There. That's just Hey. It is It is one we overlooking too. That it could be with life. And not saying It is It is the case. But he could have pissed somebody off. True. Because this Ish the relationship. That is What it sounds like. like And that's just the excuse That they gave him. But whoever we got a relationship with might not fuck with you. Go I ain't gonna front or something. Somebody this don't even sound let how tiny desk would turn you down.


right? right. Unless What You it saying Ish. Ish kind a accurate Yeah. Yep. It could be somebody on your team. It could be. 'cause you'll have somebody up Here based on the relationship Often. You know What. I'm saying sc call you or somebody call you that you And It Got be a relationship. That's home team. right. And it Got It Got be some type a relationship. You know What S SC called me the other day. About something. That is My man. That is My man. gotta do It. That's My man. Yo Got do It, you know, I, Love, Dola and his and his wife and Gabby. Lemme see. Lemme see. Let me see What else. What else. Ish important or unimportant life. Jennings R goes after you. Hopefully you do get That is. Yeah, What else. Ish important or unimportant. We never talked About it Kendrick Perkins having his N I L deal company and I wanted to get y'all thoughts on it.


That's amazing. You said it's amazing. That's an amazing concept, right? right. Ford, those who Don know tell me, you know the college athletes can Now sign a name, image and like this deal Okay. So Kendrick Perkins Ish signing Ish starting a company where basically I give you a upfront amount. Ford a piece a your What was It all time earnings Yeah. Mm. Wow. That's That is where Ish. He where Ish. He from Texas. I think he he was a basketball player. Yeah. No I know who he Ish but where Ish he from I. don. don Got it. you Don have no idea where he Ish originally from. That's smart. I mean this. It is, it depends on What. The splits are too. It depends on the splits. But It is, It is let We talk We talk label talk.


Sometimes. Ish It. Is it in perpetuity? let forever That that. I'm pretty sure it'll be in, in whatever deal y'all make. So it It could be, it might not be I. Don't know Ford. Sure. Mm. We what's the problem? This Ish the thing like I used before. 'cause we, we touched on it before in pre-Pro in Prepo, they we saying It was kind a Predatory Inventory. Predatory. I. Think It just depends on the terms. I think It depends on the actual athlete. like I think the, the money matters. I think that When somebody puts out their money Ford a product. They're the person that's taking a risk. So if I'm prepaying you Ford, whatever, you could break your leg.


I don't get My money back or you cannot not produce and I don't get My money back. So I think I I. Think It is it is It is 50 50. It is It is a way to look at it. As long as there's big money somewhere someone's gonna middleman it. Absolutely. That happens everywhere in every field. Damn near. So it's unsurprising. It's unsurprising. And it's s not necessarily predatory. It could be great Ford the you Got a sense a talent. It depends. It is It is It is it is a case Bye case basis. Absolutely. Whatever you negotiate honestly. And if he gets some talent, That isn't maybe as no It it. It could be a great, that Might Other officer on table might. good idea. Yeah, it It really depends. Let Everybody not Angel Reese. Everybody. not Shado Sanders.


Everybody, you know What. I'm saying there's some smaller cats that might go to some smaller D ones that could use a hundred grand, that could use 200 grand and you could potentially bring a a smaller market, an advertising dollar That they would've never gotten. And Now because I put 'em together. let Steve Stout said Steve Stout says he's taking the artist and he's taking the advertising and combining them Brought together. Yeah. So I think, you know, Has There ever been a player under the radar that end up killing it in the NBA? That was under the radar. A million People. Oh End up He the stars. People Go undrafted and and mad nigga and end up He A star. Yeah. Shit the joker Jokers jokers More the MVP Got it three years row Got. it was a second real pick.


Yeah. So that kid. Same with football. With football. So they could work out Ford Kendrick then It Could Yeah. It Could Got, it could, it could What. Do you guys think About Kamala Harris trying to appeal to the black vote, the black male vote I. Think it's smart. Maybe a little bit too late. I think It should have been done a lot earlier. Shout to her and Brian I mean this how Long, but this s like like a very short, short campaign. The points or whatever this shit Ish, That She had said. So we not just talking out our Ass I. Think I. Think What Obama has proved I. Think even in the last election, What has been proven. Ish That the black vote Ish really It really matters. like again until they counted all the votes in the urban Atlanta area until they counted all the votes in the Philadelphia area.


Georgia and Pennsylvania are, which are two swing states. We still up in the air and When. They started counting all those votes in the inner city. This shit won Georgia and one pa. So I think That their teams should be in instructing them to appeal to us. Yeah. I I I have the policy That they're looking to create. It says to provide 1 million. Do 1 million loans. That are fully forgivable. Up to 20,000 Ford black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. good support education, training and mentorship programs. That lead to good paying jobs. Ford black men including pathways to become teachers, protect cryptocurrency investments. So black men who make them know their money. Ish Safe launch a national health initiative focused on the illnesses that disport, excuse me, disproportionately impact black men legalize recreational marijuana and create opportunities Ford black Americans to succeed in this new industry.


I think it should have been launched in August. So You it saying it's just too late to do It. Now. It is, it may be kudos to the White House. He incredibly gracious to me and kudos to you. I She Love to do We When didn. Her campaign officially start though though. That's What. I was About to ask I think that She got thrown into the fire. Yeah. And had to scramble to work shit out and Now some a These things are just settling. So Now, we putting some, some new initiatives out. I. Think When When didn Biden drop out When Didn. like June or something. It was the summer. No, I'm just saying It was the summer. So I know It was late. It was late. So I don don know It was a time She didn't have enough time. like yeah they was gathering they thoughts basically. And Biden dropped out July 21st. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it should have been launched in August you think? Because the women demographic She had on let that day that they made him step down.


Sororities went crazy in raising capital. Yeah Yeah, the women Didn. So the black male vote Ish needed and because a lot a men are leaning towards Trump A lot. a black men are leaning toward Trump. I think they should have been attacked a lot earlier though. Do you think maybe they didn't count Ford. That like just out the rip they I thought They probably thought they Are on have a black male vote. Yeah That is Sweep the black vote period. I agree with that? Yeah. What. You think I hope it works. Yeah, me too. I'm not paying any mind because My vote Ish already made. Gotcha. I vote My. So gotcha How didn black men vote in the last two elections. The Trump, the one that Trump won and then Biden a Lot a men silently voted Ford trump a lot. a Black men voted Ford Trump and Now in the polls.


Black men are leaning, are leaning towards heavily Trump leaning. I mean not, probably not the majority. But he's getting that's a good portion. He's getting a nice portion. a the black male vote Part a. The polls and I know friends a mine, like I'll argue with one a My niggas damn near weekly he didn seven years in jail. He just came home. He been home not even a year. And When t tell you he Ish pro-Trump on a different level. Yeah. It's a different level. So you know what I mean? I mean hood dudes. They really fucking with Trump. Yeah. So It is, It is gonna be interesting to see how it Hands out. It is gonna be a lot tighter than we initially thought too. Yes. I agree. It is gonna come down to I. Mean. I. Your mind. Your mind made up Yeah. I won't ask I feel like it's invasive. I'll support And you got a few more months a trying to get that Trump money or the other side's money.


No, no matter I. gotta a question. It is a wrap. I got a question. I gotta a question. Ford. You too. Hold on. Just, just to answer your question from 2020, this says most black men supported Biden, but overall Democrats have noticed that they've been losing black male support since 2008. Yeah. So it's been dwindling. So Yeah, they they kind a that Shoulda on some point. Yeah. Go ahead. Philipp me. Question. Good I done this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Okay. I had a question. Ford, you I stay at your business over There in That that world That you in. Yeah. What, Ish, It called finance, world finance, financial literacy and When. How would do financial Literacy, Oh, whatever. I'm sorry. I do investing. Pardon me? You do What. Investing.


Investing. How do you deal with the attacks? That some a your counterparts, you know, get, how do you deal with It? Because you seem like a nice guy. Very humble, they're very knowledgeable. Yeah. And When, you see these things and the attacks. Do you feel, let you become involved in It? Are you involved? Do you, do they group you up in It or you just Yeah, Sometimes I get lumped in. But the thing that I always try and tell people. Ish let, if you're consistently hearing the same message, there's truth in it. So even When, if a bunch a attacks come, I'll get on the phone with some a them content creators and say we What. Should we do different? He got the clipping me up. He done laugh. I bro. Hey What.

I'm saying let, it's frustrating yourself if, if, if if if you, But if you Here Ford a year, there's some truth somewhere that you need to fix. But What, I'm saying Ish that if, if say if people That you are associated with Ish He accused a something and you're looped up into that, do you look internally or you just writing shit down on how to ub?


No. I got a vet too. I got a man. My main connector Matter got locked up. That was My friend Okay, they tried to loop me in and say I knew What some a the bullshit. He was Doing, I'm let, I'm rich. I ain't know nothing About that bullshit. He was Doing. Okay Got it. So you cool Got it Okay. But I gotta face It opposed to running from It and be let. So You face It Yeah, you gotta face This shit head on. Got it Got face It head, head on you Don Become an Uber driver and stuff. let That do things different. You go straight into it. Nah, My fault like CAEs pen, You Got. Look Joe leave like Caesar peanut. Why didn you? Why didn You single me It should mail out and say we different. 'cause you have an angle. There, but you Don. I didn't catch It. I don't have an angle. I just believe how y'all three react to criticism. Ish different than hmm how me Ice and Parks, we had criticism.


It wasn't deep. Joe I think you let It though C I know you do Yeah. I mean I. Think I know You think That but No, You Don. Does anybody agree with me? Do you think that Joe likes that Likes the criticism You Don think he let I don't he like the Criticism I don't think he like the criticism. I just I think he knows how to handle it. we He ain. But Everybody s not him. I. I think he hates it. Actually I think Joe I think Joe sees the bigger picture. And as long as the bigger picture and the engine Ish still moving, then didn take That as It comes with the territory. It is part a the gig. And some people are able to disconnect easy in others. let Ice Ice will just disconnect. That's something That he that he Ish. Parks you don't really pay attention to the internet. No I do, but you Don Yeah. But you I don don Pay attention to the I On internet.


all know me. Emotion, you disconnect. You don't Let that You Didn. Yeah, I don't. But I've learned to And Don appreciate About 20 years in this. That's I'm saying I've Learned to appreciate how Everybody handles things differently and in their own way. So I, don't say it, Not maliciously to Judge, not I Got it. I say It just because it's something to be mindful. a But you came up Here and said That, we should have a character to put out to the audience, right? But then if we have a character, how will we be able to show our real selves? People connect with authenticity. They like When you your real self. So if we put a character There, let, that's What, that's What My problem. Ish Ish the character and the me and the, and the real me. So That would, I can speak from personal experience.


My character, That, I'm putting up There and then me in real life. This shit s not easy. They totally different people. You know what I Mean. When people approach you in the street and approach. You expect Your Character. It is not easy to deal with. So then What do you say to that My father said, yo, you signed up Ford It, you have to be you. You signed up Ford this, you wanted this. You have to know how to navigate through it. Wise words from a decent man, Yeah. I couldn't agree with your father. Man, That's What. He said to me, let you can't get mad at people. See What Flip does Flip flips case because he created that character. True, true. He created That character. That is you put that character out, That you benefited from that character. That is I didn. So Now, you can't Now turn around, can't turn it Sometimes Let you Got take everything that comes with that character that you put out. There. But sometimes the character's s not just the character's more a a persona, you know, What, I'm saying let I don't have a character.


Gimme I. let gimme I don't have a character like What. He's created I have more a, a persona That I've created, you know, in terms a, you know, just He poised and composed and sexy and whatever all that other shit. Ish, but When I'm in say you Don know baggage claim and I just got a phone call that you know, a loved one has cancer. I don't wanna be who you think I am at That very moment, I mean. So those are the, those are the navigational kind a you know, That is an moments where It just It is, It is extraordinarily complicated. That, that's an extreme But. yeah, That That was, But I mean. But it but it, but That happens frequently and that's why so many celebrities will be let you know, they get approached Bye somebody who they want you to be who they believe you to be in That moment and When, you just have a When.


You just got bad news or you're having a bad day. True. And you don't react the way That they hope. True. Then they get online and they're let yo I met so and so, they're a piece a shit true. Blah blah blah. And that's When. You say the whole, you signed up Ford It. I'm almost, let not, I'm still, you're still a human. He at a end a the day, right? And There needs to be a little bit more respect paid to the fact That. But don't we have to be mindful. Look, What didn, we I didn the Malay Koch. not Macaulay Koch. What's It guy? That passed away the short guy recently. No, he passed away a long time ago. Cory Feldman. The one Co What you talking About Willis. Oh, Gary Coleman, Gary Coleman, Dick Gary Coleman. Gary, Gary Coleman You know what I mean to be identified as That character. A character That. He's built over the years to be identified as that When. He just wanted to live his life.


Look, look, What, It didn to him his life. let these things That happen. Where? I, I, I'm just saying no. Should you comparing you Mel and It is to Gary Coleman. No, I'm not comparing no I that no, but I think, I think you so fucking rude. Why you so fucking rude? No I end the fucking major. No. In all reality, the thing Ish When, we speak About. Male male flip might be a little bit 'cause a My size. Oh Shit. That's racist. Oh. Shit. That's funny. You do look like Webster I got you back. That is might be Webster y You Let say Now I Got Spa. I'm gonna check use My black card. M like let male, male has a Ish. Mixed male has a, so you call it a persona where her professional male professionalism, a how She speaks and puts a I.


Think it's a character on, on the podcast or on her shows. That. I may have watched It is not the same. How? How Mel Ish behind the scenes. Mel s not That. Sophisticated behind the scenes nigga Mel on some bullshit Lies in treachery will get you nowhere. No Joe. Keep it real man. Yo not that sophisticated. Behind the scenes you don't use none a those big ass words. I on I. I. I might be a little gangster. Yeah you right? not we, not gangster, but You. right, not That. You s not This. shit. Shut up. E I think we should all be mindful a the energy and personas that we put out. True. right? Even Ford. Me When I was going through and I'll call you. let yo, why all this you like some a It. You said it like yo some a It is you motherfucker, all these people not attacking you 'cause you an angel and then you learn how to be softer, more gracious with people and a lot a This shit go away.


I Think it's kind a unfair coming from Joe though. And I because he has so many experiences and so many years. let he fought through it. That's just how I feel. I know. He don't like to hear This shit. It's a crock a shit. Nah. I. You fuck through it though. Joe I. Think What I said stands I think that you fought. You just look at It, let yo the gig. Ish the gig. You was at a beginning. Remember What, you went through nigga half the people ain't go through What. You experienced half the people ain't go through it. The TV shit and all, all This shit going down, bouncing up. Niggas ain't experienced That. Your wounds, your wounds made you who you are today. So imagine you, you took all the wounds, Ford, Everybody and niggas coming in fresh. And then we going through What. You've been through, you know how to navigate through the battlefield a lot. a niggas don't know how to navigate through the battlefield. That's just What. It is. And then you put this, not don, don't say I, don't wanna say expectation but you say Yo you guys should do it like this and do It like that.


And I, I do agree with you 'cause When you say It, It makes sense but It is not as easy as you say It is. Oh had you make it seem That is you see and Now Now to to My the the way I treat it. I have experience. 'cause I've been on the other side a It Oh Yeah. Yeah where you we a troll Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's really It Ford me because I've been on the other side. a It. I can identify these people Yeah. So I know one, y'all don't mean This shit. Y'all saying which Ish, why When? You're out and you run into people. It's all Love. It's all Love. Yep. True. Like you just said, you right haters. Yeah. Once you reach out to them. Yeah they do What t tell you all the time. That is What. I'm saying they just want acknowledgement. Acknow. What you meant they just want Hey.


Look at me. Now unfortunately I say this I feel like I feel like a broken record. Yeah negativity stands out more. It does. Absolutely. Y'all can sit There and read the comments and read this and it'll be a thousand people praising you. You don't even see It. But once That, one person Ish on your ass. Yeah. You see That, they know and then you reply to That, they know you reply to That. So It feeds them. So It says Okay, let's stay on his ass so we can get replies. Right? That's What. I'm About to say let and It is a game once you show people to me anyway, What grinds your gears. Yeah. The people That enjoy grinding gears. They, it's coming to grind your gears. I'm one a, those I enjoy a little gear grinding balls Yeah.


So if I see that, that piss you off. I used to have the same fight with My My girl. Yo, check that bitch. we, why didn't you gonna know That this Ish a checkable offense. Yeah your response Ish Legend heavy. Yeah, that's s good. I'm trying to get that off. No, That is right, right, right. you right. That's true though. I ain't saying that no Wait works with her. But that's My thinking. I My. Think if I Let the girl know that this Ish grinding your gear. Girl's, you who I care About a course not her. Who I don't I agree with you then Now, we've allowed somebody who don't matter and Ish inconsequential A our household. What's The difference? What's the difference between that and like establishing a boundary and a boundary With who? Stranger. These fuckers don. don.


Strangers. Yeah. Yeah. They Don Dog. you Don know we see That. I was just Yeah, boundary with strangers. let don't get. How do you enforce that with a stranger Can in the moment? a, your interaction you Let them know I'm not the motherfucking one, two, or three. So What, Ish, Okay. So all they gonna do, come on. So let's play that out. Sound What, does That say to the thousand people that just watched you do It that just wanna re wanna reply from you? What, does That say to them, who wouldn't get attention? Who would never normally get the reply? Yeah, but because you just told them I'm not one, two or three. What does that tell them Okay the way to get her to reply Ish. To do What. Yep. We. That's true historically, I have always turned the other cheek. I have taken the high road so many times I get nosebleeds.


So that's usually My Mo stay There, I just kind a got a little fed up with This shit. So hence Spicy. Mel has been around Ford a little while, Right button and I ain't gonna hold you speaking. Ford me. I'm not shooting at nobody. Here, I'm not shooting at none a y'all. Even though we talking About this Now, you Don forgot the shot. Anyway, couple a shots. Fuck I About to say no I wasn't shooting at junk. Oh, podcasters in general that complain. About this type a shit to me. It just sound like When. The the spoiled rich white kid in school. Ish fucking complaining. About some shit. I was just saying When, y'all outside. I've tried to think a, a simpler gig than this.


Yeah I can't like if you niggas s not not you niggas. If people, if people can't fucking deal with What comes along with podcast in this new boom that happened to come About. We people, we privileged enough. It is a blessing. That is we privileged. That is a fact and blessed enough to work somewhere twice a week. not counting anybody's side gigs. Everybody got side gigs. The weird economy, Ish Everybody needs side gigs. That's true. But I think this Ish a pretty good gig. So it's s like the people. That is all they out There complaining. They called me this, they said this About me.


It's s like, yeah, but are we just totally discounting the blessings? True? And the more words Are we moving the blessings to the side? And it goes back to What. I said About focusing on how negativity just standing out more you right. not even looking at all the positive shit because you right focus on the little bit a negativity My life has changed too much. Yeah too drastically. Yeah. Quickly Ford me to worry. About What, Becky 4, 5, 3 thinks About things more The words. That, Tyler, The. Creator man. It is log Out. No, no. That is a good fucking cyber bully. Nor are There many people that Dave said worse things About than me.


Yeah, Yeah. Ford, you Yeah Let develop a fucking thick skin. Put the fucking phone down, ignore them niggas. I'm going back to My normal life. Flip. You be outside. So, and y'all be outside. So I can't speak to that because if It takes me, locking myself in a room, I will I understand What You, right? If It takes me locking myself in a bathroom or closet, if My problem Ish outside, then I will I have committed life to this thing. But that's the thing. Joe the problem. s not outside. Because once again, When, you see people outside, they cool as hell. It is Love. Love. They're buying you drinks and water. It is all Love sending you charcuterie boards.


Yeah. That is What. I'm saying problem only Ish. It is too much Love to even focus on, on, on the head. And I'm gonna ask you a question. And if you I, got you. And if you talking to a large enough audience, then You, right? Gonna get some hate. It comes with It. let, I'm, I'm prepared. I'm prepared. Ford. That like It kind a fuels me. Pardon me a little bit. What didn. You think You right gonna be You, right? Gonna be honest if I ask you this question, I Got hear a question first. I wanna reserve the right to lie at all. Excuse Me. So Listen That is honest. So this Ish where the confusion comes from. You Got keep a lie. talk This Ish where the confusion comes from. Even When, it comes to you, right? So I can speak Ford, me and you. like if you engage and I I told you We I I say It sometimes engage with people that are saying things, About the gig or me, right?


And What, aren't you giving them credence to keep going? let 'cause you are the head a the crop, right? So you, you the head a the ship you are engage with people. Yo, we don't like flip, flip Ish Doing. This That nigga's annoying you. You s not saying anything, but you're There, you're listening. I'm present. You're present. You're not saying That anything. Yeah. And I let and I let recently learned That. Y'all don't let that. Yeah, we I didn't, but Now. I don't give a fuck 'cause I get It. I let recently learned That. I understand. I understand it because blessed to know I. Understand it. Now, you know what I mean? That's s like the same thing. When I was Doing interviews and fifth probably didn't like me sitting with Smurf or talking to his son. Yeah. Even though I'm defending fifth, he's saying like, why would you even sit There in the first place knowing that I'm going through this. It's just a I guess. It is I. Don't know if it's an old school mentality thing. I don't know.


But even with you, like if You right sitting There talking and they feel comfortable, wouldn't that give them more ammunition to keep going? Joe. Joe was with us. Joe. Listen to us say It. So Let us keep saying It. So then, But but look at It like this. And it may still hurt, but When McMahon was selling Austin versus Ena or Austin versus Rock. He'll Listen to them say, Austin sucks, but true. WrestleMania, You M right? Still fucking draw is s not the same. let crazy I May not exact same. That example was Brought to me too. Same. But That example was Brought to me too. Yeah like you Got look at It as Joe. It is Vince McMahon. not personally wise, but like as hope not, you know, Joe. Yeah, I to clear that.


But it gives the audience, let nigga we speak to Joe, About it. Nigga who the fuck are you? We speak to your, your boss. Yeah nigga, we don't give a fuck how you feel or nothing. So we gonna tell him how we feel. We gonna say It and we gonna go a little further. Yeah. Yeah. Because we, you know, sometimes the boss give people ammunition unintentionally. So What, do you say to That, When, I say that like, even if we don't, even, even if I don't like That What do you say your intent like, like What do I say What your intent. s like What. Do you say About? That. How? How It comes off to people. That it matters to We. Listening to how you feel. About. It or how you felt About It I felt Yeah. I don't Feel and I know Ish may had mention a it before Mel feel let She want make mention a It. But don't I don't know. But I let receive I.


let receive how y'all feel. About, It, I. Don't give a fuck. Yeah, I, let that I don't give a fuck. About it. Should You Give a fuck? No. Why not at all? I shouldn't give a fuck. Why? If Ford her, if we're talking About, We we it's a full circlet. It's a full It is a full circle moment, right? There's a lot a great research in criticism. There Ish. You started with that? Yeah. Yep. You started with that. Yeah. If you on a stage, if you on a public stage, and again we starting with all the blessings. Yeah. I'm starting with the blessings facts. Same. If you on a public stage there's that has afforded you those blessings, then you should feel good enough to be able to hold it down.


When the other side starts coming. Yeah. I feel like that. One, two engagement. Ish engagement. It don't say good, good engagement. Yeah. It don't say praise. compliment, compliment, compliment. Stok a Engage lot more than fans. Engagement Ish. Engagement You. right? Talking to somebody that through the down years a his career My engagement has always been better than the A level in premier acts. Because I'm There. Just because I'm There. I don't have to be talking About nothing. Oh. Shit. He didn. It is like When. I'm in the strip club on a Thursday night and one a the fucking niggas in the project say, yo, you Here. Yeah.

And even if they come in a bad shape box or bad built, damaged box. It is all a blessing. Yeah, who the fuck Ish? Anybody? Here. Ford. People to be talking About, myself included. Now, I've done enough Ford. How many years where I gave 'em enough to talk About. But in, in the grand scheme, a things Yeah, everybody's insignificant. Yo, who the fuck are Y all?

I may be a little bit or a lot more erratic, but they, he understands a lot of times, A lot of times he understands where I'm coming from. So it's easy to diffuse the situation. Y'all understand? I seen that before. You shouldn't handle it this way. Even Parks Parks, I don't give him a lot of credit, but even times he pulled me to the side and he'll say like, yo, I seen that. I seen that behavior before. Yeah. Try this way You know what I mean.

Same way Michael Jordan ever got called Ford a foul. you know what I mean? like there's some shit that's inherent but think It is a that You think it stepped up Now with with I. Really think it's more a That I. Think a people just putting a lot lot a it on the betting. Maybe I could be naive but I think it's just certain people are gonna get certain calls or not get and You It. Gonna blame It on the betting Part. But you don't think the gambling market He so big Now like at one point in our community, I think gambling will surpass passive investing as a primary investment vehicle.


I agree with you. That's True. It is coming. Not Now. It might be That Now. It might be that Now in our community. What talking And conversations that didn be having at Bank. They're like bro, In our communities bro that might That is I ain't gonna lie. That's a thing. Now I didn It ain't Too far off that stock market.
