Y'all missed your text. Did you? Fucking dad wife got in a car accident. Oh my God. Is she okay?


Is she all right? I know how he feels because I, I get like this. She all right. He's not wrong. Like you just start to look at shit around you. Like Yeah, you look at your kids. He's right. He Called. He called, he called this morning with how much the insurance will put on the renter card. Nigga. I knew that yesterday. Okay. When you called yesterday, I knew that they only had $50 for you a week for that rental card. That's not $30 a day. It's a day. You lie 50 a week. I've heard black people go through this beef for years about what the insurance company is willing to put on your renter car. $30 A day. It Depends on your policy. If the insurance company clearly don't never been to the rental car place, They don't get, they want you to get the key $30. Get it done.


Right. What you don't realize is what that 30 gets. You Niggas always wanna go to the rental, get the fly shit. Yeah. No nigga, that's $70 A day, nigga. I Didn ain't even know the rental had other plates. Oh, other joints. Oh. Want fly Shit, nigga. Now you get a little bullshit, nigga you can get a hell cat. Damn. You Right. They got the shit there. That shit. So they cover the 30 and you play the, you play the rest, the, yeah, you pay the difference. Wait, so when I go rent a car, when I go down south, I, we, somebody does it for me. So they reserve the fly shit. But when I get there and they start naming the fly shit, I don't be knowing what It is no more. Like when they named the BMW, we got to act such and such and such, I make 'em take me to go see it so I could get eyes on these motherfuckers.


But Anyway, back to Mariah, Mariah, Mariah. Yes. The Legend. We tell Mark to write Mariah tribute on the board. Mark says, oh my God, I thought she died. I was about to be Oh my God. So fucked up and horrible. Oh, I was about to. He said that Which led into a, oh shit. You was about to be that fucked up. If Mariah died. Hell yeah. Conversation. I Would've as well. Yeah. Somewhere In that. And I don't like This. I I feel like we got like, knock on wood, knock. So Wood, we love Mariah. Somewhere in that, somebody brought up who Mariah was dating. Mark did rumored to be dating. I didn rumored, Rumored, rumored to be dating. And then Mark said, well, Bunch of hate, A lot of hate Asked me what I thought about that because I said, damn.


You said what? I said, I didn't know I had a shot all that time. I didn't even hear that. But that's bad. That's why they were laughing. Yeah. He said, you let Terry bowl. Yeah. So I just want y'all to know how ignorant we've been and this. Oh, and then Ian chimed in. Oh yeah. And say that he would never, he would never touch Mariah. But, but, but I'm not, I don I don't disagree with him. It's some people that no matter how good they look, it's something about them that can make you say, I'm not attracted to this person. No matter how famous they, but that's not what he said. That's not, he said though she was younger. That's what he was saying. No, he said she was too old, basically. No, he did not say that. Yes, he what? He's right there. He did. He said that I would not fuck Mariah Carey.


He said she fell off. Yes. Yeah. He literally said she Fell off. That means she's too old or, or she's not in the condition she would be in to meet Ian. Standard sex. She's not prime no more With superstars. And Joe said, which sounds ridiculous now, Ian, you tried to fuck the up becoming singer. He red. He put a name on it, put a name on. He already on my shit list. I Ain't got time for no more. Fucking Ian. Who, which one put a name on the bully. He started thinking you can't just throw shit out there like that on that man. It's probably be waitresses. I could threw a name, but I wouldn't have done that.


I mean, it might not be appropriate. Now listen, some people See that would be topless the older that they get. Oh, not saying Mariah Mariah's beautiful. I think she's amazing. But some you see, you, you lose that, you lose that attraction to them. Like people be full. This is what I'm saying. Niggas be full of shit. Niggas be full of Shit. Did you think that you, this is my only question. You didn't think you had a shot at Mariah before? No. Because who would? Right. How can you do that so much? Yeah, You do that so Much. She put a cape on, nigga warn woman. And it makes it seem like I'm suppressing you when I ain't Warn woman, take your shit off. Yo. I'm cornering your man. You Don't need help. When I was single, I, I liked my chances with just about everybody. There we go. There we go with, with a very small, come on Big Ma talk that shit.


We go, go who you thought you couldn't get at when you were single? Gotta be somebody that Brian Carey, Hallie Berry. She like you smart niggas. You probably would've, you never, I never thought about her in that way. Oh see, not in this. No. Let me put that. Oh, you just lying. No, no, no, no. Not, I mean, what I mean is never thought about it. Never looked at her. Oh, she's attractive now. Wow. I never saw that. No, that's not what I mean. I mean like, I've been very, I've been friends with two people that she's dated pretty good friends with one of them, so. Got it. She's not, she's in the category of like, that's my man's girl. So I just didn't think about like having a shot. I, I'm not, I she, I don't think about having a shot. You just pop. I didn't know you could put bullshit On bullshit.


But Yeah, this time you gotta double up. See how effective It is. See how effective that shit is. Bullshit. Alright, Flip. Go ahead and be sensible with this Mariah trick. No, wait, hold on, hold on. Before we get into that, listen, there's some women out here and some celebrities name of women that some niggas could say no to. I don't like how y'all was on Ian. All you guys attacked the poor man. And if he says yo not, he's not poor. If he says, yo, look, listen guys, I am not attracted, I wouldn't sleep with her. You guys supposed to respect that. I didn't like what you guys did. There's Too much of that going on. You have to Call your friends out when they're lying.


Yeah. Sometimes Niggas Lying though. He's lying. Because IG I've never hung out with Ian one day in my life. And I guarantee you he's had at least three nights of very unmemorable, mid regrettable. Fuck mid. I ain't talking about mid, below mid Reggie. So, but we all, we all have mid and Ari at one point in my life. But Carrie's The line. If he would catch some of them boys in the sauna slipping. And I think Mariah has a shot Catch some of them who? Wait, wait, what happened the ball up? What the boys the fuck Ian you, what you was into, because Me and Ian talk FaceTime every morning, but as soon as he get in the sauna, It is time to hang up. And I know what his Plates out. I know what that sauna I What what them Sauna Club is about.


Stop. Oh shit. I'm just saying if some of the sauna niggas could catch 'em slipping. I think Mariah, Mimi got a shot. Right. Lemme ask you a question. She get it done. Lemme ask You a question to, to me. Shout out to Mariah. I mean a lot of people changed their, like for Mariah when she started dating our brother Nick and I fuck with Nick came here. I think he fly, he get all shout out to Nick. That's, but I remember a lot of people saying that online and they didn't really know how Nick give it up. He gets him. But the, the optics of it was nah man, she fucked with that nigga. She, she fell off, which was not the case. 'cause niggas don't know how Nick carried it. So we ignorant like That. I, I gotta pitch myself a wild out nigga. I gotta, I gotta pitch for a while now.


You know I'm almost The way you know how to carry it. You're wildling out. Good word. I gotta solidify my spot. Whoa, You Low. But yeah, anyway, let's move on. Okay, well Mariah and the money long tribute, where was that? That was the iHeart Awards. Yeah, I Don know one of them. Shit. I was saying that one of them shits that we don't know about just pop up on. I was saying that Mariah threw shade that money long. And then I asked the question that but where Was that? That was the end Was Bill Billboard or the iHeart Or the Nickelodeon Awards. Right. Nigga That shit's not even around no more. The Nickelodeon Awards. Bmas Baby Lifetime Achievement Award. I don't know. Okay, so wait, one of them shits.


Why do you say that? She threw Shade? Did shes her face when she was singing her face Ex her facial expression wasn't, it didn't like she was too pleased. Yes, it was the iHeart Music Award. The iHeart Music Awards. She didn't look pleased. Wow. So then the next question I asked, I said it Was, it looked like she woke herself up with a fart. Like it was bad. And Then, and Then Corey proceeded to tell me that Prince was also, Wait a second. Yo hold all, nah Wait. Alright. I was looking for a way to be on Money Long Side. You can't shade me at the iHeart Awards. Yeah. Excuse me. Are you fucking crazy? No, that's where you are. You Fucking Nuts. No, that's where you shade.


That's where you shade The Grammys fucking crazy my nigga. You brought me outta my fucking castle for Nigga come out. You heard, heard what Nick told us. She don't leave the hou how, how much it cost money to leave the house. A quarter billion for her to leave the house. This Respectfully, with all due respect to the iHeart, It is many people in that iHeart building that I love and fuck with. So I'm not trying to be shady. If I get at tribute at the iHeart Awards, that's like me going on a rollercoaster at the fair. I expect for the toothless nigga down there to leave me up here elevated for longer than I'm supposed to be. I would expect for my tribute at the IR award to not be so grandiose.


Don't, don't call. What are you talking about? Don't call Double Dribble nine. Yeah, no. Yeah. That's like Amani calling foul offensive Foul in our street Ball game. Are you off the Waller by the way? I'm all with Mariah being a diva and I know that the divas can't cut off being a diva. So Yeah, you bring you wherever you go, but you at the fucking iHeart awards. Yo stop. Yo Listen, listen happen. Justin Hilarious could be up here doing your fucking tribute. Yo. What the fuck? Yo. I'm just saying, You know, they called Mariah and told her who was doing the tribute put, they gave her the whole shit to get her out her bed.


And I don't think money long and Money long is dope. I don don't know that. So money long is dope. I think the suss one coulda just called Mariah. Like Mariah's fly with a few niggas that we know not to Hop out though. I could be fly with you now you asking me to bring my, And she, she might be cool with Jewish niggas that run irr. Sure. She might own a piece of Ira. We don't know none of, we don't know none of her business. But if you get here and the, and the fucking tribute is not so Diamonds and pearls. Nah, stop it. I'm not gonna let you do this. When you big up Prince for doing the same thing with they Exactly. Nigga should Be tied him at the fucking MTV awards, Whatever that shit is. And I'm not gonna let y'all do that. I knew one of y'all was gonna say that. Well, so for one Prince has made it publicly clear to all to the whole field.


I'm against tributes. I'm not sure that Mariah hasn't either. Prince has said it. So before he died, niggas knew it didn't really matter who was doing the tribute. He didn't want a tribute. Yeah. So the fact that y'all kept doing a tribute against his will was like, okay. And now that we have the footage of seeing him shade people at the tribute, like we understand that's a mer song. His face and Nas Prince and Trait songs was up there. Fucking that song up re song was up there. He was ruining he that fucking song. He was, he was, I don't think Money Long was doing a horrible job. She Was not. She was not To s like that's part of the diva shit though.


It is. Ain't nobody gonna do a good enough. The question that I had earlier, You can't shame me at the fuck Out. The question that I had earlier was You out your mind, what Artists was satisfied with their tribute song or tribute performance that was dedicated to them? No one good. And then I said DJ Cassidy. No. Then I said, then I said Dionne Warrick was happy when Luther performed a tribute to her. 'cause she was extreme. She was crying. Yes. And then Cory was like, well that's Luther. But and it's also personal. They're they're friends anyway. Real man. Nah. Luther nos Luther bodi it bro. Don't try to sit that friend and Luther, he killed That shit. He did. But they gay. They also had a very strong personal relationship. Right. Like they did. So this was like seeing her like little mentee rise To fame. So if they didn't also Luter fucking ro.


Yes. If they didn't have a personal relationship, you think that she would be as receptive. She might not have been crying. She might have liked it. It's hard to hear somebody else do your song. You know what I mean? And always Love it. You know what I mean? I I I've seen people do Aretha. Aretha keeps a steady face. Yeah, she be tight. She was different. But Aretha's just like Prince Madonna did that shit. She hate that shit. She ain't like, but Madonna did that shit the fans got at, at Madonna for doing a Yes. Aretha Franklin tribute. I looked up and She should not have done that. I don read remember? And she shouldn't have done that. Right. Yeah. Some tributes are good. Obviously Bob Marley wasn't alive for his tribute. But the Rita, Rita Marley, the I Tree, all of them loved some of the rendition. They loved Lauren. Yes. They doing turn lights down low. Yes they did. Yes. They loved Erica and Ziggy Marley doing their joint. They loved Queen Latifah doing No more Trouble.


Like there there, there's some people who did it. Well nigga Michael. I was tell, I was telling Ice that Michael got up and performed his own tribute nigga. He saw Usher and what's her name doing it. He like, yo, sit down Whitney. Whitney bo it. When Whitney came out wanted be started something Whitney came out, she bodied it. But when he saw that shit, he said, lemme get up. My brothers just doing a horrible job. Lemme get up here and turn up. What It is. That part too tribute should improve It. Should Tribute should improve. But who, who, who do you put like how do you choose person Can't do like, like today They can't do it again. You want to get names that are going to attract viewership. Exactly. And a lot of these motherfuckers can't sing. They can't sing and they can'ts like They, they can't sing to the songs that they trying to And Then there's also mismatches.


'cause even in like hip hop, I forgot who, there's been a couple occasions like Lupe with Tribe or something. There was someone else who did, I forgot. I forgot the words. Didn't Know the like the Biggie songs, whatever It was. I forgot. That's bad. Didn't I said It Hop I've seen Fantasia do Fantasia did, did Patty Well yeah. And that's like her niece again. That's a love thing also. And also, but also she's got that register I was about. Yeah, she's got the register in the Range fan. Yeah. They both, they both like to holler. Like they both hit notes but holler like it's a style thing. It is a good fit. That was Rich Homie Quan, rest In peace. Rest in peace. Yeah. That was bad. And even thinking of that, why That was a bad match. I agree with Joe. Y'all need to update the tribute Need to update The talent nigga find somebody from America's Got Talent. Yeah.


Or something like that. Somebody that's gonna put, they Go for Star Power. Like actual Match Fit is there's some people out there on those shows that will body attribute. Absolutely. You know what I'm saying? Come on bro. They can't set. Now again, It is business. We can't sell that to the advertisers. Right. But we can sell, I got this name, this name, this name, this name. They Got Trace All Doing Prince. And that's right. Then I got the person that they doing the tribute sitting here in the crowd. What? Selling? What? I was watching where they tried the Stevie Wonder tribute Watch Recently. Yeah. Let me look it up. That Was really, really bad. It was so bad. I was like, yo, Stevie right there. Go get him. Bring him to the stage. Y'all let him perform at every other damn thing he shouldn't be performing at.


I think Janelle Monet was a part of that Tribute. She Was at the end of that. That Was No, that was, That was 2015. Janelle Monet was in a bunch of 'em. Yeah. Yeah. She has has To do. I think you have a ear for what sounds like, remember when, when, look, we Hot about this Baby face. Remember when Baby Face did his, his his tiny desk and he had people sing the songs that he wrote. He didn't match stars. He matched voices. Yeah. So like he did. So like he had Shante Moore singing Superwoman. So like that was perfect. Like that. She might have even improved on the Karen White version. I love Karen White's version. Right. They had somebody do, can We Talk, they had Tank Sing Tank can sing his fucking Face Off Tank can sing. Anybody under the table Tank should be doing these tributes. Like get the voices that match.


You know what I mean? Even if they're not the hottest name on the, you know, at the top of the billboard. Right. Today. Get legends or get people who can sing. Great. I think It is one. Piss the Legends off. That's it. But but Joe, you never answered your own question. What, which was Who would get you on the ground crying the way you said I was for Mariah if somebody died. Yeah. That's where the conversation went. Oh, We never even got to that part. Yeah. Who would be the people that would like get y'all doing that? Oh yeah, Because I didn't know I was saying to Mark and I'm clearly, I'm I'm the room is against me on this, which I'm fine with. I was saying I didn't know that Mariah Carey was at that level to where black men were saying, oh, if, if something happened to her, I would be totally distraught.


Right. Like I was saying, I thought that was reserved for like the legacy, legacy acts and I guess she is. She is. She's legacy. She is in the game. She is. Shit. More than that. More than that. I'm not, I don I don't look at her like a legacy act right now. I don remember the has a number one song every year. Like she's still Christmas joint. She's still visible. We still her we don't hear 'cause she's a diva. But I mean, I mean she is a legacy s she's a legacy actor. She's, she's One of Tops selling ax of all I Thought it Rich Fault for like our Stevie Wonders, the Mikes the Princes, the fucking Anita Baker. I think she's, I think she's in that she's in that Crews getting old bro. Like facts. The people who were crying for, for Luther and for even Michael.


Like they were younger. Michael was younger than Mariah is now, right? Yeah, he's 50. So yeah, Michael was 50. But Mariah gotta be in the mid fifties or 57. 57, 57. No, I understand what y'all saying and y'all are absolutely right. I do just think Mark is a liar. No, You never, You never know. Some of It is, I think like what was it that connected with you? Like when was it, how many Mariah albums do you have? I bought, first of all, just like, you remember you said in sixth grade you got vision love from there to the emancipation. I don I don't know anything after emancipation to Mimi, but that was, I was grown as hell when that came out. So from there to there I looked, I had every album. I used to love that Dream lover video. And if you stop the career that she's 55, not 57, it's a classic career if not classic career regardless.


Yeah. But I mean as a kid had a crusher Maria. Right. A legend. Not classic, but like legacy. Yeah, she's She's she's the top of the top. Yeah, she's, she's that, I mean for me it would be her, Janet Jackson. There's a few people that would get me upset. Paul. Like dude Janet Jackson, I get Yeah, but you don't get Mariah, They in the same class. I Mean y'all are helping me to understand. Stop. They're not in the same class. Yeah. Mariah Not. Mariah says she didn't like that. Wait a second. Mariah says she, they, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Yeah, You might be right. They might not be in the same class. They not in the same class. Respectfully To Janet. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Wait, well wait. What? No, he's saying Janet's higher. You're saying Ronnie Is higher. I I know what he's saying. I know what I'm saying. I'm saying they're both at the top of the food shit nigga. Janet is high. Stop it, it pops stop it. I don't know what y'all talking about now Jan is, come on. Stop.


It pops where y'all are. Well Wait is It is is Janet Y'all measuring? Is Janet considered, Is Janet considered higher by your standards because of the family that she's attached to all That? Janet is It is. Maybe Janet is considered higher by, i, I don't wanna speak for all black people but, but black people. Yeah. I'm not measuring the music careers. Oh okay. Like you could have a great point there. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Janet Jackson was in good times. Yeah, for sure. I'm saying Janet, Janet Jackson is like imprint. Imprint from, she was in different strokes of what I was talking strictly music. I'm talking about the family she comes from and how young she was when we for first saw her and I love them both by the way had a crush on both her Mariah me up in fucking 91.


I get it. Which is a long time Because three, four years ago. Yeah. But That's very different from 78. Understand what I mean when I say I'm saying the same. It is, It is like an NBA, right? Janet? No, Mariah. But carry on In the NBA Some people are max contract people. Right. LeBron's a max guy AD is the max guy. They not the same, but they both in that same top tier. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying that when I talk about Mariah and I talk about Janet, there's a top tier people who I'll be fucked up if they die. That don't mean they all the same in that same tier. Got it, got it, got it. That's all I'm saying. Got it. But not only that, you don't know what kind of impact that person's legacy and music had on you. Like it, it may not have the same impact on you that it would have on Mark. That's where the conversation was. And This is where Joe is full of shit. He last episode of Patriarch said he was in his mirror with a hairbrush singing vision of love and someday love time in sixth grade.


Yeah. That that's the shit that should have you cry. But then we also Morph. It was a someday for me. Which one was it? I Said, it's love takes time. Love Takes. Oh yeah. If you s that. Yeah, you, But then the conversation morphed into who Was anner Whatever. Who shoulda had an Effect on you? Shout out to all the queer youth out there. Go Ahead. Go ahead maam. No, then the con Marcus Sha Then the conversation morphed into whose death would or has had an effect on you that may not have had the same effect on other people. Like for me, it was people that we thought couldn't die For me. I'll give you, I'll give you, I'll give you two of mine. Anthony Bourdain and Philip Seymour Hoffman. When I saw that they passed away, I felt like, really?


I'm with you. But Anthony Bourdain, I mean, I just, didn didn't see what was up. I mean, I, like, I knew Anthony Bourdain. We worked together. I we shared desk space. Sometimes I didn't cry. Alright, Flex if you want to. No, No, I'm not flexing. I'm just saying like, I get, it was the sudden I'm, that's I'm talking about impact. It may not have had the same impact on you that he, that he and his career had on me. Mm. You know what I mean? That's fair to me. He's like upper echelon of like storytelling and just presence and, and intellect and all the things. Philip Seymour Hoffman was one of my like, top three actors of all times. So I was very sad that I was never Is He black? Is he black? No, Neither one Of black this guy, man. So he just naming white people in our, this guy.


Why he so racist in They trying to record me? My phone. Okay. Lemme ask. I'm go research. Okay. Alright. Wait. How, how many of us, how many of us were devastated? Look at who the fuck Mel is talking. How many of us were devastated when we heard Robin Williams died? Okay. Thank you. I was Thank you. Thank you. I wasn't devastated. I was sad though, but I was Okay. Maybe I'm putting, that's What I'm saying. Every was sad to me because of how he died. Well, but like, I was like A minute Wait too. Wait a Second. It's the tragedy a second. Both, both of them were Both Tragedies. Yes. I was sad when Robin Williams Died. I was sad as well. Okay, well Then some. Yes. I was devastated to learn that Robin Williams was home with his entire family. Went up to a side room, tied some fucking knot in the fashion that he did and did this with his kids and wife in the house.


That's devastating. Okay. And Anthony Bourdain more of the same. Did Philip Seymour drumming? Motherfuck. S motherfucking H He passed away. He passed. Nah, don't do that. He self transitions. I'm asking. He had, he died of a drug overdose. 'cause he had the same issues that Robin Williams had. And the same issues that Anthony, he did self transition. It was, it accidentally, it's all tragic. That's the point is it's all tragic. These are people that you, did you Cry? Yeah. Showed a Tear. It is levels tragic. Bothered me. It, it was really like, Like were you in the bed? Like, oh, I can't Believe no, I could move. I, I could Move on With my fucking life. Last time I saw him was mission impossible outta here.

Let me see, what do I have here that could be interesting. Could be interesting. Okay. And, and everything is on camera news nowadays. Mm. Mel sent something funny, but before Mel sent something funny, somebody else sent it to me. So I had already synced it. Okay. But then I seen something else and I think it was this girl from Portland got in a fight wherever she was from. This girl got in a fight and she got the brakes beat off her BPP, pew, pew, pew.


PP Was fucking this girl up. But in the process she dropped her key fob. Okay. So the girl she beat up took the key fob and apparently didn't know each other and went to her house and ransacked it the whole crib and taped it. Oh shit. No she fucked that house up, Broke the tv, the loser of the fight, everything. The loser of the fight her get back broke. Which made me wanna ask y'all which one you would rather be in that equation. The girl that got beat up. I'd rather be the the person beating up Getting beat up. No. Or the one, the aggressor. The aggressor?


Yeah. Okay. I'll give, I'll get beat up before you ruin my whole house. Yeah. I've been the other person Already that had Walked in the house and saw this shit. Shit fucked up. What you mean? Wait, so yeah, I'll take the other side. You saying wrong? You saying the little ass ain't so bad? Yeah, I'm gonna take the other side. You said you'll beat the who? I said I'll get beat up before I allow my entire house to be rented. The person got beat up was the one that destroyed the house. Yeah, that's, she got beat up, picked up the key fob and said Okay. Yeah I know. I'm saying rather than beat Up the house destroyed he would rather get beat up the choices between getting your ass beaten and getting your house but ran inside. No, I thought he was talking about the The outcome. That situation. The outcome of The entire Situation. It's not the same situation. No, because it's one that got, the girl that got beat up is the one who ransacked the house, not the one that beat up. Yeah, I know that.


So would you rather be the, would you rather get beat up and have a chance to go destroy somebody house or would you rather be, would you rather beat somebody up and have your house, somebody out have your house destroy up? Yeah. I'm confused why this is confusing. No it's not. You know he said wrong. Right. Alright, Thank you Alice. Don't, there's Alice and Betty. No, don't do that. Alice beat Betty's ass. Don't hype. Betty even went to Alice's house and tore it down. Do you wanna be Alice or do you wanna be Betty? He said yeah, but he said I'd rather nigga stop the fucking be on his I'm I'm saying I'm not gonna side. He said I'd rather get beat up than have my house destroyed. And that's the same, the person that got exactly, the person that got beat up destroyed the house. So how would you rather get beat up? Destroyed? Okay, wait, y'all wait because y'all saying my House.


But if you talking about the scenario flip. No I'm not done. If you're talking about the scenario that's at end, Listen, could we sounding like too off now? Like it ain't that deep. This is like the little meme. My scene, somebody was in Jersey City. These guys are very, and they was point a camera at people and it was like, yo James grandson is my son. Who is James? To me That shit fucked up, up was so confused because I feel like this is one of those moments. Right. It's not. I'm saying you're right and Mark is right. I'm saying I would rather get beat up than have my house fucked up. Have my house ran that the winner of the fight got her house ransacked.


Yes. Yes. The loser of the fight ransacked the house. Right. So your Choice Get up to lose the fight and go ran versus Yeah and go ran. Oh, so you're Not talking about my House be ransacked. He didn't switch it. He he didn't switch it. He saying the Same. He just said which person in the scenario do Wanna be. It's okay y'all okay? It's okay. It is Cool. Okay anyway. I have a question. I alright. It's seven fucking apples. Alright. Yo Y y'all told for real. But wait, there are seven people in this room. We all understand it on the right side. This, that's not, I have a question.

You'd be sitting there looking at when they was one. Oh shit. So speaking of this, this is part of my Bill Burr review. Okay. Bill Burr says something I thought was really interesting, which was why are we still having open caskets?


Oh, I Was with him on that a hundred percent. Yeah. And he while, yeah, that's while he was joking. The more he talked about it, I'm like, yo, that's totally correct. Why are we still having open caskets where we're forcing people to go look at some dead motherfucker lying there. Who looking may be made up Right. Or not be made up. Right. Mark? I said, and I'm I take your word. If you say that this person is dead, then they died. Like I don't need to see the proof right at the top of the fucking service. He gotta answer the text. So I believe you. Yeah. Open cast could just seem a little, I feel like you might know the history of why there's why we have open cast. It's cast S right back into fun.


Actually. It's a great way to find there. There we go. Oh, that's the Roomba vacuum him up. The fun Mark. What is the history of this? I mean, I'm just saying like in order to like, okay, fine, fine, fine, I'll back away. Fine, I'll back away. It'd Be interesting. That's that Philip Dresen more shit. What do y'all think about this? I've always thought that open caskets were really fucking creepy. Yeah, It is a really morbid episode. It really is. It is. Fuck it. I just think it's creepy for kids. It's creepy for everybody. It's Creepy. It is creepy for everybody. I eh, It is funerals I've been to It allowed you to, it's like that last bit of Closure. Wanting to say goodbye. I understand. Yeah.


Right. If the kid is old enough for they head to be peeking up, then that's bad. But you don't wanna See that. But if they small enough to wear, you don't even really, You don't know what's going on up in there. They should be ub they be having LEDs, the kids, they be having glass in that shit. Yeah, they be propped up. They be like, Alright man. Yeah. Your field person, they be in there. Oh, pro up. Alright, go ahead. Go ahead. Listen, take it away. No, I'm listening to you.


I'm listening to you. I'm with you. I don't like seeing that shit. That shit is Wagged. I like seeing it before it starts. I, I, yeah, the wake. So like, like yeah like when my dad died, you the night before you go, you look at 'em, you know, say your goodbyes whatever the next day. I don't feel the need to see 'em again. But See the pro, the problem now is 'cause everybody ain't got it. So you're doing it all in one shot. Yeah. Ain't no more. The wake used to be the night before. Right. And then the funeral was the next day. Right. I just went to one shit started at 1:00 PM I'm like, wait, it's starting at one. And that was the wake. Oh hell no. Yeah. You just don't get to see 'em. To me, you just don't get to see 'em. I mean, some people like to kiss the body goodbye and all of that stuff. Yeah, some, yeah. You know What Really pissed me off though, is when they start taking pictures.

I I know It is for me man. It's, it's only for terminal patience. But I thought about you but I think that, I thought that was shit was So like, it's not selfish if you're, if if you have like two to three weeks left and the quality of your life is so, you know, is just, It is non-existent, then That's, that's a choice. Many man. How many times we had people have two to two to three weeks left and they lived for years. That is, that is A fact. You know what I'm saying? Ma'am? So I'm, you never really know.

If you, if you're have misery. I think people, I think people right to die with dignity. And I think people should, should make their come on make their own choices. We gotta get a call. Like, yo, I'm about to get, I'm about to have somebody help me transition on to the afterlife.


Yeah. Should there, you should respect that person's wishes. Okay. Yeah. Let that person try. She did respect, but I just didn't at the time now. Sorry. I I think sometimes I think The opposite is selfish actually Keeping them alive when they wanna go. Like, Because look, you said you believe that person doing that is being selfish. Yeah, because it's So many. It their It's their life. Their life. They're the one in pain. So they're the ones that wanna leave. So I think it's really it be us who's still, but I wanna go. Don't I wanna go hang out with you. Come on selfish. That's the selfish part. Wanna I'm selfish. Stay in excruciating pain so that I can d you for me. The times. Yes. Because I don't wanna, I don't wanna grieve you. Well no, No. Stay here And I'm No, no. I don't want them to stay in pain. But obviously if you could hold on a little bit longer so the family could come around and gather around, we would love that.


That's it. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. It's hard. I don't wanna be selfish and make my mockery out of it because obviously it's important to the family and to my wife. So Why can't you just go now? Yeah. He got, he got Show to do. You got nothing to do. Right. And you got another room to, to Do busy. Oh shit man. That's not nice Man.

Fuck that. Gotta send some flowers to the funeral. What's wrong with you y'all? Oh shit. Niggas sick. Yo, yo. He was, what was that? What was that movie? And think like a man, what was the name of that movie where their homeboy died and at the end they all went to the beach and sent the balloons up in their head.


Why? That was, why did I get married? Whatever movie that was why they was hacking like that was really, they dead on me in the balloon going to the, they stand there black nigga tribute. It's a tribute. Tribute. It is tribute. Everybody. Tribute. It's symbolic and meaningful. I don go get in the house. The only thing I would say on a serious, this is the Impact talking. Got On a serious note though, as you think about, and I'm only saying it 'cause we, we talked about this like, sometimes people, elderly people get depressed and they don't know what they want or they think they want one thing and they want something else. Terminal pa patience is one thing. And I think people have a right to die with dignity. But I know like with my father, he, he, we, they told us he was dying. They said he got a couple weeks, you know, just stop feeding them like, you know.


Huh? Wait, what? Yeah, they said like the feed. 'cause he didn't basically he didn't wanna eat anymore eat. So they said you could put it through a feeding tube or not. Yeah, can eat. Oh, okay. Right. And so I said, and so I said, dad, I had to, my other brothers bounced. They were left. They didn't wanna do it. They had me do it. I'm the youngest And I said, Hey, do you want to, You go throwing Frazier. Frazier. Yo you ain't shit. S like funeral story. I get it fo my other brother's was just me. Yo Frazier youngest one. You got this. So I went and I was like, yo, you know, do you, do you want us to keep doing a feeding tube or not? And he was like, just, I think I'm okay if I don't have the feeding tube. And I said, are you, I said, I won't be upset with you. I won't be hurt if you're ready to go, if you don't want the feeding tube, it's okay.


He said, let him go. By the two days later, as we were starting to do that, the doctor said, let's give him one more thing for his appetite. It is an appetite inducer, but it's also an antidepressant. He took it and it turned out after he took the appetite, uc, not only did he want to eat, but he felt better and didn't wanna die anymore. I came back two weeks later because I traveled to San Antonio. I was waiting for, I was on standby. You going too hard for part of the month now? Boy what? No, you killing this shit. Oh, I'm Just, I came back two weeks later. We had moved into a transitional home because my mom didn't wanna die at home and he was fucking up two plates of food. He was, he was killing and he, he had gained like 10, 15 pounds. He looked like himself again. And it was the fact that the appetite inducer was actually also antidepressant. And I found out that a lot of elderly people are depressed and will be like, fuck it.


Like let me go. Yeah. Because of the mood they're in. That's not the gain, what you are saying, which is, which is when you're termin ill and you're in pain, that's different. My dad was just depressed. And knowing the difference between those two things is important. That's All. And also made is a very, it's not, it's a lengthy process. Yes. You have to get asked a lot of questions. They, they really do like a cognitive and and psychological testing to make sure that you are of sound mind making this decision. They ask you in front of people, they ask you alone. Are you being coerced into this decision? Whoever's the executor of your will cannot be a witness because that's a conflict of interest. It's a lengthy process. I understand, Man. I'm telling y'all not in front of everybody. Don't do that shit for me. Keep me alive no matter what. No DNR nigga Hook me to the car charger.


I don't give a fuck what you gotta do to figure out how to keep me alive. Nah. I don't care if I paying, I'm, they'll figure something out. They find something new. It's not for me, but I respect everybody else's Wishes. Yeah. I'm, I'm the opposite. You. Once I get to a point where I can't do anything for myself and yo y'all, y'all can let me go. I don't wanna be a burden on nobody. I feel that. Let me go. I wanna be a burden. These niggas been a burden on me a long time. Alright, you got it. Okay. Send me to Frazier. Pull out that hat in the back with all of our happy topics Now. Two hours in. Who wants to get happy? Anybody get happy man? Or do we have any more stories? We're still happy about when our parents died or like somebody we love?


What'd you guys, what'd you guys think? Stop made some. Yeah. Would you do it? Would you wanna live? Come on what we got happy. All right. Drake and UMG that makes us happy. Let's do it. Ice. Put this shit on me. UMG clap back. They sued him and they're trying to get out of the, out of the lawsuit. I mean the verbiage in the lawsuit was crazy. Talk about ice. I got it. Oh, you have it up? Okay, let's go Big mail. Plaintiff one of the most successful recording artists of all time. Lost Shade. Yeah. Lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated. UMG argued in emotion to dismiss.


Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist, he often claims to be more shade. Shade. He has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds more Shade. Who wrote this? Kendrick Fuck. He had ax to grind nor she, The label said Not Like Us cannot form the bias of a defamation claim because Lamar's lyrics are protected as a non-actionable opinion. And rhetoric hyperbole. This is especially true in the context of a rap battle. UMG added where dis tracks are often built around outrageous insults. UMG noted that this type of hyperbole was present in the nine dis tracks Drake and Lamar collectively released during their 2024 rap battle.


And that Drake encouraged the feud by taunting Lamar to respond to his songs and lodge damning insults of his own, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse on the track. Family matters. So that's, he Told him. That's pretty admit. Yeah. I don't, I just don't, I don't understand the, I don't understand Drake's suit. I never understood it because it was a battle. Nah, not even just that. You're, you're suing them for doing the same thing they did for You. Right. That Too. That's the part that you benefited from this for years. And now it's Oh wait, if if it's true with, you know, y'all promoting the song.


Yeah. I don't like that song though. It's about me. It makes me look bad. I'm gonna sue you. It's all been bad That that's the part I just don't get. And I hear a lot of people saying, oh, you're taking the side of the machine. I'm not taking the side of nothing in this. I just don't understand. It's like it's It is cool as long as it works for me. I'm taking the side of Rap battles. Yeah, It is a rap battle. Yeah. And it didn't go your way. And that sucks. That's it. I'm gonna still listen to Drake music. I still do listen to Drake's music. Same. Same. I think a lot of people are in the same boat. The suit is stupid. I think it was all to for the Super Bowl, but clearly, Nah, it's still happening. So I don know following through.


I don't know what y'all think. I think Party Next Door better be in the studio coming up with the fastest Nokia Remix Academy. That's what I think. It's on my phone. Are you fucking, you crazy as hell nigga. We gonna do a album together and your little song without me going go. You got me fucked up nigga. Yo. He always get the bad end of the stick. Hey, I ain't even think about that. I'm listening to what they play on the radio. They play Nokia and gimme a hug. Yeah, but Gimme a hug is has Drake on it? No. No. That's what we saying.


They don't Yeah, they don't Have they don't have Party Party. Sorry. Nevermind baby girl. I know. Key is hard though. It is. Nigga, if I'm party next door, I'm not leaving the studio until I think of a, a new one of that for him to approve for him. And you Crazy. Like, damn, that is kind of fire. I'm, I'm going tell I'm gonna use that one though. Let me, let me get that new album coming. I'd be tight. I know niggas, but I'm not supposed to say that because it's still your album. No, I would be tight. A hundred percent I'd be tight. I don't give a fuck. I would say It. I'm absolutely, I would be tight. I'm over the lawsuit.


Shit. I'm over the lawsuit shit above my pay grade. I don't know who's doing what. I don't know why they're doing it. I'm, I'm, it's, It is last, it's the last year thing to me. Let it be relevant to the people it's relevant to. Which is UMG, Lucian and fucking Drake. O-V-O-I-I don't care. I don't care. Like it has no bearing on me. Win or lose. I just want music. IY it's So sad The point, I don't even want that. No. I want music from, from niggas. I don't like y'all have trained, trained me into. Okay, there's, we not getting albums from all of the people. I love, I told y'all throughout the whole week, I just be thinking of all of the artists that I love that just off it now it's like if y'all off it, the fuck I'm gonna be sitting by the iTunes store for Right when they drop, they'll drop.


That's what I'm saying. So it's just like I if if y'all, that's all I care About. If they drop a really dope project, then we'll get another one in six years. Yeah. I mean Drake was the exception to that. I'm not really talking to him because he was dropping, but it's scary out there. I Ain't hold, I could go for a Drake album if it's, if he's just rapping. I don't, I hate the the singing shit. But if he actually is just spitting bars, I, I could go for a Drake Album. I don't think you ever get that. I think you've never gotten that true. And nor will he ever do that because his fan base is just too big for that. I just want a Drake album. I don't give a fuck what long as it's, I don't want to experimental Drake like the the dance album. Oh, I don't need none of that. Give me Drake that I've become a, I've been a fan of since fucking oh eight.


It is rumor daddy It is coming. I'm sure. And and It is rumor that it ain't gonna be long And you don't think this UMG lawsuit is gonna hem that up at all? It doesn't have to. I don't, I Don Yeah, he'll find a way. Same way he did with the party album. That's What Afraid Of pretty Much a Drake go go get with one producer or something and do it. Yeah. We've seen that trick a bunch of times. Yeah. The producer album. Wheres his album featuring you or y'all together, but it's now it's over there. Got it. Or the label could have no problem with putting out a Drake album. I'm about to say that. That's awesome. Money. It's still profitable. We can have our fight and we can continue our fight. But if you got one, we have paperwork that says that we we in on that.


Where do you see this going? Like If you lose this, The lawsuit or what What I'm saying the lawsuit in general right? They they trying to get it dismissed. If it doesn't dismiss it, what does it put out there to the other artists? Does it go It's Gonna get dismissed I think. Huh? I think it's gonna get dismissed. You think it's gonna get dismissed? Yeah, Same. But if it doesn't, Is there a counter suit? I don't know. As of now, I, I Have kind of clocked out of this. Yeah. Yeah. As well. Got it. I think G'S game was to get this dismissed out of hand at the early and they didn't dismiss it. It's still moving forward. Yeah. But I still think that it's not gonna, I don I don't know if he'll be successful. It doesn't seem like he's gonna be successful based on what the legal expert, I'm not legal expert, but that's what they're saying.


I've Heard the same. Y'all think Luigi's getting off? No. You talked about that. No, I don't remember your answer. Well, we talked about jury selection and just juries being committed to finding reasonable doubt. Yeah. That's why I wanna know y'all answer. I don't remember it. No, I don't think he's getting off at all. I think he's a patsy and they're gonna make sure he don't get off Patsy. Like he didn't do it. When y'all say something, you don't think he did it? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. When y'all say things like that right? He didn't do it. You Don't think he did it either? No. I was shaking my head at how niggas always think somebody didn't do it. Yeah. When y'all, when y when you say he didn't do it, Those were his eyebrows.


What Do you, what do, what do you, what do you think happened then? Like do you think they just found somebody to make them be the four guy? How did they convince him to be the four guy? They might not convince you. They Might so he was on his way to do that actual thing. But somebody beat him to it and knew he was going to do it kind thing. Or it could have been planned. He, he could have been coached through it. Like it wasn't just his idea. Right. You were, you were led to do this. So he might have actually executed, you're saying, but just might not have been his Plan. But it was, yeah, he was like a useful idiot. He was a tool. He, he was a tool, a cog in the wheel. Got it. Okay. I don't know about that because Early on people were saying, oh, that wasn't really him. Like he wasn't the guy, like it was a mistaken identity. All this crazy like scandal shit. You know? I'm like, I don't believe that. I think he opened, did just what it looked like.


He pulled out a gun and shot somebody on the broad daylight and they got on a city bike and left And, and went to McDonald's Pulling A fish. That's the part that just got a little, Hey, I think he did it too. Put all the evidence on him. But do I believe that? Yeah. Do I believe that he was just needed a McChicken when he was, I He might be hungry, but Yeah. Too afraid of a plan to run to McDonald's and sits with all the shit on, just Makes me question things like the amount of planning that went into doing that and then the movement afterwards. They Just don't, does he never gonna eat that? How? How you get food Shave Your eyebrows Dog. Not them eyebrows. Nah, you can take 'em out. You, you would think the person that that lays out that plan walks around with the evidence on them Eyebrows.


Well think it was a 3D gun. So it's not a, it's not a traceable weapon. Has no serial number or anything. So what would be the harm? It's like, it doesn't, the gun doesn't really exist. I get, I, okay. I don't want to hear none of that shit if I, I'm a dude that tried to shoot Trump that shot his elbow off. This dude's getting way too many props for me. Like we don't know what this dude looked like still. Right, Exactly. Tried And they killed him, didn't they? No. So they said I don know they didn't kill him. I don't think, I don't know. I think they was footage of them actually arresting him. I get confused. I don't remember to be honest. I don't Remember the earlobe guy. Let's check, Check it out. I think they took him out.


Niggas had the, he had the niggas shook. They didn't take, they take my Man out. Would love to be there for like the war process. And that's not my, I don like that of Luigi's trial. That's gonna be tough. I don't, I don't know who you exclude. Would you wanna be a juror? Yes. Yes. I would love to be a juror. Yeah, he was shot and killed. What's his name? Isn't that funny that we don't know the name of the guy who tried Thomas Matthew Crooks. The dude with the glasses on the roof. Right. See I don't know about that one. See now, now my hey fair. You Like you're everybody. They did not kill that Nigga. I'm more suspicious of that one. I think he did it too, but I'm more suspicious of that one. No, if somebody's trying to kill a president, you kill him so that we don't get information as to who you may or may not be working for.


Yes. You damn right. Yeah. You got snipers On the, you damn right. We kill him Immediately. See was snipers everywhere. But yeah, they didn't see this. They saw him This though. They Saw him and they did Nothing. Listen, let him, he's white. Listen. No, they want him to knock off Trump. Damn. The government, they turned they, they turned their blind eye to certain shit to allow certain shit to happen. He fucked up. He did. We gotta kill this nigga though, right? Because they get him and he start talking. But with this is he fucked up. Fucking idiot. Nigga moved. Trump wouldn't move Of all people. Yep. Trump Would move. It was almost over for That. Yo, you saw how close that was.


He just did a head turn to do some bullshit. He did, Man. Watch. Watch enough shit, man. They be telling you about this shit. Wait, hold up. If you were a juror, what would you juror? What would I juror? What Would you jerk. Yeah, what would your verdict be? Innocent And guilty. I would be there to listen to all of the e the evidence to make my decision objectively. Okay. What do You think it would be? Not motherfucking guilty. Okay. Alright. Free him. Oh shit. I feel like a lot of people feel that way. 'cause of how he looks. Yes. They fuck me. Yeah. It has nothing to do with the way he looks. It's tough to live in a world with all this patriarchy.


It is. There you go. It's tricky. It's crazy. You free on, Huh? Yes. Why? Because she thinks he's Canada. Don, y'all get healthcare? Yeah. Don't y'all got y'all? What the I haven't lived in Canada for almost 25 years, but why? Free And I'm not so I'm not a tax paying citizen. So therefore I do not get the universal healthcare that the citizens of Canada get. And even the people that's on the side of that, I for that because he killed the CEO of the what? What company was it? United Healthcare. Okay. Guess what they did? They were denying. They were Denying. Guess what they did put a new CEO in.


They sure Did. With the same Outcome. Guess what? Nothing changed. You're right. So Is this like when y'all wanted fucking Jody Meeks free? Yeah. Who's Jody Meeks? Yes. The fucking model light-skinned dude that Was with the light eyes. I Wasn't invested in that shit. Didn didn't give a fuck. He Wasn't white. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It seems to be a Trend. My bad. That's my bad. That's my bad. I'm ignoring it. What else? What else? TV up. What else is, what else is important? Unimportant. What we just talking About? Some good news for all y'all. If you're thinking about sending your kids to Harvard, it's now free. Well, y'all make too much money. But It is, it's free for anybody who makes under $200,000 a year. Any families that make under $200,000 a year, your children now have free tuition at Harvard.


What's the catch? Wait, hold on. They not going accept It. Is it children or students? Students of any age. Yeah. So what if I make less than $200,000 a year? Can I go for, can I go to Harvard for free? If you can get In You. Oh shit. Shade. Shade, Man. The shade. The shade. Wow. No, not to you. Not to you, Mel. I'm saying somebody asked What's the catch? That's the catch. Yeah, that's the catch. It's not like more people can get, they Ain't accepting you Niggas. Right? Most people who get into Harvard already make more than 200,000. There's a class component to it. So it doesn't really make Harvard that much more accessible. People make A lot of them. A lot of 'em. Folks. Legacy. Yeah. Like rich people get into Harvard more than poor people. Poor people rarely get into Harvard. So there's, it doesn't, it's not like they lowered the bar. And it's interesting because the right wingers on the internet last night and all on tv were talking about this is a, you know, awful.


This is more DEI Of course this is letting ungrateful, you know, unworthy people. It doesn't, it doesn't change the standards of Harvard. If you can get into Harvard, you can go. It just means poor people don't have to pay. Which I think is a great thing. I think it's great too. I just would like to see the numbers. I just think we need to not do it at Harvard. 'cause who gives a fuck? I mean like, do it at the state college. Do it at the local college. Do it at a place where people are actually getting in. Don't do it at a place where Harvard only lets in 3% of all applicants. So who cares? Like there might be 10 poor people who get a, who get a free ride now. That's all. If that, If that, This is just a headline to sound good, right? That's it. Yeah. Yeah. It, it sounds good. That's it. That's it. Yeah. It's A good pub, but it don't do shit for y'all now. And nobody who was going to Harvard, who wasn't gonna Harvard is now going to Harvard for the Most.


And then they said if you, if if if the family is under a hundred K, you get free room and board who's, how many, what percent is that gonna apply to Again, almost nobody. And again, to your point, if you make 1 25 and you get in free, but you gotta pay room and board. Room and board is a lot of fucking money. It is. So you still gotta come up cash outta pocket. So it's tough. So anyways, It is an interesting announcement, but I want y'all to just look underneath Yeah. The headline and realize it's not, doesn't mean much. We should be fighting for free public education for everybody. Agreed. And you know, they ain't doing that. Right. Education's still a barrier. Trying to keep folks out.


We getting too serious? I can feel Yeah. Yeah. Feel good about it there. You feel what I, I got, I I I'm learning when to pivot. I I Don don't look at we gotta learn how to pivot without looking at me like this. Smooth. Yeah. That was our first time I wanted to shut up because that was my first time in 44 years hearing some Harvard news. I feel dumb as hell. Alright. That that is fucked up. Oh shit. Well great. I don know. Yeah. Fuck it. Holy shit. Harvard.

If our Business free, Look, look, look, if our business was right, I might not have to do this talk like Birdman robbed them niggas for years according to them.


So if our business was right, I wouldn't even be happy to be out There. Do we really, lemme say this, do we really look at it as robbery nigga? He, he put the, he put the investment out there. He he did a lot right? He he he he presented them to the world. Correct? He marketing and promotion. I mean, Birdman, when the big, I don't really know the story. I'm not a hip hop head like you, but from what I, from what I've seen when the Hot Boys was out, video shoots and all that stuff. Like you heard about Birdman putting that shit together. Yes, absolutely. So does he not deserve the kickback? ROI and investment plus more for all the investment that he had to put for six or seven motherfuckers. He, juvenile, Mandy Fresh, Lil Wayne, all the nigga Tur, BG, Juvenile.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. I'm agreeing with you. Now what happens is, and this is Mo most hip hop, that's that initial deal I'm putting you on. Yes. Now it might come time where, all right I've I've, I've become a bigger star than we might have imagined. I may wanna restructure this deal now or I may want, I I wanna make more money now. Yes. No. And that's where the beefs come in with a lot, a lot of times I wanna own my shit now. Oh okay. Yo Wayne was gonna leave and go to Rockefeller with Ho Allegedly. Okay. Allegedly. They told him, yo, we'll stay here, we'll give you your own label.


Gave him young money. What he didn't know they gave him 49% of young money. Jesus. So you really, you think you got your own label but you don't because I got 51% of what we gave you. As you find out these things, you start to think the person that I looked up to that was my friend, that was my mentor that I caught my father really did not have my best interest in mind but, and now beef steps. Wait, do you mean does that mean I don't have your best interest in my in mind or that I have to make my money back that I spent? It might even, do you think that Just use Lil Wayne alone? I think it's safe to assume you Recouped. He recouped all cool handsomely and then just Wayne.


But then, but then how about this, you hear plenty of times where somebody helps somebody become popular and that's put all the all the weight Specula and put All the, I said it's to assume you, you Hear a lot of stories where somebody helps somebody get popular, put all the legwork in and when they become famous they leave them in a dust, They dip off. Absolutely. So sometimes you gotta protect yourself. Now I don't know the details of it but I, a lot of niggas gotta protect themselves. Agree. You do gotta, you have to protect your But I web told Joe the best, put the best, gotta Protect. That's where the problem goes. Both sides are trying to protect themselves. And then you start to realize, oh shit, well I, we kind of married at this point I really can't get X, Y, Z without you. And here we go with them on tour together. I don't wanna talk about them 'cause I don't know none the details.


Yeah. I ain't in that Business. But what I can say, and Wayne did entertainment is it could look like somebody is successful enough to recoup and only 2% of earnings be going toward a recoupment. You never know when somebody is recouped or not according to the paperwork. That's true. That's true. And it's a shit a lot of contracts are designed so you can't recoup Then there's that. Yeah. So, okay. Alright. So that's why they leaving him on stage. Yo, Fuck That. This is all speculation While we're here. Fucking, But I could understand that is what I'm saying. Got it. Me too. Like I'm, this is just business. Iggy Azalea tweeted on this news, not this news but related news, universal music.


Mark my words. You ugly bitch you will pay me what is owed. This has been going on between myself and them privately for over two years and counting. By the way, she continues crazy how in my entire career I was never paid a single royalty by universal music for anything outside of the USA. They owe me millions of dollars in back pay that they technically stole from me as per my contract. I am due payment. The amount owed is in the eight figure range. Last week they tried to respond to my lawyer and offer me a settlement of 18 k I'm told this is a normal response from their lawyers.


And after appearing in court, they end up paying millions as they're supposed to. Thankfully, I'm well off and I can and will pursue this issue until they pay me what they owe. But I'd like to publicly say that I think universal music are criminals who actively take advantage of all of their artists in perpetuity for their own gang. They are the scummiest company and they do this to so many artists still gold, who unfortunately can't afford to fight for what they're owe. Sure. Thus they get away with this behavior. Universal music really needs to do better in their treatment of the artists who quite literally earned the millions via intellectual property, they had zero part in creating Yuck.


Ugh. That was her. Yuck. Not mine. I get It. This a lot of that sounds like buyer's remorse On her Part. Yes. Meaning she signed the contract. Yes. Didn't read it through. And this is the outcome. A lot of times it's, I didn't really know I was signing this. I thought it was that, oh shit, I signed this and now I want to rectify it. I'm old. Hey she, she, she's doing it the right way. 'cause she got lawyers involved and stuff. She said this is normal where they'll low ball offer you for settlement. And I'm not even mad at that, not taking the company side.


But I'm not, I'm never mad at the attempt I Am. I'm never mad at the attempt. It's unethical. I mean, it It is. Here's my thing. If you and I sign a deal and it's a bad deal, you, you just gotta hold that l Right. But what I'm hearing her say at other artists say is sometimes they're dishonest even in this context of the deal we signed. Like they actually don't do what they say they're gonna do. And it's only when we do forensic accounting, it's only when we dig deeper that we realize they didn't give us the money. But the problem is the artist is so broke, they can't, they can't afford to fight for the thing they actually deserve. I'm with you. If you sign a bad deal, you don't like the deal. You Yeah, yeah. That's, but, but what I hear a lot of artists say is, is that these, these labels are stealing their money and they know we don't have enough money to prove it.


That's what I, that's the part I think is fucked up. And They, and that, and I'm with you, that that part is fucked up. Yeah. I'm just talking about people signing bad deals and then regretting a deal later on. Yeah. Or had I known this, I would've never signed that. Well, and that's on you, but Doesn't almost every single artist say that. Yeah. It's A predatory Industry. Exactly. Yeah. And that's the problem. I remember When, yeah, it's, no, I'm sorry, go ahead. I I I made this example to make it where like a regular person might understand who don't sign record label contracts. We, we, we made the jokes before about the used car lot. Alright? You going on a used car lot And them selling you a lemon? Nah, not a lemon. Oh, okay. Yo, you want this car? Cool. We'll put you in this car.


Give us five grand down. Your interest rate is 27%. You don't even know what that means. Yeah, I understand You just so glad. All right, cool. I got the car I can afford to pay. Then you realize you go home and look at it. Wait, the car is worth how much and if I pay this off, I've bought this car three times over. Oh, they fucked me. No they didn't. Fuck you. You don't know what you were signing. And now you Wanna know, supposed to be true though, right? I mean like you made a bad choice but somebody It is still Predatory. You, you got in bed though. That's All I'm saying. It is a, it's a, it's a predatory system that It is that they go to people who don't have many choices and they, and they pray On Your desperation and they pray on your desperation and lack of knowledge. I remember I wasn't here, but I, I remember watching when Jada Kiss was here with his, with his father and J Wine and they were talking about this, the first deal they got offered was trash the worst.


And the only thing worst that stopped him from doing it, the worst Was the parents getting was Apparently to say don't do this. Interestingly enough, he ended up with a bad boy deal that ended up being trash even after that. But you Heard what he told him, as soon as y'all got 18, you went and signed your own deal without us looking at it. Right. And it turned out to be a bad deal. The problem is for me, not, some people don't have that knowledge and just make their own choice. A lot of people take that first deal not knowing any better. And that's, that's what I have issue. If everybody ended up in that second deal, that's On you. But see now today, I'm only speaking today. I think if you end up in that first deal today, that's kind of on you with all the information and stories we got. Now you should be skeptical of any deal that comes across your desk. You should have it looked at by it's The money.


It is the money man. It's needing money. It's needed the inspiration. And they hit you with the, yo, I got a bag of money right here and a diamond chain for you, but you gotta sign right now. This offer expires when I walk out the door niggas are gonna Sign. Yeah man, that's capitalism. And so I I guess that's what I'm saying. Value. I, I hate that people are making bad choices, but I do gotta smoke for the companies too because they could not do that and they could still make a lot of money without fucking everybody. And then how would they benefit? How would they grow? How would they be able to get other, you know, if Universal made half the money, it made it need, it need, it needs to the money. It was still the universe. The money needs to go in the circle. To me it needs to go in the circle so you can invest some more artists and, and do whatever you can do. And, and the game is there to be taken advantage of people out there to be taken advantage of.


Whether we make, So basically ethics don't, don't have any play any role in business whatsoever. No. I, I don't, I don don't Think I don I don and the business that had ethics, a lot of them went down under, I don some of the mom And pop shops. Don't think so. Some people that started that had ethics when they wanted to pay, like when we watch a lot of businesses go down under for having ethics. It is fucked up. But that's the truth. Whether society is built like that or not, that's that's what, but there's a big, there's a gap. There's a huge gap between exploiting the shit outta everybody and making deals so generous that you, that your company can't sustain itself. There's a middle ground. It is. I agree. Even just like slightly. But once you set the, they're slightly fucked up. But once you set the bar of, show me The middle of of, Of making deals that are, as you said, generous to everybody, you fucked the entire industry up doing that.


And Then they not, they're not trying to do, they not a new bar is set. Let's talk about Yeah, that's a, that's a good thing. That's what Niggas ain't trying to change the yo, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Let's remove It is broke, but it, It is broke. Broke To who? Lemme ask you a question mark, let's remove every artist that's, that's I'm talking about as the business, as the company. Cool. You smart enough to not sign this deal Salute to you. I'm gonna go give it to Him. But this so not about being smart. This is what I say. If just Joe's example, if Joe came in here and paid all of us exactly half of what he pays us, whatever that number is, right. A lot of us, a lot of us would, that would be fucked up. But a lot of us might be in a position where we can't leave true. And we can just say, that's business. Lemme ask you a question. And it wouldn't be that we're not smart enough to know that.


It's just we wouldn't have a choice. Let's remove that part. Let's talk about generosity. We watch a lot of people be generous in life and go down under nigga. So let artist mc, ham nigga generosity put 'em down under Mike Tyson generosity, put 'em down under where's the middle ground. Yeah, but sometimes you have to do things to, to, sometimes you have to take advantage in order to succeed. But here's what I'm disagree. Fucked up to say, but it's true. Generos just lemme finish to finish this response. I'm saying something don't put me in my place. No, it's not putting you in your place. I'm just saying Mc hammer given buying 30 cars, a whole lot of dances. Right. That's generosity. A company not exploiting you is not universal, is not being generous by paying people what they owe or by not extracting all the labor from somebody and giving them the just the slightest amount to keep them on board.


That's not generosity. Understand what I'm, and I think part of how the system is fucked up is we act like they're doing us a favor by paying us our what? What's ours? The system is fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. But that's what saying, I don't wanna compare that to generosity. I don't wanna compare Universal to the rapper who just came out the project as buying all this homies changed. Like that ain't the same shit. You know what I'm saying? Like, they owe us, they owe us What I'm saying us like corporations owe everyday people. They do. Yeah. So that to me that's the difference. I I think they owe whatever you agree on in your contract. Yeah. Alright. And if you agree on some bad terms then you, you got some bad terms. Yeah, I agree. I agree with that part. And I mean, y'all segued kind of quick, but to whom they concerned, if you'll keep the job with half the pay, then just before you leave, write your name and all Box.


Just write Down the little box over there. The little box over there. Well half like if you, if if on half the pay you'll still come to work outta need and necessity, then all you gotta do is grab a pen and paper and write it. Just write it over there. You Get that done asap. Oh man. Anyways. Oh man. Yo, what, what are you telling me about Kanye? Let me hear it. Nah, I was just, I have Kanye blocked because this is nuts. So I don't really be seeing, I don't see shit. But Is this mine? Your now that's Yours. People keep tagging me and Paul and It is, he's he's on a tweet rant again going off about a whole bunch of shit. Love it. And one of the things that stood out, he said, fuck Jim Jones.


And I'm like, wait, what? Ugh, I don love that. And they were just on tour together, kind of Out Tour. Oh, they were hanging out. Okay. I check It. But Jim went out there to Japan, hung out, big them up, all that shit. The shit gave jeans to the belt. Yeah. Kanye tweeting the diplomat piece and all of that. And, And then this What you want man. So It don't, it don't take much. You do that all the time. Probably part of the plan man to bring visibility. I don't know. What's the plan to bring visibility? Where? To to Jim's Abel. Oh, There's better ways to do that. Jones. Jim Jones has a good album Right else to do it. I like It Is my favorite shit I'm listening to right Now.


Is anybody gonna take what he's saying serious based off his rants? But if this gonna make you go, is this gonna make you say, Hey Kanye said, fuck Jim Jones, let me go listen to his album now. Lemme go. I don't think that will do that. Yeah, nah, it don't. But that's what he been doing the whole time. He, It don't sound like he spoke to somebody. Cam, I'm not putting Cam name in nothing, but it sound like he spoke to somebody. I think he's not. I mean it could be. I think that's true and I think he's not well and he just does shit. I remember he was on drink Champs calling Diddy a fed and fuck Diddy and, and and tweeting crazy shit about Diddy. And then just last night he's on Instagram telling him that he's like a father to him. Yeah.


That that's some more of his tweets was about that. So he's up here basically defending the Cassie video. Def Kanye West is right now. Yes. What's he saying in defense? Oh God, I, okay. All right. Come on. Yeah. All all right, fine, fine, fine, fine. He's victim blaming, let's put it that way. Thank you for summing it up. It's, it's wild. And then, you know, he did, he called him last night or the last day or two and then he Sha room had an exclusive on it and they played the whole audio call. And it's weird. First of all, I think Puff called Ye 'cause he wanted to talk to Ye I don't think Puff knew that Ye was gonna be putting it on the internet.


Like I can't imagine calling somebody from prison being this private, not doing no interviews and suddenly wanting my whole conversation in public. But Wait, what kind of phone was he talking to him on? It was a legal one. It was The one where they say this call was being recorded. Yeah, Yeah. But that don't mean that this person that you're talking to is recording it. That means that the, That anything can happen Means that anything can happen happen. But the prison recording it don't mean we gonna give it to the Shade Room either. Right. That's just saying if you say some shit in, on this call, but how do, How do we hear any kind of calls, the calls on fucking Dateline, the calls on whatever blog like we hear them because they're recorded. So him thinking that this isn't gonna go anywhere.


Him, Diddy talking to Kanye seems a little Preposterous to me. I think anybody that talks or to or texts Kanye should expect it to go out. Yeah. This point. Yeah. That's who, that's just anything. Yeah. I I was making that joke with my girl yesterday. I'm like, Kanye is the dude that if, if he texts you, you don't even respond. You got a voice note him. Like, I don't even Know if you want To. Yeah, you might not even wanna do that. Like, you just, nah, I should end up On a track word. Nah, it, I wouldn't say nothing to. And Puff didn't say nothing to him. Crazy. But he was just talking to him clearly in a what seemed like a private moment and he was trying to give y this pep talk. He was like, you know, the system is wicked, wicked, wicked. That's the only thing he said about himself. Kinda like, as if the wicked system is why he's in jail as if like he had did nothing wrong and it's just a wicked system.


But then on top of that, he was trying to give ye the pep talk. Like you gotta get back on stage. We need you rocking mics again. We need you cutting samples again. We need, I need the old Ye back. And Yay was just like, Yes Sir. Like he was very like deferential and like mature in the conversation. And then he was like, you've been like a father to me even before I met you. You raised me, you know, and it, it was all, it was like a love fest with, with Puff. And then on Twitter he's doing the opposite. He's tearing down Kim, he's tearing down Jim Jones. He's tearing down all these people. So I, it seems like he's on another rant, like, like, like flip said. And I don't know if it's 'cause the album is out, if it's, if it's a, if it's a mental health thing, if it's al the above, I don't know. But I ain't gonna lie, sometimes it gets addictive. I can't stop watching. Nah, I'm the opposite. I don't wanna watch, I Complete opposite. Yeah. I said after last time I was like, all right, enough block mute.


I don't wanna see your shit no more. He just saying fuck everybody. Yeah. Except for Joe. He always pick, he always big up Joe, Joe. But he love you. I don't, I I'm about to look into you a little bit, little more. You know, Joe was the only nigga. He don't say fuck Jim was just with him, but he go big up Joe in Subway. He Fuck that church big up Joe. He's somewhere else. Big up Joe. Well Joe button say everywhere. What, what's, what's going on Joe? Put me on to you and Kanye's relationship. I don know what to say. Why he never shoot at you. You say a lot of preposterous shit up here that deserves it. That can get you shot at And be clear for me Joe bud.


God's not finished is an insult. It's not an insult. An insult, an insult. It could be taken, it could be taken a couple of different ways. It's a fucking insult. What? What what? You don't just say nobody whole name singing it and then say God is not finished with you. Are you crazy? Stop. Stop. That is an insult. Bigger Heights for you. Snap Somebody is an insult nigga. Stop. What? Stop mad. I didn say you little rough around the edge. Yeah, It is Mad Positive. So you feel like he, he, he tried to like, did he say he was a billionaire? Yeah. Recently two weeks ago got broke In Japan. He was singing, he was just singing on at his show.


He said, Joe, God's not finished. And the nigga started texting me, whatever. I'm like nigga God is done with me. He not, you still got other places you were trying to get Word. God's not your God. Don't play about you. I'm gonna get down to the bottom of you and Kanye. Shit, I'm lemme call shot and find out if I go through your phone, nigga. Nothing Is happening with me and Kanye. Yo, That niggas, I'm assure you. So, so this him now secret shit at you say something secret shit at you. He don't shoot at you. You play you said mad shit the last time he shouted you out recently. A couple of Pauls before that we was talking about how the shit that he's doing is ridiculous and what he, what does he go on as part? Yeah. I come on here and say I'm not talking about him.


He said, oh, Joe Butter Said somehow he find a way. Yeah, he finding a way. I wasn't didn didn't even have him written on my list with all this shit y'all all talking about. I had him with him going back and forth with Kim. Kim over trademarking North. That's what I was about to Talk about. I thought that was kind of interesting. I thought it was super interesting. I I wanted to hear where y'all stood on that. On what if y'all saw the text exchange without pulling it up just off the dome. Got it. I guess there was a puff song that had north vocals that Kim stopped. Kim said Uhuh not the look I want. We dead in that. So her and Kanye had a text exchange about who has the right to do that and who owns North's trademark, which Kim let him know or Well Kanye found out once that block happened that oh shit, It is Kim and she can't do that.


So he came in hot and he was like, yo, amend this, amend this, or I'm gonna turn it up on both of us. No one will be able to recover if you just read how Kanye texts people, I can't see you wanting to text with him. That That's what that's what I'm saying. I feel Like the world, world was in a better place when Kanye didn't have a phone. Yeah. It was a long time too, where he was like, yeah, a proponent of just the Laptop. What'd you say? A freeze. It is more than that. It is more because Playboy Card's album. That's funny. She's on the album and Kanye was supposed to have been on there and he was taken off. So now he's tight. That's kind of funny. No, this is funny now. But now he's tight.


That's funny. That's funny. That's what all Spurs from him to me. Yeah. I don't feel that he, she should amend it. Y don't feel that he should have white. Hell no. Why? Because of how he's acting on, on the, on the internet. He has He's erratic. Yeah. If you, if you're fighting to get your kid on Diddy's album, that's crazy. I feel like that's a sign right there that you're not capable of making good choices. Oh, come on man. Stop it man. Come on. Would you put your kid on Diddy's? Yes. If which? Yeah. The loved one that before? Yes. I, no, we're talking about now Diddy. I don't, I'm not aware of an album that Diddy has right now, but if he did have an album, my Child Y'all do that. You said you worked with Kevin Spacey. Yeah, Exactly. He exactly. It's the love album. I would, I would have JR one of my children on that album.


Yes. The Love album that that came out. Yes. All right, let me ask you, 'cause that album came out before all the other shit started out. Yeah, it's True. So if he had an album coming out next month, would you allow your child on that album? Mm, I don't Know. And It is a, the title is crazy of the album. No, the title Was for Love it. The title was something like, lemme tell you what she did though. No, it's gonna stop it. No, the titles something like, Hey, she wasn't innocent, They sped up the film. Nah, I wouldn't do that. Nah, not nothing like that. They sped up the film. But if it, if it was a, if it was an album of just pure art, man. I mean, to, to be honest, I mean we saw the video, but like what May said recently that if he was on the list, he'll go visit Diddy.


Right. A lot of this stuff is alleged. He's, it still should be, regardless if it's guilty before innocent, it should be still should be innocent before guilty. So right now, if he was coming out with an album that he had a record on and one of my children were on it, I would approve the sample. Okay. I would, I would approve the But the point is, I, I think she has a right to say as a parent, I don't think that's, I do, I do think so as well. You know what I'm saying? Her ye go back. And then ye also was making it like a race thing too. Like now a white woman is controlling. Well I'm, I'm Gonna read a couple of the tweets on that because the first one is I held my tongue about not being on Cardi album. Him going to my ex to ask my daughter to be on the song two days later was too far. Nobody finna play with me Was him To my Cardi Cardi Because Cardi Had to hit Kim to Get, oh God, the Daughter on the album.


That's funny though. And then he says, so Kim got the name and likeness over my black children. So a white woman has control over the name and likeness of my black children and then speaks to Cardi about putting my daughter on the song with him. These dumb ass celebrities be trying to play with me in my face. Isn't this first He needed to knock off that white woman shit. First of all when he was wit Yeah, you married her, right? First of all, he wasn't, she wasn't white when you was fucking her, right? No, she was. Well no, he wasn't claiming her as white. No he wasn't. Duh. He claim wasn't this, you know, black people, she's Italian, she's Armenian, she's, they found all kinds of shit to say she ain't white now all of a sudden ain't fuck up with she white again. Yes, nigga.


That's but also like you made a choice. If you, if you, if you choose to have a child with a white woman, then yes, a white woman is going control what your children do. That's the choice you made for Yeah. Let it you got, you got, you got. That's why the foundational blacks say you're not supposed to do BA That's why they say, you know the BS are their jobs. They stand behind Kanye. Right Bs don't stop please and listen, leave them alone. Don't get the because they Stop me. Can't joking like that because They doubt what you stop Please. What I will say, I don't even wanna talk about Kanye ados, I talk about me. If any one of my baby mama wake up and and start rocking a swastika shirt, I'm not giving them rights to anything.


That Simple. Boom, dear. I agree. That's it. I agree. Not a trademark, not a copyright, not a child support. Do You think it his I'm going to get custody. I'm just getting ready. Say whatever rights you Do got. Yeah, It is over. We getting Ready to go Talk about that. That's different. You can take Aways. You put them rights in the little mason jar, mail it on over, mail it On over. I agree with you on that. A swastika. Because even no matter, regardless of your views on things like you not thinking about your kid having to go to school and just be outside, walk around and right in Hollywood, It is like He's standing in the middle of the street with a swastika having people record him. He just doing bullshit. He's doing bullshit. He's doing bullshit. He's doing a lot of bullshit. He's Been doing bullshit for A while.


He's doing bullshit and not caring how it affects anybody else. God's not finished with him or you? No, for real. God's not done with you. Not done With you either. I think he is. No said this is it y'all. You because you moved. God's not with you. We don't Fuck that moon nigga. You gotta, you gotta take care of us nigga. Fuck that move nigga. Wait fuck. This ain't made nigga we not made This perfectly lines up to one of my We gotta helping you piece I had for y'all. This says with a chuckle. This lines up perfect. Here go this lines up perfectly. But I didn't do it 'cause I didn't want y'all to judge me for being depressed. Let's hear it Pissing her off man. She's doing the eye roll.


Go ahead. Wait, I didn't say nothing to Mel. Go Ahead. Which one of us was it? Me. This, I didn't even say nothing to Mel. Just now You didn't, you didn't Go ahead. Was it me, Mel, Go ahead. I Missed this. Yeah, that was your ho I thought I Go Ahead. Trying to put it on me. No, I didn, didn didn't even know I was mad. I moved to change. I don't know what, tell me It is. You, You guys just really, really, it's tasteless as fuck. Stop talking about that shit. It is not a light matter. Don't do it. What step the fuck away from it. What are you talking about? The maid shit. Don't mention it. Don't talk about it. If you cannot be respectful about it, leave it alone. I'm Lost. Carry on. I didn. I didn't hear the question, the depression. I just missed it. Mel, that wasn't to you. That was both Joe Mel to bother him and say that we weren't helping him do anything.


It was a joke to him because he came in here saying that he was depressed earlier. It was supposed to be between him and I. But I apologize to you if that, if that offended you. Thank you. I will not crack that joke again. Thank you Joe. Depresses. Depress. Well cool, but chill for a minute. I love when someone else is triggered defends me. That's right nigga, You whole fool. You started roll eyes and you promise you won't do that man. You must have told me. Okay. Okay. Yeah, you're right. But when it comes to something like that, I apologize bro. You gotta stand strong for that. Yeah, Yeah. I'm sorry that wasn't even thinking y'all. So my, I don't remember that.


I don, what was I talking about Justelle? We were talking about Kanye SCOs. Yes. I don know. So there's a lot of different things we can find depressing in here. You pivoted the story you were about to tell us something about My depressing question was, has life killed hope for any of you? And if not, then what are the things that you still have hope for and that that's heavy. Well yeah, I told you it was one of my depressing topics that I Had. Nigga was up with you today, nigga. But then I was like, but wait. 'cause while it started off rooted in depression, the more I thought about it, I was like, well that's one of the great things about having youth on your side and being young is that you have hope for so many things.


You're still Optimistic. Life hasn't fucking Kicked you in the face enough. Yes. So many. And as you get older, right, like I'm in the shower today at 44, like, you know, doing math like well another 20 to 30 years would be awesome and that makes things kind of finite, right? Like there's some things we could lose hope for. Yeah. But that's where, that's y'all gonna say it, but that's where family and kids come in, bro. Your hope now translate transfers into that. Okay? I know that that's the cool, That's the truth. Listen to me. I know that that's true for some and a cool cliche thing to say and do I too feel like that when I look at my kids and then I remember that no, we're gonna die and they're gonna keep going and they're gonna come to the funeral with the shades and shed some thug tears and then they're gonna keep it pushing on their own journey.


So even that dampens my, Oh, you just wanna be in a sad place then. Well, I'm just saying, you can feel good looking at your kid, but you can be dead and whenever you dead and then that's it. So, so that can get depressing Too. Yeah. You, you, you, you are gonna die no matter what. Answer my hope. Question. Super Dad. I just told you. Yes. I still have hope now. The hope transfers into mar kids. My but Hope for what? So that I could bring her up to be a proper functioning adult in fucking society. Yeah. I can give her the things that I didn't have coming up. Like It is almost like I'm giving her a life that I just couldn't have. Like I'm, I'm access to schools, access to these things. A It is, It is.


I get a kick outta that. That's my when you Love it, joy, when you love your kids, You have hope for anything outside of, outside of Your Daughter, your kids or your family related stuff. Like personal hope. Yeah. Any hope. Just hope. That is, that is my source of hope. It's hard to have hope in the world at large. I will say that should is fucked up out there. So I I I look into them. I agree with Ice. Yeah. Like it sounds like a, it sounds like a weird question. So I you really get to try to answer it. Nigga ain't got no hope. Nah, I got hope. I hope What? You don't have hope. I hope I got Hope. Fuck that. I got hope to see my children. You know? Oh yeah, you niggas is hopeless. I got no it's not. No it's not. My nigga S that.


You gotta stop that because You just don't share your feelings like that. But stop doing. You have to feel the same way. He do. You can't be when you, when you have kids, you can't be be selfish. No, I do. But I think that kid shit is a scapegoat and the world is just much larger. Alright, we got that. Put that to put that in our default box. Why is that a scap? What if you, what have you, what if Put that in the default Box if Food changed and now what else is there? But let, lemme Ask you a question there. The whole universe that you have hope for or that the hope has dwindled for. What if you, what if you not having hope affects your family? What if you not having hope and you being grumpy or whatever It is affects your family, affects how they move day to day. Family is important to a lot of us having hope and inspiring and and wanting them to know that no matter what happens, I'm gonna be here for you.


And I have hope to see you live and be the best person that you can be in this world. Talk. That's beautiful. I didn't think so. I'm just, I was trying to waste of rap. I'm trying some new technique. I said workshop some things. Yeah. All. You got it. I don't wanna drain y'all life. You got it. No, I get what you said. I put hope in. I mean, I agree with y'all on, on the kids in the future. But I also like, I think part of why I was activist and part of why I do the work I do is 'cause I actually believe the world can be better than we found it. I agree. Against all evidence to the contrary. 'cause the, the world looks like it's gonna be fucked up and it's only gonna get worse.


But I've seen like struggles get won. I mean, just in like the last 10 years, like, or last 20 years you seen marriage equality, people thought that would never happen. It could be something as simple as legalizing weed. Like I remember when people said that could never happen and now like you can buy weed everywhere. Like the world can be so different in 24 hours or 12 months or 20. So I, I always look to the victories and be like, we could change some other shit. Like we could, we could change, some people get housing and we could change, some people could get healthcare, we could change. So people aren't oppressed anymore. People could get their land back. Like we could do shit if we organize. That's my hope. I don't always act on the hope. Sometimes I get caught up in the day to day just wanting to eat or hope my team makes the playoffs or, or, or hope that so and so was, you know, singing. I hope that Aaron Rogers don't come to the Steelers. I got hope. Yeah. That ain't I got hope, goddammit. Yeah, that's a good hope.


But, but like there's other shit we can hope for. So like that's, that's why, that's why I, that's what keeps me energized. That's what keeps me going and hope for it. And working towards these two different things, would you say? Hell yeah. Absolutely. Well see, to me that's the difference between hope and optimism. If, if, if you hope that the world change, but you work towards contributing to the world changing, right? Like yeah. Out there. And so we can give you that and salute truth because you, you try to make it work sometimes. Yeah. You do the work. Yeah. And when I do, a lot of, a lot of us don't have the determination or not saying we don't have the determination, but a lot of us don't have the opportunities to help the world get changed or we don't know that we don't have the knowledge that you may have and the work fuels the hope. Like the more you work, the more you be like, oh this shit is winnable. Like this is a winnable fight. It's a hard fight, but it's a winn fight. That's why we say hope and not optimism. Optimism is just like, everything's gonna be all right.


Gotcha. It'll just work out. Hope is against the odds and you gotta be engaged in that shit. And you gotta actually know it's fucked up. The odds are against me, but I can still win. Hi he real quick. The the mood that, the mood that Joe described earlier, I've gotten in into that mood just looking at shit like, man, what the fuck is going on? I don wouldn't necessarily say that you're depressed. Oh no. Wait, wait. Oh sorry, go ahead. Yeah, I've gotten into that mood, like looking at shit like, yeah, ain't over that shit. You did what? What the No, no. That's my girl. I, I'm, I'm, I look at shit in society. Look at, just think about the shit that my children have to go through and just think about. Just a lot of shit that he's saying I could relate to, but my work and my determination snaps me outta that. Like if I sit in it, it fucks me up so I could relate.


How does it, does it distract you from it? It's a distraction because I, I don't want to, because then same thing with thinking that damn, I'm not gonna be here one day. That still fucks me up. Yeah. Nigga, what if something happened to one of my kids? Like all this shit, they had to take the train. What if something happened to them? Like, look, you can't even go outside and, and be free or you can't express yourself without being judged, maimed, or even attacked outside. Like, these things happen. I, I know how I'm gonna protect myself. I know the lengths I'm gonna go. But when there's other people, when you watch other people, like when you say he watches his, his brothers and he got emotional. The same thing with my daughter. My daughter Sweet 16 coming up. I started to shed a tear. I look at all the old pictures in my phone of my children, I start to cry. Same thing with j like yo Pops, I'm not gonna be here.


I'm, I'm, I'm going to go film for, for what's my man, people's name for Sugar Hill. He, I'm gonna go fill something for Joels and I'm gonna fill a cooking film, a cooking show to watch JR go on his own. It makes me a little like, damn, like I gotta beat somebody for labor now. Yeah, no No. No, because I pay him a lot of money. But what I'm saying is that I do understand those sentiments and I share with Joe. I just have to trick myself and get out of it. I can't sit in it too long. But is because I, I lay in the bed. It's been times when I was younger, 19, 20, and my mom said this, I, I lay in the house for months just in the crib, in the dark. I take a shower in the dark, I lay in the dark and I had to snap out of it. Once my back is against the wall, I have to get to it. Mm.


I feel like what you're describing now in present terms is more melancholy and nostalgia. Like, kind of like a blend of the two, especially the nostalgic part. When You're, well, what does that mean when I can't let go of the past, man? Like that's just something that's been bothering me. Nostalgia To a degree. Yeah. Like when you can't let it go, when you reminisce, I coulda did this differently or I wish I would've did that differently or I could do the song That's, that's just, that's regret. Yeah. That's just regret. No, Yeah. Regret. Yeah. Mixing it two, because I don't regret nothing. But, but You, but you sitting there saying, I damn, I should, I coulda did that differently. And you harbor on it. That's the regret. That Is regret. But the nostalgic part is sometimes thinking the past was better than it was. Like really remembering. Oh, back then everything was fine.


Everything probably wasn't fine. Nah. It wasn't just Remember good times about back then, right. You looking through roasty colored glasses about the Past. Yeah. And this is around the age that nostalgia really kind of like starts to set in. Oh hell yeah. Got It. Like really starts to set. So I try to live in the now too much hope or depression for the future. All y'all, because we got really past all y'all wake up every morning with the hope that you'll make more money. Is that true or false? True. True. Or Yeah. True. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. But like how much more for me, it's the expectation. Or like, is there, or is the day creeping up where you look at it and be like, you know what this is? Well, I'm determined to go get it.


Nah, I'm determined to go get it. Especially Now, like in my s it's so easy to so many different Ways and humanity and now it's like, Nah, I don't think so. I think That this is it. It's Easy with the news, especially as much news as you watch to that Dateline and shit. No. Used the worst of us. That's not the depressing part. That's not it. Because that to, I don't know if I'm speaking For you or Didn didn't get none of these. I got these thoughts from the, the new equalizer commercial. Right. Okay. Because one day you may have had hope that Queen Latifah could do this thing and then you see the trailer. Well see, that's your fault. She, well no Big Jersey Watch herself.


Yeah. Legend. Watch yourself Flavor Union. It's not just music. It Ain't either, it ain't just music. Go ahead. Ain't Boogie Damn Production. Throw You right out. Right. Say something wrong about flavor unit nigga Jersey. Nope. Shit. Alright, but Go ahead. No, I was just gonna say like the Dateline stuff is more outlier stuff, you know what I'm saying? Whereas the news, like, that's just the barrage of bad news and catastrophic news every fucking day. We've got like breaking news and just like, oh God, what the fuck else is gonna happen? Like we're all being kind of like worn down. Do you, oh, I'm sorry. No, Go ahead. Do you believe that we kind of responsible for what we consume?


Yes. A thousand percent. So it's like if your outlook, if you are watching the news, you watch news more than my grandmother. Like you watch a lot of news. It's what, 85, 90% negativity on the news. Almost a hundred. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So The focus on the news in that conversation will be narrow minded or looking at things in a vacuum. No, But I'm just saying it, it, it Take the news out in the mindset. We, we in this thing and we were born, our parents fucked one night. Got it done. Now we are here. This is the state of things out here. Y'all have 40 years left max that have nothing to do with the news.


What we consume. Just being here in its current state ain't the best, Ain't the worst. It ain't the worst either though. I didn't say it's the worst. So it's better than it's been years ago. And that's why I, that's why I put the news in there because if you're consuming and you're getting all the negativity, all the negative reports, you'll think It is, it's much, much worse than It is. It is bad. Be clear. But it ain't, It is been bad. It's been worse years ago. What year? Family? Most of the years. Yeah. For the most part. It's been, bro, you, you, you say all the time you wish you was in the sixties, seventies.


If you really think about it, you really think you wanted to be around in the sixties and seventies. Like it, it, it was Worse. I I'd have killed Bobby Womack. Bobby Womack would've been dead. Dead. I ain't gonna hold you Dead. That's the question. I ain't gonna hold you. Sam Cook didn't have brothers. Somebody supposed to Sam Cook didn't have older cousins or somebody. I think about that a lot. That was that, that, that might be top Three. Bobby Womack should have been dead in front of the town hung on top of the telephone floor on display. It's like sneakers. Sometime when you do enough trash shit on your own, you can't worry that much about what somebody else doing. Nah. Yeah, but that cook a Lot. Hell nah. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn know that stop.


Nah, fair Read Aretha Franklin's biography. That's all I'm gonna say. What, What Sam Cook did to Aretha Franklin? I'm gonna say what he did, bro. Tell us. I'll just say Sam Cook and it wasn't just him, it was all the, first of all, the RB circuit and the gospel circuit were two of the freakiest places ever. Like the, the gospel circuit was like where they was orgies and all kinds of shit. Right. I mean That's still kind of true about the gospel. Is this Aretha's book? Yeah, it's read, read David Rich's book on Aret. That's even better. Okay. That's the one that has all the good shit in it. It the link, I send you the link 12. But Frank had a baby at 12. Not by Sam cookbook, by somebody else, but Sam was getting down with a lot of r and b singers when they were 13, 14, 15 years old. So that's part of why he ain't noticed what was going on in his own household.


Oh yeah. I don't know about that. Don't don't do that. Hey Joe, I'm with you. Bob. Bobby was supposed to have been Yeah, like Mark saying the right thing again. Bobby Womack would've been dead no matter what. I don care what the Fuck was happening. What said Fuckers You talking about whatever he did, don't nobody deserve for you the wear they clothes wore his suit. Where they clothes to the funeral. Take my wife and then fuck my daughter. And it's a lot. It's a lot. It's a lot. They was nasty back then, man. And will make songs about it. That's the ill part. Remember Roberta Fleck song, Jesse, you know it's for Jesse Jackson.


Nah. No I did not. Jesse come home. This bed is, yeah. Hey, fair. Hold on. Get the Fuck That. Yo, mark. Hold on. Gimme two seconds. I didn know That. Play that as your sleeper please. Flat told me that. Two seconds. Gimme two. What? Yo Gimme Yo, you read a lot of celeb books. Mark is Ill He knows. Fuck that. No, he said Roberta told to his asshole. I didn if that was true, Roberta told I read it then I asked her if it was true. I can, I don't mind saying it since she's passed away. Rest in peace. Breath the lyrics. My It is Read, read the Jesse come home. There's a hole in the bed where we slept. Now it's growing cold. Jesse, your face in a place where we lay by the heart all apart.


It hangs on my heart. Your dog, your face in a place. Hey Jesse, it's lonely. Come home. Jesse was putting it down. Jesse was Beating, He was getting, he was Getting away from that doctor. But to your point, Jesse's background singers was in the seventies. I mean, Roberta's background singers was in the seventies, in the eighties. One of Jesse's daughters. Same thing. It's a lot of cross pollination. Yeah, cross poll. That's a good word. That's yeah, that's a nice way to put it. That's a nice way to put it. I'm trying to be diplomatic birds be Is it, I mean this was before Dr. King died or, or after. It is all after anything. Anything you know about Jesse Jackson is probably after, because King died in 68. This was 70, whatever. Just making sure, just putting things together in my head. Just making sense.


He got off on that when that Dr. King shit, he got off. Yeah. Yeah. He stepped this shit up. He got Dr. Kick out the way, now he became the picker. So Jesse was doing catch his name, put Jesse on top. Yo. Like you never think about that Mark. He was dead. You gotta I know you got some theories on that. People have definitely thought about that. Hopefully down the line. You could share it with me when he, when he passed away or something. 'cause he just, he just be around. Nobody say nothing to that nigga son. Who the fuck is he? Yo I mean, he's a, he's a big important guy. Shout out to Jesse Jackson. Shout out to my hero Jesse Jackson. Wait, He Ain't right. Nevermind, nevermind. He ain't tricking me.


No, he ain't tricking me. He on your List. Oh, but that's different. That's personal. Oh, okay. Oh, that personal, you know him personally? Yeah. Jesse, Jesse was a mentor man, Jesse, the first time I went to Africa was with Jesse Jackson. He took me to Africa. So you went, if you, if you knew anything, you wouldn't kick his back in right now. Yeah, no, I respect that. No, I'll fall back. But there's nothing to know. 'cause he's been perfect except for the public scandals. Oh, yep. Hopefully we don't get the Justine Island report to come out. Mark might have been, mark might have been on. Oh shit. He was a plus one man. He might, he might have been on Jesse's boat, nigga.


He had boat. I didn had no boats, no islands, nothing. I'm good man. Did you go to the million man March? No, I didn't. I didn't. I wish I did, but didn didn't. Why didn't you? It was a couple reasons. Part of it was, it was, it was in middle of, we weren't allowed to go like it was basketball season. We weren't allowed to go. And also it was, I had some ideological issues with it, You know what I mean? At the time. But I wish I had gone now in retrospect. Mm. I wish I had gone back Then. You wasn't fucking With it. I I still had the same, the issues I have did I have now, but I would've gone just to be part of history. Okay, so you still ain't fucking with it.


I, I I a million people marching against it. Like marches is supposed to be, marches is supposed to be, let him go, go for a thing. Right. The march on Washington was the march on Washington. Four jobs in freedom. You know what I'm saying? In 63, like you march and protest a system to me, you march against your oppressor, you march against a power structure. I didn't like the idea of a million black men getting together to march against themselves. For me, I thought that there were, I would've marched for structural things. I would've march for systemic things. I would've, I would've been fighting for power. I understood Farrakhan's argument and I, I don't think he's wrong. I just would've, I would've organized the march differently. Be careful. No, I've, I've, I've I've expressed that to him directly.


Ooh. And no, it's not flat. Told him. Little tiny. Tell him, look right here. Make sure, make Sure you understand why. Very Impressive. Make sure. Yeah. Nah, shout out to fair call. Shout, shout out to to everybody who was a part of the Million Man March. Ain't no brother Mark. Oh God. So you would've organized it differently, would you saying? Yeah. Yeah. I would've organized it differently. But I love the idea of us coming together in a spirit of love and tradition. I mean, to get a million people a million, million plus on that mall was a amazing That's nice. For real. It was a beautiful site. Holy Shit. I hate y'all. We can't never be serious.


Even though this has been a pretty serious, I pretty Serious fan. Lot of us been morbidity. This has been a piss boy job at being serious Because you get serious and hop right out of it. Right. Hop back. Yeah. Laughing. Lemme tell you I'm Depressed. Lemme depress y'all. You Double double. You double Dutch with seriousness. Do you have any hope guys? And then we were like, no. And he's like, this is too fucking depressing. Yeah. Then you crack jokes. Yeah. That bipolar, Y'all get carried away with the hopeless shit. Like I was just asking Jesus, Where's Therapists for the crew when you need it? Jesus. Lighten up Lord Pricks. Hey, you a Knicks fan. Tell, tell me about what's going on with Tracy Morgan.

S right in the front by the table. Tracy Morgan has replied to that already. He says it was fool poisoning is the reason that he was throwing up courtside at the nick game. Mm. That's unfortunate. And it's a spooky thing because we know Tracy to have had health issues in the past. Of course. We don't look at it like somebody just throwing up like a regular person throwing up. So he says he is all right. Thank God he is all right. I know he's a staple at these Knicks games. We see him all the time. Yeah. Talk Shit to you. He made jokes off of that. He was like, yeah, they want to know when I threw up on the court.

God, I would like to hear before we go from Mark and Mel about this, Jonathan Majors, did he aggress yo the Aggress leaked call Where He was at? Is it real? Is it not? That's Rolling Stone. Put this out. Hey, I'm still going to See that movie next Week. Magazine Dreams. Yeah. Yeah. Rolling Stone is usually pretty credible with vetting sources. That's what I'll say. And there's the audio usually, usually. And I have no, you know, I don't, I don't know any, I don't have any reason to think it's not real, but I, you know, who knows? She, they released it and he's on audio acknowledging that he aggressed that's the language he used his, his former girlfriend.


And she said you and she named like three things. He did. Like, you grabbed me, you choked me. It's like all these things. And he was like, that was all covered under, All under aggress, Which is a little bit of a snarky take when you're apologizing for for, for being violent to somebody. And for a lot of people, that was the s not a s confirmation. Yeah. But confirmation of what had been he'd been accused of. And a lot of people had been running for him saying he didn't do anything. He's innocent. He's been framed and he sort of understated what he did. And this audio kind of changes that. The timing of It is interesting to me. That's what I'm saying. The why of It is interesting 'cause of The movie that he's gonna, and his career is kind of being revived. Yeah. Right. As his, so I wonder if somebody said, look, I have this Trump card and I'm gonna wait until he's revived again to do it.


Because if you dump that all at once, he can then recover from it. Who's Who. Yeah. I, I agree with you. Whose rumor to have it's anonymously just put out there That, that part. I don't know. I, I didn't see a source or, or a a an a a like a allegation of a source. So I don't know. But I'm genuinely curious about the timing of it. But regardless of the timing of it, if he did it, people have a right to play that car whenever they want. So I'm not, I'm not defending it, but It is interesting to think about the, the strategic, the strategic nature of, of maybe the release. There's some people in Hollywood who don't want Jonathan Majors to win. Whether you agree with him or not. It's true. It's been very clear. I've heard this in on camera and I've heard this behind the scenes. There are people who feel very strongly about him, honestly, in ways that they don't about other actors or producers who have done similar things or worse things.


So I'm, I'm curious to know the why of that as well. What's the reason why he's black? And I don I don't think it's just him being black. I mean, that's part of it. But I know even black people who have been able to recover from. So do you think that it's part of the rumor that he was extraordinarily difficult to work with? Like that was a pervasive, that that could pervasive, pervasive rumor. But I'm always, I'm always, you know, kind of like skeptical about that. Oh. Difficulty to work with kind of thing. Because there's other factors that play into it as to why somebody might wanna carry with, carry on with that narrative. And, and, and I've seen both. I've seen people who just walk with dignity and have like a commitment to what they want. And they have, and they, and people process that as audacity, right?


Yeah. But I've also worked with assholes. I mean, I, I could tell you, I mean just that a good example is page one in the past. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Worked with No, nobody up here is like that. Honestly. I mean, most, most, most everybody here is great. You know, and those who aren't guys still working on them. It, it, it's, it, it's, it's really like, I was thinking about like VH one where like when I, when I would work particularly on like, like certain like reality shows where I could see a lot of the cast was dope and some people who on camera were called behind the, on the camera called hard to work with behind the scenes. They really were hard to work with. You can always tell about who the camera people fuck with. True. Like when the camera people be like, yo fuck him. Yeah. They get the worst angle. That's always a very good i i lighting shit.


Always believe them because that's who they, who will get the brunt of the, the bad behavior. And so I don't know if Jonathan Majors is good to work with, easy to work with or hard to work with. But that narrative is probably connected to somebody feeling strongly about him. And that would, that could play into this. So I don I don't know, but I, I do know that this timing isn't good for Jonathan Majors. But I mean like we went through the entire, you know, trial process and he was found guilty like on a couple of the charges. So like related to being the aggressor. So it's kind of like, well what I Don it's all about reminding the public of why they shouldn't like you. Yeah. Well then the, so That you don't Get the forward then the timing is, is suspicious based on the fact that this movie Machine Dreams was everybody, it was like a really big, big deal at Sundance like a couple of years ago.


And then everybody like Sony dropped it and it was like, okay, it's never gonna fucking come out. And now he's had like this resurgence and they're like, okay, we're gonna put the movie out and now here we are again. Right. So discussing, yeah, We'll see what happens. The good thing is the, if the public does not Care Care then it's over like, like he's able to finally move on and I had this thing hanging behind it. 'cause he may, he may have known that audio was there the whole time and, and be constantly afraid of when it's gonna get released. And I'm not trying to tape for Jonathan Majors again. Whatever he did, he should have accountability. Yeah. That's the scariest part about all of It is that the public could not care about a domestic violence in incident against women. Right. Exactly. And and that's actually the problem. Like, he should be held accountable. He should, he should. Whatever. But it seems to me he has been held accountable.


Yeah. When y'all do that, what, what's wrong with y'all? Us. Why you being sarcastic? I'm not, that's the scariest part is that the public could potentially not hear about something like that. So It is our job to keep it always at the forefront of things. Yo listen Jonathan, major shit man. I see the growth. It is diff you know, listen, let that nigga get back what he needs to get back, man. What he was charged with It is Unintentional. What was it again, Mel? Like Willfully Obtuse. Mel ain't helping you. It is still up for you. She ain't fucking with you this episode. She fucking with me. She Too Cool. It made you was too beyond the limit. No, but that was to you nigga.


But I'm gonna cheer out. You Didn't read it like that. It Doesn't matter who was two. It's still inappropriate. Okay. Play inappropriate jokes. Yeah. But if somebody, if somebody had lost a parent and had to deal with that, that very thing, I mean you could see how that would be a trigger point. Understood. But I'm not thinking in real time about mad. That's what makes it inconsiderate. You're inconsiderate. I am an inconsiderate person. Yeah. But I said that's why somebody would be tight. And what about you? Okay, let's, let's no on lemme get at in. What about Yeah, I'm sure I'm too, I would apologize too, but I would understand why somebody would be tight with me. Yeah, but you still do inconsiderate shit. You inconsiderate your, your your Workers far. Yeah. Come on ma. Yeah, but that's all right. So you should understand it and extend grace, like flip mean that especially if I say my, I'm my fault that Yeah. I thought that was a great apology and didn didn't double down on that.


'cause obviously I know it's, it's sensitive and I thought that was a great apology, man. That one of the best I ever heard. Seriously. It was. And fuck you guys, It was sincere. It was from the heart. It was beautiful. It's true. You accepted accountability. That was wonderful. You Just messed up by saying if, but you know. Yeah. If, if if was the fifth, we all be drunk, man. That Was wow. Close. Fuck. Come on. What a pod. What a pod you guys, that's what I'm talking about. And high. Right? Okay. Holy shit. Sleepers. He's gotta suck for Michael B. Jordan. He was just getting cool with him again.

Don't drop that shit. Aw fuck. Ah, change my number Again. But it, I, if I'm telling you that I aggressed you don't fucking highlight. Highlight what is another, what the aggress done. Yeah. That was crazy. Action Was I I thought she was right. You gotta, you gotta do that shit. When did he have this conversation with her Right after the situation? I don't, I don't have the, it it was, it was soon after but I don't have the exact date or time table. Like how far after. But yeah, I mean 'cause sometimes say Ires allows you to gloss over what you actually did.


Got it. Because language matters. Yeah. So, and he's used those words specifically. I understand. Yeah. He and behavior is real important in those incidents. Seriously like Yeah, yeah. True. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, I'm done. And I feel better. That's good. S good. That's really bad. That's important. Yeah, that's important. Dude, you guys happy? We can bring a little joy today.
