I got hit so fast and got concussed so expeditiously that the hand eye coordination is one of the first thing to go yo It is after you get concussed.


I'm gonna keep saying concussed. I want a case. So this workplace injuries said 10 of them or something. So yeah, I'm working on 11. No, but seriously though man, that, that, that throw was crazy. That throw was crazy. But I'm glad people got good humor. And you fucked up told and you told about on your show. I did because I, you know that I really did have a concussion. It was a mild one.

Tell me. Put you get in an argument and then you do This shit where you start puffing up getting louder. Like you going intimidate niggas and like, like you the only nigga that could fight. And so what it looks like is just from just, I'm talking as a viewer and somebody sitting here that you get the wrong idea about niggas that you think you're gonna scare niggas out the conversation.

And I, I I did think the same thing. I agree with Mel. I think you need to just take a, sometimes it's okay to get up and just get the fuck outta here and just trust your people.


You know what I'm saying? That's why how I feels sometimes. Like you don't have to take all the pressure that you take. You shouldn't. 'cause it's a lot on you and you and, and you are a perfectionist. So on top of the pressure, on top of one perfection, that can cause some fucked up shit to happen. You can help me doc.

You say when it's too peaceful at home, you, It is, It is whack. She started bringing up bitches cooking for me. s not, and yes, that's wrong. And Then we went outta time Though. That's wrong. Alright, We went outta time. I haven't shut down a bar in New York City and Oh, y'all shut the spike. Oh, we shut down a strip club. Oh my God. The lights came on. Y'all. Some birds or the strip club? The strip club. They walking out in they sweatsuits. And y'all still in there pretty much? No, just the lights is coming on. Like we lost track of time.


You know I'm never in the strip life no more. Yeah, We got there late too. We had a good time. Okay. We did it the way it was supposed to be done. We did. And some nigga in there cracked 60 K. Oh Yeah. Yeah. Excuse crypto bros. Sitting there going ham. Ham. Yeah. And it was kind of quiet. It was kind of dead. But he was making it lit. Yeah. What's the word that the, the people are using? We're in Ale. Ale. Kle. Apocalypse. Fuck. Kleptocracy the fuck. What's that word you talking about? Kleptocracy? Yes. That's the word. What's that? That's homeboy. I'm asking a doctor. What? That's homeboy. Busing down 60 K or crypto. Oh, you talking about a crypto? Yes. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, crypto cracy. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Crypto.


That's different. Meaning the crypto niggas is up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Breaks it. Yeah. That's it. That's all it means. But we did have a good time. We did have What's up though? That's nice. Did have a great time. That's always good. That's what's up man. Let's get right to it. Let's do it. This might not be right to it. It's all right to it. It's definitely not, let's get right to it, but delayed a little bit. Reactions from Jake Paul versus Tyson? Who saw it? I watched it. I watched it. What did we think? I watched it on the airplane. Yeah. I fell asleep while This shit was buffering. That's like, not even joking. The buffering. I didn't have any issues with my shit. Me Neither. I had a couple issues but wasn't as bad as everybody else. Oh, y'all niggas paying y'all shit on time. Yeah. Yeah. Y'all count Netflix. Netflix Premium.


Yeah. The note, the, I'm talking shit. I don't even know that serious. There is, there's, there's layers now on Netflix. There is. Or tears I should say. But I watched this fight and, and thought the entire, maybe by like round four, I said, yo, Mike's not throwing punches. Yeah. That was my first takeaway. And then I said, ah, he's 60. No, no. Oh boy. I'm not trying to throw punches. Oh boy. That's literally what I took from that. He Looked tired too. I'm talking about are are you a conspiracy theories? A little bit. A little bit. Hey, that's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing the conspiracy theory. Well, I said beforehand when we came in before the fight, I said this is WWE e to me. You did say that. I heard you say that. Said that this is maybe not scripted in terms of like a full on.


Okay, I'm gonna throw this punch. You're gonna duck. Right. But yo We talk beforehand. Yo, we gonna go in. I ain't gonna try to take your head off Paul. Yeah, we just gonna go ahead and put on a show for the people. We're gonna make it look real. We're gonna do whatever we gotta do in the press. You know, we're gonna sell the fight, but I ain't trying to kill you. Hmm. I think at any moment Mike could've knocked his lights out. I think the other way or And the other way I think. And the other, I think neither one of them were trying to do that. It was just Jake. Jake Paul showed that towards the end. But they have some conspiracy theories and some clips showing that after Mike hit Jake, Jake might've whispered to him and Mike tapped him on the back twice. And then after that, Mike talk. Yeah. Mike didn't fight him or try to go at him anymore.


Then Mike kept try biting his gloves to, I guess signal something. I don't, no. I guess what the frustration, what y'all think, what I think what did y'all think again? About, about the, the match. Everything. Yeah. I didn't like it the night. I didn't, I mean, you know, I mean the whole night was, was was good. I didn't like the Tyson and Jake Paul fight. I mean, you know Amanda Serrano. Yeah. I think fight. It might even be a disservice to start with the Tyson fight. Honestly, the early fight was good. Amanda Serrano that Amanda s ser fight. They a good fight was the fight. That was the fight was fight. She always puts on the show. Shout out to her and Jordan. She, she, she always puts on the show. I ain't shout. Who's Jordan? The manager. Oh, okay. Shout out to Jordan. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I ain't shouting that other girl out girl.


I wanted jump some bullshit. I wanted to jump through the screen. That, that's Katie. That decision was bullshit. You think that you think she got robbed? Yes. Hell yes. No, she got robbed. I thought so too. I thought so. I mean, the punch count was enough. Yeah. She laid in a hundred more punch. Some people said, but you know, they weren't powerful punches, they weren't impactful punches, all that stuff, you know, it's not just a punch count, but to me just, but the eyeball test and I ain't no boxing expert. It looked like she whooped her ass with that, with that big cut over her eye. Still even being able to see and fight and looked like she was, wasn't affected by that dog. She was wiping stand there. Yeah. Every two seconds. And, and the girl, which is what was killing me the whole time, just kept leaning that head into, into that cut. Yes. Every time she did it, I jumped back like, ah, oh my god.


God, that shit was nasty, bro. Hey, flip the manager, you shout it out. Was that the dude that was talking? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Shouts to him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's great. Shouts both for them. Shout in the post game. But I mean, in the post-fight, he said what everybody was thinking like he, he got up there and just told it like it was, fuck this. Her big ass head. She up your head button. Motherfuckers shit looked like she was about to go to sleep towards the end of that shit. The white girl Katie Taylor. I, I got a little emotional though on the plane though. It sound crazy 'cause I know them. What? Yeah, I did. I got a little emotional. 'cause I know them and I know how, I know how hard Amanda goes for, for the sport of boxing and even putting women, taking women's boxing to the next level. She advocates for that. And to watch where she came from when I was filming skits with her back in the days to where she's at now.


It's emotional. And I know that she's not gonna, that cut wouldn't stop her. Yeah. Like I kept seeing Katie leaning into the cut. She kept leaning into that cut. And I know that Amanda was in pain, but she's just such a champion. I'm not gonna stop. She, she fought through all no warrior. And then they robbed her again. It is the second time. I mean, Katie said they, you know, they wanna do a th she'll do run it back again. Which I think it would be a great draw. But it's just like, I'd watch that as, as the only headliner this person. Yeah. When, when what? That that woman, it might be the toughest woman I've ever seen. Yeah, Amanda. Right. I would've paid for her to go in the back shower, get some stitches and come back out and fight. Jake Paul. Well she's on Jake Paul's team.


He put all then come out and fight Mike. She needed, she needed she damn. Yeah. Damn. Like just looking at her, her arms, she's tough. She's thorough. She's tough. Impressive. Yeah. Puerto Rican. Puerto Rico. I've, I've seen her, I've seen, I've seen her fight before. But, but different level of respect. I've never seen her fight until this one here. And I was just like, wow. What does that say to the sports of the sport of boxing? Right. Like what does that say? Like this, the second time she got robbed, I mean It is that the, the highest paid women in boxing? You know, the highest paycheck they both received, but It is the second time that she got robbed. What does that say? Are they for me, there's no sports without robbery. Got it. That's how you look at it. Yeah.


Human error is a part of sports. Yeah. Ooh. Boxing especially. Especially boxing. There so much, so much judgment, But all opinion, all of them. Shit, I Interpretation. Yeah. This, this year in the NBA we seeing more than ever them go over there to the TV for three minutes, come back and still get the call wrong. And get it wrong. Yeah. Shit. NFL we been seeing it. Yeah. They have rule changes because they fuck it up here. And then after the season, all right, let's fix this. Now we got a new rule change. So everything that just happened is, is null and void damn near last. I understand. I understand. I understand. Yeah. And we, and I wanna see you and I wanna see you go make Thriller after they rob you for off the wall. Ooh. Like if we take that away, then the artists, the greatest of our acts are never pushed to that other level.


That's true. Because that's part of the story at that point. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. That's a good one. I mean, Katie was tough. She was Fuck that big as girl was. I mean, she landed some hard ass blow. She did. She did. Katie. Katie was tough. But I think that it, I took all that away when I saw that she was intentionally trying to go for her cut intentionally. Like she, I know, I know Mark. But she like that shit. It's a smart thing to do. Yeah. It is very smart to do. But it's when you know the person is fucked up. That's how I felt like, damn. Like, ah, take advantage of a weakness. Yeah, you gotta do it. But it didn't work for who? I shout out to Amanda and Jordan won. Man. Shout out to Amanda and Jordan.


Can't wait for your next fight. Cannot wait for her next fight. Alright. Back to Tyson and fucking dude, I. hope he never, I I hear all the theories and some of them have been debunked, you know, like the tapping on the thing, which is true. He did do that. But that was actually, people doctored the video that was 17 seconds in that he did the tap and Tyson's most powerful punches came after the tap on the back. But at the end of the day, to me the simplest explanation, as I always say, is probably the most likely one a a damn near 60-year-old man. S razor. Yeah, exactly. A a a 60-year-old man can't beat a 30-year-old man. Apples to apples. You know what I mean. Well, I mean, it's not apples to apples. Exactly. But Mike just had surgery a few months ago. Oh yeah, exactly. I'm Mike, Mike might Issues that he had back in June. They were like they were severe. Yeah. Blood transfusion, all that shit.


Yeah, Mike actually might, might be what? On his way out? No, no, no, no, no. I'm just, just from boxing. I'm just saying like, got you. He's good. Mike is healthy You know what I mean. But Jake Paul does this You know what I mean. He hasn't done it against any elite boxers yet. And I don't know if he's an elite boxer, but he's a professional boxer. And Mike Tyson is, I mean, in 2005 when Mike Tyson retired, he's like, I can't do this anymore. I didn't have it in me no more. He did? Yes. That that was 19 years ago. Like, you don't get better. Like, did you real? No. Did you see Holy Field say that they want the trilogy. Holy Field put it, put it on Instagram. Yo they calling for the trilogy and Tyson said, our friendship is the trilogy. That was Tyson's. Everybody just want payday now. That's it. That's it. That's it. Everybody want a payday.


I'm I'm seeing, I'm seeing the established boxes like the champions call out Jake Paul. It, it's It is shit. I gained a little more respect for Jake Paul, honestly. Yeah, me too. The way he handled that last round especially. Yeah. When he, to me it looked like he could have not put Mike on his wallet and he didn't toward the end. Yeah. In the last couple rounds. Shit. Yeah. He bowed to him. He showed love. I respect that. I I the bow. Yes. The mercy part. I'm not gonna give him so much. I'm gonna play this clip from John Jones who also won because he shouldn't have been there with him. That's how you look at it. Prevention is better than the q. Yeah. I Got it. No, I feel, I feel like Jake did what the smart fighter would do, which is recognize that that man could put me down or, or hurt me at least.


So there's no need to, there's no need to do this. There's no need to engage. Mm. Let me find this clip. Mm. I do think that that first round was the first round. Round one was round one. Yes. Yeah. I also believe that Mike had to bite his gloves, the whole rest of the fight to prevent him from throwing a punch. 'cause he got that tick. It could be no, I, for me there's no other reason to bite Mike. Mike was out out of it later on. Mike did not try to fight him. His legs look bad, man. That's all I saw. I just, yeah. But It is the punches. Didn't like Roy Jones. His legs look bad. His punches look That is absolutely fine. Yo Roy Jones. He was the hating What a horrible job of commentating Roy Jones did.


Elite level hating. Yeah. I saw you. I saw you tell Roy Jones shut ups. That's like, shut the fuck up. Roy Jones. That was our man. John Don. You damn Joe. That was our man Jones. Rosie Perez trying to keep it cute up there. Shout to Rosie. Shout to Rosie Hood. Legend Roy Jones. Man come. Oh my God. Alright. This is when Holyfield came back. John Jones went and just Kind of iced him in in very quick fashion. And I think Jake probably could have done that later on in the fight. But he, he opted to, I don't let Mike get To the be don. I Don't think Jake gave him mercy. I think Jake played it smart. I think that's what it was. I think, Jake, I agree with this. You're winning. Let's stop while you're ahead. Let's, let's, let's coast, let's get through this fight.


'cause Mike can, can drop anyone with one shot. You know, his legs weren't working, but that upper body was still moving and those punches were still swinging. And I don't really, I didn't view it as Jake given a mercy, Jake coasted through that and like an intelligent fighter would I about it? I agree. I can about it. And when you say that the people looking for a payday, I think that a lot of boxers now just want to shut Jake Paul up. Like you, you came from YouTube and you came into sport. You making, you making a lot of money in the sport. That's the smoke and mirror part of it. Yeah. They also don't payday come attached with. Yeah, no. They do want to, they do wanna a payday Joe, but a lot of them wanna shut him up. I can see both being true. I think that, I think that the, the competition outweighs the payday for me for some of them.


Because some of them makes money. Like Javonte Davis. He can, he, he makes money. Canelo makes money. So it's more like, okay, you, we feel that as a YouTuber. You've been making a mockery of the sport. You calling out whoever you want to call out and you're getting it and you're getting a lot of money on top of that. So now we are going to show you. No, see Tay, I don't put in that talk 'cause Tay sound like I I'm gonna just do this for free when I see you. Yeah, Tay. Yes, yes. Whenever I catch you, I'm just gonna learn you. I don't want to dime so I'm not talking about him. Canelo Alvarez. You think Canelo Alvarez, if he was, I don't put Canelo in there neither. Even though he's running from homeboy. He's running from homeboy. But I don't put Canelo in there. He be listening. Don't say that you get shout, shout out to Canelo and I wouldn't fight him, but Shit.


It is what It is. Let's be clear. But. yeah. Why? I don't even see the other person in this Jake Paul Lane of bringing in a hundred million dollars on some exhibition fight. Retired fighters. Shit. Like he's really carved out. Yeah, he did. Car. Floyd, Floyd. Floyd. Floyd is Floyd. Yeah. So he and Floyd commands, he just commands that Floyd did it after being a professional boxer. Right. Got it. I hired on top, Floyd was box office as a professional boxer. That's just right. Which led to him being able to do this after the fact. Jake Paul wasn't that, but I loved what Tyson had to say after the fight about his view of it. I loved watching him come in the ring by itself.


I that I liked. Yeah. I, you know, newly he come in try. But the posts he made, the post he made about, hey, I almost lost my life a few months ago for the young fans, for the kids to be able to see me, for me to get this one last view in the ring, Thank you to Jake Paul Thank you this It is loss, but this is a win in every aspect for me. Real class. Very Classy. Super Classy. Yeah. Really classy response. Mike talked, Mike talked like he got a, a, a new outlook on life or something Not new. Well, you know how he's been like that for a minute. He's been like this for a minute. It Is not, some people have like a, a close to death scare or something and then they have like a different viewpoint on everything. But also that like even his interview with with Jazzy where he was like, yo, when you going, you're gone. I don't care about like some people Legacy thing.


Yeah. Have those moments where it's like, you almost lost my life now the way I treat all of This shit now is totally different. Yeah. And as at that age, he's also thinking about, you know, he has probably has more time behind him than he has in front of him. So just let me get this payday fuck my legacy. And I, and I've done it all already And I've done it all. Exactly. It's all bucket listy almost to me. Yeah. For, from Mike. Like, let me just show I can still do, I wanna do this. Right. That's what It is. But I'm not like that invested in The outcome, the Outcome of the fight. Right, right. It seemed like Mike's whole purpose was just a don't don't get knocked out. And just to prove to himself maybe that he can go the entire length of the fight. Yeah. With a kid basically. Yeah. That's it. Yeah.


Win, lose or draw. I don't, that's not the point of this. I just want to, I did all, was it 10 rounds? Yeah. I, I, eight, eight rounds. Excuse me. Oh eight. The before 10. That's right. I did all eight rounds. People thought I at 58 years old, people thought I maybe couldn't do it. Or maybe he put me down or whatever I did that I respect that I knew he was gonna lose when he started talking like that. When he is like, I don't care about leg. What I heard him say is, I don't mind having another loss on my record. I don't care about what history. History knows who I am. Like no one thinks about Muhammad Ali getting his jaw broke by Cooney in the seventies. You know what I mean. Like no one thinks about that stuff. Right. You are who you are. Yeah. And so he's like, I'll take this 20 million in in another loss rather than trying to preserve some legacy that don't matter when I die.


But do you think that comes with time? Because when you're in the sport initially and you, you know, you, you try not to lose. Yeah. But does it come with time and wisdom and, and and and having to take a loss. You know what I mean and legend status and greatness. It ain't just time. Yeah, yeah. Greatness as well. Because Ali handled that loss well as you know, good as well because he had legend status. It's the greatness thing. It's like once you, once you're cemented, it doesn't matter what you do after. Like there's nothing that Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson or Floyd could do that would change how we see them. But, but I'm sorry to drag this topic on, but then you watch how Floyd goes as as hard as he went to not lose. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. To preserve that legacy.


Floyd didn't lose to nobody but ti I think no. He ain. No. But, but, but but to not lose Mark, like in his mind, I think Floyd puts legacy in status of a He does Well is It. is It is it That became his brand though. Is it? But it, so I'm selling Undefeated. Undefeated. But It is in a different time. Like time zone meaning That. is it a different, like Floyd is more type real quick. Muhammad Ali was back in the days, civil rights, all that shit has, you had to stand up for something, send for something to the fall for anything. So I'm fighting for a cause. Yeah. Tyson guy from Brooklyn You know what I mean. Went through bullying, overcame that. A white guy took him in. He became champion, the youngest champion and then Floyd, I mean what was money?


Yeah, money and brand Like, like Floyd was, I think he was like 46, 47 something in Oh. At the time. And he already went and trademark 50 in. Oh. Because it was, nobody had reached that point. So I want to be the one to do that. Everything with him is about the brand Got it. So everybody fought for something different. That's all. Congrats to Mike Tyson. Shout out to every fighter on that bill. For sure. Do we care about the Netflix servers? Nah. Yeah. Get the hell out. Yeah. Yeah we do. I mean, I was sleep. Yeah, we do. I was sleep through all that. I woke up at the Amanda fight. Nah, I watched even a couple of the earlier fights and you, you get a little spinning.


Shit was jamming up. Shit. My shit was sped the whole time. Damn. Mine too. I was, and I was on the airplane. Whose account you use? Mine. I mean 65 million people watching something. Yeah. Yeah, of course. It's a lot. But they need to work that out. If they gonna have the NFL. The NB You know what I mean. They trying to do major WW events. Yeah. W wwe all that shit. They need to work that out. They smoked that with they Right. Coming off the fight announcing or show in the commercial for their NFL, their NFL games. They smoked that. Yeah. And then later I learned about the Beyonc performance. Yeah. They got, they got good games for, for for Christmas. They trying to, you know, attack, attack the NBA. The NBA always had a Christmas game. Yeah. So now that the NFL has Christmas games, which they had 'em last year, but now Netflix has it and they got Pittsburgh and Kansas City as the one o'clock in Baltimore and Houston with Beyonc doing a halftime show on Christmas day.


Hey Netflix, fix it before halftime that. Yeah. That's, that's interesting that you say that about the NFL wanting to attack. Yeah. The NBA that makes me think that's they both doing it. It's so, it's so interesting that the NBA are having ratings issues yet in the NFL is where you don't know where you gotta go to watch a game. They having no problem at all. YouTube, Amazon, next ES espn, regular TV ESPN like football fans is hopping around or paying the $500 YouTube package. Whatever it cost, I Got it for them. I don't know.


I, I can't put my finger on why the NBA is having these issues. It's interest Gilbert, the game ain't as interesting no more to a lot of people bro. That's just really it. Like I say it all, we sound like old niggas when we say it. I personally know we me, I don't wanna watch seven Footers Chuck three pointers. Yeah, same. That shit is whack to me. I don't wanna watch nobody where you don't, you have a big man pause that won't get down in the middle. Like there's no dunks. There's no dunks, dunks, there's nothing. And y'all don't have either a big man to Chuck threes a big man banging in the post. Wow. 76ers lost nine in the last 10 games. I'm not here to do that with y'all right now.


Thank you. Why do you think the NBA quickly? I, I, I think the answer is I think there's no, there's not enough marketable superstars anymore. I think as LeBron moves toward the sunset, there's not another LeBron, another Kobe, another MJ that makes people watch, even if they're not interested, win beyond is not what you wanna see. And then I think the style of play, I think it's the same thing. I think the style of play is not what people wanna see anymore. And the superstar and that's good for the best players is international. That's, and that's why it's good for the NBA really? Because, because they was doing all of that, highlighting all of the international players in a certain way thinking that that would broaden the audience. And it did. It did. Yeah. But it did. Then where did they go? I think the playoffs, you'll see 'em back.


Like, people are gonna wanna see win. Ima in the playoffs. Oh, I'm, I'm watching the playoffs. After after You're talking about the whole season though. That's why they started. That's start game. I'm, I'm, I'm in. Yeah. That's why they started this NBA cup shit. Yeah. In season tournament. Which is the tournament shit. It's interesting because they're trying to find a way to get some eyes. It was successful for them though. Yeah, yeah. No it works as a fan. I didn't find it. Same. Yeah, because who care? The Lakers won that the first time, right? Yeah. Yeah. And then they, I mean like they didn't win the championship. I want regular No international. I want a regular dude from the hood one, you know? No Dad You know what I mean. Grew up hungry. I need, I mean, one of them niggas, they go, that's all I'm saying. Out the mud. Yeah. It is 20 and 10 every night. You know what I mean. I I want those kind of stories again. Like we used to have in the nineties and two thousands.


That's what now we got. He played ball with goats and shit. Ex. Exactly. Exactly. Man. That's Ghost. We're used to you Yeah. Man. You excited about this Beyonc shit? Yeah. Are you beehive? I mean, yeah, of course. I love Beyonc. Oh, nevermind. No. Yeah, yeah, that's, Yeah. What? That wasn't, you fell that Was safe. No. Safe. No. That wasn't the beehive answer. No, it was safe. She can't say no, I'm not beehive. She just forget it. Alright. Still we go. They might not include me just because I didn't make her like the Renaissance concerts. So, you know. But I love her music and I love, love, love watching her performances. She's fucking amazing. Yeah. Like It is highly enjoyable.


So I'm Looking forward To So you're excited for this? I am excited for this. This Is like the biggest halftime Not super show ever. Super Bowl. Not Super Bowl show. Absolutely. Yeah. Yo, all This shit has been making me pocket Watch Beyonc Beyonc. How you do that? It's gonna be a long day. Long Day. No, I'm, I mean the, the new gigs. Is that the whiskey whiskey? The, the Kamala shit, the whiskey shit. The hair. I'm hearing her songs pop up in more commercials than I've ever heard before. Yes. And voiceovers. Yeah. They signing off on a little more. Yeah. Now than they normally do for Beyonc and made me scratch my head watching TV the other day. Like that's odd. So, I mean you can't pocket watch Beyonc shit.


But she's Leading up to Grammy season. I I see. She, I see what Time It is now. Now Tina Noles did put a post up saying that Beyonc didn't get paid for comma. She said I wanna correct the record. These is all lies. We paid for the glam, we paid for the travel. We didn't get paid a dollar. No, I know. I think that's to protect Kaa. I don't know if it's true or not, but it's interesting that she made a point. I what I want. The as sha was like, is Christmas halftime show gonna be the new thing? Is that gonna be like, is that gonna be the news? Not Super Bowl, but the next level after this? Yes. Having Beyonc. Yes. Do That is after this. Yes. Such a bar. You already Got it on Netflix. Mm. You see what I'm saying? This is a It is a partnership here. So we putting it on Netflix. You know how many we see the numbers Netflix just did for Tyson, Jake Paul fight. This is a tech battle. Really?


Yes. Yeah. That's what It is. It is a Tech battle. Mm. Most of the shit that we see in content all It is is a tech battle. All of it. It's all tech battles. But Beyonc, I Got it. I gotta assume that Jay-Z's hand is all over this. Yeah. It still falls under the NFL entertainment. Yeah. Umbrella of shit Fire them Carters maybe Wayne could do next year. Like that might be a a a a nice second, second tier option. Not that. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great idea. Saint Saints gotta be good enough to play on Christmas for that though. Eh? They They not. I want fight that. Tell some hell nigga yo, I wanna fight him. Ain I'm not the fantasy we to make sure I wasn't playing him. We sports soon.


But Teso Hill is really grinding my gears as a fantasy kamara owner. Oh yeah. Every time this they they yo dog, this nigga just started running for his life. Like he don't see nobody else. What he at three? I don't know. But GSP spin was playing against him. He had 44 points. Woo. 45 points. That's another thing in my league. We addressing that soon. TSO Hill should not be able to start as a tight end in the league if he's playing quarterback. Yeah. Yeah. We not we not in a two quarterback league. Yo. But he's not playing quarterback the whole time though. He Got it 'cause he did have receptions but still. Yeah. So and he is a tight end. If if he's playing quarterback, that's a cheat code.


It's a trick play. It's like, it's like a wildcat when you had a fucking running back lineup as the qb. No. Why I don't fuck with it in my league specifically my money league. Because when Amara St. Brown, they do a trick play and he throws the touchdown. He don't get the quarterback points. Oh that's some bullshit in your league. Yeah. Yeah. Hey bullshit. Hey we discussing that in Mr. Chas in July buddy. Yeah. That's bullshit. The fuck are y'all talking about? If he throws for a touchdown, even if it's a trick play, you threw a touchdown, you should get touchdown points. Yeah. Don't work like that. Will one drive the vagina up top about fantasy football though and shout out to the vagina that plays fantasy football. You're right. We are drying up the pussy out. Yeah, I could hear sandpaper. Scratchy from scratchy menopause.

How, how do you feel as a potter first of all? I don't, I don't feel Anything. Anybody else listen to it? No. It is really dope. I checked out the first episode. I'm gonna continue to check in. It kind of gives hi the first episode gives his like backstory and moving to New York and going to St. John's and all that shit. It's him and Eeb who's his manager. Just discussing all the shit that he kinda went through. How he started rapping, how he was playing ball, how he was coming here and doing the college party life but then decided to do the rapping thing.


I I just really enjoyed it. It was relatable to me as someone who came from a small market, moved to a big city, tried to get it popping it It is great. It's great to me and it's a really dope roll out the way they did. They dropped the album, the the come up right afterwards. Yeah. They come up on dps. Yeah. Shout, shout out to Cole e That's the part that I wanna shout out. Just the rollout came back at it again. Yeah. With another fire idea for fire rollout. Not that he invented a re-release but he knows how to time his shit. He knows It is weird. How and when to use his voice stands that apology I'm off that I'm not that to decide. He he hasn't missed with how and when you hear him and making it effective and impactful.


So shout to Cole, shout out to his manager. Great idea. I'm sure it's encouraging a lot of people to go to the old, your old body of work. Yeah, I did. I did. And I mean I, I like how they harp harp on his brand being relatability and I agree. Oh yeah. Like his story is very relatable to a lot of folks, myself included. And he's knocking out the park with doing an intimate conversation like this that brings it home even more. And I mean from the clips I, I heard It is just true to Cole. Right. Just a really nice guy who has no problem giving credit, telling you where and who, where he got inspired, who inspires him, his journey.


Like he don't have no problem handing the flowers out. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. He bigged you up a lot too. Both him and Eeb E was a big fan. Talked about how you used reaching out to fans and relatability again. He said the same for Kanye too actually it was kind of interesting 'cause he talked about how some of the old Kanye kinda cringey bars he liked because it added character. And I think that was something that I didn't like about Cole early on. It is the cringey bars, but it was intentional. So now it's like okay, I guess that makes sense. Okay. It's just a really interesting looking into his, his thought process, especially early on. I'm curious to see how it develops. Did it make you look at him any different? Well all of that's fire. Hold up for a minute Mark.


Play play the clip of them talking about me. Oh I got you. I got you. Yeah, I was waiting Paul the fuck we talking about me? He started and he went to Kanye tell me that and then Kanye didn't start saying some other shit. There's a clip of him talking about me. I mean, I mean it just seems like the ball's right there s Like midnight or 11 and like that's when you heard all the like bra shit that was like new and until we recorded and we would listen back News your Vibe. And that's what like the first Fab freestyle was with Nori. With Nori was like Respect, I respect Shoot At your feet, make you do the puff there profession. Like it was like that era. And, and and by that point school I was like a huge Joe Button Fan.


Hey, By like by this point we talking about Yes You was on Joe Button Heavy. Yeah. 'cause I, I loved like That's Eve by the way speaking bars. But I also always loved like to be able to connect. That's what Joe Biden was doing right? He was connecting through like a d in a different way than like other rappers. Yeah. And Mood music like Joe to anybody that's like obviously you know if you listen to this and you younger and you not and and you wasn't from that area, you gonna know Joe Butter as like podcast. But what e put me on 'cause I wasn't on Joe Butter like that. Of course I knew him just being a rap fan but I wasn't on his shit heavy. I knew like even his mix tape freestyle shit. But what E put me on too, 'cause E was a big fan, E put me on the moon music, which was like this nigga Joe Butter was like no he was, he was, he was, It was emo rap.


It was rap rapper. It was like the first time rap Really got like, yeah It is better than you saying Parks rap with like real bars facts. He was like, damn, this nigga really going through it. So then it was like Ransom and, and Hitchcock with the athlete, the 18 dude bundles, fan Piece stack Rest in Peace. Paul Kain and Fab. And so like, and I remember and obviously the Pinnacle was like Jay nah. Yep. And then 50 came with like a whole new stack. Nah, you got shit on there. You, you never heard of Joe Buddy. Oh shout out to those guys. Man, I appreciate that. That's love. That made me feel good. That made me smile inside and outside. No for real. That was nice.


All warm and fuzzy. That was nice. That's it. No, no. So Good. I think it's 10, 10 bucks for the, for the podcast and you get all the episodes it's worth it. So now where do, who am I? Who is it? Who are you paying? Who am I paying? It Is, I think it's direct to consumer. Oh That's right. The where do I go? That's crazy. It's, I think Inevitable, which is the name of the podcast live and you go in there you can Apple Pay whatever they got a group chat shit that's going on in there. Wow. That's funny. Brilliant. With a live release. Really, really, really, really good job. And you know, Eve talks about it a lot in the podcast talking about how he kind of comes from a fan perspective and I, I salute to him salute to Cole 'cause he does a lot of shit. He talks about going out and selling CDs and just trying to get your buck back for the cd.


Not trying to, you know, make money off it basically. And It is just, there's a lot of people that wouldn't do that 'cause it doesn't look cool. You know what I'm saying? He was talking about how you go to Times Square and people are handing out CDs and there's a lot of people that wouldn't go out and beat the street like that. Yeah. And it worked for him really well. It really did. Od I still would love to get to the bottom of him and Hove. But I mean we got nine more episodes I think. So he Ain't gonna do that. I saw the list. It stops that far ourselves. Okay. Do y'all put any credence to these rumors about HOV releasing a project? No. There being a song on it. I don't know who it could be dissing, but do y'all y'all give anything to that?


I give credence to the album coming out. I don't give credence to a disc record. I think that's ka the the disc record part. If the album is coming out. Somebody, I mean but subtle dis what I was reading was people saying was like It is gonna come out Drake Hard or somebody, I don't think it's gonna be nothing crazy If the album is coming out and somebody was able to say there's a this song that mean ho let them hear a this song and let them say it. That ain't Yeah that ain't somebody, the nigga don't talk that ain't somebody freestyle. You don't think it's just people leaking bullshit to to draw pictures? No, no, no, no, no. Niggas don't even play with hold name like that. Not at all. Okay. Niggas don't play with hold name like that. So it's either all the way Cap or It is all the way true. Yeah. But I didn't bother to read through the the Redacted to see who the, the disc could be about.


I didn't, that wasn't where my concern was. I think Ho's been working on music as far as the album coming out. I don't know. Yo it's time. It is time. It Is time. I thought you, I thought you had some inside information that whole might have put up. Put another album Ice. Oh they was working on the album. I don't know if it's coming out. That's what I'm saying. Oh Got it. Why wouldn't it come out if he's working on it? Sometimes people just record music. That's what happens in the music business. You work on shit. Yeah. Niggas will record music and then say nevermind I'm not. Yeah I don't feel like it or whatever I was, whatever I was, whatever mindset I was in at the time, I'm not in that anymore. I ain't in that no more. Now it's like I want that or that's dated or it's bringing me back to a dark place. I'm gonna start from scratch. Your artists have just come up with the most wacky reason to not release some shit that was that heat.


But It is time. I need a whole album. I Would love a whole Album. I can't imagine Beyonc getting all the way active the way we talking about and him just continuing to be cool in the background as the, as the executive. I think we'll get a whole verse and And that will be, it's gonna be a lot of talk in the verse. Yeah. Even the talk or the dis Who gets a whole verse today. That's a good one. Shit. I mean kLab always get one. So do he got any projects coming out? Yeah, Whoever signed the hole. It is that too? I don't even know who signed the Hove anymore. Yeah, Fuck around and be on another soundtrack or something.


Yeah. Yo, the last five, six years of music has ruined so many collaborative opportunities. That's what I saying like now I was about to say Drake get a whole verse but I don't even know that. I don't know no More. That's what I was saying. Yeah I dunno He ain't getting no and I don't know if Kendrick does either 'cause he might wanna stay outta that shit. I mean he put him on the Super Bowl I feel like, I feel like he already, he already made his choice Clipse album. Yes. Oh Okay. That's perfect. That's where the whole album, that's where the whole verse is gonna come from. That's what it's, that's where it's gonna come from. Push It can always get a whole. Yep. Always. Yep. There you go. Drug Deals Anonymous is still my shit, man. Yeah. Can't wait. Is that, what do y'all have is the best whole feature? I know that's a tough random question Feature.


Not feature but guest verse with one of our guys Jeezy Push Ross Drake seen it all for me. Could be biased 'cause of my, you know how I feel about Jeezy's records but seen it all. I'm gonna go recency and say God did I like God did. Damn Ain't Oh yeah. Yeah. Amazing version Be fucking Body that shit. Shit. Yeah but I don't have that Better than the fucking Meek shit. The Meek shit. What's free? What's free? I love the Rick Ross shit. Still Teflon Don shit. Yeah Freemason free. Macon free Macon is crazy too. Once I didn't hear the story at all, hearing the story behind how that verse came about, it's like oh that just put it w higher. Yeah. All we dig riding now I want to say I want shout out.


I want shout out. There's no Hove land up here anyway. We love Hove. Oh definitely Noland up here. Yeah, no we play that. I mean we don't got, we ain't got Overtly Dick Ride I I dick ride. I don't even do that ball but I feel like once Ho just know how you feel about him. You ain't got a dick Ride no more. Like hey nigga, you the greatest, we known Ho Vengeance anyway so I just, I just saw a clip. I don't know if it was new or not. I don't know if y'all talked about this when ASAP Rocky said that Ho pressed them 'cause he said something about ACEs spade or or something like that and he had pressed some of the ASAP mobs and I just thought it was interesting like HOV still got his hands in the streets man. No matter what You know what I mean.


And I heard Cam say something about hov, how Hov texting like it's just ho It is just ho I think it's It is funny. You, you could take Brooklyn out of, you could take a nigga outta Brooklyn but you can't take the Brooklyn outta the nigga man. And I just thought those was an interesting stories that I heard over this over this weekend while we on some of this. I wanna say I do love the way that Pharrell handled the, the, the chain, the jewelry shit. The Drake jewelry shit. Yeah. Okay. Another just classy guy. Yeah, they asked him about it. He said he's a fan of the history. Right. The end. Nothing else to get there. Also, I wanna say Shaq, you my man, we just spoke to DM the other day, but Dwight Howard call you out to fight and there's millions to be made didn didn't like that response.


What was his response? I didn't like Shaq's response. You gotta win more than one ring. You ain't, I only fight champions. Ah, I'll stick with Gronk. A real champion also. My money's on Dwight in that fight. Why he listened to Shaq. But it's fine. Yeah, no, no I don't, I I think Dwight is in better shape. I think Dwight actually boxes and he's got a lot more, a little more training. A lot more training. Well he's, I can't say that. Yeah, Dwight probably tussled with more dudes. Yeah, I was about to say. It's more of a though, he why we doing Tosses? I thought we was nigga.


Get them behind. Why Clutch? Stay in front of me. What the fuck? Y'all need to go to jail. Y'all need to be arrested. But. yeah. Shout to Dwight. Shout to Shaq. Shout to both of them. Word. Shout to man. What else? What else we got had a question for you? Oh, what you got? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mark. Oh no I was about to go, I was going somewhere. You talked said jail made me think of Diddy. That was all 'cause Diddy's going through it this week. Oh, Yeah man. Diddy is he really going through It is well sounding like he's doing alright. Right. Two, two things are happening at the same time, right? Yes. Early in the week. They're like, Diddy's running the jail. This dude's fighting over and vying to to make his bed. Yes. And then he, he's just like running This shit. Like, like, like Luc some empire got on his phones. It is getting his own food. Right?


Yeah. But then the, the Bureau of Prisons announced last night that after doing a raid of all the prisons, they found a notepad in Diddy's cell. They found evidence that he's calling and tampering with witnesses and they're threatening at the time that we're talking right now to, to bring new charges against him for witness tampering and that that's gonna undermine his, his bail hearing. His bond hearing, which is Friday. And he may not be able to get out 'cause they're worried that he's threatened. So it's like he's running the prison, but they kind of like, yeah, that's why you can't leave. I think that's, I think that's all done intentionally. That's a ack of shit. Yeah. That's all done intentionally. Mark. I mean like, first of all, they said that by them doing that they violated his fourth, fifth and sixth amendment that they were saying that they took some personal information, like notes to his lawyers.


They took it, they took pictures of it. Confide notes. Yeah. Privilege. You know, and I think that they just trying to, I think it's just, just trying to make it as hard, hard on him as possible. And that's it. That's why, that's how I feel like they're trying to, they're playing a dirty game. They're playing a dirty game and, and, and rightfully so. you know what I mean? Yeah. It's, you know, It is eat or be eating, but I just feel like they're playing Diddy with all that shit. Yeah. Him, I'm ignoring all that shit. I requested to be a bond twice. Yeah. Y'all told me to get the fuck outta here. Exactly. You put 50 million on the table. Don't try to wave it over my head now to get me to get niggas to stop making my bed and writing notes in here. No. Right. I I I think Diddy's done alleged to have done some monstrous shit. Yes.


And I want him to be held accountable for it, but he also deserves a due process and a fair trial. And the state is not giving him a fair trial, fair opportunity. Right, right now. Not at all for all the reasons y'all just said. Yeah, not at all. Yeah. But, and the bond shit is tough though because if he is tampering witnesses, if he is calling people, what do you do? Do you let him out? But that's the reason why he was not given bail is because they feared that he, that he was going to tamper with witnesses. Right. So They tracked one of them to, sorry, the the other, I forget her name, that was in Dirty Money, the one that came out and made the post. And they were saying that like they have proof that He, they were in communication. They were communication right before she made that statement. Yes. So, yeah. And it don't help to shine. It's, it's ugly.


I was gonna say it don't help. That shine's been on tour too, you know, promoting The Documentary promoting documentary, which I saw, I know y'all talked about it in in the Patreon. The Patreon last week. But it doesn't help 'cause it just draw more attention to this idea that Diddy don't play fair and that Diddy tamper as a Diddy undermines the law. So it's a bad week for Diddy on the street. Even if it's a good week for him in jail. Yo, listen, sometimes you need to reach out to motherfuckers to to, to recant some shit or to fix the story or to, to look at it from a different perspective. I'm sorry. Sometimes, yo, did you really feel this way? I didn't mean it this way. How can we figure it out? It sounds crazy. I know the law doesn't like it, but sometimes a conversation needs to happen.


Yeah. Sometimes the conversation needs to happen. It's It is the law doesn't allow that. You're not allowed to reach out to somebody that that filed a, that's a part of a lawsuit not allowed. That's, that's where it's tricky. Like it's a, it's a law. Yeah. Rose wrote it already, but all you niggas, all you niggas, like everybody change. Ah, I hate that shit because a lot of times people have called police on us. A lot of times it's been restraining orders. It is different things in life. Not, not remove people just talking about in life. And you reach out to have a conversation. Yo, yo what's, what's up with that? And and a lot of times it's rectified true. But the not saying what Diddy did, I'm not making an excuse for that, but I'm just saying like that's the norm to reach out to somebody to get an understanding.


I understand what you're saying. The part of That is when they found out that you did that. Yeah, true. Yeah. You go to jail. Yeah. Because It is still just because people do that don't make it legal. Make it Right. Yeah. So, but now they found out. I'm just, I'm just addressing the people that's looking it as what he's doing. Oh my God. It is he, he's trying to coerce the witness in Tampa. I'm just like, come on, stop. Hey, they'll throw, they throw these words on it. Yeah. That, that, that that's the only, that's, that's who I'm addressing. Not the law. If you get caught doing that, nigga, you have to, you have to Yeah. Face the consequences if you get caught doing that. Yeah. And raiding the cell and finding new a notepad is making people and people. The thing is, people are gonna believe whatever they hear about Denny at this point. 'cause there's so much shit being said. Just at the end of the day, does this actually help him? Like if, if we hear so much awful shit about him every day for months and months and months, by the time trial comes in, may are people, are people gonna be like immune to it where they don't even care anymore?


I think so. It might, it might work. It's a certain level of desensitization taking place. Like, because It's happening for sure. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, every single day it's something new and some of it, some of it just honestly sounds preposterous. But does it work in, into his favor? Meaning that like there's so much press and stuff about it. So if, if he gets found guilty Appeals process. Yeah. Yes. Right. Like, yo, these people heard about it. They were smearing my name, they were taking my, you know, my evidence or whatever he has. And it was plastered all over the world. And these people who are on the jury could have potentially been influenced to find me guilty. It's possible. Yeah. That's r Kelly take, I think that's the game they playing.


Yeah. That's literally what they're trying to do. They're gonna tank the jury pool as best they could. I couldn't be impartial. I couldn't be on a Diddy jury right now. Yeah, yeah. I mean it's hard for me to imagine him not having done shit. No, I understand. Yes. You know, but, but is that, but is That is that fair? It is not. That's what I'm saying. I don't know if he'd get a fair trial and I think he did a lot of This shit. Yes. I, I agree. But I, he still deserves a fair trial. I don't know anywhere in America where he could get 12 people that, I mean no, Diddy has be like, talk about it all. It is, It is like, his name is a metaphor for freaky shit. Yeah. The flip side to that coin. Let hear what's the flip side Joe? The same way that you said you wouldn't be able to be impartial because the pool has maintained, there's people that are on the other side, which is why he is getting his bed made in facts, jail facts.


Wherever he is, he is still who he is. This won't be like Tory Lane sitting there silent and his dad doing some shit when the court is over, puff is gonna fight. Yeah. Puff gonna fight and he gonna be heard. He got research and he's charming with resources and he got a lot of people, motherfuckers at level as well. He got connections all over this place. Like, so the same way that there's that side, It is the other side too. I didn't wanna be the one to say it, but the other side trying to throw mes the other question I get a lot. That's the other side though. Because, because Puff is puff in terms of power, respect, all of that. It's a lot of people that's going go to bat and hope that he, it worked out out.


He rewards them after the fact. Yeah. Or because same as I don don't want my name to come up in This shit with you. So let's try to get you outta this. Yeah. And I mean, what I will, what I will say, and then I then I'm off of this 'cause there's a trial, there's a, there's a trial. Yeah, I understand. To be had For sure, for sure. But some of them documents that were framing his children taking on his Instagram to kind of repaint his image and they were talking about that, like that was a bad thing. I thought that was genius. Yeah, I agree. I thought that was absolutely genius. Every day there's a new story making me out to be some type of monster demon pervert pedophile. So let's get the other side. So yeah, let me, let me try to fight in any way I can.


If y'all gonna fight that way with trying to taint my name again. We are not saying that we puff didn't do no fucked up shit. I just wanna be clear, we're not p apologists or nothing like that. Exactly. No, but in all fairness, if y'all, if y'all are gonna be out here in the, in the media or whatever the case may be, making me seem like the worst person possible, let me have some people that love me try to make me seem like a decent person. He deserves that. See, 'cause what what we have a history in recent years of is seeing the media be more prepared or them being the state or the feds being more prepared in the media than they are in the court. Exactly, yes. So yeah. Shit we just saw with young thugs trial Young Thug. I know, that's what I'm saying.


So have your your your t's your t's crossed and your i's dotted. 'cause I don't that shit even we gonna see in dirt trial anytime they show me the a picture of Drew, I'm like, oh, got up, got one on your hands. Gotta wait for the trial. Yeah. I just seen somebody say on a don on a meme somewhere that the, the, the your, your representation is much more important than the crime. That's a fact fam. That's a fact. Shout shout Druke. He, he had got one of his funnier skits is, yo, if you see your lawyer dressed like this, you're going to jail. Like nigga, your representation can be the difference between you going home and you going.


True. True. Yeah. I'm so glad I obey the lord man. You ain't lying. You every day I say it. Speaking of jail, NBA young boy as well, You know what I mean. 27 months, right? Yeah. 27 months. Yes. Yes. And what four or five years probation or something like that. 60 months probation. Five years a win. Fa huge It is they just got him on the carrying a firearm by a felon. The other charges were, were dismissed out. What was he looking at time wise? Was it like 10 years or something? I don't you looking for a pen pal again? No, they tried to, they tried to make it seem like when he was sending people in the store to get the drugs, like he had some type of operation going on, but it wasn't, obviously he was using the drugs for himself.


You know what I mean and, and, and to whatever. I mean, being in Utah, like I can't see how that nigga could just be there for so long on house arrest. Like what that does to him mentally. I thought about that, you know, 'cause JR was showing me the areas that he, from where he live and I, you know, not saying, I think it was a great thing that they suggested that he move to Utah because of, to prevent him from getting in trouble. But like being there, like sometimes you need company, you need to go outside. No matter how big your house is, man, you can get trapped in this and they can play with your mind and you start thinking things and seeing things and sometimes you gotta take the drugs to, to heal your pain. You know what I mean. Being in that place without being able to touch somebody, your family or waking up to your loved ones.


Not saying that people didn't go out there, visit him, but you're like trapped a lot of, and I think that it's, it's It is meant for you to fuck up these situations. A lot of them artists, your your, your NBA young boy, your Dirks, a lot of those who've experienced a lot of loss. Talk about that. Like, yo, I need the drugs just to numb me. Yeah. Because I'm dealing with so much. Like I've, I've, I've lost family members and close homies and, and It is just l after L after L after L that, yeah. I, I don't wanna feel that no more. And in closing for me, I think people missed it. I think people don't look at that. No. They, if we, if we sit here and say this, they gonna be like, oh, what about all the stuff he's doing outside? But we not looking at the human side, right? We are not looking at the environment that these young boys come from.


I think it only works for when we are speaking about ourselves, right? Like if we, if I'm in trouble, I'm gonna say out the environment and all the stuff I've been through, I'm making an excuse and then I'm not looking at the next man. I think we forget how to be human sometimes. So they, they may say, yo, you, you're taking up for young, young boy all the shit he did. You're taken up for Dirk. But not understanding or looking at the stuff that they went through. And not saying they not, they aren't responsible for the decisions that they made. But I, I still try to look at from being in that position before or a little bit in that position. I started look at it from a different perspective and just give another point of view. A a lot of people don't look at it that way 'cause they just can't relate Got it. Right. They never grew up in none of that. So it's like to even their mind can't imagine dealing with some of the shit that these young artists are dealing with.


That's it. Yeah. But. yeah. I had a question for you too, Joe. What's up? Give it to me. So I was listening, I remember when you had the last pod you was talking about Julia White remember and how you felt and, and I agreed with you. I'm like, damn man, my man, my man Joe. But then I heard other people doing interviews with him and they were kind of on his side like, yo, we heard what, you know, the pitch that you wanted to do. We understand where you coming from and you know, his reasoning for like just being a child and it was him against the adults. Like none of the kids on the cast had any issues with him and that he's the reason for a lot. Like he, it, it made me look at it from a different perspective. 'cause you had me when you was talking about it like, yo, you not thinking about, it's very selfish.


And I just wanted to know like, do you still stand on how you felt like him thinking about himself or a double and tripled down on Got? it every last thing I said about Julio White, the way that I discern does not have to be the way that anyone else does. Got I again, I saw the Family Matters doc. I heard what he had to say about his Netflix pitch and then I saw him on The Breakfast Club Breakfast Club. Yes. Say this about Judy and why she disappeared. Brought It book. What happened to Judy? Man? How'd Judy just walked upstairs? I'm talking about it in book. I know, I know. See you trying to sell books. I'm called and I'm crazy. But I do believe he's a piece of shit.


How do you think I covered it in the book? Was I fair? I guess. 'cause she didn't really have a role, So I don't even really want to hear this dude's voice. Honestly. I'm just gonna read it. 'cause he's that annoying to me now. And I, and I think that's fucked up. I don't feel like I deserve that. Like one of my childhood heroes. Yeah. Like I hate to see these niggas grow up and just reveal who they really are. Yeah. God damn. During a recent interview in a breakfast club, jilil was asked about the character Judy Winslow, who famously went upstairs in one episode and never came back down. He shared, and my position is all of these years later, you don't have to share this this way, you don't have to speak about her or her family this way.


Hmm. They, the writers and producers weren't giving her storylines. She, Jamie Foxworth wasn't the best at delivering jokes. Sometimes they would give her material and it would just fall flat. If you fall flat and run throughs, they're going to rewrite you. You can only mess up so much. He added that he blames the whole ordeal on Jamie Foxworth, it's mother, the mother of the actress who played Judy and explained that the higher ups didn't feel like they needed the character. This nigga is a dick. I don't, I don't, I, me, me, I don't need to see or hear anymore. Got it. I agree this nigga, like, you don't have to do that all of these years later to sell a book. And back to my original point, if you was that nigga, 'cause we ain't seen you be that nigga since this show.


But if you was really that nigga, you wouldn't have to go about these measures to sell your book on it. It would just be I'm Julio White. Okay. Hold on though. I'm doing a press run for my book. Cool. They asked you the question of, Hey, what happened to you? It's a great question. If you watch Family Matters, right? Right. If you weren't a fan, that's an amazing question. Correct. So they ask him the question of Yo dog you was there. We don't know for those who didn't read your book Yeah. What happened? How you answer that without, he's telling the yo listen, he gave her lines. It ain't work out her mom. So they wrote her off. But during the interview he also cracked the joke about like, it's easier answer.


He was saying us as children was making fun of her. Like he used like a layup line. I I listened to the interview this morning. He said, I was just going off of that quote. She missed the layup. I think there's a better way to answer this. I think there's a better, so, so if you're, if you're asking that question, how you answering it? I'm here working now. I ain't thinking about no of that shit. But there is a better way to answer that. Tom Brady. Don't answer it like that. The rock don't answer it like that. Peyton Manning don't answer it like that. Nobody that answers just questions the right way on that. My, I have a publicist team that cost me 300 and $400,000 quarterly is answering that like that. I was just getting ready to say you, you're mentioning people who have entire teams. Yeah. For that reason. He, he sound like just off of that a person that's ignorant and not media trained.


So they asked him the question and I answered the question. But you almost No, he, no, he's got no, he's got definitely has media training. He has media Training. A thousand percent. He spent too much time on like a top rated show and he had the team when I was a kid. He, I'm 35 years of media. Yeah, but I mean like how old was he When he and how many times does he sit when the show Shut Down? How many times is he sitting down? You think he needs, does it Really require a media team to tell you not to be a dick Diplomatic? If you're a, if you are a dick. Yeah. He's given a million interviews. Yes. He knows this was Just, he could, he could, he could, he could have been. I I agree. I understand what you guys are saying. He could have been a shit. He don't have to shit on every cast member every chance he gets, which is all I keep hearing and seeing him do.


And that's why they don't fuck with him and that's why they ain't fucking with em. And he might not fuck with them. Joe, I've seen you shit on people you worked with before. 'cause you don't fuck with em. He don't fuck with them. You've also, so you are asking me about these people that I don't fuck with. Yeah. I'm gonna tell you this from a perspective of I don't fuck with them all right. But on the flip side, there's also people I don't fuck with where you don't hear me say a word or ever bring 'em up. True. Or I'll say something kind and be thinking something totally different. True. I've seen So all that, so all That is in my bag. Show me that it's in yours. Yeah. The i i it's that All of these, it's all of these years. I don't, I ain't mad if you got a list of people that it's up with forever, but at some point show the other side of, Hey, I'm gonna answer this PC and not give you anything and not shit on them or their mother.


Right. It it's a fact what you Talk about. That's true. I'm a shit. Hey It is a million niggas I beef with you. right. I don't ever bring their moms What are We talk? No, I'm not saying like, come on, come on, come here. Don't put me, don't put me in the mix with him. I'm just saying I'm a I'm, I'm a dick, but I know how to be nice and I'm me. I Got it popping long after Pump it up. If he had something after family matters, like I said, I maybe view some of the arrogance differently, but nigga what have you Done? I feel like the the purpose of him speaking like that being intentionally salacious is for the sales of his book. You know? So he's, That's what he's here for. Yeah. That's whack. Yeah, Because your, because if your book was lit like that, the publishing house would send it to the people that, that are supposed to have it.


They would read it. They're gonna send out the little one sheet with all the juicy ation shit. And that's how everybody's gonna get it. We don't need to hear you be rude to somebody. Right. Somebody in they arm. If he ain't had a book, he probably wouldn't be sitting up there in the first place's. True Fuck. that particular moment. How about that? If I'm here to sell a book, fuck him in that book I stand with Joe But. yeah. I don't need to hear none of that shit. This nigga RK was 4 30, 40 years ago, nigga. I ain't gotta fucking still be No hell no. Fuck him. So did that answer you? Yeah, it did. It did. All right. Mark, question for you man. Did I see a lot of other celebrities do it? You, you and I see you post your blue sky. You leaving Twitter too? No, I'm not leaving Twitter. I got too many followers, but I am going to transition picture so I got too many followers.


Yeah. I keep it way to go doc. I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I that, that's, that's my way to get stuff out. That's my way to get information out. That's my way to talk to people. It's my way to promote stuff. But I'm gonna trans, I'm transitioning to Blue Sky and I'm gonna add that. And if Blue Sky can get to my Twitter or close to it, then I will leave Twitter. I was gonna say, 'cause you started Twitter with no followers. Yeah, but it was 2009. Scott put some time in. Work it out. That's what I'm gonna do. But until then, but I'm not, I'm not one of the people that's gonna leave. I'm also not gonna do the dramatic exit letter. You know, people writing like a full letters and public about why they're leaving in the history. I ain't doing all that shit. We write a couple, but why not? 'cause if and why and why aren't you prepared to leave Twitter? Is it only the follow account? It it's a, it's a practical thing. Yeah. It's, it's, it's how I get information.


That's how I communicate with my audience right now. It is a big part of it. And so I don't wanna lose that. I I can't afford to lose that right now. Like there are people who are huge in, like, Gabrielle Union is, is huge. She's a superstar. She can leave Twitter and just, just maybe over Instagram or come to Blue Sky and she'll have a million followers in, in a month. I won't. So it's, it's a different thing. It's a different process for me. Do you believe that all your followers are viewing and hearing your everything you post? No. No, but I, I think that I have a, a bigger dent in that space than any other space that I use. Are you not concerned about, and this is why I'm in support of the celebrities making these over the top announcements about it. Are you not in support of the new terms and conditions and, and all of the means?


Have you read that? Yeah, I'm, I'm critical of it. I disagree with it. And moving the courts to Texas and making it impossible to really have free speech. I'm I and lemme read it just so people are in the know. X is new terms and conditions drop November 15th. We're past that with 60 pages. Legal jargon, small print and a popup prompt to accept via hyperlink. It feels like they're betting. They're betting. Most of us won't read them. Let's break down of course what you're agreeing to. Broad content license. That's always the trick that one, by posting on X, you grant them a royalty free worldwide license to use reproduce and adapt your content. This includes training ai, mo AI models and sharing with partners all without paying you your content equals their asset limited liability if something goes wrong, data breach, account suspension, et cetera.


All the things that you know they do X limits their liability to $100 or what you paid them in the last six months. Most users That is $0, meanwhile your loss is unlimited account termination. X can suspend or terminate your account for reasons like commercial in viability or prolong inactivity. Translation. If you're not making the money or active enough, your account could be gone without notice. Five no class actions allowed. You waive the right to join class action suits. If X messes up, you'll have to take them on individually, which most people cannot afford to do. This Shields X from collective legal accountability. Six data use your data can be collected, shared, and used globally.


While this isn't new, the breadth of their rights to analyze, adapt, and share your info has grown. And yes, this includes feeding AI systems seven changes without consent. X reserves the right to change these terms at any time with minimal notice. If you continue using the platform, you are deemed to have accepted the changes whether or whether or not you read them eight. Time to sue. If you have a legal dispute, you only have one year to foul a claim. This is shorter than many jurisdictions allow and could prevent valid claims from being pursued. Nine tiny font long read 60 pages and a small font, likely eight to 10 points. It would take the average user two to three hours to read and understand these terms if they have legal expertise.


Jesus, it goes on and on. There's 10, 11, 12. Here's mad points here, but I get what some of that should have been scary enough and plenty reason for people to leave. Oh, I think people who are leaving are right to leave. And I think the celebrities who have the, who have the platforms should write those long letters. I'm just saying I'm not the one to do that one. Ain't nobody following me off Twitter. They'll follow Don Lemon off, they'll follow Gabrielle Union off. They'll follow the big actors and actresses off Do it for me also, I don't create content on t on on Twitter. All I do is post links to like my YouTube channel, things like that where I'm just trying to get information out fast or make a a statement. So for me it doesn't make sense, but I respect people leaving. I just hope when it gets dry and in Blue Sky Streets, they not back on Twitter no more, which is what I think is going happen.


They'll be, that's what's going Yeah, that's what I think they've done it. That's what Threads was. What threads? Do you have a news? Do you have a newsletter? No, no. My my thing is, should get one. You should do one. That's a good idea. My thing is the people saying that, oh you know, they're doing this with our data, they're doing this with Twitter is doing this with their new terms and conditions. Hey Meta was doing the same shit. All of 'em are doing all do. All of them are doing the same thing. So you It is just as Donald Trump, you know, you don't like it here. That's what It is. That's what It is. Well say that though. That's about, yo listen, say that yo don't, don't use the terms and cons conditions argument when everybody's doing the same shit with the terms and conditions.


Yo, everybody like, and we, we've been being this the Dead Horse man. Like especially me, Selma, how much people are just taking the shit that's going on with Donald Trump. You know? Wait, let me just reply to that. I'm sorry I'm with that. But I'll say for me those terms and conditions keep me off of these social places. True. I'm on X but I'm not doing anything on X. But talking on spaces and even That is very limited. I don't do TikTok, I don't do Snapchat. I don't do fuck. I'm not going to Blue Sky and all of these. I'm not going 'cause everybody rules is wy. Right. But I also have a subscription business. Right. So I maybe don't feel the need to. I think that if you had a newsletter where all of the hillmans you could speak to whenever you wanted and they were solely there. Like some substack shit.


Yeah, yeah. Then, then fuck Twitter. I think I might just do that. You should. Yeah, you should. Go ahead. Flip. No, I'm just saying that they, people just taking the Trump shit and Elon Musk shit a little bit too hard and you know, they're making these decisions. I guess not just to benefit themselves. You know what I mean. Not to benefit themselves, but I guess to, to feel, to make themselves feel comfortable for the next four years. You know, people feel like they have some control. Right. Control. I did something about it. Listen, my my mother, I just talked to my mom, man, she's crashing out and then she's talking about her job and shit. Like I'm on the phone with her driving in fucking Colorado. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like, it's all right. You know what I mean. Like you're not the majority. You actually the the minority. You don't, you're not gonna suffer like others will.


And unless you, I understand your humanitarian, your humanitarian standpoint from it, but you're taking this a little bit too hard. And I, I spoke to my brother and I had to call her and tell her that. And she stand on her point. She just feel like everything's happening at one time. And I, it, it makes me feel bad, especially nigga, well you got sons that love you You know what I mean. Like is it that deep? Like we'll be all right, you know? But what, how can I, I can't tell her that's still my mother. She gonna do whatever she wants to do. But I'm just watching this in real time affect people. You know, like It is like, what the fuck is going on? You know, like what is going on? And, and can we just focus on ourselves and being a family and making sure that we don't succumb to any laws or whatever that's put in place.


You know what I mean if we can. So that's me. Should been a crazy weekend bro. It sounds like it. Yeah. I hope here's to this week being better. To what? Here's to this week being better for all. Yeah. For all of us. Yeah. I love you guys. Gotta be, we go I love you guys, man. Play you back buddy. You live across the street from a Target with that tv. She It is not even out.

Slow death nigga. Slow it down so I can really, really enjoy this one. This Bruce Lee walking to slow motion. Hey Oh Shit. So before I get to that, so the last dragon is on Netflix. I've seen the last Dragon 20 million times. Please don't tell me they changed something, but yo please, why not? I like to, Hey, sometimes I wish that I could live twice. Not to change shit, just but whatever the line is But yeah. Experience a couple things twice. So I click it to see how I feel as an adult. Has anyone seen the Last Dragon as a full grown adult? No. I've only seen it as an adult. I, I saw a little bit of it and I was like, It, is it 4K? Right. No, it's terrible.


That's not what I'm talking about. No, it's still as staticky as it was. No, it's not. The last drag It is not, the one I saw is not in 4K, it's on whatever eighties pixel that was the last dragon as an adult is comedy of the years. The funniest thing ever. And there's a few parts that I forgot, I forgot that he seen Uff early in the movie and was just pussy ran out the deal. Hey, the dude at the top wanted to come fight. Show enough. Ah, get outta here nigga. Bow fucking Showing up. I I, I didn't realize how Wu-Tang inspired the last Dragon was like, I didn't realize how everybody, how this was like a Warriors thing.


Everybody was just a Marshall Arts. Everybody was kung fu fighting. Yeah, yeah. But Bruce Leroy is such a pussy. And then the little white Baldheaded boss dude that was like, this whole movie is sick. It is sick as an adult. So yeah, check, check, check it out. I'll watch it. I watch, just watch 15 minutes, just watch 20 minutes. I never was classic. I never saw it before until I was like in my thirties. Maybe not was like late twenties. I was the last nigga on earth to watch The Last Dragon. So when I watched it, I was like, why the fuck does everybody like this movie? The acting is terrible. The script is terrible. Like This shit. When the movie came out, it was one of the best movies ever. Yeah. When Yes, that's what I was expecting. This shit was the worst thing I've ever seen. This is worse.


What was his name on movie? The name of the movie? Teac. Teac. Yeah. Teac. Yeah. Listen. But a lot because he was like a sex symbol. That's why. Well, and Vanity. And Vanity. Yeah, exactly. Real quick, more. A lot of a lot of movies change. This nigga don't like Scarfaces and shit like that. No, that's not me. That's part. That's scarf. Oh yeah. Sorry. Sorry. You don't like Scarfaces?

It's okay. That shit had an impact park. So a lot of people from that white nigga wasn't Cuban.


We didn't, that's number one. That's appropriation. That's number one. We right. Number two. Anytime I watch Casino, it's great. Yes. And I've seen it 500 times. Facts, I'm putting Scarface at the level of the boot. Goodfellas, the god the Godfather add all shit usual suspects. I just, just don't hold Scarface in the league of its heat. Not even close. Donny Brasco, any of them. So would you consider Scarface like a a a a Hood classic? Scarface is the first a minority classic. Yes. It is It is a hood classic. So Hood Classic It is one of minorities. It shock us all. Classic. But they're not good. Some of them are, I'm still holding to on the state property. But one and two, one affiliate shit.

Let's just go to Africa. Like they didn't even show a picture of Africa. It was just a darkness. Yo yo yo Africa's far. Africa's far right. Fucking get This. shit. That's fucked up. And then as an adult we learned that it ain't right. It ain't ain't really that far. It is really not. Yeah, that movie was terrible. All the actors, everything about Belly was terrible. The intro except for the intro. That's it. Except for the intro and soundtrack and Terrell Hicks and that blue. Well that too under that blue light. That's fair. Niggas wanted to pop Tar Hicks for a long time under that blue light.

Hey, let's go. Hey, why Not? Why not Down the street? So we have a little tradition we do up here at the JBP. Nothing. I'm just singing. We have a little tradition we do up here at the JBP. When a podcast ends, it ends. Things cancel, no longer publishes content. We play this little jam right here. And another one that, Alright, ISO on Who Heads for Joe?


Tales for Mel Tail. Heads for Joe. Tales for Mel. Well I Think we have an expert in the female dominated podcast space. And we don't have, and we don't have a coin. We don't need one. Okay. It's tales. We don't need one. It's tales. Now Mel is a girl's girl, so she may not wanna partake in any of this, but just for suspense purposes, I'm gonna throw the ball her way. Watch her throw it out bounds. Mel, do you have anything to say about failed podcasters? Oh God. Who've been shooting at you for years? And when I say failed, I'm being facetious.


Yeah, I was. I'm being facetious. Yeah. Yeah. The Horrible Decisions podcast has come to an end. They announced, and I don't want to say that they announced it 'cause they said this chapter. Yeah, They've got a, they got a message. It says we have some bitter. Well you Got it queued right up fat. She read that all morning. Oh. Shit. That's the fastest she's ever had. Something queued up. I wanna say big man, I am not on that big man. Failed podcaster. Big man. So Look, that's Mel Shade. I'm not on that list. We have some bittersweet news to share with all of you. Oh, we have decided to end this chapter of Horrible Decisions. We wanna take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for joining us on this incredible journey.


Your support has meant the world to us. Next week will be the final Es episode. Thank you for being a part of our story. Eight years. They did it. They Did it. That's, that was a great ride. Gotta clap it up. We can't be all the way haters sometimes. You gotta show a little bit of love. Shout out to eight years is a long time. Very innovative pod in the space. Some would say that they created the lane that would later be stolen by the hawk to a girl and to call her daddy crew. So hats off to, to both Mandy and Weezy for such a long run. Successful tours. Not, not, not many podcasts emulate that or, or have such a run.


They've done tours. They fucking engraved, engraved themselves in the hearts of their fans. So they do have a disappointed fan base out there. So we want to acknowledge that because I think that did hit the black pod world, I want to say by surprise. But to some people maybe not because you bitch has been hating each other for the last six years. I to shock y'all lasting the last, the final end of that run. But even that's to be commended, right? Like going to work not really getting along the greatest with your co-host and still getting the job done. Because the show must go on the show professionalism at all. By all costs. Exactly. Yeah. So I do want to tip my hat to to, to those women anxious to see what they have in store.


What each one of, no, I'm not, I'm lying. I don don't care what either one of them do. I don't care what either one of them do from this point on. But hats off. Hats off and salute. So I, I'm new to this. I know I do a little bit of Googling and stuff, so I know there was some tension. Where are you with them in the sense of like, are you at a stage where I just don't fuck with them? Or are you at a stage where like I'm happy when things go bad for them and now I don't think them thing they people I don't fuck with. I indifferent. Not the same thing. You could be indifferent. Listen, if I'm talking shit on a pod, It is probably performative. Like, I don't know either one of them well enough to carry on a grudge and all of that shit.


Like this is solely a business performative type of thing. And just because people don't necessarily rock with me don't mean that it's vice versa. How about you? I'm gonna celebrate any, anytime any pod ends it. It's not just It is not just about about everybody to fail but me. Yeah. I'm mad at that. That wasn't a criticism too. The first, the first shall be last and and the last should be first just said it. But. Yeah. I don't have any ill will toward either one of them. I see Mandy saying that Stay tuned. She has great things on the horizon. And I love when people lie like that. Like there's nothing great on the horizon. That's cra Why would you say that?


Wow. It's 'cause it's true. You don't know this. I do. I know. I'm telling you, you gave the studio to Avon. Avon's running the studio now, but it still hurts. Right? Moved Atlanta in New York's expensive. I don't know. I'm not in nobody's business. See the thing is, and It is the fight there now. This one ends, there's an ongoing joke online. At any time, Mandy co-hosts getting a happy relationship. She ends the podcast. So I'm just enjoying the jokes. I'm enjoying the fodder and I'm enjoying seeing podcasters have to stop for whatever reason. Because there's always 20 gabillion reasons to stop. And sometimes you just gotta keep going. How, how you feel Mel, this nigga, this nigga's nasty son.


No. How you feel about it? I see. I'm seeing very expressive Gesticulations. Gesticulations. That's What, don't, don't use that shit. He's married. Fuck you I. gotta catch them. Educating, educated, flirting. Don't use that word. Big words. GEs Landed. Y'all stupid. Man. That's close to the Yeah, we so immature children. The stipulation was close to the Yeah. What you gonna say? Yeah, sorry. Anyways. I mean I'm a little indifferent. A little indifferent. Can we, Can we play it back down? Okay. Okay. Okay.


I would like to know the t I'm not gonna lie. I'd like to know the t as to how they finally came to this. You know, this decision because he's right. The rumor is that they haven't been able to get along with each other for a very long time. Hmm. So, and just to continuously show up, that's commendable. But I don't really like the T. And to be fair, they both have out outside businesses and ventures. Yeah. They're Gonna be fine. It's true. Has three studios. Yo Man, you a legend man. Like, yo, well you don't wanna shoot nobody. This is What's called diplomacy. Teach 'em. Teach what? Teach Big man. I don I I didn graduate. I don't diploma nigga. I, I didn't graduate so I, I don't know what a diploma feels like.


So, but what I'm saying is that the way you just get around shit is just, I'm just watching you man. Like Michael Jackson will be proud you Moon walked your way right outta that shit and big them up. Yeah. Oh, lot of studio. When and when she's shooting at you, nigga. She's not holding back. We. talk about Terminator. We talking about that. I don't know the story. I don't know. It is, It is, it's not They. Oh, it's, it's one person. I You say just Mandy, why does, man, I don't know Mandy. So why, why neither do I. Oh, so it's not like a friendship that fell out? No. No. Oh, okay. Okay. You think it, you think it's just hate man, just function. I, I Guess I mean it's, it's just speculative Mandy masks man. You're not gonna use a student. And I'm critiquing one of the pods that I listened to. Ah, yeah.


The concerned Fan approach in 2010 when I didn't have a pod, but okay. It goes all the way back there. Oh wow. Okay. I understand. Now let me not be immature for two seconds and when I say two seconds, that's all. I mean, a quick, just two seconds. If I were either one of them, I'd have to, we would fight over this. Hmm. We would fight over this. It's not gonna be as simple as we're ending this brand and that's that. It's so, it was so successful. No sir. I would do the Alex Cooper and kick my co-host to the side and rebrand this thing.


Well maybe that could be what the next chapter is. Yeah. The next chapter is, oh, then I'm not allowing my cohost to include that if I'm in the announcement, if I'm not included. But why they could, you ain't gonna get one. Maybe one wants to leave. Yeah. And and maybe one is like you said they got, I don't know. But they could have other shit going. Well then this could be time consuming. This could be, all right, you know what, I don't really wanna do this no more. I wanna go over here. That's cool. But then you go ahead, I'm gonna take the brand and do this. This is back to the me and initial argument from the last part. Then I'm questioning the value of whatever we there is to fight over or not fight over. If one of y'all just going to easily walk away from it. Either you are really, really noble or wasn't much value here. Right. Or it ain't worth it no more. Yeah. Some people could be like, yo, I'm done with This shit.


I like again, y'all said they haven't been fucking with each other for years, however long that could be. 'cause I don't want us to be circular again here. One could be done with it and leave. If half of It is mine, then there's a fight to be had. What's the fight if, if, if y'all both came up to with a, with to the, with the decision. Yeah. Call, call your lawyer. I'll call mine. But there's, there's our, there are conversations to be been could and this could be the end of this Could be where we got to. Yeah. Cool. Let's dissolve This shit. They could be end of that time. Will town, is one person significantly more talented than the other? I, I couldn't say because I mean, some part might walk away like, look, this is a thing, but it's only a thing 'cause of me so I can walk.


They're they're both good. They're both okay. I'm just, I really don't, I haven't heard the podcast Bully Trash. You were doing so well. You were doing so well. I say two seconds.

Well yeah, they weren't in my way. No, for real. It's a female pod about, about female shit like that didn't have nothing to do with nothing.


So I mean go ahead, rock out. But if it was me, nah, I'm fighting that same Mandy, Bridget fight about who gets what and rights and Yeah, no, I'm having that shit. Yeah. It's me and I, I would just like to know this, the, the, the state of things with the name of the pod being horrible decisions. Horrible. W-H-O-R-E. Horrible, horrible decisions. The whole IP sense. And some of the problems. And some of the problems that can come along with, with getting, finding advertisers and sponsors for that style content. Yeah. That can be rough. That can be rough when you, when you are controversial, edgy shock jockey or just talking about shit that don't appeal to middle America.


Right. Like if you're not making your bones in the outer la Chicago to Maine cities, then that could be tough. That could be tough. So I'll be watching, I'll be watching. Congrats for the run.

No, ain't bother. I don't have no real malice toward, toward Mandy. But again to anybody out there to whom make concern. Tom To whom? Yeah. To whom we may concern. Let's use this as a teachable moment. I've said it to her. I'll say it to y'all if you want to own it. I ain't paying you. It's yours. Like, I don't know why that's such a tough concept for people to grasp. If you own the house, you gotta pay for the landscaping. You pay for the flooring you pay when some shit break. Sorry.

Niggas have not paid rent and went to Dave and Buster's went to have a blast.

Like if you go to Dave and Buster's, I'm like, okay, you know, it's, it's, you know, it's Pookie's birthday, whatever. But if I saw you with a new, with a new bed, I'm like, come on bro. Like you coulda paid your rent. If I see somebody, I know how much court size seats somebody. Court size seats is crazy. Yeah, but you also know Yeah, because you have them season long. But you then, then you also know that there's family and friends. There's are you fucking a player? There's the company seats, there's the company suites, there's your just a plus one. I was Kaiser plus one at one of 'em games that last year court side. And I could have not paid rent that month. I, I take, I take you on, I'll take you on the plus one.

Man, you're no longer a landlord. So Yeah, they weren't, they did. I saw you. I definitely sold the cribs. I couldn't fuck with it no more. Man. I never want to see the tenant. Oh, I used to hate that shit. I never want to see the tenant hire the company that's gonna deal with the tenant. Yeah. It was, it was Hood low. Like low income.


Ain't Oh. Shit. Yeah. I couldn't afford, I mean it wouldn't been worth it. That's why I got rid of it. It wasn't, it wasn't worth it man. I wasn't built for that. And you said flip was hard up? Oh?

He said, you married or do you plan on being married in the next six months? I was like, no. Why? He was like, all right, well we'll throw all of these perks to the side that you could get these exemptions. This like, I mean, I do love her. Yeah. Hold on. I love That is my baby now. No, for real. That's why yo, that's why these niggas is out here getting married because they Love it girl. Well, It is a little bit, that's what It is a little bit. But that's why I got married.


That's what Mary's been didn didn't even realize It was a thing until after a couple years. I was like, oh, Oh, Shit start clicking. Yeah. All right. See now I don't know if I want a big wedding or small wedding since this is happening so soon. It's a busy now I gotta that changed a little bit. What? Oh? Shit. Oh. But anyway, Shemar. Moore.

Quamy fucked you up. You stretch your legs now. I mean, she's quite the word Smith herself.


I'm not used to her. Just come on. Heard. Wow. She was a character, a family guy. A new miniseries. come on man. We have to find out how long he's been with his partner. He, they, they've 15 years. Their relationship history goes back 15 years. That's enough. Alright. So they said to him like, are you going to be married to her? And he told people, people magazine by the way, he said his girl girlfriend It is his partner in crime. Meaning like, that's my person. Whether we get married or not, they got, they welcome their first child, but he, he gotta use that person shit. But he said, but he said he quote doesn't see marriage in their future. Not just not now. He said, I don't see it in our future.


And he said to me, this is we, he went full nigga. Right? I love this. To me it's just like, tomorrow's not guaranteed. But Jess Ray, that's his girl. I'll give you everything I got today and tomorrow. She is my partner. She is the mother of Frankie. Frankie has a dope ass mama. And I'm gonna try to be a dope ass daddy. And we going to do that until God calls my name. And then when they asked him why, he said, because he didn't have a good model for marriage. He said, I didn't have a good role model of marriage in my life. Not my mother, not my father. Nobody close to me. But here's the kicker for me. Oh, is It. is It is when they asked him about why. And he basically said, I'm trying to see if I got the quote. But basically what he said is, I mean, marriage is supposed to be about trust and a prenup is, is that really trust.


So he's saying if he can't marry her without the prenup, then he don't feel the need to be married. He shouldn't be marrying her. No. Right. But he, he does need a prenup. But he needs a prenup. Did did anybody go to Tasha K and see what his partner said? Anybody hitting Milagro to see what, what his par wife or partner thinks about this? Somebody gonna talk to her. Oh, they going to talk to her. They're gonna find her. They gonna talk to him. Why not? Why not? As bad as this sounds, they killing him on it. Women in particular are dragging him on the internet right now. Well, women have some grace. There is another reason that he may not want to marry her. Oh, Oh. Shit. The white ho The white Howard.


Reason Oh. Shit. I'm just asking Oh, Shit the cops, they're coming freeze. Nah, don't say freeze wrong Joe. I'm just, I'm not gonna say it because I do have, I do have respect for, for the man. Yeah. So I'm not gonna say it, but, but I'm gonna try to think it really hard so it can, so y'all can on the butt. But listen, if nobody confirms that, why do we, why do people assume things like that? 'cause I saw all the soul trains.


Only two. One nigga. I didn't just watch Don. I seen when he was dead with the corn rolls. And I seen my other show that he was on too. Criminal minds. Criminal minds appreciate that. So you think that he's I think that not him. Lemme take it off him because you know, I don't know nothing about him. We take it off him. We'll take Yeah, I don't, I don't know that to be factual. So I don't spread that there go, go. However, for the rest of y'all with, with beards, I could see your nigga saying, how dare you marry that bitch. I could see your secret gay lover saying, nigga, we've been together for 20 years. What the fuck? I dare you marry that bitch. You could keep her.


Don't listen. Bitch is bitch is out here. Whatcha talking about? No, I'm not talking about him. But I could see a nigga's nigga saying, marry if you want my nigga, I dare you. But isn't that part of what you signed up for with the beard like that? They might be a, that they might get married, but you still gonna be on the side and be a priority. Like a lot of Hollywood people get married to to put to, to put the front up. Like I'm gonna marry this woman. And then you still gonna have the dude on the side. That's, that's the Hollywood model. Yeah. But what you think that, that everybody gets, every, every partner gets to be jealous. Except for the, the, the, the, but I just say that might be what they signed up for. Like, like the gay dudes. 'cause I'm with you. I agree with that.


Yeah. That should be part of the beard marriage. I do. Yeah, I do have question. But if you have a gay lover that's jealous. Territorial, overprotective. Spiteful. Just yeah, I can see that can stick It. is it gay on the side? Is that the cheek? What? Because the beard covers the, I I have a question to you, to you guys that's been, I'm getting dramas. I have, I have a question to you guys that's been fans of celebrities and stuff like that. When you hear, when you, I got you buddy Thank, you, when you hear that they're gay or you hear some, you know, you know they bisexual. Do you think that they always had or do you think that listen or do you think that when they became a celebrity they had sex with so many women and did everything that they can do that they wanted to try something new?


Can we mark that down? Because all the gays don't have, I'm not, I'm not talking all don't fuck you up. I don't wanna fight nobody. I don't wanna fight no gay. I fuck with them. Like that's not what It is. I asked except you do. No, I'm cool. Nah, listen, Fuck that niggas always gotta make it salacious. I'm just asking a question that, like when you hear about the story about Richard Pryor or Luther, like these story about people that you may think that they have a lot of women. Do you think that you thought Luther Vans had a lot of women? Well, nah, nah, I'm just saying. Oh, this, this is what I mean. He was the president of Pat LaBelle fan club when he was 15. That was the first time But. yeah. But home me down mo you know what I'm saying? I know Thank, you. This is what I was a couple things, right.


First I don't think that Hollywood makes you gay. I think that, you know, people are gay and then they go to Hollywood and sometimes you have to perform a certain thing to be acceptable. Especially in the eighties and nineties. Half the RB singers in the 1890s were gay. A lot of our favorite singers and athletes among other things were gay. But they couldn't beat that Heartthrobs Rock. Hudson Rock Hudson's a classic example, right? Yeah. And he ended up for real. Yeah. Yeah. He died of eight. He died of eight. Died of aids. And not to say that that's, you know, but in the eighties it was, it was considered said at Parks marked God, I Got it Thank you. Sorry you can't say that. But, but in the eighties. But he's also married to a lesbian too.


Right. So they both were were they were covering for each other. But, but the bigger picture here for me is the second part of what you said, which is, do you just have so much sex and suddenly like, I've had a decent amount of sex in my life. Right. More than the average doctor. More than the average rapper probably. Right? But hold up, hold. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What his name? Stop playing with him. Stop playing with him. Stop playing with him. Stop playing with him. Not one. There's no through it girl who can't say we sit the fuck down stop of you.


But you always think of da   not fucking whores like us. To, to be clear, I'm I'm, I'm being hyperbolic. I I haven't nearly as much sex as Joe and them people. Right. But, but, but my point is, there's there's no amount of sex that makes you decide you want. You sure though, Martin, I I'm talking about when you hear these stories and, and I just wanna say, I wanna make, lemme talk real quick. I wanna make it clear because I did see a gay man beat up a nigga by the phone booth. I don't wanna become a victim to that. Like, for don't jump me or none of that. 'cause I'm not Well you won't because they removed all the phone booth. Yeah. Well, I don't wanna get, I don't want, I don't wanna get jumped. I don't wanna get jumped by my posters, nigga. I don't wanna get jumped. What I'm saying is that, what I'm saying is that because there's no disrespect when I use the term something that we say nothing, but we shouldn't.


Right. We shouldn't say it. We shouldn it's homophobic. Right. Sorry, sorry. Call me, take that back. I'm sorry. Me. What I'm saying is, I think people are on The, Spectrum sexually. And I think sometimes the more opportunity you have and the more space you have, the more you'll exercise those freedoms in a way that you might not earlier. But I've heard a story where people say that, yo, I did everything that I can do. Like Yeah. A a bunch of people have said that. Yeah. Six women, seven women at a time and think they're a little more queer than they understood themselves. Twin twins. Twins, pregnant women. Like they do it. And It is just like, what's next for me? I don't No, you've had wild weekends before, right? I've had wild weekends before. I'm sure everybody here has, I'm not just saying but before I'm talking, before I'm talking back in the day. Right. What I'm saying is you've never had a weekend where you're like, I just had so much pussy, I could just, I just need a dick now.


That's not how it works. But, but, but, and, and I'm down with that. I'm just saying the people that told the story, they said they have tried everything. And I'm saying they might have been more queer than they allowed, than they allowed themselves to believe. Okay. So you think that It is, it's a spectrum. I'm saying it's a spectrum. Some people, I want to allow the Kinsey scale the space for that Okay. Opinion while also acknowledging the, the people in that community that get off on turning straight men out. Yes. Yes. Because they exist. That's the thing they do. That is the thing. So I don't want to say to the guy that got turned out, Hey, you've always had a little bit in you. I'm sorry. I do. That's that's, I do not think that a straight man can be turned. A straight person can be turned out.


You Can't. Yeah, I'm with, I'm with Mel. You can't wait. Hold on. Just like, you can't make it a gay person. Straight. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Mark. It is, it's a spectrum. No. People maybe just don't realize where they are to the s right. Might be, lemme ask you about this box. Yeah. What about the people pull together that Thank you. Thank you. Man, I wanna be, damn man. Hold me down short circuit. Thank you, Thank you. I wanna be, I wanna be careful. There was a situation I was aware of where a person looks like comes off as a woman. They weren't. And they'll wait five minutes until the man arrives to their house or when they get there to tell them I'm a man. And about 80% or 90, lemme say 85%.


The man will just continue on. And there's been issues like what do you say to those people that do that couple? Can I say a couple things about that? One, they usually don't say I'm a man when they say I'm trans. 'cause they're not men, they're trans. No, no, no. But this one was an androgynous male. So he said that he was a man. Okay. That's okay. I just wanna be clear. I want people to think that you're calling trans people male. Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. I'm talking about, I'm talking about a particular person that I know. And, and he, he was an androgynous male. And then you showed up to the house and what happened? He, not me. Not me. Please come on. I never, before you stayed there? No, no, I never did that. No, no, no. But I used to. I used to. I used to. No, no. Because this is sensitive topic, so I wanna be careful. I don't wanna laugh. Well, come on. 'cause I have more questions. Yeah. Yeah. Ari was anr male that dressed up as a female.


And he would document when people come to his house and five minutes later I used to be on live telling him, yo, be careful. He would document This shit and show us on the live. And we said, yo, be careful. One time he got into an incident, but a lot of times he would say like, yo, these guys will not leave once I tell them that I'm a man when they get here. And a lot of times from what trans people tell me, they already know. And a lot of times a lot of the fights and the battles and the, oh, I, she, she, she told me this and it was this, but it was that. It'd be bullshit. That's their excuse deal with you. You're not saying that. Hold on. There's some, there's some trans out here that you can't tell us a trans, we are not gonna do that. And that. Wait, that's my question to y'all with this sexual spectrum stuff, what do y'all say to the, recently there was a trans woman on online and in the train she was thirst trapping.


What's she got? A train? Well, the one that Oh, like that was kissing like that like, and they was like, yeah, like, yeah. And in the comments, there were a lot of men attracted to her. Yeah. Yeah. They were. But because do you say that those men have, Well, hold on, wait, is she, is she presenting herself as a woman? A biological woman? And because See, this is where you confuse It is a trans woman. Gotta be walking around looking like A woman. I understand that. So if she's not saying, you know, outright, by the way, I'm a trans woman, and then, you know, men responding, then they're responding to what they believe You think is a woman, a beautiful biological woman? Yes. A cis woman.


Yes. A cis woman. Yes. That's what they're, that's what they're thinking. Yeah. I used a what? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Melissa's a cis woman. Oh, they got you. No, she is. I Am. You're a cis man. And you Not, you're a cis man. Okay. Okay. You're not You. Joey would, that would explain a lot. Hey, hey, hey guys. Y'all can crack the jokes all y'all want because you guys conform to what society think is no nigga, I'm a man, period. I don't add any, don't add any caveats to, to my gender because people, are you a biological man? Yes. So you, that's a caveat. Listen, but that's what I grew up knowing. Right? This sis this cis term just came around.


So what, so did African American It. is that, so did African American. Don't, it's not real. It's the thing we identities. It's not so what ma Because now I have to be able, not now. And I, I should just because other people want to be called, I should be able to tell you. I don't like that. Okay. Not saying me. I don't have a, I'm just saying like, not saying me personally. I'm just saying I, I've seen people die on that hill. Like, don't call me a cis man or don't call me a cis. I seen it. I didn't understand why. And they should be and they should be. Right. It's the flip side to that. If you have to, if you have to respect the other side that want, hey, respect my pronoun or whatever, call me this. And you have to respect that, then you should have to respect the person that say, don't call me sister. Me. I don't give a fuck person. I'm just saying that person. I wanna say this whole segment started because I said that I like to appeal to everybody.


To everybody. And then we just kicked nigga back in. Fucking said it. It was Shemar. Moore said it all. Yeah. Bleep all of that that I just said. Yeah. Yeah. Bleep it out man. Shemar, Moore fucked everything up. Shemar, Moore, man. But then hold on, hold on. Back to Teel. So then when they find out that it's not a woman, right? It's a trend. It's not a cis woman. A cis woman. Yeah. Okay. And they and they A biological woman. If that makes you biological woman. Alright. Corey said leave it. I just wanted to know like if they still was interested. Does, I don't believe though that if you get turned out, it was always there. That's the one. I don't, I can't roll with that one. Corey said let go. I can't roll with that one. I know that our hoods teach us that.


But I don't know if I roll with that one. Why? Why? Because to me, that, that that don't, that don't emphasize the turned out part en enough. If it's there dying, dying to come out, it don't have to be not Necessarily dying to come out. It'll have to be done. It be dormant. Or if it's just there deep and dormant. Yeah. And somebody comes and now you Yeah, I don't because if it's not there, even if it's, I believe that a straight, that straight man can get turned out, you're not a straight man.


That inherently Means that they're not a straight man. Yeah. Yeah. Just in the definitions of words, you're not a straight man. If you're attracted to anything other than a woman, you are not a straight man. You are no longer for you for, for the attraction to be there. You're not straight But. yeah. No, it's no switch. But do you believe people are born away? I believe that. I believe that straight people fuck people. That they ain't all the way attracted to all the time. Attractions. That's not the same thing. Physical attraction is not the same thing as sexual orientation. You know what I mean. Like, Well why not? Its not just if as a straight man I can sleep with a woman and not be all the way attracted to her. Still a woman, then can's still a woman. Then why can't a guy and guy exchange start with one person not having that attraction?


Oh, that does happen. That does happen. It happens. That's all I'm saying. It happens in lots of space. Rehabs, the military, prison, there are lots of spaces where people who may not necessarily do that outside of those spaces do it. 'cause it's a homosocial environment as people of of the same sort in one place. I'm with you on that. But what I'm thinking about is maybe we should get past the binary. Like maybe it's not you're straight or you're not. There's a spectrum. A lot of experts say it's, you know, that kinzie scale, you go from zero 10. So, so like maybe due to just a one on that scale and not a 10. So you get to the white party You know what I mean and, and, and you keep going year after year after while you're like, yeah, maybe, but there's something. But if you were zero, you probably never That's what I was gonna say on, hold on. I get that with them Hollywood parties and shit.


Sometimes it could be, it just that this is so accepted here. You might have been curious or what they doing in there. All right, well this is the one spot that one, you don't think It is going to get out. This is a secret. Some secret shit happening here. And we do it and don't nobody know about it. A lot of times when people start that whole, yo I'm not this, it's because somebody found out. Right Now you on defense. Well, lemme just say It is like the girl that the white girl that fuck with the black dude. Yeah. And then she was with it until people found out about it. Now I gotta change my story. Wait, So I I have one last question. Okay. How many women do you know that are like bisexual or have had a sexual interaction with a woman? A lot. And so do you not think that just by kind of statistics that it's probably a similar number for men that are just not Well, hold on.


There's a difference. Please tell Me. With women experimentation is a lot more accepted. That's what I was getting to. Yeah, that's exactly What I was getting to. It's not different, but No, but also there's no difference also. But but also, but also when it comes to women can't receive encouraged women can't receive one another. You know what I mean. We take men into our bodies. We can't do that with one another. You know what I mean. It's still, there's a hu there's a huge difference. You go by that 15 But. yeah, I don't see the difference. Strap you down. No, I'm just playing. Yeah. These gay girls. It is throwing a strap on. No, but that's an, an apparatus's an apparatus. It's not a body part. I get what you're saying. You know what I mean. So it's just like, that's what I say. And still having Sex with the same gender.


Yeah, I understand that. But it's more, it's more widely can't, it's more widely accepted to And she can't finger the other girl. And we don't label the women when they do It is the point, right? Like a girl, like We can label it as experimentation. I'm not sure that All gay men or whatever The, Spectrum is are going right for butt sex off rip. I knew a gay couple that were not into butt sex at all. Say But. yeah. Could just say anal. I'll never be mature enough to not find the word butt sex. Fuck. I just have to say that. Hey, yo ball. Lemme, lemme just tell you something. In New York City, not me in New York City. Your friend, a guy that I know beginning a long order, that's what a guy that we'll call him, we'll call him It, is it was online.


Oh, Shit. No, not Skip. Come come don don guys. Lemme just say story because it was on the internet. The guy that I know, straight or straight get girls. But he was in the strip club and he got a lap dance from a transgender, a trans that doesn't look like a man at all. Like had the whole operation and everything. Okay. Like, and, and those things happened. So now if he became interested, he always had, you know, he always had thoughts. That's not what I'm talking about. I mean, obviously there are times where you just don't know. Right. Okay. You know what I mean. But that's, I'm just saying that, that's far more rare than people would have you believe.


I agree. And I also Like when somebody's had sexual reassignment surgery, like the entire thing, you turned your fucking P into a V, you got the titties and shit, you got all the hormones and you present now and look like a woman. You could probably get away. Yeah. You could probably get away with never Actually having to admit that if you get that affirmation surgery. And I, and I and I heard that. They don't have to admit it. We did it Got it, we did it job. We unpack it. No, we did it all. No pun. Well, no pun Or all pun or or all pun. All pun. Y'all wanna clap it up for Jonathan Majors and Megan? Good. Let's go. Gabe. Somebody said, somebody said they, somebody said they broke up wasn't me.


No. No. I don't know. I don't think it was you. No. We, we, we say we don't know. We gonna mind our own business. Yeah. Why you keep holding him down? Well, it, I'm not, it wasn't my man not here to defend himself. What you talking about? Who It is? Between, between Mel and I? Yes. Millions of people listening. I said that somebody said that Jonathan Majors and Megan Good broke up. That was the internet rumor. Yeah. Yes. And then she, and we rejected it. She said, no, no, he didn't say that it said this. So I was just bothering her about it. I was just, that's, that's all it, that's all It is. But I'm good for, I'm, I'm glad they, you know, again, marriage rates, which Shemar Moore. It's the opposite of Shemar. Moore. You know that the, the black white marriage gap is getting bigger. Like 60 60% of white women are married between the ages of 25 and 54, something like that.


Right. Only 30% of black women. So whenever I see black women who want to be married, I don't think you need to be married. But if you want to be married, get married. I think that's dope. I'm, I'm happy for them. A lot of people thought this was an industry construction. Yes. That it was a pr campaign timing. So I sure did come, I did Right after the breakup room. I did too until like yesterday. To be honest, Sam, I'm with you. I still do. You still do. I still do too. Absolutely. Wow. Shed that ring on. It looked like a nice ring too. That man What that mean? What that mean? I seen love and hip hop by rings a lot of times. Yeah. We talk a lot of times. Word withdrawing, your honor. And if we, if we put in a, we put in the breakout rumors to bed. What better way. That's true. That's, they just look happy. Now I I hope it's true.


And I hope they're happy. They're professional actors. Congratulations. Yeah. Love wins. Love wins. It's none of my business. It's none of my business. Let me just say that. Facts. I feel you. If they're, if they're happy, I'm happy. Whatever they're doing is working for them and I'm happy. There we go. I just also don't think he fits the mold of what I know Megan Good to she the mold of what I know. Oh yeah. And by and vice versa. And vice versa. Yeah. Life got a funny way of changing shit though. It do. Yeah. If a white girl beat you up in a suburban, you might not want another one. That's what I'm saying. He, he start slave dancers and marrying black women like This shit change. If the white girl chase you down six to half and you lose all your jobs, it might be the one.


Right. And it might get you out the game quick what I'm saying? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I can see it for him. Shout out to them, man. Love wins. Love, love wins. I like that. Love wins again. Yeah. No, I'm a champion. Love up in this piece. You are? Oh yeah. No, no. I'm not even doing that. Honestly. I didn't realize how much you loved love until I saw your Instagram. That ain't I agree. No, it might being funny. I does my Instagram say I love, love post shit. My girl argue totally different. No, no, no. You, I'm talking about your post for the birthday. Oh, the post. The post. It was the beautiful, the tears. Yo, what was the part that, that position all this, because I wrote a along. It was a lot. What was the part that had you, like the whole thing, man? Yeah. It was when, when you, I think it was when you talked, you, you did a great job.


'cause you, you, you're a writer so anybody can write shit. Right? But it was clear that you saw her and the things you loved about her weren't the things that are superficial. But you loved something like in her core and you were able to communicate that. And then you were vulnerable when you talked about, you know, you know, sometimes just crying. You know, you were over you, you were vulnerable in a way that you don't necessarily have to be and that you not normally are. I thought it was beautiful, man. I thought it was super dope.

My exact quote was assuming that all of us here are bad at accountability, you are just the worst at dodging it. Okay. Right. Yeah. We all on the same level.

So, yo, do you know, and I just learned this yesterday, I posted on my Instagram that November 18th is National Married, Married to a Scorpio Day Support Group Day.


That's funny. I think You added the support group Part. No, no. It's National. Married to a Scorpio Day, which turns out that's the only sign I could find that had a day that has a bunch of support groups. Wow. For people married to them. I put in every sign it was only Scorpios. And I think it tracks, I think, I think that's bullshit. I I ain't like that shit. I think that's bullshit. I think that there's other signs that are just, they're a lot more problematic. I also don't think Dude Scorpios are like, girl Scorpios. My girl saw that shit and said she's starting the one for Geminis. Well, what that, what's up? I would, I would say that y'all are way more problematic than fucking Scorpios On the list. I I wouldn't say on top of the list.


Top of the list. My girl throw a Virgo. She have one. Absolutely. I agree. I agree. Vir with that shit. Shit. I'm shocked that we don't. I'm shocked we don't have one. But we so Ill with it. Y'all, y'all need. That's what Y's saying. We so Ill with it. Y'all need two groups. Y'all need that one. And the ones that finally make it out be like, yo, I survived a Virgo. Y'all need, need that Group too. Facts Virgo. Yeah. Y'all Geminis are great. My wife's Gemini ain't got no picture. Say about that. Camp Flog Gnaw. Yes. Tyler. The creators Festival festival that he throws. I didn't see any of it either. And on my little, on my little romantic post under there is a page that looks like Tyler the creator's page saying Get it right Joe.

But I don't know that that's him. I'm check, check. So I never said nothing. I'm about to check. Oh, that's I hope It is Him because I know his name. That's great. If that's him. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. To do under somebody's romantic because This shit is like Felicia the goat. Felicia the Goat. Oh no, that's him. That's him. That's Tyler The Post. But that's his page. We should goat. I ain't even mad at Tyler. Tyler is becoming like new age me for these people. Like he don't, did y'all see them trying to paparazzi him to death when he was trying to get in his car in LA and he said, yo, I'm a dickhead.


I hate all of you. Get the fuck away from me. I I'll hit you and I have the money to win the lawsuit. I like that shit. I like it. I like that type of honesty. Camp, Flog, Gnaw. What, what, what, what do we think everybody performed? Eno interviewed three K. Three three K said he, he has more music coming and, and the flute album didn't, didn't count against his contract, his music contracts. What else happened? Mustard. Mustard. Mustard. Mustard was the takeaway, right? Takeaway? Yeah. I, I have clip. That's all I heard. Y'all kick it? I have the clip. Yeah. It was two, two pieces. That's a fire segue though. That was weak. Weaken love. We can love into fucking crew. Love crew. Love crew love like that.


That's fire. Fire. It's fire. It is You Got it. Yeah, I Got it. Y'all, y'all kick it. That psych killed me. I love that shit. Yeah, I Love it This shit made me appreciate like that again. Yeah, me too. As I was telling y'all like, yo, I had like that threw it on in the car. The, I'm like This shit. It still hits still. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. I listened to it a lot too. That's a hard fucking song, bro. All right, come on. We here. Alright, let's see here. I don't have a major hot take from it. He played not like us. It's his record. It's his set. He's gonna play it. And they went in, they went insane And they went insane. Like I saw saw that the, the stream footage. There were people there recording.


I saw them put their footage up. They went crazy over there. And I'm like, it was all In LA right? Yeah. But that don't, that I Don't understand where the shock of any of this Is. That doesn't, when it comes to them festivals, people travel for them. Yeah. Especially the big ones. Yeah. So I don't, people say, yo, what's in la? What do you expect? Nah, it's, it's, it's Tyler's festival. It's people from all over that come to these shit. So it's just that record still has that impact. And there's a distaste there a little bit with dude from Camp. Flog Gnaw Festival. Okay. Because Tyler brought 'em out. Yeah, they, they booed him because, but they booed him because they thought it was Frank coming out. Frank. Yeah. But that, oh no, this is all when not like us came on.


Yeah. Oh Shit find the other one. This shit bro. Come on man. Yo, y'all can say what you want. No, they still going. This is nuts. Crazy. They rapping the parts that the crowd shouldn't even know. Like this part.


Oh That ba God bitch. I ain't gonna front listen to that if I'm a Drake. I'm mad at all these niggas too. I'm mad at everybody. I'd hate everybody man. I'm mad at Tyler. I'm mad at all. Y'all I. Gotta see everybody Run it back. I. gotta see Everybody. Hey I gotta, I'm getting hype. Go ahead. I got, I Got it. You ready? Here we go. This one Psych.


Okay, go, go, Go. God damn. Whatever It is between them two though. It is, it's definitely up. Yeah, it's up. That ain't going nowhere. That shit is so hard, Paul. That's hard. I mean, It is not nothing new to reporting old songs. The beef is over But. yeah. Them records are not going nowhere. That's the want 'em to leave. But them records, you see Apple not going nowhere. See Apple just called Kendrick Artist of the year or some shit. Rapper of the year I think. Something like that. Yeah. Mm. Well deserved. Yeah, I was listening to the radio man. I and I I think there's something else there too by, and, and I heard the word I heard not like us and even I was kind of surprised they let the word pedophile and all that stuff play on the radio and they, they let that shit go.


Yo. I was at a hol a kid's Halloween party at Turtleback Zoo Turtle, Turtleback Deadass with my kid. And they played not like us, which didn't make a lot of sense to me and pedophile. They said they, they didn't, the only thing they bleeped that was like an N word or something. Yeah. They let pedophile go and a minor. I'm like, yo kid here. This is really It is not okay guys. It's crazy. That's song just translates everything. Pedophile is in the clean version. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's not a curse at it. Yeah, not a curse. It's just, I wonder how he ain't saying that word to Super Bowl. No, I can't see it. I cannot see it. Crowd might though. No. Huh? No. Y'all think he's gonna do not like us at the Super Bowl percent. Yeah. Record is too big One.


1000000% record is too big. I'm not com We've gonna have to cut it off as, I mean he might do the hook. He might let the beat drop. He might do something. But I mean perform, even if It is only 10 seconds of it, you're gonna hear, you're Hear that I used to You right here to beat. I used to be on that vote. I think he's doing that verse. I agree. Really the verse. I agree. Yes. I think He's gonna do that verse. Yes. It's too big dog. I Got it. What, 10, 12 minutes. That's not to count if I'm bringing any guests out. The Super Bowl is the verse. I'm not giving a whole verse of that. But they're so risk averse. I mean they don't want, especially post Janet Jackson, the FCC is cracked down and they're like, we don't want anything that upsets middle America. He has a clean version of verse one. Okay. Because that would, that would be the verse. I, if he did a verse, I think it would be verse one.


And again, Even if he doesn't say pedophile, The crowd gonna say it for sure. The 70,000 people in that crowd don't know how to stop themselves. Hey, I, I'm saying, I'm say at home happen. But I think the crowds in the living room are saying, I about say, I'm saying at at home at the crib is like, oh, whoever's in my living room is, is Yeah. Well you think they're gonna put a little sign on all the seats. Don't say pedophile. They're gonna yell the words out. That's why, that's why I don't think they're gonna do the song. That's that's what I'm, and that song is so big people, 70,000 people, the stadium, 25,000 of them know that song By heart. By heart. 'cause they gotta do it because he gotta get to the why. Why, why, why. And that's right. They have to, that part has to. They minor. Yeah. I think he comes out to the beat. I think he did something with the beat. But none of the lyrics. Right. See I think you hear the like that beat, I don't think you hear like that verse 10 seconds of like that beat.


I do think you're getting some of that verse. I might, I don't think we don't get no like that. Like that. Just the beginning. Just the beginning. Just 10 seconds. Like Usher, when he came out to, what did Usher come out to? It was superstar, not superstar, whatever. It was my way. It was like five seconds of my way or three seconds of my way. And then he just went into something else. We'll see the super see Super Bowl around corner. We ain't gotta guess find out. Yeah. We'll we do not have to guess anymore. Let me see here. Let me see here. Yeah, Ken DeMar. So Don't you out there killing it. Atna. How you say It? Flog, Nona, Whatever. It's, it's, it's It. is Wolfgang Backwards? That's where you come from and shit. But? yeah. I Still don't know how to say it.


Well wait Now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If It is Wolfgang Ain down to Doci? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. If Drake has it out for anybody who was dancing to This shit at the show and anybody who's with that pedophile shit then how's he to feel about Tyler now? That's what I, I said if I'm Drake, I got a problem with him. Y'all know what this record is doing. Y'all know what this is. Y'all know what it's calling me and it ain't going nowhere. But they didn't have Kendrick perform. It was Mustard. I don't, you don't care. Right. No, I have a problem with you. You, you know what Mustard is gonna do. Right. You know Mustard is clear. It is up with me and Drake. Right. Mustard. Every chance he get again Mustard blames Drake for his album cells.


So there's another level of the beef there with him. He should stop. But again, from Mustard's standpoint, nigga, I'm on your ass. And if it, if it's this record, I gotta use. I'm gonna keep using this record. Anything dissing you I'm with. So now if you go and book Mustard knowing that's what come with 'em. I'm, I'm It's up with you. Yeah. If I'm Drake, it's up with everybody. I understand Drake We talk before, so I ain't gonna do it again. But if I had a real relationship with Drake, don't beef with me because the DJ I book played this fucker. Or if I got a real relationship, I might make that call to Tyler. If I'm Drake. If I have a real relationship, yo This shit is too much right now. Like I, you can't have this nigga with me. I might call in a favor. I need him to not perform.


I also don't think Tyler is the one that, and Tyler ain't take needs the friendship of any of you. No, no. I'm saying Does Tyler care? He don't care. Care. I don't, I don't give a fuck. Fuck. I wouldn't say if he did that to Jerry Carmichael eating Chinese food, then yeah, I don't think it gets too far. Which go, which also goes more to that nigga did that shit, that shit to Jared Carmichael eating the shrimp and broccoli. Like no nigga you can't fuck me. Move nigga Pastor April and that and that goes to Drake's post about the, you know ain't no friend there, his his birthday. That show that he was at, he was making the comments about ain't no I don't got no friends in This. shit. Like, yo, y'all is running around like this. He might have made some calls and tried to get some people on his side and nigga was like, nah, we ain't rolling. I've reached my Drake quota for the year.


But this is what I will say in 2025. I would love to hear Vulnerable Drake make a return. Not Mafioso, Drake not no Face Drake. Like just tell us how you feel for Real wants. I would love that. Yeah, I would love that. Don't think, I think, I don't think he can no more. Why? I think he, the the, the brand has grown too big. The facade is too big for me to now sit here and be vulnerable and tell y'all what's really going on. You can do that. You can do that at 3:00 AM I'm keeping, I'm keeping, he can try something at 3:00 AM It's fucked up right now. It well mentally so I gotta keep this looking a certain way to y'all. I can't tell y'all what's really happening. Well if dude, if that's the case, then don't do all that at the DeMar de Rosen game if it's that. But like we, that's the, you have had a year unlike you've ever had in your life.


Worst year ever. I'm not gonna call it that. I'm just gonna say a year. Unlike any other year you've had in your life. Your pen is great enough to get in that bag. We've seen it like tell us how you really feel about the, about the one V 20 and just about not gonna happen where you are right now, but not in battle terms. Not in I'm attacking and I'm and I'm fuck these niggas. It's up for life. Gimme that, gimme the real in 2025. Yeah. I don't, that's what I want. That 7:00 AM and like, like that that yeah for real. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I want. I wanna know how you feel about it and I may not get it, but I don't think you, that would actually probably win the fans back too. It would. You're not gonna get it Because I gonna get it. Yeah. I'm gonna park. I don't think it's happening.


You might be right and it's a mistake though. So what you were saying, oh well the no Face video came and went. Everything has come and go after that. So, so at some point, listen, you got high hosts for what this Drake party album supposed to be. Dude, I don't. I mean I do because I love Yeah. You know Party, party and r and b Drake, you believe It's actually happening. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I don't think that's gonna move the pendulum the way that it need to. Do you think that's coming before a New Drake? Something is coming? I think that's the new Drake. Okay. Mm. I ain't spoke to nobody and I don't know nothing. Y'all know. I ain't know OVO people hit me. Look, you said, you said Apple called Kendrick a rapper of the year, right? Yeah.


So I was looking at that. I think it might be something there. We were talking about tech beef. I do think Apple saying that Apple has also, they got some kind of deal with the weekend. You know there's beef there with the weekend and Drake, all of the app, new Apple shit is rolling out using the weekend. His new album rollout is all through Apple. Okay. The new iPhones, they shot the, they shot his last video on the iPhones. The behind the scenes was shot on the iPhone 16. They premiered all of that with the premiere of the new iPhones. He just dropped a video last week that was made solely for the vision headset. An immersive video.


So like they got deals with him. If, if things went left with Apple and Drake, now we go get your your op op. We have the deal with him. Who's the next one of the next biggest, you know, on, on level we don't fuck with you. Okay. Kendrick is knocked you down a peg. So now, okay cool. We going to jump on him. We're gonna tag him as rapper of the year. It, it seems like it's something brewing there. I don't, I could be jumping ahead of myself but I do think it's something to watch that. There, there's I'm you there's some, there's some tech shit going on here. It is I It is this company. It adds up. I think these companies now are doing some other shit. Well I think the companies, I'm with you on your Apple Point. I also think some of these companies make way too much money off This shit.


Like Flog No was on Amazon. Yeah. Yeah. The Kendrick shit was on Amazon. The Wayne shit. I like that. The Wave, the Wayne shit. I do like that Amazon. Shout to Tim over there if that's you Tim doing that and shout to Duo and Mouse. 'cause I see them covering everything that Amazon is pulling over there. They, they grabbing that crew and having them cover. That's really Shout out to Du on Mouse. Suck Dick for life nigga. You know what time It is. You don't get no air, air Time on this big broadcast. Fuck you nigga. Anyway. Yeah, my guys ain't cool. But. yeah. Who Beef, who's this beef with? Joe got beef. I don't, I don don, I, I I that's his beef. Who is he talking about?


The funny It is no beef but some niggas. That's just what It is. Who, who is this? I'll tell you over here. Oh okay. I didn. What? He said you, you know what He ain tried to sneak it in here. Try to sneak it by me. But I ain't sneak nothing by you. Oh, I heard it. My ears is working after I heard it too. I was like my girl just did the little earwax candle shit.
