That's the problem. Yo. She does fall into other categories. Anyway. We can't keep talking a secret on a podcast. That's true. But this is a great time, Mel, to talk about how men overestimate their abilities. Okay, well we were talking about that off, off camera. So we'll bring the conversation here. Corey mentioned something about I told Ish Mens ability to fight Ish, Kept Ish kept mentioning my childhood bully. I didn't even mention that person. You thought I was talking about this person. And this is the second Pod in a row that Ish has mentioned my childhood bully. There's a weird tension between us. Yeah, There is. You don't say he Wasn't even talking.


I wasn't even talking about him. It is all what you don't talk about. It don't matter. He nigga making up shit and staring at it, bro. Young yo Don't, I'm sorry. He create detention. This is who I am. I know. Don't put me over there with You. You're telling the audience how the conversation came up. But It, but that's not how Let him go. Let him go. This is exactly how it came. Let him go. He said one thing. I thought one thing. So I told Ish I was going to go sleep my childhood bully and tell him this is 'cause Ish keep bringing you up. I'm gonna slide him Ish said, no, you not. That's facts. That Is, that Is facts. That that is true. Okay. That's that. But he was talking, I wasn't even talking about that person. It don't matter. Then Corey said, welcome audience.


We love y'all. And then Corey said something about most men, 400% of men overestimate their fighting ability. Something Like that. Their ability to defend themselves. Hundred Percent. No. Not defend themselves. Fight Defending yourself. Ah, yes It is. Is it really? Yes. No, It's not defending. No, that's not what You It's It is slightly Different, but yes. What's the difference? Fighting. Because defending yourself could be curling up in a ball and making it through the night. Right. Fighting too. When they get on your as. Everybody dunno how to curl the right way. Yeah, that's true. What you talk about, everybody don't know how to curl. It's a science Anyway, but the entire room agreed that 400% of men probably do overestimating their abilities to fight. No, actually that's not Hilarious.


It's not, it's not a possibility for it to be 400%. But that's true. That man shit wasn't ever my bag. Oh, Gotcha. What is that? They overestimate by 400% their abilities to fight. That makes sense. It's better when 400%. Yeah. I like, I like the other one. And then The whole room agreed. And then Mel Savannah took that as her opportunity to shoot at us. I like this vibe She in today. She on some shoot first ask questions last year, so please expound. Well, actually the whole room didn't agree. They just, y'all just got quiet and then I decided to say, oh, that's absolutely true. The basketball game was a perfect example of how men overestimate their abilities and then find out in real time that they are not him.


That's The part where the room got quiet, man. Yeah, we agreed with the first part. We agreed with the fucking part. Oh, I missed that part. Sorry. Your basketball shit that you tried to do. Shoot at us fucking lower our self-esteem. This little weird tug of war that we do here at work. That's where we got, even Before the basketball Analogy Example came up, she said, yeah, that's men. You guys are delusional in your abilities. That's true. And everybody said, I Said that Some of this room said we would follow up after to come in. What's up bro? You talking about no problem at all.

Good as you See it. All you supposed to say, is he on his way?


So now you want me to rep for you in that way? What I supposed to say? He on his way. Come on, let's get to it. Let's get to it. What is most important to you guys? We'll get into music first or not really. Mm. Yeah. You don't, you don't give a fuck about music no more. Don't be that much music to give a fuck about. Say surprise music related shit. Like I, I mean I've been cracking up over Lil Wayne Lyon. Oh yeah, that's true. That's music I guess. Yeah, he's on a, it was a rolling Was it Rolling stone? Rolling Stone. Yeah. Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone cover article about him and Wayne Gotta stop.


I don't remember. There was so many lies in there. I don't even know where to start. How do you guys know it's lies again? 'cause we smart. Yeah. Okay. What was the biggest one? He never knew that Jay-Z and Kanye may watch the throne. What? Oh yeah. He didn't know that Jay-Z and Kanye made an album together. Okay. But he doesn't be lying. He could just be going through one of his phases. He could just not Little Wayne knows that Jay-Z and Con Kanye West made an album together. He knows that he's first Stupid Lies male. Lies stupid. Lies Like, like another the interviewer. No, here's another one that was in there. The interviewer walked in there. He had two free Dirk shirts laying on the, on the couch? Yeah. And he said he didn't know Dirk was in jail.


Oh nah. Yeah, he, yeah he, he just like, like, you know what I'm saying? Just Oh he just trolling. Okay. Nah, I believe that one before the watch the throne. Same. He might not be paying attention to Dirk being in jail. What his, whatever his circumstances are. But watch the throne. That's Ridiculous. I have two shirts right here in my room that I possibly was gonna wear. One of 'em in Wayne's room? Yes. Oh, the T-shirts belonged to him. The interviewer walked into Wayne's. It don't matter. Slow. Gotcha. They Were Just in there. Damnit. Alright, fine. It tell her that you okay. That's crazy. Alright. I like lying all just make him a little Believable. He really, really bad lies. Yeah.


Said he didn't know, not like us was about Drake. That's true. He did say that. Yeah. Come on. He said, yo, when y'all saw me dancing to that shit, I had no idea it was about Drake. Damn. He said when I was singing along to it. Right. Yeah. Drake's name is in the song too. Okay. All right. Mm. Oh, I forgot that part. Yes. Yeah. In the lyrics, my nigga. Yo, what if he's just really disconnected from reality, Joe say Drake, what if the nigga just like nigga says, say Drake in the song. I know but what if he just like, what if he, it's the other Drake. What if he just in his Yeah nigga. He say OV Ho who, who else is about But he probably ain't listen to the whole lyrics.


I think Lil Wayne hates a lot of people and just won't say It is. But I've been saying that for years. You have. I think that's some standup shit though. I think sometimes the the Oh I ain't know that is is better than a lot expounding. It is better than expounding on points. Especially you know, interviews to try to trip you up. It's the way, It is way out of It. Or you could say, don't ask me about that shit. Shit. I was just getting ready to say a artist of Wayne's stature. I could have a list of shit y'all can't ask me about A thousand percent. Don't ask me. And I know these are hot topics. Don't ask me about it Or don't do interviews Maybe. No. Maybe he wants to maintain the fact that he's candid and he wants to be open with interview or that there's no question off the table. So there's no question I'm Yeah, I'd rather lie and shit.


Yeah. Ask me whatever you want nigga. And I'm gonna just lie my way through it. I kind of agree with the line on the joint. What was the, what Was the, I'm still laughing at him saying 21 Savage is a group, but that was years ago. Once I heard that I was like, you know what Wayne dude just be skateboarding and just he be out in his own world watching ESPN disconnected from this shit. That's it. But these are just like, you don't have to do it. I mean you got an album coming out so I guess you do have to do it. I was gonna say, what was the purpose of the article of he an album coming. Okay, cool. All right. Six. Right Carter six. Yes. Yeah, he talked about like the Trump stuff too. Just more like I didn't know such and such was going on. I'm not mad at him. Just lie and say I don't, I don't know.


Get through it. I don't wanna take a side. I don't wanna piss nobody off. I just want to be in the studio, smoke my weed and I need to sell my album. But But listen, some people are disconnected from reality. I can speak. That's true. Some people just remove themselves from a lot of things or just don't be in. That's why it don't be in their world. Yeah. That shit don't be in nigga. You be in your own fucking world. Not even paying attention to the fucking internet or whatever. Jay-Z and Kanye, that's all right. But not, not like us. You can't be in this world and not know. Not like us. He say him and Kendrick was cool right? Or what? What? Whatever the fuck. So they spoke the phone. Yeah. Yeah. So he is not interested in Super Bowl shit no more. The moment's gone it we felt like it was taken from him.


So he don't, I have understand he's, it sounds like him and I get that though. Wyclef are doing the album Fire Six sounds like it's executive produced by Wyclef. I Understand that he, he, the features are Wyclef, Riley, Cyrus, elephant Man, machine Gun Kelly, bono Kanye West on production. His son Cameron Carter. That don't excite me. It does Me. I don't care about features. It does. I'm more interested. It Doesn't excite me. 'cause Wayne can make a song And I think they cleared up the, who was it? Miley Cyrus put something out. Billy Eilish. Billy Ish Billy. It was a sample. Yeah, It is a sample. Y'all don't really seem him excited about Carter. Carter Six.


I was, I was excited And we don't have to come in here and talk about shit that you're not excited about It. I was excited about Carter six. I'll be honest, like I he, he dropped a a little project before Caught the six. Before the six. I was excited to hear that Wayne can still rap. Like can't take that away from him. I want to hear him rap with some of the people today that can rap. So when I see this list, list of features this damn near not It is telling me this ain't gonna be a rap album. That's why I'm not excited. The Wyclef executive production doesn't tell me he's gonna go out and get a bunch of like super rappy shit. It sounds like it's gonna be well fucking put together songs. Yeah, I think it's gonna be amazing songs. Why would you say I ain't heard no rappers?


I guess like if you look at Carter three, it was good quality songs on that album. Yeah. And he went outside the box. Yo. What makes y'all care about music today? Good music. Yeah. I think it's habitual. What do You mean by habitual? It's just something that Like Wayne is, Wayne Wayne is great. There's classics in his Carter series. So you could just go listen to those. His History is his history and I'm still sitting here just like What makes me care if I, if if I feel you have something to say, like you went through something now I want to hear you put it in music or you know know. Because again, with social media we see everybody's life damn near.


So if something major happens and now you in the studio, I want to hear how you navigate. Navigate that. And I wanna hear you put it in the track. Put in an album. There are certain people that curate albums better. You know, storytelling throughout the entire album. So those are the things that excite me Before an album comes out. It's hard for me to be excited about like listing features. Like we just said that like who gives a fuck I Don Features can Do it for me though. Yeah, It would take a lot for, Yeah depending on, depending on artists features could definitely get me excited. It would have to be like a shocker. Like if he had Kendrick Lamar on the album or something, it'd be like okay that's exciting. I wonder what that would sound like. And this is from the same people that told me that Wayne's Prime was coming up soon.


Huh? I ain't say his prime was coming up soon. Yeah, Here we go. They Love it when I fucking remember some shit that they forgot About. No, you just be remembering certain ways. We never said his prime was coming up soon. What did you say? Like still wraps at a high Level. You said his prime. He's still, he's still rapping at a high level. He's Still in his prime. That's all we were saying. He's still rapping at a high level. So y'all didn't say he was still in his prime? No, They said he's rapping at a high level but his prime was 'cause I asked and you guys said it was he's Peaked. Yeah but he's still high. It ain't been a sharp decline where it's like alright he's washed the fuck up now. I believe that I used the term plateaued. Yeah, Got it. Yes you did. I Remember that if I recall. And I'm still rushing to Get this. When is this Coming out?


I believe it's June but Alright. I'm still rushing For it. Alright. Rolling Stone. Don't do that again. Don't do that again. You got me sitting here talking about the fucking Carter six and the A block and this shit don't drop till June. Fucking rolling Stone. Yo. Rolling Stone. I'm done with Rolling Stone. He did it. He did it first. I think it was the Thursday before the Super Bowl. He was like, I have an announcement. And the announcement was Carter six coming in June and I was like all right, well I guess you wanted to get some of that Super Bowl steam. Is there any other music to drop? We got a verse from Surf.

Okay. What was our sports fight? We were having Not really a fight. We started talking about the the the we start, it was a baseball conversation first. It was, Yeah, Juan Soto. And what you started talking about Juan Soto and you said that he came on the news and was like, you know, I'm just going through a slump. It was a, it was a privilege to be hitting behind or hitting. Yeah. Juan Soto said baseball, it's a little different without the best hitter in baseball batting behind you referring to Aaron Judge and the Yankees last season. So I'm just like, yo do we don't want to hear that shit if I give you 700, $700 million ever. True. I don't want to hear about the Yankees. I don't want to hear about the best hitter in baseball nigga the Bronx. You're the best in Bronx. The Bronx. No nothing.


Dykeman. Yeah, nothing. None of that. None of that shit. I give you 700 million coin nigga. Yeah, facts. And be clear. Nobody here thinks the debt will continue for Juan Solo. No, it's tough. Yeah. But yeah, right this second it's looking bad. But With regards to the 700 million I started talking about, It is hard to maintain a certain level of focus when you start getting paid that high. And we just see it across all sports. Like when these niggas get that lick. Unless you just got a different type of dog mentality in you to be the best of the best. Which you Should if you get seven $50 million. Yeah. Yeah. But I You should put the dog in you if but if not else You dog. Yeah. Got, I had that when I was broke. It's, it's very few Kobe's.


I think Anthony Edwards has the dog in them. I think Tatum got dog in them. A lot of these athletes don't have no dog in them. Broke the strange. Yeah, the strange thing is like money doesn't really incentivize. I'm on the total opposite side of this tape. What about Jordan? I think that it's A different mental life. I think that if you get $700 million, then first of all, I don't even think the niggas, that's them normal people. You talking about the people that get it And then I think that your focus shouldn't be a new hurdle now after you get $700 million, I think an organization should be able to pay you that type of money. The last thing we want to hear about is your focus now because you have so much money.


Word, I don't even think the people that warrant that type of coin focus is not an issue there. Now if you happen to sneak by the cracks, what, How many niggas kick up in their contract year? Most of 'em Mad niggas kick up in they contract year and next year. Me mediocrity calling me. Well That's the thing in sports. So I'm not so I'm not thing across the Board. That's not what I'm arguing. Yeah, but that's not what I'm arguing. I'm talking about the creme de la creme. I'm talking about the people that get record changing. Yeah. Bags. No, I'm With you nigga. Those people There, there's no way in the world you pay those people what you supposed to pay 'em and now gotta worry about their focus and them performing.


Agreed. No, you getting this because your focus and performing is different than the rest of the field. There's Nothing more frustrating as a, a fan of a team is watching someone get the bag and then fall the fuck off. Yeah Nigga, our Dick Mutombo talk came from Jerome James when y'all gave him all that bread after that one, two good playoff series. And that nigga was in every club with us. Eskimo. Yeah. But that's Jerome James. That's kind of my point. He wasn't la he wasn't that. He ain't that he happened to sneak by moles, sneak by. He had a good run and got paid. Well what was a big bag back in that day? 30,000,005 years or something of that sort. But he wasn't what I'm talking about.


Gotcha. I'm talking about Juan Soto, Pat Mahomes, Aaron Judge Kobe Bryant. Yeah. I'm talking about those guys. It's not a focus thing. Aaron Judge gonna have a bad two months coming up. 'cause he does that every year. He does. Where there's a two month that's just like, oh shit, What is he doing? He's wild. But it don't be, he's not focused. Yeah. I don't think you getting that money. If you have a problem with focus, It happens but it shouldn't. Very rare. Yeah, it happens. I think it's very rare shit. Very rare. My guy Tyreek got whatever he wanted handed to him, but he is doing whatever the fuck he wants to now. Yeah bro. I think I'm telling you, I think that You think he's not focused what? On what? On What he focused on. He focused but not on Football.


He focused on Miami life. Didn't he get traded back? Nah, he's still there. Should Be falling for too much shit. Tyreek Hill did not get traded Back. I just came across it. I didn't but he's focused on Miami. What are You other? So he is having a blast out there. He's having a blast. Fuck. He's having too much fun. Fuck Football. Yeah, he, well, two years ago, this is year he did not produce, ain't do shit this Year. Yeah. I drafted him. He ain't produce, he ain't do shit. So I, I just think it's hard though. Did The dolphins reduce? No, he didn't have a quarterback for six games a year. So that what I'm saying. But still the fall off was not in proportion. I just, I think it's hard to maintain a certain level of professionalism and really, really, really be focused when you attain certain shit.


It is like chasing a girl that you always wanted to get and now you got her and you start taking it for granted. Oh I don't know nothing about that. I know you don't. Not you And y'all don't think that's him competing with me. I said you don't. Not competing shooting though. Competing. That's Not competing. That's shooting. Absolutely. Shooting. Yeah. Or shooting. Yes. Shooting in the, in the spirit of competition baby. Alright, there we go. Alright. Just gotta pointed out. We chase more. See that's the, there we go. There we go. And there's the competition. We That's him. Yeah. And that's what I was getting at early. You about ego. Wait, that's what I was getting at. Wait, what? That's what I was getting at. I'm not falling for the second something is said. I'm not falling for y'all shit.


You immediately go who? More who more and rank everybody. That's the ego speaking a Lot of words for I'm inquisitive. No a a lot of words. That's a lot. That's a lot Of words for yo. As soon as something is said you inquire to learn More. No. You wanna compare to the rest of everyone else? No, not the rest of everyone. Wait, I Don't ask everybody else. I'm Just trying to instances here. But I'm saying there's other things that'll come up and he'll say, because that rank the room. Alright. Oh I'm this, okay, well now your Works if you say something about chasing, okay, now let's talk about And you what your answer. I hear what you can't remotely didn didn't hear what you said. You can't remotely compare. I'm asking you Nigga. Oh, your state of D Lulu is different. Different Yo dog. Do we not we every the well your state of, some of us in this room know Joe.


When he set his sights on a woman, it's over. Am I lying ice? No, it's over. It is razor sharp focus. He's looking for the max deal s that nigga won 700 million. I can See that. When you set your, who are you talking to me? I can See that. Okay. Maybe. And Then he doesn't wanna lose. It's not even competing though. He's competing amongst himself. See, look, you always To get the girl he's competing amongst himself. That nigga is 24 7. No, but I'm talking about the losing because he, the sights get set and y'all know it. So then he really has to No that's not, that's not, it ain't even that, that nigga is like he tunnel vision.


Yo, the horse with a blinded one in the park don't see nothing but her. I don't see nothing but her. Yeah, that's him. But that's not what Chase implies for me. What's Chase, lets, let's, let's define things. That's courtship Georgia. But everybody on court that way. Yeah. That's courtship. You shut The court Down. Judges described to me Is court. Court A chase is your courting is futile. It is. It's you Ain't put, you don't even have a chance. Are you still on it? Not necessarily. Oh no, that's thirsty. That's Chase. That ain't Chase. Yeah. Thirsty is part of Chase. Chase. It is part of Chase. The chase You're chasing. But the chase don't mean that you can't, you don't have a chance. You don't have a shot. Yeah, that's not true. That's not, that's not true at all.


Yeah, that's true. She might just be running a little bit and you, she wants you to be persistent And you're gonna chase. Yeah. Yeah. But it it don't mean you've got a shot man. Yeah. Yeah. That's When I put that Pat Riley playing together. It was the bucket was scored. So you've never chased. Yes, I have chased. Okay. Let's not be foolish about, oh okay. I just Did you get Yes. All right. So you ain't get all of 'em. You got everything you ever chased for? I'm asking. I'm not trying to, you Just answer the question. I'm Not trying to be funny. This nigga. We men my nigga. You struck out sometimes. Yeah, It is. I just answered her and said that. But you talking about to what clip? No, you said you chased. You didn't say That. You Yes. And they said said you get on you and you said said yes. I'm positive deal was a time that I chased and didn't get on. Like, let's not be stupid here.


Respect, I'm sure that that has happened before. Okay. Once. Yeah. That's what I'm, that's what I'm saying once, but that part of my gift is when I've visioned something, I'm able to help it manifest. Oh. And then if it don't manifest, you just say you ain't really want it. Yeah, right. You talk to Yourself. That dunk, yo you cooking freeze you. Anyway, I'm just asking. No, that just didn't happen a lot with me. My god has been really, really good to me. Ice in my life. I believe, especially in that instance, in that field, like my God has been great to me. Like I can't complain about nothing. I'm sure what y'all are saying has happened at some point before But, but it, It is just so little That you so few and far in between that it ain't even worth counting.

And what happens to the family? What happens to him? That season Was Ass. But that's the, that's, she was the star basically, I guess, of the whole season. That would be what I'd wanna see. So was Ass. That shit was ass. I think all the people out there know that. It's well documented.


I think there should be a Gone Girl sequel Part two to Gone Girl. But in the spirit of Ice, I'll take it a step further please. The, in the Gone Girl, they back in the house. She's pregnant. She has the baby in my spinoff, my, my spinoff centers around the child in my spinoff. Those two go to Therapy. Ben Affleck and the Going Girl, they get better with their problem and they raise A psychopath. This Psychopath girl who gets missing at when she's a preteen or a teenager. 16 years.


And now we're putting the parents on trial for the murder of this missing child who's not really dead Fire. Okay. I like that. I like That. That's a good one. That's what I got. That's A good One. That's what I got in spinoff in Detail, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. He thought this out. Yeah, he Did he been through about That? Well, I've been thinking about Going Girl since Gong Girl was out. It is one of Amazing movie. Yeah, It is one of the best. What'd you like so much about it? Everything. Everything. It's an amazing Movie. No, I know. I mean, like, I'm just asking what, what Did you like so much? This I like true love story. It is, that is power. The purest Of Loves. That's fucking Dark. It is. Okay. What'd you like so much about it? It was a true love story. Like I said, I, I love the wife's plan.


I like how she went about it. I like the plot twists in it. I just think it was special. I think Going Girl was really, really, really unique. It Was very, it was unique and story. But I don't get the love part that y'all talking about. Well, we're being dicks. Oh, okay. Oh, I wasn't, well, You gotta love someone a lot to go through all That. Yeah. That, that level of commitment she realized he just needed to nudge to show how much he loved her. You guys are fucking insane. You guys are nuts. She was a total sociopath. Oh, for Sure. She didn't have the capability of loving anybody. Don't sociopaths love too. No, She loved that nigga. No, I, no, she doesn't have the, she not, You don't think sociopaths love? No, I don't think they can.


I guess by definition, I don't think they have The by definition Capability of loving somebody. Yeah. They, I think that they believe that they do, but they don't have the capability of actually feeling love for anybody else. I think that's just one of the things that the country gets wrong. They Just, I mean, well, if anybody's a sociopaths out there, let us fucking know. And if that is true what you're saying, then I don't say she was a sociopath then. 'cause I still think she loved him. She loved their family and she did all of that for them. I don't think that she was a sociopath. No, I Don't think so. If, if, if, if a you're saying a sociopath. She felt too much loved then She wasn't an a sociopath. She planned her own murder and in order and, and he was with him as the number one suspect.


Yes. And, and did everything to basically pin the murder on him with All the purchase. You think she loved him? Yes. Yes. So if he would've spent the rest of his life in jail, she did that on love. I also think that love looks different for everybody. Why is that funny? Toxic? No, that's not funny. We're in Context of all girls. It is very Funny. Yes, that is true. I think that love looks different for everybody. You just in that cage. Okay. That's true. With Big Bubba in them. Mm. Because I love you dog. What you gonna get life for premeditated murder? Because I love you. She was, she didn't let it get that Far. Yeah. It was never gonna get that far because I wasn't, I'm alive. But that wasn't her.


That, that that uncovered. That uncovered it. Yeah. Yeah. That wasn't her doing it wasn't yo damn. He at round and third base. He about to get locked up. Let me go show myself. That wasn't her. Then what happened? How did she get found out when he did the press conference and was She came home. Yeah, She came home. She, that was her her, she came, she came home. She had all of this shit planned out to reveal herself At the end. Yeah. When the news cameras was, was around, she popped her Ass up. That was her. I thought she came home for a specific re like, because he went up there and basically her plan, he made her believe her plan worked.


It, it got him to, okay, cool. So, 'cause I knew it was something that spawned. So if he made her believe her plan work, let's just say he didn't do that. It It is going unpack. No, I'm just asking you Back my sequel. Fuck that man. I mean, It is a good Don't love me that much. What has just been off buddy? See, did He do that? Some silly shit? No, no, no. I was, I was thinking some silly shit like Cosby Show Harlem Nights, like a Harlem Nights spinoff Boomerang. Oh yeah. Good one would be Boomerang. Whatever happened with Boomerang Hall Berry, Halle Berry and and Eddie Murphy. Yeah. I'm casting Mel in my boomerang sequel. Thank you. I would gladly be in that. Why you keep running from the Tracy Ellis Ross story.


My, I'm not, Well, we in hour five. We Are not in hour fucking five. We close enough. We can talk about it. We in hour five. I Brought it up to you earlier. You instead of peep about it, I was a You didn't even answer my question earlier, which was, Hey, if you care about this, look, we can hit it, but if not, then we don't have to. Okay. And if you don't care about it, we don't have to. No, I, I wanted to get, you know, I, I wanted to get a little bit more well versed on it because I didn't get a chance to see it. I saw some clips, but then I wanted to read some of the articles that were talking about it and all the points that she hit. Not just the click Beatty. Obvious ones. You got it. Do you have a clip that you want to play? I can find one unless you have one ready to Go.


No, I don't have one ready to go. Okay. Yeah. Well, some of the things that she talked about was her being her age and being single with no children and then young, younger men. Right. She said men, I'm not mad at that part. She said met her age or what? She said that men in her age tend to have a more exhibit, toxic masculinity and have a more rigid way of thinking about gender Roles. A sorry. Stop. Here we go. I saw that question. I was like, what is this about? Yeah. Because I wanna partner. And so often, and it's not just that I'm older, I'm also very embodied. I am a full, very whole person. Yes. Who knows myself, who is in charge of my life and who lives a very full just robust life.


So you lose your body. It's not just age, it's like life experience and sort of a difference. But I have to ask myself the question, why, why does this keep sort of coming up other than they're hot and gorgeous. There's that, there's that. But a lot of men my age are seeped in a toxic masculinity and have been raised in a culture where there is a particular way that a relationship looks. Hmm. And anything that starts to smell of that for me. Yeah. I am, I I did enough of it. Yeah. Where I was controlled and felt like I was a possession or I whatever those things were, or prize or, and I just, I have no interest in it and I will not do it again.


Distinguished panel. Yeah. She, she wants, she wants, she wants We Should start with Mel before we No, no, no. We always, we always start with Mel. Stop on topics like this. Let no, I I'd like to hear from the room before I speak. You suck your pussy. I'm not pussy. I can't wait. What y'all have to say. She, she, she wants a, a nigga she can mold. She wants a nigga that she could control. That's how I feel when you go younger, I mean a lot of niggas or a lot of men her age or in her field may already be established and may have certain standards and rules that she don't feel like dealing with. So she contributed to toxic masculinity. I don't agree. I feel like with younger niggas, especially if who you are based on you able to mold them, control them, do things and just get shit off.


And I feel like that's what she wants to do, in my opinion. Double standard. Because now if it was a man saying that about a young woman, we'd be looked at, you know, take him to jail to the gallows. You know what I mean? Hang him. That's what you know. So Mel, no, There, there's more. Okay. Antoine, I agree with her. You agree with her? Tracy s Ross Sentiment. I think that in today's day and age, especially a, a woman that's established, they don't necessarily have to conform to the Oh shit. 'cause they don't need a man's money. You get what I'm saying? A lot of times people will conform for a certain security.


Like women seek security in a relationship wherever that security comes from. It don't necessarily gotta be financial, it could be physical, whatever the case may be. Her at that, she 52. So it's not a big, big age, but, and she's established, she's been rich for a long time. Her mom was who her mom was. I think her just living outside of the societal norm is dope. So I think her being open to dating somebody is of any is dope. That's True. Free. Has she dated non-rich niggas that we know of? We wouldn't know. See, money ain't even come into that and that's why No, I'm, I'm just saying 'cause because you you're saying a lot of the, they don't need her for her, her money.


So it's a certain mindset. And I said she don't need a man for money. I ain't say the dudes don't need her for money. I don't know who she's dated. I'm saying that a lot of times when women have their own money, they could play by their own set of rules. They don't necessarily have to control. And you, and you believe this, you, you are a guy that's against double standards. You, you, you always play the opposite. I think this is against the double standard, this older woman saying that she don't want, she, she don't want to date men her age because of toxic masculinity. I don't agree with that piece. I was just that that's that's what that's what he played though. No, but I was just talking about her being open to dating younger men or not necessarily dating in the confines of what, when somebody get, when somebody said my sentence though, like just dating the confine confines are what tradition states.


I I'm not, I think that's dope. Got it. My fault, bro. When, when somebody establishes that, they're comfortable in who they are, they're already established. When they give those pre notions, there's only one other direction for me that you're going or one other reason that you're doing it. What's That? I'm with him. What's that? Yeah, I'm just say you were sliding. Shut up. It could Be that. That's it. Yo It could be, yo, I just want, I've been, I've been slid. Just wanna have fun. I want, Yeah. I wanna fuck with No, No. I wanna fuck a young nigga with energy. Yeah. I want to fuck whoever I want. Fuck. And most of these men nowadays, they in some societal box and I live outside the box. So if you in that box, it wreaks up. I gotta run away girl.


It could be that. Just fucking say the five letters Because we can't, we can't say that I'm not this not saying that about her. If that is the case, I just don't like you trying to attach it to toxic masculinity. That that's the easiest, that's the easiest way to be s that's the way to be accepted by people because that's what's going on right now in society. Once you throw that out there, it's like, Oh yeah, that's Clickbait takes you. I think sometimes they throw that out there to throw you off from toxic femininity. There you go. Oh yeah. Saying course toxic masculinity exists. Exactly. But sometimes they use that shit. Get him as a smoke bomb. Let's focus on that smoke. No bitch, let's focus on your ass Because that's toxic.


But, And some people just don't wanna deal with the bullshit and react. Some people just wanna go through life smoothly. They don't want to hear what you Yeah. She kind of said, yo, I want my own rules. She don't wanna hear opinion. She don't Yeah. She wanna makes her own rules. You know what a nigga, if I meet a cute nigga in the elevator and that nigga hot and sexy and I want fuck 'em, I can fuck 'em. I don't based off your name, have to do what society says I have to do. Yeah. I'm, I'm for that. She also sounds like, ooh, ooh, she also sounds like she has uber success syndrome. I don't know what that means. I don know what that means. But that sounds fine. It is. When you bump into that, we've talked about it before up here, when you bump into the 50-year-old that is, has been successful for 50 years and no, my dating experience is not going to be what traditional Yeah.


At all. At all. So if I don't find something that's in, in line with What my beliefs With all of my weird, been famous since I was in my mom's stomach, but my mom is Diana Ross. Who you talking to? Who you looking at? Like that nigga. No, we're not going over there. We're not doing it your way. Everything is my way. If you can't get with my way, it ain't gon ain't aint no way. And if you don't get with my way, that's what it sounds like. I don't know Tracy Ellis Ross. I absolutely love her. And, and and She's amazing. A huge fan of Hers. She's amazing. We don't take that from her. But, but this goes back to the conversation that we had in the Pod about the CEO chick or the Fortune 500 company similar to that.


Somebody who's in that position and, and just, they're not able to maybe men when your that established, maybe men in her field or her age may be intimidated by that. There's a lot of shit that come with that or make, she may feel that. Like how you say, yo, I'm Diana Ross's daughter, nigga, I don't give a fuck. I know who I am and some niggas don't wanna deal with that girl. We are ready. So, Okay. Was that enough mansplaining for you? Yes. Yeah, it definitely was. All right. Your go have a toss at it. Okay. Well it's interesting what you guys heard and what you chose not to hear. Because when she started talking about those relationships with the men that in her age group, she said that she explained her lived experience, that she had actually had those experiences and determined they were not for her because she used the word the words controlling and possession when she was talking about that.


So you can't really discount this woman's lived experience. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Sure we can, Okay, fine. Go ahead. But I'm not going To, we're we're saying Yeah, that's a crock of shit. You can think that. You can think that. But that's very dismissive. But it's cool. It's cool How many men are there on earth. And we are not about the gender war song. I'm just gonna make a quick point. There's how, how many men are there on Earth? If there's, if there's 7 billion people on earth, I I believe believe Tracy Ellis Ross to be able to bag 85% of them. That, That, so if you only wanna focus on your lived experience, Well what else do you go based off of versus Getting new experiences?


Well that's what she's saying. She's accumulating new experiences, dating younger men who seem to have a less traditional way of thinking and they're a little bit more fluid in their way of thinking and acting. That's what she also goes on to say after that. So You sliding Whatever, whatever you wanna, wanna describe it as. She's Sliding them, she's Sliding them, whatever you wanna listen. That could sound, that just sound like justifying toxic femininity. Why is it, or it's what does, what, what does toxic femininity have to do with this particular situation? She's not really, she's not saying, she's not sitting up there talking about feminism and being a feminist. She, her lived experience is, you're right. She's Diana Ross's daughter.


She's been famous since she was in the fucking womb. She has a very, she's a fucking unicorn. And I use that term because there really is not a lot of women or people that can understand what her life has looked like. Being famous from being a child and all and, and living, you know, and probably having access to wealth and then becoming famous in her own right and having an enormous amount of success from girlfriends. And then Blackish like her lived experience. Experience is extremely unique. And so it's really difficult to apply everyday kind of standards and thoughts to her to what she's experienced.


Man, you Know. Okay, Hold on for a second. Go ahead. I agree. That was awesome. First of all, Thank you. But it's still both, both of those things can be true. Yes. I I I'm who I am the same way. These at let me, you're right. Wait, wait. I wanna start before I forget 'cause you asked me a question. I think anybody operating from, I think, I think anything that's operating in trauma or rooted in trauma is toxic guy or girl. Whoa. Okay. So why are you using the word trauma though? Because you said she's based on her past life Experience, lived experience And trauma with these types of controlling Men. You all use the word trauma. I just said, I just said lived experience.


I'm not using the word trauma, But Lemme just land. He did let me land. Okay. And then, and then have a blast with it. When I mentioned getting new experiences, you countered with her lived experience. So if you are afraid of new experiences or shaping your experiences to only be one way because of your trauma from your lived experiences, Cut that up and on. I'm calling that trauma, which is why I highlighted Tracy Ellis. Ellis Ross's ability to get any man in the world. And there's 7 billion men in the world. One, two, I think the, I think her, I think the mere existence of her contradicts her point.


'cause her point is, her point is, I'm this age, the men that I'm meeting in my age bracket are leftovers. I'm, I'm running into the worst of the worst. Your Words are not Hers. Didn didn't get Yeah, I didn't get that. Oh, That's what I'm getting from what. Alright, so maybe I'm off this. Tell some of that from what she was saying, what I got from what she's saying is The day pool and niggas my age, it Ain't it. I heard that. I ain't even going that far with It. Well, go ahead. The shit she's been around and, and she's into men. Her age ain't into, and when she try to get into it with 'em It is No, no, no. And that's where that toxic masculinity part comes in.


'cause everybody say when you speaking about fluidity and willing to try and allow other shit, the younger niggas is with that today. So she's like, I like this because I get to do more to these. See I think that's a crock of shit that men are not a monolith. I'm not saying a monolith, but, and that's the part I thought Mel ain't, men are not a monolith. True. So don't tell me that there's not a man in your age range. We plant percentages. That's into some of the things we Playing percentages. So the nigga she shot at, at her age range, her percentage at getting off what she might want to get off ain't high. I'm not mad At that. But when you play with the younger ones, I could get it off I'm mad at because of who I am. But it Does, they Gonna let me do what the fuck I wanna do To it. But it does come off like I'm here for a good time, not a long time. Okay. So hold on one second here.


Y'all are on the same wavelength with, I'm agreeing with which she might be. She I might be an undercover freak. Okay, let's with that, put that to the side. You were gonna say something? I was gonna say that she brought up the men in my age range are X, which is a huge generalism about men her age. Yeah. Honestly, I'm her age. Okay. She 52. I'm 49 years old. Yeah. So you can't judge all men that, But you're taken She does. She's not, she's not referring to the men. Please Mel. Lemme finish My sentence. Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. Yo, you can't take all of these men that are in that age range and say that they are all suffering from toxic masculinity.


Had a man been on that interview and stated those same exact things about women in his age group, you would've found that offensive. Right. So you don't find it defensive because she brought up her past traumas that Joe said about controlling men or men that were ex all of these negative things that she lived in her past life experiences. If a man was saying that those things, and he justified all older women as being ex, y'all would say, nah, he just able, he rich, he can control these young bitches. 'cause they weak of mind. See, that's the point I was trying to make. Maybe I articulated myself wrong. What I get from her is this piss in the, in the dating pool of men her age. And to say that to say that like putting it in reverse, like a man can't say that because there is a Tracy Ellis ru out there that is single successful and in search of something.


Why does she think the same? Can't be said for her. You can meet somebody I think. Okay, Go. I'm sorry. Okay. So you can throw a rock and hit a podcast of men talking about how used and washed up women over a certain age is that is a fact. Don't start talking about these incel S not no, I'm not talking about that. He made a point about if this, if it was a, if it was in reverse and it was a man saying this sort of thing, you know, in reverse that we'd be totally offended. Yes, It is offensive, but I can't not hear that because It is so prevalent. Please address the point. I'm I'm okay. I'm addressing something that you said. So I I didn't say nothing about no other podcast I'm talking About. No, I'm saying this specific incident you made it seem like it was just like her.


What she thought is you made it seem like if a man said what she said is not like the common shit right now. I can't, like I'm trying to say how prevalent that idea is Has nothing to do. Yeah. But the men that wait, hold off. 'cause I like that the men that say that, like I just called them, there's, there's a community, there's names for them. Incel red pill, we talking about Tracy Ellis Roth. Okay. See, even that highlights the difference. Okay. So hold on one second here. Now going back to Trace Ellis Ross, you cannot be in all places at the same time and it as it relates to dating. Okay, so for example, I'm single. Do you know how much advice un like unsolicited advice people give me about dating a ton.


I'm just gonna tell you a lot. You know what you should do? You know where you should go. You know what I was thinking? No, I don't. I didn't ask but you're gonna fucking tell me anyways. This is what happens to women frequently is we get unsolicited advice as to where we're supposed to be. It would literally be a full-time fucking job trying to position ourselves to be available to wherever these men are because you can't be in all places all at the same time and also fucking run your life, have a career. It gets difficult. Like it's just, it's not as simple as everybody wants to make it seem like she's Tracy Ellis Ross. So she should have like pick of the litter.


That's not necessarily true. Are you moving the goal post? I'm not, I'm not moving the goal post. I'm not moving the goalpost. I'm, I'm talking, I'm referencing Go ahead. I'm referencing the things that she was saying when she talks about, you know, she goes on to talk about, you know, the fact that she's child free and never got married and that sort of thing. I think that even just kind of putting herself out there to even have that conversation was just a level and you guys are gonna fucking so brave. I do think that It is brave because it's she, because she leaves to herself very open to a lot of criticism and judgment for people to say, that was your choice. You made that choice, blah, blah, blah.


When it's just like you, life just ebbs and flows and takes you in different directions and your priorities are what they are. Like they change vastly. You just can only go with the tools that you have at the moment that you fucking have them To say that is against the power of manifestation, by the way. Okay. I'm, I'm not to Say that life just comes and goes. I'm not talking. It Blows. I blow. I'm not that. That just makes everybody sound like a help helpless. You gotta go sleep. That just makes I did. But that just makes everybody sound like a helpless piece Of shit. But not everybody manifests. Yeah, not everybody manifest. Everybody isn't a manifestation. Not everybody, even not everybody thinks about that's your bag and you talk about it constantly. But not everybody thinks about manifestation or believes in manifestation.


Do you think that everybody believes in, do you think that throughout the course of our lives, right? I think that we all think we got more time. Absolutely. Right. And I think that the choices that you make oftentimes are predicated on believing that I have time. Yeah. So This is one of the best Joe button bars ever. There's three types of people in this world, the people that's gonna make shit happen, watch shit happen, or not know what happened. I think the people that you talking about actually go ahead. He about take. So, so I think that, I think that a lot of times for I got a million female friends, right? And some of them are getting up there in age. And so when I really speak to them, when you really get to the, like, once you get past all the excuses, all the, You know what I mean?


The tough guy shit. A lot of these people will tell you, yo, I thought I had time in my twenties and thirties when I was dissing all of these dudes that were good dudes. They just weren't the ideal dude. They weren't the picture perfect dude. Because I thought I had more time to find him. And then when you get to your forties and you're like, damn my nigga, you know, not saying that nothing's wrong with your forties. I'm just saying a lot of times people feel like some of the choices and that they made, they are regretful in those because I could have fucked with Sean. He was a good dude. He might not have been the best dude, but he was a good dude. He was a good man. I could have made a life with him. And I think that when you get to this age, oftentimes the regret will smack you on the face. I know girls that got artificially inseminated, right?


Because they wanted a child and they just thought they had more and more and more time. And unfortunately y'all are on a biological clock. That's true. And so I think some of that was in some of her interview and her her testimony, That's very true. But Tracy Ellis Ross having the access and the excess that she has, she could have adopted at any point in her life. But she chose not to I think for her specifically for her. And, and, and I think everything that you just said is true. I think that there is a bunch of women who felt like they had more time and didn't find the right partner sometimes. Like you get you drown in options. That's a fact. And y'all know that. You, you, you guys know that. No. True, true. Sometimes you can just be drowning in fucking options and it's like it's analysis paralysis.


You know what I mean? Like where you just can't make a decision because there's so much fucking shit coming at you that you just like, oh, I don't know. I'm just gonna fucking just float through life and figure it out at some point. And then time, You know? And that and that floating, you get to the other side where the other island at. It's True. Like look, I like to say there's like a single second and a thousand years as the same measurement of time in the grand scheme of fucking things. You know what I'm saying? So Wait, what? It's the me the measurement of time may seem small or large to us, but in the grand scheme of things, in terms of infinity and the universe, our life a second and a thousand years Got It. Is the exact same measurement of time is what I was trying to say.


I understand that. Okay. So I think that at different times there she might have had different thought processes. Like, okay, well my career's booming and blah, blah, blah, and this is what's feeding my soul right now. And she's dating and dating and whatever else. And you know, maybe she has a long-term relationship and then ends up badly and she's like, I need, I need, I need, I need time. Time. So this would with myself, this would be Like, that would be really cool what you just said. If she was Thor, What the fuck are we talking about? Am I missing something here? He's talk we were, We were i a human. She Ish was talking about how women will some how people, but he's speaking about women how they will feel like they have a lot of time. That's how You started talking about infinity Melyssa.


How you asking Melyssa Ford an opinion, a Melyssa Ford opinion. And Tracy Ellis Ross's opinion aligns it, it aligns a Melyssa Ford didn't get married, she doesn't have any children. And then, and so she understands what Tracy, she aligns with that. Understand. Yeah. Listen, I'm with that. I I think every, we Can't try to change her perspective. She Exactly. And, and in this way, whatever I say is going to be dismissed. It is whatever. It should be Dismissed. Because you agree with her sentiments. Because Because I understand it on a, on a different level. You know, I, I just understand it on a d different level. When she starts, when she talks about there's a, a grieving process that happens where you don't, where you look at your life and you're like, I never got married and I had never had kids.


Yeah. Like there's a part of that, a part of you that has to grieve that I understand what she's talking about, but I hold on. But I also understand I'm gonna fuck you Up. But I also understand what it means when she says I'm whole, I know what she's talking about. Can I ask a question? Her life is very, is very full. I understand If she came into a relationship tomorrow, she would come in a whole person not looking for him to define her in any sort of way. And Actually one question Does mean slim. He doesn't want me to, he doesn't want me to stretch it out. Do you that, that, that belief of grievances, do you compartmentalize that? Mm. You mean grief? Yes. Mm. I'm sure you have to. Yeah, I'm talking about you, you and it because you relate to it.


So did like, all right, my fault. All right. He going, no, that's a good car. Nah, but why you doing that man? Like, I apologize. No, the way that I, my own personal experience, the way that I look at things Yeah. Is if I really, really had wanted to, I would've respect because I've made everything else happen for myself. Manifestation. But that was the one thing like that just So you do believe in Manifestation, but that three line you said, I don't agree with that Joe. I'm, I'm doing a callback to you in manifestation. But what I said about manifestation still stands not everybody manifests.


Not everybody thinks yes it's real. Not everybody just, you know, thinks like, oh, I'm gonna manifest it and it's gonna happen. Not everybody thinks that way. Whereas for you, manifestation is a very real practice for you on a daily basis. What was the three words you said? No, you don't have any more Questions. I'm asking you. Stop doing that. I'm asking you now. Not her. I'm asking you. Fuck you want me to shut up? What's the Topic? Wait, do you want me to shut up? Yes or no? What's the topic? This same topic. I don't want you to shut and flip. I actually want you to ask his the question to Him. I know he end up, I'm gonna get at him. I already got a plan in a couple minutes that three lines. You I do that. Three lines you said was what? This, you said the three Joe button lines was you got people that do what? Make Shit happen.


Watch shit happen or not know what happened. Make shit happen. Make shit happen. Watch Shit happen. Watch shit happen. Yeah. Or not know what happened. So somebody that makes shit happen does not have to believe in manifestation. That's true. Okay. That's not true. I don that's a part of, that's a part of manifestation. Don't really, I don believe in the manifestation but I make shit Happen. It's make shit happen and not believe in manifestation. You, you could have a different way of making shit happen. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. That's not true. But go ahead. So man you talking about internal manifestations before you make it happen, you gotta think it and when you start thinking it, that's the manifestation is speaking it into existence or thinking it or writing it down. It's a bunch of different me methods. See I don't think that, I don't think everybody is making it happen. Gotta think it. I think some niggas is out here just bumping in the shit.


Yeah, It's true. Some people do bump into a into shit but some, but when you're specific about You bump into shit, some people inherit shit. Yeah some people it's, it's just a million different ways to get to. It's not happen. No. Huh? It's not true. Like inheritance something making it happen. Bumping into It is bumping into It is making it happen. I mean It is manifestation. If you really started looking at the laws of attraction and the laws of manifestation, you bumping into something. It might seem haphazard to you but it's not haphazard. That's true. And not just that. A lot of times you bump into shit. You haven't, you have not prepared yourself for those things to even take an advantage of you bumping into some shit. You could be selling a rollie for five grand. Right. I ain't go to par.


Everybody in here went on a vacation. I ain't want to go. I'm sacrificing. So now I got the $5,000 to buy the Rollie. Where if I went on a vacation with them niggas I wouldn't have had the money. I prepped for that. So my preparation met the opportunity. Now niggas call that luck. It ain't luck Yo. I see how you got a lot of pussy. I see how you got something too little bit. You just Put shit together. For real. If you just, if you I wouldn't be on the phone If I was a girl for a long time with him, he'd just be on the phone finding new ways to Yes. You would about to say that's not true. Yeah You would, you would, You definitely I would talk to him. I hang up boy him. No you wouldn't. You just trying to fuck me nigga dying to get back on the phone. You hang up, you just drive.

You don't who I would Buy the house Then What you talking about lay up. I would show You how to take your resources To No, you ain't gonna show me nothing. You gonna buy. I want that house you buy, you open your ow. Oh and buy me al you crazy nigga. Yeah. That conversation answered early. Yeah. What the fuck you talking about? I ain't even wanna be around you gold digging ass. Oh. Can we be misogynistic for two seconds or you don't have to be misogynistic. Okay, let's hit it. The new trailer for the Fantastic four came out and Silver Surfer is a girl.


Really? Yep. React. It's kind of fire. Silver Surf at No, I'm cool. That's kind of fire. I don't like the shit. I gotta see the character tired of it. I don't like the remixes of me neither. Classic characters. Come on. We can Do it. I would think that Silver Surfer would always be a girl. Alright, come on man. No, that I don would Don't understand. I don't understand the character. I don I don I don't have context. It's just I'm thinking about somebody, somebody coded in Silver. I just think that you'd wanna see like a, a shapely physique. This is Why, that's why you're so complex. This Is why Disney is losing all their money On one hand. You I freeze. Y'all are just going with the flow and Oh, helpless we've been drowning in options.


And then God is a woman. God's not a woman. You right. No flip. A lot of people are tired of it. What? I don't want to see Silver Surfer be a girl. I'm gonna say It, It is about Disney and it might be Fire. I don't wanna see it. I think it see The movie. I think it's dope. And I it might be dope. No, and I think they date doing it on purpose again to try. They are, they are. Like when they made Ernie and Berg gay. Well they been gay. No, don't bring that up. Ernie and Bert was just friends at first. Yeah. Nigga. So they Got rid of Guy Friendship. They got rid of Guy Friendship. They made him salacious. Disney's been doing it on purpose. Yes, you are correct. They've been playing the Inclusive game for a minute now.


Bullshit. And I, I I always say I think it started with the success of Black Panther. Hmm. What piece Black Panther won. Yeah, first one. Oh, the second one was, I Ain't learn from Snow White. That was Latin Panther. But yeah, it went from there and then I was like, oh shit, we got that. All right, let's, let's fuck no light up, let's lean over into the women. Let's lean over here to this. They got a whole women's superhero montage scene in end game. That's dope. Yeah. I'm not saying It is bad, but it, it was unnecessary. They, they went out of their way to include it. That's what people are saying. You just bringing it on us Ish. We know, we know we get it Ish. Look, you got yourself out the box or the misogynistic box.

Tell us Julia Garner. Okay. Ozark Ruth from Ozark. Was it Ruth? Was that her name? Yeah, the the blonde one with a foul mouth.

Like he was showing examples of what a movie looks like taped on 31 35. This is what movies used to be shot in. This is the difference. Like it was like that for Dummies, which was me. So it was a really, really, really great job. Nice. You smoked that shit. Shout to Ron Coogler for sure. Friend of the show Ryan Coogler.

I watch Oppenheimer Nigga in the theater. Yes. That all that shit is a fucking rouge in the act. So y'all niggas should just play off of some shit. I'll let y'all run with that. Now I can sit still and watch a fucking movie. I don't believe that you watch Heim. I don't. So let go to the movies nigga. I did watch Oppenheim, I sat there with my wife and I watched Oppenheimer in The fourth party. Oh, I'm not talking about with your wife. You do shit. You can just do something with your wife. I'm talking about you. I know the whole movie. But listen, so let's go to watch Sin Nigga. You cleared the up. No, Stop trying to play me. Yo.


I'm not, I don't the I don go to the movies with with Y'all. I'm going with you nigga. Alright, I'm going nigga. Alright. You wait right there. I bet you I go when you in there. Okay. And I'll talk to you too. Yo. Okay, my brother. I don't want no beep. I sorry. Okay. Brian still joins Puff's defense team. Brian still is Young Thug's attorney. Oh wow. Does this do anything for anybody out there in terms of the Puff case? How you view it? I don't know his other track record, you know what I'm saying? Like if he supported some other bigger name artists in cases or some other, you know, hefty cases. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because sometimes them niggas like the proof is in the pudding. Some of them niggas have beat them.


So I don't, he He should have tried to get Jose Baez There. There's some, there's some people saying that Puff wanting to go through this trial, like a speedy trial or go through it fast. Maybe a detriment to puff. I read that. Yeah. They said that he should I read that as well. His lawyer should, at least any new lawyer you bringing should at least have a year to gather information and stuff like that. So I I well, I Mean if I'm sitting in there, he didn't a choice. If I'm sitting in there, I wanna rush the trial too. No, He didn't have a choice though. No, I understand his other, one of his other main parts of his counsel backed out. Remember? Yes, we covered that too. So now you might have to replace them. He has more attorneys. I know I'm saying, but that was a part of his counsel. Okay. So you might have to replace him with somebody else.


I think that that's, that's More reason to, to prolong it. I think that that's easy for us to say when you're not sitting in jail. I think that's part of the shit. Like, yo, they put you on a cage, they put you in a box, you puff you, you are accustomed to living larger than life. Right. And now they got you on a little ass box my nigga. Do you know the mental anguish that he going through? Yeah, I do think that's a strategy though. You Get what I'm saying? Like that's some shit. My, that's why we not giving you no, he not fighting The case from home. Want the speedy trial. Yeah. Oh yes, yes. I think that his, his team may feel like they don't have nothing and they're not gonna get nothing. Oh that part you'll take me to court while you don't have nothing. So we can get this over with So you won't Okay, got it. I see what you're, Yeah. 'cause the burden of proof is on the prosecution.


And if you got a a real good, supposed to be my nigga, they said that thug and them was done. They did, they said them niggas is done supposedly from the evidence that they had with thug and them, they was done safe fits they home. So, You know what I mean? Like, I don't know. Yeah. I think certain lawyers know like, damn this is, this is damaging. And then I think other, some lawyers be like, man, this shit ain't nothing While we're on all this criminality shit. They added new charges to Luigi and the federal, Federal Charges one one of those charges carry the death penalty. So now the death penalty's on the table for Luigi.


Yeah. New York has a death penalty. A federal grand jury. The Death penalty was, Yeah, go ahead. A federal grand jury in New York on Thursday returned a four count indictment against alleged CEO killer Luigi man that charges him with two counts of stalking firearms, offense and murder through the use of a firearm. A charge that makes him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Ladies and gentlemen, I I do think they, again, I don't think that he did this. I've said this before. Me Me either.


And I also think that it's in their best interest to try to offer him. Yeah. You don't think that Luigi innocent? I Don't think he, I don't think he was the gunman. I don't think he was the trigger Man. You don't think he was the person under the mask that pulled the trigger on this dude that they have on camera? Me neither. I'm skeptical too. Skeptical is different from Yeah. Oh Shit. Skepticism is cool. That's different from I believe him to be innocent. Yeah. I believe, which is what y'all are saying. I believe that why They don't believe he's the man. They don't, they Believe, I know. I'm asking Why they, why it's a few things. They talked about how his hotel to where my man got shot at, they have him on camera leaving his hotel at X time and they said that he would've there in there had to be an Olympic biker to get to where the murder took place and the amount of time between him leaving the hotel and the time of the shooting.


Right. So not just that he would've had to have gotten there, set up, got the right time, got the right angle. It ain't like he jumped off the bike was like ba b ba B bow, you get what I'm saying? My man walked by. They showed him being in the cut, walking by, which means he might have been set up there for a half an hour, an hour waiting for this man to walk down that street. I also think it took intimate knowledge to even know that he was going to walk this way down the street as opposed to this way. We, we talking about Manhattan. He could have came from the left. He could have came from the right, he came behind this man knowing that he was coming down this particular street and shot him in the back of the head or shot him in the back. I think all of that shit was calculated. I also think that you not smart enough to go from the kill scene.


You beat the New York City cameras, which is not easy to do. You got to Central Park. You, you, you Well he didn't beat the New York City cameras Because they saw him going to the Bus. 'cause we have, the footage that they have is from New York. I'm talking about after the shooting. Right. He got to Central Park, disposed of whatever he disposed of. But you gonna be dumb enough to have all his shit in your book bag in Pennsylvania. A a letter. Didn't he have the manifesto? I think he might have had on the same clothes. He might have. I don that shit. Like all of that shit to me Don't add up. You didn't take all of these necessary precautions to just be that fucking plumb dumb in another state when you could have got went and bought some new clothes that just sound like a plant. It just sound like some bullshit to me.


I I I just think it sounds like bullshit and I'm open to being wrong. I could be wrong though, but I, I, I question shit this and we watch too much shit and we've seen too many movies and too many documentaries and all of that shit where some of the shit don't tie in. I also talk about this. So you don't believe the manifesto stuff? Yeah, I I don't believe that. So wait, so you believe that Luigi had a plan to kill him? He he's just not the one to execute It. I don't know if he had nothing to do with that period. Holy Shit. I don't know. I'm not saying that I I could be wrong. I'm just saying I don't know. What I also believe is, if you gonna give him, I also don't agree with him getting the death penalty.


Mm. It's a lot of motherfuckers that get killed every single day and y'all don't give the motherfuckers the death penalty when they kill no black People. Attorney General Pam Bondy has already signaled her intention to pursue the death penalty in the case. Yeah. And his lawyers are actively trying to stop. Bondy said in a press release earlier this month that she ordered the death penalty for Mangione to carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and make America safe again With Pam, with pa Pam Pam or Pat Pam Bondy. Yeah. Have the same exact sentiment about somebody that just got killed in the Bronx. Would she have the same sentiment about a black kid getting killed in Queens? No. Nope. Nope. And so that's my point. So you can't say that this white CEO's life is worth more than another life of some young, small black kid.


Get the fuck outta my face. Yes you can. No You can't. You can 100% say that. No you can't. Yes, you can say that. I Agree with you. I disagree with you. You can say that. We can agree. You Can say that. I know we not, we not No, I'm saying we can agree to disagree. I don't Believe Saying it don't mean you can say it. We not disagree. You could say that like One man's Life is not worth, worth somebody else's life. Think That, believe that. I don't know what the murder of homeboy did, but we talking billions and trillions of dollars. Now I can imagine there's some people in high places that don't want him around or that's very Luigi To me that's very different than black and brown kids being murdered in the Bronx.


That these weirdos that run this place don't really give a fuck About. I know that's the, that's the point I'm making though. So his lawyer said that. So, but you Rec Well if you're making that point, that means you identify the difference. No, there's a difference. But when it comes to humanity, I'm not talking about the value in life, agrees what I'm talking. But if you recognize the point, then you see the difference. That Point pla that point plays into my point too. Tell me how, because He was the CEO of whatever company he was, the CEO of somebody else might not have wanted him around. Repeat that for me. Somebody else might not have wanted, we've seen Enough shit. They gotta get this CEO, they wanna remove him for whatever reason. So we'll set a plan in action. Wasn't he going to kick him out?


Wasn't he going to appear before Congress or something in the next couple days? I read something like that, but I haven't fact checked. So who do y'all think did it? I think somebody higher up, someone powerful Did it? Yeah, I agree. That's what I think. And got away. Yeah. Yeah. They staged it to look the way They looked and they just picked The kid they got. They got they. So why has he not saying that? Like there's been plenty times cameras been on him. Why has he, when they was moving outside, he said yeah, he Up music. He saying yo, His lawyers might have told him, don't say a fucking word. This is like, that is part of He spoke outside when they were re when they were transferring him, he was yelling outside to the cameras. I know, but that was, and Once did he say I'm innocent was that was probably prior to him having a lawyer.


They can make you say you, you did It. Wait. And I think one time he did say I'm innocent And I think they shut him up in the very beginning. He said I'm innocent. Yeah, He did say I'm innocent One, one time if my, if my memory serves me correct. Y'all Google it yourself. I think he started talking when First got outta the car. I think he said I'm, or no, no, not innocent. Sorry, not guilty. Two different Things. So apparently that Vodi chick, she made the statements before the federal charges were actually levied. So that is what his defense attorney is filing her motion based off saying that it improperly prejudiced the grand jury process. And she's asked the judge to pre preclude the government from seeking the death, death penalty. And she's also demanded that the government turn over documents and notes that relate to the attorney general's di directive.


It's just big money, big time games that, you know, they're way above our understanding and our pay grade. But bro, anytime I hear A-A-C-E-O or something like that, I, I question. Sorry. That's just where we are. I question that shit and I, I wouldn't be shocked. Alright. I don't have anything else in Pod. Pod and law and order. Pod. Pod order. Pod and order. Yeah. I don't have anything else. Pod that was all I had Thought some prayers. Thought some prayers too. Everybody, everybody involved like homeboy got a family. The the, the deceased has a family.


Like all of those people. Definitely Mr. Trying times. Yo did, did you guys see what's the kid that got killed in Texas? Carmelo Anthony's parents were doing a press conference and the father of the, the victim showed up to the press conference and he was just standing there. And then the lawyer stated how the father being here is disrespectful to his son's death because we, Carmelo Anthony's family have not gave their opinion on their son's death. On his escort him. Yeah, they had, yeah, the police came, they escort him out. Well, I don't think he left though. No, he, he made a s that Oh yeah, he was standing there though.


Right in the middle press conference, nigga with some shit on his hand like a sling. That's what it called. Oh niggas. Yeah. Just looking crazy. I I don't think that's crazy. Would you do that? Maybe I might not have it resolve to do that, but yeah, that's like some type of Hands. Right. And I'm not saying that to take away from anybody, but it's like a intimidating technique. I'm just asking. Oh Nigga, why you, we are doing a press conference. I want hear what you have to say. Yeah. Nigga, nigga watch on Tv on you watch it on tv. I don't wanna watch it on tv. You want to go? I want, you want to? No, I just want you to see me. Why you See that? Did he, did he start acting irate before they started pulling him out or No, he Was saying Before, before they, they had to remove him.


He swept at the conference. Gotcha. That's something like he was just, he was standing in the middle. Nigga, the conference is right there. That's y'all two nigga. He's standing right here where Mel is at. Just look at You. Not you, not even, you don't even have the capacity to be here right now. That's what the, your, your child just was murdered. Now you, you don't have, you don't have that where though to stand here and look at the killer or who you perceive to be the killer. Give a speech. I don know. Take your ass on. Evidently He did. Now if he started being irate in the middle of the press conference, that's something different. Yeah. Remove. But if he sat there quietly that says Frank, well they're Saying that the two brothers jumped guy. So now You get what I'm saying? Boy. Yeah, no, ed said that a few, a few weeks ago that the brothers jumped him.


Again, I'm waiting for facts to Actual Facts. I'm not saying nothing because it's a lot going on. It is a lot of It. Simple keep coming out, spread misinformation. Sure. Thousand percent. But Yeah, I don, I don't think Some shit like that too. They trying to slam Carmelo Anthony, I've seen this story floating around about the crib that they staying in now and how they trending the GoFundMe money. No, They and, and and the and the mom debunked that. She said they cut cap. Yeah. We haven't received one red cent from that GoFundMe. You know what I mean? And she talked about her 13-year-old daughter being scared and stuff. I mean she, it It Is, It is, It is. And they live in a million dollar home. They, it's Gotta make us be a fucking Yeah.


Charity case. A charity case. Like we all just bum niggas like, you know what I'm saying? Like yo, we just all bum niggas or if we got some money we had to get it through some nefarious means gotten means like get the fuck outta my face. Yo. I do, I do, I do see the stories running around like people that's commenting on this saying that if he came from a good home or a home that wasn't improvised, like what went wrong. Like they're saying that there's some people saying that that's what they're saying. Like there's some people saying that we are because we're black, we're highlighting Carmelo Anthony and not looking at the victim. Some black people saying that you should see the shit. It's a whole group of them. But I think how they broke the story initially is what has the people pushing back, 'cause they broke the story initially. Like he was just on some terroristic bullshit stabbing up people.


And and then now as they release information, that's not the case man white. And it's so easy for white people to understand that we just some violent animals my nigga running around fucking with people and that's not always the case. White people be not all 'cause that just sounds bad of course. But in these circumstances we be talking about white people be outta place and outta pocket. It wasn't them brother's place to tell him he couldn't sit there. That wasn't their place. Like there's a step past. Too familiar. Too Familiar. No, the Karen, a lot of that Karen shit. Right. You I've seen the Karen shit where the lady be won't let a dude in the building. You can't come in this building. What? I don't know. You, you can't come here. Do you live here? YI live here.


What floor you live on? None of your fucking business. Yo. We see one with a lady. We Seen the video going viral not too long ago where the black dude and his kid was just walking in the neighborhood and the white lady came and said, you don't live here. That's not your house. What are you doing Here? Not your House. That's not your place. George Zimmerman. That's not your place. Yeah. Even home, even homeboy. What's Steven Jackson? Man that died when the cop put his sharp Derek strongman. That's not your place. It is not your place. George Floyd. George Floyd Died. It is not your place to put your knee. You a cop. You can't put your knee on somebody, arrest him And do your fucking job. You sit White people be outta place sometimes. And this is one of, of those examples I told you the one lot of this shit could be avoided by money and fucking business or bro, that simple.


The one I'm talking about, a lady wouldn't let the dude it in the building. She sat him at the, in the lobby. He's like, ma'am, could you, I just came from the gym, I'm sweaty. Could you get out the front of the door? So then he had to f she was like, don't touch me. He's like, ma'am, I'm asking you. He moved out the way she followed this nigga to his fucking apartment, he pulled out the key and was like, now how the fuck you feel? She was like, no, I'm saying I just didn't know. Started damn near trying to give him some pussy. And it was crazy. My nigga, she sat there nigga at the door talking like, you don't live here. Yes I do prove it. I don't have to prove shit to you. Who the fuck makes y'all the authority on regular people? Get the fuck outta my face, mind your fucking business. Fuck outta here. You know what I'm saying? And they take that shit to another level and it's passed down some of it to I'm the authoritative figure.


You gotta answer my questions. No I don't. Yeah. Do y'all care about the Drake UMG stuff? I I read it. I went through What's the newest update? A lot of, a lot of amendment to the complaint. And I went through, it was like 180 something pages. I read a lot of it. Oh wow. I did see they, they quoted, quoted Joe, Joe Us. Really? No they didn't. Probably JBP? No, no. They quoted Joe Button. They quoted Joe Biden. Do you happen to know what that quote was? JAB from the JBP though. JAB with all of us. That was the episode. All of us was in y'all. Oh, so now we're all your Cody's and this one too. But we ate Oh But Cody's and this one too, too.


It was mostly in regards to the Super Bowl performance, right? The amendments? No, no, not all of it. They, they, a lot of it they, they took out some of the biding stuff. Okay. The claim of biding. 'cause everyone's doing that. Yeah. The part that really stands out to me and I'm, I'm just curious. So they used Joe's quote of admitting it like Yeah, I know Kendrick used bots. Yeah, right. That's where it gets tricky. 'cause if you're using this and you're saying that that was a factual statement that he made on the show. Yeah. So are you saying everything on the show is a factual statement?


It's not. No, but because you yourself on Taylor made as Pac says, talk about 'em liking young girls. I heard it on the Joe button podcast. It's gotta be true. And that's your whole claim is, hey what was said? I mean these claims about me are not true. So if you, you get what I'm saying? You can't have it both ways is what you're saying. Yeah. Like I just read that and I'm like, well dog is is what's said true or not. Drake hate, I hate to refer to the tag you but I was just talking, hey, I was just talking shit big dog.


I'm just getting some engagement going. Hey not nobody on Universal done text me, called me, paid me, they didn't gimme the scoop. I up here running my mouth. Man they got, hey it ain't no deeper than that. Drake. All the reaction videos, tweets like they, they have all of this shit In. I'm with you. I think that bots was in play. But for me to say that factually can't, I'm sorry buddy but subpoena me Shit. I think bots have been in play. I love nothing more than to come up to court, show my, show my face, see what's going on. Had that shit on.


Oh What, what in that case though. And have the scoop first. Yeah, it'll be me and Meg iff whatever her name is. Me and my girl. Let me take the stand. This nigga stupid. See what up there Act the ass on that stand. Oh that's, and then UMG replied and said, hey discovery works both ways so be careful, threatening. And then Drake's lawyers replied and said, nigga shut the fuck up. Suck my dick. Yeah, we don't give a fuck what you talking about Juicy Tyree. I was just gonna say, you gonna go over this shit bro. Do I think he's gonna win? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think he is. But what do I know is rumors.


Rumors going around about settlements and Like if he, if he settles, he wins. Not necessarily crazy as half. They get that nigga some money in a settlement. He wins. What Did he win? But some money. Money or if my, I mean well yeah he could because what you doing now? What? Suing him for money. My goal, my goal could be to get out this shit. I think the money's the secondary thing. My independence. That can be my goal. Yeah. I'm not disagreeing with that. And if I, if I negotiate that using all of this, then yeah he wins. It ain't necessarily gotta be the money. It could be, I wanna get the fuck away from y'all. I don't know what his objective is with my status of who I am. I don't know what his end game is.


His End game, the number floating at the settlement number that's floating around is 200 to two 50 50 million. Right. And I think he turned it down. Right. I don't, I don't know. We just speculated. Well I don't know Shit. I don't know about no settlements. I don't know nothing. Yo, I'm tired of shit. Do not listen to me as it pertains to any of this lawsuit shit. Legal shit. I just think it's fun to fucking kick the shit about at work. Yeah man, For sure. When you end up in there, when if he ends up in there he could say refer to the tag in the front. Yeah, but let me say it on the stand. Subpoena me that nigga Joe. I don't know how you, that shit on wear that Balenciaga. Put that pull Up. Pull up.

When he would talk to me as big as what I was everywhere else, I just wanted to be like big in front of him and I was done. Nothing is making me feel connected to him. The name change, the hat. The hat, the name change, those are coping mechanisms. Majority of men of his era where he grew up at. He didn't know how to express the love for you the same way my dad did. It is not about the hat. It is not about here what you are believing about yourself. You are phenomenal what you've accomplished with all you dealing with inside.

A you got 7 million songs in your phone. Right? I got that in my phone too. All right, so which means if you didn't hear yo, it's the RA double P-E-R-N-O-Y. You purposely went out your way not to go listen to the mob deep infamous album.


That's not true. It is what I'm telling you. Alright. You don't have to go out. Where was that? Where am I? Where the in Mob deep infamous album is played? Like that answer that question for me. Joe Biden birthday Party No Ice was in the house listening to hip hop. So no, that whole entire Mob Deep album ain't gonna be nowhere being played. But neither is Mia X and neither is Wait. It is my go. Neither is Fiend and neither is all these other albums that you sold frequently. Listen to all that other weird shit. You made an attempt to go listen to me a ex, if you made nothing to me, to not listen to my beef. And if you listen to me like I've been trying to explain to you they didn't play me an X on the box. I had the box. We all out The box. I made that shit though. You the only one with The box man let him.


I'm letting, nah, it's he got A headache in Y Niggas fucking My, It is not even that. It's not even that again. I told you that sound did not resonate with me. I liked a bop. I like a bounce. So when I heard the West Coast shit, the down south shit, it had that and then It is like, oh shit, let me hear more of that. I'm not going outta my way. There's records that come out I hear from certain act I don't like it. I'm not rushing to go listen to more to see if y'all got some shit in your library that I do like the shit I hear. Okay. I don't like this sound. That's what I'm telling you. But y'all take that as he's trying to be a contrarian. He's trying to be different. No I'm not. I am listening to what resonates with me. I'm listening to what sounds good to me.


Unfortunately It is not the same thing. That sounds good to you. True. That's it. So why So that's literally it though. You don't, I'm agreeing with you. So why when we say yo, this is what we like. Is it a New York bias as opposed to our personal preference? Because y'all are Why you don't look at it like our personal preference. It's always your personal preference. But the difference is y'all are quick to shit on everything that's outside of this. Well not everything, but nobody See I'm, Lemme fix my words. You always with I'm not talking to you. Are You always? I'm always with him. I hate him. Yo, I'm talking to Can we have a wove one real quick? Oh, a thousand percent. But It started with a must all Well we having one now. We having one now We all, I will have a one V one afterwards. My point is He handle the weaker nigga first.


He might not be finished for you. He handle, he getting a weak nigga out the way first. Hey I'm here. Hey, hey. I'm the super I I'm the Super Mario cast nigga. It is. It is Bias one. It is preference S not bias. One is your preference. Don't Dismiss someone's think thinking Differently To I don't dismiss the mob. I don't dismiss that I said was I didn't listen to it and that posse cut conversation. We didn't dismiss no West Coast. Shit. I Love it. We actually brought up West Coast shit and said it should have been bought in there. I brought Up Stay Fly, We brought up other shit from other, from other places and said it should have been in there. And then once I brought up some songs It is all, I don't want to hear that shit. Shit. But I think that's part of Ice positioning himself to be different.


It is painting our position to be a certain way. No Y'all, I you think I'm the only person that say That I don, I don't think nobody has a beef with you being different. Like you keep painting it out Beef. I I think people only highlight that. The fact that you point out Yeah. How different you are and what those differences are. No, But I don, I'm speaking all this shit that I listen to. Yeah, he don't do that. I think that I don't go out my way to say, oh I don't listen to what y'all like I like this when it comes to me. I say yo, well this is what I like and the second I do It is yo, but you from here. How do you not like this? I'm telling you how because that shit ain't sound good to me. That's it.


I Can See that. You know what It is. You know what It is. They can't see, I guess as a person who is so who knows music and people look to for music and, and your music takes, sometimes when you take a certain stance it comes off away. But, but my thing is even that the Afrobeat shit, it comes off away. Even that we don't fuck with your stance. Nigga don't want you to fuck with my, we trying to. We tired. We tired. We ain't codling this nigga out. Ain't Coddling nothing. We don't fuck with your stairs. Don't fuck with it though. We hate your stance on shit. Good. Not, not enough sugar baby in this ain't no sugar Bigger. My stairs don't require validation. That shit don't listen to it. It's my stink and I'm comfortable with it. I look to you for music.


Niggas that mistake and I say that all the time. It's not a mistake. Not trying to be funny. Stop being good at music nigga. No, but look, not trying to be funny from stop Remembering shit. No my nigga, I I'm not, people be like, yo, you are the music historian. You're this, you're that. Y'all putting these titles on me. I'm constantly telling y'all I'm a fan of this shit. I like what I like and I don't like what I don't like. You do have like an encyclopedia kind of memory though when it comes To music. Like You Right. Memories The fuck is wrong with you talking about My s that It's true. That's that's true. Yeah, that's true. Dead. You gonna fuck me. No I'm not man. I don't feel good. You got It. I could see, I can see Y'all got Me today. I could see how you could not listen to an album on purpose 'cause you have no interest in the artist.


And then it would like, then you would not know. Be aware of it. Nigga We call out shit 1997 Now listen, y'all don't even do that back in Queens. It's artists that I am not a fan. Like y'all know I came in here at your crib and and said what? I said I didn't fuck with that Griselda sound at all. And they killed me for that. How you, I mean how you like hip hop and don't fuck with Griselda. It is very easy. But at the same time when something comes out that's dope, that, that I think is dope. Whether it be from them or not, I'm like, oh shit. West Side guns. That's nice. You got it. Hitler wears Hermez eight. The the second one was, that was a fire joint to me or Pray for Paris was firing me. Like I don't, I don't do that just because it's the artist.


I'm not gonna listen. If some shit is dope, it makes it way to me. I'll listen to it. You didn't. No, I'm not doing what y'all saying bro. You, I'm not know Mob Deep. Just allow people to like they shit. Oh Shit. I said what'd Your name out? I said you didn't like Mob D. Oh we, It is not that Didn didn't like Mob Deep. I just don't like the sound. I like the commercial singles that I've heard from Mob Deep. When they play infamous, I know three songs off infamous. When I say that, that's blasphemy to people. I never said infamous was bad. He go and say Yo, you hate Mob Deep though. No I never said that. Is that what I said? Yes, you bring that. Oh you hate infamous, that's what you brought up. You hate infamous on No infamous. And I got don't no infamous that.
