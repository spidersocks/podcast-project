We were talking about, I don't, I wasn't even here for the talk. We talking about pod wives. Is Ian's wife on the network? Technically she is because Pod wives the show New episode out now. Huh? Huh? Analytics. Huh? Run it up Analytics lot of ladies.


Huh? Ian's wife is technically on the network and they, they found, they found her doppelganger on the Dave Chappelle show many, many, many years ago on that. What skit was that? Who? Who knows black people. Who knows black people. That lady looks exactly like Ian's wife. I even told my girl, I was like, look, they found somebody look exactly like Jules I just texted to you. It is her. It is just whatever. From what I haven't seen it. The consensus of the crew is that It is her. I would've never said that. I don't think that that logistically could be Julia because that was shot 20 years ago and that would've made Julia what, 12 at the time Around there.


I was saying something like that, like Jules is, I don't even know how old Jules is, but I figured she was 13 when that skit came out. Pretty much. I've not seen the skit. I'm telling you what I've seen the skit everybody said And then Ian confirms. I don't know if Ian is playing though, because Ian plays a lot. Yeah. He'll play into something. Yeah. He'll lean into some shit. Yeah. Like I can never really tell what him, Ian is saying that that was Julia, his wife and because they married, I can't really get my jokes off the way I would like because when you marry your girl then the jokes are off limits. Pretty much. Even though when you with your girl long enough, I think the jokes are kind of off limits.


Oh Wait, no Y'all think that? Yeah. Oh You don't? No y'all don't. Y'all crack a lot of jokes up here about niggas and they girls. Y'all don't think that. I don't. I think that okay.

That was the one you might have missed the Friday games, the, the celebrity game. The work used to be the Rising Stars Challenge, all of that shit. Yeah. But Saturday night you was locked in. You was in the house. I didn't give a fuck about none Of this shit. Yeah. I was in the house and didn't turn it on. So Sunday I'm home because It is Sunday and I'm home. So, you know what? I cut on the tv. I cut on the TV and we was about getting ready to bust a move somewhere around nine. But I watch up until I leave. And what a cluster. Fuck. Yeah. What a cluster fuck.

Eddie Murphy was on, everybody was on. He's a fucking genius. Everybody from the whole fucking history of the cast pretty much was on. And they did like a music thing on Friday night, which we went back and watched. That was also actually pretty fire. That that was way better than the Allstar game. You know who I don't wanna see on a Sunday, which is reserved for All Stars, all Star Sunday know the one person. I don't want to see Dalton Connect.


Yo, I tweeted. I said, oh shit. They moved the Rising Stars game to Sunday. They Modified the whole Yeah. Some tournament shit. They modified everything. And somehow Dalton's Connect was on an all star floor. And I like him, but him and all them other bum niggas that they had out there, that they had, that they had to face the OG Squad, which is James Harden, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry. It is like, yo, what are y'all trying to do to us on a Sunday? Yeah. Right. And they tried to make it close a little bit. Once I saw the tournament layout shit, I was like, I'm not definitely not watching this. I'm not, I'm not even looking forward. Absolutely. And, and if the tournament layout wasn't bad enough, listen, I love Kevin Hart as much as the next man.


I know he had some type of deal with the NBA. It's over now. I don't wanna see Kevin Hart. And some of that shit was a little funny just because I wasn't watching basketball. Fuck. Might as well make crack couple jokes. I don't want to hear Kevin Hart that much on a Sunday. Kev, no disrespect to you. And if that wasn't enough right after the first game or something like that, Mr. Beast comes out. Hmm. Why the fuck am I looking at Mr. Beef, Mr. Beast? Whoa, you watch, which channel were You watching? Yo, I don't want to look at Mr.


Beast on all, all Star Sunday. So now I'm sitting there like, oh, shit, I never noticed. Mr. Beef doesn't have lips. I'm saying, Mr. Beast, man, Mr. Beef, come on. Mr. Beast doesn't have lips. He looked like the skull teeth just talking like, I don't know where he got his veneers or whatever the fuck is going on with his mouth. But it looks weird. And if that wasn't bad enough, Mr. Beast walks to the crowd and gets Jaron. Who? What's Jaron? Not from Jaron. Oh, Jaron. Oh, he says, all right, we're doing some three point shit. We're gonna grab a random fan from the audience. He'll have to make one shot versus Dame Lillard, who will have to make three shots to his one.


He goes to the audience grabs Jaren. Jaren comes out, they ask him, Hey, you ever played basketball? Yeah, a little bit. When I was a kid, he still looked like a kid. So I'm like, all right, let's see how this goes. He goes out there and does what? You guessed it. Bricks it up. Bricks it up. We gotta wait 13 minutes now for Jaron to make a fucking shot on a Sunday. Yeah, that's crazy. It was bad. And if that wasn't bad enough during the next break, who do they roll out? You guessed it. Another nigga. I can't, lemme not say that. DJ Cassidy, You're so angry about this.

Put man pH slimmed germs. And Ish took it for the team too. Like a soldier did it. Did he sat there, just got spit on by some nigga. He talking about some ice right there. Spit that way. No. Hey, a three hour episode. Cas tj Cassie spit all over it, but took it for the team. I don't know why these company, I'm saying this respectfully. I don't know why these companies and corporations feel like the best way to present our black legends is to with DJ Cassidy.


I'm cool. Just seeing too short. Yo, too short. Gonna come out and gimme Blow the whistle. I don't need DJ Cassidy funny hat. Wearing ass in the back. Doing some 3, 5, 7. Get loose Stetsasonic fucking choreograph day. I don't need to see it. I don't need to see it. Just gimme E 40. Yo, I feel That. Just gimme, tell me when to go. I don't care if y'all quiet. That's how I feel to say I wasn't mad at it. 'cause he also bought Sweetie out. So, all right. I'm cool Now. Oh shit. That's the other thing he found, sweetie. So I was cool at that point. How'd she look? Beautiful. Oh, here come Parks again. Here come. I was cool at that Point.


Y'all love y'all love that sweetie. Yes. And everywhere she show up, she do look good. So let me, let, let me not try to sound like she don't look good. I forgot you wrapped. Me too. I didn't know she ever did. Wow. I said, oh Shit. She did do the little blow the whistle. Play all tap in. Hey, Guess what? I don't wanna see on All Star Sunday. Who Just there Guess Sweetie, sweetie. Who he brought out after that? Wait, who was after Sweetie? In Vogue? In Vogue. Now I wasn't mad. I didn Vogue. I love in Vogue. I was not mad at, in Vogue. Well, I You didn't like in Vogue, you know what the Bay Area got? I love Envogue. They got a lot more legends than, than, than the world gives them credit for.


That's true. They, they contributed way more to music than the rest of the world would like to recognize. That's a fact. Now, when In Vogue came out, I absolutely loved that. I couldn't figure out if Dawn was there. 'cause I don't know if Dawn was there. I don't know if the taller, attractive woman that was all the way to the right. Was Dawn now that she's aged a little bit or did they replace Dawn? I know there was the Dawn Envo. I'm old enough to know there was a little beef for a little minute. So I don't know if Dawn was there. She was, she made it happen. Was that Dawn? Yeah. Oh, then. Awesome. Awesome. They got all of 'em back in the same room. I was happy about in Vogue. I was happy about Envogue. Nice, nice.


Okay Nigga, if you could be happy about Sweetie, I could be happy about Oh No, for sure. For sure. For sure. They ain't had a dress on. I'd like in Vogue's music. I know, me too. Ooh, what the Fuck that was that? What the hell was that? That Remember she held a long note in the beginning of the first joint. Hold on. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was my imitation of that. Did they have the dress? I can't do it now. I can't do it. Yeah, they, they looked great. They looked great. Shot Vogue who went, it Was a lot of Bullshit. It was a lot going on On that Sunday All Star weekend. Then the first time out of the game, I do like the inside the NBA tribute that they did. That was fire. But that was fire.


That was the best part of everything I saw. I Didn't wanna see them niggas no more neither. Nah, nah. You, you gotta do it. Right. And that I just, it was the first time out of the game and that shit took like 15 minutes, bro. It was long. But pause it. I think that was the best part of everything that I saw from the whole weekend. They went through Craig, they went through Charles, they went through all these niggas when they was young. Like that shit was fired. All the people that we lost. You know what I'm saying? So I think that was dope. I think they went out 'cause that's their last Allstar game. Yeah. It's the last Allstar. So I think that was fly. I just hate that the Best. Like you just said, like the best part of the Allstar weekend Wasn't the Allstar Star. Yeah, You right. Yeah. That was the best thing I Saw. And it's like, it used to be a thing, like it used to be an actual good game. All.


I used to be excited to actually watch the players play and instead of like making the players just play, you know what I mean? They do all these other tricks. But what drafting players and doing The players, what happened? No. Nah. Wasn't that To me. Raise the amount. Go ahead. What happened? It was so lopsided after a while where the west was just so stacked. They had the, it it, it took the excitement out the game. You knew the west was gonna win. So they tried to change it up with the draft. So now you mixing a player pool up where you not getting everybody on the same squad and, And it's like, that's stupid. Like to me, yeah, she's us. What you do is to me, you, you make a, a big enough cash reward because players make too much money to care about the All Star game. They, they got too much at stake. You trying to win a championship, you're not worried about it, but you put real money on there.


If every player won even a million dollars. Right. If every single player won a million dollars, I think players will play a lot harder to win. I'm talking about to win. Huh? I agree with that. Yeah. But then, but then what happens is you're risking getting injured for a a, a exhibition game. Now we can't, you know what I'm saying? So they kind of don't wanna play hard. They just make too much money that they don't really don't even give a fuck. I'm gonna keep it a buck. That's or so it seems, I just remember I said they need to do, I said many years ago that they need to do what baseball did and the winner of the Allstar game gets home court advantaged during the Finals. That would also make people play hard. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Unless you won the 10 bum teams ain't got no shot at the finals anyway. But like, there's enough players like for the Knicks for example.


That's a good example. Y'all got two guys on there. Y'all have a legitimate shot at the cha at at going to the finals. So, so Kat and Jalen gonna play hard, You know what I mean? LeBron's gonna play hard. That would be fun if he had played be like, I think, I think it's a great idea. See That ain't, that ain't a bad idea. You gotta incentivize it in some way, shape, or form for them to even want to play. There was Barely any basketball played. They showed us players aggravated, frustrated from all the TV production. Shit. You gotta taking 20 and 30 minute breaks and then you want us to go out here and, and we can't, we don't, we Can't do cooled off. We've cooled off and then you risking injury. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Now what, what I did See that I think will help to change things is Victor Binna, He wanted to Play who not only wanted to play was visibly upset at other people not playing.


Yep. Yes. He's great enough and young enough to make a difference in this. What'd you Think about him And Chris Paul doing that shit? Trying To cheat the system skills challenge? That shit was, I liked it. I Did too. I liked it. That was Funny. I hated that shit. That's some Chris Paul fucking bullshit too. You know that Chris Paul came, Chris Paul said it was a Victor Idea. Yeah, I would say that too. If I Didn smell like Chris Paul, it Smelled Chris Paul. Man, come on man. Like just dude that got, you know the skills challenge the fans came to see a skills challenge not to watch you try to win by throwing shots, pretending to throw shots against the wall, throw The skills challenge in the garbage. Agreed That shit was Over that fly. And give us a one-on-one matchup with That's all I care about. Some of our best one-on-one players never have in in the NBA never Happening.


I would love because players don't wanna get cooked. They don't wanna get Exactly. They're not doing. That's it. I'm they're never doing that. But that's the answer. One on one is the one I I say get rid of slam dunk contest at this point. This shit is uninteresting. Nah, I think we seen all the dunks we can See. I think next year it'll be better. I don't why? Why? Because people like Zach Levine and them are talking about potentially coming back. Jack Levine is 78 years old man. Oh. And I saw what Ja Morant said. Ja, He Said that a couple years. Yo Mack McClung you inspiring me. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. That's inspiring. Not the NBA dropping you as the face of the league for the next 10 years. Right Bro. Mac McClung is getting you inspired. That's, That's how pot, that's how I potentially get some of that back. The dunk contest is done because dunks are done. The excitement is not on the focus of the dunk no more.


The League don't care about Dunk. Dunk. They don't care about dunks no more. Right. It's, It is not a highlight anymore. They don't give a fuck. Nah, I think, I think the dunk contest lost it luster when these niggas started doing corny shit. There's left to do Nah, some of these shit, bro. That's not true. If you watch some of these little street do some creative shit, yo, if you watch some of these street, its like, It's called props now. These Street dunking niggas, they killing. They be doing crazy shit. Shit, dude. That's true. Don's do that shit. So it's some shit that you can find to do. Drop the, drop the drop the hoop to it two feet. They're not gonna do that. I'm just saying like, you put it up two feet. Fuck that. Nah, that's a movie. 11 feet maybe that might get some, some interest. But yeah. And I heard them float an idea of the NBA versus the foreign players in the NBA That they don't want that either.


I don't lead Them internationally. That women, Yana Joker, Greek Freak. Luca Luca Shy. N mb Mb Well he he'll be injured. He ain't play, he he'll be injured. That's the only game He does play. Carly Anthony Towns would be on that team. That's a lot of Jokers, bro. Leave that alone. Yeah. He don't want, don't bark up that tree. That's gonna be a real watch awakening. For, for for the NB. It's a test. And, and, and, and listen, you don't even have to do that every year. Do it. Do it every other year. That would fix things. We would wanna See that because Shy was another one that took the game really seriously. He took it Seriously? Yeah, he took the game seriously. He wanted the MVP. That Nigga won the MV mvp. Yeah. He wanted, he, that nigga put the ball in the bucket, bro.


I don't give a fuck in the, he got moves that in the elevator. That nigga gets Oh, He a problem. He, he probably gonna go to MVP of the league this year. He might, I don't think he deserve it, but he probably get it. I think I still want yo Kish to get it. But the N NBA just ain't black enough no more. Nah, that's the other, that's the other elephant in the room. Right. It's not black enough. You think It's definitely not black American enough? Yeah, that's what I'm, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Victory with meme don't count. I want a nigga without parents. I want somebody who I'm serious. Single mom, single Mom struggle. Yes. From the trenches. But you can't do this. Whoever's in charge, whoever their Jesse Collins is that's in charge of producing this, you could tell It is not like us.


You could tell that. You know what, lemme not say that. 'cause lemme not just rush to to race in background. The NBA is an analytics driven lead now. Yeah. Yes. So you could See that they're applying that also to content creation. And they're leaning into that more so than curation. I agree. And the other thing is, It's not curated. That's a good way to put it properly. They're so international now, bro. Like China, all this other like the NBA don't it. America might not be the big market. It was. They're not necessarily gotta cater to what we wanna see. Nah, I I think it's a three day weekend. Right. Whereas most events, it's just one day. So now you gotta entertain the fans that are coming from across the country and all around the world for three or four consecutive days.


So you gotta come up with all these little bull. But the other leagues do that shit too. Not who baseball has the home run derby on the night before. They do. They do. Yeah. You know what I mean? The Pro Bowl is not, they do the they do they their little quarterback Pro bowl and all that. Pro Bowl is down in the drains too. It is down the, all that shit is trash. So you gotta whole, All that shit is trash. But you gotta entertain people. Thank God the fucking Canada and USA hockey teams got shit lit for me. They got too. Thank God that they went out there. Them brothers, whoever those brothers were niggas went out. They got shit where the one brother scrap ba 10 minutes later. The other BBB. Oh yeah. I'm watching this. Come watching this now. Yo. And that game that day played the next game Won't be a ratings problem at all. Won't be a ratings problem at all. That's what you need.


Bring Chris Childs back. Bring somebody back. That's just going to knock one of these niggas out real quick. Rest in peace. Kobe. I don't want to be, I was like, you ain't rest in peace. Kobe. You see what Chris Charles did the gold test. That 10 bow Yeah. With the two piece. We We'll watch that one. Hey, put Avante Tank Davis in the skills. In the skills contest. Call me Al Jesse calms this shit right back to where it need to be. But yeah, and you know, I know it's bad. I ain't been in a while. I don't even hear the Badies talking about going out to, was out to the city for the It was out there though. You got the call now? It's time out. I did. They baddies are in San Francisco.


They Period, the New York, they went out there. The whole, the Starlin was out there. I'm one batter than that now, but Okay. You 40 something. I'm taking your word for it. Yeah, I'm not looking for it. I wanna hear The chat. Yeah, no, they, they, They, I just want to go to the airport on a Friday headed somewhere else and See that San Francisco gate lined up with 'em. Oh my God. Oh my God. Those are the good old days. It was back in the day. Right. You Old nigga You could put a shot up or 2, 4, 3. All right. I'll take your word for it. Nah, they was out there. The baddies are there. Cool. My, My young boy called me and told me they was out there. Shit. They did Adam Silver.


I think you got a shit show on your hands. I think that there's some credence to the inside the NBA team only shitting on the product. There was a lot of that too during the All Star game. A lot of commentators just totally shitting on the product. Yeah, yeah. Right. There's something to that. He was letting him out. I mean, I like that he told the truth. He did. He did. That's why niggas that tell the truth don't be on tv. You gotta hype shit up. Your job is the commentator at those things is to make this interesting. I agree. Not make you wanna turn it off. I agree. Sorry. I think that's a bad job. I think you could have whatever personal feeling you have, but you're supposed to be selling the product. You working for the NBA at that level. I think you're supposed to try and jazz it up as much as possible.


I absolutely loved the Raphael Sadik performance. I loved the job that the band did. I loved all of those Bay Area classics and hits that they were playing. I saw them play. You can't touch this for about eight bars. I saw Gavin make a post about this as well. But where was mc Hammer? And that's what I mean about curation. That Wasn't my Question. Yeah, that's what I mean about curation. I thought he was Coming out during the Cassidy set. How could you not bring Mc Hammer out? What? He's the golden in San Francisco. The Allstar game. They might have pitched it. I'm sure they probably did. They might have pitched it. Yo, he Probably, I ain't sure about shit. Mc Mond would've showed up. Hammer would've been there. Maybe. Maybe not. Ham Would've been there. Ain't no, maybe not. Hammer would've been there that aliven it up. Put the fucking baggy sequence pants on. Nigga.


That definitely wouldn't, and think about this. The average goer wouldn't even have known who the fuck he was, bro. I don't care. I don't care. Any really knew when the song came On there song Ain't known the song though. 25. They known When the song came on. Oh, The kids don't know. My daughter met Mc Hammer was like, who the fuck is that? You think the average, you think the average Goer Newton Vogue. But that's what I'm saying is like Gen Z, there's like a resurgence with Gen Z. Really like kind of trying to figure out what was going on in the nineties and early two thousands. That's why they're all watching Sex in the city now. So I figure they would know the retro Shit. They would know the song too. They would know. Can't touch This. They might know Can't touch. They might know Can't touch this book. Yeah. Even if you just let 'em do a verse. Right. Too sure. It didn't do the whole blow the whistle. You just giving them a verse real quick.


Blow the whistle was never died. You wait. You can't touch this. Come on. Can't this, It is using commercials now. They still have can't touch this on tv. You know, can't touch this. And it's the Rick James. I mean like, they'll know the music. The music will resonate with them. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Shit. Fuck you can't touch this. Lemme do pumps in the bump and put the bikini on again and go out there like you did. Like you did the video. You gotta bring shorty from the Video. Video number one. Yo first one That we won. Hey, freak ass boy. What? Listen, Adam Sil, you got hell of a problem on your hands. But I'm not paid to fix it. So make, Keep it simple. Good luck. That'd be my advice. Good luck to you and the players. I feel your frustration. I just, I just, I feel for the mess. Simplify that shit.


Yo. Doing too much. How could I be alive long enough to wear the All Star weekend? Just don't Do it. I never would've thought that would happen. Money bro. NBA All Star weekend. It's money bro. Like the players used to look forward to it. I don't think the players look forward To it. I said it before I say it again. They don't. They don't. Right. Put Magic Johnson in the game again. The best All star game in the history of all Star games. Watching them niggas get away from him. Right. You think they don't play defense now? Hey, hey My guy Magic was posting up. That nigga Barkley said you got it Niggas. No, no. That was Carone. Carone said nah, just score.


He ran a zero five zone. Bring magic back. Bring Magic back. Yo, I come from the all star of Mike first. Kobe still. No, the Kobe AI one was the best one. That was a great all Star game. I was there in DC That shit was amazing. That was the best one I've been to like as far as the game them. But again, you talking about Kobe For a while. You went Yeah, he was there that For a long time. You talking about, you talking about Steph, you talking about ai? Them niggas was going at, they wanted to win. Yeah, they jumped the shit outta Kobe ai and Steph was all jumped the dog shit up. But yeah bro, people wanted to win. Now they don't give a fuck.


Yeah. It is just a different mentality in the league today. Too much money. Too much money. Ain't no dogs Too much Money. It is, bro. I don't think that's it. I think these guys are passionate, but man, whatever. That shit was a mess. Oh, the young niggas is passionate. Oh shit. Do you know Mark Lamont Hill that we have?

Shit is not dying down yet. Probably score up. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. I get that. But the, the sentiment is dog, y'all acting like y'all have never been here before. No People like, no, people like to, I they keep reminding everybody we are. We. But I don't know if they've ever been here before 92.


Yes they was. Yeah, they were, they were that chronic 92, 92 dog style run that early nineties. The early nineties. It was massive. But this is, I mean It is just a different era I guess. It's like compared to fucking basketball players from different, It's been so long. Like a lot of the Hip hop didn't have the platforms that it has now. There was no hiphop at the Super Bowl. It's a different, It is different shit. It's a different level. It's the same. Yeah. It's big in terms of hip hop, but it's bigger. Like being that hip hop is bigger, it's bigger. Yeah. Worldwide. Even Though when they say act like you been here before, I don't think that necessarily means that you had to have been there before. Right. No, You don't. That's not what the, I don't think that's what the phrase is about. Right. It's like have some class. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It just means you ain't gotta be on a act Like shit ain't, if shit is not new to you and that You Right.


Just fucking Yeah. But how they supposed to act. I mean, what what would that look like if you the west coast right there? Like How do you re how do you, how do you celebrate in a classy manner? Like I don't, I don't see what they've done that has been unclassy. I don and I'm like talk shit. That's what I'm saying. Run the score up. Fuck it. 'cause your moment gonna leave the record is still hot and the shit that's going on is still going on. It's being promoted on big platforms and bigger platforms and so It is not going anywhere. And they have a right to celebrate that. Yeah. Right. For a long time. It's like the east coast. We, we all hip hop and all that shit and we lend you guys the, the, the pass you guys the torch. Like it's so let them celebrate and have fun. They Did, did not let us at the SNL shit. Exactly. Old Ski with Will Ferrell.


Ferrell. That Shit was funny. Yeah. They're not stopping. That's what the problem is though. It's just New York. I don't even think it's Atlanta that much. It's just New York. I didn't wanna see Will Ferrell do that. That Shit was funny. I mean I got, I got that level chuckle. I had a chuckle. I just didn't wanna see him do that. It's at that level now. Where, where are we? Gatekeeper Ice. Yes, We are gatekeepers. Yes. Should New York feels like because we started here though, It is the, we the end all be, I've said this a million times. New York thinks that New York is the end all Beall when it comes to hip hop and that it hasn't grown past New York. I mean at one point point all the labels and stuff. I don That's dated thinking. I think so They're still here. Right? I mean the labels Are not off. The labels Are not still Here. At one point they were here. Oh, they were right. You had to come to New York to Yeah.


How they get signed. There's a lot of things that were happening. Even for your records to to, to that national point. Yes, you would be regional, but if you didn't make it in New York, it was almost like you didn't really count. Exactly. Yeah. Then That all changed. That Happened. So we had all that. We didn't have that cachet, but It's not that anymore. Yeah. Well and a lot of New Yorkers still hang they hat on that. Hmm. And a lot of people were like, Hey dog, we don't care about that old shit. That ain't, this ain't 10, 15, 20 years ago. Now we don't have to make it in New York. We don't need New York. We don't give a fuck about New York. It's only New York that keep yelling New York. That's young Money's doing young money. Did that, Did y'all have any thoughts on the Wayne performance from the SNL? Shit? Anybody see it? I saw it. It Was, it was dope. The stream that I watched, his mic was like not on, but they fixed it.


And the shit that's going around on the internet people said sounded, you sounded good. I wanna watch the whole didn. Didn't see it. Sounded good. Watch the whole Back. I'm, I like anytime a a a live band is behind a rapper with hits. Yeah. Yeah. Because the live band, they made it, they made it sound like Blue note. They killed It. They made it sound just like a contemporary version of like that unplugged. But was he, was He on point? Because I heard he was fire. Yeah, he was good. He said the sharpest I ever, I ever heard he was good. Gotcha. It is gonna make some people had him Super Bowl Already said, that's what I was doing. Yeah, They wrong. But I get why people would feel like that. I did have a chance to listen to the party album over the weekend. Me too, Me Too. I did. 'cause Friday it didn't really, you know, it hadn't really sat with me.


But I heard the album again. I found some, some cuts on there. I found some cuts on there that didn't hit me the first time. Girl just lied. She makes me cry. I can't be blamed for anything. I'm fine. I guess it's first time I you've Tried to ruin my life. But you can't though, by the way, the beep bank, John, fuck Grammys. Don't even call that bowl super while you round me. I thought it was good court documents are drafting, but I'm relaxing. And I know I told party I'm gonna give him a verse. But then I heard what he sent and said fuck features. Hey then I'm still great. Fuck that little man. Hey, Switch the beat on him. Valentine's Day sw for the boys play.


Don't you think that's a bit weird considering the album name? Man, Fuck that. I'm a rap out how my ex still hate on me. No way. That's an internal issue. It something I'm keep fla on. I had about 20 teams in the club and by away they appropriate age. That's a weird thing to have to clarify. Well, the go my way. So I'm breaking something that used to sing You. We sing together. I do like singing. Everybody likes Singing's. Mad funny. Fuck That girl that they was hanging with you. Don't I hate that girl because she hangs with my, I'm a name Bad girl, but my, that girl together because it's a Drake song. So at the end of the day, we're gonna hate on a girl.


Well, none of that was necessary. What in the Fuck that was not my version. I, I need that version. I need a deluxe. What the fuck, bro? Yo, that is hilarious. That shit hilarious. Hey, y'all didn't need the internet. Yo, you internet people did not need the internet. The world was fine when I didn't know how creative some of y'all were out there. Yeah. Yep. Holy shit. Mark, you wasn't here when we did the review. What did You think It was? Just what I thought it would be. A couple songs that I liked. A lot of stuff. Didn't feel like well developed concepts musically. I got bored early. The only I I, I like when he raps. So, you know, gimme a hug. I thought it was, you know, had some classic bars in it.


Ah, Interesting. The rest of it. Classic bars. Huh? Couple, couple of Legend legendary bars. Look, I just say no. But in general, I, if I, I were giving him Mike's, I'd give it three. I'd have give It three T-Pain said it sounded like just old records that they had. That's exactly what it sounds like always. That's exactly what it sounds like. Throwaway And demo. Half done shits the thing. Yeah. Finish. Yeah. And it's like that sound. I'm also tired of Drake sounding like I don't, I'm, I'm tired of that sound from him. And I don I don't love Drake as a, as a singer anyway. I like him when he raps. I love him when he raps. I don't like when he sings. But that sound of his, I I don't like it. It it's, it's, we were, we were actually listening to it, driving to Edgewater. So it, it was our 45 minute drive. We heard a lot of the album for the first time. And my wife was like, yo, I can't take any more of this.


It sounds like one long ass like painful emo song. And that's what it felt like to me. And I'm now gonna hold you. I'm, I'm glad you said that. Like, I saw a party made a post about, hey, this, this album wasn't for the deep dives. It's for niggas to fuck to, I want to let him know I don't wanna Fuck that. It ain't much on there that I'm fucking to. Yeah. Yeah. It ain't a whole lot on there. That that's the the bag. Yeah. For me. Think you Got Sentell with that too, that post? Yeah. Okay. Maybe It, it was a sentel maybe, but, but the principle Still shout the Sentel too. That's my man. I'm cool with getting Sentel. I like him. I like it When it's funny. Yeah. But, but yeah, but the sentiment is still the same though. A lot of people were saying that. Yeah, it's not.


Yeah. Who Not on this album? Who y'all fucking with? That's, yeah, forget it. What is all the hoopla with the fucking, what is it? Bots and suppressing and, oh, he lowered the price of the album. He better, that's what did it. Really? Yeah. Well streams are dropping every day. The streams are dropping and they dropped a hard code. Vern, the streams are dropping and they lowered the price of the album to like 4 99. Shit, I'm not putting that on Drake. Even though it does look away for Drake to be attached to something where you lower the price on the album. It is a technically a party album. Yeah, it's 7 9 9 on iTunes right now.


Yeah. But them numbers dropped every day. We were, I heard y'all talking about how many numbers he's gonna sell. Some people saying 1 50, 2 53, 54 50. It is looking like if he hits one 50, he'll be very lucky. I'm, I'm, I'm predicting I was predicting like one 10 and I'm, I'm not even sure he hits that now. My, my number was one 20 and he, now I'm just looking, we get a hundred maybe. Damn. But my number's one 20. I don't see it going nowhere near nowhere higher than that. If you just, I'm doubling down with that one. If you're Drake and you sell a hundred thousand records of this, how do you explain that? Do you just say this is a party album. You seen my album 1000%? You say It is a party album. You explain shit, it's a party album. It has Nothing to Explain. It has nothing to do with me. Wow. Right On purpose.


I wanna play this clip of La Reid talking about the mythical button that you hear talked about so much in the music industry. The red button. Yeah. Well that's Drake Shit. No, I'm playing, I'm playing Good. But long before that, I know there is the belief amongst industry people that there is a button that you press to get a artist popping. Like to get a artist lit. So La Reed was on, shout to La Reed Legend. He was on tank's. Po Shout out to Tank as well was on Tank's podcast and Jay Valentine and this is what he had to say about that mythical button. Oh, Got it. Singles. We put out a single Arista, our joint venture partners put out a single and it was doing okay.


So I went to Clive Davis And I said, Clive, like I need you to push the button on this thing, man. You know. He said, what's the button? I said, you know, like you did for Whitney Houston, like, need you to push the button. And we were at a conference when I said this to him, he said, the button, huh? He says, sit right here. I sat down beside him. Right. We at a conference in, in, I forgot where we were. I thought we were in Florida. I can't remember. Maybe Miami or something. Anyway, Whitney Houston comes on stage and Whitney Houston sings and he looks at me and he said, that's the button. That's The button. He said no.


He said, do they sound like that shit? I was like, oh, so what you telling me is my shit is not hot. Oh. Because I thought I really did think like, you know, record labels, they take talent, good, bad or indifferent and they push the button. Yeah. And the shit goes right. That's what I thought. So Clyde, push the button. This button that we've all heard about this button, it's a button. Right. Sit down right here, young man. Lemme teach you something. And then I saw it. I was like, oh, I completely disagree with that. I About say, I don't know if I, it's a great story, but There's a button.


La re's lying. It's Too much. Well, I'm glad that y'all all picked up on the fact that La Reid is lying, but on the playback, I heard it differently. I heard him say, we think It is a button that can be pressed good, bad, or indifferent. Yeah. That's the key part of that. And that was the important part there. So when he sits him down and says, Hey, look at Whitney Houston sing this song. It's like, yeah, anybody with ears can say you would press a button for that level of talent. Yes. Everybody thinks they're on at that level talent wise. And we all go up there saying, Hey, press the button. Press the button, press the button for the shit I just made in the basement last night.


It don't, it doesn't work like that. But I just thought this was a really nice way of getting outta that button conversation. But there is, I'm still, but there is a button though. Yeah. There's a lot of bullshit that get a button pushed. A prime example of the button. Tommy Richmond, Milli Mil. Milli Vanilli. Before all that. How is, You know what people say that Milli Vanilli sold records before that button was pressed. Yeah. And They made good music. It was a great ass album. It wasn't them singing that was a whoever, Whoever the person was. No, no, but that's what I'm talking about. The button is putting two people who were frauds to create a whole, That's the button we're talking. It's not the button. All right. It's the button. Still was good. Button is putting, putting the Power behind it. Yes. Yes. Tommy Richmond. Marketing Dollars.


Marketing Dollars Behind. Then after watching the Millie Vanilli doc, I don't think it's fair to call 'em frauds. Yeah, no. Because they were talented. It just wasn't the talent that they were showing us. It wasn't them singing in America. But that's what I mean. They were Dancers, they choreographers Duke Like everybody else. Yeah. But they were not. And they ung on their first album where they sold records over there Somewhere and they had a look. They had all of those things that went into the little Terrence Trent Darby was popping back then. They Had a look. But the singing that We Always, he know all that shit. It is, man. What So Terrence Trent, You guys know Terrance Trent Darby doesn't go by that name anymore. He's, well, He's Terrance Trent Darby, he's Terrance Trent Darby to us.


Mama name. I'm Clay. I'm gonna call him Word Ball. His name might be Joseph SZA. Now Name Terrance Trent Darby. What's his new Name? Sananda. All right, we done. You're done. Okay. You done. You name NDA Ma. That's Exactly why I didn't watch a movie this week. It goes by, that's why Didn Didn't watch your movie. Movie Out came Yes Noise Big man. I didn't watch it, so I don't have a Review yet. I, I'll have a review Friday. I'm watching it with my lady tonight. I'm watching it. So You gotta do that. It is when think gonna happen, champ. She's dressed in the movie.


Alright. So obvious everything's changed now. A lot of changes. I didn hear what you said though. I didn't say anything but Seriously. I'm gonna watch it too. I dvd. I just, I was traveling. Didn't have access to cable, but Okay. I, I wanna watch it. I appreciate you DVRing it. Thank You. Yeah. Dvd. I'm looking forward to watching tonight. Okay. Did you watch it? Yes. No, I mean, watch it. I know you were there for it. No, I, I watched it, I watched it with my girlfriend, Nicole. Okay. What'd you think? I, I really liked it actually. I was kind of surprised. I just, I was terrified what the editing was gonna look like, but I was, I was very happy with it. I was very happy with it. That's all. It matters. Yeah. All right. Do you want us to come back with our review like you did last time? I don't think I have a fucking choice.


Review away. We have a choice. We'll expect review away. Come on. Legend. If you say, don't come on Legend. I watch It, but I just won't say nothing. I'm just still say like You did the last time. Yeah. I'm Gonna still say something. Try to be It's fine. It's okay. No, please, please go ahead. The floor is, the floor will be yours when you guys see it and review it for me. Okay. Said Terrance Trent Darby. Change his name to what? Chaa It is a whole woman. Sananda Matria. Show Him. Show him. Look. Shout Out to Terrance Trent, Darby and Sananda everybody. And Milli Vanilli and Milli Vanilli. But, and watch that Milli Vanilli doc. It's one of, It is one of the better music docs. It's wonderful. It's great And sad.


It's super sad when you realize how they got exploited. Yeah. And you hear the real story. Like that dude in the South that was doing the background vocals for one of 'em. I, because I was Big Milli Vanilli. I love that album. Actually love that album. And when I found out the, the, The, all the, their first American album. Blame it on the radio. Yeah. Blame it on the Yeah. I loved every and everybody Actually, they didn't like that album. They sold a lot of records for a reason. That was slaps. It was slaps slap after slap. We was kids. Them. That's why I said like, I wouldn't say the button got pushed for them because the music was dope. Right. But there was, It is interesting to think about what it means for the industry to put so much energy behind making this a thing. I do. I don't think the button works. The button works. But it may not work these days. Meaning it does work on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Content creation that's taken over.


Soldier Boy, in the beginning of the ringtone days when he cranked that a button was a push behind that. Yes, it was. You don't think these contact creators? No, not initially. Not initially. Contact creators are under the button. No. Bobby Smu a song. A button wasn't initially pushed behind that. It happened after that when he Recorded it. I, I just want to inform you, 'cause you my man, you're conflating things. Please Explain Soldier Boy popping off organically. Bobby Schmurda popping off organically. That's what I'm talking about Is what incentivized them to them to Push the button. I'm talking about the initial push up. You can tell the difference when it's organic. Got it. And it's just bubbling out there. Got You. Right. And you and your friends is playing it in the car and a couple clubs.


Got it. We can Look at it right Today with Jello Bingo. It is, It is Right there. Bingo. Got It Is right there. The song came out. It got it got legs. He gets the deal. Now he's All Star Game. Now he weeks of organic To be Yo Adam Silver Jello is why the, the Detroit Lions lost. I don't wanna see him perform no more. He's terrible at performing. He don't know how to perform. He barely know how to rap. He barely know how to breathe while he rap. I'm not, I'm no longer talking about what you think of the song. The song could be something they not either him, he don't know a lick about shit when it come to performance. Don't book him no more hands. The thing's crazy. They not looking at that either.


They looking at the numbers. Yeah. That's it. They got somebody that just sitting track analytics that goes back and say, oh shit, everybody's talking about this. Go get him. We don't care how good he is and we gonna give him a bag. Oh, actually now that, that, that, now that is a great segue to that other la read clip that I had. Anytime a, a musical genius is talking. If you're in the music, you should probably check it out for sure. This is la read on why the music industry may be lacking currently. Right. And an art, I think you and I talked about it, how many, how many important boutique labels do we have that are black? Because that's where the community is built from. Right? Right.


Absolutely. You started at Black Ground, right? Yep. Right. Boutique. A boutique. Right. And an artist. I had started at LaFace and there was Uptown Artists and there was Death Row artists. There was Motown artists, there was Stacks Artists. And there were like, and and they, and that was where, that's where black music was nurtured, curated, and developed. And, and it wasn't no disrespect to anybody, but it wasn't so much us asking for permission Because people that looked like us were making those decisions. And look how different the industry looked then. So the in, so the moment we just talked about when we said Guy and Al Be Sho and Keith Sweat.


Yeah. And Baby Face and, and all and Heavy d and the Boys. And, and I could keep going on and on and Boys Joe Biden guys, those are black people making decisions about the music we heard on a national, international level. Yeah. That is all but dead. So if you look at the Grammy stage, what you see missing is people that look like us Making decisions, Deciding that's what's missing. He smoked it. Yeah. And it's changed music. He smoked it because all the music decisions are now being made by mostly white men. So look at the stage. The artists are great. By the way. I love Chaperone. I fucking thought Vincent Boone was incredible. I really did. I loved the artist.


Right. He was great. I really loved Doce by the, the way As well. But even that, she, That's Black ce. That's black is also boutique from a boutique. Thank you. That's Top Dog, right? Yep. Top Dog. Thank you. Top Dog. Thank you. Punch. Shout to La Reid. I think he's la I-I-I-I-I think he's not a thousand percent. 'cause he said the decisions are being made by white men. I think the decisions are being made by Green. They looking at Nu every, It is all just numbers now. That's all they care about is now It is. Let's put these people here. It's not because they tracking. It's true. It's not true. Okay. I'm, because I'm telling y'all what I think the green is still being only looked at by white men by, as opposed To white men looking at the numbers as Opposed to the artistry or as opposed to the actual quality of the music that's being judged by TDE.


They are a prime example of the point that he's making. So yeah, the numbers are behind it, but the niggas that are able to put out the product is TDE. We see it all the time where S Cs A is arguing and all of they artists are arguing 'cause they not dropping frequently enough. If the white man was controlling that, they'll be pushing them niggas out the door because it makes more Revenue. Sometimes they make it obvious when a black person is involved in it. The pop out show Kendrick's pop out show being on Amazon, I came in here and shouted out Tim, Tim and Amazon. Salute, salute, salute friend of the show. But Tim is a black man from Compton going in Amazon and saying, Hey y'all, This Is, look at this.


This is Buzzing. Look at this. It may only be buzzing here. He also has a situation where, like I said, the the show we talk about the Kendrick show, the amazing show is Amazon. Which show is that that you Talking about? It's the parish show. Got it, got it, got it. Kendrick already has a relationship where I'm doing my di my shows with Amazon. So now if I'm doing a pop out show, yeah, I'm gonna do it through Amazon. That don't necessarily mean that this person, Tim says, yo, this is the right thing to do to stream it here. This situation already got says we got the, I'm not streaming rights, but we got the situation over here. Let's work together and Show it could go like that. It don't go like that. And that's what La Re is saying. It could go like that, but that's not what ends up happening.


Even at Kanye, whatever that shit was that what what was that Kanye shit? Who Was It? Is that what That was? Yeah. Drake. It was Kanye Drake. I ain't talking about that. That's that J Prince shit. I'm not, I'm not talking about that Because I was Amazon as well. Damn my mind. I'm getting old. But even to Joe's point, we, we guessing and we, we we are speculating, but the relationship with the dude Tim at Amazon might be the bridge. It is Tim at Amazon. It's Larry at Apple. It is. And unfortunately a lot of these music labels have gotten rid of, we had this talk here where Universal consolidated and now you got rid of all the boutiques, all the black people.


Yeah. That curate and develop and pick a song and, and dress a artist. And you just got rid of it now. So that's why shit looked the way it looked. Looked. And if you don't see it like that, I'm not trying to change your mind, but It is what It is. Yeah. 'cause I wanna say even to the Doce point, Doce Hass been everywhere this year. So if you're the Grammy's again, you look at at numbers, you looking at analytics. We need to get Her No, no. Why? That's that's wrong. I disagree. That's, I this broadcast are too big. I can't let you say that. I disagree. Please let hear that nobody nowhere looked at Doshi numbers and said let's give her this long as stage. She needs to be the Grammy. Grammy. That didn't happen. That didn't happen dog. That did not. First Off, they, they had all the first, all the, the nominees for best new artists.


Did a show. Did a set. Yeah. She was one of them. So it ain't like we, we didn't pick people. We just picked Doce. She's one of the best new artist nominees because she's been everywhere. They've put her in front of everything she needed to be in front of. So she's gonna get the nomination. You get the nomination. All the other best new artists nominees perform. Yes. She's gonna perform Tight. You think up, hold up. Lemme just one piece, one way. Alright. This year, I'm talking about this year As am I. 'cause we all came in here and said, hey, they got some things right this year. Yes. Right. Like they came and they gave their speech, homeboy gave his speech to the Grammys stuff up. We changed some things around.


And while Jesse Col Collins normally puts the awards together, I'm positive that a black person somewhere had a hand in DOI who don't, who didn't have a top 100 record who, who's never had a top 100 record to say, Hey, we need eyes on this. A black person did that. If you don't See that, I'm not trying to make you See that. Okay. But that happened. That was gonna be my question. So do You, so do you think that her feature would've been a lot smaller if somebody Black didn't Have, if she got a feature? No. I mean, because Ice is right. Every single artist who was nominated for new artists had This year when it was corrective. And I, I don't Know the numbers. So there was a lot of corrective shit this year.


It was a lot of Corrective shit. There was, We don't know what the numbers were for those Artists. Even in it being corrective them listening to black people saying, Hey, you getting this wrong, or, or it wasn't white people at the Grammys protesting saying, Hey, this ain't going the way it's supposed to go. But What I'm saying is, I'm, I'm solely speaking on the Doce point, her being able to perform at the Grammys. I don't put that on a black person saying she needs to be able to perform at the Grammys because they opened up and said all of the best new artists are performing. And all of them wasn't black. Let me ask you a question, lemme Ask you a question. Cool. To do that though, is that true? To do that? No, I do that. I'm asking you to do that. You would be short changing her team. Yeah.


Yeah. You would be short changing the people that fought every day for years before that Grammy appearance for that to happen. It did not go to where you saying, but go ahead. Have y'all have y'all, I I was just about To ask you, do we know what her numbers were? No, I don I don't know. Her numbers not Astronomical. Especially That's what I was about. Say, I don't know if her numbers were through the roof to the point Where numbers dictated her being up there Getting highlighted to that magnitude. I, I'm, when I said numbers, when I said numbers, I wasn't talking sales. I'm talking about analytics. Everything that's been going on, DCI's name has been up there. All the publications are mentioning her 10. She has, they look at this shit. But that's half the time we don't. But that's her Boots. Boots. I label team did that. I'm Top do that.


I'm agreeing with that part because they did the work to get her where she needed to be seen. I was just saying that the Grammys that I'm saying last year's Grammy to work, the Grammys the year before last year would've never allowed that. They would've had that very small stage before the commercial break where they give the new artist 15 seconds going into the commercial. That's what I'm saying. Yes. Yeah. That changed this year. And I'm positive, actually, I know for a fact a black person had a hand in that. Okay. Okay. I agree. He said it. And congratulations To Doce a thousand to Doce. Absolutely. Absolutely. You killed it. Well deserved. I thought my team had more to Do. Like talent. Gotta meet talent.


Your talent and your hard work. Gotta meet your team's. Hard work for sure. And that gotta meet timing and some white person understanding this. Say that again. Say that louder. No, that's, that's Yeah. No, it's true. That's the argument me Ice had the other day when I was just like, yo, and again, I don, we ain't gonna beat this horse, but yo, it has to be a marriage fam. You can't just go pull Joe, blow off the fucking street and just make him a star. I don't See that. Especially over a duration of time. And that's, they might get album. They might get an album. Yeah. But You can't Do that. That goes crazy. They might get an album that sell four or 5 million records, but give them a 15 year career. Give him a 10 year career. I don give two. I don't think that button is that powerful to make these niggas have longevity of a decade of quality.

You know there was Oh yeah. The Delta plan. Yes. That shit looked nuts. Nuts. And there's thiss footage of it. What The fuck is going on? Because somebody say first of all, flights Are cheap. Trump $30. Trump has gutted the fucking FAA. That's what's happening. For Real. What's the FA The, that's what Federal Aviation Association Authority. The Florida Association Federal. You think that's what caused it? Man, I think that there's, It was, the weather was, Oh shit. Look, she just blew up lying About You. How many processes have we had in the last, like two to three weeks Ever? He started to like, no, I'm disagreeing because you doing the same shit. I'm, am I allowed to say, am I allowed to disagree? You all love Y'all. Let him disagree. She do. My mother do some shit go bad and they wanna blame Trump nigga. Come on.


Sorry mom. It's a allowed to blame my fault. Oh, she's gonna be mad. You're right. Trump isn't even the president. A People, a lot of people blaming the FA and saying it's 'cause Trump gutted the agency. But a lot of the pilots are saying, in fact, all the pilots are saying, nah, that's not the case. That, that It is just like that. He said it's bad luck, air conditions pi poor piling. But it's not actually Trump. I, I get why people think that. But that's not the case. So What f Blame blame Trump for everything in the next four Years. What about the DC crash? The DC crash is actually the one where the pilots, the experts came out and said that It is not like it wasn't about FAA. Yeah. There couldn't have been. There's nothing else they could have done. No, not the plane. The plane was doing the right thing. It was the helicopter. Right. It has nothing to do with Trump. They're saying even had there been, there's nothing the FAA could've done differently that would've stopped that from half the DC crash from happening.


You gotta, You gotta go do your research. So, so, so they saying, they saying bad training, bad training for training for the big crash. They said it's also just bad, like bad luck. Like a, what do they call it? Like a perfect storm. Like a lot of things happened that went wrong, but it wasn't from a lack of infrastructure in the FAA What the people's thing is. It's been a bunch of perfect storms in the last two months. Well y'all, the ones keep wanting to fly everywhere. I've sat my ass grounded in the living room. True. I'm, they ain't gonna perfect storm me out the game. Well some people Gotta fly for work. Yeah. I got some people Travel to see family like people got, I just make sure my pilot white and I'm comfortable. Oh My God. Well you know, it's funny that you asked that. There You go. It's funny you asked that. I'm just joking. A black you a sellout.


Hold On. That's Saying yo, it was a black piling recently that when he landed, he took a picture. He had dreads, he had a real fronts and Yeah. And he caught a lot of heat because they were saying we don't want our pilots to do this and look this to look like That. I don't want my pilot to look like that. I also don't want my pilot to be a white boy with long hair and like sit, you know, like ta tatted knuckles. You know what I mean? It would make me, I'm About to say, if the pilot got up there looking like fucking jelly roll. Yeah, I'd be uneasy. I'm not saying it's fair, but it would make me question the flight. I'd stay awake the whole flight. But that's the problem. You want, you want equality for black men and you talking about all the black struggles and we finally get it.


And then now as you know, we, you stay on the other side. I don't stay on the other side. I'm saying I have biases I gotta work through. I'm not saying I'm right. I'm saying acknowledge the wrong. Yeah, Go ahead. I don't think well hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Hold on. Mark is a doctor so maybe he can't be ignorant or on recording, on recorded broadcast. So I'll do it for him.

All that, all of that shit changes. Yes. Like I think every learn, I think it's levels in life. And I still, even where I am today, which ain't a high level. Yeah. I still really, really, really go to the ground and poll with niggas today that are way beneath my level that I'm on. And I still try to pull 'em up.


But you're just a people's person. And So that's what I'm saying, the patience Over. So when you have, when you get burned by doing that or going down and speaking to people that don't appreciate those things, it will sort of leave a bad taste in your mouth. If itch made 30 million a year, I don't think he'd be in America. He wouldn't, I don't think he would live in America. He would, I think him and his family would move to same bar. I'd be six months on six. So what do you say about niggas that's rich that go back to the hood in Polly in the hood, even though they go, you know, it's rich, rich, like 50 rich, he'll still go back to the hood and see niggas and check niggas and have conversations with them. I think 50 is outliers. That's not fear. I, I think Why do you I don't think that's name somebody Else besides 50. See I think this is what happens. I think that we looking at the entertainment sphere and in the entertainment sphere, yeah.


It may not be that many people because they can't go back home. But I think there are people that are doing well significantly well and they still go back and try to help people bring them up. I think that that happens. It just may not be, you think they have that 50, $60 million a year level doing that? I think, I think it's sparingly because once you get to that level, your time is limited. And that's what I'm saying. Exactly your time. But you get up there, everything changes for you. You don't even have the, But then if you time to worry, say if you up and you, you just so happened to go back to the neighborhood to go check a family member. You see somebody that you made a promise years ago when you wasn't up. I seen situations happen like that. Oh, Break those. You seen I seen I break those. No, no, you don't break those.


I seen the situ. I break them. You're stop it Joe. Sorry. When you, you gotta Stop acting like you're like that for the fucking kid. You're not you, you, It is just for the camera. You and 50 of the same type of nigga too. It's just oh, It's just for the camera. You The same type of nigga. You see somebody like, Oh yeah, I said that. I remember that. No, I'm one of the most giving people in the world. Yeah. Come on Joe. Stop. Like, I'm front, I'm front for the campus. I, I give and give and give and give and give. You only give to the Jersey city niggas. No. Trying be funny. See? Oh, I Was just asking which one. I ain't gave too many. I kiss me and them. I kiss me in them that chased them. Yo, he paid the niggas up. I'm gonna buy you a gas station. Hey yo. Holy shit. Flip Damn. Can't Say that.

You don't know what I've been going through this whole fucking week. I gotta come here and put, be a fucking professional because that's what they use against me. Be a professional. I'm pissed. I'm sitting here with a lot of anger, not talking with anyone. But I have to put on a face for to perform my time is almost up. The Word you're looking for is work.

It don't feel good up here when like, you gotta be professional. Right? I don't like professionalism. Oh yeah. I don't. But I think What thing, lemme think you might be honest. Was this thing built with professionalism? It wasn't. No. I got rid of the nick all. Don't do that. I'm not. I'm not. And shout out to them 10 years. I'm shouting to everybody.

I'm very serious about, I'm serious as well. Very serious about it. They're fucking sweat equity. When shit, when shit wasn't where it needed to be.

They Gotta work Salute to them. That's a joke. That's a joke. Shout to anybody Might the body. No. Yes It is. Yes It is. Yes It is. I don't want yo any yo yo yo. For 10 years mo 95% of the shots that I've sent up here have only been for play. Play. It is just on air theatrics. It is part of what makes me the greatest in the world at this. When I go home, I have real like thoughts about some of this shit. You got it bro.


Just leave me alone. Yeah. What Jay-Z Did. Now listen. No, listen. That's great. Great segue. Great segue. Hey, turn my music. High, high, high. Sure do. I'm from the streets with bullets. There's so much that you can run. Slaughter. Cops come to shit top to bottom. They say that we are prone. It's on the blueprint man. This home Sweet home. Oh, I know. I got Motherfucker. I you I'm you. That I know exactly. I I was in when this shit fucking dropped. When you was what? I was in chaos when this shit dropped.


Hell. Now listen, listen. The the, the fucking allegations are always loud. And the exoneration is always quiet. Quiet. Oh yeah. Disrespect Is always loud. No matter the magnitude of the superstar we speak of in this instance, it happens to be Sean Carter, Jay-Z, all of that. Whatever was going on with him, I don't even know 'cause I didn't really read, read up on it or take it seriously.


It is out the window. It is out the window. All charges dismissed. Dropped Countersuit. Now we are suing you Tony Busby for the stress, the duress, the heartache, the pain that you caused me and my family. You have caused me to lose $20 million deals. Yeah, I absolutely, I hope. Love it. Love this. I hope I he calling him up socks. I do not see enough of the media. Loud loud. Y'all are not loud enough for I agree. Pardon me. My fucking gerd. Y'all are not loud enough for me right now. Thousand percent. Lemme hit The round of applause real quick. Thousand percent.


I hope. Congratulations. The, I don't know if it's irony. You have laid the blueprint. You have laid the blueprint for how black men should handle these things when they are false. That's important to note when it's a false allegation. Too many times, for too many years, in recent years, there's just been shakedowns of sorts. But he came out with conviction from the gate. No, that don't mean that you're not about to lose deals 'cause just the sheer announcement is gonna make make you lose deals. But he came out said, I didn't do it.


It was a lot. The internet was loud. They were, boy y'all were loud. Almost like y'all was waiting on another black grate to fall for shit like this. I think that's nasty of the internet. Disgusting. I get it. I get it. Y'all on some today nasty, grimy shit. But I was really excited about this. I would love for more media outlets to report on this in caps, in caps, write it in big bold font. It's too quiet out there for me. And HOV ain't gonna say nothing 'cause he's ho he's just gonna speak through the counter suit and crack crack homeboy's muffin Again. I hope he rub him down to his socks. I hope he take everything he got. Yeah, I promise you.


I hope he take everything he got. He Fi Yeah, he filed, he filed the lawsuit like a day before Blue Ivy's premiere for Lion King. So he was forced to make a choice to go see his daughter or stay away because of the negative press. Think about that. Which is what he ended up having to do. It's Disgusting. Yeah. Yeah. What you put in the, in the suit as, as part of his reason why I hope his countersuit, You Know what I mean? Like I hope he strips him down to his socks, man. Yeah, no. Like I, I want take the socks not for nothing. And I ain't even on that. I want your family to feel what my family potentially felt or what you tried to make my family feel. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? Like doing. Well don't think about the losses that could potentially occur from people being falsely accused of shit. I want you to strip 'em dead ass.


Yeah. It is obvious the court did 'cause it was dismissed with prejudice. So they can't refile that. That usually happens when a case is so obviously fake, fake. You know, that the court doesn't even wanna entertain it anymore. I mean all the evidence that came out, I was that this person, this person was in another part of the country. I was here. Oh, that person didn't appear. Oh, you know, it was Fraud. Have you heard the statement? The statement didn't even make sense. Yeah. Anybody that knows New York City, like at one point the girl was like, yo, I just remember this really big circle driveway that we pulled up to this house. Right. It's like That's barely exists in, in Manhattan in the tri-state area. Damn near. But None of it made sense. What's interesting is Puff also issued a statement.


Puff charges have been dropped too because they, The case was dropped against Puff and against Jay and on this particular case. And, and, and Puff is basically like, see people be lying. This is another example of these cases coming out used against me to lie. So, so while this case is false, it seems Puffy is using it as an excuse to kind of say, look, everybody's after me. This is wrong. I think it's unfair to even mention Puff during the whole segment. And, but, but, but they were grouped together that, but I, I I think it's, it's important to note that, that this is why this, this is why it's interesting because Jay is innocent of this and I believe Puff is innocent of this one. But it's interesting to see how that plays into the rest of his cases. Sure. In court in terms of the court of public opinion. I said that I think some of the ones against Puff, by the way for going there Me Too are gonna come out is I, IIII there I've been saying for a long time I think that the people that are coming out against Puff, and I think Puff has lawyers that are great.


I don't know his lawyers, but I'm assuming that he has some of the best lawyers money could buy. I think what's gonna happen is some of these people are gonna start recanting their stories and start getting they ass whooped on the stand. And it's going, it's gonna fare better for Puff to have more than less. I think the more people that come forward for Puff, I think it's gonna fare better for him to have more people than less. Because we're gonna start proving some of these people to be liars and it's gonna play into the reasonable Doubt. And also jurors don't trust that. I remember there was a case in, in Georgia, Dr. York, I don Dunno if y'all remember Dr. York from back in the day, but I do. Yeah. And you know, he was, there were thousands of cases of of of child molestation At some point, the jury, the prosecution said, we don't wanna present thousands because it will seem so unbelievable that the jury may throw it all away because we don't believe this.


So to your point, I think a a, a small group of credible cases is better than throwing a bunch of stuff against the wall and making people doubt the whole thing. And because some settlements are gonna come everybody chasing the bat. Like the busby dude that was the same attorney that prosecuted Deshaun. Mm. I think stuff like that is important to know. 'cause Busby wasn't Trump, it wasn't like some, I don't wanna say Lisa Bloom shout or ambulance chaser. Like this was somebody who has done this with a resume, But you might've been Trump. You might've been taking advantage of these black people that were ignorant to the law or their rights and that had a whole bunch of money.


And typically when you have a whole bunch, somebody sued you today for a million dollars, You right. You give it to him. What's the charge? It depends on, It is not worth the headlines. Well that's where the shake down you Get what, what I'm saying. And so that's the shakedown. That's where the shakedown from. You might be Trump. And you just made a fortune in doing this type of disgusting shit. Gimme now I get you for 2 million. I get you for a mil. I get this person for a million. Nigga you Talking, I as Jane Doe Bro, Jane Doe As as Jane Doe, DOE Jane with no nothing. There's nothing to lose. There's nothing for me to lose in this instance, bro. Until you go up against that one that's gonna fight until you go up against the one that got a platform big enough to be like, suck my dick. And and now I'm gonna sue you And you can take some me because that, that's why the puffy thing is important too.


Because part of the shakedown was I'm tying your name to this person that everybody hates right now. Because the allegation was they both did it at the same Time. They Both did it. They attacked me together. You Right. So by saying that the average celebrity gonna be like, I don't want nothing to do. I don't wanna be nowhere near him. I don't want my name on the same sentence as him here. Here's a million dollars. Take it. I don't know hove well enough to say this. I just don't think that that's the text that's getting him to the threesome. Hey, me and him. Yo, this I got puffing this girl here on come through. I just, he's never been that. Like he didn't, he doesn't move that way. Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations. Congratulations. Made the round for applause. The round of applause for hold man.


We hit the round of applause. Job well done. Sign of about nation job. Well done. You have laid the blueprint for how men, black men especially should handle false allegations. A thousand percent from Jane Doz. Yes. When you it happened to me again. I'm, I'm calling a lawyer. I'm calling him. Get his lawyer Jay-Z lawyer. Yeah. And I'll start to GoFundMe to to pay. I was gonna say, I ain't taking no cuts. Yeah, we not taking no cuts. Right. Wait, Y'all wouldn't take, y'all wouldn't take a cut so I could beat my charges. Nah, not at all. Right. We good?

Whole job. Well done Tony Busby. Well I don't know what the future looks like for him. It's Gonna be rough. I hope it's bleak. I got him losing that. Oh, he got him losing whatever the, he gonna settle.

That initial statement didn't speak like I, nah, should I'm accept any type of settlement. Should too him into submission. I'm gonna show you that I'm different that nigga and then came back and rewrote some shit. I'm from Marcy. Yeah. Wayne ain't doing that nigga. Yeah. Nah, hope just opened up the notes. He did the notes tab and He went crazy. Stand, stand for I'm gonna show you. Okay. He did his thing. Yeah. Nah. All the way fire. All the way fire again. Congratulations Kim. Congratulate him enough to the whole family for that nasty ass move. Tony fucking busby. Let's see, let's see, let's see. What does that say right there? Has your girl ever seen your group chat?


I'll answer it first because mine's as fast. My girl has seen anything that has to do with my phone. With y'all phone. Yeah. It's our, It is ours now. She's seen it all. Read it all, sent it all to her best girlfriend. Gossiped about it every last drop. All of it. Even the bitches that I was texting that I didn't mean that shit. Like, it don't matter. It's all on the record. This is a weird question because first of all, yes she's seen some of my group chats certainly, but group chats don't really be like shit in there. Really. At least in my experience. It's usually just talking shit. Their group Chat be like that. Yeah. They got messy group chats.

It's like listening to this podcast damn near like ripping on somebody. Yep. Fucking And occasional fat ass. No. Am I Occasionally, I guess that's One of You right? That that's projection and that's one of the fucking double standards that exists out there because You know what girls do? Girls be showing dicks and all that.

On my Instagram algorithm I bumped into Mel a older Go ahead. I'll clear on you're A part of the conversation. I I well I think you guys have the assumption that there's all just like dicks in our group chat. I didn didn't say that. Say that's not what he said. That's not what I said. You have their Gender wars. It's not that Gender wars not, not wouldn't have made it 10 years without gender wars. We ain't Let's give it up a gender wars. You don't have to. Gender war. Nah, come on, come on. What's in your group chat.

He folded me like this hour. No, no. Wayfair's having a President's Day sale. That is what's happening in my group chat. I know maybe in my twenties it was different, but right now it's furniture. It's, I Have a wife. She tells me what goes on in girls group. I Don it's long Mel. Talk about she Do up here. It is all that she does up here is live. I will show you my, I don wanna see now. I don't wanna see it. It's But so you ain't got no spicy group to do oth Do other women, you know have spicy group chats?


Oh, Absolutely. And she never removed some holes from the group chat too, too now. Oh Yeah. Sometimes green bubbles probably Green bubbles will definitely get dicks. Yeah. But Sometimes it gets a little, I'm, I'm a little vanilla sometimes, you know, when they talk about like, you know, dicks in their ear and shit like that. I'm like, okay, I'm exiting stage left. This is not my Okay. So it's Not like the are dicks in the group chat. You're just not a cider of them. Yeah. What about, you just said it was all Wayfair. It could be conversation. My current group chat right now is like, is furniture and candles and shit like that. Yes. It's it's not World. I didn This podcast would've got nowhere without lies. Joe, You Right. Give it up for lies. It would've been over A year one.


I got some gender war shit here real quick. Oh, Oh yeah. Count me out. I was looking at No, you gonna jump, you gonna jump in this one? Yeah. You never this one you'll jump in. You're never count on Justin war. I was looking at a post from a gentleman named Jeff Fargo. It was a black man and a white man on a podcast on Instagram. They was talking and the black man took exception to the term happy wife, happy life. Yeah, I do too. You follow me, right? Yeah. Once he spoke about it, I totally agreed with what he was saying. He was saying, why does that phrase exist? Actually I'm just play. I'm yeah. Go duh play because I'm gonna fuck it up.


Kids don't respect a man who sacrifices his own purpose. They Cooked neither do women have you. That's the black director. Have you made mistake where you kind of lost sight of your purpose? 'cause you thought that that was the best way to be a father or be a man? Oh yeah. I fell into that trap too where I, I stopped working as much. I made my priority, my wife and my kid, and I lost sight of the goal and one day I looked up and their lives were worse because I couldn't provide, they were getting more of my time. They were getting more of my love, but their lives weren't any better. They need to see you hustle, your wife, your kids need to see you win. Your children don't want a miserable dad. They wanna see you crush it in life.


That's what they wanna see. Have you ever heard the phrase happy wife, happy life all the time? Does it piss you off? Like it pisses me off? Yeah, it's Annoying Because there's no situation with happy wife, miserable dad. If dad's miserable wife miserable kid's miserable. There's no such thing as happy family. Miserable dad. Dad must suffer. But he must enjoy the suffering. God damn is what I said. What I heard That I never put that in a vacuum that way. Remind Me to tell you something off camera. Okay. Yeah. But why is but why does, why, why was why. Yeah. Why is Why he gotta be miserable if she, If she's Happy. That's that, that was exactly what I was gonna Ask. Like That's not what he said. That's Not what he said. I think the idea is what he said. That's That we, that's the assumption that he said that people would be led to think because me and him just had the same question.


You, you know why? Because when you say happy wife, happy life, it seems as if the only priority is the people outside of you. Exactly. Like, like if you said you, you it should be happy spouse, happy house. Right? Like yes. Like both of us agree. That's what what both of us absolutely agreed. But, but, but men are often, but it's not that, it's not that men are discarded, men are discarded. It's often like, okay, you gotta do whatever you gotta do to make sure the house, to make sure the kids are fed to make sure everybody's Happy and not for nothing. It's a role that we accept. We accept that role. We almost say fuck ourselves to hold up This house. Yeah. To make sure she's happy. It's Too, some people like that, some people are proud of that, that makes them happy. Yeah. But no, I I don't know if it necessarily makes them happy. We forego our happiness. Yes. Our happiness is an afterthought.


Us secondary dog. You gotta listen to cut it out. Yeah. That nigga, he, he be saying a bunch of flaw shit. He a dick sometimes, but I'm telling you, he basically says that yo, as a man, when you start ascending an age, you kind of put your happiness to. It's not like what I'm a bitch for. Ain't nobody coming to save you. Ain't nobody going listen nigga. You gotta make it happen regardless. And you kind of live by that. Yo, we gotta do the work, we gotta do the work, we gotta do the work. We first came, you're like, yo, we're gonna put our heads down, we're gonna do the work. And I think benefit's gonna be at the end of it. And that's what happens. And that as a man, that's how you kind of carry through life. But you're happy your Priority Society makes, society makes that normal, right?


Yes. That, that's why patriarchy is unhealthy for men too. If, if, if your wife is happy and your children is happy, You know what I mean? That's all the focus. You're succeeding as a man no matter if your body is killing you or any of That shit. And a lot of times you can't even complain about it a lot of times because you, you'll be looked at a certain way. Yeah. Right. A lot of times you can go through in internal turmoil, but you have to put on a happy face when you walk into the house. Right. That applies to men when you, you know, when they say lead that shit outside, but a lot of times you're bringing it inside. You just have to put a mask on. Yep. So it won't affect them. It says something I'm sorry mean to interrupt you go ahead. It's okay. No, it's okay. No, it, it says something. Last episode I was listening. He said if I I only had $20 in my account, I would never, they would never know. My, my lady would never know.


And I've been there before me too. Where I'm sitting here trying to rob Peter to pay Paul, I'm borrowing money. My wife may have the money Word. You know I'm saying that part, You know what I mean? But I'm gonna borrow it to make this thing happen because my idea of of manhood is partly about being able to take care of everybody and to be in controlled and everything. Yeah. And I'm like literally not sleeping in that, trying to figure out how to put these things together. And that's a fact. And, and because I don't, I don't Stress will fuck you up. Exactly. So you can die from stress And we do every day. Yeah man, you bond, you spend your last money to make sure your kids have and all that shit. Make sure your wife have and Shit is different and You just gotta eat that. Yeah. Lot of, Lot of male voices. Let's give Mel a chance to process and reply to this or speak to this. It just sounds like from, and We're not gender waring.


No. It, it just sounds like from what you guys are, you know, saying collectively that you fall victim to, you fall victim to like a kind of like the idea of what a man is supposed to be. You know what I'm saying? Absolutely. Like provision and leave your, you know, non-emotional leave your stuff at the door, like your, all of that stuff. The hu your humanity is inconsequential and that doesn't, I don't really, I I just don't see it that way. Maybe it's because I'm not married. Maybe it's because of that. That's what happy wife happy life is saying. But, but that's why I think that me and ICE had the same question at the same time that I don't think that that's saying foregoes your happiness.


That's not true. I I never took it as that personal. I didn't either. I never took it as that. And also, And also to is point like a couple of seconds ago, some people actually like that sometimes the source of their happiness is see their, their wife and their family thriving. And so I don't think that it's a blanket statement that can be applied to all men. You know, it's, It's a bad thing when you think that. And so hold on the other thing, you get what I'm saying? And so hold on. The other thing is, is that this is the first time in history where men and women are basically kind of on equal footing in terms of making the same money and whatever else.


So what I hear from a lot of women is it's no longer provision that they're looking for. What they're looking for is partnership. What they're looking for is a little bit more self-development and that is what they're not finding. But That's part of that, that's part of the same problem Of patriarchy. Exactly. Because we're not trained to do that. We're trained to pay these bills and make sure that the, the lights are on and other things. So we get judged On that. No. And so, but wait, hold on one second to further that point. I think that all the motivational speakers that speak to y'all have done y'all a disservice by saying the only way to develop yourself is get rich, get fit. That's it. What about all the other ways that you can develop yourselves? You guys have been left at, left. You got, there's been a grave disservice done to you because of that way of thinking that there's no value in that other level of self-development.


That it's just get rich for provision and for yourself and get fit. And that's it. What if the pe what if the people are, I don't disagree with what she said. What if the people that's, I think that's true. I think that's true. What if the people that's receiving it, receiving the perks don't think about your happiness at all? Oh, well then that's a fucked up mate. Lemme ask you A question. That's that, That's, That's how that's hold on. Bad, bad. That's not intentional, right? Because everybody has issues, ma'am. But what if they also think that you are the man, suck it up. Figure it out because the road that you, that you not took, I guess because the road that is I guess assigned to You. Right? So she's not thinking that because wanna be careful?


She's not thinking that. Yo, I wonder if he's a she, she's gonna check on you, but she's not going to go out her way. Some people not gonna go out their way to find out what are you going through at work or to find out the fa finances because men, we shut down. Right? We shut down. When you try to ask certain questions, we are not communicative a lot of the times. We don't want to get into that. Yo forget about that. We don't want to. 'cause a lot of times the partner, hey, we told not to and we're told not to. They're not worse than the complaining man. Yeah man, get rich, get fit. Shit is some modern Shit. It and that's some new age shit. Yeah, that's new. Most of the, most of the motivational speakers I follow that they don't live by that ma that motto, like I think that the motivational speakers I follow, they find it insulting that we only relegated to protect and prevail and provide what I'm hearing, and I'm, I promise you I'm not trying to beef, like me and Mel had a big argument that went viral where she said, should the, the CEO of Xerox date, the bus driver, you can't have both things.


You can't say that I just want you to work on your personal development, but you also gotta make as much money as me because now the man's gonna bust his ass to any detriment to make as much money as that particular woman. No, that's, that wasn't my argument. I I just, the expectation put on her because of your argument is what I was basically saying. I was just like, why should she, if, if that's not what she wants, if she's going to hold out for somebody, if she doesn't give a shit and she will date anybody, bus driver, post office worker or you know, a CEO of a Fortune 500, that's her choice. But it's, it's based the whole argument was around, there's slim pickings and you should just take what you should get. And if it's a bus driver, then just be happy no matter what your station is at light in life.


That was what that, that was what that conversation Was like. No, that wasn't that. But I don because it was the, the bus driver was basically doing everything that you wanted. Yes. So, so in that, it was based on K Williams shit about her saying she shouldn't have to date the bus driver. And I said, if the bus driver was checking all of these other boxes outside of the monetary box, and that makes him a great man and he's still a great cut. He just don't make no money. But back to what we talking about now, today's society is telling men and we hear it every day, that provide and protect are your two primary things that you need to do. Get your money up. That's all he saying. Provide and protect. Provide and protect. Provide and protect. And that's being beaten to men's head. So in doing that provisional piece and that protection piece, men are forgetting themselves to be able to be providers and protectors To to show up.


Yes. Yeah. For, for the things that we are being taught every fucking day are our two primary objectives. I feel like that's what a million little things Is about. Season one. I can't speak in, in closing, in closing, for me, I, I, when, and this is, I don't, tell me if I'm wrong, a lot of times when the woman is the provider, the man in the home feels like he's not respected. True. The man feels like he's not respected, he's not looked at as a man if the woman is the provider. Now, I don't know what that looks like. I don't know if, but that's a big thing. That's true as well. I think, I think it's two things. It is a lot with that. It's, It is. Yeah. I'm just saying I don't wanna, I don't wanna open that gate, but My homegirl say that the man feels less than Right.


And so he has an insecurity because he's not the breadwinner or I don't wanna say breadwinner. He's not the primary financial provider in the home. I understand. Yeah. But then I had a conversation with one of my peoples, and this was a couple months ago actually. She advocate of the pod. And I was saying like, yo, you make more money than you do. And she got a real high position at her job. And I said, every single day you go to work and you boss people around. Right. But, and that's your daily life. And I said, yo, a lot of times women can't check that at the door. So when you come home, you know, you make more money than your man. And you are basically doing the same shit that you do for eight to 10 hours at work till your man. And then when he starts to complain, you look at it as him being jealous that you make more money.


No, you talking to me like a subservient. And that's where some of the dog, I promise you, three days later, she called me and was like, yo, I never had that talk with nobody. That talk was so insightful. I didn't know that I'd be talking to my man like that. And he said it and I looked at it the way he said, like, yo, you just jealous of me. 'cause I make more money. Whatever the case may be. A lot of times we are allowing society to make us worship titles and money. Damn. I wish I had this clip to add on to your point. But when I'm, I have a brain freeze right now. Was on Shannon Sharp, the black comedian. The, the lady. Not Cheryl Underwood. Leslie Jones? No, not Leslie Jones One. The S though. No. She was like, yo, my, I'm not the breadwinner just because I make the most money.


I'm not the breadwinner. Mm. Yeah. And I didn't See that clip go around enough. It wasn't Monique, she said something, I'll find it at some point. But she was like, IM the Bread though. I make more money than my man. I'm not the head of household or a breadwinner. Yes. I know plenty of people that are in that relationship. Hmm. I know plenty of people that are in that relationship where the woman makes more money than the man, but the man's still the man. That's a hard thing to get to. I think. I think that's a really hard thing. I Think it depends. I think it comes down to finding a good compatible partner. I agree. Figuring out who you wanna be. Like I don't wanna be the head of my, I don't wanna be the head of my household. Right, exactly. I just wanna a partner who I'm equal with. And if, if my wife made 10 times more than me or 10 times less than me, like I, I still want that, that relationship.


Me too. You know? And, and I know some people take pride in like, like, like I was saying, some people take pride. Cheryl. It was Cheryl. It was Cheryl. Cheryl. My been some people take pride in, in taking care of the family and doing all that. That's true. Just like, just like some women take pride in just taking care of the kids. Right. But I think the issue is how society treats us or makes us think that that's who we're supposed to be and what our role is. And so we, that's what I'm always trying to work out. I let it be known in mine and my depression. Get the kicking in high gear. This holy shit is kaput. Yeah. The kids, you, the house, the bills, the mortgage, 4 0 1 savings, future plans, all this shit is kaput. That's facts. So yeah. Happy house, happy spouse. I like that. But You can't, You can't Though. You can't. What? Let's just Talk. It's not true.


What do you mean? It's just talk? Because reality kicks in. So regardless of your depression, your bill still gotta get paid Facts. It don't matter what you going through, my nigga, but wait, Lex Gotta eat. But this is the part, in this part, I'm gonna lean into what Mel is talking about. Right. If I have a bad enough argument with my girl, I'm not saying that my work won't get done. How I show up in the world is going to look differently. True. It's possible. Yeah. So yeah, I need to be handled a certain way, the same way you need to be handled a certain way. 'cause I need to go out there and be my best. It's not about the work, the work not getting done. It is about in this job, do you want my That's, That's unique to this job too.


Okay. Well, unique. No other job serious. No, I'm just saying Naz. No, it's unique to this job. 'cause in corporate, you know what I'm saying? It's a little, you sell your personality to make a living. Right. So if you having a fucked up day, we see it, it's going to come across on camera. But if you worked in a corporate office and you was a VP of finance, or if you was da da da da da, your shitty, I would be skimming the books. And it still, and that still Could happen. And, And if you worked in corporate, it still could happen. Your team gotta eat it. You could, you could miss some shit that fucking cost you all some money. 'cause you, you distracted. You're not focused on your job. Off on a tangent, I just thought the dad happy wife, happy life. Shit. He was the first person I've heard on the internet. Really look taken aback by that.


Yeah. Me. I've never heard someone be He Looked pissed at that. Yeah. I've never heard someone bring that down like that. I can, I can. I see where they're coming from. I don't think that that phrase necessarily means that though. Me Neither. Okay. I do have a Part of the Show. This Part of the Show is from a name I can't pronounce, but I'm gonna go back to school and it will lose our life. Competition for good. This says on December 20th, the Discord community lost a beloved member of the JBP community. Jason Blatant abr, I'm hoping I'm pronouncing the last name correctly. Blatant was a talented rapper, Amani's Eskimo brother, allegedly, and a devoted father who spoke often and highly of his children.


What if you put your dick in your fucking pen? Anyway, during our time with Bladen, he was critical of the pod following Joe for many years. To us Bladen was family. He logged in daily to update us on his day, talk about his love for his ex slash bm and playfully tell us to fuck off. He stopped responding one day and several days passed without an update. We all wondered if Blatant was finally taking a break from writing in this, in his discord diary. After a little investigating and after 15 and 15 days later, we found his obituary, God damn emotion. The news was shocking to us and we're still trying to process it as a family.


So I asked, have any of you lost an online fan or friend you've never met, but built a relationship? Was it difficult to explain to your real life family slash friends who may not understand online relationships? Rest in peace. Jason Blatant abr Man, rest in great re I'm sorry. Great question And rest in peace to Jason. A Brau. Yeah. And Yes, distinguished panel. I I've had that experience, you know, and it it, it's hard because I know the first time it happened to me was in 2006 when I used to run a blog called the Barbershop Notebooks. And it was when blogs were still new in online communities.


People didn't really understand it. But these were people who I engaged every day. Now you people kind of know to be in spaces or on Twitter or whatever, you know, that you can be in community with people you never met. But back then it made sense to us intuitively. Like we knew that was our people. But I had never met this name was MDE Glen writes his real name and and I had never met him before. And he eventually died. Two people. He died. He, he, he, he is very openly HIV positive and actually had aids and he, he was working on his PhD and he was doing all this cool stuff and he was so excited and he was working. Then suddenly he took a turn for the worst and just, he just was gone for three weeks. And we were all trying to figure out what happened to him. And I remember we all, many of us went to his funeral and we were like crying and, and it was the first time we had met and we were trying to figure it all out.


And we were like, why are we crying for somebody we never met before? And we couldn't make sense of it. Now I think it's easier to make sense of it. You should feel normal, you should feel okay. Family is what you make at communities. How you build it. It does not have to do with physical walls or material space. It's about who is in your world. And so grieve and experience it. Very well said. Yeah. That was, that was great. Good. And to answer the question, this has happened to me many times. Same. My lawyer over The years, My trademark lawyer, I came in, talked about him, trademark lawyer. He was 25 years old. Jesus. I met him through the pod. He hit me. He was like, yo da da da. He was doing all my trademark shit. And you know, you, It is ti It is timed. So when you file for a trademark shit and the time had lapsed and I'm like, yo, I'm hitting him.


I'm hitting him and my shit going straight to voicemail and his, they, the U-S-P-T-O, the trademark people, they put my name, my email and his email. So when I googled him, it found that he had passed away. He was an attorney from Florida Young. He was 26 I think 25, 26 pod watcher. And he had passed away. And I, I felt, I felt away. 'cause he used to be called yo, I got caught cheating. Yo, my girl, he'll call me and be asking me for advice and all types of shit. And he was like a young up and coming kid. I think his father is in politics heavy in Florida. I think his father's a congressman I believe. And yeah, he, he had passed away.


Hmm. So Kind of bothered was there was a fan a few years ago that had made the news for something and then he passed like in, in like a year or a couple years after that. But he was a huge podcast fan. Like I'm always appreciative to the person that lets me know that the person passed. Yeah. Like you were aware how this person felt about this show or us. And you made it a point to let us know. But it's always sad. Yeah. I think Caton, I think the dude that you just mentioned said The both him Gene, dude, rest in peace. Oh, It was a podcast for Both him. Gene. Yeah. Both. Yes. Yeah. Wow. Wow.


Rest in peace. Rest in peace to Jason. A Brau For Sure. Yeah. Rest in peace. Peace bro. Prayers for, for those inside the pod. Outside the pod. Anybody out there going through a silent battle or prayers? Queue it up. Our prayers go out to you and shout out to Jason Brady's family for sure. Family and friends who may be dealing with the loss. But great, great question and Thank you to whoever sent this in. Dope. Yeah. Cue it up. Good idea. Yeah. And for the 10 year anniversary, I mean it makes sense.
