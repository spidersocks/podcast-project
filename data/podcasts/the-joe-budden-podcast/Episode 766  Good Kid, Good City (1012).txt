Yeah, he's a rapper's rapper. Yeah. Yeah. That's the other reason. I Love the dead president's flip. Because as soon as I heard It knowing What, his last few months have been like When dead presidents.


come on, if you know how to rap and niggas view you as somebody that knows how to rap, there's an expectation. There. Yeah, that's True. That is because all the great rappers have touched it. Set It sets a bar. So from the rip, I'm like with his last few months picking this beat. s not coincidental, It's s like the low hanging est Let me get introspective loop of all time. But carry on. Go pause. Carry on Man. I'm done hating. I'm trying, but, but two things could be true. Okay. That could be true. Even though Bye the end of this pod, I'm gonna find another flip that's way more egregious than this. Please, I Am before this. Go over drums. s not included. We're not talking About. Just drum Loop. No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yeah, the drums. Music. Yeah. Fuck the drums. But he delivered The message.


I guess would be one. He delivered. Anytime you come on and start. That's another one. I don't mind. I. Don't mind that one though. It is, It is less played out to me. It is played out. It Is played. Everyone's used This shit too. Yo, you right. Naming the ones That. If the right people get 'em, shit. The message worked for fucking what's My man Recipe Juice World like. Yeah, no, the message works. It just works. Yeah. I. No, no. I. Don't not talk. About the Nas the message. I'm talking About Mel Mel's message. Oh, you right talking About. The original message It is the message. Yeah. That's another one. Yeah. That's been used quite bit. No, I'm done with that one. But it works every time it does. I don't believe in nothing. He played out if it's done right. I don't care. About. That co ray didn. That one. you Don agreed Coy Ray didn the message. right? She didn shit was fired. When. She didn it.


This shit. Ish fire. You do some shit, right? It, we're naming the one. That is fire When. They come on em. Jesus. He I'm sorry I, don't mind hearing them. I'm not with you. I don't Cole. You showing your ass didn. This, this, this. I mean you've been rapping good. Yeah. That's the problem with him too. Didn. He raps too good His his rapping good. Ish Now, He weaponized against him. There's I. Feel like It always has The magician. Yeah, but even more so Now There Ish a bigger microscope on it. And we'll get to that at his second verse. Sure. But. yeah. You rap good with T Grizzly, you rap good Everywhere you go you rap. good. Never heard of bad Now. So, so Now, there's no, there's no rabbit out the hat.


Really? It's the magician going on stage. Doing the trick. That. You know, and you expect, that's a good point, There. There's nothing different that happens. good When. He does this. That's a good point. I. I disagree. That's a good point. And I think that's where the feature run comes in because I'm Doing so many it's s not just that he raps s good, but I'm rapping good on so many different styles of beats that I'm, I'm still separating myself 'cause yeah, My, My counterparts can rap I Hate all of the features? Ish. That hard to do. What Yes. That's very hard To wrap on all the different pockets. Here. Hell, It's hard to do. But the risk s not worth the reward at at some That is what's to him. It could be, oh, and we'll get to That and this second verse because He ain might be a little conflict.


Can we play A second verse? Not we have a pocket My fault. Why are you rushing me through the second verse? Not My fault. Because I had an argument to That. I'm trying to You it too. Antsy man. Yeah, he young He ain. Ready to run. Get your shit. go ahead. I. To your point, I hate That. I get the point. About the Hying in different pockets and all of that. But it's no, aside from the pockets and the beats He challenging who he's rapping with, it's let It doesn't give it where it is. like we're seeing him He challenged. It's let, all right you rapping over Here on these beats. But you're not challenging yourself 'cause your peers you rapping with can't rap like You. No, but That is a challenge though. Nor nor Ish. He Doing it with anybody who has a fan base that matters as large as his or larger than Hi his.


So at at, at some point you right. Super. You we You it. Super serving the same audience. I'll Also Challenge. Yeah, that's I'm saying I'll Also challenge your your point though I think That him rapping on shit that's outside of his wheelhouse. Ish challenge. It is the Challenge. That's the challenge, right? How do I rap with someone? That raps let simple and Trappy or whatever, let may be him rapping on and still appeal to their fan base as We. That is challenge him. Rapping on That yacht Beat was tough. I don't care how It came out. That's a challenge. It's a different Kind of any rapper That hears that weird ass beat ain't just walking in and killing It, Cole, Ish different. I'm not fucking with it. I just Don't think he's proven it to people that need to know it. He could be trying to prove it to himself like, like Yo I want, It is a It is a personal Yo I want Don. Wanna like Nigga I don't wanna leave no stone unturned.


didn. And that's My issue. didn didn. You Think Jaewon Cole. You think Jaewon Jaewon Cole don't know that he's one of the best rappers in the world of No, but I wanna leave It without a doubt. Bye because everybody's That is shit. Has Listen. Listen. Sometimes you get the Yeah, but you ain't didn this. I want I. Don't even wanna leave that stone unturned. That is My issue. I don't want no criticism out. There to say This shit. This shit That. He Don't have to do That though. He we speaking for he can't do it. That boat Ish over Yeah Let It, it just, it It. It does nothing. let, it ain't like he's rapping with other niggas who's on his level and fuck the They can't do That. No, fuck no. Fuck the pockets that they're reaching. Let's just get to the rapping part. There it ain't let, he's challenged in that part. Dog Now him finding nigga niggas On his level. not many What.


You mean I'm and I rap with the niggas on My level too and The nigga he's rapping with on but they're not going in challenging pockets. It's just like Oh. It is cool. Exactly because they can't like I'm gonna go over Here and show her that I could do What. Y'all can't do the rest of I can still get on the record. Y'all The rest of My point. Ish for the second verse. Y'all let t Real, let's get to the second verse To it. Me. Oh genius letting us breathe. Say stop me. I. Love the arrangement. I Love everything. About. This I do Y nigga me. Y ain't y ain stopping me.


Yeah. Alright. right? I just wanted to bring that back a little bit. Oh, wait, I didn. That, Right Y niggas ain't stopping me. Here we go Y nigga ain. Stop. Y nigga ain't stop. See even without the dead president I feel let this could Have been fired. Yeah. I. we I agree. That would be My My thing. I'm not even mad if you used the loop as an inspiration point and build around it. let they didn. didn wouldn't take the sample out Your Right. Oh button cold flows. Reverse time to find deliveries good as mine. You Got search primes I'm scared. Heights hide and birds can perch trying to be something hoping That Peace comes to My Curse mind one thing's for sure.


That I let matured from My first rhyme. I learned long ago, you can't please them all in that hurts trying in this game where all you've got Ish your name like dirt, I, smirking at niggas trying to be smirch mind of some times. But the fake get told it as wise I could see hating both of your eyes. But the third, so you search signs but you struggle, which explains the puzzle. Look, go faces the word finds. I hate What raps come go. not signs not get. It is About to go. They instigate the fuck read because It is profitable. But singer, stop the violence tools from dudes in hospitals. I pulled the plug because I let seen where that was About to go. They wanted blood, they wanted clicks to make They pockets grow. They see this fire in My Pen. They I dodge it. Smoke. I wouldn't have lost a bat Dog.


I would've lost the bro. Someone What's that? Someone say What. you Don know whatever's on your mind. I see a lot of people sucking their teeth and shaking their head. Just wait, this Ish the part That he loses me on. Yeah, this Ish the part That. He loses a lot of people on. Keep explain Ish the part he loses me on. Why? Because he why Cherish had to say That. He cherishes friendships. You didn't have to say like that's What it sound let to me. Who said I'm not mad at telling the story. I'm not mad at him. He able to share his participation and his thought process on everything that went on. I feel like didn be Cherishes Friendships.


Yeah. I'd be a hypocrite if I said that. So please, Bye all means share. What. You want to share don, don I? Just think that it's bullshit. He made a distract It. First of all, don don believe It and put It put it out. Why? don? don? Why I don't believe It. I don't believe It at all. I'm over the explaining of his self. Yeah, I don't want to hear it. Let, it's no reason to. And I feel like that's how we got a lot of these features. He's Doing. We got the KOD projects where he's different. He's, he's listening to the fans on social media saying he ain't Doing this. He's s not Doing that and he's jumping in. Then he didn't explain himself. He explained himself. He didn't go at like, bro, just stop. Get off of social media and do What. You do. You're over explained.


That's the whole reason he even went at Kendrick. He Let the fans come and go. He responded before Drake. This Ish My thing. This Ish My thing. And I'm not gonna tell nobody to get off social media 'cause I do enjoy people rapping. What. They feel I do Ish. That What, they feel if It is in inspired Bye social media, Yeah It still could be because It is, It is your, It is your interpretation of What. You We He told, said, Reading, seeing, or thinking. This Ish My problem with the cold shit. Cole, When, the whole big three stuff was going on for over a decade. This verse cements to me, That.


You We just excited to be in that conversation. You didn't care About the placement. And for a long time the fans never asserted a placement on anybody. It was kind of just a thing. That was known or not known. The big three, Ish, Drake, Kendrick Jaewon, Cole. So Now this verse to me just says, all right, Cole was perfectly fine with that framing of things. I think That It was a little naive to think That. The other two felt the same way. They clearly didn not At no point at the mention of the big three didn, the other two ever feel like, yo, that's dope.


All three of us Ish the big three. Okay. No one wanted to be bro. No, I'm just saying but Okay. Okay. Yeah, but That is fits Cole. Sahe wanna be bro. That is fits. Who He ain though that fits who he Ish or who He ain shown us to be. I mean He ain. Just humble talking About let yo j Just the fact that I'm mentioned with the two best dudes in the game. Humbleness and I'm in that conversation. Yes Ish, a accolade in itself to me Okay at, at, at at. Cool for him. But the people That, we arguing on Jaewon Cole's behalf in That top three conversation which he didn't ask. That, That, What, Okay. I'm not talking About that I'm just talking About. What's What has gone on. Okay go ahead. They We never saying, yo That is dope. That Cole Ish involved in That. They We saying Cole's number one Okay And his reps, he was Also saying he was number One.


That was my next point. That was Cole saying I want to be, I am gonna be number one. I Want all the smoke. Ah, yeah. But before he got on that, his fans were saying, and Wait and, but wait and Yeah, but I don't give a fuck about that. I I can't. I'm talking to your, your the heart of MCs now. Like, so you could try to paint this away for fans talking about niggas do, niggas is doing this for the bots mean people and the bots and that other side of hip hop. We not on that side dog. We not on that side. Before that side was really a thing. Those other two in the big three wanted to kill each other and fight for number one. And you presented yourself as someone that wanted to do the same so you could still rap.


Great. This is incredible rapping. But also to be number one, you gotta maybe take somebody head off or do something. That is not gonna feel the greatest. It gotta be a competitive thing at some point. And and I think that he looked at it and then, and after this especially, he got some reflection and said, yo, the risk is not worth the reward. I also have a retort to that. I think de you could also become number one by ignoring all that shit and just killing shit and pushing forward. No, but When you keep Do that, I agree. Fuck the internet as long as else ain't That is That is true. Fuck That Yo, no I ain't so on that. That ain't said enough. Fuck the internet. Stop reading the comments man. Well that's Not true.


That was my point. It's true Don, don Critical when you Fuck the internet. Yeah, That's how we got certain features. That was my whole point as a Cole fan, bro. Fuck what the niggas who aren't your real fans are saying rap for you and for your fans. You're rapping to please n you can't please everybody. And the sooner he realized that, the better off he'll be. And he just said that and this now, and I think the realization came after This shit. He's saying, yo, now I realize you can't please everybody. You should have realized that months ago. That's Not for you to say that's for anybody. That in real time, if anybody out there that's listening, yo, maybe you never heard it before. You can't please everybody. True.


Why? You gotta be sarcastic. That's the whole reason his fan was Sarcastic. That's a true thing. But don't, don't get on no fucking song as he ain't no young hush puppy. Don't get on the song and now tell me I learned after this. You can't please everybody nigga knock it off. That is, that's not what you was on. That's not what you was on. I'm not buying shit. That's what you was on. That's not what you was on. Even even in that seven minute drill record that he put out that he deleted, he was talking like, I can take your fucking heads off Kendrick. I I I'm better than you. I'm better now. It is, I'm just glad to be here. I think. I think, I think I don't want to hear that shit bro Hear. I think he got a hold. I think he got a hold of what Kendrick was gonna talk about when he was gonna call Drake. You know, or the, It didn't have to go there. The news that he called Drake the pedophile and all that shit.


I think Cole got a win of that and just said, I'm removing myself from that. That shit gonna Be messy. We being phone and and you know what I'm mad at too and then I'll toss right to you. Ish. If I'm Kendrick don't get on no song making it sound like I was the one whose emotions was ever in jeopardy. Bye, none of This shit. I've been consistent in My point since That Big Sean. Shit. What, Ish. Control, control, control. I want to kill all you niggas. Whether we friendly or not. That has been My position. It ain't me. So Now that makes it sound like this. Ish some type of Drake. Public pandering. And then we get to a eight bar solo of Drake public pandering where you are addressing What.


I. Don't wanna say internet narratives 'cause somebody might really feel let this, see we be saying shit as an internet narrative. When niggas might really be Feeling a way and the internet just happened to notice it's possible. Could be. That's another thing in 2025 that need to go Internet narratives. I'm sick of That, it's over for that. Niggas be Feeling a way and the internet sees It I. Don't think this Ish him. Jaewon Cole's never come off that way to me as the guy that reply to internet errors. So I don't think this Ish some new and as somebody That is still want the cold hold tea. I don't wanna hear About. No fucking cold Drake I don't care. you Don care. I don't care.


About these two niggas the rest of the world does. And he's reading it on a daily basis. The rest of the world cares. You may not care. That's That is, that's valid. The rest of the world cares. This boy's probably been under mad pressure for the last four or five months. Drake the rest of the world or Drake because which one are you trying it coming to? Drake Kids And It Could be both and Drake probably made him. It Could be Both. He probably know that Drake feels a way and he responded 'cause that was his man. Sometimes When a nigga do a lot for you. You have to reiterate that to Let him know nigga I am aware of What. You didn for me And I don't mind saying It publicly. See I'm off that too. Cole. No I'm off that too. No, No me nigga I said me. Oh, you don't tell me how to be you. Paw me, paw me. He Could call him Some niggas, nigga. Yeah, but you call some nigga just don't want the private call nigga. I want the I want the verbal apology.


Apology apology. You back this What Ish. He publicly then That's a bitch. Hold on, lemme ask you no is s not no Let. Ask This. That is a bitch. What Ish. He publicly apologizing to him for For not having his back during for not no. It is funny. Me She. Oh My fuck are these niggas talking About. What seem like not having his back. When it When When. Kendrick was kicking his back in and Kendrick said in the line, you didn Cole foul and not responding at a timely matter. So When, he could have came out and said, yo Nah Drake never didn me foul. So he didn It Now What. He didn the right thing He ain supposed to do for his man. What. Ish. They What didn. He never turned on Drake. He disked Kendrick as We. He disked Kendrick first. What the fuck Ish. He Apologizing I saying Kenrick, He got on a public stage. Kendrick biggest record, he said didn, Cole Foul. You remember That part Yes.


But he got on a public stage and said, yo, I'm apologizing to you My nigga, blah blah blah blah blah. The Kendrick, because He said What, he didn was some bogus shit. What the fuck Ish, he apologizing to Drake for we Don't know the behind the scenes shit that he might feel guilty for. That is valid, valid question. Or it could be like, like It said, When, he got on stage. That s not valid question. He got on stage and didn all that apologizing to Kendrick. I, Love, Love, you Kendrick, Kendrick, Kendrick Drake can feel away Okay. So you wanna make He ain a trust Drake and that shit man. And call it a bitch. let It is sometimes you cheat behind your girl back. You make it up privately and She wants the public display of true. Yo tell 'em you didn me wrong and we back. right? But get the fuck outta Here with This shit. And guess What nigga are and guess What. Guess What. Most niggas do that. What go publicly man, baby baby baby.


You the greatest thing in My life, blah blah blah. I'm lost in the world without you and all That other shit publicly. You wanna see one? No. Awesome. And Now all, all of that dude, all of his bitches reserve the right to look at 'em different Fuck them. Which Ish, What, Jaewon, Cole Ish. Which which Cole It is What. Cole. Ish saying Yeah. But that's My problem. What do you mean you Finally free That dismisses all accountability from the part that he has played. That's true in the big three debacle. I agree with That. What do you mean you Finally free as if you never wanted parts of the big three conversation Or That is a load of crack. Hold, hold, hold. And I'm not gonna Let you nigga just hold up, hold up, piss on me and tell me it's raining.


Get the fuck outta Here. He could have wanted parts of That and then saw where it was going. It is I don't wanna deal with This shit no more. Y'all can apologize. Y'all can have all all that big three shit. Or be honest. Yo go sit your ass over There with Sunshine Anderson. No. And the rest of the people That changed their mind. Now y nigga don't pop back up and say if I would've, I could've but then I would've lost nigga. No, not over dead presidents. Yo the nigga. That's where I agree with Parks. You ever heard that President's? Yo the nigga was holding his man's hand at the hospital bed saying, I'm gonna kill them niggas for you. Get the fuck outta Here for this soft shit. I hate this soft hip hope shit. It is stared call It What. It is these hip hope niggas. Ish Feeling like hoes out Here. That's regrets.


But I got your boy. No, it's their presence. That's s not true. It is their present. They made up My that don don you right? I you right, right, right is their presence. But yo, these niggas out Here are hoes and bitches. I was just About to agree with you until these niggas are hoes having the having to cater to the feelings of niggas. That. They don't invite to Thanksgiving to Christmas to New Don. No you. Don you don don That. I'm joking for me, y'all Don know It. Oh nigga speak for y'all. So you Don know so you know it.

They could think whatever they want too, though. This nigga Ish, he might. We just in a beneficial business to work together.


We in a beneficial business to where It is smoke and mirror and we not allowed to say none of What really Ish. And if we didn, the whole thing would come tumbling down like Jenga and London Bridge. I don't want to hear This shit. I don't. not over dead president, not this part. I I and and I was the brand and My caveat, exceptional rapping fact. I'm saying two different points. True. This Ish exceptional rapping and this whole little Drake, y'all fans and the memes portion. Ish My favorite pocket that he get in. Yeah, he didn, he went crazy. It's My favorite pocket. So these are two in these points are independent of one another. Ish, all I'm saying true Let ask you a question. Do you think this Ish more y'all bag than mine?


right? But do you think That, Jaewon Cole from Inception didn't really even want fuck with that? I just want to be acknowledged for What. I am I'm grateful. That, I'm up Here mentioning with the big three and Now, I'm letting peer pressure and society make me go down this road of nigga I could I I. He ain't never really want to engage in That at all. Maybe I can't speak for him. Maybe He ain been saying he was number one Okay. He's Been Yeah, but that That Could have been false bravado. Yeah. It could be I'm the number one rapper or Real. No, It very much could have been false. Bravado. Okay, but Now that you have the opportunity to stand in it. You didn't lean in it. No I don't want to lean in it because Now I have to literally go. Exactly, bro, yo, we fronting right? Now, We, What What. We wanna see as Hip hope fans look good What, we want see Ish Hip hope fans.


We don't want to just see these niggas out Rapp each other because Now, it's gonna still be subjective parts could say yo I out. He outra him. He could say I I rapped him. We want the carnage, we want the blood as fans. Y no we do That. s not true. That is bro. That is y'all talking for this Six niggas. We talking About for the masses. The Maddie not, Maybe not you, maybe not you. We want the fucking carnage in the blood and he wasn't willing to get into the fucking octagon and do It. The Masses. we mess. But he didn.

And he said, and K, climb. You know What come on mind. Yeah, My bad My bad I don't even wanna punch you.


And if we saw that in the UFC fight, we would laugh at the nigga. There's a clip going around of somebody round one bang walking out. There Doing this and Homeboy walked in the center ring, he turned right, right around. He turned around and walk and retired. He turned right around, walked out and left. We we would, we laughed. We laughed at that. He ain't going to get to come and re repurpose some shit and reframe What the fuck we all was There for and forgot. About. See that's the other thing. This shit. Ish a dead issue. It's moot. It is just not moot behind the scenes. Or it might be moot to us, but not moot to him. My, nigga, we don't know What, this boy's getting in his fucking dms on a daily basis or getting behind the scenes on a daily basis. Why DM m? right? So you know What, he might feel like you need to address it. Why you reading your dm? Everybody Reading dm. Why you addressing your dms?

we Mike What Mike in basketball. Some nigga Ish way more talented than other niggas. But they don't have the killer. They don't have the Kobe in them. They might have all the act, the actual skills in the world, but they don't have the mental fortitude to try and be the best and kill niggas. That don't mean they not great basketball players. Some niggas don't want the last shot. We force them in the media to take the last shot. And I let seen, seen this over our life. Them same niggas do not run out There and say Hey. I wanna be the best before this. Ish all done. Yes. They do. They shut the fuck they fuck They Don. Yes. They do. No, they Don. They Don Yes. They do. They do not. They You take the public scrutiny.

I'm saying and I'm saying that we are not in his position, so we can't, he say She shouldn't be because niggas up Here have been manipulated. Bye niggas on the fucking internet. No. And and on top of that, a lot of times I Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Not lemme just clear, clear the record. Now I Engaged with niggas 'cause I enjoy Doing. That. Yeah. A lot of times you may feel a way and the internet may heighten It.


You may have felt that way internally. And then When, you read It, you be let I felt That way. This Ish how I was Feeling and Now. They're seeing how I'm Feeling. So Let me address it. That happens. I believe that's bitch made behavior. God. Now. What. No, it's s not Got. it That is but I. I. Hear you I believe That to be that. Because if you felt that way, you should have addressed It. Yeah. Before the internet even made it a thing. Yeah. And that's My whole point. Agree as a Cole thing. I agree with that. You've been saying you the best you want to be submitted for this and That again, you fucking have the opportunity to do it. And When it comes to show Now. It is I Can't Let y'all niggas gas me.

The rest of I Would've gained a foe and off of What just to attain some old crops from strangers. That. don, don got a clue. I let been Aiming fo. That's the other thing.

Love the beat. I. Love the hook. I Love the kids. I. Love the chords. I. Love the flip. I just Love everything. Except let that the words I just I hate the message. I hate. He said the end I hate that part of the end that he's killing. See he's trying to trick me with great rapping because he, yeah, he Ish a great rapper. But It is, but It is fuckery. I just want let, let yo for me personally, you you, you left the battle. You didn't want no parts to That. Cool I just want you to completely leave it alone.


Get to the rapping that we know you to be great for. You know What, I'm saying you wanna knock out some more features. Cool. I want the fall off you Don need need nothing else from I. Feel like we're getting the fuck we got the fall off. Oh Shit. Yo I say all the time. That rappers have to be careful of how they title albums. I say That all the time. That words have meaning and we could album title some shit to life. Hmm. let, I'm ready for the fall off too. And I ref the album. right. And I refuse to believe that Cole didn't realize he was better off not addressing anything from the battle. I don't believe that I think Cole knew if he got on There on a dope beat with a dope hook and some dope rapping and just put it out, then he'd have been in a better position than this.


He knew that and still didn this. You think he knows That? Yeah, he I. Think he do. He knew That I think he does. For sure he knew That. He ain't that dumb. I. I think he You don don't get this big He that though I really think this was just, he had to make sure he sent this message to Drake. He see everything that's going on. Hey, hold on. Dog I don't have no problems with you Hey. For all we know Drake might not be texting a nigga back. True nigga Don respond. I Mike can't you ain I Mike can't reach you because Hey, you, you this verse fucking with nobody. You don't respond to me. I, Mike. This you Now. This verse sound like That this verse sound. let That, even if that's s not the case, this sound like this. Ish My only way to reach you and I just want you to hear this, that I don't have I don't want no problem with you. I'm appreciative of everything. You didn Thank. you don't Let them.


People gas you into the thinking. We got something. Or My end I don't have anything. we That is What It. let Drake liked didn. And that's back to My point. I didn. That's back to My point. If I gotta type, put a message in a bottle and throw it in the ocean to get to you. I ain't About to keep calling you My friend. We ain't friends. All this fucking fake fancy friendship bullshit. Stop. It. It is over for that. It's 2025 Everybody that works in the music business has gotten fired. Nobody knows how music will be consumed for the next how many years. And none of y'all are making money from music. Of course I'm not talking About the big three, right? And Now, they're devaluing it More Bye Fucking dropping on Instagram. What do Y. What do y'all What, do y'all think About That aspect of this?


It's Disgusting. I get that there's a deal with Interscope or Universal, whoever. Universal with Meta. Yeah, I, but I. Think When the top of the heap. That can play around with free shit sets a trend. It is bad for everyone else. Why? Because everyone don't have a deal with Instagram. So if Now, that's where the expectation Ish to get new music. The people That don't monetize from it are going to be making less than they're making Now off of fucking DSPs. Which Ish next to nothing. I don't feel like Universal cares. I know evidently I. They don don and That and they haven't cared for the last how many, every years they control most of the musicians they have the deal with Meta That includes Drake, sometimes Kendrick, if he's leasing through Interscope, let he didn during that battle.


And Jaewon Cole, Do y'all know the specifics of the deal? like And take to no We? Ain't nobody didn didn't TikTok to Universal suck they Dick? No, no. They Agreement Universal told TikTok to suck they Dick I thought they still was beefing. No I think They came to a no, they came back. No, they fixed it. They Yeah. Oh the music Ish back. They they fixed it. I think. I think the TikTok came back to the table and changed some things. I think universal. Ish moving. let Universal I think they moving let we control everything. And What, we don't control. My son controls some of It, we Doing things this way. The foreseeable future, this Ish how we make our money. Anything besides That, we cutting budgets.


A cutting people from, that's it, bro. From a and I know this sounds bad, but from a business standpoint, This shit, Ish genius. Look how many hundreds of millions of users Ish Ish over There with meta apps. Whether It be Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, all of This shit. like yeah, if I can cut a deal with you, That gets My music scene right To your, I'm not mad at It is as an early drop. But let put it on where I can Bye It and download it. Yeah 'cause I would let to purchase Port. Antonio Yeah And When. The party dies and All This Shit. Yeah all This shit. And I mean Listen. Phil, have you want, this may be great for the music business. I'm always speaking for the business of music. Two different things.


They About to condition people on how to receive new music from the biggest acts. They didn it already. It is It is this Ish streaming all over again? I had a conversation with a bunch of folks yesterday and where we was at, you was outside. No, no, no. It is on Twitter conversation. Okay. But we was talking About. You know, y'all know I don't stream I, I still purchase I download, et cetera. Same. Do both the actual for the actual files, I do both. So Everybody like who used to do This shit and put music on your iPods, they don't remember how to do It. True Because You've been conditioned to get it through streaming. like, wait, how, how I I forgot how to take a MP three and and load it on My phone or put it over Here I don't remember how because I've gone so many years of just press the button.


So Now, you scroll all day on Instagram. I don't even have to open a, a Spotify a title or whatever. I can get My new music, right? Here people, the masters are gonna roll with that and I, they're gonna be happy to roll with That. good and I. Think this Ish some low key beef with TikTok. Yeah, Yeah I. Think this Ish Alright, right? We're gonna partner up over Here for Yeah. They're playing billion Dollar games. let let games like so Now, y'all don't really wanna play with us. All right, we going to X y'all out. We gonna give meta the functionality to potentially start creating some TikTok type shit. Oh, sorry, sorry. And XY all niggas out. That's What I. Think I I. don don. Really think That like I I. Just think It is against Smart business. I think it's bad for the, the trendsetters in the business to dive in I. Think It. It's scary for for Everybody else. Gotcha. Yeah. I think it's scary for, and again, the, the functionality of Instagram in terms of playing the music s not great.


If you could, if you could Oh, they'll fix that. If you yeah, maybe they'll fix That quick. It'll be a whole, it'll be a little button at the bottom. Player. Yeah, Yeah and I think they'll take care of that immediately. From, from a business perspective. I Also think that for the artists, this may be a way to see how engaged, how direct to consumer music might work. What, Do you think the profit margin would be on that? Because if you got 7.3 million followers, What, are you gaining What? Would you receive from that? let from As an artist Yeah as artists. Oh. Shit, we don don know Now numbers because sure university's Doing, It. But if Joe, let's say Joe put out a out a song, right? Now. And he could, he found a way to monetize the song Joe button.com and Joe just put out two songs and he sold the songs for a dollar Yeah.


He might make a million dollars in two days. You get What. I'm saying like, so I think that if, if the the, if the artists are putting the songs directly to Instagram, It is gonna give them a gauge on What they would possibly achieve if they put it out directly to consumer. not, but they can Everybody can't put it out. not a university deal. not, not saying they can't I know. Yeah, I'm saying but in the future, like if I get out My deal I, remember What I was Doing, When I was releasing My shit. Would your Instagram be considered your intellectual property? No. No. You conditions When. You, you click accept When, you click accept on Terms of no I conditions. No, I'm saying, I'm saying in terms for those of the artists who are signed to these labels, so say a Cole, Kendrick, whoever When, they drop their project or their record through the app, right? Will It then in turn and say 7 million followers s 5 million of your followers Bye that record because of the guidelines?


Would it have to be your label, get a percentage of That? Or would you receive all of That? Your label's gonna get We. Universal Ish with Universal and Meta. we Listen I. Don't Let that Initially, initially When the art artist was Doing that and TikTok and Instagram was helping artists songs go viral without the label. Once the label sensed that and realized that jumped thing, they became a part of that. So then Now things have changed drastically. Trick y. Yep. Yep. Gotcha, gotcha fool. Another gotcha. Yeah. Yep. Gotcha. Bitch. We just gonna keep fighting. About the big three though, Right? Same shit. I mean it, It is all goes back to Vince's. Vince's Point. Vince Ish a Genius.

So remember a couple years ago it, it came out that Instagram was prioritizing reels. let, if you put a regular picture post up Yeah, it doesn't get the same visibility that a reel does. Somebody went to a conference a couple days ago and it was explained up There that Now, What, Instagram, Ish, Doing, Ish. If you attach music to your post, that's getting the, the more, more visibility Now because again, they got this music deal that they're trying to push out.
