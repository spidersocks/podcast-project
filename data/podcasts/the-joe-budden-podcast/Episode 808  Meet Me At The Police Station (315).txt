Shit, that shit was tempted in a motherfucker. I about surprise us one time I had a dirty ass nine. I never forget. I said, oh, didn didn't do it. I Fucking, when I was in my twenties and I was in court with Trey mom fighting for visitation and this is when I first was introduced to this at the precinct concept. He was like, all right, you can have your son on this day. Hey, pick him up from the precinct.


I was like, wait, what? That don't sound healthy at all for my child's state of mind. It really don't. But anyway, that was what it was. Like. I couldn't fight it. So I was picking Trey up from the precinct being punctual, nigga that mean that I'm there at least 15, 20, sometimes 25 minutes just sitting inside a precinct. Ask Joe what? That's yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, that's crazy. That's Joe. That's crazy. She ain't give a fuck. She can't pull up mad late. Oh my God. That being punctual, shit, it really bites you in the ass.


Sometimes it can, It bites you in the ass. All right, listen, if you are tuning in for the world's shortest Playboy Cardi album review, you are in the right fucking place. We got you. Clap it up. Facts. If you are here for an in-depth album review of Playboy Cardi and the three Kendrick Lamar versus leave. Yeah. Wrong place. I did listen to the whole thing. How was it? I didn get it knew. I knew it. I'm okay. I'm okay with it not being for me. I never heard I'm, If I'm too old for it, I'm okay with that.


Why'd you listen to it word that shit like an hour and plus and it dropped at seven 30. 30 joints. It was 30 joints. There's a couple joints I like on there. The Young Thug record is dope. There's some production on There. One of the future records Is dope. I'm talking shit. But outta what I breeze through on the sample, there is some production on there that that's all right. There's a couple shits on there. It is him for me, so I can't, I can't listen to it. I wasn't trying to listen to it. That's for the Cardi fans. I'm old outta mind. I'm not the demo for this. I wasn't Even, I even like that though because it's almost like I equate it to like, as someone who likes rock music, there's a lot of like heavy metal shit. That just ain't for me.


It is not because I was old. I might've been younger than the artist at the time. It's just not for me. And this is like heavy metal rap to me. It is just, yeah. It don't in my ears. Yeah. I won't blame it on age. It's just not for me. Yeah. Everything. And, and I knew that already. We don't Have, despite the audience saying that we are, we should be unbiased and should review everything. I'm not doing that. I'm sorry. I'm telling y'all now. I'm not doing that. I'm sorry. Everything ain't for us and everything is not gonna get a deep dive from us. Shouts to the Cardi fans. Shout out to Cardi. Y'all been waiting for this album for years. He's been teasing it back and forth. Never thought it was gonna stop Like seven years. Right. It's been A minute. It's been a little time. I took five years, But yeah, four or five years.


So I'm, I'm just, you know, happy for y'all. I saw people going crazy. It was funny. I thought he was trolling again When he didn't put it out. Yeah. I knew a album had to be coming 'cause he is on a weekend tour. Yeah. So you're not going to get on that big of a tour with no new music. So true. But shouts to him. Shouts to Shout To Cardi. Y'all got it. Yeah. I'm not even, I hope y'all are happy the 30 songs in this case. Just because he only put out music every five years. Like that's not the worst thing in the world to me. It's still a long, listen, it was hard to like, I just had it under the background while I was getting ready, eating breakfast, shower and all that shit. And again, there's a couple records I like on there, but I'm probably not gonna rush back to much of it. Did you buy it? I did not. This is a streamer for me. Would you?


This is a streamer for me. Okay. I might buy a couple records. I like though, actually. Got it. I, I at least want to hear the best Kendrick verse from this thing. Do you have the album, Joe? I didn. I don't know. I don't listen. I don't know. No, I do not have the album at all. Who is he And fucking, fucking, my oldest son came over yesterday to just vibe and kick it and I tried to have like a relatable moment. I was like, Hey man, that Cardi. And I said, I said That's what your kids like. Right? I said, oh you ready for that card? This, this, this Friday. Huh? Huh? He said, pop, I don't listen to that. It's not for me. I said, oh, genetics work. You did it right.


Oh, genetics work. He said, I'm still listening to Jim Jones. Ah, I love you Buddy's my baby. Yeah. I could play the, I think good credit is the record that most people are talking about with the Luca bar and all that shit. Good Credit because now I'm about to apply for Home Depot play. Now I got, I'm saying came out Lakey down Heavy metal hip hop. Do you Want me to go right to the verse? Yes please. No, no, for sure. Please go Straight there. All respectfully with all due respect. Yeah. I don't want no smoke on my body.


What Listening to, Wait, who the fuck is this? Playboy Cardi. But Wait for my budget. I lose it on tour. I would've said fuck you too. But you knew that the list was for Okay. Have near my way. Like Usher, like usher UPS score on you niggas like Rucker dog. I'm sore because I got out the Muscle Dog Street's ready for This shit right here. I'm cool man. I'm okay with this not being For me. Yeah. I ain't gonna hold y'all. I don't even want to hear Kendrick. Yeah, I'm good. I'm salute. I'm cool. This is like when they said if you wanna hide something from black people, put it in the book. Yeah. Put it in a, yeah put put it in a card album for me. It is gonna miss me. All that shit Ain't bad. This is the thug record.


Yo. And, and listen, even the beat on the last joint, like the production sound like it's kind of all right. Not for me doing Anything just to get it wrong. Trying to see the way that This ain't that bad. This is with th and Ty, I don say s that I'm always liking Dollar Song. Yeah, Yeah. Just across the street nigga with her. I don, There's a couple shits on here that's good.


But there's a lot of, it's his voice. What I would describe Heavy Metal. I'm never Gonna hear. Yeah, I'm not gonna hear none of that though. I'm The, even the one you just played that's like, all right, It's cool. I'm still not rushing Through. I'm not gonna have It. I'm not playing. I will not hear it. It is Not gonna be in the phone. It's not going in my iTunes. There's no just will Not hear. There's no world that I'm in where I'm going to look to play that. And I don't think I'm gonna be anywhere where they're Gonna play it. Yeah, not at all. That's a fact. And I'm trying to like respectfully. I don't want that to sound like we saying something bad. I'm not shit on it. It's, yeah, It's just not, It is okay for something not be for you. I think I went through this same exact experience five years ago with this last album was like, I gotta check it out. 'cause everyone was talking about it. I was like, okay.


No, But you know what? You know where I will give him credit. Even though this is not for me. It don't sound like any rap shit that I hear out currently. Absolutely. Like it does sound very unique to him. Original. Yeah. And original. Absolutely. And that's one of my complaints about just the rappers today. Today it all sounds like recycled re regurgitated Algorithm, AI music. Basically they just giving you the layup for that ai. Get some writing Camp AI chat, GPT shit. No, they dead ass been laying up the ai. If everything sounds the same, why can't we just get a computer to do it? Yeah. You know, that's, They've spent a decade just like, oh we can just make everything easy now so that when we get the computers, no one's gonna be able to tell a difference anyway.


Like we don't get enough music for the amount of musicians that we have. Facts. Yeah. Like all week I just be in the crib thinking of artists and how much I miss them. Mm. And I, that was, that was one of my questions I wanted to ask you. Oh, you had a little Wayne question. Not about wi missing them. I was wanting to talk about Lil Wayne's evolution, right? Like Drake evolves constantly 'cause he adjusts to the time Wayne Has Wayne Evolution peaked and does the evolution come or is he trapped by his legacy? Meaning that, you know, the fans expect a certain sound. Is his sound outdated or his evolution peaked? Like if we look at Jay, Jake keeps evolving.


Jay come back and does music. He sounds good when he does it. His lifestyle also on the front screen or in front of us, shows that he's involved evolving and we wants to follow it. When it comes to Wayne as being one of the greats that changed the game at one point, has its evolution peaked? I wouldn't say peaked, but I will say Like, or is it Plateaued maybe is a better word. Is It, is it stagnant? Is it when we, when we, when we look at Wayne, right? Are we looking forward to hearing something new from him in the last house? Yes, we are. Yeah, I am. I am. I'm always looking Forward. Forward. But is It, is this sound just the same? So are you doing it because of what, so Here, here's the thing with Wayne. Wayne doesn't, Wayne's not, I mean, he has a couple records where he does it, where he gets vulnerable, gets transparent, told you about his life, shit like that.


Yeah. But for the most part, rain Wayne is just rapping Wayne's And at a high level. Yeah, no, no, that's not a, not still. Yeah, still. But what I'm saying is still Absolutely, He's, he's great at putting words together without saying much if, if that makes sense. Like I concur. Huh? I concur. And I don't, but I don't have it in me to listen to y'all lie. Just 'cause we're on a podcast today. But Wait, but Yo, Joe, Joe, before that Joe, wait both of y'all we're a liar, but hold on. Wait, wait guys, I just, Wayne's Been absolutely fucking because destroying Features for you. I wanna keep, I want to keep up with y'all real quick. Evolution to me. And when I look at, I wanna, I wanna fight with these niggas. No, you can Joe. But lemme just say that. Just please go ahead. Evolution to me, when I look at Jay, yes he can rap, he can still rap, but I think his lifestyle surrounding it, the moves that he's making in real life makes me feel his Lyrics reflect the growth of his lifestyle.


He's no longer rock rapping about selling drugs and shit like that. He Got it. So he's talking his current lifestylely evolving. So what are we looking, but That's, 'cause Jay always is talking about his life in his raps. So even from the selling drugs point, and that's what I'm saying about Wayne, Wayne wasn't really doing that. He wasn't really talking about my life. The answer to your question is yes, Wayne is peaked. Like I don't know what they're talking about. Gotcha. It's a very quick plateau. And simple Peak implies it's going down. No. Yes. What means means a plateau is up and you're Going over, let me fight with them. Go ahead. Got it. Let me have my fight with them. I don't even think y'all have a foundation to lay this argument on Wayne.


We can safely say we've seen the absolute best of, I don't give a fuck if his rhyming improves for the next five and 10 years. That moment in time where what he's doing is in sync with what the people backing him is doing is in sync with how the fans are receiving him in sync with making his best music songs choruses, performance billboard. That has happened already. I think you're talking, we Are not getting another, that whole entire run. All of the joints that we have, if Wayne go get in the booth 20 times right now, none of that's coming out. I think that you're talking about He's just doing some great rhyming.


I think you're talking about business and I'm talking about artistry. Yes and no because I think that he's still go off raps at a very high level. I think that the, the external forces of the label being behind it and being in tune with the times and all that shit. Yes. Maybe that has passed him by and that's fine. I think that his ability to rap is still a plus. Plus. I don't think that that has, I think it's plateaued your Ability to Rap. You get to a top, you keep going. It is only a certain percentage of your artistry and how it's defined. Agreed. But you, I'm not questioning his rap skills. When he did, the niggas done started something shit a year and a half ago. Anytime he get on something and raps in his focus, he goes, his rap skills will be in indisputable.


I think his peak, he encapsulates a little more than just that. Something you forgot. If you send him in the booth 20 times today, 30 times, 40 times, that's not coming outta there. I disagree. It was A moment in time. I Disagree with that. I just do It. Is That in totality as far as like what Park Said label? Like what you Said, label people behind Him. I think that Rapp, yes, I think rap all that. Yeah. But I think a lot goes into artistry when we talk about it, right? Like rapping is like riding a bike for me. It's like you having a jump shot. Ray Allen today could walk on a basketball court and make jump shots.


Yes. That is the ability to rap for rappers at this echelon, echelon, Echelon, echelon, The the echelon, the other stuff. Your song making ability, your chorus making ability, how you come off, how you're presenting yourself, how you understand, how you adapt. All of those other things that you have to have to have the world in the palm of your hands like he did at one point as you age. That goes away. You know, I think it's natural. You know, it doesn't sound like the hunger part Is Yeah. Is he trapped by his Hands? Because he might not be trying to do that Wayne. Some people get Eminem, they get to a point where Yeah, but then you peaked. I don't think, well then you peaked because if you don't even have the energy in you back the full circle moment to flip calling on me.


Yo, you've been been a little low energy. That don't mean I can't do what I do. That just mean I ain't had the energy. Hey newsflash, part of doing this and being received a certain way is having energy True. That you can get that energy back too though and get right back to where you was. I haven't seen that and we haven't seen that for a lot of years. True. But that does not mean, again, Wayne just sold his catalog for a shit ton of money. Wayne has some legal shit that he was dealing like that don't mean that he can't do it. It just means he hasn't done it. Do we? I'm not questioning his ability. I'm I It's not Kent. It's not. He is not. He is not doing it for whatever the reason I'm not in, in the man's head.


Okay. But I think that that's natural when you talk about the evolution of shit, you not supposed to still be in there that spot. That's What I'm operating in a full, that's What I'm talking about. You're not supposed to even want that same shit is that I look at Wayne, I look at Ross, I look at some of these niggas that have battled like real health issues while dominant and be like, wow, yo, they survived that they alive, they still rocking doing what they love. You see Ross having a a, a money battle with 50. Like you see niggas is alive, healthy and doing whatever they want to do. Right? That's like a fan conversation to figure out, hey, you think they still got it? You think they still like if Carter, what Carter is he on right now? This should be six Six.


I think that prime, the prime Wayne that we reminisce over and look at at with Rosy glasses was him destroying features, but they were on big records. I think he's still destroying features. He's just not, doesn't have to run the palm of his hands. Like you were saying, where every big artist with the big record is going to wane for that feature. What, What would you guys say is Wayne's magnum opus? You know, there's a CU project was Yes. There's there that's the culmination of like two or Three Magnum Opus is gonna be three. The core is gonna say two. Yeah. Okay. The core is gonna say two, but for the world it It is three. It is three. It Is three. Yeah. So, so the But wait, my secondary question would be does he regard that as his magnum opus or does he still feel like he has not made that project that will ultimately define his legacy in a pretty pink bow and he can I don know literally do nothing I don like after that.


No, I think he 100% feels like he has that project already. Joe, question Joe, do you feel like as, And it's two or three, do You, do you feel like as fans of these artists from the beginning, and I brought up Jay, because Jay is continuing to evolve with his daughter, with Beyonce. They continually to to, to take it to different levels when it comes to their life. Do you think that lifestyle wise, that plays a part in Topeka? Like when you said Wayne is still there, he shouldn't still there. You said something just now stuck where he is. Right? I think you said that, I don't know if you, if I'm quoting You right, but if we look at Jay, Jake could come out and rap. He still can rap, but his overall lifestyle is something that's impressive.


Like continue to grow. Jay Peak's album watch too. He's Yeah, but he continues to break boundaries, which doesn't pigeon hold him in a certain category. Well The di the difference with that is, so You think Wayne, because when we Look at him, lemme tell you the difference with that is Jay's always been independent in doing partnerships. So he's not tied behind bad contracts and shit like that. He has freedom. Let's look at Joe real quick. Right? That's the difference between where him and Wayne was. Look at me right after Ho No, no, wait, Lemme finish After Hole. Whereas was in such a bad position. Wayne say you number three. Well Wayne was in such a bad position where HOV had to come bail him out. I understand what you, so his levels, I also think we're talking about business shit versus artistry.


But That, but JayZ doesn't continue to make music even at the clip. Hope Wayne isn't super duper active, but he is more active than old by far. Absolutely. No, the confusion part, what I'm saying, I'm thinking 'cause this was the confusion part. That's why I get confused if I look at Joe, right? Joe was still part of Slaughter the house, but the podcast, if he was a part of Slaughter the House and he still rap, but his podcast is successful to me, Joe didn't peak. He's still evolving because now he has success. Successful podcast. You saying he's making a lot of more money. His lifestyle changes. So when we look at Wayne, we don't really see anything pertaining to his lifestyle. Maybe because he's secretive. We just hear these things. So I'm looking at the overall artist. He's secretive and he was behind some bad shit, like I said.


And oh you said, okay, that shit will fuck you up for a long time. Gotcha. If you were in a bad deal for 20 years, it's gonna take you some time to bounce back. Alright. Even if you get everything right, you know how It is already with Yeah. Shit that you've been through. I mean, it takes you a while to come back. You're saying business wise, Wayne got young money sports, they got Travis Hunter signed over there who was about to get drafted in this draft coming up. Didn didn't know that Fox, he's doing things. Fox. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So Wayne is doing things outside of music, he's just not as, It's not broadcast. Yes. Got it. Yes. And then also like other projects that you get involved in will incentivize you to wanna put all your time and energy into that. Like the example with Joe Yeah. And the podcast versus Slaughterhouse. If the podcast is paying dividends and slaughterhouse would require a whole lot of more, you know, more work and effort, but less reward than and to make.


Yeah, exactly. I understand. You just, you focus your energy on what's paying you. Thank you paying your bills. I got it. I we Got it. True indeed. Bring it Down for Man. You broke it down. Good man.

Indeed. I'm ready to get 'em all out of the way in the next 30 minutes. Let's do it, man. Let's go. Mel's A, it's a light, light Newsweek, but Dawn Richards, who was one of the founding members of En Vogue, who left the group and then went to Lucy Pearl with Raphael Sadique was videotaped. Well, she was videotaping herself in her car. And she basically said that she has been living in her car for the last three years. And well, let's just say that, you know, people had a lot to say. Jermaine Dupree jumped into the conversation. But you know, we can play the clip that we have where she, where she was talking about living in her car.


The first thing that I noticed was her fresh blowout and her nails. That, that, that was what I noticed. It was. Her hair was looking real good. You wanna be fucked up? No, not necessarily. But then she, you gotta Be, you Gotta, but then she also mentioned manager and assistant. I was like, girl, I don't even have a fucking assistant. I I'm just Yes, you do the free ones. Yes you do. Shut off the on You got a few, you got a few assistance. That's okay. Go ahead. I don't, I don you Really? No, you don't. It just, it was just a strange kind of, it just, a lot of it just didn't track. It was just really, really strange. So people were just kind of debating this, you Guys, for the past three, almost three years. I have been living in my car.


I said it. Oh my God, it's out. I've been living in my car. Oh my gosh. If you remember, if you guys were with me, what, in 2020, I did Interviews and in the interim I was living with my parents in Vegas. And that was wonderful until it wasn't. I love my mom, but she became very angry and a lot of her anger she was taking out on me. And I was her target all the time. And I was like, I can't deal with this. Like, I respect her too much. Let me get outta here. And so I was like, okay. He's like, I don't have a lot of room, but I'll make room for you.


And then when I got to his place, he actually didn't have room for Me. I just fast forwarded. Nah, he Turned into, okay, well I'm gonna put you in a hotel for the night. And that one night turned into eight months. Oh my God. You got because every apartment That I looked at, So Every week, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. I'm sorry guys. What kind of car she got? I'm sorry. Important question. I can't Donut Some of these shit's. Got some room in 'em. Yeah. Dunno. But yeah. And then Jermaine Dupre's response, I came into the lake. He was saying, let's see, It was her choice to be in the car. I saw somebody send a message and say, Jermaine, Monica, all of y'all, can y'all put some money together to help dawn out?


From my understanding, for her to speak, speak on it. The way she spoke on it, she was basically saying that she saw other people living in their vans, living in RVs, and she welcomed the idea of doing this. Somebody say her choice or limited options was her choice to be in the car. I saw somebody send a message and say, Jermaine, Monica, all of y'all, can y'all put some money together to help dawn out? From my understanding, for her to speak, speak on it, the way she spoke on it, she was basically saying that she saw other people living in their vans, living in RVs.


And she welcome the idea of doing this. Okay. Yeah. He's not wrong Man. She, she made it sound like it was something that, like, that it was, there was an appeal to it versus staying with her mom. What Do you think though? There was an appeal to it. Hold up, flip. What do you think Absolutly? Not What do you think? What do I think? What Do you think about it? About it all? I'm giving you the runway to lead with what your thoughts are about this situation. I do not know the woman, so it's really hard to, I really feel uncomfortable passing judgment. However, however, but I, Oh yeah, here it goes.


Here we go. Here we Go. However, it has been long rumored. Come on. There you go. That she's been the problem. Walk the dog. There you go. There you go. When you Talking about Walking the dog? This is as far as the problems in any situation that she No, you no, you preaching right now. Go ahead. Yes, Yes. I mean, like, you know, when it came to En Vogue, all of the ladies are wildly talented, like wildly talented, the founding members, but then that's good for the bad part. But then suddenly she was outta the group and the rumors was that she was extremely difficult to work with. So then she ends up in Lucy Pearl with Raphael Sid, similar story follows her departure. Okay.


And now we see En Vogue who's been touring forever. Like they never stop making music or touring or whatever the case is. And it would, the logical situation would be like, well, why don't you just kind of like, you know, tuck your tail and go back to the group, group and tour. Because I mean, who wouldn't want to see the founding members of En Vogue? We all would. If you're fans, that's what you wanna see. So it's just like, so there must be something preventing you from doing that. Mm. And it might be you. Yeah. It might be the bad taste that you left in their, in their mouths. Preach mail. I hit the round. So what do you think? What do you think? Hold up, hold up, man. That shit, man. Hold up man. Lemme hit the round. Fuck law for my girl Mel, with a take.


Shut the fuck up. She, she didn't run from it. No, she fucking said, said it. She said what? We all were thinking, Listen. Yeah. Oh my God. Here we go. What do you think? He's sitting In's seat. So what do you think the advantages are of living in the car? No. Hold up. We not there yet. We not there yet. Let's leave the light right where Mel Ford shined it at for two seconds. Let's do it. I know It is not the favorable thing to say. It could be viewed in bad taste without tact, without coth to say it.


You guys even It is so bad to say that. Even in the comments online, you can't say it. Not at all. So we'll say it. Let's do it. And Jermaine Debre was trying to say it, but he's too cool and classy so he wouldn't say it. But I heard it still. And we will say it nigga we gonna say it. Let him have it. Even mouth classiest as they come. Super class couldn't restrain herself at all from kind of alluding to it. But we will say it. We gonna say it. Let's talk about it. Preach.

He answered it that Dawn popped up in a civic of some shit and taped and told us, hopefully it's not civic. Wait, hopefully it's a hatchback, but wait, whatever It is. Jamma station wagon. Jermaine Dre said no, that was her idea. Like she wanted to go and live there. She said, ah. I said, I said that. I said that. I don't even think she recorded from iPhone. Yo.

No, I'm I'm, go ahead. We have other male topics.


All right. The embalmer. The embalmer. Okay. The Embalmer. So in, in most recent news, a Houston embalmer has been charged with abusing a corpse after allegedly mutilating the body of a deceased registered sex offender. She was working at a crematorium and she allegedly castrated the body of Charles Roy Rodriguez. And she took his member and apparently stuffed it in his mouth. Ha. Gender wars? I don't know. I don know where this falls in the Gender war spectrum. Gender war. I guess It is gender wars Joe.


I'm telling you it was gender war time. Alright, Parks, let me help you in the comments of this post. Weird story to come across your algorithm. Yeah, yeah, for sure. But I'm a sicko so I saw it too. Oh, okay. Well you're so, and in the comments it was thousands of women praising her free sis. What's her bail? She did the Thousand dollars. She did the right thing. Look, look, look why you know that? Because she in The article. Okay. No, I'm funding podcast right now. I Can't that, so that is what I mean when I say gender wars. There are a lot of women that are in support of what she did. So let me ask you guys. And Male ain't say that, but I feel like that's where she stands on this.


Oh, for Sure. So can I ask something to the two men here that have daughters? Oh God. Let's just say that something incredibly unfortunate ever happened to them. What would you want to do to that? Man? Mutilate the motherfucker. Thank you. Thank you myself. Thank you. So Thank You. So I don't even want nobody else to do, Let me get that. Do you think that It is entirely possible that by that some of the comments made by these women are women that have experienced some sexual abuse or It's possible. Don't start, don't start moaning now and guys dead. I said it with my motherfucking chest. The guy's dead. And it's wrong. 'cause it was the other way around.


What was the other way around? If It was the other way around, if a nigga just decided to cut some lady's tits off while she's dead. We, We But what would be the reason? Who knows? He's Whatever the reason is Because she was a a, a sexual abuser. Yeah. Well, who cares what the reason is. It's a crime. It is a crime. Oh know it's a crime. It is. It is a crime. It is. Yes. It's a crime. It is. It's A crime. It's a crime. It's A crime. But she felt, But she felt way in front of an audience or you don't do it in front of an audience. I think it speaks volume that she decided to do this in front of an audience. Well, It is two students and I think it's wrong. Do we have the ages of those students? No. They're, they didn't list the ages of the students I'm sure, but they were students basically learning mortuary.


When you say to me that can include kid Yeah, But it doesn't, probably Young adults, you can't say that because you don't know how old the person is. Even if Can't say say a do adult. I think that if they were minors, that would've Been I didn I'm not saying minors. I'm saying kid. I'm not saying kid. No, I'm saying kid. Like we say kid, which is 22. A young person. Okay, 23. You are doing this in front of a young person. I think it's sick if you're not doing it in front of a young person. I I agree. I think it's a crime. All that. I think it's shit. It is sick. Period. Shit. I, I think the same thing. There was a story that went around, somebody posted some screenshots of, of, and I I I'm hearing allegedly as fake, but somebody posted some screenshots of their 10-year-old daughter and the stepfather.


It is very inappropriately. Oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah. How If it had that be real? Yeah. The same shit should have happened to him. Hold on, hold on. Let just finish real quick. What I'm saying is we all be believing that yeah, these pedophiles and these people that fuck with kids should get this should get fucked up. I would like to be careful with that because the, on the flip side, there's a report saying that the mom set dude up. Yes. That's What I'm, but that's what, that's what I'm saying. I'm I I was saying, I said if it were real, I said that that's highlight, That's real. But that is a big problem if it's real. Right. If we're talking about castrating, whether living or dead, doing harm to someone and then you find out later that they may have been innocent or something like that fucked up, then that's, It's very fucked up.


It's very fucked up. I I I'm, I agree with you a hundred percent. I'm just talking about, we hear these stories, you know, think of the movie A time to kill. Yes. Which is based on a true story. Like we hear this shit happening where somebody just takes the law into they own hands. They get they revenge back. That was a father that had something happen to his daughter and he went out and got the motherfuckers who did it. Understood. I think as parents we would feel that way. We all would feel that way. So we can't just sit there and say, oh, that's wrong that she did that. Yes, we can. Not saying she was the parent. Yes, we can say that because there's no feelings. Feelings are never wrong. And that's where the line is, bro. You keep talking about feelings. I'm not talking about how nobody feel. I'm talking about what they did based off those feelings. I could feel however I want if I take it upon myself to now execute, said plan.


Not only am I breaking the law, but I'm a little sick in the head to do this in front of some students. I agree. Agree with that part. Hold, hold up. I'm agreeing with you. I'm just talking about the feeling of saying that this person deserve it. The feeling we not Alright, great. But great. I'm not talking about the feeling, I'm talking about the niggas. That the law is the law. So you, the actual act, you still broke a law regardless to be you are some, some people are cool with that. I'm too, some motherfuckers Listen, yo, I I'm gonna take what? Come with it. I'm too immature for this topic. I'll tell you why. Because rock out. No, not that, you know, she took the law in her own hands, I guess. Oh no. She took vigilante style. Whatever the fuck she's doing. Yeah. That's But me speaking for me as a parent and the lifestyle that I live, even though it's not great mentally, I'm going into a space of wanting revenge if my daughter is hurt Sure.


To a person that's living not, I don't, I don't, I'm not gonna call the cops even though I should, I have to get into that mind frame and that mindset. I have to change. My way of thinking is flawed and I know that instantly something happened. All right, jr we, let's let's go figure it out. It's not a good, because I think that's a, a good way Of thinking, but I think that's a natural reaction for a, for a parent. Parent. Not for all parents though. Not all, not parents will call the cops. Some parents will get, you know, would wanna Yeah. Not all, it's just you Want justice. Yeah. It's based on how you look at life. Yeah. It's also how you look at the justice system. It all, it's how you look at the justice system. Especially if your daughter is considered a minority and how little attention minor crimes against minorities get versus should she be lily white with blonde eyes or, or sorry, blonde hair and blue eyes saying, But then what happened?


Like, what laws are in place to save you from that? Right. Somebody hurts. Your child gonna seek revenge. You hurt the person. Not necessarily you have to kill them, but you're gonna get the same penalty as anybody else. You, right. Well it depends. It depends on which state. But a good defense attorney can get you off on something like a, you know, it was a moment of passion or whatever the case, a crime of passion. Temporary Insan. Temporary insanity, shit like that. Temporary, there's, there's defenses against that. A Moment of Passion when you react to something that is, you know, you were Temporarily not even thinking it was just reacting off emotion in that moment. Okay, You, you're in, you murder, But that person has nothing to Do with this. You're not related to nobody. Correct Me. Yeah. No, we, we Went off on a tangent. We, we went, that's not related, Related to this, but let's bring it back.


Okay. Bringing it back. This lady is not related to nobody. And she's in there, she's Just doing shit Teaching, supposed to be teaching people how to do things and she cut his dick off at his foundation and shoved it in his mouth. Somebody in the world loved this person. Correct. Somebody is coming to the funeral to cry over this person. Certain jobs you're not supposed to have if you're gonna just use it to fucking, If you can't separate your emotions out. Yeah. And imagine being the students, they're probably fucking, Yeah. Like I can't believe that we're doing a deep dive here about this, But Real talk. But if it takes all of us to let Mel Ford know that this is Wrong. I said, no, you no, no, no. This is wrong. Said that said this was a criminal act. I said, I stated that, Hey, Joe, but we are Even in this example, bro, that could have, let's say the embalmer was related to that, to, to the person that it still ain't gonna change.


It's still, it's still, it still wrong, legally wrong. I'm just saying that sometimes motherfuckers don't care about that legal shit and they'll just do it. And some of these niggas deserve some of that shit. Okay. Well those people have the right to, Yeah, that's all. So those people have the right to, if you are willing to bear the brunt of what comes after your actions than have at it. Yeah. You, So why you guys serious like that over the topic, nigga? 'cause you disgusted about this lady's actions because we make, she, because Mel's making an excuse for the lady's actions. It is. I didn't make an excuse. I'm not, don't disgusted though. I do think it's disgusting, but I'm not like disgusted. I do, I do agree with you in front of students. It could be children you're teaching. You have, I Would've a whole different take if she did this by herself.


Right, Me too. If she did It by itself. Yeah, I agree. And just fucking, ah, I couldn't fight it. I'm, I'm here, I'm done that. Fuck this nigga ba I would've a whole different take you doing that in front of people. I just, I don't respect it. Mm, that's fair. I don't respect it. I'm With you. That's definitely fair. Yeah. She Could have done that on her own if she, if she was so in, you know. Yeah. If It was in the rage of whatever you're feeling and Yeah. It triggered something from people. Exactly. A trigger Understand. Fine. And you, It's just showing the wrong shit to kids. You know what I'm saying? Like to students. These are people, people that are learning from you how to Evolve, not how to cut dicks off. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Sorry Mel. No, I mean it's fine. I just, you know, it was an interesting story that had like, that had a very polarizing reaction in the comments and shit like that.


So That's Good. Your chicks out there want to shove a dick. Oh yeah. I remember how, how they champion Lorena. Bob. She was a superhero. It is all right. It is alright to say it. We know it's fine. So anyways, what's Up? What else in Mel News, The high school runner who's accused of B? Exactly that one. She's accused. So no. So she's being charged with a misdemeanor. Okay. But the NAACP's coming in because they say that there is footage from a different angle that supports what she says that it was an accident. All right. Well, what I saw, well free her. I don't know. I mean, I yet to see free, But it's just interesting that she's free.


I hope the other girl gets well. Yeah. It's interesting that she Caught you should have been running in front. She should have lost. Yeah. She should have Lost her race. Yeah, she lost her step. She got you. I mean, that's it. She fucked up though. Yeah. Yeah, you did. Yeah. In NAACP is like fucking what that black lawyer named to show up to everybody house right after they son died. Ben be Benjamin Crump. Ben Crump. Yeah. We gotta talk about that nigga. Excuse me. See? Yeah. Stop it. Stop. That's why I keep my pillow. Yeah. Stop. When they start their shit. I'm ready. Yeah. Ben, Ben Benjamin, what's his name again?


Cru. He be, he be at your door before you, while your kid is on the way to the hospital. Hey, he want to be on the news. Benjamin Crump. Yeah. That niggas is getting money, boy. All right. Anyway, shout to him. What else we got? What else we got? What else we got? So Anthony Mackey was giving an interview just, Oh Yeah. This is our last male topic. Anthony Mackey. See, and he cut. He's quoted as saying the American male is dead. So Parks, I sent you the video if you wanna like play that, But he the American male. Yeah. So he What do you mean? Oh, Well y'all, I guess guess the concept of masculinity. I'm sure. So we'll listen to him All. Let's hear this Man. Let's see what old Anthony Mackey has to say.


Huh? And then Keep my boys humble. Like my boys have never had a pair of Jordans. You know, my boys don't do all that internet fly shit. I'm like your kids and no, I don't. I could be the, the biggest star in the world. Do not let me catch you being stupid. Do not. And my oldest gets it, my 15-year-old. He tell the other ones, he's Clark Yo. Don't make dad mad because once you get one that's right, he gonna straighten the other ones out. So it's, It is just that thing of in the past 20 years, we've, we've been living through the death of the American male. They have literally killed masculinity in our homes, in our communities for one reason or another.


But I raise my boys to be young men. And however you feel about that, you feel about that. Right. But my boys will always be respectful. They'll always say, Yes sir. Yes ma'am. No sir, no ma'am. They will always say Thank you. I like that. They will always open the door for a lady. There you go. They will always make sure that their mother is taken care and provided for. They will always be met. And that, that's always, since they were two years old, I, every time I left for a job, I tell my 15-year-old, you're the man of the house. You make sure these doors are locked every night this alarm is on. You text me or you call me every night before you go to bed and you wake up. I love that because we're men. If I'm not there to protect, he gotta be there to protect. 'cause you can have all the money in the world climb through the window.


That money means nothing. Right. You can have all the celebrity in the world jump through the door. That's celebrity means. No, all This sounds like much more of a conversation about being a good father than Yeah. Like American masculinity being that Nothing. I'll wait for the masculinity part. Yeah. I don't know what he, so that's what I was wondering, like what did he mean by saying over the last 20 years, like has killed the American male and the idea of masculinity, but then also when you, do you guys agree with that statement of when you leave the house, you leave your 15-year-old in charge? Is that like kind of hoisting too much responsibility on a child's shoulders? N no, I don't think so. I, I'm with him with that. I mean, I don't have a 15-year-old, you know, male in the house, but Yeah.


At, at that age I was, that's what I was, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. They expect you to be the man of the house. Yeah. Yeah. Look like shit. Like he's saying, yo, make sure the doors is locked. Make sure the alarm is on. Make sure the windows on. Like that's what he's talking About. Like going out and getting a high earning salary and No, no, no. I don't mean digging Wells Or, no, I don't mean that. I mean like being like the protector of the house. But that's like, should somebody come inside kind of thing? Like should an intruder come over? No, he's Just saying utilize, you just gotta do the, the check the fucking checks to the house before you go to bed. One of your I was left alone. Okay. All I had was dogs and cats and fucking birds and fish.


Okay. That's Who looked after me. You was in the woods somewhere too? I was not in Woods. I was in Toronto. You was in the woods of Toronto. I was living in Toronto proper. Okay. It was, it was the city. Were You in the cabin? No, I Was in fucking cabin. You How the Russians do when they come here, they go living deep in the woods. I was not in the woods. Once I deep dive here, It sounds like he was doing some great father talk. Yeah. I I think That was, that Was was gonna be Something else. It is just his statement saying the American male is dead and the idea of masculinity is dead and all that other stuff. Like, it just had people interpreting it just different Ways. Of course in this conversation. That sounds like a clickbait headline. Yeah, It is a But if you wanna talk about, is American masculinity dead? I, I don't think so. I think that there, Yes.


Okay. All, Let's hear it. Women has taken on the role of American masculinity in men and not intentionally. It's just that's what's being pushed to us because it's being highlighted that women are now the masculine one in relationships when there's still good men out there not being highlighted. And good men that believe in responsibility. And being a man in a relationship Isn't part of being a good man. Not being highlighted for being a good man. Not to be a dick. 'cause I'm not trying to be a dick and I'm not trying to harp on things. Let's, This was my fucking point with that doci straight, straight man red flag conversation. Let's go. This was the exact, It's being highlighted.


What he's saying is that yo, there are still men talk about it. Men Talk about it. Whatever your interpretation of that is. He described his, a lot of men agree with. Yeah. He just, okay. There are still men out there that's not Being erased though. You think what, what he described as being a man is being erased. No, and hold on one second here. What you're alluding, what you're alluding to, what you're alluding To, to, is I can, I can't land Know that. Tell me I'm, it's okay. You can't tell me what I'm alluding to if, if I can't Land. I, I'm basing it on your, on the last conversation that we had about this, where you landed all over the place, But we're having a new conversation and I'm, I'm making a point that connects full circle the depiction of what a man looks like.


Many people, And I said this in that doce conversation, feel that there's an erasure happening with that. So when you hear somebody say, Hey, I'm raising mine like this, like men, like some people still take pride in whatever that interpretation of man is. But to act like when you pick up a newspaper, a magazine hear from prominent black people, fucking see on tv, see in movies that that version of man is not being represented properly. Like there's a reason for it. And that doce common is part of it. She has nothing to do with this, so I don't wanna get back to her. But that's why y'all, that y'all that were like, oh, y'all making a big deal outta nothing.


Some people were making a big deal out of it because they see a different picture happening over the years. They Turned it to the other shit. Our children, I mean, we have children that we're raising and what is being, what what they're learning is not, what they're learning is on the contrary of what's happening in the home. They'll show you a man sucking another man's dick today before they show you a man acting like a man. Exactly. What Does acting Like a man mean? Acting like a man being, I keep saying that's open for your own interpretation. It is. And so Many people agree with some of the things that he laid out, which is, hey, yes, I'm 15 years old. Yes, there's older people, older women, adults in the house, but none of that matters to a man.


A man is gonna be a man at all points in time. Preach nigga. So yeah, that's, I'm with you. That's me. I'm, that's me telling my son, Hey, when you get a job at 16, this is what you do when you get paid, you take that money home. Yes. Here you live with your mom. Yes. And you be the man of the house. If you, if if there's no man in there, if she's not married, if there's nobody else there, that's your job. Yes. Make sure these bills are paid. Help mom in any way you possibly can. 'cause that's what a man does. And so for you niggas to act like they're denying era happening, I don't understand it. That male, I don't understand that male go and I on the Say, I don't feel like the Doshi conversation applies here. Because what, to me, what she was describing, she was describing her preference. And if you're saying that she's describing a type of man that lacks masculinity, then that would lend to the ar the Argument.


There's an attack on straight men. Hold On. That Was, I'm not, I'm not trying to interpret it from her. That would lend an attack that would lend on strong straight men. Period. I'm not trying to fucking read through cryptic notes about how you feel about this then that that Is the fact. Okay. You are a hundred percent correct. I told you back when we was over at Parks crib, I said, yo, if you ever want to, you ever wanna test that theory, go search straight black man on Twitter and put it in quotes. And you went and looked and was like, oh, this is pissing me off like this. That, that's just been a thing. I know, but anytime that's a thing. But that's what I'm, anytime we start hearing from somebody who might share in those views, every excuse is made for 'em.


Every excuse, every excuse is made for 'em. They start bringing up different shit that has nothing to do with the topic about, Hey, how about we stuff for over the year? Like Yeah. How about we just eliminate the excuses and say there are some people that share in the ideology that these niggas are red flags and they're dangerous and we'd rather be around a beer. Oh, I'm, that's the point of the fucking beer conversation again. It's Really not. It's really not. A man Is telling you something. Let me ask you two something. Let me tell, let me ask you two something as different as daughter having daughters. What is, what are the things that you tell Even That's the point. Oh my god, you can't hear from a man that don't have a daughter talk. Can I fucking talk? Yes. I'm sorry. And because having a daughter change your perspective on a lot of Things.


Thank you. Fucking Gary. I tell you that. Okay. But not mine. Oh my ice. But wait, that is the point Joe. Niggas don't need a daughter to qualify. We speaking as men. Joe, I hear you. I'm telling you as a man with a Daughter. We got that part. But you up, we're talking about just men. Hold I know, I know you yelling, but let No, we just talking about men. I understand that we not talking about your daughter, your mom, your sister. We got that part. This conversation started and should end with men telling you about men and the erasure of men. Yes. You don't need to speak to somebody with a daughter to see how a man feels. Speak to a fucking man. Let her shit off. No, Please.


No, you Continue shut. Please Continue. He completely shut that down. Everything that all Mel. No, because I can't respond to the dosage thing. I can't respond to the bear thing. You can't respond. I can't because, because it all, you shouldn't have to. 'cause it all factors in. It does. My fucking argument. When you keep bringing up this bear shit, it's fucking pissing me off because you are being willfully fucking obtuse. I'll take it out all. Alright, stay fucking there. You two, you have daughters. What is it that you are teaching your daughters in terms of when they go out into the world, how to conduct themselves in terms only in terms of their sense of personal safety. Who do they need to keep themselves safe from?


Who? And don't just answer the question. People. Yeah, I was gonna say the world. Okay. The world. The world. Sorry. Can you be a little bit more specific? People, Like you said It is, It is not. It's not. It's, I get, I get where you trying to go with that? I'm not sitting there. I mean I'm not at that point yet. But it's not, Hey, look out for Ben. Look out for boys. No, I can answer that. It is look out for People. Oh no. Okay. People Are Fucked up Out here today. And I'm just, and I'm just asking you two specifically. Well, Hold on. I have a 15-year-old Daughter. Yeah. She can answer better than I can. I have a 15-year-old daughter. I tell her to be on the lookout for people, jealous girls. But I also tell her to be on the lookout for older men that's trying to prey on younger girls. Okay. Offering rides and stuff like that. Okay. Is that where you're getting at? I, I, I tell her that. But that's, that's, that's a, that's what you learn in growing up and that's that some men do that.


No, I and, and that is fair. Okay. And that is fucking accurate. I can tell you stories of when I was 11 and t no, Fuck that. Eight, eight. We had a handyman that used to come to the house. And one day my father was just like, my parents worked. And my dad was literally like, he's coming to the house. Just give him the money for the work that he did, blah, blah, blah. He came to the house. I was there alone. He was drunk and he tried to do some shit to me it was fucking terrifying because I'm in my own fucking house and this is somebody that my parents fucking trusted and he came there drunk and it was really fucking bad. That is just one experience. I, there's so many more that I can talk about that happened before the age of fucking 16 years old.


The reality is, is that you can be in the safest environment and still there will be a situation that unfolds that where, where you need to teach your daughters to be careful of predatory boys and men. And I'm not talking about People I, people I know. I, because ask, ask a question. Just can I Ask you a question? Just wait one second. Anything can fucking happen. That Story about the handyman, was your dad there for that? No, he wasn't. He was, he was at work. It was during the day. It was like fucking noon or something like that, Mel. Okay. Now, so hold on on, There are systematic efforts that, that are out there to discredit and silence the I'm not, I'm not, I'm I men, I'm, I'm not talking.


But you have to acknowledge that too. I'm not, I'm not. Wait, wait, wait. Listen. You have not have to. You should acknowledge the fact that there is a movement to discredit the black man, to discredit men. The straight black man. The straight, It is not just black man, the straight black man online. They're showing that women have all this power and women are in control of the home. And the black man are notated To legislation, says different legislation with legislation that's being passed. Roe, Roe v Wade being overturned the anti-abortion laws. There is literally We talking about social media that's being fed to our children. Okay. And now if you go on here, It is always a something to discredit the black man. You know that and I know that. So that's what the point we are getting at is that there's something that's going on.


Not taking away that there's not, we know that there's predators out there. We know that there's men out here there that take advantage, but there's also a lot of great men out there that take care of their family, that provide for their children, that protect the home's Cornerstone. That's not Being highlighted Anymore. In, in no way, shape, or form. Am I fucking denying that at all? Got it. I shit all highlighted as much as possible. You don't When you say I'd rather be around a bear. Oh my God. Literally you like that. But you Don't though when you say that. No. Stop. Stop. Because the fucking bear is literally just a fucking extreme metaphor for the high rate incident rate of fucking sexual assault against women and girls. That's it. It is like fucking metaphor. Get over it.


Okay. That has nothing to do with the erasure of the concept of the straight fucking Yes. It, it has nothing to do with it. It has to do with sexual assault. Melyssa Ford. That is it. That is it. That is all. That is it. That is all. But what is it? Please, please, let me get this one. Be one word please. And we don't have to yell and get hostile here. Okay. You Don't have to do that. You're right. But I'm very frustrated by the way that hear that conversation has been handled over the course of months. And we understand that. Especially for somebody who has literally experienced it. Literally experienced it more times than I can cared Camp. Well listen forward. I'm gonna say this in closing 'cause I feel like we have rehashed the bear conversation a bunch.


That's true. But if the bear conversation is being had through the lens of only sexual assault victims and victims of sexual violence, then you have now answered a question while erasing the rest of the field of men, good men, cornerstone men, legacy building great men, you are erasing that and answering the question through the lens of trauma and pain and horrible experiences with men. So when you hear Anthony Mackey describe what It is to be a man, where is the confusion at?


We not talking about men that do that. See that nasty? We talking about men And men should be acknowledged Because we are, because the two things have nothing to fucking do with each other. Listen. Alright. Look. Look. Just wait. Okay. Just wait. I'm Done. The idea, because She not gonna get it no matter what you saying, but You, but you get it. But you, you don't get it man. You feel like you're part of the problem. 'cause you also highlighted that that pressure could be too much for the 15-year-old son. That's the first thing you went to. We are going all over the Fucking place. I'm just saying that saying listen. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just one second. But you made It. Wait, wait. Just wait, wait. One second. Wait one second. He brought up the bear. He Brought it up. Okay. This wasn't even part of the fucking conversation right now.


That was just throwing a fucking mon monkey wrench into the conversation about male masculinity. We're not, that has nothing to do with the fucking bear. Got it. That was not, It has everything to do with the erasure of men and what It is to be a man. Look. And that's a man telling you. Just, no, just wait one second. But even That, a man can't tell you nothing. Yeah man, go Ahead. There was this case that just unfolded in fucking France and her name and the woman's at the, at the, he at the helm of this case, her name is Giselle Pelico. She was 70 years old and her husband, husband spent the better part of a decade drugging her and advertising to men to come over and sexually assault her.


I understand. And she did not know it. And do you know who these men were? It there was like 50 of them. 51 of them got, you know, some form of I don know punishment. You know, legal punishment. These men were doctors, plumbers, lawyers, they were fa family men, they were grandfathers, they were all the things. The whole point is that you live, there is no face of a predator. There's no face, there is no look, there's no nothing. You can't tell. So when women are talking about sexual assault, it has nothing to do with, you know, be afraid of, you know, men because they're just scary.


It's just, there's no fucking picture as to what predatory, what pre, what a predator looks like. The predator can look like your next door fucking neighbor. The predator can look like your fucking father. The predator can be your uncle, can be your brother, can be anybody. That's the whole point. Which Is more reason for man. I'm gonna talk Jackie to describe what raising a man looks like. Joe, can I, so that he does not become a predator. Can I say something to you, Joe? What the fuck? Here's my, go ahead. Go ahead please. Yeah. Here's My thing. Yeah, Agreed. Here's my thing because that's really what we are. So we are so, we are so used to, we are so used to looking down upon black men. Not saying you're doing it, but people is because the first thing you said, And I said this when he said about what he's teaching his 15-year-old son, is that you made an excuse by saying that it's not an excuse you.


Do you think that I asked a question? Do you asked a question? Sorry, ma'am. Saying that, do You think it may be too much pressure on this child? Do you wanna Know Why we don't, we don't think that. Do you wanna know why I asked that? We Teach our boys. Do you know why? I wanna know why you, this Is why I asked it. Yes ma'am. Simple reason why. Because as black people, black women, black black men, we are forced to grow up a lot faster than we should. Okay? We are, are looked at as more mature than our years actually, you know, dictate. And that is unfair. That's unfair to both black female children and black male children. They should be able and they should be allowed to have a childhood, full childhood.


A full childhood. That was the only reason why I asked. Had nothing to do with him making a poor Decision. That I, I don get that because on the flip side, it'd be, it it the flip side of that be the, the girl that is maybe 4, 13 14. And you gotta take care of your siblings now. Yeah. You're, you're being forced to be Society because that's, that's some of the po that's some of the positions I and I un that society afford To people. Wait, I, and I understand that, but Anthony Mackey is very, very rich. He has a lot of money. He has a lot of access to things. I'm just talking about him specifically. Okay. Got, I'm not talking about, you know, say the single mom who's got several children and there we go. And she's gotta work two jobs. And Yes. Then she relies on her children. And I understand that. I'm not talking, Is that an exception? Do you give that an exception?


And I will give him that he's an ex he could be considered an exception to the rule. That was the only reason why I asked that question. It wasn't too much and it had nothing. And it had nothing to do with, you know, the concept of masculinity being bastardized or forced upon him too early. No. It's just like, he's still kind of a kid and he should be able to be a kid. That's the only reason why I asked it. Do, do you know what it's like? Do you, in closing for me, when we say be a kid, right? People used to say that pertaining to me and my son. 'cause I teach him the same values of being a man. Do you know as soon as you let you take that hand off and let them be a kid? They do. They, they succumb to peer pressure. They do stupid shit that kids do. They forget the guidance and the, and the rules that you instill in them.


So like when we say let them be a kid, what does that de what does that entail? Right. Let them be a kid. Being a kid, cool. You can have fun, but it comes to some rules and, and regulations when it comes to being a kid. You can't just let a kid be a kid. Okay. I mean this is a whole separate conversation. But I, I wanna say that 'cause I hear that a lot and I'm a prime example of, oh, let 'em be a kid and taking that off. Let let them Be and then, and then, and then shit go haywire. Look, let, letting them be a kid don't necessarily mean taking a hand off. They just talk about putting the added responsibility on the kid. That ain't necessarily, you can still have your rules in, you know, I'm the way you're guiding this kid. Got it. And let them grow up without basically being a parent or, or the father of the house.


Okay. Both, both can happen. I Feel like, you know, in, in, in closing, I feel please somebody close. Get outta Here. Okay. I was just gonna say, I feel like you know that I had a lot of responsibility put on my shoulders way too early. I wasn't allowed to be a kid. Like for as long as I should have been, I wasn't allowed. And so that's the only reason why I asked the question. It had nothing to do with the concept. Masculine. Look how you became, Look at what you became. Look at it. Smart, intellectual. Yeah. Focused, determined. Yeah. Like highlight the positivities of that. It's Great. Can I add that? It's, it's it. I will, but go on, go. No, I think it's great. I think, you know, like Successful Y Yes. But it was yeah. Beautiful. Strong, resilient. Yes.


Thank you. Come on. Come on. Thank you. Come on. Thank you. Lemme think of some more adjectives. Fucking one of the brightest. One of the fucking strongest, extremely Resilient to me. With Most will determined. Yeah. Oh, Thanks Mom and dad. There you go. There you go. Or there you Go. Okay. All right. Moving right along. Yo, this, this show's crazy S that I'm a man nigga.

I'm just Saying if You, that's the one I called you for. I just was getting triggered off of Mel's reactions to Anthony Mackey. 'cause then I just started hearing all of this shit from the doci and the bear and I just started hearing it all. And my thing is like, go speak to men. No, and here's the thing is If you go speak to men, like if you change the beer pole into like a man positive pole, like to really gain information, like plenty men feel like that or that there's no room to talk or speak because we play the clips all the time of we gotta just tuck it, keep it moving, be a man, protect, serve, provide for all of this shit that comes with being a man.


There's also plenty of men that feel horrible, that women feel like she feels For sure. Because that's being a man. I think that's part of being a man. Yeah. That's the main part of being a man. Like, damn, that's fucked up. That you would rather be with a fucking potentially vicious animal than being with a man Because y'all can't tell. Yeah. Okay. But but her thing is saying that it's an extreme male, this thing, it's extreme. And as adults we could differentiate it. But what about the people that we're trying to teach that can't? About what about the young women? Yeah, the young women that may think like, oh, well, I mean like Here's the, this Is a possibility. Here's the thing is like a bunch of guys we're also polled and okay. And there was either guys who were like, what the fuck are you talking about? And other guys that were like, yeah, I totally understand what the concept of this Metaphor is. Yeah. I we had the discussion.

She, so Mel is purposely trying to trigger me this episode. I'm Not She trying to get you back. Yeah. Yeah. She's doing something to me. Why, Why don't exp No, no, no. What? But Let let her expound. Why do you think that she's incomp? Why do you choose that age? Why do you think that a 60-year-old hones in on 25 year olds and saying I'm in direct competition with you.


Why do you think that that is? 'cause that's fucking weird. One, because the 60 year olds are not the demo that made BBLs famous and popular two because the 20, because the 60 year olds are going after the same men. That 25 year olds are going after facts. That puts you in direct competition with 25 year olds. I think that that's an assumption on your part. Wait, Which part? That they're going for the same men that 25 year olds are going for. I think that's an assumption. We Have proof. See that they're going after the same men. That's not me assuming. Okay. We, we have proof of that shit. Okay, so Bill Belichick Got a 20 so year old. They all are going after the, the the the 25-year-old.


That's fucking gross by the way. But it's happening. But hold on. So how Old is Madonna's boyfriend? Like Cher's, Cher's boyfriend's like 36. Madonna's boyfriend is younger than that. Like This? Yeah, it's a 28 or something like That. There's plenty of points that say they're in competition with the 25-year-old female. But that's not to say that the average 60-year-old, old wants a 28 or 35 or 36 year Old's. We're not talking about the average though. Okay. We talking about them. I don't think the average 60-year-old is going to get a bbl l Yeah, we're not talking about the average. I don't know. I see bus drivers with fucking BBLs and like they're fucking 50 When do see Bus shit like that. That's just little bus shit all doing. That's that cushion. Yeah. That's as cushion.

You see, you know, quote unquote regular women cops, bus drivers, whatever, that's fake. Who, who like to show the side by side of what she looks like during the day and what she looks like during the evening. Women in military clothing versus Those women are not typically 60 years old. Okay. But 40 years old. 50 Years old. The was talking about on the, on the last episode, fat, fat cop with the fat ass. I mean, she's in this conversation, but she's not 60 years old. She's not 60 years old. She's got the cake. Listen, Don't need a bbl. We are, we are projecting onto Vivica.


We're projecting the fact that we think, we're assuming that she got the BBL because she Can I ask You a question? Yeah. That A finish? No, I'm shooting at her. Go Ahead. Men that you have coveted in the last two years, do you think that 25 year olds are not in that ballpark? Absolutly Oh wait, oh, sorry, sorry, Sorry, sorry. With that Oh, so wait, wait, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. That put in direct competition with whatever the 25-year-old woman is doing. I'm no. How, Why not? No. Explain it To me because I'm not looking, I'm not thinking about another woman being my competition. When I am in, when I'm talking to somebody, I'm not thinking about who else is he seeing? I'm not thinking like that.


I'm not, I'm actually thi I'm thinking to myself, is this a person that I want to continue talking to? Is this somebody that I See that our values and our, you know, fucking like You're being dismissive of my point. I'm not, you may not be thinking about it, but it's what is, I'm not saying that you're thinking about it, but Well then it's what exists. I'll give you that. And, and just in it existing you, doesn't that put you in? I will. Even if you are not competing all Fellas. Yeah. You might not ever think about it, but that don mean It's not happening. But you're in the competition. Yeah. With that person. Okay. Or that group, then I am oblivious to the competition. Mm. Okay. Okay. That's it. I'm oblivious to the competition. I don't consider it. I don't think about it.


Okay. Now That's you. Yeah. Now some other people may be aware of that competition. It's entirely possible. And now it's okay. I gotta compete with that. I have to tighten this up because I know what the 25-year-old look like. I know what the 25-year-old is Like. True and true. True. So That's where the in competition with them come from. True. However, she also might look in the mirror and say, this is what I wanna fix about myself. Because every time I look in the mirror, I want to see this look like this. Yeah.

You just Keep yourself in shape and, and tone because you just, and That's the other thing is it makes you feel The only way, Say this Only Makes you feel good about yourself. The only person I'm in competition with is myself. Yes. That's it. Okay. That's it. That's all. That's it. That's all. Yeah. Because you wanna feel good about yourself. You don't care what? I wanna be healthy. You, you ask cap at 50, 50 years old. There's nothing wrong with a little muffin top. That's But she she don't say that. No, no. She, it might be, she would Say different. Yeah. I don't want it. So It is not not, it's not not healthy for a 50-year-old to have a muffin top.

But, but because there's options, like, I'm not shitting on that because there's options shouldn't totally dismiss that. It's okay at 50 years old to have this.


It is un first of all, It is unwise to allow weight to accumulate in the trunk of your body. This is where all your organs are. And the more weight that you accumulate in this part of your body that is visceral fat. Okay? It is unhealthy. You wanna get rid of that. That's number one. Number two, I don't necessarily agree with like a surgical procedure like that just because of the trauma that it does to the body. That's it. I'm not judging anybody. But that is a really, really specific decision to make. And if that's what she wanted to do, that's what she wanted to do. And she, you know, there's a lot of risks involved. She looked like the mother lady bug. It is.


That just is scary to me. That just is scary to me. Like that's just scary. Just like the, the health implications are just scary to me. That's more what I'm thinking of when I see Her. I'm trying to find a picture. She looked like I'm too mature. I can't have fun. Like I would've, I gotta tell y'all all the things that she look like. That shit looks absolutely nuts. And it ain't moving too. I don know it got settled I Don Dunno where she went. It got settled. She gotta settle. Yeah, just go get some wood therapy. Please. Move that edema around. What? No, no, no. Hold on. Wait. They said this meet this meet and greet is for Vivica's head collection in Houston.

Now as Marelda admit That as Marel, this shit is he, It is always, There's always black people that's trying to downplay some shit.

No, It Is the, See This is why you make me mad. I'm not, you know what a fucking BL looks like? Melyssa Ford. And you saw the picture. She showed The picture. She could just be wearing some like fucking shaping garments. No, See I think it's shaping garment. I see it on the edge of her. The edge of her white pants. All right Then a shaping. You know what, why put a BBL L on Miss Vivica and she didn't get one. She Has a BBL. She didn't say. So then if You have eyes, and you know What, if she did not say so, then we can't Speculate. Oh, we going back to that. 'cause that Was a whole timeframe before when it was, no, I Didn't get nothing done.


This is natural. But niggas knew. I feel like she would say So rest in peace. Oliver Miller For sure. Rest in peace. Oliver Oliver Miller and and my junior. The NBA businessman dude that played in the NBA and then went on to make a billion dollars. What's his name? What's his name? What's his name? Junior. Bridgeman. Bridgeman. Right. Bridgeman Rest in Peace. Junior. Rest in Peace. Bridgeman, he passed as well. So yeah, that's it. If y'all know anybody that passed, now's the time to shout him out. I don't dunno. Anybody. Nope.

I got Jam people up, go see Him. I have a piece of shit. You are, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see. Vivid be BL Oh, all Puff is saying that CNN has altered, not only altered that Cassie video that was leaked, but C Puff is saying that's the only version that existed. So now the original is obsolete. He said that. Yeah. They deleted the original card. You ever seen the Hail Mary before? Yes. This feels Hail Mary ish. Yeah, they stole something out there. They throwing shit at the wall. Whatcha talking about? We like, yeah, they may have sped it up. They may have edited some parts out, but the parts that we saw are still the parts that we saw.


Yeah, Yeah. But that don't have nothing to do with the court of law Because they're trying to get the video thrown Out. Right. I And that's why lawyers are saying that it appears that that video will be, But he is not gonna trial for this. It don't matter. They were still trying to show it. Yeah. Yeah. They were still trying to show the video. What The Fuck that got to do with the Rico? I don't know. But they were trying to show the video. So if we trying to get it removed, trying to show a pattern and you have eliminated the original, but it's, then I went, I'm Lost. I'm confused in this whole, I, I think that's what they're trying to do on both sides, honestly. Is Muddy it up. Muddy It up. And, and c big old CNN put a state statement out. CNN never altered the video and did not destroy the original copy of the footage, which was retained by the source.


CNN aired the story about the video several months before Combs was arrested. So it's, They tried to say, they say they tried to, they say, what'd they say? They used a free video editing software. Like they're just trying shit. They're just trying shit. Do you think that Cassie's gonna be called as a witness by the prosecution? Nothing. Absolutely. So then fuck the video. Well give us a shit. We all saw it and now we're gonna have a firsthand account from the person who can literally speak to the entire fucking thing. I Don't know if that's how that works. I did one of the jurors to act like you've seen that video I'm gonna remove Yeah. Outta Removed. To have you removed and have a mistrial. It's, it's impossible. It's, it's impossible. It's impossible.


It's just, but that goes with high profile cases. Every single one. Menendez brothers, fucking OJ Simpson, everything fucking jurors saw shit like it unfolded in front of their fa the Menendez brothers got a fucking mistrial the first time around. So you think that that f that second set of jurors didn't see anything like, it doesn't matter who you are, what's happened, like in this age, you're banned from the jury. You're banned from the Menendez brothers number. The jury pool is always gonna have a certain, that's like a certain level of taint That's like in court when they say, oh the jury, you're instructed, you didn't hear that. No nigga. Like you saw it. We heard it like you can't take it back. Everybody saw, you're right. Everybody saw this. You're not gonna be able to find a juror to say, well, to say I didn't see it.


Yeah. They'll say, I ain't see it but You. But you literally can find jurors who, who can say, you know what? I really can be objective. I wanna hear what the defense is gonna say. I want to hear his case. I want to judge for myself regardless of anything that I've seen. I believe that you'll be able to find people who feel that way. And I don't care what y'all talking about, if the whole jury's seen it, but it's not admissible into our court session, that means that in our court session, nothing from that can be brought up. True. So while you testifying, we'll take your testimony but, But bro, real talk, if you're a juror and you saw that even if they don't bring it up in court, your mind is kind of already is. Yeah. It is implanted in your brain.


This nigga a Piece of shit. I'm not arguing what's in nobody's mind. I'm only talking about what you will be allowed to say and not say in court. That's it. Okay. Alright. And this ain't my bag. Hey, don't hit nobody and you won't go through it. There you go. That part. There you go. Don't drag nobody. Don't fucking don't do none. Insult Yeah. In in any matter. Yeah. Stay away from that type of violence and you'll be cool. Keep Your hands and other appendages to yourself at all times. That nigga said the video was edited. Hey, r Kelly tried it. Did he, did he try that line? Yes. Yeah. It wasn't me. I was as my brother was digitally imposed in the video. And then he said it was his brother then he said it was his brother.


Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, his brother. I would've tried to pin it on my brother too. I ain't gonna lie. They wasn't close r Kelly and his brother. And they look alike a little bit. Yeah. That wasn't me. And I got fucking 70 million in the bank. Some stupid shit they had to remind. That was Roger Kelly. They Had to remind him though. We saw the whole video where you walked up to the camera and went, That's when r Kelly was trying to sing for Farrakhan. Right. He was trying to clean himself up. Stop, stop it. You know. Stop, stop. Flip. Do not. Why we can't make that joke?


Because You can't make the joke. But why not though? You wanna know. Let's go. Let, let's, It is publicly documented that niggas felt. I know. You can make the joke. Go ahead. Say I ain't saying it. I ain't saying it. I'm not saying it. Make a joke. It is. Document it. And they put it in the movie. There you go. You make the joke then flip. Yeah. You're just Brother flip. I'm joking. I'm not. I'm not. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. We have You seen, We back, we back, we back stop real quick. No, it's too much work. Can we have to edit it out? Come on Park. Bring your white ass back here. Let's see, let's see, let's see. What do we got? What do we got? What do we mother fuck with y'all?


Let's see. Oh shit. So I haven't kept up with this, but the internet is telling me that some years ago somebody shot one of K flock's friends and Klock heard about it and didn't like it and went to spin in retaliation for the nigga shooting one of his friends. Right. Okay. And then that guy, his friend who he was defending in his trial that started the other day has taken the stand against him. Against him to let people know that he killed them niggas. Oh shit.

That is White Power still. White Power. Sorry. Yo Ani, while We on this another, another movie I wanted to come and talk to y'all about because since I've been announced recently, I've just been watching old movies and shit. Like terminated Too fucking Social Network. Was the Talk ever had about Save the Last Dance? Probably, yeah. That movie was it. It was not a very good movie. It was so Bad. And I think that's why we people skip talking about it the way it should have been talked about. At some point somebody should discuss Save the Last Dance and the story Whole watch you save the last dance.


Were You right? You Could nigga. No, I'm telling you, I followed. See, going Back What you watch right after that. Some kind of, wonderful, okay, Come on. No, I follow a bunch of, Mel is a real life movie buff. I follow a bunch of movie buffs. So sometimes on a late night them niggas will get high and just start getting in their movie bag and they'll be like, yo, what the fuck was up in this movie? Then you gotta go watch it now. Like, you know what? And then I'm like, well let's see. So the white girl that got into Julliard was doing the hip hop dances, Which were not hip hop dances. Oh wait, wait. She broke her hip or something. She broke something. So she couldn't do her normal dances. So she wasn't gonna go for the Julliard exception acceptance thing.


But then her black dick boyfriend that she had convinced her to do it 'cause he taught her some hip hop moves and then she went up there looking stupid. And that's me skipping the whole, that was A really complex story. And that's me skipping the beginning and the middle of this dumb stupid ass movie. Although The white guy came in. What? Why? Nah. A black guy tour her. The hip hop dancer. It was black Dude. The different movie The white guy was, You're thinking of The white guy that was dancing with the girl in hip hop. Man. Wait, What movie you saying? I wanna know this sound funnier. Isn't that with Channing Tatum and Jenna DeJuan? Isn't that what you talking About? Oh my God. Yeah. It is Jenna DeJuan. What's the Name of it? Mo Mail Chin Means the Janitor.


Some bullshit. That's Is Usher in it? No. Oh. Jan Tatu Game Mail. What was that called? This nigga? Hold up. Hold up. He was young. Yeah. What I started. Yeah. Bunch of bullshit. Nah, but Save the Last Dance when she learned the hip hop dances to get her in Julliard please. We gotta bring it back up. Step up. Step Up. Thank You. Step Up, step up. Oh my God. Usher was supposed to be in Step Up, Step Up that bullshit. But Didn't they have like sequels to that? Yes. The Step, step Up two and Yes. Yes they did. Okay. Did What was that Movie like Tango Knights or some Shit Fucking Usher. Was it, was it Lighted Up Honey? Was it Honey Light Up? That's what was the Usher movie in the school?


The faculty. Oh, the Faculty. No, no, no, no, no, no. That Was a movie. The faculty is a movie. The Usher might have been in the faculty. He wasn't. It is The Joint. He shot somebody. Yeah. Oh, In the mix? No, No. That's some case. Yeah, he was in the faculty. Yeah. Yeah. He was a young nigga in high school. Yeah, he was. Is that the movie in the School? Light Up was in 1999. In the mix. 2005. It Is Usher and Light Up. Yes. See I know. I'm not fucking crazy. Light It Up. Yeah. Fuck y'all niggas. But shout to the faculty. What else? What else, what Else you're thinking of? She's all that. Nah, honey. Oh yeah. Did you watch The Gorge? I like She's all that nigga. Did I watch what The Gorge? No, I did not watch the Gorge yet.


Okay. And I have not seen Mel's movie yet. Those are the two movies I haven't seen yet. I'm gonna get to it. Okay. I just wanna see, I want, I want to hear your No, I started the fucking pit. HBO. Yes. Is that good? I'm not watching that. I don That's a hospital. Yeah, I'm good. I'm Good on the hospital. Shit. I feel like if you've seen House then you can't And, and and and what's the other one? Er, Grey's Anatomy. Grey's Anatomy or Yeah, you've seen Er is another one. Er is Great Chicago Man. No, no, no. That's what my list stops at. House er and Grey's Anatomy. Yeah. If you've seen those three, it's gonna be real tough to pull off the hospital. Show The Pit looks good because it looks like an, It's a dude from er, isn't it Noah?


Noah Wiley. Yeah. He was on er. Yeah, it looks like an old FX Series. Series And A way in a bad way. Good. Okay. No, that would be great. Like Nick Tuck And shit. No, it's, it looks good and it's good, but it's not House and er and Grey's Anatomy. Yeah. That and it's Pittsburgh. That genre is not, I'm, I'm over that genre. Or if it's not Pittsburgh, It is just calling it the Pit. My problem with the pit is there's nothing really going on so far, but sick people in the hospital. Like That's it. That's sounded very compelling. And the story or nothing, The story so far, I've only seen five episodes.


I story and It is mad episodes. There's like 2015. It is, it's a long season. Oh, it's a lot of episodes. I'm not mad at that. All I've seen is commotion with the patients. Alright. I haven't seen much story with the people that actually work in the hospital. Maybe I haven't gotten there yet. But that's to me what Separated House and these, these shows from the other hospital shows is the, the doctors had some shit going on. It's a story for sure. Absolutely. It's a realistic examination of the challenging of challenges facing healthcare workers in America. As seen through the lens of the frontline heroes working in the modern day hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With All respect to the healthcare workers. I'm cool. I'm good.


I do like a hospital drama. Nickle. I do like one of the stories, I'm sorry. One of the stories about the patient, let's say a 60-year-old mom is brought in by her 18-year-old child. He just turned 18. They're trying to figure out what's wrong with the mom. Once they get the 18-year-old outta here. The mom says, listen, I made it look like he was bringing me here 'cause I needed some help, but in reality I'm really worried about my son. And I found a note in his book bag that said he planned on causing havoc and harm to people at his school. Is there anything that y'all could do? Oh, a Shit more interesting already than how you were describing it. Well, But again, it's just patient related.


Got it. Whatever interesting is coming from the show is coming from the patient. The patients is all stories. They are interesting. Okay. They are interesting stories. Super procedural. But they connect. But, but eventually Does each episode connect? I haven't seen that yet. I see. I don't, I'm pretty sure it will. And eventually they're gonna have Intertwining Yeah. Got five episodes Already. But they eventually, they're gonna, At some point they have, Eventually they're gonna have intertwining storylines where the doctors are like involved with each other. Nurses and stuff. Like I'm, I'm pretty sure that's Girls. Her parents work at the hospital. I, it feels like they setting up to have some storyline coming. Okay. I just haven't gotten it yet. Chicago. I read it and I was like, I'm cool. It could be a like a procedural, like, like a law order or something.


They don't really connect. I mean there's a little bit of fucking, there's one Main story that goes through this season and then each episode is its own story. Well, Dick Wolf, Dick Wolfs Chicago Med is, if You're not careful with Law and Order it Law and Order Connects, sometimes it Does it connect All It does Because What's his, it always connects, What's his name? The gray haired dude who's now the lawyer that helps in law and order. SBU Oh, Watch this. Fuck what's his name? Watch this. None of us know it, Mel. Okay. All right. Well they, We know that you know it, There's some cross pollination like relationships developed behind, you know Sure. Behind the scenes. But you Can watch any individual episode and it'd just be about A case. A case. A case. Yes. Absolutely. Yo, also I, the show I told y'all about Dope Thief.


Yeah. Is that good? It It launched Friday Last night. I put it on my little thingy thing. They put two episodes out. I did get the first one done. So far so good. You know, apple ain't been missing.

That shit, I ain't heard a peep about it. I don't hear nobody talking about it. Writing about it. It shit has been weird, bro. Hard to follow. It is weird. That's what I wanna say.

I love tv. Yes. Honestly.

You read some shit. Oh, add it. I'll get to it later. Yeah, Yeah. No it's true. Alright, so we're done with tv. We're done with music, we're done with current events. We're done with gender wars.

I don't need to see anymore of I'm good unless you tell me something completely different than it's captivating and amazing or someone else does. But I haven't heard nobody talk about it. Okay. I feel what they do. Well It is captivating and amazing. Oh really? Okay. Still don't know if I want you to Yeah, I'm about to say, I don't know if that's the sales pitch. It's captivating and amazing in the sense that some of the people from the, from the case they're speaking to currently. Oh, okay. Which is exciting. That's different.

Some niggas was racist back then, man. It was the nineties. You were Alive 30 years Ago. I was alive. I'm just saying. I'm telling you what the white man said, yo, it was a different time. But you're supporting that. I had a a skewed, He didn't say, he didn't say all shit. That's, that's not true.

I gotta wear that when I die. I know that the headline is gonna say this is a racist piece of shit. And while I don't feel like that I was fucked up back then, but I get it.
