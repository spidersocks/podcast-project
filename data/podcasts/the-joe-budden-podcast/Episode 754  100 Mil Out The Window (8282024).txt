Yeah. No Yachty on that one. I really like that record. This is a great little three pack. It is my favorite three pack by By pack. I, I don't know. I I, I said this before, I don't know what he's doing. I don't care. Just Testing the waters. I'm Saying I don. It seems interesting. It it, It does. But there's something don don't even care about the business side of what he's doing. He, he, he clearly has a plan here. Something he's doing with that whole 100 gigs and dropping shit over there. I don't care. Just keep giving us music. I'm, I've always been on the other side of the Yo Drake needs to go away. you know, everybody keeps saying that. Nah, fuck that. I disagree.


Keep doing what you do. Just keep dropping music. Make niggas forget about that bullshit that happened. You took your l just keep going though. Well that's problematic when he puts out a clip saying we're gonna win game two or something like that. Yeah. So he's Going back to it. I mean he, he, I told y'all though, he he's petty. He's not letting it go. He's gonna jab and, and and take shots Until he, until the college at, at that level. I, I ain't gonna front at that level. I ain't letting it go neither. No, You what? No, at that level I'm not letting it go. You not going to do what you did to me. And I might let it go for now, but I'm gonna wait the whole school year to get mine back. Yeah. And I'm dead ass and I'm gonna keep Jabbing. I'm gonna do pushups All year. We'll catch you at three o'clock in June.


Hey, you got that off in September, homeboy in June. That shit happened to me before. That shit happened to me before. Do it don't, I don't think if you that, if you are that nigga or on the level of that nigga and you take that LI don't think it sits well with you. No, for sure. don don't, I don't think this has sat well with him. I think he's doing a decent job now in, in post battle recovery. He's started to turn it around. It was, it was not going great at first. But he's turning it around. Don don't, I don't want to don don't. If you gonna do it, don don't want to hear you say we gonna win game two. I don't want to hear you promo shit to act. I just want you in your cave with your team and, and, and do it. I agree with that. Now I don't necessarily need to see that.


Of course if they engage I'm near, I'm near front row seat of course. But I'm not looking for that. I don't think it's game two also maybe series two. Yeah, it's not game two. He did it. He did it wrong. Yeah. I don't care about none of that Bro. My problem though is keep put music out if he, but if he putting songs out and again, I really don't care about the business either. Yeah. I don't give a fuck about none This shit. I'm interested, I'm Curious about the business. I'm curious but don don't know enough yet to get into it. How this affects me as a consumer is when he drops a three pack. I like see I ain't even listen no jewelry. Right. But When, you drop a three pack. I like now I would like to get this music. Now I can see that it may be unfinished. Like finish these slaps. True.


This stuff finished more. So then lemme buy 'em then lemme buy 'em. These sound more finished than the last one you say. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Production wise Definitely. Definitely. Even Os is way more finished than the first S os that we heard. Well yeah, I agree with that. But that, that I'm up record sounds finished to me. Okay. That's the one that we didn't really give a shot. We played it. He sang for like six seconds on the record and we cut it off before he even got to his shit. That's a record like I, that that's out of all of the records he dropped. That's the one I'm still playing with right now. Play. You got 'em up? No, we ain't been listening to that shit. You play go get your Apple glasses. One that made it to Ds Piece.


I to a couple of his shit. I Got It because I don't know what I I don't know the song you're talking about. Like I said, I haven't been listening to it. We played, We played it on here. When, when, when we first talked about the, the three records he dropped and immediately cut it off. You mean it's up? It's up. Excuse me. Yeah. Oh you Got it Bbdo not Ado no 21. Oh yeah. This shit is amazing. I provide them, this world has some real things divided them right. He is Muslim. I die him drunk as hell at Faia. I get knocked down. Hey, help me Rise again. Ate game. I ain't saying bye Did it again.


This shit the fuck up I don Care about don't care about my, don't care about my Alright. You Right. Alright. My opinion. I know. Has it particularly changed? I'm curious. I wonder if it will be, I wonder if this will be like a, a living document like how Kanye shit are a hundred gigs where he'll just keep adding onto it as he goes. Mm. I was thinking he's gonna take that site and make that subscription based or something. Mm.


That's that's, I mean, again, I don't care about the business but that's my, it gotta be something after that. If I'm, if I'm giving y'all this, I'm giving you a full library of content, constantly updated, testing it out, hook, get you hooked and now I'm gonna lock it and make you subscribe to it. And now you're subscribing directly to me. Have he added any more visuals to the like the Yes. Added more visuals and everything. It makes me think if, if he's actually taking the stance that, you know, Kanye's taking meaning that he's going against the label due to the fact that after the Kendrick, how they might have handled him after the battle. It makes me, I'm I'm wondering that if When, you talk about subscription base, is he going against them? I think, I think So.


I. I'm gonna stand on my own. Y'all niggas gonna hold me down. Yo. come on bro. Wait, what? What are you crazy nigga? Just tell me lift it up. You was saying something good and the sound was messed up. Go ahead though. So you don't want me to fix your mic? No I don't. My bad. I appreciate that. The boss don't usually get up and into shit like that. Thank you. Hands on. I ain't Bruce Springsteen or Something. You're not Bruce Springsteen. So it makes me see because Bruce Springsteen maybe, maybe how they handled him after the bath. I think it was before that. Yeah. I don Not before. Before that it wasn't looking, before that we were talking about how he may have stakes in different things and how he had a mega deal.


That's what I remember us talking about. And then when the battle happened it just looked like everybody was against him. To me. Drake's been hating that that I been saying that they've been against him for years. Yeah. Oh I been hating that. When the higher ups are all coming together as a collective to try to trick me out. Like he's been saying this, that okay, hey I see something happening here and y'all are trying to get me outta here so he could be bucking the system his own. Oh who knows What's so crazy? He said on the song to Larry, like Larry get the equity. All all that shit. Like I, I said I told you this off. Mike I think that he trying to get out his universal deal. you know what's crazy? I remember when Joe said the back to back touring, all of that shit came off tour. Went right back on tour. I think he trying to fulfill whatever obligations he gotta fulfill that he might have.


Again, we don't know. I can see see it, but I think I remember when Joe said that, I don't know and I've used up my Drake quota for the year. So I'm saving it for when something big happened. Yeah. I I remember. I don't want to get in the business of it. Do I think something may be going on? Yes. Do I think it's weird that somebody at this level is just giving you all of this footage? The footage It is what makes me say there's a much bigger play for him coming. 'cause if you were taping for all of these years with do do, do B roll then he got a Roll. It's a value. Yeah, but You got a roll. I'm lowering the people in. I'm lowering them in. I'm lowering em. It's like you giving away some, it's like a success. Some consultations for free.


You get what I'm saying? You're given a consultation for free. You get the people in, now you hit 'em with the 9 99 subscription, whatever the case may be. I think that all of them higher up niggas have reached a certain level where they kind of could do that. Don't need the label now. Yo you need me more than I need you. And Stout kind of said that too. Like yo, them niggas deals be so crazy that the label don't make much money off of them. And I think they know it now and it's like, yo, we y'all need us more than we need y'all. I'm gonna just go independent. I remember when Joe was talking about how unique it was or not, not unique, but how surprising it was to see how much dislikes his video had. Remember we were talking about that and he was like, there something is going on over there or with him. Yeah. you know what I mean? And it's just now you now you say that I didn't know that he was hinting that he was good.


Yeah, he's been, he's I didn't know that he's been saying that. I thought the nigga was just looking good and just the the nigga on top. I didn't know that. Yeah. But once you on top You Get a little bit too powerful. Now we have to remove you even that yo again, we love the records. So let me preface that. I love, I love like that I love not like us. Yes. Still I know y'all dis it out there. I love them both. But for those records to hit number one the way they did these are Drake dis is in there a record. Don't make it to number one without some type of label support making that happen. I see what you're saying. Not not whatchamacallit. What? They not like us. They didn't need the label for that bro. That's that all You're not making, you're not making it to number one without something behind it regardless.


Yeah. But I don't necessarily look at that as the powers that be going against Drake. Yeah. Kendrick Lamar is a premier artist too and they want him to go number one regardless if it's a dis to Drake or not. But But Kendrick Lamar is a premier artist that's independent now. I'm not working with them But they, they, there's a a slash interscope I think on some of that isn't there? I know and nobody paid enough attention to that during the battle. Yeah. Mm. I don't think anybody paid enough attention to, I'm pretty sure There is. Maybe I'm bugging Butrick that Kendrick Lamar to our knowledge is independent yet throughout that whole beef it did say Interscope. I thought so. It did. So what's that mean? I can't say there's still I don there's still, there's still a relationship there that's, it's not, it's not that deep.


Gotcha. It's not that deep. There's still, there's still interest from the label to there's a reason for them to support the record. Yes. Yeah. If they're Invested. But that's, that's weird I don Like, okay, I'm, I'm interested in your project but, and what you're doing, but at this point I know what It is that you're doing and I'm gonna back that as universal even though it's against my universal artist. Oh, gotcha. Okay. So I do believe there's some truth to somebody at Universal wanting that beef to stop. So I'm looking here. Not like us did not come out PG Lane. It came out 2024 Kendrick Lamar under exclusive license to Interscope.


Yeah. That's it. So that That is again, there's so there's something in there. There's something there. I'm mind in my business until I get more information. But I also believe that Drake is at the level the where I can sign a deal in September and feel differently in in November. And now I'm gonna work through and That is that deal is almost two, three years old now. I won't pretend to know don don't know none of it. No, I'm just saying I remember when he signed a $400 million deal we were in your basement. Yeah. Yeah. At that point these Niggas are mend some shit, extend some shit. Or it might be I don know nigga our shit was three years ago. Don don't know and they ain't never gonna tell us. There's a bunch of deals out there that I do wanna know about and, and I can't never come in here and say because I just can't. But there's a lot of deals I want to know about Say And just relationships that I want know about.


I wanna know about a lot of Jake Cole business. I ain't gonna lie. That boy good. He stayed Clear. Yeah. That boy is good. He stay quiet. Clear. He stayed clear riding a bicycle while all that shit was going on. Having a picnic nigga by the rocks. Yeah. I Didn't but his laptop. Y'all can have that. Yeah, I be wanting to know. Yeah, We was criticizing him nigga. But he made a small move. He made a small move. Just staying clear nigga. He stayed clear. He saw, he saw it coming. Yeah. I'm not criticizing nobody out there. Well not anymore forgetting money. However you see fit Mind my business, I also was in the camp of Drake should maybe get low. But if he's gonna put out quality music, I'm here for it.


My only question regarding this and then I'm off of this, he, Drake don't decide whether It is another series in the beef. I mean You can just, he can shoot, You can just start firing. He could just start firing You can You can Joe button. Yeah. Kendrick. Kendrick. He could Joe button Kendrick. Yeah he could in May. It could work if he get to Joe button like Joe button. Well but did it work? 'cause he went, Kendrick just might ignore it. Kendrick is king. Ignore. You gotta say something. I don how much bad more words could you say than what you said already? Yeah. don don't Know. Nah, he he keeps saying it can, it can get deeper. But the Kendrick niggas keep saying that. Kendrick don't really feel like I'm done with you neither.


I think Kendrick really don't like this nigga. So, I, It is, this is beyond just he don't Yeah, I just don't like you So yeah. Ain't gotta be like this. You know the one nigga you just don't like nigga, the second you say something, I'm on your ass just solely because I don't like you. That's what I get from him. It's just like, bro, I did go ahead. You wanna do it again? We can do it again. I think that If they dance again, you think it'll be this year or next year and I'm Done. Where we at It depend on, I mean being that he just posted the game two shit, I would think it's gonna be This year. I agree. And I, and I think it depends on how hot the little packs that he keep putting out. Like if he start building up his momentum, I think he got 'em in the top. Get his head Chopped off. It's a trick.


It's a trick because I like this. It's the BA switch. I like this last three pack a lot. I think that last momentum a lot. Hmm. I think you should build on that momentum and leave the battle shit alone. That's That's what I said. Like I think if he starts building up his momentum, I'm gonna throw y'all niggas another three in of September, October. Throw you niggas another. And I think if he starts to get video here, feature here, feature here and he start to build up his momentum, I think you'll see it before. What if this is him forcing a label hand. Like I throw these three packs out there and they pick up enough steam to where y'all gotta jump behind it and say all right we gotta put this out and now this counts against whatever I got. 'cause like right now dropping these songs don't mean nothing.


That's why he's not dropping 'em from Drake. He's dropping 'em from a fence to page or whatever you wanna call it. But if they pick up enough Steam got That out the ice playbook. Out the ice playbook, The fence to page. Don don't have no fence to page. Oh please. Now how many fucking folders of music ice off from somebody else? Page. Excuse me nigga Ice was cooking at one point. Yo. Yo you like provolone. Yo, what's up? Huh? That's Bad to say. Mozzarella we vla. What you doing? I take it back. Sneaking Chris. Nobody was doing that before. Ice. Yo yo. Alright You the original hundred gigs s up With y'all. Fuck you'll come out. We caught shit. Come on. They got us get My bad.


I'm sorry. I'm sorry But. yeah I just, it could be that, you know what I'm saying? Pick up enough steam. The label's gonna want to get behind it and All right, cool. That's how they did the first three pack. That's a good point. So. I thinks the level, the label don't need to get behind it. Yeah. But I mean just now that they officially release it. Yeah. Whatever contractual shit he got, this could count. I get it. So we'll find out man, We'll find out. I Hope I got some more Music coming. Stay tuned. Salute to the OVO camp. Good, good records. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. How about that For a change. It is good records. Good records and the good footage of him dubbing the weekend Nigga. I ain't dapping you, I ain Footage. You see that shit nigga. Dapp Seven niggas, yo as many here.


Dap too, like Yeah, yo as men in here. come on, let's do it. Let's take this off Drake for a minute. As men, what you do When, you going to go to the group of seven and speak to six of them? I'm gonna speak to six of y'all. Like I love y'all and miss y'all. It is one of you niggas that's gonna get a cold show. How y'all, how y'all do it? The Same? Just like that Same way. What? Fuck, What? Same way For real? Yeah. I'm I don even see you. I'm a old exaggerate. The six DAPs. What up my Nigga work boy what's Good? What they give the last one was like the loose fingers. I'm Not, no, I don't even see You. I'm not giving nothing. I don't even see, you don't See that's the issue for doing Greenhouse. When we wasn't talking My nigga I don't see you. Yeah, I don't see you. Oh You there? Oh, he just dubbed you completely. Or he gave you the shitty d Hugging? Everybody I'm with for mad long, like while I'm standing, they gave the pound.


I'll split that whole hug up nigga. Hell you wouldn't burn. Nothing fucking y'all doing in any here. Nothing like Green House. We'll look right past you Bro. Keep it pushing. I don't be with that phony shit. Yeah, I'm, I'm me neither. I ain't with that. Like if don don't fuck with you, you know So I respect that at least nigga ain't being phony. Hey, what's up? None of that here nigga. What? What's up now? I was just gonna say he didn't even give you a s up nothing When we weren't talking. Yeah. Had not no ice cold. No, when we weren't talking we wasn't talking. But he doofy so we'd be standing right next to each other. He took I'm upstanding outta way nigga. I'm right, I'm right here. Hey, we both standing on the same couch. I'm surprised there's only this much room on the couch, Nigga.


I'm surprised you didn't reach over and like stick your finger in his ear and just try to Noize. No, he would be talking to Vern or fucking somebody else and I would be tapping him while he talking to him. Hey, he stood strong. That nigga strong. That nigga's strong. Boy. He don't play Stubborn. Ah yeah. Yeah. He don't play. What else? What else, what else, what else, what else? Kin Isha or doing something. Yeah, she something. She said she wanna sit down. Kisha Invited Act on season two of Caresha Please. I like it. I like it. I like It. is It, Is it like a co-hosting or is it just an interview? No, no One off. It's one off.


No, it's a one off interview and people are killing Reha because of our act. Spoke to Reha in the past. But I think that is exactly what Reha needs to do. I agree. Needs to take I agree. It is true out of the JT book or whatever book she's pulling it from. Mm. And rather than get on Twitter and just start clapping at people, why don't you sit down with some people and help them understand your thinking and your point of view and your process and your experience. I think that's a big problem in music that most of the musicians don't really fuck with black media. So we don't really get y'all viewpoint Or like get tight at someone in the media. And now I'm not gonna go do your podcast. The biggest podcast or one of the biggest shows, whether it's Act, whether it's us, whoever, Duh, we, When I was growing up again, caveman shit.


We had so many shows to where no matter who you was, you was going to sit down with fucking Ed Lover and Dr. Dre. You was gonna sit down with Fab Five, Freddy, you was going to sit down with somebody, whether it be big ticket hits and streets. Somebody I can name a million shows today. Niggas just tweet some shit going about their business. Put the song out if you like it, you like it. It's just too microwave. Yeah. So. I do like Isha go to do that Lake. you know what It is? you know what It is? That is the sole reason I took it easy on Kaisha 'cause of Lake Shout the Lake. Mm. Yeah. I'm not mad at it. I like it. No, I I I don't, I don't really see what the, the big deal is.


Even if they had some, They've gone back and forth static in the past. A lot of static. There's A Lot of stuff. But we could still sit down and discuss it. We could still, I like it and I like it and monetize it at the same token. Instead of shooting at each other on fucking Twitter, we could down sit down and and bust a bag down and hash out our differences. I think it's genius and could gain some understanding on both sides. Like Oh Shit. That's why you felt that way. Oh, all right. Well I said like they could come to a point where it's just understanding Social media. Shit ain't real. Sit down and talk. That's it. you know what I mean? People get too sucked up in these fucking phones. Don't line my nigga. Act up. I Was about to say how you think it's gonna go. I think it'll, I think it'll go good. I think it'll go good. I do. I'm not, honestly, I haven't watched her shit.


I just know Act is very well spoken and you know, that nigga get to talking fast. I think he's different, You know, at get to talking fast, it It, you know what I'm saying? Or even agreeing to do the sit down says that you, that you are open openminded to doing things differently than you have. I Agree. And he presents differently like in interview when he's up here versus when he's on his own platform. True. Yeah. No That's true. So I think that It is gonna be a little bit more of like, you know, an easy dialogue t because when he is By himself he's gotta entertain, he's gotta Yes, exactly. He's exactly, he's gotta carry the show. Exactly. So he's gonna fire up. Yeah, That makes sense. All right ladies and gentlemen, time for my favorite Part of the Show.

Why not we're here. What the fuck is pulling the ice mean? Excuse me. Oh, Oh Shit. Who said that? Huh? Somebody pulling the ice. I just would like to know what It is pulling the ice. When I. Hear somebody say pulling the ice. I think they gotta go back to their car and get their Apple Pro. Yeah, I figured it was just updating the O Ice. Who said pulling the ice? Ice And he didn't wear him shit once in Atlanta. I ain't seen him wear This shit. I Don't want a plane. Nigga Got it. Who said pulling the ice ice? Is there Contact that You can give us? Because I think it's You talking what it said? Hey, anybody not on the show? You He do not speak to anybody that's not on the show. He asking, We pulling the He talking about said, said yeah. You listen to the pod or no? No. I saw what the clip.


The clip? Yeah. Said if I pull the ice. So I was just like further clarification on what pull it. An ice means So I wasn't here. Smoke? No, I don't have smoke. No. That sounds like smoke. I promise you. Am I Sloane, what am I missing? When it said if I pulled the Ice, you had a Patreon episode and I said if we went around the room, basically. Oh, you talking About a Patreon episode? Got it. Okay, okay. Okay. And I said that I, I didn't know what was going on. And you said yo, everybody has a role, blah blah blah blah blah. And I said cool. And you said, yo, everybody's in character here. And I said cool. If everybody's in character, you said except me. And I said cool. So if I pull, I remember Now a Character like everybody else, then you would have something to say. So I said if Parks, if I came in and did what Parks did, if I came in and did what Ice did, if I came in and did what Flip did, if I came in and did what Mel did, you would have something to say.


IT Oh Alright. So that, that was the conversation. I broke the room down. It just wasn't you. No, no, no. I understand. I broke the entire room down and said that F Antoine me did what each individual here did. Joe and Ian would have a problem with that. I know, but I heard the word if I pulled in ice. I just wanna know what does pulling ice mean? Pulling the ice is you'll have an opinion on something and you'll keep it to yourself. You've admitted it a million times on like personal shit. Yeah. Or other shit too. No, I give my opinion. I don't like my opinion half the time. When I give it. No, I get killed From my opinion, honestly, if it's being on the wrong side of shit, cool, cool, cool. That's not, if It is a, if It is a male female topic and you have an opinion, sometimes you bite your tongue or no, no.


I'll say something. Or It is times. I might think about the other perspective of it. I'll see things from the other side. I'm more open-minded than I'm talking about. If you ice have an opinion, do you always give your opinion or do you shield your opinion sometimes for, 'cause you don't want to engage. Oh, I shield opinion at times. That's all I'm saying. Not because don don't want to engage, but I will shield an opinion. That's what I said. So that's pulling and ice. Yeah. Okay. I just wanted some clarity because When, I hear me disgusting. I'm not here and I, you know, I said let me just ask my brothers. Gotcha. But I appreciate that for clearing that up For You. All right. I'm cool Before we move on to something productive.


I forgot mess that I did want to start last PO with Ish and I listened back and I remembered the mess. That's such a pet peeve of mine. When I. Forget some mess. So before we leave, I do wanna start the mess a little bit. Let's do it. It's three second mess. Okay. Only 'cause we was on Mandy. Mandy said you were a plus one s Avon's mixer was you. What Do you want me to say to that? Anything? I don't, I don't care. Say anything. You can say nothing And I'm gonna cry.


I think Mandy's doing what y'all do. I think it's COE for y'all. So. I. Think Mandy throws something in the universe 'cause she knows it's gonna catch the same way y'all do and it works. Damnit All right. He matured. You got Don don't like I don't like that mature shit Matured. I ain matured you. Yeah. I don't like that. That was cool. I don't like that but all right, good. All you Got it. I'm moving up Bro. Both of them times. I'm on up. All Right, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see. Keith Lee, let's get to Keith Lee in DC Sir, let's get here. Let's, Keith Lee went to dc Stay outta dc Keith Lee, them niggas mad as hell. Like Keith Lee in dc. See don don't know the backlash you got. Oh yeah, they, I know Keith Lee went to do his normal restaurant food. Food eating food eatery thing in DC like normal.


He was sent restaurants. He said his findings wouldn't do any good to anybody or any business owner. Many of them black. So he didn't even wanna publish his findings. But he did give some BTS Yo is somebody boiling acid. You know who That is? you know, you know who It is. That metal sink reminded him. The jail. The jail. The jail gone. That's what looks like. Yeah. So he didn't post it but he showed some BTS of why he's not posting it. And yeah, his footage didn't look the greatest. Yo, that's, he went out there, he did his meet the community thing.


He did the normal Keith Lee thing. But people are outraged because I mean to my knowledge, DC don't have bad food. It don't, No. This is My thing with Keith Lee is he came to New York and got a salmon, chopped cheese somewhere and then should have done here in Queens. Yeah, Queens. I take everything that he reviews with a grain of salt now because don don't know where he is getting these recommendations. It's All cont upon where you go. Yeah, I feel you. Yeah. For him to come to New York and not find what he's looking for. I mean I don't want my New York bias to take place. But New York is damn near one of the food capitals world. I said that before It is, it said that before you right. It is shout to New Orleans. I respect y'all too. New Orleans, Chicago my Favorite. Chicago. Yeah. New Orleans But. Yeah. It's making me question exactly what you said, like who is referring him to these places.


you know what I'm saying? Because always consider the referral. Like who's giving it And oftentimes not even being on the funny shit. Some of the best food is in the hood. So, I. Don't know if the person that you are getting referrals from know about the hood necessarily got the hood passed to be in the hood at the hole in the wall. Is it Paola This shit? Is it Paola? I'm, I Don't think so. That's the question I'm asking. Yeah, I don't I don. I'm thinking I know. So Lee has built his brand seemingly on, on the exact opposite of Payo. Yeah, I agree. But then now it makes you question things at the spots that he's going to. He, there's a lot of spots in New York that he could have went. To, You don't, If I don't know New York, let's say I'm going to New York.


I've never been to New York to, to like really look for food spots. How am I now supposed to find out where to go? Yelp Your people or your people? Just your crew. Your, your crew. So your crew might say, yo, go to blah blah blah. They got the best crab cake. Where if you ask a real bian, they like what that bullshit no mos or this place because childhood, I mean you went to taste bud. Taste Buds got some good stuff. you know what I mean? Over there in Queens America, So I don't I? It's just don don't know. I don't know. But what, what happened to DC Because I did see, I saw the outrage but I don't know. But even going Into the race, pasta is not really so much about thing. You got a salmon chopped cheese, you got the wrong thing. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's, you could, you could've went to the best spot in New York, in the world, but if you get the weirdest shit on the menu, you might not have the greatest Di Well I guess I guess because like that's deli and these companies that are doing these experimental foods, people want to try 'em.


I never the beef patty oxtail cheese shit that like people wanna try new things 'cause those are what's in Yo, If I leave a club and go to the fucking aki spot and I'm with a nigga and he order a salmon chopped cheese, bro. I don think It is a cereal bro. Jokes I didn't even know they made That I'm gonna think should go Jail with, I thought it was a regular chopped. You got a salmon chopped cheese. I'm Gonna do a citizen. It's Not gross guys. I'm making citizen. I've, I've had one Inbound weather. It is gross. Gross or not, but It's what you supposed to order? Fixing Your mouth to order a salmon chopped cheese nigga be a Man. He, he might not even know And He Ain't talking to him. He could fight. Yeah, You can fight. I'm not talking to him.

The hold the wall Jamaican spots that we go to, nigga. That's some Fact fire Joe. Sure. But I gotta look at their containers, their rapping. Like I'm looking for a specific style of ghetto.

But we also are not like professional food critics either.


So our definition of good It is somebody sophisticated. Yeah. I don. I don't want to receive hate from this take, but neither is Keith Lee. That's true. And also, I mean, with food, if it's good, it's good. If it's not good, it's not good. Like you don't have to be a food critic and tell what It is Good or not. Yeah, but you're, you're good. Am I good or you're good. Everyone's good's different. It is different. And Not only that, I've had people tell me, yo This shit is rocking. Yo, you gotta try this.

Yes, they have, they have food know talking Gs, they're like historians. They, those are, They look for certain taste and certain things.

He's, But that's very different than, than what we talking about. So What are DC saying Joe? Are they saying that they, I Don't know what DC is saying.

Our and sister Sad, really sad and unfortunate news about her losing both of both of them in the same day. I have not seen how, but it don't matter how, to me, I think They're separate incidences. Yeah. And they haven't printed Why? That's the crazy part. That, That's, Can you imagine something like that? No. No. Fuck no. And you wouldn't even want to.


Nope. Bird, I don't even want to think about putting that At all. Love prayers are thoughts and condolences to Mariah Carey and the family. And the family Word. Yeah. And, and fans. That's just really, really traumatic news. Really dramatic news. It really is. Also, I'm not familiar with the young man that, that was murdered. Who dug up somebody's grave. Oh. Or pistol on somebody's grave. He dug it up. He dug It up. He dug up somebody's grave. He dug up some of the, some ops grave. don don't even know. don don't know. But his Name is YBC Dole. He's a rapper outta Philly. And you know, a lot of videos have come out of him being extremely just disrespectful, disrespectful, taunting his ops.


One of the videos, yes. He was attempting to dig up the grave of someone. There's another one where he was just like, he went on a list of just fuck this city, this street, this block. Like he just, I'm untouchable. That's a lot of shit. It's a lot of shit. That's that's a lot. That's a lot of shit. That's a lot. There was a video that, that that was around where a guy was riding a bike and got killed and they thought that it was him. The guy was riding a bike and these guys came out the car and just was killed them in broad daylight. They overkill him. So they thought they were saying that that was the guy. Right. But It wasn't, his father came out. His father came and released the statement that said that that video is not my son. Yeah. My son got killed while being in the car. Yeah. There was, there was The, the actual video did come out of him sitting in the vehicle car pulling up next to him.


And you know, they, they opened fire. I have a tiny problem with that. don don't know if now's the time for it. What don don't know if now's the time for it. Like It is a real, this is a real sensitive topic. Like in the father's, in the father's address statement address, he said, I know my son didn't live the life of an angel and I received that. He said that I feel like the 'cause I I don don't know if he's made these type of public addresses before. I feel like this should have been preemptive instead of posts.


Like if, if, if I actively see my child pissing on Graves, digging up Graves being a total CE in the street, I may, I'm not speaking for him. I may make a public outcry for anybody that sees my child to help save them. I think that these kids are running around with a really low, low expectancy of life. One life. Absolutely. They don't value they own Value. Low value of life. I don't think that these kids love themselves enough. And with me, I always go to, okay cool for you because you might have came up in that where that's how you feel about you. But where, where are your parents? I do always wanna know where the parents are.


So When I see that you have a dad that cares and that loves and, and and those words. I read it and I felt it. It's like, God damn. Well why I wonder, I just wonder what is going on behind the scenes and in real life. I think like, and I'm saying that as a dad, So they, they they kind of killed you and I for our take on hip hop, right? Kind of for the some similar reasons. I think so at certain points, yo and I, I can say for myself, I had a pretty good upbringing, right. I wouldn't say that it was the greatest 'cause we struggled, but I got shot point blank range two times in my life. So, I could not be on this couch talking.


Sometimes that shit is not a reflection of your parents. Sometimes the kids just be pigheaded and want to be outside. So the shit That is popular. The shit That is attractive to them. You could tell 'em a million times, Joe, stay away from that shit. Stay away from it. It's going and badly. It's going and badly. They don't, they don't care because the peer pressure be so strong. And that's the take that people had with us with hip hop. I agree with hip hop is so strong of a take that the kids want to emulate what they see coming from rappers. I agree with your point. I don't really agree with your example. You had a good upbringing, but you put yourself around a, a different group of individuals as did I My mom had, I I had a great upli upbringing.


Anything I did, the people I put myself around was by choice. don don't think that's the same as a nigga running around pissing on Graves. And basically I don't, I wonder if the kids know that when they do that they're asking for a short lease on life. But Hip hop is, and I, I don't like putting that this Is not a hip hop, not hip hop talk for I don I don like that. Omar did that. Listen, I know they killed us about that, but for me it's not hip hop. But go listen. Listen. What? So when we first started on the pod, right? The, the Lio other dudes who I smoke, who I smoke and what's the other group? The one you just said. Young ace.


Yeah. So if That is a trend, That is going on with their demo and this particular type of music and they getting traction from it. So for him, when he was digging up the thing, he had somebody filming him dig up the grave and then they posting that shit. You get what I'm saying? So I'm not gonna say blame it on hip hop. I'm just saying It is their culture in, in that youth. you know what I'm saying? Like, they think that shit is cool. It's not a, it's not, see don don't, I don't put it personally I don put it on you don't not put that on hip hop. I don't Put that on hip hop. I I put that more on a social media thing. Yes, yes. It is a social media thing where the disrespect has to be quote unquote televised. Televised. That's really what It is because it gets a lot of views now. They they they exactly, they, these kids today are addicted to views, clicks, likes and shit like that.


True attention. So this is gonna get me the attention. It's almost like, and I'm not putting it on a video game either, but it's almost like playing GTA in real life. True. Like I get to do this bullshit and, and but ain't no Rebos in real life and they find that out too late. So yeah, I get to do all this Crazy shit and I think that's where, listen, Dr. Omar could have been 100% right in what he said, who I am, who I be, how I think how I've lived and how I've grown up would never allow me to look at things like that. Yeah. I don't don don't think he's right, but that So I mean I even if he is right, my eyes can't view it like that. Two, partly because of shit like this, like the hiphop that I speak about saves the kids from that.


The hiphop that he speaks about is pausing. Yeah, true. That. So we looking at like two different hip hops And see my, Like when We talk about hip hop, like I said, I'm, I'm into the music, not the culture. The culture is what saves your life. The culture is what wild niggas was doing that in the fucking eighties. We was tagging up somewhere or we maybe stop short to go tag up or go break dance or go cop some shit or go. It's like the lifestyle portion of it. If you just gonna isolate the music where people that are in a lot of pain, I'm not talking To You. No, no, no, no, go Ahead. Where people that are in a lot of pain are sharing about it in their own artistic way. If that's the only thing you hear, then I'm not saying that hip hop is responsible for how each individual mind interprets that.


See my beef with That is anytime people try to say the hip hop parts, you know, blame it on hip hop. Blame it on drill music. I I've heard that on a lot of This shit. Why do y'all stop right there? Let's go back before that. That's what I said. I, I what created that? He's right. And that's what Me and you had got into before. 'cause I'm like, there's a lot of people that glorify that drug dealer era of hip hop. That's what created the drill era. Because now you got dads locked up, hooked on, you know, these kids was out, out here just figuring out on their own. And now they started living and rapping about what they were experiencing. So they don't have no guidance. Ain't no more OGs. Ain't no more big homies. 'cause they locked up because they was in the streets or they dead.


So now your, your, your kids is out here running a gang at 14, 15 damn near gang leaders. No organization just literally figuring it out. So yeah. Now I'm gonna rap about this because all hip, all rap music and hip hop really is, is you rapping about your experiences for a lot of people you feel that the drug era created a drill. Absolutely. It's a byproduct. It's a byproduct. I don't agree with that. The drug era, the, the, yeah, everybody had the ups when with the, the, the drug dealer era. That drill era is a byproduct of that because now these niggas had no guidance and it was just running around like the wild, wild west doing whatever they wanted to do without nobody stopping you to say, your dogs calm down on that.


I mean, if y'all ever wanna have a conversation, we can. It was, it was pre drugs, it was gangs, pre drugs. Correct. There was order, there was there, there was, there was, there was structure. The order and structure is gone. So now with that being gone, there's nobody to guide these kids. Yeah, there was gangs, but these gangs had leadership in order. They don't ha they didn't have that no more. But the violence and all of the other stuff still in that was there. It was there. Violence was there, nigga, whether it was orderly or not Italian, it was still violence. It was still, it was still deaths. It was still killing, it was still mayhem. Even pre drugs. And not even with the blacks advance. Not with the blacks advance. So now you got, I'm agreeing with you in advance. Weapons, advance technology advance a lot of shit advance. But I'm talking about the sentiment.


You can't even blame necessarily on drugs. Now drugs might have exacerbated it, but pre drugs it was still gangs. Absolute New York City was still New York's the Bronx was still the Bronx pre absolutely Prec crack. Even pre that nigga. You get what I'm saying? So, but here's the thing. Now, now you know, I don't, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but now I'm looking at shit like this is set up by design. you know what I mean? Because Yeah nigga you could be preaching about let's say like do the right thing, go to school and that shit wouldn't get the attention that the violence get. And on top of that negativity spreads. Like where no matter what, where like It is a It is a bigger picture. Where are they? Where, where are they getting the guns from? Exactly. you know what I mean? What do they watch it? A lot of times When, you watch the documentaries, these violence, whether it's from back in the thirties, back in the sixties is glorified with the Italians.


They want to emulate that. Everybody, every culture has glorified the bad boys Always been entertainment going all the way back to fucking Roman times. Like violence was entertainment. It's never gonna change. Got it we watch UFC and boxing. Why for violence Football. Football for violence. Humans are entertained. We are weird. We're entertained by violence. That's just in us. Mm. So now you got everybody with a camera and you, we we you was talking about your algorithm showing you murders and shit. You might not like to see that. There's motherfuckers that love that when, when, when we talked about the keep Them fucking decapitated babies off my timeline.


It's nasty, it's disgusting. I'm blocking each and every one of y'all. Yo. Every time, every, and it's not just me that's seeing it, but go ahead. Every, every time. I think that too. Another some, some, some, some footage come out of one of these young kids getting killed. This shit. The shit goes crazy. Why? 'cause people are sharing it. They wanna see it. We are just naturally drawn to violence. Yeah, I mean y'all are taking this, y'all are taking this somewhere else. Y'all are having a greater conversation. I'm telling y'all out there 25 and under, that's living a certain lifestyle. Like sometimes You can invite death to your doorstep. Yes, that's true. Sometimes they willingly doing, they are calling his number dog. There are yo these, some of these younger acts are literally in interviews on record saying I don't see myself here for much longer.


Even the kid, the FIO kid, his peoples came forward and was like, yo, they, some of them know, they knew it was a matter of time for him. I'm talking about So how you saying homeboy's father was like, y'all know my son ain't an angel. His peoples were saying, yo, we knew it was a matter of time. I'm talking about the kids themselves are saying I'm not NBA young boy. I don't see myself here much longer. They know the path that they on. They know the end and they like, yo, the shit that I'm living, the shit that I'm doing, It is going It is only gonna end one way, just a matter of when. Yeah. Listen, rest in peace to the young man. Yes. Rest in peace man. My heart is family heart still with his family no matter what.


Yeah, I don care what he was, no matter what life he lived. Like somebody lost their child. So rest in peace to that man. And the pop the father's adamant that, that it was a setup. He's, he's adamant, he's like, this was a setup Up. I don't want to hear none of that shit. Nobody shouldn't have been, nobody would've been able get that close To him. don don't want single word of that shit. Stop it, stop it.

But thank God the people, people started coming taking pictures. So she seen it. So she said, okay, come follow me. So she followed So, I followed her. Anyway, I get back there and it was, it was, it was amazing, man. I mean I saw Carl Thomas, I saw Lloyd Carl Thomas man is very extremely talented man. He could, he could see both talented brothers. Carl Thomas understood the growth. Lloyd was more like, I need, I'm expecting you to go crazy. And I'm like, nah, I'm not on that no more. I'm not on that time. I'm good. And I realized, 'cause he did say it.


Lloyd was like, yo, you know I watch you on the podcast and I see that you've been changing. This is why I'm comfortable. 'cause When I initially came, To You, When I saw you. My heart started beating fast. I'm thinking you gonna do some crazy shit. Right? And I'm like, damn. you know I be trying to shit on Joe sometimes. But the Joe Button podcast had put me in, in, in a great light. 'cause I was flipping on them in the backseat. I said, well why the fuck would y take Long with the Passes had me here. Y'all got me looking like a mc Foolin. I got my son here. I'm QueenzFlip. All these niggas is fans of mine. That's why I'm, I'm talking my shit like stop having me stand here like a weirdo. Yeah. And but the guy Eric told me, yo, I saw don don't know about the podcast. I'm old. I working in the mayor's office. I saw your old videos of you going to Hot 97 and doing all This shit. And they asked you not to do it.


I heard the story. I don't wanna repeat. I'm like, yo, I completely changed. So when Lloyd and them came, they big me up. It, it, it was great. That was night one. I went on stage. I'm watching 'em, niggas called Thomas perform. Im like, Danny niggas could perform. I have a lot more respect for r and b performers. Lloyd was fucking dancing and singing at the same time. He ran through. I'm like, why the fuck he, what the fuck he doing? He went in the crowd all the way in the middle, just like run back out. I started roasting him and you know, it was dope. The people got at me 'cause I didn't know, I didn't remember who Chub Rock was. When, I put the video out. Chub Rock was like Chub Rock was like, yo man, I see a Netflix series for you. I'm a fan. I support you. So JR said Pops, who is that? I said, don don't know some og he official niggas in the comm like, nigga you crazy that Chub Rock killed me.

Like, niggas was telling me this. Like, I'm like, same. I didn't understand. I didn't under, I didn't under worked out. I didn't understand Joe's angle because okay, you brought the wild guy on the show. We don't know where this is going. That's what niggas was telling me like in person. I'm like, okay. But he said, yo, you've been doing good. You've been showing growth and we appreciate that. And I was thinking like, damn, I be trying to get at my man Joe. I'm queen flipping nigga. But I have to give credit that the, the podcast has shined a different light on me and put me to a, a bigger audience because these niggas were still saying we don't know how you going to act. The guy Eric, who told my mother he wasn't there was watching came at the end of the night to apologize nigga you said you wasn't here.


He said I had to watch you. He was behind watching me the whole night. I had to watch you. Then you saw the video with the lady cursing me out. She wanted to take a picture of me. I I said sure, where is it going? She said she started cursing you the profanity. I, I got a little agitated. So that's been making this rounds on the internet. She cursed me out. And then Night two, night two was also amazing. Marshall Manno performed and you know Marshall Manno, Soer King, he got the key to the city. And that was also great because he's been preaching to me about growth for a long time. Mm. you know what I mean?

He like, yo flip, you gotta grow. And that was great. He did a amazing performance shout out to the, the monk dancers. They they did amazing. That shit was fire man to be there and to not be looked at as this content, this not content, this skit nigga that's going crazy. It feels good 'cause day two was better than day one.

Shit. Fuck ho Hogan Love Hulk Hogan, man. You did right? Yeah. Yeah. Fucking man. What am I doing here? Who is this? Who is this? Mr. Young for our part.


Part of the Show. What's Up is a million dollars a lot of money. To You. Well answer. No, well I'll finish. I ask that question. I ask that question to people all the time when we start talking about money. And it surprises me when people who've never seen half of that, let alone a quarter of it. They say, no, it's not a lot of money. I'm not a millionaire. And I say It is a lot of money. But it'd be great to get that answer from people who have it or have seen It. is that a question? He just answer His own question? No, he he's saying to us, what do we No, no, no. He not saying to us. He's asking the panel what we feel about million dollars And if we think so a million dollars is, I I still think a million dollars is a lot of money.


It's A lot of money. It is. I do. And when people say a lot of money, I think they confuse it with life changing money. A lot of times people, it's also Life changing money. A million dollars is life changing money? It can be. It can be. No It is now it can be It is, But but she says it can't be. 'cause it depends on how You spend it. don Don't clean it up for it. Y'all. Let's, let's have the debate. Let's have the debate. I say It is life changing money. I say today it's not Enough to live the rest of your life without having to work Today in, in northern New Jersey and New York. A million dollars is not life changing money. It's not at all. It's not not even close. Yes. It is a million Dollars will change my life and I'm not poor. And there's plenty of people like Parks. Yeah. If I got an extra million dollars today, it would do some something to my life.


I mean, I think we take it a change and we we gonna start being semantic key with change. Of course it could change. You could go buy a new car, which would Oh yeah. Inherently change your life. We talk. But When I think when people say change your life, they mean like drastically change your life. If if, if we gave you another million dollars today, if you already have one, don don't know. But if we gave you another million dollars today, it could buy you a house. That would change your life. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? But it wouldn't take you outta here. So. I think that's what people mean when they say change your life or life changing money. That's a big change. It is they think life changing. No life changing. Where it's like no object. No, there's no stress. Exactly. You're Not, now I have freedom. That's what they mean.


That's Not what life changing means to me. That's what they don don't have to work Anymore. I think that that's what life changing means to a lot of people. To a is that of People. They say life changing. 67% of Americans don't have an ancillary $500 in the event of an emergency. What are y'all talking about right now? you right About that. I agree with that. I'm not disagreeing with you. I think it's how you use the money though, Joe. It it can't, It It can't be. I mean if You if You agree with that, then you, it's maybe I'm missing misunderstanding. You, if you agree with that, then it seemed like you would agree that a million dollars is life changing money for most people in America. Right this second. He asked us what we thought. He said, yo, most people I asked, they say no, even people that don't have bread. And he said to him, It is so he wanted to ask us.


Most of the people thought that people in my network, including the millionaires, multimillionaires and billionaires that I know, I still think about 75 to 80% of people in my life, a million dollars would change their life. Most of the people I know, a million dollars would absolutely change their life. Shit. Maybe for a short term, maybe it's Not. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's not retirement. I gotta do nothing. Change your life ever again. But it's gonna change your life from A, from a semantical standpoint, of course it'll change your life. But a million dollars won't. It'll help but it won't, it's not gonna sustain it. Yeah, it will help most. Yeah. I still gotta come here every Tuesday and Friday probably.


So when niggas are saying like life changing, they mean like, you know it's It is drastic. It is semantic. I guess It is semantic. It will Semantic. We just understand it different. Ish and male sound like if I still gotta work, then you ain't life changing me. That's what I'm getting from y'all. Yes. Agreed. I don't view it like that. I'm still doing the same things I was doing before I got this million dollars then where did it change my life? But what I might've been able to make a, a big ticket purchase, like you said, like a house or something like that. So now my living situation is differently. But But, yeah, I'm Still still, but I'm still, I have to maintain days. I I have to go to work to maintain this. Correct.


No, You niggas are spoiled entitled privilege. Fuck you nigga. Sound crazy. Are you on this side too? You on this side's Life changing. Yeah. I think I'm not life changing when they're saying, I think his question is asking life changing. Not really. Is it a lot of money? So yes, I'm on that side. I don't take a mill to be life changing. Especially here. I'm also, It is relative but I'm talking about here where we live at the biggest Purchase they love. I've seen nigga seen, I Have a friend that won, won a million dollars last year and I can't, I haven't spoke to him in a little while. But it changes life for the better. Absolutely. I've seen people change their life with ways. Somebody I Know a Million dollars, somebody I know last year I told the story they hit a million dollar scratch off.


Yeah. Say My man, they hit a million dollar scratch off both of the, it's a husband and wife couple, they still work. Yeah. Same. Same job. Same everything. They got a little addition put on the back of their house. you know what I'm saying? They bought cars. But so again, from a semantical standpoint, yes it changes your life. It's gonna change something. It's gonna change some things. But I don't think it's just, you know that that big. I think Y'all life changes. People leaning on the semantical part of it. I'm, I don't think it's so semantical life. Life. I Saying if that's the case, 10 grand changes your life. But life Changes. No it don't. Life yours. And that's the point. I'm not thinking about me Ish back to my percentage of people bust somebody, people in my network, somebody, 75% of the people in my network, $10,000.


None of, if I hand it to 'em, nobody's gonna say this was life changing. That is not the same as a million dollar. We had a touch up here at all. No, we had a touch up here. Hold up. And that. And that's the point. If You get an extra million dollar, not you, but if somebody get an extra million dollars how they plan, they will. And they estate changes that instant. Yeah. That instant it changes. I don't know what y'all talking about. And don't let them be I don know what y'all talking about. Don't let them be entrepreneurial or good with money in any type of way. Then it absolutely could change your life. Because You can grow It. You can take the mill and turn it into a hundred in some years. I'm not disagreeing. We, I think we all in agreement. I don't agree with you and Mel. I Think how we, how we looking at It is, is is just different. I think from homeboy's question, I thought that that's what he was trying to convey.


You understand what I'm saying? Yes. Again, if I give the average person 10 grand, You can say it's not life changing. It's a bunch of motherfuckers at a bus stop every day. That is life. Lemme get back to his question. It's life changing. His very first question, I'm gonna read this again, is a million dollars a lot of money. To You. Yes. That's his question. It is question mark right there. I say yes. Yes, Me Too. He then goes on, I ask that question to people all the time when we start talking about money. And it surprises me when people who've never seen half or let alone a quarter of that, they say it's not a lot of money. I'm not a millionaire. And I say It is a lot of money. It'd be great to get that answer. So he ain't never even said life changing. No, but that's what he didn't say. Oh, he didn't say life changing. He's Never Yes.


A lot of people equate a Lot money said It is a million dollars a lot of money to, I think all us say, I don't wanna make an argument that's not that. And the People that he's speaking to that are saying no are most likely saying no because they view the million dollars as not life changing. That's Okay. That's why it's okay. Million dollars. I think everybody A million dollars is absolutely a lot of money. These Phones down man, don don't care how you slice it. A million dollars is a lot of money. You know what I'm saying? Like a million dollars is gonna change. Change your fucking Life. It's a lot of money. I don't care what I don't gonna fuck how you look at It. Write some expert quote unquote on the internet and say, And now they put their little list out and shit. Yeah. Million dollars today is only X really Worth this amount.


And I don, after you Do this and this and this, the million dollars is gone. Yeah, that's true. But you're like, It is gonna be changed But you able do this and this and this. Yeah. Damn. You couldn't do it Before. This nigga, right above him need a lot of help from us. But It is a long Paragraph. I mean, what's up man? We ain't did one of them in a minute. Anyway. What's up everybody? Okay. Mostly the Parks because he is my f Hey buddy, I'm going through a relationship situation and I need your help. It's my first time reading this. I don't know what he's about to say but this's long. Okay. Okay. I'm almost 29 talking to a 21-year-old. Yep. Mistake number one. She about to, life is like a whirlwind. She about to spend this jaded. We we met When.


I was 18 in college. She was an undergrad. I was in graduate school. Hold on. Wait, hold On, hold right there. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back. Random ages again. Yes. It's a type. I'm almost 29 talking to a 21-year-old. Okay. We met when she was 18 in college. Oh, She was 18 you said. Said he. She Was an undergrad. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I was in graduate school. She called me ugly to her friends and thought I didn't hear when we first met. She's still in college at the moment. I have since graduated. My partner and I rarely argue, we mostly laugh about how we never argue.


Most of the reason why we never argue is because I understand that she's so much younger than me and is still growing up experiencing life. Therefore I cannot get mad at little petty things because I remember When, I was 18 to 21. I was doing whatever, especially in college lately, we've gotten a lot serious talking about a potential official relationship. Sometimes even having a child together comes up. Now the problem is I think she's embarrassed of me or doesn't think I'm quote unquote cool enough for her and her friends. I'm sure it's the age difference, but I'm cool as fuck to my friends LOL.


It's not the age difference. Yeah. Everybody fuck with me for real. You. If you gotta say that my brother then don't they not then they don't. They don't. But these young niggas a lot. Well, but these young niggas got a different type of cool. We had our first public argument the other day at a small function in the city. I felt like because I'm Oh, I felt like she was acting fake and different. She Is. She Probably is. It wasn't a showing me attention thing because I had my crew with me as well. Just the personality of her changes when it's just with me versus with her friends. It happens versus with me and her friends present, that bothers me because I'm the same person with everyone.


It's hard for me to understand. I called her out on it and, and she got slightly upset because we're still good. We ended up, we ended up not staying together that night like we planned. Oh, young Niggas. My question To, You guys is, am I bugging? I don't want to be in a situation where I'm being lied to about how this girl really feels about me. The switching of personalities and how you even speak and tone switches up. More information. This was my first time being around her friends. Oh, Oh. Shit. She's always said she likes to keep her friends and boyfriends separate. That is, I've been telling her I need to be around them sometimes for safety reasons.


Another red, big red flag. What safety reasons babe. What's the biggest red flag we had? Lemme read this again. But I've been telling her I need, I need to be around them sometimes for safety reasons. Okay. I read them wrong. Okay. He needs to be around them. Yeah. For safety reasons. Yeah. Y'all still lost in their own phone? No, no. I Got it. He lost Joe. I've been got this, I've been got this. I'm gonna let Ice tell her It's lessons and she understands that. So she invited me to this function. Please call if you need more info. No, we ain't Gotta call you And thanks for the help. Hey homeboy, if you think I'm ever picking up this phone, I'll toss it. To. You y'all. No, I'm tossing it to ice. This is all red flag bro. I wanted to be Ice and then Mel. If she don't wanna introduce you to her friends or family, don don you.

She don't know that She keep turning around So she, so she's walking, she's walking like a 95-year-old woman. She got that Walking Behind. That's how she's walking. Yeah. I look up because you know, you know VIP service. I look up, there's a 95-year-old couple in front of us and I'm just lockstep with them not passing them for like five minutes.

Learn this before. Jail. Basics. He's nuts. Corey. Don't give a Fuck. He is nuts. Nuts. Yes. Like This. Rude. No, just nuts in his, in his thinking. Got it. Got it. Yeah. I think he's got me by it. Leaps and bounds. I do. Corey is Cory's nuts. For real. I was gonna play this Oma Lay sleeper. I really feel for Omar Lay. He did an interview saying he let one of them artists, one of them fucking artists come over there and hear his album with all of these different sounds that he was working on trying to reinvent shit. And the artist went and put out a album with all of those sounds. So Omalee had to go and rerecord his entire project and get it done.


Now because I listened to some of that shit, I know exactly who that man is talking about. I'm not gonna say or snitch but boy is he right. I say he wanna snitch on them. True Snitch on me. I'm not gonna snitch. Homeboy tried to put out an album that wasn't really like the albums that he put out and it sound like it. So I feel bad for artists when that happens. Joiner Lucas has a story like that. Plenty of people have a story like that of letting people hear something that they working on and a nigga go and just jack your shit. I feel bad anytime I hear that. So my heart goes out to Oma le maybe next podcast. I play a sleeper from him. Oh he might have to wait because Doshi put out a mix tape Doshi put out a mix tape. Hold up, let me get the name of it 'cause it's absolutely fire. Absolutely fire. Hold up here.


Do do do do do do. Here we go. Alligator bites never heal. The Doshi Mix tape is absolutely fire. Have a sleeper from that coming sometime soon too. But I am going to go with Xavier, Omar and LA and this record is called Favorite You.


If you, You know Brand new music from Xavier Omar featuring la That record is called Favorite in your phone and on DSPs right now.


Shout out to Xavier Omar that truth be told, EP is absolutely fire. Five tracks. Y'all check it out friend of the show. Shout to him. I like that. That was hard. All right, I'm gonna go up to Buffalo. The the Drake fenced the page finally put out the buffalo freestyle that Benny and Drake did. Oh okay. And then once that happened, Benny snatched it and put a three pack out on DSPs called Buffalo Butch Volume One. Before you play that really quick, if you're Benny, are you angry at all at how this Transpired?


Extremely Got it. That's it. I'm extremely angry. I'm pissed. I'm tight. I am absolutely pissed. But, but even not the time. So now even further he puts the three pack out and I don't know why but they snatched it down. They took it down. It didn't get clearance probably. Wait, wait, wait. What? Yes. Yeah. Snatched the whole thing. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah The three pack Out You can, I guess He put out You Can do that. I guess It had three, three records On it. But it's not Drake putting it out. Yeah you don. Exactly. When. you upload some shit. Lemme tell you. Clear. Exactly. So. I. Technically I'm even more mad now. Are, you shitting me. So now it's out there. C DQ quality from plot twist page. So now he said okay cool, let me go take this chance to put out Capitalize off of it and y'all strike it down.


But it wasn't, I'm not getting on this now. But that's the type of shit that niggas is talking about. That's the type of shit that niggas is talking about. But That might not have been him And see that it gives him the plausible deniability to say yo what? But it still might not have been him. For real. It's him. Because when we did it, it didn't get cleared. We did this before any fake pages came up. Before labels came up, we did this. And I came To You and said hey let's love what we doing. And you said nah. And Benny had to respect that because he got the direct no from them. Now fake page pops up, leaks it. Benny think that's cool 'cause he on the internet as a consumer. Of course we think that that's Drake. That plausible deniability. You're right.


There's plausible deniability. I don't think an artist that had his shit denied by the biggest artist in the world and now the slap is out and I couldn't reap the games of it. Don't think he Cares. That's fucked up. I don't think he cares about deniability. That's craziness. That's fucked up. But Benny is a classy individual. It is never gonna come up. It's never Gonna come up. He ain't gonna say a word about it Because maybe you want that other Drake feature. Right. If we did one, maybe we can do two. True. But That is a crop of I'm tight. Shit. I'll be tight, tight, tight, tight. And it's fire from both of 'em. Yeah. I'm damn near triggered from that Are. you shitting Me. It's three. Well I wasn't playing that song was It is he put three records out. One is a penny and Shaq with 38 special with Sp. Yep. Fab Records Buffalo Freestyle and the one that I'm playing is hard way.


Benny and Fab My bad. Go ahead. That shit hard. But. yeah so that's, that's my sleep of today. Hey Benny, let me let these niggas know something off the rip. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Remember that. Look. Hey yo some niggas learn the hard way. One 40 in Broadway. I handle Mines in Broadway. You handle yours. The Broadway.
