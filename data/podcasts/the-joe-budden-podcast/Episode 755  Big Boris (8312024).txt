But for this generation, It is, yeah, they track. Yeah. Did, did, did, did we not enjoy the project? I know it just came out. It might be too soon. Maybe we need another Listen. Maybe. Maybe we needed to grow on us. I need quite a few more listens. This nigga Ice. What? Man, it's hard for me. I compare artists to their discographies. It is hard for me to hear. Dark Sky, paradise, big Sean. And then hear pretty much Finally famous Big Sean. Yeah. This, this, it's gonna sound really fucked up.


What I'm about to say. And I apologize if anybody gets offended, but I'm just not a fan of mental health. Rapping Big Sean. Like the, the, the therapy, the meditation, all that positivity. It just don't sound right Authentic in music. No, no, no. It's authentic. It's who you are today. Okay. But it, it almost feels like something's missing now in the music. Like you, you've gotten to a place of peace and tranquility in your life that it don't sound good in the music. And that's not fair because you want somebody to better themselves. However they, so It's almost like the critique that Mary j Blige used to get a lot, you know, whenever she was in pain she made really good music.


But then when she was happy, people were like, I wouldn't say that. 'cause what don don't feel like he was putting like a ton of pain in some of the music That we loved. Yeah. So I don't, that's why I don't, don don't, It is not that. Okay. It wasn't pain. It is just, he just sound too peaceful. Yeah. Like Chance Junior. Yeah. It's like Chance Junior Junior, like on this project I heard a lot of, oh, I love my wife so much and then when I'm hurt, I'm calling my family. My family told me that I gotta keep going and When I keep going. I still must do it. I'm saging the house. I can get rid of these demons. The devil is by me like dog, like respectfully because I like that shit. I just don't like him doing it without big budgets.


That I feel like what you're saying and a little bit of what you're saying is kind of what I'm saying with, I, I like my Big Sean with a bigger budget because dark, dark, dark sky paradise. Dark sky paradise. And I mean, this may be credit to Drake, but Blessed is kind of a mental health record. Yeah. I live that life. I deserve. That's true. Funny. And, but he just made it work. Beat It is Dressed up in a way that, so on the Nose beat. Yeah. The beat was dark. The hook is fired. Like he's given us fly mental health bars before. I just don't like it without the big production and the, and the big hook. I don't wanna sound like, I feel like we're being hard on Sean because the album's not bad. It's not bad. It's not a bad album.


So Where's to me? No It's not. So where's the big production? It's Not a bad, it's not a bad project. Where's, how's the big production missing? Is it, does it have something to do with him being independent and funding it himself or something? I don't think, Well this project I don don't say independent. It says whatever the new new name of Def Jam is. Def Jam, umbrella, Def Ink, whatever they did licensed by Def Jam, licensed by UMG. All of that under there. Yeah. So real, real quick. If we, if I asked you guys to elaborate on a, a fabulous correlation, it, it would offend somebody Potentially don don't, I don't want to dive too deep. 'cause I mean he'd been around So. I would, I guess I would want to hear, 'cause he said that you jumped right out there. So obviously there's some basis to your claim.


So I. I want to hear what he had to say about that. 'cause he been around it. He understand. I'm not, I'm not mad at, I'm not mad at the correlation. I don't understand though. Like what? Like, because Fab don don't understand. I just don't understand. don don't understand. Fab had a a great career to me for Sure. It's it's not a knock. It's not a knock. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. Yeah. But don don't understand the correlation Saying that he's this generation's fab. Yeah, like did like He's just kind of like, well Fab. He's not ho he's not And Sean's not Drake. He's not at that level. Okay. He still makes very good music. It just doesn't necessarily reach to that. Oh. It sound like both of them had the potential to go to that next level and never got there. Yeah. And that's not a shot.


You feel like there's a ceiling, it's not a shot. Yeah. And it's not a shot, but it sounds like a shot. I see Shit. I see what you're saying. It, it don't sound the nicest but it's not a bad thing. But may, I mean for me, one of the only differences between them two is Fab had a really, really, really deep girl bag. Shawn's Got Sean. I know Shawn's got a girl, girl bag. I just don't think It is on par with Fab's Girl bag. That's my opinion. One and two Fab was embraced by every mc in his era. Yes. There, there was never another mc that was trying to hinder him, blackball him, challenge him or just hold him back. And I think some of that does exist for Shawn.


Like Shawn's class I don't feel like was the kindest to him. Especially When. He wasn't around yet. But. yeah. But, but, but with Shawn's class, he still got in the, he was able to get out there with all of them cats the same way. Same way Fab was. He is got records with basically everybody. Everybody from that era Sean has records with on the strength of Kanye Maybe Whatever reason he has those records. And he did. I understand that. And he big Sean on them records. Fab never had a Kanye. That's true. That's true. That That is a big difference. Fab had clue and do. Yeah, That's true. Shout Tolu. Dur like Oh for sure. Shout the Klu door. Hey Dora, I thought you were supposed to call me. Do I never called Anyway.


Was There any standout features on this album? Apologize where it sounds like he's speaking directly to Kanye. That sound, look, apologize to me. Sounded more like the sound I'm, I was looking for for Big Sean. I like that little bit. This record was got I like the Aaron. Aaron Ellen Kane, she body there of, oh wait, wait. Oh she couple. Yeah. Sorry about No, no, no, no. We, yeah. Yes we lied. Yes. What is happening on my phone? Please Excuse me. Pardon me for this ghetto bullshit. Damn y phones. No I, no I had a needle on fucking repeat earlier. Let's see. Here we go. Big Sean.


Apologize. Here we go. Are we live? No, no, no, no. Yeah. Yes we lie. Yeah. I'm just playing it from the phone so we can talk over it. But. yeah, Got it. Got it, Got it. But this is kind of, if he was going to go that way, this sounded a little more like what it should sound like to me. Yeah. Somewhere the choir's supposed to come in, Comes at the end. But this is nice. Yeah, yeah. It is, Talk to Kanye real quick. Apologize. Fake ass snake ass. You say sorry When. you not dug your grave.


Bitch you got a lie. Holy shit. Only thing you good at. Ain't no way I am going out like that. Like that. I ain't mad at you. But I ain't forgot but I ain't forgot. I'm gonna hold your ass accountable a lot. Oh surprise. I'm on a tie. Why would you ever deny your go apply against me? Apologize. And you wanna say you sorry When. you not want to be friends and do business. Man. How could We talk about me? 'cause you lost the privilege of talking to me. Yeah, Throw some dirt on that. Yeah. Yeah. Throw some dirt on him. Sean, your Own grave.


Now do what you best at nigga. Lie gimme the space, gimme the time. Alright. You get the point. You did you get the point. I, I enjoyed that. What record? You said Parks? That was the record I was talking about with the, the the girl singer at the end. One of these at the top. I fucked with was it Typecast? Yeah, I think I like typecast again. I only heard this album at 6:00 AM A quick two times on a run through. Hey I got pimping in my blood. Got my man girl in the tub while she wearing somes. I done bus to the point that all I care about is love turn the family all execs no such thing as Richard N two real under Sean's teachings.


Acronym for trust. Initials in the sheets got my logo and the rug built in alarm clock and Got it tummy to get up. When I walk in the arena. I feel like I'm Jerry Bus. Bus and we shut Y Coachella. They thought it was hairy styles. You know what It is, what's the problem? And this has been a, a complaint that other people have had about Big Sean for years. But I, it didn't really stand out to me until this album and maybe the last project, I guess due to the production budget being a little different. Sean's flow and like delivery just be so monotonous. Mono monotone, mono It is just like mono.


It's you not, which is Another thing that fab kinda sometimes has too. You not really, it almost sound like you don't even, you not even putting no effort or nothing until you just lackadaisical on the beat. And it just makes it almost, it almost makes the song sound a little boring here. Even if you saying fly shit. Yeah. Yeah. Like the way you say it also matters a lot. It does. And with some of the other records, the features that he's been on, he had bigger production so it could craft around it a little bit. Make it sound a little bit better. But you just might have been in the room with some killers and you tried to step up your delivery and and put more effort in. Or you're in the room with Kanye idea or something saying Ask that though real quick. Is it the Kanye effect where when Kanye put his hand on you, he gives you so much and and you reap so much benefits from, you know, I guess from production I think you just learning being around those situations.


I know but When, you leave it When, you leave it When, you leave him now You gotta do it Yourself. Now you gotta do it yourself. But It is not the same. It doesn't hit the same. You might got your homeboys in the studio. That's just like not good. No, but I'm just talking about like even production wise or even like it doesn't hit the same. Right. Has anybody seen a good side after the Kanye effect, if you understand what I'm saying? Has anybody like left Kanye and still went up and still Elevator? Yeah, still Elevator. Yeah. Probably not. No. Is the answer to that It is It is a great question and no, I can't say that two chain saw his peak with Ye he Lives with a lot of resources besides just the Beats push Tee keeps it keeps going up.


That's true. But he was, he was with Pharrell then before. I'm Just saying he's saying that left Ye but When you mean keep going up And he also hasn't really fully left ye that we've heard yet. Yeah, well I mean I'm just talking about, I'm count pushing this for some reason. And Also if he leaves Ye and then falls back to Pharrell and them, he's, he's okay. Like he's still got tutelage and people to push him and shit around him. Got it. What a fucking nice nice fucking double bed situation. For real. I get to leave Kanye and hit hit Pharrell. Right. Just, yeah. I don, I don't expect that guy to ever leave and I got McDonald's money and Arby's money and all this other money. I don't expect him to ever leave. Yeah. No don don't. don don't see it. No one at all. Yeah. Designer had did the whack off. Oh man Z had to go rattle that snake after Kanye left.


Who was on good music was Big Sean Ti then Tiana had that public fallout. Yeah. Yes. With Kanye. Common Was over there. Did Yeah, common got away from him. Started reading children's books. Yeah. Okay. Common. Okay. When did, when did two chains get away from Kanye? Which project? Because I'm thinking Boats. Boats Was was Boats Is Pharrell I don don Don't no. His debut album, not debut, excuse me. But his album that had no Lie and all that, that was Kanye. That's Kanye. The very next album was Pharrell. Okay. The very next album was Pretty Girls like Trap Music. That was a great album. Which is a great album.


That's probably my favorite. So, which was better than the previous two? So we could say that two chains actually had an well how what about Numberwise? What did it do Numberwise Impact Wise, saying that, you know what, that album with the two chains on it, you know what time it was, you know what that was Everybody Move. Yeah. But that was also with a lead single of No Lie featuring Drake on that album. That wasn't the lead single of that album. No Lie was No it was not. I bet you Oh Shit Boats of the album I'm talking about No Lie was not the lead single. He did the, he did the chains on two albums. No Lie wasn't the lead single No Lie Was off of based on a true story. And it was the first single Yes no Bos is the next album Based on a true story.


It is B-O-A-T-S. It is Boats two. I'm looking at, I'm sorry, I'm talking about Yeah, the first, first one. Okay, gotcha. Gotcha. It is No lie, It is the single that nigga know all album spending from Where album is by Heart Suspend. It was a mixtape record from True Religion. The DJ Drama Gangster Girls album. That wasn't even an album. Well this album had 90 singles. So I mean he didn't rest his hat. Hat on I gotta a Drake Single. That album got 90 singles. But that first single was that which did it for that album. He couldn't do no wrong at that time. No uc Chance couldn't do, he was on fire. He wasn't bro ly lying on I know what you're saying, but he was, he could do no wrong at that time. But back to back to Big Sean. Back to Big Sean. Yes. Yes.


I'm gonna living with it a little bit more. I only listened to it one time, skimmed through early. I, I I, I gave it a quick two listens. There was, I liked the record with, with Gunna It is what It is. I did like that superstar record and I guess it's, it's The It is the first song Iconic. I'll fuck with that one. I did your expectations. He didn't meet your expectations. I don't have expectations for Big, I don't know what to get with Big Sean. Okay. Today So I did. I really went in with no expectations. But at the same token, there are some, you, you have a classic project. So after a while I am going to just run back to that like, all right, cool.


This was, this was all right, this is where you are today. This is what you want today. Cool. It's not fully for me off the first Listen, I can just go right back. But, but I have this in the Tuck, so I'm cool. Gotcha. And I mean, I'm happy for sure. And if he's, if he's in a happy mental space and that's great, you know, then that's all that really matters at the end of the Day. True story. Yeah. I guess. I mean, how can we hate on that say that Joe You can't say that we hate on it When Chance did it, all of us collectively hated on it. When Chance came out and said, yo, I'm living good, I'm happy, I'm healthy and I'm all about my family now. We sent him back to Disrupt his family. Yeah, sure.


Still got some shit on this album. Chance, chance ain't had that. But we need to hold ourselves accountable. We sent Chance to go We on chance go and divorce. And what did he do? Niggas gonna always choose work. We gonna choose work. We did. We did. He went and divorced. He did. He did. And has been rapping hard as ever since. I just wanna point that out. That Is, That is is true Toxic. Yeah. That's crazy. Sometimes your girl at home, your girl at home is either going make your bars the best thing they ever been or she's gonna bring them all the way down. Y'all don't want hear this. Sometimes you gotta keep the toxic shit up in the house for the sake of the bars. True. That's plenty of years. I was running around just freestyling toxicity in the house. Hey, we gotta wrap to make a living.


It ain't no time for flowers and cupcakes. Nobody wanna hear that happy shit. Yeah. Nobody wanna hear that shit. They didn't want to hear it anyway. Anyways. Yeah. And don don't know what TDE had TDE has against Sean, but they did it again with this Doshi project, which I Heard is good. I I haven't listened to it. I like the singles that I heard before. It dropped. I can't wait to listen to it. But It's a long project. I, I got a couple songs through and I'm like all right, I like this. But I have to really sit with it it Looks like. I mean it's long and track It long, the run time. 47 minutes. Yeah, the run time ain't long. That was too long. 47 minutes Sean. Twice. It was too long for me. Mic check mic sha 1 2 1 2.

Children's Indie Rock album. Excuse. Listen man, people out there expanding, trying something different. Sure. Maybe. Sure. You said Juicy J put a jazz album out. He did. He got number one on the Apple charts with it too. Running Plus or Juicy Jazz's. It's a really dope album too. It's a really dope album. Juicy J who says he is getting paid from 90% of the music industry. Huh? What do you guys think about that man? Might be a little bit of cap, but I like it. I mean fuck. It won't, I mean, 90% of the fucking rap industry is taken from them. So even if he is not actually getting paid from 'em, he should be. Or I have gotten paid from 90% of these niggas one way or another at some point. Something Loophole in there somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Something. So I be true. Yeah. Fuck it.


Juicy Jay is like down South Ghostface to me. Like he never really does wrong. Yeah. That's on my list. That's exactly why I'm on the Couch podcast. And I got a Juicy J beating and call Loy Banks. Yeah. That shit was hard. I love that record. That shit was hard. I don Dunno if that's what you supposed to do. What? The trips to jb That record was hard. That's trying to be unorthodox. Ooh, I'm a freak with this. Shout out to Juicy Jay. Shout to Juicy and Lloyd Bass for that matter. True. What else? What else, what else, what else, what else came out? Let me see. don. Don't know if anything else came out that I need to talk about. Andre 3000 dropped a film. He, he did.


And I, I I went, I was very excited. Huge Entree fan. It it's accompanying the jazz record. Yeah. So I was So. I was real excited. And I, it's just him in like a blue room and he's got a flute and I, I just, it's, and that's, it's an hour and a half long. I scrolled right through it. Like You can drag and watch it drag along. It was literally just one scene the whole time. Him like playing the flute. Playing the flute. Playing the flute. Yeah. And like lay, sometimes he's laid down. Sometimes he stood up. Sometimes he what? Spoke to hookah or something and there was a bunch of awesome. It was, it was something. It it was a thing. Andre slowly moving up. I scam her list, man. Nah, that's a good scam. It is a great scam. That's art. That's Art. I like it's artsy art. It's a good scam. Archie scam. And that blue might symbolize something I'm sure.


Yeah. Yeah. It all means something. Maybe kind of blue like Miles Davis is This shit. Might you Sure. Shit might kill cancer or something. Yo, it might be some megahertz fancy. It could be that Dr. Strange. I'm telling you he might, it might be some funny shit. Do we believe these Travis Scott numbers? I mean he's running some, some little games. He's putting out some some packages and Deluxe after Deluxe. Deluxe after Deluxe. So it's possible. And I do think that his fan base is rabid enough to have put up what it was 2 52 80 some shit. Oh, my last I saw was two 17. Oh two 17, whatever the number was. But It's an album that's been rereleased Knock it off.


Yeah, it's it's it's knock it off it's days before Rodeo, which was a mix tape. I mean, classic project of his. For sure I bought it. So I mean. And I'm only part-time, I guess. No, I'm a pretty big Travis Fan. I'm a big Travis fan. I've of course had it, but it still stands out to be, it's all streaming. Oh, it's not. I mean Well no, he's doing vinyl too. He's doing vinyl. Yeah. But I mean, they're getting it off of streaming. So 217,000 on an old project. I can kind of believe it. 'cause I personally, I mean I have it. I've had it, but I was excited to see it there, to be able to go listen to it, press play. And I did it twice in the week. And like I said, I'm not as diehard as some of his fans are.


So I could see it. I could see it. You think it's real? I I can see it. Okay. I'm on the other side of that one. Hey, yo, you, I just want to point out to you, I'm sorry, flip that numbers all across the board. Everywhere else are down for sure. Like down, down as in what YG do 8,000. Damn. Really? I didn't anybody else talk about YG shit between 20 and we never talked about that. We didn't. And we should. Everybody else is like between 20 and 30,000. That being said, catalog music does really well. Typically They're saying that that Travis Scott is one of the first examples of the latest trend in music where the artists are signing directly to tech companies.


Mm. And the tech companies can play with the numbers. The tech companies are offering different packages. Interesting. Hmm. I don't believe those numbers. I for second, don don't believe him.

All of a sudden people are like, are y'all together? He doesn't wear his ring. you know, it's draining. How does it make you feel that she's feeling like that every day? For me it has to feel real smile for social media and smile for the cameras and I can't fake it. I think once you start worrying about the comments and what the blogs are saying, you start to alter your life to some people that don't even know you or give a fuck about you.

What else is important or unimportant? I see the internet has found some of my old heat again. I love when that happens. When, I'm home and then the internet get wind of a clip that came out like eight months ago and then y'all wanna start heating me up and then I'm supposed to come in here after reading all of y'all comments and change my opinion on something.


That little Steph Curry, Boris Kojo. I didn't see That making some rounds. No, it made the rounds. Shit. That shit took off. It's like three or four clips that came took off. It was gone crazy. It was outta here. And boy did they have mean things to say about Joseph. Anthony Bun Jr. On my birthday week every year it seems like right around August. Shit get crazy for me. It does. It is It is the algorithm. So. I want to come in here and double down and I think y'all are stupid and y'all totally missed the fucking point. I don't need the internet to tell me that Boris Kojo is a tough night out at the club.


Why do y'all think I need y'all to tell me that Boris Kojo is probably more handsome in the eyes of women to Steph Curry Got it. Who the fuck was talking about that? I said that a nigga with a billion dollars is going leave with shorty before the handsome guy and I stand in that now. That's how you throw shots of H.

You said yo, they choosing them niggas but fucking me too. Wait, I'm not saying that. So the choice isn't really being made. Exactly. I'm not saying that Boris can't get pussy if Steph is around.

Yeah. I want to put it back on her now. I'm But what's so, but what's so strange is he posts this like, or or whoever is responsible for this caption, whether it's click Beatty or not. It's like, it's supposed to be a dig at her that she's a 41-year-old relationship coach or whatever the case is. And she's single. We looked at this woman. She's highly intelligent. She's, you know, probably gainfully employed. She might be single by choice, but like people don't What? That's right. Walk it off. Walk it the fuck off. Look Off. Don't throw up. Don't throw up. Don't shit throw up in here nigga. He has a take of walk. Don't, don't do that shit. Throw up shit. And here. But It's like he considers that a dig, but yet he's the one I'm you, I'm with you's.


The he's the one that's got eight children from three different baby mamas and talking about having more children but is terrified of marriage. Okay. Who's the more dysfunctional one here? Really calling their shit up. You guys can come back into camera for no, no, No, no. Let him stand there. Look silly. Yeah, she got a point. She makes a point. Ha. Come back over and fucking argue With me. She make a point. Please. I'm not as articulate as you. She'll kill me. Please get silly. She'll done my mic. I can't do, I can't play with her. I can't play mental tennis as well. I didn't really see I'm with you. Look, I watched it, I watched more of the clipse. Her points were amazing points. I stand with her points with regards to creating broken homes.


Totally in agreement with that. With that being said, we're not making a comparative, they both can be dysfunctional in their separate relationships. And, and she talked a lot about her own prior dysfunction and the work that she did in order to get to where she is. She did. Which is why she can have the conversations that she has. 'cause she's taken accountability. I, I saw she said she was proposed two, I think four times. And she said two. This what she did say, two or three of 'em might've been my fault. I heard. Right. And she said that. But she didn't necessarily say they Well yeah, she did. Two or three of 'em were felt she, she took accountability for those particular relationships. Not going to marriage. That still doesn't mean that she is.


And I agreed with her. I'm just saying they both can be dysfunctional in their separate ways. It don't mean that he's worse off than she is. You understand what I'm saying? They both can be And dysfunctional. You could be toxic. She could be toxic. Y'all both are toxic. It don't mean that I'm more toxic than you are or vice versa for that matter. Yeah, but she didn't give anything thing That would make us say that. True. True. True, true, true. That she is. So him saying you're 41 or 43 and single that don't say, Hey, I'm living in such a toxic way. True. Not at all. No. I'm, I was just addressing Mel's point. But That's like, that's being 41.


She's successful and she's attractive. So that potentially could mean that she's single by choice. That don't necessarily mean that it don't have to mean because It is a lot of attractive 40 something year old women. And just from my own personal stance, I don't feel like fighting nobody. A lot of them are not single by choice. 'cause I know some of them. Why? So what are they? Why are they single? I I think it varies per person. Everybody undesirable stand. That's too hot. It take more than just body in our forties. It takes more than just looks. You are Oh Shit. You cruising for fucking, I ain't, I ain't even peep that My bad.


I'm talking shit. Of course Mel's desirable. But there are some people where that don't, where where that what he's saying right is. Yeah, but I mean like, I get it. It's it's the, it's the same shit that fucking JD Vance is fucking campaigning on talking about single women fucking childless with cats and shit like that. It's like whenever there's a woman who is single, it's like, it's it's like it's it's pointed out. It's pointed out like it's a dig or dog chihuahua, you know what I'm saying? Or a chihuahua. Really? Daisy, come here. Cat size. Guess what? Cat size. But it's pointed out like it's a dig when it's not, it's not when it's not necessarily a dig to the woman. you know what I'm saying? It's like that's your choice of insult when it's not something that I'm even thinking about.


You Love your dog because you know where that comes from. Like niggas quantified a woman's value by a nigga she was attached to. Absolutely. So now if you don't have that, you are not a good woman. I know so many women that are in relationships and marriages that are fucking miserable. you know? So But You got somebody though. But Exact, but that does not mean that It is like a ma a meaningful connection. you know, I'd ra I'd rather be alone than be with somebody that I'm completely miserable with. I would agree. Or that I just, I'm, I'm not connected with. I don't Want that, that way of thinking is kind of newer. So It is, It is, it's a new, it's a new trend. A lot of people can't process that. But also It is because that leads to single by choice. And thats what I'm Talking about.


That is a little cliche. If I'm miserable at home, gimme somebody in house that's miserable too. So, I can look at you like these stupid ass faces. Stupid motherfucker. No, not your I'm cool. Y'all gimme some company with my misery. I'm dying. No, I You wanna watch the show or not? Stupid. Stupid ass. Yo. That's some of the best shit about a relationship. Oh, taking out your day on her. Yo they do it to us. They do. They do they do you think your girl don't come to the house and take her day out on you? Yes. Yeah. What the fuck are we talking about? It only sound bad when it's us. Listen, Lemme tell you something. I will say that you weren, the longer that I am single, the more I'm, I think I'm losing like my freakiness.


How would you know? Okay, we go look, he coming back now. Look, look, look. Now let's clap it up for mail and words. Hey When, you use the words, I like this. I was having a Please. I was having a conversation with my girlfriend and she was talking about the last time that she had a threesome and it was with two guys and what's her name? I know. Shut Up. No, fuck up. I'm Not damn, I'm not giving her her name, but she was talking about the last time that she had a threesome with two guys. And I was just like, oh my god, you make me feel so vanilla.


Like, I don't understand. She was just like me talking about having like a dick in both holes. I'm like, oh my god She with a D. That's a slice. Holy shit. That is like real Eskimo brother shit. Right? Yeah. Trooper, Is that something you're interested in? you know, some women are, there are, yo, we must really be old in vanilla. There are women out there that are very into double penetration. I just, Yeah, no Dual penetration, whatever it called, double, Double dual. Officer DP ain't never, I ain't never doing T And so We do you feel like because of that? Well, No, not exactly that. So then she just, you know, started talking about like her current sex life and how her man's libido is a little low. And she's thinking about They add on game.


She's thinking about breaking up with him because oh, fucking her enough. He ain't fucking her enough. And I'm like, oh, How, how old is she? She's age range. She's in, she's in her late forties. Me. and you a freaky ass. Corey. Corey took the words right outta my mouth. I didn't hear, they didn't hear 'em. So When, you When you say one of the questions you asked earlier, like, yo, why do you think that these people are single some of That? is it Because they're not getting fucked enough? No, She's getting dpd. What the fuck Nigga don't got your dick.


The DP was a minute ago. you know, she's, she's been like, you know, it was a minute Ago. Yeah, she's been in this, I know. Was it a podcast? That was a minute ago. Her ago. She's been in this committed relationship for like, quite a while now. And they have, you know, it's kind of had its ebbs and flows, but she's got a high libido in him. Not so much. And she's just like, I just rather than cheat, I just, I'm thinking we're gonna break up. And I'm like some of Us, no, I, no, I ain't saying that. That's the other reason that niggas will not rush to fuck those women that are 48, 49, 50, 51. They start wanting to fuck you. Like they time on this earth is coming three times a day, three times a day. Like, yo fam Not. And there's a problem with That.


Yes, yes. You like that? No. you know the funny part. No, listen, we got responsibility. Got jobs. They think we are just sexually driven. Deviant. And when they drop they, I wonder Where they get that idea From the internet from y'all. Yes. No dog. Every girl I've ever dated sex drive was way higher than mine. Same. That's a fact. Every girl I've ever like been in a serious relationship with all of their sex drives have been higher than my, and please don't catch up during ovulation week. Why would you do that?

It's slowly become more and more of a lifestyle I enjoy over the years. I'm looking good and getting a lot more Looks my way. She's a stay at home mom, which the whole family loves.


But she claims she's too tired to work out and using the pregnancy, in my opinion, as an excuse to eat badly. What? Oh, this nigga. When. I. Tell y'all this niggas are sick. Crazy niggas are sick. How? See why he said don't use my name. They put up with us. Smart. We're animals. I see exactly why son don't want his name out here.

That said, I am somewhat embarrassed in public as a late Oh Shit. I'm all about BBWs 24 7, 365, twice on days that end in a Y but not know Lizzo Fat chicks.


Oh, with all due respect. This nigga is crazy. How do I convince her to get her fat ass in the gym? Oh my God. I added the fat ass pregnancy aside.

But over the years, go to the gym is getting important. As we get older, I want us to grow together. But she says I'm asking for too much. I think Ish Mike could help a play out. I think so too. Yeah. Hey, hey buddy. That y'all remain nameless. You can the right one. He got you. I. think that Ish Mike could help a player out.

He's ripping her verbally in half. Based on the the, the email, my nigga, you're bugging. You're bugging you. You gonna put stress on your chick that she don't necessarily need once she carrying a child. Exactly. you know what I'm saying? Like that's whack. Maybe once she delivers the child, she didn't, she still a stay home, home mom.


She gonna have two kids. don don't know the ages and a newborn and That is When. you make your move. You know right where she's at. Right in the middle of postpartum.

Depending on how bad she's eating though. Oh she's eating like a slob. It could affect the child. Total slb. All the other shit he's bugging out like fam. That's the last thing that should be on your mind rather her eat a lot during the pregnancy than drink a lot during the pregnancy. That's That is a fact. That's True. That is, they don't drink at all. Absolutely. I mean the girlies say that they don't, they're not supposed to. One day we could have a real talk Oh man.

I've seen them actually on the timeline saying like in the whatever trimester it's okay to do it. Then they say now they justifying it. No, No. They're saying that like And they say wine towards Towards the end. Towards the end. You can towards the end because it will help induce the pregnancy. Yeah. Well labor, I mean labor. Yeah.
