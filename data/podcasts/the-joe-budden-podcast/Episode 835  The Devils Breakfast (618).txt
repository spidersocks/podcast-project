I think I thought it was happy belated father. Oh, he was younger than that actually. Excuse six. He, he's a baby. Shout out to Luther and Shout to you niggas.

And, and telling him for weeks that he been doing that shit again and she asked you to stop. Yeah. Nigga, first of all, we're gonna call you tonight at seven 15 because we know if we call you at 10, my other arm would be broke. So I'm gonna call you at seven 15. Motherfucker Throw niggas over with these little tight jeans. Yeah. Niggas. I'm not shooting at nobody. If I call you at I'm happy to shoot. I'm not afraid to shoot. I just wasn't shooting. You know what I mean? Mark, you said was a good setup. You me, it wasn't a setup. I really was just thought this. All right. How about this from this point on, can the people that like to shoot on here Ish Mark flip?


I Don't like to shoot anymore my guns. Why you, why you stop at them names though? No. Why you started them names? Yeah. Can y'all chill out? Just this episode and next episode we can shoot again. Like let's get a break. White, white flags. I sold all my guns back to the state. They gave me money. I'm not shooting at a motherfucker. I'm waving a white flag. Nigga Don't want a beef in the tra just Nigga can't, he Don't wanna scuff them up. You bought the cleaner Joe. These sneakers are mad. Old dog. The little brush. I don't know what you talking about. I, I never forget it. That sneakers. Yo, what's important? So r Kelly And that's, Y'all were humming r Kelly.


At least we can mention the fact that he was rushed to the hospital today. For what? Because apparently the hospital, the hospital, the jail staff gave him too much meds. He overdosed on whatever meds he was supposed to be getting. So he was rushed out there. But his team is saying they tried to Kill him. That they tried To kill him. That is a plot to murder r Kelly. Yeah. By the prison. Well there was some in, there was an inmate that came forward before, you know, and that stated that they, he was hired to kill r Kelly. I don't know if you heard about that. About that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I never believe that stuff. Oh, you don't believe that stuff? No, I don't believe anything. I, there's some documentation that, you know, You don't believe the man, huh? No, I don't believe it's just him.


It's a few people that when they got these long ass cases, suddenly they all got plots to murder them. And they all want to get out forever. That's all I'm saying. To me, it seems like a legal strategy to me. That's, That's all I see. Mark. If I went to spend the next two years in Hudson County or Essex County, they would try to kill me. Well, yeah, I mean, but you're you Or you would say anybody. They're trying to kill me so I can get the fuck up outta here. Yeah. No, they would try to kill me. You think it So You think, I mean Whitney just be stabbed 14 times with some bullshit? No, I think he really got stabbed. I'm saying though, people using it as a, it becomes a opportunity sometimes. Like, hey, I, I, I ain't mad. I would do the same Thing. Hey yo, if a nigga killed stabbed me 14 times, they was trying to kill me.


And if a nigga's trying to kill me, I'm trying to get the fuck outta here. I'm not. So you talk About it's a opportunity. I think it's a, It is opportunity To save my life. But that's still an opportunity in the, in the Tory case. He's in there for, we are not debating the case at all. Just dealing with the facts and where we at now he's in there for a crime against a woman. A lot of times niggas crimes against kids, crimes against women, they'll fuck you up. That's A fact. That's facts. That Is true. That's facts. But I don't See that being a reason to, To be let out. Yeah. Yeah. No. They just move you to another prison where you can be amongst other people who are charged with and convicted of those same crimes. Or go to pc.


That too. So Meg has the jail riding. Nah, I Didn't say that. I don't think that has anything to do with it. It has nothing to do with that. I didn't say nothing wrong. Niggas know. Niggas know what you go for, what you in there for. I'll be here all day. I don't care if this is how y'all want to deal with it. I'll roll with all of this shit. Alright. No promises against women. I get it. I Agree. Children I give you. But you know, I don't know. I'm just make Lot Niggas in jail did shit against women. Not saying nothing, unfortunately. Anyway, all I'm saying is that I think r Kelly, I mean maybe they gave him more food. Maybe they gave more medicine than he should have. I'm not saying that he's not right about the overdose.


Just like I'm saying Tori really got stabbed. I'm saying The intention was is is Lacking that there's an angle. Yeah. And that there might be an angle here to say, Hey, let me outta prison because of it. That's all I'm saying. I'm just saying they're taken as opportunities to get out. And if, if I was in prison, I would do the same thing. I'm not mad. I'm not, I'm not mad at that. Again, I don't even believe in prison. But what I'm saying is that I'm not sure that there's a grand plot by the US government to, to kill r Kelly is all I'm saying. That seems unlikely. If I was the US government, I would be so pissed that everybody always put the bullshit on my jacket. Well that's because some of these niggas, I may have tried to bust a move on, but the other side, y'all just putting bodies on me now.


Right. And they But They good at it. They killed so many people. They, they could kill Martin Luther King and they can't get to r Kelly. That's all I'm saying. They could kill Malcolm X. They can't get to r Kelly. Like come On. Did he say it was the government trying to kill him? Well if you say it's the, he said it's the prison system. Not a prison nerve, but like the prisons. Oh, that's Possible. Yeah. Careful buddy. I still want to scale. Let's fight. Come on. Chill. Miss my Bad. Hold up. Nah. The first time I seen that JFK doc, I was like, what? Yeah, that's What I'm saying. But they can't get the king r and b. Come on in prison In. Right. That seems like a pretty easy one.


Lay up. Why would somebody want to kill r Kelly? Right. I mean, I could think of some people that would. I Had a good job. I think I'm fine. I'm not even sure if I could think of people that would, the people he thinking about negotiated their kids. Exactly. There's that these, these parents and the victims wanted to stay there. Well, so Isol That's a good point. Stock Stocks there. You gool. Yep. I ain't gonna lie. I ain't lie from this podcast. What'd you learn? I do. Ditto. I'm glad that this could be like some educational shit for me until start.


What you learn. Fuck you man. What you learn, Doctor? Can't you just, lemme sit. Can I just agree with niggas Man? All right. So r Kelly's outta here and no one gives a fuck on these couches. I mean, prayers, prayers, thoughts And prayers And I got no thoughts and prayers for him. You evil. I knew he was gonna say that. Is that the rule? Do we have to have thoughts and prayers for everybody that okay. You graduated to that song. Hey Mark, question for you, since you don't believe in incarceration, what do you think should have happened to r Kelly? Should is an interesting word. Okay. In in, in your utopian society, how would he have been handled? Yeah. Get 'em Man. Well that's a different question.


Okay. So in my non utopian world, I would've hoped, I'm not saying it's right, but I would've hoped he would've been handled a different way. But the streets, the streets would've Handled. Okay, got it. Got it. What I'm street justice. Got it. But in the proper thing, r Kelly would have been managed much earlier, would've been interventions. He clearly has mental health issues. He would've been, he would've been forced to undergo mental health care and treatment. I mean, and separated from society. We would've had civil orders to keep him away from all young people. We've done all the things to protect society while getting, holding him accountable while, While bumping Grind was out. Oh Yeah, for sure. What he knock It off shit. Maybe one. Maybe Lea album. You know what I'm saying That Well that's, yeah, that's what Got, yeah. That's when it, I mean 'cause that was the first sign. Yeah.


You know what I mean? And I think, I think they have to do that. We have to do that because now he's just in jail for a thou for a million years and the victims aren't really made whole. You know, all of that. And, and to Joe's point, there has to be accountability for these parents. 'cause I don't wanna pretend that r Kelly was just preying on these children. Yeah, No, it's some of these parents serve their kids up with like on, on a platter. Yeah, Absolutely. Yeah. That that happens outside of, and it happens. Yes, I've heard stories. I'm not gonna divulge too much, but from people I know that work in school systems and have encountered that shit firsthand. Yeah. It's like, oh Conspiracy. No it's not conspiracy. Well you said you know some, Some parents will. Oh you Said you know some things. What do you know for No, he told you said you not conspiracy theory.


It's not a conspiracy theory. No, no, no, no, no. Not conspiracy theory. You in the conspiracy theory, this is a charge. Exactly. He's making an allegation against You right now. What if you know some things but you not at liberty to say that's a conspiracy Theory. He's saying that he's not gonna tell the person who divulged the information to him. He's just not revealing his sources. That's he said he's not revealing his source. That's solved. He Said you just, it's not a conspiracy. 'cause those people are dealing with law enforcement but they're not helping because there's no like proof or whatever. I'm just joking. You said you was aiding in a bed. It is funny. I'm Not, I would like there to be something I can do but I can't. Oh, word Man. Word man. Yo, she on Your ass. Oh, I can see it. See No, I'm just, no.


You gonna to get it? No, I'm Annie. He Deserves it. It was a legit Question and he deserves it. I'm sick of all that gotcha moment shit. Alright, what else is important or unimportant in here? I'm leaving it to y'all. 'cause if I go on my phone, it's like some deep bullshit in there. I mean It is raining. Yeah, I think it's deep. I see Drake up here trumping people in, in, in Canada. Wait what Politicians, sorry. Okay. Why do I have to know who this guy is? I'm mad that I even know who this pol, I don't know who he is. But why is this news again?

Sent him a dm, called him a goof Yo goof Yo goof. That's such a Canadian thing. Send that Right after midnight.

Private insult. Sorry sir. Public apology. Sorry sir. Sorry sir. Wild. Yeah. Like if Hakeem Jeffries stood up on the Twitter right now and said I apologize to Kenrick Lamar for going to the Drake show. I Apologize for Joe Button for watching somebody else show. Yeah. Like that'd be wild. What the fuck you talking about? Yeah, let me, it'd be a lot. It would be a lot. I mean Drake is one of the most influential artists in Canada, in Canadian history. Hold up for a minute. Alright. Explain it to me like I'm in kindergarten. Yes, I understand the point that you're making. That's fly. Okay. And it does show something.


I just don't get where the power part is. The power is the power. I don't wanna piss Him off. This guy you call, you go, you called him a goofball. Yeah. He apologized so I can insult you. But he did go to the show and if he could do it again, he says maybe I wouldn't have went to the show. Yeah. I don't equate the politician dude and his live concert choices to power. No, the power is Now if they doing other shit back there that re that's not seen then I'm with you. I'm just not chalking this up to Power. Said power. It is the power. He said has the power. Just the fact that he wanted to. Yeah. He felt he needed to clean this up.

But you would think that a politician has better, you know, bigger fish to fry than worrying about his presence at a concert. Insulting fucking Drake. But apparently not bro. We seen what that is what makes the situation so Depress. We've seen instances of shit like this happening since we've been, bro, It is the nigga that said, yo, you got issues at the, at the border. I can make a call get, Get you Boom. Like he got some, he he moved the movement up there. Yo y'all talking about it's true though.

We're a Canadian right here. I know. Making her bread and butter here in New Jersey. Yeah because like, what the fuck are these niggas talking? Somebody made a call. What is y'all talking to? A New Yorker about Toronto Power. I get it. It is, it's powerful Out there. Who does anybody, does any rapper in the United States? I would say Jay-Z. Yes. Does any other rapper in the United States have that kind of power? No. Even the power that we're legend Drake to have? No. Nationally no. But I'm sure locally for sure. Oh yeah, locally for Sure.


Oh hell yeah. Locally. Yes. But nationally, I doubt it. I don't even know if Jay-Z had that power. Na, nationwide. But Now we do. If you telling me that and we could we, y'all triggering me. If you telling me that Drake has power because he denied Duke at the best Tim Hortons that Canada has to offer A a, a cre Coffee. If that's powerful, then ho texting Barack, right?

I'm just saying the rappers like, like, like was said during the beef, you don't have to go to Canada. Like he powerful out there, but you could just cut that whole part off and not have to deal with it. That's all I'm Saying. That's all I'm saying. That's true. But all we was just speaking to was the fact that he is powerful there. That's it.


I get it. Agree. It, it Ain't as powerful. It don't matter Tomorrow. Don't matter to you as much as, as the United States. I get all of that, but still he's powerful there. Got it. You got it.

If You think you can still ask male questions for the rest of This episode. Yes, he can Go ahead. Thank you. Whoa. I brave you lucky the white Flag.


I waved the white flag. I don't want no beef Too lucky. I just wanted know if you made it to the parade. That was all. I did not because after our episode on Friday, well that we recorded on Friday, that aired Saturday, my immigration lawyer called me and said, don't you fucking dare. And she did that as a preemptive 'cause she'd been seeing, you know, people just being detained and arrested and stuff like that. You're applying for naturalization, don't go Right. And I said, I said parade. I meant protest. Protest. Yes. People were protesting. Donald Trump was having a parade Yes. For his birthday, which is bonkers. And people went out there and protested all a bunch of stuff. Well, They were, they're well, they're protesting fascism. That's, I that's I'm saying not just his birthday, but all the things. Yeah. Yeah. So, so You didn't go, so how is Gone? I, I listened to my immigration money.


I, the whole idea, but the whole idea of a protest. Alright, explain this to me. Anti-establishment preschool. Explain it to me like a preschooler. I thought the Idea of a protest was like it said, anti-establishment. I'm standing on this. I'm willing to take any consequences to come my way. Raj just got arrested. She's not willing to take, Well, maybe I'm not willing to take all the consequences, but when, but a couple of these, Listen, listen. Mel is right. Listen, I man though, listen. Oh yeah. Because you don't believe in jail. No, I don't believe in every, every, every protest shouldn't sacrifice everything. You have to be strategic.


Thank you. So there have been, We have to sacrifice Mel though. You know what? It is starting to look like you are motherfucker. Okay. Oh, Wake it up. Fuck. You're, let's wait. Wake it up. No, no, no, no, no, No, no. Now let me talk. Oh, there has been several elections that I have not been able to participate in because I am not naturalized. And I have felt, I have felt a way about that in the upcoming midterms. I would like to cast my vote. I would like for my vote to feel like my vote matters.


I do not wanna sit on the sidelines anymore. And if that means becoming naturalized, that is the step that I'm going to take. Do I wanna fuck up the process before I can even get to the end result? No, I do not. Exactly. That is why I listened to my immigration lawyer, who has my best interest and my money in her motherfucking pockets. But by going to the protest, how, what, what? She's just could gone wrong. She's, she's, I don, I'm ice out there. I don't, I don't see you. So they would've checked for your credentials. I don't see you Standing up there. No. They could've fucking detained me. Ice is not worried About Based off of what though? Based off your nothing Ice. That's what the protest Was about. Ice is not worried about due process. They are fucking detaining people and throwing Why. I got you. But why would they would've grabbed you Like you read up on What you had to go protest about.


Why wouldn't she? She's gonna read It is the after she was Coretta Scott King with all of that fucking, alright. Hey, hey, I remember that shit. You better. Hey, y'all such a fuck up. You better wave the White flag motherfucker. We said, what are you doing this weekend? Wow. Alright. Tomorrow me and my friends are going to take us. Dad, Listen, What they're doing is wrong. And here's the address you pulled out of notes. It's gonna be on Hudson Avenue, 95, 5 Hudson Street. Brian from, From three to eight.

I'm trying to find this motherfucking too short, favorite word. And she ain't even. And you didn't, The rest can't work. The reward. I can't believe you didn't go, man. I told, I don told you why? Listen, if I felt in my immigration that's crazy. Or I felt like I was not going to be detained. There was a possibility of me being detained by ice, which would've completely, I wouldn't be sitting Here right now. Why you wear your, if you, one of your disguises you, you'd be wearing why you wear city?


You water boots picnic with the stupid glasses. Oh man. I just feel like there's more you could have done, but maybe next time. Yeah, maybe during the midterms, when I am naturalized, I can cast votes. The funny shit about this, I agree with that a hundred percent. Thank you, Mark. The funny thing is what? Go, Hey. The first bag of votes to get lost, It is gonna have Mel vote in it. She's doing all this. My vote matters. They hiding the shit out of votes. Alright, Well, I mean, yes there is voter suppression, but you know, and that'll probably be another protest and I would like to participate. Yeah. And we need you that, In that one, shout out to everybody who did go to the protest in, in New York, All 12 million people of Nationwide.


Nationwide. They protested all around the country, protesting Trump's fascism, protesting ice, protesting ev everything you could imagine is going on In this. Wait, him wiping the cons his ass with the constitution, basically. Basically. Pretty much. Yeah. And people stood up and and spoke out. I was glad to See it. And his parade was, It was poorly. It is the worst. That shit was bad. It was terrible. Nobody showed up to it. And having a birthday parade is crazy. But All them niggas uptown talk about some lemme shut up. Niggas uptown. Y'all got some nerve What Voted for him? Yeah. Peoples. Oh, they voted for 'em and now they're like, oh nigga, you Talking about uptown Uptown? Like, Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, the protests look fire.


They Did. You don't think that's crazy for the president to spend 40 million on a birthday Party? No. That's Crazy. I don do that. If they could. Now they're not saying it was so much his birthday. It was a military parade to celebrate the 250 year of the military. It's due To our troops. But That's exactly, but it Was about his Let's let's hear ice out on this one. I just think niggas are very egotistical. And if they were the president, I would throw me, fuck y'all. If I'm the president, I'm gonna throw some fly shit and I'm gonna put all attention. I'm, I'm gonna throw a parade. It's just usually in countries that do that, it'd be like Kim Jong un. It's the king. Yeah. It feels very dict. I'm I I get your point. And I, I don't necessarily disagree in the abstract, but in practice we don't do that.


The only person who ever does that is like Yeah. Dictator. Yeah. So it just looks And the people are already saying, you're a Tator. It looks that way. Yeah, it looks that way. I get it. I get it. And you ran your campaign on financial prosperity and digging the people out of a hole and you just not wasting almost $50 million on celebrating yourself. Exactly. Yeah. That's crazy. While we closing schools and shutting down programs. Yeah. Motherfuckers getting laid off by the thousands Heard they shut down Job Corps people dying. They Did.

He's from as story, what's the name of Mad of, I don't know how To pronounce. Matt. M Right. Ani. Yeah. My dummy. My dummy Snitch It. This, this, no, he he's up there bugging. Listen, while they do whatever they doing, I'm home being not into politics, watching my shows. Then the commercials come on and It is mud slinging.


Homeboy is telling us all the bad stuff. Stuff he snitch that Cuomo did while he was in Cuomo. My man, he's snitching. It's not really snitching if it was public though. Yeah. And Cuomo's a piece of shit. So the combo is great. Well he is. Hold up, slow down Miss. Okay. Why is, why is Cuomo a piece of shit During COVID? He allowed people in nursing homes and prisons to die Allowed. Yeah, yeah. No, with In Action is allowing. Yeah, no, he Thank You for that Mel. Sorry, can you explain to me how he allowed, I wrote about this in my book. I'm trying to remember the details of it. Although y'all should, That line ain't gonna scare me off that You writing A book on it?


No, no, no. I'm telling, I'm saying nigga. I'm saying for the That's his love. I'm saying for the details. I get into the micro details in my book. We still hear, but people Shameless plug. Oh, shameless, Shameless. Shame. I'm a preordering, I'm preorder. It can spell shame, nigga. Oh yeah. But there's a few things. One, there were opportunities to actually provide medical care space and to evacuate. Particularly the nursing homes. He had no action at all with the nursing homes and a lot along alongside many Republicans who basically said they're going to die anyway. So you know, we're gonna focus our attention on these other places inside the prisons.


Not just the prisoners. But even the correctional officers also weren't given masks. They weren't given, what's the other, what's the other stuff? We were trying to, it's so been so long now. Doing what? What do we need? We need a mask, ventilators, toilet tissue. Yeah. All essential needs. Essential. All the essential stuff. He completely neglected that also. Lots of money was That's Not true. What you're saying though, People liked him because he kept everybody, he did a press conference every day about COVID. No, No, no. You remember that? Like every day he was, oh, he had great leadership on COVID. Hold on. Wait, lemme say this. Every day he was keeping the people abreast on the situation, particularly COVID. They were calling While everybody else were hiding from it. And, and not giving any details Him to run. Right. New Yorkers was loving him during COVID.


Exactly. He said he should run for press. I Don, this is my first time here with Marcus. Man. I got locked up in Rikers during COVID. And them niggas had shit in there. You know, how many mobile sites he had to set up with ventilators and All of that shit. We were going through them outside. He was responsible for Jacob Javits turning into what they turned into triage. He was also responsible for finding, because the hospitals were shorted. They had a shortage. Sure. Yeah. So he was responsible for getting more medical work. Like so for every non-action you're saying like he also had an action. Yeah. Didn didn't say he had no action. But these are specifically toward, here's another thing I'm pulling up now. 'cause I had to, within five years, he, he required nursing homes to accept COVID-19 positive patients when the hospitals were overflowing.


So you take people who have COVID and you stick them in a nursing home where people are the most likely to die without, remember this is pro-vaccine, this is pre So now you're basically turning nursing homes in the death camps. Right. So let me ask you, I think You, we live room culture. We live room culture Decision because again, I'm not, but People are saying in the moment, this is gonna kill people. And the argument was, they're going to die anyway. I'm gonna ask you a question. There's Also the 14. I'm not, I'm not saying he's against, I'm not against him. I just think that some people sometimes have A hold up about the Mel is, may I say what you said, Mel? I'm sorry. I said's also like the 14 women that have levied, you know, sexual assault, harass. I was going there next accusations. I just knew that wouldn't be the most persuasive argument in this room. I know, but then that's the craziest part.


Yeah. Wait, that's, that's, that's the footnote. Wait, wait. Don't say that's not, Hey, hold on. Hold up. Hold up, nigga. What? Don't say that. I'm, I'm gonna listen to you a little careful. Guess what, if you would've brought that up, that would've, we would've listened to that. And, and I didn't say you wouldn't listened to it. I said it wouldn't be the most persuasive argument for why it would've. Okay. So you find So I don't think it, Thank you. Exactly. What I'm saying is, if I said don't elect him because he did something, I think you'd find it more persuasive. They killed a bunch of people than he harassed a bunch of people. No, he didn't Kill a Bunch of people. I'm I'm, I'm being, I'm sorry. I'm being a little, And bro, you the mayor of the most densely populated city in the world or one of them. Right. And immediate, this thing jumps on your back. You don't have all of the answers. So we would've criticized them if he said, yo, the hospitals are over flooded.


Let's just niggas with COVID just sit on the street and die. Or put 'em over here. Put 'em over there. Like you, you are, We Create, Oh, I'm sorry. You kind of faced with a task that at the spirit of the moment lose lose them then Yeah. To lose lose. And I've never had to deal with anything like this. There's no handbook for these things. So yeah, maybe he did make some mistakes. And I'm not defending them. I'm just saying maybe he did make some mistakes. But mistakes were be, were damn near inevitable to be made because we never had nothing like this affect The world. I personally had been light on politicians and people in public service in general for COVID responses. Because again, it was a a We Never saw it before. It was New. We didn't see it Before. Well, I, I would disagree with that idea that those are only two choices we could, I mean, there were empty schools, there were empty places, there were lots of places to house people if you were willing to invest in it.


But he not only did it, he then lied about it. He, he hid, he, he under-reported the number of nursing home deaths so that he wouldn't be blamed for it by 83%. Okay, Mark, everybody during COVID under-reported numbers, funeral home was underreported. Everybody, everybody, everybody under number. Literally everything. You think that a funeral home reporting it under underreporting is the same as a governor who's responsible for an outcome? No, of course not. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. He lied about it to the government. They had a whole federal investigation about This. The entire government of the United States under-reported numbers across the board, fauci the C, d, C, all of the motherfuckers reported numbers. Well, are you saying that doesn't make it right though? I'm Not, I'm not saying it did. I'm just saying in a crisis such a, and I'm not defending him.


Right. I I'm not defending him. I also like dude, which I don't want mispronounce his name, but I like him. I he's been around for a while locally. He's been running around story for a long time. He's, I'm saying, I'm just saying like sometimes the judgment, sometimes when people don't have information, knowledge, experience in handling certain shit, we, we kind of get do the best they can. Yeah. But I don't think he was doing the best he could. I think he was, he could have did more. This is what I think he was doing. And you can take it or leave it. And I don't, I don't want us to, And then I'm gonna leave this alone either. Trump was, was handling this in a way that people didn't like Cuomo became the face of the opposition. He was on TV every day saying this is wrong. I'm the real leader. He was positioning himself for president, which again, I ain't had no problem with.


Right. And I think he made himself the face of it. And then when shit started going wrong in his state or his city, he couldn't then take ownership of that because he was gonna lose his credibility. And so he swept his shit under the rug and he's not the only one that did it. They're all pieces of Shit. Let's remove, I wanna remove Cuomo from mine and your conversation. Okay. I have a question for you. Yeah. Do you think that, do you think that you are a bit biased for the guy whose views, I'm not gonna call him radical, like the commercials are but left, whose views are Yeah, well They're calling him A socialist about, do you think that you just have Social That gentleman No, I, i, I said this before Cuomo ran.


I, this isn't about the race. I'm not, I don't actually have a strong opinion about the race because I haven't studied the race closely enough to know. So this isn't like, I'm not saying vote for Momani instead of Cuomo. Got it. I have no, I have no horse in that. In in in or no, no nickel in that quarter. What I'm saying is, is that independent of that, I have a cri criticism and an issue with Andrew Cuomo. I've been, my book came out in 2021 on where I mentioned him before he was even thinking about running for anything. So this has nothing to do with that. If he were running, it doesn't matter if Andrew come. Yeah. That's the other thing I noticed about you when you got criticisms of people a book is coming. No, not at all. Or it's already Here Or It is out. So I mean, I'd be okay with that, but I I, there's nothing wrong with it.


I got a lot of criticisms and I got like eight books. So it, it sometimes it's just that they overlap. Hadn't on Intent. Got it. Got got You. Look, trying to, But, but, but back to just making this a little more lighthearted, the the, the commercials about Duke and how they painting them with the radical. He wants to let the homeless people in the subways. It's like crazy. No, that's spooky. I do think that See, see Fear monkey. See what I mean about you. You terrible. Wait, that's spooky Mark. Nigga, You ain't been on the subway how many years? And I won't be that part and I won't be Ever, ever, ever. That don't negate it. Part of the reason that is 'cause Harry, the homeless is gonna be there. Mark. They killing the shit out people in the subways subway. It happens. Been for years.


Mark Incidents are very low percentage by the way. Exactly. Very low. Wait, what'd you say? The incidences low while they exist and they're horrible. Are extraordinarily low compared to the amount of people that ride the subway on a daily basis. On A daily Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. There was a whole campaign last year about the uprising or the rising in subway crimes where even when they put police in there, we talked about it on here. What were you saying? And They, and, and, And I forgot what, what Were they saying? They did a whole big presentation on the news. Like they was adding 20,000 cops to stop the crime down there. Police what I'm saying? What they pulled them out from home. Those people, the percentages skyrocketed of murder and crime. 'cause maybe they changed when you talk about crime period now.


'cause some of these niggas are just getting stabbed. Yeah. Punched in the face, robbed, mugged, shot. But the subway is dangerous. Y'all can't percentage me out of that. No. The the the And last time you been on the subway, it's true. I'm on subway all the time. It's true. Totally Different Arguments. It's different. New York at least once a twice a month, Some of the people committing crimes on the subways are not homeless people. That's what I'm saying. Got people committing Crimes and just niggas looking for jokes. Yeah. And I got these, You see Joe, you look sweet. You, you gonna, if I saw Joe, if I see You right now, But shit, but you wouldn't see me. That's not a concern. Again, You talk about a lot of people that have, And when they say homeless Ish, 'cause I agree with you, they're using that as synonymous with mental health crisis people or violent criminal violent Cri.


But that's how we do the fear mongering shit. That's how we do the shit with immigration. Where every person that getting picked up by ice ain't a from Venezuela or a motherfucker that committed a crime. Yeah. We also sat up here like to your point earlier and condemned migrants and immigrants for a year and a half, which was stupid. 'cause now we're in a situation where innocent people, citizens of the United States are getting exported because they're not white but even But essentially hold, hold on Selling Fear. But they sell them selling fear. But that doesn't n negate the fact that certain areas of our city were being crime ridden or whatever. Not crime ridden had a lot of crime due to some of the migrants being there. True. It changed. It is changed the landscape of the city. So, and we, I think when we be saying, yo, some of this is happening, people are taking that as Yeah but all, it's not all Cool.


No, but when you sell it, but the other side saying They're selling, they're selling A product. See I don't agree with that part. You selling a Product, you know what we can, I don't even wanna take the train with homeless people. I'm not taking the train. But homeless people don't. If Y'all wanna take the train with homeless people, Cool. They still, I thought they removed all the homeless people out the train station. They're still down there. I mean, I mean they still, you can't get 'em all every single day. You can't stop 'em from going down and you know, homeless looks Different. Especially not if all, all the vacant hotels is filled with the migrants. It, You don't wanna answer that. I know. Good part. Don't worry about it. Listen, it's not my fans.

We happened to have someone there to have a mic in front of AI Kaitlyn. So let's hear what AI Kaitlyn had to say after the game Sanitizers for if it wasn't for me, all these WNBA players would be working in Chili's. Talk about it's half price sanitizers for today only. I had to come back and save this terrible league before their games were moved to Tub B tv. They were two weeks away from playing these games in someone's driveway. Before I got to the league, the players had to sleep in a U-Haul.

Who knows nigga, who knows Nigga. Yo. Rappers be recording shit. Yo Horton, I can share an ae. Yo. You know what I do wanna shout out like some of the MCs real quick. I know I actually today, I don't know who's mc and who not. I don't know fucking lil yada yang and all of the, I don't know who's rapping now, but in this era that these niggas is from, let me tell you how sticky it got Niggas was even particular about meeting rappers.


And if you did, you did so knowing that the beef could happen one day. So you just moved accordingly from the introduction from day One. Yeah. So all of this, you got a video of me, you cried in front of me nigga you was in that session of your knee, back and forth, all of that. That wouldn't have been able to happen. That's the problem though. A lot of these niggas just be too buddy buddy up front. I don't really know you niggas like that. And it's too many cameras nowadays still or not just that they don't even be friends enough to even open up like that bro. It ain't, it ain't about the camera shit. 'cause niggas are still go tell your business even if they didn't have a video. That's true. That's just not your mans. But you running around wanting to be everybody mans.


All niggas back then came from a lot of them. Not all of them, but a lot of them came from some street influence. And so when you met a nigga and you was from the street, you carried it accordingly. Nowadays these niggas be school kids, so you get around a motherfucker and you just on your goofy time and you not knowing that this could come back to bite you in the ass later. And with the year that Kendrick had like parading that body around that he caught all around the world. I knew Push was sitting home thinking of which one of you niggas was going to get it. Push Wasn't just about to come out rapping with his brother over some beats and the fucking wheel of fortune just happened to land on Travis Scott.


Not the Wheel of Fortune. Yeah, that's the shit suspense. Yeah. It just happened to laying on Travis Scott. There's no hard feelings. There's no hard feelings. I would've fired Travis Scott too. It is hard feelings though. Like he, he's addressed it. He's standing up for Pharrell again. I don't, he and it pushes words. Did an interview with gq. It's From that interview from before that we Talked about. And he's, but They didn't put it in there because the record was now basically Right. And he addressed it. He's like, you know Travis came to the, to the, to Paris to Pharrell's studio at Louis Vuitton interrupted a session. 'cause that's where they recorded most of their album at Pharrell. That's why this shit sound like this too. You niggas was recording in Paris. Paris.


Louis Vuitton in Paris Luxury. Nice. So you interrupt the shit you see pushing malice there. You all excited to see everybody there. You I wanna play my album. I wanna play my album. Push goes on to say he's, he's jumping around doing his fucking monkey dance. His words. And it was like we wasn't feeling the music. And you played everything. You played the meltdown record, but did not play Drake's verse. And then it comes out taking the chains. Yeah. Yeah. Now it comes out and Drake is kind of shooting at Pharrell. So you did all of this knowing this like Yeah. You, you looked at a certain way And he referenced him playing the, like that record. Yeah. He said, Travis don't really pick, he just jumped around with whoever hot and do this goofy shit.


So yeah nigga, you gotta catch one on behalf of my mans Pharrell ain't gonna do it. Why did all of that just sound like Pharrell's fault to me? How so? How so? Yeah, for Letting him play it. Travis can't play nothing in no Louis Vuitton fucking Paris studio without Pharrell stopping this session and saying, all right, yo, let him put his CD in. Like let's see what he got going on. I think he said that Pharrell had some, had a beat on that record, which I, We know he did because some of 'em, Travis songs that came out, Pharrell produced. Yeah. So I think that was Like, I know they got a relationship. That was the impetus I'm sure. But all right, so look, you got So Pharrell's being nice man, come over here, play shit.


No, but We got a relationship. We got a relationship. But you let another nigga jump on your shit and dis me. But we got a relationship. Mm. And you don't play me the record. No, but Fuck that. We have a relationship. Is there a world, is there a world where Travis didn't have the Drake verse? That's possible. Yeah. But if me and you got a relationship I call you don't put that shit on your shit. I might call you if I got a real relationship with you Call And he did that. Yo, I might say something if I a real relationship with you, well I'm not gonna let him do it. I'm not letting nobody do that. Well that Y y'all keep at, y'all keep putting real relationships and industry relationships. True. So now I don't believe Travis got to be none of these niggas friends.


All right, cool. Well That's what push is saying. So now push is drawing the line. Don't come around me with that goofy shit nigga. If you knew a nigga's dissing my man and you in here getting beats from my man, you in here playing your shit from my man in Paris and you know you gonna let another nigga jump on your shit and diss him, get the fuck away from me. And you're using us being in the studio together as potentially content to release like you. All The fuck outta here man, With these dudes. Hey bro, I agree with everything that y'all are saying. I'm starting there. So whatever conversation we have is not a debate. It is not an argument. Got it. Push just went through this with Kanye.


He just went through this where Kanye is chummy, chummy, playing nice with niggas, inviting them over, they shooting, yada yada, yada. If I'm Eclipse, I'm saying to Pharrell, if there's one person that I don't want in my session, it's Travis Scott or any Drake friend. Cool. But What if we in this session already a nigga came in, he Yeah, like, like it ain't like this was scheduled. Yo pull up at three o'clock. He might have hit him. Yo, I'm Can I fly through right now? Sorry. Sorry. Now. And I'm not saying that that the clips had that pull 'cause Pharrell is Pharrell, so I'm not saying that. Right, right.


But when you read the GQ shit, you said Travis came in there and said what? It's a lot. It's crowded in here. It is a lot. All y'all here. Like he was excited like, oh shit. Oh y'all here. He like the whole, I don't take, I don't take that like that. I don't take Oh, all y'all here to mean respect. Travis Scott is excited. That's not what that means to me. Mm. So how you take it Yeah, I I know how you take it. It is a lot of people here. It's a lot of people in my session as I'm about to play my album for somebody. It's a lot going on. It's not your session. Yeah. This was, you bombarded my session. We are having, we we have a scheduled session. We recording you not here to record. I'm here to play my album. You came in here and we are doing you a favor. You're not, you aren't doing anything for me. The nigga that I'm being phony to Pharrell Yes.


Invited me here to play my we don't album so we don't know how he invited me here at the first. Yo. It's a lot going on in here. Them niggas would've been kicked. Travis Scott would've had to Travis Scott, his ass the fuck out my session. It depends on is what I'm saying. Because you saying He did say he interrupted the session. Yeah. You saying that like implying that there a lot going on in here with the negative connotation. He might've been, oh damn, everybody in here. He said he was jumping around like a monkey. He says, Oh man, everyone's here. He's smiling, he's laughing, he's jumping around doing his I'm not gonna Say it, it's a lie. I am telling you I don believe that. But he not saying that. Believe in the manner that you saying it, you saying it in Joe button terms. We weren't into the music but he wanted to play, wanted to film us for all listening to it. See listen to me, I'm telling y'all that rappers do shit.


Rappers do this type of machismo, braggadocious comp, competitive. Nobody asked for competition. But if I have to play my songs in your session and it's rappers here, there's something happening. There is something going on in in the air now I gotta get with the rappers. Rappers, yeah. Because rappers out there, y'all know what time It is. Y'all know what time It is. There's an added pressure to playing your music. You are watching the faces and the mannerisms of people, especially if it's people that you respect in there, you speaking, you might be asking for help with a a single or Hey, what should I pick? It's a vibe. Wait stop. Right.


We just cut this hard ass clip shit off in here on the bigs to insert somebody else on the bigs. We talk about ego all the time. Ego and some other shit is in the air in this session. I'm getting that just from a GQ interview. Go ahead. Okay. You are speaking as the rapper that I want to, I want to, you have that competitive nature where I wanna rap the pressure of I I rap, I wanna rap better than y'all, et cetera. Travis don't do that. Yes he does. He does not try to out Rapp nobody. Travis is friends with niggas that do funny shit. That don't mean he do. I'm talking about he did it. As soon as he laugh, he doesn't let me, let me ask you this. Right. You you missing what I'm saying? Yeah.


I'm getting Travis the fuck outta y'all be y'all be friendly with that nigga. If you you want, lemme ask you, he would not be allowed a pinky toe with your asshole. He intentionally didn't pay the Drake part. That's being funny. Yes, Yes. I I'm not gonna absolutely play the Drake part of him dissing you in front of you. And that's the that's the fucked up. That's the funny shit. If You, if I got a relationship with you. Yeah. Okay, got it. I think that Pusha identified Travis Scott as a op prior to that day. Right? Because that's possible because of his, because of his history with Drake for sure. Well yeah, He said, he said that the, the same thing happened on sickle mode where he was dis and yay and that's when he saw Robert. He's like I's a track record of this. Basically he does this push has been through this exact scenario. I'm just shocked. I'm shocked By what? That He let him in the session.


Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't have played, He didn't let him in the session. Pharrell let him in the session. Well Pharrell is closer to Pusha tee than he is to Travis Scott. That would've been one tap on the show to yo, can I talk to you in the, in the lounge? Can I speak to you in the lobby? I mean not the lobby, the fucking the side. Any one of these side rooms Coming, come over Here in the corner nigga get the cigarette. He would have to know how I feel. To me it's the equivalent of what's that streamer shit when little TJ was there and then he had to explain, Hey I'm acting like this. 'cause then he then you got a nigga there. That's cool. Shot with somebody that shot me. It is the exact same scenario in in in music form music. But anyway, what The thoughts records Are.


Records. Records, Crazy Records Are everything I've heard is this album is shaping up to be it Ain Travis got you lucky. 'cause if you did all of that shit after you left, you'd have got a lot more than this eight bars than the end of this record on this hard ass beat. The remix might have been in your honor. So Be It. So big. No now, now a South Chase. You wanna play games? Hey I'm, I get hilarious push kept be cute. Eight bars on the end. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm like, what You see Travis Scott Take can't rap a lick? That would've been, that would've been push taking his child to the playground to the monkey bars in the swing.


You want the icy pow Oh shit. Look, they got the coconut icy man. That would've been a sunny day. Just a little powow just to let you know. I see you. That's it. Right? That's all It is. That's it. Yo, I see you. I know what you are. Stay over there. He would've been a pinata. That's A warning. That's a don't say shit Else. My next gender reveal. The next gender reveal would've been a Travis Scott pinata from the And give come on bat. Let's bat this nigga to hell. The the nerve Travis Scott playing those type of games. So what does Travis Scott do now? Nothing. What? Same thing he kept been doing. That's what I assume. I'm just making sure You know what I mean. Travis Scott is so much bigger than hip hop right now. You don't give a fuck about this. I was gonna say that too. I was gonna say that.


I don't think Travis was looking at them like you said it with like if you in there with niggas that go rap wise. I don't think he looks at himself in a competitive, I don competitive. That's what I was trying to say. He's not, that's not his battle. I don't think he's looking at them niggas even like they a factor in what I'm doing out here. I don't have to compete with them lyrically. I ain't a Spitter. Well I never said that. You did. You said when rap Rappers be in there, you we might need the help with the the pressure and all of that. The Pressure of that had some hot shit. All of that shit without, that's that's y'all fans. That segment. That segment. The rap categories. I wasn't trying to say that Travis should look for some type of reverence from them because of their lyrical capability.


I'm not saying that there is a pressure when a rapper, no matter what you do, if Lil Uzi walks in a slaughterhouse session, fire better be played. Yeah. But the difference, it don't matter that you are what whoever you are and you the number one rapper in the world and in the studio and the studio, we ain't really focused on you being the number one rapper in the world. 'cause a lot of times y'all ain't here without all your cosmetics. You could go do that shit on tour. You in here in some fucking crocs and sweats with crust in your fucking eye and a ugly bum. Your Wednesday night bum bitch, you fucking, You're not rolling. You don't Look the greatest right now. No, that's He, he's not wrong.


'cause in studio, in studio etiquette, studio environment, it don't matter what you, it could be a rock band walking in there. You playing fire or you not. Yeah. You get the court take It from you. I think, I think Travis playing that the fire to him, the pressure to him was Pharrell, not them. Oh no, they're Included. That's where The nah, there you're, that's Where I Disagree being wrong. No disrespect to nobody. Travis might've been looking at them niggas like y'all ain't nobody for me to impress. No disrespect to nobody. But I've spent my entire life and career same in studios. Same. And I the guitar player dude in the back when he comes and plays his shit for whoever mc Yes. Wants to play heat and see how they react. They might not know him from a can of paint. I wanna see how you React to shit.


And the other and the other side of that is, and Dont, they're not nobodies too, but, but Like look and the other side of that is if I'm, I've seen Hold on. Go ahead. If I'm Pusha and I'm already, like you said, I may have already identified you as a op, nothing. You play is fired. Yeah. Nothing you could play is going to press school. I'm not feeling the music because he said I'm not feeling, I Wasn't feeling the music. Not, that's not true either. That's not true. I can, I will sit there and be That's Not true either. I'm not bad dropping your opinions off. But that's, that's not true. That's Not reality of studio life. Y'all like Travis album. I liked it at first. It it grew off of me very quickly. Didn't it didn't last long. Yeah, But it was fire first. It didn't last long. So he Think he playing his fire That that album was good on first listen to trained years.


It was the opposite to me. I didn't like it at first. Then I started to like it and now I completely forgot it. And when I go to Travis, I don't even touch that album. I go back to Birds and Astroworld and The studio. Those fight the studio is where I see niggas like Travis come and steal from niggas like the cliques. That could be true. None. All that superstardom cache shit y'all talking about. I don't know nothing about all that. I'm just talking about I seen the, that he makes, I seen the big time producers come to studio and get their hair cracked from this little nigga from wherever you, from Staten Island up with yo yo studio. Life is different. It is, It Is different. It is, it's not with this internet shit. There's no correlation to internet opinions and what it's actually like being a musician, artist, producer, engineer in the studio.


I put it to you like this. And as you've been in some studios, of course a rapper opening your studio door is going to turn the heads of the Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Facts. Yes. Fuck, Fuck. It is dead quiet there. There's no lights or stimulation. Who's walking In? I have the whole 40 projects in the lounge. Smoking weed. I got all my bitches over and the slightest crack of the door from an unfamiliar fa Okay, if you famous you get shy in the studio And, and, and one other part Joe, because you said you in there without all your cosmetics. I'm coming in here to record. So I got all my cosmetics. I think he walked in there. I think he might have walked in there.


He walked in there with jewelry on. He walked in there looking like Travis Paris. I'm in Paris. Paris. I got a camera. I'm making content. Rell at the Louis Vuitton. Yes. Yes. I came in there Looking like this Travis Scott in his face in them Louis trunks. Man, what is, alright you stupid. Hey, hey, you know what? I ain't been in the studio session in a while. Maybe things have changed. I'm still in the studio session. He's In Have not changed. You was just there yesterday. Some shit. They they changed. They Ain't changed. They're not changed. It's a, It is a, It is a low key competitive environment and it's an environment where you learn I gotta step my shit up or damn he's doing some other shit. I can't come to this. Hey Trey right there. He hey, he, he a rapper and he ain't famous.


If somebody walk in that studio and try to play something, there's gonna be something going on. What Tiffany? You ain't even gotta be nobody. Yeah. Anyway. Ooh, I ain't felt like that in a while. You just start rapping. Go ahead Bush. I I can't get excited about shit like that thinking Travis guy. He wouldn't came. No, no, it wouldn't have Worked that way. That would've never happened. And soon as he left that woulda got by the, I would've fired him for the next, for the next year. And if he had a number one record that would've just helped. Bet He would've fired that, that nigga for sure.


Just for walking in The studio. I don't think just push last time by Me. That's what I was getting at. That's always funny. Pow Go too. Someone Comes in and don't play some heat or do some violating shit like the you said push would've pulled him to the side. It don't even have to be that. Sometimes it just be like, I look all right, I got all still look. Yep. Yeah, for sure. All say less. Y'all rappers, y'all be bringing the mid joints. Y'all fucking to the sessions. Let's talk about it for a second. We gonna talk some more music. Shit. They don't Just bring 'em to the sessions. They bring 'em aside. They bring them when they come up. Oh shit. That nigga Might, that nigga might have had to fire with Him in Paris.


Going to see for real. Maybe I Or Or you would think because you keep dressing it up with Paris and the there's A lot of mid Filming recording. I'm record. We're recording. I gotta remember that part. I'm coming. I control the shit so I can say, nah, it's got her in it. Don't put that one In head. But I'm just saying, I'm coming in here to impress. Nah, I gotta look a certain, I'm coming to impress Pharrell, bro. I put a lot of mid on Travis jacket. Sorry. Could be Sorry. Maybe it's wrong. I'm not, it could be saying I don, I don, I I ain't saying it ain't some work on it. Don't get me wrong, yo. It is submit on it though. It is Submit on there. Listen, it ain't y'all fault rappers. It's the rappers from my Days' fault because we was bringing the bad bitches to the studio and they would sitting there and listening to the same beat for 37 hours and they would realize there ain't nothing going on here.


They just stopped. So by the time y'all was like, yo, come with me to the stew. Nah, the bad bitches was like, nigga, hell no, you crazy. I was in there when Nelly and them was in there. I ain't watching you record different days with that was in there, didn't you? Niggas can't even record writing a booth. Y'all don't put on a show for the bitches in the studio behind the glass. Behind the glass there. Hey, they don't know nothing now. Oh, you can't until late. Ah, anyway. Yeah, man, that's A funny couple. You definitely can't play your album in my studio session. And you got bitches with you. I'm telling you something. I'm telling, I'm telling you something. Whatever man. Whatever.


Funny. Yo, we can move on. What else we got? Music. What else We got Music. It looks like, I don't know if he's heard the criticisms or some, some shit cleared late, but it looks like Wayne is, has been making additions to Carter. Six mm. First they did the remix for band from Nno, which does not include, it includes Nicki Minaj, well features Nicki Minaj. Excuse me. It does not include him. Reciting Norris verse from band, from tv. Thank God. And also there's another record that was added to the album that also that features Future in Lil Baby. That shit sounded all right and that one sound. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That sound it, it sounds pretty good. Yeah, so I don't know if it's, if it's late clearances, it's, the album has been updated twice and it just says bonus.


So it's not a deluxe. I don't know what they're doing, but hey, if he got better music to add, They just gonna start taking shit off. Yeah. Yo listen, distracting shit. Real time adjustments. Yeah, we, we, we, we at the point where you can do it. So Omaha, I'm not mad at it, Omaha, So Yeah, I'm happy to hear that. At least his, his daughter addressed the people. See that's the thing too. I'm sorry. No, Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm, I'm still harping on this. We only looking at this one way because we know the Clipse, we've heard some of these songs, so we know heat was coming out them bigs. What if you wasn't sitting on heat And Then, and you didn't know like Wayne, if who wasn't whoever but like Wayne album came out, he probably thought he was sitting on some heat so he in there on the bigs with that bullshit on them.


And then Travis or somebody coming, Hey Lemme put This off. Excuse me. Not even you, I'm playing this for, for your, for the producer here. No, that's dope. But And It is. This isn't some of the most fire shit you ever heard come blaring out of your bigs. Now you know that your shit is me. You just fucked up the rest of the session. That's a fact. Fucked up the rest of the album nigga. But That's Good. Now I need, I know I Need to writer's Block. No, now I got writer's block back to the drawing board. Yeah, exactly. Maybe That might have saved you Drawing board. I'm in hour 19 of my session and I thought, I just thought came up with the hook. Well thank God. Thank you, Thank you. God let Him in here to show you That, that one Nick, some of you niggas need that.


You Get the hook nigga. That's I'm You right in my head. I wish that every human that enjoyed music was able to just try to record a song one time, be a part of the creation, just one time. Try to record something that somebody in your friend group may like and listen to without you being there. I think that's just a, a practice that should happen. I swear I do. Yeah. I could imagine even The bad songs was tough to come up with. Yeah, Yeah. Anyway, That's a, that's a luxury of just being a consumer and a fan. Like you don't See that side or have to deal with that side. Some Of them bad songs took a week, some of 'em shits took the whole session, put a Whole lot into it and, and then they come out and this niggas is get this shit the fuck outta here you seven.


I heard the real artists, you know they just getting there knocked that Shit out. That shit hurts man. I ain't gonna lie. I'm getting fucking triggered all over. Yeah, We don't, we don't See that side of it. Who else We got? Who else we got what happens? Stupid ESTG. Yes, yes, yes. ESTG dropped an album. I'm gonna get the name correct. Get The name, get the name of this bad boy. I'm gonna give Him his props for this album. STG is props. He That absolutely. It's called My World. He might be back with this one. Is he back? Yeah, he's back. He might be back with this. No, No, no, there's no Mike. He's back. He's back. Est G's back with this one. 14 tracks it. I played a sleeper or a couple weeks ago on the album a couple pos ago I should say. I did not know he was dropping. It popped up.


First thing I saw was the way the songs were listed. This shit is hilarious. This is some real engineer shit producer circulating title. This was like the folder that is sent with I was like, the was like what the fuck did, so I sent the text over to somebody like, yo dog, y'all know y'all uploaded this this way. I was like, yeah, that's fly. Kind of sorta. So when the album first dropped, excuse me, I tweeted out who the fuck uploaded this album. But then I saw a fans saying, I ain't gonna lie, this shit kind of fly though. It take me back to the lime wire days. It take me back to the mix tape. It looked like I ripped it off of a and I'm like yeah, kind of. Yeah. Oh shit. It is working on people. I ain't care about that. I wanted to hear the album.


He's back him forever rolling. He got with the right producers. He's not doing the sing songy shit that he tried to. You could, you could see when somebody tries to advance their sound or try to get out of the box that they were put in, he went back into the box that works. Yeah. And I, I, I said it, this album is made for all of us who hated the last projects. This is solely for us. The rest of y'all, y'all ain't gotta like it. They shoot get they shoot they shoot, they they shoot. You can tell by This is down.


I love this one. I Got a whole bunch of, I didn't get to the second half. I just gave it a quick run through Boss of all Bosses Hustle music. Like, like it, it's, it's shit on here. If you are A-E-S-T-G fan, you will be pleased with this album. That's fine. The older you get, you get outta Reed right. Where the fuck is Boston? Boston? See I had to, I had to figure The titles ain't titles. All The niggas spell it different. No, It's Rough. Three 19. Yeah it looks crazy. And I think that shit is super dope and creative. But I've had that issue with underground rappers in general.


Like part of the reason why people don't know your songs and they'll say someone fill in the blank Artist. Yeah but name a song it's 'cause you called the song Purple Shoe Laces and the chorus is we all peoples or so you know it's like a super catchy chorus. The title is right there. Yeah. But you call this some super abstract shit now. I don't even know how to find the song. It don't even be abstract. What a lot of them do is when they get the beat from, because the producer will title The beat. Yeah. Producers use crazy As they'll send that over there and then they just keep that as the title and made their own song to It. Or they just find one little punchline that was funny in verse two and make that the song title. It's like that's not good for branding. But yeah. Anyway, shout shouts to EST. He got, like I said, he has a tour coming up too.


We back. Okay we back. You going to to, oh For sure You bring your girl. No That's not her. She ain't an ESC fan. Yeah, I didn't think so. Didn didn't think you was Nah. Some concerts for the ladies. Yeah, That's a fact. That's a, that's a fact. That's A fact. There's some you can stay home baby. I got Yeah, yeah You are not stay home Home. You're not gonna have to the most fun here Have to get in my Parks bag. But I am really excited about the new Ghost face project. Oh yeah, me too. Me too. Even though I don't like when niggas take the classic and Yeah, I had, I hate that But I don't think the ghost face is gonna Fuck that up. It's Just too much pressure though. The Shit you put out last year was fire. So Yeah, I, I would look forward to this. It was, yeah, Don't number two or number three leave the classic.


The classic like it just add, it just adds pressure unnecessarily. It's Especially where when it's like 20 years later and you're working with a whole different set of people like it, you're setting yourself up in a, because You can't recreate. Yeah. It's not gonna sound nothing like that. You don't sound the same. Your producers are all moved on to different shit. It, It is a dangerous game but I'm always looking forward To like, not to jump back, but that's part of the problem with Wayne. Outside of the music being what It is, You should stop calling these Carters. Yeah, Yeah. Calling these Carters adds pressure to it. Yeah, it's a bar you gotta meet. If this was, I am not a human being three, it ain't going to be judged as bad. He did 110 first week with zero promo outside of me announcing it And like bad promo after the first day.


Yeah. Right. Did y'all see, oh I think that this new two chains in Neo is kind of hard too. This shit is definitely hard. It keeps saying from the short film Red Clay. I'm not familiar.

Yeah because there's too many hosts Demo to the bottom joint. Yeah, yeah, yeah. End of the second block. You're in the league. You Leader. I didn. I don't go that far down. Well you don't have to when you pay him every week in playback. I don't pay nobody. It's cool. I paid him two the other day. Gotta start even this thing up man. I can't keep losing on the money tip. You know what I mean? I gave him a little $99. Now This $99. They told me you gave a hundred And you gave 99. Yes. Y'all paying it. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait. Oh Yeah. Wait, wait. Stop. Yeah we buying it.

He made a billion a month. Yeah. And power Came with that. I don't make that. He made a billion a month. You don't Make what nigga? I wouldn't even wanna make a billion. You don't Make what nigga? I wouldn't A month. You, I'm answering you but I'm telling you about me. I would not want to make a billion dollars a month is what I, I wouldn't Want you to make a month. You ignore a flip. I share some of your views in that. Like too much. Too much is too much. Right. There's a such thing As too much. Okay. No, you were expressing some shit that I like live by. I just would've never said it on here but okay. Okay. I think at a certain dollar amount there's no such thing as your choice.


And yeah, I just, I'm cool with where my life is up to a certain point. Actually Will Smith was just talking about this a few months ago. Opposite of rock bottom is mountaintop or clifftop. Mm. Okay. And once you get to a certain dollar amount, all you're asking for is misery from that point on. He explained it way more eloquently. He said it than I would be able to say it. But I subscribe to that. That's dope. Oh yeah. I mean shit, you can even see it. Not to go back to politics 'cause we covered that enough, but you seen all the billionaires going into this last election. Like I don't know if all of them felt that way, but they had to for the sake of their billions of dollars. Yeah. If you, if you could make a billion dollars a month, would you?


Yeah. Okay. I think that it wasn't A trick question. I'm No, No, no, no. I'm saying yeah. The way Will Smith basically conveyed it was he was also saying like, yo, when you bought everything right, when It is nothing that money can do for you. When you get to a place where yes, money can't do nothing for you, now your internal shit starts to manifest and you start to really see like, am I happy? Am I fulfilled all this other, because most poor people, we think money is gonna be our fulfillment, but it's got time. But when you get to point, you got time to sit and self-reflect You. And this we anyway. Did you, did you ever Read his book mean you can get everything you want? No. You'd Love it. You would like It. You said we What? No, you were saying we bore people.


So I was just this a little ha Right. With 5,000 shoes on. Yeah. Word. Now he bore. I know you got it from my, your man that was in the car. I rode by your house the other day, Mr. Ish. I rode by your, I got the choose. You asked for The choose. I rolled by your house up today. You didn't rope by my house? Yes I did. It's all right though. You better shut up. Did did I not, It is exactly what I told you it was Right. What? That it's not a huge house. It's S not a, I've lived in that neighborhood before you but You, I know exactly Where you live. Yeah, that's What I, I wasn't exaggerated. That's what I said. I told, I told Alright. Yeah All it's a McMansion Isn't it? It is not a McMansion. Yo Shut up. But you shouldn't be looking at his house. You said you was cool with living in section eight.


He said he wasn't who said He was cool with living in section eight? They said that when nigga Yo Friday you weren't him. And Y'all said that Cool with living in Section eight too. Yes. This whole cast set except for me and Mark. And somehow we were made out to be elitist because of that. Right. Nobody Wait, so are y'all saying that because the rent would be cheaper. They'll Put a spin. You know they'll Put a spin. But that's why you're saying it. Yes. Okay. And in certain, depending on which market you're in, there is some luxury digs that you can get. Yeah. Not the level that we would want. Yeah. You special y you special. Well you take the food stamps that come with that. What? Yeah. Got your moment. We we Did, we did. We did the food stamp thing too. You talked about that too was like, nah wait, unless I get 'em in the barbershop. Well I'll take, I'll take food stamps today nigga.


But that's right. I said the same thing. I said if I can get 'em on the load like in in the barber shop today. I take stamps today. I'm not, I'm signing up for it. My, Because we want, We want more than that. I feel like a section eight. Lemme say lemme could live where he lives right now on section eight. Now what you gonna say? I've Never been to Flip's house. I have, it's not To say he could live where he lives right now. On section eight Trying to play my house nigga flip's. That's Nice. Shit. No flips house. Flips house is nice. Do you think he wants to die in that house or do you think he wants more? Here You go moving. Well lemme Say that. Lemme say what's the one thing I do at the Other look Ish. Look at me. Section Eight buys you houses Joe. You ain't know that either, did you? I feel like so wait, wait, wait. You could pull out all of your corn, beef hash Facts. I know. I don't want to live.


You pulled out your cornbread bullshit about you want to die in the house. What the Fuck that gotta do with him living in the house That's on section eight if he wanted to. I feel like Section eight makes you too comfortable. If you, if you, if you live in section eight. I feel like mad shit That sounds so racist. My team. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not being racist. It's not a color thing. It's Not a color thing. You, No that's not what I'm race. If I Section Eight makes you too comfortable. If I look in section eight I'll be too comfortable. I wouldn't want like I'll be too comfortable. I, I'd probably buy a lot of other shit. I'll probably me, I'm talking about me personally nigga I wouldn't even pay attention to wanting to upgrade me. How did you get to Travis's? He stole it. Did You like did you say One of his s gave got him that drink?


He went to the spot man They moved your name up the list. No they took you off the wait List. They got the stores you could go in that sell the shit that you just can't. How did you have one of your workers waiting in line at the Foot Locker? They moved just Oh yeah I met them nigga I met, I met the line waiters. The niggas that wait in line you gotta pay 'em the wait in line for you. That's what I'm saying. You probably did you send one of your guys? I met them at the Diddy trial. You ain't Gotta pay. You met at did trial. No I'm serious. This niggas you paid the state just waiting. You remember the niggas you met at? Yeah because they was arguing with the lady. I swear with them. Yeah they'll fire. I like how much I can pay to wait in line. Yeah You can actually pay people to wait in line. How much would would you get paid to wait and And here's the thing. It would be cheaper to pay somebody to wait in line than to try to pay somebody off who was waiting in line 'cause that's what they wanted to fucking go in.


Know what I'm saying? And it's a good hustle yo. Like for example if you send somebody to buy the tickets at at face price with sneakers at Face price, you could, you could pay somebody, you know $300 to wait in line to buy 200 sneakers that you could in sell for $5,000. You know what I'm saying? It is not a bad hustle. I know a lot of people that do It. Is That what you did Ish? I told you you. He's not Yo listen I'm tired. I'm tired of this shit. Mad old lemme you act but you still have to stop playing. Alright. Alright. Let's say they old how you got 'em and would you wear 'em if you had your section eight crib And stop being too fucking modest nigga? Yes I would. That's the problem with you. So That's The problem with you. I don't feel like that's How'd get up though bro.


I don't like it with you today. You full of shit. But Friday There baby, you answered everything about how you got 'em. I bought 'em nigga what You think you bought direct? Yeah. You went in the store and just bought 'em 2,500 nigga don't want? Or did you go to Flight Club, something like that? Yeah, flight Club we sell. Okay. One of them shit. One Of 'em drink. Oh so big money, okay. Yeah, big. I Got you. They wasn't four. And how you know his house was mine? Mark? That's my Hood. No. Moved to my hood. Hood. What they gotta do though? I don Dunno your exact exact house I rode by your, Oh you rode through my neighborhood? No, through my neighborhood. Your house just happens to be in it. Oh shit. I rode, I rode down your Block. How you know which his house one is that I don't know which one is his house It up. So all that time when I said so wasn't I right about what my house looked like And you was playing it off as if like That's what the section eight niggas Be doing though.


Yo. That shit when they ride to Hood, my gonna get one of those. You you seen CNN right? No dude that be on there. That's my man. That's my man. I'm gonna go home and Look that on the Illa. Oh man. Yo Flip perfectly brought us to this Diddy case. I don't know if you guys heard one of the jurors have been removed. 41-year-old black male for inconsistencies with his address where he lived apparently one time he said he lived in Brooklyn other time he said he lived in Staten Island. So Judge kicked him alternate juror and 54-year-old white male.


Who, How Many black jurors are on the That? I don't know. Three Now. Right? Oh, four was four right? Wasn't it? I I can't say for fact That's That's black jurors or just black men? Black jurors. Black jurors. My understanding is there're four. I could be wrong. I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but I've been told four. I know there's four men, eight women. I don't know the You seeing slaves on gone. What fam you kick somebody off the jury 'cause they had inconsistencies in their address. Yeah. What does that have to do with, How does that even keep coming up? Y'all get your address in the beginning you it because It might be trying to diversify the jury pool from different parts of this. I understand. And so if you said you're from here, we wouldn't have picked you if you were from there.


Ah, it might be one of those things. It is probably. I still think it's a technicality to get rid of certain. Yeah, but you ask Me again after the trial starts Or they might somebody reported Person out That seems more likely This person, yo yo, you know Rakim number 12. I'm Snitching on them niggas. Right. Yo. Number 12 he bullshitting, Right? He live right here. He here With me? Yeah. What talking about he be here with me. That's crazy. And replace them with a white male 54 years old. I Mean look, They probably from fucking, could be from anywhere Elmira. Hey, hey, hey everybody hate you far. And they played, this was the first time that they actually played some video footage from the freak offs.


They played about 12 to 13 seconds. What did Freaky ass Courtroom audio was on it? No audio. Well they had heard audio clips before. I don't know if audio was on this video. Well it must have been because it's being reported that a few of the jurors had reactions to what they were seeing. That's Gross. I was in the, I take that to mean that they maybe heard something too. Apparently one, one lady laughed. One lady turned away her face and discussed. I wanted to come here a few weeks ago and talk when they said when the judge checked Puff for looking at a locking eyes with one of the jurors nodding his Head, you can't do that.


Yeah, but we gonna do That. And that's the same drawer that got removed. That's one that got No, no, no, no, no. I don't know about that. No, I mean that's what's Was reported saying that's what was Reported. Is that what's being reported? That what's being reported? I don't know if it's confirmed but that's what's been reported. Oh that the person he locked eyes with was the person who, who was removed. I don't know that again, I'm not saying that as a fact, but that's what's been reported. I don't know for sure Me and you over here bonding. Yo, you hear this bullshit my nigga? Yeah, he was shaking like this Got a big money scheme And you ain't even, you ain't even With it. Yo, they getting him outta here. That Crazy. I mean I thought that they was doing that before the juror got removed. But this is just like cementing it. Yeah. Oh you can't look at the juror and smile. I mean he can't Why You can't What you talking about please?


Because he's already been accused of got Tampering, witness Tampering. John got looked at 19 jurors. Okay. But Puff specifically has been accused of witness tampering, manipulating people. Has Puff been accused? John Gotti did that and pulled up the witnesses houses afterwards and followed. He been Torture. That's why he didn't get bail. They said that he could potentially tamper with witnesses and Threaten them intimidating. Exactly. So it Has not been accused of that though. It's two different things. If you think that I could do some shit or if I did, It is different. Well the, well, I mean isn't that an accusation In order to keep him in jail, bail denied because we believe this is what you do Or can do or can Do or can't Could. Okay, so we're being semantic by calling it like, you know, an accusation.


Well That's, yeah. We're not saying you did it. It means two different, We could do it. Okay. But same shit. It is the same shit though. What guys? About the juror being removed. We always get I It Is bullshit. I think it bullshit. I agree. One quick thing though, I just wanna add is you are allowed to look at the jury. You could look at whoever the fuck, look at what you, You don't have to be docile in court like this Meek looking at the ground. Absolutely. You, you could look over there at the people. Not only, not only are you allowed to look at the jury, but they often encourage you. Encourage you so that you could show Up Of remorse, et cetera, et Cetera. But I'm talking about during the selection process for idea, they encourage you to look during the trial. You're allowed to look. But what they they say is don't stare. Yes. Because if you stare, But what if I found one of them that agrees with what I'm, what's what I'm thinking?


There's no Rule against it. Then I gotta stare At him. Yeah. I saw a homeboy make a face when somebody said some bullshit. Me and him. Yeah. You Know what I mean? Yeah. But I think that that's also, They See that, I think that's why they start checking his address. If if that's the same person Yeah. Start looking for something. Look For how to get him outta here. Can't for a reason to Expel him. And they're also, they're probably also afraid that like the eye connection is a very nuanced nonverbal sense of communication. Right. Right. Two black dudes kind of like looking at it. Exactly. Exactly. It's like when two girl Exactly. They're saying that that's A whole conversation. Right. They're saying, dude by the way said that he lived in the Bronx but he lives in New Jersey and because it's a Manhattan, You live outta state then you gotta get the fuck.


And he and and he did tell another juror or someone overheard it him tell you man, I gotta hit home man. That traffic in the tunnel. Bullshit. Where do you live? Oh I live in Jersey. Oh No. He told a, a court staff member. That's so, Oh that's even worse. Allegedly. Oh yeah. Allegedly. According, you're According to the news. You're done buddy. Pack it up. Yeah, You wink that puff. We gonna get you a dumb as gotta get outta here. We'll make up a reason why you getting the fuck from outta here. But it's cool. But you off this trial. Final thoughts on this from you guys? I, I think that his, his fucking goose is cooked. I thought. Yeah, I thought his muffin was cracked long before the juror thing. I think It is over. Have you Been keeping up Casually?


I've been living my life like it's golden. Nigga living in Atlanta. Y'all niggas want to be out there breaking the law. I ain't cracking my neck to pick up the New York post to see what the fuck the trial is. I'm sorry. I'm phony. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Alright. After the first maybe two, three days I'll stop watching. Yeah. Now people tell I'll know If you get free my phone gonna stop busing. You gonna call you As long as your car's not busting. Don't get the shit off. Yeah, I don't, I don't think that he would.

The problem is Miami first of all, this had been the lead single and he had done this first and didn't do them terrible freestyles and all that other shit. He might have been on a different trajectory. We would just say he made a corny mid album. Right. But he has with all due respect has kind of embarrassed. This feels like midlife crisis now. So by the time this comes out, what would be a song that might be a five on a one to 10? You know what I mean? It is gonna feel like another corny mood like it's too late.


You know what I mean? Even for a mid song A I key. I don the inter I don what you talking about that should the right girl gets this shit that's influential on the gram and has that shit on dancing to it. Everybody else gonna follow suit. This is not horrible. The I don, I don Pantheon Of Will. That's what I'm saying. It's his relative. Y'all are talking over each other. I wanna hear Y'all. I said It is not that bad in the pantheon of Will Smith records. Like True. I remember why Wild West and all that shit. This fits right in that playlist And if will pull the boat up over there in the south of France or over there where they be at playing this type of shit. Okay. Them Pretty Girls going on the boat with oh this Works in Europe. That what I said it works in Europe. It's All Can everybody just Hold on real quick Before you say No no, no because I shut up all the time.


Lemme say something. When Drake did that honestly nevermind album that y'all, a lot of people tried to sit here and Love it. It was big 'cause it's made for international and go over there and go over there. This is that type of shit that this type of record. Alright. Yo. Yeah please. All a yo yo mute all these mics please. Hey dog, that's what we doing. Please Mute every other mic but mine Please say less. Got it. Please Mute every single mic. Got it. I can't anymore. I don't know. Payroll you niggas is on. This is not what y'all are describing And this broadcast has too much esteem in the music world for me to let y'all keep telling people that if the right girl get they hands on this, It is gonna fly.


I let y'all get y'all bullshit. Snoop takes off this. Y'all have to stop. I don't know what will Smith album you working on? I'm Not working on Will Smith The days of Wild Wild West. 'cause that worked too. All 'em shit that you named work those days are not here. Will Smith is how old 50 The stimulus plan that you name It is not working today for 50. However year old Will Smith. I don't think this is a bad song but we can't pump this up like this is about to do something. I don't Never, that's Not what I saying and that's not what I said either For y'all. I did not say about That. I did not See that. I am not Never said It is doing Nothing.


All I said was this record would work for him over there. I said it's not for here. I don't agree with the TikTok Instagram, none of that stuff that it said I said would over there overseas. This is an international sounding record. I I Oh no I was down with you until you started, until you made the Drake reference. Drake is the biggest rapper in the world. I'm just talking about the sound. The sound. When honestly nevermind came out. I came in here and hated that and y'all said no it's not for here. Luxury sound go overseas. They playing it overseas. I'm telling you that type of sound with Will Smith, who he is in his star quality overseas. This would work for him. Nigga they playing that song in can right now.


That's what I'm saying. I don't think So. I don't think it's gonna work but it's not the horrible, when it first came out it sounded horrible to me. But again, will Smith, There's somebody online saying that if you pitch it down. I saw they sounded bad. It sounded bad. I thought it sounded bad both times. Yeah. So that little tweet didn't get me. Yeah but there was another tweet that said if you pitch Anita Baker down, she sounds like Michael McDonald. I saw that. Yeah. That one hasn't, hasn't left my head Other way around. You pitch it up and Michael McDonald sounds like Anita Baker. I didn't See that one. You just said the same. No, you Don. I said if you pitch Anita Baker down, but The but The, and she said if you pitched Mike McDonald up The recording is different of Michael Michael McDonald being pitched up. He sounds like Anita Baker.


That's what it was. I Don't think she said that but let's do it. Yeah, It was a video that was circulating. What'd you say? I Said we a music part. Let's Do it. We are not a music part. The song was, I keep forgetting. Oh Okay. Definitely Michael McDonald Smart And you gotta pitch this down. Okay then you saw a different video than me. I can assure you the one I saw was Anita Baker. Okay, well let's try I Didn, I saw the Anita Baker one too Joe. I didn't see this one. This Anita Baker. What is the difference? Anita Baker. I Saw the Anita. I saw the Anita Baker one that he's talking about. Sounds like both things happened. This isn't isn't really a who done it I guess by 'cause they're both the same thing.


That's crazy. That's kind of nuts. Yeah, it's a, It is Anita to bigger pitch down. I found it. You. Let's go, let's go. Oh shit Yo.


Alright so follow Michael McDonald's song. Now you gotta do it. We gotta do what she said because she ain't gonna let it go. Because you believe them. I told them there was a fucking video. They didn't listen. It has nothing to do with whether you believe me or not. There is a video circulating where it's playing Michael McDonald, I believe you wanna hear it And they pitch it. We got you. And it sounds like her. We got your tennis. Well the problem with pitching this up is the tempo is about to go And the tempo went down And was down the street. Freeze.


Let's go man. Y'all, the internet was a mistake. The internet discovering slowing records up. I'm mad that I ever read that because That blew my mind. That's Gonna bother me Every time you hear it now that one sounded nuts. Yeah, Mel's one was definitely better. Yeah. Yeah. You ready Fox? Oh yeah, we're recording.

No, I didn't use the past, the ball ball when we did it. I said trying to speak on the topic. Here It is. Like trying to win the lottery. That's That's what I stated. Yeah, that's what I said. Why do you think that is? There's a lot of, you know, a lot of voices, a lot of passion when it comes know a lot of us are passionate. Somebody gotta go. I don't think so. I just think that, you know, you as the boss, you gotta pick our spots because we spoke on the phone about, you know, I think that you more than well enough, you know, that shit did leave that shit. Did y'all spoke on the phone about this? That shit did delete. Wait a minute about y'all spoke on the phone? About, about somebody?

You know, that's, that's all it was. So you didn't call complain too, too much talking? No, no, no, no, no complain. Just, you know, he just had a real nigga conversation with his boy and that's it. Gotcha, gotcha. So I was able to see you yesterday, but right now What? That was the end of your story. Yeah, I don't think that, 'cause when I get into too much details, they don't like breaking the fifth wall. Right. Since y'all like to cater to The audience, we're not breaking the fifth wall. Yeah. Alright. I had No, No, no, no. Don't do that. Don't, don't brush me off. Tell me to correct it. That's what you do a lot. That shows that. I'm not capable of explaining. Listen, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't explain it. But you might go past the line.

This please go ahead. No, no, no jokes. But I had, I wanted to have a conversation about just my performance, how I could get better, where things went wrong. And he was just honest with me about my performance, where things went wrong, how the ball was handed to me and how things had to shift because I wanted, I didn't wanna play ball. And I, you know, he was just a real nigga. Shit. He brought up facts. I didn't think he had the facts, but a lot of things he watched, yo, this is what you did. He was correct. You did this at this time. He had his dates correct. I think the nigga pulled it out his phone. 'cause his memory usually bad. And I had to go to my notes because I try to record him a lot and get notes on him to use it.


You talk with him? I, I, I don't, It is like, he caught me at a great time Saturday morning whenever I, it wasn't, I don't have these types of talks. He doesn't, with him, he doesn't. It was a real in-depth conversation about performance review and how you can improve and somehow that got to how you can make more, earn more. Yeah. That's And then somehow that got to me asking him on some real, I said real talk. Real talk off the record. Dope. You gonna Bring me up If you do that? I'm not gonna do that if you do. I said real talk what you made last month. Like honestly he was hesitant but after a second he told me but shot right Back Or what you made this month.

Nigga said so far he made 85 million Because they show, I mean the, the other day. DDG just DDG showed he made 12 million at that last month. Well that's what I was gonna ask y'all. 'cause I don't know this world, like how, how ac how accurate one. I know people just lie, but how trackable is this stuff? You know, like how do y'all trust these numbers? Yeah, I do. Okay. I do. I mean I watch, you know, I Trust 'em somewhat with the names that they're attached to on this list.


Okay. I do. I mean when you see Twitch, like Twitch breaks it down, you have to stream a lot and stream for a certain amount of hours. But Twitch also puts a lot of ads in it. There's some funny shit that I've learned and there's a lot of ads about like 30 ads within the video. So I don't know how that helps. But Can I ask your question that's share? Sure. Why don't you do that? I just feel like you got the No, I'm not being funny. Like I feel like you got the wife Twitch. Yeah, like that long term. 'cause you have a audience. You, you like to travel like all the shit I watch all 'em guys do, like I feel like you could do it and they all look Up to you and the room is basically like a kind of one off street. That's what I'm saying. Like it feels like you could do this and McMill I'm not being, there's no joke here. No. Okay. So to be honest, this is something with Twitch before, a lot of times when I get in a situation I just be transparent.


I try to find a, a loophole just like it was with Caffeine podcast. I try to, you know, I do a certain amount of hours and then I try to do the double the hours and then so I always try to find a loophole. Gotcha. Which, which I mean we are in talks. Shout out to, you know I'm in talks now. Oh I don't want mess nothing. But I had took a break and I don't wanna just leave it that way. Okay. Yeah. I don't wanna mess nothing up. I was genuinely, it just seemed like right up your alley. I'm a loophole type gall guy. Galley. Gotcha. That's it. Shoot. We announce that if you're in talks, Well Anything to announce? No. Okay. Look at you. Yeah, you gonna be you. If it's one person that don't want you to succeed, It's just the opposite. Oh, didn didn't even say that. I didn't even, even when he's ready even to announce, don't announce premature shit.

20 million. Oh, he was getting robbed. These Numbers are through the roof. He was getting robbed. Some of these people getting robbed. That's the funny shit. Some of these numbers can't Tell them that. Robbed by who? By who? You can't tell them that You're not my place. No, That's based on your by you deck decade. But that's your decade of this business. You understand what I'm saying? That's how you Yeah. Nevermind. That's not important. But yeah, again, shout out to all those people. That's, that's awesome. Super awesome. What, what else? What else do we have? What else do we have? Yo, Stephen A Yes, Stephen A Desmond.


Bain. Let's start with Stephen. A Stephen A was playing, what was he playing? So hair solitaire at the finals. The camera called him. He's been getting dragged ever since. And I don't know where I stand on this. This is what I say. You're supposed to be a professional. You're paid to watch the game. You're paid handsomely to watch the game. You should watch the game. However, Anybody who's ever worked in media knows that there's moments where you are, you are completely locked in and there's moments where you're not, if people wanna criticize him for playing solitaire, fine, whatever. But I don't want people to believe that he's doing something that's so far out of the realm of normal that we start to think that he's somehow a bad broadcaster.


Everybody is a good bro at, I don't know any broadcaster who doesn't do that. I know people, we are watching breaking news on elections. We're watching breaking news on a bombing, a school, shooting, whatever. People be on Instagram, TikTok, all those things I'm talking about at cnn, at Fox, at MS nbc playing, texting people, whatever, not paying attention to the breaking development 'cause and also finally there's a way, it's like when you have kids and you can, you know how you can watch your kids and do something else at the exact same time, If Stephen A Smith has been covering basketball for 40 years, You know what I mean? And he's been a temple Sixers, NB, all that. I guarantee you he can go FF with them cards and watch and watch a basketball game at the same time.


It's like when your girl talking to you and Hey, I'm joking, I'm joking. There's only one problem with that. That would leave people to guesstimate or assume whether or not Stephen A can play solitaire and watch the game at the same time. Right. It's a bad look. But What if this should be absolutely zero reason for people to have to assume this one. Two, this is the worst possible time to be caught playing solitaire. There's already a lot of talk. No, it's not. It Is. No. The worst will be the week before you signed that a hundred million dollar contract facts. Yeah. Week after You're good. The second worst time.


And that was, and that was my third point. But now a lot of the criticism that the finals that the finals or the NBA is receiving, people are waking up. That's good. People are waking up and saying, yo, it's not just the product and how they roll that out. It's also with their licensed brand partners and how those people speak about the game. A lot of people are seeing that these people don't even watch the games. Like you got independent commentators now on Instagram and YouTube that are, that are coming up and making a rise because people feel like Shaq Barkley, Stephen A and a bunch of 'em just don't watch the games. And you can hear that in their commentary. So to see somebody playing solitaire during the NBA finals, a small market NBA finals, we need all hands on deck.


We need everybody to at least look like you paying attention. Now I agree with your media point too because It is mad. Hurry up and wait. It is mad dead in dry spots where you should be doing something on your phone. That's not accounting for secondary media, which is just niggas with phones. Yeah. That's just fans that are gonna record you and put some shit out. Yeah. If the podcasters and rappers and entertainers gotta deal with it, he gotta deal with it Also, lastly, to your point, you just signed a contract for one over $100 million is being reported. You just signed another serious contract for X amount of dollars, pays you $25 million annually.


The suits are looking a lot cleaner. No solitaire. It's not a huge ask or it's not a huge ask Or privacy screen. That too, if you gotta place. So that's the old man shit right there. You know what I'm saying? If you gotta do it And then get privacy and then the double down in it I thought was a little ill too. 'cause he underestimates the internet. It's just like my, it's just like disconnect jug meet, sing. Right? Like, oh, I, I didn't enjoy Kendrick. Then you find he, he dancing at the wrong part. He said it was a timeout. Good example. And then the Fans know what I know. They, they zoomed back and was like, yeah, no, there was a play going on and you could see it. And I mean he had to say something. Actually, he didn't have to say anything.


What he should have just said was, I was, I apologize for it. You know what I mean? I was fully locked into the game. But I I, I apologize for appearing Unprofessional the day before that or the day after that. Him and Jay will got into it because he got on there and said, well the topic was on first take. If Greek freak doesn't win another championship, he's an underachiever. And Jay will was highly offended. That was crazy. He should have been. And he kind of spoke to what some of the bad shock takes are doing to the, the game and how people view it. So, I mean, it's just a incidents in a row where it's like not the time when we're on our biggest stage, they just brought back player introductions.


You see them trying to fucking self-imposed trophies on the, like they trying in real time. We don't need our biggest and most recognizable commentator playing songs. How does that make you terrible? How does that make you feel when you point something out like that out and then they changing in real time? Well, I'm not taking credit for that. I think a lot of people did that a lot. A lot of people said, Well I didn't hear, I don't watch sports. I heard you say it, but I didn't know a lot of people saying That. I said it and I think that a lot of 'em, niggas listening to me. But a lot of people said that the way that you're presenting this, damn It is fucked up now. You know what, I know what I took. They picked the wrong commentators for the game. Like I think they picked It.


Is Mike Bre, is it Doris Burris? Doris and Richard Jefferson. Hmm. They don't do it. But who do, who's the right one? I love Doris Bur. Huh? I was gonna ask you who you who you would pick. I like Doris Burke. You gotta have some comedy, you gotta have some personality. You gotta have a little bit of charisma. Like remember Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, Van Gundy, they bring comedy. They crack on each other at the games. They do like a lot of these games haven't been the most competitive throughout some of the portions. Like Indiana's up 20, OKCs up 20. During that time people are getting lulled to sleep that are watching the game. Motherfuckers be cutting it off only to find out the other team won the next day.


Right. You need dialogue. You need commentary to engage the watchers and the listeners and they're not getting it done. And you need to not play solitaire when cameras are around. When is Michael Jordan gonna start the commentary? But You right though there's no hand down man down. Yeah. Like Mike Green ain't even giving him a bang. Bang. Yeah. Shit. It is nothing. Yeah. That shit is not, it ain't that like the shit is I'm watching 'cause I'm a basketball fan, but these niggas are not keeping me intrigued. Have they done any stats on like watch time or not? Well, not watch time. Like in terms of like Yeah. Percentage of And stats. It's, it's Super Adam. So we're just talking about, honestly, I think It Is the lowest we've seen least watched Finals in Yeah. In decades. I mean it's, it's, it's bad.


And I mean I agreed that the announcing what help, but ultimately if the players aren't there, people are, I mean I'm WNBA same thing. I I literally bought the WNBA package last Tuesday, I think to watch Atlanta, to watch Atlanta play Indiana. To watch Caitlin, to watch Caitlin Yeah. To watch Indiana play Atlanta. And when I, when I tuned after spending my money signing and doing all that shit, the moment I saw Caitlyn wasn't there, she was hurt. She was hurt. And the game wasn't competitive. If it was competitive, I would've kept watching. No game wasn't competitive. I turned it off. Turned off. And it ultimately, if the, if the players aren't there and the game and the game's not competitive, It is a, It is a terrible mix. I don't think any announcer, I don't think Stephen A whatever, nothing can fix that. You know what I mean? I think that's the NBA had a terrible battle of luck this year.


You know, if you think about all the NBA finals in the nineties, this, this, I, this Ain't no rivalry here. Ain't no the rival outside of the Halliburton, outside of the Halliburton story of all the players raiding him overrated. And now him making it this far, there's no story to this finals really. Right. There's nothing you said, you, you watch it because you're a basketball fan. I think those are the only people that are really watching this finals right now are just the diehard just fans of the sport. I agree with you. I think, I think that ultimately I think the NBA's being greedy and I think they doing a whole bunch of shit based on money and saving money in their bottom line. They fired a bunch of people that the, the, the, the public liked.


You know what I'm saying? Because they didn't want to pay him. And I think that's it. Coming back to Rooster. Lemme get final picks before we close from everybody in case anybody's changed. I'm still riding with Indiana. It, it, the odds aren't looking as good, but I Want the Pacers to win. But I want the pace to win. But it looks like the thunder win. I'm still riding with the, I'm still gonna take Indiana. They won 68 games. I'm going Back on my shit. Yeah. Okay. See I want the Pacers to win. I said okay, C was gonna win in the beginning, but I'm rooting for the Pacers. Yeah. I'm Rooting for the pace. I really want the Pacers to Be Me too. Even though I'm happy for Sam Presty who I just learned. That was a fun find. They said they found Sam Presley's old rap slash Blues album that he made.


Okay. And he's on the cover. Oh shit. No, I haven't heard it but I know it's better than three stacks Fucking flute album. Piano album Was hard. Both of them. Oh please Fuck with the flute album. Ace Bailey is rumored to be shooting down draft boards. Yes. A projected top three pick now in some mock drafts is nowhere near the top three. And this is because he's missing workouts. He's refusing the interview with certain people. Please. Yeah. I mean, you, you hit the nail on the head. He's dropping down draft boards. I'm as a 76 er fan who Yes, we're in the lottery.


We have the number three spot, the big talk it initially was do we draft a Ace Bailey? Do we draft the other kid from Rutgers Harper Harper. And and it was like Ace Bailey was kind of at the top of people's list at the beginning. Rumors came out that Bailey said he would not work out for the Sixers and there were several other lottery teams that he would not work out. Some people in this campus said that's not true. The Sixers said that he, they were never refuse. They were very careful with their words. They said he never refused to work out. Some of the rumblings are saying that he's asking for, he needs specific development plans or plans to make him a superstar in order for him. Like what is your team's plan for to make me a superstar before he goes to work out for them. I understand that some players have leverage and I want players to exercise all the leverage they have.


But this might be some old man get off my lawn and shit, but I'm just a little tired of these young kids who are unproven, who are not number one picks, who are not number two picks coming out here making all these demands, demands before they even work out for a team. That's all I'm saying. And I, and I, I'm worried that the kid is going to hurt his draft stock and lose far more money than he could have and, and maybe ruin a reputation fair or unfair for these kinds of demands. And I just, I just don't like it. I just, I just go work out for people and see what happens. I think it's just a side effect of NIL. Same thing with the shado in, in the, in the league. It is pushback from the league and it's overconfidence in the players. It's both kind of meet in the head and it's gonna be a a a stalemate.


Yeah. Ain't hungry no more. I just pull up some of these mock drafts dog. First of all, let me say that this draft is deep. This ain't really the one to play around in. Yeah. Like I wouldn't just be skipping a bunch of workouts. Right. This ain't the one to play. You go Number three to number Eight. Yeah, because VJ Edgecomb is nice. Short dude from Kansas is nice, but this mock draft I'm looking at and this dude is nice too. The con knupple, the shooting dude, the big boy, big white boy from Duke. They got him in the fourth slot, mock draft I saw. Had him at nine, 10, and 11.


So yeah. This is, I ain't nobody picking him over a Bailey. No. It's a lot, it's a lot of politics that come along with basketball. So a Bailey is close to me. Like I got personal information on Ace Bailey that his camp is my camp. So a lot of the politics in the sport play. Can you just pause for a minute? Yeah. We got A boss. IIII know Joe. I I don I have no doubt about that but Joe, you what? The whole roommate of fa now we all gonna Okay. You know, continue, continue. I'm Fuck with. Well no, 'cause we know, I don't care what face we know the agent story but they let you go. I thought, I don't care what Face State made, I I wanted to know what the, I'm telling you that But you about to be serious. So, so you talking about niggas lives like Yeah. You talking about some shit that could affect somebody getting a check. No, We just wanted to laugh at you.


Oh, that's Cool. I'm saying that you said it was your camp Like you part of it. Yeah. So so a lot of basketball, beef politics. I Didn you left it at all. Oh, I'm lost. Go ahead. A lot of this shit is politics. A lot of the shit be based on who represents you and what their, What's That, who likes them. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And so if you don't want to play by old boy rules, then the niggas will do their best chance to kill everything you got going on. IE shado like It is get down or lay down. And a lot of times these people be having the ability to put out press stories, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. To make you look a certain way or to demonize you a certain way if you don't want to adhere to what they, they want you to Do.


I I'm gonna say this, Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey two lottery picks. Yes. They did not make the NCAA tournament. Okay. That is not a good sign. And so I think teams are already questioning certain things. We started it with Ben Simmons when with with teams that have that much talent, don't make the tournament. You named two people. Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm, I'm naming two situations where very high pick has some questionable playoff success and people start questioning. I'm not cri I don't, to be honest, I didn't watch enough college basketball. I have an opinion on this. What I'm just talking about reputationally, I'm just saying that this is adding another layer to it. It might be, I'm not saying it's not political. I don't know. I don't know enough to know. But what I do know is skipping workouts is not a good sign when teams are already raising questions about your, your your will to win and your leadership and whether you are a superstar.


And I will also say I don't see too many times where two with two lottery picks don't make the, don't make the tournament and they turn out to be elite NBA players. This is my take You talking about 19-year-old boys, bro. So when you start talking about somebody's leadership ability and you start talking about somebody's mental, again, you, you, 'cause you are a advocate of them stamping young black boys and when they stamp you, you never get away from that stamp. So I don't want to perpetuate some stereotypical thing about a kid that I know personally saying that they not manageable or that they got attitude issues or they got these other negative things. The stereotypes that come across from with them. 'cause it carries them throughout the duration of their life.


Yeah. For motherfuckers that don't know them. So let me, lemme, so is he telling teams I'm not working out for you? No, I his representation is his representation and what they decide is what they decide. What I'm saying is you gotta live and die with the choices that you make. But don't put that they have these behavioral issues or that they stubborn or that they not negotiable because those things, like I said carry carry you. Yeah. I'm not saying that that's What they did to drop sha door from a first round draft pick to a fucking fourth round pick. Maybe It shouldn't have been a first round pick though. You know, you might not have. Yeah, not I'm talking about the other. Yeah, but ain't nobody about to say that. But It is intangible things. You get what I'm saying? You could go from a Third pick, they might say it's not number three, pick my Nigga. You could go from a third pick to a ninth pick.


That might be 20, $30 million based on somebody spreading an untrue narrative about you. Yeah. But but here but the best way To solve that would be to show up to show up to the workout. That's why maybe, maybe not. It depends on it niggas be having rational reasons why they don't do certain things when it comes to that shit. Then they need to announce that, that that's, I'm, I don't know if he's unmanageable I don about East bail. No, you can't announce that because that's gonna look away to other teams. Exactly. Nigga Kobe Bryant said y'all, I'm not going to Charlotte, I'm not coming here. He said that I'm not going to Charlotte. Y'all gotta figure something out. Well It was a little more complicated than that. He, the Lakers had already wanted him. Kobe Bryant. Thank you. Said I'm not going to Charlotte. I'm not playing Charlotte. But he had already been told by the Lakers that they wanted to trade for him And you now know, and it's the thing, mad shit be getting told to these kids behind closed doors before days leading up to the draft, cer certain stories.


They release certain stories that they don't. Okay, that's true. So you're saying that Kobe Bryant got told X, Y, and Z, they wanted you to know he got told that I don't give a fuck what happens nigga, back then somebody's saying I'm not going to a team that picks me at number 14. But That was after they drafted him. He still worked out for them. Nevermind bro. No, Just listen To what I'm saying. Yeah, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the part where you are as a child making demands on me going or playing or not going to whatever the case may be. Whether you saying, yo, I'm not gonna go work out for you or you saying you drafted me and I'm not playing for you. I think they in the same vein. See I Think they're different. I think they're different. I think because one is behind, this is what I'm saying. One, I show up for everybody, right. Oh, you drafted me. I don't wanna go there. This one I'm not showing up for you.


You, you, you, you, you. Which could send a message to the other teams. Right? Got It. That you are just hard to Oh yeah, you ain't even made it yet. And you already said what you not going to do this, This. Yeah. This is all I'm saying. I agree with you. You Haven't played an NBA game yet and you saying what you not gonna do. It's every kid's dream to go to the NBA, right? Yes. Just being drafted in the NBA is a zillion of one odds. So you get drafted as an 18-year-old kid and you say, yo, I ain't playing for y'all. Fuck you talking about? I'm not playing for y'all. That sounds crazy bro. It don't actually, the bingos is going through that Now. That's my point. So to some motherfuckers that sounds insane. And to some people they like, no, I want to take my career into my own hands With that bingo.


Shit, I didn't even know that was a rule that that homeboy that got drafted And apparently if you don't like the team you got drafted to, you could reenter the draft Next year. Yeah, next year. Next year. There's a whole big beef right now because the second round picks are trying to get guaranteed money. Goddamn damn Right. But What do you do during that year if you don't like the team that draft you, you go It out, you go work, Stay healthy, you work out all year and get prepared for, for The next time. And then if you don't like the team that drafts you the second time, then you could sit out and come back as a just an undrafted producer raft. Yeah. See I think, I think, I think it's a fine line when we sit up here and we talk about, yo, I like for these people to take their futures into their own hands. Right. It's a really fine line. It is. Because you have to understand my nigga, you are taking your future into your own hands, but also recognize that you are blessed.


But isn't there a way to do it? Yeah. Isn't Isn't it? Yes. But who determines what's the way the league, the people that you're trying to impress? No, not the league. Because then we saying if we going by what the league to people up here, everybody up here preaches this independent thought. Yeah. And this break of establishment, et cetera, et cetera. Shado Sanders did it his way. Some motherfuckers do it they way you gotta live and die with the consequences. And that's all I'm saying. That's it. This is all I'm saying. But You, but you sitting up here and you started demonizing this kid, I not on saying negative things about this kid. I didn't demonize him. Alright. What did I, no, lemme No, hold on. What did I say to demonize him? What can I say negative about him? Okay. And I'm asking you, what did I say negative? I don't remember, but it's cool generally what, 'cause we had a Conversation off, off mic too, but it's all right.


Yeah. And oh, here's, here's what I said. I said he's looking like this. I'm saying he's making a bad decision. We can disagree about the decision he's making. Again, I don't know him, I don't know. He could be the greatest kid in the world. My fear is that by refusing to work out for the team, he's going to look Ostracizing To. Yeah. He's gonna look like he's not manageable and he's going to look like a, like, like he's going to play into bad, into certain narratives that are gonna be used to justify dropping him. I'm not saying he is those things I'm saying it's a bad strategy. It just hear me out, hear me out. I'm saying It is a bad strategy and you ask, is he actually refusing? Yes. That's a fact. He's refusing to work out for certainty And I think that's Bad.


Yeah. I just think it's a bad idea. Again, doesn't make him a bad kid. It might be the greatest outcome form in the world, but I'm saying it doesn't work. The difference to me between what he did and what Kobe did, and Kobe never actually refused to play for the Hornets. But what he did say is he, but what he did say is, I only wanna play for the Lakers. He still worked out for the Hornets. Right. He still did all the things you're supposed to do. And then quietly behind the scenes after he was drafted. Oh, before really his agents were working and before he was drafted, Jerry West was working before he was drafted. Then immediately after the draft they traded him. Right. Because Shaq also going to the Lakers. There was a whole bunch of things happening, but Kobe's team managed it in a way where Kobe didn't look like a bad guy. Whether even if he, he still did his part.


Right. That's all I'm saying. There's a way to manage this so that Ace Bailey doesn't look like he's just a, a, a, a stubborn kid who doesn't wanna play. Because I think, and I think his team is doing him a disservice if they're the reason why he's not working out again, he might be the greatest kid in the world. I hope he is. I'm just, I I'm not demonizing him at all. I just, I think that he, but I think he's just making a bad, I think he's a bad presentation for himself. That's all I get. Aisha's passion because like you said, he's close to the family. Yeah. I don't see Ace Bailey fall to the 11th. I seen one to five. I don, I don't see Ace Bailey in the position where he is about to lose all these millions of dollars. I don I Ace Bailey probably has the highest upside and damn near everybody in the draft. I think so too.


That's why I want him to go to the right place. The N NBA A is based on potential. Totally. All right. Our part of the show tier. Oh, 18-year-old It is some nigga name Artio. Okay. Some nigga What up? Some nigga Artio says you. Yep. So y'all listen, I gotta turn myself in this week and I'm not sure. And I'm not sure if they're gonna keep me lame ass New Jersey bail reform. Do y'all hate it as much as I do? That was in parentheses. Anyways, Joe, how do you feel about Andy Milaka not only being older than you, but also having a more successful rap career than you Damn hope they free me to hear the response.


Big Jersey love always, always a Jersey person. Now, I would love to know what jurisdiction you're in. I know. Any minute I could hear the show on MTV so I could call the jail myself. No. And tell Wow. Hello. Tell them To the key people. No, I'm not gonna do that. Yeah, come on. You about to say some ignorant shit. Super ignorant. Oh bitch. The rest of these shit is mad long. Should I read one? Oh man. Let's see Craig piece of the whole Paw Crew, long time listener here. And in the day job I lead go to market for AI at one of the world's biggest tech companies.


So I figured it's time to drop some insider intel for part of the show. Oh, before the next wave hits harder than streaming ever did. First the label verse AI fight Universal, Sony and Warner are negotiating to license their catalogs plus grab equity to generative music startups. The this is the Timbaland conversation. Ultimately You D and Suno Deals that would also wipe out billion dollar copyright suits business times. Yet the word artist never appears. No reps, no splits, no approvals. So once again, creators risk being spectators while models that can replace them, not only distribute them get built, not just distribute them.


Get built. Here's what creators can do. Run every contact, every contract through chat, GPT, clawed or Gemini and redline future technologies and derivative works loopholes, pre-clear samples of your own catalog so you can legally train a person, model a personal model. And RapidFire micro songs for TikTok slash shorts and bundle AI stems with merch. Patreon tears, or even fan facing chatbots. So the upside stays in house. He's killing this shit. He is. He is second Absolutely.


Smoking Google. Deep Minds. Deep Minds is VO three text to video model is already warping virality. It is quote unquote millions of videos generated in days. Says CEO Sir Demi has in parentheses it says the neuron with historical slash bible times influencer skits blowing up so hard. Real influencers can now claim to be 100% AI for traffic for scale. YouTube sees about 2.6 million uploads a day and TikTok about 34 million.


But AI made clips, AI made clips could soon swamp both meaning human made content will coexist in an ocean of synthetic competition. The attention pie isn't getting bigger. AI is just slicing it thinner. So every artist and podcaster needs a strategy and maybe their own tools to keep audiences locked in. I know the pod has eyes on all industry smoke. This is the next fire. So if you ever want a quick AI State of the Union, I can send fresh notes whenever you need them. Keep podding, keep creating and keep the culture first.


CK Oakland, California Loop Fire. So Loop. I'm hitting the round of applause for that, right? Yeah. The real thing that needs to happen is legislation. Like instead of, I mean we also need to learn how to play with it, but there needs to be legislation on copyright infringement. 'cause that's all the AI is. It's, it's reinterpreting, preexisting artistic works And that is illegal. I agree. But that's us begging, right? No, it sound like what he's saying. That's the constitution. Yeah. What he's saying is army yourself and jumping. You jump in here as well. Just in case. That's why I said I think we have to do both. Both. But right there needs to be legislation and people like us with voices should be pushing for legislation to happen as opposed to just saying, oh this is big and scary or Oh this is the greatest thing.


We can make millions of dollars off it. There needs to be A-A-A-A-A change in the legislation. It needs to be altered. I totally agree with that. Copyright law needs to be amended for ai. Ai It's digital. So what happens when AI is at a point where it can just compile all its data and create something on its own? It's still taking data from preexisting songs and creating new songs from it. It's still derivative work, But cool. I'm I'm not disagreeing with you. Yeah, I'm just saying. Let's say it takes billions, literally billions of different data. Right. And compile something from it. How do you now go to, to Washington and say, yo, this should get a payout and this should get a payout and this should get a payout and this you get a payout.


This Company I've spoke to AI companies. That's all traceable. This is, we're talking about data. It is the same way we talk about streams. Lemme finish. All of the information is getting put in there is traceable. It can be traceable and they can figure out how to divvy up the money. Even even if they don't do that, they can make some blanket licenses that cover creators in general, if your shit is being thrown in the pool, same way they do with ASCAP or BMI to break up performance royalties. Isn't that a little bit more definitive? No, the the, the performance royalty. When your song is played in a club, when it's played in a music stadium or whatever, it's all a big pool that gets divvied up by percentages. It's not necessarily accurate. A hundred percent accurate. This was played over here.


So you get six sense for that. This is played over here? No, they kind of divvyed up by total streams. Same way streaming companies divvy up money. They're not, you don't, when you plus play on Apple music on whatever a Drake song, it's not necessarily going, the sixth sense is going directly to that. When they show the little charts of breakdowns, you get 0.0001 sense. It's not necessarily per stream. They, it's a pool. They put everything together and divvied up by the numbers of everything being played. So you could do everything Is data traceable? This is not the old days where it's like, oh, I don't know where these ideas came from. No, it's all in a machine. If the machine can do all these super complex algorithmic things, it can absolutely keep track of where the fucking shit came from. We gotta make sure the sign is up to Parks is what do we do with AI course that he has?


I don't have those course whatcha Talking about? You should have course It is a conversation. You should get a course conversation. I know, but it's a deep one. Yeah, I think, I think it's scary. I think it's gonna get beyond control. I think it's gonna get to a place where you can't control it and It, it's not just, it's not music and art by the way. It's, it's it's written works life. It's life. It's journalism. It's, it affects everyone. I've been like, AI is amazing. I know a lot of people that are using it for really dope shit and I think it's, it's fine. But there also, there needs to be a way for that pie to be divvied up. This guy that runs sono. So I've seen some interviews with like saying the democratization of art and all that stuff is awesome but it's not, if it's all just derivative work that's stealing from other people's shit. It should be, everyone should make money off this shit if your shit is getting understand.


Yeah. Yeah. I just don't see how you could really generate income from it. They're generating millions of dollars subscribers here today. It costs $20 a month to use a open, open. I'm talking about the artists. You guys can y'all please continue this conversation at another time? Oh okay. Okay. Sure. Did you send Parks your sleepers? No. Yeah. Yes. Already did. Everybody needs to. Everybody. We did it. You did it. I'm in there right now. You mumbling? Yeah, I'm going. DESTIN CONRAD. Okay. DESTIN CONRAD. I think we highlighted this record here. Probably one of my favorite records off his project. We are going with jumping.


I'm dumb. I got so much I shit and I'm, I just, my and I you bring me, I been feeling crazy and my dust's been intrusive and I miss my baby.

So shout down. Yeah, it wasn't actually fired. That was fired Joe. Thanks Freeze. Saying things like I made it, I saying things like I made it. Nah, it's a fire pick though. So, but thanks. Re I'm going, I'm going home team. I'm going Big Jersey. I wanna shout my brother Ars out. He he has a new, he got a whole new team. Yeah, he got a new team, new manager, A new deal.

What do y'all say Slick shit Like though? No, but it say shit like I played this little slap I was looking for outro record. I gotta close the window before I don like Big You record girl. Come on. So then Ish looked to ice and said from what I heard from this far away anyway.


Okay I tell you if you're Correct Ish looked at ice and said yo could you write this? That is, that is what he said. Ice very promptly said no. No Ish didn't say nothing. But I was so befuddled by the question. I asked him if he thought he could write this and he did not answer. He just did his resting his face at me. So I'll ask again while the mics is on to see if he got the kahuna. See if he's, if he got sufficient Kahunas. Do you think that you could do that? Nope. You know they'll like you.


That's right. That's cow cower Build a house in the dirt baby. There go. So Why you asking me if I Could do it? Colin, cower cower Nick, Colin cower Nick. Wow Yo no you ain't gotta play with your kicks. Well we about to end it. You can play with your sneakers all day. Men is talking to you. Me and Ice is asking you something 'cause you had a lot of slick shit off the mic to say love to slick or not say he's yo he's so could you write It? You gonna be a stubborn ass grandpa. Is that what I'm doing? If you ignore the kids or niggas gonna sit up here, we want you to speak to us about what we asking You. This nigga put the pretending pretentious this motherfucker.

I'm I don wanna speak for him. My opinion ism not, I'm not saying that I don't think Ish thinks it's very difficult to rap.


No, I think it, I think, and again I don won't speak for me either. I think Ish his, his style of hip hop that he likes. I said the Hip It is more No It is more. It is more lyrical, more you like that Rics. So when you hear something that's a little bit more, alright So I take it back based, I think Ish thinks that the simpler raps are easy to do. Yes. Yes. I think he did So but he's right here. Why we speaking for the nigga? Because you won't Answer because he wanna play with his sneakers and fix his fucking muffin shirt and be cute. Cool nigga be cute. We'll do it. No, but how can you say that? Because when he, earlier when we played the Pusha T record, he was like the beat is fired. But what he's saying was nah, he didn't say that He be a tough critic But he wasn't moved by the song. He didn't say like the rap was easy to write.


Like he, he might have thought it was complicated to write and still just not like the song Bro.
