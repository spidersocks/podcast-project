And then I saw the hand, I was like, oh, casino the hammer. It came out. That was, that was my instant thought. Once, once I saw the Hampton Inn, that's when I said, oh, he's full of shit. If Jay Leno was staying at a Hampton Inn, he is the most frugal man we have ever seen in the entire Washington.


And we know that he's not. He Throw outta my brain. Jay Leno in at the Hampton Inn. I done stayed almost at all of the Hampton Inns. I've never seen Jay Leno. Listen, you ain't gonna see Jay Leno neither. Unless Todd DiUS might be in there. He ain't got no business. You know what I mean. That could be where the as whooping came from too. And that's where as whooping came from. You think he tried to cut his Shorts? Try to short it. Why would j answer me this? Jay Leno has all the money in the world. Yeah, he has. He does a ton of it. So explain it to me. Why he's at the Hampton Inn. No. No. Why would he owe anybody anything Gambling debts To the point where somebody's beating his ass. It could be gambling, could be I owe you and I aint, it could be I owe you and I'm Jay Leno. So I ain't paying pay you. And I feel like it You know what I mean.


It could be a bunch of shit. It could be yo It could have pressed up on someone's, Someone's the sexual encounter gone wrong for him to be at a Hampton Inn. The slu the step step a foot in the Hampton. I don't give a fuck if it's the best Hampton Inn in the United States of, of America. They, they, They say some of the artists is usually, some of the entertainers are usually cool with the owners of the chain. So they'll stay at some of them. No, You're staying. That was the reason that they gave like, yo, they may be cool with the, the chain owner of the Hampton Inn. Maybe he owns a part of the Hampton Inn. I don't care. He Ain man. Nigga Hampton is eye. He's Not for Jaylen s not for, it's not alright for Jay Leno. Isn't that the Quinta or whatever.


It might as well be for him. Oh. Shit. I just don't get, would you stay at La Quinta? No. That's like Jay Leno standing at the Hampton Inn. That's ka He would stay at La Quinta and put 30 people in there with $2,500 for them to try that. I long they stay. It Escape the LaQuinta. That's hating. That's disgusting. I wouldn't stay the La Quinta nigga. No, Listen, the Hilton owns Hampton Inn. Yeah, right. If I'm cool with the Hiltons, I'm gonna stay at the best fucking Hilton that there has to offer. But he was in that area. I know, I know. I know him. They told Him. Well guess what area it was. Tell me Erda area. Fuck you talking about bro.


No, there's, there's sprinters nicer than the Hampton in that he would appreciate that Oh. Shit. He would, if he was gonna be doing anything, he would be in a nice ass sprinter. Where did the rumor come from that he may owe somebody some money. Where did that come from? 'cause it looked like a owe somebody some money as so we just, we just, We just speculated We are speculating. Oh, okay. I do not have any Does Jalen having bad look? Does Jalen not have a gambling problem? I don't know I've ever heard of speculation. He might have a female problem and he might have ran into the wrong nigga's. Female could Be that. Could they beat him? Like That and Fish. Mr. Him up? Yeah. His Fucking was his wife. His whole face nigga. Like somebody stepped on his face, nigga and held they foot there Or, or he was at the Hampton Inn getting a little bit of strange. Yeah. For change. And she was a setup for who really wanted him.


There Could be that. Now I was confused at him doing an interview. But Parks is telling me he's, he Did a show that night. He performed and he did a show the day after. Like. That. Yes. Great content. Yeah. It Is J don't give a fuck. Hey man, Try to get that Doesn't make sense. The gig is the gig. That just does not make sense. Doesn't matter Any, you own a brand. Like, like y'all said, he gotta get to it. Artists have canceled for less. For much less. Yeah. I feel like one of 'em was a either the, the night of where the interview happened or the day after was like a charity type of event. So maybe he felt obligated To obligated. Obligated. Yeah. I gotta show up for this. Yeah. I gotta, I'm gonna give y'all some money. I got pneumonia.


Fuck you. Are you crazy? Yeah. I'm not coming outside my face looking like this is fucking, this pissing me off man. Because all my life I thought that Jay Leno had hands. What? Why? Why the fuck is you talking about How old is Jaylen now? Shit. Something He too old to be. And then 74 nigga that's, he's 74. That's the other reason, you know he lying. 'cause the hill would've killed him at 74 a fall is is different. When your parent or somebody call and say, Hey I fell. It's the hospital er foot surgery. He would've had some more broken cheek than just 44.


Falling is different. Why is the fall so farfetched? I can see you falling, trying to brace yourself. Flipping over. I can see that You only break your hand and hit your face. That's it. You Can't hit your face on the rock. At 75 years old. My no ribs, no shoulders, no nothing, no hip, no nothing. Andy say he was walking to the store or something. I He's trying to walk down to the restaurant. A 60 Foot hill. They told that nigga and you better not say nothing. A 60 foot hill. You richer than rich. What's, what's Wrong? Ah, yeah. Niggas walk being rich. Everybody's not Jewish. No, I don't. I think that people made him be visible. Mm.

We going to break your face and your hand and send you out there to have to answer for it. So you could say something stupid like I fell down a hill. It's possible. What Hill? Where was he?

That's the question. It's two Greatest part in The world. It is why Did we skip from Jay Leonard to Penguin? It's a little, I mean, I mean you, they kind of resemble anyway because he didn't want to have someone like close to him. I think was the That was the gist. The gist. It was a weakness. And I mean from like a production standpoint, like you gotta make the villain super villainous going into the next It was corny Chapter.


That's not, that's not true. Why? Because the the best villains are the people that They're villains. Yeah. The real villains. We don't even know. We don't hate villains. We we don't hate them. We dont know if Theo is is VA villain? Well that's, we don't know if Magneto is a villain. We don't know if, if Joker is, we don't know who the villain. That's True. But we were kind of root, at least from my perspective, I was rooting for Penguin during the whole eight episodes. True. So you gotta do something to be Like, not me. I always thought he was doing some crackhead shit. Well he was, do you wanna see him come up because he's, Every plan he was putting together was just like, dog, all you selling drugs. s like, nah, that's not true. What was he doing? He, he, he fought off two separate mafia families successfully.


Yeah. Ah, ka What? Because shorty killed her whole family. If they was alive, they'd have been ended him. Yeah. Shorty did that. That's not true. How do you figure She did do that? But he infiltrated that family and still was manipulating all that shit. Still he could Have killed her in his sleep if he wanted to kill her. I mean, yeah. Even down to the last scene. Like he coulda He could, he coulda killed her at mad times. Who did penguin kill? That was Gully the nigga in the beginning. The mafia Boston nigga that came outta jail in the last scene. The last He didn't, he didn't kill No, he had heart attack some shit. Yeah. He killed My man the beginning. That said it all killed the beginning.


In the beginning. Yeah. He, He was a pussy. He was a drug addict. The son that was gonna be the, that was gonna take over his father. He ain. The boss's son was a drug addict. That was not heavy lifting. Right. But he was the wait do you look down on drug addicts? No. No. I'm just saying. Jesus Christ. So you say things with your Karen voice and it'd be like, we gotta add some they some effects. Yeah. To That. Like, and sometimes the drug drug addicts be tough or at least Resilient. Yeah. Okay. Well this particular one, he was, you know, he was a, He's a Depo baby. Yeah. He Sitting in a fucking loveseat having tea. He didn't kill nobody. That was Ill. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, That's, he was by a fireplace. Yeah, That's true. It Was Penguin gotta kill somebody real Season two.


Season two. He gotta kill somebody else. Get into it. Thanos didn't play Noos Got it. First scene. He Got it. Hey, Thanos didn't play. He who y'all love the most. He did. He didn't play first scene. Got it. I man fucking. Alright, so you think this is the best comic book series of its kind like drama series. Like compared to like the Marvel way better Than Daredevil. Daredevil. Way better Than Dared Jessica James and all that shit. Those are good though. Better. Way better than those though. The Penguin. Yeah. Penguin was the best. All that shit. Way better. The boys. I Ain't watching Is the boys included in this? I don't know if that's the same. It is, It is, but It is, it's not.


The boys is fired. If the boys is included in this, the boys is fucking fire. I Don't know if Pgu moon's better than the boys. Well, I mean don't know about we only, we're comparing one season to five seasons though. You know what I mean. Oh, I only joined three seasons. Oh no, I'm caught up. They said that season one, season one of the boys, they, they was kind of so the shit's immediately With the shit's. Im Yeah. Season one of the boys. That's a good question. Also, I saw race, ask a question and I started with Pusha Teesa. Let me ask y'all, who picks better beats? Pusha Tee or Rick Ross? Ross. Ross. I saw him ask the same question. Ross is might be, and my comment, my He Might be the best ever at That Is one the best. My comment I stand by, which was I picked Ross. They're both fucking amazing.


But Pusha Tee had the advantage of having Pharrell and Yay for most of his career. And Ross had to pick them. Ross was, I mean he, he had Justice League and other amazing producers, but he brought them out a little bit. You know what I mean. Yeah. He didn't have 'em from the rip. Yeah, exactly. You go back to Port of Miami album. It wasn't that true. Yeah. He came in with fire. Yeah. So I gotta give it to Ross. But they're both amazing. It's Ross. And even if you have Pharrell and Ye, you still gotta pick the right beats. Yeah. You do the right shit to him. So that's true. Alright, if Ross is one, I think pusher is one CI Don't think I really ever heard push out a bad beat. So Me, me neither. Jalen. Oh, you are alive. I can't believe that he tried to get that off, but fuck it.


What else? What else, what else, what else? What else y'all wanna talk about his future gq? Sure, let's have it here. He said whatever he said. I don't know. Take it away. Take it away. Y'all say what? He said I don't care. I don't care. I was over the beef. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I don't see why now that that was my whole, that was my main takeaway. Why? Why are you doing this now? He been in hiding. I mean, He ain't really, he ain't been in hiding Music. He's been outside. I just don't see, when I say hiding, like I'm talking about as far as him speaking publicly. We haven't really heard him speak publicly much since the summer time. No, we haven't. We don't really hear him speak publicly at all. So now that they got me a camera in front of my face with a microphone, they gonna start asking me certain questions and I'm gonna give my answers to those questions.


I guess I'm not with the mind game. Oh. Shit, I read, I read This shit and somebody found what he said so we could Yeah, I'm Looking it up right now. I read whatever he said. He Said there was a beef question Mark Impishly smirking as he stands up to roll another joint. I didn't even know there was a beef. I didn't even know they had nothing going on. I never part participated in rap battles. Man. Wow. I feel I can't tell if there's sarcasm. I think that's sarcasm. Are You being, Well obviously that's not the one that I, I'm talking about. He says something along the lines of Don't worry, I'm gonna find enough. Enough of y'all. Enough of y'all. Yeah. That that's just a what Beef y'all. Y'all talking about a beef. I don't know what you're talking about. Shit. Like. That. But the big three comments where he's like, I should have been offended if anything, because you You.


right. Here we go. It's just big me. Kendrick was also implicitly leaving Future out of the Pantheon. Future points out. I'm supposed to be the one who gets mad. I'm still confused about that. Nobody cares about what? I think future continues breaking into a laugh. That was so fucked up. That's what was so fucked up about This shit. To the point where I'm so player that I ain't even said anything to the public about how I feel about it. Like why is everybody mad when he was talking about me on my song? So y'all three, I'm nobody. Oh wait, so y'all just forgot about me. I ain't a part of this big three.


I'm nobody on my song. Man. If I didn't get mad, nobody should have gotten mad. If I would've been really mad about it and I made something out of it, then someone else could be like, oh, I can make something else about it. Okay. That's a whole lot of light circular, a whole bunch of nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Write this down. No, I'm Justelle, I'm about edit. Oh, it's shame. It pains me that we have to do this. Like honestly, I, I feel like the entertainment and music business is so dry that these niggas is playing mind games and now I have to come in and, and fuck, what the fuck is he talking about?


I don't really know. Well, I mean I get the point. I understand what he's saying. Feeling. Stop it Ram you know future. You know who the big three is when they say it. That's it. That's it. That's it. But his e but so, so I feel like he, we just being objective, his ego can say fam, y'all calling these niggas the big three. My numbers and my catalog and my history puts me in that he would be correct. He's right, he's right. We know. When you say the big It is always been, it's always been the same three. Not disagreeing, I'm just saying from what he read. I mean from what you just read, he's saying, dog, I could be offended that you saying y'all the big three. Fuck everybody. It's just big me on my song.


You not even giving me. But you've never been considered a part of the big three, right? You've never threw yourself in the big three. You've never made any mention of a big three. You never did none of that. You was always over here doing your thing. Your numbers been that you dropped three number ones this year and you've also been one of the more unbothered rappers in the world. Yeah, exactly. Honestly, future don't care about nothing. None of This shit. Which also lets me know that this is a crock of shit because he don't care. That's why I said why are we hearing about this name? He was the first one. He was the outside of the engineers. He was the first one to hear that Kendrick verse. He heard it. He know what it said. He approved it.


He put it out and it went ah, it worked. It got number one. And then, and then because then Kendrick went home. Kendrick Kendrick went home and then I heard the next album and you would still saying the same shit. That's why he fucked me up. That's why it was confusing a little bit because I'm like, wait a minute. I had, I heard these albums, Great albums by the way. Oh he smoked. He smoked a year. He might have rap of the year for me up here with Kendrick, but he's got future shit. It is tight. Yeah. But I heard those albums and I know what you was doing outside of Kendrick Metro and Mustard. Like it ain't recant. It ain't recant time. I was there, you know what time It is? The big three is dumb. I'm shooting at dumb.


You knew I was shooting it. My mom hates when we say dumb, Dumb Dumb. Instead we don don them them. We say them. She says, she says all of us. And I never heard it until just now. What About Mm, No, you de shooting at him. Not mad. Don't say damn. I don't think just deed. Okay. Deed Noted. Anyway. The Executive producer. Sorry miss that. Yeah, we Got it. We'll work on it. Yeah. But yeah, yeah, yeah. This is just like sarcasm to me. No. Or this is It is my man. No, nah, aint Well I gotta, we got, we we smoothing that out. Let me come out and do something.


Some some damage Control. Yeah. Damage control. That's the word I'm looking for. I agree with that. Could be that what you call yourself again Thug. Put that tweet out. What'd you call yourself? A diplomacy artist. Yeah. That but I, I don't even think it's That is Thug. Put that tweet out before. Yo let's dead. This basically Cool now I'm home. It's diplomacy time. It's diploma. Yeah. Now it's time. You see Metro walking it back. You see Future saying what he said like now it's okay, let's move this over. Which I'm, I would like to hear more slaps from the three of them. So I'm not all the way mad at this by the way. Even if It is disingenuous or, and we Know how. And again, like we don't know how dude feel like you and I Drake feel.


Yeah. Drake is really been on his fuck all you nigga shit. So this could be their attempt of trying to, nah, he didn't never do about your future told, he said from day one, I never had a problem with with helping Dog. Man, you ain't never had no problem. What the fuck are you doing? He said that from day one. Like what? What's your problem? Mm. Yeah. I'm not gonna lie to y'all. If I'm Drake, it's up for life. Forever. Forever and ever and ever, ever. I'm never working with none of you. None of, I don't think any of that's gonna happen. Each and every one of y'all, I wouldn't. You know me bro. I bro what? And I'm gonna be up. I got 40 boy Wonder right here. We good. We are good. Fuck I'm be up. You can say whatever you want. If I'm Drake.


Yeah. Future. I never had no problem with you. Yeah. I'll do with Future. But This shit started on your album, you and Metro's album. And you cleared it and you cleared it. You heard that verse. You let it go out. So yeah, I could see why Future will be doing some damage control right now. If I'm Drake, it's up with you too. And if I'm Drake and you hit, let's just say they friends, like genuinely friends for the, for the sake of the conversation. If they genuinely friends and I come to you and be like, dog, you're my friend. Would I ever let somebody do that to you on an album that I was doing? Now you sitting there with the fucking stale face like You, right? Like You, right. Dog. Me. I think time heals all wounds kind of situ. I do. Yeah. You I do. I think that you might Have stabbed enough niggas.


I sometimes I'm not doing that. Sometimes Time wounds all heals. So, Ooh, boy, you good? That's a John Le quote, boy, you good? Okay. Alright. Take that one out for learn me time. What It is all heal, All Healed sometimes. Put that, I'll put that in a T-shirt recipe. Put that on a t-shirt. Breast cancer month. Learn. Yeah. Like, I'm definitely not like fam if we never had no issue on, we really are friends, my nigga. I'm not, I'm not letting nobody shit on you on my album. Exactly. I got the slaps already. I don't care if they all piece it up. Yeah, that's, it's more to be if they don't, if they want to piece it up, piece it up. I'm cool. I'm, I'm done. It happened.


It is over with. The Impact was the impact. If y'all want to piece it up and make songs, bro, bro, we got the Kendrick album now. Like it's, it's, it's over. It is done. If I never get another Drake and Future record again, I'm okay. I got Me too. Got a whole album of it. I got a bunch of singles of it. Like I'm cool as a selfish fan. I'm cool. Either way. They piece it up, bro. Great. They don't great. I Would like more slaps from the two of them. No, I would like it, but I'm just saying if I, if it never happens, it's not like it's, it's not the end of all. That's what, that's what I was saying is like, as time goes on, memory fades and people are just gonna harken back to like the really good times and be like, we could put, we could set our swords aside and just Yeah.


Sometimes bro some Shit. Get back to the Slaps. Sometimes you overstep and ain't no coming back from that. I don't care how much time passed and real some shit, some shit happens and we can't come back from that. Like, I'm not mad. Like even if There's millions and millions and millions of dollars, I got Billions. Okay. Or whatever the case, you start putting money. It's not about the friendship no more. I mean, sometimes, sometimes you look at the greater good of the situation and it's not like you welcome them back into the fold like with open arms, but it's just like for business. Exactly. Nigga, I don't gotta like you to work with you, but I'm up and make money with you. That's, that's when, that's when you're not up, that's when somebody's not up.


We might need to do this, this No, no, no, no. For Drake. It's not even about being up because like, like you said, he's a fucking billionaire. It's about boredom. Mm. Mel It's about, I, let me look, paint, look at it from Drake's perspective. I've ran hip hop for well over a decade, right. My run, even if people say the music was suffering, whatever my run was still my run. All the newer acts, the Sexy Reds, all of that. I'm still him attached to them. Right. I my downfall, if you want to call it that or, or my, my, my trajectory changed all because of this. Everybody that played a part in this, it's up for you niggas.


Like I'm not mad at him. When we talked about the DeMar de Rose and shit, I'm not mad at that same It is up for y'all. I thought I went back and watched the pop out show again and 'cause we would, I remember we talked about Tyler having mustard at his set and what Ty what Mustard did and Mustard brought Tyler out at the popup. You Did So at the pop out. So yeah, even that, it's like, okay, I'm looking at all of y'all nigga away. All of you niggas fuck y'all and I don't need y'all. Yeah. But Canadians are forgiven. He's still Canadian. All right. He's still Canadian. That nigga's petty. He's still Canadian and he's still petty and he's still petty. That's all I'm saying. Them Canadians be forgiven. And I think that nigga's well within is right.

And it worked. Yeah, it did. I would take the credit for it. But if you niggas are scared, nah, you can't take the credit for it because again, now we at the point where we supposed, we trying to smooth This shit out. Yeah. It is like when you thought 50 was dead at the end of power you came back. Yeah. The fire. The fire. That was the end of power right there. Yeah. That Kind of was, that was the end of power. That kind of was That nigga ghost went around putting one in everybody head. I'm gonna knock you out with a, with a piece of tree and then leave you over there.

I might, some shit on Max called like weird evil lives. Don't watch it because it's true to the name. Episode two is a arsonist. It's like a doc who was masturbating from setting houses on fire. Like, that's his kink. Yeah, It's a doc. Well It's one of those series. No, it's Series three episodes. It's a series. It's three episodes series you saw too. Probably. I watched so much murder, death kill shit. It's hard to keep it Straight. The first one is about, I just was watching Man With the Van.


Yeah. The first one is about this dude running around committing sexual abuse. So I don't wanna talk about that. The second one, a arsonist is that's his kink. You said. So he likes some shit. Did he beat off to it? Yes. And he was gay. Wow. The Flat was gay. So some of them houses he was burning just because the dude looked like if he kicked it to to him, he would get dubbed. What? So he burn. So he burned the house up. What the fuck are you Because that was they way, that was his way. That was no, that was, that was his, that the get back. But that was also his way of having the opportunity to say something to the dude when he came running out the burned house. Oh, what burn the house to get you outside time out.


Hey. So he would start to cut the house on fire and then sit there and watch it burn as he jerked off in the car or something? Sometimes. Yeah. And then when homeboy came out, he run game. I'm your refuge. If he lived, come in here Oh, Shit come in here, you're cold out. Some niggas died. But the all no people died like a lot wherever he was doing this at like old people was dying. The names was like Lou Edna Ross All types. So he, yeah, the, he had the fucking, the gallon of water thing, but it wasn't water. He had the little sock burn out. He put in the plastic bag and he is just coming to drop it in front of the door, light in fire and go sit in his car. Like so when you do it, Like That, the whole front of your house is messed up so you can't escape.


And then he graduated to doing buildings. And this was a reenactment or a, this is Fiction I. hope it's not true story. No, It is real. Oh, this was true story. No, these are real stories and Oh, they just reenacted. Yeah, they reenact some of the scenes, but they have the killer's voice speaking from jail, walking you through. Oh no. Walking you through his whole, he's telling you. So lemme ask you when he did the building, that was a orgy We talk a freak off Yo three Fs. And for me, what the fuck is we talking about my nigga anyway was, It's some weird shit. Pyromania Off on a tangent. Yeah. Hey, you did have your shit that you wanted to shoot at Ish for Why we watch our sicko shit.


What did it say? Oh? Shit. I can't remember You back down Because you hit No, I, no, I swear to God. Just remind me and I I'll you Know about, you know how it always clown us for watching the sicko shit. Yeah. And then you dmd me some girly shit and said this is what we can say the next time That is said that To us. I feel like, I feel like it was this, I feel, feel like it was was a psychological fact that said that people who watch like the murder death kill shit have a higher level of intelligence. Or they really like to like the the detective aspect of it. Of kind of dissecting why the person would do the things that they do. So you wanna call 'em stupid because no, don't at Murder death kill shit. No, not at all. Not at all.


Not at All. All right, here we go. Now we got something to say to is yada yada y. Ever wonder why emotionally intelligent people are drawn to true crime documentaries? It's, I'm playing. Yeah, it's the phone. It's the phone commuter. It's because the suspense activates their brains dopamine system and allows them to explore complex emotions and moral dilemmas which satisfies their deep need to understand others. It also allows them to confront dark emotions like fear and anxiety from a safe distance stimulating both the, I don't know this word. Amygdala. Amygdala. Sure. Emotional processing. Amygdala and prefrontal cortex.


Emotional regulation centers of the brain. That's why you're trash. There's nothing wrong with your true crime obsession. Yo amygdala is fucked up. I've been telling him about his me doula got off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This shit ain't right. Make This shit. Look, amygdala look, that's what's on that thumbnail floating around. You're fucked up. Amygdala. Amygdala looking like a dumb ass. What else is happening out there? What else is happening? The Ju Smollett verdict. Ka Ben overturned. Yes. This is the same as future in gq. I was there. I seen it. What do you I seen the little doc shit that they did too.


I saw everything. I saw you walk in the, the, the store get the noose, the subway. Oh that one too? No, the noose Snoop when he bought the, the A hardware. Yeah, he went right in a hardware. Man, come on. I seen all of this. The subway, the Nigerians. You tried to pay 'em off. You text them niggas. You sent them on a trip. I did that. I did that to nigga was girls though. You paid them off. The brother did the walkthrough and you sent them on a trip. Leave me alone. This nigga crazy son. This nigga crazy. Yo. Yeah, so I don't, and I know that It is politics as usual. Some of this stuff Right? Time, Time. I, I Got it written up. I got the writeup that that will tell us why the conviction was overturned.


Have at it. Okay. When Jesse was first, Jesse was first convicted. He and the state's attorney had a plea deal requiring him to forfeit $10,000 bond and do 15 community service hours. So because he completed the end of the deal, the state was required to hold up theirs and overturn his conviction. Some very simple shit. Yo Dog, you could damn near jaywalk and get 30 hours worth of community service. Exactly. They guess nigga a $10,000 fine in 15 hours part. So once you're done, we'll we'll overturn it. It wasn't the whole shit that they were tight, that they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. They spent mad money. They was just tight with him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because dog, we got all the evidence in the world. You spinning us, you spinning us in some fucking circular circle jerk, stop playing with us.


And you made this a national thing for no reason and you creating a social uproar about how this homosexual community is being treated and all of that other stuff. True, true. And you leaned into that knowing that you was fucking lying. But that was another part of the reason why they overturned it was because they felt like he should have never faced a second prosecution. So their insinuation is that it was malicious On behalf of The state. That was that. That, yeah. On behalf of the state. That was the conclusion that they came to. So you found out a nigga lying. Yeah. You should face another that's malice on behalf of the state. This, that's part of the reasons why. Reason why the the thing bullshit. A big Bullshit.


The fuck are we talking about? Dog Empire is over. Good for him. Empire is over. I don't care. It is ruin his whole life. Good for him. He never got another Whoa. Huh? You said good for him? No, I mean like at this point, Oh the fact that they overturned It Is good. No, at this point it's just good to see that there's some kind of resolution. That's it. That's it. The resolution was for lying Nigga. You got Convicted. We have resolution already. He put your cable off of him. I'm not, that sounded a little capish. Yeah, not really. That is, that's cool. It did. You would work with him? Yes. Why does it always come back to that? Would I work with somebody? I would like to continue to be a working actress.


That's That is where I'm going to leave it. I would like to continue to work. But you Can be a working actress. Be really good actors you think. And good directors. And good producers. You think he's a great actor too? You think he's Dope? I think that he's an Yeah. He almost got this subway shit off. If it wasn't for the likes of me. Come in here and tell the truth. Critical thinkers. Yeah. He said it's MAGA country. Y'all so stupid. He really almost got that off on y'all. He said it's MAGA country in the middle of downtown Chicago. Chicago Hoops. And he said he was walking to Subway. Yo. No, no. It's great Subway. So look, look, just, just take this right. Imagine if they convicted somebody for that. What If they con, let say they found Somebody Oh oh for the alleged hate crime, et cetera, et cetera.


Yeah, I understand. Well We added I. hope Jared from Subway's doing Bad Word. Yeah, Yeah. True. Creep ass And fat as fuck. Sick. No, he gained way back fucking sicko. He gained the way back.

Because idiot, because when We on the shaft, you know We on the all y'all just getting out. Stand on the thing. We about to open the thing. So you talk to some them? I'm talking to 'em.

You can see the little, they give you a little like a bus ticket now. Oh. You get on the bus? So you walk across. Well you don't have to tell me. Yeah, you can ride, you can see em. I'm, I'm not going back, yo, I'm not going back to Hudson County. Shout out to everybody that's over there. That new jail two free way here. Yeah, I'm not going back over there. County right there. Both of 'em. You crazy. It only took me here in one time. They say hey, they pricking niggas with HIV needles. Oh. Oh no. Mm m yo. When you hey scared me straight.


It wasn't another crime. What's that crime? They used to come over there and lock me up on fucking Clinton. And was I soliciting? Huh? Wait, whoa, whoa. Were listening. Yo. Were you Soliciting? Dude are just selling ass S that nigga got got scoliosis Jumping in. Shit. I wasn't really soliciting. You just look like it when it was a group, group.


It was a group of us that was lots of yo and that was the liquor store right there. And we was alcoholics. So if, if it was 10 of us or 15 of us right there, they used to get all us, make us against the wall and put every single thing you could put loitering, loitering, noise. They came out some with some shit in East Orange called wandering and remaining because loitering is you standing still, so you ain't have to stand still no more niggas or walk up and down the block when you was pitching. So now it was called wandering and remaining. Jesus. Yeah. Some of them charges be lies. I've never sent terroristic threats to anybody. come on man. Oh. Oh wait. You know terroristic threats.


Huh? Do you know what's considered terroristic threats? I learned. Oh okay. I bet I think they wrong. That's not right. Anytime they said one of us did it. I ain't the only one up here. Oh man, I never did that. Y'all, you there are you one? I get You right back in your mouth. I never did that. Fuck you talking about Nigga terroristic threats. That sounds gruesome. Yeah, that's all I, I was not doing that. I was not a terrorist. What is that? What a terrorist terroristic, terroristic threat is to be found guilty of terroristic threats. The prosecutor must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt that sir, one, the accused made a threat, threatening to kill someone.


Cool. I'm there for that. So business, the threat was to commit a violent offense and or kill the facts. Okay. Three. What's the third? This is the threat was made with the purpose of terrorizing or acted with reckless disregard of the risk that third parties would react in this manner. That's the cap I thought long and hard. So basically like a bomb. It wasn't reckless. No, no, no. It's saying I don't, I thinking how they, would you say the last part how they would react, right. That the threat was made not killed with the purpose of terrorizing or acted with reckless disregard of the risk that third parties would react in this manner. That one is capped. Who's the third party? My shit. You made the threat to the smack E.


Fuck you talking about? I thought that's the second party. The jokey. I thought that's the party. If I made the threat, it was well thought out. It wasn't just some random act. That brings me back to the joke my man said about, about why do people get more time for premeditated murder when the guy that's just going outside that killed somebody and had no plans of doing That is the real monster. I was thought out's true. No, no, that that's not the other way around. Other way is the monster. Are you kidding me? The fact that you fought, weighed the consequences and still did it, Joe, me, you are the monster. Yeah. Somebody could get in an argument and now off of an emotional impulse. That's passion. You could do some shit Yeah, man.


No, it's not. No nigga. And calculated It is and diabolical with it. That's the cuckoo clock. No, that's the decent human being. No nigga ain't planted decent is a stretch. But I could not disagree more with Joe. Disagree nigga. Have you have you? Let's, because this, wait, how many people here have thought about killing somebody? Put your hand up, nigga. Tia, put your hand up high, nigga. Fuck you. Talk about just thought. Thought. Okay, cool. Just like now. When you start to set it in, in motion, when you start, plan it in motion. Let's, it takes you two. No, no, no. Stop for a second. Stop a second. Premeditated. The three of y'all that raised your hand, why y'all ain't do it? Well, morally it's wrong to commit murder.


So right there, I'm not a murder. That was Unbelievable. I did not believe A, but I'm just saying right there, the fact that you had thought about it, but then you, you didn't go through with it. You're right. That separates you from that fucking, she didn't wanna go. There was one particular person. Morals did not play a role. It was, I don't think I'd be able to get away with it. And that's the only reason that it's, again, that's the only thing that stopped me. The fact that you stopped yourself was the point. That's what I'm saying. Y'all, y'all all have thought about It, but didn't. It's self-preservation that made stop. I mean, sure. There should be a difference between if you can't control your emotions and you murder someone off a fucking argument, or if you drew out a fucking B blueprint. I, that's disagree.


I totally disagree. I think putting all that nigga into it makes you even sicker. See, even y'all saying can't control your emotions in the argument. I disagree with the person. That is planning this crime. Put a lot of thought into this. Thinks that he has a, thinks that they have a reason to do this, is trying not to get caught. It is a very meticulous thing, so we disagree with the action because it's wrong. But he's moving methodically. No, I'm talking about the, I don't wanna be at acne and the dude in front of me who did not plan on killing somebody this morning just pull some shit out and starts busting that guy's a cycle.


Get him outta here. That's What, that's the guy About time out. But the person that sat in their house had the maps open. He's not psycho. He, he justified killing these people in his own mind already. Yeah, he already came to check, he already justified why It is okay to kill these people to him. And he thought about it, lined it up and did all of that shit. Okay. So let, I have him way less psycho. Whoa. Okay. So let me ask you that Than to crash out. So At least he's reliable. So what's your thoughts about He's nuts. Yo, y'all saying I'm nuts and I don't I get your point. No, I get your point. Wait, y'all saying I'm nuts and I don't, I don't like it on the pod because back to my, some of y'all here know people that, that what, what's on that Unli?


Yeah. A bunch of them. Oh yeah. Yeah. I knows those people that y'all are friends and cordial with. Nigga's crazy. Don't wake up and just go out and kill somebody. That's not true. No, but the people that I, I know that have done that that far. Not the people that I know that have done that premeditated. I No, I know they Got it in them. I think everybody has it in them. Alright. Some go out and do that. No, no. That's not true. No. Everybody Got it in them. That's not true. Everybody does have it in them. Yeah. Everybody have murder in everybody has it. And whether you find it in yourself is something No, no, no, no. Listen, some niggas I don't agree with that. The door opened a little earlier than others. What I'm saying, some niggas open the door, get, get out, get out a little fast.


Yeah. Yeah. Because murder is, because murder is murder. And then there's self-defense. There's some people that would never be able to do anything, you know, unless their lives were like in complete and total jeopardy. And then That is self-defense. That's not Murder harm. Somebody harm your children, you could go looking for them. That's murder. And there's a lot of stories I have. I have difficulty with that. Yeah. I'm done. Yeah. I have difficulty with that notion. I'm done withdrawal. I seen a doc where you got a complain dude, the people he was murdering, he was transporting them a hundred miles away to the forest and digging up a grave and pushing them in there and lighting them on fire and then staying there until everything dissolved.


He did that 10 times and all I could think watching that was, wow. He's responsible, diligent. He's, he's diligent. Thorough. He's, yeah. What he's committed. Not only is he committed, but he's smart enough to have thought about how he could escape this and what a genius little plan that he came up with. Well, he got caught though. I Yeah, he got caught. Caught. I still think that's different from somebody going to Rockefeller Center just and losing it. Losing it and just fucking yeah. Nah, nah, nah. I'm not real with that. Anyway, we can move on. Yeah, I think we, we can We on equally as fucking yo none of us here are, he's committed Murderers.


You, you, he's, he need to be committed. The what are you talking about that too? I don't Like That you do that because the people that you know that have done that, you ju you the nigga need to be committed too. I, I'm not saying that I'm not totally against, I mean, some of nigga I look, I just make sure I stay on. They good side. I curse the niggas out like everybody else. But what I'm saying is, fam, it's different. Alright. You got in a fight in the club, right Dude, you walk into the smoke break, a nigga punches you in the face. Let's say you in another state and you had it on, you leak right. And you had it on you and nigga punch you in the face. He with four niggas. Right?


And they commence to jumping you and you let one of them niggas have it. You didn't. But why, why would I let 'em have it? They need more than four. Stop. I'm not stomp. I fought four niggas before. I didn't tell you. You didn't however much. Lemme tell you something. It's a difference in four niggas and four niggas. Some niggas is professional. I might have fought five niggas when Imani and them was smoking hookah in there and took too long to come outside. Look, I fought a bunch of niggas. I ain't gonna see that many people and be like, listen, I'm alright. I gotta kill one of y'all. I, I don't have that in. I'm, I'm just still, alright, cool. I'm just giving you a scenario. Let's play out the scenario. Let's just say they getting you good. 'cause it's jumpers. I'm on the ground. Yeah. It is jumpers and jumpers. Oh, fetal position.


Yeah. That, that I'm cover my head. No, you got ribs showing that feet. I don't, I don't wanna kill nobody. That cool. What I'm saying is this, hold up. You taking me off my point, my point is this, you had it on you. The nigga start jumping you and you let one go. Right? That's a total different scenario than you sitting in your house waiting for somebody meticulously organizing, playing this whole show. This thing you are saying the the, the first one, I think they're both guilty of murder. Well one is, one is self-defense. So I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about a crash out. That is, that's on the news. Every It is It is on the news every morning. You just mean a nigga walking target and ah, blah. There's a guy right now running around the city just stabbing people old stabbing people. Slashing people. Yeah.


That's, no, he should go. He should go. He's gotta go here. I'm with you. He should go Now the guy that's going up and stabbing the people that owe him a lot of money, reasonably justifiable. He gave him a chance to pay it. Hey yo, what's wrong with you? Yo beat his ass on a hill dog. A few down the hill one time He ain't paid the crazy nun house nigga was running around killing all the homeless people in the city with a pipe hitting them in pipe. Yeah. That guy should be under the ground. And that's not premeditate, that's premeditated Joe. No, that was not premeditate. Would he? Not once I, once I do this one or two times, I know him over there sleeping on the ground on the great and walking around with a pipe. Wow. Yes. Yeah. That's premeditated. You have a pipe on you for the sole purpose of cracking niggas, hitting somebody.


Maybe. I don't know what premeditated means means I thought about, about plan this. When you left the house, you knew what that pipe was for. Clock nigga, I'm gonna go do some murdering. You think he had the pipe in the house? No, no. I'm saying when you left the house and you had the pipe on you, he left the house to go murdering. Yeah. You, you walking out the street twirling the pipe. Like, wait till I catch me a nigga sleeping. Literally I didn't have him as a premeditated murderer. That's pre, you think he justly had a pipe on him? I think when you're killing homeless people, he's premeditated that part. I think he found a pipe he liked. Yo, when I used to move, he carried the pipe around. Yo, yo, this is, I don't wanna talk to them.


This is Ryan got good leverage. When I was young, I used to save my favorite twig. Shut the fuck up. But you didn't Purpose. Purpose. Nobody. Purpose with it. Purpose for the purpose of switch. For what purpose? Because I ain't gonna find another twig like this. This is a nice, do what you need to do, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's the purpose of the twig? I was building clubhouses. I know. Oh, that's nice. So you preemptively had a purpose for the twig. So when you find that nice, you with a nice pipe that got the, the little hook on it. This one ain't too hard. This one cut right through the wind. Purpose. Purpose with intent. Let look. The intention of going murder. I'm looking up premeditated and then I'm moving on.


I think a non premeditated murder would be someone steps on your shoe in the club and you pull out and fucking an argument get into a fight and then a knife gets pulled out. But old boy was just walking around and if he saw a homeless person, he killed him. He, that's not normal. People don't do that. Also not premeditate. Pre It is if I sit there and say, yo look person, and I see I'm killing them, it's, that's premeditated. It's literally just waiting for the, the person. It's literally not You. Right. It is not in the moment. Alright. You. all Right. Okay. Okay. It is one little sentence done deliberately. Yes. Yo, he was deliberately killing. Yeah.


Planning a forethought. Alright. Anyway. Thank, you sorry about that. Sorry you guys. I'm proud of you. Yo. Yeah. Word. That's my new thing. I'm proud of you. I Like, That learning God. Acceptance.

Was he, was he, was he a little, was he a little Skittle? No. Oh no. Sorry. Is is Lyle the younger one? I can't keep straight. Which One was gay?


The younger one. So that's, So that's not the one that was married. That's Lyle. So Eric wasn't Sitting? Yes. Tell her Ish because I told her before one of 'em niggas was gay. Niggas are cheating in Prison. Okay. That was right. It is Lyle. Yeah, they, they wasn't gay. It was assaulted the younger brother. It's, it was alluded to that he Mel was Yes. And the Show showed the nigga watching nigga in the shallow, you, you've heard of women getting pregnant in jail. Right. And prison guards. And You've been in jail and prisoners. Prisoners got pregnant because the dog is fucking them. Yeah. Guards. Do you think that the men in jail are unable to cheat?


Or do you think that's when a nigga goes to jail? They swag just go away when they walk in the bar? No, that's not it. But I, They still attractive. They still got a mouth. No, here's the thing. Okay, listen, Look, they still got a mouth in jail. That's crazy. And what are they doing with said mouth? It was aggressive nigga talking. Oh, talking. So the same way a nigga could make a girl on the street start to like them, when they talking to the CO in the jail, she started liking the nigga too. It wasn't a co I'm just giving you, lemme ask a question. It was the seamstress. Hey Mel, lemme ask you a question. If it's prison stuff. Yeah. When you were the pen pal for the prisoners. Oh, was it your Married? I feel a shot coming. No, no. Of them niggas Had gang, some of niggas could have been married. Well that's Oh Shit.


We're not I didn Take that shit out. Fuck that Fuck that. No, we are not, we are not creating that narrative. Fuck y'all Take that out. But you get what I'm Saying. And you start get something going with that person. Your visit day is Tuesday. Okay. So maybe your visit day Tuesday. Okay. So maybe I don't understand the way like how some prisoners will end up with Get Off Me will end up with conjugal visits and others don't. I don't know how that whole thing works because he got married to his wife while he was in prison. He's been there for 34 years.


He got married to her 20 years ago. Okay, you guys. So maybe I'm not really understanding by way of, you know, how that's been written up. What constitutes his cheating here? But she, No, he could have fucked another woman Or he could have fucked this Or he could have fucked a dude or he could have fucked No, they say who It is who cheat he cheated with. It was a Woman? Yes. Okay. And she's like some, some other chick from outside the jail. She does not work in the jail. Oh, okay. She's part It is my wife. So he had A Mel Pen pal. Mel, be oblivious on your own time please Mel. It happens, man. The game Men can cheat. Okay, what's going on When we On, okay, it said Lyle reportedly met Millie earlier this year in a Facebook group that was dedicated to Lyle, which was ironically Pen created by Lyle's White Foot.


That's your bag. Oh Shit. The pen pal bag. I mean not, not Millie's profile caught his attention. So he messaged her under an alias name, blah blah blah blah blah. So then she started to come to visit him. I Just said one thing, one thing you gotta give Mel credit for is that she's dedicated for women's rights. Even if a nigga in jail, you don't feel bad for the nigga in jail. You feel bad that he cheated on his wife. So what nigga been down for 34 years And I'm arguing that's not even cheating. I never met that bitch. Yeah, No they have now she came. No, she was coming to the jail. She came do the Jail. Okay. Sitting on his lap and shit. That, that, that Don't count. You know much how we take pictures and you know what I'm saying? Hi man, I don't, okay. Hey Whatever. I'm just, I said this every Right. It's just interesting Nigga.

I'm like, yo, why is my son not answering the phone? Then he answers. So I'm talking like, what up kid, my son? Yeah, you like what up kid out because and we and we figured it out. We figured it out.

And now he's just like Jojo Joe, Joe, Joe. It's me. It's not your son. How to blocked Joe?


How to block your what Trey? Not my son but Tre as the contact Tray in brackets. Yeah, my son is in here now. Like I dunno man, very just change it back. It is embarrassing. Once you change it back, it'll stick. Show me how to turn that shit Off ice. I got you man. Let's see, let's see, let's see. What else do I have here? Dr. J is back. Hayden. Oh, who you saying though? So they were floating the idea they were floating around the idea of League-wide retirement for Kobe number, number of retirement. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Which one? 24 or both? I don't know. They had to go up in, in every arena Got it.


And the only other person that got to get that was Bill Russell. Okay. Okay. Insert Dr. J saying I do not think that Kobe Bryant should have a league-wide jersey retirement and the great Bill Russell, respectfully Kobe is not on that planet. That's eight. But now Dr. J has a history of hating on for sure current players and and modern day fuck is Dr. Ball. Don't do that. He's Dr. J still. I, I shut up still Dr. Jade. I be shit on Dr. J too sometimes, nigga. It's Kobe Bryant bro. Why would he say that Kobe is not on Bill Russell's level?


Because he played back in the day with Bill Russell. That's the only reason. No, That's not why. That's not why because Bill Russell statistically, and with the accolades, accomplishment, accolades and off the court Bill Russell was a man of the people. He was a civil rights guy. He did a lot of shit off the court. That Pell, most today's athletes Pell in comparison to he has like 11 championships. 12 championships. But off the court too. Like his off the court shit was just as monumentous. But, but Kobe's life got cut short right at the moment where he could have become what Bill Russell became outside of the arena. So, so Dr. J's thing is you didn't do it. Yeah, it don't matter matter. Why to do It is different. My thing is, Kobe Bryant was such a great basketball player and devoted as much, arguably from the professionals.


His work ethic was something that they'd never seen before. So I just think that his greatness should be saluted. I just think be, I just think Kobe was so devoted to basketball, not just NBA, like even how he was doing for with his women's basketball overseas. Basketball overseas. Like Kobe just gave his life for basketball. So I'm not mad at the, the league wide retirement. I agree with that as well, neither. I agree with you. Yeah. Yeah. I can't be mad at it. I was about to say, do I really wanna see the Kobe jersey hanging up in the garden? But anytime Kobe got to the garden it was 50 and better. But is Yeah, but did is that what It is like? Does it constitute your jersey being hung up or nobody ever on the Knicks to Celtics the whoever could wear the number 24.


No, your Jersey goes back. Your actual jersey goes up. So it's a Bill Russell jersey in every stadium. Yes. I never noticed. Oh okay. I thought it was like the, like the Jackie Robinson thing where nobody could number. Yeah, that's what I thought. But I didn't know that. Rest in peace. Kobe. Yeah. Word. Chill out, rest in peace to the bean. Stop hating. Chill out. Not the old niggas gonna hate Dr. J. Not having the J is still one of the funniest things in the world. Dr. Layup. The word J wasn't around then. It is no footage of Dr. J ever. Shoot. Shoot. Never. You've never seen it. I've never seen it. That's funny. Dr. J every any highlight. Never Dr.

Everybody just could say that. Then who's gonna say the other one? Yo. LDE. Here it's a little, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see. Ocean Ass Niggas. We can get to Bitcoin in a second.


I wanna get back to this Kendrick because the internet is Interneting. So let's see here. He to look over there, Kendrick responds to Lil Wayne and Super Bowl controversy on whacked out Mutuals saying murals. Oh this says Mutuals murals. I used to bump the Carter three. The irony, I think my hard work, let Lil Wayne down got the Super Bowl and NA's the only one Congratulate me. All these niggas agitated. I'm just glad it's on their faces. Is that Wayne? This? No, I wouldn't call it this. I no, I wouldn't call it a Wayne. This? Yeah, yeah, yeah I would. Well he was agitated and I'm glad I could see. And now I gotta play cool with if you got a problem with that and you're showing it, cool.


I'm glad I can see it now. Dis. I used to bump Carter three. We all did. I know He bumped a bunch of albums. Alright, Sorry. Wayne Dis Kendrick named his album after one of the hardest cars of all time. The 1987 Buick GNX. The Grand National GNX also beat the Ferrari in the quarter mile run by 0.3 seconds. The only car that was able to challenge the GNX at the time was the Lamborghini count. Hmm. This car was hard though. I ain't gonna hold you.


Lemme See. That car was hard. Yeah, That's it. Okay. Yeah, It's gonna be a lot of that all weekend. Yeah. Yeah. Deep dives into it. Yeah. Fucking making Meanings outta shit that Kendrick ain't even make, you know. So you saying you know it's a 14th planet. You know what I mean? It's a 14th planet, but really What that means is Called GNX because the equilibrium of the Vortex X Stands for Existential. You saying you saw an interesting tweet from some of the West Coast niggas talking about No, I ain't seeing a tweet. I got a text message that said This ain't, this ain't, and this ain't even an album.


I don't know what that means. Where if it's might be a double. Yeah, it could be something else coming or he was working on something else. This ain't that. This could be a teaser, a appetizer. I don't know man. This is a fucking album. This album. No, this ain't the album That's gonna drop around Super Bowl time. No, not not, no. Just could be, could have said one song. He has something bigger. Paul's coming. This ain't that. I don't, again, I don't, when the cryptic shit start, I just be like, all right. Peace It is year cryptic shit. Yeah. Like all y'all Got it. Yo yo. But this ain't even an album. All Right. Maybe Not. Yeah. But let's entertain it for a little bit because that's what we do. Oh, you know how some artists will drop the mix tape first and then the album come later?


Yeah, I get that. Meaning the album. That's all I get that. And it always sounds cheap. This sounds, what has he ever done that sounded cheap. Him nothing. So this wouldn't apply there anyway. Could he possibly dropped? He had throwaways. That didn't sound cheap. I do think that he did a lot more work than 45 minutes of music. Yeah, I believe that. But ready to release. Why not? Nigga? I've been quiet and geared up. They don't come outside. Y'all don't know what? He could have three more albums. I didn come outside, but J Coles, I mean it was in a rap, but J Cole said, I'm fully loaded. I could drop three classics right now or two classics, whatever he said.


So some of these dudes have works in the stash. That could go, that could be him saying that about this. He got something else coming and he don't seem to be the most social nigga. Yeah. So I'm in the studio. He might be a studio rap. I'm pretty sure he Is. You get what I'm saying? Yo. What if he drops after the Drake shit? I'm sure every producer and they mother was throwing him beats Nigga. Not just that. We just saw when Future of Metro dropped, we don't trust you. We didn't know they was coming right back. What? We still don't trust you. Yeah, true. He could come back with another joint. He did a double album. Okay, I'm not gonna give you the double at the same time. I'm gonna give you this one and then in a couple weeks or whatever the case may be. Now I'm gonna give you the other one all before Super Bowl.


Or maybe it was saved the other one for Super Bowl. I don't know man. I'm just no way to tell what's in this fucking, you can't, you can never tell. It is five foot six niggas brain. Sure. Napoleon complex nigga. I don't put it past him though. I don't either, bro. With him you can't, you you can really, you can't guess anything. You don't know what to expect from him. And no leaks in the camp. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Do we take anything from not like us not being on this project? No, I Don't. No. Well, yes and no. I think that it's, I'm moving past This shit. Them records came out that way for a reason.


Those are just drops over here. Here you go. Now granted, it grew on, it grew to be what it was. Grammy nominated all these things. It's, it's probably the rap song of the year. It is, But that served a purpose. I dropped it over here. I'm, It sounds like it would've fit right in on this but, and it's gonna be on mine. I don't, I don't have, I don't take nothing from not like us or Euphoria or meet the ground, like just none of that. Those were standalone drops over there for that reason. Now I'm here. Album time concise. One thing about Kendrick, his albums are always concise.


Everything fits, everything has a purpose. I Think he also looks for longevity in his projects. And if you put something that was very this year, the battle between him and Drake on a project it 10 years from now, you might not want to hear not like us. And He don't Kendrick The context of album. And Kendrick never really came off as playing those industry games. Yeah. Trying to Draw the numbers up. Yeah. So if I throw this album on there, it looks like I'm doing, if I throw this song on there, it looks literally like I'm doing that. I'm playing the number game. Yeah. I wanna hear this again. Thank. You just for a second.


I wanna see, yo, I've had the way home. I ain't gonna hold you. I would've tried to get the clearance for Pac Talking Burning Who I used to every Not to bring up Drake. Who do y'all think, did the PAC flow better? What? Who do y'all think? Did the Pac flow better? Kendrick did the harder Well I was gonna say it's different. Pac flows. Yeah. It is so, It is not like he stuck to one. I I think Drake on, what was that? Tailormade that the shit where said Pac. Pac already know what time in the best podcast in the Worldpac out his out. So exactly Pac know. I'm going with that one. I gotta give that one To at You. right?


Easy. Right. Easy. We so biased. Right? Yo eat what that mean? Yo, this might come on in a strip club tonight. I really need to grow. Yo. Yo, I'm gonna grow up one of those things. Oh you're not. No. For real. Why it has to happen. No you're not. It has to happen. Why? Just little first listen this in the intro.


This in track. This track one Jimmy. Huh? 11 Oh in the heart. Yeah. Of fame old I recollec isolation. I was four years old. Truth be told, I've been pat in myself trying to never get the willing effect about the judgment day. I did pass life aggression last year when it fucked me up. We incarnated on this earth for plus body ain the body lesson, not the lesson. Let's take it back to Michigan in 1947. My father kicked me out the, because I wouldn't listen to him. I didn care about his influence play guitar level the most talented.


But I had Rebel and, And if he puts out another album, right? Like I love Yo, y'all don't see what he doing. He not talking about himself. No. He's somebody. Yeah, I get that. I haven't figured out who It is yet. But I think it's the internet will tell us. I think it's, at first I thought it was Billie Holiday at first I thought it was Billie Holiday. I think it's a woman who we talking about. But go ahead. I'm not trying to decrypt it until later. Yeah, yeah. You gotta do This shit. Yeah, I gotta go. I a Glass of red wine and a doobie and some loud speakers. Yeah. I gotta go see crisscross applesauce, some candles. Yeah man, right now I'm just enjoying tune. But God damn Sunset searching for my place in the world where my guitar for my hip.


That's the story young for. I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect. s that fell to they feet. So many Tocar Elvis Because, because it this one he talk about a man, the other one's a woman. Yeah. If you are a rap genius, man, what the fuck you doing over there? How you unpacking shit so fast, nigga? I could hear, I listen to Words Beyond Bop to the beat like everybody else. I don't know who Somebody from Michigan.


Elvis from Michigan? No, no, he said Michigan. I Think that was from Memphis. He said Michigan. I, I went on rap. I went on Rap Genius and you know, kicked 1947. They were saying that Chuck Berry, that was the year that Michigan went undefeated. Oh. So that's a reach. Chuck Berry's not from Michigan School, I'm guessing he said something about a guitar holding a guitar by his hip. I want listen, being a distraction This shit. We'll Just wait until this is a homework assignment bro. I for sure. I'm ready to go lock in. Yeah, me too. Can't do This shit while pot. Yeah. Why? No, I'm done with Potting. Listen, This shit is over This shit. I opened my phone for a second. Niggas like, I know Joe's gotta get about five hours. No. you don't shit No. you Don listen this fucking album, you know.


Nah, I opened my Twitter one. I saw somebody say, yo, we need an emergency pod. I'm like, eh, we caught. Yeah, he served it up for us. Real, real quick. Clarissa Shields and Amanda Serrano been going back and forth on Twitter. Okay. Clarissa Shields gotta stop. Yeah. Clarissa Clarissa's saying that she, I guess apparently she hit up Cam and, and and told Cam that they're trying to rewrite history. That she's her match was the one that broke all women's boxing record. But at the end of the day, you know Amanda Serrano, they fought in front of like what, 60 million viewers? Yeah. And Clarissa Shield claim is that they didn't tune in for you guys. They tuned in for the main event.


She's wrong. Fuck. So she's wrong though. And a lot of people tuned in for them. Exactly. She's wrong that that mic fight ran late. It started late. Like we was up watching. And if we didn't see nothing else, we saw Amanda's fight with short headbutt shorty. Big head bitch. Yeah. With Katie. With Katie. Nah, I wanna put some respect on her name too. 'cause they saying that that girl gets busy. Yeah. But I only know her from the fight that I saw. Yes. And that the head is big as hell and a headbutt would hurt somebody. Yeah. The thing is, I did follow that Amanda girl. Me too. Yeah man. I followed her. She followed up. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Amanda. Amanda shout out to them. I mean she's amazing. Here's, here's the thing though, the thing is that you know Amanda and Jordan, them they really from outside. They're from where we from Brooklyn You know what I mean. And I, I, I don't want it to turn into a black and Puerto Rican thing because that's where it's going.


You know Clarissa and some people that's behind her. Not behind her, but some people in the spaces. But saying that, yo, they don't wanna see a dark-skinned woman be at the, the height of, or the face of boxing and all this stuff. And I don't know why it's going that direction. You know what I'm saying? So I don't like it. Oh my You know what I mean. Shout out to Clarissa Shields. But I don't like, I think, I think that's very, that's low hanging fruit. Like I gotta say, you know that angle Amanda put on a fucking clinic, she whooped ass. She got robbed twice. And we gonna see the third fucking match if, if it happens. And on top of that, I think it's gonna break more records. I think women, she putting off a woman boxing and I think that you should just, or fight, get in the ring. I know that they different weights but hopefully they can meet in the middle. I don't know. I've been listening to the show All week. Anybody that Amanda fight, if she go outside and fight a nigga in the street, I'm watching anybody that she fight, I'm watching She made a fan nigga.

I, but I I, Messed, Up. I started, I but I I Messed Up. I in love with not what I wanted. I I, I mean yeah we all do Check this.


I mean we started out respectable which is a good time but it opened my mind when she was bisexual and now I'm confused as I stay at the ceiling while laying in the bed with you or sense is like a vegetable. You the type of chick that I tell my niggas I never do supposed to be the pop off top me off a time she got dropped off somewhere in there. All morals got lost looking like assault without a weapon. Shorty with a guard down And me without protection was told that you can't tame a hoe. But if you should try and get denied you shouldn't blame a hoe. That's the only game she know. But I keep her poker fix with all the shit that I hear about her. I'd be ashamed if niggas knew that I really cared about her. Started out respectable, which is a good time to open my mind when she was that flexible changed the whole set of rules.


Now instead of court and short of your cap, I let her stay and honestly she might be the best mistake I ever Made. I Messed Up, I Love it And That is I Messed Up new old music by Imani and Joe off of songs about her one Cool am Mind a fuck up tradition.
