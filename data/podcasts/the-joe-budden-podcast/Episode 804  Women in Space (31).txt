It is kind of a, this guy who done it. There's a dog in the closet bro. This is who done it all over the place. Yeah. They talk last. The dog was in the closet. The dog was in the closet. Yeah. But why? Gene had Come on. But everybody in a different room. Yeah. Really? Gene in the kitchen. Dog in the closet and wife. Wife In the bathroom. Yeah, I got it. Come on, let's Hear it. Okay. Authorities are investigating the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa.


And their bodies were after their bodies were found under suspicious circumstances while foul play was not initially suspected, the causes of death remain unconfirmed. Maintenance workers discovered the couple's bodies days after they had passed. That's crazy. Crazy. Her, her body was found in a bathroom with a space heater near her head alongside an open bottle of prescription pills and scattered pills on the counter. Their dead dog was also found in a bathroom closet though two other dogs were found safe elsewhere in the house. Hackman's body was found in another room near the kitchen with a deputy suggesting he may have collapsed unexpectedly. The front door was unlocked but there were no signs of forced entry or theft. Investigators have ruled out carbon monoxide or natural gas leaks as potential causes of death.


And the investigating is ongoing. That was what was rumored in the beginning. But I was gonna say apparently that's not what It Is now. Once you told me the dog in the closet, I'm like Weird. Super weird. Yeah. I hate some like unsolved mystery station Shit. And I watched way too many of these shows. Yeah. All of y'all brain is fucking with y'all. I know it. Y'all can't wait for 12 years. I wonder Where other dogs was. 'cause one thing I could think 12 Years this dog could be out in in two months. Now Hulu's, Hulu gonna have one out tonight. Impact. Impact. Yep. Hulu Don't play no more. They come out the same day. What were you gonna say? Parks about the other two dogs? I wonder where they were 'cause I could see if it was a suicide situation. You lock the dogs up so they don't Eat you. I didn't wanna say it but yeah.


Yeah. Because if you leave dogs unattended they will And you're dead. They will eat. You're dead. Yeah. The smell you're meat. If we doing a double suicide then hold my hand. That part though. Yeah. We On in the bed together in the kitchen We used, I'm starting to think right? 'cause remember there was a video that came out of, of Gene Hackman walking out of Disparage his name. No, no, no. Disparaging his name. No, there was, he was just, Let's start with recipes. She had course. Absolutely. Legend And his wife. And his wife and his And the dog. The dog And The dog. I'm sure the dog was legendary as well. Anyway, Period with dog lovers up here in Facts. I, I'm not saying anything saying Here's the German Shepherd.


Yeah I have one. He wanted to lay low, he just wanted to live his life. And I remember a lot of people were attacking the person that was recording him and exposing him where they were. That's just something that stuck out to me. I remember that was in the news like earlier last year he was coming out of a gas station and they were saying that, you know, he had to say, you know, he wore the outfit for a week straight. Some shit like that. And I remember a lot of people were attacking the person that recorded that and said yo, let him live his life. You know, let him mind his business. So it's just something that stuck out to me. That's it. Okay. I don't remember that but yeah, He's like 90 something right? Yeah, he was like 95. Yeah, I remember he was 90 something. Was he that Old? Yeah. Hell yeah. Yes. Dang.


She was like 68. He was 95. Dunno how old the dog was though. No, I don Dunno. How does the whole house End up in different rooms And dead without a sign of the murder? That feels like a poisoning or something. That took a minute and everyone was just, where they It is be nice. I'm saying there's no gunshots. There's no stab wounds. There's no sign of, They said they fell unexpectedly. They looked like they fell unexpectedly. And then the scattered pills that could be dressed up to make it look a certain way Or it could just be she was taking her medicine and fell out in shit. Collapsed. And then the Heat, the heater by, but the heater by her head, she fell by the heater. But That could just be there. A heater in the bathroom was cold there or some shit.


Yeah. Electrocuted. Yeah. Nah, shit. Could have been, it could have been a bunch of Shit. Yeah. You never know. I feel like I should be better at this. Yeah, yeah. Old Don't have that much info. You don't have how much? But they said that the heater was moved. That's what they said when I read it. Oh really? Yeah, like things were being placed somewhere. Oh. So that's what they said. So maybe I think I might have been looking for something. So wait, you're saying that the heater was not there and it was placed there after the fact? That's what They were saying. Yes. That's what I heard. Well if that's the reason why somebody would do something like that is because they wanna speed up the rate of de decomposition because so to get rid of like forensic evidence, I thought Being, I thought being that's why they fuck with temperatures.


We learned few things every once in They try to sleep with us man. Forensic cranny guy and talk that shit. Yeah. But yeah, it's, I mean that's possible. But who knows? I'm going with poisoning though. Sudden collapses different rooms so it doesn't feel, yeah, it feels like they took some shit and didn't know. We'll see The dog is weird. This is fucking I I, my my first guess was carbonide. Yeah that was my guess. That was my first guess. But That was everybody's first. Yeah guess I feel like that's gotta be watch Some doc with us man. Nah, I'm good nigga. Talking about yo they put the heater next to you to speed up the decompensation to get rid of the Forensic.


I'm good dog. I'd like to know who But if that was the case then they would leave the dogs out. I maybe, possibly. Yeah. Yeah that's true. Well no because not necessarily the dog might just start gnawing on your ankle and it doesn't get rid of like, I don't know, whatever. Maybe it's, maybe it's a poison that just your body metabolizes really quickly. Shit. Or like it just Leaves your breaking back something. Yeah. I forgot what it was called. One sucks an Ole or I would like to know who died first. 'cause I don't believe that everybody just dropped dead at the same time. Yeah. That's Not to sound insensitive. I'd like to know who was gone first, But if somebody passed out or if somebody passed away and the other person sees them, you don't think they call 9 1 1?


Yeah, I would think so. Especially if jean Passed away first, then the wife should call 9 1 1 Or vice versa. I'm not assuming that somebody saw the other person. Mm. I don't know that part to be factual. So I'm not assuming that. I just wanna know who died First. The dog in the closet is what makes it weird I think. And Also especially and also if they were poisoned, how did the dog get poisoned? You know what I'm saying? So it's like ate some of The food, been in the food and they gave you scraps Type shit. Yeah. I mean like that's a possibility but, but the Dog in the closet is weird 'cause that seems intentional. Very. Yeah. That's the part that stand out or the dog that was the safe little space Could be I guess because it might not have been a locked closet.


It could have just been an open door dog went in there. And what I don listen with all due respect to the police officers or whoever that whoever that is that reported, all of these people have died. Nothing is suspicious. Like that's how it went out. Yeah. First yeah went out. We no foul play dog. What are you talking about? No foul play. Everything about this says suspicious. Even if it ain't you, you it, it shouldn't be on you to just report off rip no signs of foul play. Oh then you ain't do your job. They Say no you know no Forced entry. You not finished looking at something. Think That's what Forced entry, no forced entry basis because the door was unlocked.


Man don't say nothing about foul playing until I some toxicology reports coming back. Yeah, I agree. You need to do a little more than looking around perusing the room like I do to a hotel room before I'm checking out from lost items. Like what are we talking about here? That was nuts. Like nothing. And none of us was like all right well that's how we got the carbon monoxide. Right. When you report there's nothing suspicious. Oh okay. The hair, the the shit Them but but to them they might view nothing suspicious as it don't look like a robbery occurred. It's not shit knocked all over the place. Gun, nothing like that. Yeah. So they might be like you can't Talk about a robbery until we start getting doing intrinsic bank, bank accounting, auditing. I get you. Yeah we need to look at accounts.


What came in, phone calls that was made. We need to start tracing the last six months of phone calls and shit. We gotta do before you could say hey nothing suspicious. The crazy Shit too is they said that they had appeared to have been deceased for like two weeks. Mummification Had begun mummification. Wow. The maintenance worker said they ain't seen him in two weeks. So that's what made 'em check. Yeah. Oh damn. Well hopefully they lived in like a fairly residential neighborhood 'cause everybody's got a ring camera. True. You know maybe they had some So I'm, I'm anticipating that coming out. If, if they in fact lived around cameras so anybody could see Cummings and goings like from maybe two weeks ago.

Is she, is she? Yeah she's spilling some tea but that's not we come on. What do we start with? Wait, what nigga we started nigga. What you, what else we starting with? We can't just, this nigga done took us down Murder lane. Tell what are we starting? Don't do Gene Hackman.


No rest in peace. Gene Hackman. Gene Hackman is is one of them. Don't that please. Joking around Academy Award winner. Yes, he's Him. He is. He is him. He been Some amazing films. Yes, I'm with you. Yes. Rest in peace. He's been in some amazing films and I ain't gonna lie, his b and C movie shit. Fire ain't sweet either. Nah. Yeah, he, It ain't sweet either. He tough. He's one of them The dog, the god damn. It's poison. That's what, Gotta buy some of that shit and tell Erickson to get out of there. You gonna say Erickson?


Hey Ericsson, get out for five minutes. Yo. Are you fucking crazy? Nigga said, I'm only gonna say that. Keep the footage crazy. Yo. What's we not doing a big deep dive here. I just feel like it's appropriate following our Gene Hackman segment season finale of Paradise is coming up. Oh boy. Is everybody caught up? Yes. Yes. Almost. So let's give final predictions on who we think killed Cal. We don't need to do a deep dive. Let's just run it around really quick.


My options. I'm still not off the dad. I'm still not off the dad. Even though they say it's somebody that's never been down there before or up there. Wherever they are. I don't necessarily believe that. I also like, I think her name is Jill, Old girl. Mm. Which one old Girl. Jill is the one that was waving at the helicopter as it pulled off. That was my pick. The one that was asking Sterling K Brown. Yo, I got a daughter. I don't care about me. I been with you. They kept showing her, they kept showing us her asking for the favor too many times. Yeah. I feel like it has to be important or, or or To throw Off.


And and the black girl that killed the security guard that told Sterling, Hey, I'm getting on this shit. She killed him. I think when she was running off she said, I'll be back. Y'all go. I'll be back. Yeah. So I think that there might be a way for somebody to sneak into wherever they're going. Are you talking About the president's lover? Yes. Yes. No, she'd be too obvious. 'cause she No, he's talking about the The girl. I'm not talking about The president went with her. 'cause she obviously left on a later When they got on the flight. When they got on the plane, she stayed on the ground. Got it. Yes. And grabbed a gun to make sure they got away safely. Yes. Yes. So that means that she came after they did. So it might have been some other people that came with her.


Is that what you're saying? Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. I I'm with Jill. I think I got Jill and the dad Ex-wife That we've never seen Go ex-wife. You think it would be too obvious to be the one that, the security guard that killed Billy, like the silent assassin chick? Yeah, that's because She was at the house. Jane. Jane. That would be trash. I think that's way Too awkward. Yeah, that would be trash. And and she acts under Sinatra. You know who I'm not taking off the table. The wife. Which wife? Sterling K. Brown's wife.


Oh, She's not off the table for me. Huh? If she's alive and she's looking for her family and she find the place and now Sinatra is keeping the kids hostage or Kyle or, or maybe she mad at Kyle for not telling the husband that, Hey, Atlanta's about to be fucked up. I stole a car. I tried to get there. I couldn't, I'm not taking her off the table either. Right. Those are my guesses. Jill, the wife or the dad, But also Sinatra, right before the president died, he told Sinatra, I'm gonna blow this shit wide open. So that's why I thought that Jane might be a possibility. She was at the fucking house. She's a silent assassin and she plays innocent really well.


And she could have gotten the direct order from Sinatra. Well I, I believed Sinatra in saying I ain't kill him. I would've if because she told him, she definitely said he was about to get it. She was like, I didn't kill him because if he would've kept looking, I would've killed him. I, I killed Billy, but I didn't kill him. So that's why I'm, that, that's reason why I take calls. I believe that Then. I think it's the, I'm I'm still on the dad. We, we'll find out real soon. I'm watching the whole season over again soon as, because now I wanna see if I miss something. Soon as this finale airs, I'm, I'm going back to one. It's a few things that ain't tie into me yet, But somebody close it after y'all. Yeah. He he can close it. It might be the son because he, he was leaving like encrypted messages to the sun on, on a MP three.


You don't remember. He kept going the library. He was like making almost like a mix tape with songs. And I think the sun gonna hear some shit on those tapes that he might come back and pop 'em. Huh. I don't know. I don they they did a good job. 'cause it's still wild. That Last episode was episode seven was really good. Incredible. It was amazing. I cried. I didn't cry, but it was, It was good. It was Intense. It was Powerful. It was very intense. Yeah. Scary For sure. For sure. Great episode, bro. Alright. Alright. Enough. Alright. It feels good To cry during the show At the end. It does. I was looking for a cry was fighting, but it didn't come. It didn't come. I was fighting it, but then at the end it was like, oh God, what The fuck? Oh, What made you cry? I shot the shit outta your Boy came brown when he's talking to his wife on the phone and knowing that Yeah.


What's about to happen? Yeah. That was that. It was wrong. That was crazy. It was wrong. That was insane Because he, she's a smart one in the relationship. They're both smart, but she's a smart one. The Wife. Yeah. She's not, she's the wife and she worked. Yeah. All he could do for at least 90 seconds or what? I know they was on a time crunch, but it was a not, it was a long stretch where all he could say was, I love you so much. Oh Yeah. It was nothing else he could say. No. She was freaking it. On the other hand, he's looking At the screen. I know. Yeah. Fam, You know, like that. I'm squeezing mad words in there. I love you, but he's so amazing. Oh my god. Yo. Everything about life.


Fuck that. Yo, that's Crazy. Like when she started giving, I I wanna say the instructions for the kids or some shit. Yeah. Come on dog. One thing in that scene that got Oh, we close it. Go ahead. Close. Yeah. I'd have shot Sinatra. Yo not killed. I Said, I said the same thing thing. I would've popped the shit out. I said the same thing though. You gonna Talk. I've definitely at least tied her ass up. You She would've got shot. I was going to yo dog. She would've got, I said that shot before this episode came out. I, it wasn't even, I don't trust nothing. You saying you a snake pal, bro. Not just, I'm gonna figure it out. Okay. Now I know you got my kid. Whether my wife is alive or is alive or not. I'm shooting you. We got all the guns right. No you don't. We In a cave.


No you don't. We got, We, Jane has a gun. Oh, okay. Oh, that's true. That's true. Jane has a gun. Okay. Okay. It Is bad of us. One of her now, even if she's a hell, but We, we in a cave. But my thing is, we in a cave. So, and I got a squad now and we armed up. We'll go through this motherfucker, find whatever we gotta find. Well you are gonna talk In response to that. You may get your daughter killed. My response to that she was a hero. Yes.


I knew he was gonna say something inappropriate. Ain't gonna Never forget it because, because listen Won't lies you forever. Don't. Yo your girl, you, I'm definitely tying up Sinatra though. But wait, she got, I'm only saying this about the daughter because I told you not to leave your little brother. I told Your little dumb ass not to. I told you not to leave your brother. Not only did you leave the brother chasing some white dick, but you heard him giving the most important speech that's ever been given and you still got tricked And you walked away with the goofy. Yeah. So I would've definitely just been like, I don't think this is gonna go the way you want. Sinatra, I'm gonna tie you up. Actually you give me the daughter back and I wouldn't, I wouldn't even have known she had my daughter.


I'm not gonna hold her. I would've shot her. I would've shot her before we even got that information. You got at least papa in the ankle or so? Maybe I am a monster Foot shot. Bow Bow. A second one for good measure. No, it's true. Sorry. All right. Paradise. Season finale next week. I might stay up late for that one. I don't know.

But we're gonna talk politics that week. Your man is Wild. We should just play what Eric Adams had to say to the citizens of New York City. Yeah, I don't feel like it's right that I play it, but I mean, I guess, I guess if I must He set you up box. Did she? She set you up. Oh, it's in the group chat. Don't you worry about it. I know he Had press conference and he, he, he used a lot of colorful language, let's just say. Yeah. In describing his constituents. Jesus. This is a biblical moment.


You know, when Jesus was on the cross, he said, God, forgive them for they know not what they do. All these Negroes were asking me to step down. God forgive them. No, play that again. No. Play that again. So this is a biblical moment. Let's go Eric. You know when Jesus was on the cross, he said, God forgive them for they know not what they do. All these Negroes were asking me to step down. God forgive them.


Are you? Are you stupid? Hey listen, does anybody know where this, where what the audience was? What, what? Where was this? Oh, iBook. I thought you asked Baptist. Abian Baptist was piss was I feel like a room full of like stiff white people would've been like, what does he mean? Yeah. Yeah. But they were like, you better tell him that, That That's people that stand Johnson. We know who that is. Sister Johnson. Yeah. From the church with the big hat. Yeah. And the from C-C-C-A-M-E.


One of 'em churches, you know what I'm saying, came down there. You know, I think that's crazy. He just compared himself to Jesus. He compared himself to Jesus and then called us all stupid Negroes. Wow. You know, he trying to rub it him when he use words like Negroes. Yo, he just trying to, he ain't even say you people. Like he he Y'all partner y'all. For real. For real, for Real, for real. Yeah. Alright. Fuck it. I'll be on the other side. I know you are. I'll take the other side. What did he say wrong? We all are made in God's likeness. Okay. Okay. That's not what I think that meant meant, but, But okay, so I'm not, so if I'm not gonna stop my, my God body homeboy, when he start getting in his bag, why I'm gonna stop Eric Adams.


Some people walk to earth and do that whole comp of we are not 80% water. And you know, they get in their bag. I just let him go. Yeah. You can't. Oh yeah, I don would say that. So Eric Adams is doing that at a podium one. Who the fuck am I to say something? Okay. Two. I hear a clear tone change since Trump has ticking over. I was just About to say, yeah, He didn't sound like this before. No, no balls. He did not, he ain't have no balls like that. So Now that his man Is running shit like death row, any One of us would get up there and say, y'all got fucked. Listen, Fuck that nigga. I'm you Negro nowhere.


Not stupid. Come on y'all. Oh. And that's my final point now that I've heard his Negroes. No, I think he's using it like the old black people use it to talk about specific Negroes. I don't think he's talking about all the Negroes. You talking about specific people And it's a nasty cape y'all make me wear, but I don't have a problem putting it on. Yeah. I think Big T has given that nigga some behind the scenes. I got you do what the fuck you want. And he like, word you gotta remember and yo fuck y'all nigga. Like that's what he's, you know They working in tandem. They, they just went to the, they just went to where, where the immigrant was eating good as the, the Renaissance.


What the name of that hotel that was down there. They went up there and said, check, check please. Y'all better clear this out in 30 minutes. Eric Adams and Big T gotta work in 10 minutes. But you gotta remember he's up for reelection. People in of New York City was saying that he wasn't doing anything for New York. Look what's going on. So now he, he's standing with Trump. 'cause of Trump views on that specific Topic, Know what we're doing. Or immigration. It was the biggest thing. So he's standing, so now he's trying to be like, I'm trying to clean up the city. I'm trying to make the city safe. It's about New York. He's in that bag. When he was with Biden, he wasn't saying that, oh, new Yorkers a is a hub. We welcome all people for a sanctuary city.


Yeah, sanctuary. Then it started getting, later on he started to change this too. Are you crazy? My man, man Is in office to take office And we have just a yo you ever find some loose money in an old jacket For sure. Yeah. Or in a couch. Best feeling in the world. Yeah, for sure.

I bought this at the third store And it just, how y'all want a nigga to Talk? Yeah. Yo, can you imagine how Trump felt just seeing what was going on in the Renaissance? My nigga Trump.


See what you did. Right? Like when Biden was in power, he said, oh, well he probably couldn't wait. Trump signing some shit today to make English the official language of the United States. It's not already. I thought it was already. No. Now it's like we don't have an Official language. No, that's for them. But he He fucking With them. Yeah, It is them. Them. We don't have an Official language. But now he Trump told them motherfuckers yesterday the entire Republican party.

God damn you looking at the next five. My mom said wait that, oh they shot me. My mom said I'm hurting now. Yo. I'm hurt. She, and this was I'm sure in confidence, broadcasted, broadcasted I'm up 3 million. I'm positive that she told me this in confidence. She said Yo ice is so handsome now. Now she said yo, who would think somebody could even be that handsome ice?


I said, yeah, nah, he looked good. He looked good. But I knew what she was saying. Ice was a hot ass mess. Hey Mel, you not off the fucking hook. I know you not off the fucking hook. Listen, that ice was putting the TVs up at the kickback. You not off the hook. Little yo. Hello? It's okay. My si. I know what kickback we at. Where the TV still got go? Ain't up. Ain't up yet. Hey alright go pick that for me more. Yeah man that ain't working. Mel is crazy. Crazy as hell. That wire the cable. Watch you trying to watch the fight. Oh my Lord.


Shit. Also the fight is this weekend. Yeah. Yeah. Tank versus some nigga somebody Word, some nigga. Same result. Larry Roach. Right. His man. What's his name? That's his man. That's his man. Whoever is whatever Tank is fighting this weekend. Lamont. Lamont Roach. Lamont Roach. My apologies. I didn't mean to do that. Tank is fighting Lamont Roach this weekend. I noticed. 'cause yesterday my barber was like, you watching the fight this weekend? I was like, wait, what fight? He said Tank. I said who Tank fighting? He couldn't tell me. He said some nigga. He said some nigga.


Which leads me to my point about tank fights. I'm picking Tank to win this fight. Of course maybe even fast whenever he feel like it. I don't know enough about the, the gentleman that he's fighting. So I'm just sitting here cracking jokes. But my point is, one day I would like Tank the Greatest Box or one of the greatest boxes we have today to fight somebody. I know. Didn't he do that just recently? His last No, I didn't know that last little nigga he fought. I only knew Ryan Garcia from fucking YouTube Tank Got at least five fights recently that I have no idea who these people are.


I knew. I'm just watching So, so I could see Tank knocked the nigga out. Yeah. That's all I'm watching for. So I Don't care. No, I wanna see a fight man. I wanna see a fight. I Don't wanna see a fight. I wanna see T knocking the out. I want, I would like to see a fight. He be in fights. What fight He be losing some of these shit Yo tank until he decide all until What? Fight. Fight You down Joe. I'm, I'm a boxing casual so tell me I ain't, I'm Just saying no saying even the guys that he fight, they may not have the public cache, but it'd be good fights. Like niggas be fucking tank up till he decide to step back and hit him with that motherfucking Upper cut. You must be talking about years ago. No, I don't know what fight in the last two years matches what you're saying.


Yeah. And I don't pretend to know. Yeah, but He be in some They don't. Who do these niggas be? Nobodys that we know. Dog. If you fluffing your record up, just fluff your record up. Go ahead. You still, you still bad. Don't kick my ass please. Just for running my mouth. I got enough issues out here. I got enough going on. As Long as he's still knocking niggas the fuck out. I'm cool because that's what I, that the niggas I talk to, that's what we watching for anyway. We wanna see Tank knock somebody the fuck out. It's like Mike watching the old Mike Tyson fight. I didn't care Who he was fighting. No it's not. No, no, no. I'm not saying Mike, listen, let me, let me land. As you say, a lot of the mike fights, we just wanted to see Mike knock somebody the fuck out.


Now Mike did fight names and he had battles that, you know, niggas knew. Of course. But I'm just saying it didn't matter. It didn't matter. We just fight. We were watching for the knockout. True nigga fighting Bubba Sparks. Don't nobody kid. I don't care. 39, knock him the fuck out. Okay. He did it. Good. That's what I got my Money's worth for. Listen, I was only eight years old and my memory is bad. But in hindsight, being young in the room when Mike fought Busta Douglas, I think my uncles and cousins lost a lot of money. People Know his money. I didn't really know what was going on. You tell by who at the time the reaction. But yeah, in hindsight they was down fucked up. That living room was down bad.


Real Quiet. Yeah, it was 88. That fight was on at nighttime. I'm down south so I was going outside. No adults stopped me. It was like midnight Before what you Did. They didn't give a give A fuck what You gotta do dog. Listen, shout the tank. Shout out the tank now that he needs it. This fight is in New York too. Real? Oh shit. Yeah. This Fight is in New York. So that mean on a baby free weekend, Hey Odd Was 42 to one. I feel like I lose money by not betting on tank fights. Yeah. Like Tank versus Ryan Garcia. I was too lazy to go down to the casino in Vegas and put something on it Tank versus this last little dark skinned dude, I don't know his name.


It's short dude that he made like work of didn't do nothing with that homeboy that he hit with that up. That fierce uppercut. Sure didn't do nothing with that. I feel like we got years of you Live by a computer you don't gotta go to, ain't no more you can do that shit from your Phone. I don't do that. Yeah, You can do that shit from your phone. Yeah, but no, no. You Know what? Because I don take Don't don't. I don't do that. Don't nah, don't. Yeah, I don't do that Addictive personality, Joe. Yeah, don't do that.

No I don't. Playing with nobody played with him. No, you don't play with him at all.


But ain't no young up and coming. Like All we got, we got Mark. All we got Yo. Oh shit was just my imagination Running Away with me. Hey, we got Stephen A. Smith next presidential elect. Is that real? Yeah, unfortunately It is. Is he actually like no. Oh okay. People just want him To run. He's not running. He hasn't announced plans to run. Actually he went on his show the other day and said that he's totally not qualified to run and that him having even 1% of the projected vote just speaks to the state that the Democratic party is in.


Fair. Yeah, It is fucked up though. Yeah It is. It's a lot going on bro. Mama name Clay. I'm gonna call him Democrats on some bullshit but For sure. Yeah, you should run. Where President I passed, We, we go to the moon. Been there, done That with the six Ho. Been there Done. If I remember President, I'm stopping at Johnny Rockets like I'm, I'm got other places to stop at. Oh shit. Cincinnati got Johnny Rockets. I'm toing places that I just ain't even supposed to be at at all.


Alright, what else is important up there? Drake Tour canceled. Which tour? The Australian tour. He did a couple dates and then they canceled the rest of the tour. Oh. Supposed to be dates next week. I should have pulled that move. I didn't know. Didn Didn't even Hear that. I didn't know. I thought the tour Ben Parks. Nah, that boy Parked. Nah, he had, he had a, didn't even catch one. I don't keep up on the Drake hater tweets. So what, what the story is? Well what they came out to say is it was a routing error with the way the tour was routed. Sure. And he had Gets sticky. It was like a 1112 day gap between shows.


So they wanna, they canceled those shows. Said they've been real costly. Sure. They gotta keep the crew there. They gotta keep all the people there for an additional two weeks. Yeah. Got it. Got it. Some shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. I can see it. Why do You think it is? Oh, I have no idea. I have no idea. I don't believe that. I don't know how tall ago that, that, that, that doesn't make sense to me. Yeah, that's like the Gene Hackman murder that Sense. Well it was days and like it was lapses and days between the shows. But why Wouldn't that be ironed out before you got on the plane to Australia? That's why, that's why before you issued the whole tour schedule an itinerary that should have been figured out. That wouldn't have made no sense. Hmm. I mean we've seen we, It Is believable for anybody but him.


That's not believable for anybody. For me. Oh, I Disagree with that. Actually. It's more believable for other people than him. I Disagree because the other people, penny pension for real. You know what I'm saying? He got enough money where that's racist. What? I'm joking. Yeah. He got enough money that if it was three day gaps and you had to house everybody and all of that shit for three or four days, the smaller acts can't afford to do that. So we gotta, you know what I'm saying, be on point with it. None of that's believable because again, we look at all of this shit before we even announced the tour. That makes sense. We got the dates. Yeah. Somebody says, Hey look, from March 3rd, we don't have another show until March 14th. Yeah. What are we doing? What are we doing in here?


Yeah. Nah. Like March the album. The album did better than they niggas thought. And he come back to the stakes nigga, let his presence be felt. Nigga, I don't need, I don't need to relax in Australia no more. I don't need to lay low nigga, they love me out here. The noise is, the noise is rumbling. I'm coming back home. Come on. Come back home nigga. Get, get, get, get, get, get back in your bag. You know what I'm saying? Is it, I'm gonna Ask. They said the dates were sold out. Yeah. What? I heard people tight. The people mad. I haven't fact checked any of this info. No, they said that. I'm just telling you what I read from strangers online. They said that the dates were sold out. I can't really understand.


If you got sold out karaoke then why not go? Ain't like he was exerting energy nigga out there. Alright y'all, y'all, you see this one with me? Y'all put the money down. Y'all gotta do it. Y'all gotta do this one. Bitch. Listen, Why would you can't? It sounds like I'm cracking on it. Easy. It's easy money but I'm not. It's easy money. Why would you cancel that? We not talking about the Beyonce tour or Nothing. I got the gig in the world. I'm going somewhere. I'm dropping the mic. I'm letting these Australians do some shit with they little funny bro. People signs. I'm going, I'm going to this.


It might be what? Flip said Yo, yo, I'm ready to get back now. Yeah. Ready to get back in the tan. And this ain't worth for enough money for me to stay out here and do all of this. Like now he thought, he thought it was over. It was looking shaky. He sure. Or maybe not over, but yeah. Okay. I'm still moving it like I thought I would. I don't know what's going on. I just think it's more the story. I definitely don't, I have no idea. I know I'm not buying. What could be the other possibilities in your opinion from your professional standpoint? What can be other possibilities? If it's a sold out show, I'm gonna just start saying shit that ain't gonna sound believable to nobody. Health issues. I think sometimes if you that powerful you could just get moody. Say, I don won't do this shit no more, yo Shit, I thought enough I'm done now.


Shit Ain't popping out here like that. I ain't really having even, I ain't having fun. I'm done. Yeah. I ain't having fun. I'm done. Yeah, but we got sold out so what? I don't care. Make up a find, Find a reason. Go tell 'em some shit. But I'm going home now. Like I think that could really be a possibility. Mm. Like I'm not over When he was on that run many, many, many, many years ago and he had that shit in Miami and then that shit in Miami got canceled. I was like, I was stuck in that. Well why Don't you cancel that show to Miami show. I know what y'all doing out here, you and future after party. I I you was still in the city so why cancel it unless you just moody and be like, you know what, Fuck that tonight. Like, I don't know above my pay grade. But I don't think it has to be some technically sound business reason as to why he canceled it.


I don't, I don't think anything was threatened. I don't think the Australian was about to shoot at him. I I don't think there's any violence or any of that. I don dunno. I don know not my Business. I wish, I wish I could have saw what were the available tickets beforehand. I know people are saying it was sold out, but there's two sold, there's two sell outs. There's a true sell out. And then we just did a good capacity. It is it possible It wasn't what they wanted it, the number wasn't, it didn't justify staying this long. We did these dates, we got these dates left and It is X amount of tickets left. Man, fuck this man. We outta here. Let's go back home. Shit just ain't fun out here. I miss all. It could be anything. Yeah. I just know I ain't buying that Kendrick in the weekend.


This summer in Jersey. Yeah. And I don't have tickets to either one yet. Yeah. And Louis CK is going on tour. For real? Yeah. And I'm trying to catch, I'm trying Tyler at the garden. I'm Trying to get that Wu-Tang shit at the garden too. Tyler was the answer to that j Cole question you asked me last week. Who's in that weight class that he would It's Tyler. That's a good one. Yeah. Rapping. Yes, It's whatever. Both Rapping and metrics. Yeah. And that's who's in the weight. Many Many people will say no to the rapping part. Yeah. Like but a lot of people will say yes to the rapping part. I'm one of the people that will say yesterday and He sells his many records. See that when you start talking about hip hop, rap, beef, the record sales and all that shit go out the window.


Well the rap beef, whatever you think of the rap beef don't matter 'cause it's two niggas that don't have beef. I'm just saying. Yeah. So we'll never have a definitive answer about any of that shit. I take Gibbs over Tyler In what Rap beef we talking about. Okay. Like that's who you would rather see. Yeah. Like jumping in the ring Spitters rappers like Yeah, me personally Tyler, I'm just saying if Tyler shoot at anybody, he can't be dismissed. Freddy Gibbs is in a place, this is not a dis Fred. Freddie Gibbs watches the show and he hit me after we said whatever we said. But Freddie Gibbs can be dismissed by certain people.


I would agree with that. They choose To. I would agree with that. Tyler Can't be dismissed by anybody. But again, this is hyperbole because nobody is, nothing is coming from that. Yeah. But it hit me later after you asked that question. Tyler is the person. It's a good one. I would Like to See that show too though. When's he, when's he coming? I gotta get the date. Yeah, it's, it's, it's March. Okay. I'm definitely In there for that. All right. What else? What else, what else? What else we got? I did want to play for my distinguished panel.
