Do the video. They Do. And she might've been living out a dream to be a video vix. No, you can't. Now back to y'all. No, you cannot go pop ass on your off time if you are a detective. They said that she should have just informed the her employers, Yo, I'm gonna go pop this ass. Yeah man, get outta here. But the union people sounded like they, they had her back.

But what you take the, if you, you're making good money, don't, that $500 is not Gonna, you've done a free video before. You've done a free video before. Don't lie. Don't do that. You've done a video to, in which you did not get paid. Not even my first video. Maybe not your first video, but you've wanted the video in your videography you didn't Get paid for.

Right? You was popping up. You would charge him for the free. Yeah. I'm having second thoughts on that. Well now. Yeah, now, now. But you'd have been in there. But anyway, yeah, she definitely had ass. I I do think that some of these jobs come with morals clauses to where your out outside behavior can have an impact on your job. I would've assumed a policeman to be one of those gigs. But maybe I'm off. Well if there, maybe I'm off. I would Fight on moral, moral Clause in that if there is a morality clause, I fight. Honestly all the outside behavior of cops assaulting their wives should be taken into account but it never is. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Think we're gonna talk about morality clauses. Yeah, I Agree.


I'll tell you what, that police, that police union is strong. I don't think she's going to, I think she'll be right. She'll be just fine. She gonna be just fine. I don't see what the case is. Even if you have a morality clause, I didn't do anything. Like we gonna have to argue that She's okay. She's not getting reprimanded. She's not, she hasn't been suspended with or without pay. She good and she's got her, you know, So it's just people talking. It's just people talking. That's it. That's it. Or if it's just people talking, then I'm about to book her for a music video.

Yo, take this bitch down or take this nigga down. They be jumping niggas on a plane now. Now passengers are involving themselves and tackling and assaulting people that act like that. You tackling a naked nigga though, Nigga. If if what? I might just trip 'em. And so the question I have is that if we're able to get the person that's acting irate, contained, do they still have to turn around? Probably. Yeah. So they can't put them in a seat and duct tape them. I saw they duct taped somebody One time. I didn't duct tape nigga one time. But they still, that's just to get back. Oh, okay. So shorter.

I got arrested in mad times at the end of the flight.


Oh for real? What? Yes. So you got arrested at the end of a flight? It is not arrested 'cause I wasn't arrested. They take you A little room detained but They escort you off the plane. Yo. Sorry, come on The marshals or whatever. What are they called? I'm gonna add air marshals. Air marshal. The police at the gate man. Waiting on you for you What Man, Dude, You curse out a flight attendant Trying to smoke. That would Be disgusting. What did I do? My memory is bad. You cursed out a flight attendant. There was one, I think you were trying to go to the bathroom when they said you couldn't go to the bathroom and then you just like, like cursed. Refuse to not go, not go to the bathroom. Fell asleep On the passenger. Then there was one. There's That one.


Yeah, I fell asleep on the passenger. But That can't wait. What? That happens, that's, I'm saying that happens. Why would you get detained For that? No, that's, that's not okay. You can't fall asleep. You can't fall asleep. I Just accident on a passenger. Well then And they Gotta call the cops for that. Where did This new rule come from? Coral. You like no That's not a new rule. You can't do that. People Allow you to do it on stuff. Well sometimes You just, you're sitting there. That's a courtesy. And if somebody, If they don't, The cops, I gotta get get me arrested. That, That seems excessive. Wake me up my nigga. Yo. Big dog. Big dog. Big dog. So he didn't wake you, the person you fell asleep on, they didn't wake you up? Apparently not. They were like, excuse me black man, sleep on me. Get 'em. Then there was a time I was dead set on telling them that this first class seat was mine and it wasn't.


I could See that one. It wasn't, It Wasn't yours. I used to play a lot of poor games, Try to stick in the first class. I used to play a lot of poor people. How long do they hold you when they detain you in that little room? Because there's a room back then. I got sent to that room too. There's A room. Hold, hold on. You walk on the plane and sit in the, you didn't have a first class seat at all? Not at All. Mm You just sat there. I've done that before. I just saw that happen on my last flight. First Class people gotta go in first. Right? So you chill, let the plane go, come in kind of when you think all of them are done. And if It is an open seat, snatch up.


You sit there. This is before I knew that they had a list of your names of your name to go with the Seat. And some people get the, the at the gate upgrade to first class and they Fill those Up. Then there's, then there's some of that. So sometimes you know, get up and you leave This one time I just wasn't with that. I guess It was a natural Repo. So when they detain you, what did they do? How long are you in the airport for Joe? I wasn't in, I wasn't never that long. Okay. I was never arrested. Got It. Got it. I just had something happen the last, when? When I just took the flight last weekend. It was a regular united flight. I did not fly first class and you know that's okay. You know United got your regular seats.


Why not? Why didn't you Short flight sitting right here. I'm save the Money. How long would it Two hours, three? No, 12 hours hours. Two and a half hours. First class, two hours. What's the first Short flight is like from here to Boston. Where? Oh the 45 minute shit. First class? Yeah. Two hours. It is the first class. No, I'm saying I they had it. I just felt I didn't need it. I need it for a longer flight after my experience. But anyway, so they have the extended leg row seats that are right near the exit row. Con economy plus and then Yeah. Yeah. Plus ones to exit. They were all empty. So the three people A across from me all got up and just sat in them seats. And then I had my daughter, me and the person that was next to me, he got up and sat across from me.


So me and my daughter had the row flight attendant walked up. She was like, seats are all paid for. We are in the air already. Oh shit. Dcs are all paid for. You can't sit there. They like dog, ain't nobody in the seats. Like, and she made them get up, made him get up to come back to his seat. They like arguing with her. I'm just sitting there laughing like that's why you Sit. See I've been on some fun flights where just nobody made the flight and whoever had the mic was cool. So they like, hey this is all that's on the plate. Sit wherever you're See that fine. That's fine. You Lay down on that shit. I've been on some of those too Now I've been on that. Yeah. They Tell you that shit be killed because yo, this is a full flight. This is a full flight that you get on this mad empty Seat.


But hey, why the flight attendants be no and all disrespect attendant. Why the flight attendants be having attitudes and act like they God sent to Earth. Like you know they God on earth. I don't Necessarily think That I gay ones. They cool. But I'm talking about though they cool. They already, they been through a lot. But what I'm saying is that there's a lot of flight attendants that have nasty attitudes. They're not respectful. You say hello? They they, they snotty some of them. A lot of them. I don't like that I had to come across those Guy not the young with the BBLs. They cool 'cause they know you watching them and shit.

Depending on Kendrick, Stevie fucking Wonder nigga, somebody big Stevie Wonder.


I'm Paying somebody big. It is lit out there. Okay. Janet Jackson says some shit. Somebody else said it. Got it. Got it. Somebody is raising your price. Okay. Right. Let's put the, the, the, the starting price at six. You was making six. I was making six. Yes. You took the jump. We ain't got a name. What the jump is. All right. It jumped off of that. But you jumped out the window though with it like a jump jump Wherever you jumped it at. I don't even care. Okay. If you took the six to 10 or 15 wherever you took it to. Got it. My question is, how long does your price stay there before it comes back down? Very good question. Depends on what you Got cooking. Yeah. Once depends. Once, once. Wait, how do it depend on what you got cooking? I'm telling you, if you had a whole bunch cooking price change didn't depend on what you got cooking.


It depended on the shout out. He's right. So now the shout happened. But It is. It is. Yeah. But listen back there now. So how long can you say, yo, I'm telling you When, when them calls start getting or the, not the calls, but when you give them that new price and it ain't like we going pass, we going pass and that happened quite a few times in a row and you not getting booked for the new price no more. And they, they nevermind time to put it on for sale. Gotta bring it back down a little bit. But then, but that's, that's sort of like I don't want to get serious. But then you are the same person that would say that you give them the price that you know you are worth. Right. So then like Do you Well I was gonna say on the flip side of what he's saying.


Yeah. Even though I agree with what he's saying. Yeah. Being serious now. That's what I'm saying. There's also times where you may set your price at something that you not getting from the field at all. Like you gonna set your price. My price is 10, nobody's paying me 10. I ain't got 10, but I'm standing firm at the 10. 'cause one, eventually somebody will gimme 10 and two, I just need the word to go around that. I'm charging 10 Now. Also smart. So I'm not getting booked. You have to be able to able and will You better be able to play that game to, To sustain. You have to without getting that 10 though. You have to. Yeah. You gotta Be able. This what I want. Gotta Pick up some it shit.


You gotta hold out. Yeah. If you gonna hold out, you just gotta be able to to weather the storm. Yeah. I think that when the, the shit though, that Was one of mine and Ian's first, first, first little sit downs when he kept telling me to not take my $3,500 brown bag. I was like, what do you mean? Mm, look, It is a brown bag full of money. And I, if I do this, which I a couple times, yeah I need this money. Like I can't afford to not have this money. He is like, yeah, but in the grand scheme ain, everybody going to keep knowing that a $3,500 brown bag get it done. Yep. You gotta say no nigga. Well we was saying no for mad long. It was months and months and months I was broke as shit.


And that, that's, that's where the real test Is. That's the sacrifice. We don't talk about the sacrifices. No, That's the real test. Everybody can't, everybody can't do that. Nope. Or some niggas of all right. You know what, I'm a, I'm a hunker down and I'm not taking no brown bags. And then niggas got life knocking on the door. Kids and all that shit. All right. You know what, lemme go get. I know I could go get that. That's the other thing though. If you're saying your price is 10, I'm just throwing numbers out. If you're saying your price is 10 and it ain't been, It is up to you to go prove why It is too. Gotta Justify The work. Gotta justify. Yeah, you gotta, I was mad. I was mad at you when you was, when when I told you I was getting a number and you told me you gotta, I gotta turn that number down. I remember we had something about that. You was like, yo man, we had something big about that.


And you was like, nigga, I remember That. You gotta turn that number down man. You don't have to go chase all the brown bags. Man, I forgot how you put it, but you put it in a way that when I went home and thought about it, I'm like oh, I understand what he's saying. But nigga, when you in the midst, if it's easy to get a quick seven, if it's easy to drive to DC and get a quick nine, Anything easy ain't worth having. Facts. Got it. I mean easy is is relative. Thank you. I heard such a simple quote and something I was watching the other day. Maybe one of 'em shows but whatever. But he said the thing about being great, I mean part of being great is being great.


That's the end of the quote. Like you gotta be great. So much comes with being great, great. Yeah. That if you want be great, then you gotta actually be great. Which is not taking what's easy and sitting right there taking the drive country to just doing some shit. Some shit bugged out shit that everybody's not signing up to do. What separates you from the pack right now? We done got serious. I was just trying to crack her. Mel. Yeah, we done got serious by mistake.

She was killing it. I researched that shit. You was killing it on this. You was killing it. I'm being funny. You was killing it. But what I'm saying is that now Mel, oh my god.

I'm alright. We back. I'm Conflicted. Oh, sorry. No, go ahead. Go ahead. What's wrong? The Braun and Stephen A. Smith stuff. I'm Ed and I want to just say why Go ahead. I'm not into sports because he may, He he Addressed it. But Go on. Yeah, I'm not into sports, but this came on my timeline and me as a father, I understand how LeBron feel, but on the other hand, I understand what Stephen a is saying is that if, if you know your son is not do doing good on the team and you're the leader of this team, you shouldn't be that sensitive if you are allowing, I don't wanna say if you're allowing him to play, of course he said that you, we know you didn't tell the coach to put him in or whatever, whatever Steven said. But I do understand what Steven is saying.


Like, if, if your son is out there and by for some reason your influence got him on the team and he's able to play, he's up for scrutiny, he's up for ridicule and to approach Stephen A. Smith and say, yo, leave my son out of it. I can't see Stephen a saying anything bad about Bronny besides that he's not doing good and showing his average. I really feel that that's, that's unfair. And it shows me that no matter how high you get there, no matter how high or successful you get on the ladder, there's still comments that may bother you and trigger you. So I'm in the middle of that. I'm, I'm dead in the middle 'cause I wouldn't want nobody talking about my son, but I do understand what he's saying sometimes just I need to hear, you need to hear that.


Okay. Where is everybody else stand in the LeBron versus Stephen a debate. Does everybody know what happened at the Nick's Laker game? Nick Nick's Lakers game the other night. LeBron came over to him after the game, looked like he had a heated conversation with her and he stepped off some of the mouth readers out there said that it looked like that conversation was about brony. Steven a then went on first take and addressed it. He said, I what he, he said he didn't plan on addressing it, but the situation had gone so viral that he has no choice. He woke up to all these texts from executives and coworkers and his peers. I don't know that I agree with that by the way. He said He Wanted to address this.


I I don't, I don't know that you have to reply to something because it's so viral and if people are of that belief, I think that should be re-examined. Well, this is what he said. He said he can't repeat the words because they're not suited for FCC airwaves. But he said that he said that he wasn't gonna address it, but everything went viral. That wasn't a basketball player confronting me. That was a parent that was a father. And I can't sit here and be angry or feel slighted by LeBron James in any way in that regard. He clearly took exception to some of the things that he heard me say and he confronted me about it. And basic basically said LeBron LeBron's agent has his number and can call him if he wants to.


I'm I'm on the side of Steven a in this one. Me too. Just because it, my, my job is to talk about athletes. Well, sports and it just so happens that your child is participating. I'm just doing my job. I'm gonna talk about him. If he's doing good, we're gonna talk about him. This is what happens. You used your, your name, you used your star power to get him here. And to a lot of people, he's not meeting the, he's not delivering meeting the standards. Yeah. Yeah. He's not meeting the standards. So yeah, he's going to, a lot of scrutiny is gonna come with that LeBron court scrutiny first year in the league, just because of the name King James and all of the hype around him.


When there's hype around something and it doesn't live up to the hype, people gonna talk. So now you've used your name to get your son here. Yeah. People, people were already against that move. So now if you, if it's up, if your son proves everybody wrong, we don't have this conversation. But unfortunately he's proven a lot of people. Right? So they're gonna point out, Hey, we told y'all about him. They're gonna talk about him. He's an athlete in the NBA. We talk about athletes. All right. I hate to find myself on the exact opposite side of this. I'm on, I'm on all the LeBron side. I'm on the LeBron side with this. Why do you think that Stephen a takes the opportunity to be extra critical?


Because it's LeBron's son? I think all of the people that lemme not say all. I think a lot of the people that are critical of Bronny James, it's a, because of their relationship with his dad. Or B because it's a ratings chase. Ah, Ronnie James. Like everybody, we, if we, we at the card table. Let's, let's see everybody's hand for real. I don't want to hear that. He's a player. I criticize players. So it's fair game. That's not true. There's not been another 56 pick in the draft that's been covered this way.


I see that's been critiqued this way. He ain't played enough to be critiqued. He's critiqued when he's not in the games. I understand what You're saying. And you're doing that because of ratings. The same way the NBA aired for the first time ever, the second day of the draft because of ratings. The only people who, who, who should be up to evaluate Bronny James game is A his dad. B, the organization that drafted him. True. I don't want to hear about LeBron using his strings to get him drafted because Bronny James, from what we've seen, is doing better than, than some of the people that were drafted after him. No, well, all the people that were drafted after him and some of the people that were drafted before him.


So there are great basketball minds that are watching this kid and banking on some of the greatest genes in the world and one of the greatest teachers and players ever helping to develop this guy into an official NBA player. I don't want to hear y'all attacking him because of Raiders. They're attacking him because Steven a don't, Steven a don't fuck with LeBron. He said that in his response. He continued to say, me and him don't necessarily see eye to eye on a few things. Got it. And it's been that way for some years. So if it's been that way for years, Why come? I got it. I know that you do your job as it pertains to me, I'm, I'm one of the people that I've been faced with scrutiny long before my first NBA game.


I've been probably the, the most scrutinized player in the history of the sport since facts early high school when my games was on ESPN two and, and all the rappers was coming out. I invented this thing that don't have to have nothing to do with my son. LeBron didn't do nothing that any other dad in the world wouldn't do for his kids. I agree With that. I agree with that part. I agree with that part a hundred percent. So if I'm doing what I'm supposed to do as a dad, and you would do it too. 'cause you're a dad, everybody's a dad. Hundred percent. It is not for you to come and hide behind the guise of your job to use and manipulate my son's role to just attack certain things when it's not fair. It's not fair. I think it's fair to criticize Brony if you're doing the same scrutiny to other players in the G League or whatever developmental situation he's playing under, which they're not, But he's doing both, right?


Ain't bro, they're not G League and Laker, He doing whatever his team is asking him to do. Do, do you not think that, say, okay, so I see what you're saying. That's how And when Mark and Ish was on that shit months ago. Yeah. I stand on the side of you shouldn't critique someone's child in a certain way. See, we never saw a dad and his son in the league at the same time. That's that's we've seen, we've seen players kids, but not with they dad right there active. See, I think you could critique the kid, but I think that it should be fair. Like, it, it goes even to what the, what Chuck was saying about ESPN without saying it was about ES, espn.


I don't know if you saw that last night. He went on a little rant about how they cover, I saw a rant. Nothing but the Lakers in the and the Warriors when there's the Cavs and I forgot O kc Okay C doing great and they don't ever cover them. Which I agree. That's been my criticism of ES, ESPN for a minute. At least in terms of NFL. Like we're talking about the Patriots and the Cowboys, who gives a fuck? They're not relevant. I Mean this, Hey listen. So I think that same thing can be applied here. Like if, if he's not relevant or playing an irrelevant role, it's why we covered it. This Is still business and That's why we covering it and it, nah, stop. But hold on y'all, y'all hold on. In a world where niggas is getting fired, left and right. Yeah. Ratings be down in these places. Yep. This person losing a show, this person losing a show.


We have to do what we gotta do to keep these eyes on us to do our jobs. So It is talking about the Lakers, It is talking about the Cowboys for them. Whoever they're board that works for them. You got your son on the Lakers. You are the face, you, you are him in the NBA. We gonna talk about him. See, I I even we do it called Cap on that. You have been the number one rated morning show for 13 years. You are essentially the face of this network. If there's anybody that will be allowed to go off a script or change what the script is, it's you. So if you coming into work dog, if we coming to work 10 pods in a row and I'm beating a topic down to the point that why are we even talking about this?


I do expect somebody to say, Hey dog, Enough Enough. Now I got you. So when they have their pre-production meetings, because on TV you have meetings and LeBron know what time It is. Like I know what time It is. Y'all are talking about the hot Topics, The things that drive ratings. You've done your research, there's analytics. So we are gonna give you, same thing Charles Barkley said, who's the go LeBron or Jordan? They're gonna give you Lakers talk Dallas cowboys talk no matter what's going on in the sport. Right. Some people say that's a, some people say that's a large part of why the sports commentary is dwindling down the drain. I think that's the problem. I think that that Stephen a in particular is compelling and talented enough to make great storylines about anything else.


He don't, He's great bro. Bro. He's one of the, he's one of the goat to the shit works. He don't, you know what works? It is low hanging fruit, just What It is. Low hanging fruit, bro. It's just like what you, what you just said. If you came in here 10 positive a road talking about something, Drake do something, we get a uptick. Why? Because they wanna see you talk about Drake. It's the same thing. They wanna see Steven A, they wanna see skip hate on LeBron. They wanna see these people who have built their bias. I On that. I absolutely love your example and you know the history of Drake and this podcast. We wouldn't speak about his child. His child is doing songs. Great example. His child is doing songs. Kanye's child is doing songs. We would not get on air and critique a fucking kid's song that way.


Well Talking. That's just totally different. What's the difference? Those are toddlers versus adults. Ir if you talking about somebody's kid, you talking about somebody's kid. But You only saying the kid is with the father. You're seeing them together because everybody's somebody's child. If you wanna technically speak everybody, we all somebody's child. So you're saying that they're both playing on the team and you're actually seeing a father and a son play together. So it's different 'cause you're seeing he have to be a father, not only a father, a coach and a mentor at the same time. Yes. If Everybody, I understand what You're saying. Everybody's father was standing next to you. I got you. I agree with you. Whatever you would say to me, you might not say it if my dad was standing right next to me. No, I would Not. Right. I think, I think the parallel in your example would be is if, we definitely talk about Drake a lot here, but it's when things are in the news, it would be if we came in here, rain, sleet, snail, whatever, and forced him in and talked about Drake when it's not relevant or Kendrick or whoever, fill in the blank.


Kanye West, whoever. So When LeBron says to him, leave my son out the shit, so LeBron is aware that yo, I I know you don't fuck with me. I know you go out your way to talk about me, but don't bring my son into it basically. Yeah. Got it. So I'm You leave my son, leave my son out of our beef. Yeah, I'm on your side now, But on the phone you are covering my child in a manner to which you and I know why you're doing it. Got it. The last time I that I reached out, 'cause it's been going on for some months, the last time that I told Rich Paul and them to reach out to you and speak to you about it, you went on air and said that that was pussy or that was corny or whatever the word was that he used at the time.


So now when he does this address and says LeBron has my number, rich Paul has my number. Dallas has fucking Dallas, Maverick, Dallas, Carter Maverick. Maverick Carter Maverick Marick, I'm sorry, has, has has my number. Oh. Oh, okay. No dog. Steven a is from Queens. Yes. You know, on onsite rules, you know on site When I see you, You know, on site rules, I didn't wanna reach out to you. We tried that a few months ago. It didn't work. You went back on air saying whatever you said that he got a problem with. They haven't been specific about that. So I won't try to pretend. Yeah, sure. But I, I've seen enough clips to where it's like that's harsh for somebody's kid.


So if I felt like that watching, he gonna feel like that watching. It ain't phone time, homie. I'm gonna see you. When I see you at the game, I'm gonna say something to you. You Have to remember, Joe, that you are from the soil people. That's not from the, I'm not, I'm not talking about Stephen. A you're from the soil. So your principles and morals lie different. You, you, it, you. And I'm not taking anything from you neither freeze. I'm just saying like some people that experience that, that give grace when they see a parent with their kid, we, It is, we come from a different background when it comes to that. A lot of people don't have those same sentiments. It's all fair and game. Okay. See I if your mom is there, if, if if I see somebody and their mom is there and I have an issue, I'm not saying anything.


Not doing. I'm you getting a past. I'm not even gonna talk to you. I don even, I'm even gonna say hello. I don't play like that. 'cause I believe in that and I would want that same grace. Some niggas don't care Where I come from. This is on page one of the, of the learning real the learning handbook. Yeah. You don't talk about nobody kids. I agree. I don't care what's going on. I agree. There could be big stories going on. Fucking, I ain't never Remy kid. Right. Big stories. I never came here and said a word. Not at all. You Have any kids. It'd Be a lot of shit where we know they parents out there. I don't come in here and that's not my bag. And I, and I hope that would be reciprocated. I agree. Like don't talk about mine in a certain way. I I you Look at it From a more of a media perspective.


Yeah, because I don't, I don't believe in talking about nobody kids either. I'm with y'all. Yeah. I I'm with Bronny James in particular. This is still a professional athlete playing in this league. It's not just we talking about you, but again It is a dude Type of player. 15 15th. But Len Brunson is Rick Brunson's son. Do you not Don Rayons chase off my kid? You get what I'm saying? Do you not? It's it niggas step curry. Steph Curry is is Dale Curry's son. Do You not take in account Dale Curry ain't really been in the game since the divorce. And when di and d Dio said some shit to Jalen Brunson, Rick Brunson stepped up and said, yo, who the fuck are you talking to? Watch your mouth. You better walk over there.


Like, you don't treat somebody kid that way with they dance standing right there. No, I'm again, I'm not mad at bro approach. I'm just saying in the, in the Huang's a bunch of other Shit doing his job too. Back to Charles Barkley's point. Yeah dog. Y'all ain't covered the cat. We got two teams that's 50 and 10 And Marcus 50 And 11 and no disrespect and Marcus that don't nobody give a fuck about outside of the markets. And that's, bro, stop it. See what do we stop it? You, we know I'm talking about from a media standpoint, bro, we know LA New York, we know the A markets Cleveland and OKC are not a markets. So them talking about them doing this. Well how many times we seen the finals and it was when it was Milwaukee versus who was it Phoenix or something.


And we was like, this is not the finals. The league once. Why? Because these are not the markets that we, that we play to. We wanna see New York, we wanna see la, we wanna see Miami, we wanna see these major cities. So we gonna talk about them. You open with the major fan bases. Hold on. Wait, I'm gonna ask him a question. Joe, please, Please open it up a different Freeze. Let me ask you a question. What's up? As, do you look at a star, a celeb? Do you look at them as that person and don't take account them being a parent, them being a father, them being a, a son, a daughter. Do you, do you just take that away? No, because you, 'cause you as a parent, you're very, when it comes to your daughter, I don't play protect. So you should un understand that same sentiment.


That'ss. Why I said I understand, bro. But you gimme the caveat by saying that yo, but Brony is out there. So he's subjected to be ridiculed. And I was on that same side when I listened to Stephen a's excuse, I said, well, okay, but I didn't know what Joe just explained to me. I didn't know that he pulls things out the air to talk. I didn't know it was a, or I'm not mad. Like, like if you, you, if you got a beef with me and you're using my kid now Yeah. In your beef with me, that's fucked up. I'm not with that at all. I think Brody's open to criticism, but I think it should be fair in terms of his importance to the team in the sport. Got it. I think picking on him, because he is bro's kid as opposed to covering him like you would any other 15th man or G League player or 56th pick or whatever Yeah.


Is where it's I agree. Like We laugh at, we laugh and this is not his child, but I'm just, It is a relative. We laugh at Greek freak's brother in the league and he's 15th man on the bench. But it, it's, it's, it's a joke just because We don't harp on him like they harp on him. No, no, no, no, no. But his name ain't that. But I'm just saying it's a joke making about the 15th Man league because of your relation to somebody else. If his last name was something different and he wasn't, nobody would give a fuck facts. It's the same thing with LeBron. But again, this is the Megastar Brown we talking about. Who he, the name alone brings in ratings. See, but so now they're putting a spotlight on your kid. See, But that's kind of the point too. I love all these examples you're using.


Oh, you looking out like that? Sorry, go ahead Bro. The NASA caught a lot of jokes. We understand where the jokes came from, right? So we don't have to get into that. When he was away from the team, the buck slid and lost 19 to 21 or something stupid. I'm freestyling right now. But they were losing, he came back, they started winning. Then the conversation was, oh shit, that guy, we were joking on his impact to the team, what he does to Greek freak and how he coaches on the sideline clearly plays a part in their winning. Not a story in sight about it.


That's the fucking point. When Bronny go out there and do something, that is when, when he, when did G League, he had that little week where he did That. He was 30 Not a word. Mom's the word about that. So the only highlight the bad. So you playing the ratings game. Well we know how bad right. News works. Say Where that work in any, that's everything. So now if I'm a dad, I'm with You on dad. I'm stepping the old business. Yo got me. I'm LeBron. Yeah. But now my only, I'm The most powerful player in the league. Still in danger. No, y'all can't just say what y'all want to say about the James family. Cool. Damn Near American Sports. I'm with you now. My only thing with that, I don't only wanna see you do it to Stephen A. Smith. Now if, if that's your approach, you gotta keep that energy with the, 'cause it ain't been just him that's been on your son like that.


There's others out there who would be a little bit more aggressive if you approached them That way. Are they at the Laker game? They weren't at that game Because like Steven a said in his response, it's, It is not that. He just talks about the games. He covers the games. He's at the game, he's at Lakers verse Nicks on the sideline. These other niggas might not be there. That's true. That's true. Hey, as soon as this fourth quarter whistle Finishes, I'm coming over there. I'm walking over there. When the Lakers, I was at the Lakers Nick game when it came to New York, that building was packed in a way where, oh, this is different from the other games. It's a lot more media, it's a lot more tourists.


It's a lot more people. It's a lot more children. It's a lot more reporters. It's a lot of people. Like, it's a lot more celebrities. Hey. And that's my point about why they not covering OKC in Cleveland. Laker Knicks, both of them doing good. It's a lot of shit here. We don't care about these small market teams like that, bro. I don't want to get into small market versus, But go ahead. No disrespect, please. I didn't. But that's the, that it's real. I'm on LeBron's side. Okay. And this one, watch your mouth about my kid. Good shit. Yo. All right. What, what happened? Got some Poland Springs up in this piece. Joe, What's this poll Springs are good water. Let's good water man.

What else is there? What else is there? What else is there? Did y'all hear Jermaine Dupris comments? No. Oh, I didn't Tell me about it. Freeze Independence. No. Read it to us. Freeze. Let's hear it. All right. Let Pull it up real quick. Y'all talk. Jermaine Dupree legend. I don know why. Legend. You tweeted this legend. Alright, I got it. Legend. Stir some things up. He says I'm a little lost. Can somebody tell me what the goal of being an independent artist is to today? Because of all the things that people are chasing this shit major artists do. What's the thing that indie artists do that make it special? He sounds like a dinosaur. Why did he tweet this? He Sounds like a, he sounds like a rich person asking about what the poorest do. That's it. I don he sounds really privileged and really fucking antiquated. He sounds like a dinosaur right there.


Not really understanding why Jermaine Dupre knows better than this. He does? Yeah. What Was the goal? Like engagement, farming. Eng It had to be engagement. Farming. I'm going with engagement farming. It Might not even been jd. That might've been a, a intern, intern, intern assistant. Something like that. Mm. Let's stir shit up a little bit. Gotta be. Yeah. This, this one. This one fucked me up. Independent artists keep a high percentage of things. Yes. Yes. And have to do a lot more work. Yeah. They have to do a lot more work. They have freedom. Let's just start there. Major freedom. Yeah. He knows that though. He knows. So J Joe, he just trying to shake the pot. Well, He shook it and And a lot of the independence jumped on his ass.


Yeah. They don't get no beats. He Wasn't looking Creepy. They wasn't Getting And he wasn't looking to sell It to him. Yeah. And he wasn't trying to sell it to him. He might be priced out of that conversation. Hmm. Ah, see what you did there. Nice little Good. Okay. Okay. You good? You good girl. You being an independent artist, you don't, did you feel a way about this when you were in, if you was an independent artist still, would you have felt a way about this? No. I wouldn't have felt a way about it. In independents operate under a different mindset than the major label niggas. And I don't try to interlap. I don't try to. For the two and a half crossover, There's different horses for different courses. It's different. It's totally different games.


Me, when I decided to go independent, I realized that I would do better selling to my 50,000 fans than trying to fit into this system where much too much was expected. Do you feel like Teon made it look good, Joe? Because back then, No. Te nine made it look good. There's A lot of Make it look good. Lot. A lot of People talked, they highlighted him like when it came to being independent Because he was more, he wasn't just an independent artist was I'm saying, wasn't like he's not still active. He is Out tech South of Te nine Tech was a OneStop shop. Is a OneStop shop. You talking about I'm doing my own merch. I'm routing my own tours. I see. I'm doing like my own music.


I do it all. It's all in-house. He's an anomaly to a a lot of that's not just your typical independent act right there. Okay. Sold records. That's Why he's highlighted records. He sold Records and still managed to sell. Yeah. Sold and sells records. And a rapper. A lot. A lot of you niggas under the table. Yeah. Yeah. That an amazing rapper. And his live show was putting niggas to bed. Really? Yeah. And was going to do sell out tours anywhere that he went and was gonna stay on the road for 300 days outta 300, maybe 300, maybe more than that. Yeah. Outta 365 days. And was going to have his fucking Maybach traveling on the back of all of these merch trucks.


Because we gotta bring trucks for all of this merch. We going to sell, like we gonna make eight figures moving around out here as an independent act. Shout out to tech, shout out to strange music. Shout out to the whole gang over there. So that's why he, Why He did that. He's so, and It is doing that. Yeah. But I think it's just different. I think for like a pop artist, if you wanna be the next Drake or Michael Jackson or Britney Spears, or UA Lip or Dua Leap, whoever up the major label system makes sense. Said pop show us. Yeah. A pop artist, a major label system probably makes sense for, because you're not gonna get that kind of marketing exposure. True. You don't have all the relationships with MTV. Not that they matter anymore, but whatever.


Fill in the blank outlet, Playlisting and all of that shit. All that Shit. Everything. That like, like you need that shit for SNL, You know what I mean? All the late night shows, you need that shit. What, what I see start to happen is, especially in rap, it's a lot of the newer rappers, they don't want that. Right. They realize, Hey, I would, I have to give up to get all of that ain't really worth it. Every, I can make a really great living over here. Every musician and artist doesn't necessarily wanna be the most famous person in the world. That's not necessarily a overlap. So people are like, if I get a little famous, that's cool. Yeah. But I would like to make a living, making music or art or whatever.


And I don't, I don wanna be part of that rat race. I Don't that, that, that, that, at one point that confused me. That that mindset, right? Like, I wanna make music. I want people to hear it, but I don't want to be famous. Then you're making music at a high quality level and distribute it out there in order to become, that's going to lead you to be famous. So those type of your goals can change along the way though, due to, to exposure. Okay. True. And this could be your passion. I Say at one point I didn't, because look, I didn't agree with that. When people say they're antisocial, like some of the artists antisocial or There's a lot of money. Yeah, There's a lot. They are, they are so passionate about their art and their craft. Yeah. That they still wanna do that. They would prefer to just be, you don't have to see me, I don wanna talk to you niggas.


You wanna talk to me, go listen to my album. You want my thoughts, go listen to my project. There's my thoughts and there's a lot of them out there that just don't wanna deal with folks. And people are weird. I don't wanna deal with people. Anyway, I went through it. I mean, I did it. So, all right. Yeah. This is actually you. Yeah. When they, when they talk about you, when they talk about the trouble that you gave, how stubborn you were and stuff, like you didn't wanna do nothing. When Nitty tell me, she's like, like, Yeah, but that story is always told about me. How I was just rebellious and yada yada y early in my career. But when I first got in the game, that story's never told. I was just young, wet behind the ears, willing to do anything that I needed to do.


I thrive and sell, not a question asked. The wet behind the ears is a little Mont there too. So these, wait, wait, Joe. So do you feel like you might have had a little wet behind your, a little bit know, little bit little wet for later. Little wet for later Jersey City. Oh, that's what you're saying. Do you feel like, so, so when you were out, when you initially there, you meet niggas and then you start to, So when I'm, I, so when you initially there, and again, this is, I'm talking about 30 years, 25 years ago, right? At this point. So we probably maybe aged out, but, so if I'm doing everything that's asked of me, which is they're putting you in places to be famous.


Yes. You're not famous yet, but they putting you in places to be famous. Oh shit. So I go to Nordstrom's yesterday. I go to Nordstrom's yesterday. Turns out one of the guys, the older gentleman that works in Nordstrom's, used to work at Def Jam. So every time he catch me in there, and I don't be in Nordstroms lot, but when he catch me in there, he always got some story for me. So yesterday, I'm buying some draws. Lemme get some draws up in this bitch. He sees me, he says, yo, funny story, I was just thinking the other day about how when I used to work was working radio 25 years ago. And Benny Pugh was at Def Jam. And Def Jam was sending all these records out. So they had sent me a Rihanna record and they sent me a Joe button record.


So we was about to get on the Rihanna record, but Benny Puke called. And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that Rihanna shit, eh, eh, put it to the side. We don't know about that, that Joe button. We need you on that. That boy is a star. I was like, oh, shout out to Benny Pue. Like, I never knew that, but like that's what it took to kind of be famous when you wasn't famous. So I'm not famous. So they're sending me places you don't want to be there. And then you get famous and now there's a crowd everywhere you go. You need to be handled a certain way when you go, because you're famous. You gotta pop up at everywhere where famous people be at. It is just, I learned early on, I want nothing to do with the fame part of this.


That wasn't my bad. I read that. That's not what I signed up for. I Read, I read that different when you first started talking. I thought that initially when you said it that yo, I was willing to do whatever I needed to do. And then I started to realize that things wasn't so fa favorable in my favor. Like people might have, I'm not saying that I niggas, but people might have been taking advantage of me. People might have been doing stuff or putting me in positions that made me uncomfortable or make me realize that they weren't in it for me. And I can See that change in somebody's attitude towards being famous. Like, yo, this is too much of a headache. Niggas not even giving me what I, what I, what I really need or what I'm owed. You know, the work that I'm putting in, I'm, It is not, I remember when niggas and shout out niggas may get mad at me, but I remember when you first came out, niggas was driving more of a expensive car than you was.


Yeah. But I mean, that's part of the game. It is. But I didn't like that shit. But See, that's the other thing Too. That's All part of me, me thinking that. Now I hear you, but I didn't like, I, I don't like that shit. I don't, I feel like the artist, I don't like that. I don't get it. The nigga that found the talent is probably gonna make more than the talent For sure. On your rookie deal. Yeah. Nah, I don't like that Should be, it should be distributed easily too. That's Just what It is. And back look, Flip back to J d's tweet. That's the other reason why a lot of niggas wanting to choose independence today, they know these stories. Right. Like, you know what I'm saying? I've heard what happened. Like Joe said, I was wet behind the ears. I did whatever they wanted me to do. And you sign a deal that really ain't in your favor, you find you don't find that shit out until Later on.


How Long, how long did you find out that your deal was bad? Like when did you find out from when you signed it that Oh shit, I'm getting fucked. If I signed in oh one shit was bad by oh five. So you, four years later when you said, oh shit, I'm fucked up in This deal. But I ain't even talking about the bad deal part of it. I'm talking about once you sign it and you down to play the game, some of the positions that you'll be in. And I wasn't with it like they was telling me to go to clubs. Stand on tables. Yeah. Bring 70 niggas. The label was how I got in some of my street drama back in the day. Forcing me to, hell go be with 50 niggas everywhere you go. Why? Why? Now I gotta go beef with these niggas.


Yo, go go. Let's have a fake relationship with you and I. Who do they say, Neil, long optics. Yo, how do you want me to tell my girlfriend that I'm doing a fake relationship with Neil? I don't wanna do none of this theatric shit that you want. The other thing too is that the way the music business is now, labels aren't even signing you until you're successful independently. Already Made yourself hot. And now I'm hot in doing this already. I built this infrastructure, I built this fan base. I'm making money. Why am I even going over here? I was, they're tricky. Even, even If you do want the major label deal, you should go get hot. You should go act like an independent. Because the trick now is they tell you there's a ceiling as an independent. And there may be, but, But what they don't tell you is you could live fine.


Right. It might be a good, a nice ceiling. It's A really nice ceiling. Real tall Ceiling. They don't, they don't Make you think like, yo, you're gonna hit this ceiling. You can never make more. And you need us to get to the next level. I don't gotta go to that level. Right. I might be cool with this. I'm good right here. Yeah. And I own all my shit. So I could do some new technology come out later on. I can go make a deal over here. That changed my entire generation, my entire lineages life. I don't think anyone do does it for the art anymore though. That's not true. No, that's Not true. That's not true at All. That's not true. Well, I, well I'm not hearing it. Doci great example of somebody who does it for the art and produces Pretty, most independent artists are doing it for the art. Yeah. Like, Okay. A lot of them, let not say this a lot. A, a majority Kendrick whole side of that battle was preaching the art.


The art side. That's good. Yeah. There are people that do it for the art. But then look what it turned into while doing it for the art. Look what it turned into. Well, if he didn't take It there, I think it remained pretty artistic all the way through. For Him. For him. But, but then look what it, it, the waters can get muddy. Sure. You know what I mean? And it can sorta make the art look different. Art don't necessarily gotta be rosy. True, True. Yeah. Listen, there's 6 million ways to die. Choose. Choose one. Like everybody's story is not gonna be the same. Everybody path not gonna be the same. Yeah. What's for you ain't gonna be for me. There's a whole bunch of different ways to do this.


You go sit by yourself or with your team and figure, figure out the best way for you. What aligns with you? What won't feel out pocket for you? What won't have you losing sleep at night? What won't have you getting fucked? What are you comfortable With? Yeah. You, you who are you? First question. Find out who you are, what are you, what are you cool with? What are you comfortable with? Go from there. This may be a I I'll ask you later maybe. No, ask me Shelan, Because I don't wanna ask you anything too personal. 'cause I hear how you talk about things when you, okay. Did the industry, were you, did you always suffer from depression when you were younger? Or did the industry be Yes.


Okay. Did, alright. So you answered my question. Yes. I was gonna say, did the industry lead you to depression? No. No, no, no, no. I came in with mine. You Came in with depression strapped Up. Got it. Okay. Full, fully loaded clips of depression. Got it. You can exacerbate it, But it wasn't cool to be depressed. Yeah. And I don't think well trendy, I don't think. Yeah. It wasn't, wasn't trendy. Wasn't audiences for that. And the ain't nobody want hit that shit. Didn't know how to handle kids going through that. Got it. But you was just too early and they maybe made it worse. That's it. Okay. You was just too early. I came in. But you came in with depression. Oh yeah. I Came in with mine buddy. You was too Strap up.


Fully loaded. Dude, I'm Strapped in. My final thought on this too is the way these labels are shrinking now, who, it's a scarier proposition to be there now than it's ever been. Facts. That's true. They're firing everybody. That means you're getting less of the services that he's talking about in the tweet. You might get shelved completely. Yeah. And then your hands are bound and you can't put shit out unless the label says so true. Yeah, True. Nasty. Nasty. And today It is to a point like Parks was just saying the labels might have to prove to the young hot up and coming artists what they can do. Right. What can you do for me? Yeah. It's clear that he didn't hear Chapel R's speech when she won the Grammy.


Like she laid it out as a young artist, you know, being shelved at a major and then dropped during pandemic. Like she laid it out. So Yeah. Yeah. Everybody's not cool with getting the smallest fraction of a penny. Right. That, that's really it. Which Is less than a penny because that's what a stream is. The smallest fraction of a fraction of a penny. Oh Yeah. A fraction of a penny. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Everybody don't sign up for that math? Nope. 15% of 0 cents per stream. I got it. We got it. At least, lemme get my 0.01. Can't even go sell out the trunk no more. God damnit.


Some niggas can't. Yeah, you Can. Some niggas sell out the trunk now. Yeah. A lot of people sell a lot of vinyl and CDs and merch. So they do that shit out the trunk still. Yeah. It's tough. One of 'em niggas called me slipping the other day. I bought it. Yeah. I Bought it. Was it depression? Was it depression? It just on something. I don remember where you was. I was there, been there at one point. I, I got it. I'm not, I'm never listening to this. But You, what you pay five ain't Gonna buy. Was it a cd? Huh? It was a cd. It was like a little T drive Or some shit. Well actually, actually what the story I was just talking about? It was a sweatsuit. Oh, okay, Okay. But then as I was talking, I remembered that I did buy the CD of my man and Issa the other day.


He was like, yo, I got an album that just came out. It's one of the best albums ever. If you listened to it, I promise you'll wanna talk about it. I was like, all right, what's your name man? I, I'll get it, I'll buy it. And I bought it. I didn't hear it yet, so I can't comment on it. But yeah, I bought it. If they catch me in a good mood, Yeah, I, I'll get 9, 9, 9. Yeah. I'll still buy it. Or 49.99 for the sweat, whatever it was. But if you just catch me on the, I'm moving. Yeah. Nah, I'm moving. Oh yeah. Sorry. Sorry buddy. Sorry buddy.

She's engaged to Tom Collins. Yeah she engaged to Spider-Man. Superman. Yeah Spider-Man. Yeah. While We on these messy topics, I just want to get, go through a quick little rant. I've, I've changed my thinking on that little young girl that keep talking about Future every other day. I think that this is a rollout. You seen he got an album coming. I know he got an album becoming, coming, coming. I don't know why I can't talk today. I know he got an album coming but future's cooler than this future would not pick the young girl that's gonna run her mouth, spread all the business.


And then when she made the phone call and he answered on the first ring, It is like I don't believe he's moving like that in real life. We done seen Future move around in real life too long for me, me to believe he got caught up like that. I don't believe it. I think that that's rollout and they getting ready for a album and it just is shit to make us say oh my god. Toxic, toxic Future player. Oh yeah, no I'm not rolling with it. I don't believe it. Don't believe none Of that. But the future gotta do that. Especially after the year. He just had last year Something hell you do when you gotta do it. I don't think he has to do anything. I think future. That's only reason why I didn't call this rollout. Like after the year he had How do we know that future is not matured past the music that we're used to hearing from him? We don't know shit. No. No. Why? We don't know.


'cause you get to keep doing shit like this. Yeah. Yeah. We just got three albums last year and it Yeah but when I heard that first album, the first one was the rap one. Right. Yeah I heard that shit. I was like yeah I ain't gonna lie man. Future might be maturing and he come came out with the RB album. I was like oh not mind shoot that to shit. I just don't know how mature future looks. I don't believe that little story is all I'm saying number one. Number two, I know both Yandy and Menis so I don't wanna talk about it but boy have I been laughing at this Yandy clip forever. So Yandy got a clip on love of hip hop with some woman that's coming up to her and showing her yo my niece, my my niece. Your husband was DMing my niece.


I don't talk about this 'cause I know both of 'em but this is just too funny. Your husband was DMing my niece. She look, look, look.

Did you see the one with Nick Cannon? No. Okay. It's a Good episode. Is that in season two? I think so. Yeah. No, I watched the one where they bit off of the movie that we talked about with the the sexy robot. The sex robot. Yeah. Subservient. Yeah. So this one is with two black people. That one. So the wife is working. She's a professional. She don't have time to fuck him. He's asking for pussies. She's like, no, she gets him a intimacy companion Lie right there. Black people that ain't happening.


Go Ahead and at and at first he's offended. 'cause I asked you for some pussy. I didn't ask you to gimme a robot. But he gets the robot. The robot is fine. They start fucking, the robot is good at it. She get jealous of the robot anyway. Not to spoil alert. She ends up killing the husband because he fell in love with the robot. With the robot that she bought him. And then when she went to court, they, they changed the footage to make it look like the robot killed the husband. Ooh. And she got off. Ooh, ooh, it's Friday horrible. Black man didn't do nothing and he's dead. Well we know that's black man. That's all Bullshit. Anyway. I spotted Mad Lies. Just from you telling the story.

I hate when they asked you that question you have to answer now I gotta lie. What y'all was doing. Oh no, I was just, That's how they caught. That's how they caught Mr. C. Rest in peace. In peace, Rest in peace. But that is how they caught Mr. C. Mr. C would not get some privacy. That nigga was at the junction in the guard. No tent ain't the cop was like, Which Tom Moving on. No, I'm not. Don't put the camera on me For real. After he got caught the first time he was stealing in the street.


When like, all right man, that he was in his bag. That's my nigga, man. I love Mr. C. What? I ain't turn on him like hip hop did when that shit happened. Fuck y'all talking about nigga. That's my man. But come on. He was a good guy. Get a room, man. Probably could have got in a hotel room At Love. Tried in hindsight at Lover tried to line you. Here's the thing. At Lover tried to line you Because we was making Mr. C jokes when it first happened. And then I ended up at a, he used to run a radio station, like an internet radio station that him and my man's had. So I'm doing my man's show, shout out to Gotti. And at Love was present 'cause he's like the owner of the station. So Gotti announcing me or whatever and he was like, I saw him look over and go, That's a bitch.


He's like, yeah, next thing I know, he had some people come try to lock me in the room. I'm like, girl bro. Because he, he was like, I ain't appreciate he was saying that all of that shit when it, because this is when it first came out was false and everybody making jokes. He, he was like riding for his mans And had a problem with it. I love that all the C'S friends was riding for, they was riding. I absolutely loved that they was riding high. 97 family was riding. It was, I love that because again, at that time in hip hop, hip hop's response wasn't as sensitive and delicate as It is today. They was handling C harsh, crazy. It was, you don't know what could help lead to somebody's mental state in a certain way.


Mental wasn't a A thought back then. The shit You say how it could affect somebody. Wasn't nobody thinking about that.
