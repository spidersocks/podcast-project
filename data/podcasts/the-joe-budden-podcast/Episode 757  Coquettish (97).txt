But when it comes to exposing, I do have some messy shit that caught eye. Let me mind somebody else. Tamar Braxton's business. What the hell she did? This is good. So Tamar Braxton apparently is separated from her husband and they have been for however many months the Hus.


But they're still friends Actually lemme just let him say it. It Doesn't Really seem That way. No, no. They are still friends. Okay. They are still friends. He was going outta town. He went to New Orleans for a funeral. He was seeing the family. He was seeing the friends. His heart was heavy. He needed to stay an extra day to reset. Understandable. To reset and get his mind right. Underst understandable. Well we've all been there. Yeah, we all been there. For sure. Gotta Get that mind right. Yeah. According to Tamar Braxton, someone called from the hotel and said, Hey, are you here? 'cause your card is getting bust down here. Okay.


You know I initially was gonna take the high road in this Situation. Never take the high road, low road. The reality is I cannot keep getting attacked. Can't, my character can't defend Yourself. I can't keep being thrown under the bus because someone can't control their anxiety. It's a long clip. But I'm letting it play because I'm here to break it down for you. These Delusional thoughts about things that aren't real. Gotta say that. When, you get cold with a chick. I'm in no way wanting to attack anybody. My purpose in, in my life has always been to Protect. Give us your life's purpose. I haven't ran to social media every time something happened to me in that relationship. That's true.


It is, trust me, with all the receipts and all the things that have happened, I could have When I chose to do what a real man does. And That is protect the person that I've been with in this situation. I'll be very clear. I've been single for the last six months. Well we have been trying to identify what that looks like. Come on. We All been here one chapter. We go figuring out what it's like to be friends again. Friends again. I've been very specific about my boundaries. I've been very specific about where we stand as friends. Okay. Go date. Anybody you want. I'm gonna date When. I'm ready. I am emotionally unavailable to you and I'm physically unavailable to you.


Now you Talking. That shit comes Up. Plans are put in place. Of course I want someone that I consider to be family to be involved in that because if anybody knows her, she is big on birthdays. I'm pausing this. So they broke up. He made his boundaries clear. Yo, I'm not there for you. And we can't fuck. Who the hell? Hello? Joey. Stacey, I love you. I'm on the air right now. Where are you? I'm in New York. Hey.

Well it's could be like nine or 10 o'clock. Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you in like nine hours. Yeah. Listen. So he's separated. He's physically and emotionally unavailable and he's allowing her to help with some birthday shit. I feel him dog. Wait, I, I'm curious. This is all in response to her credit card getting run up. No We ain't. There's way, It's interesting. He hasn't even said her name yet Though. Big on Birthday. Yeah. Ain't gonna say a name. I don't leave people on. I'm very direct. Listen, if if anything that you're doing or that you want to do comes with an agenda, I don't wanna be involved in it at all.


don don't want you to be involved in my birthday plans. don don't want you to come to Turks and Caicos. This is not a reconciliation time. Whatever you decide you're doing It is because we're friends and because I'm still being involved in my son's life, I still would love for you to have a relationship with my children. I'm pausing it. Oh, can we point out the cat? He, He's he, he, he ran Nigga is Hibachi cooking right now? Nah, he, he's ringing him crazy. That nigga is hibachi cooking. He recapping. Who care? He capping. But he, he, I Don't know who Capp I don or I don. He lying. Is that we we do know 'cause we met we nigga he's cabb. That's not True. don don't know that nigga. I've said we've said all that Before, dog. If you went through a bad breakup with your shorty or your baby mom or somebody, you're trying to maintain a friendship and now you going out of town, you about to turn it up for your birthday.

But you saying to her, yo do not think that this mean we getting back together or we fucking or none of that. I'm still doing my numbers. That's what he's saying. Without saying it so far. No, that's Exactly what he's Saying. That's leading somebody on. Is it because he knows the only reason why she's continuing to do It is 'cause she's waiting to rekindle something. Yes, for Sure. I'm letting it rock. But not to the extent that you make up these stories that aren't real. I went to New Orleans. Here we go. I booked My room at Four Seasons here. We on booking.com. Four seasons booking com for the funeral. Nigga Realize the card I'm using Four Seasons, eight for funerals.

There's mad shit wrong here. No, I don't see nothing wrong. There's mad boundaries aren't being respected. What's the mad shit? Well this one I champion but if by some chance your ex's card is on foul for incidentals, run it up. Oh you talking about Run it up. That's foul. One two. If you outta town at the Four Seasons and a fresh breakup, you have to know that your ex is I spy.

She might have went to the spy store. you know this go That SoundsLikeDen her problem. I'm asking you what he did that was Mad Foul. Yeah, Well his explanation about the card was a little fuzzy. He Said he did it on booking.com. He'd said that part. But then what was the $900 in a previous Trip? He said they had a previous trip. Same fall, last fall or something like that. Said they had a previous trip booked. And so So how does this result in the hotel calling her about her credit card? Don Never called her. She called hotel. She made that up. She lying. Hotel call Like you be doing Lying.


She's lying. She's lying. Hotel can't call you with Anybody at the fourth seasons. I'm not seeing anybody. Didn't wasn't on a date. None of that. As a white guy it was you're my friend. What do I have to hide about that? Why do you SoundsLikeDen that Like a brother? Like cool. I'll just say cooler heads didn't prevail and next thing you know I'm on her story and I'm being accused of things which are just blatantly not true. I have never led Tamar Braxton on. I never will nor will I. I'm poisoning this. That nigga's Not So white. And I might be done with this but yo, I ain't gonna lie. When you in the four Seasons trying to get your shit off with the side. There's nothing more annoying than your last previous girl hitting the internet and making the young lady that you did would feel uncomfortable.


And that's not your side. 'cause technically I'm single. I can do that. Want I'm single. Yeah, yeah. But there's is grace period For six months, No Body single for six months. If I Go book a woman, I Can't believe You'all are defending this guy. Joe. If I go book a room with four Season what he do wrong? You haven't said anything that he's done wrong yet. Not one thing he Didn't do nothing wrong. Did I need the Four Seasons to go to a, a funeral? Four seasons? Yes. If He is used to staying in luxury, You fucking ain't right. Yes. Cool. Now my excuse is I book an extra day 'cause I just need the mall and I just need to mourn. I need to go through my thing fam. Reset. Reset. There are reset. He, If he booked four extra days, that's his fucking business. No, he's single.


You're a misogynist. I'm not a misogynist. This one, What is he talking about? It is Because if it was reverse you, if it was revers, You wouldn't be saying I'm Aandra. No, I'm joking. Oh yeah. I'm saying like, yo dog, he didn't do nothing wrong. I Don't think he did either. I'm single dog. I could stay here for an extra week if I want. Now if I pay your money back. 'cause what happened was when she did the booking.com, if it was her card booking.com emailed her the confirmation. That's how she knew where the fuck he was at. Yeah. Okay. So then She didn't call. So now he didn't call, they didn't call you email doc. I mean the email came over for the confirmation. It's possible. Now she gonna get on, He know about This Shit. She gonna get on her spot. Shit. And that's how she know where he at? You Talking This shit nigga. He been through a couple of those, but I haven't been through it.


Shit. Your ass. Yo. But I'm just saying I don, don don't see nothing that he did. So, I don't see none of this nigga did wrong. They now, if they was broke up a month, cool, cool. You can't go fuck another girl and swipe your ex's card. Yes, You can. No you shouldn't. You should not swipe Your ex's card. You Shouldn't I Don. Y'all think y'all could go fuck another girl on your ex's dime? No. And she gonna act cool. No, I'm not agreeing with that. So then, So then when she don't act cool, Women do it. No, what I'm saying I'm not, I'm outside of that piece. I'm just asking you what he did wrong so far. Him using Shorty's card. If it was an honest mistake, it was an honest mistake. You're my friend. If it wasn't an honest mistake, mistake. Pardon me. Gimme my fucking money back. And we all good. But as far as him fucking shorty, We've been separated for six.


For six months. Yeah. We are now determining that we are friends, we have a child. I can go fuck whoever I want to go. Fuck there It is and that's it. Okay. It sounds to me, me like y'all fall for the, alright, let's just maintain the friendship line. No reason the boundaries not Respected. It SoundsLikeDen, y'all fall for that line when women still wanna be with you, but you're going through a rough pass. So she like, let's just, let's just re get to know one another. we on a friendship. It is a trick nigga. No, I Know. It's a trick. And, and you're tricking yourself into you trick. That's you. You ain't tricking me. You tricking yourself. I know what this is. Yeah. You surprising me right now. What are you talking about? If two adults sat down on the table and had communication, they were intentional about where they were headed and where they were going and what they wanted.


If he told shorty like, yo, we working on this. That's one thing he said. He clearly told her, we are not, we're not together. We're not together. Mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, nothing. Joe, you've 100% said that to someone Before. Said what? Or at least allowed them to think that the, the, the mending of a friendship was going to be what It is. And you've used it to your advantage. I think every guy here at some point has done that. I misled women. Right. I don't think he misled her though. He's let it be known that he's physically, physically, emotionally, I, don, all of these things. Nothing. Okay, so hold on. Wait, wait. We're only, we're getting the second half of the story before the first half of the story. So she must have gone the fuck off about something. Tamar Went off and I'm not gonna play that because it's mad long and already played extra Long clip.


Okay, so I'm just wondering like he's stating that her problem is, is that she doesn't wanna recognize the boundaries. She doesn't wanna give up on the relationship, blah blah blah. I have a feeling that her real problem is the fucking credit card. Her credit card being used on a room to house another bitch. Once that happens, your ex is allowed to wild out. Even if it's not reasonable. He can do whatever the fuck he wants. But you can't do it on my dime on my credit card and be, oh whoops. We're not talking About that I don care what? We're Not Stick it stick into the story right now and we're the facts of this particular story. That's not the facts. 'cause he said he wasn't with no bitch. She made up the bitch. Right. And he Also said, I got you to No, he was with a girl and the girl has responded. Oh Who's They? I'm saying what he said This woman made, She's showing the Ds some Very, very false accusations.


She lemme see against me. Yeah. What flavor is she and Who you guys call the KFC man? They're untrue. Have never met this man in my life. This woman has called me a tramp. The infamous tramp. Back to that baron Trump point. And She's, she sound a little slow but niggas are still meeting up to fuck With her. Sometimes the slow curl is ice. Slow be ice, you know the slow, slow, slow. Be fast. They ain't got too much to say A fire that's And they get right out. Yeah, they get right out.


No, no worry. They need it. See they, what is wrong with you? See they, they don't stay. See they don don't stay. No, they walk. They walk. They walk in the bus, they walk in, they walk to school. Made it this way here. They gonna spend the night in front of the school. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It'd be 42 in school. Oh. Shit. You can't say that. Alright, so y'all don't care all fuck it. No we don't care man. I thought that was a little, I thought that was way juicier. But she said that she ain't meet the nigga to go fuck a girl and use your ex's card. He said he gonna pay her back and then gaslight her. It's too late. He ain't gonna pay her back. She said that matters. Yes, Got it. Who said he fucked her?


He, the girl said she never met the exact girl. The girl says that he slid in her dms. That's it. She's never met the man. She does not know him. Okay. And she said, and she said he erased a bunch of the dms so he can't show. So she can't show what he was on. I didn't pop. Yeah. Alright. Fuck. Y'all don't care. SoundsLikeDen a smooth cri bitch. Listen, y'all don't care. I don't care. God damnit.

They was interviewing a nigga Mahomes talking about Taylor Smith. Taylor Swift, my nigga. I don't want to hear that. I'm kind of used to that one. I took away. Travis Kel got a stupid ass bowl cut, He pissed.

That is true. He Was unequivocally it's a lie.


That's what he said. Yeah. Something to that effect. No, he had his PR team say, hey we're gonna aggressively pursue the person that leaked these documents. Like dog, you leaked the fucking document. Don don't think they leaked them. Somebody leaked them. Oh yeah. Yeah. Somebody that had access to 'em leaked them. I 100% know and believe these types of relationships and contracts to exist. Why? Why would Kelsey and Taylor Swift be any different? Yeah, yeah. I'm not disagreeing with it. I'm just saying I don't think they would Leak. I don't think the breakup date is gonna remain the same. Yeah. But I do think that there's a contract. Listen, When, you get two high profile people together like that. There's a contract. Yeah, For sure. It is a contract. When you get pregnant.


That's It is a contract. When we start dating, it's a contract for the break. It's a contract for everything. That's Crazy. Yeah. I like Travis Kel when we was fucking with black girls, he gotta go back. I don't like this one. That's the other reason you know that this contract is real. Yeah. we know what Travis Kel, You know what he like, she even like wearing express. She made him go get that stupid New Hampshire white boy haircuts. Yeah. Yeah. We we gotta take 'em back to the Dominicans. Yeah. Crazy sir. What That nigga haircut look crazy. Not Dominicans. The stash is the thing that threw me off. Nah bro. The whole thing, the whole, the hairline, the stash is just added. The third K. How you got lower hair with added the third K. That shit was fucked up dog. That shit look, it looks like he put the helmet on him and cut around it. It don't even look like dance no more.


Like hell got no swag. Swag no more. No nothing. That nigga look crazy. I'd be interested to see when couple, when people do that, they change their whole style depending on who they dating. Yeah, It happens a lot. JLo. Well, JLo JLo don't change her style for nobody. You crazy. How Mark Anthony, she wouldn't wear nothing sexy. He wasn't playing that shit. She was out there looking like a nun. Well he Puerto Rican So I answering Her question. But no, she doesn't change the style. She, I think she tries to attract the, the, the consumer that she wants by who she dates. So she, when she wanna get back in the good graces of the Latino Community, that nigga said Mark Anthony wasn't playing none of that sexy, revealing none of that shit. She was out there looking like Laura Engles losing shit.


Laura Engles the fuck you talking about nigga, fuck you talking about? I didn't know JLo and Mel out there doing the same shit. Twirling around in the miniskirts trying to show some vintage ass. Yo, what the fuck is vintage, vintage Ass? you know Mel walking her dog in Lincoln Park talking. I'm throwing that ass in a circle. Throw that Ass in a star girl. It is 9:00 AM Sit down you and that dog. Let's see, let's see, let's see. Y'all wanna get to the sad stuff. We got Rich homie Quan, we have the, the mass shooting in, in Georgia. Mm. Yeah. We need to pay respects to Rich homie Quan.


We do. We have to. We can't go any further without doing that. Please rest in peace, rich homie. Quan very sad thing. I got a phone call. I was like, yo, you seen what happened? I was like, nah. He was like, yo Rich, rich homie, Quan died. One of the last things you expect to hear. But then it's just what's happening. People are losing their lives. The nine one one call was traumatic. I didn't like listening to that. I hate neighbor shit gets released. They need to stop that. Yeah. They need to stop doing that. It's just sad. Sad. But I'm also, like I said, I'm in the mode of just celebrating those, those people who need to be celebrated in these moments. I don't want to put the gloom over it so the family's going through enough at this point, feel like we need to uplift and give some positivity to the situation.


So Just tough to do in the moment. I know It Is just tough to do in the moment. 34 years old. So Young. Yeah, young. 34 years old. B King, 39, fab Man School 53, all very, very, very young. All with children. That's the other part that tugs at the heartstrings every time I read it. Yeah. My heart goes out to the people that are, that find these people in that state. Yeah, True. Their, their fans, friends, family, loved ones. Like right before a birthday, rich homie Quan's birthday was coming up in October.


Oh wow. October 4th. I want to say shit. Like that's the type of shit that I can't, I, I can't imagine, imagine planning for your birthday, looking forward to something and then, and then this happens. I'm happy his kids didn't have to actually realize what had happened. 'cause I, I think they said the, the girlfriend had f left them on the couch. She went to go take the kids to school and She went to take, I'm happy at that point. They didn't have to actually experience that moment, even though no matter what's traumatizing to them But yeah. To, to find your parent In the condition that he was in. Yeah. No. But then the word gets out so fast, you know what I'm saying? Like we were talking about that with, with Batman scoop. How quick the word gets out before the family can even, you know, kind of grasp, grasp and process.


you know. So it would be a shame if they found out like another way, You know. No, IIII mean from that perspective, what took place with him, you would rather I think maybe hearing it than the kids visualizing that. For sure. Seeing it, you know what I mean? Because they said he was foam out the mouth. Whatever the case may be. You don't want your children to see that that stays burned in their memory forever. So, you know what I mean? Like that. Ugh. It's a little difficult. It is, You don want your girlfriend to find you like that either. Nobody, I'm just saying. But if you had a choice, yeah. It is both fucked up and, but you Don't want your kids. And I had to try to feel, find a glimmer of hope here, which I'm not sure there is one, but it it read to me like he passed peacefully.


Of course. I don't know that. Right. And the cause of death is yet to be determined. I know there's rumors going around. I don't wanna report on rumors. I'd rather wait till there is a toxicology and and we do this the right way. But so loved so young. What A fucking era of music he gave us. Yeah. That's Was reminded. That's the thing thing. That's the first thing that hit me. Me too. I was reminded of how on fire he was at a certain point. Like him, him and Thug collab was just, that was my freshman year of college. That was amazing. First week. Oh, I know you was lit, Huh? I know you was lit For sure. That was a good time of music. Hell Yeah. It was a good time.


Barron Davis Barron Trump flow. No nigga Never, never. He can't fuck with Baron Trump. Barron Trump can't fuck with Me. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Baron. Handle you. And his same night. Pause. Yo, same Night. Same night. Same fight. Pause Baron. But anyway, listen. Enough about Baron Trump. No, just rest in peace to him and his family. For sure. Prayers. My heart goes out to anybody out there that you know, you know, we go through a lot. We go through a lot. We endure a lot, a lot of us self-medicate again, I don't know the official COD with him, but just, and even in my own personal experience, like when people pass, no matter what they pass about, no matter what the reason they pass is I, I always just thank God that my turbulent times was a few years ago before you were unable to tell what you were getting in the street.


Yeah. That's what, that's that's what I feel comfortable saying. Saying I can't imagine today copping the way that I copped and, and using as many, using his pills as I used having to. No, my paranoia would make me think that something was going on. My paranoia alone would make me wanna almost quit doing that. And again, I won't speak on him. It, but this is just where early death brings, brings me. Can I, can I say the a big thing that bothers me in these moments too is, is when people who are either directly connected or somewhat indirectly connected to these people that pass, they try to turn these moments into things about them.


Absolutely hate it. I hate that People love to insert themselves into a tragedy because every, because it's splashed all over social media and that sort of thing. So it like, it gives them engagement and it gives them attention. It's a really sick form of like hate seeking validation, chasing clout, chasing People try to monetize off of it or they try to attach themselves to a moment in passing, I think is some of the most disgusting shit I do. Oh, you Agree? I agree with you a hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. Young lady came out and, and you know, she said some things. That is the wrong time. Erica Banks. Yeah. Wrong time. Nobody gives a fuck. Nobody cares. Like It is not about you, it's about the family.


And we have to have that respect. Listen, if I go and if there any, and if there's any news that come out about me Jr you know what to do. I'm not with that. It's not about that. I'm not trying to make a joke. But it's not about, it's not about the person bitch. I don't give a fuck. Like you was a secret for a reason. you know what I'm saying? And don't take that time to now bring it to the public. you know, 'cause it causes a whole bunch of emotions. you know what I'm saying? And they're talking about Erica Banks are releasing text messages and writing a caption just talking about how close her and Thug were. I mean, not her and Thug. Her and Rich homie Quan were, there were pictures that were dmss crazy and she got killed.


She got killed online because they're saying, so if you were a secret before then be a secret now, like bad time to do this. The human side of me say how can you tell somebody how to mourn? But I think my opinion changed on that once I learned that his girlfriend is the one that found him on, on the couch, put the blanket over him because it get cold. Like, come on. I Think it just depends on the type of You. if you, if you posting dms or texts, I think that's probably overboard. But if you just posting pictures, yo, we had a bond or whatever. Like I don't see a problem With with that. Yeah, she could, she Could have pictures is fine. You can do that. Could could warn without saying, Hey, we was fucking right. Let's, we come from the era where nigga the funeral home Got, it shaken when a nigga that passed away, his other girl is there, or his sneaky l come pay respect and they whooped her ass out that funeral.


No, no, no. You was the main girl till you figured out he had a wife. Exactly. And let's just stop saying everyone's mourning. Some people ain't mourning. Some people real, they might like the person, they might have an attachment. But some people in that moment aren't mourning. They're just looking for fucking attention. That to me is a moment where you're looking for attention. That's not mourning. I, I, I like it's, it's very easy to attach that with the mourning process. Oh, everyone mourns differently. No, this was personal. This is something that you look to gain in this moment for whatever reason. No, I do believe she was mourning. I don't believe So I do Believe she was hurt as well. I do believe she was mn I believe she was, she was hurt. I do believe she was hurt as well. If the things that you're saying Fucked up, I just think she wouldn't about him wrong. If the things that you're saying for one are outing him and his death and also gonna affect the people that were near and dear to him on a day-to-day basis, you're not mourning.


It's always the intent. You're doing some selfish shit. Your intent is to go ahead and make it more about you in that moment than the other person. But that's not, Not intent, that don't speak to somebody intent. That's just what's happening. Okay. That's the, that's the result. Yeah. Okay. But Somebody's intent could, intent Was intent could have been good. That's the shit to the world that I was fucking this nigga while he was in this situation. Nah, it's interpretation Now. Yo. When, when, when, when men are alive and the sneaky link be trying, they best to fucking out some shit. And what happens? I'm alive. They go in the bathroom and take a picture of your medicine cabinet or that one mirror or your dog or your cat or your couch. The cabinet in that bathroom. I'm telling you what girl, that's Your bag. you Right. Listen, there's plenty of people that's alive. Alive. That true you right. That is telling the sneaky link on the side.


Yo, hold it down. But they don't really want to. So if you die, I imagine that person will be sad. One and two. I imagine that person will want to be expressive. That Honor Me though. I'm not saying that that she did. Right. I'm not on her side with that. Can we get back to that topic later as far as what makes the sneaky link want to expose the nigga? I wanna talk about that later. 'cause I have a theory. But I understand what you're saying, Joe. At the same time, It is better When. you hold it down in death. You gonna be saluted. We love you. We respect you. Just hold it down. You can mourn. But all that extra shit I don't think is appropriate. I'm torn. Yo. I mean they Had a bond. Yeah. You can't, there's no way You can tell 'em how to, And I'm gonna keep it a buck as a nigga.


That's been a side dude. I've also had side chicks. Sometimes your relationship with the sides be stronger than the relationship with the one at home. So you can't necessarily tell somebody that they can't mourn somebody so, So near and dear to your heart. Why can't you just keep it there? Why does it have, why does it have to be broadcast? The world don't so When you die so When, you die. The the relationship shouldn't still be honored the way it was honored When, you was living so because you dead and you no longer walk the earth, I now get the chance to just say, well fuck the, the, the relationship we had at already. Like I can just throw all that shit to the side and still not honor your Relationship. No, I'm saying that when somebody pass away, we can't necessarily tell somebody how they can express themselves when that happens. So You right.


you know what I'm saying? But, but you right. But if I love you and I honored the relationship we had and we had it this way for a reason why because you die means I no longer honor it that way. Because people when they're emotional don't necessarily use they logical praying emotions and logic are kind of, that's, you know what I mean? I don't know. I mean I wouldn't do it, but I'm not knocking nobody that does it. I'm Told with Ish, because It is a matter of that don't mean that she's trying to be disrespectful. She just, she felt everybody if to that case, nobody should post. When a person passes away, you tell, you can't tell a friend how to mourn. Some mourns might, friends might over mourn then the family members.


So It is really a matter of just whatever your preference is. Like We, we diss people when they be like, yo, I just spoke to you last night, blah blah blah blah blah. That might be really how nigga feeling. Like y'all might have just hung up the phone with you last night at one o'clock in the morning. I get a phone, a text message at seven o'clock that you no longer here. Somebody might want to express, yo, I just spoke to you at one o'clock. We was talking about what we gonna do this weekend about going to see the game. That just might be the emotions flooding out. But there's no consideration of the fact that this information that you're putting out into the public is going to now double time negatively affect his girlfriend and his children. Like it's just to me, I'm not, again, I'm not defending it. What I'm saying is we can't tell them that they're wrong.


Okay. No, we can. Okay. No, we can. I disagree. I do think it's tagless. Yeah, that's that. That's all. It might not be. I Think there's a way to do it. I'm not saying that she wasn't mourning But. yeah, I do. I do. Thinkless. I think Ning, I think Atlanta. Atlanta. Man, man, man man. Young thug young. That's the thing about going away, do some time full of whip. But it's not, it's not for sure that things will be the same When you come out and that you'll see the same people and faces Saw the picture that Quavo posted. Yeah, I did. I did. Everyone heart was heavy. Yeah. That whole day was tough for me. Yeah. I, I'll be honest, I'll from the second I started seeing people in abundance say, no way, this your rich homie Quan shit is true.


I kept seeing that. I kept seeing that. And When, you see that for too long. I just brace up. I get scared, I get nervous and yeah, it was unfortunate, unfortunate news from from there. I'm speechless man. I feel like every time this happens to to, to an artist, a part of me gets, just leaves with it. I do. 'cause we all, we we all have a shared experience. Well the artist, right? Yeah. Like we have the experience of city to city studio sessions, the collaborations, the getting fly with the behind the scenes people seeing records take off, seeing records not take off. Seeing albums do well, seeing albums not do well.


Fucking self-medicating fucking just trying to survive, stay alive, be strong so You can walk back in the house and be the best version of yourself for your significant other and and for your kids. Mm. I mean, We talk about that all the time up here about what dudes have to face when they leave the house and what they have to do to show up as the best representative of themselves. And it seemed like he was doing that, trying to, I met him before. Great guy, polite guy, sweet guy. He seemed like he was right back in the, in the resurgence of his groove of his career. Like getting back in his groove, getting active. So for to happen at that moment, God damn heartbreaking man.


Well he made the impact that he needed to make 100% important. Yeah. I wanna focus on that. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the music. Thank you for the moments. You had a great run that, that won't be forgotten at all. Yeah. Thank you for your service. Thank you for the feel good moments. Oh man. Thank you for the music. Just thanks. Just, just thanks. I'm, I'm sad I'm speechless over this. I I I wish I were in better spirits to be able to be more communic communicative, but I'm not. I'm not. Yeah. Let me cue up. Cue up. Outstanding. Yeah man, again, with the recent news about fat man scoop and, and BK we'll wait on word for rich homie Kwan.


But I want to urge y'all out there. Hit your checkups. Yeah. Hit your primary physician again with blood clots and all that. It's, it can be symptomless, You can be walking around feeling totally fine and then be in a totally different position the next minute. Learn CPR Like listen. Yeah. Keep, I mean if it doesn't end up being a chemical thing, then get Narcan and get testing strips that are available. Yeah. Get the fentanyl test. Yeah. Fentanyl test thing of me jiggy. That fentanyl shit is the scariest shit in the world.


It is every, every 10, 20 years some new shit hit the street. That is the scariest shit in the world. Rest in peace. Rich. So excited.


Maybe I played that early. Yeah, It is 'cause it's gonna get dark again. You did. That's what I was trying to get your attention. But that's All right. We'll play it again. Yeah, we'll play it again. Fuck y'all. One of y'all do it. Oh well. Well, So there was another school shooting. This one was in Georgia and it was committed by a 14-year-old kid. His name was Colt Gray. Two students passed away. I heard that. A third one. 'cause there was 30 people who were injured. I heard a third student passed away from his injuries not confirmed. Two teachers passed away. He just had his first day in court. And the judge let him know that the death penalty is on the table because they're trying him as an adult.


But in the most recent events, his father has now been charged with eight, I believe eight counts with all 'em same charges. All the same charges. So let me just, It is four counts have involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children. So this happened in April. So there was a school shooting in Michigan. The kid's name was Ethan Crumbley. His parents were indicted and convicted. They both faced over, they, they both faced up to 15 years. I think they got at minimum 10 years because they provided the weaponry. They also knew that their kid was, you know, showing signs of mental health issues or whatever the case was.


And that he'd made mention that this was something that he was going to do. So this is a new thing that's happening. It's a new trend that seems to be happening where parents are now being respon held responsible for their kids' actions because his father bought him the AR 15 for a Christmas gift. I can't wrap my mind around a parent buying a child an AR 15. I, I can't, I don't get it. And so, well that happens, Especially in the south, especially in certain states where guns are hunting in non more liberal, in non-urban centers. It's common way more liberal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Toward gun, gun stuff. That being said, Then allowing them to have access to it, it SoundsLikeDen Yes.


Is really the bigger issue of Yes. Okay, fine. Maybe you're a 14-year-old and you wanna go out hunting with your dad and it's rifles and you practice shooting an AR 15 to a 14-year-old as a Christmas gift. I'm sorry I rule or not, I can't wrap my mind around it anyways, my whole point is that I think that the trend of holding the parents responsible, knowing when your child is exhibiting signs, there, there was no secret here. This kid was crying out for help. He was expressing mental health issues for the last year. And his aunt is quoted as saying all the adults in his life failed him. I'm like, lady, you count as that. You are, you are somebody who failed him as As well.


We don't, we don't know how much we know the relationship she had or I don't, don don't wanna go that far. But It's, it's for her to be able to say that he has been crying out for help and looking for help, et cetera. And she is a part of the family. I'm lumping her into the category of somebody else, including Herself in that I got nephews and nieces if they go do some Fuck shit. Yeah. I don't wanna be up into that. Yeah, I don't wanna be putting That. Okay. Well that's basically where everything stands. The father is now facing charges and he was in court when his son was told by the judge that he's facing the death penalty and he was like crying uncontrollably. I'm like, as an adult, you're a 54-year-old man, you couldn't foresee any of this happening. It just, it's just wild to me.


And also, I don't even just the whole GLP and the NRA and their inability to, who can Foresee their kid doing it? Nobody in very small circumstances, I'm sure like with the kid from Michigan, they said, he was basically telling them, yo, I wanna do this. I'm thinking about doing this. Or he was writing letter like in that instance. Yeah, but your kid could just be a bad Kid. I think that people have to, I think what is being completely ignored in this particular, not this particular story, but ev almost every single instance, the shooter looks the exact same. It is a white boy. That is it. So if you have a white son who is, who has an obsession with guns and is having mental health issues and starts talking about fantasizing about shooting up a school, you might need to step in with some professional help.


Well, Can we add to this that around election time, this seems to be a trend. Either black person is killed, a mass shooting, any of those things is all a trend. It's almost starting to seem like a red flag. It's flag Type shit. Performative. It's starting to seem astonishing. Performative, yes. I see some auto like that. The news outlets should be held responsible as well. Because one of the victims, a young black boy that suffers from autism, they had his image floating around as he was the shooter and still have not went out and apologized for that. I didn't know that. I think, I think it's a slippery slope. We talked about this actually not too long ago. I think that, I think they're trying to set a precedent. I think they're gonna start charging all of these juveniles or minors that kill people and they're gonna start charging their parents.


And I think what they're using is these two white people as a scapegoat. Because what's gonna happen when they start charging us in the inner cities, every time a young black kid shoots somebody and they start sending their kids to jail black, they have real slippery slope to, I'm not saying that it shouldn't, if your, if your parents have prior knowledge of you having certain issues, then those issues should be addressed. I'm just saying, can we look, can Cameron In inner city not buying guns, can we, can We not lump because That's, listen what I'm saying. No, no, I hear what you're saying. No you're not. Let me finish though. So what I'm saying is I think it's a slippery slope when your kid goes out and commits a crime and we charge the parents with that, that same exact crime. I think it opens up a really, really, really, It is not the same Parents in inner cities aren't going to Walmart, Dick's sporting goods or no gun store and going to purchase these guns.


Okay. Most of these youth that you referring to When, you saying the parents start in the inner cities, some of them don't even have passports or have the means to travel to buy these guns. These guns are getting dumped in the city beyond anybody's power. So it's two different, while the urban community in danger is a serious topic, and we should talk about that, It's a false Going to buying you guns and knowing that you have these issues and you say these things in these ideologies is way different. In The case of the Michigan, That's what You're saying. It's not what I'm saying. It's not even remotely. I understand What It is saying. It's just saying that it's a slippery slope because if you start charging these people's parents, the school shooter's, parents and You can start charging other people's Different angle.


I do think There's different, because these are legally bought guns And they're legally bought guns. Every state you could go to Richmond, you could go to Virginia and buy a gun. There's an inner city in Richmond. We talking about New Jersey and New York where you can't just walk in Walmart and buy a gun. But a lot of states in the United States, your parents can walk into a store and buy you a gun. How many black school shooters are there? Yep. Nevermind bro. Nine. I want to I don listen about No, let's, let's not do that. Let's not do that. We're talking, let's not do that. Let's, let's stay on the topic of this father is being held to this standard because he provided his child with the gun. Yes. That like, that's literally the meaning of why he's even set to be charged or on trial. And not Only that, and I disagree with that, Which is not even, Even if that's true, it's Not illegal. I don't think It's nothing wrong.


It's not illegal with Them people that, that live that way. Buying their kid a gun. Yeah, I don't, I don't have no problem with that. I do have a problem When, you underage kid is able to carry that weapon to school and act out fucking acts of horror. Joe. Then I think that the parent needs to be charged, Joe. Then you gotta get charged. Whatcha talking about? That's Crazy. Hold on. Wait. You don't see a problem with with providing the child with the gun? Wait, wait. But then you want them to monitor. Wait, If you live that lifestyle, wait, no, fuck that. Hold on one second. We are talking about a 14-year-old child who doesn't, who hasn't undeveloped fucking brain who does not have the fucking mental skills to reason and form logic like a fucking adult and you're gonna arm them with an assault rifle.


No. No. Fucking no, no. The reason why those parents in Michigan got fucking convicted is because of the text messages that they had with the kid. the show. They were like, he was texting them. He was texting and the mother said, the mother was like, no, I'm just, I'm just upset that you got caught. Yeah, they should have been charged. They should Have been charged. That's why I Said it. I don't accountability. I Don't, it's a totally different thing. Father should be Charged. My mother used to leave and go to work before me. My mother went to work before I went to school's. True So I. My mother would pick out clothes, iron clothes for me in the morning. I would change the whole fucking outfit of what my mother did. So if you had a gun in your house and your mother's gone to school and the father might not know that this boy took that gun to school, I don't see what they has to do to anything.


Mel's made a point that you bought your kid as you, I mean you made a, Well, Mel's premise is not, lemme talk. You made a point that you, you you, you bought your kid a gun and your gun, your kid takes that gun to school. I'm saying that could have been unbeknownst to the father. So what, so, so what So cool. Stay here. So now this is my point. We are at a slippery slope now where parents are gonna be starting to getting charged for the shit that their kids are going to do. Parent your child, I don. Dunno what you're talking about. Parent your fucking Child. No, I get, I get what he's saying. come on. No, I get what he's saying. come on bro. He's saying all right. But also we've all Had a fucking childhood. But also pose the theory this way because When, you do have guns in all of that. In homes. There's certain locks that's supposed to be had. Bullets are supposed to be kept in different locations.


There Are not storage rules. Like there, there, there's whispering called there. There there are, there are ways to prevent certain things. Now to your point, prior When, you said your mother will leave out before you. My thing is, I agree with you, but I don't like the whole charging inner city people with that because it's a different level where inner city, they're not going out and just buying guns versus the boys. Yeah. Why y'all acquaintance someone having a gun in the home, which many of us in the inner city and in suburban area have dealt with to a man buying his child a gun. It's two different things. An assault rifle. It's totally two different things. Gifting your child a gun at one. It's a different message from you just having a gun in the house for your own personal use.


It's not the same. You know why you feel like that? E 'cause you're from here. Yeah, We Don't do that. Yeah. Yeah. I grew up upstate. Listen to me, my we don't do that. Like in New York and New Jersey, you can't do that. When, you go down south. My cousins down south beat 13 and 14 years old, have guns with guns hunting with they family, shooting guns. Like it's the norm. Yes. So that's why I'm not with that premise. I, I understand the parents that wanna buy their kid a gun. Same. But if you buy your kid a gun, It is your responsibility to store it properly, load it, unload it properly. Safety unsafety, keep it away. Manage access hours. Hey, I'm giving look yo dog, when my mom brought me a fucking boom boombox for Christmas, it came with rules.


Hey, You can only listen to this at such and such time. Play it shit. It might have been locked up while she was gone. A gun. Yeah. I. don. don. Don't get it. Yeah, don't listen. If it can't go out and shoot somebody with their gun, I don't think a parent, you Know what we're missing though? The fact that he was showing signs of mental health. That's the reason the parents should be held accountable. That's the reason. That's what I said. Like he should be held accountable. It was signs there and it was being, he had a cry. He was crying out for help. That's what we are all missing. We're just stuck on the whole gun aspect. Kid being gifted gun. Not me. I'm, I'm holding, I'm holding the, I'm holding The parents Responsible because that's some nut ass shit at, at 14 you should be up making breakfast before they go to school.


Tying shoes. You should be, you should be involved in their route to school. Well That's not, they always applicable, but they should at least not have access to a fucking assault rifle. Does anyone in here think that anyone on in this country needs to have access to a AR 15? No. Yo, you and Mel, y'all keep repeating y'all's same point. We understand that. No, that's Not out. No, I'm trying to lead to a I'm you not, I mean go ahead. Down south Yes, down south. Niggas walk out with your girls. I Don't want want us to keep dancing around down south. They do this. Yes, down south North They do this. It's very common. Yes. Very common. You have eaten a steak or something that one of them little niggas have went and killed These Lacks. No the fuck I haven't. Yes You have. No I haven't. I've I've ate a steak that someone that's a part of a company of an institution have done that.


Not a little fucking kid. It's not the same thing. The access to access to that does not mean the common man should have access to it. That's not what I'm speaking. The rest of the world looks at us like we are fucking insane in this country. Mass shooting. Ha. A mass shooting happens in any other country and they focus on people not being be game. Being able to have access to guns the way that they have access to them here. The fucking use of the second amendment to justify this is fucking ridiculous. And I'm also really tired. you know We talk about the mental health of this kid, but it's always focused on the mental health of this white child. That's true. you know what I'm saying? Like That is a, I just feel like That is true. I Cut you off but I don't agree with the world because kids in the Middle East, They run around with guns.


They Kids in Africa run around with guns, With big guns and shooting at soldiers. No, we dancing around with this. Who cares about that? Let's, let's get to the rest of this. The FBI or the police that were notified last year that hey, this kid's got something spooky going on with him and we're seeing texts or signs that he wants to commit a school shooting With the Georgia kid. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That's something different. And they ignored it. They ignored that. That's right. They should be held accountable. They should be held accountable. Then the entire summer goes by and you allow that same kid to come to school first week, second week of school and act out all of that shit that he had a summer to plot on.


Yeah. I think that the police FBI or anybody that was aware of That is culpable as well. I agree. I'm not disagreeing with that. Agreed. And them teachers, one of them, they both were young. Both, they, both of those teachers were young. I don't care if they was 50. don don't care if they was 60. You took somebody life my nigga. Like I don't care what their age is. That's irrelevant. If his parents had gotten messages from the FBI saying that your kid is exhibiting certain behaviors, then yeah he should be held accountable because you ignored it. You get what I'm saying? You ignored it. So that's a totally different situation than what I was talking about. Take Take dad to jail, nigga lock dad up. Fuck dad. I ain't gonna keep going. Fuck dad. So with knowing all of that, you know, I guess we can say in closing, knowing all of that, why would you arm this child, this child with a fucking gun?


Indeed. Okay. Find the south. Y'all liked your fucking guns in the south and you buy your children guns fucking weird but whatever. But why would you arm this child knowing all of those things? That is why the father is getting fucking charged. I agree. And That is why the slippery slope doesn't really play a role here. We gonna see. No, we all, I we all agree to that point. No, the father should definitely be charged in that regard. Yeah. And I think the father purchased the gun. Yeah. Bought it for as a Christmas present. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying some, some of these places background checks, They don't. This is Buying The gun. I Know his dad is clean. It doesn't even matter clean. It don't matter what he gonna do intently.


The governor is just like thoughts and prayers again. And then there was like, you know, I Locked the whole family up. The southern gun law though doesn't do a background check. Like long as you have no criminal history, no felonies, You can get a gun. They don't know about $5 capacity. None a gun license. I know what We talk about is the norm in this country. And I'll just leave it there. Some of that norm shit needs to be knocked out. Agree. Agree. As we evolve as a people as a country, some of the things that we think are normal to us needs to get changed. And We talk about that in other realms of the world in society. I don't see why everyone keeps downplaying like, well no, that's just how it's always been. And second, no, some of This shit needs to get changed. It's a continuous pattern. Every fucking school year he's right. Every time school year come around, we back to the same election time.


Election time. Well don don't wanna just base it around But, but all throughout the year there's fucking mass shootings. It's always, As long as there's kids in school, we gonna see This shit consistently. And we gonna keep saying, well that's just the No it's Crazy. And it's crazy since the fact. It's crazy. Yeah. The fact that we can like overlook elementary school kids being murdered in school shootings. We are. We've gotten to the point where we're desensitized to This shit and I think that that was the plan. Well I mean we was desensitized to that other school shooting when the cops was telling parents not to go into You've already Yeah. But even before that I was talking about Sandy Hook. Yeah. Yeah. I just can't imagine 14-year-old kids having to drag their teacher back into the classroom because they've been shot, they heard commotion outside.


They go out there and investigate. You hear loud, pop, pop pop. You fall in the doorway and now kids in school just started have to watch the teacher die in front of them while trying to commit do fucking CPR and lifesaving techniques as a 14 year. That's A child that's traumatic. Kids Texting Kids, Texting their parents like I love you because they don't think that they're gonna make it out of their alive children. It's crazy. That's wild. That is not, that should not be a child's experience. It just shouldn't. And the cynic enemy does feel like if if this country wanted school shootings to stop then they could stop. They could stop. Yeah. They don't, I don't don don't think it.


don don't think it should be that tough. Yeah, Same sweeps. Sweeps. Weak Schools used to have metal detectors. They still do Depending on bring 'em back. You are. But look, but look at where they're placing them. They're in schools in the urban community. They're not in these places where they don't look like us. Okay. I say bring the metal detectors back instead of floating all them dumb ass ideas. Like hey make the teacher take fucking take the gun classes. Yeah. Yeah. That was, yeah. That's Ridiculous. Yeah. That's the dumbest thing I've heard. Bring the metal detectors back. It's all a matter of location. Get around them shit And you and you will have to though. No and Yeah, true. No, no you gotta make it harder.


I'm just saying the Part. But they also said that they had armed like efficiency officers in the School. That's gonna be the sad part is when they're gonna have to now start poli policing schools. Like prisons. Damn there. Where you're gonna have to really have on guard people there on a regular basis. Like When I went to school, we had security, we had 'em in my school, but we ain't have 'em. They weren't strapped up. No. We had cops in my school. We didn't have that same, we had cops In my school, Robocop offensive Tucker come right over there and light it up. We Had cops in my school. Yeah. So I. don don't know what the resolve is. I just think we need to address how all This shit looks moving forward. Period. Agree On all levels. Prayers up for all the Yes. Victims and families of victims. Classmates. s up for the school For the community.


Yeah. The entire community to school for a week. I can't, I can't even think about when that should reopen and, and how do I send my kid back to that school? Any level of confidence that they're gonna Be safe. I'm not sending my kid back to that school. I'm not gonna hold you. I don't even wanna walk down. I might Not I don to School. They may become homeschooled after that. Everybody can't afford. Yeah. Ugh. Got it got got that outstanding. Yeah. Yeah. Should on for a second. Alright, let's bring it back. That's god. Nah, this was a tough week of news. Us September be coming around heavy wars.


Hopefully we don't have to digest anything like this anytime soon. Because I'm with J Juan. Like it does kind of feel like around election year, shit starts to heat up for whatever the reason be. It's above my pay grade. But You look at the news cycle, If they wanted a to stop, it's a pattern. It feels like they would be able to make it stop. What? Make it all lot more tougher. Difficult. I don't think they can stop it though Then I don't like that. That you just going to school I and just doing this to random people.


Like you don't even have one of those. Hey, he was bullying me the whole year. He called Me Fat. So you don't have none of those stories. You just find that anybody crazy for mass Casualty? It's crazy. That was a tough two topics to get through. It was, yeah. I will be honest with y'all. I'm not even sure if Outstanding saved it.

Support child. Okay, Child. That's all I got. I don't have the name of the song. Did you hear a snippet Or Anything? Nope. No. It's just a new song dropping in support of the LGBTQ a plus community.

He was talking too much in here. Yeah nigga, he was talking too much. It changed my whole life. We on text Thread now about to build my little portfolio. I was like, what you think of Lambo said you mean Audi?


Lambo used Lambo used to be Lambo 89. 89 is when Lamborghini was really lamb. But now Audi, everybody out there Just, if that's how he really talk. I know he talking that shit. No, he wasn't, he wasn't for play Play. He wasn't for play. Play. Mm. So what you think after Martin? I Can't, I can't even share. I can't tell y'all. But it was fire. It was fire. It was fire. I'm getting my little baby for art. Still got more This shit. Oh yeah. Tyrese, Tyree Got. it was on Your ass. Yeah. Tyrese. Did y'all explain to the audience? Yeah, I, no, I don't know what happened.


Oh, now you gonna get a, oh, I thought you was gonna, I I'm not gonna that. Oh, okay. Look, you know Now she magically dunno. Well, a real step up. Shut the fuck up. A real Step up. Thank you. Okay. So I thought we stopped. So Tyrese has some things to say about Joe's comments in response to when we talked about him and his divorce with his, I think, what's his name? Samantha. His ex-wife was Yeah, that's the name. Ex. Yeah. He, he didn't take too, too kindly to the words that Joe had to say bitter. He did big. He did big bitter. He kept saying he was bitter the rest of the cast up. He said that we held him down better than Joe did. He was kind of disappointed in that. I think He was more disappointed in the album review or lack thereof.


You think that's what motivated that or Don don't know. I can't tell his motivations, but I do think that he was really disappointed. And, and and the bitter thing. He kept talking about that and about him crying. Right About him. Yeah. Crying at, I think he kind of tried to correlate saying that every time Tyrese goes to Breakfast club he and has a successful there thing there. Joe has something negative to say. Oh okay. That's what I got from it. But Then he tried to, he tried to instigate and say that, you know, well not instigate, but he was saying that Joe has to, his knees getting old. He gotta bend down and and get married. But. yeah. At some point you time you propose. Yeah. I to, you know, I was like, this nigga niggas is wilding trusted Joe. It's time man. Get on your knees. It is getting old man.


You getting old. It's time to propose. Bless it all. I do think, 'cause the way he spoke about you, he really does speak of you in a way. And I don't know how good of a friend you guys are or acquaintances, whatever. I do think that he probably expected more from you and the understanding of what he's going through. And I think he kind of takes your word more serious than someone else. I think the bit, I think the bitter title just really hurt. And I, I could see how that can hurt coming from a friend who you would want them to see what you're going through and actually highlight. Joe's been vulnerable in his mental health bag and his emotional bag. So to sit up there and kind of clown me a little bit about my emotional outbursts, You wanted some grace.


I could see how, yeah, I could see it Speak nigga. What would you like me to say? Y'all, y'all always busy going on this tantrum about how you understand this guys, go ahead. Don't say this guys. Y'all understand? I see where he's coming from his mind. The fuck asked y'all to see where a nigga dis me was coming from. Anyway, what y'all think? Yo, you a sick nigga for that, that not Case the fuck is wrong with these niggas? No. What's wrong with You Just Said it. No, You hear these niggas, Hey So, I went to the bathroom because I didn't hear one word of what Tyrese had to say.


Okay, Cool. Now one word. Now one, one word. You right. I'm telling you now one word. If you wrote it, I Read it. I protect my space if I see someone that I love saying hurtful things and in the caption it says someone Joe Bud loves It is about to say hurtful things about him. I don't read it Joe. You're fucking lying. I Swear. Swear to God. I did not hear what Tyrese had to say about Joe. But y'all understand anything that come from his brain. Okay. I'm sitting there telling you It is like, oh no you did. You did. I didn't nigga. Okay. Okay. So. I did not hear. So should We play it? Okay. So for the betterment of a broadcast, we're telling you what he said. He, he was disappointed. He said at some point you would have to bend on a knee at a certain point and you should probably look forward to that because maybe your opinion of how he seems bitter would be a little different.


Mm. Why would that not be a I'm I'm not mad at his perception of that, nor am I here to try to change his mind. Tyrese is bitter. Is Tys your friend? I would say. Okay. Do you think sometimes how You can he Sat right here and I called him bitter. Okay. Oh I don don't. I wasn't here for that. So I know. Alright. Okay. What do you say to the people? That would say you're bitter. I looked up bitter. I said, Hey, I'm people too by the way. You are bitter I think that Tyrese is bitter. Okay. I don't think there's nothing wrong with saying I think, I also think that Tyrese is too great of a talent and a man to die on the hills that he's dying on.


I'm also a fan of Tyrese. So When I go by the album and every song is what it was then. It just is what It is. Why? Why? Let me ask you a question. Why bid or not broken? Mm mm That's a better be What you're broken. And and if I want to hear my friend say that, I would rather hear the bro. I would want to hear the broken B before the bitter. And I can see how broken could fit better than bitter. How? Tell me. Broken would, for me broken would mean there's a few areas of your life that seem to be in disarray.


Tyrese, when he hit the net and go on these, these Tangents Public tantrums, It is only one area that he's discussing. That's kind of what I mean about me. It's, we've all gone through bad breakups And and niggas have been there to say, yo, you bitter. No, I, they were there for me to say, you Bitter. I ain't never called you that. I've seen people where they were broken, they were broken emotionally, they were broken spiritually, you could be broken mentally that don't necessarily constitute bitter. Bitter is said in a, with a negative context with no grace. Broken is a little bit more sympathetic and, and and graceful. And he has other things that, that he's experienced within that time that could lead to that level of brokenness.


So listen, he's had a lot of death in his family and shit like that, that he talked about. Listen, If if, if When I speak, if I, if I was outta line and When I speak to him, I'll apologize for making him feel that way. Like I'm not here to just be Mr. Evil. No, y'all Cool. But I don't think it's such a horrible thing to, to point out that somebody that you are a fan of is coming off bitter. And it seems like they kind of losing a little bit of His video didn't seem that like angry or mean to No, no It Was, it seemed like a more disappointed thing. Like yo you my man. And It seemed more like you just don't understand 'cause you've never been married was really kind of the theme that I've got the gist of me from It. I'm open to that too.


Yeah, I'm open to that too. Said he's still dealing with it. So you've been married too, excuse me? Like you've been married, like you've been through I Have not been Married. Not legally married common law. But no, when you've been in these long ass long it's not the Same. It's not the same. 'cause When, you walk, Talk to him, husband, tell him Not When, you walk away. You, you don't have to, there's nothing else. You shook away. If I was wrong for I handled Tyrese then I'll address him privately and and deal with it and I'm open to that again. And they say He's a very religious guy. So there's even that beyond the You can just walk away. He also is like big into religion. And so the marriage part, the being one with God and all that shit And he was here my nigga, we saw him ev like he loved that lady.


So he fucked up. Like that's it just in a nutshell, just SoundsLikeDen mentally he put all his baskets, not all of his baskets. One basket put a big part of his life and happiness and growth into that marriage and to see it not, you know, build and blossom weight Way. Yeah. That's why I take the more broken side than the bitter. So yeah. When, you now start doing music and you don't have no way to flush this out. I'm gonna flush it all out through the music when I'm still going through a divorce, still going through a child support proceeding. Yeah. I guess the term bitterness is kind of applied to the fact that it's a continuous thing over the course of like years, couple of years. you know. At what point does brokenness then become bitter? It is well, well if your ex is on social media and people are big her up, You can, that can add onto it.


If you can't escape that, a lot of times things be private and You can escape and deal with it in the private. But she's on social media. She's being highlighted for the stance that she's taken on life and he probably feel like that's either hypocrisy and you're not dealing with me the same way. If You signed the pre pre prenup, if you signed the prenup all You didn't deal with me like that and After the divorce you're still having to go through court because you're still like you figured hey I lined up everything so that if after this I can now go about my life the way I want and I'm still not able to, that's not bitter. That's like I'm still having to deal with the repercussions of a marriage that I've believed Myself for. That is exactly Bitter life. Those circumstances can embitter you Just go your way in Enlighten. Especially court proceedings that can embitter you.


No, We we forgetting. No, we could get off this point. We forgetting that in that, in that breakfast club interview, he talked about more than just him losing shorty motherhood. He talked about him losing dear family members that were close to him. He talked about losing his wife. He talked about multiple things that could have him in an emotionally fucked up state in a broken place. It's just not the girl. He talked about losing his moms and talked about losing his sister. Yeah, like that. It'll have you fucked up. So somebody that you wanted to lean on or somebody you wanted to fall on now you can't even fall on them 'cause they out here doing whatever they doing. And I'm not no disrespect to that lady, but that might've been his crutch. And now your crutch is gone. You fucked up out Here. Not just gone. It is actually playing into more of your beating You up some more.


Yeah. Like So, I, I I don don't know that's true But salute to Tyrese. you know what I'm Saying? That's true. What Y'all saying? What? Nothing. What else we got 50, 50 verse the world boy. Oh boy. Nah. Now that I hear what you saying down that, that makes Sense. I know I It is just that hard way of trying to decipher Body language. He Means it or not. Yeah. That's a man taking Accountability.

Oh niggas just get quiet. Huh? Okay. 50 cent. Yeah, 50 And not really 50 cent Dam, 50 more Designer designer. It's just, it's a fucking mess out here. It's the 50 versus the world. The world being designer, Designer is mad that 50 said that he tried to sign him but didn't, once he realized he only had one hit. I don't really see how designer can be mad about that because you, you only had one hit. You only had one hit. Yeah, one and a half. Eh? What was the half? What was the half? Timmy Turner was picking a scene. Sit Down. That was The half, There was the other one.


Stop it. That was probably bigger than Timmy Turner. But I can't Remember what it called. What the third one? I don. Remember what it called the third And You. if you and you being the music aficionado, The driver aficionado. But If you would've remembered the song, if it was half a hit, he had a hit. What We talk about? He had one legitimate, I remember the anticipation for Timmy Turner. I remember the social media little video shit. Shit. Yeah. Remember that shit?

This ain't that. That Double XL shit was fired. Stop it. That's a half a hit. Tim turn. He one hit is what? 57 1 Real hit? Yes. Got it. Yes. And if you had a problem with what 50 said and you was going rap, I don't think the first thing to do is rap in the car. Just run to the parking lot. Hop in the car, hop in the car. Don't start it. Just prop your phone up. Hit the little ten second. Let me preset the camera thing and then start rapping. You look nuts. You look like exactly what you was mad about. The nigga saying you look like eh, I ain't gonna do it. That Was a compliment. If he was, if, if he was thinking how 50 thought when Jay dissed him, he would've took that as A compliment. We gonna play the designer dis The difference please.


He liked what 50 said. Yeah. I love your shit. Yeah, yeah. Cue up. Cue up that Five You can tell him I don't like that. I love that record. Which one up that? Huh? I said which one do you love?

The senseless violence Designer somehow managed to out horrible dis track Pros. No PR shit was worse. Shit was worse. Nah it wasn't. I got Pro shit being worse than that. It's The same. Why?

Nor do I want to see Dame invite 50 to the content battle the movie Off the CO off the CEO off. Yeah, it worked. Did 50 respond?

Aw. So happy to see how much you've grown the pod and everything you guys have accomplished. Shout out to each and every one of you. Thanks Ashley. By the way, Mel always choose the bear. I'm a girl and I just started a new relationship with a guy I really like and enjoy. Checks every box on the list. Funny, smart, great paying job and treats me amazing. The only problem is the sex is absolutely horrible. Oh Shit, if he does get it up big on the, if it lasts one to two minutes. And That is me being generous. Damn. Sex is really important to me in a relationship as it should be the most.


Do you guys have any advice on how I should handle this or what I should do? Or have you guys ever faced this problem? Would love to hear Mel's perspective and would love Guy insight on how, how or if I should even say anything about it or just end it. Love you guys. Aw Ashley. I'm gonna toss it to Mel.

So sex is not everything to me. However, in my twenties I was ravenous and fucking meant everything to me. Mel. No, last week you were ravenous. You know what? You are gonna have to stop minding my mother motherfucking Secret. You've all summer, you've been wrapping a sling around. But okay, go ahead, Don. Don't know. Maybe have a conversation with him about it. Maybe he can get a prescription from, you know, they're giving out like, you know, ed meds and shit like that. So go down that.
