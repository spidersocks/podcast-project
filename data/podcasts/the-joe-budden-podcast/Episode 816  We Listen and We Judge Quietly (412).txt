No, but that ain't why you hold it down. That's true. You don't hold it down so nobody can know. You just do it 'cause that's who you are. Facts. Okay.


Respect by way. Flip. Who is on your, you held real quick. Hold up man. You held it down for the fifth and still came in here firing nigga. And you know what you bitch ass niggas, you scammers, you scammed. And I'm like, huh? You shut up. Sorry. You just solid. Thank you. Solid guy. Not me nigga. Not me. I hold it down for you nigga. I want some shit. Hey. Yeah, I held it down. Now what we gonna do about this? What we doing about this my nigga? You put up a lot of smoke mirrors. Yo, you a trickster yo. You call him right away. Yeah. He bugged out.


He bugged out about you. You hold It down. You call him right away. Yeah. Nah, I give, I give him like 10 minutes. I'm calling him. I because you, if you call 'em in the building, they still listening. I get in the car and start driving. I call him. Nah, I mean It is good. I Make sure nothing in my life can even appear to have criminality. I get mad at people in my life for having to be on their third cash app account. Oh oh. Move it. Move it. Whoa. But real quick. Move it now. Nah. Nah, I can't. I can't use z I don What? I can't use Zelle no more. It don't work. Get away. I know what that means. We good? Yeah. And some of y'all out there be calling for favors with the, with the account.


That's the feds is watching. Yeah. So now the feds is, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. A family member that got jammed up in that. Just like that. I'm sorry. No. Just like that. No. Do you think people will extend you to shame? Gr. Oh God. That's not why you do it. It ain't about, it ain't about the reciprocity. It ain't why you do it. You do it 'cause it's you. No, but hold on. I know I get it. But even you talking about reciprocity to me nigga bitch ass niggas. Do you think that because you live on a straight shit, he ain't over that shit. Hell is that about because you live in a, remember he said on Patreon? Yeah, the friendship wasn't ref whatever that word is. Oh, reciprocity. Reciprocal. Thank you. Reciprocal. It wasn't reciprocal but we're gonna move on from that.


Do do, do you think that even if you do that for somebody else, how does it make you feel that people may not do the same for you, even if you living straight? Like does that, does that play in the back of your mind like the first time a situation happened for you? Some niggas don't talk about it, but a nigga will use that chance to kick your back in. But you mo you do the same thing but behind the scenes you move different. Like you, you, you contribute to niggas not lives not changing drastically if you understand what I mean. So do you feel like niggas would extend you that same grace or how do you feel that knowing that niggas may not extend you that same grace is what I Mean. I don't really think about if people would do it for me one. If I had to think about it, no I don't think people would do it for me.


Three, that plays no factor in why I do whatever I do for whoever I do it for. And four, I have to be like this. 'cause if I weren't like this, it would be subtract one from the good guys, which is already a small group and it would be another one over there to the niggas that's gonna do some bitch ass shit when they at the crossroads. Got it. So I have to be this way to keep the numbers somewhat balanced. It's Character. Yeah. Yeah man. Your character can't just change just because the lights are off and nobody's, nobody's looking. You know what I mean? But a Lot man people characters change because people don't, And It is understated that how I'm talking is not always how I've been.


Like I played with Isabel that lens he looked at me through. But there was a day where people looked at me through a really, really, really bad lens. 'cause that was the equity that I built in people. So this, this is a 44-year-old B 45-year-old nigga speaking from like a lot of times today when the internet people think, 'cause you're saying one thing that you haven't lived on the other side. So I just wanna be correct in that. Well We know the internet doesn't allow growth. Nope. Zero. Wherever they met you, that's who you are. Like I've been the guy guy to to to not be trusted by people. To not be trusted by companies, to not be viewed, to be viewed as irate, erratic, crazy, psycho non-trust.


And we are not even talking about this company. We're talking about family. Just general. Yeah. Yeah. Friends, girls. Until we fucked. And you saying that you gave them a reason to feel that way? That Sure, sure. Certainly. Certainly back in the day. Hell yeah. And hell yeah. And part of understanding that is accepting today that they might still view you that way. Like they they are Oh they are correct. And if that's how they wanna view you, you can't get mad at them for holding you to yesterday's standard. If you gave them that. Some people don't update and they just don't fuck with you. I don Based on how you used to be. I agree. IIII need people to update. That's why they don't. If they don't, it's still you have, that's where the accountability come in. Yeah. Got it. Like even if they don't, It is like, well I still made it this way so I just gotta live with it.


If you don't, If you and the update is within you Yeah. You update, they can never update. True. It don't matter if they update. That's what I'm saying. You The person that has to update. If you really hope that they would update, then you should just update. Because step one of that starts at you being the update. For sure. Essentially update. Some people don't or not not or not. It's true. And sometimes You just gotta accept that. And sometimes it's just convenient for them to consider, you know, regard you in the antiquated way of which you once were. You know what I mean? I understand They don't wanna And listen Antiquated As we go further into like steeper waters, the boat needs to be lighter.


This Nigga is crazy. Motherfucker's analogies, this Nigga is nuts. Wait, hello? Something Is wrong with you though. Everybody can't go No the other day. You Right. If it's a dingy, I don't wanna be in motherfucking ocean People that I, people I was like this wit from 20, 25 years ago that I stand on wherever we stopped talking. Like I still stand on that. So great. That needed to be the end of that. That don't change what it was 25 years ago though. That's what I'm saying. The boat just had to get a little, But then that's kind what I'm saying. So even, look, even if that person changed today, you stand on what? That's what I'm talking about. I don Oh And that person just, they could be the best person in the world today.


I, oh well I'm standing on What happened? You putting that, you putting that energy out there for people to treat you to feel the same way about you. And you have to accept that. I, I would want, I would want people to understand that I, that I Grew, I enforce boundaries. Like some of them, if you cross, there's no coming Back. There's coming. I get that Far. It's not a long list. Yeah, I get that far. It's Not a long list, but I enforce boundaries. But there's only min to me, there's only minuscules, unforgivable offenses. A lot of offenses can be forgiven to you. To you. That's your list. Yeah. Somebody else can have a whole different thing of shit that they not forgiven. Got it. And and forgiveness don't mean forgotten. That's true. Okay. I have no problem. My forgiveness is through the meter. 'cause I'm trying to be built. So does, I'm trying to be built through my higher powers likeness.


So I'm, I'm my forgiveness is whatever. That don't mean that we not about to change course of action moving forward. Does Your forgiveness equate to when I see you I can say hello. Of course I can always say hello. Got it. Even we might can never be cool again though. I can always say hello. I speak. I think that's part of being an adult. I can always say hello and be cordial and Be in the same. My mom, my mom used to tell me even a dog could bark. I could be in the same elevator. You could could say Hello. That don't mean I could be in a Phone booth. Like I can coexist with people. That's a plus us, You trickster man. Complicated Nuance because you, you, you, because you, you can co your coexistence. Right. Sometimes give off the wrong message because you can coexist.


It gives off the message that we cool, we cool again. And because people value your friendship or whether It is your status currently or whether they missed what you guys had. That can give mixed signals. That's coming. Coming from coming from coming from a perspective that's not balanced. Got it. Okay. I I don't put any merit in that perspective. You need two signatures for that to be true. Okay. I see what you're saying. You need two signatures on that, on that end sheet for you to know if we cool you just surmising that we cool from behavior that you see in passing. 'cause I'm just that type of standup person that's on you. I don't take that into account.


So how would they know if you cool it's, they there? Good question for you. How would somebody as opposed to do you say it just to them? I would imagine if you reach it based off of a actions Unprovoked, they know, do y'all know I am a beacon of light? Joe, stop It. I'm not stopping nothing. I'm a beacon of light. I'm warm, I'm loving, I'm giving, I'm caring. I'm thoughtful. People know you're Gonna know. No, I'm saying to your, to your example of in passing, if they assume that based off, If they don't, if you're not seeing that version, then you ain't supposed to know you. Who gives a fuck about what you know. That's how I, why do I, why am I waiting to see what that person knows? They not that they are what the young kids say.


A NPC, Joe, Joe. Because I know I don't want to What is that? Non-player character. Non playable, non-player. Here's the thing, it's a video game. Shit. Okay. You don't And I do think that we should start it. We should. We should. We should. We should. We should. We should, we should. Right. Go ahead. No, no, no. I was, I was just saying that like if you fall off with somebody based off of a misunderstanding or the knowledge that they lacked of, and you guys had a, a great pass together. Like just when you was around me, whatever, whatever. We was cool but based off a, a misunderstanding or not a lack of communication, but based off a lack of knowledge, you fall out.


You don't think that you could end up becoming cool again because that thing that you fell out for was based off of lack of knowledge on their part. If you understand what I'm saying? I Think I understand. I don I don't wanna, don't wanna make it. I feel like you may not be understanding what some of what I've been trying to say. So let me try it another way. Listen to me. No, I understand what you're saying. I'm just saying like, I'm telling you that my forgiveness levels are so great greater than the norm. They are so great that whoever you talking about that's on this list. Yes. Really did some fuck shit Period for me. Got It. Like if we talking about somebody where It is, It is not just a misunderstanding but That's the introduction to it.

You Had, you had a Question for us of what's a classic song that we could do without? Okay. Yeah, because I was, no pun reminiscing about when I went to a barbecue with Mary j Blige. It was really Angie, but Mary was there and all that. Okay. And the DJ was in the middle. I think I told y'all I there What I Oh you was there? Yeah. You talking about Dancey? No, the DJ was the middle of what I thought was a really cool set. Yeah, she pissed. And this was a great experience for me. 'cause I ain't talking shit. Mary doing it.


Mary dancing and Mary just started shitting on classic after classic after all those people after classic. Those are my favorite people. Well, Mary turned into Shaq. Yeah. And the more I listened to her, you started agreeing she was making sense. She, she really had good points though. She's making sense. Mr. But you don't want to hear that though. Oh, Mr. Wall from the B button. She killed Return of the Mack. Mack Mark Morrison. Oh, she destroyed that one. I almost could never hear it the same. But it's such a great song that fuck with Mary was talking about. Niggas was tight. I love you Mary. But anyway, so I wanted to come ask y'all, is there a classic, well not, is there, pick a classic and shit on it. Dove's car.


Holy Shit. What is a shit? What's a classic that, wait, you ain't hear this nigga? Well, let me finish explaining it first before he fucking pulls the big reveal out. Pick a classic that you think the world will be just fine if we eliminate it all together. Overrated. Just, who even made this a classic? And let's just totally obliterate some shit. The girl is mine. Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. I fucking hate that song. I could de I could take that off his discography and never miss It. Is that a classic? Yeah, of course. But why? What is it about that that really grinds your gears? Like what's whack about it?


Gimme a bag. I just, fuck the girl is mine. Like, talk about it. It just, I You can be mean. It's a song. It's not a person. No, I just, I just think, I just think it's, it's hokey. It's corny. It's just, it it, it feels like on the whole album it's, doesn't even make sense in its placement. Okay. I mean, yeah, that's just Sequencing beef. I like that. Add some Sequencing beef to this. I just, I've never liked the song. Even when I was a kid. I never liked the song. It just, I got an easy one and it was his birthday recently or anniversary of his death. So rest in peace to DMX. But Party Up is my least favorite song. It feels like someone's put screw drivers in my ear. How y'all gonna make me that one?


Yes. Yes. Up in here. It's like someone is putting screw, screw drivers in my ears. Oh, he's everything about everything. About even what I learned. It was a distract. I was like, oh, maybe I need to go back and song in my head. I'm like, and It is like, bring nails on the chalkboard to me. Oh, you man's been to gym before my Damn Parks. For real. Oh my God. Hold up, man. Memory real. You're Gonna on migraine. Hold up. Jesus. I'm not. And Mary j Blige, the dancery one as well. The Dr. Dre record. Oh my God. Family Affair. Family. I hate that Record.

Alright, so Parks went, family Walk, party up. Mel went and said the boy is mine. You got flipped. I don, I don't know. I'm stuck. Yeah. There's not a classic song that when it comes on you just like, ah, fuck. Mm. I gotta think, lemme Think of, I got a whole list of like rock and roll ones too. Any of those I was Trying to look up. Yeah, baby Talk ones. Aerosmith has one Dip Down. I hate that song. I hate Go, go, go Gga by either the police or the Queen. That one too. And I, No. Wait, the wait, that's, that's Radio. Radio Gaga? No. I like Radio Guy. Yeah, I do like radio. Oh, Diablo by the Beatles. Any of those like Baby Talkie. What's That? That shit from Right said Fred.

You have to tell us why. No. Now you time to be on your phone though. You have to tell us why. Yeah, you gotta look at us. Yo. If Prince didn't make that song, y'all wouldn't like it. What is that noise? Whatcha are you cutting grass? What is that today? Oh shit. What you talking about? What we asking you? What you talking about? Tell us ma'am. The song comes on. But what, what else don't you, what else do you hate about Hey, this Ain't, We Listen and We Judge Quietly. Yeah. Like ain't, what else do you hate about it? That shit Don't, it ain't It for me. I ain't gonna say nothing. I'm Chilling. No, I'm just saying. It's not, it.


You ain't with none of that dope. Eighties. I think it's dope. That's dope right there. I don't know if you being funny. I don't know. No, no. That's dope. So what, what do you hate about it? It's about to come this or him. That's he saying Prince fucked this up. That's fire to You right there. Yeah. A y Ya. Yes. Touch if you Will. Nah, I'm I'm not mad at you saying that I'm I'm a Prince dude, but I'm not mad at you saying that right there. Why am at, but It is you saying, I don't know. It's cool. I love that. I love Mono's voice is in that song, you know. You know some of my favorite shit on a song is whatever the artist is doing before the song starts and when it ends, like to kind of get him in the No, but for me when it ends, cool.


But before it starts, 'cause you either flew that there 'cause you thought it should be there, or you really did that to get in your bag to do the song. So like when you yell in the booth. Yeah. Yeah. The Lil Wayne lighter. The fucking, I don't know why he's doing it. I don't even know if he's lighting something up. But the fact that when that lighter goes off, you kind of know something. You know? I like it. I don't Alright. When Doves cry, what up? Anybody else? Anybody Else? I, I've been trying to think of one. I mean I got whole albums that fall under that. But a song put me down for something. Laury Hill. Damn, this guy. Anything? No, no. Miseducation just, I'm, I'm I'm Do what? Yep. No, I like song.


But take that album outta here because it's too much that hangs on that album that puts her up where she don't need to be, in my opinion. And it's because of that album, which is a r and b album. Not a rap album. I wanna have that debate again. But is it a good RB album? So he just shouldn't, but he just shitting on that as the classic that It is. I'm shit On that. It shouldn't be what It is. No, no, no. She shouldn't be what she is as a rapper based off of that. 'cause that is not a rap album. But because of its success and how that album was received, it puts her in a category and higher up on a list. And I believe she deserves to be. So I blame it on that album. So get that entire album outta here. Ba Okay for me.


I'm gonna go with But one the Star Spangled Banner. But that ain't really what we're talking about. No one regards that as a slap. Third verse a little. It's been around a while. You right. It's kind of timeless. You're right. But I knew that that would kind of be against the rules. So I picked another great white slap that the whites tried to make me think would be around for an eternity when I was in elementary school. But now that I'm an adult, I know better. Let's play this bullshit and we can get rid of Ben Midler's whole catalog too. That's fucked up.


Listen to this. My bad at that. Oh please get this fucking wind beneath my wing. Shit. The fuck outta here. Yeah. Bye. I'm cool with this was like a, they tried to make this a graduation song at one point. It did. It is. It is. No but Buddy. Well I dropped out partly because of this. Listen, you ain't want no wind under your wings. Niggas be crying to this shit. I think this is like the audio version of Star Trek. What White people did. Shut the fuck. Listen to this song. The words ain't that bad Johnny. This song is a mess. Everything about this needs to go. I mean, it goes with the movie though. The words ain't that bad. Don't worry. The Mo Beaches. Yeah. Fuck the beaches. Yeah.


Wow. Dump bed. Midler whole. You gotta get the big the big black trash bags. The contractor bags. Yeah. You gotta get five gallon shit. Hey, the shit that you could put all the leaves in it. Just say all the leaves on the side. Midler, come on, let's get to the chorus of this bullshit. Core is dope. This song has got, you can't do that to win Doves cry and big this up. I'm not big it. I'm just saying. It ain't it. Gotta go. Your life wouldn't change or miss a beat. Look, this is her breaking down going crazy. Look. And the valedictorian this year. 3.9.


Yeah. That's funny. It is. Samantha Walbrook. Come on, make Samantha Walbrook to this day. You broke it Fit. It fits. And what's the other one? The salmon. The salmon. Victorian. What's the other one? Salad. The salmon one. Salmon tutorial. The saluted. This nigga says salmon. Yeah, they still play. I believe I can fly Congrat too. Yeah, that that that was what we had to sing. Yeah, we had to sing that. We had to sing. I believe I can Fly nigga. Wait, hold up. Y'all listen now. White people bring the drums in listeners ass. Look, listen, check it out. Before we knew who Pharrell was.


Look, she didn't call Phil Collins. Look, you need a little Phil right here. Dope bypass past. Yeah, she went past it. Oh my. That shit was throw Ben Midler in the trash. Never. Nigga you crazy. You got to, you got to nigga. I bet that yes you can. Well for music re As you can. I was trying to find some other ones, but yes, you, you can say it. It's all right. We ain't gonna lose our Black heart. Oh, speaking of losing cards, are y'all, are y'all gonna go get the real id? Shit? They say you need to fly. That they say is a form of racism and systemic oppression against black, brown and minority people. I got the, I already got it. Well, we, I got, I I had it couple years ago. Hey, big freeze.


I know, I know. Hey, big freeze. Buy the books man. He Got the beta version. He had, He had that shit years ago. All right. I got the little passport card, so I don't know if I need it. I that You don't, you don't need it. That works. I'm good. That works. I'm defiant. Or even if your passport itself, I got passport. Anything that gotta go through Homeland, you, You have a passport card. You and Passport. Why do they say that? It is, why did they say all that other shit? You just said You need real id. So now if you, even if you're traveling domestically, you can't Use your driver License. You can't use your driver's license no more. You need the driver's license that has the real ID chip or some Shit. Where does that start? May, may, something. May, May 7th. I may something. Yeah. But he said the reason why you need that, it says oppression and all that. Where that, where did that come from?


That theory, Joe, That's not true. No. Oh, I'm gonna say don't put that, don't put that on me. And I don't know yet. But the theory comes from them saying not enough black, brown and minority people will meet the requirements to get one. And that this will be a tool for cer certain, certain votes in the future. Like you will need this to participate in certain voting in the future. I can see how this would be ative to a lot Of people. Yeah. That that's what they're saying. I don't know if that's true. That already have a license. No, because I thought all you had to do is have to be Yeah. I's Some people that don't have a license. True. And there's some people that have maybe some troubling family shit where they can't get their birth certificate.


So it's harder to get the proper identification. Again, I'm, I'm listen, check with your local authority on the matter. The difference with the two is the real Id check it out. Break It is, It is federal. So it's like when you go to New Jersey, DMV, New York, DMV, whatever state you're in, DMV, it's just a state check. Yeah. Whereas now it's a federal check. Got it. That that's, that's the main difference. So now you're approved to fly anywhere. You just have to use that license instead of your regular driver's license. It ain't, it ain't like you gotta go through no extra steps. Can you travel in the future? Will you be able to travel with a warrant? Probably not. Book 'em Dan though. That's what I'm saying. Like You coming from New York.


What I'm saying, there's certain things I just don't know yet. But they're saying that this will be used as a tool in the future. Again, I'm no expert on the matter, but I could see it getting funny. And I'm saying that is somebody that probably plans on going to get it. Like I don't have You don't need it. I don't have the new passport card. You don't. You regular passport. Regular passport. Have a big stupid passport. That works Dog. We know it works. Nigga Used to carry a passport in your pocket. That's nice. Like a Second shot. Second shot. Oh, he coming. He don't do it. Yo, don't move on. Yeah, let it go. Let go. My girl right here. There you go. Y'all can turn me. No. You wanna know why I, I'm, I think I'm just speaking from my own experience because if I lose my identification, I'm, I'm supremely fucked because I'm Canadian.


It's, it, it takes off a whole, it's a whole process for you whole. It's a whole lot more You drink. Oh, I thought you were still getting shit that you Ain't. Well he's gonna come rescue me from What I heard you thought you what Joe? I'm sorry. We didn't. What guy? I didn You thought you was getting What? I didn't say anything. What'd You say?

Yeah. Those are respectful for Women. It's a lot that don't. I'm Talking about the ones that's leaving they kids in the Burger King bathroom while they Up, we shot my man bell when he left his kids at the McDonald's For a job interview. She doing the she at the job. She working, she got the job already. Gotta bring home some bacon. That's true. That's true. You know what I mean? Me, them Jordan's costs. What you think of that man?

It's alright. It's alright. Shit. I I got it. I get fed up one day though. And tell the truth. Tell the truth about you bitches. Anyway. What else is important or unimportant? Let's see your job. I rant. Oh, Netflix has gentrified the pop the balloon show. Yeah. Yeah they did. Netflix has absolutely gentrified to pop the balloon show. This is craziness. And it's Live. Live? Yes. Oh yeah, Live. Oh live adds a touch. That's different. Live adds a little touch to it.


So the girl who own who started the show, she was the host, the hostess, right? Correct. Yes. Not on, not on Netflix. I'm talking about like on the YouTube show. I have no idea. I haven't seen so many versions. I don't even know what the original one is. Okay. Well they, if if she was then they completely replaced her. Some niggas in the hood had to pop the balloon show. I'm like, I don't, I don't know what's real. It's real. I think everybody's just doing it now. Well the word is, and again fact check this yourself 'cause I do not know but the word is that the person you're talking about handpicked the host that you see on Netflix. Okay. Yvonne Orgy. She's amazing. She's great. I just was, I was like That. They move her know if that's true Away for a celebrity. I don dunno but okay, if she, I'm just talking about seeing all of these white people.


That's what got me. I'm seeing more white people than I've ever seen before on this. Pop the balloon shit. You know why there was a guy that they said day that he was racist on there? I'm trying to find his name. He was racist. Just not under the premise of this show. Well actually I take that back 'cause the premise of this show, one of the, the highlights for me is that you get your shit off respectably respectfully. Like you're telling somebody respectfully. Why did you Pop up respect balloon on such and such? Why I wouldn't I danger? Oh yeah. It really ain't meant for Shade. A guy named Johnny Bananas called the black woman a monkey on there. Wow. Excuse me. No, he said you, he did not call her monkey. He said you look like you should be hanging upside down from a tree, from a tree eating a banana.


What the Fuck that called a monkey? Call her fucking monkey. Actually that's worse. That's Joe. I'm just saying he didn't say you are a monkey. I got you. But Joe, I'd rather he said that shit Don Don don't tell a black person nothing about hanging In. Netflix can put that out you guys. If don't Say hanging in tree to you a black person, you look like you should be. I don't care how upside down. Right side up. Don't say that Joe. When you heard that, how did you feel? Because I know you, you very pro-black. They said that the, the show was Well I, I was against the show including white people. I think some shit should be ga Gay kept Got it. Agreed. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, unfortunately they said ar let Like why we couldn't get a balloon Like we, we was Chilling. But I understand the business. Business of it. Business and the politics of it and sell out then That's it.


What were you reading? What Said you was looking at me like you wanna smoke? They said pop the balloon show or find Love was started by a married couple are let Amli and Bia Maundy, they created the show and host the show which gained popularity as of viral YouTube series. So I guess they did the casting. No. Or they sold to Netflix. Yeah, sold it to Netflix and got it. Whatever they got And Netflix is doing what they do now. Do this dumb shit that they did. Same shit. Remember Squid Game when they was talking about and the person who created the shows like damn I only made X and y'all went and blew it up to that. It's, it's that.


That's crazy. Yeah. You look like you should be smack. I I wouldn't know was any other black people were was any other black men on? Yeah.

Seriously He supposed got stolen on you look like you should my boy. What? You don't think so? And you matter of fact, what You asking a lot of people that are, you don't know why these people are on the show. Right? That's true. We on the living room saying he should got snow. I agree with that. But It might have been port borderline scripted on set.

Oh my God. Let's go Tell Juan, let's go fucking go nigga. You came out balls nigga. Fucking niggas. Dad is great. BDot is back with another list. This time we are doing the greatest Posse cuts. Posse cuts. Oh, wasn't bad at this list. I am. Yeah. 100. What does that mean? What's missing? We tell the truth today It's 10 or 20. No, it's 10. It's 10. It's 10. And then mad. No, I wasn't mad. I wasn't mad but I found something to be mad about. But it ain't, ain't a horrible list. Alright, so It's the top 10 posse cut list. He says the criteria is musicality impact, relevancy. So I go in Reverse order.


Was that the end of the Criteria? Yeah, that's all it says. Alright. See he just getting checks now. Alright. And that's where I have a big beef with number two. And we gonna have an honest conversation about it. Okay, I got, I got beef with something else on it. One is Benjamin's. There shouldn't be no beef with Benjamin's. If you wanna do reverse or you wanna start one, Start at 10. Start at 10, start At 10. 10 is the symphony. Okay? And that's the problem. I it Can't be 10. And that's the problem. Find the symphony. You cannot find nine songs back. Whoever Is making the posse cut list is wrong. Let me ask you, if You are putting Symphony at 10, your ear, you're not the person to do it. How old is BDot? I'm only fucking, I don't know. I'm only, It is Google it.


Let's ask him Chad, GBT or somebody. Somebody look it up. I'll keep going. His skin's still beautiful enough to beat 35. I I A lot of that matters when you start talking. He bro. Oh no. Inexcusable. He's 40 Inexcusable p Die nigga. I 40 years old. You can't have Day After mine. Well he don't have no but but I had an older brother so lemme not say that. Well, and I'm older than him. I'm just getting ready to say yo like not for it wouldn't be on mine. It it would be there on my list. It's impossible. But you'd be Wrongest I what we're saying. I see what you're saying. I'm gonna say this. I see what you're saying. There are people that may not have it on the list. Yeah. Or have it low. It is that old. So I respect, I don't, I don't respect that. No. Why I respect that though. This is my point.


If Those people are wrong, If you and Ebert and It is what you do for a job, I think it's your responsibility now to go watch Gone with the Win and C Citizen Kane and movies like that. True. So BDot is a a music journalist. The problem with that is Cisco and Ebert was off air long before the fucking world changed. So yeah, they gotta be, I'm saying the movie critic Storybird, the movie critic, niggas gotta get microwaved out too, But not So it's microwave people that's doing this to your, they don't know the symphony To your sister and Ebert point watching it with today's eyes and ears for the first time. It ain't going hit the same. That's like if I go let It should though. It should not.


Not necessarily not based on what you said, The symphony has aged. Well this the thing why we Play. How do you know the impact? Let's play. That's the one thing I Wasn't because there are no posse cuts without that's But you don't know that because he wasn't there. The impact you can't account for because you wasn't there. He not like, I'ma sit here. He's right with that. Let me run the rest of the list real quick. He's right. A is right scenario is number right. Scenario is number nine. I got a problem With that. That's wrong. I got a problem with that being nine and 10. No, I don't Care who's first or Who you up nigga. But I know that y'all just better rock this at the drop of a dime baby. That's Marley Mall. Hold up Hip hop royalty. Yes. We're starting with who is the top, the baby face, the, the fucking even before him we're starting with the architect creme de creme of whatever you think you're good at picking and hip hop?

It was ran like that's still the the phrase change just impact alone. It was an impactful song. No, no that's an understatement. Extremely impactful. What this sounds like to me. I'm gonna tell you what, hold on. Lemme tell you what this sounds like to me. This sounds like a younger dude. When I say younger, I'm talking about late thirties to 40, which he's 40 from New York. Put a list together and threw in the couple south records that you feel have to be on here. Yeah. That's Why I said that's I hear. That's why I said alright so no it's two. It's two pieces to I got bling bling higher personally listen to this. There's two pieces to that. Tell me them niggas was going crazy higher than what they was going crazy lyrically and bling bling.


Again it's two parts. Musicality. Yeah. Impact relevancy. It doesn't necessarily say lyrically going crazy. A lyricism puts it up. So high musicality plays into this is a song. Okay, so musicality ain't just lyrics talking Impact fucking something was way more impact. Fucking It wasn't. Now should band from TV be in the top five? No. In life it's not for us. It's not for us. I don and let Me ask you something I get, let me ask you something. Why? Why, why? Because he did have a rule. Why is bling bling A posse track? That's what My question I Was, I'm trying to look up to make sure I'm not tripping. It is. Why Is bling bling a posse track? It's a group. It's a group's track. Bling Bling is not a group. Bling Bling is two, two different groups. They're just under the same label. Who It is, the hot boys and the big timers which are two different groups.


Stop it. He's right. That is the truth. Stop it. He's right. That's his same. It is right. But still stop it man. If you don't get that shit the fuck outta here. That's a group I'd have put Make em say, oh on this list Bling bling. That Would've been a more valid choice to me. Just 'cause they're it's it. But Wait a minute, but again, wait a minute. Had more impact. Are you telling, Are you arguing that the big timers are not in the Hot Boys? They're not the hot boys is bg, juvenile, Wayne and Turk. The big timers are Make Baby and Manny Fresh. He's right. Alright. Right. I'm done with this. That that's a fact. He's right. I don't care. It Don't matter. I know you don't care but ain't symphony we talking facts here. Not caring and feelings. That shit ain't, that shit ain't symphony that and that's coming from your standpoint. That's why I said listening to this list in the world, right?


It's not in the world. Yes there are people in the world younger than y'all that disagree with that. People don't count. Play Scenario. Yes, that's fine. You gonna hear it. We heard it play scenario. Oh You wait a minute. Parks About to like I'm yo y'all gonna hate this scenario Remix. And that's not even scenario. It is in the remix. That's the remix Seven MCs. I put both of the form on there. What? Which is the spiritual assets? Y'all gonna get mad. Y'all gonna get mad at what I gotta say about this F it shit. I make buck shots Mad man. A rip up stages. Lay down your wages some wild Like Larry Davis extra, extra to go a cliff.


I tell As a friend And grab my dick, Cut it off, cut it off. You know what's crazy, crazy. Make niggas mad. Go Ahead. I'm gonna make niggas mad. I put scenario 2000 higher than that personally just because of, again, I don't know this song like that. Alright, I'm not from that. I can't talk to him no more. You Don't have to. I'm not trying to be funny. And that's still New York you're taking, You're thinking of NY 2000? No, I said scenario 2000. He's talking about scenario. Which Rough, rough Rider. Oh that one. Oh that's what I'm talking about. What year you was born? I was born in 83. Ice is just, I don that song Came out. That's his opinion. 90 no scenarios out. 99, 2. And again, I I and that's why when I have these debates with people, you ask them their entry point into hip hop.


I always tell y'all mine is NWA Snoop. So you talk about It's the same year. Yeah, but it was West Coast. My entry, I didn't hear. That's why I don't listen to a lot of the New York rap. So it don't impact me the same. I don't know that impact that y'all speak of. How'd That happen? Because I was in the house. But you are in Jersey. Yeah, but we had the box, the TV show we had Nation Wild. So nothing About New York, New Jersey Rap had that was like wasn't a part of your entry point. No. West Coast what? Not really outside of my uncle who was a big LL Cool J fan. And that was really all I heard as far as rap. Like coming up was just, just ll and then once I got to the point where I could kind of feel out and what I like myself.


Yeah, I I'm watching it. It was, it was a form of music videos for me. It wasn't really hearing it on the radio or I ain't had no older cousins or brothers or whatever got that doing it. Got it was me say that. 'cause the box had east coast hip hop of course, but the the but at the time that exclusively West Coast shit, the box, everything. But at the time that I'm into it, the chart toppers, the ones that that was, when they do they little, this is the most requested little shit like that that was popping up. Or you see the, like I started to know the numbers for certain songs. It was what more West Coast shit for me. I just would've thought it was unavoidable being It is very avoidable. Yeah, It is. I like, I I think Ice Beyond his contrarian shit sometimes and wanted to be different and wanted to go fuck with that shit over there.


And the No Limit Niggas in the, in the and the and the what's the other nigga's and Ba Money conflict and all that, all that. Oh no. Yeah, all of that. Like I think that, I think that's, yo I'm going against the grain. Y'all niggas do that. I'm doing this. I, it's, I could understand that, but I'm telling you the truth, it really wasn't that again, I didn't, I don't like a lot of East Coast production. I had a cousin that was really big into bootcamp. That's how I learned about Helter Skelter boot. But I was never a Smith and Wesson dude. Really? Helter Skelter nocturnal was my introduction to bootcamp. That's old enough ice. Yeah, but what I'm saying is there was a lot of shit before that. I don't know. No Black Moon, I don't know.


Missed all of that. But Helter Skelter. Which Helter skelter? I'm you It is Induction hip Hopwa. Yeah. No, it's so You can't Ms. Black Moon is way after That. No, it's not way after. No, it's not. That's not true. That's that's the same Black Black Bull was 92 Ish. 90 92 93 was 90 no Turtles. Like 95, 96. Yes. 95 I think. But the thing is where, where, where people like that whole, oh, you're just being a contr contrarian. That's not really true here. It's, It is just a matter of, I I never really like, remember we had to talk Preme to this day tells me Yo ice, you don't like my pro my production, which isn't really the truth. I'm just, I was never a fan of the New York hip hop sound.


That West Coast shit sounded smoother. The down south shit had a bounce to it. Yo you know, you don't I never heard that. Yo, I don't, I don't want us to kick past the coverage. I we should still be talking about deposit coach. Oh true, true. But you know that you could still like one and like your West Coast music more. Right. I'm just Saying. But a for a lot of people, your introduction, the shit that really, that you gravitate to, to initially I'm just, I'm is where your heart would, where your heart would lie at. I'm calling Ka This Ain't no for the Possy cut. Yes. Good question. That's on the list. S the thing about that thousand percent. But think about this. You can't just say, yo, east coast hip hop sounds like XI said New York, a lot of the New York sounding hip hop sounded like that until Bad Boy What I'm saying is why I tend to agree with Ish is 'cause I saw you at my birthday party having the time of your life to East Coast Sound and Music.


Yes. It was banned from tv. Shook Ones shook one. What years are those? I'm, I'm again this is my But you said you didn't like my but those are the, those are the commercial, like the bigger records.
