That's dope. We at the hotels, there's boats and shit. Cool. Saturday morning my mom gives me a call on the phone.


She says, good morning, say mom, good morning. But her voice sounds like funny. It sounds like floaty. Like just happy and just real good start to the morning. Even though it's only 8:00 AM but I don't pick up on it yet. I just say Mom, my mom sounds funny. Say, Hey mom, what's going on? She said, oh, nothing much. Huh? My man, just, when he left, he went to go do such and such and such and such. I stayed back, figured I'd get some extra sleep. Lay down.

But I just thought that was hilarious. That's funny. Nah, that's funny. That's Hilarious. You can't do that shit. Nah. Hell Not at all. Because Now I'm supposed to look at this nigga, man, Like, you wanna knock his face off? He the glasses, right. Nigga with the glasses. Yeah. My own boyfriend. Yeah. I was like, I'm only gonna tell a story 'cause you faithful.


Like if you wasn't a faithful woman then, then I wouldn't say it on the pod that hey, if you listen now there, that's when we don't tell the whole truth. When somebody's not being faithful, Shout out to moms. It's crazy. Listen to the, All right, we don't wanna start. Let's do, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Where do they need our, our attention Most Hmm. Gail? Women. Women. Ga Women in Space. Space. Now take it away. No. Oh Shit. They, I, I Don't, this is the only time we can say women are space cadets and not be evil. The crazy part to me is they wrote the Dick Rocket. That shit looked exactly like a fucking dick.


Yes. And some of them Throbbing through space. Like Yeah. Nah, throbbing. It was nuts. That shit was, it wasn't dick rocket. It was a dick rocket. Who wants to start, who wants to lead us off here? No Matter how I feel like Mel should really be the deliver of this crazy Situation. I'm just gonna say how confused I am by this whole situation. Same. Okay. I'm glad it's not just us men. Every single article or piece I've seen written in the media has focused on their outfits on the fact that they're doing their hair, doing their makeup. I'm like, what the fuck are we talking about here? What's happening? Didn didn't, I Didn't get this story. What, what exactly is Happening? Jeff Bezos, his his, it was his first flight to the fucking moon.


I don't know where the fuck they went. It is much Right To Space. Went, Came back down. Came back down. So He sent Jeff Bezos is doing like space influences. So Then he sent, He's doing his Elon impression. Yeah. His Elon impression. So He said, Katie Perry, Gail King, aerospace engineer, Aisha Bow feminist activist, Amanda Nguyen, Corin Stefans, Carrie Ann Flynn. And his, his Girlfriend or girlfriend Or whatever she Is. Lauren Sanchez, Claudia Jordan put Gloria Jordan. They all want up in space. They just went up and up high in the atmosphere. Stacey Dash. I had a whole nice list. Like we all just put some others on there. Let me ask you for one day, right? Not even day, not even.


They was up there for like 10 minutes or some stupid shit. Niggas went to Vegas and came back. They went around the corner. Lemme ask you. Yeah. What, what were they supposed to be doing? I mean, Looking cute and going to space. Like I don do that. They was raising money for autism too. In, in the interim. That's My point. Like, yo Mel said she was disturbed by them just doing regular shit. I just don't understand. That's Not regular shit. Yeah. Your hair as a woman. Oh, with the hair and the makeup. I don't Under the hair and makeup to go to space is a little, I Don't understand. Well we going about hair melding to space. Oh my God. Alright. That's my last one. Like I said to shoot, shoot me up.


I asked early. He said his up. I Asked early nigga said Mars, you Asked early. Okay, that's my last one for the hour. You're lucky that went over my head. Okay. Anyways, You remember that? What's the joke? Don't explain. What's movie with Chris Tucker Man movie. The Fifth Element. The Lady in the Blue. You know what I'm saying? That's a great, great movie. I love that movie. It is great. I like the Lady in the blue. Anyways, that I don't know. It just was so Do you believe that they went? Yeah, I think that they went, I would think they went up and they came back down. How Many people in here believe that they went to Space To find space?


What's I was just, what the fuck is space? They went up. Do I think the earth, they broke. I think they broke the atmosphere playing and came right back. That's it. I don So the first thing I thought was, well, two things. One, I, I get why they would wear makeup and stuff like that for all the press and all the other shit. Yeah. Like it, it's, I I would, it'd be weird if they did like No, no, it's not the fact that they had makeup on. It's not the fact that they had makeup on and they did their hair. It just seemed like every single piece I saw written on it, the focus was on them doing their makeup in their hair. See that? That's why you have to either get scientists to go up there, astronauts or not. Right? Because if you get celebrities, they're gonna do celebrity shit. I don't think you're wrong. That was the point, fam. You wanna see Ka Perry come from space with no makeup on. They just said no uglies up there. I just really Wanted to know why the fuck she was going there in the first place.


But I actually thought it might be good for all this flat earth shit. That's the thought. That's what my other thought was like. If you can see the earth's, the earth's aim that at that couch Is Yeah, that couch is the Flat earth couch. A Mel, you know why she went in the first place? Why? Because they keep sending scientists up there. Nobody gives a fuck. Oh God. Okay, so let's Try trying to make a common person care. We talking about it. We ain't talking about no s They had scientists stuck up there for months. That's true. True. Nobody gave a Fuck that. We talking about it. A little paid nine months. Nobody care. They flat. Earthers. They're flat. Earthers they're not flat. I don't believe that y'all, y'all aren't flat Earthers. I'm not a flat earth. I'm not. I'm a, I don't know what the fuck It is. I'm open to it though. I don't See that. That's, that's the, the, the, the loophole. And I'm not a flat earth. Alright. We take it back.


I, I, if, if y'all already talked to this, I don't wanna talk about it. Please have at it. Please. Yes. You didn't You Dick Ryan. Maybe If the, but, but if, oh Wait. Oh wait. You can't do that. Let him call. Let him go. IIII ain't fucking me. I'm, I'm not being, I can't tell y'all joking. No, they're kinda of serious. They're serious, bro. They're nice. They right there. You can talk to 'em. Yeah, they're nice. I don't know what the fuck is up there. So you don't believe like the people who left the earth and looked down at it? Oh hell no. Hell no. We don't believe them. They Don't believe in that, bro. Hey, I'm not A flat earth. Now, I'll tell you this. I don't believe we went to the moon. Let ask you a question. I I'm Why we always get the same picture? Because the same thing. I know from the same You go, you going Mark, no wait.


I'm, I'm sorry. For thousands of years we've determined the earth is a sphere. You got it, bro. Okay. I'm not saying it's not so why would you open? That's like, but You're not saying It is. Exactly. Hey, look, you said a thousand. You, you believe in gravity. Like if I jump up in, it's gonna come down. Right? If I came here and said, I'm open to the fact that it's, that gravity doesn't exist, that would be like a strange thing. Right? 'cause you, we have evidence of it. What's the evidence that we, that the earth could be anything missing? Let, let me, let me ask that for you prior to this is your question. Prior to that we quote unquote, knew for a fact the earth was flat, right? Until it was disproving. Yes or no. It's a little different. What's the difference? What's the difference If I say, I think there's nobody in that other room.


Based on my knowledge, there's nobody in that other room. That's the best knowledge I have. And then I walk in there and see somebody in the other room, and then you're still here saying, well, I don't believe you went in the other room. So, so that's why I asked. That's all. I You may not have went. It is possible. You could have told me that you went in the other room. What if I sent you pictures? You see what I'm saying? Like, we have so much evidence of the earth being around. Not, but also just, just how gravity, how, how, how the planet works. I mean, again, there's no scientific base. That's cool. Again, all science, all science is theory until proven or disproven. So, period. And you don't think the round, I think that as technology evolves, the shit that we know, we realize we don't know. And it keeps happening.


We know for a fact this and then some new shit come out. Oh shit, we was wrong about that. Like they told us dinosaurs had scales and now they say, yo, they were covered feathers. But that would be, we don't know shit until, we don't know none of this shit. When yours in school, it was nine planets, right? Sort of. Yeah. Well, no sort. It was nine planet. Nine. Nine. Some people said yes, some people said no. When you was in school, it was nine planets. It was nine. It was nine when I was in school. Okay. So there's no way It was eight or eight and a half or whatever when you was in school. O Okay. Now it's not, well, I mean this, that's a little different. So it's the designation to whether or not these Are apples, oranges, Food is still there. It's not apple and orange, but it's whether or not it's designated as a planet. Planet. That's right. That's always point. But my point is, at one minute this was a fact.


It's not the same thing. And then next thing you know, we find out some more information and it's no longer a fact. So you, what's to say that we find out information and what we thought was a fact. It's no longer a fact. That's, that's my question. If there's nine planets, we could find more, right? Or we could or Right. Correct. We could let, let me ask you a question, but saying that there's an object on that table, either it's there or it's not. You ain't seen it. Let me ask you a question. So you're saying you only believe if you go, let me ask you a question. Do you believe Anica stops the, the, the, the, the bottom? That's it. It's nothing after Antarctica. It's nothing after the North Pole. You believe that? I, I I don't, I don't understand what you said. The Antarctica at the wall that stops you. I can't down. Does this stop and does this stop at the bottom?


They've proven that it shit below Antarctica. Huh? You lost me. We good. I just don't understand. I'm not, I'm not underneath. I really don't understand what you're saying, dog. It is all right underneath the ice. It's the main pot. We good? We could talk about this little page. Oh, let's get the temp. No, no, no. We're not doing that no more. If y if anybody has a point to Make, make it and close this Conversation. I, I, I mean my part, I'm not trying to close you. I'm saying I, I just, I I'm just surprised. That's all. I, I I get the idea, the idea of saying that we can get more scientific evidence to prove, but science is, is definitive on the round, the sphere of spherical earth thing. No, It is. The only question would be whether you think science is lying or there's a, there's a lie about it. Right? That's different. If you're saying there's a conspiracy, like we didn't go to the moon, that's different.


But to say that like we don't have enough scientific knowledge after thousands of years. Like, God, stop Cory, You're not on A pod. He right though For a reason. There's a reason Cory's not on a podcast or a, there's a reason for it. S all I'm saying is we know something and then we, we we keep coming back and saying, oh shit, we was wrong about that. Right. But we've seen it. Okay, so we have King. So Gale King. Yeah, Gale King. I personally don't really give a fuck. Would y'all do it? They Did look funny on the space. Dicks. They did. Would y'all do it? No, No, no, no, no. I'm cool. Interested in it, in there's no reason. What is the what?


Why are we doing it? If I was like 80, curiosity. If I was 80 Not Curious, I'd do it. I would do it at 80. I wouldn't do it now, nigga. I mean, if I'm in the house, I'm definitely not curious. Why the fuck? I wanna know what's going on on beer. Boy, I fuck with Earth. This shit is Dope. Yeah, man. But you're right. I I do it. If I was like, yeah, if I lived a big, full life, then I'm like, if something happens, fuck it. Yeah. Like if I was wealthy and I did everything down here that I wanted to do and dreamed of doing and it was nothing else, you know what I'm saying? I would do it. But I seen what happened to them Niggas in the stole the can. I'm cool. You mean the submarines in the water? Yeah, I'm good. Yeah. A little different. That was different. The pressure. What's the Difference? You could say the challenger. That that's a, That's a situation. They both are the same.


You see, you searching something that most of the world hasn't seen. So, and it's an adventure. It is a, It is a controlled by. Yeah. But also they took Xbox control and also they, they also, they didn't take the proper, you know, precaution to go down there. Like the, the people has been down there to see the Titanic. They just took a cheaper route. They didn't use the proper material to build the shit. To build whatever the suber. They didn't, I'm not saying, I'm saying the rush is the same. Got it. The reason that the people did those things was to push. Gotcha. You know what I'm saying? So if I was older and I had done mad shit here and there was nothing else for me to do. I've traveled everywhere I wanted to travel.


But What do you mean by that? If you've done everything here, what Is past? If you go right up to the, what's wrong with you do everything right. Every, every girl in the world. Every girl in the World. Right. I just don't know what it means. If I did everything on Earth, I would do it. Crossed Off his bucket list. Yes. They're trying to open that shit up and make it commercial, which I think is crazy. And this is how, this is a start. But a lot of people have Tried to, you mean like just taking like Yeah, Man from Virgin trying to do that. Motherfuckers gonna be up there going, that's gonna be a proposal for some folks. It just seems like situation gonna be some regular shit at some point.


Hot air balloon. First motherfuckers going to hot air balloon. They was like, yo, you crazy as hell. Why you getting off the earth? Why you going up in the air? Right. And now it's regular shit. As it progresses, that's what's going happen. He's right. Alright. I'm gonna wait till I speak to Neil Degrass and what is Bion Antarctica? What? Yo, the flat Earth talk.

Where I don't flame you for filming yourself crying. I'm not too mature to do that. But then I seen other men crying at the Vibes concert. He ain't filming himself though. So then I was like, all right, I'm gonna fall back 'cause if this is a cool event for guys to go cry at, then I'm gonna shut the fuck up. I was ready to flame too.

I didn't know that's where the it came from. Now remember when you and I answered the door? And I hope that's why I didn't get the Wow.


Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's Fine. The best thing a person can do is tell you who they are. Whether you believe 'em or not. It's up to you. And you like I'm gonna tell, I'm telling y'all I'm not fucking with them people for nobody. Stop. Okay. Stop. Not even not on this Ultra Black podcast. You will not, you will not on this broadcast. Okay. Alright. Melyssa just showed me a little story on the side that we're not gonna talk about anyway. Can we talk about something that we can talk about? Yes, Indeed. Yes. Yes. I did want to ask you guys. There's a Mount Rushmore conversation going around. I wanted to ask you guys, who is your Mount Rushmore of white rappers? Ooh, Em's gotta be on there. Yeah. Yeah.


Eminem. I put Mac on there. Mac Everybody please just, I don't just do your Listly list please. Okay. Because that's the point of me asking. I want to hear the different names or the different names. Well, mine, How do I do the Beastie Boys? As one. As One? Okay. Alright. Beastie Boys. Eminem. I'll go back and I'll go damn. Oh yeah. Action bro. Again, I was gonna on my mind Duke. Oh, just, I want say Yeah, You put Action Bronson on Mountain Rushmore Of I guess for my, my my favorite rock. Fuck you.


I'm gonna go, I'm trying to think of who else I would Put in there. I'm gonna go, I like that list. I agree with that. Mack gotta put the BC Boys on there and especially if they count as one. And I'm gonna post Malone. That's my four. I don't think he's a rapper, but, okay. Oh, that's interesting. Postals a rapper. You said That's your fourth Ish? That's My fourth. That's My four. That's your four. Do you wanna participate in this? Yes. I'm in Parks Bronson, Beastie Boys Action. Bronson and Mac Miller. Yeah. I got Beastie Boys search. Okay. And I go Mac, I was thinking Paul Wall too, but I go Mac. Oh Paul Wall's a good one too.


Actually. I go Paul Wall. What's this? My, I I like third base. I like Beastie Boys, but I don't need both of 'em. I Don I was about to say I gotta Go. I Beastie Boys is one. I'll do MI wanna do Everlast just 'cause Okay. Just 'cause I want to do it just to throw some shit. Ain't a shit in the game. That's Not bad. That's not bad. Ain't bad. I mean, jump still is jump. Jump is jump. Jump Is jump to this day. No, they had a career. I Fort mad that any of the rest of the the the fourths. Where Does I would throw Ru's name out there anyway. I wasn't sure if you were gonna throw Vanilla ice in there. I was totally Gonna throw Vanilla Ice in there. You cannot be on there Rushmore. I don't think he can be, but I wouldn't be mad at someone saying that.


I would be mad. I punched him in the face. You're not at Mount Rushmore like I thought Search. But they Search and Pete It wasn't long enough. Yeah, that should just said third base. But yeah, it wasn't long enough. I was thinking be real in there too. Be reals. Not white. He's not not White. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I thought always, all this time I thought be Real was white. No apologies. 'cause part of It is like talent and part of It is Impact. Right. What you want me to say? I thought he was white bro. What is he? Some, I'm not sure what he's Latin. Spanish. Okay. Latin. Okay. Okay. I think I lot of them are white. Lot of Bar. Ask him, man you white people. No. Get the Shit off. No, it's fine. It's fine. We're not a music podcast.


It don't matter. He can take that Shit Off. It don't matter. Like if we talk about just strict bars and people, I enjoy action. Bronson will be up there for me. It'll be Mac it, you know what I mean? Eminem obviously. Yeah. But like the Beastie Boys changed the game in a way, way that you can't ignore. It's why you have to put 'em up. And they have some incredible albums. Right. Oh, great album. But for me, third Base did something different too. 'cause when third base was the first white rappers, I saw that rap like Niggas to me when I, when I heard third base rap, when I watched their videos, I felt like they rap rap. Whereas I didn't feel like that with the Beastie Boys. Even though they, even though I love the Beastie Boys albums, it's still it. Third base felt like they were in the genre, squarely in the genre in a way that I didn't feel from the Beastie Boys. So it was just, It is just a, so to me their impact is, is different.


I can dig it. Yeah. See that's how I felt. Like if it's just who I listen to, it's a different Mount Rushmore. But if I'm talking about what your, that's why I have third base in them up there. I would've MGK on mine. That's another good one. I I would 100% have just Personal, I'm, I'm not mad at that At, I would've have MGK a thousand percent on a personal Mount Rushmore. But you know, And if Ice got to say Be real and I'm saying Chino Excel. Chino X Excel ain't white. I know, but that's, He corrected the record. Rest Chin Jersey, Latin, The Latin Hiphop. Mount Rushmore. Let's just put Latin niggas on that. No, put one down.


That's a different Mount Rushmore. Yeah. Which we can have too if you want. Big pun. Big pun. Fat Joe. Fat Joe. I'll putting B real under there. Putting, be real pun Joe. I'm not putting Pun and Joe, I'm put Pun. Well you never put pun Joe. You're not putting Joe. No, I'm not gonna put Joe puns on You. Oh, punt is the top. Punt is on. It is the top. But you wouldn't put Joe on a on a no. Yo. That's interesting. Free. Who would take his spot? Who? Who would be on the on a Latino this other than him. M Rapper? Yeah. M Nah man. Nah. Joe Joe's not going on mine. Spanish rappers. I don't know. Yo, we just free out. Go ahead. Freestyle dude. Joel Ortiz. Joel Ortiz. Bad bunny.

You kind of have to do Wiz. There's a few of these people that you have to put in all time. I think the first four you said is the, is the answer though. I'm putting me in there on mine. I was gonna ask if you put yourself on there. Yeah. Fab is a problem. How about to say I would have Fab Joe has to go in there F gotta go. I would've Fab Joe. Look at the space. What?

I'm on one.


Well no I'm on one is three like ladies night was big bro. Ladies night. I'm on one is a posse club. Ladies night was big bro. But, but, but but see by the criteria that I'm only going by bdo. 'cause that's what started the conversation. Four needed four more members on there. Four more people on there. BDO is wrong. Three is a box. Oh. If that's the case, still tipping going on today. No, No, no. That's not three. We sticking with. Oh, Alright. I say I got some threes. Would you, would you put French ranking on the Air? What? Don't stop Pop that, pop that air. Hell no Impact French. Gotta squeeze in my mix tape convo too. French got some real good mix tapes, as does Max. You gotta go in that convo. Someone listening to a podcast right now? Yeah. Him. You're Mark. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm looking, I'm looking at, I'm looking at the Posse cut list.


It popped up BDOs thing. I'm Saying Symphony is scenario to me are way too low on this list. I also thought respiration should have been on there. Am I the only person that thought that? I don't think that's poss cut. What's Respiration? Why would it be? He said four MCs. It is common. Most Quali and oh, I guess the remix was my thought. Yeah. Okay. No great song again. The Ladies Night Shit was a monster. Yeah, I'm a monster. That with that was a hit. It was Ladies night. What? It must be Anga honey. They got the sugar and the spice. Oh. If you say after Angie now she'll smack the shit outta you. Why she don't like rap career? I'm, I won't speak for her, but don't run up on her singing the lyrics to any one of her songs.


No, what's the other one? Maybe That Lady Night Ladies Nights might be cool if I could go. She gonna smack you. Damn. You'll fly away. Fucking Sicario. Fuck Itsari Was right. That Shit. It is hip hop shit. It is. Right. All right. All right. What else? What else is in music? What else is in music? Do y'all care about this Ja Rule 50 Cent Shit? I do. I I've been following. I'm, I'm obsessed with it always. But this iteration I thought was interesting. I, first of all, I hated the response 50 gave to when Irv Gotti died. I thought that that was awful when I saw Ja Rule Go Breakfast Club and respond to it finally after all his time. It felt like he was rising above it. Like, you know, like we're masters of self defense.


We're not gonna start nothing. You know, I didn't like this, but I took the good advice a preme and I thought that was gonna be the end of it. I thought it was gonna be a good, a good moment. Then he hits Twitter the next day, like, yo, I got time and then just started coming at 50 again. And you know, it's gonna be a response. It's been decades of this. I know they're never gonna hit a stage together. I know that they're never gonna be friends. And I've, I've accepted that in life. Some people just don't need to be friends. But these, I I feel like they could give a different model. They could, they could model something different for everybody. They could just let this shit go. You know what I mean? At this point, everybody's successful, everybody's good. They look to me, two 50-year-old men going back and forth on Twitter looks crazy. Last time I said something like this, I had naked AI pictures on the internet. First and a half you were shiming down, shim away Club wall.


Take it away with what you guys think. Ericsson camera off me. Nah, it's just, It is just a, a bad thing. Like Mark's saying like it's 50 50-year-old successful dudes and hopefully no violence could come from it, but violence came from it. Right? No more violence. But that was A long time ago, bro. Niggas and some people don't let that shit go, bro. We sit here and joke about if it's up, it's up. Some niggas really live by that. That's why like I get, I I understand the mature side of it. I also get 50 side. I hate ice. What's 50 side? I absolutely hate ice. Why? I swear I agree with him Bro, forever. You. I'm not mad you with you. Why? Why, why not? Why talking about?


Because hold On. I feel like, I feel like I feel you're asking me, so I speaking, talking about the character, the person we've referring to, I feel like what ice, I didn't start talking about you talking ice. I didn't come back to me. You said that you would agree with that. I need to understand that theory. I just feel like what ICE is saying is such a young man's quote. Yes, yes. Sounds And us as older men Got it. Don't really need to echo a quote that is made for the youngins. It is up, It is up for life. Those are for people. The the 20-year-old people that view themselves having a lot of life left. Hey Joe, this is a 50, this is two 50 year olds. That's up for life With No, no, no. And that's why I'm saying it does not mean the same thing when we get to talking about 50-year-old men.


I'm not talking about them and how they do things. But, but That's the Conversation. But no, but that's not a normal, that's not a normal outlook for people our age with tendonitis and, and arthritis With hundreds of millions of dollars, my nigga that have seen some shit in the world. Right? You should have modified how you think in your, in your mindset on the world. You got little kids looking at you, my nigga. So one, one hand we gonna talk about part I, that that's, I don't even think that Part even relevant. Well That I talk about with ice sometimes because ice takes this staunch stance on I'm snitching, I'm ratting, we not going to writing, I'm not ratting, but go ahead. We you say you are ratting, but snitching going to the ginnings. Thank you. Whatever. Go ahead. Go ahead Ish.


Go ahead Ish. Go Ahead. Whatever the case may be. But then on the same time it's like, yo, if it's up, it's up. And I'm, and I'm not condoning but kind of condoning this message. I, I think that that shit is, I think that that shit is horrible. Allow me to respond. I can talk for me. Oh shit. I'm being objective. I'm telling you that for someone who's who 50 Cent showed us who he is his entire career, I can understand his stance on it. Not saying I agree with it, but I get why he's acting the way he's acting and he's not gonna change on this. Gotcha. It's forever Up in his eyes. It is. 'cause he's probably one of two 50 year olds in hip hop, still in fighting condition. Him and fucking Freddie Fox. The rest of everybody got normal 50-year-old bodies and 50-year-old breath.


And if you punch one of you niggas the wrong spot. Y'all niggas running around drunk, pilled up fitting all up. You hit one of you niggas the wrong way and y'all bump your head, you gonna be dead. Stop it please. And all the niggas that got busy with the hands from back in the day, I'm looking at y'all now at 50. Y'all look one sugar tablet away from it being the end. Please. You tough 50 year olds except for 50. But we again, y'all moving it, we talk You said except for 50. That's who we talking about. That's Not who we talking to though. Right? That's not who we talking to though. Right? That's who we talking about. I get what you saying. You understand where It is, how he line. That's who we talking about.


Said When I say I understand why he's acting this way, he talking about I hate ice For that take. No, but but I think what people, I understand it too freeze. I don't understand. But how you understand it? Oh shit, I don't understand how you understand that point. Why not? Because I'm being open-minded and I he's told I believe a person who tells You who the fuck they are. Going Back to the point we're not talking about that. We talking about how we, the people in this room are viewing this particular scenario. If you That's what we talking about. Nick, you got shot. Let man is one v one with freeze. No, hold on. We're not having a one V one. It's not a one v one. Well let him have the conversation please. But I but the conversation, I have a theory on the conversation. Shoot. So wait till they finish he can shoot. No, go ahead. Flip. I'm not shooting at you. You've been shot before. Yeah. So what I'm saying is that you've been shot, have you forgave it forgiven the man that shot you, have you sat down with him?


If you see him today, the man that shot you, would you sit down with him, have a drink? No, be cool. Okay. That man almost lost his life period. He was blackballed by these people where he feel like he was blackballed. A lot of things happened to this man that he overcame the odds. So now while it could be a a, a skewed way of thinking, now his thing is, I'm up, I'm up and it's up forever because you guys tried to take this from me. You guys try to take my passion. If I didn't fight through it, persevere through it, I would no longer be here to provide for people. Gotcha. I understand that way. The person that shot me as well, I didn't feel, I I don't feel comfortable speaking to that person, the person that broke my jaw.


It was very difficult to sit down across from the person while having same thoughts in your mind. And that, and it, it takes more than that when your life is on the line. Seriously. So when I say I do get it because they are figures, but I do understand it as well and I would expect you to understand it. I know you're speaking from a mature standpoint, but you've been through something traumatic as well. And if you wouldn't sit with the guy that shot you, we shouldn't expect that from others. But isn't there a third route of just I don't expect leave it all's. Exactly. Look you fl it don't gotta be one or but then both. Yeah, go ahead. It don't gotta be one or two. I wouldn't expect 50 Cent Ja Rule to give a fuck about each other till the day they die. Right.


Like that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that yo do and if you in 50 Cent shoes, in my opinion, nigga, I made you niggas look like pa peons, he already won. Right. I'm a couple hundred million dollars up through all the shit y'all put me through, through all the adversity I went through to get to this point. Suck my dick. I won, I beat the game at this point. And 50 Cent is also the same person who's lived his line says if it's war, It is war to the very end. And anytime they think they back we started up again. And and that's, and that's the part, that's the part that's unhealthy I think and dangerous. Got it. No, I'm with you Fat Joe. Trying squash though. Yeah. Fat Joe was trying to squash it with them. Yeah. 50 was open to squashing it and Ja Rule wasn't.


Okay. Right. So like I said, both of 'em, I, I think the shit is crazy. I'm not, I'm not. It's, It is about both of them. I'm talking about yo at 50 years old and we carrying ourselves like this, my nigga, they both Rich supposedly. I can't count nobody pockets but dog, the kids is watching you. Got you. I my advice would be to leave it alone. Just leave it alone. Yeah. I got it. Tell a nigga suck my yo. You know what I'm saying? Like I wouldn't speak on either side. I'd be like dog, I'm not fucking with him now. They could just be dead to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's how you do it. Man's may maybe get Wallo to intervene. I do. I'm so he's a peacekeeper. I'm so glad that you said that. I wanted to ask you guys where y'all stood on the Wallo speaking engagement that he had where he started talking about how he felt about black businesses.


Soon as I find the clip Mark, I'm assuming that you've heard the Yeah, the clip. Okay. And I love Wallo is my guy. I, I'm, I'm a Wallo fan. I'm, I consider him a friend. We do business together sometimes, you know, in terms of him supporting the store, things like that. But he, that shit was the most off base thing I've ever heard Wallo say. Where was he when he made the statement? He was speaking from the clip. It looked like he was speaking to a group of either entrepreneurs or business owners or something like that. And he was kind of giving him a motivational speech about business and things like that because his whole thing was, I'm not here to tell, I'm not here just to make you feel good. I'm gonna give you the real too. And I have the clip here. Nobody Want to hear us.


Oh I'm black, no black people. Nobody gives a fuck about that. Kill that shit. Either you got a good business or you don't. All that shit. Don't nobody want to hear that shit. That's a hustle. Support me 'cause I got a black business. It is your restaurant clean. It is a food good. Do you got consistent cooks? It is the material or your shit Good. Come on, stop doing that. Oh you support the white people? Nah, I support consistency baby. Fuck. About what color you is. I'm gonna spend my money you that paper I'm gonna spend them deals. Where the fuck I wanna spend it at S porch for R Lemon. I'm going to do what the fuck I wanna do while I'm here. But I'm gonna tell you one thing. I ain't gonna be finessed off some black shit. But one thing about lose your listen to you motherfuckers is not going to make it.


I'm not no motherfucking fake ass motivational speaker that talk this dumb shit. I'm the number one nigga in the country. You know why y'all seen me come out the penitentiary I me millions and I'm make millionaires baby. You understand me? I come from the ghetto. Tell me why you found it offensive And that's just the first word that came to mind. It might not be offensive, but just tell me what was wrong with what he said. I think a lot of times the most dangerous things that are said are lightly dipped in truth. So bars. So it's not that anything specific he said is wrong. Like there's nothing wrong with saying I don't I wanna be colorblind here.


I'm Sorry. Just let them get it girl, that that shit was poetic from the distance. No I ain't like it. 'cause when she first asked Mark it made it sound like she might have had a different opinion. Yeah, he say two side bar bars, mark. Yeah. Well does shut your as up down. No, I lit. I I do though. But keep going. I Know you so, so if you take each of the things he says in individually, like okay, you know, you know race, we shouldn't just look at race. Sure. You, if you run a business you shouldn't, you shouldn't be riding on the back of just being black and expect people to support you. If it's a bad business because you're black, your cook should be lined up your shit, your business should be tight, the restaurant should be clean. All that's true. Most of y'all not gonna make it.


I actually think that's an important thing to tell any business owner, any entrepreneur, all that is good. But what the takeaway comes from that is we don't have to, we don't need to have a special responsibility or a special duty to support black businesses because they're black. And I think as black people, we absolutely have a duty to support black businesses because they're black. Whether they're good or not. I totally disagree. See that? That's where the, that's where the man comes in land. I'm letting, that's where the straw man comes again. I'm not saying keep going to a restaurant that that has rats in it. But what I'm saying is he's saying he, he's framing it almost like he said it's a finesse. This, you know, riding off this black show or I'm not gonna support you just 'cause you black. I'm saying yo, we should support businesses just 'cause they black. We should pay special, extra attention because they black. 'cause a lot of times what black people do, which frustrates me as a black business owner and everybody heres a black business owner.


So y'all understand this is that niggas will throw us away so fast. If somebody has to wait for 10 minutes at the Soul food restaurant. Man these nigga, I gotta wait. I had to wait 25 minutes for my soul food. I ain't never coming back and get, but they'll Wait, they'll will, they'll wait like an hour at Houston's nigga. They won't have a buzzer at the Olive Garden waiting for an hour for to, to get that, that food. Right. They give us no grace, no mercy, no breaks. And I'm saying we need it. No, no community has the money. Leave their community faster than black dollar. That's fine. We give that shit away quick. And we love to give it to the, to the, to the dry cleaner. The Rerate here touch one hand and it goes straight to the, thats outside of the community. So I'm saying we have a responsibility not to play into that. And I don't, and and Wallo does support black business. Like I said, he, he makes extra ships to my bookstore just to buy books when he can buy 'em from Amazon for a lot cheaper, frankly.


But when you send that message out, it's dangerous 'cause people hear the wrong thing. But you're proving his point with him supporting your business and that and what you said. But they don't know that. Didn't say I'm the people who hear that clip ain't gonna know he does that. That's the that's my issue. It's the message that's that's It is like we just said with John 50, it's it's the message and the people that hear that and what do they do? People who are inclined to not support a business because it's black. But if he's telling the business owners or the the entrepreneurs, Hey don't run your business. Don't look for your business to don't look for my business or anyone's business just because you're black have something else to offer. Because there's people that's just, they come up to me, yo man support black owned business, but this is a bad product.


Yep. This is poorly just cheap. It is this, It is that. And I'm like, I I wouldn't mind supporting it if it was a good product. Yeah. How about put that, that's where the finesse part come in. Like I could do subpar shit and use just outta obligation shit to I'm because I'm black. That's a finesse. And he's white. I think he is right on that point. The problem is two things. One, the people who hear that don't get that message. And two part of being a black business is working with other black businesses. So it's not, I get what you're saying. This is like an inside conversation with the restaurant owners. Like, look, don't just think you could ride off being black. Right. Don't that riding off black a hustle. The problem is again, instead of having that conversation in isolation, I'm saying in addition to that conversation, we need to have a conversation encouraging black people to buy black shit.


Because otherwise that black business owner, do they get the black sandwich distributor? Do they get the black janitorial company to to, to help work in their business? That's the part I'm worried about. And if people don't get that extra push to say yo, support them because they're black. And I think sometimes at this moment we're afraid to say that I'm saying support, support people because they're black and he's saying I'm gonna be colorblind. Right. I'm going to support people purely based on whether supply people They're answering you and saying no. Yeah. And I'm saying I disagree. That's what they're saying. I disagree. Yeah. And, and I and I disagree with that take. I see, I see. I I I hear Mark's take, I think Mark's taking wall's take a different I think so. So, so I don't think Mark is is is he mainly let finish opposed to what Wallo was saying?


I see both sides. He's Saying you shouldn't say it Publicly. He don't wanna highlight. See I feel like adding the other part he's talking to, I can see if he put this like as a clip out just to the world, somebody recording it and putting it out is different. He's talking to a group of entrepreneurs. Right. So my message is for the business owners, Hey y'all don't go out there marketing looking for your support just 'cause you black Now somebody recorded him, put it out and get out. Cool. Yes. But I think he's doing this the right way. I'm talking to the business owners telling them focus on making a good product. Not focused on getting support. Just 'cause you black I again, I agree. So it's not like you agree with him. I agree with that message. I'm saying that message is dangerous when it gets put out in that way.


Because in a world that already looks to not support black shit, I'm saying I'm, I think you need to add a little more to that to so that people get the full picture. What Could he have said? What could he have said added onto it that would have flushed out the entire message. Now if the product is good, I'm gonna support you because you're black. No, I think you should. I kind Of feel like he Said that though. No, I think, no, he's saying I'm supporting you because the product is good. I'm saying it's okay to say I'm supporting you. Not just 'cause the product is good because you're black. Black. Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna support you initially because you're black period. Boom. I'm gonna support you initially because you're black. If your service is good and if your product is good, I'm gonna continue to support you because you're black. If you are lacking in my man just opened up a restaurant across the street life after, that's my man.


Right. So anybody that I know, I tell 'em, yo my man open the restaurant. Go to life after. Go to life after. Right. I'm telling the people to do that. Now I also, when my friends go there, I'll get yo how was it feedback And people have given me positive, mostly positive feedback and then the little bit of negative feedback that they give me, I tell my man directly, yo this is what my people said, yo this is what my people said when they came there. But initially I'm gonna support your product because you are black. The niggas that I who clothes I wear on this show, I've never taken a dime from nobody who shit I wore on the show. I'm supporting this because you are a small black business and that's what I want to do. Now if your product is trash, I'm not gonna keep supporting you based off the simple fact that you black.


And that's what I think while Wallo was trying to convey like yo dog, your consistency, your cooks, your product, your service, all of those things need to be up to par because if they're not then I'm going over here to the whites. I feel like Mark is just saying it was more not so anti-black way to sound that He could have presented it. Yes, that's what I said. Like yo, I'm it Possible that that was cut out somewhere since this is a a cell phone. I think it's possible. Yeah, it's Possible. There may be more from the seminar and this is the part that that's took off. Damn. That's Fair. I've owned the business over 20 something years so I'm not gonna tell somebody not to go support and you should shoot to my plumbers, my electricians, whoever the fuck I hire. I'm trying to hire black first.


I'm gonna try and hire black first. Now if I don't have success with that, I still got a business to run. So therefore I don't give a fuck if a nigga's purple. If you could get on the roof and the bitch stop leaking, I'm gonna give my money to the purple man. But I'm gonna shoot for the black roofer first. And that's all I'm saying And that's all I'm saying. And I think it's important. That's the other piece of it, right dog. We do this my the hoodies, my nigga, nigga never touched one of my hoodies. They be like, yo dog, he not Nike. What does that mean? What the fuck does that mean? So Nike is worthy of your money but because I'm black and I'm starting out, I'm not worthy of your money. When you take my hoodie sleeves and you stick 'em next to Nike hoodie sleeves, this shit is clearly superior to Nike.


Our mindset is fucked up. And so that's what I think Mark Yeah. Is, is is speaking to. Right. I think both of the people have poignant point in the neutral world. I wouldn't care where Did you get to Nike. It don't matter. To the Outlet. Yeah. That good Outlet. That's not Nigga Footlocker Nike can't fuck on my hoodie. Ooh, tell 'em niggas there. I agree. And Amani singing better than Sade. I don't care what y'all saying. He stood down on that shit on Twitter either. He was like, I don't want that shit. I couldn't wait for him to get here. I was gonna ask him to s give us a little something. Let's see, let be the judge of that. And I'm talking shit With mind. Say can sing better than Charade. Huh? He said that, he said that when we was having the charade conversation on Friday. Yeah. He didn't say he can sing better than he said. You know seven, he know seven people from, he said he know a bunch of people.


No, no Didn he said, he said I can sing better, I can sing better than Shy did. We were so busy roasting him. You didn't, we didn't hear that point. 'cause I heard it on the replay. I didn't hear it live. I heard it on the replay. He said I can sing better than I didn hear that on Twitter. He was like, yeah, I was just talking shit. I went too far. Oh Yeah. Good thing come act like I ain't read that tweet. Acknowledge I don't follow you bro. Mel, what do you stand on? What Wallo said, I can understand Mark's point like in terms of maybe he didn't say it with the eloquence that he could have said it, but I mean Wallo just, he just, he just talks, you know what I'm saying? Like he's, he's so energized, you know, and he thinks he's, the message is understood the way that he, you know, the way it's just, it's left up to interpretation kind of thing.


If he had said, I will start by buying black, I'm looking for the consistency though. Like if I buy black and it just fails to, you know, kind of like have a con a point of consistency, then I'm not gonna continue to buy from this cont from this business. Right. But I'm always going to like Ish said, I'm always going to look for black First and that's all I want. And I, I think we have to constantly tell black people that because every single one of us has experienced a situation where we got passed over when we were just as good because we were black by, by black people. Don't nobody love white people more than black people. Indeed. And so every opportunity people get to PR to choose white, they choose it unless they're encouraged to do otherwise.


And you're absolutely right when it comes to us not having the patience for each other, you know, standing in line for 10 minutes versus you know, going to Houstons and standing in line for a fucking hour. You Right. Buying Nike over issues, hoodies, you know, so yeah. Hey Mark, you a lawyer Black. Which, which lawyer? Just asking a question. Well it depends on which lawyer. Oh. I just remember you coming in here saying you my Personal injury have your, your white lawyer. So, so here you go. And of course that was tongue in cheek a little bit. Ah, okay. My personal injury lawyer. You said that live What? Yeah, Well we said it at the beginning of the show and then I was like, is this recorded? And we said yeah, but like, yeah, I don't care about it. My personal injury lawyer, the one who gave me all my money and the one who I gave a large chunk of money to as a percentage is black.


You know what I mean? I don't actually do I have a white lawyer at all? I have a white agent. I I do have a white agent. Your Brother's not your lawyer? My brother's black. No, my brother's my personal injury lawyer. No, that's but He's not my that's no, but that ain't the real one thing. I mean personal injury lawyer, he said it, he got all his money from him. Yeah, I had, I had a, I had a traumatic fall and got about what, four 50 I think about two years ago. And I went to, I went to a black lawyer and he's my brother but I would've gone to a different black lawyer otherwise I don't have a problem going to a black lawyer. My accountant is Black, my accountant's black and a woman. There you go. Check, check My agent's not, but would I, would I have a black agent? I, I'd love to have a black agent. It just didn't work out that way. My agency doesn't have black agents.


Got you. Yeah, but I think, I think again I start with a black person and if it, so I don't go To William Johnson. So the Mark talking, I be Doing plays and shit. Yeah man, See that's, that's the whole shit, right? This nigga save me too. Maeta got or seven. Yeah this guy's a duck. No man look, think Different than whatever point Walla was trying to bring home. If that's how you get to speak to niggas after speaking engagement sign me off. Oh man. Because you imagine Joe, you kidding? He is just going in there and talking to people like shit, no, I better know y'all. I the number one nigga in America.


Hey y'all gonna fail, you're not gonna make it. And I don't give a fuck if you black. Wait, what then then nigga pay me, They give 50 for That. Holy shit, I've been doing this all wrong. Hell hey I'll go out there and jump on the ledge if that's what we're doing, I'll talk to him too. Hey, hey creators call me up, I'll go talk to you. Yeah, Some people need that tough love. I agree With Alo too by the way. I just agree with Mark also that that's not applicable across the board. Yeah right. I don't, I don't, I support black business. If you lead out with that and there's nothing that follows, then I'm gonna look at you a little shady.


But also if you are a black business then that's gonna prompt a conversation from me too though. It's not just like when I'm in the mall and the niggas on the first floor hustling out the fucking after cubes and they say, yo Joe, if I'll, I'll stop and talk to the niggas, see what they on. Yo man where you from? How long you been right here? How much this cost to get this now versus when you say after some niggas in the mall and they be like, yo, Jabba it's poor black business. And I'd be like no. And Nigga fuck you nigga Fuck. Lemme tell you how it goes the other way. Yo Joe, I love you support. Nah. Alright fuck you.


I never was in that mood nigga. Mark, why we Don't just get a longer screw for this thing? Like I don't feel like that's normal for this mic to fall out. My Mine do the same. I think it's like Wheels, some real crack edge. They real short. My shit is never, my shit don't fall out. Mm. That was some sloppy shit. I'm Just saying that was disgusting. We fucking in the same room before so I know you just talking about the mic. No I'm not. They came back for me. It is time for the gay segment. Okay. They go, they came back for me. They took your money. You Need, they don't think they're in competition with each other money around. Right, right. It stayed in Ish. Yeah. And he ain't pay at all. And proud of it all these years. Wow.


How I am. Fuck You talking about Y'all. Yo, y'all, y'all gonna be 80. They gonna be 80 years yo. Not if he continues to sugar at this rate. I don't eat drink yo. Why? Talking about that. Yo don't if you, if you do the red meat every day, right? Watch your mouth talking to him like that. Yo, I just want my mic fixed. You just Ate some pork? What'd that mean? I just ate some pork. He's judging you. Ask chant. He can't Judge me. He said something about sugar. I said something about pork. He did. You've been two 70 since he got got here. I've never been two 70 and Gonna lose weight. I've never It is back and made a bet and made a bet and still couldn't shed the weight. I've never been two 70 in my life. 2 65.


You, You ain't far behind. Wherever I Am, far behind that. I'm not. I've never been to 70. So I'm far behind that. I've never been 2 65. I've never been two 60. Y'all should do a weight loss challenge. Why don't y'all see who could lose the Oh my God. Tried. We tried. They did. They did. Never. Who lost the most weight, Joe? No, we never had a weight loss Joe. It wasn't a weight loss challenge. It was Joe Ish came in here and told us he would be a certain weight in two months and refused to step on the scale. Why did you lose the bet? Or you just didn't wanna step on the I lost the bet. Okay. Why y ever a head-to-head competition? Never. Because There is no competition. Yeah, yeah. Silly me. What was I thinking? I do it all it's gonna take is one of 'em. Say nigga I could lose more weight than you. And that's all I'm saying.


That's it's, I'm not entertaining none of that shit no more bro. Because be just win since anytime he says I could blank more than you, y'all go y all go. It's, you know what? I just, I just, I just saw, I put everything together. I just saw that behind the scenes shit. I saw niggas talking about it. So last week you over that water shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had some strong opinions on that. Yeah, let's hit it. If I was a judge I would say Joe was right. Really? No, you wouldn't. This is what I'm saying. Lemme tell you what I would do And it and it the spirit of which y'all were, wait, maybe I'm saying that backwards. Hold on. The sp I'm sorry. If I was a judge, if you were a judge you would say issue. I would say.


Right. Excuse me. You're right. There you go. There you go. You're right. I bro. And if it was a judge I would say you were right. But the spirit of it I thought was about the quality of the water or not just about whether you bring water. But technically based on what was said, you absolutely were right. If I was a judge, I would've said you were right. That, that that's, that's fair. So next time y'all make a bet, let's make one with clear rules. Clear stipulations. Why don't y'all do a 90 day challenge? Who lose the most weight? I just get gratification in knowing that he couldn't do the shit that he was saying he could do. Even if he gets the win on the bet, I don't care. I don't care about that part. But I knew he wasn't gonna bring that quality water in here for two months straight. That Just wasn't gonna happen. Was that your understanding of the bet though, when you were going through it or you just thought you had to bring water fan?


We've been having this bet for two months. The one I bought a po I was running late. I bought a Poland Spring water. I had a full green water in the refrigerator. I bought a ping spring water that I didn't even drink here. Right. But our bet was you will not bring water here for two months consistently straight. That was our bet. It's not true. That was how that my lemme not say that. That is true. That may Have been let finish speaking. May been let land my plane. You lemme land. My Wasn't smart enough to know what the Fuck the boy can I land my plane please? The water talk was could you be quiet and speak? Could you Be playing stupid? Go. Could you be quiet and lemme speak? No. You be playing grimy and you always look for a loophole to alleviate yourself out of some bullshit loophole.

And you got super upset at Finesse when we played Monopoly and you did the same exact shit that he did. You look for a loophole to escape. We replayed this shit live. We heard all of the terms of the bet and this nigga still said he's not wrong. What do we talking about When me and Joe placed the bet and I lost all of y'all niggas up here was on my ass every day. Yo, you paid 'em yet you lost. You lost. You paid him Yet when Joe loses y'all niggas swallow the whistle and everybody becomes a fucking mind. I said You right. Never swallowed A whistle in two to two Months. Ain't up once in college bro. Bet ain't up yet. I'm saying so.


So like I said my nigga but they can't say you wanted the best not up. I'm clearly right in the terms You right of of of the, in terms of the bet You right played. The whole shit ain't right to me. He went to go find some shit that was said two hours after that. Once the bet is made, nigga you know Up. Shit. Fuck that bet nigga keep fighting for Me too. What you talking about nigga? The same way I wipe my As. Oh yeah. I'll It listen. Yeah I'm not, I'm not. I'm off the bet. Wipe my, I'm off of your general understanding of what my point was. Fuck That bet. I don't know what your point was. I know you don't. We spoke to what your point was. I don that day. I don come on. My point is proven. It's fine. I'm not trying to prove it to y'all. He's saying his point is you not gonna bring the know what the fuck my point was.

Why the fuck would you lean on them one day that I didn't s that was the be s That wasn't the bet though. 'cause that was the premise. The bet of the conversation. That's your premise.

Like me? Oh, should be Travis Kelsey. I want a real one. She ain't gonna be kissing Matt Damon. It should be a black guy. Yeah, Aaron here. It should be a shorter black guy, Kevin Hart Than that would, would be. I wanna See that front row Cat Williams. Man. I ain't even get to what the funniest part would be to me. What let Taylor Swift do? I always love you. I'm here for it. She gonna smoke Swifty Swifty unite. She Going what? You're a swifty. You're a swifty. I don I hear a lot of judgment in that question. Yeah, There is. There's a lot of judgment. A lot of judgment. A lot of judgment. Dressed Like a fucking swifty. It is fine. That's fine. Look, Taylor Swift is super talented and she's made some great albums.


I like folklore more than some of the mainstream albums, you know? Oh Shit. He is really getting into a swift Take it away And the play is gone. Hey. But I'm not, I'm not shake It off. You. You know the song now you the song nigga. I I do know the song. Exactly. My daughter loves this song. Look ahead. Just, just your daughter, right? Yeah. My girl. Don't fuck with that. I but you. But You Right. Talking about you. I Know Song You is the question. And you know, You know all that shit, nigga. I, Taylor Swift is super talented. Yes. I like her music. I don't, I'm not like a Stan, but I do like her music and I, I think she gets a too much criticism. I think she gets way too many awards and she's one of people that gets so many awards that people start hating on on her as if she's giving 'em to herself. True. Like, I ain't mad at her.


'cause she get awards that she don't deserve. You know what I mean? It is. But I think she'd be great in in The Bodyguard. The Bodyguard was made for a pop singer. It was, it was for Diana Ross first for Do you listen to it in the little compact car you're rent in like real life. Right? By the way, it's not even a gallant, it's a mirage. I realized when I got downstairs, oh, that's A little one. That's why y'all always so surprised that it was so big. It looked like a smart car. I feel like this contradicts your Wallo point. Uhoh which part? I feel Like there's a way to say what you're saying right now in a different way, right? Like, it's important for black actresses to have prominent roles in blockbuster movies. Yeah. And now you're just fine with Taylor Swift Taking it. You know why? Because The, Because She's not an actor.


Here's why. Here's why. Because I support, unlike y'all, I believe in black men to support black men. When the movie was first made, The first I see when, when the movie was made, it was for, I don't think so when it was made out, when the script, when when the opposite, when the script was written. It was for Ryan O'Neill and, and Diana Raw. So that's what it became in the seventies. Written the script was ripped like 40, 60, 40, 50 years ago. Hollywood wouldn't make it. Well how do You had this information here? Yo, he's the Best. Yo he's the best. So, so they, so they keep making the films right? And so, but the idea is always that there'd be a racial back, you know, opposite race thing. So they've done it for black women two times. So I'm saying if you have, if they keep that pattern going, now you got a white woman. So now a black man finally gets a chance they could go represent on the main street.


They could go Black Panther too, dude, Namar. They could, but I think they're not, I think they're gonna go with a big strong black man. A Jonathan Majors and Michael B. Jordan. Aaron Pierre. What you talking about from Latin Panther? Yeah. He trying to say he go brown instead of black. But I'm saying like, but who's the black Kevin Costner? Right? That might be, man, they get the rock to Do that. Well It is just, He's black. It is a black man right there. Yo, you know how many people listen to his broadcast? Why you keep saying Aaron? She said Aaron name like seven, seven times. Taylor his man's name because he is an actor Before he's her man. Mm. That Matter. That ain't true. Who said that? Okay, ask him. Oh, you asked do You want, do you wanna be defined by your relationship or the work that you've put out?


Depend on who you're in a relationship with. A lot of motherfuckers listen got definition. Oh, you about to call with they name. Oh, Tiana. Tiana is ti is fucking amazing. So if you saw, what's his name? Aaron p Aaron. Aaron Perry. I don't know if I, if I ain't singing the j hud song. P Aaron Pier. So if you saw him, that's what you ask him. What? Like how he wants to be defined by your job or by that bitch. Watch your fucking Mouth. I'm not putting it like that at all Right now. Right. Get outta it. I'm Not thinking Like that at all. But if we're Thinking, we'll say that game again Though. Okay, fine. Ap. Oh shit. Okay. So I'm thinking About you ain't, I'm thinking about Younger.

Stop saying They gonna treat you like the eight they treat the 18. Any whos Moving right along. Even though that was funny. I wanted to stay here, but I, I'd be viewed away. Joe, Is everyone here familiar with the Carmelo Anthony story?


Indeed. Not the basketball player. Indeed, indeed. The young black man that they arrested for the murder of Austin Metcalf Austin. Austin Metcalf. Yes. Who his bail was a million dollars. And recently the judge, black lady judge, shout out to her, reduced it to two 50. Two 50. Now he's been released on House arrest. Yes. He's on house arrest. Yes. He's on house arrest. This, this story, there's a new fact that, that we find out new facts about this story every week. There's a lot of outrage behind it. Where does everybody here, Stan, What's the new fact? That's what we need to know first. Well, every week there's been a new fact about where this fight started.


Who started it? Who was supposed to be in that section of the school? Like who was in the right, who's in the wrong, just new facts. I I, I think for me the, the first part about it for me is about the bail. Reducing the bail I think is important. And this is a reminder to black people, especially I'll say even just activists in in social justice minded people, but also black people. Bail is not a punishment. A lot of times we root for the people. We don't like to get high bails. Like when a cop shoots somebody like give 'em $10 million bail, give 'em a $50 million bail. The point of bail is not to be a punishment. You're innocent until proven guilty. And for every killer cop that gets a, an exorbitant bail for every white racist that gets an exorbitant bail, thousands of our children get bails that are so high that we can't get out.


80% of people in, in, in jail around America are there not because of any threat to safety, not because of any, any mental illness issue. Not 'cause of bureaucratic issue. 80% of the people in jails around this country are there because they don't have enough money for bail. I'm talking about prison. I'm talking about jail. This is before trial, before you've been convicted. That means 80% of the people who are in jail are there because they, they're too poor to not be in jail. Yes. The Khali Browder, right. The Khali Broder is a perfect example. They're literally too poor to not be in jail. And that is a crisis. So the next time y'all root for the cop that kills somebody, or the crazy person that does some awful shit to get the, to just get root with bail, understand that that same thing is gonna happen to your children. Or somebody like Carmelo Anthony, who from what I see is, was, was dealing with something that's far more complicated than what the initial news story and initial police reports were saying.


Yeah. So let me ask you, I I I disagree with Mark's point, Which Point the judges do use bail as punishment. I'm saying they shouldn't. No, but you said it's not being issued as punishment. It shouldn't be. I'm saying shouldn't be a punishment. I'm saying bail is not a punishment. I'm saying theoretically. Yes. Oh, okay. Okay. Bail judges used all time. They definitely use that shit as punishment. We've seen same judge, same court, same this same, that same charge. And one person's bail will be a million dollars. Somebody else's bail will be a hundred. I told you they gave my brother a million dollars. You get what I'm saying? But your brother got it. But what I'm saying, not that brother. I'm joking now. I'm joking. But so we've definitely seen that shit be used as punishment. And I think that against us, puff puff ain't no, well it could be a flight risk, but you get what I'm saying.


Like some of that shit is, is a little crazy. And here's the other thing. Statistics show that an exorbitant bail doesn't really make people more likely to come back to court. You get what I'm saying? So, so it doesn't even work for the thing they say it's for. They're like, oh, if we just make, if you owe this much, you'll definitely come back to court. People who don't come to court don't come to court. They're not coming. They're not coming to court. Yeah, that's true. Alright. So that's the, the bell aside. Like the other piece of It is, I, I think again, there's always a rush to judgment. And I get social media has an impulse and even news reports now, there was a time when, when there were only three news channels, you have time to work a story and develop a story and get the facts on the story. Now the goal is not to get the story right. It's to get the story first. Get first and sell and sell it. Yeah. And getting the story first almost always happens at the detriment of the victims.


And in this case, the victim might be Carmella. So I'm, I'm not saying just the person who gets killed, I'm saying whoever's being wronged, the less information we have, the more easy It is for them to fly under the radar. So I think again, this is just a reminder, as Joe was saying, every week new facts come out. Yes. And those new facts make this a whole different story than what people thought it was initially. That's all. So what was the initial perception that this black kid killed this white kid? Because he asked him to move. He didn't belong under the, in that, in that area that he was sitting in that section that he was sitting in and basically that he was being a bully. Then when the, the black kid being the bully white, Of course that was the perception Of first that the initial initial that the black kid was just being the ho again. And now because All 'cause all the story was is black kid murders white kid in Texas, white Boy.


Right. And the Texas article fucking We in Texas. So as the details continued to come out, it was like okay, he wasn't a bully. Oh shit. It wasn't just the white boy. It was the white boy and his brother. Oh shit. These guys are six Salva tall and Right. Oh shit. He wasn't supposed to be right there. And I said like, that's what I mean, facts just keep coming. I wanted to report on this weeks ago, but too many facts were coming out. So I'm like, let slow down again to be he Responsible. Gotcha, Gotcha. Yeah. But it's Texas. It's Texas. The story basically is just about a black man's right. To defend himself in Texas. Right. Which doesn't exist. Right. Texas and Florida love the stand your ground, Your Ground until doctrine shit.


Yep. Until, until you black until So You black and the victim is white. Yep. That's crazy. They were showing like Carmelo Anthony with like pictures with guns and stuff like that. And then people came out and showed the brothers with guns and stuff like that. Texas is It is Texas. Yeah, exactly. It's Texas. They were trying to just paint him as some sort of bad capital. And that's what the media does. Yep. The media or media out to the people that came forward And shout out to the young man that lost his life as well. Of course. Right. Like that's important as they clear up the facts of the matter or Mark don't get fall. I mean it depends on what he did. I need more information to know if I'm shouting about, okay Mark, easy. If you instigate a fight that leads to a death sequence, I'm not necessarily feeling sorry for you, but what if it was the other way around?


But we don't know that. Just yesterday still. That's why I said I need more. I said I need more information to make a decision about how I feel about him. What if it was the other way around? What do you mean? What if the, what if the black kid got killed by the white kid? Would you feel the same And the black kid like jumped him or started him? We don't know at the, again, I'm not saying they did that. I'm saying I need more information to make a judgment on, on how I feel about that death. That's point what I'm saying. The point, the point. If somebody stuck you up and you shot them, am I supposed to feel bad about the person trying to stick you up? Yeah. You, you be confused. Confused me? I don't know the story. I'm just saying I don't know what really happened. So I'm not, I'm not one of people to be like rest in peace to everybody involved or I believe in violence. I I I I don't believe in nonviolence inequality when it comes to women. Okay. No, no. We getting somewhere now. Alright. I believe In violence. I believe in violence. Right. I, I don't believe in peace is the ultimate answer to everything.


I don't believe in non-violence is the, is an overarching philosophy. Malcolm X Well let me, let me land with what I was trying to say first. Sorry. Yeah, you I was trying to say, well I'm gonna say rest in peace to the young man. 'cause I never wanna see a life lost no matter what happens. Especially a child, teenager as a dad. Like, yeah. So I wanna start with rest in peace to the young man. But why you may see some black people feeling better about this than we normally do when these stories break is because they typically have a really sorry ending fatal, fatal ending for the black person involved. True. That's A fact. Like two things could be true Here.


And I Think a lot of people were really just happy. Go ahead And No. And then after the black person is fatally injured, the white person typically gets a slap on the wrist or some don't really, really legitimate suffer for, for, for their actions. We ain't gotta go that, that, that far. It was the two black, the two black brothers that, that was killed in the sundown town. What was that in Georgia? That the cops was saying that every, the whole town was saying they was on their way to the airport and the cops said they detoured and they had the gun on 'em and there were all types of lies on these two kids. Two young two, Two brothers. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And don't, and don't stop. So I think it's a two part court. Like, yo, if you did some bullshit and they gave you life, it would give people a little bit of reassurance when they get 18 months and then get 12 of that suspended move.


You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like that shit be trash. That's the trash part. Like when the cops do some bullshit, they don't ever get to suffer any consequence. Right. You know what I'm saying? It's rare. It is rare. Even if they get, you know what the maximum is for cops. Five years. I think George Floyd's killer got a little bit went down, he got 10. Right. I was gonna say he got a little bit more to Derek Chauvin. Derek ch But to your point, that took a whole nationwide. No, he got Ruth. But because he got the federal and the state charges, what I'm saying. But it took a whole n Nation to watch the shit and ha it happened during a pandemic. True. To get that kind of verdict. It is right. It is. It just takes so much to get justice. And that's why I don't, don't lose no sleep over there. Auman got 21. 21. Yeah. Children. Yo, I don I don feel like that. And we, so real quick, you brought us up.


We don't know the update on the brothers that got killed. We don't know the update or anything. Nobody. Is there any of It? There was an update. Okay. There was an update. I think there may be investigating now or viewing it as a homicide. Nobody believed the story of these two, these two young black boys unli themselves on the way to the airport. They had a gun. It was like, it's crazy. So, so I think they are investigating it as homicide. We can look that up to fact check it. 'cause It is important. And I'm going off my memory, but I watch a lot of news. So my memory's kind of good with that also. Kyron la rest in peace. Yeah. Let's get, let's get all the, all of the sad news out of the way. Kyron Laley bless you is the Yeah. Star wide receiver. Yeah. Who got in that car accident in December where someone lost their life and, and he fled the scene and they sang that.


Now he, they're they're reporting that there was an argument allegedly 'cause it's too early. But they're reporting that there was an argument, there was a high speed chase and that he unli himself at the end of it. I don't know that to be factual, but that is what's being reported. Just A report. Yeah. It's still rest in Peace. Yeah. Rest in For sure. Sure. For sure. Even Without all the facts like that. That's the easy rest in peace for me. That one's crazy. Yeah. I just wanna be careful of, of reporting You right. That people unli when And that might not, we don't know. Don't know yet. Yeah, you said it right. This is what they're Reporting. Yeah. They put that on the two young black boys that was headed the airport. So Let's just wait and see.


But rest in peace to Kyra Lacey. Extremely sad story from what I'm hearing. An amazing person and highly regarded receiver. First, first round was a potential first round pick. Right. Just sad. Just sad. All around the board. Just, oh, go ahead. So we talking about sad stuff. Can we move to something a little bit more upbeat? Sure. There, there's been this thing going around the internet and, and I've heard some reports that it may not be true, but I think it's still worth talking about either way. Right. There's this v there was a person who made a cake and for her birthday party, the cake said Happy birthday. And then on the cake it said, best pussy ever. It said her dude made that cake for her. Her dude made it for, yeah.


Right. Her dude made it for her. Right. So she's grown. She's like 27, something like that. Are they together? Yeah. Yeah. But that some boyfriend best haha moment. That ain't the issue. That's not the, that ain't the issue. Right? So the girl gets a text message from her dad who was at the party and she said, she sends it message to your dad saying, I wanted to wait till after everyone left to ask why did you get mad and leave? It was a gathering for my birthday and it hurt my feelings to see you just up and leave. He writes back, Chyna spelled C-H-Y-N-A-M, which to me answers all these questions. That shit was highly disrespectful.


I'm sorry. No. If you name your daughter China with a y you got, you have to have certain expectations. There's a ceiling. No, it's there's a ceiling. Stop it. No, you can't do that man. Have you ever, you know what? No. Come on. Talk to China. China, yes. China. China. Why you say it like China? China. I said it with the wild nigga. Chyna was, that shit was highly disrespectful. The cake. I mean, your mother and I were there and that's the cake your friend decided to pick up. That was very distasteful. You're still my little girl at the end of the day. She says it wasn't that deep. I just feel like you're being dramatic as always. It it's obvious you don't like him. Was the cake in the shape of her vagina? No. It of round cake. It just was written on there.


It just said a lot of flip questions too. On low. You do what you mean legit. It could have been a cake in the shape of a fucking vagina. What It could have been. Stop what you today a mood as You Right. Watch this. He says it's not about not liking someone Chyna. It's about decent damn respect. You think your father wants to eat a birthday cake that showcases how good his daughter's private part is? No. Hell no. He puts it in caps. She writes back, I still don't understand why you're mad. It was just a joke. But okay, I'm 27. Not a child. He said it's about respect China. Look, we'll talk more about it tomorrow.


She said there's nothing left to talk about. Honestly. Now again, some of the internet people are saying that this is, this is manufacturing. I'm the phone. I'm phone. But either way, I I'm curious. I I No, no way pops is overactive man. Hell no. Is it? No. Even if the internet is, even if this is manufacturing, it's still a conversation. Right? It's still a conversation. Right? It's a conversation. Don't Now I'm with the father on this one. She's 27 years old. I wanna know what the girl dads are on this. I don't give, she messed up being a fuck. I'm shutting up. I don't give a fuck. You can't, yo listen, you don't do no shit like that now That not when I'm there. Don't highlight my daughter's private party or how good It is. Who the fuck you think you are Even 10 years from now? I don't give a fuck. Have some respect. I wouldn't do that to, to your parents. Yeah, your dog. You could be 40 and your mother and father at the party and the nigga gives you a cake that says the best dick sucker ever or the best head ever.


Come on. That's a little different. That's a little That's s the thing best pu the best dick sucker ever is a little different. Sucker is It is not. Yes It is. It is the exact same thing. Dick sucker. No It is not thing. Dick sucker is sucker the thing. Still more flagrant fe would've been better. Yeah. Still work. So let's keep it to this. Let's keep It is not, I'm opposed Can y'all have the fight please? I'm, I'm opposed to that. I just believe in decency again for somebody's, if you had that cake at home when she came home, that's something different. Different. But if you had different, if had a cake in a public spot and my family is here, my older aunts and shit like that. Yeah. Like, I think that shit is disrespectful. You come from a family of older people. Man.


Don't do that. We don't stand with that. You wouldn't like nobody doing no shit like that. Oh yeah. I I I think it's disrespectful. Oh, we, Oh yeah. Oh, I I think it's disrespectful. Don't do that to me. I I think that, I think Okay. Okay. Okay. I think it's disrespectful, but at the same token, I do think the dad is like going a little too far. Like what? Leaving up and leave the party shit. Oh, I wanna see you in 22 years. Listen, I, I I might change then. I'm talking about right now. I'm just looking at that situation. Yeah. What would you do? You stay, I don't know. I could see not eating, eating a cake. I wanna eat a slice. I'm definitely not eating. I about say what You eat the cake. I'm not eating no cake. No, no. Thank you. I don't want no cake. I'm gonna have a little attitude and a cut. Like, man, come on. And the wife was there too. Come on man. So it's not just the dad, the mother and the father were there. Come on. But all do you eat the cake Ish?


I would've left like the father. Oh, you left. You stayed. But don't eat the cake. The age to me, like again, if she was 18, even though that's still grown by today, I, I have more of a problem. She damn near 30 B. So I'm not tripping as bad. So your man should damn near 30, you don't feel disrespected. So your man should be feel disrespect. I'm not gonna feel disrespected. Her man should not close to 30 can her man should have some decency and some respect. That's my personal, I don't with you in that. I'm not disrespected by that. He said girl, Dad. So now I wanna know what the non girl dads. I just think those of you who can make boys, what do you say? Mm. Oh, that's me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Lemme get through.


I don't think there's any wrong answer in this. True. I think that if she's 27 then it's time to start separating the birthday celebration that mom and dad can come to. Sure. That's true. Yes. Versus the ones that's for me and my friends to while out and True. We react if she knew that dad was coming and clearly by what she's saying to him in the text, he's been a tight ass. Right. This is not a surprise he been on. I'm getting that from what she said to him. Yeah, I was gonna say. She said you're overreacting like you always do. Right. And you know, and it sound like the, the boyfriend might be a comedian All the Way. It gotta be somebody's job to, to, to mediate this thing. To break the Ice Or order, order It just, you know what it sound like, it sounds like a generational disconnect because the shit that she's saying, yo, you, you ODing as you always do probably he might be looking at that shit like, no, I'm not ODing.


It's just certain shit that we did in my day that y'all do today. That's disrespectful. Or it could be considered disrespectful by somebody in that age group. I I agree with the dad, but not for the same reasons as the girl dads. Like if I'm a dad and I'm in that spot, I don't think that somebody should be put I'm put even if true about my daughter on a cake for a party to see Shit. I'm saying that. And that's what, that's what it says. That's the generational shit. Younger do. They'll do that. That's a decency thing. And that's funny to them. Oh yeah girl. That's funny. Let me ask you, is, is this gendered at all? And I'm not saying It is. I'm genuinely curious. Like for example, if your son's girlfriend writes Best dick ever is a bad idea.


It's a bad idea. It's a bad idea. I wouldn't like that either. It's a bad idea. But see women know that. So women, a woman wouldn't do that. So women would never put best dick ever on the best Dick Ever's birthday cake. China will. So to Be clear, this is China. This is a birthday party and not like a, a engagement party Or something. Right. It is a birthday party. Yeah, it's a birthday party Might. So I think that might adjust this As well. China not doing that home girl, Black girls ain't doing that. They're not doing that. That was just you that ran into car house ready to tell her But stop black Girls. Stop, stop it. It's either way. It's fucked up. You, You, you agree it's fucked up. Yes my nigga. Would you be embarrassed by that? Like if you do you 45? Yes. You 45 years old. I'm not. Or 44.


Pardon me. Respect me. I'm saying I didn. I didn't know nigga. It is a long five months. Fuck your age. Yo look. Right. If, if how would your mom feel if one of your female friends did? No, what I'm saying, if one of your female friends did, I Didn't want to use me. 'cause me and my mom are kind of close. Yeah man. And know. I mean you just told, you know, listen to what I was about to say and your mother is one of the more open-minded younger Perspective. Mom wouldn't but she would judge a girl. Exactly. Right. My mom wouldn't kid if you daddy. Exactly. But she would judge a girl. Yeah. And she'll tell you later Joey, I can hear her now. Joey. Dead ass. Yeah. What are we talking about? And again, funny, your mother and your father are more open-minded to, They're more current. Progressive. Yeah, progressive.

Lots of people wanna jump out. You just assume it's No, but in all seriousness, like that, a, is that some normal shit?

So shout to Paige. What's pa What's pa What's Paige's ceiling to y'all? Is is Paige like going to be, is it gonna be some bird magic shit? She's One them. Yeah. Yeah. She, she does for sure. I think so too. I think, I don't think she's Caitlyn, but I think she's right under. Yeah, She's, she might be, she's be respectful. She's Not right under, Like, I'm being respectful about saying right under she not I Right under, I think Caitlyn's generational. So there you go. For sure. But Paige is, Paige is nice. Page is good. Paige is a beast. Paige is good.


Caly. What you think Juju will it will be A Caitlyn Joe? Yes. Juju the one. Yes. But not Paige. Not Paige. I think I take Caitlyn with Juju too. Juju. See, this is what I think. I think White power. I think that Juju could get still even where she is today. Exponentially better. Even with the need issue. You don't Yes. You don't think it's going to compromise. Athleticism. That'd be interesting to see. I think Juju's amazing. I think Juju may end up being the second best player in the WNBA behind, behind Caitlyn. I, I, that's what I'm saying. You said Kaitlyn, miss Caitlyn. Yeah. Like Ca Caitlyn's different. I go full head with a couple, like Caitlin's different, bro. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I ain't seen nothing like Kaitlyn. She different.


Caitlyn could probably average like six with the men. I ain't gonna go that far. But she got, she got range and she got handled. So the show, Oh, that was on. That was on. I just wanted to shout out Rory and Paige. Shout out. There's nothing else there that I need to get out. Yeah, I Think that's Yo did. Is it true? I don't know if it's true. Did Angel Reese get traded? I haven't seen, I Haven't, I haven't see nothing about that. Okay. It's, it just might be wrong. Ain't nobody I, I wouldn't trade Angel. I I would not trade Angel Reese if I, if I was Chicago. Well, who did you play for? Chicago, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I I would not, I would not trade Angel.


I mean, I, I don't think she's as good as these upper level players we're talking about, but she just brings so much to a team and she's a different kind of player. She's got a motor like crazy, you know, and brings money and attention. I mean, to a league that needs it. I wouldn't get Angel's a angel's a beast too. For sure. I, before we leave, I do want to take the time out to officially say that Rum is the best battle rapper in the universe currently. From that I'm excluding the Luxes and the MOOCs and the people that have already kind of, it might really just be Lux and Mo that I'm excluding from that. So, so you Haven't beaten Daylight Surf and Daylight Al excused.


I'm not mad, I'm not mad at nobody catching a l to Rum Nitty right now. Not me. I be, that's what I'm trying to say. Yeah. Yeah. I've been outside for a lot of the meteoric rises on Saturday was the Apollo event. Yes. I tipped my hat to the people that threw that event. Chiller Jones. All the good people over there was in Houston, the real sick and Mac. What I liked was, they had a, they, they featured a lot of battlers from other leagues that you may not be all the way familiar with, like the smack niggas and, and, and made 'em face off against the smack nigga. So, like I said, the real sick battled Mack. That was a real good battle. I watched it a crazy real good battle. I watched it fucking Jada Knight Wing.


And I, I will and Ill will. I wasn't all the way familiar with Jada Knight Wing. That's my first time seeing him. He's great, great performance. It was good to see Daylight. Daylight sounded like daylight for three rounds. If you have, if you have enough time to sit and listen to what he was trying to do with the aliens and the Bible and yada yada yada. YI Can't do it. I'm not mad at you. I cannot do it. See, that was after the Lux Nigga. But, you know, gray Goose, that was fire. I like luck. I mean, I like daylight. I think Daylight did great. I mean, I see what I'm, I'm surprised that he took, took that battle. I'm surprised that Daylight took that battle before battling Lux. Mm.


No, you shouldn't be surprised I am though. Because you need a warmup before you go against Lux. Lux is a highly anticipated battle. Lux Did the same thing. I don't think rum is a warmup. I think that's a blockbuster battle. Of course. That, that has potential to not go your way all the way. Right. So if all the hype in the world is here for 20 years for us to see you and Lux give us you and Lux, now they've taken some sting off what that battle means. Because Rum Nitty has in some people's eyes, beating them both. One, two, if your name is daylight and daylight, you my man. If your name is Daylight and you battling one of them Punchline King type of niggas, what he did with the name Daylight for three rounds.


Some of that shit was some of the Ill shit I've heard. Man, I ain't gonna lie. We do. So, so is it unanimous That rum Nitty one? Yes. Okay. We On, I don I don't wanna say unanimous, like I speak for the streets. Some people could have daylight. The only debate that I see is, was it a three oh for rum or did you get daylight the third? Was it, was it you Saying daylight? You saying the flip on the daylight name, was it better than what Ab Soul did when they battled? Yes. Oh, because it was, that was crazy. Nonstop. And some of them shits was unpredictable. Like at one point he was like, and I'm, I don't I fuck fucking all these bars. Right, right, right. At one point he was like, but I ain't gonna kill him no more gun bars.


I'm too mature. I said, I'm too mature. I said, I'm too mature. And then he got into some shit about, but if I seen him when I was younger, I'd have stuck the knife in the back of the day when I was young. But I'm not a kid anymore. He just thought It was like, like, oh shit, you pulling day. It was a lot of day flips in there that some of them was unconventional. Okay. It is a lot more. I'll probably go pull the battle up and then on Patreon, explain more of them. Some of them day flips. I'll check it. What did that nigga say about daylight savings? Oh, he said ain't no daylight savings.


Like I'm Arizona. And then he said, and I know such and such had a daylight savings bar, but times have changed. They, he was just, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was bad. It was bad child. Really, really bad child. Rum Nitty, I think, I think Rum Nitty has proven himself. Himself. You saw it? I think. Yes. I, I watched, I purchased it. I watched it. I think Rum has proven, proven himself. Yeah. NI's him, you know, likes one of the greats. You know, we give, I gave him a hard time for a lot of years, You know what I mean? But undeniable. And then I think Punch was there. He said something, he flipped Scissor paper Rock into, into punch, pay Scissor, something he bugged out up there.


Yeah. Try to. Then he said, I'll come to the Vent Act even say what up to everybody Even extend a hand to punch. Like do Slim, do He, You know, I'm, I'm ruining this. Of Course, of course. Because his, the setup and delivery is what Make, but the boy, oh boy, I don't really know if it, I'm glad to surf caught him when he wasn't doing this. I'm glad Surf has battled him already and ain't gotta come home and be like, this is scary. This is spooky shit. Surf would still be scary, Huh? Surf would Still be scary. But I get what you're saying though. It's, it's, It is more of a fight. It Would be scary. It's more of a fight. But I, I've been outside for everybody's meteoric rise, ta, rock clips, verb, anybody you name, this one is different.


Even Geechee, this one is different. Yeah, man. Yeah. You see they announced Hitman Hollow Mo and Hitman. Yeah. I'm never batting against mooc ever. My days of batting against MOOC are over and have been over Since Lux since. So Slaughter. Yeah, since Lux. Yeah. That, That was, I'm not bent Against Mo. I've never seen nothing like that in my life. Me neither. Me neither. I, I, I I got Hitman in this. You got what? I got hitman in this, in the battle. Me too. Yep. I got hit. Man. This, based on what I think Hitman got a point to prove. I think. I think he, I I just think he got a point to prove. He ain't have a point to prove last year or two years ago.


Yes. And that's the thing. Now, now y'all think I'm Trump a little bit like, 'cause he went in with a little bit more arrogance in his last two battles. And now y'all think I'm Trump or you know, the, the, the other shit has got into my head. I'm, I'm, I'm too successful over here. I ain't really got it. I you see, you see him versus All of that shit that I'm with. All of that shit existed with him versus Geechee and him versus, and him versus, oh fuck, I gotta brain for you. Easy, Easy. Yeah. So now just battle, hustle the entire, everybody is saying, yeah, this is, this is a cakewalk for Mo now. So I think he has a point to prove more than, more so than before. And Mooch might Be overconfident From the last battle. Nah, I I'm never playing that card again. Yo dog. Mo, there's no such thing as overconfident.


If MOOC is focused, there's a problem. Let's be clear that nigga's prepared bro. He is. If he's focused, he's The most prepared. Yes. I think it's gonna be an ill battle. But I do think, I think hit man. Just we gonna see a different hit two final If you lose. I'm not saying he lost. I'm not, some people say he lost to Geechee and Zy. I don't think you'd lose to those two and then turn around and beat Mooch. True. I agree. I think you can. MOOC is not that type of Yeah bro. We've seen nothing in our lives to say that is what I'm saying. True. True. We be wrong. We just ain't seeing nothing to support. I I mount for a great battle rush. We ain't lost around since Iron Solom is before Iron Solomon. Oh, that's a lie bro. Mo Mo is on Mount Rushmore.


I know you go. Yeah, you Have to be. Oh, absolutely. Mo, you can't have a Mount Rushmore without Mo. Anybody Rushmore. I don't think anybody could have, you can't even have a Mount Rushmore battle rap without Mook and Luxe. I'm gonna say Lux is on there too. Who else is on it? Who else On the, The Rush. Yeah, you could Now, now it's the preference game after that. Mm. Mo and everybody else. Now it's the preference game after that. Mo and Lux. If, if, if Mo and Luxe are not on your, your Mount Rushmore battle rap. I don't even wanna see your Mount Rushmore battle rap. That's fair. I mean it could mean something to you. Cool. I just don't wanna see it. Mm. Before we go, did y'all hear Ja Moran's explanation for the Grenade celebration? No, I did not. I thought I did, but Okay. Awesome. Awesome. I'm so glad that Is there more delivered to you?


He says it's not what people think. It's not a grenade. It's not what people think. The Grenade celebration is him taking the words from his mouth, throwing it out there and then blocking out the noise. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I'm with him. Yeah. Come on. I'm with him. That's plausible. Come on. I'm with him. What was the acronym for Thug? Truly Humble Under God. Truly Humble Under God. Na broke it down like that. Yo. That's right. There It is. I'm rolling. I'm Rolling. Okay. Yeah.
