One more secret plot that they would tell about White. They had the 10 hats on. Oh My God. But what were they saying? That this was a strategy that you were faking, that you were never coming back Bad. I saw some of that.

It Started off with concern. A lot of concern. Not a Lot. Not a lot. Not a lot. There's a little bit of hate. Nah, it wasn't, wasn't as much concern as I would've liked. Right. For, for putting out the yo man really going through some shit. Y'all hold me down out there. It was like an hour of damn hopey good. Yeah. After that, it went right back to, I think, I think it was because you were posting in story that, you know, shit just looked real, you know? Normal. Looked regular, regular. Outside of the pot. How should it look when people are going through something?


Number one, Cricket. Cricket, chirp, chirp. Maybe nothing. It wasn't a lot. They didn't get much. I was in the mall and they opened up a Yeti store and I was excited about it. That was too far. So I, So I went in there too Far. Nigga Caught the camouflage. Yeti Yeti. People were like, Oh Shit. The rest of y'all was like, oh, he good. He is buying coffee cups. Like, what is the correlation there? I was fucked up in Yeti. That was like a retail therapy type of thing. Oh. I overstand, I, I understand. People Are rational. Like, if you could do Yeti, you could do a four hour podcast and A patriarch. Yeah. Yeah. Same thing. And then Parks comes on air and he says, Yeah man, it was just with Joe last night filming.


That did not help. I was Just with Joe last night shooting some shit. Man. This Scott was letting them know that you're all right. No, no. And no, no. People were worried, man. They want to send you flowers. They want, they wanna know where you at. That's home. Well, not even, They, they, they think you were, they think you were avoiding the topics. Oh, That was, I saw some of that. I saw some of that ducking. All the smoke, The whole, some of that Whole smoke. Here's my problem with you though. My problem with you is that while you were going through something and we were concerned, you were really going through something. 'cause you didn't even answer your niggas.

Brought to you by Fuel, by powered by Prize Prize mix. PrizePicks Watching you. I'm watching While I a lot of lip on that one little part in the front of my, Hey, don't, don't step on my drugs. Don't step on my drugs. Brought to you by a few. By Power, by PrizePicks.


I'm your humble, gracious, grateful, highly favor host. Joe Button here with a few of my nearest and dearest big Parks is in the building. Our seating is different now. Big Parks is here. Mel is here. Flip is here. Marcus is here. PO is here. Corey is here. Ericsson is here. Keebler and Ian are here. Tanner and Avon are here. Remotely ish and Ice are here with us in spirit. And last, but certainly not least, each and every one of you guys out there, here with us. What's popping? What's popping? What's popping? Oh Shit. I was getting used to Tuesdays off. I ain't gonna hold you. I bet you was. I was. Must be nice. I was. What'd You say? I said must be nice. Yeah, You got Fridays Off.


Don't Worry about that part. What's up man? How y'all doing? How y'all doing? Good. I'm Great. Great. Took me a while to get the setback. So I had a long night, but We Are here. This is, this is great. Yeah. Hey Man, this is fucking awesome. Nostalgia. Yeah. Yeah, man. Magic was made. It was Plenty of great times. We just happy to see that you're back, bro. That's it, man. Well, where did y'all think I was going? Like what are y'all saying? You wasn't communicating, But what, what did Y think? Did Y was gonna have to pick up and just pod for life without what? Y what are y'all talking about here? No, that's not dramatic. I mean, We are dramatic. You right. First of all, we, we, we had pods giving set up and you send a text saying we can't do pods giving anymore.


There's no pods giving There. No. Push back. Push Back. So, but what you said is gotta cancel. And then you said you had a, an emergency, right? Yes. So I didn't know. I mean, the biggest thought I had obviously was, you know, like Family. No, I just got this job. I could lose the check. Oh, I dunno. I dunno what he's going through, but How it affect me, right Through Valid. It's a fair point. Beer point. But my second thought was, I don't know if he's okay. And, and, and, because like, like flip was saying, like you weren't super like, communicative. I didn't know how bad it was.


Whether it, you know, because some people are dramatic, particularly famous people. And so didn didn't, it could be something small, it could be something big. I didn't know. So I was just worried. We were just worried about you. I didn't worry, worry about potting second, but I was really worried about this part. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Aw, I was worried about you. We really worried about you. I mean, it's not like you said such a high and also like, not hearing from you and then having to come in mic the Mic, the mic Not hearing from you and having to come in and do the job. I mean, I mean, shout out to Corey and shout out to Ericson and the team being there. But it's still not, not hearing from you, not knowing what's going on and trying to get it all together. It is, it was, it was an interesting task for me. That's all Y'all, y'all thought if something was really down, if I was really down bad, did Corey just still be around Chilling, watching, watching you nigga?


You don't think he would've something better to do with like that's was that's made it like an emergency Just made him worse. He military man. No, exactly. He's he was proxy. Yeah. Yeah. He probably wouldn't have said shit been mouth because you, he could have, you could've been in the bathtub covering ice with a kidney out. Like he wouldn't tell us. You know what I'm saying? He would just keep doing the job to keep things looking steady. And he held it down, you know, like Cory presence is, is, is needed. And it was very important while you weren't there. So he held it down. I think a bunch of things just happened at once. Like, there's no one thing to highlight. Like a bunch of different things just started happening in the same week. And I needed to go, I needed to go and deal with that before my blood pressure went too crazy.


And listen, listen, maybe on another date, maybe today, I gotta see how I feel. But I'm, I'm dying to tell y'all a little bit of what Happened. I'm dying. I am absolutely dying detective. It is the funniest shit in the world. It really is. It's just not, It is not funny, but it's hilarious. It's A very Joe. It's Only Joe to do this. When you gonna share this? Yeah. This nigga is crazy. I've been racking my brain. Yeah, you gotta share. Gotta share it, man. Y'all can't pressure me. No, no, no. Don't worry. I mean, at some point I am. Okay. Please do.

I know you'll put the sauce on it to make it funnier, but No, I don't need to. It's Really, It is funny. Is there any cure for sleepwalk? Joe? Did you look into that? I don't know.


All the clinical neurologists and doctors that I've spoken to say it all come from stress. And I turn on my fucking tv. B, c y'all just stress free. Just, just, It is like, wow. Niggas bog This shit.

Not my first day back. Listen, I saw some of y'all out there saying, man, I, I hope when Joe gets back he will address some of the topics that he missed that are really important. I would love to know his thoughts. No, no. Yeah. You missed some shit. I'm not gonna do that. We to dove into some shit. I can't. I tell, I can't tell you. I could not be happier to have missed every topic that I missed from Daniel Penny to the United Healthcare dude.


To ho to Remy and Pap. I was home batting a thousand on not having to talk about none of This shit by God saved You. But look, the, the whole one I think is safe now. It is. Yeah. It's clear. You know, I've been, I've been watching, covering it, you know, trying to find an angle on this because, you know, I always want to stand with victims of, of violence. Always wanna stand with accusers. 'cause most accusers are telling the truth. From what I can see, this is not one of those times, you know, when I first heard it and I heard the, the attorney Andrew Busby being an attorney, I was already like, this looks shady. 'cause I know his reputation as An ambulance chaser. As an ambulance chaser. Yeah. And, and just the way the story played out didn't make sense to me.


But like in the last 48 hours, It is been even more evidence. Like when she did that NBC interview, I was like, okay, this ain't nail in the coffin. Oh my God. It was terrible. She said, my dad picked me up Yep. And brought me back home. It's a five hour drive. Yep. And I was like, if my kid asked me to pick her up and drive five hours, and I'd remember that shit 20 years from now. And then when NNBC Spoke to the dad, the dad said he, he doesn't remember that happening. He don't believe that. It feels like he would remember it. Right. He would remember, you would remember a trip from Rochester to Right. Wherever New York. Which is a nice way of saying, my daughter's a fucking liar. Yeah. It's a no, because I'd ride for my kid in general, of course. You know what I'm saying? But he was like, nah, I can't do that.


And then on top of that, they said, she said she watched the, the VMAs from the jumbo tron. They were like, we didn't have a jumbo tron that year. Yeah. But the thing that fucked my head up was when she said that she, she, she spent time at the VMAs with that artist Green Charlotte or something. Yeah. One Of the artists. Yeah. The artists from from from that group. Yeah. Blink 180 to one of one Charlotte. Yeah. Yep. Good. Charlotte. Charlotte is Nice. And I was like, what? Two things made me say she's not black. Right. One was that of all the people at the VMAs, that's who she remembered. Right. I mean, come on at 13 facts. Then the second thing she said, I called my dad and he came to pick me up. Right. I was like, between those two things, there are Also what threw me off was when she said my bathroom.


When she said, yeah, I walked to the gas station and picked me up from the gas station. I'm like, it ain't but one or two gas stations. It is all of Manhattan. Yeah. In Manhattan, period. Right. So none of This shit makes it, we went to a mansion. They, they fucking traced the mansion. They said there's no mansion within 20 minutes. They, they said HOV was there ho they had pictures of Hove somewhere else at the time where the thing was supposed to have happened. It was just like thing after. I was like, if you come after somebody with that much money, they're going to have investigators and trackers. They're gonna be able to prove This shit if it didn't happen. Oh man, I want to shout out to my Lotus gang, those Lotus days Hold up now. Yeah, man. Hey, hey Lotus. Those was the Lotus days. Are you shitting me? There's evidence if dudes went to Lotus after the bmas and at that time That is where you would go.


And Lotus was not letting anybody 13 in there. And yet Puff didn't own a mansion back then. They did research there. They, they, whoever did that interview, they did. They did the research. Yeah. But, but my favorite part at all of this is when Puffy's lawyer came at the end and was like, yes, this is ludicrous. These are all false accusations and hos team's like, wait, don't let us everybody slow. Right. Everybody slow down. I, Mr. Carter knows Mr. Combs professionally only. Yes. They've spent time together as professionals at award show. They basically like, I don't know him like, like I've, I, I've done business with him. That's not my man. His cases are his case. This ain't got shit to do with with Me. We have no meaningful con connection. Yeah, No meaningful connection.


Yeah. I was like, wow. And, and somehow the internet was up in arms about that. I Understood. I saw people saying that we needed to rush in here and address that part of it. And I'm like, No, I would do the same thing. I don't believe they were friends. Yeah. I mean, like, no, I feel Like, no, I'm, I'm on record saying I don't believe that any of these industry niggas be friends. It is all for optics. It's all for business purposes. It's all for dang Chilling. Dang Chilling on fucking Thanksgiving. Right. And if and if we cosplaying as friends and you get jammed up with the law, then I'm denouncing I'm denouncing the friendship. Right. What is it understand here, right.


You was saying. No, that's exactly what I was saying is like, I think that people take the optics of seeing Diddy at the Rock Nation brunches, that's usually like kind of the, you know, what people use as a gauge to judge like how close people are in the industry. And Jay-Z is like, yeah, no, this is my shit. I show up, I shake hands, I kiss babies and that's it. I'm out. There is a level of CL Joe or Flip, I would hang with y'all. I would go to the club with y'all. I would go to the Roc Nation brunch with all, but do you know how fucking close we'd have to be to have sex with a 13-year-old white woman? White girl? I mean like that. I mean obviously we wouldn't do that 'cause it's illegal in its own. But I'm just saying like to com to deplorable and the level of crime that you're committing, you got to know that motherfucker going like go to the, go to the grave with that shit.


True. They're, they're, they're not Never thought that they would be our word buddies or pedophilia, Whatever. That's what I'm Saying. That ain't, I never thought that. Not once. That's The ho's really, really, really intelligent. Like, and I don't just mean like educated, like the way that his brain works. A lot of them people up there, the way they brain works, they got a different type of tick. I just don't see ho making that mistake ever. His he's not that one. Yeah. He's like long term strategic and he's extraordinarily private and has been forever. Yeah. You know, and he's Patient. Yeah. Yeah. Now I'm not close enough with anybody to know that, you know, who knows if, if there's a play after this with these people.


I don't know if this is busby's only play here. It just seemed like a bad, seemed like a bad plan. I don't think It is. I think It didn't seem, well well done. Even his line about, hey, another law firm vetted this young girl before she got to me. Alright, so you did know vetting, so you just acting off the information you received as an attorney. If you're, if you're a hustler though, what's your, you're banking on two things. One, that 99 90% of people just don't want the bad press, so they'll just pay you to go away. Right. Which is mostly the case. Yeah. I would assume. But there's a second piece that most people don't assume is that even if you didn't do the thing that you're accused of, there's a chance that the only way you can disprove It is to say what you were doing.


And that thing also might make you culpable. So for example, if I wasn't where I was at the strip club, now you gotta explain to somebody why you was at that strip club. If you told your wife you was somewhere else, or Oh no, I was, I was, I was fucking so-and-so that night. And she can verify, okay, well now you, You know what I mean? So a lot of celebrities have so much dirt and do so much wild shit that they will run from, they, they'll settle. Not 'cause they did that thing, but because if, if a light comes on everything, they gonna get exposed to something else. So they just, I, I've talked to Celebr all the time, be like, I didn't do that shit man, but I was at this other thing. You Got it. I can see that. Yeah. That's What they're scared of. Yeah. Ho seems to be making quick work of this guy. I ain't never seen nothing like it. I ain't never seen nobody get they ass kicked like this got The Roger Goodell stamp the very next, Hey no business is fine.


We're not, we're not gonna lose that relationship. That's impressive. Truly Go. Yeah. I just, last thing I wanna say with this is just I don't, I hate though that now all the people who don't believe any women who don't believe any survivors who don't believe any victims are now gonna be like, see just like that shit will hold. That's gonna be like, that's gonna be the justification. Yeah. Like that's gonna be they one. I hate that shit. I hate that they're even correlated. Right. Like in anything there's gonna be liars. There is like that don't, that's a separate issue from the, the people out there that not just saying women. 'cause it's not just women that are going through those types of, you know, I don't wanna use the words.


Yeah. But yeah, it's not just girls, it's guys, it's little boys. It's, it's fucked up out there. Yeah. Yeah. And this is dark now. It is. Yeah. It's dark. Can can I ask your opinion on something then? Sure. And I'm asking you, I mean I, I care about what all y'all think, but it's a Joe thing. So my wife got the flu last week. Hopefully she feels better. I don't know. I haven't been home. Oh Shit, that's So Maybe that's Something That he, hence the Joe part. Got it. Yeah. She said she had a hundred, she had 105 degree fever and yeah, it was like 104.9 to be exact. That's a lot. It was real hot. Yeah. I really don't want the flu.


So she, I said, So I said, I said, I said go to urgent care. And when she went to urgent care, I quickly packed all my things. I had to do my Al Jazeera show in DC anyway, that next morning now I did take the baby. Okay. Okay. And I thought back, I was talking to you on the phone. Did it sounded, it looked like a kidnapping. I'm sure my neighbor thought I was, I was just throwing shit, grabbing random towels and fucking wipes and shit. And I threw him in that car and I drove to DC and I haven't been home. I'll be, I'm gonna come home after this show. It's my birthday. So you can't be but so mad. Some would argue including my, your wife?


No, no, no. Not me. I'm fine. Okay. Your wife, my yes. Might say what the fuck. Like you could have stayed here and took care of me. You could have been downstairs. We got enough space, you know. But I really don't want the flu As a married man. Yes. My wife is sick. Or if I'm sick, vice versa. It goes both ways. One of us goes somewhere else. The guest bedroom, the basement, the air mattress. When I had Covid house is down here sleeping on the floor. Like, But not Washington. That's, That is, yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. You just got, you just got up and left, man. Because If you get sick you can't work. That's where, that's where it's Tricky. Yeah. Right. And I'm assuming somebody has to go to work. Somebody has to. Plus I really don't want the flu.


I would you, I don't want that Shit. But they got new versions of that shit now. Yo. What She got the new one? Yeah. The flu ain't just the flu no more. Her shit got wings and some shit. I don't know what the fuck It is, but It is terrible shit. Yeah. I don't want no parts of it. And That's kind of fire to be away from the house while your wife or your girl is sick nigga like, and have a good reason. Yeah, But you had take the baby. I will take the baby. See, because You don't want the baby to get sick either. Yeah, True. More stress. I put him on, I put him on YouTube. That's how I see it. I put YouTube on. I've been free for the last five days. See I have went to constant Airstream with the baby. Fuck she talking about? I've been on a little tour.


Your dads get that baby in that little front book Bag We be in, we'd be in the streets. Yeah. I don't think he did nothing wrong. Yeah, not at all. I don't think he did nothing Wrong. If Joe said I didn't do nothing wrong, I did nothing Wrongest. I, she mad. I don't know. He'll find out, out that hold. Wait, you gave it on, you've been been there for five days, but you've spoken to her. You can't get a, to text her, you can't get a tone through text. Right? He Text her. Yeah. Here. Unless she's really Mad. Then you can get the tone through the Text. That's true. It's some short answers. Yeah. But she's been in and outta consciousness. She's been really tired. So I don't know. But it's my birthday so I feel like that's the safe time to come home. So do you know if she's feeling better now or she's feeling Oh, she's definitely better. Good. Oh, all right. So she's good enough for pod wives now. Oh Shit. She, she good enough for a pod wives now.


She Feeling good now. She got material fucked up. Oh fuck no. She wasn't coming before because them 30 bands. You was talking about giving out. Whoa. Giving out. You said you was giving, you said you giving Out Didn didn't say shit about giving out Shit to earn it. Right? I mean it wasn't like a regular, it wasn't like a monthly stipend. It wasn't like per diem. That was a one time shot. That's a big, that's a nice shot. It's a one time shot. Sometimes you hit a shot from half court. Enough. Enough you give out. He ruined it for us. Give your girl bread stop all the time. You can do Paw Wines the Shit, man. Y'all, y'all could do it. Y'all Could do it. We can't. We can't do paws. You ruin that shit for you. You give out a lot of bread. You like, you just make everything Seems, I already told mine, I know I'm gonna save money.


I know I'm gonna save money. Not that I'm here talk about it, but by giving her Amex, if I give her a card from my shit, I'll save mad money. How would You put limit on that? How? Well, because cards have limits. No, but you're, But Amex has a high Limit Amex. So first of all, Amex gonna have whatever limit you call them and tell them to set. Oh, so you on the card send No, but you, but you're transitioning into black card territory. That's what I Well if you hit, if you hit homeboy, then Yeah. Yeah. I, I've already taken care of it. Its, it's in motion. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. And the problem with the black card is one you gotta pay to give like I every, I got my wife a black card and it's like, it's 20. I think I paid 5,000. I think we paid 5,000 a year just for her card just to have. Right. Which is fine.


But then she gets a separate bill. Right. So when you give someone your card, there's a still a sense that I'm putting it on Joe's card. So there's a sense of like, I don't wanna put to go crazy. I got check on 'em. But once somebody has their own card with their own separate account and their own separate Login, gold puts it in the Apple. I'm gonna keep that gold card. You are not getting a black card and get, I tried that shit. I tried to give my wife a platinum card and it was fine until mom was black. Really? Yeah. My wife is Don't trip about shit like that. However, there's a way that they want to look or feel. How can I put it? You want we're equal. We're partners. So you don't wanna walk up in the joint with the black as she pull out the especially gold black gold to black is like to gold.


If I got black, you can pull out the bras, nigga. I What the fuck? Alright nigga, we Not doing that. I'm trying to, Alright, so she won that one. Nigga. I'm trying, I'm trying to tell You right now, a luxury Once Enjoyed becomes a necessity. Just bars. That was good. That was good. That's it. You need once, you could have ended with that at the end. Yeah. We found out about Mark's little un time at the UN and how he landed here at the JBP. Right. You're wondering how I got here on the movies? Oh my Lord. Yo. Oh Shit. You know that. Oh my God. I am happy I missed you guys as a Jamie Fox review.


I'm happy I missed it. I ain't Watch it yet. I finally watched it. I'm happy I missed it. Did you see the show? Did you see the show? Yeah, I saw it. What do you think? I just said I'm happy I missed it. Oh, I'm happy I missed it. My takeaway was, who the fuck knew the Jamie Fox name wasn't Jamie Fox? I didn't know. I didn't know that Either. I did He on TV talking about something. I'm Eddie Bishop. Eric. Eric. Eric, Eric Bishop or some shit. I've been stumped the whole time I was home because his kid's last name is Fox. Huh? Now? Yeah. Explain it to me now. That Is confusing. That's weird. Yeah. Well, I meant, I guess he Le take That one.


I guess he legally changed his name to Fox. Yeah. Started, maybe started off as a stage Name and then fuck it. Nobody went to called Merri anymore. Jamie Fox. Gotta get the fuck outta here. Jamie Fox got, but Jamie Fox is a fly name instead of Eric Bishop. And, and when I googled the, the reason he did it and it couldn't get any flyer in the comedian circuit, they would allow the female comedians to go on first. So he changed his name to Jamie Fox so it would read as a female so he could get a shot. Oh, That's deep. That's wild. That's pretty snazzy. That's fly. That's deep. Brilliant. That's pretty snazzy. Did You think it was a piece of shit like Ice?


Did I thought Ice got a bad rap. I thought he got a bad rap. I did. I did. But also Ice. Shout to Ice. That's my brother. That's my man. That's my brother. Also Ice gets stuck on something and stay there. So if he's saying I thought it was a comedy. I thought it was a comedy. I feel you. So did I, in the first 10 minutes I realized what it was. Right. And I'm like, okay, we not here to, we not here for what I, what I came for. Which is okay. Which is okay. The impersonation bit wasn't for me. That Cat Williams should have me rolling That too wasn't it Didn't for me.


Jamie Fox for me, is already one of the most talented people on earth. This seemed like a reaffirmation for him. And, and I support him getting that, being deserving of it and feeling like it was warranted or needed at the time. Didn didn't love the, Hey, if I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Like I didn't. Yeah. It was a little, don't make me say it so I won't. What I punky I won't, I won't. Jolly there's no need. I love Jamie Fox and everything he does. But if I could stay, if that's what you needed to stay alive great. In the middle of this bit that I'm watching, like, and don't make me say it too, Right.


Like you start making it the crowd then the daughter on the guitar. Little schmulty schmulty Schmulty. What, what does that mean? Like, unnecessarily, overly s it's like S sac. Yeah. Like, like a little too sentimental, but like fake kind of like Yeah. Performative. Performative Tear jerking. Yeah. Now Jamie Foxx is a phenomenal actor. So he could sit up there and fake cry all day. Right. The daughter's acting skills told me that they have done this a few times before and she duh, it can't act as well as him and then they pan to her. How did you feel during the whole thing? Well, dad, I always knew that we would share a stage together one day.


So I knew you would stay alive. Oh yes. Sm Okay. Sm Smoltz sm Okay. Okay. And then I've watched people play the guitar before. So That, that, that was, that was also A Huge, like I got musicians in my family. Like if you don't then I get it. But if you do Right. And you watch the the Come on, don't make me do it. Don't know. No, I can't do it. Did you see it? No. Oh man, Don't waste your time. Oh, 50 took a while to come out, huh? No he didn't. No, he didn't.

I wasn't coming here to say nothing positive about dude, so. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Oh my lord. Anyway. Yeah. Jamie Foxx. I didn. Yeah. I watched it after I ice set a bar so low for me that I thought it was gonna be terrible. I watched the first, It was good. It was solid. It was, it was engaging. Yeah. And, and and, and I listened to while I was driving to DC so it was, it was great to hear but I, I laughed like twice and once I accepted that I wasn't there to laugh then it, Then it was Awesome.


It was fine. It was engaging. Yeah, it was fine. Yeah. Yeah. Jamie Fox is the mayor. Shout out to Jamie Fox. Shout out to Fox. Glad he's, well It might have been funnier if you'd watched it though because you would've been able to see what he was doing on stage. I mean I watched the first 30 and then listened to the next. His daughter won't see up stage in s Not nice. I can't, it's not nice bro. Leave the man's daughter alone. Alright. I Chilling. Let it go. She the play the guitar. Right? She ain.

Yeah, he put on a phenomenal show in in in Vegas. And this in large parts to me felt like some of that show but in a much bigger place.


So there were times where I couldn't see him. I was seated in the front. We had good seats. Yeah. But the stage is huge so I didn't see him the entire time. Then Vegas Was more intimate. Vegas he did more singing, more dancing. This one felt a little more like a karaoke vibe. Girls love karaoke. Like everybody just kind of singing the singing. The S slaps. He did songs in Vegas that he didn't do at the Barclays. Like him not doing Glue for me is absolutely crazy. I hit Vegas when Glue first came out and Glue was just a phenomenal usher record. And then when we went to Vegas, I mean he saw me in the crowd, came over there, take my girl's hand, pick her up, fucking swing her, do the doey dough while I'm sitting there looking stupid in the face.

'cause they, they went back and told him. And then Yoyo saw me at Coney Island was giving me some rundown of things that I might've done that looks a little crazy. So when 50 saw me, he said, yo, he think I don't like him. Mm. But I don't like the niggas that be around you. It is just, it's a mind fuck. Like, it's so much niggas I be around like, who could he be referring to? So, But he's another one with that, that, that, that tick I be referring to. Yeah. You you say That joke. No, no. Dead ass. What, what? Tick. He's a brilliant thinker. Yes. Oh yeah, for sure. I think that there are some people that have succeeded no matter what. Whatever you put in front of him, some people that's just too resilient. And with that resilience comes another side to be able to deal with whatever's coming.


I think 50 has that. I think Hove has that. Yes. Some of the black people that have made it like past music, they funk Kanye. They got a tick in their brain that enables them to think differently. They think differently. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. 50 got another thing though. That sometimes makes me uncomfortable. And I've seen it up close when I've interviewed him and I've seen it from a distance. He's a genius. He's brilliant in all these areas. And I, I'm a fan, but there's a way that he wants to destroy his competition even after he already won that. I don't sometimes, like, like when I watched the way he still come, the the pleasure he seems to be getting from watching Puff crumble.


If, if he, if I was like, yo, he just hates predators. Cool. But it don't feel like that the way he came at comes at ho you know, on, on, on, on the recent saying he only got these awards 'cause he is married to Beyonce. Ownership. It seems like there's a way that he wants to def like Annihilate. Annihilate. That's it. He doesn't just wanna win. He wants to annihilate and I don't know. They're doing things to him as well. Well, I can appreciate that though. Yeah. He's just doing things publicly. The things are happening behind the scenes when it comes to fifth. He's just willing to expose it. That's fifth. Okay. That's helpful. Because he know that you're not gonna with him, in my opinion that he know that they're not gonna take it. But so far, when it comes to him, 'cause he's willing to go as far as you're willing to go. Right. So he could just say whatever he wants. Like with It is just niggas is doing funny shit behind the scenes.


Okay. That's helpful. I I'll leave it at that. And again, none of these niggas are friends. True. Right. Like even through the lens, through the lens of friendship. I think there's some people that recognize these people, even if I'm standing next to them, are competition. Right. Until when though. That's, that's all I'm saying. When is, when do you just say I won and I don't give, I'm like, ho I'm already home. The people that I think he continues to talk about, you never get that I won moment. 'cause you're talking about Puff and Hove. Yeah. Two of The, two of the black billionaires that b before all of this scandal. Yeah. How many instances did you get to pop out and feel like you got the better of either one of them? But look, Look at this real quick.


Mark. Sorry. When he speaks about hov, he said Hov tried to, you know, we know the story. Tried to prevent him from doing the Super Bowl until m stepped in. Now with fifth year Queens nigga, he still the street. Like he think, okay now you being funny, you still doing funny shit. Niggas past music and you still doing things to sort of either eliminate or remove the competition when I'm not no competition to you. They, they on two different paths to me, I think Hope has that same annihilation. I I agree. Yes. It's low key. It is a very different way. But they not dropping the album got better marketing on, on it. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. That's fair. That might be right. Yeah. That might be. I think he's got that same every time Nas, every time Nas dropped the album Ho dropped an album back. That shit was a coincidence that nobody said nothing. Yeah.


Yeah. He like, who does that? Yo yo Nas salute. Yo. He trying say I don't like that Joe. You know that's F Joe. That is every time he has done that a couple times every time, Joe. That's nasty son. I know Big Face. Gary and Dame Dame Dash got a interview out now we, I just saw him. We over here. We, Gary is telling Dame. Yeah. Joe Button was talking about he didn't get his Rockefeller chain and Saw, said, saw. Yeah. Ho wouldn't sign off and Joey never signed off on Joe Pan album out over there. So you can't get a Rockefeller chain if you don't put the album out.


Did you know at the time 'cause because Dames whole thing was, he had to be the bad guy. 'cause he didn't wanna make ho he didn't wanna say like, ho don't fuck with you like that. At the time were you blaming Dame for not getting the Rockefeller chamber and not getting the budget and not getting the album? No, my focus wasn't a Rockefeller chain at the time. I was trying to get off of a label that I felt no longer suited me, which was Def Jam. Well at least get in the hands of somebody that could help me have a relationship with the distributor. So no, I was going from Def Jam under one regime to Rockefeller. Hopefully they could get something popping over here. El wasn't thinking about a chain at all. Mm. I was trying to do music And, and the lack of like movement on that. And I Knew that Dame was the one that got me on Rockefeller.


Gotcha. That's what I'm at. Okay. Nice. Yeah. Hovan and I back then, yeah, we got better as the, as the years went on. And I put that all on me by the way. I don't put that on him. Even if he had nefarious intent, like I don't, I don't put it on on him, but you Put it on you based off of growth. Now I put it on me. 'cause I was emotionally immature back then. I was like no matter what I was feeling is a proper way to go about it. And I didn't have any of that in my twenties. But that's the growth part because that doesn't negate the fact of what was being done to you wasn't being done. It was still being done To you. Life on life. Things were still being done. Life, life gone always life. That part is never, never gonna be absent. Yeah, I get it.


I Get it. It is always gonna be a point where somebody's doing some fuck shit or some situation is said, listen, anything on your plate, you will it to you. Anything in your life, you deserve it. You Brought it there. So I feel like that today. So yeah. It's not nothing but with me and him, but in my twenties. Yeah. Yeah. And it wasn't just me, but no it wasn't. We can talk about that later. What else? What Else, what else, what else, what Else? I think it's about that time, Joe. Really? You're We on time. Yo. Yo. What's good? Yo, it's time. It's about that time, Joe.

I actually, that's what I've been doing a lot though also during my playing hooky. I've been shopping shopping, I've been shopping on Fifth Ave. Oh Wow. No, I always shopping for that. Don't go. No, I know, I understand. But during the holidays, just extra white people out there. It is a lot of white people. It is nothing but white people out there. I wanna let y'all know on, on this big broadcast that we do here, the evil white people during holiday shopping have effectively killed, excuse me, for me, it's no more. Excuse me. Pardon? Self. Pardon me? Just pushing through. No bumps is back. Oh, okay. Bumps is back.


Boom. Yeah, they on their phones. They not looking up. Yeah, they not moving. Even if they see you, they just down for the head-to-head collision. They're going crazy. Yeah. I like to punctuate that with a share the fucking sidewalk. They won't. Right, right. As soon as I shoulder checked Them. Yeah, no bump bumps his back. I'm aggressive. I don't give a fuck. I can tell. And, and and the racist whites are still out there and nothing lets me know that more than the elevators during Christmas shopping. They Clutch their bags. No, they won't get in. They won't get on. Oh Shit. It'll it'll be, it'll be just me in the elevator.


A A whole white family just standing there watching the doors closed now. No, Jill, just go. Just go black   Just go. We'll we'll catch the next one. I ain't sure. Like It is slow. It's gonna be a while. They don't give a fuck. They don't give a fuck Them elevators take a long time this time of year. Oh my Lord. Yes. But shout to all the Christmas shoppers out there. Yeah. Shout out to Them. Are you guys done Christmas shopping? No, I haven't started. I haven't started. I'm bad. Yeah. No. I've started, I've started. I'm like halfway but not much. Stupid ass. Ian talking about sending the Christmas bonuses early in case they plan on shopping early. I'm like, Ian, It's a Nice thought.


Just do it. You know what? You Know what? It's a nice thought. Very nice of him, Ian. No, no. That's a little racist. Like, I wasn't assuming any of you needed the Christmas bonus to Christmas shop. I I See you looked at it. Oh, Y'all could have just, He's like make sure they have heat for cookies. Alright, alright, Alright. Exactly. That's Alright. So what else is going on? I have found humility during my absence or more of it. Say more tonight. I say About to say. Huh? Tell us more. More of it.


And Grace as I will exhibit during this next topic when We talk about Travis Hunter and his girlfriend. Thank You. I'm so sick of him. Thank You. Him. Them, he didn't do nothing though. I'm sick of her. Neither does she? What is she? This girl? She's his girlfriend. No, no, no, no, no. What is she though? Oh, what's her nationality? Yeah. What's her thing? Colombian Or some, some shit probably. I dunno. I watched eight minutes of her on social media. Me too. Was do it. She's not black. I think she's some kind of Hispanic. Yeah. Latin American. Hispanic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it seemed, seemed like. I thought They threw some Filipino in there somewhere too. Oh, That could be it. Yeah. She act like it's some of that in there somewhere. She Doesn't respect the black man, bro.


Man, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to have grace 'cause she's young. No, Fuck that grace shit. But she's, she's getting mistreated. I said this the last time and watching her video, I'm like, capes out. Yo, there we go. Mark, don't play. I know She look good, but Fuck, that ain't about how she look. It is like, like she said, people were like, why you sitting in that seat? She explained we had assigned seats. People were like, why are you getting up? Why didn't you get up? Because I wanted him to have his moment. I mean, she had a a a a thought process that to me made sense. Even if I wouldn't do the same thing. I think we assigned the worst motives to her. And I don't think she has bad motives. So is her thought process immature? Yeah. Okay. So because she's young. Yeah. Okay. I see what you're saying. Yeah. When you say motive, it throws me off. Well, because I'm not gonna, I don't, I don't think that her motive is bad.


I think sometimes you can be too concerned with only your emotions at the wrong time. Selfish. IE his last game at Colorado, when he put up those big numbers and she was mad that he stepped to the cheerleader. That just may not have been the best time for that. I don't care about the story of Yeah. He wasn't my type. Yeah. I don't care about that. Well, she also explained the cheerleader thing. She said it had something her, her distaste wasn't for him. And the cheerleader, it was that family wasn't allowed on the field. Whatever the distaste is about. Not now. I'm not saying she didn't have fair reasoning. Just not right now.


Well, she didn't know she was being watched like that. Like she said, she, I didn't know the cameras were everywhere. Again, I'm not saying her behaviors. Right. Well, I agree with that. Same thing Adele said. Man, I think they got a PR team for this whole relationship. But she's a kid though. It feels that way. I think they don't For real. Yeah. They probably Don't. The PR team would not have allowed her to get on For eight minutes. They're not signing off on any of This shit. They, they keep addressing it. Especially social media talking. Yeah. Then that shit at the Heisman. Yeah. Do I have to sit Here? Last, last to get up first to sit down. Looks away. Right. Even if unintentionally, that does come off away. Especially if you don't know what to do in those instances. Do what mom is doing.


But see on the internet, if you're not black and you do what black mom is doing, people say she raised that boy. Why are you trying to step in where the mom is? Why are you trying to take that spot? I feel like you can't win. Do win For losing what then do what coach is doing. Do what to start. All three of the people that are most important in this moment stood up and she sat down. But it's cool. Let's say we give that you get a reprieve. Fine. Then afterward I'm at the Adidas. The Adidas is throwing the function. I just signed a big deal with Adidas. I'm taking pictures, shaking hands, kissing babies. And you on the couch saying the fuck I'm supposed to do. Just keep sitting here while you take pictures. Let me answer it for you.


Yes. Yes. That is exactly what you should do in that moment. Again, I'm gonna give her grace because she's young. Yes. Like how old is she? 22. Young. She's young. I thought woman mature faster than men. She's young. No, that does, there's a difference between maturity and knowing what to do when you're thrust into the spotlight and you're not even the person that people are supposed to be paying attention to. Right. You just don't have that level of sophistication yet. All of y'all out there laughed when Brittany Renner was talking about giving courses to college athletes. Talk about to teach them about women like her or that she identified with once.


If there's ever somebody that needed that class. It's, It sure is. Yeah. Them. And that's why you get a, a PR team and you spend your, you invest your money in learning how to deal with the media. I'm not saying she's perfect. I'm not even saying everything she did was right. Although some stuff I think she got a bad rap for. To me, it's just when I look on the internet, I hear people acting like she's a gold digger. She's trying to bring 'em down. She's trying to embarrass. It's like the worst motives get attached to her. Her and I don't, I think we need to give Well that's, well I don't, I don't know about the gold digging part, but It is embarrassing. And you have to blame him as well. I don know what type of simp kb has. I do blame him as well because he's making, I gotta be a simp though. Because he's making a lot of excuses for trash behavior. It's trash behavior. It's embarrassing black. Your mom is there. Imagine what his mom is saying to him.


Like she's supposed to be a representation of you. You know what I mean? Act accordingly regardless. Look, cameras is there. We let you get away with the first one when the second, third, fourth times now your behavior is unexcusable. We can't keep giving you a pass on your behavior. It's intentional. You just, I am. You just, you just, huh. I'm gonna keep giving them a pass. 'cause it's like, it's one of those Things where not when you get into Heisman and all that shit and you ask a nigga something bro. Like, nigga like my, listen, listen yo, People love doosies. Like what can you say about somebody That is in love with a doofus? Imagine there's Nothing you can say. You don't pick. You don't pick who you love. My bitch is doofy. Yo, imagine that's it. Lemme give you an example. She's my bitch. Yeah. She's my aunt.


Y'all don't call her. Do I know she doofy Play around. She my doof. Imagine. That's my do. Imagine Your girl what? Getting graduation, getting her masters or whatever, da da da da. And niggas get up and clap for her. You just sitting there like this, you going make you embarrassing her and you gonna make yourself look stupid. That's what she, she's doing things that important moments of his life. I don't respect that. Fuck her. Have you not like that? Not fuck her, but like fuck excusing her behavior. I mean, have you ever been thrust into a new platform where you don't know how to behave or where the the rules and the norms are different and you look at a place? Yes, you look your behaviors Here. That's where I was going. I was doing my professor thing. But like, I guess what I'm saying, like I would think, I would think you'd have some grace.


I'm saying Look for the, for the Come on man. Stop for the Colombian. Listen. No, I'm just saying like you, I I would think you could relate. No, I can't. Being in the, because you only get one pass up here. Like It is how freak you only get one pass. No, you supposed to only get one pass in certain things Joe. And we have, you said you only supposed to get one pass and we have an edit. I don't think he's talking up here. You can't, you can't be talking up here. But that's my point. Like no, I'm not talking about a, I'm just talking about in general like when it comes that up here It is different. You can edit This shit. Like niggas that's No, but I'm saying is your mistakes my mistakes. Everybody's mistakes are earnest ones. Like let's give her the same grace that we, that we would want for ourselves. How many grace can we give her at 21, 22? A whole lot. And Also this is happening within a very short amount of Time.


Come on man. I expect man you know Travis, Travis need to holler at you Mel. So you give 'em class, give 'em like, not like in that way, but you need to give some game. Mel would've been like this Heisman. It is my second one. Nigga. They took a first from another nigga. Mel would've been up like this nigga. I Yo Mel dip on that Chicago nigga so fast. If you get a young fresh ripe Heisman Award winner plays both sides of the ball. Are you? Shit he shitting me. Hey Chicago pd. Gotcha. Lock me up. Oops. I'm giving Grace. Okay, you You just doing that for the kids. There's no way Joe. Ain't no way, way.


I watch you in in person. Ignore it. I killed way. I came up here and told Mark when he was on his brony shit like, yo, these are kids. I want to give them some type of great they kids. Yo Brony just, and Brony made th shot 30 points. And I think he gonna clip, he gonna clip her soon whether he know or not anyway. Oh. Like you know sometimes that you Got it with the grandparents come around, they going to, they know where your relationship is going but maybe before you, I don't, I don't think they gonna be, You know what I mean? I don't wish it On em. I I think they got a ringing a baby in it. How embarrassing It is for a girl to go online and say yo, this nigga dropped me off the party and waited outside for me to finish partying. What? That Was a little weird. Bitch, are you crazy That He begged her up? Yeah. You trying to play my Band? Yeah. She in the nude just too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Like just go away somewhere. Stop. It ain't, it ain't about You right now. Don't Think they got a prt might not be a good one but I'm seeing them too much for They got a PRT for, Shouldn't be seeing college kids This week. But you seeing her for the wrong reason. You keep seeing her 'cause she keeps saying stupid shit. True. Yeah. Yeah. She just needs to move out of the media eye for like a I agree. I agree with that. Just don't say nothing. Yeah. Like we not here for you yo. We not here for you. You come along you the plus one. Right. So ain like I fucking, Hey yo, there's a lot of girls. Hey yo. Hey yo. What's Travis? What's name Travis? Travis. Travis Travis. A lot of girls out there. The OGs out there go to Starless and one of them get one of them that know how to hold it down and treat You right. And they gonna play their position. I mean think About it though. He's got Deion Sanders to give him game.


Right. You would think he's aware of what he's Doing. He not listening. I think they got bigger fish to fry right now. But Deion should be thinking about draft position only. True. Yeah. We'll get to your love life later. We Got it is money time. She probably doing shit that he never experienced. Paul doing the twirl watch me spin in real time. No, I cultural differences be, boy I ain't hold you and you ever go to the party with your girl. That is just your girl. But it ain't like, You know what I mean? And she go in there trying to fucking act like you with all the history of these people and with her chest out like she done did something just she had with you.


Man. If you don't go get some fucking punch and sit down, you don't know these people. They ain't give a fuck about you. It ain't about You right now. Right. Yeah. She gave us a whole dating history. I dated a soccer player and I dated a such and such. Oh, you ain't dating no niggas. This your first nigga. Right. She started at the top floor too. Like that's the thing, like women like that, a lot of times we will only date the black dude if he's a Heisman trophy. And, and that's what the internet is getting at. Right. That you are only fucking with him because he's a star. You only fuck with him because he's elite and you're gonna take his money and leave. That's what the, that's what the world Is. That is the assumption. That's Assumption. But she's rubbing it in our faces. Like she's not even denying it. She's Not, I don't think that she understands what the mag like the magnitude of what she's saying.


That's what I'm saying. And how bad it sounds. Okay. Sounds crazy. I I I truly think that she has no clue. Yeah. Until it's out and everybody is fucking crucifying her. That's why, that's why, that's why Ross is my man. Right?

Is he upset publicly or you just No, no, no, no. Not upset publicly.

Who was the last one that was it? Ricky Williams. Remember Mel? You have any idea? I Think it was Ricky Williams. No. Hell, you know it could be. It could be.

I got so ass on fi and for real, I'm not playing with you. What The record label money too. Yeah. Yeah.


Which is crazy. You know. 'cause he just sold his masters. He just made like, I think 300 million some shit like that. God. And he just had that just sitting like in a regular bank account. Well that's the first thing I didn understand. Like how is $80 million that accessible? What do you mean? In a regular bank account? Where where should, Where Should it be? Well, there's estates, trusts, Cayman Islands offshore. At least a good CD something. Yeah. I feel like she, he was Floyd Mayweather and it just had that shit like in the, in the, in the Santander. Yeah, he might have both. I was about to say, If you got 380 of it, a hundred of it could go over there. True. It's just the FDIC don't insure it. Pass what? A million? A million to make some shit like that. Yeah. It just seems like a very unsafe, unproductive way to use your money. But I ain't got that kinda money, so I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah, but it just seemed weird to me.


How That's crazy. 80, $80 million. So when I'm gonna notice. Yeah, for sure. Oh, I would notice. I'm gonna notice that. I would know. I check my bank account every two hours, every four hours. What?

Like Park. Oh. For being I'm Parks Camp. You may, you may, You may get a big check and then you check it again.


It's a chunk of the shit. Like, wait, where the fuck did that go? Like you just gotta check it just to make sure things is I'm perpetuate nigga, I don't even do auto bill pay 'cause I'm scared like every month. Who's paying your bills? Var. Me. I'm just saying. I don, I don't want auto deduction because I'm scared. There's gonna be a moment where my shit is fucked up and it's go. Verizon calls me like your call has been rerouted. Oh Shit. Like every month. Not 'cause I ain't got the money, but because I'm scared to have auto pay Mark. You have to stop paying your own bills. Shit. What Are you doing? Okay, wait, hold on. Do you replenish your easy pass through Auto Pay? That's the one thing I do. 'cause I drive. You know town. That's the One thing that'll fuck You right. Oh, really? Easy Pass. Yeah.

Why are you doing this? He was looking for the Bonus. This Shit could go somewhere. Somebody could say apparently a bonus was coming in. I just checked my shit just now. Again. He like refresh no bonus. Refresh. Exactly. No bonus. Right. I love learning. Next refresh we call Uber. How long it take to get out this motherfucker? Man, Y'all crazy. Yeah, but do you ever think that what you saw there two hours ago is not about to be there? That's my worry. That's my perpetual worry. And I don't have any reason to think that. Except it could, you just never know what happens. You never know.


Somebody takes your money. Somebody, somebody hits some internet, scam some shit. Ha. I don't know. I just want to check it. I'm not worried. My wife has access too. I'm not worried about her taking the money. It, it's our money. She could do what she wants with the money. As long as I know where it went, I'm okay. But it it, it can't go nowhere where? I don't know. And I'm gonna check it every couple hours. In fact, talking right now has me uncomfortable.

Check it up big now As life alert you fuck. What's LifeLock? LifeLock is a service that basically kind of ensures that Well you got a LifeLock Ad first. This a Commercial. Okay. No, no, no. I don't put your voice. You put your cameo voice on it. She really did. I know glad you asked. No, write it down. But It is basically a service that ba that high or sorry, alerts you if there is some weird activity going on On the black market and stuff Like that. If your information gets put out there. Oh yeah.

There's nobody to watch. Yeah. You only motherfucking watch. Not pocket watching. I'm just saying that You feel, Are you crazy? I get to pocket watch and every time I see one of little late night rooms, mark be doing Mark with Jessica van talking about the laws in Egypt and how they going to, I'm like, oh, you back at It. Put my tin cans. Yeah. He don't, he don't play about that shit. He gets what else? What else, what else, what else? Luigi represented by wife of Diddy's lawyer. Is it too soon to say I like this guy A little bit Fucked? No, everybody's been expressing the same thing.


Fucked up. He's He's also a hero. He's a hero. You tell me about it. To the people. To the people. No, he, he did. How could he not be? He found the one functioning city bike. And That's a fact. And got to p on that shit. That nigga got a city bike, went through Central Park, and then he just got hungry. But why McDonald's? That seems like the worst place to fucking go. Nah, No. It seems actually pretty smart. I'd be at Perkins, I'd be a White Castle. I'd be at some place that has a little less Lot of volume somewhere. Not corporate is where I would be. I figured that's Smart. Oh yeah. Like a bodega. Yeah. Getting a chopped cheese or something. Yeah, because ain't nobody Poppy ain't never calling nobody.


Never. They could know you, the person they're not gonna call. Never. That's Where I went wrong. He probably just felt like I'm in an obscure town. Altoona. Yeah. Like who's supposed to see somebody out there except for the one McDonald's worker that sees you. And then they say, all right, we still not paying you, we still not giving you your reward money. I thought they, I Thought it's gonna be split three ways. Yeah, man. Yeah. How much was the reward? 60 grand. Oh. That'll make any, that's nice. Yeah. That'll make a tell. Yeah, That'll make it out. But he ain't gonna get the whole thing because there's two people that saw him first. So it's gonna be split three ways. 20,000 is enough to snitch. Nigga you don't know nigga, nigga snitch for a whole lot less. I'm, I'm negotiating.


Well first of all, I'm not doing nothing for 20 grand. One, two, I'm negotiating contingent upon what they did. Like how bad do you want this person? If I got the answer be right over there, I can tell you it Does seem for him. That company that would make a lot of money over there. Yeah. Think that they would. You know what I mean? That's A solid point. But that's how the healthcare companies is. They made $300 billion. We'll give you 20,000 if you tell us who killed. Yeah. Luigi being villainized and Daniel Penny being big upped. It is some sick shit. Well I don't think Luigi's really being villainized. People are praising Luigi. Not the people that matter. Oh, okay. That's what you saying. The fans. The fans maybe. Yeah. Twitter. That of em. Do you conspiracy? Isha Isa was here talking about it's the greatest conspiracy ever.


That he's not really the guy. And that there was a whole thing. Oh God sake. That was Listen while I was gone takes Were getting off, off. No, no, no, no, no. Get it off. Let It out. I'm super appreciative and grateful. You trying to hold Back to the speech back. The trying hold each what's Some hands come together time for the speech To each member for the job that they did. Let it out. Man. Some takes was getting off. Yo, that 10 shit. Thank y'all for upholding the fabric of this thing.


But what was we say? Luigi and Luigi, whether he did it or Not, the alleged Criminal. No, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't think It is a conspiracy. Yeah. I I I don't think he's a criminal mastermind either. I think he's a It is a, It is a couple things. Like I think he's a white guy. Like if you do the same crime with the same technology, you get caught. You don't make it, you don't make it to Harold Square. But a white guy on a city bike isn't going to get caught in the same way. I think his whiteness got him through. I think he's a tech genius. He's an engineer. He knew how to make a weapon. He knew how to make all that shit. But that don't mean you know how to run through the cops. Nah. He was just calm and poised in in that situation. That's it. Like sometimes other people, if it was one of us, nigga shot him, went back, shot more ba bow started rolling.


Yeah. We would've stood over and ran something. I, I'm joking, but in, in that situation, one thing that stuck out to me is how calm he was in the situation. Yeah. Like he wasn't, he wasn't nervous. It didn't appear to be, he wasn't erratic. He just, he looked comfortable, went by the garbage comfortable. Took a bike. He rode slowly. I tell you one thing, I was, he none. I was looking for him when the cops was looking for him to challenge him to a Monopoly game. Who the fuck you think you are nigga? Fuck You think you are running around with Monopoly money in your backpack like you built like that. I'll smoke your fucking boots in Monopoly. Joe, stop This nigga. Oh God. A lot of niggas don't think you can play. He was about to anger me. It don't Matter. But he had Monopoly money in his bag. Like, dog, don't play with me. I'll find you. I'll come find you with the board and we can get to it.


There was, there was a conversation that was had while you were going. Oh My God. Yeah. He was. And I'm, I'm, I'm trying not to raise my blood pressure. Go ahead. We'll go to Spades. Yeah. I'm not even gonna go to Monopoly. I'm gonna go to Spades. Right. 'cause I, I don't pretend to be a great Monopoly player 'cause I'm an adult, but Oh Shit. Shoot the ladders. I get you nigga. No, I don't know. But Spades, I'd simply made a claim that I, that I was a very good spades player. I feel like you said that you were the greatest spades player. What? I said the part, I said I'm the best spades player he's ever met. Like in real life. Like I'm sure's people on TV or in some Olympic shit. But like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm special. Ask him the question. I'm special. And I, I went and Twitter and I had an engagement about it and then this dude jumps in.


You don't even look like a space. I don't look like a space player. Nah. You know what's funny about him? Because I, what the Fuck is a space player look like? Not like you. They not like us. They not like us. This guy. Because then he is on Twitter saying, yeah. Of all the people up there. I believe Jay Juan probably could play 'cause he went to A-H-B-C-U. Like he said that. I'm talking about for my opponents. How much money you, I'm not saying you can't play, but you would. I will ever be on the same page. Anything. I shouldn't be inserted into this foolishness. I think you should be able to get off whatever lies you want to get off. There's no lie that you told me on the Broadcast, bro. Like I'm more, I was more ashamed of the crew. Specifically Ice and ish. Or maybe they know something about you that you don't know.


Mm. Which would be That you're not as good as you think you are. Mark, you're making a grave mistake. It is. This is not like the basketball thing. No, I think you have a better chance of that. You, You maybe have a shot there. I was about say you have a shot at basketball. Wait, hold on. Didn't that date pass? No, no, no. We're doing it in January. He had an emergency. Ah, No. Not, not that was the date. We was booking gyms. We, the book gym was always booked for January. I'm sorry that they didn't let y'all know that. But it's booked for January. That's probably in my, my bonus email. Yeah. I couldn't believe they let you sit up there and say say that in, in any set that, that I'm a part of. I I'm sure you're a fine space player. Seriously. I I think you are as good as the average person at Spade.


Oh Shit. I'm just telling you that. You can't beat me. Mike, How much money have you played for? I don't know. I don't really gamble. Spade gets tricky. No, I ain't gonna lie to you. I don't really gamble. That spades ain't a gambling game for me. It is because It is because you don't wanna take other people's money. No, it's not even that. I'm not going, I'm just saying I don't at You. We just talk shit. When we play Spades. I never spades play from how do play big joke of little joke to a diamond, to a spade. Got It. But, but we could play black man, you know, higher, You know what I mean? Or we, we could or we could just throw 'em out and say, no, no top, no, no big face cards. We can do whatever you want. I spoke to my partner about you. So that was the other thing. I spoke to my partner, he text, so he texted me and says, I I just left my partner Now. Y on Instagram.


You had just left a 7-year-old birthday party. Yeah. So Happy Birthday to my baby. I love you. Is that your partner? Oh Shit. No. My, my dad's my partner. Oh, nigga, It is over. I'm, I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable. We're fine. We're fine. Yo, let's set up You talking too much words? No, no, let's set it up. Playing with your dad is beautiful. It's, it's a great, just the two of us moment. Set it up. I Got cards right there. The only place for Money though. Yeah. I will play for, I don't mind playing for money. Call Pops. Can I, can I plug this? It's right there. Is this Marcus? Yes It is. Hey Marcus. It is. It is Joe Button, man. How, how you doing? I Got the numbers saved. I'm doing great.


What's going On? Nothing much, man. Happy holidays to you and your family. Happy Holidays to YouTube man. Gimme, get some money man. Listen, I'm calling you. I got a really disrespectful co-host who is not only challenging me to a spade game, but once I told him that my partners, my dad, he laughed and said, I'm not worried about y'all at all. Now this guy, I've never seen him play. I don't know if he played for money. I don't know. I don't know, but I'm just calling you so maybe you could tell him that this is a bad idea. 'cause I ain't seen you in years. Right? Here's been a while. Actually.


Before, before you took off to the moon, yo. Oh, Thank you. Congratulations Man. Thank you man. Thank you. Can so can you just tell him as being like one of my former victims? Oh wow. The disrespect You asked me Do you a favor for coming at me with dis All. I apologize. There you go. I apologize. Wow. But I mean, just tell him what, what type of tree's barking up at least. Well, I mean, if he's a smart man, he won't put no money up unless he got to lose. If he's a sharp guy, let he, if he like throwing money in the garbage can, just might as well burn it. Which he may. Which he may. But he also said he don't really play for money and all.


He's like one of 'em guys that played for fun. Like he went to HBCU. So he think he like mean Oh, oh, he's a young buck. He's older. He's a Young buck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. About 46. It is his birthday today actually. Oh, It is his birthday. Yeah. Whip his ass for his birthday. Yeah, That's what I'm saying. Yo. Yo. Marcus, if you played Joe right now, who would win? You or him? You said what? If you played Joe right now in spades, your squad versus his squad, who would win? I have to be honest with you. I, I mean, I I, I'm out the game a little bit. I don't play as much. So we ended him kill me right now. We ended him, me and my partner came to his place of work and ended him never to be seen again. Listen, that, that, that, that, that's false premises. Right? That's not the truth right there. That that's this whole shit sounds shaky.


That's, that's not authentic. But, but you know what, Joe? I know you, you and jurors you have to block me. You know, I'm, you know, I live, you know, I'm gonna bring a partner to meet you over there when, and not you can't play with your father. 'cause you and your father got too much. I don't know what the fuck is going On. They cheat. I already know they cheat you talking across the board and shit. I don't think they cheat. I won't call it cheating. I just think they know each other very well. Where, you know, that's fire. The, the, if I lead with this, you know what to do. It's like a mental thing. It's not Just, that's just being good at spades. I could live with that. It's Just, they, they got that spades connection. I wouldn't wanna play with him and the father. You gonna lose.

No, and I, and I app, she actually was friends with my ex, one of my exes and Oh wow. Oh yeah. That tells us A lot. Clap it up for that. And yeah, so she was always like the little sister, the homie. But like, watching her grind and get better at the craft, you just more proud of her work. So proud.


Mm. The grind. You a freaky ass nigga. Thank you. Y'all just No, I'm happy for Taylor too. Shout congratulations of the show. Taylor Rooks, friend of the show. We absolutely love her. And shout out to Amazon for, for promoting black talent. Yeah, That's, that's the point to me. How about that bar? And I mean, and think about like when we were watching the NBA back in the day when it was like Peter Vessey and like all these Marv Albert, Marv Albert. And now you got Malika Andrews, you know, doing some stuff on ES, esp n you know, the, the, the daily NB show, whatever you think. I'm just saying like to see like black women in positions of power in sports and visible positions as well. I like, I wanna see 'em behind the scenes as producers, but also like on camera. That's a beautiful thing.


And that's a lot of growth, man. We would've never seen that 20 years ago, Joe. I didn, well I educated them on last pod about Jane Kennedy. Oh, the legendary Jane. They know Jane. You, They did not know who's Jane Kennedy. The Girls. Yeah, remember. But then I also told them how Oh, Not what the, that's Angela Davis. Oh, I Don't know her then I, yeah, exactly. Remember she Got shot out, miss Fat booty. She, she looked like Jane Kennedy. Nah, that's what most was talking about. Okay. Well then I also educated on them on what destroyed her career. Indeed. We don't need to rehash it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we did it. Married people in the building. Who was the ghetto side of the family at the wedding?


Mine. Mine. Mine for sure. My side. Okay. How about you? In the event that we are married? No, like if there were a wedding, who'd be the, who'd be the, I'd Probably plead the fifth. Pleading the fifth is probably the best shit It is In the world. That's In this instance. I, I told my, I told my girl my answer though. She knows who. I think we'll be the ghetto people. But don't do it publicly. Smart. No, no, no. Nope, nope. No. I plead the fifth on that one. I don know man. I just don't know. Gotta see. Gotta see. You gotta see. Listen, I keep saying I want a small wedding.


Take me to city hall. Let me elope. Well, that's what we did, but we're gonna do a wedding. Oh, you gonna do one Like after the fact? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're gonna do one probably in the next 12 months. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We, we, we, we, we did like we, we got married 'cause we wanted to be married and all of that. And, but it's like, we want, we want a real ceremony. So here or destination. That's the, that's eight. That's what, that's what, that's what we've been going back and forth about. You know, I would like something small, simple in a way. But, you know, my mother's older. Our our mother's are older. Some other stuff we, so we may end up doing something here in, in the States. So, you know, but so, so we're really on the fence about it. Yeah. We on fence about it.


Why, why, what, what you thinking? Oh no, I'm, I'm laughing. My family had some type of family reunion recently in Tampa. I guess we lost a vote to have it in South Carolina where my aunt, my aunt's, older aunt's, 90, 91, 92 are. And they made my fucking 90-year-old aunt go to table. Oh Shit, I'm gonna fuck my family up. So listening to you talk about the moms being older and the destination where it just made me think of my aunt and how old people get it bad. They just make them trek. Yeah. They don't give a fuck. That's fucked up. But don't give a fuck. Where was your wedding?


Upstate. Upstate. That's probably what we think about. And Mel, if, if y'all end up continuing the progress that y'all are progressing on, What, What If y'all continue down this path, continue down This path Of love and bliss that you on right this second. You ain't been to Chicago in months. I don't know how it's, You don't know where I've been. Yes I do. No you don't. I track you. No, you Don you have not been to Chicago. Metal. Metal is gas in it. But we gonna let you live. But he's been here. He's been here. Bitch. I told Mel, I, I joking. I joking. I told Mel, I read her whole text message when she had, when she was feeling free and loose on the pod, she was texting mad messages and her phone was leaning in.


I you better believe I read it. I was all in her business. God, keep gassing them. I'm with you. Isn't That one of the downsides of like being the only woman in like this male dominated fucking workplace is that niggas is in your like love affair business? Yeah. We in your business because we love you. It's okay. I don't think she loves, loves it. We never gonna let no, we ain't gonna let no nigga talk because he an actor. I ain't asked her about it. I don't know. I don't think she loves that Sag after you think let nigga just come around trying to be down. No nigga. It's Okay. It's all, it's all good. But in terms of weddings, I like the idea of a destination wedding. But there's another half Barbados Maybe. Yeah. Nice. That sounds too expensive already.


It does sound very expensive. It's very Expensive. We probably, we think of Puerto Rico. Yeah. There you go. Nice and simple. There You go. On the Peter Pan. On the Peter Pan. Peter Pan plane. Yeah. Fuck all that. What else is important, unimportant. I don't, I don't care. We can talk about anything. Everyone feel free and loose. Don't call for it nigga. Like you don't call, don't call out for the looseness. Let it happen organically. You know, we know this 'cause I'm still waiting for you to, to tell Them I'm not doing. You got to. I know you want me to do it 'cause you've, you've fancy like how my brain looked at this stuff, but I ain't doing it. I'm appreciative.


I got away with a lot of books. I'm appreciative and grateful to each member of this podcast for the job that they did. There was a lot of books in my nigga What? Yo niggas was getting shit off. Yo, you talk about ice and ish with the tinfoil hat on about Luigi. Mine is more so on about the drones over Jersey. I was wondering If you've seen Some drones? Yes. What? Oh, I don't know this story. What? Through the drones You didn't hear About? Are you serious man? Text Angela Ryan. Man. What you been doing? I've been, I've been single for the last five days. Oh, I don't, I didn't watch the news. I didn't do anything. You are the news. I was on the run. I didn't look at the tv. I didn't do shit. Mark, there's drones.


Is is unidentified drones. He Was faithful, right? Yeah. I didn't do nothing. I didn sounding like all No, I'm just saying. I I, I was taking advantage of it When I, when I get five days away and don't see the TV on the phone. I'm telling you. I Mean, but he had a baby strap to him. So you I had a baby. Yeah I was, I was parenting. I remember saying I was just, I was like room service, drinking, Chilling, PlayStation, all this, all the faithful marriage shit. Just To let Mel know. Oh okay. You can cheat with the baby. The Baby. As a matter of fact it might actually Help Right baby faster. Yeah, The baby help you get it off. Yeah, That's A great help. But that's talking my mark just in general. Yeah, yeah. No I don't do that. Okay. So you don't know about drones flying over New Jersey for several weeks?


I identified drones been flying over a jersey every night for several weeks. Oh, is that why y'all was talking about aliens and shit on the pod last week? Yes, yes, yes. It went right over my head. Mad drones and then, you know, the police, the FBI, A lot of you know, a lot of law enforcements are saying they don't know where It is. They don't know where it's coming from but they on it. They're trying to identify where it's coming from. But it's some shit going on and, and the 10 foil hat, people probably think it's aliens and some shit. Yeah. Or something. Yeah. Or something. But I heard that when, you know, somebody said that she spoke to somebody from the Pentagon and they were saying they were looking something pertaining to Gamma. Is it The record label? No, not no Gamma ray or whatever. Something like that.


Something to that effect. Let that sounds like bullshit. Let me find out. You guys talk about it. I'll find out. Trump came out and was like, the government knows what's going on and they're not telling nobody. Now I didn't vote for Trump, but this is one of the reasons I appreciate him. Right. Because he gonna come out and say it's China For sure. He gonna come out and just kind of say some shit he wasn't supposed to say. I also listen to some experts, some people that work with drones and have military contracts. They were saying that they, and not their expert opinion, they don't claim to be experts and they don't wanna spread misinformation like I'm about to do. But they were saying they don't believe that these are evil drones.


They just feel like the government knows where these drones are coming from. He felt like the drones were coming to smell something. Yeah. So Yeah, the Tracking. 'cause there is no reason for he, he says a drone can't really see anything in the nighttime. So there is no reason to send a drone out in the nighttime unless you're in search of a person or a thing. So What I got, and he thought that that was a sync. Go ahead. He said these are our drones tracking gamma rays linked to possible WMDs in the massive counter terror operation. Oh. See that Y'all got WMDs in Jersey. I don't think it's fair that Jersey gets the drones first. Yeah, It is kind of crazy. I Was un shocked by that.


Why Jersey seems like a good first place for aliens to take in this American life. I Feel like it's so uninteresting. Maybe That's why. Interesting. Yet uninteresting at the same time. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like we paid too much in taxes to have to deal with this first. That's a, that's a fact. And Delaware is right there. Like if there were ever a test ground test over there, Nobody go to d yo. Hey yo. They got niggas, they got police officers so scared. They didn't put nobody on nothing. Police officers try to shoot at the drone in Jersey. They got officers, a video officer try to shoot at the drone and It is not, they're not gonna hit the drone. Then they had a meeting in Jersey with all the, all the officials. Yeah, they did. They called an emergency meeting.


I would play the clip, but it's extremely long. And they called them to the meeting to say we don't know shit. So some of the officials left the meeting and to they ass up. I traveled three hours to this bullshit for you to say you have no idea what this is. One of them was like, he was flying a helicopter and one of the drones, a few of the drones came up on his helicopter and he retreated because he was afraid. He, they asked him, how big are these drones? They asked them. They're big, some of them are rumored to be six feet, six eight Feet. Oh Shit. These Are not, not fucking drones. Yeah. Huh. These are not drones. What are they Tell us more Mel.


They're UFOs. Oh see there's some of that shit y'all was doing while I was gone. That's not gonna, that's not gonna, Nobody Knows. What is your basis, what they are, what is your basis? The Fact that everybody's acting fucking stupid and every law enforcement agency is claiming like we don't know what It is. No. Y'all motherfuckers know what It is and you don't wanna deal with masks Hy. But sometimes, but ma they are UFOs but that's, But yeah. But sometimes the higher ups don't communicate with local law enforcements male, the FBI and Homeland. They're not communicating with local Law enforcements. That's my point is that they know what It is and they're not telling us because they don't, they're trying to avoid mass hysteria. Humans Are so stupid that we assume that same stupidity on other entities such as aliens.


Like I believe aliens to have better shit to do than to surveil New Jersey during the holidays. Like what do you, what would you say these aliens are doing? I don't know. Just fucking saying on the next fucking episode of shit Show Earth. I don't know. Maybe they're fucking entertained by the fuck shit going on down here. I don't know. There's nothing going on down there in Jersey. Really? I mean, just life in general. Gotcha. And I feel like if, if it was really fuck shit, somebody would shoot one of them down or tail One. They can't, didn't you say a cop tried, Hey yo, and they, they sent another drone. Local police sent their drones. Cops can't hit number of black people. Right. As soon as the drone got close to that, it, it powered the other drone down.


So when the police officer sent this drone up and as soon as it got close, his drone fell down. They say that they do have some special features like some Apple drones or some shit. Some shit that Could just take the power away. But it's not, it's not aliens. It's not at all. No, I don't think it's Aliens. It's not aliens. Melyssa Ford. Okay. Alright. Real, real quick. And nigga news man outside of the Pentagon with a loaded gun, 14 pounds of marijuana and a Glock switch and his underwear was arrested. Sleepwalking, He See what I mean? Get You every time, Joe. He would not sleep on interest. What do these niggas do with the Pentagon? Leave the Pentagon alone. They'll fuck you up in there. They'll fuck you up. I'm telling you. Is that Breaking?


Yeah, just now. It happened like an hour ago. A hour ago, actually three hours ago. Man, I saw a Pentagon with a loaded of gun, 14 pounds of marijuana and the Glock switch 14 in his Underwear underweight was arrested. 14 pounds. It's an interesting Yeah. Thing to carry by the Pentagon. He's, he probably got some, it's probably some legalization message, You know what I mean? This is the people who wanna do like suicide by cop too. There are a lot of people right now who have mental health issues that want to get taken out by the government. They want to get shot. So they go and do these things just to get stand in front the Pentagon where a Glock or do that. Yeah. Yeah. You, you'll die. Mm. It's part of their message. I don't know. It, It is weird to me, but like the people that set themselves on fire and stuff like that. Exactly. Got it. Exactly. I I I just, I wish more people got mental health.


We, we saw the, the NBA player, we just jumped out of a window. What's that last night? Who the fuck did that? He played for the magic. I'll tell you his name. They wanna be Eric Sermon. So bad. NBA player jumped out the window. Yeah. He's a European gdo. His name is, Is he alive? No, no, no. He, he, it worked. Oh, okay. I'm Sorry to hear that. Yeah. His name is Janice Timma. Yeah, I saw that he passed. I didn't know that. Yeah, That was how they said it's an apparent suicide, but he jumped out of a, a, a window. I wanted to ask you a question. Sorry. Pertain to NBA. How, how so rest in peace to him and his, you know, condolences to his family.


How do you feel that the ratings are down in the NBA tremendously? Jonah, how do you feel as an avid sports watcher? Like ratings are down N Bs looking like a shit hole. They should put better product, better product out. And that's how I feel about it. I think these stories are coming out faster than I'm used to. Like even if the ratings are all the way down, it seems like there's intent with that story being released the way that It is. Maybe while they're negotiating for streaming rights or whatever's going on. I don't know. It's above my pay grade, but it hasn't been the best product. Even me as a, as an avid watcher of NBA games, I ain't watched as many as I normally watch. It's, It's, it's almost unwatchable.


It's almost un the Golden State Warriors played the Mavericks. I was watching the game. The Mavericks lost What? No, I'm sorry. Golden State lost, but they shot 50% from three. They set an NBA record for most three points. Pointers made in the game. Two, the two teams combined. But it was unwatchable because it's just, it's just a bunch of three pointers and dunks and it's, there's no mid-range basketball. There's not a lot of moving the ball. It's, it's, it's, it's like, it's like playing a video game. Yeah. The NBA seems to be going through what, what we went through in music where you just lose the fabric of what you were at one point and you have to deal with the evolution right. Of it. I don't want to see team just run up and down and shoot 53 pointers sports. No, that's not, that ain't it. I understand that part.


But when you said there's no mid Midrange midrange Play, what you talking about? Like as far as defense Field Phil Gs within the, from the dotted line to the three point line midrange inside of the Field. Not Got it. Just three pointers, but other jump shots. 1520 footers. Carmelo Anthony. Got it. Okay. Bernard King Got it. DeMar de Rosen. Right. Got it, Got it. And the reason It is not just the shot, it's the fact that the kind of basketball you have to play to get those shots are different. You gotta set more screens. You gotta move, you gotta roll, you gotta bury, you got, you gotta do a lot of basketball stuff that makes the game, the game. It's like, it's like if I'm a baseball fan, I love watching pitchers work counts. I know some people think that's boring, but for me it's like watching the pitcher work. Work the count. I love that too.


Right. That's what makes baseball, baseball. Mm. Basketball to me is about screens. It's about boxing out. It's about moving the ball. It's about moving without the ball. You know, it it all those things that you don't see if you can shoot a three and then run up the court and shoot another three. And even rebounding people don't rebound anymore in basketball. Like, I mean the reason all these guards are getting triple doubles is not because there's such great rebounders. It is because big men, nobody's rebounding. Yeah. They just send it every rap to court and then Yeah, Russell Westbrook can get 15 rebounds. And I mean a part of me does feel like It is good for the NBA good for y'all. There was that, there was a period, I don't know if that period is over. There was a period where every non-American player was being promoted as if they were gonna carry the torch.


Yep. Post kd LeBron and stuff. Yeah. You said that before Joe, the Joker Greek Freak Luca. There's a ton of them. So now what exactly, now what? That, that didn't seem to pan out the way you thought. Who you gonna go to now? Women yna. Even though I think he'll, he'll stay up. Yeah. He'll stay up. But everybody's not that. You're gonna have to find somebody somewhere to be the face of this thing. Yeah. It might be an, I mean, you know, it's, it's interesting as to, to look, I mean, Minnesota's not the right market, You know what I mean? But to find a young American athletic player that can play, I think is going to be it. You also need more rivalry.


We need rivalries again. Player rivalries and team rivalries. Yeah. Yeah. Soft, Soft. Yeah. Do they, do they take away some of the, the rules they implemented? Do you think that that will work? Like temp, you know, some of the penalties and all that stuff? I think they're tinkering. They did the n season tournament. I think that's tinkering the play, which was tremendous. I think they're tinkering. I do think Adam s Silver's brilliant. I think he'll figure it out at some point. Just not right this second. Got You. Is a tinker of the Game though. This is a transition, this is a, a transition year for for Are you, are you gonna put respect on bro name because he had 30 at, at LA Fitness? No, because, no, because he sold, sold 50 million in jerseys. Yeah. I, I have nothing but respect for bro James, bro.


Except for this. I appreciate the contribution of every member of the, and I appreciate the contribution of every member of the Lakers franchise, including the G League. My issue is not Brian, you know, my issue is always like they put Brian in an impossible position. You said that. That's all It is. I I, I don't have a issue with Brian. Bro knows how to play basketball. I don't think he's an NBA talent right now. And I don't, and I think they're stunning his growth by making him do this. I'm watching him develop in the G League and that's where he belongs. But the, the G league development he had would've been even better in college. I just don't think you, he's never been the best player on any team he's ever been on. Which is weird to be a NBA draft pick. I just wanted him to develop more. But I'm happy he had 30 the other night. I watched that game.


I watched how he played. I watched how he moved out the ball. He's starting to figure it out. He's figuring out how to move downhill. He's doing all the things that I want. He's already an elite defender. I love watching him play basketball. Got you. I just don't think he's, I don't think he's a pro. I wanna ban him from ever talking about Bronny James. Okay. I don't wanna talk. It's nothing but respect For em. It's not, except for it's not. It's been nothing but disrespect. With all due respect. Are we done with sports? Unless there's more sports. No, I don't wanna step on anything. No, No, no. Don't I just Want, I want everybody to be loose. I haven't heard enough Mel. No, I, I heard enough Mel. This episode.

But That is, it's some real Joe real shit to have to deal with. Right. Like, all right, let, let's get to the bottom of sleepwalking now. And how do you rectify this? Do you put a lock? Do you put a lock, lock yourself in? Gotta be childproof in. Yeah. For you? Yeah, basically. Honestly like I've never had to, even, even when I slept, walk in the Ian's fucking bed, didn didn't leave saying, well how do I fix that? Right. No, I understand. You said Yeah. Collar with the, Oh Shit.


No boy. A doll collar. That's that's what you think is damn. I just think that's some wild shit to have to, But yeah, such is life. Life is gone life. Like I said, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty resilient.

I, I feel like every time, God, every time God is about to put me through like some life changing shit, he throw a little test my way. And how do you go about that?


Like you say you ready for the position that you say you ready for and to be in that handle this one and, and let's see 'cause this could go right or left. So I feel like this is one of those, like this is some shit to deal with before God preps me for whatever that next step and next level is. So that's how I look at it. I'm pretty positive. That's good perspective. Pretty positive. My perspective. Yeah. I'm not so negative all the time now we Wish we would've heard that from you on the phone, nigga. Fuck that. Nigga's all worried nigga. Fuck you man. Well listen, I thought I was coming back to tell a long, big story and all that, but it ain't about me. It ain't about me. I'm glad y'all held it down. Gave me some time to go do what I needed to do on the side.


See a bunch of doctors and shit. That's good. I'm happy. Other than that, I'm, I'm cool. I'm cool man. You fucking sleepwalk. Sleepwalk. It's a thing. It's a thing. It is. It is. I looked it up. Hopefully none of y'all don't sleepwalk somewhere. You ain't supposed to go. No. Pop's Pop's. Not you and Pop spoke. Yeah. Okay. He cool. He not mad at you though, is he? No. Okay. No, he ain't mad at me. You said him and mom was going at it for her and I probably put in the morning Shocker to my parents to have to learn that your kid sleepwalk sometimes I could see how that would be a thing that would terrify me. Yeah. For them. That Would, that would scare the Hell out of me. Do you know when the first instance of you doing it was? Good question. Man, Kid, Kid.


No, for me the first time was that Ian story in Miami. Oh. But that might've been the first time that there was a witness there to tell me. 'cause if he's not there to tell me, I wouldn't even believe that. Wow. Do you find, okay, I was gonna ask do you find your way back to your bed? So no. So okay. No. Well I feel like that would be, That would be a giveaway. Yeah. So then you, that probably was the first time. Yeah, but The but the but the, the human mind is tricky. Right? Like the morning that that that I slept walk, I did wake up on my couch naked and when I woke up on a couch that I don't normally go to. Mm. So when I woke up I was like hmm. Odd but maybe long night maybe. Right? You think just maybe a long night.


I didn't think I slept, walked somewhere and ended up on the couch. Like that's not, nah. Right. But if you ended up like on the lawn and on the porch, you'd be like, nah, that's different right now. Now that's different. And that's a crime. And that's a crime. Which is Got You. So, which is Dangerous. Yeah. And you black in America so you don't wanna give people reason to shoot you. Right. That's A fact. You don't wanna give people reason to say that you are a threat or some type of predator or any paint you any way that you are not. So they could be justified and You know what I mean? Doing what they already wanna do. Yeah. Like I feel, I do feel like there's some people that's trying to George Zimmer in me.


Mm. Like I do feel like that. But we have examples of that being the case for black people in this country sometimes. So you see certain traps if you're lucky. It's unfortunate. Yeah.
