Very unfortunate. 54 years old. Irv Gotti. Way too young. Way, way too young. Yeah, too Young. Really Young. Just really young. They say Irv was having multiple strokes. I'm not part of the intimate close family, so I don't know the details. But It is one, stroke is enough. One stroke is enough. And if you having them for a little bit. And I know Irv had diabetes. Okay. Just sad news. Just sad news. It is even last fall when I was saying let's pray for Irv. Pray for Irv. You know you hoping that stuff is not true And it just doesn't feel real.

And I just, I was like, I couldn't believe he was real, you know? 'cause he was just so like effer and just bouncing off the walls and stuff like that. I was like okay. But you know, friend, friend for like the last 24 years, like this is a huge loss. Same. Nah. You know what it starts to seem like? Mm, none of the black greats. 'cause Irv is a black great Are making it to 60 Are making it to a certain age. Like when you see the white greats like Johnny Carson and all, you know what I'm saying? They start to be old as hell.


You be like, damn, ain't been around since I was a kid. Yo art, it seems like ours be getting to like early fifties and that'd be it. What do you think that is?

But it, it just, that's what it seems like. Maybe I could be wrong 'cause Denzel and them are still here, but our greats aren't staying around, especially in entertainment. That's what it seems like.

I respect it, I understand it that you but I look at it from two different perspectives. Too many of us take that stance. Yeah. Too many of us take the stance of I just wanna live.

I don't remember what happened but it was all I wore and I saw the last season when on Starbucks and McDonald's sponsored. It wasn't even the last season. You lying. It was the season before the last. No, I, I saw the last season. I'm saying and come on. No romance, don't romance. Just let me rock. You got it bro. What do y'all wanna talk about? All right. Y'all want to get into college album release with the video saying I got two new Drake songs.


Drake commenting underneath. Must be Drake Bell Khaled deleting the video. I Love it. Love it. Say that that I I I was clapping my ass off. That shit was funny as hell. My nigga you try to roll your shit out on another nigga and another nigga step up. That's crazy. That's crazy. Good for your ass. Why would he say that? Who? Khaled. If it wasn't true? No, it probably, probably true. He's been saying this Yo, back when Drake did the last tour, he was, you know when Drake had different people walking them out, Khaled walked him out and was holding up the signs saying I got two Drake songs on the next album. Like that's been his whole rollout is I got two Drake songs. I got two Drake songs.


Clear 'em all right my nigga you I might have did two songs you saw what the fuck I went through. And you ain't said a word. Mm You Don't have two Drake nothings. Mm. So Palestine went, Drake ain't say a word. Talking about what? Drake, I'm just didn Didn't say the word about nothing. Good point. Nope ain't been quiet. I absolutely love this. I Love it. I love, I was clapping. I love the get not that the era of relationships is over 'cause I don't believe that. I just hate nigga I got a thing. It's a pet peeve of mine. Niggas can't stand on their own. Well it's hard to stand your own Khaled if you don't Rappers say My thing is, yo, I think, I think K did stand on his own.


I think that if you making genuine relationships with people and they fuck with you genuinely true, then that's standing on your own. It's a value in that. I disagree with that. I think it's a value in maintaining relationships if they're sincere and genuine. It's a value in that. That has nothing to do with what I'm saying though. I'm, I'm no, I'm Just saying I'm not mad at nobody maintaining relationships. Maintaining a relationship. Maintaining the transactional relationship because it's transactional. It Is not necessarily genuine and sincere. It is what I'm talking. So that's what I was saying. So Khaled get out there with, hey I got two drinks, I got two drinks. I don got two drinks on for years, for years now. So Yeah. And Khaled's on Epic Future's on Epic. Hell no you not getting a fucking Drake slap.


You're not getting a Drake Nons. Slapp. You're not getting Drake. Nothing. And that's the label that was responsible for all that. Like that bullshit. Hell no you ain't eating off me. I thought when he made the announcement that it was a little weird 'cause that's not the energy I was getting from Drake is that he popping back out to help be cameo man. Help nobody, it didn't, nothing felt like that. And even if you was gonna do that, you wouldn't do it right now. You wouldn't have Khaled pop out right now at all and be your Hey I got two Drake songs and nah Hell, I'm dropping an album next week. Yeah, no That's a good point. See that's where it, and that's where the corny shit come into play for me. 'cause it's like I un hey if I have a relationship with both of y'all, I'm talking about Khaled.


Let's, let's just say because he's had Kendrick featured on this project. Not saying they friends, but if I'm trying to keep my relationships good with everybody, cool. I'm gonna shut up. Not say a word. You know some people have that. You have to pick a side. Don't now come out and, and Drake me to death because you need me. Khaled's been ice cold. So now you figure okay Drake's dropping it. It seems like the the the beef is pretty much over after this weekend. We, we, we could kind of guess now I want to Drake you to death to roll, to roll your project out. No. Fuck that. No you don't get to use my name for that. At least not And conversation And Drake.


Drake is on his yo. Everybody that chose, I remember I'm it's up for all you niggas. I remember. Yeah Khaled, it's up for you too my nigga. Even if it ain't for that move, it's up for you. It might not be up for him but I I get It is up Drake. Drake is a Scorpio. Yes It is Up. And Drake looks at silence as complicity. Yes. You didn't come out riding for me. Pause. It's up. I'm not speak. Listen you just, you just said Scorpio, I am a Scorpio so I'm speaking from the standpoint of Scorpio Silence and the silence part of Complicity. Yeah a Scorpio can look at silence as complicity. I'm not saying that's what he does. I'm saying that that is the way he could be looking At things. Why are you point At me Compliance If you don't speak out that's defiant.


Looking at co. Yeah, all that. I like what Drake likes that I dog don't make me say it like anyway. To me it's nasty. It's Real nasty. I like what Drake like whatever Drake says It is what I say. Whatever he thinks It is cool. I think It is cool nigga no move now and don't put me on no project. Well I don't know who won the rest of the project. All I said we all gonna be there else up there. Who all Gonna there? I said that when we were just discussing it on the last episode. Like yo who? I don't know who else gonna be on here And if I got something I can do with the slap, I ain't hand it to you there. I need all my slaps. Right. I'm Not hand nothing. None of you probably already did the two songs. No we know that part but Still gotta clear it.

When this Call album dropping, We don't know now. Now we don't. Yeah, We know before You took the video back But why would you put out a a do you get people talking?


Yeah, like dog. Think about this. Why would I wanna put out a single, if I got two Drake singles in a tuck, I'm gonna basically make money off of all this turmoil that's been going on since May. I want to hear what Drake got to say. So now I put my Drake single out or I promote my Drake single. You guaranteed to get at least a shit ton of spins coming out the gate. No, Absolutely not.

You know the party album coming he said and soon after that I have a one-on-one. We gonna have a one-on-one conversation. I Love it though. I just love saying it. Oh please. I love saying it. Letting people don't say it. No say it. Don't say it, Say it, say it. Why? Just to let it be known that I'm not like he, the moves are showing that I ain't really trying to be feature man. I'm not really trying now It is time for me. Focus yourself. Yeah bro. The, the sentiment is fuck all of y'all nigga bro. Fuck all of y'all. Y'all niggas that made money off me, we made money together. Whatever. I don't wanna say they made it off him, but fuck y'all.


I see who spoke up. I see Who didn't, don't ask me for shit. I ain't giving you shit. You know your mother be like, when we walk in this store, don't ask for shit. You want giving shit. That's how you want it. Black moms. Yes. Black moms don't shit. What white Mom say? Billy? Yo. Don't touch that. Bob Billy Thin Ice Buddy. Mr. Mr. Yo. I I I'm, I'm not mad at you. I'm not mad at all. Nigga said must be we gotta do, man. That's funny son. Focus on yourself and that nigga's petty. That nigga's petty son and normally Yeah, I know me. Normally I would think this would be some form of rollout. Nah, in this instance. Nah, nah. This is not at all.


Not at all. Not at all. Why is he on this Australian tour To get away as far away from here as Possible. This, this is Good. Okay. Now can I get a more educated answer? Personally, I think this away I this I think nah, to keep myself implemented Mental. Yeah Bro. Okay, nevermind. I'll ask this in a different room. No, I'm just saying you always give, tell us what you think. What do you think? Why do You think You think it? I don't know, but I'd like to have a conversation with why would somebody, people that are down to do that, why more so than, oh he wanted to get away. Why would Somebody I didn say you wanna get away? I said I think that nigga's mentals is fucked up. I'm gonna go over here as far from the United States as I possibly can to get my shit dog.


They, that nigga couldn't walk. So you feeling the love again, you feeling the fandom, you feeling all of that? Whereas at home they looking at you like you a Benedict Arnold, sucker ass nigga, I'm gonna go over there where I'm still getting love at to get my mentals. Right. Not just that, look, he doing a, he doing a, a stretch of shows over there. Right. Anywhere he go today in the United States, they going, his dad was walking down the street and started chanting not like us. That's fact. The trolling shit is big here. Niggas gonna want to do that. So now let me escape that one. And everything is optics. If you look at the videos that's been coming off of this show them shit go crazy. The crowd going crazy. Complete sellout. They standing up on, they going nuts.


Couldn walk Couldn. Hey shit, if we're putting credence into the the leaked text, text message, shit, you still got some obligations. Yeah, Obligations. Yeah. I'm gonna say That. Let me double down. Let me get some money. Let me get my obligations outta the way. Lemme get the fuck outta, He gotta job. Not just that. Yo, when I, if I'm going to a place that I haven't been in damn near a decade, the reception going to be a different over there. Crazy. As opposed to if he go do LA right now, or not la but he gonna do Atlanta. He gonna do Houston. He gonna do any of these places in the United States. He ain't gonna get the same reception. I think It is. Granted the fans gonna show up but it's gonna be trolling involved. That's what I'm saying. I think it's the fulfilled obligations. And once he fulfill it, why are you fulfilling it to make it look a certain way? Two girl you fulfilling it and you can kill two birds of one song.


The people, the people still love me, you know what I mean? Now At what point do we get to see Drake move like Adele Never. Never. I think they demos that 400, that 400 mil Joe came bro. Demos is different. Came with some with Flip. Yeah that 400 mil came with some, some working with that. Some work that you had to do to pay it back. Not just that they demos is different bro. No, it's not about demos. Like some, some of the people when they like he wanted to stay consistent. He wanted to bigger a bag. A lot of those people when they hit their peak or hit a certain, they take a step, they take a step back. Look what, take care of their health, look at their family. It's just not all, You know what I mean? By the way, the devil conversation, the Most friend Bro white pop artists can White pop artists for a couple years and a hip hop artist.


Yeah. Like it's totally different bro. Yeah, but look, Adele drop 2008 2011. 2015. 2021. You see the gaps between projects? Yeah. Drake never gave that. He never gave, he can't, It is something he be consistent. It's not a demo from the minute he dropped. Drake has been dropping a nigga. If Drake went away for six years, There's not many hip hop artists, especially at that level that can go away for six years. Yeah. Four years. Three Years. Why not? I don't know. Hip hop moves too fast. Hip fast. Hiphop is what have You. Right. What'd You say? Hip hop is what have you done? Me? You disagree? Yes. Yeah. And it also changes. I think y'all are doing some typecast shit. I I think that like granted It is not traditional to See that. That's A better way of wording I guess.


Sure. When you've never the biggest thing since the Beatle, how many of them is left? Two. Two Are Beatles. Alright. When you're the biggest thing since the Beatles, I don't think that nigga want to be in no damn Australia. I can't have these dogs with nobody. And You do not want to be in Australia. I don't give a fuck what he's making. My two questions to y'all. How much y'all think Drake is making a year? Enough of this fucking bullshit. Y How much y'all think he's making a year? And how much of that do y'all think he's making? You mean how much revenue versus income got you take home? I I think he sees nine figures take home.


Okay. You Don't I'm done. I don't have nothing more to say on top Of No you Don opened up a conversation But I don't wanna, I don't, I didn't want to. I didn't want to open up. I just want to hear y'all thoughts on those two s that, but You know something or you I don't Know anything. It just looks funny. Its to look funny. I ain't gonna talk about it but it looks funny. It looks funny. Something's funny. Something's funny. That's all I got. I don't know what It is above my pay grade. Something's funny. That nigga looks sad and depressed Still. I think he Is. Yeah. I think if he had his choice he would not be in Australia. And I keep saying, but he's there for all reasons. When you get to 40 years old, you've accomplished everything you can accomplish in your respective field and now you gotta go home to a big ass empty house or houses where you only fucking fly by night.

Wait a little while. So who has the tweets? I'm a little under the weather so I don't want to, I don't want to read. Okay. What we got big man. I've Got a lot of them. So lets Go Big Mel. Actually, he talks about antisemitism. He says, I don't even know what the fuck antisemitic means.


It's just some bullshit Jewish people made up to protect their bullshit. Was was that the right there? I I, I don know what that means, but I Just, whatever. It's 500 tweets we gotta get to. So yeah. Okay. All right. So lemme go. All right. All these celebrity niggas and bitches is pussy. Y'all will watch our brother Rott and never say shit at Right real Donald Trump, please free my brother Puff. Fuck all that woke shit. Niggas addicted to complaining. Do something. We all watched them try to cancel Chris Brown and ain't nobody do nothing. I was pussy then too. Chris Brown. It's till the wheels fall off. Slavery was a choice. Alright, let's pause right there.


Let's pause right there for a second. Okay. What do we think about Kanye with the whole free puff? He's also now selling Sean John. Yeah. Yeezy shirt collab and Yeezy shirts. I didn't see Yeezy nowhere. The shirts still just say Sean John, but just Say Sean John. Yep. He's selling the merch. He's saying we watching what they doing to, to our brother. It is fucked up and I'm not pussy no more. Let's let him out, free him, yada yada yada. Puff retweeted it or posted it on Instagram. Left the comments on this time. How are we feeling about all of the puff stuff and it don't need the biggest deep dive Kanye might have information won't have because I do think that, and I'm not keeping for Puff, but I do think that it's funny that right after he dissed Diageo and dissed the quote unquote establishment that this shit storm came.


And we See that oftentimes that when somebody come out against the powers that be, now all of a sudden your life is upside down. And in turmoil. Eddie did tweet fuck Diageo too. He did do that several times. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's validity to that. But there's Also, and I also think niggas be wrong. True. Yeah. Like for me, both things are are true here. Could be on the table. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that. We did see a whole video. So again, I think that they've spoken, 'cause Kanye was the nigga that told Puff, get the fuck out my fed when, remember when Puff, He called him a Fed When, when Puff tried to calm him down and all that. He's like, nigga, you, you working for them? You scared of them? I ain't scared of them. Get your fed ass outta here. So now Puff might be on the side of where Kanye's, Let me just jump in.


Rant Was That wasn't Puff trying to calm him down. It would just, it just red like that. Gotcha. All that. Yo, me, me my brother. Yeah. Yeah. Your location right now. So we could talk to each other. And that's not what that was. It could have been, it could have been Yo chill out my nigga, you bugging. Oh no, that's, No, it was Where you at? Where you at right now? I'm on my way. Drop the low. My plane is coming to wherever you are right now so we can talk face to face that that wasn't a heal the world moment. Got it. But you get what I'm saying. And what's gonna happen to y'all if y'all walk down the street in the Sean John shirt right now, Is it fire? No. The same shirt. They basic. Just a plain tee. It is just the Sean John, The same Shirt, white, red, black.


Ain't nothing gonna happen. That's it. None, ain't nothing gonna happen. Do you think he's standing on Puff's side just to be controversial? In my opinion, yes. I think all of these tweets were to just, like I said, we we, we do this. Well, he does this every time he has something to sell. Unfortunately, whether he believes it or not, I, I'm not speaking to that. But when, when it's time for him to get into promo bag, promo mode, he decides to let me say the wildest shit possible to get the attention, to get the, the coverage to get everybody talking about me. And it works.


Maybe he really feels this way. He might, as I said, I'm not speaking to what he feels. I'm just speaking of the timing, when the puff stuff happened and when it's happening. No one, nobody said anything. Everybody's quiet. So maybe he knows something. And we already feel that Puff is keeping a lot of secrets. So let's see, let's see. I mean, it's good to see, not capable for Puff, but, and Kanye will be the wrong person. But to see somebody speaking up for Puff, let's see where it goes. He may be the wrong person to speak at this time, but I, I just wanna see where it goes. I think anybody speaking up for Puff until more information is released will look a certain way.


Right now. Right now, all the information that's out is damning. Do you think it's possible that all those people that's coming out now, Joe, come on. Like a lot of us at home, when we see more and more people coming out by the hundreds, some of us are saying, all right, you lying. You might be lying. Like Can I, can I ask you a question? Sure. Real question. Do you think that the video that we saw with Cassie, do you think that that was an isolated incident? Or do you think that that was a repeated incident and that is just the latter? Who He was? The latter. The latter. Okay. That was, that was my only question. But I Can I, can I go? Yeah. And no Cape or anything. He's not on trial for that video though. No, I, no, I understand.


I understand. We're just, we're We're, I'm just speaking on what he's on trial trial for on trial. For trial trial. I, and it'll come out in trial I guess, but I haven't seen anything that shows that I understand. So the only reason why It is trafficking. Yeah. The only reason why I was mentioning that is because that was written in Cassie's lawsuit. Okay. And so before anybody saw the video, everybody had doubt. A lot of people expressed doubts. Yes. He was, he doubled down and he was just like, yo, fuck this shit and fuck her. I'm not paying. And then the video came out and everybody was like, oh, so doesn't it lend to, I don't know, just a simple 1, 2, 3 kind of thing that whatever she did put in the, in her lawsuit, more of that could actually be true, which leads to what he is charged with.


Could could it could, yes Ma'am. Everything that she's alleging, And like I said originally when we covered that, I believe everything she said in that initial lawsuit to have been to be the truth. Yeah. I'm just saying from a court of law perspective, what he's charged with. Yeah. We just don't know. Yeah, no. And so there's a lot of people and timing always mattered like It is said in these situations. Yeah. So a lot of people are looking at it like, Hey dog, until he spoke out about this, he was fine. Or until he bucked the the establishment, he was fine. So people are questioning just sometimes the timing relevance. I totally get that. Yeah, I totally get that. But like Joe said, like two things can be true at the exact same time.


I, I'm a thousand percent with y'all. Like I said, I think he did it. Mel, how will you feel and what will you think in the event that Donald Trump pardons puff? Because ye is on the timeline calling for Donald Trump to jump in and do something. We do know that Puff and Trump have relationship, some sort of relationship with all of the damning evidence and the stories puffing Trump rumor that we heard puffing Trump puff. I didn. I didn't know that. I didn Yeah, they got a relationship. Okay. Yeah. So fuck Donald Trump is New York. True. I'm just saying, what will it look like if he's pardoned? Because I know that everybody has their moral compass out. But the president of the United States is a wacky, wacky grab the pussy.


Fuck. Bitches get my, like he's on bullshit. So yeah, some of this is whatever you believe in terms of puff, there's some people on the side of, we don't know if you have him dead to right yet. Yeah. He could very well walk outta there. And it's possible then what? Yeah. I mean, but that's what, that's what the whole, you know, justice system is about. Is you've been charged with a crime, you have your day in court, the process plays out and then the jury decides like that's what it's supposed to be about. And before we talk about like how the system treats black men, I, I'm just taking that off the table. I'm just answering Joe's question. So if Donald Trump comes along and just pardons him, I think, I think that that would be very on brand for Donald Trump to do.


And I think that that would be, I think that would be wildly disappointing. Especially, especially if the jury does find that the prosecution offered, you know, a believable case and they, you know, they vote to convict. I think that the, I think that a lot of people will just lose a lot. They've already lost a lot of faith in the justice system. In the justice system. But I think that that would allow, that would, that would make people feel like there's just no, there's just no actual hope. And especially as it relates to his behavior towards women and the accusations that have been made against him in terms of like all the, the numerous sexual assaults, 2% of like, you know, people who commit sexual assaults or, you know, our word are convicted of these crimes.


Like women are just so used to these crimes. Just going, just feeling like you can't report it. Or when you do report it, you know, you're, you're abused and you're victimized even more by like the victim blaming and the victim shaming and stuff like that. And then the perpetrator gets away. Like, it just, it just kind of erodes your soul, I guess. You know, I didn See that. That's just, that's just how me, and I'm pretty sure a significant amount of the PO population would look at that. If that is exact. If that's what happens. That's a great, great way to close us on that. Let's get to more yay tweets. All right. Let see here. What y'all gonna, oh, sorry. Hold on. What y'all gonna do? Cancel my sneaker deal.


Cancel my record deal. Freeze my accounts. Fuck all y'all niggas. Slavery is a choice. I'm speaking my mind now. I ain't ed editing shit ever again. Fuck Diageo. All you. Please come at me. That's how we spot the Koons. Let these white people and Jewish people tell you what to do and say fuck Diageo and fuck all y'all niggas in advance. I don't understand him working closely with Jewish people and romanticizing Hitler. It's Weird. He said to, he said, well, he said, he goes, he goes on the set that I work with him, but I don't trust a single one of 'em. Yeah, I'm gonna get to That. You could say that and feel that and still not romanticize Hitler. I think that part is wrong. Unless he wants to Yeah.


Romanticize the Hitler's role. It's crazy. It's Disgusting. That's absolutely not. Oh yeah. It's disgusting. So Michael Rappaport tweeted something in the middle of all this. Some people are responding. So he said, you're obsessed with the Jewish people. Guess it's easier than actually looking at yourself in the mirror. You, your collapse is your fault. Cap lock. And his response was, be clear, you Jewish niggas don't run me no more. This is a free country and this is my free opinion. You abort black children for stem cells. Abortion is murder and it's pushed onto the black and Latino communities. Let's see anybody who works for me that don't agree, fuck you, quit you most likely charging too much anyway.


Gotta charge a lot. If you gotta put up with this kind of tweets, We are all being used by, used by the system. Every tweet I make promotes Elon's platform and the most lit person that ever been on Twitter, Shopify is not my platform. I'm the one man army because no other celebrity or non celebrity got the power to do shit. And they wouldn't, even if they did, I'm above any other celebrity that's ever existed. I look down on them and they look up at me, know that. And I want y'all to all know that I am the fucking top nigga in history. No nigga in history has ever spoke their mind and lived. So why the fuck would I stop now? Thoughts?


I got a deeper, I have a way deeper assessment. What's here? Yeah. We gonna hear this week. 'cause we over the weekend, 'cause this gonna drop, we gonna hear all of this anti Kanye shit. He's standing next to Elon Musk. That's the only person he's following on his Twitter account. That's all that shit. Two weeks ago Elon Musk did the high Hitler and nobody said a fucking word bro. Very, there was very, very little outcome. He did the shit at the presidential inauguration. Kanye West is in line with him. Kanye yes. Is, is clearly fucking with Donald Trump. He said something about the hail Hitler shit in one of these tweet rants.


He said he he bit my shit or something like that. Yeah. He said, yo, my name is Yay Hitler. Yeah, yeah. No, it Wasdo hit off Yado. Hitler. Hitler, Hitler. It is so fresh. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So we gonna sit here and rightfully so condemn Kanye, but niggas turned a blind eye in deaf ear to win. Elon Musk, based on his status, did pretty much a disrespectful act toward the, he got a lot of blow back for that. No, he didn't. I I saw blowback. He got, I saw, yeah, I saw Not, not nearly as, not as, he shoulda Had what he should have. He's not gonna get as much as Kanye. That nigga did that shit at the presidential inauguration. Hold on. And the other part is there were like, if you, you, you, if anybody were to complain about it, you know, on his platform or fuck his platform, I'm, his platform is not the only place for people to complain.


Like, you get what I'm saying? Like nationally, I want to see the same vitriol given to him that we about to see for Kanye for the whole weekend. We gonna see it. We going, this just happened, so we have a minute to see it the whole weekend. We gonna hear anti Kanye shit again. Rightfully so. But we can't pick and choose when one motherfucker is on some bullshit. I seen people in the Jewish community defend that shit that Elon Musk did See. That I saw, saw too. They defended that shit. Saw my nigga, that shit. I did see a Lot Dis disrespectful my nigga. I wanna ask a question. Where'd y'all See that at? Everywhere. I'm just saying where everywhere. A lot of media outlets whitewashed what he did, like week, They defended that shit Week. Like really quote unquote high profile.


Because I'm gonna tell you what I saw a lot, I saw a lot of, I did see people defending it. Yeah. Via tweets. Like I saw New press pages. Yeah. Commenting on it. The Anti-Defamation League tweeted about it. You know, I saw it all there. What I'm saying is a lot of the outrage you might not get to see because he own the shit. Yeah. In of don't channel seven. He don't own Channel five, he don't own all the major networks in the world, bro. They started coming out defending him saying, well, you know, he has Asperger's, they were defending him, my nigga. So that's all I'm saying.


Like, It is all nasty. And again, Kanye West is standing right next to the two motherfuckers that are putting on the show with him. So I want him to get the, the venom that he deserves, but I also want the other two motherfuckers to get the venom that they rightly deserve as well. But it's hard when they control it. No, it's not. A mouth is a mouth, bro. Listen, not just that, but not just that. Speaking of what he's saying, that's speaking of what he's saying. Yo, if you going see injustice over here and you going to talk about the injustice, but then when this nigga over here do it, you shut the fuck up. He saying, y'all controlling these niggas and y'all won't, won't speak up against what's going on Doing the same thing. Don't prove the point.


I agree with everything you said. You get what I'm saying? I, I made that exact point this morning in, in talking to some people. But we, they about to drag Kanye for sure. He's gonna get dragged rightfully so. That shit he asking for it, that shit that Elon did, eh, he say he asking for it. That shit Elon did was him asking for it. But because he's one of the wealthiest men in the world, they didn't Give it to him. And more powerful. Yeah. And, and I mean it has much larger implications. Yes. Like Kanye is trying to get some attention rolling out a album, tweeting a bunch of bullshit Bragging about being worth $2 billion. El Musk is rumored to be actually controlling the president of the United States, bro.


It's been a month. He, they are turning the country upside down in less than a month, fam. They got the, they created the Department of Government efficiency, efficiency. He runs it and he runs it. He runs it. He's, he's, he's like a cabinet position. They're bragging that they're bragging about him saving, quote unquote the government $56 million in less than a month. His companies have gotten over a hundred and billion, $150 billion in government aid so far. Niggas still February. Like dog, this is scary. So again, drag Kanye, he deserves to be dragged. But when one of the most powerful motherfuckers in the world gets up on there and does some real disrespectful shit, I want him to get the same exact treatment that Kanye West this black man is getting.


I want that. Like, I don't, it's no excuse for me. And see, I don't equate that, I don't equate that to color. I don't either. I equ it, I equated the power. I me too. A lot of these motherfucker Just motherfuckers Are not trying to be on the wrong side of Elon, but they, we can say whatever the fuck we want Kanye. He don't control no Powers related to color. Sorry. They bullying the shit outta these niggas. Elon Musk and them absolutely are bullying the shit out. All the tech niggas. Everybody, they bullying all of these niggas. They nigga making these niggas kiss the ring. People that have been in line with black agendas and colored agendas and diversity and all of that. McDonald's, my nigga Coca-Cola, have been on a black bus for 20 years. They make them niggas jump off target all of these niggas.


They making them niggas jump off. Like that's, they bullying these niggas and niggas is basically suckers and cowering. So to some of the shit that he's saying, It is like, yo, y'all coward. Y'all won't really say what y'all feel. The Republican party don't really rock with Donald Trump. A lot of them. Sure. They scared to death out this motherfucker. So, So I feel like, sorry Joe, my, my bad. I'm just wanna say Kanye acknowledging why he's going on this ran to me, it just sound like two wrongs True. A thousand percent. Yes, for Sure. Yep. And for it to be two wrongs, You right. Him acknowledging it lets me know that he Identifies It is yes, yes. As being wrong. That's true. Yes. He's aware. So it's like, there's nothing that you can do at this point because everybody, everything is social media.


Once meta put up that wall of censorship, Elon's platform has risen to the top. Yep. He's in control of that. So he can make you see things and take away things. So what I'm saying is that unless people are going outside, and that's my point, rallying and hand on hand promotion and talking on that online shit, It is just gonna get censored turned out. It's gonna get censored. So what's next? You and Ice are saying that 'cause y'all are really, really big in social media, the world is bigger even though social media is spearheading some shit. Got you. I'm talking about all of the media outlets. All of the everything. They not saying nothing bro.


Look, nigga don't really, we don't really watch the media. People don't. Well look, well look, look, do you know, like they, as, as trumpet was all referring to newspaper and shit as legacy media. Like It is almost like the world is moving. It is on shifting, shifting the world For sure. Elon tweets every couple weeks showing app stores in different countries that Twitter is now number one in Germany Yeah. Or above whatever the, the local media is. It is like this social media shit is now ahead of Yeah. Local people are getting they news on the, on the internet. Now to Joe's point, him doing that just speaks to a way bigger thing than fucking Kanye sneaker selling West that's bragging about being worth $2.7 billion.


Elon Musk is worth hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars and his company is growing stronger and stronger and stronger every fucking day. Right. That's a bigger plate here that everybody's just gonna do Moms the word No, but what we saying is with that company being so big and, and, and being bigger than legacy media, that the noise, the outrage isn't gonna be as loud because not many people are looking out, out There anymore. Exactly. And also the problem is, is that you can't even trust legacy media anyways because like look at the Washington Post They on Take that You It is owned by they on Take Jeff Bezos. It's owned by Jeff Bezos. Oh yeah, that's true Too. You know, so there's, that's there's all of these like massive good point, you know, media conglomerates.


They are bought and paid for For they all in it. Yeah. That's a home point. Yeah. They're all homeboy. That's true. Yeah. Let's get to some more tweets. Yeah. All right. I think I might have said this one already, but fuck Virgil. No you didn't. No, you did not. Okay. Sorry. All right, let's stop right there. Which is insane. And this is where for me, he loses why, right. Why you could go on your rant, you can go on your, your soliloquy about all of this shit. This dude that has passed away that Suppo supposedly is loved by everybody that he's been in contact with. You didn't have to do that. And that speaks to me. He don't have to do the romantic signs and Hitler shit.


He don't have to do none of it. I'm, I'm, yo let's say he got his political, let's say he got political agenda. He got political agenda. It's not political. It is, my goal is to offend everybody. So y'all all are talking about me. It's a lot of people up there that don't give a fuck about none of this political shit he's saying. So if I go say fuck Virgil, I'm gonna get them mad. Mm. Rage ba That's the tweet to rage bating. That's, and that's the thing, that's the tweet to get y'all for the people out there who don't know who Virgil is. Gotcha. I'm gonna say this shit over here. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna say this over here. I'm gonna run the gamut. Everybody. Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna leave no box unchecked and pissing y'all off so that y'all all are looking at me. Rage baiting is the most effective way to become viral. More so than talking about sex, relationships, gender, war, anything rage baiting is the number one way.


That's, there's a, there's a, there's like actual studies on it how it fucking with people's getting them emotionally, emotionally charged. Involved, emotionally charged. Yes. There's studies behind this shit and he, he know what the fuck he's doing. So what happens, let's just say hypothetically, 'cause this is what typically happens with him. Niggas boycott him. Right. Let's just say He's literally saying, I don't give a fuck. He and I have gives a fuck more money than gives. He Gives a fuck. Yeah. But boycott him where he ain't in, he ain't got Gap no more. He ain't got Adidas no more. Everything he's doing now is independent. Cool. So where you boycott? Well like, I mean y'all can't stop me no more is what he's saying. That's not true. I mean he got, Yeah, I don't agree with that either. He got Enough money that he don't have to, but he y'all saying that he doing it for a rollout for his project.


I'm just, I just think Kanye's doing it for attention. Oh, I thought y'all said he was rolling out a project. If my Baby ties mom tweeted all of this stuff, I'd be at the courthouse tomorrow and say I never want my kids to see her. Something is, she is, she is. Something is mentally wrong. That's A good point. He lost his damn mind. That's a good point. When he couldn't go to that birthday party. That's good point. He with the bouncy houses. You're Right. That's a good point. You're right. Also, they were showing footage from Grammy night of, and I don't know if it's accurate, but the subtitle said that Kim had to kind of cover the kids' eyes and maneuver a certain way. When Kanye is up there with his naked wife. You turn right around and do all of this shit. I do think that his life could be affected. I'm not talking about his business Financially.


I'm talking about Yeah. Everybody puts everything off Financial shit. Yes. Life and 100% yes. Be affected. And by the way, his financial shit can get affected too. Just 'cause he's independent of record labels and independent of Adidas. That makes it more susceptible to Boycotting boycotting. And, and it's the thing too, And I know it's companies that Kanye wanna do business with, like, I don't know what he's saying on Twitter, there are companies that he wants to do business with dog. It is a lot of motherfuckers out there don't make sense, Which is another way Anytime he do that shit and start dropping, and again the Yeezy brand is still a very powerful brand. Yeah. And then once he start posting shit at $20 as fucked up as It is out here and people See that, it's like, oh I could get me some Yeezy shit for 20 nigga niggas cop.


Yo, I think his brand is Niggas do has taken a fall and it don't have nowhere near the cache that it once had. I'm repping for Jewish people the same way I'm repping for black people. Like for me right is right And Wrongest I wrong. I know too many Jewish people that when you get to talking to 'em, they say, I don't have no grandparents. My great-grandma was, they get to tell they fucking stories. They affected the same way us, we have our plight and we speak about it and we hate for it to be, to be reminded of it or for it to be thrown in our face in modern day society. I think it's all Bullshit trivialized. Yeah, absolutely. And like you game And for you to do that as a black person knowing how it feels.


Well he says slavery's a choice though. You know, I kind of understand him on that though. So I don't kill him for that. I get him a little bit there. I don't agree with him, but I understand. Yeah. I don't have toand agree with him what He's trying to, but I understand his flush it out. Right thought Process. Understand it comes to that. That don't mean let me turn around and fucking kick Another minority's back. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's sick. I think that's sick for whatever your purpose is. It don't make sense. He's brighter than That. And I think he can be affected. He can be affected. I think he thinks he can't. I know that's, that's what he's saying. And guess guess what? We talked about the last pod, certain niggas and they arrogance and feeling like they bigger than the establishment and these niggas will learn you something fam Well he responds to that but, And Kanye, he's an attention seeker.


I know. I mean, cool. Go ahead. So now when you start getting the attention that you once sought, because niggas are saying, yo, you going too far and I'm not fucking with you bro, that would affect him. True. Now also, I think he did go against establishment before they did learn him. And in his mind I made it back. I still back up. So now If if, If I took y'all shots, y'all, y'all y'all got me. Y'all got me and I made it back. Yeah. I'm a hundred times worse than I was before. Announcing I'm super worse because now I feel like I learned some shit. I adapted. I'm not gonna make myself vulnerable to shit. I iron man. Like y'all, y'all, y'all y'all tried to get me? I get it. Y'all, y'all cost me X, Y and z. And I still, the funny thing About the attention seeking this of him is I think at some point it's gonna backfire because eventually people are gonna be like, oh, there goes Kanye again.


It's Kanye again. That's where a lot of us are now. True. Like that's how I was Kanye, yo not for nothing. Kanye's been blocked. I didn't even see half this shit. I saw a blog post And I said, for, for for work purposes. Yeah. Let me go look. Yeah, I go look, I have to click view tweets because Kanye's been blocked and muted for years now. So I go, all right, lemme go see what the fuck he talking about. I'm reading. I'm just like, alright, he got some shit coming. Then I remember he did the, they premiered a record last week sometime. Oh, okay. I see what's going on now. Y'all trying to get this next album out. This is Kanye, Kanye again, bro. Even if your message is very dangerous, it's still to me it's just him being him again.


When it's time to get y'all to buy some shit, bro. I think product sells come with likability. Yeah. I think your product sells come with likability, especially In the artistic world. Sure. And so I think that, And I also think that people really, like, they don't even think about the investment. Like they're not invested in him. They're like, yeah, I don't give a shit what he's fucking saying. I like the fucking shoes. No, I'm gonna buy the shoes. I disagree. No, there there is, there is. You're gonna, you're gonna act like there's nobody who thinks that way. I'm Not acting like anything. I'm saying that I think people bought into Kanye West and his genius and I love him and I like him and I'm a fan of his and I think that whatever he puts out, I'm gonna buy as a result of me being a fan of his, some of them sneakers was ugly as fuck and they grew on us.


The more you started to see people wear 'em, they weren't sneakers that you would just walk in the store and say, oh these shit's hot. I'm gonna pick 'em up. You start seeing everybody wear him. Some niggas hooked him up nice. You like, oh damn, I see what he did and it was, and now let me go by. And it was, they was rare. It was the supply and demand thing too. It was, it was a supply and demand thing where if you had, you couldn't walk in the store again. Somebody Yes Man, culture over commerce. Yeah. And I don I don't know what part of culture this is that he's doing. I don't, I don I don't identify it as, And and culture sees a direct result in commerce when certain niggas be up. Commerce dictates that yo they have a a fan base, a likability. Everybody can't sell product. What do y'all think about?


Fuck Virgil. It's disgusting, Bro. Don't like it's disgusting. It's disgusting. Why would you do that? It is, It is terrible. Ain't saying fuck Virgil, you saying fuck his family. You saying fuck every like dog. Why would you do that? It's no gain in doing that. If a nigga fucks you when he was living, what the fuck I'm gonna say fuck him in death for it's no gain in doing it. And he'd do that and don't ever come out and say what his beef is with Virgil. Right. Because It Is. I I Even if You right ice we talk about we don't No, no, I'm just saying like I, if I'm just trying to offend everybody and I go yeah, fuck him too. The nigga that I know y'all love. See that's not enough. That's Like a nigga come but That's not enough.


It's not Enough. It's not enough. But look who we talking about that's not, I think that there's more there. There's more than me die. But Why? That was your man. He's dead. That an inspiration to you. He's not here. Shit Is Nasty. He has family members that are still here. You still here? I whatever Your problem with him was. It is six feet deep. Well hold on. No because I feel, I feel funny about that because I don't wanna switch. Go ahead. I 50 wrong Too. You could 50. I disagree with that. 50 50. 50 50. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I disagree with that. Niggas tried to kill him. Who tried to kill him? Them tried to kill him. Okay. What does that have to Do? Hold on. I'm gonna tell you if you shot him not they shot him in front of his grandmother's house while his grandma was outside.


Hold on, you ask me a question but go ahead. Okay cool. They tried to kill him. He survived. Not only that, they stood with the guy that claimed to try to kill him or that tried to kill him. So it was up forever. He almost lost his life. Same thing I told Lec. Same thing I told the niggas and they said, yo niggas get shot every day. But that's not true. I survived. You guys tried to kill me. So it's always up and stuck. Do we like it? No, but some people have a reason to say what they say. It's disagree with forever. I disagree with that. I'm not mad at flip saying that. I'm not mad at flip saying that fuck, There is no, there is no record of Irv Gotti trying to kill 57. And That's the point. That's the part I was about to say. The internet just keeps saying that. Maybe 50 said it somewhere.


I don't know. But there is no known record of Irv Gotti trying to kill 50 Cent. There's record of not Irv pervasive. There's no no, no, no. Pervasive. There's record of the incident in the studio. Yes. Irv himself rest in peace has spoken and said yeah he came in here. You know he stabbed him up a little little. They've had more than just that one incident that Irv was not a part of. They've had beef, not rap beef, not they've had real life beef. True. That niggas have tried to harm each other for years. And that is a different level. That's not none of this hip hop shit. Let me ask you a question. Yeah, I'm sorry. I wanna say something Ish and I'm gonna say something else to that too. That in that particular beef that we talking about, who?


I don't know all the backstory. Yeah. Who seemingly was the aggressor in that beef? I don't know. Who was the aggressor? 50. Okay. 50 was aggressor on a rapping scale though. Preem asked 50 to chill. Yo, I'm working with this artist. I know you, they went over there to the hood to speak to fifth yo they went through black child 'cause that they were cool. Yo Chill asked 50 chill, they had the conversation. 50 didn't want to chill for whatever 50 reason is on some hip hop shit, on some rap shit. I'm gonna keep dissing them and then look what it turned into. So now we saying that if I dish you on a because we mixing it up. If I dish you on a record, Always mix it up.


'cause hip hop is the new meaning for I need therapy. True. My Thing, Kanye West needs therapy. 50 Cent needs therapy. My thing, I don't care if you agree with the rationale got and 50 50, he gonna stand in it. He gonna stand strong in It is. But You Right, This is, I think it hard and I know you, you specifically or excluded a couple of y'all, but the masses, right? Niggas feel this way. Niggas are saying fifties wrong in this instance because a lot of people love Irv. That's not true's not that is, that is true. I'm gonna, I'm going to tell, let me finish.


A lot of motherfuckers was running around here jokingly when all them Chicago niggas was killing each other and man smoking on this person. It was a joke because you don't know them niggas like that. Alright, I rest in peace. And you could bleep this if you need to, but fuck Tuka was a, a joke in hip hop, but niggas who had no idea who he was. I Hate when y'all Do this. It's the truth, Joe. It's it's the truth. This Happened. It's not the truth. Ice. It's not it's the truth. Let hear it. You talking about Kids, I'm you talking about the worst possible sector of hip Hop and it's this big, let's be clear 'cause I don't know who TKA is. Yeah, no, Nobody listen, listens this big. It is rest in peace to them brothers. Yes. Drill is what? Drill is.


It got the highlight that it, it got yes young knuckleheads that were into their murder game was running around. I'm smoking on such and such. I'm smoking on such and such. That's irrelevant to me. And it wasn't the masses, it wasn't a a that ain't a hip hop thing. It's not, y'all are bugging, but okay. It's not, it's Not a hip Hop thing. It is not. It's a young hip hop thing. Yes It is. My nigga, young niggas don't make up hip hop. I'm damn neither do old niggas hiphop. No, it's not about age thing. And you do that a lot where you try to put the ages. Yo, listen to this. I never met Virgil in my fucking life. Correct. Hip. I don't know Virgil. I don't love Virgil. For somebody to say fuck a nigga that's dead and regardless of his family, I'm want you and how they feel is disgusting.


So It is not based on likability, it's not about Irv Gotti and niggas liking Irv Gotti. If somebody says fuck somebody that's dead, I think that's nasty. I don't gotta know the person. And I said a couple of y'all up here are exempt from what I'm saying. Did I not start with that? You said did. You said that you did. So I'm not holding you to that. I'm not holding you to that and I'm not holding you to that. There are a lot of people who based what's right and wrong based on whether we, this person's not you. That is a fact. That's true. I'm agree with, that's all I'm saying. I I I love fifth, but when I saw that, it made me feel bad seeing that in Irv picture 'cause nigga got family and stuff like that. Right. I'm just saying when the people are questioning his actions, I look at it from both sides of the corner.


And If 50 feel like that the nigga go smoke a cigar in the cigar room. Like I'm not telling him how to feel. Yeah, He could feel like that. Yeah. Feel like that. But publicly saying yo damn, I want him to see my new shows or fucking whatever the fuck is being said. I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong. I think niggas need help. Shit. I what you nigga do need Help. Wait, nigga gotta get to somebody dying. I thought him saying the lil mech, somebody who you acted like you cared about. Somebody who you showed up for was playing the mentor role for now. Whatever's going on with the show or big mech and yada yada yada. What your little nigga kick Rock like to be able to turn so cold.


But why you saying active? Like he's not acting like he's not acting like you can care about somebody. He's turned on his own son. Yeah. No, but no, hold on. You can care about some, you can care about someone and they can do something and you can change your feelings. We just talked about that last Patreon. Exactly. I absolutely did That. You can care about somebody that I cared about and turned my feelings. Now I don't know what little Mech did. This is the confusion part. I don't know what little mech did. I think his father did something to offend 50. I don't know why his son and I asked that last time, what happens to his son now that 50 and the father's going back and forth. You know what I mean? He did. But but you know how fi stands, you know how he, you know how he stands in that? Anybody over there listen to this. If you stand there, it you are there.


I don't wanna call names. Okay. Outta respect the time that 50 had the situation that happened on Summer Jam or whatever, he wasn't talking to his son. But that doesn't mean it's still not his son. Some of these niggas live by certain principles and morals, whether we understand it or not, you know, that's still my son and I feel this way. Right. Wrong or indifferent because when you speak to his son it's like yo, me and my dad at the time wasn't even right talking. And that's an old, it's old. You understand? But some niggas are just stuck in their ways. I do agree with you. I do see what Joe's saying. Like, we need therapy. Absolutely we do. Absolutely. And he doesn't like when we say where we from, where we come from.


But that plays a big part in our life. But that's more the reason why niggas don't, people online. I guess the audience because they're, it just plays a big part of our life and we need to acknowledge that. How do you fix it? You sit down and talk to you, talk to someone and you go past it or try to get past it or try to heal inside. Step one is wanting to heal True. A lot of niggas think that there's nothing wrong with the way I am. This is me. I don't have to change or heal anything. You know, I told, I gotta tell, And I said this, I told Canada like Ty, I said Yo N he said niggas get shot every day. Flip that sentiment. He said that on my show, that sentiment is the same and 50 row under it. See I said yo, he got shot. So I understand why he's going hard to try to take down Murder Inc.


He said, well niggas get shot all the time. Even Ty saying that. You have to think like, why do you think that? Right. Why does, okay, okay. Niggas get shot all the time with niggas sucking up. Ain't nothing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. People where we think where we come from Joe, is It is fucked up. It is warped. Very fucked. How do we get get past it? Very fucked up. Do we have therapists come around and speak to people? How do we get past it? No, That's a proactive thing. I keep talking to niggas where we, we close to 50 talking about where we come from. Man. That's why I'm like this. I don't, that ain't, that ain't me. Everybody's not as privileged as you bro. Everybody, We speaking about people that are as privileged, but Everybody, everybody don't have the same, the same dedication to being healed self.


And you and you still got your, we all got our flaws. Everybody just not saying you, but people got flaws. Niggas just mask it. Well that's true. Niggas mask it. Well you floored out if, if I didn't come up here and learn certain shit, I nigga a lot of shit is masked because how I really feel. I can't say how I feel because it it, it affects the, the bigger picture. That's true. You Right. All right. Well I could speak for me and only me, whoever I have a beef with, tension with some type of problem with that didn't get resolved. When one of us die, it's over for me. Got it. I'm not gonna play moral police with what other people do. I respect that, respect, that shit that Kanye did to me. Terrible is whack.


I think the shit 50 did is whack too. But at It is different. It It is different. It is different. But I personally think it's whack. It's whack it's corny. Yes. I I it's corny. Me, me as well. I think it's whack. I just like, like, like you said, try to see it from both sides. I could understand why he feels that way. And I'm not knocking him for, I can't here feeling the way he do. However you decide to express that. I'm not knocking. I remember Fendi, Fendi had a a a a viral meme that goes around all the time where he posted the picture and said, yes, I what he said what the caption was. I showed up at my biggest hater's funeral just to make sure that fuck nigga was actually dead or something like that.


And they, and they and people tweet this shit all the time. Like some niggas, however fucked up It is, that's on them. I'm cool With the nigga that killed. I'm, I'm, I'm cool with seeing the disconnect of the street niggas. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You right. I, that's why I stay for, y'all got it. Me. I just in in closer for me Joe. I feel like it's easier said than done. I feel like we speak from a, a place of privilege and when we think about how sick society is, like the nigga rest in peace. Our brother chinks, the nigga was at the funeral, nigga that did that went to the funeral. You know what I'm saying? Like you have to be sick and demented to do that when you think about it. But when you go to the hood and talk to niggas every day, they think It is, it's nothing wrong with It is comedy.


It's nothing wrong to that's it's shit. It's fucked up bro. The hood is fucked up. It is. Fuck. Virgil is nuts. I I agree. I agree. Agree. Fuck Virgil is absolutely nuts. I Agree. Mm. It It is different and I'm thinking about it. It's a Poor taste. It very, yeah. He does address his wife at the Grammys. If you wanna hear those tweets. Yeah, Read it. Read it to yourself. Yeah. I'm tired of cutting. No read it but for you 'cause you was on that bullshit with her. Oh my God. He should have been naked if you making No, no it's not. I was like, oh my god. I'm just like, if you wanna make a statement, you could show up naked. I mean that would, that would cause a little kerfuffle. You know what I'm saying? But anyways, I digress.


I have dominion over my wife. This ain't no woke. So I just figured we'd insert some jokes here. I Need a hug. This ain't no woke ass feminist shit. She's with a billionaire. Why would she listen to any of you dumb ass broke bitches. People say the red carpet look was her decision. Yes. I don't make her do nothing she doesn't wanna do, but she definitely wouldn't have been able to do it without my approval. You stupid ass woke pawns. I have no respect or empathy for anyone living because no one living can fuck with me. But I do love some people and I give them favor. Anyone who called my wife's Grammy. Look a stunt is dumb and lame.


Yes you she's been dressing naked for two years now all of a sudden it's a stunt. Every single bitch on the planet. Wish they had her bravery body platform and access to money and a husband that supported their personal expression. There are a lot of things that happen to converge for this moment to happen. Fuck all this woke shit, they putting fat bitches on the runway. Nobody wanna See that shit. It's unhealthy. It promotes obesity. And the wild shit is if, if the fat bitches lose weight then they lose their ex, their their except for Adele. 'cause she actually has another talent then being used as a pawn for political agendas. Then they lose accept.


He meant to say accept. Accept. Yeah. This is your last flurry of tweets that will be discussed on this podcast. Yes. And la here's the last One. I feel like I've said that before. Yeah. But, but this was, I'm not gonna be complicit in whatever the fuck you doing. He Always throw your name in it too, Joe. Thank You. This nigga that worked for me said he was uncomfortable with my wife's Grammy look fired and blocked. This is, it's more people looking for work than there are people giving work. I paid 1.5 million for my Grammy ads this year. Let's see if Fox gimme that money back, you're gonna give me back that money for my opinions then stand on it. I love Hitler now what? Bitches. Okay.

Nigga, he's do, he acts like Trump and yo fam Trump is firing basically any nigga. Nigga, if you don't agree with me, you fired. He's running a dictatorship up there. This ain't no democracy Dog. I just want a tie dollar album. Fuck. I Just want a solo tied dollar sign album.


And I imagine that probably is difficult with all the Atlantic bullshit and him standing next to him giving him all the fuck. I just, Hey, y'all got it bro. Yo, y'all got it? Yeah. That's my take. Y'all have it. Have at it. Have a blast. I gotta protect my spirit and my soul bro. And just not consume all of you angry nigga. You niggas just too angry out there. Y'all angry at niggas that's dead. You could be angry at them. Have had It. You don't gotta tell the world The fuck did Virgil do, Even if he did something.


So what? He can't hear Your fuck you. It's officially over. Yeah. What we talking about? Yeah. Niggas gonna paint Irv to be some type of fucking killer running around looking for 50 with a gun. Man, I don don't knock it off with that shit. What you wanna Do? Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. We just need a minute to That's a lie. Yeah, that was, that was a lie. That's a lot, Joe. Did any of y'all catch, you know, super Bowl is a couple days away. Did any of y'all catch the, the Kendrick Lamar Ebro Nadeska interview? I did. I watched it. It Was, it was, they did about 30, 35 minute interview.


I didn't really get much from it to be honest with you. Yeah. I Thought it was dope. It was well spoken, but it wasn't no hot topics. Groundbreaking. Yeah. What, what were the questions? You Shout out Battle rap. He did. Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. That was fly. He Did. I think you could, you could see it And just talk about competitiveness in rap in general. I liked all that sentiment. Yeah. And he was saying he got back, you know, with with with making GN X he wanted to get back to the type of music that he was that he kind of grew up on. So he was saying he did his introspection with the Mr. Morale album. Which, you know, a lot of people like, it wasn't my favorite, but it was good to see. He was like, yo, I just want hard beats, hard raps. Like that's what I went into it trying to make.


And you know, just hearing his thoughts behind how he, how he does his music and Congrats to Ebro and the desk. I'm really happy that, that they were able to do that interview. Shout to Apple. I understand the, the corporate shit going on. Of course, of course. Watching that I said I probably never wanna see a Kendrick Lamar interview again. Never. I'm done. I'm done. He shouldn't even do interviews if he gonna do that. I don't. That's why you probably don't that that was obligation. He doesn't seem Like he wants to do it. Yeah, that was work. That was, that Was That's part of the deal. Yeah, that that was why you Say that? He didn't. Oh well you, He was conservative. He was corporate. He was corporatized.


He was, he was Kendrick B before the Super Bowl at the Apple event. Oh gotcha. He was, he was an artist at the pre Grammy party before the Grammys. Gotcha. Like I wanna see him talk to glasses flow DJ Head. Yeah. Talk to a nigga. Yeah, talk, talk to some niggas that's gonna   niggas ain't even gotta ask the question yo. Come on, Come On. Yeah. The desk game. Ebro Ebro the og, You know what I mean? They did a very good journalist type of Yeah. Interview. Safe, safe safe. Black interview. I want the unsafe black interview.


But we wouldn't get unsafe black responses because he's too big. I don't even think he would do the unsafe black interview. I was, no he wouldn't. It's over. That's that shit I was about to say. But It is that his, we'll Never hear that again. Is that his brand? I wanna talk to him in a private room buying closed doors. No cameras. Yeah, no cameras. No mic sister combo. Yeah. Well we can get the truth about some things. Yep. We just hit there. Not all of this bullshit, yo man. I mean like us, it was a disc but it was just a fantastic record overall. It was a hidden, I think the community really got together around the sense and the nigga, nigga, you tell the truth nigga, you got it. You got it. He Pissed me off And I said, all right. Yeah, I'm on your ass. That's now all right. You wanna play, let Play.


I just tell the truth. I hated that nigga says oh eight. He was a thorn in my Side. I couldn't Wait for this nigga and I was gonna get rid of him by hooker. Back crook. But Do you think that he said that for if, for the intention of laying the groundwork for it to play at Super Bowl. That shit is, I mean we all, we oh we have the assumption that It is going to play. Everybody has the assumption. But do you feel like that was his way of kind of sugarcoating it for it to be like it's not a disc record. Nah. So yeah, Maybe that's what, that's what he did in GQ Too. No, but I think it was just a corporate thing and I think from what I've seen, I don't, you know, it's not, I just think he might not be that type of nigga. He just might not be the messy nigga. Yo, I'm handle my beef, I'm gonna do what I'm doing, but I ain't gotta come up in the front street and talk about it.

Temple run lives. You get to bring back all your old lies. No for real. The million Men and Mario brother. You get a white girl nigga. Oh shit babe. I gotta go Yo. George Washington Bridge broke man. Yo title flooded. They raised the bridge. I had to wait the, they raised the bridge yo.


Everybody's book. I just got the call. Yo. I gotta run to the G dub real quick. Say yo, they need construction estimate on the Lincoln Tunnel. Nigga if I had a white Michael. You think so? Do you think that? Nah, I'd be getting shit off. This girl is his wife is. She's hip. She's hip. Yo dog. You think so? Been they getting shit off? Nah. You could tell how him, you could tell how he come outside. He don't get shit off. No, he could tell he got it off and now he ain't get it off no more. So that's what It is. I don't think so. He don't get off no more. Boy. Hell y'all don't know my man. That's why he's stressed niggas. Y'all don't know my man. Like I know that's why he going Balls. Mm Romance. He got the Super Bowl while we're here. Briefly. Eagles Superman. Root forward. You got him with it. It Both.


Okay. I'm rooting for a man. I gotta win it. I'm rooting for the Eagles. But it a better team by far. If they don't win, it's 'cause Patrick Mahomes did some Patrick Mahomes shit. They're the rough. But the Eagles are a better team by far. Well you Got winning Ish. I'm betting on Kansas City. Jesus. Same That boy's Black Jesus. Who? Patrick Holmes, Patrick. That nigga do shit that I've never seen anybody do in a football uniform. Yeah, that I'm serious. I think Sayquan is gonna go crazy though. He Might. You don't. Kwan has never played the Chiefs For real Well in his life. Oh shit, I didn't know that. Would you say that Mahomes is better than Tom Brady? Physically just in in whatever capacity physically?


Yes. Come up with like three criteria. Would you rate him higher? You put I think QB list together. Did you put him up there? I don't have to rate 'em. He's on his way to, his stats are higher than Tom Brady's stats At the same point in their career Are his stats are higher than Tom Brady's stats. I I heard a stat Outside of this. This scares me and I don't know if it's true. Fact check yourselves that Pat Mahomes averages 37 points a game against Vic Fangio defenses. Really? Yeah. Alright. I hate to sound like Tom Brady when he played the Giants. Well the opposite of it. Patrick Mahomes will not be scoring 37 points this weekend. I was about to say, if they let him score 37 points, It is gonna be a long day.


No, he will not be scoring 37 points this Weekend. You don't think we What do you think the over hundreds. He He hit 30 once in the season. Yeah. Their offense is not what It ain't it. Yeah. I don't know what he played. And Before I even get to his offense and having to rely on Xavier worthy who has had a great season, the Eagles pass Rush D-line and them white, that white boy safety and that other safety stinker. The Eagles are sick. Jaylin, he's eight with 26 point 27 points a game. He could score 27 boys The Eagle. So right now they got Kansas City as a 1.5 point favorite and the over under for total point scored is 48 and a half.


I points think Fangio wins total when he was with the Broncos who were not very good at the time. I'd take less on that. I I don't, I don't see both teams combined for more than 48. 48 points Because Kansas City Defense is sick. It is. No. What? No, I think it's gonna be in, in my opinion It is gonna be the unsung hero Kareem Hunt. I think he plays a big part in this. I don't know if they're gonna get a run game going against that Eagles D line. Okay. What Fact It's gonna have to be an unsung hero somewhere on the Chiefs or D Hop. 'cause he has not been D hopping. Yeah. Yeah.


Still was good to see him at the Super Bowl press conference. Like he's, he's still, I'm so happy for Sako offensive player of the year. Of Course well deserved should have been a vp but I get it, they don't give those to non quarterbacks. I'm really happy that Josh Allen got MVPI know, I know that's black people 'cause of Lamar Jackson thing. MV three thing they had going on. Really happy for Josh Allen. Me too. Like Lamar, I'm Lamar Odom. Lamar. Lamar got a few already. Yeah. Give this white boy, which is why I think he won it. Yeah. Really It is the Joker Shit. Again, I'm, I'm not a fan of that. Remember that Josh Allen got four more votes than Lamar Jackson. Four more. You're not a fan of what? I'm not a fan when we penalize niggas for greatness.


So if it's like, not that saying that Josh Allen, It is a toss up. Sure. But I don't like the argument that, oh, he got it too many times. So give it to somebody else. These niggas bust they ass in the off season. They work their asses off in the off season. I I'm not the guy that says, yo Tom Brady and them win too much. I think winning too much just speaks to his greatness. Well, I'm a hater. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna keep it a buck. Josh Allen led his team do a better record Too much. No, look. No, he's good. No, I, I said I'm not against that. I said I'm against the sentiment of, yo, this guy won too many times. So give it to somebody else. No, nigga. If I'm deserving of winning it again, give it to me again. Lamar was great. I think that white boy was better with less. Mm.


Yeah, that's a good point. I'm not this year. I'm not mad at that. And listen, when, when I go, when I go home, I say that Joe Burrow should have got it. Yeah, I was gonna say that too. Joe Burrow. I think Joe Burrow had a better season than both of 'em. But you don't make the playoffs. He did one, nine games started. Oh, and four. One in four, something like that. Check it yourself. Yeah. When I go home, when nobody can hear me, I say Joe Burrow. But yeah, go Josh Allen. I'm happy for him. He Deserved it. I happy for that guy. He Deserved it. Again. I I, I'm not mad either way. If it would've been him or Sequan or fucking Lamar, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bat an eye. Listen, I'm sitting here mad that Eli Manning didn't make the Hall of Fame. Why? Because Eli Mann is the Hall of Fame First Battle.


Wait. Doesn't have an opportunity. It's not a first battle Of Hall of Fame. That's why I'm not all the way mad. He'll get in. I do know that he'll get in. Yeah, He'll get in. But Eli Manning has a bunch of losing seasons. And Eli Manning's numbers came as a result of just compiling data. He played long enough that we, he's in the top five and damn near every quarterback stat. Just offer longevity alone. But the two super, I agree with what I heard somebody on ES ESPN saying, you can't tell the, the recent story of football without Eli Manning. Mm. You can't. Two times Super Bowl MVP beat the undefeated team. Held a nigga.


17.9 him. But yeah, you just can't tell it without him. I don't need to do it. 'cause I do believe he'll get in there. I think he, he Definitely will Get in there. And more importantly than that, we didn't cover the Pro Bowl because who Cares? Don't need coverage. Shout to Zaire for making the Pro Bowl. For sure. And or Pro, however, have y'all seen Marshall Manning? No, I haven't seen that yet. Marshall Manning is Peyton Manning's son who just so happened to be at the Pro Bowl throw bombs. Kid.

Nobody Has to know. Yeah. This is all I was waiting for to drop this weekend. Who is this Now you wanted me to tell what is dog? Alright this this what you wanted me to get. Hey. Hey. I said I shake it to the east, shake it to the west.


If you shake on me you get S. That ass suck. This is new partisan Fontaine and Cardi B. Hey I said this leg at the all about a dollar Spanish and French Balenciaga diamond on my collar. But I could have bought a chopper. I'm a sniper. I'm a threat to everybody. Baby Mama balling bitch. My cousin gotta away balling. I could throw my birthday at the ball. Play all let it out. Dominant Baguette told Ben I've been the baller baby I should be a net look. Oldie popping bro. Shopping my new bitch looking like a trophy walking pussy never dry.


'cause the money make a way. I've been hot since 97 nigga I came here a flex. Shake it to the east, shake it to the west to be shake on me. You can dominate Bagget S That ass suck. I say you know that I'm a freak sucking dick. Get wet. I bikini picks and I be fucking up the net. That ass up That that as that ass if you a ball player. I'm trying to recruit that ass Ice scream. He wanna scoop that ass. Turn around through the ground. Uncle you that ass they shooting. I made you look. Turn around. I'm gonna show him how I never met a bitch that could me.


I never let a me. Yeah, It is not for me. Not for Me either. I like, I like Cross and Cardi. I like 'em both. And I love a strip, strip club joint. But that one is not, it's not for me. It sounds like a partisan song featuring Cardi and not a Cardi song featuring partisan. It is a party song featuring Cardi. I know. Yeah. That's what But it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Like I like to see the asses. The budgets have decreased. You're not gonna hear it. You don't think so? You'll never hear the song Stripper. Okay, well I don you're In more than me Paul. You never strip club and lemme not say that. 'cause I'd like it to. I I root for, I root for Partisan.


I don't see it. Think it's gonna work. I don't see it. This was my point that got shut down when I was talking about Doce winning that fucking award and how it could potentially affect Cardi. These lyrics just sound like my puty toe. You a ball player trying to recruit It is like we just heard it. We've just heard it all. It's gonna be tough to find a new variation of the shit that we love from her. I don't think this is that the bar has been raised. You're not gonna feel, you're not gonna see it or feel it for months down the line.


'cause the music business is reactionary. But this is not, that's Not but that's been with damn, I mean outside of her Hardee's big single, most of her records was doing like That. It don't just apply to Cardi. Listen enough. I It is still my joy. Both of you bitches, pussy. I think y'all should s that. Like she still got joints that Yeah I think is the one. But it don't just apply to her. But They don't, they don't get right away like that though. It Is over. Cardi is over. Lotto will have to find a few new tricks. But I think her album even came and went kind of faster than I was. I was accustomed to, I was fired. Yeah. With some shit on there. But it went faster than I was accustomed to.


Listen, I think the girls that made their made their heyday off of this are just gonna have to spend some more time in the studio. I'm not trying to be funny. Nah, I think they just, I don't Think so. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm not trying to be mean. I think they're not dropping enough. And so I think to what Park was saying earlier, like, yo, if you do this long layoff, you can definitely be forgotten about. I just think that if Cardi start putting out music and pro, You know what I mean? Bang, bang, bang. And she started banging them again. Pause. I think that it'll pick right up where it left off. I just think the the layoff is, is starting to be scarily long for her son.


Gotta again, I retired, I retired from music in 2016 was my last album card's. Last album was in 2017. Wow. But she's had moments, great records, great moments since. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? Like, I like the way I still think, I think Cardi could come with a record this summer and and and pick right back up my nigga. I think if Party party's verse on that song, if that was card's verse, I think that song is a different song. I he wasn't riding a beat to me. Like how she would've with the same exact lyrics. She would've wrote the beat better than he did. And I think that song coulda had something.


Listen, they both have my support. I fuck with 'em both. Same. That's just Not for me. Just that one. And I reserve the right to, to change my mind if it comes on in the strip g club and, and does something different. You See, you see It do something a little different then I then I'll totally take it back. Cardi was at Girls Love karaoke. Shout to her. No Worries.
