They was out earth. The the real earthy hoes was at the Lucky Day show. Mel was there trying to be earthy. But it didn't, it wasn't vibing. It wasn't giving that, I wasn't on my earthy shit that day. You didn't have the Petro oil On? No, I didn't. This gonna sound crazy to say, but yo like real, real r and b niggas, they know how to bring the chubby girls out. Yo.

Armani gonna look at me and say, yo It is a lot of big hoes in here. And that's how you know real r and b is in the building. Yeah. Because there's big holes here.

And y'all were talking to the girls that were around us when we were at the Tank concert. Y'all. That's snitching. Who Y'all. That's snitching like y'all? No, no, no. Who y'all. It was a, it was a great group of people that were surrounded around us when we were at the tank show. It was just, it was just love for the performance and the artists that we were watching. That was it. Who won The photo with fans Competition this time? Oh, we didn't do that. No, We didn't do it This time. We was in New York. Yeah. We weren't playing like that in New York. Gotcha. What I will say off of Mel, 'cause she's a fucking doof. What?


Yeah, Mel is like, she get all fucking tie. Don't come back here and be shy. Bass nigga up there. I'm not being as, I'm not being shy. Shy was up there popping ass in the air for some stranger and tucking on a belt. So don't come here and be shy. But anyway, I'll say about watching Lucky Day is, boy it feels good to grow with an artist. Right? Like watching Lucky Day, five years ago, playing Roll Someo as a sleeper for the first time and then seeing how he was coming Pause. Felt good to see him. Soul Out Show Radio City White, diamond Stud r and b outfit on You can see been working out.


I'm dropping my shit. I'm in my bag. I got the funny haircut. I used to have a beef with the funny haircut. Now seeing it, it makes sense in action. It makes all, it makes all the sense in the world. Shout out to his entire team. You can just tell the, the energy and the effort and the concentration that went into the branding and rollout of this project felt good to see a band up there. Yes. Felt good to see a band up there. I've been to Radio City and seen some of you artists without a band. My dad hates that. If I had one complaint, I wish the drummer would've had a little more freedom to get loose. A lot of those Lucky day records with the, with the, with the bop. Allow for the freestyle drum. So I know we're playing the Clip. I know we're playing Clip. I know.


No background singers. No, I know. That's why I like a Robert Glass for sure. Or just any show with a drummer. Just say hold up. Yeah. You know Oh Shit, you got that in the bag. What I thought was fire was that even with no extra, 'cause he had the backdrop and all that, the video stuff. But even with no real extra shit on stage, he was still great performing wise. Not just vocally. Like he was all over the stage. Yeah. He kept, he entertained. There was like some rock influence to certain joints, which is why I understand the haircut. Certain shit But. yeah. He was just entertaining. Like there wasn't a moment where I felt like all I'm, I'm not in into what's happening. Yeah. And as I'm watching Lucky Day hate to do it. Poor Miguel.


Yeah, it's over. Poor Miguel. Yo said it's over. Nah, he popping. I don't think it's, well okay, I won't say it's over. Okay. But I've wanted Miguel music for quite some time. We all have. I'm gonna say it. don don't Need it. He might not say it. You think it's Over? Well I said it's over But. Yeah. I think he pops out with the right joint. He'd be all right. Yeah. I think he just Got It. He tried to pop out last year with the right joint and listen, I'm that sure was I too, listen to this. I'm not saying It is over because of quality of music from Miguel. I'm saying it's over because they both on RCA. Oh Yeah. Okay. That Makes sense. Now you're the priority At That's the problem. It is not that hey lucky that his music is so incredible that It is over for Miguel Got it this is the priority now though. This is now the bar at RCA and this is where the energy is going.


Yeah. You Have to now compete with that in the building for r and b, Callam Remy, he'd be right Or go to a different realm or go to a different lane. Which I don't even wanna see Miguel do that. Yeah, I was just about to ask. You want don don't. I know, but I, but as Joe's saying, that's why I said it's over. We, we don't need that no more coming from you if we're both on the same label. I think You can Go back to that sala Remy vibe that he was on for the first album and get into that. That might sort of hip hopish. Both Lucky Day are albums are on the vibe of Kaleidoscope. Yeah, I know. That's why you should go back to He tried to shit do that Yo that Diamonds until record is fucking Phenomenal. Watching him perform that shit absolutely Made me light. Nah, his settlers was absolutely crazy fired.


How long did he perform? 90 minutes. Yeah. Nice. 90 minutes came, came back out for Encore. Yeah. That's nice. Hit a couple songs and A moment of downside. He did, He did. Floods. Misunderstood. And then he misunderstood. I thought he was gonna sing the mail or misunderstood, but she wasn't ready for that. I whole self Double Chins would've been having a fit up there. But I know You're not motherfucking talking. All I do is stare at your double chin. Where? Right there, right, Right there. For real. Yeah. Called George double Turkey wall right there. The beard is covering up a little bit. But You Oh well see. Grow a beard nigga. Dope. Please don't. Yeah, but his, his set list everything about that night. Shout out to the fans.


Shout out to Lucky Days. Entire team. I'm gonna say it again. Every time I go to one of them shows, I'd be so happy to not be on that side of the, the, the tour anymore. Good to go as a consumer. Sit in the seat, watch a show, get some popcorn and the glitzy take your ass back on. You don't miss about that shit. No. About Touring. No. Not at all. Miss. Every time I even think about a tour, I get stressed out. You Miss touring? Yes. What do you miss about it? The travel, the being up there for a minute for some people. I miss all that shit. I don. I don't miss the the bullshit that comes with it. The exhaustion, the fucking, I miss meeting fans. That part I miss meeting fans. But for everything else that comes along with a tour, that's, That's funny.


But no, no disrespect. The way y'all used to be torn was Rough but not right. Not when We were pod touring. It was none. Yeah. You talking about music? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Pod touring. We never, we never pod tour. Rough got Got got. Not at all. You at The top of the top actually Top of the top for the Pod tour. Four Seasons, huh? Yeah. come on. Wait, y'all was four seasoning up huh? The pod tour, huh? Yes. Oh, we gotta do, we Gotta do something. PO tour, you Got a grandpa. Music Tours were not the same. It's Not the same nigga. What Four Seasons Top of the Line Club hanging Out with Charles. Charles Spark Gym was nigga did. Quinta Nigga. Huh? We Did the La Quinta on a good day.


La Quinta Nigga. Quinta nigga did the Quinta. Yeah. And then totally outside of that, I go to bed with Mel fucking popping her ass on Lucky Day. And then I wake up to fucking flip on air. Before you get into that, Oh, I'm sorry. You, you, I heard that you bumped into some people over there at the show. You bumped into some people at the show. How was that? Did you say hello? Were you nervous? Were you unr? It sound like you was happy. Un who You bumped Into. Were you unr? It Sound like you was happy in the video. Let's go man. So you don't sound nervous, but still looks, looks un deceiving. Sound is deceiving. I Love Flip.


Yeah, no, flu is great. I didn't bump into anybody at the show. Okay. Okay. Did you see anyone that you knew? Yes. How did you handle that? I didn't. I just watched, I just watched the show. It was nothing to do. Okay. Yo, do y'all know I don't have no problem with nobody? Do y'all know that? Yes. I really don't have any problem with anybody. And speaking to Imani, I have figured out what people's problem is normally with me. Yes. We figured it out. I figured it out. What's it, What is It? is it, would you guys come to Deduce? We came to the conversation yesterday and, and I keep, every time I, I'll speak to it, I bumped into Rory at the show.


My man gave him dad peace. Boom, boom. So I. Guess when he went to his seat, Joe saw him noticing. Cool. And then after talking to Joe yesterday, I just had the que like, what? I'll set it up here. What is the thing with you and old friendships that people like? It feels like it's a continuous thing. Like a, not a problem, but something like, there's still tension after years and years and years. And his answer was After much thought and self-reflection, Therapy And therapy. The real therapy. Not that shit these niggas talking about out there doing. I think it's It is the way that I detach from people.


People take offense to That. Yes. People that, people that think that we have developed a lot of equity, a lot of experience, a lot of time in the relationship. The way I detach cold, Cold Turkey though. I get cold. I get cold. I do with my girl. I do When, I get When, I start feeling hurt or taking advantage of or some shit. I get real cold and I just don't feel anymore. So if we have all of these years of experience and years of just X, Y, z, that can look away and come off away. And if you don't get closure for that or you don't heal from that, then you carry that for years and years and years and years. I think that's what the habit is.


Does it come with age? I think that's what the habit Is. Because does it come with age? Meaning that if there's, if there is a conversation that need to be had, no matter where I see you, I'm going to me, I'm gonna have it like, yo, what's up? Not on no beef shit, but just a conversation and the understanding. But I guess it comes with maturity that sometimes You can be in the same building with somebody and don't have nothing to say. But You gotta care to have that conversation though. I always have something to say. Like I don't give a fuck. Like I'm kind of like Joe with that. Oh you are? Okay. When When I, I just don't care no more. You You can be sitting right there. don don't have nothing to say to you. You just don't say nothing to me. Going Cold. Don't mean you don't care though. I'm saying you have to care to have that conversation. Yeah, though. And cold means you protecting yourself. That's what I'm talking yourself. You have to care just to approach the conversation with the person.


That's how I feel about going Cold because that's how I usually am. I would want to go cold with someone to where don don't want them to feel like they've hurt me more than they actually have. Yeah. But If mad, sorry, I didn't mean I, I treated the friendship like, like, like when I'm, when I'm out shopping for, for clothes, sometimes I'll see, I'll see a shirt or something and I won't get it and I'll go home. And if I'm still thinking about that item in that week, I'm gonna go get it. Yeah. I'm right back to it. So the friendship is the same. I'm gonna get cold. If it was something worthwhile there that at some point me and him stopped talking, I feel like there was something worthwhile there that at some point it was like, Hey nigga, let's kick it. Right. And if it ain't nothing worthwhile, it ain't nothing worthwhile there. But, But I, I don't have no problem with, with your man.


That's so funny. you know don don't have no problem with your man. So if he would've came and have a con tried to have a conversation with you, would you engage Don? Don't know about that. you know what I'm processing? 'cause I, I tried to have that conversation in the 40 40 when ice water, fucking Mexican outfit, Cinco de May, all of us went into 40, 40 niggas went over there, greeted him and everybody else over there. I went to do the same because I'm a man and an adult and he showed his ass. You only get one time to show your ass with me. Oh, okay. See I okay. You don't just keep getting times to get me your ass to kiss because you hurt. You get one time to speak to me like that. And if I love you enough to not knock your entire head off your shoulders, then I'm gonna just walk away and not speak about it ever again.


It's no, it's no harm for me. Once you identify a threat, you get 'em away from you. And that's the end of that. Them niggas accused me of stealing and thievery as a friend that was doing a lot of friendship. So now you gotta stand on that. You gotta stand on that. I'm standing on mine. I wouldn't steal from none of my friends wouldn't think about it. That's like the furthest thought in the world for me. That's not the man that I am. I'm standing on that. You nigga. Stand on that side. Stand on it. It's nothing to talk about from there. Okay, what about if it's just a big misunderstanding, right? Like sometimes You may No a friend you accused me of stealing. There is no misunderstanding. The misunderstanding could lead lead to the accusation though. Yeah.


That I could like, Like I mean, don don't, I don't, I haven't spoken to them about don don't talk to you about none of that shit. But they could really believe That that's what I saying they were stolen From and, and their beha. There's nothing wrong with having the thought behavior from the thought is what has to be is what has to be highlighted. Okay. If I felt like Ish was stealing from me, then I'm gonna pull him outside to talk. If we don't come to a resolution, I'm gonna invite him to dinner. I'm gonna invite him to my house. I'm gonna pull up at his house. There's gonna be be some type of FaceTime conversation. If I think my man has stolen from me, no, but What if you're dealing with a person like you that's shut down though. How? I don't shut down. How, how will how was the I don't shut down. I'm Mr. The talk. I'm Mr Let's go to therapy.


I'm Mr. Less kicker. I don't shut down. You ever think A-A-A-A-A fight is sometime the best route to go just to get some of this emotion out. Would would that ever be like an option For you? Not for me. 'cause I don't, I don't have the emotions. I don't have the emotions. It's so Weird. 'cause and what? Dumb niggas, dumb Niggas I don Over there doing what they doing that don't affect my my day to day or my bottom line. You know what It is too, Joe, real Quick. And hopefully I don't affect theirs. Just one, one thing. I gotta because I really, I'm not as close to you as these guys are, but from what I notice, I do notice that while yes, you do take accountability, you do have a response for everything. And sometimes that could deter you from wanting to express yourself because somebody could come to you and be like, yo, Joe, but you have a response and you have a Now don don't wanna say excuse your truth.


And sometimes people just want you to hear them out. you know what I mean? And a lot of, and and I noticed that about you, you end up hearing them out later on. But if somebody's not built for that, if you don't have that type of, I'm not gonna say confidence, but if you don't have that type of patience, I could see it like, man, don don't wanna speak to the nigga because if you start to speak to you, you, you do have, you have a reason for everything. And it's true. But sometimes a nigga don't want to hear the reason. They just, I've been holding this in for so long. I just want to speak and let me get my shit out. Anybody I speak to regularly, I feel like I can be vulnerable with. Hmm. That was what I was thinking outside Of that. don, don't give a fuck if niggas ain't talking. That's I'm not Mr.


Talk. He talk wanna be cool, fly down. Hey you nigga start one thing. I think one thing I'm cool with the, the separation. That would say it ain't gotta be a fight. It ain't gotta be a beat. I'll say this 'cause I, I, I've dealt, I kind of been dealing with that a little bit with people in, in recent times. And I've really just come to a point, normally I would want to go ahead and be cold and be the person to like give you my ass to kiss. And even if I understand the relationship, the friendship, the coolness is over. I still wanna at least leave us with some level of respect. If we've ever said that we care about each other, we love each other, we wanna see each other succeed. I want at least be able to walk away with that feeling and not feel like anytime I see you on the street, there's this like weird little, Well what I'm thing, what I've processed, like When, you guys are talking it, it just fuck No hell no.


But that's me. No I. Don, you said no to me. I no, I listen. Like It all sounds like a fear of vulnerability. All of it. True. I'll give example. Verne, me and Vern didn't talk for seven, eight years. Couldn't even remember why we fell out. Really couldn't figure it out until you just get to a vulnerable place of, even through this whole time, I I, I didn't really want be around your speak to you, but I always still wished you well. I never wanted to see you do bad until we get to a point where it's like, nigga, what do, nigga, we still love each other. Like, nigga you still my man, I'm down to do that. I'm not down to do that. While niggas is in the middle of their healing journey. Well, can I understand? They gotta catch me closer to the end of their healing journey when maybe cooler heads could prevail.


Right now, don don't. I'm not, I'm not coming to the negotiating table with niggas with 33-year-old and 34-year-old brain. That's not where I am today. Yeah. One more thing I have to say. When you're accused of stealing right, it trickles down to everyone else. Meaning like, they expect you to see it from their perspective. Yo, that nigga was stealing from niggas. Yo, that it, it, it has an, it don't have an effect because I don't pay attention to it. But people would ask you or accuse you when, especially When, you have a powerful voice. So of course in my mind it's like, no, this nigga doesn't steal from me. I don't have any issues with him pertaining to that. I get paid on time every time. Sometimes Early.


That's Sometimes early. Sometimes niggas got stuck to me. Yo, yo, that's a fact. It is just, I got some shit that I don't know what's going on. That's a fact. Like stop So, I. you know how hard It is for niggas to work? When you have stolen from people and I'm not censoring myself right now. Yeah. So we can move on. Let's find another topic. Let's do it. Okay, but When, you have stolen before. Like When, you have committed crime. Yes. When, you have lied, robbed beese. It take mad years to restore your reputation. True. The last thing I need is niggas That is around me. So the public think that you know me a little bit to come and try to kick my back and like you got some type of information. Hell no. Stealing from who I Got it stealing from who? That's like one of the worst things You can say to me anyway.


To me. Well certainly As a business owner. Yeah. Yeah. I agree Fox. That's, that's a bad thing to put on. Very Bad thing. A business owner. Yeah. Yeah. No, So. I don't. I don't play with that one nigga. You said that. So stand on it for the rest of life. You have to face, you have to face the decisions and ramifications that came with your decision in that moment. Live with it. What if they come out and you know, after doing some research or something and clear that up. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just throwing a hypothetical there. Hey, you know what, This what we thought I looked through X, Y, and Z. We thought this didn't understand this. He didn't actually steal. Oh, Rory know ain't nobody stole. I'm asking But he can't Because then Chick-fil-A for everybody Chick-fil-A for everybody.


Why can't, why Polynesian sauce? Fuck that mean, why can't he clean it up? I don't understand that part. Pride. No. No. Okay. Make a public declaration that he was Wrong. I don't want no public declaration. You done showed your ass nigga done showed their ass. I ain't trying to fucking dog. Got you. I'll be 44 years old. Niggas I not get into life And how many years we got on the clock. But I ain't, I ain't going backward for nobody. Not for nobody. I'll say this much. The lesson that I'm learning just in all, it's just in speaking with people that I deal with on a regular basis today and people who I might not deal with on a regular basis that I still have rapport with. I'm just learning the lesson of just protect your friendships, whatever that looks like.


Whatever this sounds like from the good, from the bad, from whatever. Just protect your friendships and move forward in life. I think that's all everybody can do. Hey, who was flip You said with Kai the other day? come on. Come on, let's hear It. Yeah, so yeah, I mean, you finally got your wish. I just wanna say real quick, that was ama. That felt great for me to watch. Same. That was dope. Same of how you say you old niggas. You old niggas when referring to us.

But, but after my little plumber story, the last pod that he came over, like I I, I want to have a healthy respect for people who the language of hip hop restored or saved them in some way. Mm. Okay. And that can be inclusive to logic. And that's kind of part of my original beef with logic is yo, if you of the language of hip hop, you don't need to qualify. You don't need to come in and say, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, I'm black, my dad is black. Parade your dad around. If hip hop saved your life, then just come in and say That's everyone says dip though Joe.


Everyone expresses that differently. So you can't expect people to express It. There's another Part I don agree with you, but it's one thing that you not looking at, you walking different shoes than him. So you Joe Button, you was born in Queens, you black, you from Jersey City, you did and qualified. You did all these things and you qualified already so you didn't have to qualify. Eminem is a rapper. I never met Eminem. Eminem is from Detroit. But I'm sure throughout his journey, even as being as nice as he is, he still had to do some things that quote unquote qualified for others to accept them or validate 'em. Okay. But what I identify in myself is I have an issue with the qualifiers. Gotcha. That that could be Possible. And I'm trying to grow. Nah, I'm agreeing with, you Know, I'm just saying if hip pop saved your life no matter where you from, no matter the color of your skin, no matter your weight or height.


I'm down with that. I'm down with that. It saved mine. I ain't no better than nobody else. Gotcha. Look at This Shit man. I like man I'm liking This man. I ain't mad this liking this. Yo. Not bad. I like this. I had an epiphany when Amani called me and told me the dude wanted to shoot the fade with me. Mm. Like I seen the YAI interview, then Imani calls me and I'm like, yo, where I'm at?

There's a different relationship there. So I'm sure You can owe me. They gave you some leeway And When, you get it done, you send the money, yada yada yada. But now with this new regime, that Leeway is gone. That race is Gone. Atlantic made, I saw like a earnings call that went around but Atlantic might have made a hundred something million dollars in the last quarter. It was, it's it, they're down. So they calling in they chips. Yo, if you owe us money, yeah we need that. I need all that right now. Not just that nigga you said some shit I ain't like pay me. Well also don don't know how harmonious Kanye's exit from the Universal system was. Got you. Yeah. So now my son is in charge at Atlantic And you dis pops When.


you did the like that remix. Yes. And Jewish people Andrew. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Oh yeah, nah, yeah, pay, Pay. Not that I know that Lucian is Jewish, but I'm sure somebody somewhere is Jewish Had a problem with that. So Yeah. Yeah. You got And then I saw 40% over the last couple days. So you, If I was an artist, I wouldn, hold up for a second. If I, if I was an artist, I don't know if I would do that. If I, I'm a artist with the, with the status of Kanye. Oh yeah. I'm not signing off 40% or nothing. I do it myself. Right. I'll get a nigga off the street. I'll get a choir to come in here. I'm not giving you 40% of anything Label. You're not giving Ty 40% his label. 40%. No disrespect to Ty. Ty is Fired. I'm not talking about Ty. No, I But you don't need Ty in this Situation.


He might have felt he needed him. I'm just, or Again, niggas is doing that 'cause it's fast. I'm gonna team up with somebody I'm a fan of and I can finish this album in two weeks, a month and a half. I'm being nice. Look, Look, not just that, you know, he got the, the, the little subtle beef with Drake. Ty has been working with Drake forever. So yeah, let me take Him. Oh yeah, Drake. Drake, Let me snatch you. But Drake is universal. Yeah. This could be a lot. Maybe them boys over there at Universal don't like yada yada yada. This music business shit is a mess. It's a Small business too, bro. Don't forget that. What? It's a small business. So if they, if someone over here don't like you, chances are everybody around Somebody that's they team might not fuck with you.


Even if they working at different place Just on the strength of him. So what I saw prior to the text message going up, because if you've ordered anything from Kanye's Yeezy site, they put you on a mailing list. Yeah. So when the Vultures two album came out, they sent the email around to everybody. Album is available, digital album, $5 over the last, I want to say three days. He's been updating that album and reselling it for, for $5. So if you, and it says if you purchase the album, you get the updates in real time, you get Links from the website From directly from ez. Like I must, I just showed Imani, I I got at least five different emails. There's five different deluxe versions of that album. And they would have a timer on it.


Like he's added five new songs already. Each song, I'm selling it again. $5. Mm You have until midnight to buy it though. Mm. So it's like, I don't know if he's trying to run it to get that bread to pay them. I, I I see it as innovation regardless. Whatever the source of inspiration for that innovation is. Well yeah. 'cause you know Kanye's thing has always been, I'm trying to go direct, direct to consumer. So he's found a way to do it as most People should be by the way, Before with the STEM player. Then he found a way to do it with the, the Yeezy site. But it was just the timing of this was a little ironic to me. 'cause it could be, it could coincided with that. It could be, I'm confused why He would really honestly agree to that 40%. That's a wild split. That's That could be a rumor.


It could be a rumor. They definitely did say 40%. It don't sound like a rumor. I Don't think It is. Yeah, It don't sound like a rumor. That sounds like the Kanye portion of this for me is not the most important part. Like kudos to him. Congrats or not Congrats. Julie being fired from Atlantic It is major, is a really, really, really big deal. We talk about 20 plus years of tenure. We talking about her and Craig. Craig Callier. I don't know what this means for Mike. I'll see him at the, the fantasy football draft. But when labels change entire regimes, a lot is up in the air. I took it upon myself to look up the Atlantic Records music roster to see how they could've gotten themselves in this jam.


And I see a Boogie with the hoodie. Okay, That's A good one. Great. Bruno Mars. Okay great as well. Great. Already two people that I don't think drop enough if this is your A-list. A Boogie Drops a lot. But I must say A Boogie Drops a lot And And he Not Bruno. Not Bruno. I'm talking about just A Boogie a Boogie's been dropping a lot and he actually kicked up in the how often he's been dropping From I love A Boogie. The last couple projects. I love Highbridge. A Boogie dropping and a boogie dropping with the support from the label looks different. Valid. Valid. Totally different. Bruno Mars, we already know about his cadence.


Cardi B no comment. Alex Metric. Whoever That is, I'm not sure Charlie P I'm not, I've heard Charlie. He's a big star. He's but he doesn't drop enough Either. Ed Sharon. Yeah, he doesn't, he's on a horse. He's on a horse waving goodbye to people. Yeah. Sia, He hasn't dropped in a while to My, he hasn't dropped In a while. Abba ASO Legacy Act. Cilo Green Coldplay Dek Cab for Cutie Florid. Big Mel still in the game. Halle Storm. Janelle Monet. Okay. That's James Young Kani. Kevin Gates. Lil Uzi Lizzo.


That's A nice roster. Yeah. They said they haven't broken an artist in five years. I could believe that said they haven't broken any artist in five years. This roster sound like you gonna land on Board Walker Park place soon. Yeah. And be and be And be in the gym. Yeah. And they seem like they wasted a lot of money Over too. As a as a label. Yeah. The labels. Yeah. Yeah. They wasted a lot of money over there trying to build up. And a lot of these people you had social media impressions. Lil Uzi Vert had that little kerfuffle with with his label. All We know is it was rectified. Somebody paid fucking That's my Nigga. What is up with this nigga?


Jay won. Oh yo, He's everywhere. That's my man. What was I saying? Lil Uzi ver had that little kani. I'm not certain how often that Cardi B won. She just dropped So Kani So, and she's on tour and Uzi sells records when he drops. I could see how if this is what you come into the Monopoly game with, somebody at some point is gonna have something to say about the returns. Yeah. My only thing is Elliot Grange don don't feel like Trippy Red Ice Spice and Takashi six nine. I don't think that demands enough for you to be able to sell 10 K.


He sold 10 K records or whatever the name of that shit is still, still has it and is still a pre president over here. I don't think that the success of Trippy Red Ice Spice and Takashi warranted that. I Don't, that could fi and you fired niggas that could have potentially been at your christening. But nepotism and I am a fan of nepotism. What are you supposed to do for your kid? I'm, I'm with you and yo it almost came full circle. We had Stout up here and Stout talking About coming soon. Subscribe to that Patreon. Oh damn. My bad. It's all right. But, but we had Stout up here and Stout was talking about how people are sitting in these corner offices and they are making a shit ton of money but without new product.


So you niggas is getting paid off A Public Enemy album Legacy shit legacy grandfather down a lot of shit. Yeah. Yeah. But y'all not putting no new revenue into the, into the stream. So what we paying y'all for? So listen, IIII went to pull up this about the Earnings Warner music made a net of $160 million. Now this would be considered piss poor compared to rival company Universal Music who made $3.2 billion with a B God in just quarter three alone recorded music revenue was down 2.4% for Warner Music, despite two of their premier acts. Meg Thee Stallion and Cardi B dropping music all year. Now of course card, you know singles who Warner now has a cash balance of $607 million with a debt of 3.978 billion.


God damn. So from a shout to keys for breaking in. Yeah, you gotta go. Now from a business, from a business standpoint, we all know this just from watching stock market shit. The second that companies get into trouble, the first thing we're gonna cut is salaries. Yep. And some of these s salaries that we can't justify no more. Gotta they gotta go, gotta go. We've justified as long as we can. Y'all have to go at that point, That much debt is outrageous. That Is crazy. Crazy. That's crazy. Yeah, but you know what, I ain't know that on the, on the ground level, like without being invited to these back rooms. I said ages ago, we not even getting album releases to the standard that we once did. That means something when every week come and It is like up nothing up, nothing When you artist is dropping once every however many years.


Even when it came to Cardi, I was like, Hey, Carney may be able to do what she want 'cause she's well off. Somebody at that label's job is reliant on her coming out. That's True. Like so think about this just again from an economic standpoint that these artists are now sounding better deals. So somebody like Cardi, somebody like Uzi, these niggas are signing deals that are more favorable for the artist. So the label ain't even generating the margins that it used to generate. True. So if you don't have the other subsequent acts that are dropping that are gonna keep the lights on this bitch y'all headed for disaster. Well that's The problem too. 'cause these labels aren't even trying to develop new acts. Right. They, they've abandoned that. Give people a talk.


So now they just, all right, we just gonna deal, we gonna try to cheat our way by signing on some social media. And if I'm in that much debt, if I'm in that much debt, the luxury of breaking a new act is gone. It's over. But that's, I can't And then y'all can't force Cardi to drop. Y'all can't force Uzi to drop because they got dope ass contracts. Now we fuck. That's the other thing that nobody is noticing. Y'all not really getting no new mainstream acts. Right? Yeah, True. They milking the shit out of the ones that they have to, whereas we applauded ll for having 20 and 25 years in the game. These labels today are gonna make sure that they five and six people that they're relying on have about 20 years in the game. Yeah. Y'all are keeping the lights on at this point. Literally. I'm surprised by that list being so small.


you know what I'm saying? Like aren't just for like, just not knowing. But like don't they, wouldn't they have like an like an artist of like a bunch of artists that are like on the shelves that they can kind of go into that ball Current? don don't think That's catalog. They had HaBO on there. Yeah, no, I know, but AB is like a legacy app. Yeah. Like when's ABBA making is, is ABBA making new music? I don't know. Maybe Don don't think So. I don't think so. But maybe. But the problem with that also is it we don't have the money to put into development. Nobody else new either. We are damn. But that's why I'm asking about shelved artists that might actually have some development already there and they've just been kind of waiting for their chance. But you Know, you're not getting a chance if I'm in that much debt.


Yeah. So now we Budget to, to you not Getting a budget and all of the new niggas with some motion is ending up at a fucking Empire, Masters Or anywhere where they could just have their shit or United Masters or, or Yeah. You have other options. It's fucked up out there now more than ever. As an artist, I, the days of signing, giving my shit away to a a major It is over, over It is over. I know that that's been said before. No, now, but now more than We're getting closer. It, It's getting real cl and a lot of these younger artists that now they have the benefit of the internet. They have information, information and they have way more information. So they like, Hey, I ain't walking into this just taking this slave deal, y'all putting on the table.


I'm high, I can go do this over here. I might not sell a hundred thousand, 200,000 whatever, but I could make more money selling 20,000 records. Yes Indeed. And you got the support fuck y of other smaller companies that are now showing you how to also be a part of it and do it with Other brands and the information. Now again, I'm not an artist and don don't, this is my music shit ain't my thing. But mathematics is my thing. So you could go over here and sell a million albums and make less money than a nigga that's selling 50,000 albums on an independent nigga sell a million money. And I got my control over here And even look at the album sales, right? Like It is 20, 30, 40 k Bro, you hit 50, 60, you hit 60 k, you damn near number one for the week.


That was not the case a few years ago. 60 K was like, yeah, You can be happy we flopped. 60 K would be the end of your job where I'm from. Yeah. You would not get another shot at this Thing you are celebrating no time soon you Celebrate We talk about majors. Be clear. Not, it's Not independent. No, no, No. I know for the people out there What the Solution that major label system is getting nutty. Then you got universal jumping in, pulling the, pulling the shit with Drake. Hey, pull that shit down. Yeah. Oh, he, they took down the a hundred gig shit already. Yeah. Oh really? Really? Yeah. I thought the, the footage like I predicted on the pod was the most interesting thing. It to Me it was, it was amazing to me. Yeah, the footage was amazing.


It was truly, truly amazing to me. Great. Great to see. Phenomenal move by him and his team. That release was peculiar. That's still up by the Way. It is still up. Yeah, I Just checked the website. Okay. It's up. The music is still there. Oh, then we take it back. Someone, someone had a talk. Drake posted on his shit that, on his Insta story that he was having problem. Alright. Aboutm sure It, someone called someone and said that, Hey this is good. That's still a very peculiar drop. Number one Smart drop. You need, he needed to be humanized to The public human. Yeah, I was, he diverted, he diverted that beef energy Off when it happened. I hadn't seen the stuff, but I was like, I'm sure they gonna show him in a funny, silly, more humanistic light because the pictures out here now is that he's this fucking dragon coming down swooping everybody's shit.


You out show him. And the More creative and even in the, we've always known he'd been super creative, but just seeing the creative process that he does made you just appreciate The songs more came actually making the beat for One dance. The beat with whoever was making the beat reference tracks doing shit for Kanye and all these other people. Yeah. That was dope. Do you think that it was received that way though? I think So I think so. Yeah. Okay. Not my concern. How it was received. Me as a music lover and fan loved seeing that. Yeah, me too. I didn't even care too much about the songs. Yeah. Didn't matter. I didn't care too much about the songs. Didn't matter. Yeah. There was a bunch of shit. I didn't even know what that was. A lot of footage, which means he has been taping a lot of footage for years. Which also tells me that something else is coming. You didn't, you didn't, you ain't been taping all this footage for all these years just to do a quick dump because you needed to be humanized.


Yeah. Something is coming like a big something with all of this footage. Man. We saw That. That Kanye genius Netflix doc and like with a artist of Drake, Drake's Stature. Yeah. I'm recording and I'm gonna put together. I'm Especially He came from fucking media. From tv. Exactly. He gave us a bunch of, A bunch of seasides. Oh yeah, for sure. C and d sides and the real shit is coming soon. Yeah, for sure. But I was even really appreciative of that man. His, his recording process. Him and the booth, him coming up. Him not so successful, him then successful. I was talking to man, I was like, I don't know how I feel now about Hotline Bling right now that I see him and his crew in there. Yeah. Coming up with the lyrics to Hotline Bling.


We've all heard the rumors about Drum and him taking the song Cha Chacha from Drum and the idea and the inspiration. That drum song was a hit. That Drake song's Drum was a smash. Yes. Like mega mega, mega Mega Smash. And any of us could have gotten that drum beat and going in the studio. We, we were not coming out with Hot. That's A fact. We were not coming out with Hotline Blink. I, I think now where he got the inspiration from, even now I'm too much of that nigga that even that ain't never Happened. I don't even like that. Where I fuck something down and then her phone was blown up. No nigga, all her niggas knew that it was my turn to fuck it down, Busting down. It Wasn't just calling while I'm right there.


Look, you don't play with me like that. But even the inspiration where he got the song I really loved, I loved everything about a drop. I can't lie Even, Even just how Jay made it a priority to get that verse done. Like literally them talking about Yo Jay's literally on stage. He about to get off in two hours and he gone back in just so we can get this one shit with him. That was dope. That was Fire was fun was it was a lot of stories coming out. Ross just told one about how he went up to the garden. Jay was about to perform right before he went on stage. Let him hear the beat and fucking record off Teflon. Done Freemason. He He, he did it in, he told him what the concept was and he did it in 20 minutes now and then when it hit the Stage.


Now on the flip side of this coin, while I absolutely love the drop, I do not love what I think it symbolizes. What What's that? I don't, I never think a artist of Drake's stature should do a free release of that stature. Think it sniffs of something is moving into legacy world. Yeah. Something is something That is funny there for me. Yes. It was a phenomenal move. It is and I love it. I Would agree with you if it wasn't coming off a horrible six months Of I was about to say. Yeah. I think, I think desperate times called for desperate measures. You, you, you, you, you emptied a lot of banana clips for that stabbing I. think that nigga, I think He sent a lot of bullets out. A hundred gigs.


A lot of footage and three songs. That nigga Needs a break. Yeah, but I got a whole that that ain't, that ain't half. That ain't even a piece of what I really got. I understand that. I'm just not used to that from our megastar. He ain't used to that nigga. He not used to being in that position. Trying not used. I'm trying to pose shit that I already have to give myself more time with all the other shit I'm trying to Do. Listen it work on me. I jumped her back on the wagon look and I jumped back on the wagon like nah, good to see him. Listen, I don't like mob ties Drake, I don't like anybody that it feel like this is not organic and true to who you are. Word. The Drake footage for me showed him in his natural light with his normal accent smoking a hook with his normal friends blowing.


I never seen a nigga smoke more hookah than that except for artists. All of our favorite slacks. He had that hookah going like that's you guy talking To his mom that that's you about the Serena shit. Yeah. I didn't like the conversation but I appreciate it 'cause yeah it was real. Even That's that when he's like, yes ma, I'm dissing Serena but I'm kind enough to do it with a slap on a joint that I know she'll like I normally customize the disses to be a song that the girl is gonna like. 'cause I know the girl that's both. I like hearing that. That's some shit you would say That is some shit that you would Tell me to say. That would say. I wouldn't say say he May kick chicks back in.


I wouldn't give a fuck if they liked it. Didn't like it, heard it, didn't hear it. I'm getting my shit off bitch. I'm Talking about his rationalization and the bullshit Ma. I know I'm dissing her but at least she gonna like it. What the fuck are we talking about? That's Why it's a little more maniacal. A little bit maniacal. I think he's maniacal. I want him to embrace that type of maniacal versus the mob. Mob ties maniacal. So The evil genius Rather than mob ties. Mm. I mean I'm just going off what I believe his personality traits to be. I don't know. 'cause I don't know him and he don't know Me. So let ask you a question. If You, if you started out that, 'cause we've, well some of us have seen this.


It was a nigga that might have been a nerd, right? Me And me. No, but listen, listen, listen, listen. And me, he about to name my exact story. No, but now you on a journey of hanging with them niggas and now that shit really starts to become a part of your life where you moving around the streets with real street niggas and you engage with real street niggas on a day to day. We've seen nerd niggas start to adapt some of that. That's a fact. We've seen that I don. So you though we shouldn't Encourage. So you talking about people without discipline, you talking about people without discipline? No, That's that sounds, I Ran around with Webb and Ty for a million years. At no point did I feel like, alright I can speak to people like I'm webbing Ty maybe except for my 50 years. But You start rapping about yo nigga you went from 10 minutes to rapping on tapes talking about don't let me go get a gun or come with a tripod and all That other shit.


No, I was doing that long before webinar. I'm just, that's just hip hop. What up? The second that I start doing it and behaving that way and pulling up and encouraging the the real niggas around me to live they life in a way that's not conducive with this music shit that We on then I'm doing Me and you a disservice. It's Possible. It's possible. But Drake, Drake is a chameleon though that in that, in That, that's the other thing that footage said. So in that respect, it really, It really cemented him being the greatest actor in the world. Yeah. He's a chameleon. So at that point, if you are gonna make that music, 'cause you want to be that well-rounded just musically at some degree you gotta also live up to it in some type of, Or you, But that's, that's, that's just you as a, I don't wanna just say an actor but just as a chameleon of your surroundings.


I got, if I'm going to play this part I gotta play it to a T. 'cause that's the only way this is gonna make sense at the moment. Or whether It is It is real or not or whether we respect it or not. You just gotta stick to it. Or this is who I've been wanting to be all along and I just never been able to do it. But now I got, now I have the means to do it. That's Rapper Cat. I got the real niggas around me. Me That is rapper, we rapper, All, all of That is Rapper Cap. Then I know we in entertainment. See that's rapper Ka. If my mom is in these studio sessions and that's who I'm confiding in When, I, disser. I don't wanna hear none of that shit you're talking about. don don't wanna hear none. I really want to be this nigga. Nigga shut up. Be Yourself. I could be multifaceted. I really wanna like both don't, but no it ain't Both things Can be true. No, no it Ain't. Yes they can. I don't Think So I don't think so. I don everybody don't Have the discipline. Both things could be true. I know niggas that Stone cold killers that will get on the ground and Google gag with they kids and do all that other shit.


True. And it's both them. They they, they are both genuinely them That don't have nothing to do with a nigga inviting his mom to the studio and explaining to him that her his thought process and when he diss girls and customize, oh that could just Relationship With my nigga. You think that could be the relationship with mom? I Ain't trying to convince y'all I sat with enough killers to to to have my own beliefs about 'em. Yes. And they don't have hearts. Some of them were kind, that's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying that they're not kind hearted. Okay. I'm saying stylistically there are similarities between them. That's what I'm saying. I know Killers that great with their kids, great with their parents. Yes. Great. With such and such. I also know Killers or used to that had, let's keep it in the same ballpark that had discrepancies with the opposite sex.


How they handled those and went about those was in a very manly fashion. See IIII agree and disagree but I also do think the only thing that separates this from the other people, those other people ain't going on camera to expose it to the rest of the world. Even if they do move like that, even if in Sequence, that's what I'm saying. Like don don't wanna Shit That that alone. That alone. You the the biggest star in the world. I don't wanna hear none of this moty shit. Yeah. Yo It is already assumed. I watch enough Dateline nigga you get enough money, You can get somebody clip. You ain't gotta tell nobody that. Yeah. There's a certain aura and a confidence and, and and just the way that you walk when that exists, if you keep telling me that it ain't so believable to me, time Decide really can get these niggas though.


Times have changed. Have changed. You talking about old school niggas. Exactly. Niggas today that are certified street niggas. We've seen them niggas with a camera in front of they face standing across the street talking about waiting for this nigga come outside. Yes we have. Wait, that's not to say that it's a good thing though. Street putting good or bad on it. I'm just saying we've seen shit change. But back in the day, if you did something to a nigga, you kept it on a hush. Today street niggas are bragging about the shit that they doing. you Know it's funny, I I I received that Drake could be 38. There's Levels of street niggas too. It is You telling, you're telling me about, you're telling me about about what's going on today and street niggas today. Drake broke in 2009.


Drake will be 38 years old. That means Drake's predecessors are in the ilk that we talking about. Why you telling me about today New nigga You Jake Prince Do what you, you know Jay Prince Jr too. We talk him out and he is up that ilk. We've seen him get on the camera talking We talk about this nigga talking. That's his quote unquote big homie predecessor going live on tv. I think, I think that's open for interpretation. We've seen Jay Prince get on the internet and use and use what I'll call vague threats. Yes. We've never seen Jay Prince get on the internet and detail a crime. We've never seen that. We've never seen Drake get on the internet and detail a crime. He's been vague threat. All that mob shit is attempting to be vague threats too. Okay. He ain't get up there and break down.


I identify the difference in Drake. I don know y'all talking Joe Drake With the melodies not Drake I don y'all talking about I see the difference between, I think that's All he's saying but there's nothing wrong with him saying that. But there's also nothing wrong with someone else saying, yo, I understand the chameleon act of a artist that wants to speak to something that they might not fully be living and it's fair on both sides. I agree with You. You I like that. Or they could be living it. They all from back in the days, man, besides Uncle EA lot of niggas was not rapping about what they were doing. Of course they was rapping about what they mans was doing. Nigga, that's that's, that's hip hop from the Beginning. So that's what I'm saying. So that's what I'm saying today. He shouldn't have to be demonized only Puts on your hand full Of niggas as to playing the role that he decides to play musically.


Lemme just say this, that's just what's working for him. Lemme say this real quick, But is it working for him? It has, it was, it has, it has worked. Let me, let me say this. The biggest arts in the world Eric B Yeah but Those, those songs weren't the songs that made him the biggest artist in the world. Hotline Bling is what made him the biggest artist in the world. Yeah. One dance is what made Pre was the Drake that we know. All of that stuff is a cumulative effort to make that boy the biggest in the world. Let me, let me ask YA question. What makes him the biggest, not just the the hits the Rec. What makes him one of the bigger artists in the world is how versatile he is musically to where he can get into any lane and get on any song with anybody. That's a good point. He can go from one day being on a song with Ariana Grande to the next day being on a song with future or Boss Man deal. Like he can do that. That's, I think the Percentages have been skewed Rise of late I think.


I guess It is what I'm You on memory. Yeah, No cool. But, but for some people even in his camp, whether it's right or wrong, they could be telling him this is what makes sense for you sticking in that realm and if that's what he's been doing and it's worked. I mean he's had this moment where he had a little decrease of the Kendrick shit but outside of that shit's been working for him. That's right. So who are we to sit here and say that shit don't work. It works for him. I don't Think, my conversation was, he didn't know It is different. He didn't say it didn't work. He just Said my conversation. No, he don't wanna See that what works. No I understand that. He Don't wanna, I don't fuck with Mo Tage. Drake cool. I can give two fucks about Mo. There's A lot of people that don't. There's a lot, a lot of people that Don't. I like Drake with the bitches. That's the one I like. Me too. When the girls was writing the cap on I Instagram just hold on.


Yeah that's my, that's my Drake. Hey. But guess what I like the Mob Todd song. I like the song. I like the song too. So in that moment, what do you say?

Guess what? When my birthday comes up, you know what I'm expecting? I'm expecting a pair of cute fucking sneakers knock on and cheese It is my birthday. Oh. I'm expecting something like some cute sneakers. Y'all can collectively do it. But you wanna talk shit about my sneakers. Make sure you wear though. Gimme Huh? Whatever we Get you make sure. Okay.

Yeah. I gotta let it burn. This is what we're doing. My sneakers For me to say these. It's coming from heart. Huge. Ben Apart you and them kicks. Ben fell apart. Alright. Caresha Please. Caresha Please is back with a new episode where Karisha's being interviewed by Saucy Santana the trailer said we were about to get to the business. This was her first time speaking since the entire Puff debacle. And she went on there and, and and she explained her not coming to the defense, to the aid of jt. Her quiet during the entire Diddy shit.


I'm tossing it to y'all man. I was watching Joe Biden Little Yachty. I missed it. Yeah, I saw that. I was watching that too. I'm, thank you. I'm gonna be blunt and just, I started watching it and I turned the shit off. I didn't get no information. I, I like that she did address the JT thing a little bit. But outside of that, How far into it did you get? Maybe like 15, 16 minutes. How long was it in total? Maybe about an hour. Yeah, It was about an hour And I don't know, but it was, I saw her say her and JT not a group. Yeah. I was like we knew that. Oh sorry. It was 33 minutes. It wasn't, yeah, it was 33 minutes. Was it? Yeah. Got it. Sure. But I didn't get nothing from it. The way they hyped it up, the whole thing.


I just thought it was still fire. That was on Revolt. That was, that was funny to me. That was the funniest part of the whole shit. That the shit was still on Revolt. Wow. Outside. Wow. Well because of the Diddy connection with Revolt, even though he's no longer there, the fact that she was gonna address Diddy or the situ Well was supposed to address it. I thought that was interesting that they was going let that fly out there like that. I would think Revolt will want to just move away from even mentioning anything about him at this point. No. I think that her show, they had no choice. But yeah. Her show they're not getting rid of her show. Yeah. Yeah. And what else are we watching Revolt for? So yeah, let's get some people over here to look at this while we try to Cool. Something like that interview had Like 3 million views. Give up then give it up. Yeah. Yes. I over a million now.


Cool. But then just give it up. Just go in there. Like I just felt it was still a little clean cut in how to, how it was addressed. That shit wasn't clean cut. That shit was tap damn city. Right. Nigga pu still outside. Okay. But. yeah, they sold it to us. We all saw it or or caught the snippets of thinking she was gonna give it up and she ain't say nothing. Yeah. Like I was just like, oh, all right. She ain't say nothing. She started crying and she ain't say much or nothing. She was talking. But Could that be 'cause she really ain't have nothing to say outside of what she said. I fucked with him. He was cool. No, I ain't see none of the bad shit. And that was it. No, You saw somebody get they ass whooped on camera. Well They, well she did, she did address that.


She's been in domestic shit in the past. So she would never even allow that to be the case with someone else moving forward. So, I'm assuming that she's saying Hun did, he never had that level of back and forth but you. right. She could have spoken to the Cassie video and shit, but Karisha's Young so I'm gonna give her some grace. Yeah, I'm gonna give her some grace because she's young. Other than that, I don't really have nothing good to say about it and that, that that whole move about, Hey I've been in domestic situations before, so trust me, I would never, I would never involve myself in anything remotely close to that after the world has seen that video of Puff. So you gotta be careful giving out information that you don't mean to give out.


I, I thought the same thing. Like only because people who she's dealt with in the past, If you're telling us that you've been in two domestic relationships and the world has seen a video, the video that we saw, then you have to answer to more than, Hey, he never did that around me. If you choose to speak about it and you can't just roll with, Hey, I never saw none of that on mind in my business. Because there are tweets of you telling bitches, Hey if my nigga wanted, if my nigga wanted to, you would be on the floor eating my pussy. Yeah. That isolated. There's nothing wrong with that. But that after all of the things that we've read and seen lends towards certain things. Yeah.


Also me seeing that after JT coming up here was a bad move for me. Yeah. Because Shorty was super fire. She Was and graceful about the whole situation. Super Fire. JT was an absolute sweetheart up here. Had nothing negative to say about Isha, the city girls. Uzi, quality control. Nothing. Nobody, nobody. It was just total so focused on me what I need to do. My label told me these are the areas I need to work on and that's what I'm out here doing. Did Karisha didn't say anything negative though? Watching the Karisha interview for me, got my brain to what happens in those girl group dynamics when one gets to fucking on a billionaire and one don't.


And then are are what we share our group is losing momentum, losing steam. Isha said we wasn't making no money, I ain't doing shit. So I gotta go bust a move. And you're telling this to, to, to your partner who threw thick and thin. Maybe I'm here with you. I just came outta jail. What we doing? You publicly bashing me. She mentioned the fucking Nikki shit. YI didn't come to J t's aid because I was asleep and When I, once I saw what they was fighting about, they was fighting about the Nicky shit. Shit, I ain't on that record. It's like, whoa. You said that publicly? Yeah. Was You said that publicly about somebody you was in a group with. They start pulling up the old footage of JT on the, that same revolt couch with Saucy and Kaisha.


How they handled her, how they treated her. It just all, it just is a mess. It looked bad. It looked bad. Like let's just call a spade a spade. Even though we can't, like you was out there parading the sign you was out there and in the interview she says, I feel like, I feel like in the same breath she says, I feel like I added value to everything Diddy was doing. Nobody was drinking daily on before me. He sent me this on. I feel like whatever he had going on, I just upped the motion a little bit. And in the very next breath you'll say the the shit that I owned on my own on the side with my, with my partner was bringing $0. you Know, it sounds like the other way around. Dog. I'm, I have a brain and, and I'm of age.


So again, I'm gonna give Kaisha Grace because I think it's greater than her. I think it's greater than her. I think she's giving it from her point of view. She can't really say too much. But whatever was going on, much greater than anything that, that that young lady knew. And I didn't need that interview. Absolutely nothing was shared. Yeah. Nothing was discussed. For the most part, the news cycle has continued and he's not been such a relevant point the way he was. So. I mean. But again, they wanna get the show back rolling. I was about to say, but for her show to get, they wanna get the show back rolling and they can't do it without addressing some of This shit. I get it. But I mean, I, I didn't, I didn't get through. I didn't get through it.


I didn't get through it. Yeah. I mean, I get it. I didn't get through it neither, but, And as much as I wanted support Kaha after meeting jt you don't do that. I will say this, even though I didn't like the interview, I, I and I after meeting jt, I like her. I think the same with Isha. I've never met, never spoken. But I can see that there's a likable thing there that people will latch onto. So I. I Both. I Isha too. Yeah. Maybe not the way, but I, I've met JT in a different light now. Man. No comment man. No comment. That's peace. That's peace. There you go. That's peace. You just know what it look like when bitches is off bitches.


You just know what that look like and feel like. So that was my problem with fucking Crook and Joelle when they caught me on the live after they put that album out saying whatever they said about Slaughterhouse my thing. Well shit nigga, whatever's going on with slaughterhouse. Why the fuck you What? What's this about? Like we in a group, whatever happened with the group, leave it with the group. Like why is this now public fodder? Why are you trying to make the other half of the group look a certain way by you telling your stuff? I think all that shit is whack. I do. Well it speaks, it speaks to how you like to handle this attachment. Well yeah, that part. There you go. That part. I feel like niggas could learn the thing or two about how to dis Disa. Disassociate. Yeah. Prayers to all, all prayers.


All prayers to all Lotto dropped. I did not hear it but me neither. I'm I'm going to go listen though for sure. I like lotto. I same. I wanted to hear it. Yeah, bird as Listen.

You, you, you're Doing Nah, 40 different 60, 70 shows. There's thousand shows between, there's a difference between announcing to the world. I'm about to be somewhere. So you come there expecting that hoopla to you just walking out your hotel or something and just not wanting to be bothered in that moment. I understand not wanting to be bothered but I'm talking about understanding your stardom. Sure. Michael Jackson ain't walking out of well rest people. He wasn't walking out of a hotel room to a car just walking out. I don't wanna be bothered. I just walking around this nigga Ain't Michael Jlan, I'm level A start. I'm not saying he is. Michael Michael's wandering around the zoo.


Hey yo, come on man. I'm just using somebody that has a crazy amount of start. What's wrong with you? I'm sorry. Where else did you get a monkey? Yo, the monkey nigga. The nigga's dad. Yeah. Respect Him. Rest in peace. Stop. come On. And again, I'm not saying he got a monkey. Look, I'm not the first one that to buy a monkey. Nah, French had a monkey. I'm not saying Yeah, I'm not saying he's on that level, but I'm just saying somebody that has that level of like a high level of stardom, you know that that's all you are aware of it. So you have security, you have people to get you to your car. You not walking down the middle of the street and where the Olympics is From what I in Paris, from what I saw, he was rude. Right. But I do also think, yo, at a certain point you would like to hold on to some of that moments where You can actually go somewhere and not have to be bothered.


It's, oh no we not, we get it. Okay. But people are human. No, you're correct. You're human. Have you seen, like, I've seen this dude driving his car, get out the car, stand up on top of the car and within five, 10 minutes there's a thousand people surrounding the car. He leans into that. So I'm just, I'm, and this is not an announcement, I'm just saying so you know what? You just popping up somewhere. Does, you know how crazy and rabbit your fan base is? You create the mosh pit environment. you know this So that got you want the chaos. So that gotta be me every time I step outside or put some a A No, but you should Expect it. No, no, no. Yeah, for sure. For sure. But I'm still allowed to react and that if my emotions in that moment is don don't wanna be bothered, then I'm gonna react that way.


Human, he's human. He's going through things. He might have had a bad day, he might have walked out there and dealt with some shit. Somebody might have fucked on his bitch. We don't know what he going through. Correct. But being older and, and, and having, he not new here. That's more reason he should be free. If somebody fucked on the bitch, I ain't trying to get locked up in the nigga fucking on. I was about No I Gotta be outside I. gotta find out who do, who do the touching nigga. I get what y'all saying. I'm just, I'm just speaking to the human side of yo everyone's not gonna go ahead and conduct themselves the way that we think they should because they're famous. Signing up for something is levels cool. I get that. It is levels Of fame, bro. I just think it's levels of fame. Nah, it's It is and, and you know your level.


True. You know what's gonna be fun. So what You have to have, you, you have to have what? Composure. Yes. And understand. No fuck that. No, what I'm saying is this. If I'm Travis Scott, I'm, I'm, I'm solely speaking on him to the level of stardom he has. If I'm Travis Scott, bro, you're not even getting in front of me where that could happen. True. I have I don. If I'm walking out of a hotels, I've talked to the hotel, I got security, I have whatever. Yo I'm walking, I'm coming out of a side entrance, whatever the case may be, I am taking the steps to where you can't get to me because I know the level of stardom that I bring. Yo. I agree. That's Right. That's right. And I didn't see nobody in any of those videos like there, like to be able to aid or let the police know who this was. Let's handle this differently. EI agree with IEI Do.


Well let's say he walked out the hotel and he got jumped or robbed. What would your response be? He should have never been outside the hotel without a buffer to keep him away from the common people. My my, my response is, everyone that's involved in all this are human beings. So there might have been a moment where yes, he could feel totally fine with that and react a certain way. There could have been a moment where his security wasn't the most on point. So maybe he's really frustrated with security. There could also be a moment where he's just off the shit at the moment, people are human. So I, get what you're saying? Yes. You try to prepare for all that shit that you've, yes. This is a luxury. You a Travis God, you the, you the nigga. But that's just because he's that guy don't mean that at some point he can't be human and feel like I just don't want to deal with comes with being Travis Scott today for that Day.


Yeah. But if you know, that could cost you your life. I was To say not only That could cost you your life, nigga, But also if it attracts negative headlines like When, you don't have to Have that happen. You in another country, nigga, we seen ASAP Rocky get locked up because him and his team handle some shit in a manner that they shouldn't have handled it. Where if they would've had exterior people handling that situation that you gotta learn From that. I think it's easy for us to say because we not in that situation. True. I've seen, I've seen almost, not everybody, but I've seen almost everybody up here been approached at some point whether the guard was down or something and be frustrated by it because they just don't be bothered at that time. True. Right. So, so in that respect, we don't know the magnitude of what that person's dealing with within that moment.


So we have to at least give some level of, of bail to maybe a little grace. I'm not mad at giving a person a little grace. Yeah. That's a lot to deal with. But those are the re everything you said is correct, but those are the reasons because I know that I might be in a bad mood or some things may be affecting me. Why? I keep the buffers So. I don't have to deal with nobody. Oh, you Right, you right. Ain't that nigga makes enough money where he can have them niggas on call? Sure. You Can knocked off too. He ain. Security. You Get what I'm saying? No, I get what you're saying. I'm just, that's my whole point for me. Like even When I, when we was at the show, right? And they made fun of me because I went and You gotta get your life together, man. I just heard you I think that was you.


I Heard it was I It Wasn't, it was my man right there. It was When we were at the show, Joe made fun of me, right? Because I went to go literally, they didn't wanna speak to me. It was a young guy said he'd been watching the pod since 13 years old. He's now 20. He's like, yo, Erickson get that violin because this is the funniest, this nigga Amani will not stay seated. It's not true. Anybody That has something to say to Amani and hit him with one of these, Hey, come here. He get out his seat and go, that's not true. So I, look to the side. Little 13-year-old Billy done pulled Damani out of his seat. He's not 13, he 20 now. He sitting having a, he looked 13 in the face. He's having a whole conversation with Billy. I'm looking, I'm like, okay, this after he stood up with the lights on on the phone, ain't he talking to Billy's?


He's talking to anybody that want talk about something. So he talked to Billy, he come back, leave Billy. He tapped me. Hey, say what's up to him man. Big fan man. He said he'd been listening since that nigga I've been seated and I don't give two fucks about Billy. See, That's why are are you delivering a message to, from, from to me, from Billy? No, That's not, see, he's Gonna interpret fuck Billy. He's gonna interpret. See, that's wrong. I agree. That's fo I agree To say that it's foul. That's, I didn't say it. No, you just said it. We just did right now. And Billy probably listen listening right now. But he could feel that way. Yeah. Fuck with y I'm what? Be having a bad day. Listen what I'm saying. Listen what I'm saying.


And why would you deliver a message? Some, some people, some people when they, some people when they reach a certain level of success, So they talking, they Start to lose. They start to lose. Being in touch with just what it felt like to be a part of the people. That's one. Travis. And also be a fan. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Listen what I'm saying. So in that moment, as someone who is not in, I'm, no, I'm nowhere around that. I feel like I could be the calm buffer between someone feeling a connection with the pod in a certain way, but not being able to actually reach and touch that person way. Do do you know? Do you know How many people? So if I, and, and I could be the selfish person and be like, well he ain't trying to speak to me, so fuck him.


No, my thing is true. 13-year-old a a 20-year-old guy, he's been watching the pod since 13. He wants to at least show his appreciation. There should be somebody there who can be the buffer for that. you know how you do that? Salute. How about you? And if fans find out that you, a nigga that they could talk to, they all gonna come up to you. Cool. And guess what, man? I don't have a Problem with that because I remember what it felt like to be in that place. What's the place? Hey, yo, tell man I like him. Tell man I'm a fan. Tell him yourself. No. Why not? Go tell him yourself nigga Billy You can do that.


Oh nigga, fuck Billy, fuck him up. come on E I'm gonna chop here. Let that shit go. Stop that age. But this is how people, this is how people end up turning out to be like the Travis Scotts. And I'm joking. I'm joking. Shout out. Shout out to Billy. I'm, I'm talking shit. And his name's Not Billy. I don't know what his name is like on The podcast. He was a good, good guy and his approach was very respectful and he did it the right Way. That's good shout out. That's, yeah, but What else? What else is there? I wanted to apologize out there a few quick things I wanna fix up real quick. I wanted to apologize for my mayor Kingstown review. Y'all are not gonna believe why I fucked up dude. That, that he shot in the car that was in jail.


That was a little slow. I told you that. Yeah. You want to hear it? You're not even gonna believe me. However Psycho you think I am. You gonna think I'm even motorcycle? Hmm? Do you know that I confused that actor's character with the role that he played in the Shield? Yeah. You all Hell shit Yo. And the Shield, if you never watched it, it was a bunch of crooked cops and they used to sit at the table and come up with a plan for some crooked shit. And he was evil. We used to wear the same outfit that them niggas had on and This shit. I have no idea why that guy gave me shield because he was in the shield. I fucked that all up.


My apologies. That's good. I'm sorry. I went home and could not believe myself. I was like, oh yeah, this guy was a bad guy. Oh, Shit. It speaks to his acting. It's Fucked up.
